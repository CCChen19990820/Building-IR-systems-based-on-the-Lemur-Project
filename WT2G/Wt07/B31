Alger Hiss was the last surviving law clerk of Oliver Wendell Holmes, who certainly had a long and varied career, since he had also known John Quincy Adams. To put it another way, Justice Holmes knew men who worked for George Washington, and for Stalin.

Of course there's a mandate from the election, all the poohbahs of punditry tell us: for campaign-finance reform. There are just a couple of problems with this notion. 1) Voters don't care about finance reform, as they proved once again by handily re-electing Sen. Mitchell McConnell (R., Ky.), who regularly kills reform bills (and is promising to do so again this year). 2) The Democratic National Committee shenanigans that sparked the latest calls for reform are <I>already</I> illegal. What advocates of reform like Bill Bradley and the <I>New York Times</I> really want is a stifled public debate in which their voices will have less competition from grubby special interests like, say, small businesses, homeowners, political parties, etc. Their favorite vehicle is the bi-partisan McCain - Feingold bill, which would ban PACs, eliminate issues advocacy (e.g., Christian Coalition voter guides), and impose ``voluntary'' spending limits on Senate campaigns. Huge chunks of the bill are plainly unconstitutional. And its effect would be to shut out ordinary citizens -- who band together in groups like the National Right to Life PAC to increase their clout -- from the political process. Senator McConnell, over to you.

An AP poll conducted between October 18 and 22 asked six questions, one of them being whether Republican actions on cutting taxes, balancing the budget, reforming welfare, and shifting power from Washington to the states had gone too far, struck the right balance, or not gone far enough. Responses were as follows: 24 per cent, gone too far; 15 per cent, struck the right balance; 46 per cent, not gone far enough. In the AP summary report, the results of this question alone were (predictably?) excluded.

New Hampshire, the Granite State, has long been, well, a rock and a stronghold of a certain kind of conservatism, and so, on election night, the question was widely asked, ``What is happening to New Hampshire?'' For the first time in a quarter-century a Democrat, Jeanne Shaheen, had won the governorship, and a Democrat, Dick Swett, was erroneously projected by the TV networks as upsetting incumbent Republican conservative Sen. Bob Smith. In fact, Smith won, and New Hampshire retains two conservative senators (Smith and Judd Gregg) and two conservative representatives (Charles Bass and John Sununu Jr.). Yes, Clinton beat Dole. But Dole has never, ever won in New Hampshire. He had lost primaries to Reagan, Bush, and even Buchanan. Then he lost to Clinton. The gubernatorial race is instructive. Jeanne Shaheen ran as a conservative, taking the ``pledge'' not to try to introduce a state income or state sales tax. New Hampshire remains conservative, with a strong libertarian streak.

When the Supreme Court, in <I>Bush</I> v. <I>Vera</I> and <I>Shaw</I> v. <I>Hunt</I>, declared racially gerrymandered congressional districts unconstitutional, Jesse Jackson screamed, ``Ethnic cleansing!'' America is so racist, went the Jackson logic, that black congressmen would lose their seats if forced to run in predominantly white districts. When Abigail Thernstrom of the Manhattan Institute dissented, liberals assailed her suggestion that we should have a color-blind society as further evidence of bigotry. Mrs. Thernstrom was vindicated on November 5, when all five black representatives who sought re-election in new, white-majority districts in the South won handily. The results are impressive, most notably in the cases of Cynthia McKinney (D., Ga.), who took 58 per cent of the vote in a district that is 35 per cent black, and Sheila Jackson Lee (D., Tex.), who took 77 per cent against multiple opponents in a 42 per cent black district. What's surprising is not that so many Americans voted for blacks, but that they voted for Democrats.
n Mr. Clinton took the leadership on a Balanced Budget Amendment, announcing that he's for it and that he's against it -- in that order, we think, but maybe the other way around.

In <I>NR</I>'s November 11 issue, Immigration and Naturalization Commissioner Doris M. Meissner denied that there was anything wrong with letting the White House use her agency to create armies of Instant Democrats in time for the presidential election, as reported by Thomas McArdle (<I>NR</I>, July 1). Meanwhile, an uncritical profile of Mrs. Meissner appeared in the <I>New York Times Magazine</I> on October 27. ``We are a society committed to equal opportunity,'' she told the <I>Times Magazine</I> reporter, ``and in 1965 we rejected national origins as a basis of immigration.'' It is significant that Mrs. Meissner would justify the disastrous 1965 Immigration Act by projecting America's domestic civil-rights struggle onto the logically quite distinct issue of immigration policy. Shakespeare's soldier famously sought ``the bubble reputation/Even in the cannon's mouth.'' But where does Mrs. Meissner propose to pursue the demon Racism -- and can America survive her fixation?

With the election past and relations with a Republican Congress ahead, President Clinton allows that the two parties are close in their ideas for reforming Medicare. He finally admits, in other words, that the Democrats are just as interested in kicking seniors out of their homes and taking their medicine away as Republicans.

Carl Lischeske of the California Health Department was astonished to read a ``Fact Sheet'' from the U.S. Interior Department on low-level nuclear waste. It said that 98 per cent of radioactive materials needing disposal came from nuclear-power plants. In fact, the majority of nuclear waste comes from hospitals, the end product of radiation therapy. Lischeske traced the 98 per cent figure to a protest group which cited no source. He then found that the U.S. Department of Energy database on low-level waste showed that less than a third of wastes are from nuclear utilities. He wrote the U.S. Interior Department: ``Rather than accepting information provided by anti-nuclear activists without question you may want to consider utilizing instead the information services provided by the U.S. Department of Energy and the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission . . .'' No answer yet. It's a new resource-use program: recycling Green propaganda.

The President further allows that there are no big differences between the parties on such issues as the environment, education, and welfare. Fine. It's about time the Democrats pitched in and did their share of poisoning the land and sea, trampling women's reproductive rights, throwing welfare moms into the gutter, and making starving schoolchildren memorize the multiplication tables.

The great power-line debate is over. The National Academy of Sciences has released a report on a review of 500 studies done over the last 17 years; the report concluded that there is no evidence that power lines, or electromagnetic fields, cause cancer. A 1979 study indicating a link between childhood leukemia and power lines launched the debate; in the early 1990s <I>New Yorker</I> author Paul Brodeur whipped up a public frenzy which resulted in million-dollar reconfigurations of power lines, lawsuits against cellular-phone companies, and a moralistic film comedy on the subject by Eddie Murphy. But sacred cows die hard, and doomsayers have now pinned their hopes on power surges. While scientific evidence does indicate a marginal correlation between childhood leukemia and proximity to power lines, the causes for this could be as diverse as traffic levels near power lines, older houses near power lines, less affluent families near power lines, and so on. But exhaustive research has concluded that the one thing that does not cause cancer near power lines is power lines.

<FONT SIZE=+3>W</FONT><font size=+1>HAT</font> more can be said about a campaign which, in its waning days, had Ross Perot calling it ``weird and inconsequential'' and its own candidate going negative, finally, but against the voters? ``Wake up, America!'' said Dole, adding a characteristic twist to Reagan's 1984 ``Morning in America'' theme. Asked what went wrong, a former RNC official sighs. ``It's kind of like asking when your dad dies of cancer, which cigarette did it? Bury the body and move on.''
<P>
OK, but not before piling on a few more shovelsful of dirt. Plenty of Republicans blame Dole for digging his own grave. He treated his nomination like a gold watch given by the company on his retirement. Even the most gifted staff would have had a tough time selling a candidate who spoke in Dole's trademark ``telegraphic'' style, and who blurted out remarks his aides had made to him about NAACP ``set-ups'' and ``wedge issues.'' And of course an incumbent presiding over a nation at peace and with a tolerable economy was likely to win re-election. But neither uncontrollable circumstances nor Dole's (well-known) weaknesses as a candidate should obscure the fact that this campaign was the most abysmal one Republicans have mounted in modern times. It was worse even than Bush - Quayle '92, which most observers would not have thought possible.
<P>
President Clinton's re-election team was sophisticated, coordinated, and aggressive. Dole's staff matched them in cynicism but little else. <I>Their</I> aggression was chiefly directed at each other. Mike Murphy, who was dismissed in September as Dole's media consultant, later wrote that distrust and secrecy made the campaign ``like the Kremlin.'' Former staffers and hangers-on paint a similar picture. ``There are departments that don't speak to other departments,'' said one. ``The press shop won't speak to the rapid-response shop. . . . People are too turf-conscious.'' Campaign manager Scott Reed exacerbated the problem by running the campaign like Jeremy Bentham's Panopticon: he knew what each department was doing but they couldn't follow each other.
<P>
It's not surprising, then, that staffers would air their internal strategic disputes in public. For two weeks the campaign debated whether to attack Clinton's character, using the <I>Washington Post</I>'s front page as an intermediary. This was of a piece with the campaign's general leakiness, which tended to undercut campaign tactics. Putting Billy Dale in the front row of the audience for the first presidential debate was a clever touch, for example, but it would have been more clever if Clinton hadn't been warned of it in the newspaper the day before. Other leaks demonstrated staffers' disloyalty. The week of the election, <I>The New Yorker</I>'s Michael Kelly quoted Reed as absolving himself from any responsibility for the coming defeat. (Reed's lame defense of his remarks: ``The piece was supposed to be written after the election.'')
<P>
The campaign's rocky press relations caused other problems too. The campaign, particularly John Buckley's communications operation, was obsessed with getting good coverage in the elite media (the networks, the <I>Post</I>, the <I>New York Times</I>). Previous, successful Republican campaigns had gone around the establishment media, appealing directly to the American people and exploiting alternative media outlets. Dole's campaign did neither. It avoided talk radio, much to the consternation of the Republican National Committee. In order not to offend elite-media sensibilities, the campaign, in effect, internalized the media's standards.
<P>
So, the San Diego convention was designed to prevent the media from being able to repeat their demonization of the 1992 Houston convention. It was soft and fuzzy, like cotton candy, and the ``bounce'' it generated melted just as quickly. Or take the first presidential debate. The talking heads said Dole had to show that he wasn't mean and that he had mastered the complexities of public policy. So he did both, having been coached on the latter by Sheila Burke, and the pundits patted him on the head for being a graceful loser.
<P>
If the campaign overemphasized media reactions, it was obsessed with polls. Nobody questions the competence of campaign pollster Tony Fabrizio or the accuracy of his findings; those findings just weren't translated into practical advice. Pollster Kellyanne Fitzpatrick criticizes ``the use of focus groups and polls as a source to base Dole's convictions rather than a tool to develop strategy. You've got to <I>move</I> polls, not just measure them.'' The fixations on polls and the press combined to make Dole hesitant to ``go negative.'' Yet a successful campaign had to be ``negative,'' i.e., to persuade voters to fire the incumbent. Voters don't like negativity, but attacks stick in their minds and affect their decisions. Clinton started his anti-Dole ads early, got the message to stick, and was able to end his campaign on a positive note. When the Dole campaign finally started attacking Clinton it was too late, and what stuck in voters' minds was the negativity.
<P>
Meanwhile, the campaign bounced from tax cuts to drugs to tax cuts to school choice to character to . . . whatever. From the voters' perspective, it was all so much white noise. The campaign displayed a pathological aversion to staying on message. It never even ran a decent ad on the 15 per cent tax cut which was its supposed centerpiece. Dole muddled other messages. When he proposed a modest set of political reforms to highlight the Indogate scandal, for instance, he reinforced the Democrats' line that the problem was current law, not Clinton's failure to abide by it. In indicting the political system in general, he implicitly excused Clinton in particular. Dole's ``better man for a better America'' slogan was never given political content; like Bush before him, Dole clung to the hope that the public would prefer him as a person to Clinton.
<P>
Dole's worst strategic mistake was to heed Richard Nixon's advice to run right in the primaries and then run to the center for the general election. Dole alienated social conservatives and gun-rights supporters and took other conservatives for granted. He distanced himself from the supposedly ``extremist'' Republican Congress, even though congressional candidates, the Congress as a whole, and the party were always more popular than Dole. At a gathering of Washington conservatives this summer, Fabrizio, acting as the campaign's emissary, brusquely dismissed their complaints with the explanation that they didn't have anywhere else to go. He said they should go along with Dole the way the gay lobby was putting up with Clinton's political infidelities.
<P>
Nixon's proposed strategy -- which, by the way didn't really describe his own m.o. -- presupposed the other candidate's total unacceptability to conservatives. As the exit polls show, that wasn't the case with Clinton. The strategy also poisoned the campaign's relations with Congress. They never were good: House Majority Leader Dick Armey had trouble getting calls returned. But Dole's abandonment of congressional Republicans on the assault-weapons issue was the last straw. They abandoned him by sending Clinton bills he could sign and for which all incumbents could take credit. Dole staffers' bitter complaints about the ``betrayal,'' particularly on welfare, fell on deaf ears. Republicans, in short, did not run as a team, as they had in 1994. The Dole campaign viewed outsiders -- even, at times, the RNC -- as threats rather than resources.
<P>
The campaign's second worst strategic mistake was the neglect of social, moral, and cultural issues. The California Civil Rights Initiative was held at arm's length, then embraced at a point when Dole could only drag it down. Partial-birth abortion was addressed sporadically. ``I wish that we had gone to Notre Dame and given a major speech on partial-birth abortion and made a major play for the Catholic vote,'' says speechwriter Mike Gerson. Drug use was the only social issue Dole dwelt on, and it's the sort of consensus issue that doesn't move many votes. Peter Roff, political director of GOPAC, says, ``They decided to run a campaign based largely on economics, which was an interesting experiment and we now see it didn't work.''
<P>
The list of legitimate criticisms of the campaign is practically inexhaustible. Dole addressed the gender gap by touting his support for the Violence Against Women Act and visiting a shelter for battered women. The campaign didn't court Reagan Democrats. Various states were written off and then put back in play. There was never any follow-through on dramatic events like Dole's resignation from the Senate. In retrospect, the vice-presidential selection was also a mistake. Dole should have picked someone who could deliver a swing state and help with a swing demographic group, someone with a track record of winning votes. A Midwestern Catholic governor like John Engler of Michigan would have met all those tests; Jack Kemp met none of them. As a final indignity, Dole closed the campaign alongside Gerald Ford and George Bush -- forming a trio with an impressive seven failed White House bids.
<P> 
Can anything be salvaged from all the self-serving leaks, back-biting, and embarrassments of this campaign? If it results in a reform of the primary process that led to Dole's nomination, some good will have come of it. One conservative activist in Washington proposes another reform. Referring to Dole -  Kemp HQ, he says, ``Nobody who walked into 810 First Street should ever work for Republicans again.''

<H2>On Needed Extremism</H2></CENTER>
<HR>
<P>
NEW YORK, NOVEMBER 8<br>


A very bright professor, on Wednesday, trying to give cheer to his despondent companion, summed it up in this way: ``Look. The guy who was elected President is a Republican Democrat. He got 49 per cent of the vote. He was running against a Republican Republican, who won 41 per cent of the vote. The third candidate was a conservative with 8 per cent. The House stayed Republican by about 19 seats, with 80 per cent of the 1994 freshman Republicans winning re-election. The Senate stayed Republican by 10 seats, and the majority of governors are Republican. So what's the gloom all about?''
<P>
Nicely done, if conservative uplift is the order of the day. But the air seemed saturated, on D-Day+1, with strains of the old melody: The middle road. One commentator said it bluntly: The Lord has spoken, and what we have seen is a repudiation of extremists, of both the Left and the Right. The way of the future is down the middle of the road. 
<P>
The Lord wasn't all that plainspoken, some of us conclude. Bob Dornan of California -- ``B-1 Bob,'' as his dazzled critics think of him -- is hanging in there, with a tiny lead. Strom Thurmond, at the end of his freshly renewed term, will be one hundred years old. And Jesse Helms had his customary victory. On the far Left, Mr. Bonior of Michigan squeaked through, as did several members of the Establishment Left like Charles Rangel, who was quoted as saying he intended to be buried in Chicago, so that he could continue an active political career posthumously. 
<P>
We are left, of course, with the question: How do you define an extremist? The thesaurus gives fanatic as a synonym, and the <I>American Heritage Dictionary</I> contributes a Usage Note: ``synonyms: <I>fanatic</I>, <I>zealot</I>, <I>enthusiast</I>. These nouns denote persons who are ardently and usually excessively devoted to a particular cause, subject, or activity. <I>Fanatic</I> implies the pursuit of a given interest to inordinate and even irrational lengths, often to the exclusion of all other interests: <I>'A fanatic is one who can't change his mind and won't change the subject'</I> (Winston S. Churchill). A <I>zealot</I> is immoderately devoted to a cause or goal and seeks to advance it with passionate fervor: <I>'those furious zealots who blow the bellows of faction until the whole furnace of politics is red-hot'</I> (Washington Irving). <I>Enthusiast</I> can denote a religious zealot holding visionary opinions. More commonly, however, it merely implies strong interest in something such as a hobby, and lacks the unfavorable connotations of the other terms: <I>"a hockey enthusiast"</I>.
<P>
We see, then, that the term <I>extremist</I> can readily be used to stigmatize a position different from one's own. The professional politicians still reel from the pronouncement by Barry Goldwater in 1964 that moderation in pursuit of justice is no virtue, extremism in defense of liberty is no vice. You get an absolute and plausible consensus on extremism only when it is used to designate riflemen who wander about (in isolated numbers) mumbling about the need to take the law into their own hands. Extremism can be used, and has been, to denounce people who kill without judicial authority, as also those who execute in state prisons. There is a difference, and that difference teaches us to use words with caution. And the beginning of wisdom here is to decline to retreat from a desired political objective simply because it is anathematized as extremist by True Believers, or opportunists. 
<P>
The most prominent of the issues in question is of course abortion. Although the great majority coast in and out of the polling booth unaffected by the issue, abortion is as divisive as any question in the public square. What surely is needed is the rejection of the finding in <I>Roe</I> v. <I>Wade</I>, to the effect that the right to abort is fundamental and constitutionally given. This space is not given over to the one-millionth consideration of the opinion of the majority, rather to a legitimate objective of the GOP, which should not be denounced as extremist. It is to return the authority to govern abortions to the states. We already know (Connecticut is an example) that there are states anxious to write into their laws guarantees of abortion rights. The quarrels then would be inside marginal states, easing away the question as a national issue. 
<P>
The GOP leadership should frame a new and non-extremist position: We abandon the goal of constitutional reform, you abandon opposition to ditching <I>Roe</I> v. <I>Wade</I>.

Is it me, or did we win? 
<P>
I'm not trying to be huffy here, but we did win, right? I mean, I guess my question is, if we won, then why do we need to have quite so many discussions about ``reaching out'' to Colin Powell and ``building bridges'' with Dick Gephardt?
<P>
In the first place, I'm not sure why we're making so many changes in the Administration. Forgive me, but I think the one we had was pretty darn good. Donna Shalala was a killer over at HHS; Henry Cisneros did a bang-up job at HUD; and Warren Christopher was one of the best Secretaries of State we've had, considering his age and the fact that he has no presidential ambition. 
<P>
Americans voted for the status quo. Why in heaven's name aren't we giving it to them? 
<P>
If I sound angry, Rusty, it's because I am. The Gore family is knocking itself out trying to prepare for the next election. For the next three years, the girls have promised to stay away from creepy boyfriends and avoid big desserts; and little Al, bless his heart, is taking up soccer. ``Now you're a soccer mom!'' he shouted with glee, and Tipper promised to drive him to every game from September 1999 to November 2000 and to publicly complain about her ``crazy schedule.'' Karenna thinks she may be ready to get married, so we're on the lookout for a) a suitable groom, and b) the right Saturday in May 2000 for a Rose Garden wedding, with receptions to follow in Florida and California.
<P>
And Mom and Dad, troupers to their very last breath, have promised not to breathe it until the eve of the Democratic National Convention. 
<P>
So in the face of that all-out Gore effort, it doesn't seem like too much to ask that the rest of the Administration pitch in and lend a hand. 
<P>
That's why this Colin-Powell-as-Secretary-of-State business has me so nettled. 
<P>
``What about sweet old George Mitchell?'' I asked.
<P>
``Too partisan,'' was the reply.
<P>
``Then what about Dick Holbrooke? After all, he's not running for President.''
<P>
``Don't be too sure. He's set up an exploratory committee and a fund-raising arm called 'America Deserves Dick Holbrooke.'''

``Does he really think he's qualified to be President?'' I asked.

``No, but he's willing to stoop a little.''

With Colin Powell at State and William Weld as a possible Attorney General, I joked to Bill that he may as well get Christie Whitman in here to replace me.
<P>
``Good idea,'' he said, and reached for the phone. 
<P>
``Whoa whoa whoa,'' I said. ``What gives? We won! Let's act like winners. Maybe throw our weight around a little. Not return a few phone calls. Forget to invite Dick Gephardt to the White House Christmas Tree Lighting.''

``Al,'' Bill said, ``we've been through this. You know what we have to do. Look, if I were you, I wouldn't be so concerned with what goes on around here. Think of it this way: every meal you eat at home is a meal you're not eating with two thousand Buddhist monks.'' 
<P>
I thought about this long and hard. In my heart, I knew Bill was right. We do need at least one Republican around. But which one? 
<P>
That night, as we got ready for bed, I laid out the situation for Tipper. ``Tip,'' I said, ``Bill makes a pretty convincing case that if I want to be elected in four years, we've got to show some real accomplishments. And the only way we're going to accomplish anything is if we have a bipartisan Administration. But which Republicans do you think I should accept?''
<P> 
She fluffed the pillows for a second. ``Jack Kemp at HUD and Pat Buchanan at Commerce.''
<P> 
``What?'' I shouted. ``Both of those guys are planning to run in the primaries! Putting them in a Clinton Cabinet would only elevate them to front-runner status!'' 
<P>
She fluffed some more. 
<P>
``Plus,'' I went on, ``won't we look ideologically schizophrenic?'' 
<P>
She shot me a raised-eyebrow look. ``That ship,'' she said, ``has sailed.''
<P> 
``But -- '' 
<P>
``Al, if you could help two Republicans win the nomination in 2000, which would they be?''
<P> 
I thought for a second. ``Oh,'' I said. ``Gotcha.''
<P> 
It was the first good night of sleep I've had since the election. 
<P>
Gotta go. Tipper and I are pricing minivans today. Soccer moms don't use armor-plated Town Cars!

Fifty-three per cent of smokers, according to polls, voted for Bill Clinton. It's a helluva way to quit.

<P>
<hr>
<P>

Results from ballot initiatives around the country confirm the electorate's anti-government tilt. In nine states, voters approved congressional term limits; in two more the vote was too close to call at press time. Florida voters approved the toughest anti-tax initiative in the land, requiring a two-thirds vote of the people for any new tax. Nevada and South Dakota passed only slightly less stringent measures. (In Arizona, where such a super-majority law already exists, the legislature doesn't even bother to request new taxes.) Meanwhile, most of the Left's initiatives went down in flames. The trial lawyers lost their bid in California to overturn the federal law barring frivolous shareholder suits. Two separate initiatives to take over the California health-care system lost by 2 to 1. Big Green took a pounding too: a sugar tax to pay for Everglades clean-up, a ban on clear-cutting in Maine, and a bottle-tax proposal in Oregon all went down. One hopes the elected show as much common sense as the voters.

<P>

What do these people have in common: the Republican governors, Jack Kemp, Bob Torricelli, and Charles Rangel? They are all tipped in Jude Wanniski's post-election fax as ``promising possibilities [of] optimism.'' FYI.

<P>
Republican giddiness over the possibility of President Clinton's being hobbled by scandal, and maybe even impeached, is understandable. But congressional Republicans, while investigating the Indogate affair (and other outstanding Clinton scandals), should keep in mind a few cautionary words. First, impeaching a President should not be foreseen with glee. While President Clinton may deserve his fate, the country does not deserve the upheaval that would attend his comeuppance. Nor is it certain that Kenneth Starr will indict the First Lady or that the President will be implicated in Indogate. To assume so is escapism: let scandals take care of Clinton, then the GOP won't have to decide how to beat a slippery Democrat who foils them at every turn. The GOP can't expect Kenneth Starr to do its work for it.

Still, the week was enlivened when John Huang, top Democratic Party fund-raiser, took it on the lam rather than answer questions. An eyewitness even saw a man of Mr. Huang's description sprinting out a back door of Democratic National Committee headquarters as U.S. marshals came in the front door with a subpoena. Hillary Rodham Clinton nonetheless managed to send a note to the fugitive saying, ``We all support Mr. Huang.'' Nobody knew where he was, but Mr. Huang received that message. It is a miracle unless -- <I>yes!</I> -- Eleanor delivered it.

<P>
<hr>
<P>

A desperate <I>New York Times</I>, trying to explain why the President's bad habits are reasons to vote for him: ``Scandals present an opportunity in the second term for Bill Clinton to get back in touch with integrity and honesty.'' Why stop there? A series of axe murders in broad daylight would be reason to scrap the Twenty-Second Amendment and keep the guy till 2004.

<P>

As the campaign for the California Civil Rights Initiative came down the home stretch, the <I>Los Angeles Times</I> ran an article citing late writings of Martin Luther King in support of racial preferences. Charlton Heston, who had joined King's 1963 March on Washington, wrote a letter to the editor recalling that he had stood in the Senate gallery in 1964 as Hubert Humphrey argued for the Civil Rights Bill. Asked if it might lead to quotas and preferences, Humphrey vehemently denied it. ``I can't know what was in Dr. King's heart,'' Heston concluded, ``but Hubert Humphrey was a man of honor. The language of preference was not in the bill. That grew gradually over the next twenty years, under the monstrous bureaucracy that still fights to keep the injustice it has wrought.'' The <I>Times</I>, evidently pressed for space, did not run the letter.

The White House, pulling an old soap-opera trick, claims there was another John Huang (perhaps a long-lost amnesiac twin) making all those visits to the inner circle. Nice try, but two Huangs still don't make a right.

The Clinton Administration refused to come clean -- before the election -- on its plans for the 35,000 U.S. troops in Bosnia. They would complete their peacekeeping mission in ``about one year,'' the President promised the nation in a televised address on November 27, 1995. Now, the Administration is reportedly considering two options for an extended tour: 1) a ``withdrawal'' option, which actually involves sending 5,000 new GIs to cover the withdrawal of the 35,000 by March 1997, after which an air-assault brigade and fighter aircraft would remain nearby (``over the horizon'') indefinitely; 2) a ground-force presence, smaller than the present one, to remain in Bosnia through late 1997 and possibly beyond. Defense Secretary Perry told Congress in October that no decision has been made. But the one option not likely to be chosen is what the President originally promised. Meanwhile, as the political provisions of the Dayton Accords unravel, American training and equipping of the Bosnians is stalled -- another Clinton promise blowing in the wind. This is why the U.S. and NATO have to worry about using their troops to do what the Bosnians should be doing for themselves.

Barbara Coe, a leader of the California Coalition for Immigration Reform and an architect of California's Proposition 187, is being threatened with legal action by the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, California's Secretary of State, the Orange County Registrar's Office, and the U.S. Department of Justice. Miss Coe's offense? ``Intimidating voters'' by posting and distributing flyers stating the law: ``Only Citizens Can Vote! Violators Will Be Prosecuted!'' Opposing election fraud is now apparently a crime in California.

Under the 1990 Hate Crime Statistics Act, the FBI classifies victims of hate crimes by race, ethnicity, religion, and sexual orientation, but identifies perpetrators only by race. Hispanics, therefore, are recognized as victims, but not as perpetrators. Since most Hispanics are officially identified as ``white,'' if a Hispanic attacks a black, it is typically counted as a white-on-black hate crime. Similarly, if a Hispanic attacks an Asian, it is a white-on-Asian hate crime. And if a Hispanic attacks a Hispanic, it is a white-on-Hispanic hate crime. No word yet on how the FBI classifies those who attack common sense, or the principle that all men are created <I>iguales</I>.

 WASHINGTON, D.C.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+3>A</FONT><font size=+1>T HALF</font> past nine on election night, the Dole campaign conceded defeat. ``Bob Dole has completed his last political mission with courage and honor,'' said press secretary Nelson Warfield in a press release. Half an hour later, Warfield was backtracking in another release marked ``URGENT'': ``Due to an error, a statement from the Dole campaign was prematurely released to some news outlets this evening. The fact is Bob Dole has conceded nothing.'' An hour or so later, the campaign conceded that its original concession was correct.
<P>
It was a fitting end for a campaign that rarely made a tactical move without protracted bouts of public agonizing, oftentimes only to reverse field again within a few weeks or even hours. Attack or take the ``high road''? Contest California or not? Pound home the tax-cut message or abandon it? The Dole campaign never had the same answer for long, and so it's little wonder that in the final hours it couldn't even decide whether or not it had lost. The election just couldn't end without one more Dole campaign fiasco.
<P>
It was a status-quo end to a status-quo campaign. If the Dole camp thought it may have conceded too early, other Republicans had been ready to throw in the towel months before. Dole never was able to gain a foothold against his agile opponent. The ads, initiatives, and campaign trips of the last three months did little to alter the basic shape of the race. Nor have they changed the State of the Union. The White House remains Democratic, the Congress Republican. Even the line-up of states in the Electoral College remains essentially the same as in the Bush - Clinton election of 1992. It was an incumbents' night.
<P>
The last two years have featured a continued tug-of-war over the proper role of government in American life. The liberal vision of a government growing by leaps and bounds has been, it can by now be confidently stated, firmly repudiated; but the conservative vision of a relimited government has not been fully accepted by the public. The 1996 elections were widely expected to resolve the issue for the next decade. Instead the voters left matters unsettled. Not that the candidates did much to help them decide. The Democrats all talked about their support of the balanced budget; the Republicans boasted of increasing spending on Medicare.
<P>
It was Clinton's good fortune to run for re-election in a generally satisfied country. As one would expect, those who thought the economy was ``good'' or ``excellent'' went heavily for the incumbent, while those who viewed it as ``not good'' or ``poor'' opted for the challenger. Unfortunately for Dole, there were more of the former (56 per cent) than the latter (42 per cent). Similarly, the 53 per cent of voters who think the country is headed in the right direction strongly favored Clinton while the 43 per cent who worried that it is on the wrong track broke, albeit less heavily, for Dole. 
<P>
Even if circumstances had been more propitious for a Republican presidential candidate, Bob Dole's liabilities would have made him a tough sell. In a fit of overconfidence, the <I>Wall Street Journal</I> once editorialized that any Republican who didn't drool could probably beat Bill Clinton. It turns out that voters demanded more than that, like a candidate who could complete a sentence. Not only did Dole garble his arguments and baffle his audiences with references to Beltway arcana, when he did manage to make a point he would often undercut it with self-deprecatory irony.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+3>N</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>O</FONT> wonder voters concluded that this difficult, remote figure didn't understand their problems or have a vision for the future: 51 per cent of voters doubted that Dole understood their problems; only 12 per cent of those who thought ``vision'' the most important quality in a candidate voted for Dole; 56 per cent of voters said Dole hadn't given them a reason to vote for him. And then there was Dole's age. Most voters (64 per cent) professed not to be concerned by Dole's age, but the minority that thought it would affect his performance gave a whopping 79 per cent of their votes to Clinton. If their votes had been excluded, Dole would have won the election.
<P>
But the most important factor was that Dole drove away the Republican base. From the outset conservatives had, at best, little enthusiasm for the senior senator from Kansas. Yet instead of trying to woo them, once the primaries were over the campaign went out of its way to offend them, seemingly confusing this accomplishment with winning over swing voters. The combination of an unattractive messenger and a misbegotten message kept Dole from taking votes that should have been his.
<P>
Thirteen per cent of the voters who selected George Bush in 1992 defected to Clinton this year. So did 20 per cent of self-identified conservatives and 26 per cent of the ``white Religious Right.'' Dole only tied among married people, and Clinton actually took a plurality of parents of minors. As for the notion -- sure to be bruited about as frequently after the election as before -- that an unpopular Congress dragged Dole down, it's worth noting that 16 per cent of voters who approved of the Republican Congress left Dole in the lurch. This shouldn't have been a surprise: during the campaign Dole consistently polled below congressional candidates, the Congress as a whole, and the Republican Party.
<P>
Other Republicans were able to appeal to the party's base and fashion winning coalitions. Phil Gramm, no ideological wallflower, ran 6 points ahead of Dole in Texas. Conservative Tim Hutchinson was able to win election to the Senate in President Clinton's home turf of Arkansas, running 15 points ahead of Dole. A number of Senate candidates who lost probably would have won without the Dole drag. Dole lost Louisiana by 13 points; Woody Jenkins lost the chance to become the Senate's most conservative member in a squeaker.
<P>
Indeed, Dole probably hurt his side more than Clinton helped his. The crowning victory of Clinton's career is hardly a resounding affirmation of his Presidency. He is the first President since Woodrow Wilson to win two consecutive elections with a minority of the vote. Most Americans continue to harbor serious reservations about the President's character: 52 per cent said they were ``concerned'' or ``scared'' about the prospect of a Clinton victory; 54 per cent consider him untrustworthy or dishonest; 59 per cent doubt that he has told the truth about Whitewater. Dole won heavily among the minority of voters who listed a candidate's ``character'' as more important than his stands on issues. Despite Clinton's constant calls for national unity, he is a deeply divisive figure: most of the people who voted for him think he tells the truth, but an incredible 91 per cent of Dole supporters put him in the ``dishonest/untrustworthy'' category. A smaller slice of voters (18 per cent), which might be dubbed the ``character swing vote,'' voted for Clinton despite their distrust.
<P>
Given these ambivalent attitudes toward Clinton it's not surprising that no Democratic sweep materialized despite Clinton's Electoral College sweep. This year saw no partisan tide for the Democrats of the kind that brought Republicans to power in Congress in 1994, no public yearning for a return to a united and purposeful Democratic government. Crucial in stemming any nationwide Democratic resurgence in the campaign's final days were ads bought by the National Republican Campaign Committee warning of the dangers of a ``blank check'' for President Clinton that would allow him to return to his tax-and-spend ways. Republican candidates took similar tacks in their individual races, tagging their opponents as ``liberals'' and trying to associate them with the Democratic majorities of old.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+3>I</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>T</FONT> was really a two-pronged effort. As Republican candidates hardened the perception of their opponents' ideological edges they sought to soften their own. Even an aggressive conservative like Tim Hutchinson spoke proudly of his vote for the minimum wage. The universal refrain of Republicans from coast to coast was that they had <I>increased</I> spending for education, for student loans, for environmental programs, and of course, for school lunches. Leader of the revolution Newt Gingrich demonstrated the method himself when he cut an ad attacking his opponent, cookie maker Michael Coles, for paying some workers only the minimum wage. (Make that the cookie monster.)
<P>
Democrats hoped, of course, to make Gingrich the focus of every race in the country. That strategy clearly failed. The public's hostility to Gingrich is personal, not ideological. Republicans could thus inoculate themselves from the charge of being Gingrich clones simply by convincing voters that they were nice guys with the best interests of their districts at heart; they didn't have to dissociate themselves from the substance of the Republican revolution. In only one House race did the nuke-Newt strategy clearly draw blood: the surprisingly tough run liberal Republican Nancy Johnson had in her usually safe Connecticut district. At press time Rep. Johnson's race is still in doubt. Shocks like that happen when the party's presidential candidate loses a state by 16 points, but a crucial factor in Mrs. Johnson's race was the hits she took for allegedly covering for Gingrich in her capacity as chairman of the House Ethics Committee. The ethics charges against Gingrich may yet hurt other Republicans in coming months, but for now it is far more significant that he was the architect of Congress's rise to its highest approval ratings in ten years.
<P>
Also a flop was the labor-union charge against Republican freshmen. Only 14 (out of 73) were defeated. A couple of factors were at work. First, all the Democrats' spending a year ago did help ``burn in'' the impression that Republicans were an intemperate majority willing to embrace ``extremist'' means -- i.e., shutting down the government -- to achieve the ends of special interests. The Medicare issue also was effective against some Republicans (although Clinton actually did worse among seniors than in 1992). In the end it seems the labor unions overreached; they ran their ads so early and many of them were so ham-handed that by the stretch run they had lost their force. The special $35 million in forced union dues spent to elect a Democratic Congress works out to $2.5 million per defeated Republican freshman, some of whom would have lost even if the unions had left every dime in the bank. The morning after the election, GOP pollster Kellyanne Fitzpatrick remarked that a CEO who made an investment like that would be fired.
<P>
In the run-up to the elections, ``union bosses'' had to compete for news coverage with ``soccer moms.'' The oft-discussed gender gap was real and harmful to Dole and other Republicans. If men were the only ones who had voted, Republicans would probably be striding toward a veto-proof majority in the Senate: Lightfoot and Harkin tied among men, Woody Jenkins narrowly beat Mary Landrieu among men. The ultimate causes of the gender gap are unclear, and Republicans are sure to argue over it in coming months. In a pre-election interview Republican analyst Jim Pinkerton lamented ``the horrible gender-gap problem that, excuse me, the pro-life issue gives Republicans. I'm sure you're not going to print that but it's true.'' That's sure to be the conventional wisdom we'll hear for weeks. Yet the Massachusetts Senate race provides evidence against that contention. Republican Gov. William Weld is an impeccable social liberal -- he even sided with Clinton's decision to keep partial-birth abortion legal -- and he still trailed among women by 21 points while tying among men. 
<P>
If Republicans are from Mars, Democrats are from Venus. Dole's margin among suburban dads was twice as high as Clinton's margin among suburban moms. And the Democrats do not have quite the hold on women they might hope. The President, whose way with women has been the focus of extravagant praise from the press, got slightly less of the women's vote than Reagan did in 1984. And quite a few Republicans had no particular trouble appealing to women. New Arkansas Sen. Tim Hutchinson, a principled conservative but a soothing personality, tied among women in Arkansas. Even Phil Gramm, a not-so-soothing personality, won among all women by 9 points and among white women by 30 points, after running a hard-hitting, issue-driven campaign in the Lone Star State. 
<P>
The magic bullet that was supposed to get Dole out of all his troubles, with women and everyone else, was his 15 per cent tax plan. It was a well-crafted proposal that should have been politically appealing; under the plan a couple making $35,000 a year with two children would have seen their tax burden reduced by <I>one-third</I> (a datum that the Dole campaign didn't push nearly hard enough). Deficit-phobia wasn't the problem: 58 per cent of voters recognized that it is possible to cut taxes <I>and</I> the deficit. But two-thirds of voters didn't think <I>Dole</I> could do both. To voters his about-face on tax cuts seemed (like so much of his campaign) a matter of mere expedience.
In retrospect, if Dole was going to ignore his political instincts and pick a conservative theme to make the centerpiece of his campaign, that theme should have come out of the cluster of social and cultural issues. Exhibit number one is the California Civil Rights Initiative, banning race and gender preferences by government entities in California. All year long, CCRI outran Dole. Its momentum withstood a vicious late blitz of demagogic attacks and outright lies. The Dole campaign eschewed the issue for fear of alienating those soccer moms (soccer is a multi-cultural game, after all). But early exit polls indicate that CCRI won 51 per cent of the women's vote, a performance of which Bob Dole could only dream.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+3>W</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>HAT</FONT> does this mean for the next two years? The Senate will be marginally more Republican and appreciably more conservative. Liberal-to-moderate Republicans Mark Hatfield (Ore.), Nancy Landon Kassebaum (Kan.), Alan Simpson (Wyo.), and, of course, Bob Dole are all out the door. Replacing them is a freshman class of Republicans that will move the body to the right in philosophy and attitude: Sam Brownback (Kan.), Tim Hutchinson (Ark.), Mike Enzi (Wyo.), Wayne Allard (Colo.), and Jeff Sessions (Ala.). Instead of being slowed down by the Senate, House Republicans could find themselves straining to keep up.
<P>
Gingrich himself, of course, will start from a position of diminished power. Many members have had to dodge bullets with Gingrich's name on them and will be less willing to follow his lead than two years ago, and committee chairmen were already getting restive in the waning days of the last Congress. Gingrich is likely to be eager to embrace an aggressive bi-partisanship to win media goodwill. Indeed, the White House spin, adopted by the major media, is that the election results were a mandate for co-operation in Washington, for getting things done. House members who saw their early poor poll results turn around after they passed the minimum wage, welfare reform, and health regulation will be especially susceptible to this interpretation.
<P>
But voters <I>never</I> favor partisan confrontation; they don't want ``gridlock.'' And yet, they prefer some policies to others, and a majority prefer Republican policies. The fact that a majority of voters voted against Clinton should register with savvy Republicans even if the news doesn't reach the press. Republicans needn't accept whatever Clinton throws at them. On tax cuts, for instance, it's not at all clear that Clinton's tiny, targeted tax credits have won a mandate over broader tax relief. And Republicans should take heed of the fact that it was cleverly packaged partisan confrontation, over issues of Clinton's choosing, that paved the way for his comeback.
<P>
Measured against what might have been, the Republican showing on November 5 was disappointing: two years ago they thought they ruled the world and laughed at the possibility of a second Clinton term. They shouldn't have. But there are signs that the secular trend is still toward increased Republican dominance of American politics. Economic conditions fluctuate, and so does the quality of candidates and campaigns. If those factors had been different this year, Republicans would probably have had another sweep like 1994's. So, while the Dole campaign lost long before 9:30 P.M. on November 5, it's still too early for Republicans with designs on a historic realignment to concede defeat.

<H2>What to Do About the Expatriate?</H2></CENTER>
<HR>
<P>
NEW YORK, OCTOBER 22<br>
The question, from a member of the Democratic panel, was intended as hostile. What did we Republicans think of American citizens who, in order to save taxes, give up their citizenship?
<P>
I answered to the effect that protest against taxation is a venerable American habit, thought to be axiomatic by those of our ancestors who emptied a boat laden with tea into Boston Harbor. 
<P>
Well, what did we think of the proposal to bar such expatriates from living here for more than four months every year? 
<P>
That question sends us back to the thought-library. When is expatriation commendable? 
<P>
We begin by acknowledging that all Americans are the fruit of expatriation. We have never cultivated harsh thoughts for those who left England or Holland in search of greater religious freedom than they had at home. Certainly we do not resent those who came to America fleeing persecution. And, on reflection, we do not resent those who came here looking for commercial opportunity, do we? If Andrew Carnegie left Scotland intending nothing more than to make a fortune in the New World, what is the proper attitude of the Scots he abandoned?
<P>
During and after the Revolutionary War there was some resentment of the ``loyalists'' who went to Canada. But the bitterness was not long lasting, and it isn't hard to understand that there should have been those for whom the tug of loyalty to the Crown transcended contemporary revolutionary ardor. The Southerner who abandoned his ``country'' (there were very few) because he did not wish to identify himself with a war the apparent purpose of which was to establish the South's right to continue to allow slavery would not, in retrospect, be thought cowardly, or disloyal, though his timing was questionable.
<P>
What about the rich American who gives up his flag in order to shield himself from taxation? 
<P>
The spastic answer is that of course such a man is to be despised. But it's also true, isn't it, that we are, as Americans, tolerant of deviant behavior? The most engaging recent example of expatriate canniness is the man who gave up his citizenship, pulled out his money, went off to live in some little island country, and persuaded the government to appoint him Ambassador to the United States. A really nifty arrangement, because now he has rejoined his family and lives in his native land, tax free. Somebody somewhere got in the way of that little maneuver, and now the question raised in Congress is how far to limit expatriates' visits to the United States. After 182 days, you become a U.S. resident for purposes of taxation; so that anyone primarily engaged in evading taxes would not expect to live more than six months a year here. But there is sentiment in Congress for limiting this time further, even drastically.
<P>
One seeks perspective. Sure, anybody ought to have the right to go anywhere to take up residence, subject of course to the right of every country to regulate immigration. The question we are considering is whether the man who undertakes alienation in order to protect his property is beneath contempt. 
<P>
Certainly that would be so if such a person left his country when it was in distress. We have read of Germans who thought it disloyal to leave when Hitler assumed power, on the grounds that their duty now was to unseat Hitler. Others, despairing of this possibility, fled to protect themselves and family. 
<P>
An American who left the country in wartime can properly be thought of as a deserter. But what about an American who decides that the property he has accumulated he wishes to retain for himself and his family? How heavily should he be punished? Should we allow him only thirty days in his ex-country? Three days? No days? 
<P>
Loyalty has always got to be contingent. The current issue of <I>First Things</I> publishes five deeply philosophical essays wondering whether loyalty has been forfeited to a government whose judiciary arrogates authority over life and death, as the Supreme Court has done in the matter of abortions, and threatens to do on euthanasia. A belief in equal treatment under the law is not frivolous; and the citizen made to pay at class-warfare rates, current or prospective, can presumably be thought of as an Andrew Carnegie in reverse. We must remember what Burke taught us, that a country to be loved must be lovely.

November 5, 1996
<P>
Dear Rusty
<P>
We win! Again! Almost. 
<P>
I'm sitting here with Tip and the kids watching the early returns -- things are looking pretty good right now. And although it's still too close to call, the phone has been ringing off the hook. 
<P>
Dick Holbrooke called to say he was rested and ready for whatever Cabinet-level foreign-policy post we might need to fill. I thanked him. 
<P>
The second call was from Dad. 
<P>
``Congratulations, my boy,'' he said over the sound of ice in a tall glass. ``Now tell me, how did all those monks get all that money?'' 
<P>
``It's complicated, Dad,'' I said. 
<P>
``You'd better hope it is, boy. You'd better hope it's too complicated for the American people to figure out, too.'' 
<P>
``Dad,'' I said, with a warning tone to my voice, ``don't start with me.'' 
<P>
``Well anyway, congratulations.'' 
<P>
``I haven't won yet, Dad. The polls are still open.''
<P>
``Not for your mother and me,'' he answered. ``We're going to bed.'' 
<P>
And then he hung up. To be honest, Rusty, I was disappointed. His favorite President will always be LBJ for, among other reasons, his incredible fundraising prowess. I thought maybe this was an area in which I could claim some small right to say, ``Look how much I raised, Daddy.'' 
<P>
It's complicated, this father-and-son business. 
<P>
Dick Holbrooke called again, to remind me that in the ``Washington Whispers'' column of U.S. News & World Report his photograph ran with the caption ``Warren Christopher's likely replacement.''
<P>
The next call was from Dick Gephardt. Tipper made me take the call in my study so she could listen in and make gagging faces. 
<P>
``Hello, Dick,'' I said. 
<P>
``Hello, Mr. Vice President,'' Dick responded. ``As you know, it isn't clear yet whether our party has regained control of the House or Senate. But if we do, I will urge the various committee chairs to stop hounding your Administration with groundless investigations.'' 
<P>
``Well, thank you, Dick.'' 
<P>
``The press will have a field day. You know, obstruction of justice, cover-up, that sort of thing. So in an effort to be evenhanded, I think we'll let one investigation go forward. Just for appearances' sake, you understand.'' 
<P>
``I guess I do, Dick,'' I said sadly. ``So which one will continue? Whitewater? Castle Grande?'' 
<P>
``Nope.'' 
<P>
``The billing records? Filegate?'' 
<P>
``Nope.'' 
<P>
``The Travel Office? John Huang?'' 
<P>
``Nope. I think we'll just focus on that Buddhist monastery. Really pick that one apart.'' 
<P>
``Gosh, Dick,'' I said. ``I was at that fund-raiser.'' 
<P>
``You were?'' he asked. ``Really? I guess I hadn't read that. Oh well.'' 
<P>
He's a curious guy, Rusty. I think some of his personal hostility to me comes from the fact that I'm much taller and have eyebrows. The rumor going around town is that he's going to run against me in '00, but I think, in the end, he won't. In fact, I think I'll run unopposed. People just can't seem to get enough of Al Gore. 
<P>
Dick Holbrooke called again, to remind me that his cholesterol was in the lowest percentile. 
<P>
Then Bill called. He was very ``up.''
<P>
``Congratulations, Mr. President,'' I said. ``Although in four years, I guess you'll be saying that to me.'' 
<P>
``Yeah, yeah. About that,'' Bill said. 
<P>
``What's up?'' I asked. I could sense concern.
<P>
``Well,'' he said, ``it's this scandal stuff. I have a feeling it might hamper our agenda.'' 
<P>
``Are you thinking about a pardon?'' I asked, with some trepidation. 
<P>
``Oh yeah,'' he said. 
<P>
``Who?'' I asked. 
<P>
``You,'' he said. 
<P>
``Me?'' I asked. ``Why would you need to pardon me?'' 
<P>
``Not me pardon you, Al. The other way around,'' Bill replied as he hung up.
<P>
Holbrooke called again to discuss his ``Grand Strategy for America in the 21st Century.'' I must have drifted off and started snoring, and he hung up rather abruptly.
<P>
It's still too early to call the election, but it's got all the earmarks of a landslide -- just like in 1972! 
<P>
Gotta run. Ken Starr is on the line. I guess he wants to congratulate me.



<p>

Your Pal, Al

Vice President Gore says he ``didn't know'' he was in a Buddhist temple when he picked up a check for $140,000. Contributions from tax-exempt organizations are illegal, so it helps not to notice the incense, saffron robes, shaved heads, and gongs when collecting from priests who have taken a vow of poverty.
<P>
<hr>
<P>
It's a story that, for the Clinton Administration, sounds quite familiar: Little Rock connections, Webster Hubbell, casual contempt for the law, Ron Brown wheelings-and-dealings. But it has a host of bizarre twists: a fundraiser held at a Buddhist temple, a multi-billion-dollar Indonesian conglomerate called the Lippo Group, a guy named Gandhi giving more than $300,000 to the Democratic National Committee. None of this tangle, already known as Indogate, will be sorted out before the election, a fact that White House spokesman Michael McCurry openly laughs about. What we do know is that almost certainly money from Indonesian sources has been laundered through Democratic coffers, and that one of the rainmakers, fundraiser John Huang, was rewarded with an influential spot in the Commerce Department; it may well be that the free-flowing Asian cash has influenced the Administration's trade and human-rights policies. However, the scandal probably is of little benefit to Bob Dole in the short term, and in the long term it will only create more pressure for misguided Perot-style campaign-finance reform. So, attention, goo-goo reformers: it doesn't matter what the law is as long as the Administration has no interest in obeying it.

Jack Kemp's aspirations were set back by his lackluster performance against Al Gore. Kemp did not clearly win a single exchange with the Vice President. He talked about growth and tax cuts, without making the case for the 15 per cent tax cut that is the centerpiece of the Dole campaign. On questions of foreign policy and American mores, he let Gore position himself to his right. Gore left the Administration wide open for an attack on its policies on race and sex preferences; Kemp fumbled. Worst of all, he seemed to accept Gore's contention that every Republican other than Kemp is a racial troglodyte. Since he doesn't believe that, why didn't he say so? Jack Kemp needs a bridge to his base.

Democrats were recruiting their congressional candidates during the dog days after the 1994 elections -- and it shows. Here are seven of the wackiest: 1) Maria Elena Milton (running against Rep. John Shadegg, Ariz.), a LaRouche Democrat who supports, ahem, ambitious infrastructure projects like a Eurasian Land Bridge (can that be what they mean by a ``bridge to the future''?); 2) Bill Yellowtail (against Rick Hill, Montana), running despite two felony convictions for knocking off a camera store and stealing $2,000 worth of equipment (hey, if he doesn't win, there's always the White House Security Office); 3) Walter Capps (Rep. Andrea Seastrand, Calif.), who at the Democratic National Convention invoked ``global leaders'' like ``Thomas Jefferson, Franklin Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy, Maya Angelou . . .''; 4) Gerald Houseman (Rep. Mark Souder, Ind.), running in a district dependent on the auto industry after serving as chairman of the Committee for Zero Automobile Growth; 5) Ron Dinicola (Rep. Phil English, Pa.), a Hollywood lawyer with a client list of sleaze balls that puts Johnnie Cochran to shame; 6) Dennis Kucinich (Rep. Martin Hoke, Ohio), whose chief credential is presiding as mayor over the default of the city of Cleveland (hmm, maybe he is qualified); 7) Kevin Quigley (Rep. Jack Metcalf, Wash.) caught laundering campaign funds (and he wasn't even working at the DNC). If all this sounds bad, just wait to see whom the Democrats have lined up for committee chairmanships . . .

``The last time I checked, the Constitution said 'of the people, by the people, and for the people.' That's what the Declaration of Independence said.'' Read it again, carefully. This was President Clinton refuting Republican ``anti-government'' views to a crowd of supporters after the debate. The last time we checked, the phrase was in Lincoln's Gettysburg Address. No wonder Mr. Clinton sneered at Mr. Dole's ``old'' ideas. He has never encountered any of them.
<P>

Be careful what you ask for. Two of California's largest companies, the electronics giant Hewlett-Packard and the mammoth HMO Kaiser Permanente, asked voters for their opinions on racial favoritism (they didn't phrase it quite like that, to be sure). Their intent in paying for the poll -- and scheduling its release for a few weeks prior to the November elections -- was apparently to slow momentum for the California Civil Rights Initiative, which would consign race and gender preferences in government programs to history's ash heap. But respondents didn't cooperate. The pollsters forsook candor for euphemism, asking for views on ``affirmative action'' rather than ``reverse discrimination,'' but those surveyed still turned thumbs down -- favoring an end to such unfairness in the private sector by 51 per cent to 36 per cent, and in government programs by 49 per cent to 40 per cent. At the same time, 76 per cent supported remedial courses to bring disadvantaged minorities up to speed, so the opposition to preferential hiring can't be caricatured as ``mean spirited.'' All in all, the results were pronounced ``very troubling'' by representatives of the two companies. It does help explain why support for CCRI, at least as of this writing, has proved impervious to every demagogic attack (and there has been no other kind) launched against it. Good sense lives, even in the state that gave us Jerry Brown, Valley Girls, the Summer of Love, Hewlett-Packard, and Kaiser Permanente.

Serious criminals have been ineligible for naturalization since 1802 -- or were, until the Clinton Administration got into the act. Early this month Rosemary Jenks of the Center for Immigration Studies gave the Senate Immigration Subcommittee documents showing that the Administration took unethical -- perhaps illegal -- steps to, in the words of one Gore aide, ``produce a million new citizens before election day.'' The White House pressured the Immigration and Naturalization Service to meet hefty ``production goals.'' INS employees rubberstamped applications, ignoring evidence of fraud on the required English and civics tests. Worse, the INS evaded or ignored the results of FBI fingerprint checks. ``One of these days,'' an INS employee complained in a memo, the INS ``is going to naturalize an axe-murderer.'' FBI and INS records show that hundreds of violent criminals have received citizenship over the last year. Maybe <I>they</I> can replace Craig Livingstone.

New York City voters will unfortunately find it necessary to repeat themselves November 5, when they will vote No on a ballot proposal softening the term limits imposed on the City Council, the mayor, and other officeholders in 1993. The original law, which imposed a two-term limit, would force New York's most limpet-like politicians out of office by 2001. But the City Council has offered a new measure that would raise the limit to three terms and restart the clock, so that many would not have to leave until 2007. The battle pits New Yorkers for Term Limits and Ronald Lauder, who favor the original measure, against Council Speaker Peter Vallone, Mayor Giuliani, and a horde of special interests that have ponied up hundreds of thousands of dollars to pass the new ``reform.'' Their ads say the city will be at a virtual standstill without the Council elders, but polls show that even liberal New Yorkers don't mind that. And if term limits can make it <I>there</I>, they can make it anywhere.

Russia's charismatic hardliner, Gen. Aleksandr Lebed, was the victim of a pre-emptive strike on October 17, when Kremlin rivals forced his ouster as Boris Yeltsin's national security advisor. It was bound to happen sooner or later; only the timing was a surprise. Lebed's rivals feared his free-wheeling diplomacy, his self-promotion, and his growing popularity. The idea of Lebed wielding power inside the Kremlin while Yeltsin was in the hospital for heart surgery seemed too dangerous. But he will be a formidable political force wherever he is. The Russian people, reeling from corruption and mafia/ nomenklatura rule, view Lebed as their potential savior. It is the classic formula for a man on horseback. The Clinton Administration's Russia policy hangs by a (surgical) thread.

God is love, and, during their upcoming conference in Zimbabwe, clergymen from the World Council of Churches want to be allowed to practice godliness on all fronts. They have persuaded Zimbabwe's president, Robert Mugabe, to relax his views on one type of love. Mugabe calls homosexuals ``worse than dogs and pigs'' and punishes homosexual acts with 12-month jail terms. While they're in Harare, though, the gays of the WCC will be free to love each other, and any willing Zimbabweans, as their Christian consciences dictate. Of course this kind of thing -- pressuring Third World nations to alter their traditional folkways to suit Western tastes -- used to be called ``cultural imperialism,'' especially by the WCC. But, ``Behold, I make all things new.''

When she was a 19-year-old student in Birmingham, England, Claire Short got pregnant out of wedlock and gave the baby up for adoption. Miss Short grew up to be a left-wing Member of Parliament. The baby grew up to be Toby Graham, a conservative lawyer who once ran for Parliament as a Tory. Recently Mr. Graham sought out his birth mother and, in a joyous moment for both mother and son, found her. On Mr. Graham's first visit to Miss Short's office, she worried that his ``posh accent'' might alarm her lefty colleagues. It didn't. Since their reunion, Tory son and Labour mom have got along beautifully. Indeed, there is something for everyone in this tale: environmentalists will note that Tory Toby was raised by a rich family; fans of <I>The Bell Curve</I> can see that a mother and son from two different worlds both show ambition, drive, and political skill. Well, for almost everyone. As Miss Short explains, at moments during her pregnancy she contemplated an abortion, but it would have been illegal, and her parents would not have consented to any abortion, legal or otherwise. How many unmarried women who unintentionally get pregnant today will experience such joyous reunions?

<P>
<FONT SIZE=+3>T</FONT><font size=+1>HE</font> year's most wooed voter waited outside the Louisville Slugger Museum on a chilly Kentucky evening three weeks before the election. In front of this monument to baseball, she sported a blue sweatshirt that declared incongruously ``Soccer Mom For Clinton.'' Still, her patience and clothing investment paid off. A delighted Bill Clinton greeted her with his biggest grin of the day as he worked the crowd following his speech. 
<P>
Clinton supporters with that kind of dedication were thin on the ground. The President with a need to be loved was encountering crowds that mainly wanted to see a celebrity. On his 17-hour campaign trip to Tennessee, Ohio, and Kentucky -- to woo, respectively, partisan Democrats, blue-collar workers, and moderate suburbanites (especially those elusive Soccer Moms) --  most voters were friendly enough. But they had apparently turned out for the meetings without any particular enthusiasm for Mr. Clinton's politics, or indeed any politics. How they went home is quite another matter -- and an alarming one for the GOP.
<P>
The press was, well, too inert to really notice. On the media plane accompanying Air Force One, White House press secretary Mike McCurry cheerfully complained that he was unable ``to raise a pulse'' from the seventy or so regular passengers. ``They just don't think it's a race,'' he explained, checking to make sure my heart wasn't pounding under the illusion that a real political fight might be under way. The seasoned Clinton-watchers balanced their checkbooks and talked baseball between stops.
<P>
Was there, indeed, a presidential race to be interested in? This campaign swing yielded little evidence of one. No local GOP forces bothered to show the flag -- an onlooker at the Knoxville airport whose cap was emblazoned ``Busch'' came near to expressing the only Republican sentiment of the long day. And though Clinton - Gore lawn signs were scattered along the motorcade route, not a single bumper sticker was evident for either ticket. Spirited opposition erupted only once, when people lining the sidewalk in Dayton booed the buses marked ``Media'' -- clearly a bipartisan sentiment.
<P> 
Joe Lockhart, the campaign's press secretary, explained to the few reporters willing to listen that the day's trip was devoted to shoring up the President's lead. And Clinton is clearly energized by the crowds he wades into -- shaking hands, hugging the people closest to him. When it comes to speaking, he calibrates his message to his audience, barely glancing at notes during lengthy, detailed speeches. Judged technically, it is the performance of a professional politician at the top of his form. But does it ``connect'' with his audiences?
<P>
At the first stop, in Knoxville, a friendly audience of partisan Democrats waited more than two hours to hear Al Gore and Bill Clinton. The candidates were there ostensibly to announce an initiative to hook up every classroom in the country to the Internet (not to mention a $100-million subsidy to Silicon Valley) -- what Lockhart calls the ``wonk stuff.'' A large banner on the stage proclaimed: ``Building America's Bridge to the Twenty-First Century.'' Gore, oddly the more animated of the two, raised his arms and waved to the crowd in his awkward schoolboy way, while Clinton merely delivered a small, curt salute.
<P>
It was Gore's job that day to slam the Luddites in the Republican Party (a bold tactic from a foe of the internal-combustion engine). He duly warned against a ``digital divide'' between the haves and the have-nots if every classroom in the country is not on the Internet. He prophesied that nearby Oak Ridge Laboratory would be closed by the Democrats' congressional ``opponents'' who had attempted to cut the science and technology budget by a third. And he reminded the audience that he first started talking about the Information Superhighway twenty years ago. (It seems longer.) In those days he had ``dreamed'' of a girl in Carthage, Tennessee, who could plug into the Library of Congress from her home. (Poor Tipper -- married to the only man for whom a girl is merely a peripheral to a computer.)
<P>
Clinton wisely stuck to computer software, but he communicated real enthusiasm for the wonders of technology. ``There is more computer power in a Ford Taurus you drive to the supermarket,'' he declared, ``than there was in Apollo 11 when Neil Armstrong took it all the way to the Moon.''
<P> 
This was no innocent fascination with applied science -- the President's point was that government deserves the credit for such advances: ``Of the 12 Americans who won the Nobel Prize last year, all 12 had received government support for their research,'' he said. His enthusiasm for technological advance was really an optimistic vision of what the future holds as long as government leads the way. ``I know that you all believe in this,'' he told his Democratic listeners, advising them to fight the current antipathy to government by having at hand ``three or four examples that people can identify with'' of how their tax dollars are being profitably used. 
<P>
He was talking to the right audience. A year ago, the party faithful in Knoxville had little to celebrate. Today they were excited by a rosy future -- not that of technology but that of the Democratic Party under Bill Clinton. They could see public-sector jobs dancing before their eyes.
<P>
It was a different audience that afternoon in Dayton, an enthusiastic blue-collar crowd with young children in tow who gathered in a small square downtown not to cheer a candidate but to see their President. When Air Force One touches down and the President's twenty-car motorcade winds through the streets, a serious kind of carnival comes to town. Sharpshooters prowl the roofs, Secret Service agents in black jumpsuits flank the stage, and ``Hail to the Chief'' heralds the main attraction. All the king's horses and all the king's men provide an excitement missing from the politics of the race.
<P>
Before this bi-partisan audience, Clinton was restrained, self-consciously ``presidential.'' He joined the local politicians on stage with his small salute for the cheering crowd. But he seemed uncomfortable in the lead role. Does he sense that he lacks something, some mysterious presidential gene, some measure of dignity that the office demands? Bill Clinton provokes such questions at regular intervals. At one moment he is all smooth self-confidence; the next moment a nervous little boy peeps out, wondering if the imposture has been detected. This could just explain the gender gap: half the women's vote has been seduced, the other half persuaded they are his mother.
<P>
That day's only mention of foreign policy is also a local reference. Clinton thanked the audience for their role in the Dayton Accords. Special mention went to a woman whose restaurant fed the Bosnian negotiators.
<P>
Having solved the Bosnian question, the President ran through the litany of good news that doubles as his record. Over the past four years 10.5 million new jobs created . . . household income up $1,600 . . . the highest home-ownership rate in 15 years . . . 1.9 million fewer people on welfare . . . the biggest drop in child poverty in twenty years . . . the lowest poverty rate among seniors ever recorded . . . the minimum wage up . . . crime rates down. As he soared to a climax, the President became the very incarnation of Progress. ``We have doubled life expectancy for people living with HIV . . . we have discovered two genes that cause breast cancer.'' Really? Bill on his own? Or Bill, Al, and Hillary? 
<P>
After this list of accomplishments, Clinton declared, ``We are better off than we were four years ago, but we've got a long way to go to build that bridge to the twenty-first century.'' The bridge metaphor is stolen from Bob Dole, and the agenda it represents stolen in part from Newt Gingrich. But these voters, applauding and impressed, have not been persuaded by Dole and Kemp that they could do better.
<P> 
During a bus trip from the airport to a rally site, one reporter tells a colleague that he hadn't been on a campaign trip in a while. ``You're not missing anything,'' he is assured. ``It's still that f --  --  bridge.'' The reporters are merely irritated by the repetition; its significance is either ignored or not grasped. This is a serious lapse -- because if Clinton wins on November 5, the bridge will be transformed into a mandate for enlarging the scope of government.
<P>
<font size=+3>L</font><font size=+1>ockhart</font> admits that the bridge metaphor suggested itself to Clinton after Dole's San Diego speech. Symptomatic of his butterfly-minded campaign, Dole dropped his ``bridge to the past,'' and with it his defense of the virtuous communities of yesteryear, as soon as questions were raised about it. But he had inadvertently provided Clinton with an effective symbol for his second term. Audiences are drawn to the imagery of a bridge that leads to an exciting new century of untold wonders. 
<P>
But they also feel an undercurrent of foreboding, which Clinton encourages. He speaks with urgency about the need to be as prepared as he is for the new millennium. Listeners are meant to conclude that without Clinton to guide them, they might be left behind in this tired old century. Of course, if his audiences were to sit idly in lawn chairs along Knoxville's Interstate 64, the new century would still come upon them. But the President inspires them to want to join him in preparing for the crossing.
<P> 
And what they must do is help him expand the reach of government. Clinton punctuates each mention of a new federal initiative with his raised fist and the plea, ``Will you help me build that bridge to the twenty-first century?'' Audiences invariably applaud.
<P>
The agenda that would usher in the new millennium in a Clinton second term includes tax breaks for education, child care, home-ownership, and health care; an expansion of the Family Leave Act; expansion of health insurance for the unemployed and ``respite benefits'' for families of Alzheimer's patients; federal support for school remodeling; tax credits for college tuition; a corps of tutors to teach reading; a ban on certain bullets; more federal cops on the beat; and Internet access in every classroom. 
<P>
All these programs are meant to appeal to the middle class, and each is modest in itself. The public refused to swallow a whole beaker of federalized health care, but recent audiences appear eager to take the small sips Clinton now offers from the federal trough. 
<P>
As yet, Republicans have not found an effective response to these tactics. Apparently fearful of the post-partum fury of millions of soccer moms, they supported the mandate that insurance companies cover 48-hour hospital stays for mothers and babies after normal deliveries. (When this soccer mom's fingers had to be pried off the bedpost for me to be sent home three days after the birth of my youngest son, it didn't occur to me that my pique should be of concern to the Federal Government.)
<P>
A ragtime band played for the expectant suburban crowd that waited for the President in downtown Louisville. Mike McCurry explained that Clinton was hoping to help freshman Congressman Mike Ward, who is in a tough re-election fight. And the campaign provided him with a pleasant local backdrop for doing so. A 120-foot Louisville Slugger bat stood behind the President as he sat through the local politicians' exploitation of all the obvious metaphors. ``We have 26 'Clinton cops' on our streets because the President went to bat for us,'' declared Louisville's mayor. The President was being invited to hit his message out of the ballpark.
<P>
But in front of the suburbanites he is coolly winning over, Clinton risked no partisan appeal. He implausibly noted the remarkable ``influence'' that Ward had wielded in his one term, but noticeably refrained from a pitch for a Democratic House. The Democratic challenger to Senator Mitch McConnell was praised as a ``fine man,'' but the balance of power in the Senate went unmentioned. It was above-the-battle, soothingly presidential, not about politics at all.
<P> 
And Clinton didn't make the typical liberal case for the welfare state, but rather explained how the Federal Government can step in to reduce the tensions and inconveniences of everyday middle-class life. This notion of a family-friendly Federal Government went down well with this audience.
<P>
A relaxed Mike McCurry stood in the evening chill watching the cheering crowd. He expressed surprise that he had enjoyed such a quiet day just three weeks before the election. Bob Dole, campaigning with Colin Powell in Ohio, had simply not been heard from. ``We had expected an attack on our foreign-policy record, or on ethics, something like 'I'd have people of Colin Powell's caliber in my Cabinet.' But nothing,'' he marveled.
<P> 
The secret of this campaign is that under the guise of non-partisan presidential appearances, politics <I>is</I> going on. As he coasts to re-election, Bill Clinton is fashioning a new Democratic coalition. The partisan liberals who welcomed him to Knoxville are energized by the prospect of victory -- while Dayton's blue-collar voters and Louisville's suburbanites are seduced into increasing their dependence on a government that responds to their ``needs'' one at a time. 
The GOP comforts itself that over 60 per cent of the public believes ``the Federal Government is too big and does too much.'' But how much does that matter when the President is putting in 17-hour days to make that belief a pious irrelevancy -- as irrelevant as his admission that ``the era of Big Government is over''? 
Too many Republicans have convinced themselves that a Clinton victory will be merely an interregnum between idea-fuelled GOP victories in 1994 and 1998. But if Bill Clinton builds a new coalition that includes suburban voters, the GOP will discover that ideas are not everything. Coalitions too have consequences.

<H2>A Question of Character?</H2></CENTER>
<HR>
<P>
NEW YORK, OCTOBER 4<br>
In anticipation of the debate, the focus was hard on the presidential contest. What surprises is the universality of comments and even jokes at the expense of Mr. Clinton. A prominent Canadian publisher was saying last summer, ``Most Americans are non-ideological. When all is said and done, they're not going to vote for Clinton against Dole.'' But of course if that were true, why are these non-ideological voters having the pollsters on? If they are disgusted with Clinton because among other things he lies, how do they excuse their own lying to the pollsters?
<P>
Another publisher whispered the joke going the rounds, that Mr. Clinton would turn out to be the first president whose wife made his license plates. The Speaker of the House brandished a $20 bill at a private dinner hosted by Rush Limbaugh. ``Here it is -- that Dole will win.'' ``Aren't you asking for odds'' the taker asked. ``No odds. Even money.''
<P>
There is much buzz about town over the editorial in the weekly <I>New York Observer</I>, a highbrow leftist inner-New York concentrate of political and social passions. It is the creature of Arthur Carter, an engaged multi-millionaire who gets his kicks from opinion, so much so that for quite a few years he owned The Nation magazine, which is where the Bureau of Weights and Measures visits to define hard-left.
<P>
Well, Mr. Carter astonished his audience by running a front-page editorial in the current issue headlined ``Bob Dole, the Right Choice in '96!/A Vote for Character Over Sleaze.'' The editorial goes through the necessary disavowals (``the religious right and the right-to-lifers are wild-eyed fanatics who threaten our hard-won liberties'' to conceive children and then kill them) but quickly comes to the point. ``In this election year, character is not merely one of several issues demanding our attention. It is the only issue. That makes our decision easier. Bob Dole has character, and Bill Clinton has none. So Bob Dole is our choice.''
<P>
The cosmopolitan editor then lets loose. ``We have been embarrassed for nearly four years. We have suffered too long the sins of those yahoos Mr. Clinton transported from Arkansas, so many of whom seem to have spent the entire term answering prosecutors' questions . . . Instead of a role model, we have a floozy who will consort with anyone if it means a bump in the popularity polls . . . His governing style is a product of his generation's self-indulgence and Little Rock's loose political morals. He knows nothing of sacrifice and little of the real world, for he has been talking, and talking, and talking, for the last quarter-century. Historians will one day note that in 1996, the oldest Presidential nominee in U.S. history was a man of action, while one of the youngest incumbents was a sedentary yapper . . . We used to ask our Presidents about great issues of war and peace. We ask President Clinton about his underwear. Worse, he gives us an answer . . . [Hillary is just as bad] Now we have a chance to rid ourselves of both. A perfect twofer.''
<P>
In anticipation of Sunday's debate, much time was given over to advising Sen. Dole. James Carville, the Democratic strategist and overseer of Mr. Clinton's 1992 campaign, was amiable enough to give the other side some advice in <I>Newsweek</I>. He stressed the need for Bob Dole to appear as the underdog, not the loser. And he admonished him not to go after Mr. Clinton personally. ``You know he's going to come back smiling. It'll only feed into the worst perceptions of you (that you're mean-spirited) and best perceptions of him (that he can take a punch).'' Robert Novak advised the candidate to stress Dole's advocacy of a tax cut. The Speaker likes to point out that the average family should reflect that at the end of the first Dole year in office, it would pay $1,300 less to Internal Revenue than under Clinton one more time. The gains would be not only material but political, forcing the shrinkage of a government groaning with the bureaucratic burden.
<P>
Yes, but it isn't easy to get into the ring and draw attention to your fine character, as distinguished from the base character of your opponent. Mr. Carville, in his friendly piece, added, ``Another thing: Don't mention your war wound more than twice. Understand that your injury entitles you to the gratitude and respect of the nation. But not a vote for president.''
<P>
Well, we'll soon see. A lot rides on it, including twenty of Newt's dollars.

White House aides are split over the issue of pardons for Whitewater felons. Some want them announced at the beginning of President Clinton's inaugural address, while others think they should wait until the end.
<P>
<hr>
<P>


Among the Clinton Administration's lucky breaks this year is the timing of investigations into its misconduct: no Whitewater- or Travelgate-related indictments before November, and now no serious second look into Filegate either. In a recent sworn deposition to the Senate Judiciary Committee, Mari Anderson, assistant to Georgetown bouncer <I>cum</I> White House security chief Craig Livingstone, says that contrary to their sworn testimony, Livingstone and other security-office employees knew all along that they were improperly obtaining the files of former GOP officials. She also sheds light on a mysterious six-month gap in a log recording when FBI files were removed from the security office: Livingstone et al. have suggested that the log just wasn't kept during this period, but Miss Anderson says it was, raising the possibility it was removed as part of a cover-up. (Can you say ``18-minute gap''?) Incredibly, Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch agreed to hold no more hearings on the matter before the election in order to win Democratic cooperation on a parks bill. See you next year.

``Give Bill a second term,'' said Hillary Rodham Clinton at a Democratic fund-raiser, ``and Al Gore and I will be turned loose to do what we really want to do.'' <I>Now</I> will you get busy and work for Dole?

Is it still the economy, stupid? Bill Clinton says so. But in an illuminating cover story in the October 7 <I>Forbes</I> magazine, <I>NR</I>'s Peter Brimelow and Ed Rubenstein examine problems in the current cyclical recovery that Clinton doesn't talk about. For one thing, the recovery is much weaker than the three preceding ones: an expansion of only about 13 per cent since it began (under George Bush, let the record show). And this recovery is now so old that a recession in the next presidential term is almost a statistical certainty. The federal deficit, about 2 per cent of GDP in 1996, is down, as it was at this point in the 1983 - 90 upswing. But that is because defense spending has collapsed (3.6 per cent of GDP today, down from 5 per cent in 1992) and because the Federal Government's tax take (19.4 per cent of GDP, up from 18.4) has risen to a level unprecedented in peacetime. Indeed, counting state and local taxes -- increased largely because of Washington's new habit of mandating programs -- Americans are paying more in taxes than at the height of World War II. Ironically, the bugaboos of the Reagan recovery -- federal borrowing, especially from foreigners; income inequality -- are actually worse under Clinton. Bottom line: Personal income has stagnated throughout the Clinton years. And it seems likely that per capita disposable income in the four quarters prior to the election will turn out to be below its long-term 2.1 per cent growth trend, despite an above-expectations 1996 so far. Since 1952 no incumbent party has held the White House with such wan numbers. This economy would not be a political problem -- for an aggressive opponent.

What Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Gore ``really want to do'' is alarming to contemplate. Can you imagine Health Care Reform for every tree, bird, beast, and bug on the planet?

Under pressure from the Department of Education's Civil Rights office to boost girls' scores on the PSAT, the College Board announced that it would add a multiple-choice section on writing and language structure to the test. It has long been known that boys do better than girls on standardized tests, particularly on the math sections. (On the PSAT math section last year, boys averaged 50.8, on a scale of 20 to 80, compared to the girls' average of 47.4. On the verbal section the scores were 48.8 for boys, 48.6 for girls.) This is a ``problem'' because these tests play a large role in determining National Merit Scholarships, and as a result boys have an ``unfair'' advantage in the competition for these awards. The ``solution'' is to de-emphasize the math section. This is already accomplished by counting the verbal score twice in the Merit selection process; the new verbal section will further decrease the importance of a high math score. Women's groups, such as the Women's Rights Project, justify such tampering on the grounds that the tests <I>must</I> be ``biased'' against girls, since girls tend to receive slightly higher grades than boys in both high school and college. However, it seems more likely that any bias resides in the grades, which are subjectively awarded, than in the tests, which are scored by a machine. If we want to award equal numbers of scholarships to boys and girls, fine: make that the policy (keeping in mind that to do so tarnishes the actual achievements of girls). But stop pretending that these tests are standardized and these scholarships are based on merit.

A man wearing a Bob Dole mask and a ``really ugly yellow tie'' robbed a bank in Wheaton, Illinois, and, as he left, reminded everyone to vote. Mr. D.

Sen. John Kerry (D., Mass.) is a standard-issue down-the-line liberal. His opponent, Republican Gov. William Weld, styles himself an economic conservative and a social liberal. That's half true. Weld supports every item on the agenda of left-wing homosexual activists. But state spending has increased in his tenure and income-tax rates remain essentially at Dukakis levels. Weld favors discrimination against white males, environmental regulation, and industrial policy. He would provide crucial reinforcement for the dwindling ranks of liberal Republicans in the Senate. Worse, he is smart and affable; in the old boys' club of the Senate, he would tug the Republican caucus to the Left, damaging conservative causes far more than a re-elected Kerry. It's quite a dilemma. Weld's appalling rush to defend President Clinton for vetoing the partial-birth-abortion ban, however, tips the scale. To oppose first-trimester abortions requires an act of intellection which not all well-meaning people will make; to approve killing a baby in the process of being born indicates a deep failure of moral sentiment. Under the circumstances, we must urge conservatives to cast their votes for Conservative Party candidate Susan Gallagher.

California Attorney General Dan Lungren, an attractive young GOP figure, has been kicking up his heels. In August, he raided the San Francisco Cannabis Buyers Club -- which sells marijuana to people suffering from cancer, AIDS, and glaucoma -- on the grounds that pot-heads were getting it for recreational use (the Cannabis Buyers Club disputes the charge). This month, when characters in <I>Doonesbury</I> lamented the move, Lungren urged California newspapers to cancel the strip, saying it would ``lend credibility'' to Proposition 215 -- a referendum to legalize medical marijuana. We say Mr. Lungren loses credibility by fighting the drug war on its least defensible front. Will he ask California newsstands not to carry this issue?

In response to the new law restricting welfare for immigrants, George Soros, the Hungarian-born money manager, has announced that he will put up $50 million to start the Emma Lazarus Fund, which will aid legal immigrants by financing their citizenship applications and efforts to learn English. We applaud Mr. Soros's initiative. Appropriately, he is using his own money -- there was no welfare in Emma Lazarus's day -- and that money will (reportedly) go to immigrants themselves, rather than to professional lobbyists using immigrants to extort money from ordinary Americans, as is notoriously the case with Ford Foundation grants. But Mr. Soros must not stop here. In fairness, he should finance another fund to aid native-born Americans facing lower wages, job displacement, overcrowded schools, and the cost of relocation from their overwhelmed communities. He could even name it after someone who is being phased out of the American pantheon to make room for new heroes and heroines like Emma Lazarus -- someone who thought America did not need immigrants at all except perhaps for a few ``useful mechanics'' -- old whatshisname -- we've got it! -- George Washington.

The Afghan Taliban are getting a bad press in the West but, in fact, their rule could prove quite popular if they conquered Washington, D.C., as well as Kabul. True, some aspects of their Islamic political correctness might raise an eyebrow or two. For example, not everyone would enjoy having to grow a beard. Not everyone would gladly rise before dawn for the first of five daily prayers. The Taliban's encouraging women to stay (literally) at home might also be considered in some quarters to be a little over the top. But there would be compensations. The Taliban have banned television, music, and co-ed public transportation. In other words, three scourges of modern life -- mindless TV junk, the cacophony which passes for music these days, and overcrowded public transport -- would be eliminated at one bold stroke. Washington in particular would also benefit from the Taliban's crime-fighting tactics. After the first few hundred thieves started walking about the city without right hands, our crime rate would surely drop too. Most importantly, the Taliban would reduce inflationary pressures that might be building up again. A Kabul butcher who tried to sell his products above the official price had two of his fingers chopped off, which, while not monetarist in spirit, should surely be acclaimed by the bond market for anti-inflationary zeal. After the latest developments in Kabul, who can now say that the Clinton Administration, which has made friendly overtures toward the Taliban, supports only liberal causes?

As the house organ of the international New Class, fiscally conservative but socially liberal, <I>The Economist</I> has long felt highly modified rapture toward Margaret Thatcher. All the more significant, therefore, is its considered judgment on the balance-sheet of Thatcherism in a recent survey of Britain's new politics. After scrupulously examining the economic statistics on growth, productivity, and much else (and dispelling scores of much-loved left-wing myths in the process), it concludes: ``Until about 1979, Britain's economic decline relative to other countries was precipitous; since then, the decline has been arrested, and there are now signs that Britain is improving its position. If so, no other British government in modern times can claim as much.'' Within this broad conclusion, it cites dramatic achievements for the Iron Lady in labor-market reforms, privatization (in 1979 the cost of state support for nationalized industries ``was equivalent to e300 [$480] a year for every taxpayer. The privatized companies now . . . pay taxes on profits that amount to e100 [$160] a year for every taxpayer''), and competitiveness (in the 1980s, ``of Europe's ten most successful firms, seven were British''). All in all, the <I>Economist</I> survey reads like a British equivalent of NR's own ``The Real Reagan Record.'' But perhaps Mrs. Thatcher's greatest achievement is the modern Labour Party, which, under the shrewd leadership of Tony Blair, denounces her policies but promises not to reverse them.

The following letter to the editor appeared in the <I>New York Times</I>. We reprint it, admiringly. ``Congratulations for giving voice to the victims of the latest assault on the women of America ('Harassment in 2nd Grade? Queens Kisser Is Pardoned,' front page, Oct. 3). Reported incidents of second-grade kissing, the nation's most underreported crime, have doubled in the last week alone. Furthermore, studies have shown that most second-grade kissing occurs during recess, thereby detracting from the quality of the milk-and-cookies experience. As a result, many schoolgirl victims go on to develop anorexia and are therefore unable to protect themselves when they receive the traditional Super Bowl beating. For too long the tragedy of second-grade kissing has been ignored by the political and educational power structure. Careful research has shown that if boys kiss girls in the second grade, they will kiss them again in the future. Clearly these are not isolated incidents; they form a pattern. It is the pattern of a serial kisser. There is still time before the November elections for the presidential candidates to present their plans for dealing with this horror before more lives are ruined, so that we can go back to the important work of building on the successes of our public school system.

The skeleton of a 9,300-year-old white guy has been unearthed at Kennewick, Washington, supporting a theory that Europeans crossed the Siberian land bridge around the same time Indians did -- or, who knows? maybe before. What happened to these white Native Americans at the hands of their red-skinned neighbors remains unclear, but the word ``genocide'' comes to mind. A committee of Shriners and Rotarians, acting as the modern-day descendants of the prehistoric white tribes, should draw up a list of demands, including reparations plus 9,300 years of interest, casino rights, and any ancient loafers or martini shakers that turn up.

Union, N.J.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+3>I</FONT><font size=+1>T'S</font> a sparse crowd at the Dole -  Kemp rally in Union, N.J., on this morning, the first cold snap of the season. I'm standing next to Buttman, wondering if I can bum a cigarette off him. The chill hasn't cooled Jack Kemp's ardor; his only concession to it is to promise a brief speech, which he accomplishes not by abbreviating his remarks but by talking even faster than usual. America is ``on the eve of the twenty-first century, a new millennium'' which will see ``a rebirth of freedom,'' ``an economic and social renaissance.''
<P>
When it comes to rebirth, Kemp knows whereof he speaks: his own political career has only recently emerged from a deep freeze. After 1992 he became the front-runner for presidential nomination. But in the intervening years Kemp lost a lot of support from party leaders, who tired of his indiscipline, and from conservative activists and intellectuals, who complained about his apostasies on labor, on spending, on immigration. The first group has been pleasantly surprised by the discipline Kemp has exhibited on the campaign trail. He has moved rightward on affirmative action and state benefits for illegal immigrants; his violent opposition to school choice during his 1988 presidential campaign is a distant memory. Otherwise, he has done little to appease his conservative critics.
<P>
Distant galaxies can receive light from dead stars. There is still an enormous reservoir of good will toward Kemp among rank-and-file Republicans. Republicans like having a spokesman who can't be trashed as mean-spirited or bigoted. When Kemp's selection was announced in Russell, Kan., he said, ``Bob and I are going to be asking for the support of every single American from the boroughs of New York to the barrios of California. . . . No one will be left behind and no one will be turned away.'' They're such simple little words, it's a wonder so few Republicans have the wit to say them.
<P>
In Union, Kemp said, ``This country has a great philosophy in both Jewish and Christian tradition that you do not leave the wounded behind, that you do not leave the weak behind, that you do not leave the elderly behind, that you do not leave the unborn behind.'' And then he segued into a defense of legal immigration. What links Kemp's positions on immigration, abortion, and economics is the view that people are potential assets, not liabilities. Whether or not he's right on the particulars, it's an appealing mindset and a compelling vision.
<P>
Kemp displays an unfailing dignity and civility, even when dealing with truly obnoxious protestors. (Such as the ones whose cries of ``Chicano power!'' were drowning out his wife's talk in her hometown of Fillmore, California.) He insists that Bill Clinton and Al Gore are ``our opponents, not our enemies.'' FDR, JFK, Hubert Humphrey: Kemp conjures up more dead liberals than the First Lady. At his best, this irenicism elevates politics. But it can easily degenerate into the Rodney King school of conservatism (``Can't we all just get along?''). He won't ``go negative'': he told the <I>Today</I> show, ``Nobody can tell me to do something I cannot do.'' The traditional metaphor for politics has been warfare, not football. (No, fans, they're not the same thing.) But the notion of politics as civil combat is lost on Kemp.
<P>
Kemp's stump speech includes the line, ``Out of many we must become one.'' Taken seriously, as a hardheaded project rather than an airy sentiment, that ambition would require rigorous thought and action. Is Kemp willing to act on the implications? He has been notably unhelpful to the California Civil Rights Initiative for the repeal of race and gender preferences, offering lukewarm support coupled with stern warnings not to ``tear up the state of California.'' Ward Connerly, chairman of the campaign for CCRI, notes that the civil-rights movement of the Fifties and Sixties was also ``divisive'' (which doesn't stop Kemp from chiding conservatives for having been on the wrong side).
<P>
One can sometimes detect a whiff of racial condescension in Kemp's rhetoric. Take his praise, however qualified, for Louis Farrakhan: it's impossible to imagine him speaking similarly about a white bigot who supported ``family values.'' (To judge from his speech in Union, Kemp may share Farrakhan's fascination with numerology: ``Four children, and 11 grandchildren, which adds up to 15, and I wore 15, and that's the size of the tax cut you will get.'') Yet there is a rough equality to his condescension: it embraces black and white alike. His pose as <I>the</I> racially enlightened Republican can exasperate his allies.
<P>
<font size=+3>N</font><font size=+1>OTABLY</font> absent from Kemp's rhetoric is any tragic sense of life, any sense of evil -- which is another way of saying that he lacks a conservative sensibility. He told the crowd in Union, ``That's what it means to be an American: to have nothing stand in your way, no barriers.'' Fr. Richard John Neuhaus, editor of the religious conservative journal <I>First Things</I>, finds in Kemp's politics traces of Christian Science, the faith of his youth, with its emphasis on the positive disposition of the will rather than on Original Sin. ``Jack's a throwback -- and I mean that in a positive and complimentary sense -- to a strain of can-do Americanism that believes that there is an answer to every problem, and that the answer is basically in the human will and the human mind.'' So, for Kemp, sustaining a free society is easy. All capitalism takes is access to capital; the inner city will bloom once we crack down on redlining. And faster economic growth is an adequate substitute for welfare reform.
<P>
Yet the standard charge that Kemp is too economistic -- that, as Pat Buchanan says, he believes in <I>Homo economicus</I> -- isn't entirely true. ``He's way ahead of the pack of other politicians in his understanding of religion and public life,'' says Neuhaus. His thoughtful speech on that subject at this year's Christian Coalition conference has won him (and its drafter, Mike Gerson) plaudits. More than any other public figure besides William Bennett, Kemp talks about the importance of the ``mediating structures'' of church, family, and civic groups. Within the Dole campaign, Kemp has been pushing for more attention on the horror of partial-birth abortion.
<P>
Kemp's intellect, too, gets unfairly knocked behind the closed doors of Republican insiders. True, he has the rough edges and ungainly enthusiasms of the self-taught, and he heeds to the sometimes-eccentric counsel of Jude Wanniski. But, as James Pinkerton points out, ``Kemp was smart enough to identify the single biggest intellectual movement to hit the Republican Party in the last half-century, which was the supply-side movement, and lead it.'' Supply-sider Alan Reynolds says, ``I think Jack is a little more serious than people give him credit for being. This isn't to say that he can handle every possible criticism -- he can handle most of them -- or that he can't be led astray by an argument that sounds good on the face of it but really isn't.'' He was the only major politician to provide a largely accurate critique of the Mexican devaluation and bailout of late 1994, and he appears to have arrived at it on his own.
<P>
His campaign does, however, leave him open to the charge of self-indulgence. His ostentatious refusal to go negative -- the normal job of a vice-presidential nominee -- is one example. Another is his disinclination to talk about the centerpiece of Dole's platform, the 15 per cent tax cut: instead of quantifying its benefits, Kemp mentions it as ``a down payment'' on radical tax reform (reviving an argument he lost, and probably deserved to lose, within the campaign). And then there's Kemp's failure, novel in his career, to court Reagan Democrats. One former Kemp staffer says, ``What I hear everywhere I go is, When are they going to unleash Kemp? Where's Jack?'' The answer: He's at the New Jersey Black Issues Convention in New Brunswick, a resolutely liberal gathering. Or he's in Harlem, or somewhere else where the Republican ticket won't win many votes. These visits may be reassuring to moderate suburbanites. Still, says longtime Kemp advisor Lawrence Kudlow, ``He needs to hang out with more football fans in near-in suburbs of Pittsburgh and Detroit and places like that where this election will be won or lost.''
<P>
Neither Kemp nor Dole has ever won a campaign involving a large, competitive electorate. This year probably won't change that record. Regardless, Kemp will still have a claim on conservative attentions. David Frum, who critiqued Kemp vigorously in <I>Dead Right</I>, says that Kemp is ``an old flame'' for conservatives: when he reappears after some years, they remember his attractions and forget what made him so impossible. Both traits were on display at the Black Issues Convention. In the midst of his rambling peroration, he declared, ``This is the <I>most</I> . . . <I>exciting</I> . . . <I>world</I> . . . <I>in history</I>'' -- raising, not for the first time, the question of what planet he is living on. Wherever it is, no doubt it's an inviting place.

<H2>Restlessness Abroad</H2></CENTER>

<HR>
<P>
NEW YORK, SEPTEMBER 27<br>







The man on my right was Mr. Civic-Minded Citizen, and soon conversation closed in on the problem of education. In his hometown of Midland, Texas, he told me, the black population is about 5 per cent. But some years ago a federal judge ordered busing in an attempt to bring about integration by the checkerboard approach. What happened, he says, is that in grades 1, 2, and 3, Midland children do exactly as well as their peers elsewhere. ``But when they get to fourth grade, they are moved into a pool,'' from which the individual student is sent to this school or that, designed to effect what in the Sixties was called ``scatteration.'' From that point on through the rest of their primary education their academic achievements move down. Why? ``Because they are separated from the children they have been associated with, their teachers are mostly concerned with goals other than education. Anyway'' -- his hands moved up, resignedly, ``that's what happened.'' Was there no way to placate the judge with another plan that retained the neighborhood school and effected integration? ``Nothing we've come up with.''
<P>
Elsewhere, the education issue focuses strongly on ``Catholic schools.'' The term is in quotation marks because the Catholic schools under consideration are hardly seminaries designed to introduce young students to recent papal encyclicals. The schools in question -- in New York, in Washington, D.C., in Milwaukee -- aren't restricted to Catholic students. One high school in New York, with which I am familiar, is preponderantly black and Hispanic, its students primarily from single-parent households. One course in religion is taught, as one might expect. It has never been asserted about the school that it is primarily a religious institution. But in order to attend it, students' families, or friends, have to come up with $3,000. The cost per student in the public schools is $9,000. In the public schools, 15 per cent or fewer of the graduates go on to college. In the Catholic schools, the figure is 85 per cent.
<P>
Mr. William Bulger, formerly the undeniable boss of the city of Boston, and president of the Massachusetts Senate for almost 18 years, fought hard against the ideological bureaucracy, whose militant right hand has been the <I>Boston Globe</I>. In his book, <I>While the Music Lasts: My Life in Politics</I>, Mr. Bulger, now a professor at the University of Massachusetts, recalls the havoc brought on by the grandees of social architecture whose first (and only) mandate has been integration. But a side interest, fanatical in other quarters, has been a reading of the First Amendment that tells us that it is unconstitutional to ``use public money'' for ``religious schools.'' The teachers' unions are mobilized on the issue, and, as with busing, nothing very much happens except illiteracy, which prospers.
<P>
On another bent, a street-wise Democratic office-holder spoke about what one might expect from President Clinton in Term Two. ``Of course, he will do something about Medicare expenses. Why? Because he has to.'' Indeed. Unless by the year 2001 somebody invents a pill that abolishes every affliction from aneurysms to whooping cough, permitting Americans at an agreeable old age to wake up dead one morning, we are heading for an unbearable fiscal problem. My acquaintance reminded me that Mr. Fiscal is greatly profiting from the Depression of the Thirties. How so? Well, Americans walking into the retirement ages of 62 - 65 aren't very numerous, because back in 1931 - 34 Americans were not having many children. But as morale mounted, in mid-decade, the birth rate rose. Its effects will be felt at the end of the century. 
<P>
It is sad, really, that no major political candidate is facing these issues head on. A successful Catholic school is no more offensive to general social objectives than a Catholic hospital that has crosses in patients' rooms. Under-educated black children are not benefited by under-educated white children. A slight stall in public spending on Medicare and Social Security does not make the looming crisis disappear. But our democratic system tends not to give us the major issues to confront. What if Mr. Dole had said that the Medicare program simply had to be rewired; that if the Constitution is really telling us that busing is required and religious schools are ineligible for public support, then let's revise the First Amendment, to make it mean what we lived with quite comfortably for a hundred and fifty years.
<P>
What a rush such proposals would bring to Inert America. And if this time around he failed, Mr. Dole would have the satisfaction felt by Winston Churchill, the first few times around.

Dear Rusty
<P>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------->


<BR>
<BR>
<P>







We win!!
<P>
Well, almost. Bill had a terrific first debate with Bob Dole. ``Four years ago, you took me on faith. Now, there's a record.'' Pretty good, huh? 
<P>
So now it's up to me to give Jack Kemp the old Gore one-two, and let me tell you, I am raring to go! I've spent the past few days boning up on Kemp's record, and I am prepared to play hardball. I'm not proud of it, but I do understand the essential role of the Vice President, which is, besides preparing to run for President myself, to get tough on the opposition. 
<P>
``If you liked Ronald Reagan, you'll love Jack Kemp!'' How's that for withering? And trust me, there's more where that came from.
<P> 
I'm sitting in the green room right now, Rusty, waiting for the red light to go on and for the debate to begin. And I'll be honest with you: I'm not at all nervous. I banished Tipper from the room a few minutes ago -- she was pretty helpful getting me ready for tonight, but I got tired of hearing her ask me every five minutes to ``do the Macarena one more time.'' I mean, I'm no show-business expert -- although I believe that Bill Clinton and I have contributed significantly to reducing the amount of violence that reaches our children through television, and we've been highly active in preparing our nation for the future of telecommunications (How does that sound? Too stiff? Let me know) -- but my understanding of show business is that you always leave them wanting more. So no, I don't plan to ``do the Macarena'' again, no matter how much Tipper asks.
<P>
In a way, Rusty, tonight is just a warm-up. Let's be honest: Bill and I are cruising to victory in November. After that, it's basically four years of prosperity, a couple of cold days in Iowa and New Hampshire, and then it's me and Jack Kemp, back again behind a couple of lecterns. 
<P>
So, tonight, I have to establish my strength. Let me give you a sample of my battle plan: 
<P>
If Kemp talks about his nutty tax-cut idea, my response is going to be: ``As I cradled my dying sister in my arms, held her for the last time, as the tears streamed down her cheeks, mingled with mine, she looked up into my eyes and said, 'Al, promise me that you won't take the country back to the supply-side Reagan Eighties, which gave tax cuts to the rich and ballooned the deficit, saddled our children with debt and widened the gap between rich and poor.''' 
<P>
If Kemp talks about the environment, my response is going to be: ``As my son, bleeding and unconscious, lay in the street -- I could hear the sirens wail as the ambulance drew near, and Tipper was silently praying -- and I noticed that his little body was slumped against a storm drain, a drain that empties directly into the ocean, I made a silent vow that I would do everything in my power to clean up the environment.''
<P>
If Kemp makes a comment about drug use going up, my response is going to be: ``When my daughter -- whom I love more than anything -- ate ice cream too quickly, she suffered from a tremendous headache. And as she clutched at her head, exclaiming loudly at the pain, Tipper and I both put down our spoons, looked at each other, and made a solemn vow to fight this deadly scourge that afflicts our children.'' 
<P>
If he brings up Bosnia or Haiti: ``My father, who was himself a senator from Tennessee, is almost ninety years old. He won't live very long. Even now, he sometimes has trouble remembering which of my daughters is which. He calls Tipper 'Flipper' occasionally. He's a prime stroke candidate, and to be honest, if the phone rang right now with the news that he had had a nasty fall in the bathroom, well, I wouldn't be surprised. But even in his somewhat addled state, he knows that our policy in Haiti has brought some stability to that troubled island nation, and that our actions in Bosnia, while they do involve the massive deployment of American military personnel, are necessary, and anyone who doubts this is insulting his life's work and smearing his memory, even though he isn't dead yet. But he will be soon. And when he is, I'll make a solemn vow.'' (I think that one needs a little work, so I'm hoping that Kemp steers clear of foreign policy.)
<P>
On welfare reform: ``This morning Tipper noticed a milky discharge from her left eye. We think it could be serious. I'm very worried. She's been sluggish and run down lately. The doctors don't give her much chance of recovery.'' 
<P>
On Bill's character: ``I have a lump in my breast. Male breast cancer is rare and very deadly.'' 
<P>
Talk about rapid response! On to victory! 
<P>
See you at Inaugural II!

Democrats led by Rep. David Bonior (D., Mich.) are demanding that the House Ethics Committee waive its usual procedures and immediately release a preliminary fact-finding report in which the committee's outside counsel purportedly discusses the use of tax-deductible funds to support a history course Newt Gingrich taught in Georgia. Under committee rules, ethics complaints cannot be filed within sixty days of a general election, so as to avoid the very politicizing Bonior et al. are attempting here. Almost all Bonior's many ethics complaints about Gingrich have been dismissed or found to be minor or technical infractions. The Ethics Committee should not release its final report until it's ready. Meanwhile, it should commission one on the allegations of bank fraud, tax fraud, and financial-disclosure fraud wafting around Minority Leader Richard Gephardt.

Dick Morris wasn't on the cover for once, so in case you didn't automatically reach for the <I>Star</I> this week, you missed: DICK MORRIS PLOTTED GAY SMEAR ON JACK KEMP. ``President Clinton's disgraced political guru Dick Morris revealed over pillow talk with Sherry Rowlands that Democratic operatives were running a dirty-tricks campaign against Bob Dole and Jack Kemp. . . . The sleazy tactics by Clinton's top political strategist are the latest bombshells in Rowlands's diaries of her year-long kinky sex-for-cash affair with Morris.''

In just the last two weeks, 6,000 people in Houston, 10,000 in Dallas, and almost 15,000 in San Jose have taken the oath of citizenship. In Chicago, an estimated 70,000 new citizens have been minted in 1996. The country has opened its arms to nearly 1.3 million new Americans this year -- nearly triple the 450,000 welcomed in 1995, which itself was an all-time record, the previous high having been set in 1944. The Administration maintains that the mass swearings-in were designed to eliminate the backlog of applicants who became eligible for citizenship in 1994 by establishing legal residency under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. But only 600,000 applicants were trapped in the INS bureaucracy. In fact, the $77-million program called Citizenship U.S.A. is a Democratic campaign operation. According to Immigration and Naturalization Service records, local Democratic politicians and community groups were charged with shepherding applicants to the INS, where they would receive accelerated treatment. Background checks for police records have been sloppily performed, fingerprinting has been assigned to untrained volunteers, English-language tests have been administered in Spanish, and green cards (with a street value of nearly $30,000) have not been collected after new citizens take the oath. The House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight is now investigating how many unqualified applicants slipped through the system. What about the unqualified citizens responsible for this affront to our laws and our society?

Remember the ban on HIV-positive immigrants? In 1992, Bill Clinton, trolling for gay votes, announced he would lift it if elected. In 1993, Congress replied by enacting the ban into law -- and Clinton, reversing himself, signed the bill. Now Paul Mulshine, an enterprising columnist for the <I>Newark Star-Ledger</I>, has discovered that Clinton has quietly reversed himself again. This summer, the Administration told the Presidential Advisory Council on HIV - AIDS that infection with the virus is to be considered a ``characteristic'' that makes the victim eligible for political asylum. Already, an HIV-positive illegal alien has won asylum partly by claiming that there is no medical treatment for AIDS in Togo. ``The Clinton Administration has in this instance outdone itself,'' comments Mulshine. ``[It] took a law that made HIV-positive status a bar to immigration, inserted it into the intellectual meat grinder and produced a ruling that makes HIV-positive a bonus.'' Over to you, Mr. Dole.

Since Jack Kemp will be around for several election cycles to come, what he said about Louis Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam should be tacked firmly into place. Kemp has made it his mission to bring the GOP to blacks. A million men is a bigger crowd than any other leader, black or white, could summon. Even in his original <I>Boston Globe</I> interview, Kemp began by placing his remarks in a general context: ``In the black community, more and more black church leaders are telling men to be responsible fathers.'' Perhaps the most naive thing Kemp said was his subsequent backtracking call on Farrakhan to renounce bigotry. Of course Farrakhan won't renounce bigotry -- it is integral to his faith (which holds that whites are demons bred in prehistoric times on the island of Patmos). Kemp will show the greatest respect for blacks by giving them his message straight up -- and since he won't be invited to any Million Man Marches, he'll have to keep doing it one man at a time.

When Bill Clinton vetoed the partial-birth-abortion ban last spring, he argued that the procedure is necessary to protect the health of expecting mothers in the third trimester of a complicated pregnancy. Women's health is very important to the President -- but not more important than the right to abortion on demand. The Administration has rushed to bring the French abortion drug, RU-486, to domestic markets, recently declaring it ``safe'' for public consumption, even though there are clear signs that it is dangerous -- and not just to the baby it starves and then ejects from the womb. Many of the women who take the pills complain of intense pain, nausea, and prolonged bleeding for up to 44 days; 2 per cent hemorrhage and require surgical intervention to save their lives. In the French RU-486 trials, one woman died, and others suffered heart attacks. Clinton has long maintained that he wants abortion to be ``safe [and] legal'' (forget ``rare'') -- but evidently not in that order.

On September 19, prominent heart patient Boris Yeltsin signed a decree instructing the Russian ``power ministries'' (Defense, Interior, Security, and Foreign Affairs), which normally report to the president, to ``coordinate their activities'' with the prime minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin. During any actual surgery, the nuclear button would be temporarily entrusted to the prime minister as well. But within a few days, Yeltsin's doctors were speaking of a one- or two-month delay of the operation, due to the damaged condition of the presidential heart. (They waffled on earlier reports that Yeltsin had suffered a full-fledged but well-covered-up heart attack in late June, between the first and second rounds of the presidential election. There are limits to <I>glasnost</I>, apparently.) Whatever happens in the Kremlin operating room, Russia is in for an extended period of unstable government -- and the Clinton Administration's Russia policy, which has gambled everything on the personality of one man, hangs by a suture.

North Korea, with which the Clinton Administration so proudly forged a ``new relationship'' by the nuclear accord of October 1994, still carries on relations with South Korea in a very old spirit. Some 25 well-armed North Korean commandos sneaked ashore from a submarine near Kangnung on South Korea's northeast coast. Eleven crew members were found dead, either by mass suicide or murdered by their leaders; seven commandos were intercepted and killed by South Korean forces; one was captured. Others were missing and the object of an intensive manhunt, with the exact purpose of their mission as yet unknown. What is known is that the Clinton Administration will continue to prop up the decrepit but dangerous North Korean regime with food, aid, and diplomatic legitimacy.

Newly declassified government documents suggest that nine hundred American servicemen remained captive in North Korea after the prisoner exchange of 1952. That grisly medical experiments were performed on them sadly comes as no surprise -- unlike the suggestion, backed up by incriminating documents, that President Eisenhower and his Administration knew of the fate of the missing servicemen from the beginning. The Defense Department estimates that there are 15 Americans alive in captivity to this day. Pyongyang's denunciation of the charges, of course, is meaningless, and Congress is right to ask questions until the question is resolved.

Iranian authorities have announced they will soon be producing ``Islamic'' CD-ROM video games, to counter ``corrupt Western computer games.'' According to Mohammad Hussein Ali-Mohammadi, head of the Islamic Revolution Cultural Documentation Organization: ``The enemy is targeting us with ominous and anti-cultural software.'' Coming soon: a video game inspired by the 1980 - 88 Iran - Iraq war, with texts in Farsi, Arabic, and English. Order yours now!

Freedom House, a secular human-rights group, has just issued a study called <I>In the Lion's Den</I>, which details widespread -- and largely unreported -- persecution of Christians around the globe. Among the report's findings: 1996 has been ``the most repressive period'' since the 1970s for Christians in China, where police are circulating warrants for over 3,000 evangelicals; in Sudan, Christian children are spirited from their families and sold in open-air slave markets; and in Saudi Arabia, it is illegal to wear a cross, read a Bible, or even pray in one's home. Those who ignore such oppressions while claiming to speak out for human rights will be condemned by their silence. The book can be ordered by calling 1-800-451-READ.

Did President Reagan, CIA Director William Casey, and Pope John Paul II conspire to ruin the Soviet Union? <I>His Holiness</I>, by Watergate reporter Carl Bernstein and Vatican expert Marco Politi, says the Kremlin viewed the accession of the new Polish Pope with fear and anger (and, it should be added, probably was behind the assassination attempt upon him). The Reagan Administration put $50 million into the anti-Communist Polish Solidarity movement, in return for which the Pope refused to criticize the deployment of a new generation of missiles in Europe, thus ditching the European Catholic Left. CIA Director Casey and former deputy Director Vernon Walters met secretly and repeatedly with the Pope, the three of them agreeing that Poland was the nationalist and Catholic weak point in the Evil Empire. In all of this, William Casey appears to have been the strategic thinker. His successful scheme to manipulate the international oil market in order to damage the main Soviet source of hard currency has yet to be fully explored. His support, legal and illegal, for the Contras issued defeats for the Communists in Central America. Casey's story may never be told  -- such was the nature of his role -- but he looms still larger in <I>His Holiness</I>.

One, ah, footnote to the Dick Morris story. Even as he closed his $2.5-million book deal, he was feted at a newsmaker's luncheon at <I>The New Yorker</I>. Such freak shows are typical of the tenure of editor Tina Brown (whose husband, Harold Evans, signed Morris's book contract). But how do her colleagues feel about them? Henry Louis Gates Jr., the respected Harvard professor? Henrik Hertzberg, the deft political essayist? Stylish James Wolcott? Earnest Ken Auletta? Any pangs, twinges? The averted face, the furrowed brow? Gentlemen?

The lead character of the Disney/Touchstone-produced sitcom <I>Ellen</I>, played by comic Ellen DeGeneres, will probably come out of the closet this season, becoming the first homosexual starring character on TV (there are already a number of minor homosexual characters on other shows). Already the air is dark with flying platitudes. ``Ellen is trying to break new ground,'' says the actress's agent. ``It reflects Hollywood's commitment to diversity,'' says a gay activist. On the other (our) side, some Religious Right types will boycott Disney, and some pundit types will uphold their right to do so. But is that any less boring? The only way for conservatives to fight the culture wars in the long run is to become screen writers -- and novelists, and poets. Poets <I>are</I> the unacknowledged legislators of the world. Men live by bread, and they live under laws, but they live for stories. If there are better stories than the ones liberalism tells us (and there are), someone must tell them.

The Board of Visitors of the Virginia Military Institute voted 9 to 8 to admit women for the first time in the school's 157-year history. Facing dim prospects for raising enough money to go private and maintain VMI's all-male identity, the Board took the only course left, a result ordained at least since 1990 when the Justice Department sued the Institute for violating the Civil Rights Act and the equal-protection clause by its exclusion of women. VMI superintendent Josiah Bunting, while insisting that physical requirements will not be lowered for female cadets, admits that even this last hold-out for the old standards is likely to open the school to further lawsuits. Trustee Anita K. Blair predicts that a ``co-ed VMI soon will become indistinguishable from the existing cadet programs'' at other public institutions. In other words, a co-ed VMI will no longer be VMI. Have the cadets look up ``Pyrrhic victory'' in their manuals.

Tupac Shakur, the 25-year-old gangsta rapper gunned down in Las Vegas last week, lived and died the ghetto life. The son of a Black Panther, Shakur achieved fame by glorifying violence, drugs, and the degradation of women. No hypocrite, he practiced what he preached. Arrested numerous times, in 1993 he went to prison for beating a video director in a parking lot. In 1994 he was given four and a half years for his part in sexually assaulting a woman (two friends were also involved) and served eight months. While he reportedly believed in ``The Code'' -- a set of rules to stop violence in the inner city which required: 1) no drive-by shootings, 2) no random killings, 3) no drug dealing in the 'hood, and 4) no snitching -- somehow, that wasn't enough.

President Clinton, says a White House spokesman, applauded Boris Yeltsin's decision to go public with his heart surgery as ``a bold stroke that proved how important it [is] to be open about these sorts of situations.'' Apparently, since Clinton refuses to release <I>his</I> medical records, ``openness'' is only important in the Kremlin.

Using stealth technique to sign the Defense of Marriage Act did not keep Mr. Clinton off the gay community's radar screen. ACT-UP spokesman Steve Michael advised: ``Bill Clinton shouldn't be denigrating loving, committed gay relationships. He should be taking notes.''

<FONT SIZE=+3>I</FONT><font size=+1>N 1991</font>, with President George Bush still riding high, then-Sen. Al Gore announced he wouldn't make another bid for the Democratic presidential nomination -- partly because two years earlier his son had nearly died after being struck by a car. ``My family -- my wife and four young children -- are more important than politics and personal ambition,'' he avowed. Half a year later Gore's manifesto on the ecological crisis, <I>Earth in the Balance</I>, appeared -- also a result, he writes in the introduction, of his son's accident. The experience made him uncomfortable with the compromises and tawdriness of practical politics, ``increasingly impatient with the status quo, with conventional wisdom.'' By his own telling, Gore had been transformed into a politician of extraordinary virtue, willing to forsake ambition for his family, determined to embark on a quasi-spiritual crusade to save not just America or even democracy, but the planet.
<P>
Then, Bill Clinton called. Gore took the second spot on the ticket in 1992 and decided the wife and kids could wait while he spent his days disavowing the implications of <I>Earth in the Balance</I> in national debates and defending the compromises and tawdriness of the former Arkansas governor. Why the reversal? Well, it turns out, because his son had nearly died in a car accident. Accepting the vice-presidential nomination, Gore told the Democratic National Convention how immediately after the accident his son ``was limp and still, without breath or pulse.'' Gore was running for national office because, like his son, ``our democracy is lying there in the gutter, waiting for us to give it a second breath of life.'' His son's near-death, then, was now a kind of qualification for higher office. In fact, it seemed to be a justification for <I>anything</I>, a charm that Gore could rub whenever he needed an aura of virtue. 
<P>
Gore's father raised him to be President, and everything around him becomes automatically subsumed in the lifelong Al Gore for President campaign. His son's near death becomes a nice metaphor, his sister's painful, losing struggle with cancer a useful rhetorical riff, pandering and playing loose with the truth a necessary expedient (except when renouncing the same is even more expedient). And none of this is calculating or low because it is in the service of a goal whose purity is beyond reproach -- elevating Al Gore. The Vice President's reputation as a stiff at once underestimates him and gives him too much credit. Gore is disciplined and smart, at least an even match for his presumptive opponent in 2000, Jack Kemp. He is also, along with Hillary Clinton, today's foremost practitioner of the odious political style of the enlightened Baby Boomer, who assumes his own righteousness and considers any expedient justified in trying to visit it upon the nation.
<P>
Gore, a self-styled ``Son of the South,'' is really a Beltway baby. His father, Al Gore Sr., was a senator from Tennessee, and raised young Al in what is now the Ritz-Carlton hotel. He went to St. Albans, the exclusive prep school, and then on to Harvard, where, the joke goes, he studied Southern as a foreign language. His dad, meanwhile, got in trouble back home for his opposition to the Vietnam War. Al opposed the War, but volunteered to avoid embarrassing his father -- or, as the young Bill Clinton might have put it, to maintain his father's viability within the system. His dad lost anyway in 1970. Al supposedly soured on politics, but not enough to keep him from dropping his reporter job at a moment's notice six years later and running for an open congressional seat. He won the primary -- tantamount to election -- by 3,500 votes, the tightest race in his otherwise charmed political life. 
<P>
In the House and then in the Senate -- he won a Senate seat in 1984 -- Gore compiled a moderately liberal voting record (his Americans for Demo- cratic Action rating hovered around 70). As a congressman, he had a knack for grabbing headlines by championing goo-goo causes like nutritional standards for baby formula. In the Senate, GOP staffers still drip with contempt for him as ``a joke,'' who never matched his rhetoric with substance. He made his name on issues that, as Michael Kinsley has pointed out, were always ``difficult'' in the sense of being technical and dull, but not contentious. He became a student of the minutiae of arms control. He sponsored the Supercomputer Network Study Act. He, of course, talked about toxic waste. You can almost hear him thinking: ``Just don't make mistakes.'' It's an understandable impulse -- steer a safe course and graduate from Harvard, succeed  your daddy in the Senate, maybe even become President.
<P> 
The attitude suffused Gore's 1988 presidential bid, an exercise in ham-handed and utterly predictable cynicism. Gore ran at the urging of a group of wealthy Democrats who thought he could fill the ``moderate'' niche in the campaign. But his candidacy never developed a rationale. One of his first acts was to fly to Los Angeles with Tipper to tell music executives his wife didn't really mean the nasty things she had said about rock lyrics. Then he tried on successive campaign themes. The one he settled on was that he was the super-hawk in a field of liberal wimps, despite the fact that it was at odds with his record (votes against the Contras, against SDI, etc.). He wrote off Iowa, declaring, ``I will not barter my beliefs to win votes here or elsewhere,'' then went on to sell them wholesale anywhere he thought he might find a buyer. 
<P>
In Virginia, he visited a Norfolk shipyard to rap his opponents for wanting to cancel contracts for aircraft carriers there. Never mind that Gore had voted against $688 million in fiscal-1988 funding for those same carriers. After a disappointing showing in the Southern Super Tuesday primaries, he headed North, willing to try anything. In union-dominated Michigan he declared: ``I want to put the Democratic Party back on the side of working people.'' In Wisconsin he proposed a ridiculous hike in the dairy-support program that, by one estimate, would have cost consumers an extra forty cents a gallon. He even borrowed Dick Gephardt's economic-nationalist theme -- earlier he had been a critic -- when he vowed in an ad to ``make these corporations pay their share of taxes and create jobs here in America.'' In New York, finally, he became the candidate of Israel and Ed Koch, before his campaign at last was put out of its misery. 
<P>
In <I>Earth in the Balance</I>, published in early 1992, Gore pours some scorn, as well he might, on his 1988 bid. The book is self-flagellating and self-promoting all at once, and has a certain unhinged quality. Gore warns that we are at the ``edge of history,'' because ``[m]odern industrial civilization, as presently organized, is colliding violently with our planet's ecological system.'' So, he proposes nothing less than its complete re-organization. He rules out world government (sorry, just not practical), but not much else. He calls for a Global Marshall Plan. A Strategic Environment Initiative will phase out ``inappropriate technologies,'' including that pesky internal-combustion engine. A regime of taxes and regulations will make the environment a crucial factor in all economic decisions. Finally, binding international agreements will ensure that all nations stick with the program.
<P>
What got into Al Gore? There's still a Boy Scout feel to his advocacy. How can he get the most merit badges? By saving the planet. But Gore is also in the grip of a new idea: We're all inter-connected; our decisions affect other people; <I>there's an entire world outside Al Gore</I>! ``The search for truths about this ungodly crisis,'' Gore writes, ``and the search for truths about myself have been the same search all along.'' The book brims with amateur psychology. ``[W]e internalize the pain of our lost sense of connection to the natural world, we consume the earth and its resources as a way to distract ourselves from the pain, and we search insatiably for artificial substitutes to replace the experience of communion with the world that has been taken from us.'' Uh-huh. Gore's laments over our loss of connection with ourselves at times sound like a timid politician's cry for help.
<P>
The book marks a departure for Gore. Before, he could only muster his self-righteousness in the service of his ambition. Now he can do it for a cause, permitting him to go straight from smarmy politico to fanatic. With his repeated, sophomoric references to Nazism, he implies that those who don't share his views are not misguided, but evil. ``It is not merely in the service of analogy that I have referred so often to the struggles against Nazi and Communist totalitarianism,'' he writes, ``because I believe that the emerging effort to save the environment is a continuation of these struggles.'' Almost anything is justified in such a fight, and Gore makes it clear that science in particular shouldn't be allowed to stand in the way. He attacks Descartes and Bacon for laying the groundwork for the modern scientific revolution, and criticizes the notion that there ``can be a separation between facts and values, between the thoughts of a scientist and the moral duties of a human being.''

<font size=+3>G</font><font size=+1>ORE</font> has already struck blows for a science colored with his values. His Senate office was involved in an effort to discredit S. Fred Singer, a prominent skeptic about the greenhouse effect, after Singer published an article co-signed by Roger Revelle -- the father of global-warming theory and an inspiration to Gore --  suggesting that there wasn't evidence to justify radical actions to prevent global warming. Singer sued his chief critic, who had co-ordinated with Gore's office, for libel and won a public apology. Meanwhile, Bush appointee William Happer, the highly regarded director of research at the Department of Energy, was slated to stay on board after the 1992 election. But Happer, in internal discussions and congressional testimony, continued to discount global-warming alarmism and push for additional research before taking draconian action. One former Energy employee remembers a meeting where a high-ranking civil servant told Happer, ``I agree with you, Will, but I'd like to keep my job.'' Happer got the axe. 
<P>
Environmentalism has become de rigueur throughout the Administration. Warren Christopher recently declared that environmental issues would be a top priority of the <I>State Department</I>. It was a victory for Gore, whose most ambitious environmental project so far was the BTU energy tax, which took a drubbing in Congress in 1993. Other efforts to advance the green agenda have been similarly tempered by reality. ``Faced with an unresponsive Congress,'' says Jonathan Adler of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, ``Gore has provided an ideological rudder to ensure environmental initiatives still advance as far as possible.'' When the Administration developed a Climate Change Action Plan in 1993, environmentalists were angry that it didn't insist on mandatory caps on greenhouse emissions. In July the Administration decided it would push for just such caps, in another baby step on the way to the Global Marshall Plan.
<P>
<font size=+3>G</font><font size=+1>ORE</font> has also succeeded, thanks to his sheer relentlessness, in making himself a player in the Administration more broadly. He generally has pushed Clinton toward the center, urging him to produce a balanced budget by a date certain and sign welfare reform. His own moderate credentials have been burnished by his Reinventing Government (REGO) project, which is typical Gore: it has unobjectionable goals, involves a lot of technical details, and is much less than meets the eye. Savings have fallen far short of projections, while the project's vaunted personnel reductions are mostly a result of Defense Department downsizing. Besides, Gore's true loyalties are elsewhere. The Environmental Protection Agency's highly touted Project XL is supposed to be a model of chastened REGO-style regulation. But the state of Minnesota is already considering quitting the pilot program. One Dow Chemical official told <I>Chemical Week</I>, ``XL may be more cumbersome than the permitting process.''
<P>
But REGO is still a bragging point for Gore, as he runs simultaneously for Vice President this year and President in 2000. He's better on the stump than his reputation suggests, especially adept, as he demonstrated with his Macarena  dance in Chicago, at poking fun at himself. But he still can be flat. Before a Jewish group in New York City recently, he recited a speech in a monotone, occasionally inserting lengthy pauses between words for emphasis. Is this Al Gore delivering a speech or Al Gore pretending to be Al Gore delivering a speech? But a day later at the State University of New York at Albany he rallied a packed gymnasium of hyped-up students. They yelled, ``Do it!'', and ``Macarena!'' as soon as he came to the lectern. He pounded away at GOP education cuts, Medicare cuts, etc. He somehow took credit for the economic recovery and must have mentioned the phrase ``bridge to the future'' half a dozen times. It was a vague, slightly dishonest performance, totally lacking in content, exactly the kind of politics he attacked in <I>Earth in the Balance</I>.
<P>
It's too early to handicap the Democratic race in 2000, but Gore and Dick Gephardt are likely to be major contenders. Gore should occupy the center and try to tack left to pick up the party's special interests. Gephardt will do roughly the opposite. But neither is exactly a fresh wind in the party. The New Democrat movement, such as it is, has always been an outside force, hoping to overthrow the party's established order. Gore is at best an establishment fellow-traveler. The major debate among Democrats after 1996 will be whether Clinton's renewed popularity is a result of his move to the center or his defense of traditional government spending programs. Gore, who advocated both a balanced budget and standing firm against the GOP during the shutdowns, is well positioned to straddle the debate. Then, no doubt, he will work to make this accommodation seem a matter of high principle and courage. Dependent on his victory will be the nation's, nay the planet's, future. And, much more importantly, that of Al Gore.

<H2>Get Out The Hip-Hop Vote</H2></CENTER>

<HR>
<P>
NEW YORK, AUGUST 21<br>


Two news releases advise us of current exercises in democratic practice. The first is an enterprise its sponsors call the ``hip-hop nation.'' It is specifically directed to ``keep African-Americans involved in American politics.''
<P>
Rock the Vote has joined with L.L. Cool J's Camp Cool Foundation and together they have created the Hip Hop Coalition for Political Change. The objective is young African-Americans and the design is to attract their attention in every city on the R. Kelley/L.L. Cool J tour, plus a series of television and radio public-service announcements ``featuring the likes of Will Smith, Kadeem Hardison, Coolio, Method Man, a reunited New Edition, Shai, Solo, Mokensteff, and many others.'' The coalition, reports Softline Information Inc.'s The Ethnic NewsWatch, ``plans to get the message out to the Black community that it's time to take part in the struggle and make a difference.''
<P>
Meanwhile, the <I>New York Times</I> informs us of the program of a nonprofit organization financed by the recording industry ``that revved up the youth vote in 1992.'' Rock the Vote has launched a service that will fill out voter-registration forms for callers who dial 800-REGISTER, or 800-734-4783.
<P>
Here is what you do. You dial the number and a voice asks you to tap in your zip code. A voice then reads to you the requirements of the state you live in (it is kindergarten work for a computer to deduce your state from your zip). You are then asked your name and date of birth.
<P>
You are then congratulated. In about ten days a completed form arrives in the mail. Rock the Vote even supplies the stamp. ``A new voter is born,'' the <I>Times</I> reports. One week before the election, the freshly registered voter will receive a postcard, reminding him to vote. The program, based in Santa Monica, California, hopes to register 500,000 new voters by September 10. The cost of the enterprise is borne by MCI, the communications company, in cooperation with MTV, the television station that features rock music and other saturnalia.
<P>
Now all of this has become possible owing to the national Voter Registration Act (the ``motor-voter law''). The idea (the Democrats', primarily) was to diminish the clerical burden on the voter. The Act specifies that states must accept voter-registration forms by mail. And further, that motor-vehicle departments, which is where practically everybody turns up at some point or another, must serve as registration agencies. Get a driver's license, register to vote.
<P>
The assumption, of course, is that an increase in the number of votes means a marginal increase in Democratic votes. This is quite obvious in the operation of the Hip Hop Coalition, inasmuch as it is explicitly directed to ``young African-Americans.'' Since American blacks vote over 90 per cent Democratic, it isn't likely that adding black votes will do other than enhance Democratic chances.
<P>
The Rock the Vote people aren't saying it in as many words, but you know, and I know, that the assumption is that MTV types will, without any interruption in rhythm, be attracted to free-form politics, in this case nicely summarized by the formula, A meets with B to decide how much C should give to D.
<P>
The get-out-the-vote fetishists are always declining to make the fundamental distinction, which is between voting for the commonweal, and voting for one's singular interests. It is certainly true that there is as high a percentage of rich people who vote for policies that favor rich people as of poor people who vote for policies that favor the poor. The rich farmer is likely to vote in favor of a continuation of subsidies, the poor farmer in favor of free health care. The moral tale could be lightly made if for instance after you dialed the 800 number and gave your date of birth the voice at the other end of the line were to say, in computer-tone:<br>
``That means, Mr. Squires, that you were 32 years old on your last birthday. Are you registering to vote for the first time? If so please record which of the following is the motivating impulse that brought you today to the phone, answer A, B, or C. a) I didn't know how to register until I saw this ad. b) I reflected that the time has come to do my civic duty. c) I want to vote for the party that's promising me higher wages/higher pension/better health-care benefits/higher tariffs.''
<P>
The caller is always free to hang up. Though maybe the next National Voter Register Act will make that illegal.

TRANSCRIPT EXTRACT: CAMPAIGN PHONE LINK.
<P> 
DATE: 9/22/96 BEGIN INTERCEPT: 11:19 A.M.
<P> 
STATIC. VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Rusty? Rusty, can you hear me?
<P>
STATIC. UNINTELLIGIBLE RESPONSE.
<P>
VPOTUS: Rusty?
<P>
STATIC. DEAD LINE.
<P>
VPOTUS: Damn satellite phones.
<P>
PHONE BEEPS. VPOTUS: Hello?
<P>
UNIDENTIFIED MALE VOICE: Who've I got here?
<P>
VPOTUS: This is Al Gore.
<P>
UNMALEV: Perfect. Just perfect. You with me?
<P>
VPOTUS: Who is this?
<P>
UNMALEV: Can't you recognize the voice? Thought my voice was more recognizable than the ears on my head. Perfect. This is beautiful. This is interesting. Can you follow me?
<P>
VPOTUS: Ross Perot?
<P>
UNMALEV: Got it right the first time. Now just let me finish. Will you let me finish? Hey, what's that clicking and whirring sound?
<P>
VPOTUS: It's my wife. She's on the plane with me. She's taking pictures for a new book.
<P>
UNMALEV: Huh. Isn't that interesting. I heard the same clicking and whirring during my daughter's wedding. Huh.
<P>
VPOTUS: How did you get this number, Ross?
<P>
HRP: Simplest thing in the world. Computers truly are the problem-solvers of our time. But I didn't get you on the blower to make your ears sweat. I want to know why you agreed to keep me out of the debates. Just give me a simple answer.
<P>
VPOTUS: Well, Ross --
<P> 
HRP: Will you let me finish? Can I finish here? Or is it just you talking and the American people wondering who lit the barn on fire and got the marshmallows out too late? Five Republicans and five Democrats got together and decided to keep me out of the debates and let me be completely clear with you -- okay? -- I have my home in Dallas and my children's homes under complete protection by a private group of security personnel and my wife and myself are wearing football helmets lined with tin foil -- so do not -- I repeat do not -- attempt to alter our behavior with rays or beams from space because it won't work.
<P>
VPOTUS: Ross, I assure you, if it was up to me, I'd let you in the debates.
<P>
HRP: Of course you would. When you and I went on ``Larry King'' to debate NAFTA, it was very clear to the viewers -- and I have had a team of experts from countries that were once members of the Soviet bloc analyze the tape -- that you were wearing a tiny device in your ear.
<P>
VPOTUS: I was, Ross. So were you. So was Larry. When you appear on television, the producers give you an earpiece so they can communicate with you from the booth.
<P>
HRP: Can I finish? I have been in business for forty years. I know how TV works. Now what you've just done is take a cat, skin it, put the skin on your head, and meow, okay?
<P>
VPOTUS: I beg your pardon?
<P>
HRP: You had an earpiece in the other earpiece and the White House was feeding you the answers.
<P>
VPOTUS: I resent that, Ross. I won that debate fair and square.
<P>
HRP: Now here's where it gets interesting. Okay? Let me simplify. And let me make it clear that the football helmets that my wife and I wear cannot be penetrated by thought waves, okay? Absolutely no thoughts can enter or exit.
<P>
VPOTUS: Ross -- 
<P>
HRP: I'm pulling out of the race.
<P>
VPOTUS: What?
<P>
HRP: Okay, I'm back in the race. The point is simple. I'm not stupid and neither are the American people. What are my chances in November?
<P>
VPOTUS: Honestly? Not good.
<P>
HRP: Okay. Now we've toasted the bread. Let's spread the peanut butter. Follow me. What if I promise not to go after Bill Clinton?
<P>
VPOTUS: What?
<P>
HRP: Still slow on the uptake, aren't you? Let's simplify. I run. I debate. Clinton wins. Okay?
<P>
VPOTUS: Okay.
<P>
HRP: Double-click on the year 2000. My guess is you want to be President.
<P>
VPOTUS: Well . . .
<P> 
HRP: Now I've got to wrap this up because it's hard to hear through the helmet. Here's what I'm saying. I would be honored if you would run in the year 2000 on the Reform Party ticket.
<P>
VPOTUS: What?
<P>
HRP: Think about it.
<P>
VPOTUS: Okay, but --
<P> 
HRP: Can I finish please? Can I please finish? I have to go. I'm going to debate a couple of empty chairs on ``Larry King.'' If they interrupt me as much as you have, this is going to get interesting.
<P> 
STATIC. END TRANSMISSION 11:35 AM.

In President Clinton's speech to the Democratic Convention -- which, for all we know, may still be going on as you read this -- he proposed ``to give businesses a tax credit for every person hired off welfare and kept employed,'' and ``to offer private job-placement firms a bonus for every welfare recipient they place in a job who stays in it.'' As a welfare reform, this proposal is pretty insignificant, but still wrongheaded: all previous efforts to provide benefits to recipients for getting off welfare have ended up persuading more people to get on it in the first place. But there's a more basic issue of fairness at stake here. Under this proposal, employers are encouraged to give greater consideration to welfare recipients than to job applicants who have ``worked hard and played by the rules.'' It is thus simply a surreptitious way of extending the existing regime of state-sponsored discrimination that goes by the name of ``affirmative action.'' This wouldn't go unchallenged if the Republican Party were still alive.

Sherry Rowlands meanwhile told the <I>Star</I> that Mrs. Clinton's address to the Democratic convention was a lot better than the original, oversweet draft that Dick Morris wrote. Hillary will be <I>so</I> pleased to hear it.

Ross Perot is pulling about 4 per cent in preference polls and airing 30-minute infomercials that are competing for the attention of 3 A.M. television viewers with ads for psychic phone consultations and 900-numbers. He stole the nomination of his own party, the presidential ``primary'' of which drew only 5 per cent of party members. His contribution to the policy debate consists mostly of rantings about Washington lobbyists, foreign trade, and a secret microphone in the Vice President's ear, not always in that order. He has now compounded his irrelevance by selecting as his running-mate Pat Choate, a Washington-based lobbyist for protectionism whose previous brush with destiny was as the ghostwriter of Perot's last book. Perot, in short, is a blight on American politics. For that reason -- and because he flunks the presidential debate commission's chief criterion of having a plausible chance at getting elected -- he should be kept as far from the debates as possible. The best forum for Ross Perot is the one he already has  -- the seedy reaches of late-night television.

In the last few days before adjournment, conservative senators are fighting with their own leadership to prevent the lifetime appointments of more Clinton judges to the federal bench. President Clinton has now appointed 26 per cent of all active federal judges, and GOP Senate leaders appear anxious to increase his judicial clout weeks before the election. Majority Leader Trent Lott permitted 17 district judges to be confirmed before the August recess, and Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch now wants to offer more Clinton appointees for expedited approval. Senators Kay Bailey Hutchison (Tex.), Jon Kyl (Ariz.), and Charles Grassley (Iowa) are to be commended for resisting this rush to judges.

Reality can no longer be satirized in the European Union. When EU foreign ministers met in Tralee, Ireland, on September 7 and 8, they disagreed totally over Iraq. London supported the U.S. raids unconditionally; Paris thoroughly disapproved. After which they reiterated their intention to write a common European foreign and security policy into a new treaty in 1997. But there are clear dangers in this process for the United States. Too divided to support the U.S. against Saddam Hussein, the EU is strangely united in its determination to defend the right of its businessmen to trade with Cuba, Libya, and Iran. Even a committed pro-European like Stuart Eizenstat was unable to change this on his recent mission. An integrated Europe increasingly governed by summiteers and independent central bankers will be both too cautious and too selfish to stand up for joint Western interests. More dangerous still: it is precisely because the Russians understand all this that they are in favor of a ``Europeanized'' (read: ``anti-American'') NATO. The U.S. must not continue to treat European integration with its customary benign neglect. What <I>kind</I> of Europe matters.

A key part of Ronald Reagan's legacy -- the National Endowment for Democracy -- is under attack once again on Capitol Hill. The Senate Appropriations Committee recently zeroed out its funding after the House had approved the Administration's request ($30 million, the same as current funding). Sen. Judd Gregg (R., N.H.) led the attack, arguing that ``the Cold War is over.'' He thus joins with those on the far Left who have sought the elimination of the NED since its creation in 1983. In fact, despite the collapse of the Soviet Union, two-fifths of the world's population still lives under autocratic rule, according to Freedom House. The NED has given aid and comfort to major democratic movements around the world, including Solidarity in Poland, Aung San Suu Kyi's party in Burma, and the Chinese human-rights movement -- and served U.S. interests in doing so. Its party-affiliated institutes may deserve some of the credit for Boris Yeltsin's defeat of the Communists in Russia --  not through the intervention of some last-minute self-promoting American consultants but through years of assistance to Russia's democrats and free-marketeers. The Senate should restore the NED's full funding in September when the appropriations bill reaches the floor.

October is Nobel Peace Prize season and Richard Holbrooke is waiting by his phone. The unraveling of his Dayton Accord on Bosnia may not be a disqualification --  after all, Ralph Bunche won the Prize for a fragile Arab -  Israeli armistice (one of many), and Le Duc Tho and Henry Kissinger shared it for a Vietnam agreement that didn't last long either. The Prize seems to be an ``A for Effort'' kind of thing. Holbrooke's was a valiant effort, though it was the climax of a badly flawed Clinton policy that ignored the real problem, namely an imbalance of military power that aided the Serb aggressors. Given the Norwegian Nobel Committee's often kinky tastes, however -- left-leaning groups are usually favored and Americans are usually shunned -- other candidates might be Greenpeace or the Mexican Zapatistas (with honorable mentions to Gerry Adams and the Unabomber). We could do much, much worse than Dick Holbrooke.

To most of America, the disingenuousness of tobacco-industry spokesmen is a cliche. To anti-smoking activists, it's a never-ending outrage. To lawyers suing cigarette manufacturers, it's a potentially lucrative tort. And to the U.S. Justice Department, it's a federal offense. The <I>Washington Post</I> reports that FBI agents are issuing grand-jury subpoenas to mid-level employees of Philip Morris and other tobacco companies, hoping that the threat of perjury charges will elicit testimony implicating senior industry officials in the crime of making false or misleading statements to Congress and federal agencies. This crime hinges mainly on whether tobacco-company executives are sincere when they suggest that smokers value nicotine for its taste, or when they insist, despite overwhelming evidence, that they personally do not <I>believe</I> that smoking causes lung cancer or that nicotine is addictive. Without getting inside their brains, we will never know for sure, but we can guess the answer. More to the point, no one is fooled by such legalistic evasions unless he wants to be. But the Justice Department has little faith in Americans' ability to see through transparent prevarications. As the Post notes, ``The tobacco industry has become an issue in the 1996 presidential campaign, with President Clinton positioning himself as the anti-smoking candidate.'' Yet ``Justice Department officials . . . say their probe is independent of White House influence.''

``I would kind of like to throw up in living color,'' said Rep. Pat Schroeder in reaction to the Morris scandal. Not to argue with your delicate sentiments, ma'am, but the contemporary term, coined by the great Australian comedian Barry Humphries, is ``a Technicolor yawn.''

President Clinton is proposing to bypass Congress and use the 1906 Antiquities Act to declare some 9,000 square miles of southern Utah a ``national monument'' in order to thwart a Dutch coal company from exercising its mining-lease rights to the Kaiparowits plateau, a remote sector of what they used to call ``badlands'' -- country so rocky and dry it was bypassed by cattlemen. Andalax Resources, Inc., discovered rich coal seams there and wants to open a mine based on leases granted in the mid 1980s. White House aides have said the Administration will not challenge Andalax's right to <I>mine</I> the coal but will deny it the permits needed to build roads to get the coal out. The <I>Washington Post</I> quoted a senior official as saying, ``The lease clearly conveys the right to explore for and develop and mine the coal. It doesn't say they necessarily have the right to get coal off the lease.'' File that under: ``What's a Constitution between friends?''

Mr. Clinton's ``bridge to the twenty-first century'' may sound like empty campaign rhetoric, but wait till you pay the toll.

 WASHINGTON, D.C.<br>
<FONT SIZE=+3>C</FONT><font size=+1>RITICS</font>   called the Republican National Convention an infomercial, but San Diego was amateur hour compared to the ``Listening to America'' forums Bob Dole is holding across the country. In Pittsburgh, a hundred invited guests sit in a warehouse belonging to Gamma Racquet Sports, Inc. -- the kind of small business Dole's economic plan is meant to help -- listening to Sen. Rick Santorum (R., Pa.) introduce the candidate. The fresh-faced, 38-year-old senator paces with a microphone, explaining what Bob Dole can do for you, right now, money-back guaranteed. He elicits tightly controlled bursts of applause straight from 2 A.M. television. The product could as easily be Frizz-Ease or the Ab-Master as a political program. Before it's over, you expect Richard Simmons to bounce out in skimpy purple shorts and hug the fattest guy who's in favor of a 50 per cent capital-gains tax cut.
<P>
Of course, the main attraction isn't the light-on-his-feet Simmons, but Bob Dole, who is anything but. Dole maneuvers through these forums like a high-wire act. He is up there, trying to connect, trying to listen to America, but will he trip? His wit plays well. After the owner of Gamma gives a glowing spiel about his company's tennis products, Dole deadpans: ``Nice racket you got here.'' Everyone laughs. Later, Dole interrupts a rambling questioner, with a smile, but a little snappish: ``What's your bottom line?'' Watch that edge, Bob. He goes on to explain why regulatory reform didn't pass -- ``We needed 60 [votes] to cut off the debate'' -- just bursting to say one of those incomprehensible process words: ``cloture.'' He resists. When a single mom tells how she couldn't get her small business off the ground, Dole begins his answer, ``There is a government program . . .'' No, Bob! Don't contradict your message by recommending government help! ``I know Rick would follow up as far as the SBA is concerned.''
<P>
Ahhh! But Dole quickly rights himself and talks about creating more private-sector opportunities again. He leaves the crowd of hand-picked Republicans impressed with his straightforwardness. When Dole made this early-September visit -- his third recent trip to Pennsylvania -- he brought a sharpened tax message. In his Saturday radio address, he told Americans how they are sending on average almost 40 per cent of their income to the government, as much as they spend on food, shelter, and clothing combined. He pounded the IRS, promising to ``end [it] as we know it,'' and spelled out how cutting just a small slice of federal spending -- some $10 trillion over the next six years -- would pay for the tax cut. He scores Clinton's alternative of ``targeted'' tax incentives as just another wat ``to dictate how you should spend'' your money.
<P>
It's as about as convincing on taxes as Dole is likely to get. The campaign realizes it has lost traction on the tax front -- polls show people by a narrow margin trusting Clinton more than Dole on the issue -- and it has to punch a message through with more immediacy for the average person. The campaign (or at least what seems to be the dominant faction at the moment) is convinced that one reason the plan hasn't taken off is that public awareness of it is still low. Hammering relentlessly on it in coming weeks -- with occasional jabs on an issue like drugs -- will boost those numbers, goes the theory, and inevitably Dole's overall numbers as well. The model is Christine Todd Whitman's New Jersey campaign in 1993, when a singleminded focus on taxes paid off, but only at campaign's end. So while all of GOP Washington panics at Clinton's renewed 15 - 20 point lead, the Dole campaign seems ready to stay the course.
<P>
There's no doubt Dole's tax plan still has untapped potential. The question is whether it has enough. The New Jersey model, for instance, has flaws. Christine Whitman benefited from a huge GOP get-out-the-vote effort, while incumbent Jim Florio, still suffering from lingering unpopularity, ignored his base. Dole, on the other hand, faces depressed GOP turnout and is squaring off against a President with nearly 60 per cent approval ratings. Dole is also trying to sell an economic message in an economy growing at a 4.2 per cent pace last quarter, with an unemployment rate at its lowest in seven years. It's an indication of how hard the GOP has to stretch for bad news that the RNC recently issued a press release on declining construction spending. On the social front -- fertile ground for the GOP -- Dole has been disarmed by both the GOP Congress, which kicked away issues like crime, and Dick Morris, who helped the President snatch them up. 
<P>
Dole is left half a candidate. In a packed gym at the University of Scranton, he is greeted by an enthusiastic, sweaty throng of more than a thousand locals and pompom-waving students as the sound system blasts jazzy riffs from the Blues Brothers sound-track. Dole keeps up the energy with slashing and amusing attacks on Clinton on taxes, which go on for perhaps a bit too long. Then what? He talks about drugs. The Dole campaign swears this is a cutting issue, particularly with women; focus groups of 15 women sympathetic toward Clinton will reportedly leave after hearing the drug message loathing the President. But the crowd in the gym isn't particularly moved; drugs is simply not a defining issue. Can Dole get mileage from it? ``If they can prove the President is on drugs now,'' says political analyst Stuart Rothenberg, ``they may have a chance.''
<P>
But Dole still has an energetic crowd when he moves to his speech's close. ``Let me just say this,'' Dole intones, a bleacher full of students yelling behind him. ``This is America, the greatest country on the face of the Earth.'' It's an utterly banal line. But there's still something moving about it from Dole -- he means it, and proved it somewhere in Italy fifty years ago. This, then, is where Dole can close the deal, making up for his charisma gap with an emotional evocation of his small-town life and service to country. But Dole keeps stepping on the mood. When he mentions Russell, Kansas, he motions to fellow Russell native Sen. Arlen Specter (R., Pa.), on the stage with him: ``Arlen and I grew up there little different times. He's much, much younger . . . But nobody gets old there. But, in any event . . .'' Then Dole says he ``wasn't born with this suit on.'' Well, he pauses: ``Come to think of it I wasn't born with any suit on.''
<P>
Dole seems emotionally incapable -- except in rare instances -- of playing on his past effectively. The asides and quips always distance himself from himself. The problem isn't that Dole is too hardened or bitter really, but that he's too brittle. Watching him, in front of the Pittsburgh forum, standing with his arms crossed, his left hand holding what seems to be an almost empty right sleeve, brings home again the grievous nature of Dole's wound. There's a vulnerability to him. Dole choked up during his convention speech just saying he loved his father. To his eternal credit, it would simply be impossible for him to make the excruciatingly managed play on emotion of Al Gore talking about his sister. Dole, beneath it all, is a man of such deep feelings that they aren't readily available for manipulation, a fact that contributes to his image as the candidate of coldness.
<P>
Which in turn contributes to his poor showing among women. The campaign considers the conservative base locked up with the tax plan and the choice of Kemp as VP, and is concentrating on re-capturing women and GOP moderates. The focus on jobs and small business is considered attractive to women, increasingly the owners of small start-ups. Drugs, again, are considered a women's issue. So is education, a topic Dole treats well on the stump: he asks rhetorically why all parents in America shouldn't have the same ability as the President to send their children to private schools, and he shellacs the teachers' unions. The real danger of Dole's play for moderates is that it scares the campaign off the kind of wedge issues that polarize the electorate along liberal - conservative lines and send ``Reagan Democrats'' scurrying to the GOP.
<P>
The issue of race preferences is the foremost example. The Dole campaign doesn't think it polls well. And it is afraid of the issue's ``volatility.'' But when you're 15 points behind, volatility is a good thing: stock-market crashes, hostage crises -- bring them on! More fundamentally, the preference issue goes to the half of the campaign that has been missing so far. Dole's best-received non-tax line on the stump is when he vows that he, not Boutros Boutros-Ghali, will make decisions about committing U.S. troops to combat. Sound familiar? It's a straight lift from Pat Buchanan. Dole has adopted the Steve Forbes line on taxes; now he needs Buchanan's on the social issues (or at least Gingrich's circa 1994). With crime and welfare essentially neutralized, Dole can still talk about multiculturalism, bilingual education, illegitimacy, and even abortion to get to the differences between the parties. In Scranton, for the first time since his nomination, Dole hit on partial-birth abortion; he did it only after prodding by Senator Santorum on the trip from Washington, but it was a step toward appealing to Catholic swing voters. 
<P>
Dole needs them desperately if he is going to negotiate a tough-looking  electoral map. His aides figure he has to win everything from Idaho east to Minnesota, with the exception perhaps of Montana and New Mexico. Then he has to sweep the South, with the exception of Louisiana and Arkansas, but definitely including Georgia, Tennessee, and Kentucky (Clinton states in 1992). Only then can Dole afford to lose California and almost all of the Northeast. The key battleground states would be Pennsylvania (where he is down by 14 points), New Jersey (down by 13), Ohio (down by 6), Michigan (down by 10), and Iowa (down by 14). Any Dole strategy looks like a fairy tale as long as he is 15 points behind nationally, with even must-win Florida breaking for Clinton. But the campaign takes solace in the fact that twice in the campaign -- once in June, once in August after the GOP convention -- Clinton's big lead collapsed. That is evidence, they maintain, that when voters truly focus on their choice, it's a tight race.
<P>
<font size=+3>T</font><font size=+1>HE</font> question is whether they will ever again get the focus they want. In Pittsburgh, Dole had just zipped off a line about the teachers' unions, when right outside the door of the warehouse a cargo train began to rumble by on a railroad bridge. It made it hard to hear, as car after car rolled by. Here was Dole, standing with a microphone, just a man, again getting drowned out by forces beyond his control: whether it's the White House unblinkingly selling Clinton as a conservative, or an economy humming along nicely, or, in the previous week, the missile attack on Iraq, or just a day earlier, Hurricane Fran. Dole handled the situation well: ``That's the bridge to the future,'' he said, gesturing outside the door, ``more taxes, more drugs, etc.'' The crowd laughed, but the symbolism seemed -- appropriately enough -- pretty ominous.
<P>
The Dole campaign, despite everything, recently contacted Ed Meese for advice on putting together a presidential transition. Give Dole credit: maybe he really is the most optimistic man in America.

<H2>Perspective On Dick Morris</H2></CENTER>

<HR>
<P>
NEW YORK, AUGUST 30<br>







One view of the Dick Morris business is that he was, pure and simple, a technician. No different (to stretch the metaphor to the breaking point) from a computer. So the computer develops a virus? So -- since you can't eliminate this particular virus: only divine agents can accomplish that, and there is a long waiting list for their services -- you throw away the computer, and get another one. It's just that easy, that comprehensive. Next question?
<P>
The other view of it is that the computer in question had a very special hold over the President of the United States. Absolutely no one is denying that Morris was the architect of the post-Gingrich Clinton, the President who suddenly agreed that we had to balance the budget, who signed a welfare bill that surrendered final federal authority over welfare dispensations, who went so far as to recommend school uniforms to revitalize the sense of order and discipline in the chaotic little cloisters where the next generation is being taught how to behave. 
<P>
And then this second Morris was more intimately involved with the President than even the most advanced and malleable computer could be. When the news first reached Mr. Clinton, he said that Dick Morris was his friend, to whom he owed a great deal. He didn't quite say that he thought Morris not guilty of the charges leveled against him, but he did document his personal regard for him. And while Clinton was talking about Morris, Morris was writing about Clinton, in a statement that accompanied his resignation. What he said, in almost exactly as many words, was that he had picked Clinton up from the floor and propped him up to be, once again, a viable presidential figure. And then he went on to say that he had a very high opinion of the honor and character of Bill Clinton. 
<P>
But then of course the situation becomes complicated, because the two positions -- Morris as a mere computer, Morris as Rasputin -- crawl toward each other. So highly did Mr. Morris esteem the honor and character of Bill Clinton that he let his prostitute listen in on conversations over the telephone between the two men. Put it this way: There is no question that the man supremely responsible for Mr. Clinton's current focus on family values was himself scoffing at them. Morris (of course) says he was guilty of nothing (while writing out his resignation). From Clinton's end (through the chief strategist of the 1992 campaign, Paul Begala) we got the quiet dismay of a man temporarily on the rocks. ``I've been dealing with the press for 13 years, and I've always wanted to say this and I never was able to until this moment: No comment.''
<P>
It's hardly the end of the world for Bill Clinton. Lyndon Johnson had Walter Jenkins, his live-in amanuensis, who got caught seeking homosexual distraction in a YMCA a few weeks before the 1964 election. Nothing happened, unless one wants to attribute to that episode the loss of the five states won by Goldwater. The difference, however, is that Walter Jenkins's employer hadn't been repeatedly put down for licentious conduct, didn't have another confidant who committed suicide, didn't etc. etc. etc., all of which Mr. Clinton was engaged in trying to chase away into the shadows, using words in a speech substantially composed by -- Dick Morris. 
<P>
There has been much discussion lately of the question of presidential character. The subject came up when Senator Gary Hart was caught up in episodes of physical and moral relaxation, and of course it was what did Richard Nixon in. But Nixon's smoking gun wasn't merely an article in the <I>Star</I> documenting abandoned sexual conduct. ``Does it matter'' what a public figure does away from home? former mayor Ed Koch recently asked. After all (he continued) half of American marriages end in divorce and at least one half end, or don't end, with adultery in the picture. 
<P>
Surely one answer to that question is: What is the solemnity of the vow to fidelity taken by parties who contract marriage? Because the public is likely to reason (even if not justifiably) that to disdain an obligation under the one vow is to invite suspicion that the person in question would deal lightly with others. The incumbent President of the United States has taken two vows relevant here, the one to be faithful to the woman he married, the second to defend, so help him God, the Constitution of the United States.
<P> 
That's what the fuss is all about.<p>

September 7, 1996
<P>
Dear Rusty,
<P>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------->


<BR>
<BR>
<P>




It's been a heck of a week. In the first place, I'm still dealing with a lot of the emotional issues that have recently surfaced in my life -- things I've kept pretty well hidden deep in my heart. You know me, Rusty -- I'm a heart-on-my-sleeve kind of guy; I can't hide my emotions. And yet, somehow, some way, from 1988 to 1996 I campaigned in the South as a friend to the tobacco farmer, a supporter of the tobacco industry, a tobacco farmer myself -- all the while internally grieving for my sister who died of lung cancer in 1984. 
<P>
Psychologists call it ``delayed grief transference syndrome,'' and what it means, basically, is that sometimes it takes a big jolt to wake yourself up -- a jolt like realizing that Pennsylvania, Ohio, California, and Illinois don't have any tobacco farmers. You've got to look squarely at an electoral map before the healing can really begin. 
<P>
And then we had the Dick Morris thing, which is really too sordid to go into here. Suffice it to say that it turns out that Morris had a girlfriend, a mistress, and an illegitimate daughter. 
<P>
Lucky for us, Bill and HRC took it all pretty calmly. They go back a long way with Dick, so a lot of it probably didn't shock them. 
<P>
Immediately after we got word that Dick had received a $2.5-million advance from Random House for his memoirs, HRC baked a big batch of brownies and made a giant homemade card that we all had to sign. ``Congratulations, Dick! Our Little Boswell! With Best Wishes!'' was emblazoned on the front. I'm sure Dick appreciated it, but under the circumstances, it was an odd gesture. 
<P>
And later, I thought it was weird when they asked us to get on the phone with them last night, so we could all sing ``For He's a Jolly Good Fellow'' to Dick. After we finished singing -- and there were a lot of us crowded around the phone: me, Tip, HRC, Bill, Leon Panetta, George Stephanopoulos, Bob Rubin, and Mike McCurry -- I made the mistake of wishing Dick a happy birthday. It turns out it wasn't his birthday after all. We were singing because, as HRC said, ``It's Dick's favorite song.'' When I pointed out that my favorite song is ``Do You Know Where You're Going To/Love Theme from `Mahogany''' and that no one had ever sung it over the phone to me, all HRC said was, ``You don't have a book contract.'' 
<P>
A few days later, Bill launched an attack on Iraq. And a few days after that, we had a 20-point lead! 
<P>
The only problem is recapturing the House and Senate. In the first place, the pattern of retirements in the Senate is against us. And in the second place, the House races seem unlikely to be influenced by our campaign. 
<P>
But can I be honest with you, Rusty? I'm not all that disappointed. I'm thinking a lot about the future, Rusty, and I've got to admit that future includes a run for the Presidency in '00, and when I called the Des Moines TraveLodge yesterday to reserve 25 rooms and the Corn Cob Convention Room for February '00, well, guess what? Dick Gephardt had already reserved them! Ditto the Granite State Motor Inn in Manchester, New Hampshire. So now I'm stuck with the Ottumwa SleepyDaze as my Iowa headquarters and the MinuteMan Zzzs-4-Less in New Hampshire. So excuse me if I don't break my neck campaigning for Speaker Gephardt. 
<P>
Tonight, as we were all in the Oval Office coloring a big ``We Love You, Dick!'' banner, the conversation drifted to the latest Time magazine cover -- it features Dick and his wife looking glum and haggard. The banner we were working on was supposed to cheer them up. HRC was going to have the Marines fly it up to Connecticut in a C-class helicopter and then just sort of buzz around for a few hours with it flapping away. ``If he gets writer's block or something he can just look up and see this happy banner and then maybe he'll want to write happy things,'' she said. 
<P>
``Here's what I don't understand,'' I said. ``He cheats on his wife, he humiliates her in public, he's famous for having no real scruples or steadfast beliefs, he's liberal when it suits him and conservative when it suits him . . . I mean, what can you do with a man like that? Why would you stay married to him?'' 
<P>
Just then, Bill re-entered the room from another bombing raid. ``Hey!'' he cried happily. ``We're up 26 points in California!'' 
<P>
HRC looked at me. ``That's why,'' she said. ``Sometimes it's worth it.'' 
<P>
I'm not sure it is, Rusty. But then, my judgment is clouded. I'm still suffering delayed grief transference syndrome. I'm due in California tomorrow and it's coming on strong. Wish me the best.

16-SEPTEMBER-1996

At the last Chicago convention, under the bad Mayor Daley, the cops whacked Yippies. Now, under the good Mayor Daley, peace reigns in the party, and the convention is in a neighborhood you wouldn't dare visit at night unarmed under normal circumstances. Progress.

The media, quick to point out an alleged ``shortage'' of women and minorities at the Republican Convention, missed a more interesting story at the Democratic Convention -- the blatant resort to quotas in the selection of delegates. Democratic National Committee rules forbid ``mandatory quotas,'' and Bill Clinton repeatedly proclaims his opposition to them. Yet the 1996 Delegate Selection Rules require all state parties to adopt ``specific goals and timetables'' ensuring that each delegation exactly matches the Democratic electorate in the state in terms of color and sex. Rigid mathematical models and formulas are spelled out, and penalties ensue for any shortfall. As the <I>Wall Street Journal</I> points out, the result is a revealing gloss on how a re-elected Clinton Administration is likely to interpret its ``opposition'' to quotas.

John Cardinal O'Connor has disinvited Bill Clinton from the prestigious Al Smith dinner because of the President's support of partial-birth abortions. Such an unprecedented snub of a sitting President powerfully communicates the depth of the Catholic bishops' outrage. But Cardinal O'Connor diluted that message by not inviting Bob Dole either, in order to avoid charges of partisanship. Jack Kemp and Al Gore have been invited in the presidential nominees' places. The plain, if unwelcome, fact is that one party's ticket sided with the angels on this issue, and another's didn't. On partial-birth abortion, the President hasn't let squeamishness alter his course. Neither should Cardinal O'Connor.

The results are in. Did the networks apply the same standards to the Democratic convention that they did to the Republicans? Did Dan Rather predict walkouts and boos whenever any speaker mentioned the welfare bill? Did Tom Brokaw ask if the delegates really cared about the two-parent family? Did Jim Wooten of ABC point out that the Chicago Convention was ``well staged, craftily designed for a broadcast image of moderation that's starkly at odds with the reality on the floor''? Check your scorecards.

Congressional Republicans have refused to touch the issue of race preferences over the last year. No longer. If the House passes the version of the Federal Aviation Authorization Act of 1996 just endorsed by the House Transportation Committee, Republicans will finally take on the issue of quotas -- by re-authorizing one of the Federal Government's more egregious set-aside programs. The act requires that every airport applying for federal funds under the Airport Improvements Program guarantee that 10 per cent of firms doing business at the airport are minority owned. This has led to absurdities such as rental-car companies being forced to buy 10 per cent of their tires from minority firms. It also is plainly unconstitutional under the Supreme Court's <I>Adarand</I> decision. But airport bills are full of pork-laden goodies for nearly everyone, so the Transportation Committee likes to see them pass on big bi-partisan votes -- even if it means winking at the worst sort of racial bean-counting. The House leadership will end the practice, if it has a sufficient quota of courage.

At a morning meeting the first day of the Democratic National Convention, officials of the centrist Democratic Leadership Council bragged of having won the battle for the mind of their party. They can indeed point to a platform that studiously avoids leftist rhetoric and a President who, post 1994 at least, has regularly filched Republican issues. These victories are only provisional, however, as long as the muscles and tendons of the Democratic Party remain so dominated by the Left. While ``New Democrats'' trooped to the podium in the convention hall, in the streets and meeting halls elsewhere around town activists celebrated the old faith -- from AFL - CIO chairman (and Democratic Socialist) John Sweeney denouncing the ``evil'' of Newt Gingrich at an afternoon ``America Needs a Raise'' rally, to the National Education Association caucusing with top Democrats at the downtown Hyatt. All that holds the party together now is the sheer will to retain power. That, and not New Democrat centrism or any other ideological concoction, is what motivates today's Democratic Party. A DNC T-shirt says it all -- ``Win in '96,'' which is what must pass for uplift in Chicago. The last time Democrats met in the Windy City, there was talk of a ``New Politics'' of moral commitment and idealism. Chicago 1996 is about the triumph of the old politics, winning at all costs.

Mr. H. Ross Perot, who a year ago said he would rather perform brain surgery on himself than get back into presidential politics, likes to regard himself as George Washington II, and has enough money to buy either major party, is ``accepting'' nearly $30 million in federal election funds for his Reform Party. Or to put it more plainly, he's sticking it to taxpayers. If this is his idea of ``reform,'' he's overdue for that brain surgery.

Maybe Republicans should be happy the press didn't provide more coverage of the San Diego convention. Take the abortion controversy. Reporter after reporter explained that the Republican platform calls for a ban on all abortions. The platform's actual language -- ``we support a Human Life Amendment to the Constitution and we endorse legislation to make clear that the Fourteenth Amendment's protections apply to unborn children'' -- is silent on the issue of exceptions. ``It's a statement of principle, it's not a legislative document,'' explains Mike Russell, a Christian Coalition spokesman. The constraints of space, time, and audience attention often make it hard to convey the nuances of a story; but given the vast amount of media attention to abortion, it's puzzling why this error has become a hardy perennial of reporting on the issue. News accounts of the struggle over Dole's proposed ``declaration of tolerance'' were more accurate, but still misleading. They left the impression that all ``tolerance language'' had been stripped out of the platform. In fact, the platform refers three times to legitimate differences of opinion among Republicans: in the preamble (``In one way or another, every Republican is a dissenter''), in the statement of principles (``Because Americans are a diverse and tolerant people, they have differences of opinion on many issues''), and in the opening of the section which deals with abortion and other issues of individual rights and personal safety (``We are the party of the open door,'' etc.). By ignoring the more generic statements of tolerance, they misled viewers through omission. And Howell Raines, the <I>New York Times</I>'s editorial-page editor, provided the most mischievous free advice of the convention. Colin Powell ``could be a more serious force if he set out to rally Republican voters to take back the party from its convention zealots.'' In other words, the GOP's most popular figure should declare war on the party's base in the middle of an election year. And if liberal Democrats should benefit from this fratricide, well, that's OK too.

Bob Dole, it is said, is being whipped by President Clinton on the smoking issue. But nothing so dramatizes the Republican theme of an overbearing, blundering Federal Government as Clinton's policy toward tobacco. As it happens, his latest move -- to authorize the Food and Drug Administration to regulate the sale and advertising of tobacco products -- looks like a blunder indeed, because it commits the government to a protracted court battle with the tobacco industry that the industry will almost certainly win. Tobacco products simply don't fall within the purview of the FDA: the law gives the FDA jurisdiction only over pharmaceutical drugs, and all the elaborate regulations the FDA is likely to produce will in time be declared unconstitutional. FDA chief David Kessler knows that. But he doesn't care, wanting to use the interim period to speak to the nation as the President's anti-smoking czar. When Dole last got onto the smoking issue, he made the mistake of speaking off the cuff and then getting angry with lovable girl-next-door Katie Couric. He should choose his forum more carefully and then make the common-sense case that tobacco smoking is a pleasure which does entail a health risk, but that it is a matter of individual choice for adults whether or not they smoke: it is not a matter for Federal Government grandstanding and empire-building. Dole can legitimately warn against the Naderite zealots at the FDA who want to impose tobacco prohibition.

<I><b>NR</b></I> has suspected from the beginning that the political provisions of the Dayton Accords -- the noble blueprint for a unitary, multi-ethnic Bosnia -- might prove unattainable. Sure enough, the Bosnian elections scheduled for September 14 look to be a great disappointment, even a setback, rather than a boost toward stable democracy. There are charges of massive vote-rigging by Serbs in contested areas over which they seek to tighten their grip; in none of the rival communities is there a great predilection for democratic procedures. The deeper problem, however, is not the vote manipulation but the consolidation of partition. (``Electoral cleansing,'' <I>The Economist</I> dubs it.) The Serb and Croat populations have made clear (in U.S. Information Agency opinion polls) that they yearn for partition. For Bill Clinton, Dayton has already served its purpose of putting Bosnia on ice until our election is past. But whoever is President next year will face an unholy mess.

 WASHINGTON, D.C.<br>
<FONT SIZE=+3>"I</FONT><font size=+1>T ALL</font>  began with Buckley's column,'' said Jack Kemp at the NATIONAL REVIEW - GOPAC party on Monday night of convention week in San Diego. The column he was referring to, ``The Kemp Manifesto,'' had run on June 21. In it, Buckley called on Bob Dole to adopt some suggestions on welfare and economics that Kemp had made in an essay in the <I>Wall Street Journal</I>. But Buckley ended by proposing ``a second, equally exciting move'': that Dole ``name Jack Kemp as vice-presidential candidate.''
<P>
WFB has recommended running-mates before, not always with success: in 1964 he advised Barry Goldwater to tap former President Dwight Eisenhower. This June, offering Kemp as Dole's running-mate seemed scarcely more likely. By now, all the newspapers in America have replayed the long volley of gibes between the two men, going back to the intraparty supply-side wars of the early Eighties: quarterbacks playing without helmets; the fire in Dole's library; the bus that went over the cliff. Dole had made a rapprochement of sorts last year when he and Newt Gingrich picked Kemp to chair a party commission on tax reform (or was it a sop?). Then Kemp seemed to blow it all sky high this spring with his last-minute endorsement of Steve Forbes, on the eve of the New York primary. On top of their policy and political quarrels, Kemp and Dole looked at each other across a gulf of temperament. On the plains where he came from, Dole would say in his acceptance speech, ``a man is very small -- and if he thinks otherwise, he is wrong.'' In the locker rooms where he came from, Kemp used to say and has been saying ever since: ``Be a leader!''
<P>
By 1996 Kemp was estranged not only from the pragmatic Dole but from the conservative movement. His years as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development were marked by questionable policy and effusive rhetoric. Meanwhile, the article of Eighties orthodoxy to which he remained conspicuously faithful -- tax-rate cuts -- was being abandoned by the deficit hawks of the 104th Congress. In July, Kemp told Gingrich at a dinner that no one in the GOP was listening to him any more.
<P>
So adrift was Jack French Kemp that, just before San Diego, he called California Attorney General Dan Lungren and asked if the Lungrens wanted to have dinner with the Kemps Wednesday of convention week. Kemp had no plans.
<P>
Then the call came, and for the next ten weeks at least, Kemp's life will be entirely planned. It was the Great Gatsby meets the Grand Old Party. Kemp had decided not to run for the presidential nomination in this cycle because he dislikes raising money. Now, without raising a dime, he had landed the nomination next door. A man who at the age of 61 had seen his career run deep down into the ground, found himself raised up, not by a loyal friend, but by an old enemy. Who says there are no second acts in American lives?
<P>
Kemp's acceptance speech was fine cheerleading, and classic Kemp. Time has whitened his thatch and thickened his waist, but he still clatters the way he did in 1978. There was inclusiveness: ``From the boroughs of New York to the barrios of California, we're not going to leave anyone out of this campaign. . . . Our appeal of boundless opportunity crosses every barrier of geography, race, and belief. [By definition, since it is boundless.]'' Tablet-keeping: ``Communism came down, not because it fell, but because he pushed it. Thank you, Ronald Reagan.'' Capitalist theology: ``In our work . . . we discover that part within ourselves that is divine. . . . Growth and opportunity . . . advance human dignity.'' Problems: The economy ``is moving like a ship dragging an anchor.'' Solutions: We will ``cut the capital-gains tax in half and not apologize for it.'' Optimism: ``Americans do not accept limits. We transcend limits.'' More optimism: ``It is 1776 all over the world.'' Bob Dole, by the conclusion of his own acceptance speech, had brought himself to assert that he was ``the most optimistic man in America.'' Think otherwise -- there is at least one man ahead of him.
<P>
We can assume that two Republicans in San Diego were secretly displeased with the Kemp pick, not so much for 1996 as for 2000. One would be Pat Buchanan. As several of his supporters reminded me -- more in sorrow, it must be said, than in anger -- Kemp had announced back in February, when Buchanan was riding high, that he could not support a ticket headed by Pat. Buchanan has endorsed the Dole - Kemp ticket now. But he has been calling Kempery ``Big Rock Candy Mountain'' conservatism since the late Eighties. If Kemp should get the top spot in 2000, Buchanan will have ample reason to walk. The other future malcontent would be Colin Powell. In one stroke, Kemp's eager acceptance of Dole's offer made the much-wooed general's unwillingness to take the same slot seem like irrelevant shallying. Kemp is the Happy Warrior, Powell has become the Smug Noncombatant.
<P>
If Dole calculated that picking Kemp would give him a lift, he calculated right. It was more than just a charisma transplant, or an age balance (Kemp is only 12 years younger than Dole, but he will seem youthful if he lives to be 100). It was a statement, by Dole, of his own intentions. The Kemp pick showed that Dole's tax plan, unveiled days earlier, was a serious thrust, not a feint. Dole had decided to put his eggs in the basket of supply-side economics. Enemies could charge him with inconsistency. Supporters could say that he displayed a Majority Leader's knack for sensing political realities. Whatever the reason, the tax plan and running-mate together brought the party into alignment like a magnet under a paper covered with iron filings. Without the one - two punch, the whole convention, from the Powell speech, to Mrs. Dole's walkabout, to the endless parade of the lame and the halt, to Mark Helprin's well-chosen words, would have seemed a lot more patched-up than it did.
<P>
What about other issues? Abortion was hardly mentioned in San Diego. But Kemp has been pro-life all his career, and he raised the issue himself two days after the convention ended at a rally in Pittsburgh. ``Wherever you stand on the issue of abortion . . . I can't imagine our nation being that city on a hill if we continue to allow the partial-birth abortion tragedy in the United States of America. We're not out to preach. We're out to persuade the American people there is something at stake here . . .'' Focusing on partial-birth abortions stops well short of the GOP's call for a right-to-life amendment, of course. But that hasn't gone anywhere for 16 years. Maybe it's time for pro-lifers to try salami tactics.
<P>
Two issues that have come to the fore since Kemp rose to prominence have been harder to finesse. In 1994 the California ballot contained Proposition 187, the initiative which sought to deny a variety of public benefits to illegal aliens. Kemp campaigned against it, both before and after it passed. ``In my view, that is not what America is all about. . . . I'm speaking from the heart, not politically.'' No kidding. On convention Tuesday, the <I>Los Angeles Times</I> ran a blunt letter, signed by Thomas P. Logan, treasurer of the Concerned Citizens Committee, arguing that Dole's selection of Kemp ``cost him any chance of winning California. . . . Kemp's open opposition to Prop. 187 . . . is still fresh in the minds of many California voters.'' The next day, a more political Kemp told a meeting of the California delegation that ``we have the right to have a sovereign border. We must close the door of illegal immigration so we can keep the front door of legal immigration open.'' Does ``sovereign border'' mean denying benefits? Kemp has said yes, though he has also said he does not want to turn California ``into a police state.'' In any case, he disagrees with Dole's desire, expressed in Congress if not on the campaign trail, to lower legal immigration.
<P>
Kemp has also urged Republicans in recent years not to make affirmative action a warhead issue, lest it give the appearance of racial politicking. So the Kemp pick seemed at first to be a blow to supporters of the California Civil Rights Initiative, or Proposition 209. But Kemp told the California delegation, in the same appearance in which he endorsed border sovereignty, that ``we've got to bring this country together. We can't be divided by class, as the Clinton Administration [and] race-based quotas do.'' Meanwhile, Ward Connerly, chairman of the drive for CCRI, said he had been talking with Kemp ``for about five months. He has always said he is opposed to quotas and preferences. We had to make the case that there were quotas and preferences'' in California.
<P>
Kemp's fundamental problem was evident in the very <I>Wall Street Journal</I> essay which Buckley praised. In it, Kemp called for indexing the capital-gains law, and tying the dollar to a somewhat elastic gold standard. In return for these reforms, he suggested that the Republicans abandon attempts to change welfare. No more wrangles over poverty or taxes; the rising tide will float us all. Kemp ignores, or rejects, the arguments that the welfare system is personally crippling -- that it creates a trap which incentives, however rich, fail to lure people from.
<P>
And so on, almost down the line. Kemp seems incapable of realizing how hard citizenship, civilization, life itself can be. The comment that it is 1776 ``all over the world'' is a fantasy. It could only have been made by someone with no grasp of what a damned close-run thing 1776 was right here: not so much because of enemy power, as because of our own fecklessness, rigidity, sloth. Growth, opportunity, and work are not the only measures of dignity or divinity. In order for opportunity to flourish, it has to be sustained by a web of habits, prohibitions, and prejudices. These in turn always require the support of custom, sometimes of law. When it is a question of the right to life, Kemp sees the need for something beyond the growth mantra (why not support partial-birth abortions, like that good tax-cutter, Gov. Christine Whitman?). On other questions, he is too busy being optimistic.
<P>
Optimism isn't sufficient, but it's necessary, and the Dole campaign wasn't showing much until it brought Kemp aboard. We're in for a lively ride.

<H2>Understanding The Welfare-Reform Bill</H2></CENTER>

<HR>
<P>
NEW YORK, AUGUST 2
<P>














Really, the Newspaper of Record leaves us with the impression that the welfare-reform bill is a declaration of war against the State of New York. There were two front-page stories in the <I>New York Times</I> on Thursday. The first by Robert Pear led, ``After hours of suspense and soul-searching, President Clinton said today that he would sign a bill that reverses six decades of social-welfare policy and touches the lives of tens of millions of people.'' And, alongside, from David Firestone, ``President Clinton's decision yesterday to transform the nation's welfare system left both local officials and welfare advocates gasping at the enormous new costs of public assistance they say will have to be borne by city and state taxpayers.'' 
<P>
And those were mere whispers, auguring the roars of pain and indignation and doom talk from such as Mayor Giuliani and Representative Rangel. And then it was discovered that the New York State Constitution ``guarantees'' relief payments to all its residents on welfare. How will we make these payments? Mayor Giuliani told the press the estimated increase in cost to New York City would be $720 million, and so the city's situation is that general revenues are predicted to increase by 0.3 per cent, but expenditures must now increase by 2 per cent.
<P>
Begin with some elementary mathematics. 
<P>
 -- In 1994 New York State paid to Washington, D.C., $1.26 for every dollar New York received from Washington.
<P> 
 -- That being so, a reduction of one dollar in expenditures by Washington means a reduction in levies on New York of $1.26. 
<P>
 -- Therefore, if New York quite simply took over the welfare burden now handled by Washington, the out-of-pocket cost to New Yorkers would be reduced, not augmented. 
<P> 
 -- About thirty states in the Union receive more money from Washington than they pay out to Washington. If there is cause for concern at a dollar-by-dollar level, it is a concern of those states.
<P>
 -- The thinking behind welfare reform is that welfare payments will decrease, not increase, when the plan takes hold. That reasoning is to some extent speculative, but its basis is experience. Senator Phil Gramm points out that we have spent over $2 trillion on welfare in the past thirty years, and poverty has increased. Most especially, illegitimacy has increased, which is the primary generator of poverty. 
<P>
 -- But of course devolution, which is what this bill is all about, does not lay a hand on the freedom of state legislators to re-enact welfare in the old mode, except that financing will have to come from Albany, not from Washington. This means that Sacramento and Albany are free to choose divers approaches to welfare problems.
<P> 
 -- Senator Moynihan, as often happens, had the most original thoughts on the subject. He began by calling everyone who voted in favor of welfare reform insane (``It is a social risk that no sane person would take . . .''). But he wished to distance himself from the cant-talk of fellow liberals. ``For years, whenever the critics said, correctly, that the welfare system was doing more harm than good, and suggested that it be rethought, its defenders screamed 'racism' and 'slavefare.' They did that until there was no public support left at all. Now they are stunned at what they're getting.'' He went on to name Professor James Q. Wilson of UCLA and John DiIulio of Princeton and William Bennett of Washington as prominent welfare skeptics. ``Typically liberals think otherwise, to the extent that liberals can be said to think at all.'' I wish I had said that. 
<P>
But it is indeed an important moment in American history precisely because it asks the fifty states to take on substantial responsibility for exploring more effective means than we have come up with for helping our forlorn and our wayward. In order to do this, the objective of the individual state has to be to arrest the rate of illegitimacy. The means of achieving this end have been exhaustively explored in this space. The only systematic attention given to the problem has been by the scholarly Charles Murray, and his conclusions are harmonious with those provisions of the welfare-reform bill that stress the desirability of work. (Individual states can waive this requirement, but not with federal money.) And then -- a correlative objective? -- we need to free up education, to encourage learning and skills. We know how to do this, but the First Amendment, as interpreted, has got to cooperate.

Dear Rusty,
<P>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------->


<BR>
<BR>
<P>


We're back!
<P>
Back on the campaign, back on the Big Bus, back doing what we do best: talking in outdoor settings and appearing in television commercials!
<P>
I'm sitting in my hotel suite at the Drake Hotel in Chicago, I've eaten all the raisins out of the mini-bar, and I'm working on my speech to the convention. Everyone's expecting a real Gore-style barnburner, and I can't let them down. In the middle section of my speech, around page 73, I'm going to try to get the convention hall going in a big chant: ``2.3% Reduction in CAF Standards for the Year 2000!'' And later: ``We turned back the clock on topsoil erosion!''
<P>
Get ready to stamp your feet!
<P>
Tipper's asleep on my shoulder. She's been helping me edit my remarks all nightewhat a trouper! Since I've got to get the preliminary draft over to Dr. Morris by tomorrow morning -- something about ``fine tuning the code'' -- I've really got to finish it tonight, and Tip's been very helpful.
<P>
Near the end of the speech, around page 137, I take a swipe at Jack Kemp. ``The vice-presidential nominee of the other party,'' I say, ``wants to bring us back to the gold standard. And you know what that means. More strip mining!''
<P>
Tipper suggested that I cut that part out, but I told her that the American people only fear what they don't understand, and as I went through it with her, she drifted off on my shoulder.
<P>
I'm expecting big-time cheers!
<P>
This whole campaign has me energized like never before, Rusty. I'm giddy.
<P>
First, Bill and I are finally getting to do more stuff together. Rusty, those early days of our administration were great for our friendship. But I've got to admit that as time went on, little things crept in to keep us apart. Our regularly scheduled lunches together -- just Bill and me one-on-one -- fell by the wayside as gays in the military, Travelgate, Nannygate, the first budget battle, David Gergen, Lloyd Cutler, Whitewater, health care, Haiti, the second budget battle, the 1994 election, Whitewater again, Bosnia, the third budget battle, Whitewater again, China and Taiwan, welfare reform, and Whitewater again kept our respective schedules too tight for our weekly bonding.
<P>
Not so these days!
<P>
Last weekend, Bill, HRC, Tipper, and I spent some time in Tennessee rebuilding a church, and let me tell you, it was quality time all around. You don't really know them until you rebuild a church with them, let me tell you. For instance, who would have guessed that HRC is so handy with a nail gun? And even though Bill smashed his own thumb up pretty bad in the first couple of minutes, he spent the rest of the afternoon helping the Gore girls reach up to the ceiling studs.
<P>
Plus, we've been spending a lot of time together strategizing the convention. It's in Chicago this year, which makes sense in an Electoral College sort of way, but is a little risky politically. There hasn't been a Democratic National Convention in Chicago since 1968, and I'm not so sure that we want all 400,000 television viewers to be thinking ``student protests'' and ``hippie draft dodgers'' as they watch Bill get renominated. I think I may have insulted HRC when I asked her to try to remember exactly where she was all those years ago -- I mean, I hate to be the damage-control guy, but if Ted Koppel ever got hold of an old wire photo of the young HRC, all decked out in love beads, flipping some Chicago cop the bird, well, he'd be broadcasting live from Chicago faster than you can say, ``How about this for news?''
<P>
She acted kind of chilly for a few days after I asked, but I think I was right to bring it up. Lucky for us, Bill did his antiwar protesting in Moscow, where photojournalism wasn't so prevalent.
<P>
Other than those few bumps, though, we're cruising to victory in November. Sure, Bob Dole got a ``bounce'' from his convention. That's because it was a totally scripted affair, designed to project a ``tolerant'' and ``big tent'' image of the Republican Party. Dole kept all the pro-life advocates out of sight. Except for him and Jack Kemp, no other pro-lifers spoke; how diverse can a party be when the platform is pro-life, the convention speakers are pro-choice, and the nominees are pro-life? Well, actually, that sounds pretty diverse to me, but you get my point. We're a lot more diverse than they are. I mean, our African-American guy is a socialist. Theirs isn't. And we've got lesbians and gay men and trial lawyers and teachers' unions. Let's face it, Rusty: our tent is the only tent big enough to hold the whole circus.
<P>
Gotta go! Dr. Morris is at the door. The next time I write, Rusty, it'll be from the Big Bus!

2-SEPTEMBER-1996
<P>
Charles Murray reports that illegitimacy increased at record rates in the 1990s. A third of all American births, and 70 per cent of all black American births, are out of wedlock. But hey, we're winning the debate.

The media all but ignored the quadrennial Polympic Games in Washington, D.C., so we'll give you results here as fast as we can make them up. The shocker, of course, was that President Clinton was disqualified in the Prevarathon for that unguarded remark about raising our taxes too much. The judges ruled that he was trying to tell a truth! -- an almost unthinkable lapse. Mr. Clinton had built a seemingly insurmountable lead with ``didn't inhale'' before his tragic stumble.

Republican platform deliberations began with clear victories for pro-life delegates. The Dole campaign wanted to list abortion as an issue of ``personal conscience'' on which Republicans disagree. Despite heavy pressure on delegates -- from convention manager Paul Manafort, among others -- conservatives stood firm: intra-party disagreement would be acknowledged only generically, and vaguely pro-choice language kept out of the platform. Dole apparently thought the presidential nominee's word would be decisive. The price of his hubris was that his bold new tax-cut initiative had to compete for attention with this defeat in the same old intra-mural battle. He would have known better if he had paid attention to recent platform fights -- or, for that matter, to Kate O'Beirne's recent column on ``pro-Dole, out-of-control'' delegates. The next day, repeated attempts by abortion-rights proponents to ``yank the plank'' were defeated by large margins. This was predictable: pro-choice Republicans never organize to win these votes; they take their case to the media instead. They were at pains to declare they were good Republicans who would work hard to elect Dole; California Gov. Pete Wilson even held a press conference to say he would try to force a floor vote if he had to, all in order to help Dole. Only Ann Stone, head of  Republicans for Choice (a wholly owned subsidiary of CNN), was out of step rhetorically: she has taken to promising that November will be ``payback time.'' As we went to press the Dole team was deciding whether to try to placate Wilson and avoid a floor fight by allowing a pro-choice minority report. If Wilson is sincere about having Dole's best interests at heart -- which the nominee's staff doubts -- he can prove it by repudiating Mrs. Stone.

Leading in the Polympic Sword Fall are Hillary Clinton's former law partners Webster Hubbell, Vincent Foster, and William Kennedy; the Clintons' former business partners Jim and Susan McDougal; and former Arkansas Gov. Jim Guy Tucker. However, many Clinton associates have yet to take the big plunge. Keep an eye on Susan Thomases, Maggie Williams, Patsy Thomasson, Bernie Nussbaum, and Bruce Lindsey, among a host of other top contenders, in a field so crowded that we lose count.

For months the media have been going on about a forthcoming revolt by the GOP moderates. Now, at the first test -- the GOP platform debate in San Diego -- there was a successful rebellion: but by conservatives, and on the very issue which the party establishment had sought to obscure and defuse. By a nice coincidence, in the three GOP Senate primaries held on Tuesday, in Michigan, Georgia, and Kansas, the more conservative candidate won in each case. Sam Brownback won handsomely against the moderate Sheila Frahm, who had been appointed to fill the seat Senator Dole vacated in June. (Mr. Brownback's victory was achieved, it must be said, without any help from <B><I>NR</I></B>.) Where Mr. Brownback was vulnerable, notably on immigration, Mrs. Frahm failed to raise the issue. Where he was clearly in tune with the voters, notably on spending cuts, she attacked him as going too far. In other words, Mrs. Frahm was petrified by respectability, more attuned to media liberals than to her conservative constituents, and she is accordingly now a respectable ex-senator. Two conclusions suggest themselves. The conservative wing of the GOP is where the party's energy, passion, and ideas now repose. And moderate Republicans are a <I>nomenklatura</I> without an ideology. Indeed, that is why they appeal to the media.

The Federal Election Commission's complaint against the Christian Coalition -- that its voter guides constitute partisan activity co-ordinated with candidates -- is spurious and likely to fail in court. The operative legal standard here requires literature to include ``express advocacy'' (i.e., words like ``oppose,'' ``vote for,'' or ``defeat'') for it to count as partisan. The Coalition's guides simply inform voters how officials voted on issues of concern to Christian conservatives. If Democrats fare worse than Republicans, it is because of their votes. All the FEC has revealed is its penchant, typical of regulatory bodies, to expand its powers.

Rep. Sue Kelly (R., N.Y.) is part of the Republican fringe that voted against the ban on partial-birth abortions. She is being vigorously challenged by Joe DioGuardi, a right-to-life conservative who used to hold the seat. So it's not surprising that Reps. Bob Dornan (R., Calif.) and Chris Smith (R., N.J.), two of the most committed pro-lifers in Congress, would back DioGuardi. For this crime, the House leadership has come down on them like a ton of bricks. They are being denied legislative-conference seats which their subcommittee chairmanships would normally guarantee them. They were warned that their amendments would not reach the floor (the leadership has backed off on this point). And Smith's travel budget -- he chairs the International Operations and Human Rights subcommittee -- has been cut off. This follows a pattern in the 104th Congress of conservative dissenters being disciplined more harshly than liberal ones. Perhaps Bob Dole could suggest a tolerance plank to the House GOP leadership.

The Dole campaign has found an issue -- marijuana. Pot use among kids is up since Bill Clinton was inaugurated, so vote for Dole. But cocaine use is down; should we therefore vote for Clinton? It is too much to expect the GOP to rethink drug policy in the midst of an election campaign, but certain points -- the medical uses of marijuana; the draconian sentences still being served by casual possessors -- should induce it to show reason on the topic. Sending out Jointman to joust with Buttman keeps the debate on the puerile level favored by the Democrats. If Dole wants to make headway, he will have to focus on policies (e.g., affirmative action) which the Clintonites support when they are stone cold sober.

Much uneasiness among gun-control supporters. Prof. John Lott of the University of Chicago has released a terribly inconvenient study which finds that when law-abiding people are allowed to carry guns, crime drops. His nationwide, 15-year study records an 8.5 per cent drop in homicide, a 5 per cent drop in rape, and a 7 per cent drop in aggravated assault in jurisdictions which permit concealed weapons. Lott observed a slight rise in non-violent crimes, presumably as criminals plied their craft less riskily. Today 36 states now permit concealed weapons, up from 9 states ten years ago, which suggests the common sense underlying Prof. Lott's research has made a bigger impression on state legislators than on gun-control advocates.

Reviewing in the <I>New York Times Book Review</I>, Michael Lind's latest philippic against conservatism, Brent Staples whoops with delight over the author's discovery of the ``hoax'' of mass illegitimacy which, ``along with the idea that welfare causes out-of-wedlock births, is driving virtually all welfare policy.'' If Mr. Lind is right, Mr. Staples's review should have been on the newspaper's front page: <B>MILLIONS OF FATHERS FOUND AT HOME./WOMEN HONEST AFTER ALL./WELFARE REFORM A MISTAKE</B>. Not even the <I>New York Times</I>, however, will run that story because Mr. Lind's conclusion was a . . . fallacy. He pointed out that the rate of black teenagers' having out-of-wedlock babies has remained stable at 80 per 1,000 from 1920 through 1990. On this argument, illegitimate births have risen as a percentage of all births because married couples have fewer children, not because single women have more. Even if that were so, it would still be cause for concern because, unlike the period 1920 - 60, most young blacks today grow up in communities in which illegitimate births (and their attendant ills) are the norm. But it is not so. As Richard Brookhiser points out in <B><I>NR's </I></B> review (page 89), Mr. Lind's own book shows that from 1960 to 1989 expected <I>lifetime</I> births almost doubled for the average unmarried black woman (and almost tripled for the average unmarried white woman). The culprit? Welfare. Until the Sixties, single women might have children outside marriage, but they would then find a father for them and establish a two-parent family. Welfare enables single-parent families to subsist indefinitely while excusing fathers from their duties. The resulting family crisis is, alas, no hoax. And Mr. Staples's ready acceptance of it as one merely shows that fallacies which comfort are harder to detect than those which jar.

In this issue (Letters, page 4), Linda Chavez and John J. Miller seek to drive a wedge between <B><I>NR</I></B> and our economics analyst, Ed Rubenstein, by suggesting that he shares their view that immigration reduces inflation. Alas, they commit an elementary confusion between inflation and inflationary pressures of which Mr. Rubenstein, a staunch monetarist, was not guilty. When wages outstrip productivity (an inflationary pressure), the Fed has a choice: it can either do nothing and watch unemployment rise, or reduce the value of the wage hike by increasing the money supply (inflation). Immigration certainly works to remove this painful dilemma from the Fed -- but at the cost of producing the secondary effects directly. By increasing the supply of labor, immigration either reduces wages, or displaces existing workers, or a little of both. Naturally, anything that cuts wages and hikes unemployment will also tend to reduce inflationary pressures. Perhaps Miss Chavez and Mr. Miller favor other policies that will produce these desirable results. As for their general complaint about NR on immigration, we will happily say something good about them when they produce a good argument.

Word 7.0, the fancy Windows '95 version of Microsoft's popular word processor, has a partisan spellchecker. It recognizes the names Kennedy, Johnson, Carter, and Clinton, but not Nixon (for which it offers to substitute ``Nikon'') or Reagan (``regain,'' ``reign''). Either Bill Gates favors Democrats, or he appreciates that conservatives don't need spellcheckers.

As the Hague Tribunal tries to hale Serbian war criminals before the bar of justice, the world should remember 1) that there are also Muslim and Croat thugs who are being (or should be) pursued; and 2) that most Serbs in the former Yugoslavia have been bystanders of its chaos. The Bosnian agony is the work of former Communist politicians and ideologues, willing to use communal hatreds in order to gain or hold power. And lest we feel too complacent, this is a feature of multi-ethnic regimes with no commonly acknowledged source of authority.

Dr. Jack K. Death presented some of his weird philosophy to the National Press Club, discoursing on Christ ``dying for three or four days'' with all those nails through Him, ugly, <I>ugly</I>. How much more ``dignified'' it would have been, he ventured, ``had Christ died in my van.'' He does, Jack, every time.

 WASHINGTON, D.C.<br>
<FONT SIZE=+3>I</FONT><font size=+1>n</font> the summer of 1994 Ward Connerly, a new regent of the University of California, was visited by Jerry and Ellen Cook. The Cooks' son, a Phi Beta Kappa undergrad, had been accepted to the combined Harvard/ MIT health sciences program, and was one of two California students admitted to Johns Hopkins Medical School. But he was turned away from the medical school at UC San Diego, just around the block from his home, which he hoped to attend to be near his ailing grandparents. The Cooks couldn't believe it. They gathered data from UC medical schools -- Mr. Cook is a statistician -- showing that at the lower grade-point averages and test scores, only preferred minorities were admitted, and that preferred minorities were in the lowest 1 per cent (in terms of GPA and test scores) of accepted students. The numbers, they told Connerly, proved UC was engaged in unconstitutional discrimination.
<P>
Connerly, who had already publicly questioned affirmative action, agreed. For the November regents' meeting, he requested an account of the system's admissions policies from the UC president, who reported back that the affirmative-action policies were necessary because diversity equals excellence and also in order to right the imbalance in medical service to minority communities (minority doctors, presumably, would serve in minority areas). ``I said, If you just change some of the words in here this sounds racist to me,'' Connerly recalls. Meanwhile, he obtained a matrix that served as a guide at UC Berkeley for explicitly scoring applicants by race. The administration denied doing any such thing. ``Yet I had this damn matrix that said they did,'' says Connerly. ``And when I confronted them with it, they said, 'Oh, gee, we forgot that.' The bastards just lied.'' 
<P>
Ward Connerly was getting a crash course in 1990s affirmative action: its victims, its spurious justifications, its protective cocoon of bureaucratic obfuscation and secrecy. Soon he would help enter a new word into the vocabulary of race preferences -- rollback. The low-key Connerly, with his close friend Gov. Pete Wilson providing well-publicized support, succeeded in pushing through measures in July 1995 that eliminated race as a factor in admissions, hiring, and contracting in the UC system. A few months after this high-profile fight had been won, he took the helm of what was then a struggling California Civil Rights Initiative (to be Proposition 209 on the November ballot). Now, not only does the outcome of perhaps the nation's most important election this November depend largely on his managerial and political skills, but his career, motivations, and even personal life have become a crucial part of the battleground.
<P>
CCRI opponents have mounted a well-financed and vicious campaign against the initiative -- the Ford, Rockefeller, and Carnegie Foundations have kicked in $1.5 million. One of the chief targets is Connerly. The <I>Oakland Tribune</I> recently ran an editorial cartoon of a dry-cleaning shop, with Klan capes hanging on the racks, called ``Connerly & Co -- Ethnic-Cleansers.'' But, what seems to threaten CCRI opponents most is that Connerly is black. Their solution: denying he is. Says State Senator Diane Watson of Los Angeles, ``He probably feels this makes him more white than black, and that's what he really wanted to be,'' adding, ``He married a white woman.'' Or as black San Francisco contractor Fred Jordan put it: ``[H]e's a hypocrite of the worst kind. He doesn't particularly want to be called African American or black, but he's using it very astutely to advance his own personal gains. For someone to stand within the ranks and say, 'I'm not black,' but use it to destroy his own people -- that's the kind we brand as a traitor.''
<P>
Connerly's treason goes even deeper, because he has no debts to racial preferences or to the agitations of the post-1964 civil-rights establishment. So, opponents strain to deny this too. One NAACP official told the <I>L.A. Times</I> that Connerly and Clarence Thomas are hypocrites because they ``thump their chest about merit, when neither of them operates in a realm where merit matters. It's political connections.'' In a bitter op-ed in the <I>L.A. Times</I> Richard Russell, president of the California Alumni Association, attributes Connerly's business success entirely to Pete Wilson. ``If I were in Connerly's position, I too might believe that the race card is largely irrelevant and had nothing to do with my successful position.'' Rather than  gratuitous nastiness, this line of argument is essential to defenders of affirmative action -- i.e., no minority makes it in America without special help. 
<P>
But, in Ward Connerly, they have the wrong man; if the personal is political, his life is a perfect preamble to his current position in the public debate. Connerly's parents divorced in 1941 before he was two and his mother died before he was four. He ended up living with a grandmother in an all-black neighborhood in Sacramento. ``There were certain rules that had to be followed,'' he recalls. ``There weren't many, but one of them was study. Before you go anyplace, study.'' There were four kids in his neighborhood who wanted to go to college, only one of whom owned a car. Connerly had the scores to make it into a four-year school, his friend did not. So Connerly asked his boss for a loan. ``[I]f I loan you the money to buy a car,'' he remembers his boss saying, ``[you'll need] insurance and there are going to be a lot of expenses that go with it. I think you're better off just getting by without the car -- you'll find a way.'' His boss did give him a raise. After two years of car-pooling with his friend to American River Junior College, Connerly had saved enough to buy a used '48 Chevy so he could enroll at Cal-State Sacramento.
<P>
<font size=+3>A</font<font size=+1>fter</font> graduating -- the first in his family to do so -- Connerly went to work for Sacramento's re-development agency, then the state housing department. Through his work there he met Pete Wilson, chairman of the State Assembly's new housing committee, who hired him as the committee's chief consultant. The two became fast friends, and Wilson's brand of Republicanism brought Connerly into the party. An early conversation sticks in Connerly's mind. ``He said, 'What are your plans in life?' I said, 'Well, I'll probably go back to the department of housing in some capacity.' He said 'What after that?' I said, 'Well, I'll probably someday become a division chief or something like that.' He said, 'Gee, that's awfully limiting. Haven't you ever considered other possibilities?''' Connerly hadn't. Working in government was a safe haven for blacks. Indeed, when the GOP lost its majority, Connerly landed back at the state housing department.
<P>
It was several more years before Connerly, in February 1973, felt he had enough experience and contacts to make the plunge into the private sector, where his business has been a success (and, <I>pace</I> his critics, has little to do with Wilson's patronage and nothing to do with set-asides). Connerly is 57 years old, balding and unassuming, if blunt. He has been involved in politics, but only as a fund-raiser and informal advisor to Wilson, and so friends were surprised when he splashed onto the front pages with CCRI. His moderate positions on social issues like abortion and gay rights make him an unlikely champion of such a hot-button issue. But Connerly has taken to it with a vengeance. ``He has an innate pro-Americanism that in a way makes him more in league with right-wing conservatives,'' says one CCRI insider. ``I think this has been a radicalizing campaign for him as he's watched some of his moderate allies go wishy-washy.'' Tom Wood and Glynn Custred, the two academics who originated CCRI, first came across Connerly at an August 1994 Assembly hearing on CCRI. ``He stole the show,'' says Wood. ``Glynn and I started plotting immediately on the drive back to the Bay area about how we could get him on board.''
<P>
Connerly initially wasn't interested -- worried primarily about his personal security (he received telephone threats for pushing the UC resolutions). But by the end of 1995 CCRI was on the verge of extinction. It had a couple of professors behind it and a lot of publicity, but little in the way of cash or organization. In November, when it had about three months to get 700,000 signatures, it had only 200,000 and signature gathering had been suspended. Wood and Co. went once again to Connerly, and he agreed to come on board. He and Wilson immediately got on the phone to provide a fund-raising infusion. Connerly, meanwhile, became CCRI's chief spokesman. ``Without Ward and Pete Wilson,'' says Wood, ``CCRI wouldn't have made it on the ballot.''
<P>
Will it pass? The ``no'' forces have the presumptive advantage in any initiative fight. In this case,  opponents are drawing on the resources of myriad organizations on the Left to try to overcome  CCRI's roughly 2 to 1 lead in the polls. Early on, opponents concluded their effort would have to have a white female face. They have indeed shamelessly distorted CCRI's Clause C -- innocuous language meant to exempt institutions like single-sex bathrooms from CCRI's scope -- to argue that the measure legalizes sex discrimination. They also stand to get a boost from a judge's ruling -- under appeal -- that the  relatively innocuous phrase ``affirmative action'' instead of just ``preferential treatment'' must appear in the ballot language. Furthermore, corporations are frightened of CCRI; Connerly recently had to ask Wilson to talk two CEOs out of publicly opposing the initiative (Pacific Gas and Electric has actually come out in opposition). The reaction of the national party has been similar, as Bob Dole appears to have chucked the issue overboard. ``Maybe we should count our blessings,'' Connerly comments dryly.
<P>
But the reaction of national Republicans leaves Connerly in an odd position, reviled by opponents while spurned by those who should be some of his strongest (and most grateful) supporters. ``The Senator Watson stuff isn't as bad as the people that you don't even know who point you out,'' says Connerly. He is often recognized by blacks in airports and elsewhere (whites don't seem to know him yet) who stare at him in disgust. ``You wouldn't be human if you didn't react in some way to that,'' he says. 
<P>
The Republican Party, meanwhile, is not always the most congenial home. Connerly will give speeches at Republican events, get standing ovations, then have a blue-haired lady ask him if he happens to know ``the nicest black man I ever met'' in Philadelphia or somewhere else. ``I just want to grab her,'' Connerly laughs, ``and say, 'Didn't you listen to what I said a few minutes ago? Didn't you listen at all?'''
<P>
<font size=+3>T</font><font size=+1>he GOP</font>'s national leaders aren't listening. ``If there ever was an issue that defines Republicanism . . . this is it,'' he says. ``I just want my party to stand for something.'' In the meantime, the small band of CCRI organizers and a handful of California GOP officials will have to do the standing for it, in the face of a withering opposition. Connerly, who describes himself as ``57 going on 70,'' says he has learned a couple things: 1) ``How truly biased some newspapers are.'' 2) ``You don't have to have facts to attack an initiative.'' 3) ``The voters are terribly uninformed.'' But, Connerly says, a fourth lesson trumps the others. ``There's a certain magic about democracy,'' he says. ``I can go into a room with fifty people and perhaps only one in fifty understands what the issue is really about, but somehow their collective intelligence, not in terms of IQ, but in terms of the values and the instincts they bring, transcends [everything else].'' There's no one in a better position to know all they have to transcend than Ward Connerly.

<H2>The Terrorists' Leverage</H2></CENTER>

<HR>
<P>
NEW YORK, JULY 30
<P>









Whoever did in TWA 800 must be very pleased, which makes one wonder why he has not taken the satisfaction of identifying himself. One can imagine a mafia-style meeting of terrorists in a dacha in Lebanon. One is there from the West Bank, one from Syria, from Iran, from Libya, from Ireland. Maybe a North Korean is there, and then one or two who have privatized the art, a Kaczynski type; maybe a militiaman. They cackle about TWA and one of them gives a little proprietary shrug of the shoulders, which brings from the other end of the table, ``Get off that, Buster-ali. You had nothing to do with TWA.'' Eyes travel to him. Does he mean . . . the credit should go to his organization? 
<P>
Perhaps they simply settle for a sense of common accomplishment. They have undoubtedly committed something that, in their books, would be accepted as a quite exquisite crime. Everyone dead, spectacular attention world-wide, day after day. Two weeks have gone by and those fancy American investigators haven't even established that it was an explosion! And all of America is tensing up! I mean, it's the best scene, maybe, since Dallas. And what are those cocky Americans going to do? 
<P>
Good question. Benjamin Stein wrote a few weeks ago that the primary burden of the underclass in America isn't a lack of food or education or shelter. It is a life of insecurity. Their children at school are bullied, their apartments are time and again burgled (in Albany, Georgia, the husband of the woman killed at the Olympic Games rushed off to the hospital. When he got home he found his house burgled), the drug traffickers corrupt their children, and at night they have to lock themselves in to minimize exposure to violence. The great leverage of violence. The skyjacker's leverage, I called it years ago when the practice began of brandishing a pistol in the face of the pilot and telling him to fly the plane to Havana. 
<P>
We made headway against the hijackers. But we have over that species the advantage of imposing on them the same fate that would have befallen the crew and passengers if the plane had crashed. It was in the interest of the hijackers to keep the plane functioning. And since it had to land somewhere, the odds were always against them. After a while even Castro tired of giving them sanctuary, the United States passed a law authorizing the death penalty for a murdering hijacker, and Americans began funneling their hand luggage through security machines and being frisked when they forgot to empty their pocket of the tin cigar wrapper. 
<P> 
A modus vivendi was achieved. The skyjacking went way down, and Americans added airport security to the general overhead of life in modern times. Now there is what appears a revival of the art, without the foreplay of the skyjacker demanding merely a flight to Cuba or Lebanon. This time around, as with Air India and Pan Am and now TWA, they will settle for simply killing everybody on board. 
<P>
Viewed as nothing more than an abrasion of modern life, the cost is incidental. Catastrophic to the victims and their families, but statistically negligible, not even on the same chart with cigarette smoking or driving while drunk. But the great victory of the terrorist is precisely the progressive burden of air travel. Every American who travels, say, twenty times every year by plane is even now paying the equivalent of five to ten hours of tribute to the terrorists, if you assume 15 minutes to one half hour per flight consumed by security. The prospect is for much much more than that, on international flights especially. They are talking about check-in two or three hours before flight time. Once again, the equivalent of paying a tribute of two hours to an unknown terrorist for exercising the freedom to travel. 
<P>
Can we generate a purposive anger? We can always sit at home and rage against the killers, but that's pretty Platonic stuff, doesn't hurt them a bit if we just steam every time we think of them. 
<P>
There is only one way to apply direct pressure. We know that Syria and Iran and Libya are training terrorists, but we are not in a mood simply to bomb population centers there. We need discriminating targets, and to develop them we need abundant counter-intelligence. The G-7 powers are meeting now to consider retaliatory action. The imagination here should be encouraged. The easiest and most urgent step is a gaudy reward for anyone who will lead us to the terrorist. We know there are two holed up in Libya right now, responsible for the Pan Am Lockerbie incident. Perdicaris-alive-or-Rasuli-dead is the language we should be using with Mr. Qaddafi.

Dear Rusty,
<P>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------->


<BR>
<BR>
<P>

It's been a tumultuous couple of weeks, let me be the first to admit. I'm sitting here in my office, it's late, but I'm too keyed up to go home -- I'm busy channel surfing, waiting for the early editions of the Post and the New York Times.
<P>
I guess this is how big Broadway actors feel on opening night: excited, nervous, thrilled -- you see, Bill announced late this afternoon that he's going to sign the welfare-reform bill, and I can't wait to see how it'll play in the national media.
<P> 
So far, on Inside Politics, we've been getting raves. There's been universal acclaim for the Clinton - Gingrich welfare plan. It'll be tricky, come election time, to help the voters distinguish between ``Clinton - Gingrich'' and ``Dole - Gingrich,'' but hey, that's what we pay those media guys the big bucks for, right? 
<P>
And on the NewsHour with Jim Lehrer, the word has been universally positive, except for one old fuddy-duddy who complained about ``no coherent philosophy,'' but let's be honest, Rusty -- there's no point in having a coherent philosophy if you're not in office. Just ask Jimmy Carter.
<P> 
I've been advocating this move for months -- you know me, Rusty, I was the original New Democrat, back in 1988 -- and for a long time, it was just me and Dick Morris, voices crying in the wilderness. We'd have long meetings in the Oval Office with the full staff -- me, Dick, George Stephanopoulos, Mike McCurry, Donna Shalala, Leon Panetta, and the rest of the gang -- and let me tell you, Rusty, it wasn't easy to win the argument. 
<P>
In the first place, Bill tends to agree with the last person who speaks, and since he calls on people to speak moving clockwise around the room, Dick and I had to keep getting up, pretending to stretch our legs, and sitting down a couple of seats over. That way, the debate would go: me, George, Dick, Leon, me, Donna, Dick, Mike, me, Bob Reich, Dick . . . and then we'd try to time it just right so that the conversation always ended with either me or Dick. 
<P>
It didn't look too natural. George caught on early, I think, because when Dick or I would get up to stretch our legs or ``get another Diet Coke,'' George would always get up too, ``to smooth out my pants,'' he'd say, but I noticed that he kept sliding down the couch, always trying to be the last one. 
<P>
At this afternoon's meeting -- the last one before Bill was supposed to announce his decision -- Dick very cleverly head-faked George by half-standing, then sitting down very quickly right next to Bill before George had a chance to slide completely over. There they were, slammed next to each other, shoulders touching, legs fighting for seat-cushion turf, pushing hard against each other until finally Dick, who has a lot more bulk, managed to squeeze George off the couch and onto the floor.
<P> 
And that's pretty much how welfare reform got signed into law. It was thrilling, let me tell you. 
<P>
Bill and I headed down to the briefing room while Dick got George into a half-nelson and stuffed a cushion into his mouth. I felt sorry for the guy, but I also knew that if he got so much as ``a million kids on the street'' out, Bill would get that quizzical look on his face, postpone the decision, and we'd still be nervous about Bob Dole.
<P> 
The only problem right now is HRC. She was down in Georgia when Bill called her.
<P>
``Hillary,'' he said into the phone, twisting the cord into a thousand loops, ``I've decided to back the House welfare reform.'' 
<P>
He winced a bit, and held the phone away from his ear for a few moments. 
<P>
He listened for a few seconds, then looked up. ``She wants to know if we can fix it later, after I'm re-elected,'' he said to Dick Morris. 
<P>
Dick shook his head and mouthed, ``No way.''
<P>
Bill nodded. ``Dick says, 'Of course we can,' Hillary. He's calling this a 'tactical center-shift.''' 
<P>
He winced again, held the phone away again.
<P>
``Okay, then, have it your way,'' he said. ``It's a 'tactical shift to the far right.' But I think we're just playing semantics.'' 
<P>
More wincing. 
<P>
``Hillary,'' he said into the phone, ``we're still very much in favor of partial-birth abortions. That should count for something.'' 
<P>
A few moments later, he hung up. ``She'll come around,'' he said. ``She's always said that in the second term, the gloves come off.''
<P> 
Rusty, the interns just brought in the Post and the Times. We're a hit! ``A masterful stroke,'' croons the Post. ``Brilliant leadership,'' cries the Times. ``Two thumbs up!'' say Shields and Gigot.
<P> 
Who knew being conservative was so . . . so popular? 
<P>
See you in Chicago!

12-AUGUST-1996
<P>

<LI>Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic has agreed to stay in his house and take no part in the upcoming Bosnian elections. Considering how Dole is doing, can we make the same deal with him?

The House Republican leadership has ended a year of wavering about the Dole - Canady anti-preference bill with a pre-emptive surrender. Instead of attempting to abolish race and gender preferences in federal programs, employment, and contracting, the GOP will target its attack on the Small Business Administration's Section 8(a) program. The program is, to be sure, a noxious mix of racial preference, corporate welfare, and administrative inefficiency. The General Accounting Office reports that 1 per cent of certified firms receive a quarter of the business under the program; less than 9 per cent of contracts are awarded competitively; and less than 4 per cent of 8(a) firms become ``competitive.'' Some Hill Republicans think this program is analogous to partial-birth abortions, as being among the least defensible products of modern liberalism. But the power of the partial-birth-abortion issue was that it brought the abortion debate down from abstraction. When it comes to preferences, the public is already in tune with Republicans on broad principle. The debate should take place there, not at the level of eye-glazing bureaucratic detail. The retreat also opens Republicans to the charge of tolerating reverse discrimination against all Americans except the owners of corporations. Finally, while many liberals voted for the partial-birth-abortion ban, they are sure to fight any affirmative-action rollback -- especially since they can sense the GOP's fear.  ``On this issue the Republican leadership has been spinning around like a weather vane in a hurricane,'' says Rep. Charles Canady (R., Fla.), who, along with Susan Molinari (R., N.Y.) and Chris Cox (R., Calif.), has stood on principle. It is ground they share with the American people -- if not, alas, with Newt Gingrich and Dick Armey.

When Democratic congressional leaders unveiled their ``Families First'' agenda last month, it was hailed by some as evidence of the party's newfound moderation on size-of-government and social issues, and derided by others as a pale imitation of the Contract with America. But it turns out that even when they try to present their best face to the public, New Democrats still have to placate the same Old Left constituencies. Among their agenda's 21 planks was a little-noticed call for ``fair pay'' and ``pay equity'' -- the current code-phrases for ``comparable worth,'' that golden oldie of late-Seventies feminism. The idea, remember, was that equal pay for men and women doing the same jobs wasn't enough, because men and women congregate in different fields. So occupations dominated by women should pay the same wages as ``comparable'' work in other fields; e.g., secretaries should be paid like lab technicians. Determining the proper compensation for each job would, naturally, require heroic efforts by lawyers, bureaucrats, and assorted experts. ``Families First'' is slippery about all this, as befits a party being remade in Bill Clinton's image. The Democrats want the Secretary of Labor to develop ``voluntary fair pay guidelines for the nation's employers'' and to hold a National Summit on Fair Pay to devise ``a specific legislative action plan for Congress to better achieve fair pay in American workplaces.'' The upshot is unmistakable: for 1990s Democrats, moderation means central planning with a feminist face.

Republicans scored a few victories in last year's appropriations process -- e.g., when they zeroed out programs like the Women's Educational Equity Act. The twenty-year-old program exists to make congressmen feel righteous about their opposition to girls' scoring poorly in math, while allowing feminists to funnel dollars to their brethren and sistren in the field: $91,000 to Wellesley's Center for Research on Women, $139,000 to Educational Equity Concepts, Inc., for a program on ``Gender-Based Teasing and Bullying in Grades K - 5,'' and so on. Since Republicans are in the ``two steps back'' stage of their revolution, it should come as no surprise that 101 House Republicans voted to restore $2 million for the act, their consciences pricked by Nita Lowey (D., N.Y.) and Connie Morella (R., Md.). Cheers at Wellesley. But for taxpayers not in residence at a women's studies program, the vote is another sign that they need this limping GOP Congress like a fish needs a bicycle.

At a Washington dinner hosted by <B><I>NR</I></B>, Richard Lamm came across as a genial and intellectually curious presidential candidate lost in a minor party. Not everyone will warm to his can't-do collectivism, but on some issues -- notably entitlements and immigration -- his views coincide with those of most conservatives. While he's unlikely to win the Reform Party's nomination, let alone the Presidency, his candidacy is among the many portents of a potentially dramatic realignment of American politics if the GOP continues to falter. Mr. Lamm is a serious man whose arguments deserve a hearing (more than can be said of his rival, Ross Perot).

In the July 15 <I>New Yorker</I>, James Stewart reports that Whitewater prosecutor Ken Starr is ``highly unlikely'' to seek high-profile indictments before the November elections. Mr. Starr says that the effect of charges on the political process is ``a powerful counsel for restraint.'' We hereby file a motion to reconsider. A prosecutor's duty is to bring indictments when he thinks the evidence justifies them, neither sooner nor later. Withholding indictments until after the election would politicize the prosecution as much as deliberately seeking to indict before the election. And it could be far worse for the country. The least desirable outcome would be for damaging revelations to surface at the opening of a second term, when congressional Democrats might be ready to dispense with Mr. Clinton. One Watergate was enough.

The Office of Management and Budget now predicts a $117-billion deficit for this fiscal year. That's $29 billion less than the Administration forecast only a few months ago. A great vindication of Clinton's fiscal policy? Or did Congress have something to do with it? The 104th Congress was the first in nearly thirty years to make real cuts -- not phony ``baseline'' cuts -- in discretionary spending. Admittedly, this was not a surgical operation; the government shutdown and continuing resolutions played major roles. But we'll take it: federal spending will fall to 21.3 per cent of gross domestic product this year, en route to an 18.8 per cent share (and balance) by 2002. Meanwhile, federal revenues are still on the up escalator. At 19.7 per cent of GDP, this year's tax burden is the heftiest since the recession of 1982. (Wall Street, please note.) If we dodge a deep recession, a zero deficit in 2002 is in the cards. Then the real problems start. When the baby-boomers retire, Medicare and Social Security will drive federal spending to unprecedented levels. Outlays could reach 37 per cent of GDP by 2030, according to the Bipartisan Commission on Entitlements. The deficit? An astounding 18.5 per cent of GDP in 2030. Hold the champagne.

On July 17, 4 Senators and 37 Representatives filed suit to compel the Clinton Administration to comply with the 1996 Defense Authorization Act. Title II of that Act, which covered ballistic-missile defense, required the Pentagon to develop and deploy the Army's Theater High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) and the Navy's Theater-Wide Defense (TWD) according to a definite timetable. Whereupon Secretary of Defense William Perry declared that he had no intention of doing so. When President Nixon refused to spend funds as appropriated, his attempted ``impoundment'' provoked storms of outrage. ``Dangerous . . . no justification . . . unconstitutional,'' thundered then-Rep. Abner Mikva -- lately a Clinton White House Counsel. Yet the Clinton Administration gives no excuses or explanations; it simply refuses to comply with the law. Hats off to Rep. Floyd Spence, chairman of the House National Security Committee and leading plaintiff in <I>Spence</I> v. <I>Clinton</I>, and to Sens. Jon Kyl and Strom Thurmond, Reps. Bob Livingston and Curt Weldon, and others who defended ballistic-missile defense and the law.

Northern Ireland is again in crisis after Protestant Orangemen sought permission to march alongside a nationalist Catholic housing development on Garvaghy Road in the small town of Portadown. Local Catholics, led by an ex-IRA man who had bombed a Protestant hall, objected, predicting violence. So the Northern Ireland chief constable -- a Dubliner -- forbade the march, and thousands of policemen dutifully held the Orangemen back while militant Protestants elsewhere almost closed Northern Ireland down, causing scores of Catholics to flee their homes. Tens of thousands of Orangemen converged on Garvaghy Road, causing the chief constable to capitulate. He allowed a small and silent party of Orangemen to march, while policemen cleared the way, now using batons against protesting Catholics. Nationalist areas promptly erupted in a vengeful fury. Dublin blamed London for going easy on Protestants and hard on Catholics, but there is no simple way to subdue a majority community in insurrection without intolerable bloodshed. All policy in Northern Ireland risks making one side uneasy, and the Protestants, nervous since the Anglo-Irish agreement of 1985, and increasingly frightened of being sold down the river, cracked first. Their violence, appalling though it was, showed once again how a concession to one side will trigger violence from the other. If Protestants will go this far to let a few Orangemen walk down Garvaghy Road, to what lengths will they go to stay out of a united Ireland?

Is there a better television journalist than ABC's John Stossel?

The program's highlight was Stossel's interview with Gilbert Casellas, the chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Casellas: ``The law's fairly clear, it's fairly simple.'' Stossel: ``If you come to me applying for a job, and your arm's in a sling, can I ask you why your arm is in a sling?'' Casellas: ``You can ask -- you know what?

 WASHINGTON, D.C.<br>
<FONT SIZE=+3>A</FONT><font size=+1>t first</font> only members of the House Ways and Means Committee wanted to send President Clinton a stand-alone welfare-reform bill. For months, the Republican strategy had been to combine welfare reforms with changes to the Medicaid system that President Clinton couldn't stomach, guaranteeing a Clinton veto of the welfare - Medicaid package (in what could be his third veto of welfare legislation). But Ways and Means members, after more than a year of labor, were anxious to see their handiwork become law. Committee members John Ensign (R., Nev.) and David Camp (R., Minn.) circulated a letter to the leadership in June asking that the House pass a welfare bill stripped of the Medicaid veto-bait. It got about fifty signatures. Speaker Newt Gingrich opposed the idea, hoping to give the Dole campaign an opportunity to attack Clinton over a third welfare veto. But, soon, it would be a lost cause.
<P>
Rep. Jimmy Hayes (R., La.), one of last year's party-switchers, convinced Majority Leader Dick Armey at a June meeting in the Ways and Means room of the Capitol that Clinton would have to veto even a stand-alone bill or risk infuriating his base. Meanwhile, it seemed increasingly senseless for the House to try to protect the interests of a floundering Dole campaign. If Congress passed a bill the President could sign, Members would get credit back home for a major accomplishment. ``The campaign wasn't scoring points on welfare anyway,'' explains one party official. When Ensign and Camp wrote another letter, they got more than a hundred signatures just by walking onto the House floor. House leaders weren't sure they could pass even the procedural ``rule'' -- typically a party-line vote -- for a bill keeping welfare and Medicaid together. The two would have to be split  -- and the Dole campaign would have to fend for itself.
<P> 
The decision to send Clinton a welfare bill he might sign is emblematic, not only of a potential major rift between congressional Republicans and the Dole campaign, but of the way the weakness of the campaign feeds further weakness; it prompts the GOP to throw good politics after bad. No Republican  wins from the welfare decision. If the President signs a bill, Dole loses irrevocably one of the GOP's traditional top three issues (taxes, crime, welfare). Getting anything other than a watered-down bill through Senate moderates, meanwhile, is always a dicey proposition (some Ways and Means members, privately banking on a second Clinton term, argue that <I>any</I> bill passed this year is the best chance at reform this century). Finally, House Republicans may well find that disarming Dole on a major issue would ultimately hurt more than their ``accomplishment'' helps. ``Any guy who is in a marginal district who thinks he needs welfare to boost him,'' argues a top Senate staffer, ``doesn't realize that . . . if Bob Dole is not doing well, it doesn't matter -- he sinks without a trace.''
<P>
But Capitol Hill Republicans, understandably, aren't in the mood for being team players. The feeling, according to one long-time congressional aide, is reminiscent of 1992, ``when we were getting bashed on the fairness issue, [and] Republicans kept waiting for the Bush campaign to rescue them. Finally we realized the cavalry wasn't going to come over the hill.'' This year no one is expecting a charge of the Dole brigade. ``People have given up,'' says a senior House leadership staffer. ``They're looking at Dole and he's awful. He's a nothing. He's a zero.'' It is only July, with the public more focused on Dan O'Brien's long jumps than Bob Dole's flip-flops. But if the Dole campaign continues to drift, congressional Republicans will resort to more free-lancing like the welfare - Medicaid split. Another House aide gives Dole a few more weeks to find his voice, but ``if he doesn't, it's going to be CYA, baby.''
<P>
<font size=+3>I</font><font size=+1>F</font> House Republicans abandon Dole, it will be a sort of rough justice -- since Dole left them first. In a June interview with the <I>Washington Times</I>, Dole gave House freshmen the back of his hand: ``Those people who voted for you [freshmen] want you to do, but they don't want you to do it so fast'' (sic). His bumbling reversal on the assault-weapons ban cut the legs out from under House members who had made a tough vote to repeal the ban in order to keep the gun-rights portion of the GOP base happy. Dole, of course, was working at cross-purposes, trying to distance himself from that same base (and succeeding -- only 62 per cent of Republicans support him, according to recent polls). The strategy is the mirror image of Clinton's ``triangulation,'' which works for the President because what his core supporters represent is unpopular with the rest of the country. Dole, on the other hand, dampens his own party's enthusiasm by eschewing the very issues with which Republicans win swing voters (abortion, affirmative action, etc.).
<P>
Compounding the strategic divergence is the Dole campaign's organizational disarray. Speaker Gingrich convenes weekly Thursday-morning meetings with top staff  from the campaign committees, Sens. Spence Abraham (Mich.) and Paul Coverdell (Ga.) and Reps. Bob Franks (N.J.) and Jennifer Dunn (Wash.) -- all former state party chairmen -- to talk about the shape of the national GOP campaign. At first a representative of the Dole campaign would attend the meeting. Lately, the campaign has been AWOL. For Hill offices, trying to reinforce the Dole message -- assuming there is one -- is often a shot in the dark; it's easier to find out what the White House will be doing in days ahead than the Dole campaign. A schedule of coming events produced by the RNC for the Gingrich meetings has a column for the Dole campaign -- sometimes left nearly blank.
<P>
There have been daily morning conference calls between communications offices on the Hill and Dole communications staff. But, explains one GOP press officer, it has become increasingly clear that staff-level co-ordination is a waste of time as long as the Dole campaign is ``a rudderless ship.'' So the House has revamped its own communications apparatus around daily meetings involving Gingrich, other members of the leadership, National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Bill Paxon, and Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich. In a kind of communications whip effort, the members will decide who among congressional Republicans can help deliver a daily message. Officially, the new structure has nothing to do with Dole, but privately some House aides describe it as a way of going alone -- until the campaign catches up.
<P>
Congressional Republicans share some of the blame for the GOP's funk. For one thing, over the last two years they have reinforced Dole's natural aversion to tax cuts. Jack Kemp, Sen. Trent Lott, Sen. Connie Mack, Dick Armey, and Newt Gingrich -- the so-called ``amigos'' -- have recently focused with more energy on how to get the party back on the growth track. One idea (which has already been carried out) was a Hill conference on the slow pace of the Clinton recovery.  A useful by-product of the activity is preparing the ground for a Dole tax cut (both Donald Rumsfeld and Vin Weber, two tax-cutters in the Dole camp, have been involved).
<P>
The House GOP has also abetted Dole's punt on race preferences. The campaign's unwillingness to talk about the California Civil Rights Initiative approaches insanity; in recent polling by California assembly candidates, Dole was losing by about 10 points in two swing districts in Long Beach, while CCRI was winning by 30. But the House has followed Dole's affirmative-action retreat with alacrity.
<P>
The irony is that if Congress goes its own way it may become even more timid. Republicans do best when campaigns are nationalized around a few polarizing issues. But with the Dole campaign showing little interest in that kind of campaign, congressional Republicans will be forced back on traditional incumbent campaigns, emphasizing their bi-partisan accomplishments (a marked contrast to 1994, when confrontational Republicans defined Clinton as a liberal). Welfare is one example. The other is health care, with Republicans likely to jettison their attempt to get Medical Savings Accounts in a rush to pass a version of the Kassebaum -  Kennedy regulation bill that the President can sign. If this strategy worked in the past for congressional Democrats -- natural deliverers of pork, from local water projects to the various benefits of the welfare state -- it's not so clear it will be a boon to Republicans, especially if a Dole campaign constitutes a huge drag from the top.
<P>
GOP congressmen are counting on a variety of buffers from a Dole campaign downdraft. One is money. The Republican campaign committees have huge money leads over their Democratic counterparts and so will many individual Republican incumbents (although union spending vitiates this advantage somewhat). Another is candidates. When the parties were recruiting congressional candidates the political environment still favored Republicans, and it shows. Third and last is geography. A Dole debacle could kill Republicans in tough Northeastern districts, but the big GOP gains last year were concentrated in the South, where Republicans stand to make more headway no matter what. Some on the Hill even talk of ``reverse coattails,'' drumming up enough turn-out in their own districts to carry Dole. Would that it were possible. Says political analyst Stu Rothenberg: ``That's not just wishful thinking, that comes from the Land of Oz.''
<P>
The bad news is that straight-ticket voting is on the rise. ``People aren't going to turn out and vote for Bill Clinton and [vulnerable Kentucky freshman] Ed Whitfield,'' says one party official. ``That's just not going to happen.'' Columnist Robert Novak projects that, if the election were held today, there would be a 50 - 50 split in the Senate. If Dole loses by more than eight points, the GOP majority in the House could begin to fade too.
<P>
There is still time for the political environment to change. An over-confident Clinton could veto welfare reform. The Dole tax package could be bold enough to energize his party. But, whatever happens, there's no avoiding Bob Dole. A stampede to desert him, further demonstrating his weakness and contributing to a still larger loss, will ultimately hurt the deserters. For Republicans, the Dole campaign is like a bad dream, filled with hints of impending doom, but no opportunity for escape.

<H2>Zounds! Enforcing The Law in Idaho!</H2></CENTER>

<HR>
<P>
NEW YORK, JULY 9
<P>




The <I>Wall Street Journal</I> reports on Gem County in Idaho, which is conducting a daredevil experiment with the law, by enforcing it. Sitting in the statute books all these years is a little derelict that says that ``any unmarried person who shall have sex with an unmarried person of the opposite sex shall be found guilty of fornication.'' The county prosecutor whose bright idea was to apply the law didn't do so indiscriminately. To have done this would of course have meant to repeal the Playboy Philosophy, and nobody thinks himself grand enough or powerful enough to accomplish that. But Mr. Douglas Varie decided to focus on just one aspect. Teenage pregnancy.
<P>
As everybody (almost everybody) knows, there is such a thing as prosecutorial discretion, which means that you can't defy the cop who stops you for speeding on the grounds that he didn't stop the other guy for speeding. There are exceptions. If prosecutorial conduct bumps into the civil-rights laws, then intervention by the courts can be tried. If only Hispanics or women are stopped for speeding, they can complain and get a hospitable hearing.
<P>
But Mr. Varie didn't start snooping around in motels or parking lots overlooking the scenic splendors of the State of Idaho. He started looking for pregnant teenagers. In fact, he narrowed the search still further. He has been looking for pregnant teenagers who apply for welfare.
<P>
Having done this, he then looks for the feller who got the girl in the family way. And although this is often another teenager, sometimes it is not, for instance in a recent case in which the stud, Michael Hopkins, was 22 years old. The penalty for lewd and lascivious behavior can be life imprisonment. Nobody expects this to happen, but the mere thought of it might interfere with Michael's cocksureness in future encounters. (One pregnant girl was sentenced to thirty days for a misdemeanor and she was quite shocked by the severity of the sentence.) The prosecutor pointed out that the community had every right to be shocked at the prospect of a child being born out of wedlock, which increases by a very high percentage the probability that that child will end up in prison, on welfare, illiterate, and on drugs.
<P>
Needless to say, the American Civil Liberties Union has got into the act, though it isn't absolutely clear what case it has. The prosecutor asked the general question: Does the community intend to enforce the law against statutory rape? This is defined as sexual encounters with girls under a certain age. What does one do, he asked, in a situation in which a 15-year-old girl is made pregnant by a 22-year-old man, and declines to charge her companion with rape? The common-law provision in such cases is to pronounce any sexual intercourse with under-age girls as that exactly  -- rape. And whatever ambiguities beset the law when deciding whether sexual congress took place, there aren't any when the girl is pregnant.
<P>
The Idaho experiment reminds us once again of a paradox in the development of social practices in free societies. It is that these societies suffer from heavy criticism of their toughness (the Darwinian reproach) but shrink from getting the benefits from toughness. We terribly much want American children to learn to read and write, and we offer them public facilities in which to learn how to do this. But if they refuse to learn, we do -- nothing. We very much desire that youngsters not band together in gangs that harass innocent people, but on the whole, we do nothing about them. We terribly want boys and girls not to create children doomed to neglect, 
but far from discouraging such activity, we subsidize it.
<P>
A free society is one that in most cases imposes penalties by its own devices. If you start a mousetrap factory and produce a product less successful than that of your competitors, what happens is that you go broke. The people who work for you lose their jobs, you lose your capital, and the empty factory building is auctioned off. But if you create one of the one million children born out of wedlock every year, you pass along the welfare cost to the government and, as often as not, produce another child. Mr. Varie thinks that is not a good idea and has come up with the ingenious solution of activating, in however diluted form -- the law. Very much worth watching, Gem County.

SLOTUS: Al, look at things realistically. Ken Starr is not going to go to the Grand Jury before October, and they won't return indictments until mid-November at the earliest. David Brock's book is going to come out after Labor Day. And Dole's chief strategist seems to be Dr. Kevorkian.<br> 

VPOTUS: What's your point, Tip?<br>

SLOTUS: My point is, when you get stood up by a world leader, well, it makes you and the office of the Vice President seem inconsequential. The whole thing reeks of . . . Mondale. Or worse: Bush.<br>

VPOTUS: Tipper, if I may, I'm pretty much regarded as a kind of ``co-president.''<br>

SLOTUS: Wake up and smell the coffee, Al. He doesn't need you to look presidential any more. Somehow, some way, he did it himself.<br>

VPOTUS: Well, that's great news! I'm thrilled! What terrific news! Really! Just terrific!<br>

SLOTUS: He's 27 points ahead of Dole in California.<br>

VPOTUS: [Expletive deleted!]<br>

SLOTUS: Now they want you and me to take a ``power walk'' together on Good Morning America to demonstrate the Surgeon General's new guidelines for exercise.<br>

VPOTUS: Actually, that sounds like fun.<br>

SLOTUS: Al, they don't mean it to be fun. They want to diminish your role. It helps you-know-who look more presidential.<br>

VPOTUS: How do you know this?<br>

SLOTUS: I went to last week's strategy meeting in the Yellow Room.<br>

VPOTUS: You went to a Yellow Room meeting? Wow! Tipper, how did you get in? They don't even let Hillary in those.<br>

SLOTUS: Never mind.<br>

VPOTUS: Tipper -- I demand to know how you talked your way into a closed and very private campaign strategy meeting.<br>

SLOTUS: I didn't talk my way in. And I didn't sneak in. I walked in, Al. I walked straight in.<br>

VPOTUS: What?<br>

SLOTUS: Okay, okay. I was dressed as a maid.<br>

VPOTUS: Honestly, Tipper! Dressing up as a maid! You make me feel like Ricky Ricardo!<br>

SLOTUS: You know, Richard Berke of the New York Times was a lot more grateful for the information than you are.<br>

VPOTUS: Okay, Tipper. What did you hear?<br>

SLOTUS: First, no bus trip after the convention.<br>

VPOTUS: Oh, man! I loved that bus trip!<br>

SLOTUS: Also, you're only allowed a short speech. And you've got to make a lot of attack speeches.<br>

VPOTUS: Who am I? Spiro Agnew?<br>

SLOTUS: That's what I said at the meeting. And then everyone turned and looked at me. And Dick Morris asked my name. I scooted out pretty fast.<br>

VPOTUS: Do you think they recognized you?<br>

SLOTUS: C'mon. It's the White House. You know how lax security is over there. And I snuck back in after the meeting to see if they had left any strategy memos around.<br>

VPOTUS: Had they?<br>

SLOTUS: Hard to tell. Those Clinton people are so messy. Too bad I was dressed as a maid. I had to spend an hour cleaning up after them. Just as I was about to leave, Bill stuck his head into the room. He said ``Tipper?'' I just about died!<br>

VPOTUS: Oh no! What did you do?<br>

SLOTUS: I froze. Then I heard her voice from the hallway. ``Tip her?'' she said. ``Why should we tip any of them?'' And he nodded and shuffled off. Thank God those people are so rough on the help.<br>

VPOTUS: I'm coming home, Tipper. You're getting into too much trouble.<br>

SLOTUS: Then I better get out our power-walking shoes. [Static.] [END INTERCEPT]

It crept across the country with July Fourth's summer dawn -- the stunning realization that the <I>Wall Street Journal</I> editorial page had yet again flinched from repeating its once-traditional annual call for a constitutional amendment proclaiming ``There Shall Be Open Borders.'' Indeed, there was no triumphalist immigration editorial at all. Mothers hushed crying children. Fathers gathered in grim groups under the bunting-bedecked pictures of Julian Simon crossing the Delaware and Emma Lazarus producing the Declaration of Independence from an Ellis Island steamer trunk. Everyone had accepted that the Journal edit page had to duck in 1994, in the (vain) hope of lulling Californians into not voting for Proposition 187's ban on welfare for illegal immigrants. And in 1995, of course, the edit page had to give priority to its (successful) disinformation campaign against the Smith - Simpson immigration-reform bills. But 1996? Were the <I>Journal</I> edit pagers demoralized by the devastating Rand Corporation report confirming that many recent immigrants are indeed failing in the economy? Humiliated at being singled out by Peter Passell, in his judicious column on the Rand report in the <I>New York Times</I>, because of their embarrassing hostility to evidence? Say it ain't so, Bob Bartley!

When Katie Couric asked Bob Dole if he thought C. Everett Koop had been ``brainwashed'' by the liberal media, he replied, ``Probably a little bit.'' Talk of brainwashing has no place in American politics, Mr. Dole. As Daniel Patrick Moynihan once remarked, a light rinse would have done the trick.

The Census Bureau is debating whether to create a new racial category for the 2000 census -- ``multiracial.'' A recent government phone survey suggested that 1.6 per cent of Americans identify themselves in that way. Racial intermixing is actually much more widespread; up to three-quarters of black Americans have at least one white or Indian ancestor. (Jesse Jackson, for instance, has some of each.) What effect would a new category have? To the extent that it broke down the rigid black - white color lines of slavery, Jim Crow, and affirmative action, it would be a good thing. But if it added another preferred class of citizens (like ``Hispanic'' class, created by the Bureau several censuses back), then it would be one more step to Bosnia, from sea to shining sea. Here's a question: How many federal policy-makers identify themselves as ``Americans''?

The Consumer Products Safety Commission celebrated the Glorious Fourth by blowing up a watermelon. Its message -- we think -- was not for you to blow up watermelons too, but not to blow yourself up when you set off a July 4th watermelon. Or something. Bureaucracy is like that.

<I>Independence Day</I> is, as anyone who has been on this planet knows, a rip-roaring tale of alien invasion. More surprisingly, it is also a showcase for belief in ``Area 51,'' a top-secret base in Nevada where some think (yes they do) that the government carries out experiments on downed UFOs. <I>Independence Day</I> is science fiction, so perhaps this is to be expected. <I>The Rock</I>, however, is not science fiction; it is an action movie dominated by heavily armed men fighting for control of Alcatraz. Yet even this film reveals that a flying saucer really did crash near Roswell, New Mexico. What next? Alien ``greys'' near the grassy knoll? E.T., phone Stone.

At presstime passage of a minimum-wage increase looks like a done deal, while the prospects for health-insurance regulation are in doubt. And that is all that's on the agenda of this Republican Congress: destroying low-wage jobs and the individual insurance market. This situation is the natural consequence of GOP paralysis on economic policy. Rep. Bill Archer (R., Tex.), chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, recently illustrated how even conservative Republicans have reverted to a pre-Reagan mode. Commenting on proposals for a 15 per cent across-the-board tax cut, he said, ``I don't know where you get those spending savings that can be approved'' in the House and Senate. In other words, we don't have the political will for spending cuts, and we won't be ``irresponsible'' and cut taxes without them. Republicans let their deficit obsession box them in, and superficially appealing but destructive proposals filled the vacuum. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and his colleagues must reassert control over the political agenda. Or else what's a majority for?

Meanwhile, anyone who enjoys a good culture clash really ought to have been present in London last week, when Pat Buchanan addressed a roomful of Tory Party luminaries, right-wing British journalists, and assorted plutocrats, together with a sprinkling of members of the leisured upper classes and Taki. The event was a black-tie dinner, given by Jimmy Goldsmith, the billionaire and fierce advocate of protectionism; the venue was Spencer House, the lush eighteenth-century London mansion once owned by the family of the Princess of Wales. After dinner, Buchanan gave more or less the same sort of speech he would give to a group of steelworkers in Michigan. In short, he impressed all those present with his energy, his command of statistics (the British do not bother with statistics) and ability to speak without notes (this is still a country which respects and admires extemporaneous speaking), and his condemnation of the European Union, an organization he (rightly) puts in the same category as the United Nations. Most of his listeners, however, found his economics perplexing, if not, in the words of one guest, ``insane.'' The British, and British Tories in particular, believe very deeply that they have historically been the beneficiaries of free-trade policies. No upstart American was going to change their minds in one evening. But a good time was had by all, and Buchanan certainly made the best joke. He would not make any comments about President Clinton, he said: it is customary for American politicians not to insult the President while abroad -- and certainly not while he's on active military duty.

The expose by retired FBI agent Gary Aldrich has prompted much self-flagellating introspection by media elites who regret the attention they've given a book whose most explosive charge is wholly unsubstantiated. The allegation that Bill Clinton sneaks over to the Marriott for illicit liaisons is apparently a rumor passed to Aldrich by conservative author David Brock, who is shocked, <I>shocked</I>, that it was reported as fact in <I>Unlimited Access</I>. Of course, the media haven't been so squeamish about second-hand sources in the past. Brent Bozell of the Media Research Center reminds us that the media widely reported George Bush's alleged affair and similarly unsubstantiated charges by Kitty Kelley, and Anita Hill easily met the media's reliability test. Aldrich's book suffers from the animus he clearly feels toward Clinton staffers whom he views as uncouth and disrespectful. He can be forgiven for disliking disagreeable people, but his outrage over the irresponsible behavior of the ``Arkansas mafia'' in the White House gets the better of his novice editorial judgment. Regrettably, his credible first-hand accounts of the Clintonites' disregard for national security has been lost in the media barrage against his unreliable sources. To discredit the book, the Administration has called it a right-wing conspiracy led by the Dole campaign. But the notion of Dole conspiring with right-wingers is far more fantastic than the notion of the President slipping out to a hotel.

The National Education Association congregated in Washington, D.C., to congratulate itself on a job ill done and to endorse -- surprise -- President Clinton for re-election. But it wasn't all a love fest. A proposal to endorse a ``Lesbian and Gay History Month'' for all of America's schools was struck down, its advocates placated with a resolution opposing all forms of ``discrimination and stereotyping.'' The NEA also resolved that ``efforts to legislate English as the official language disregard cultural pluralism, deprive those in need of education, social services, and employment, and must be challenged.'' At least they practice what they preach.

The Libertarian Party also convened in Washington over the July 4th holiday, nominating investment expert Harry Browne as its presidential candidate. Twenty-five years after the birth of the party, Browne believes that the ``American people are fed up with this wasteful, extravagant government''; hopes that Libertarians can overcome the ``hurdle of irrelevancy'' to offer a realistic alternative at the voting booth. Browne wants to abolish the IRS and replace the federal income tax with nothing; end Social Security, welfare, and any federal role in education or law enforcement; and ``pardon all non-violent'' drug offenders on his first day in office. Abortion and gay marriage, which Browne says are ``none of my business,'' would be unrestricted under a Libertarian Administration (think of it as the Clinton White House, only more so).  After ``clean[ing] up the mess,'' President Browne would go back home and enjoy life.

Bill Clinton can't afford to veto illegal-immigration controls in an election year. Bob Dole has based his California campaign on the GOP's tough stand on illegal immigration. So, where is the bill that both houses of Congress passed and sent to conference two months ago? The House leadership has put off announcing conferees while Republicans try to reach agreement -- but that may not come. Republican Sens. Arlen Specter (Pa.) and Orrin Hatch (Utah) believe that Washington <I>should</I> require the states to educate illegal aliens, that taxpayers <I>should</I> pay for welfare services for immigrants, and that the asylum system <I>should</I> continue to function as a back door for illegal immigration. If Dole is not serious enough about the issue to convince Specter and Hatch that his chances in California depend on it, then Clinton can carry the state without raising a sweat. The parties will blame each other for killing reform, but the real losers will be the American -- the legally American -- people.

More on black churches (see ``The Week,'' July 15). They say that black churches are being burned by racists. ``They,'' notes Michael Fumento in the <I>Wall Street Journal</I>, turn out to be one main source, the ultra-liberal Center for Democratic Renewal. (CDR's chairman, the Rev. C. T. Varian, avers as how ``There's only a slippery slope between conservative religious persons and those who are doing the burning.'') Meanwhile, statistics show the alleged epidemic to be an anomaly, the result of more states collecting data on church arsons. Among states that have compiled this information, says Fumento, the number of black-church burnings in 1994 (11) was actually lower than in 1990 (13). The number in 1991 (16) was the same as in 1995. Church burnings are up this year -- at white and black churches alike -- according to an Associated Press review. Black suspects were fingered in 9 of the 73 black-church arsons recorded over the past 18 months. Drunken teenagers and burglars are implicated in most of the others; in only 12 cases was racism a clear motivation. ``Let's stipulate that burning a church is evil,'' columnist James Glassman (who pioneered this skeptical coverage) wrote, adding: ``But we should also remember that this is an election year. And a fire makes an excellent political smokescreen.'' Amen.

Turkey's political crisis, festering since the parliamentary elections of last December, has produced an ominous result. Islamist Welfare Party leader Necmettin Erbakan is now prime minister, in a coalition with Tansu Ciller's secular True Path party, Mrs. Ciller's blood feud with a rival secular conservative party having guaranteed that the secular forces would not unite. Mrs. Ciller is deputy premier and foreign minister, and her party holds the national-security portfolios. Therefore, the link with the U.S. through NATO and the recent military-cooperation agreement with Israel theoretically remain intact, despite Mr. Erbakan's open hostility to both. Turkey is a strategically pivotal country, which has lately been playing a more active, moderating role in the Middle East and among the Turkic peoples of the former Soviet Union. Its internal crisis stems from the weakness of the secular parties (and from the political elite's cavalier treatment of the people's Islamic faith in the past). We can hope Mrs. Ciller's gamble pays off and that political Islamism will be successfully co-opted and tamed by power. But there is a risk -- and a serious one. Turkey's foreign policy, and crucial Western strategic interests, hang in the balance.

General William Tecumseh Sherman leveled the Virginia Military Institute stone by stone, during his victorious march through Lexington, Virginia. The U.S. Supreme Court, a leveler of a different kind, has ruled that the all-male VMI is unconstitutional (7 to 1, Justice Scalia dissenting, Justice Thomas abstaining -- his son goes to VMI). Same-sex public colleges are unconstitutional; same-sex marriages may soon be constitutional.

Mr. Clinton celebrated the Fourth of July with a glorious photo-op: the release of a three-year-old female bald eagle named, a bit too conveniently, Freedom. (The bird had been injured and was being returned to the wild after treatment.) Fly away, Freedom, fly! Soar high and free!! Away, away flew Freedom, higher, higher, and out of camera range, where she was attacked and downed by ospreys. Rescuers found the poor creature wounded anew and floundering around in a river, and took her back to the hospital.

<FONT SIZE=+3>J</FONT><font size=+1>AMES</font> Baker managed George Bush's campaign for the Senate in 1970 -- and lost. He managed Gerald Ford's campaign for President in 1976 -- and lost. He himself ran for attorney general of Texas in 1978 -- and lost. In 1980 he managed Bush's campaign for the Republican presidential nomination -- and lost. In 1988 he managed Bush's general-election campaign and won -- on the coattails of Ronald Reagan. Finally, he headed Bush's 1992 re-election campaign and saw his candidate garner the lowest percentage of the popular vote of any incumbent President since 1912. Baker, in short, is a political loser, adept chiefly at media leaks that help keep the hot air in his crazily overinflated reputation. He is also a legitimate candidate to be Bob Dole's running-mate.
<P>
To be sure, the odds are against Baker, who made his way into the vice-presidential sweepstakes via Bob Woodward's <I>The Choice</I>. But he is a plausible contender because he meets what will be Dole's two chief criteria for a running-mate, as related to Woodward. The first is that the VP nominee be a ``10,'' a figure accorded universal respect (from the media) and already prepared to step into the Presidency. (Dole rates himself as having been only a 7 as a candidate in 1976.) The other criterion is Dole's own comfort with the running-mate, suggesting a pick who is temperamentally moderate, an experienced Washington hand, and personally on good terms with Dole. Baker passes both tests.
<P> 
Less likely to fare well under the Dole tests are the candidates who would energize the party's conservative base. The two conservatives with national prominence, Jack Kemp and Bill Bennett, both badly fail the second Dole test, especially Kemp, who trampled all over Dole's cherished virtue of loyalty with his Keystone Kop endorsement of Steve Forbes earlier this year (Kemp couldn't even manage to stay loyal to Forbes). A long-shot favorite of conservative insiders, California Attorney General Dan Lungren, probably fails the instant-credibility test (see sidebar, next page, for more conservative possibilities). Dole's running-mate is likely to have a strong flavor of Dole, meaning the odds are he will reinforce the ticket's ideological timidity and grey personality rather than dispel it.
<P>
<B>The Governors:</B> Early vice-presidential speculation centered on governors, especially the gaggle of popular GOP governors in the Midwest. Now second-year Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge has become the hot prospect. From a working-class background, he attended Harvard on a scholarship and served with distinction in Vietnam. He's young (50), attractive, Catholic, and from a populous state; he proved -- first as a congressman in the Democratic 21st District, then in his 1994 gubernatorial election -- that he has cross-over appeal for conservative Democrats. His most glaring drawback is on abortion. Ridge is one of the Republican governors who oppose the GOP platform's pro-life plank. While he now supports Pennsylvania's Abortion Control Act, in 1993 he flirted with the Freedom of Choice Act, which would have barred Pennsylvania's package of restrictions. His nomination as the GOP gubernatorial candidate in 1994 prompted a run by a third-party pro-life candidate, who took a respectable 13 per cent of the vote.
<P>
As a congressman, Ridge was a regular moderate defector, part of the Northeastern tail that wagged the dog of the Republican conference. He was as likely to vote against Reagan and Bush as for them. As governor, he has leaned more to the right, making crime a top priority (he has signed death warrants the way a movie star signs autographs) and cutting business taxes. He undertook a major push last year to pass a far-reaching school-choice plan, which was defeated in the legislature twice (even though Ridge broke a campaign promise and signed a hefty legislative pay raise, a move widely interpreted as a way to help smooth the plan's passage). In his short tenure as governor Ridge has yet to leave much of an impression on the state's voters; his approval rating had slipped from the mid 60s last September to the mid 40s this April.
<P>
The governor Ridge supplanted in the Veepstakes is Michigan's John Engler. The 47-year-old solidly pro-life Catholic recently said his moment had passed for vice-presidential consideration. His failure to pass a military physical for Vietnam or to quickly explain the circumstances has hurt. But leaving aside the draft problem -- and the dumpy Engler's glaring charisma gap -- the Michigan governor is a formidable political figure: he has been a moving force behind the GOP's remarkable rise in his industrial, union-intensive state; he eliminated a $1.8-billion budget shortfall entirely with spending cuts his first year in office; he has been at the forefront of welfare reform (even if his successes have been oversold); and he has cut taxes repeatedly in the course of creating a business climate that has the state's unemployment rate lower than the national average for the first time in 16 years.
<P>
If Engler deserves another look, the Midwestern governor who doesn't is Ohio's George Voinovich, another pro-life Catholic from a large state. After taking office in 1992 Voinovich raised taxes by nearly $1 billion over two years. When, two years ago, voters repealed the 1992 tax on soda by initiative, he immediately suggested it might be best to re-impose it. He expressed dismay that Dole would seek to repeal Clinton's gas tax and recently opposed an effort to give some of Ohio's ballooning $1-billion budget surplus back to taxpayers until forced to by the legislature. While Voinovich nurtures an image of personal frugality, he has yet to extend his fiscal discipline to state government; spending is increasing at a clip roughly twice the rate of inflation. Choosing Voinovich would make sense only if Dole's idea of balancing the ticket is a VP whose instincts on taxes and spending are even worse than his own.
<P>
<B>The Senators:</B> Bob Dole's political nest, the U.S. Senate, is a likely breeding ground for Dole-amenable politicians. A leading contender is Arizona's pro-life and generally conservative John McCain. He would be Dole's Al Gore, a VP pick who would reinforce the nominee's strengths -- war hero, foreign-policy experience, a sense of ``adultness.''  But McCain's personal strengths are related to his weaknesses, as his perseverance often shades into stubbornness. Dealing with him was a constant frustration for the Gramm campaign, which had to pull him from the campaign trail at least twice (he broke with Gramm on Bosnia and recognition of Vietnam). McCain's advocacy of campaign-finance reform earlier this year was a classic demonstration of bull-headedness in the service of wrong-headedness, as he forced fellow Republicans to take up his baldly unconstitutional bill. To avoid having to stroke prickly personalities like McCain is one of the reasons Dole left the Senate for the campaign trail.
<P>
Besides McCain, the Senate offers a variety of other middling-to-long-shot picks:
<P>
-Connie Mack, the second-term senator from Florida, is a darling of supply-siders and acceptable to social conservatives. Tall, Catholic, easy-going, he is one of the emerging conservatives best prepared for prime time. Problems: Democratic Gov. Lawton Chiles would appoint a replacement, and Mack is not particularly close to Dole.
<P> 
-Missouri's John Ashcroft, a former governor, has emerged as one of the more activist freshman senators, with a series of substantive and imaginative welfare and tax reform proposals. He's a favorite of social conservatives. But Dole -- in any case unlikely to turn to a freshman -- probably still smarts over a tiff with Ashcroft over term limits last year.
<P>
-Indiana Sen. Dick Lugar, who won votes only from the media during this year's presidential primaries, passes Dole's credibility test. But he didn't impress anyone else by scrambling to fill the vacuum in the race left by Arlen Specter. His campaign style, meanwhile, seems to have been borrowed from  <I>Weekend at Bernie's</I>; his selection would mean a ticket of Dole and duller. 
<P>
-Some insiders call Oklahoma Sen. Don Nickles Dole's adopted son. Nickles is a Catholic with something of an evangelical air. The religious and fiscal Right both love him, and so does Dole (a rare confluence). Nickles was an early Dole backer in 1988 and Dole hoped he would be his replacement as Senate Majority Leader. He is a plausible dark horse.
<P>
<B>The Establishment</B>: Another pool of talent comes from the Washington GOP establishment, the former Administration officials and office-holders who make it their business to be 10s. Topping the list is Colin Powell, although he has ruled himself out so many times even the Dole camp seems to be giving up hope. Powell has the odd distinction of being the favorite GOP candidate of both Dole and U.S. Taxpayer Party founder Howard Phillips, who calculates a Powell pick would push into his arms a plausible third-party candidate like Pat Buchanan. At the very least Powell's selection would ensure a messy, politically damaging GOP convention.
<P>
The most attractive of the establishment contenders is Dick Cheney, who tends to be discounted because of his 1988 heart surgery (some joke that Cheney must be the favorite candidate of Speaker Newt Gingrich, third in the line of presidential succession). But Cheney had no health problems as defense secretary. He has credibility with the national media and with conservatives (who also love his wife, Lynne, former head of the National Endowment for the Humanities). His personality is reassuring, if sometimes Lugarishly dull. His brief exploratory run for the Presidency last year was notable only for its lack of ideas or energy. His tenure as defense secretary was in character too; post - Cold War defense policy on his watch was safe and reasoned, if unimaginative. Cheney's inclinations are those of a conservative who also once was President Ford's chief of staff.
<P>
A more dynamic establishment possibility is Carroll Campbell, the former two-term governor of South Carolina. Dole owes Campbell for his South Carolina primary victory. Campbell left office with an approval rating in the 70s, after pursuing a Lamar Alexander - like agenda of economic development (spurred by a variety of tax incentives) and government reform; the size of government, meanwhile, went untouched. Campbell has the vivacity of a New South politician, but also the vague sense of untrustworthiness of one. He has strained relations with the South Carolina Christian Right, which correctly senses he is not one of them and also bridles under a variety of slights -- perceived or real -- from Campbell's years of brokering its rise to power in the party. (The pro-life Campbell was almost denied a slot as a convention delegate this year.) His current million-dollar-a-year job would disqualify him as a running-mate for some candidates, but probably not Dole, who if he were offended by Washington operators would have to jettison most of his entourage.
<P>
The ultimate in operators is James Baker. The former Secretary of State has no constituency -- except the national media. ``Baker makes it onto short lists because he's a master at leaking,'' observes <I>Human Events</I> editor John Gizzi. Reaganites hate him for his self-serving stroking of the media and the way he manipulated his way through staff infighting. His only ideology is power. He claims to be pro-life, but on <I>Meet the Press</I> in 1994 he equivocated: ``even though I ran on a right-to-life-amendment platform [in Texas] I find it a little difficult to understand, as a conservative, the government taking that kind of an activist approach in personal lives.'' Editorial boards would swoon over a Baker pick, but Dole surely has observed Baker enough to know loyalty isn't in his vocabulary. If Dole selected Baker and his poll numbers continued to sag, by mid September Baker would quietly be telling reporters it really wasn't his decision to join the ticket.
<P>
The Dole campaign is keeping vice-presidential deliberations close to its chest, with long-time Dole friend Bob Ellsworth handling the selection process. There are a range of dark horses who could still emerge: Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson, yet another pro-life, Catholic, Midwestern governor; the young and energetic deficit hawk, House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich; Dole Republican par excellence Donald Rumsfeld, the former Illinois congressman tapped by the Dole campaign to handle policy. But chances are Dole won't stray too far afield. When Ellsworth floated Democratic Sen. Sam Nunn, it was an ``outside-the-box'' name that was as inside-the-box as you can get: a Senate insider, a mushy moderate, a political bore. Dole's talk of picking a pro-choicer, meanwhile, is probably meant only to establish his independence for the media (see below for more on Christine Todd Whitman et al.). The first dictum of vice-presidential selection, they say, is, Do no harm. Dole is likely to follow it in his own way, and pick someone who will do no harm he isn't already capable of himself.

<H2>Self-Corrections Welcome</H2></CENTER>

<HR>
<P>
NEW YORK, JULY 2
<P>











Last week, the <I>New York Times</I> celebrated its one-hundredth anniversary under its current regime. To get it said, yet again: It is the greatest news institution in the history of the world, in the absence of which many of us would stumble about as if without arms or legs.
<P>
A truly fine aspect of the <i>Times</i> is its ever so careful writing into the record of corrections of its own bad moments. These, unhappily, are very bad moments. In the Thirties, Walter Duranty told the world that there was nothing whatever to worry about, never mind those reports about the starvation of the Kulaks by Josef Stalin. Abundant coverage, in later years, was given to those and other crimes of Stalin.
<P>
Two weeks ago, appropriately on its one-hundredth birthday, the <i>Times</I> gave us two self-corrections, in the Book Review and in the articles section. In the Book Review a remarkable review by Terry Teachout of Joan Mellen's biography, <I>Hellman and Hammett: The Legendary Passion of Lillian Hellman and Dashiell Hammett</I>. Mr. Teachout is devastating in his exploration of Miss Hellman's lifelong infatuation with Soviet Communism.
<P>
Lillian Hellman's review of her own political career had been published in 1976, called <I>Scoundrel Time</I>. It was hailed on the front page of the <I>Times</I> Book Review as a work comparable to those of Thoreau and Emerson. Similar notice of it was taken in the <I>Washington Post</I>, and the <I>Chicago Tribune</I>. Only Hilton Kramer, then an art critic at the <I>Times</I>, demurred. Miss Hellman had presented herself as the soul of courage and resolution, the Joan of Arc of the McCarthy era. What she was was a lovesick child of Josef Stalin and an unpleasant human being.
<P>
The next week, in its Sunday magazine, the <I>Times</I> published photographs taken during the reign of Mao in China (by Li Zhen Sheng). They are mostly pictures of people being shot and tortured. The text is by Edward Gargan, Hong Kong bureau chief of the <I>Times</I>, who records that ``more than 50 million people starved to death in the vast famine [Mao] visited on his country in 1960 and 1961,'' and that was five years before the Cultural Revolution - ``ten years of madness, forced labor, exile, countless suicides, and millions of killings.''
<P>
We know all that, don't we? ``Throughout,'' the <I>Times</I>'s Mr. Gargan goes on, ``Mao was labeled a 'genius' for the cataclysm wrought in his name. And wave after wave of credulous American Sinologists and journalists wrote infatuated accounts of the Cultural Revolution, celebrating their perception of China's transformation.''
<P>
Who was the most celebrated figure in the <I>New York Times</I>'s journalistic hierarchy? Before, during, and after the Cultural Revolution? James Reston, of course. In 1971, writing from Tokyo after a visit to China (where his appendix was removed), Reston wrote, ``I'm a Scotch Calvinist. I believe in redemption of the human spirit and the improvement of man. Maybe it's because I believe that or I want to believe it that I was struck by the tremendous effort to bring out what is best in man, what makes them good, what makes them cooperate with one another and be considerate and not beastly to one another. They are trying that.''
<P>
Reston's eulogy disintegrated in the memory after such as Max Frankel and Abe Rosenthal descended on China. But it was the capstone of the pro-Mao sentiment in the <I>Times</I>, even as Herbert Matthews's tribute in 1961 was the high-water mark of the <I>Times</I>'s enthusiasm for Fidel Castro.
<P>
The <I>Times</I>'s historical corrections are done without acts of contrition. Rather like the thief who sends the money back in an anonymous package. Institutions have a difficult time apologizing for themselves. Vatican II was exceptional in this respect, when the Pope apologized for past acts of hostility to the Jews.
<P>
But it is different where individuals, not institutions, are the critical players. It is a pity that, before he died, Reston did not take any of a thousand opportunities to remark his own delusions. Garry Wills is very much alive and very quick to notice other people's moral/political indiscretions, in fact, sometimes quicker than the indiscretions. In his 34-page introduction he treated Lillian Hellman's book like a modern <I>Areopagitica</I>. Garry Wills's reading of history, as of 1977: ``A newly aggressive Truman had launched the Cold War in the spring of 1947, with his plan to 'rescue' Greece and Turkey . . . We had still a world to save, with just those plans -- from NATO to the Korean War.'' At the time, I observed, in <B>NATIONAL REVIEW</B>, that Wills's introduction to Hellman might have been written in the Lenin Institute. Perhaps on his one-hundredth birthday, Garry Wills will show the courage of the <I>New York Times</I>.

Dear Rusty,
<P>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------->


<BR>
<BR>

Okay, we all know cigarettes are addictive. I mean, Tip smoked up a storm for years, and when she quit, well, she kind of got on the old replace-the-cigarette-with-a-Hostess-Ho-Ho train. At a certain point, I was thinking about a firmly worded offer: either a carton of Carlton Lights or a NordicTrack, but definitely one or the other.
<P>
But they're bad little cancer sticks, aren't they? I mean, it says so on the box.
<P>
On the other hand, of course -- and as you know, as a New Democrat, I think it's important to look at the other hand -- $72,000 in Democratic Party funds divided into six checks of $12,000 apiece to six swing states (say, for argument's sake, California, Ohio, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Florida, and New York) -- well, I mean, that's a positive, right? So while cigarettes are addictive, they're also beneficial.
<P>
As you know, Rusty, I'm very sensitive to the issue of hypocrisy. You remember how hard I fought to have an electric vice-presidential limousine -- and I only gave in when the Secret Service pointed out the problem, in an emergency, of a car that can only go 30 miles per hour for 11 minutes before it needs a recharge. Naturally, I'm all in favor of pointing out the differences between us and the Republicans -- especially these days, when they're harder to find. And tobacco policy seems a good place to start. After all, they got $97,000 in tobacco-lobby contributions last year, while we took in only $96,890.
<P>
But as I was helping George Stephanopoulos into his ``Buttman'' suit -- you've seen him in the news, I'm sure: a guy in tights and a cigarette costume waving at all the Dole rallies; boy, is George racking up the frequent-flyer miles! -- I suddenly thought that we may be pushing this issue too far.
<P>
I had just zipped on the filter headpiece and heard George's muffled ``How do I look?'' when the phone rang. It was Dad, calling from the farm.
<P>
``Son,'' he said, ``your mother and I just caught you on the news.'' 
<P>
``How did I look?'' I asked. I always like to get Dad's thoughts on my campaigning style. 
``Well, your mother thinks you look fat.''
<P> 
``Oh,'' I said.
<P> 
``But I've got a question for you. Just let me put down my julep.''
<P>
I heard the familiar sounds: the ice tinkling, the slippery noise of fingers on the outside of a glass, the thud of the drink hitting the coaster.
<P>
``Here's my question, boy. All those years growing up on a farm in Tennessee -- remember?'' 
<P>
``Sure, Dad. They're some of my fondest memories. Not that I didn't enjoy the years growing up in a hotel in Washington, D.C., of course -- but a Tennessee farm is a much better campaign backdrop.'' I laughed. Dad joined in with a few chuckles.
<P>
``Right you are, my boy. And do you remember what it was that we grew on that farm?''
<P>
``Mint?'' I asked, stymied.
``Well, yeah, mint. Of course mint. But come on, boy, we had thousands of acres -- your mother and I couldn't get through that many mint juleps in one planting season . . . Now, maybe, since I'm not working, but then -- no way.''
<P> 
``Then I'm stumped, Dad. What did we grow?'' 
<P>
``I'll give you a clue: it's leafy, highly addictive, and kids think it's cool.''
<P>
I went pale. ``Good heavens! Marijuana?'' I was shaking. This was the kind of thing that Dole's opposition-research people would love.
<P>
``No, silly,'' Dad said. ``We grew tobacco.'' 
<P>
``Dad! That's worse! We've been highlighting Bob Dole's ties to the cigarette industry.''
<P>
``Hello?'' Dad said. ``This is why I'm calling. Add it up, kiddo. St. Albans. Harvard. Your first campaign. Talk about tobacco money! Whoo boy!''
<P>
``Well, thanks for calling, Dad,'' I said. ``I'm going to have to think about this.''
<P>
``My advice, son, is when and if the press asks you about it, just tell 'em the truth: you didn't inhale!'' Dad giggled merrily and hung up.
<P>
I looked up from the phone in a daze. George was still in his ``Buttman'' costume, bouncing along the wall feeling for the door. ``Is everything okay at home?'' he asked in a barely audible muffle.
<P>
``Fine, fine,'' I said. I didn't want to disturb him.
<P>
``Well then,'' he said from under his filter, ``could you please show me to the door? It's getting awfully sweaty under here.''
<P>
I guided him out. Then I sat down at my desk and started to think. I needed some peace and quiet, some small moment of contemplation. What I needed, Rusty, was a cigarette.
<P>
I had a Snickers bar instead.

<LI>
Hard to believe, but there it was: a Democrat standing on the House floor pointing at a chart showing how Republicans have reversed President Clinton's success at reducing the deficit. Odder still, he wasn't making it up. The budget resolution recently passed by congressional Republicans includes a spike in the deficit, which is projected to be larger both in 1997 and 1998 than this year. There are innocent explanations for the hiccup, chiefly that the deficit dipped lower than expected this year (perhaps as low as $130 billion). But for Republicans who have made actuarial decreases in the deficit their Holy Grail, it is embarrassing. More embarrassing still, when it seemed that the Energy - Water appropriations bill (the source of ample funding for New Mexico) would have to be cut, Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici (R., N.M.) simply added $5 billion more to the overall budget. House Republicans went along, some openly exulting when extra money made its way into their districts. (The first effort by House freshmen to trim back the extra funding with a 1.9 per cent cut in the Interior appropriation bill won just 128 votes.) Some of this is understandable; these are politicians, after all, who have to win re-election. But higher deficits seem to be a dubious way to do it.

Many Americans who harbored doubts about the wisdom of anointing Colin Powell Vice President nevertheless hoped he would bring his dignified leadership into the political arena in some other capacity. These well-wishers have reason to be dismayed by the general's one recent foray into public policy. In a speech at Bowie State University, he announced his opposition to the California Civil Rights Initiative to repeal race and gender preferences. People of good will can, of course, take this position, but Powell refused to extend such courtesy to the other side. And he revealed himself to be woefully misinformed about the initiative. He thinks, for instance, that it would endanger outreach programs, whereas in fact it would affect only racially (or sexually) preferential outreach programs. Now Ward Connerly, the chairman of the CCRI campaign, has written, both in sorrow and in anger, a response to Powell. Connerly observes that Powell's best-selling book condemned preferential affirmative action, which is the only type of affirmative action that the CCRI would ban. Powell the author wrote that preferences stigmatize recipients, but Powell the speaker calls that argument ``nonsense.'' Writes Connerly, ``Frankly, I like the author better.'' Connerly calls Powell ``a genuine American hero,'' but Connerly himself has displayed uncommon courage in his principled campaign. It is a mark of Republican dishonor that Connerly has been left to fight this battle alone.

Arthur A. Coia, general president of the Laborers' Union of North America (LUNA), has contributed nearly $400,000 to the Democratic National Committee (thereby making the party's ``top ten'' list with plenty of room to spare), given in excess of $3 million to various Democratic politicians since 1993, loaned $100,000 to the Clinton inaugural committee, and sent one seriously expensive hand-made golf club to the President. Why the gifts? In 1994, the Justice Department drafted a 212-page complaint charging the union with racketeering and heavy ties to organized crime, and threatened to take the union under government control. But a closed-door meeting between Coia and the Justice Department resulted in a one-sided agreement leaving Coia in charge and with complete control of LUNA's reforms- not to be reviewed until 1998. Rep. Bill McCollum (R., Fla.), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee's crime subcommittee, plans to hold hearings on this sweetheart deal in the fall. Another FOB-SOB.

Dick Armey wants a flat tax. His major opponents may be not the class-warfare mavens of the Left but a decidedly upscale Beltway group: lobbyists. According to the House Majority Leader's report, the 67,000-man lobbying industry is the largest private-sector employer in D.C., accounting for one-sixth of the District's workforce. Plot the growth in the number of words in the tax code alongside growth in the number of lobbyists, and you'll see that both have more than tripled since 1964. That's no coincidence. Even in this era of spending cuts, nothing attracts special pleaders like the tax code. So how to jettison the tax code's bells and whistles? With 125 lobbyists for each congressman, a frontal assault won't work. We propose a special 0 per cent tax rate for lobbyists -- to be enacted when they agree not to obstruct flat-tax legislation for the rest of us.

Fuaziya Kasinga of Togo was granted political asylum in the United States on the grounds that the practice of female genital mutilation in Togo constitutes persecution. Genital mutilation is an appalling practice, but we need to distinguish between brutal societies and official oppression. If mutilation in their home countries entitles foreigners to asylum in the United States, then half the women of Africa and many in the Middle East could come here. What about girls caught in the prostitution industry of Southeast Asia? Untouchables and bonded laborers in India? To paraphrase John Quincy Adams, we are the friends of civilization everywhere, but the guarantors only of our own.

Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty give Central Europe and the former Soviet Union reliable news about the region. While the Soviet Empire is no more, freedom of the press in all these countries is precarious once again, with ex- and neo-Communists making their comeback and even Boris Yeltsin turning the Russian media into an organ of state power. A Washington conference on June 19, hosted by <B><I>NR</I></B>, the Nixon Center for Peace and Freedom, and the Center for Security Policy -- and attended by Senators Jon Kyl (R., Ariz.) and Joe Biden (D., Del.), Steve Forbes (former head of the Board for International Broadcasting), and Michael Zantovsky (former journalist and dissident, now Czech ambassador to the United States) -- concluded that the radios were still doing indispensable work. Yet Radio Free Europe's Hungarian service has been canceled for lack of funds, and unless another $1 million is found before September 30 the Czech service will be doomed as well. Congress, take note.

The largest American Protestant organization, the Southern Baptist Convention, has adopted a resolution calling for efforts to convert Jews to Christianity. Naturally this roiled the waters, occasioning outrage among some Jews. For such outrage there are understandable reasons: 1) efforts to convert Jews in centuries past often involved the sword rather than the word; 2) historically Christianity often demonized the Jew as an outsider or worse; and 3) the shadow of the Holocaust looms over all such matters. However, Christians from their side may decently answer that: 1) since they regard the doctrines of Christianity as true <I>and</I> universal, it would be a failure of <I>caritas</I>, without which life is as a tinkling cymbal, not to share them with all people; and 2) they do not see any reason to exclude their Jewish neighbors from the inclusive term ``all people.'' While overbearing attempts at evangelizing are spiritually disgraceful, the polite, considerate effort to share Christian claims with one's neighbors should threaten no one -- least of all, devout Jews.

<FONT SIZE=+3>A</FONT> <font size=+1>FEW</font> weeks ago I went back to see my old high school in Washington, D.C. In those days (I graduated in 1967) it was called Western High School, and was integrated <i>de facto</i> as well as <i>de jure</i>, with a roughly even balance of black and white students. The building, nearly a century old, was a little run down, and we had to scrape up money from our parents to keep the school newspaper going, but you could get an education there. We went to Harvard, Stanford, Tufts, the service academies, and other good schools. The middle-class white and black kids were in the same school activities, behaved equally badly at the same parties, and believed in the same government-issue Great Society politics. We all knew Marion Barry, then a local hustler on the rise who was just hitching a ride on the politics game.
<P>
Western is now the Duke Ellington School of the Arts. Much has been added, and much taken away. The most telling sign, I decided, were the clocks in the classrooms. They're the same clocks we had, and they've all stopped. The people in charge of the school have spent thousands of dollars on an elaborate closed-circuit TV system to tell the students about the week's special events, but didn't think some fraction of that should have been spent on teaching the kids to show up on time. And, indeed, the students wander around pretty aimlessly, I suppose waiting for the producers of <i>Fame II</i> to sign them up.
<p>
They're being cheated, of course, as they will find out after some very cruel lessons. So is everyone else living in the District of Columbia. The city, now in receivership for the second time in its history (the first occasion was in the 1870s), is a poster child for a 12-step program to kick Government Abuse.
<P>
A decade ago, D.C. seemed to be on the way to becoming, if not a state, then the political equal of the states. Now the city is being run by what is universally called the control board- formally, The District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority. It is slowly attacking the most egregious fraud and mismanagement. Its charter is to balance the budget in the next three years. It may succeed, if the tax base doesn't shrink any faster than its present rate.
<P>
But while the control board may give comfort to the holders of D.C.'s $3.5 billion of bonded debt, it cannot revive the city. Only a restored civil society with a middle class anxious to defend its families and property can do that.
<P> 
Most of the people now living in Washington are welfare recipients, D.C. government workers, or criminals, and their dependents. They are all opposed to the reforms needed to save the city.
<P>
According to the most recent <I>Washington Post</I> poll, conducted between  May 16 and 19, Mayor Marion Barry has a ``good'' or ``excellent'' rating of 52 per cent. When asked if Barry was ``trying realistically to deal with the city's problems'' 70 per cent said he was. Not that there isn't some dissent: In an earlier Post poll, conducted in February, 60 per cent of D.C. residents said that Barry's proposed cutbacks in the unbelievably bloated city government are a ``bad idea.''
<P>
What can you say? Most of the people, white, black, or whatever, who don't take the majority line have left town. They don't want to pay the taxes for nonexistent services, and are appalled by the schools and terrified of the crime. In 1970 there were 757,000 residents; today there are 540,000.
<P>
Now if nature were to take its course, the place would soon crumble, be abandoned by its surviving inhabitants, and then be excavated by puzzled archaeologists some centuries hence. It has happened before. But D.C. was formed by the Federal Government, which is constitutionally committed to the place; it cannot strike camp as a private employer or property owner might.
<P>
Until now, under both Democratic and Republican Administrations and Congresses, the response to problems in the District has been to fund another program or two. But in the past year, a tectonic plate has shifted. Eleanor Holmes Norton, the non-voting D.C. Delegate to Congress and a member of the city's black political elite, has put forward a bill to cut federal taxes on residents' local income to a flat 15 per cent, with exemptions of $15,000 for single filers and $30,000 for joint filers. Last year, District residents paid about $1.6 billion in federal taxes; Mrs. Norton's bill would cut that by an estimated $750 million. There is a precedent for this sort of tax break. Guam, American Samoa, and Puerto Rico also have limited self-government and representation in Washington, and their residents pay no federal income taxes.
<P>
<font size=+3>T</font><font size=+1>HERE</font> is a popular perception in the rest of the country that Washington is a nest of ill-gotten wealth and privilege. Privilege? Yes. Ill gotten? In many cases. But wealth? Last year, there were only 4,300-odd taxpayers in the District who earned $200,000 or more. What if their tax liability were to be cut by more than a third? Think some of their friends might move into town? As for the core middle class, there were only about 75,000 taxpayers in the District with family incomes between $30,000 and $75,000. If the better-off are the ones who might start new enterprises, the people in the middle are the ones who will harass the school board, the police, and the City Council into delivering real services.
<P>
To add to the lure, the Norton plan would retain the mortgage-interest deduction and the charitable deductions. The frosting: there would be no capital-gains tax on investments in D.C. by D.C. residents. The Norton bill would be the camel's nose in the tent for a national flat tax. And it would help transform the terms of debate in the black middle class, which now sees itself as dependent on government jobs and affirmative action.
<P>
Of course Mrs. Norton doesn't represent herself as a born-again conservative. ``I am a hard-core Democrat and a hard-core liberal,'' she says. She supports the National Education Association in its unbending opposition to a voucher program for the District's schools, and says of her proposal, ``I am not calling this a flat tax because that suggests it is not progressive. I am calling it a uniform tax.'' Whatever. She is realistic about the essential problem of the District. ``The D.C. government has an attitude. Nothing will work unless it is reformed agency by agency, which is where the waste is. The police need to be made more effective. The control board's plan to cut 10,000 jobs (about a quarter of the city payroll) is a good one.''
<P>
There are about 15,000 bills introduced in Congress every year, and only a small fraction see the light of day. The District is a pretty unpopular cause in Congress. Even when Democrats are in control, key legislation concerning the city tends to pass by narrow margins.
<P>
Even in this basically hostile climate, a surprisingly high level of support has built up for the D.C. flat tax. ``The Speaker is interested in it,'' says Mrs. Norton, ``and he's sent a memo to Bill Archer at Ways and Means asking how it can be moved along. Victor Fazio, the chair of the Democratic caucus, has become a co-sponsor.'' Before leaving the Senate, Bob Dole had offered to get the bill through the upper chamber if it passed the House- a good omen.
<P>
It is not, however, a lock. Republican House Members, particularly the newer ones, don't like to think about Washington, and tend to defer to the two or three people in the caucus who have the principal responsibility for D.C. affairs. Their support for a D.C. flat tax is conditioned on seeing reforms in the city government.
<P>
Tom Davis (R., Va.) is the chairman of the House District Affairs Committee. He is a freshman from neighboring Fairfax County, where he became head of the county government while working as an executive with a technology company. ``This city still has an entitlement/victim mentality,'' he sighs. ``And most of the crimes are being committed against the people who are fighting the changes we're trying to make in the justice system.'' For Davis's constituents, D.C. is a local issue, which tends to come down to its contribution to the region's crime rate. ``Every other jurisdiction is moving away from parole, because 60 per cent of crimes are committed by 3 per cent of the prisoners. But parole in D.C. is almost automatic, and Barry got a lot of support in the last election by making a play for the votes of offenders' families and friends.'' There are one and a half times as many prisoners now in the District's Lorton Reformatory as there are taxpayers in the $200,000-and-up group.
<P>
``At a minimum we want to see regulatory reform so that the city would have the welcome mat out for business,'' Davis says. ``The problem now is that the District's reputation is bringing down the whole region.''
<P>
In the end, Davis tends to support the bill. ``I think it's something we can do. But I want to see some other changes, not just in criminal justice, but in cutting waste and destructive regulations, along with some tax reform by the city.''
<P>
The flat tax would also need to have the support of James T. Walsh (R., N.Y.), a former phone-company executive who represents Syracuse. Walsh was the City Council president of Syracuse, and is able to make embarrassing comparisons with his home town. ``The city is only about three times the size of Syracuse, which has a budget of $330 million. Even if you triple that, and add in the corrections and social services the state provides in New York, you don't come anywhere near the $5 billion the District spends. In Syracuse the city council has a staff of 3. Here it's over 80. When they announce cuts in spending, those are only announcements.''
<P>
Walsh is a classic American can-do  type in a can't-do place, and he is not happy with his part-time home. ``Of course I leave my family at home in Syracuse. Why would I live here?'' Even so, he'll support the flat tax if certain conditions are met. ``I am willing to do this, but not for the heck of it. I want to see some behavioral changes here, including a balanced budget.''
<P>
We can't move the government to a less expensive facility in Plano, Texas, or Southfield, Michigan, or any of the other places corporate America has fled to in recent decades. D.C. needs a jump start, and the flat tax would do it. No, it's not entirely fair to reward the city before the rest of the country, but it could provide a testing ground for a tax-and-spend-less philosophy that could be <i>transplanted</i> to the rest of the country.

<H2>The Kemp Manifesto</H2></CENTER>

<HR>
<P>
NEW YORK, JUNE 21
<P>

The movements of Jack Kemp are always worth watching. For many years he was dismissed as a football jock who had stumbled onto Adam Smith and remained starstruck. But after a few terms in the House of Representatives he won grudging admiration, in part because of his comprehensive grasp of the economic scene, in part because of his rhetorical fluency. Ronald Reagan aside, it has been for many years Jack Kemp who has had the ability to ignite enthusiasm in those whom he addresses.
<P>
Kemp's political judgment, however, has never been very good. It is generally agreed by specialists that he could have defeated Governor Cuomo the second time around in 1986 and that if he had done so he'd have been perfectly placed to bid for the presidential nomination in 1988. He gave up his congressional seat to contend for the presidential nomination and, for reasons unknown and unknowable, left his legal residence in New York in favor of Maryland, where he lived while serving as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development for President Bush. If he had stayed in New York he'd have been nominated for governor, would have defeated Mr. Cuomo, and would almost certainly be the candidate for President at the moment.
<P>
But his political prescriptions have always been sound, and this week he published in the <I>Wall Street Journal</I> a manifesto of sorts. In it he made an unusual proposal.
<P>
But first, the launch. Mr. Kemp argues that the country is wearing itself out with the partisanship that is built into existing economic policies. This is likely to go on with the rough division we have got used to. The Democrats are associated with welfare, the Republicans with tax reform. They argue but without a common vocabulary, says Mr. Kemp. If what is desired is to provide for the underclass, the most painless way to do this is to encourage growth in the economy. That growth can't happen under our suffocating tax structure.
<P>
Mr. Kemp asks for a truce on the welfare front. Leave it alone. In return he asks for a solid, architectural reform in our tax policies. 
<P>
What is especially original in his concrete proposals is his assumption that the President of the United States is empowered himself to take two drastic courses of action.
<P>
The first is to instruct the Secretary of the Treasury to index capital gains. The assumption is that indexation is a matter of purely clerical concern, that you should not need a congressional Act to instruct the Secretary of the Treasury to do something as obvious as not to charge for spurious increases in the value of land or stock or other property.
<P>
But Mr. Kemp goes further. He would have the new President instruct the Treasury Secretary to ``stabilize the dollar value of the nation's gold reserves, say within a $30 band.'' Such action would ``reinstate the dollar/gold link'' that was broken in 1971 and that led to the worst inflation in the century.
<P>
If we reason backwards, we have a right to assume that if what Nixon did he had the authority to do, then to undo what Nixon did another President would have the authority to do.
<P> 
Mr. Kemp then says: Look now at what would happen. For every 1 per cent decrease in the interest rate, $50 billion is lopped off the annual burden of the national debt. With capital gains indexed, a flood of realism pours into the marketplace, affecting farms and apartments and portfolios. It is another question how high genuine capital gains should be taxed -- that would be a congressional decision.
<P>
And as for the tax code, the new President having used his own authority to take the two measures here outlined, let Congress proceed to work out a new system inspired by the flat-tax principle recommended by the Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform that Jack Kemp headed up last year.
<P>
Here is a fresh view, filling the lungs with hope and excitement. Mr. Dole is uniquely in a position to act on the Kemp manifesto. He could, just to begin with, endorse the two major proposals for executive action. And, in a spirit of bipartisanship, he could say that he would suspend any call for reducing existing welfare measures, testing whether the fiscal reforms had the effect of diminishing the heavy weight of welfare on the budget. And Mr. Dole could make a second, equally exciting move by announcing that he intended to name Jack Kemp as vice-presidential candidate.

Dear Rusty,

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------->


<BR>
<BR>

I was working late one night -- watching tapes of Christie Whitman's debates with Jim Florio (don't know why; just interested, I guess) -- and I lost track of time. I was heading out of the West Wing in the usual way when I suddenly remembered the most recent memo from the White House Office of Security, following the discovery of some Rose Law Firm billing records in the Book Room. ``From now on,'' the memo went, ``all White House personnel are hereby required to pass through the Book Room no fewer than three (3) times in any    twenty-four (24) hour period. For those staff unaware of the Book Room's location, it's up the back stairs, down the main corridor, through the small butler's door on the right, along the crawlspace, and through the door at the back of the closet. When entering and exiting, please take care not to disturb Mrs. Rodham Clinton.''
<P> 
Of course, I didn't need directions. But when I reached the door, I heard the faint tinkling of bells. And I could smell incense. So I knocked.
<P> 
A deep-voiced female called out: ``What undead spirit walks the earth? What lifeless vision knocks?''
<P> 
I cleared my throat. ``Um, it's me. Al Gore.''
<P> 
``Eleanor? Is it you?'' asked a familiar voice. ``Eleanor? The forces are against me, just as they were against you! The conservatives and the reactionaries don't understand. Help me, Eleanor!''
<P> 
I cleared my throat again. ``No, not 'Elean-Or.' 'Al Gore.''' 
<P>
A silence. Then the deep-voiced woman: ``Mr. Vice President, is it you?''
<P>
``Yep,'' I answered. 
<P>
``But your voice . . . it sounds so masculine. I could have sworn it was Eleanor Roosevelt's.''
<P>
 The door was unlocked by HRC. The Book Room was lit by six flickering candles. A large woman in a kaftan sat fanning a deck of cards.
<P>
``Okay, Al, you caught me,'' HRC said. ``I was trying to contact some voices from the other side. ``Please promise me that you won't tell a soul.''
 
``Well,'' I said, ``if you'd prefer to keep it quiet, I'll respect that. But I think you're missing a chance. The American people are very interested in spiritual experiences. In my book, I was very open about the time halfway through an Indian sweat lodge that I floated out of my body and back to Washington to talk to the statue of Lincoln. And no one thought I was weird.'' 
<P>
``Really?''
 <P>``Really,'' I said. ``Besides, the Book Room has been the site of so many unexplained phenomena, I don't think one little seance will upset people.''
<P> 
``Good point,'' she said. ``I mean, isn't it possible that some mischievous spirit . . . A poltergeist! What if a poltergeist put the billing records in this room?''
<P>
``Well,'' I said, ``have you talked to a poltergeist tonight?'' 
<P>
``Nope,'' HRC answered. ``Just Eleanor Roosevelt and Mahatma Gandhi.''
<P>
I thought about this. I think it's safe to rule Gandhi out -- unfamiliarity with U.S. trial rules, for one thing; the fact that practical joking is essentially ``active'' and not ``passive,'' for another. And it didn't seem likely that the spirit of Eleanor Roosevelt committed any funny business with the Rose Law Firm billing records. On the other hand, I wouldn't put it past her to request an FBI file or two -- she's from the old school, when they were awfully lax about stuff like that. Still -- who knows how many undead shades might be lurking around. (Nixon came immediately to mind.) 
<P>
``You know what, Al?'' HRC said. ``I will tell people about my seances. Maybe the American people will understand.'' She turned to the woman. ``Mrs. Houston, let's try another spirit.''
<P> 

``Do you mind if I sit in?'' I asked.
<P> 
Mrs. Houston peered at me. ``So often,'' she said, ``the presence of another strong life form disrupts the ability to contact the spirit realm.'' She looked deep into my eyes. ``Lucky for us,'' she went on, ``that won't be a problem here.''
<P>
We took our seats and held hands. Silence.
<P>
Then we heard faint footsteps. ``What apparition comes to haunt us?'' Mrs. Houston cried. 
<P>
From the shadows of the Book Room came an undead-sounding voice: ``Good evening.''
<P>
The three of us started. ``What horrifying vision is before us?'' Mrs. Houston cried.
<P>
``Um, it's me, Warren Christopher.'' And, indeed, it was. ``I was just on my way out.''
<P> 
He slipped out, but by that time, the spell was broken. I went home. But the image of HRC stuck in my mind. Rusty, so many people think of her as some kind of Lady Macbeth. But let me ask you: Did Lady Macbeth talk to ghosts?

When Bob Dole announced that he would not ``seek or accept a retreat'' from the anti-abortion plank in the Republican platform, but that he wanted to add a ``declaration of tolerance'' acknowledging differences of opinion among Republicans, he hit upon a compromise that satisfied nearly everyone. But he could not leave well enough alone. Most pro-lifers thought this declaration should appear in the platform's preamble: plenty of other planks inspire disagreement among Republicans, so why single out abortion? Dole campaign officials assured pro-lifers that their point was well taken. A few days later, Dole gratuitously remarked that the declaration should go in the abortion plank. Ralph Reed, Gary Bauer, Pat Buchanan, et al. instantly promised a convention fight. Dole retaliated with a counterproductive attack on Gary Bauer. In less than a week, what had seemed a political masterstroke was transformed into a debacle. A convention fight over this issue would be the worst of all worlds. Viewers would be left scratching their heads as Dan Rather told them that intolerance had prevented Republicans from finding common ground. Ideally the issue should be resolved before then. Pro-choice Republicans must decide whether their aims are to raise money and get free publicity, or to help Bob Dole get elected by keeping the social conservatives on board. And Dole must force himself to engage this issue at the principled level it demands. Until he gets a grip, he and his party will continue to fumble.

President Clinton approved Wisconsin's welfare plan. Next: proposing a 50 per cent tax cut, sending the 82nd Airborne to the Rio Grande for border patrol, smoking a cigar in the White House, and promising to enlist in the Marines once he leaves office.

When former Colorado governor Richard Lamm showed a willingness to be the presidential candidate of the Reform Party, speculation naturally focused on the willingness of Ross Perot, the Reform Party's proprietor, to let him. The more interesting question is what a Lamm candidacy would do to the dynamics of the race. ``America needs more than a new President,'' Lamm says. ``It needs a whole new political culture.'' He is a sort of Anti-Demagogue whose ideal political culture is a blunt fight about hard spending issues, primarily entitlements aimed at the elderly: ``There is something wrong with a society,'' Lamm likes to say, that spends 61 per cent of the federal budget on people over 65. Lamm was also the first prominent politician to speak out against unchecked immigration. Tax policy and cultural issues seem to be terrae incognitae, and his notorious remark that Americans have a ``duty to die'' would -- and should -- be often thrown at him. But a candidate of hard choices would be anathema to Bill Clinton, and a prod to Bob Dole not to look for votes in the mushy middle.

Republicans may be throwing away one of their best chances to pick up both a Senate seat and a good senator. Arkansas Lieutenant Governor Mike Huckabee was set to wage a strong campaign for the seat of retiring Democratic Sen. David Pryor, but Gov. Jim Guy Tucker's Whitewater conviction and resignation left him with more pressing duties. The best remaining candidate, by a large margin, is sophomore Rep. Tim Hutchinson. Hutchinson is an affable and principled conservative, and was a Contract with America Republican avant la lettre. He is hesitating because of internal Arkansas GOP maneuvers. Republican leaders, both nationally and in Arkansas, should do everything in their power to coax him to run.<p>

In his Princeton commencement address, President Clinton proposed giving families with a kid in college a two-year $1,500 tax credit and a $10,000 deduction. ``Our goal must be nothing less than to make the 13th and 14th years of education as universal to all Americans as the first 12 are today,'' he said. This is a terrific political move and a terrible idea. It will be manna from Washington to hard-pressed middle-class parents facing huge college bills. But the United States already overinvests in higher education: thanks largely to liberal education policies, too many young Americans have to go to college to get a high-school education. The President's proposal would only briefly relieve anxiety over tuition, because federal aid generally causes tuition to rise. (A college that cuts tuition is throwing away millions of dollars in aid.) In addition, government funding tends to make universities less responsive to consumers. The Wall Street Journal had it right: The Clinton plan is  ``a jobs program for the political-correctness industry.''<p>

In re: Medicare's going from bad to worse. Look for some sort of ``bipartisan'' bailout, replete with price controls, Part B premium hikes, accounting gimmickry, and, if all else fails, a bogus reduction in estimated medical-cost inflation such as the Office of Management and Budget recently inserted into the 1997 budget. All this might buy us another five years. But come the next brush with insolvency, the demographic Indian Summer we've enjoyed since Medicare's inception will have turned to frost. In 2008 the first of 76 million baby-boomers start to retire. By 2040 one-quarter of the population will be 65 or older. We will confront what demographers call ``the aging of the aged,'' with the share of Americans aged 85 and older growing more than threefold, while those between 65 and 74 increase by a mere 80 per cent. By then the combined shortfall in Social Security and Medicare could reach 10 per cent of gross domestic product. A tax fix would be unthinkable: according to some estimates, a Clinton-sized tax hike would be needed every four years for the next fifty years. Long before then, however, the futility of nickel-and-dime reforms will also be obvious. Our prediction? Within 15 years Congress will change the very nature of Social Security and Medicare -- from open-ended entitlements to defined-contribution plans such as are common in the private sector. Retirees will decide where their retirement funds are invested. Baby-boomers will probably receive less money and services from Washington than today's politically well-protected elderly. But given the rewards of the marketplace, they will also have less need for them.

Perhaps you recall the Cato Parish (Shreveport) school system making the news a few months ago when the kiddies sent a 300-foot letter to Congress begging it not to ``decentralize'' the school-lunch program. Kiddies, said the kiddies, would starve by the millions if those mean-spirited Republicans had their way. The Cato school system is back in the news, locally -- the national media seem to have missed the story this time -- for having spent $6,000 on prime-rib dinners for school administrators, officials, and cafeteria workers: enough to feed 8,000 of those starving kiddies<p>

Mass-transit enthusiasts often extol the energy efficiency of buses and commuter trains, as compared with gas-guzzling cars. But according to estimates made by the Transportation Center at the University of California at Berkeley, automobiles are now, on average, more economical in the use of fuel than the mass-transit competition. Here are the numbers provided by Sharon Sarmiento in the Spring 1996 issue of Access magazine.

 BTU per
 Passenger Mile     Autos     Buses     Transit Rail
 1980               4,782     2,813        3,008
 1993               3,593     4,374        3,687

According to the Berkeley study, mass-transit authorities have been loading their vehicles with extra equipment (wheelchair lifts, larger air conditioners), thus increasing fuel consumption, at the same time that ridership has been falling. Miss Sarmiento asks: ``Should government now encourage people to use cars to save energy?''

In Renaissance Italy, a wayward duchess might be dispatched by a dagger thrust, a silken cord, a poisoned cup. In modern New York, where Lieutenant Governor Betsy McCaughey Ross is the duchess, and the GOP political establishment (her sometime patrons) the assassins, the thing takes longer. To be sure, Mrs. Ross has her faults: she is a temperamental publicity hound with no experience in government. But would any catalogue of sins merit the thousand cuts she has gotten in the last few months? A state trooper driving her to an event was told over the phone, ``Don't make it on time''; she had no troopers at all for five weeks; she was initially denied a seat in the New York delegation to the San Diego convention; the Parks and Recreation Commissioner called up a radio talk show she was on to say she was ``creating a bad atmosphere''; her press secretary quit, saying the lieutenant governor had told her to lie; a former speechwriter called her behavior ``not sane.'' ``Did any ceremonial form of law/Doom her to not-being? Did a complete jury/Deliver her conviction up i' th' court?/Where shalt thou find this judgment registered/Unless in hell?'' ``I am Duchess of Malfi still.'' Exeunt omnes.<p>

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>T</FONT>HE issue of <B>NATIONAL REVIEW</B> dated February 12, 1996, gave the conclusion of the magazine that the time had come to revise our laws on drug trafficking. Seven writers contributed to the symposium. There were no differences among them on the primary findings. They were 1) that the famous drug war is not working; 2) that crime and suffering have greatly increased as a result of prohibition; 3) that we have seen, and are countenancing, a creeping attrition of authentic civil liberties; and 4) that the direction in which to head is legalization, whatever modifications in kind, speed, and variety commend themselves in study and practice.
<P>
The response from the magazine's readers is, in volume, second only to the response to the issue in 1991 given over to the exploration of anti-Semitism. We have had over four hundred communications, and the only civil way to introduce fragments from these letters, as we now do, is to apologize to their authors for our failure to acknowledge them individually. (One letter is approximately eight thousand words long and is marked, ``Not for publication in whole or in part.'') Four hundred letters addressed to the President of the United States, or even to a senator or congressman, would almost certainly be acknowledged, by using form letters A, B, and C. But even a letter so spare as to have been usable to all our correspondents would have broken our clerical bank. Add to this an indisposition to craft letters so diffuse as to fail to qualify as serious answers. (H. L.Mencken's formula was always to say, ``You may be right. Sincerely, HLM.'')
<P>
Readers are about evenly divided on the recommendations of <I><B>NR</B></I>. A heavy majority were grateful that <B>NATIONAL REVIEW</B> had ventilated the subject extensively; all agree that the drug problem is acute, and no one disputes that the drug war is being lost. Those who oppose legalization are divided on what then to do, one half asking for harsher penalties, the other proposing different strategies. Inasmuch as the heavy majority of those who lean toward, or forthrightly advocate, legalization endorsed the findings and analyses of our own panel, they are given, to avoid repetition, less space in this summary. The analyses by Messrs. Buckley, Duke, McNamara, Nadelmann, Schmoke, Sweet, and Szasz are requoted here only when their recollection helps to achieve perspective in answering our critics.
<P>


1. <font size=+1>The Classic Prohibitionist View</font>
<P>
Prominence should be given to a long letter from our old friend and fellow warrior John A. Howard, founder of the Rockford Institute, now counselor to Rockford (which also publishes <I>Chronicles</I>). Commentary on his and subsequent letters is done by me -- WFB. What I say does not presume to be exactly what my colleagues would have said, but I have endeavored to avoid any disharmony with their views.
<P>
Mr. Howard says that he is surprised by the ``ignorance'' of the writers in respect of ``the large body of scientific research which contradicts their presuppositions and assertions. Bill Buckley denies any serious concern about the impact of cocaine and marijuana upon the millions of regular users because most of them continue their use 'without any observable distraction in their lives or careers.' Ethan Nadelmann asserts, 'Most people can use drugs without doing much harm to themselves or anyone else.' The other authors seem to assume the same benign character of drug use.''
<P> 
Mr. Howard goes on, ``An international colloquium on the human effects of cannabis consumption was held in Paris in 1992 under the auspices of the French National Academy of Medicine. Professor Henri Baylon, the President of the Academy, summarized the conclusions of the meeting as follows:
<P>
<blockquote>``'1. The toxicity of cannabis is well established, experimentally and clinically. The drug adversely affects the central nervous system, the lungs, and the immunity and reproductive functions.
<P>
``'2. Epidemiological studies have reported that the use of ``hard drugs'' rarely occurs among subjects who have never used cannabis.
<P>
``'3. Consequently, the participants in this colloquium rebut the distinction between ``soft'' and ``hard'' drugs.
<P>
``'4. The trivialization (``decriminalizaton'') of cannabis use, where it has occurred, has resulted in a considerable increase of its consumption and of its subsequent damaging effects.'''
</blockquote>
<P>
What I wrote (page 36): ``Professor Steven Duke of Yale Law School, in his valuable book, <I>America's Longest War: Rethinking Our Tragic Crusade against Drugs</I>, and scholarly essay, 'Drug Prohibition: An Unnatural Disaster,' reminds us that it isn't the use of illegal drugs that we have any business complaining about, it is the abuse of such drugs. It is acknowledged that tens of millions of Americans (I have seen the figure 85 million) have at one time or another consumed, or exposed themselves to, an illegal drug. But the estimate authorized by the federal agency charged with such explorations is that there are not more than 1 million regular cocaine users, defined as those who have used the drug at least once in the preceding week. There are (again, an informed estimate) 5 million Americans who regularly use marijuana; and again, an estimated 70 million who once upon a time, or even twice upon a time, inhaled marijuana. From the above we reasonably deduce that Americans who abuse a drug, here defined as Americans who become addicted to it or even habituated to it, are a very small percentage of those who have experimented with a drug, or who continue to use a drug without any observable distraction in their lives or careers.''
<br>
<br>
<p>
One wonders why Mr. Howard wastes his time (and ours) by his misreadings and irrelevancies. When the French National Academy of Medicine reports that cannabis is ``toxic'' in that it ``affects the central nervous system,'' it is telling us nothing that is not obvious. There is no other reason to use marijuana than that it affects the nervous system. And any inhalation of tar affects the lungs. If marijuana seriously affects the reproductive functions, one can only wonder at the success of the Woodstock generation in reproducing itself. To say that everyone who uses cocaine probably once used marijuana is correct and meaningless. Everyone who rapes probably once masturbated. Most excesses are progressive. To conclude that there is no distinction between soft and hard drugs is simply to ignore the discriminating capacity of our senses, to distinguish between the man who has taken a glass of beer and the man who has taken a half-dozen martinis.
<P>
And this, of course, is the key insight. Nothing the Academy says about cannabis or cocaine can't be said about alcohol, which the United States finally decriminalized after 13 ugly (and cheerless) years. It is especially curious that Mr. Howard failed to grapple with the point, given that the sentence in the NR issue immediately after the one he quoted above read: <I>``About such users</I> [i.e., occasional marijuana and indeed cocaine users] <I>one might say that they are the equivalent of those Americans who drink liquor but do not become alcoholics, or those Americans who smoke cigarettes but do not suffer a shortened lifespan as a result.''</I>
<P>
And a factual point. Mr. Howard: ``Robert Sweet does urge the acceptance of 'the recommendations of President Nixon's commission on drug law to end the criminalization of marijuana.' That would seem to support his view, except it is flatly untrue. That commission recommended that marijuana remain contraband, subject to confiscation by law-enforcement officials.''
<P>
The National Commission on Marijuana and Drug Abuse (The ``Nixon Marijuana Commission'') found in 1972 that ``there is little proven danger of physical or psychological harm from the experimental or intermittent use'' of marijuana. On the question of law enforcement, the panel recommended a ``decriminalization'' of possession of marijuana for personal use on both the state and the federal levels. Specifically, it recommended that:
<P><blockquote>
`` -- Federal and state laws be changed to no longer make it a crime to possess marijuana for private use.
<P>
`` -- The distribution in private of small amounts of marijuana for no remuneration or for insignificant amounts should no longer be an offense.
<P>
`` -- State laws should make the public use of marijuana a criminal offense punishable by a $100 fine. Under federal law, marijuana smoked in public would merely be subject to seizure.''</blockquote><P>
<br>
<br>

<hr width=50%>
<br>
<p>

Most of the letters received fall into one or another of the categories enumerated below.
<p>
2. <font size=+1>The Demands of the Natural Law</font>
<p>
<blockquote><I>``. . . in most arenas (the suicide business, abortion, others) you make reference to natural law, but in the isolated area of drug legalization you seem to discount the possibility of any higher guidance and use expediency as the rationale.''<p>
  -- Dr. T. P. Collins, Portsmouth, Virginia</I></blockquote>
<P>

No such thing was intended. But laws do not for the most part instruct us whether to engage in particular activities. Of the seven deadly sins (gluttony, avarice, sloth, pride, lust, envy, wrath) only two are also proscribed by statute law, and even they, only marginally. Jimmy Carter confessed to lust in his heart, but the policeman materializes only when lust activates aggression. Wrath is okay (in fact it is even encouraged, in times of war) except when it causes you to kill or maim innocents.
<P>
<br>
<hr width=50%>
<br>
3. <font size=+1>Personal Responsibility</font>
<P>
Much indignation is expressed over the tacit position of many anti-prohibitionists that the addicted class is free to become a public burden.
<p>
<blockquote><I>``Several years ago, our Congress chose to follow the leadership of American liberals by deciding that taking illegal drugs was a 'disease.' In reality, the use of drugs describes a behavior. . . . The result? The illegal drug-takers are 'rehabilitated' to the point where they no longer need to work to make their way in life; they simply hand the tab to the taxpayer.''<P>
  -- Jack W. Pace, Lincoln, Rhode Island</I></blockquote>
<P>

But surely it is not plausible that anyone well and persuasively instructed in the tortures of addiction would think to take up drugs merely as a means of effecting a personal welfare program? What several symposium contributors stressed was different, namely that the dollar spent on instruction and therapy effects a higher return than the dollar spent on detection, trial, and imprisonment.
<P>
<hr width=50%>
<br>
4. <font size=+1>Can Anyone Function With Drugs?</font>
<P>
Some viewers of the <I>Firing Line</I> programs aired in February featuring contributors to the <B><I>NR</I></B> drug symposium were astonished to hear (from Mr. Nadelmann and Dr. Szasz) that indeed some drug users can and do lead apparently normal lives.
<P>
<blockquote><I>``On Saturday morning, you sat there and countenanced the proposition that heroin was less dangerous than alcohol . . . Especially appalling was the suggestion that the addict could 'function' if he or she were freed from the problem of obtaining enough money to fund an illegal habit. The idea that an addict can function is almost as insane as the addict's substance abuse is insane. How do you define 'function'? Does it mean to lead a responsible, productive life? Does it mean simply to be able to feed and dress oneself? Does it mean to live and not be a threat to other people? How much self-reliance and safety do you include in your definition?''<P>  -- Louise H. Perret, Rye, New York</I></blockquote><P>

It is established that some people can ``function'' even after ingesting cocaine. Dr. Szasz has written on the matter in several of his books. He is arguing two positions. The first is that the ``abuse'' of drugs is a variable. Even as we know those who can tolerate five drinks, and those who can't tolerate one, it is evidently so with cocaine. This is hardly to recommend the use of it, since for the overwhelming majority it is immobilizing. Dr. Szasz makes the point that it is clinically incorrect to assume that everyone is equally affected. His other point is that to impose legal sanctions against someone merely because it is established that he has used the drug is an encroachment on human rights.
<P>
<br>
<hr width=50%>
<br>

5. <font size=+1>Is Drug Legalization Analogous To Choice in Abortion?</font>
<P>
<blockquote><I>``I'm surprised no one has thought of the parallel between the legalization of drugs and the legalization of abortion. The same arguments . . . could easily be used to legalize drugs. Right to privacy, freedom to do what one wishes with one's body, even the threat that if abortion were illegal women would have to resort to the back-alley butcher. Just change this last one to read back-alley pusher and the two are identical.''<P>
  -- Frank F. Bellotti, Seattle, Washington</I></blockquote>
<p>

The parallel is of limited use, surely, inasmuch as opposition to abortion springs from the belief that there is an aggrieved party, with human rights.
<P>
<br>
<hr width=50%>
<br>

6. <font size=+1>Would Legalization Bring More Government?</font>
<P>
<blockquote><I>``Another almost certain consequence [of decriminalization] would be the creation of a Federal Drug Control bureaucracy that would make the current Drug War machine seem trivial. . . . Another worry concerning the legalization of drugs is its probable effect on the workplace. Today, we employers can fire drugged-up employees. But, with legalization, I can imagine that employers will be forced to continue the employment of worthless workers under the Americans with Disabilities Act.''<P>
  -- John F. Brinson, Allentown, Pennsylvania</I></blockquote><P>

Surely implausible? There was less government, in respect of alcohol, affecting individual lives after Prohibition than during it. Besides, it must by no means be taken for granted that all the contributors to <I><B>NR</B></I>'s symposium favor diminished social and economic sanctions, were legalization to come. It is not inconsistent to favor legalization alongside an intensification of these other sanctions.
<P>
The columnist Nicholas von Hoffman lists what society is in a position to do to make its point. The taking of drugs ought to be legislated as a civil offense. What then might a drug consumer expect? To begin with, everyone would have to submit to periodic blood testing.
<P>
``Anyone testing positive for drug use would be subject to the revocation of a huge army of privileges, ranging from temporary to permanent loss of driver's license, the revocation of one's license to practice law, operate a barber shop, work as an electrician, practice medicine or be a plumber, rent property, buy and sell securities. Civil penalties for drug use could also include cancellation of eligibility for every kind of government loan insurance, loss of eligibility for welfare, student grants in aid, subsidies, and government payments of any kind, large or small. Persons found selling drugs would be subject to cancellation of medical insurance, and Social Security, up to and including refused admission to hospitals or hospices. No criminal penalties, no long trials, no F. Lee Blundermouths, or Whirling Dershowitzes. Civil society, through quick, essentially unappealable administrative tribunals, would turn its back on such people for a greater or lesser period of time.''
<P>
The promulgation of the Hoffman Protocols would require some fiddling with the Constitution. But can it be said that Mr. Hoffman is soft on drugs, though he advocates legalization?
<P>
<br>
<hr width=50%>
<br>

7. <font size=+1>The Federalist Implications</font>
<P>
<blockquote><I>``We tend to speak of the 'legalization' of drugs, when we really are referring to the repeal of national drug legislation. . . . Why should the conservative coalition split itself apart in arguments over whether 'government' ought [to] act aggressively against drug production and consumption, or adopt a libertarian unconcern and let the market proceed to do its work? The issue cuts too deeply. Where are we likely to find a better opportunity to educate the American people about federalism? The remanding of drug policy to the states would dramatically illustrate the futility and destructiveness of much meddlesome federal administration.''<P>
  -- Scott Rutledge, Richardson, Texas</I></blockquote><P>

State-bounded experiments lifting criminal sanctions against marijuana use have been attempted in a dozen states. But of course, drugs being light and unbulky, it would require an extraordinary mobilization of state constabulary to prevent border crossings. But yes, it would be prudent to repeal the federal law against marijuana use, leaving it to the states to define laws of their own. The distinguished neuroscientist Professor Michael Gazzaniga, writing in <B><I>NR</B></I> (February 5, 1990), advocated a federal drugstore in which drugs were clearly -- even dramatically -- labeled, detailing toxicity and possible/probable side effects. Such drugs would be available at a cost low enough to eliminate a black market.

8. <font size=+1>How to Measure Social Unacceptability?</font>
<P>
Several correspondents see a difficulty in any proposition to the effect that general disobedience of a law, as with drug consumption in America, should lead to the law's abrogation.
<p>
<blockquote><I>``. . . The Buckley corollary seems to be that if the enforcement of a criminal law measured by an unspecified ratio of persons convicted of the crime to those engaged in the conduct criminalized is too low, then the conduct should be legalized. I would like to have your views on whether, for example, you believe laws making homicide criminal should be repealed if it became apparent that most homicides were unsolved.''<P>
  -- Walter S. Lewis, Princeville, Hawaii</I></blockquote><P>

The point is argumentatively interesting, but collapses under scrutiny. Many sometime laws withered away with the separation of church and state, and sluggish observance. Attendance at Sunday services was theoretically compulsory in some localities even after the Constitution was ratified. Such laws gradually disappeared, as also, almost two centuries later, laws against commerce on the Lord's Day. What looms is greater emphasis on the distinction between victimless crimes and other crimes. Laws against sodomy are de facto relics of another age, although they are still on the books in some states. Laws against suicide are formalistic, inasmuch as prosecution is, in the nature of the case, impossible.
<P>
To be sure, the term ``victimless'' is used glibly. Isn't a prostitute, even if she engages in her profession voluntarily, in some real sense a victim? The drug consumer can, by his habit, victimize his family, but then so can the wage earner who dissipates his salary at the race track. It is preposterous to argue that the drug consumer does no damage, but my colleagues in the symposium are agreed that the sum of human damage done by the drug laws is greater than would be done without them, and that the primary -- and sometimes only -- victim in the latter case would be the drug user. The murderer's victim is someone whose rights are theoretically guaranteed by the Constitution; and the promiscuity of homicide is, up to a point, evidence of the delinquency of law enforcers. There is no evidence, the contributors to the drug symposium are agreed, that increasing the severity of prison sentences, or the density of patrolmen on our frontiers, would so successfully interdict drug traffic as to make the war on drugs victorious.
<P>
<br>
<hr width=50%>
<br>
9. <font size=+1>Isn't It a Matter of Law Enforcement?</font>
<p>
On this point -- law enforcement -- many correspondents dwelled. Blame for the ineffectiveness of the drug laws is laid on the shoulders of politicians, judges, police officers, lawyers, jurors, educators, parents, and doctors.
<P>
<blockquote><I>``I do not believe that the drug war has been lost; it has not yet been fought. What we have had up to this point have been ploys designed by politicians to appease as many of the various segments of the voting public as possible. A law that is not vigorously enforced is no deterrent. It is not the existence of a law that is the deterrent, it is the enforcement of the law. . . .''<P>
  -- Howard R. Jeter, North Huntingdon, Pennsylvania</I></blockquote><P>

Arriving at a different conclusion, in our symposium, were Joseph McNamara, who has served as police chief in two major U.S. cities; Judge Robert Sweet of New York, who, called upon to implement the Rockefeller drug laws, has seen the tumbrils pass by, en route to twenty years' imprisonment; and Mayor Kurt Schmoke of Baltimore, who has presided for nine years over the government of a drug-torn city. Federal money appropriated to prosecute drug traffic and drug use rose by 1,000 per cent between Nixon and Clinton. We have seen oscillations in drug use, especially a sharp diminution in cocaine consumption, but these have little bearing on the intensity of the drug war. It is for that reason that the panelists join in concluding that, this side of draconian punishment (flogging?) (hanging?) (public?), the drug war cannot claim victory.<P>
<br>
<hr width=50%>
<br>
10. <font size=+1>Where Do You Draw the Line?</font>
<blockquote><I>``. . . How do you make the decision which is which? You did not distinguish among drugs. Are there no drugs that should be banned, and if some should be, how is the line drawn?''
 <P> -- Francis S. Webster III, Austin, Texas</I></blockquote><P><br>

The text on the cover of the drug issue read, 
<p>
<blockquote>THE WAR ON DRUGS IS LOST
 <I><P><li>-- Kill It
 <P><li>-- Go for Legalization
<P><li>-- Free up Police, Courts
 <P><li>-- Reduce Crime</I></blockquote>
<P>

The panelists were not asked to draw the line. But in order to accomplish the stated objectives (free up police, courts; reduce crime), the profit from the merchandising of drugs would need to be all but abolished. This means, clearly, legal access to the most popular drug (marijuana) and the runner-up (cocaine). For most users, soft drugs are preferred over the most toxic, even as beer and wine are preferred over 200-proof alcohol. Crack cocaine is of course readily deduced as a (now) cheap byproduct of cocaine.
<P>
There is some evidence that crack cocaine can induce violent conduct. How, then, to handle the hypothetical buyer who enters a federal drugstore and asks for crack cocaine? Perhaps as was for so many years required in New Zealand of customers for beer -- that they consume it on the premises. . . . But on such specifics, the panelists were not questioned. Dr. Szasz is, on the subject, a libertarian absolute. My sense of it is that most of the others would move step by step provided the profit in drugs were hugely reduced. A beginning might be the legalization of marijuana.
<P>
<br>
<hr width=50%>
<br>
11. <font size=+1>Alcohol and Drugs</font>
<P>
<blockquote><I>``. . . you make the ludicrous mistake of comparing alcohol with drugs. With alcohol, you may have a hangover, but you will never experience a 'snapback' to full and complete intoxication. Take a visit to a drug hospital. You will see people wandering around like mind-numbed robots, oblivious to the world around them.''<P>
  -- Oliver A. Rockwog, La Puente, California</I></blockquote><p>

To compare drugs and alcohol is not to equate them. An analogy, by definition, marks similarities on the understanding that there are also dissimilarities. Marijuana, cocaine, and whisky are all psychotropic drugs. Of the three, only marijuana can't kill -- there is no record of death from overdose. Alcohol is responsible for an estimated 100,000 premature deaths every year. And alcohol is the most common wrecker of personal and professional lives, and by far the most common inducement to crime and mayhem. The damage done by drugs to the human body similarly varies. There are the cocaine-induced zombies, some of whom will never recover, and the alcoholics who suffer from more than a hangover because when they wake they turn again to the bottle.<P>
The primary distinction is that alcohol is a happy part of Western culture, and there is the presumptive case against introducing another species of psychotropic drug into that culture. But the panelists, in the issue under discussion, weren't arguing in favor of a supplementary drug. We were addressing the question: What do we do under present circumstances? -- having failed to stop drug traffic, and become progressively accustomed to privations caused by the endless war against drugs?
<P>
<br>
<hr width=50%>
<br>
12. <font size=+1>Hard-Drug Users Are Criminals To Begin With</font>
<blockquote><I>``As a 22-year prosecutor in a small rural area, I believe I have a better view of the everyday criminal than does a big-city prosecutor. . . . Marijuana is a fairly harmless substance that could be legalized without any real effect on the crime problem in general. Marijuana is a substance whose effects on the lives of those who take it are similar to alcohol, and people who use it have the ability to be normally functioning members of society. . . .<P>
``On the level of everyday street crime, however, the drug laws are a major advantage to law enforcement. Most of the '50 per cent' of criminals in prison for drug offenses are not there because they are major dealers or dealers at all. They are there because they have a long history of criminality prior to being caught with drugs. Possession of drugs is both easy to prove and very inexpensive to prosecute. But when you send these people to prison, you prevent innumerable thefts and acts of violence. Only very rarely is violence by drug addicts directly related to drugs themselves.''<P>
  -- Fred Schroeder, Marysville, California</I></blockquote><P>

The point plays on a theme widely distracting. Some students of the drug question believe that drug traffic is, as here suggested, merely a convenient vehicle for criminal energies that will find another outlet should the profit in drugs come to an end. What percentage of the drug-related prison population falls into this category (Category #1) is of course unknown. But it is known that many non-criminally-inclined Americans have experimented with drugs (we have used the figure 70 million). Some of these, caught in the act, are in jail (Category #2). And then there are those who become addicted and, in order to satisfy their craving, engage in criminal activity they'd never have engaged in but for their addiction and the high price of drugs. They are in jail either because they were detected in theft, or because they were caught consuming or trafficking in drugs (Category #3). The argument that in order to expedite the imprisonment of Category #1 we should not object to the imprisonment of Categories #2 and #3 is not persuasive.<P><br>
<hr width=50%>
<br>

13. <font size=+1>'I Saw What Happened . . .'</font>
<P>
<blockquote><I>``I saw what happened to promising young men and women in the late Sixties and Seventies when drugs were popularized. I had to raise four children under peer pressure . . . I saw the 'burnouts' and the dropouts. It would tear you to pieces. I saw friends of my sons go off to the University of Michigan clean and come back hopelessly on drugs. I saw families spending themselves into bankruptcy trying to dry them out.''<P>
  -- Lawrence E. Flora, Stuart, Florida</I></blockquote><P>

Who ``popularized'' drugs? An indulgent lifestyle. You write of the burnouts you have seen. How do you propose to diminish their number? They are there notwithstanding our war on drugs. What do you propose? Longer prison terms?
<P><br>
<hr width=50%>
<br>
14. <font size=+1>It's Simple: It's Wrong</font>
<P>
<blockquote><I>``I started using marijuana at age 14, speed at 15, mescaline and LSD at 16, THC at 17, cocaine at 18, and freebasing cocaine at 22. I know from first-hand experience what the use of illegal drugs can do. . . . I started doing drugs at age 14 and continued until I reached the age of 27, when I overdosed on cocaine. I believe that I am a better expert than any pundit who has ever read a paper, done a test, or contributed to any article. I know why drugs should never be legalized: to use drugs is wrong. Simple, isn't it? But that is where we must all begin to answer the question involved here.
<P>
``Drug use is wrong; to consciously ingest any substance for the purpose of changing or altering your mood is wrong. The effects of long-term drug use are clearly proven; to be involved in drug use while young affects the mind while growing up; it shapes the emotions of the pubescent who is going through the normal growing pains that all must go through, yet doesn't allow the teenager to view life through a normal viewpoint. I know. I have had to learn how to deal with people all over again since coming clean. It cannot be repeated enough:the use of drugs for the purpose of enjoyment is wrong.
<P>
``I know. I have done drugs in Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Vermont, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, California, Washington, Vancouver, B.C., Hawaii, Guam, Philippines, Thailand, Sri Lanka, Mombasa Kenya, and Singapore. I have done drugs at Parris Island during boot camp; Cherry Point, North Carolina; Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii; 29 Palms, California; on board the USS</I> LaMoore County, <I>USS</I> Okinawa, and <I>USS</I> Belleau Wood. <I>It's wrong.''<P>  -- Unsigned</I></blockquote><p>

We agree, it's wrong. And your experiences certainly document that the war against drugs has failed. . . . You were wise to leave Singapore. If caught, you would not have completed your itinerary. But we don't want to bring Singapore to America.
<P><br>
<hr width=50%>
<br>
15. <font size=+1>The View from Abroad</font>
<P>
<blockquote><I>``As a career Foreign Service Officer, I have served in drug-producing countries and seen the disastrous effects our policy has on those nations and how it benefits our enemies. We have created new sources of funds for politicos and cops already disposed to corruption. We risk the lives of brave American agents in a fight in which our 'allies' have no interest and see, rightly, as our problem, not theirs. We have huge bureaucracies in the State Department, Pentagon, CIA, DEA, FBI, AID, and Justice and legions of Beltway bandits thriving on the 'war' and its programs, conferences, etc. But the drugs still come; prices still drop; availability still rises -- and the body count in our streets doesn't stop. The war is a massive fraud with incalculable negative effects at home and abroad.''<P>
  -- Name Withheld by Request</I></blockquote>
<p>
<br>
<hr width=50%>
<br>
16. <font size=+1>Devolution</font>
<P>
<blockquote><I>``The most embarrassing aspect of the articles was that Steven 'I-am-not-a-conservative' Duke was the only person to recognize what we should do: devolve the matter to the states. Let Utah maintain its prohibition, let the People's Republic of New York legalize . . . and let NR stop searching for a national solution.''<P>
  -- Steven C. Russell, Bountiful, Utah</I></blockquote>
<P>
<br>
<hr width=50%>
<br>
17. <font size=+1>If It Isn't Illegal . . .</font>
<blockquote><I>``Tell me something, Mr. Buckley, if you can't educate someone on the dangers of drug use when it is illegal, how are you going to do so after it is legalized? I have two sons who are alcoholics. One of my uncles and my older brother both drank themselves to death. I shudder to think of the additional tragedies we would have had to deal with if drugs were legal. Our laws against drug use are important, Mr. Buckley. May God help you to see that and to engage the enemies of right behavior.
``What are my credentials? I am a janitor who has more sense than a fistful of intellectuals that write articles for magazines.''<P>
  -- Jerry G. Allen, St. Louis, Missouri</I></blockquote><P>

Were the people who, 63 years ago, ended Prohibition responsible for the tragedies experienced by your family? The argument would appear to be saying exactly that.<P>


We are grateful to our readers, as ever; and regret we can't, for obvious reasons, publish all that you wrote. The argument goes on. You have contributed to the public understanding, and to my own.<P><center>

<p>
<hr> 
<P>
Dear Rusty,
<P>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<P>

I'm enclosing your FBI file, which I promise I haven't so much as peeked at. A couple of the guys in Leon Panetta's office brought it by -- they're doing some late spring cleaning over there -- and they thought I'd better forward it to you.
<p>
So I guess it's good news, bad news. The good news is that you're cleared at ``all-access'' level, which means that if you and I are planning some day to meet for lunch in the White House Mess, and I'm not in my office, well, you can walk all over the building looking for me and no Marine is going to shoot you. The bad news is that your tax returns were forwarded to the IRS and it's not clear whether you've adequately reported foreign cash income. Apparently, the IRS will be in touch.
<p> 
What can I say? I'm sorry. The stack of files in the ``Al's Friends'' box inadvertently got mixed up with the ones in the ``Known Enemies'' box, and some low-level Army clerk ordered full FBI work-ups on all the names -- from Jim Baker and Tony Blankley right on down to you, Rusty -- and when the files came back, some of them inadvertently got put in the file box marked ``Political Ammo,'' which sat untouched until this spring, when the campaign team started poking around.
<p>
At which point, the whole thing becomes kind of funny, when you look at it the right way. See, all we wanted was the files on the Travel Office personnel. But, apparently, they were using an old list or something, and the whole kit and caboodle came over from the DOJ, and, well, we've been chuckling over this snafu for days, let me tell you.
<p>
The point is, the Travel Office was being run in a slapdash and haphazard way, but now it's run by us, so things are much better. Naturally, the press is having a field day with this. They don't see the humor in it, I guess. And of course, so much of the outcry is politically motivated.
<p>
It was a simple, honest mistake. We requested the FBI files, we received them, we mislaid them. You know, if I had a nickel for every important thing we've mislaid in this Administration . . . well, you know.
<p>
The problem is, this kind of silly event really plays into the Republicans' hands.
<p>
They're trying to run on the ``character'' issue, again, Rusty. I keep telling Bill not to worry, that I've got character enough for both of us, but the truth is, it might work.
<p>
I was talking to Tipper about this over breakfast.
<p> 
``Tipper,'' I said, ``I'm concerned that the Nixonesque overtones of the FBI file debacle -- ''
<p>
``Shhhhhh,'' she said, peering over a pile of pages. ``I'm trying to read.''
<p>
I was quiet for a moment. Then Tipper looked up.
<p>
 ``Guess,'' she said, ``how many unpaid parking tickets Liddy Dole had in 1985.'' 
<p>
``I'm sorry?''
<p>
``Go on. Guess.''
<p>
``Six?'' I said.
<p>
``Try eleven. That's pretty negligent, don't you think?''
<p>
``Tipper,'' I asked firmly, ``what are you reading?''
<p>
``Let's call it opposition research,'' she answered. ``I just wish that Christie Todd Whitman had done a stint for Reagan or Bush,'' she added.
<p>
``Tipper, I'm trying to share with you how I feel about the character issue. And right now, I feel very vulnerable.''
<p>
``Well, you should.''
<p>
``Tip?''
<p>
``Look, Al,'' she said, ``I was the one who said that '96 was the year you should be on the top of the ticket. I was the one who wanted to invite Susan Thomases over for a drink, dust her wine glass when she left, and send the prints to Ken Starr to compare with the ones he lifted from the Rose Law Firm billing records. I was the one who wanted to wear a wire during one of Hillary's 'stonewall-'em' tirades. Each time you said no.'' 
<p>
``You're darn right I did.''
<p>
But Tipper was on a roll. ``So now you come to me,'' she said, ``worrying about the character issue. Well, honey, the only way to combat the character issue is with a character issue of our own.''
<p>
``What does that mean?'' I asked.
<p>
``It means I have a lot of reading to do before these files are discovered by a White House Fellow cleaning out the dust bunnies in the Lincoln Bedroom the day after tomorrow.''
<p>
``What?''
<p>
``Al, don't worry about it. You're going to be late for your 'Corporate Responsibility Summit.'''
<p>
She was right. I gave her a peck on the cheek. Tipper always makes me feel better.
<p>

<H2>Higgonbotham-D'Amato-Hillary
</H2></CENTER>

<HR>
<P>
NEW YORK, MAY 28
<P>


At graduation ceremonies at Wesleyan, retired Circuit Court Justice Leon Higginbotham closed by making two requests of the students -- that they should see always, and hear, the pleas of invisible people. He closed, ``I trust that you will never sign on to any contract with America that sanctions or promotes exclusion rather than inclusion of the weak, the poor, women, minorities, and persons of color.''
<p>
A week earlier, Senator Al D'Amato of New York anticipated the injunction of Mr. Higginbotham when (on the Don Imus program) he attacked Newt Gingrich and his policies. ``I think that we do a great disservice to ourselves if we think that people want a Republican Party that is perceived as exclusionary.''
<p>
How do non-invisible people evaluate this kind of thing? They begin by making preliminary distinctions. Judge Higginbotham is an all-time, never-say-die liberal. He has spoken mournfully and eloquently of a childhood and youth wrestling with segregation and prejudice. He distinguished himself at the Yale Law School, was appointed judge by President Kennedy, and seems to be forever committed to any public policies that he identifies as in the interest of black Americans. He actively criticized the judicial record of Justice Clarence Thomas, has appeared jointly with Anita Hill, and has testified in favor of continuing programs of affirmative action.
<p> 
So what does one conclude about his advice to graduating seniors at Wesleyan? That Judge Higginbotham really believes all that business about Republican disdain for the invisible man.
<p> 
Now Al D'Amato is something else, because he is an instructed conservative, who was launched in the Senate by the Conservative Party of New York. What he means to say, when breaking with Newt Gingrich, is that his sense of the political situation is that Gingrich and his programs are unpopular, and, under the circumstances, Al D'Amato retreats from positions he and his party have been associated with for years -- balanced budget, tax reduction, line-item veto, term limits, regulatory reform, and the rest of it.
<p> 
Politicians are forever adjusting their positions to the direction of the wind, so why did Senator D'Amato make such a splash? Because the general view of Senator D'Amato is that, unlike Judge Higginbotham, his views are not fixed. Congressman Gingrich commented, ``I don't know why he is wandering around saying these things.'' That isn't true. Gingrich knows. 
<p>
And a third item over the weekend: we are made privy that the First Lady is thinking of adopting a child. Now even after making the greatest effort to understand her motivations, we must reluctantly pass over as primary an explosive appetite for more maternal experience. Mrs. Clinton chose, after the birth of her only child, not to have a second child; that, or else there were medical reasons for this; but no reason whatever to have kept her from adopting a child at any time during the past 16 years. There are good reasons for First Ladies to send their children home for the length of their husbands' tenure, not many for bringing more babies into the White House. Moreover, Mrs. Clinton is and has been for years one of the liveliest girls in town, distinguishing herself at law school and as a practicing lawyer and as wife of a governor and President, consumed by political life. So what are we to make of her sally?
<p>
That her advisors thought it useful, bringing attention as it does to the hearth-like nature of Bill and Hillary's real life, and incidentally blunting the nails of the nymphs who scratch away at her husband.
<p> 
Why do we fall for such things? What drives the wind that drives D'Amato? Why does Higginbotham really believe (he most certainly does believe it) that the GOP is the enemy of the invisible American?
<p>
Because of the GOP assault on school lunches. That's why! Higginbotham would cite that. Al D'Amato's constituents would cite that. Reduced school lunches are the stigmata of the Invisible American, broken by the wheel of Gingrich.
<p>
What exactly did Mr. Gingrich's Congress propose? The Democrats had scheduled a 5.2 per cent increase in school-lunch money.
<p>
The exclusionary Republicans proposed a 4 per cent increase.
<p> 
It is over such as this that Higginbotham weeps, D'Amato defects, and the Clinton family prospectively grows.

17-JUNE-1996
<P>

<LI>A new diet is sweeping America. You eat dessert only on days when President Clinton takes a position different from Bob Dole's.

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>

<LI>
``Nauseating and appalling,'' ``political cowardice,'' ``completely cynical'' -- so gay spokesmen responded to President Clinton's announcement that he would sign the Defense of Marriage Act, if it should pass Congress. The move was an election-year triumph of short-term calculations over long-term goals. The Republican bill is in part a pre-emptive response to the gay lobby's Hawaiian gambit, allowing states to reject gay-marriage contracts entered into in other states. Clinton has long said he opposes same-sex marriage, and his gay supporters have agreed to disagree with him on the matter. But the bill also defines marriage, for the purposes of the Federal Government, as the union of one man and one woman, and thus denies federal tax, welfare, pension, health, immigration, and survivor's benefits to same-sex couples. Before the announcement, Marsha Scott, the President's liaison to gays, had been exploring ways of extending such benefits, without the rubric of marriage. Clinton's abandonment of her efforts is what provoked gay wrath. Gays should cheer up. If Clinton wins, helped by such fudges, he can resume the effort (perhaps with the help of a new bill) to give them everything but the name.
<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>

<LI>



It is increasingly unlikely that Republicans will propose to eliminate race and gender preferences despite overwhelming public support for ending the group spoils system. GOP House leaders believe it's impossible to move the Dole - Canady bill over the objections of Gary Franks (R., Conn.), who is 50 per cent of the House black Republican caucus. Franks is satisfied with the Clinton Administration's review of federal affirmative action, endorsing its ``Mend it, don't end it'' line. The media can be counted on to put Republicans on the defensive by highlighting Franks's opposition. The counterweight to Franks would be enlisting Jack Kemp (who has yet to endorse the bill) and J. C. Watts (R., Okla.), who supports the bill's substance but questions its timing, to make the principled case on its behalf. Meanwhile, the Dole campaign is in full panic over the gender gap, and its pollsters are counseling their candidate to downplay his support for the California Civil Rights Initiative, which opponents plan to fight over its alleged devastating effects on women. The CCRI battle is both winnable and unavoidable, and its courageous supporters like Ward Connerly deserve the enthusiastic assistance of fellow Republicans. As Republicans complain about Clinton stealing their issues, it is disheartening to watch them throwing away one of their strongest.<p>

But the GOP can take heart. President Clinton isn't stealing conservative issues, he's only borrowing them. They'll be quickly returned after election day.<p>

Call them slow learners, but the Clintonistas may finally have found the legislative strategy they had overlooked for three years: forging a majority alliance of Democrats and liberal Republicans. Consider the minimum wage. In mid May the House Republican leadership had chosen a course that seemed well suited to put the debate firmly on GOP terms. An exemption for small businesses -- aping Democratic language from 1989 -- would be included in the minimum-wage bill, making it impossible for the President to sign it and turning the debate into a contest between small business and Big Labor. Just one problem: fellow Republicans wouldn't go along. A stunning 43 of them defected on the small-business exemption. House Majority Leader Dick Armey commented privately before the vote that no more than ten Republicans from union districts had reason to defect; the rest would just be kowtowing to country-club friends. Meanwhile, the Senate is operating in a similar vein. Instead of shifting money from other areas to labor, health, and education -- which would require making some tough choices -- Senate Republicans, at the behest of ``budget hawk'' Pete Domenici (R., N.M.), simply added another $5 billion in discretionary spending to the budget (the vote was lopsided, 75 to 25). The Senate also looks to be cooking up a welfare/Medicaid bill so weak that it will get past liberal roadblock John Chafee (R., R.I.) and hence get a presidential signature. At this rate, the President will manage in the next few months to build a solid record of accomplishment, thanks to his most effective friends on the other side of the aisle.<p>

In Forbes magazine, Steve Hanke draws attention to a recent study by Peter Boone of the London School of Economics on the relationship between economic aid received by 97 countries and their economic growth. He found there wasn't any. The only discernible effect of the aid was to boost the size of recipient governments. Being channeled through governments, foreign aid generated more patronage powers at the expense of the productive sector. Despite the London School of Economics' reputation as a sheltered workshop for the Left, Boone is not alone: LSE has, in the person of the illustrious economist Peter Bauer, an honorable history of questioning the conventional wisdom on foreign aid. N.B.: Isn't it time that his pioneering work was rewarded with a Nobel Prize?<p>

The campaign of Libertarian Harry Browne has announced that its candidate leads in Internet polls. The CNN/Time Virtual Election poll shows Browne at 23 per cent, followed by Dole (19 per cent), Clinton (18), Buchanan (17), John Hagelin (9), and Perot (5). That's fine. But if the Clinton and Hagelin forces unite, who will save the Republic?

When President Clinton and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl were supping on ribs, meatloaf, steak, and barbecued chicken in Milwaukee, was there a metaphor there? As James K. Glassman reminds us in the Washington Post, Germany, with its generous retirement system, worker-training programs, and nationalized health care, was a model for Bill Clinton in 1992. Yet now Germany's manufacturing staggers under the burden of labor costs 50 per cent higher than ours. No wonder unemployment in Germany is 10.4 per cent (about twice ours), while its GDP is expected to grow this year by less than 1 per cent. Now Kohl is desperately trying to get Germany's welfare state and public spending under control; a wave of strikes hit the public sector after he declared a two-year wage freeze. President Clinton, meanwhile -- with such initiatives as pushing up the minimum wage -- continues to blunder toward the Eurosclerosis that Chancellor Kohl is struggling to escape.

Occasional NR contributor David Frum roiled Canadian politics last week by posting the banns for a marriage between Canada's two almost-conservative parties, Reform and the Progressive Conservatives. He brought together some sixty of their parliamentary and grass-roots members at a Winds of Change conference in Calgary that the media immediately dubbed a Unite-the-Right cabal. The media, for once, had a point. Canada's last election -- when the Liberals won a substantial victory over a Right divided between the imploding Tory government and the rising Reform Party -- illustrated that in a first-past-the-post electoral system, if the Right is split, the Left triumphs. So there was good reason for an engagement; but how did the happy couple take to each other? They had little difficulty in agreeing on a common economic and social program (lower and flatter taxation, a balanced budget, etc.) that most American conservatives could happily endorse. But they had to gloss over differences on certain key issues, notably abortion and Quebec. And there is a suspicion that the party leaders are either skeptical of an alliance (Reform's Preston Manning) or downright hostile to one (Jean Charest of the Tories). A united Right will emerge in any event: either because conservative voters switch gradually to one of the parties, or because the party leaders make it to the altar. But Pastor Frum's shotgun wedding would take less time.<p>

H. Douglas Anderson, a Seattle-area psychologist, has been fined $1,500 by a state examining board, put on one year's probation, and ordered to take a series of ethics courses for a ``breach of ethics'' that ``fell below professional standards.'' The crime? A patient had asked what he thought about her impending abortion. He told her that it would be wrong.

Christina Jeffrey, the former House Historian ousted after being falsely accused of having Nazi sympathies, has sued Reps. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.) and Barney Frank (D., Mass.), who first made the charges, and Speaker Newt Gingrich, who failed to defend her, for slander and defamation of character. Gingrich sinned by omission and subsequently acknowledged the delinquency. But his Right Honorable colleagues have never apologized for defaming Professor Jeffrey before the world (in a more honorable age they would have been challenged to duels). Initially Mrs. Jeffrey sought nothing more than compensation for her out-of-pocket expenses and the correction of the public record. Mr. Gingrich having refused the first, she has been forced to take legal recourse. Her determination to set the record straight might serve us all eventually. Former Labor Secretary Ray Donovan famously asked, after a similar trip through the mill, where he could go to get his reputation back. Christina Jeffrey's lawsuit may caution those who would casually destroy others' reputations to be mindful of their own.

<p>
<I>Five years after the break-up of Soviet Communism,
Russia is in a state of anarchy, with its reforms in shambles
and its Communists once again willing to proclaim themselves.</I>

<P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>T</FONT>HE afternoon light filtered through the linden and chestnut trees in the city park, and martial music played over loudspeakers attached to the branches as a large crowd waited in the humid heat for the beginning of a speech by Gennady Zyuganov, the Communist candidate for president.
<P>
After a day of campaigning in other parts of the pro-Communist Bryansk region 250 miles southwest of Moscow, near the border with Ukraine, Zyuganov had come to Klintsy, a dilapidated city of 70,000 full of weathered wooden houses and rusting five-story housing projects.
<P>
The mood of the crowd was both nervous and expectant. Virtually all the city's factories had been closed down and many people had gone for seven or eight months without pay. Klintsy was also in the heart of the Chernobyl radiation zone, and there had been no government payments for radiation exposure since February.
<P>
I asked a woman in a print dress if she was supporting Zyuganov.
<P>
``We will all vote for Zyuganov,'' she said, ``because we want someone to give us our lives back. There are only two factories in the city that are operating. All the others are dead. We want to be able to work. Only the businessmen are wealthy. Everyone else is unemployed and hungry.''
<P>
Others crowded around. ``The children in school have nothing to eat,'' said a middle-aged woman. ``In the fourth lesson in literature, my daughter fell into a coma. They said it was a sign of epilepsy but she is not the only one. The children are undernourished.''
<P>
``The pensioners have nothing to live on,'' said another woman. ``I worked for 41 years on the Boyevik collective farm. It's painful to work so hard and be left with nothing.''
<P>
``The pensioners at least get something,'' replied a man in a worker's cap. ``What about the workers? It's been seven months without pay.''
<P>
``Everyone's nerves are on edge,'' said another woman, ``We don't see any future.''
<P>
<P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+3>W</FONT>ITH only two weeks to go until the presidential elections, the scene in Klintsy is typical of much of Russia. The country is seething with discontent, and there is widespread fear of violence.
<P>
At the end of May, most public-opinion polls showed Yeltsin moving into the lead, but Russian polls have a tradition of inaccuracy, and at least one opinion poll showed Zyuganov with an overwhelming lead. At the same time, all the polls are almost certainly underestimating the appeal of Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the head of the extreme nationalist Liberal Democratic Party.
<P>
The aggressiveness of the Communists, whose constituency includes pensioners, the poor, and others who feel cheated by the reforms carried out over the last five years, has inspired widespread fear. ``If Zyuganov is elected and tries to redistribute property,'' said Vyacheslav Golubtsov, a local newspaper editor in the pro-Communist Kostroma oblast, ``it will be extremely dangerous. Many of the banks belong to criminal groups who have no intention of giving up their property.''
<P>
Many of Russia's new businessmen have taken steps to send both their money and their families out of the country in the event of a Zyuganov victory. At the same time, however, many doubt that Yeltsin will surrender power no matter who wins the election. General Aleksandr Korzhakov, Yeltsin's chief of security and closest confidant, called in May for the postponement of the elections to preserve social peace. As one Yeltsin campaign aide put it, ``We would like to win the election legally. But if that is not possible, Yeltsin is making plans to make sure that he stays in power anyway.'' In any case, there is widespread fear that Yeltsin will falsify the results. According to Kremlin officials, about one-third of the voters will not go to the polls, and the Communists are mobilizing 200,000 poll-watchers to make sure the non-voters' votes are not cast by others.
<P>
The election, in many respects, will be a referendum on five years of reform which have changed Russia beyond recognition. In a country where there were long lines for bread, the stores are now full of goods. In Moscow and St. Petersburg, where twenty years ago a Volkswagen drew a crowd, the streets are choked with traffic and there are many late-model Western cars.
<P>
Nonetheless, there is no guarantee that Russian voters will give a ringing endorsement of reform.
<P>
<P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+3>T</FONT>HE direct reason that millions of people are likely to support totalitarian parties is that across the length and breadth of the country, people are not being paid. The situation in Klintsy is typical: paychecks are anywhere from three to eight months behind, and there have been delays in paying pensions, family subsidies, and even ``radiation'' subsidies for those affected by the accident at Chernobyl.
<P>
People are not being paid because there is no money in the government budget. Russia has one of the most confiscatory tax systems in the world, taxing profits at over 90 per cent, but this has not helped the government to collect money. Faced with the choice of breaking the law or going bankrupt, businessmen in Russia regularly do most of their business off the books. Officially, the government collects 70 per cent of the money it requires but, in reality, the figure is believed to be closer to 50 per cent.
<P>
Until 1994, workers in the state sector got paid anyway because the government simply printed money. This, however, led to an inflation rate of 25 to 30 per cent a month, and after Viktor Chernomyrdin became prime minister, the growth in the money supply was sharply reduced. The result was that the inflation rate fell to about 3 per cent a month, but the payment delays started to lengthen.
<P>
In March, Yeltsin announced that all the money owed to those who should have been paid out of the federal budget would be paid. In practice, payment has been uneven from one part of the country to another, and in any case it does not affect the workers in factories which have been privatized.
<P>
These workers are supposed be paid out of the profits of the enterprise, but many of the privatized enterprises have been unprofitable. And so the directors of these enterprises regularly turned to the regional authorities, who tended to help them pay their workers. With the tightening in monetary policies, however, these requests began to be refused. As a result, workers in the ``private'' sector have not benefited even from the halting measures taken to pay state employees.
<P>
Besides the inability of the government to support Russian industry, another reason why workers are not being paid is that in many instances, local officials and factory directors are depositing the payroll in commercial banks in order to collect several months' worth of interest. Depositing money at high interest is a new experience for many Russians, and a psychology has grown up according to which pay for workers is a low priority. As a result, even if a factory director or regional official receives money for salaries, the money will not necessarily be used for its intended purpose.
<P>
The consequences of the payment crisis have been grim. In provincial cities throughout the country children are undernourished and, in some cases, fainting from hunger. Chaos has been created in families, where workers have become dependent on their parents -- whose pensions are still being paid, albeit with delays -- or on their wives who are still receiving subsidies for their children. The life expectancy for men has fallen to 57 years, an all-time low for an industrial nation.
<P>
<P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+3>I</FONT>T IS possible that even with the delays in paying salaries, the Russian people would have supported the reforms, but there is an atmosphere of moral degradation which drains people of the will to endure hardship. Its principal sources are knowledge of the reality of the privatization process and the growing domination of organized crime.
<P>
When the privatization of state industry began, workers were promised that they would be able to participate. But, this has not been the case. Recent years did nothing to lessen the difference in living conditions between ordinary citizens and members of the former Communist <I>nomenklatura</I>.
<P>
The years 1990 to 1992 were a period of transition for the <I>nomenklatura</I>, which was mesmerized by the opportunities that reform opened up for acquiring unearned wealth. The law on cooperatives made it possible for factory directors to attach commercial enterprises to their factories and, with the help of creative bookkeeping, divert vast amounts of state resources to private use. When prices were decontrolled in January 1992, these commercial ventures were already active and producing income that the factory directors could constantly reinvest.
<P>
For ordinary people, the situation was quite different. Everything they had was in their savings accounts, the value of which simply melted away in a few weeks of hyperinflation. As a result, by the time Russian enterprises were converted into joint stock companies and everyone was given a supposedly equal chance to own a share of Russian industry, the conditions were already grossly unequal. Workers had nothing but vouchers. These were issued to them for free, but most workers had to sell them under the pressure of sudden impoverishment. The directors and their close aides, at the same time, had vast sums of money which they could use to buy up shares, and they soon emerged as the factories' new owners.
<P>
At the same time as Russia was being treated to what became known as ``<I>nomenklatura</I> privatization,'' the country began to be taken over by organized crime, a development that also had its roots in the period of perestroika. The first private businesses in the Soviet Union were organized at a time when it was illegal to have private guards, and they quickly became the victims of gangs, which demanded a share of their income.
<P>
At first, the gangs restricted themselves to extorting money from the operators of stores and street kiosks, but as they accumulated vast wealth, the criminals went into business and eventually took over banks. The result is that in Russia today virtually all major commercial structures, not to mention the smaller ones, either pay tribute to or are controlled by the criminal world. This is one of the reasons why doing business in Russia is so dangerous. The result of the competitive struggle for markets is frequently that one of the competitors is killed. At the same time, many sources of financing are mafia controlled, and anyone who falls into debt must fear for his life, because Russian criminals will kill a businessman over a debt simply to terrorize others. One year, criminals killed six thousand Russian businessmen and raided over seven hundred company offices, yet there has been little serious effort to investigate the overwhelming majority of these crimes.
<P>
A sign of just how far the situation has gone was the fate of Ivan Kivelidi, the head of the Russian Business Roundtable, an association of private businessmen. As of last July, nine members of the organization's board of directors had been murdered in the previous two years. Kivelidi was well known for his criticism of the links between corrupt bureaucrats, the old <I>nomenklatura</I>, and organized crime. So, in July, he announced his intention to organize and finance resistance to criminal terror against private businessmen. On August 3, he and his secretary, Zara Ismailova, were taken to the hospital with signs of acute poisoning. On August 7, the Ministry of Internal Affairs confirmed that they were the victims of radiation poisoning, reportedly from cadmium.
<P>
<P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+3>T</FONT>HERE is a mood of resignation surrounding the elections. It is common to hear someone say that voters face a choice between the ``terrible'' (Yeltsin) and the ``unspeakably horrible'' (Zhirinovsky or Zyuganov), in which case, the obvious choice is the terrible.
<P>
As matters stand, there are four candidates who are expected to do well in the first round of voting: Yeltsin, Zyuganov, Zhirinovsky, and Grigory Yavlinsky, the economist who co-authored the ``500 Days'' program for converting the Soviet Union into a market economy.
<P>
By all indications, Zyuganov has the support of pensioners, collective farmers, army officers who have not been paid, the indigent, and a large percentage of the workers who have not received their salaries. His strength is that he does not seem to have any serious competition for these voters, and their share of the final vote has been variously estimated at between 30 and 35 per cent. Their support could result in Zyuganov's coming in first in the first round of voting.
<P>
Yeltsin draws <I>his</I> support from young people, businessmen who enriched themselves during the period of reform, and Russians in all walks of life who want stability and do not want Zyuganov. Yeltsin's claims that a Communist victory could lead to civil war may be overdrawn, but they touch a responsive chord in people who want a quiet life, distrust the Communists, and are exhausted from decades of social transformations. Yeltsin is now expected to get 25 per cent of the vote, but polls, which may or may not be reliable, suggest his support is rising rapidly.
<P>
The third and most enigmatic candidate is Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who has performed better than expected in every election in which he has run. Zhirinovsky appeals to small businessmen, to Russian chauvinists, and to people living in border regions. He also appeals to those who see in him a man capable of taking decisive action to impose order. His voters often do not admit to pollsters that they intend to vote for him, which makes his share of the vote very difficult to predict. It could, however, be over 15 per cent.
<P>
This leaves Yavlinsky, who is popular with intellectuals and whose program calls for tax reform, job creation, and an immediate end to the war in Chechnya. Yavlinsky, aware that he is unlikely to win, has entered into negotiations with Yeltsin, but so far his asking price -- the post of prime minister -- has been too high. If, as expected, he runs, his vote is likely to be no more than 10 per cent, with the rest of the vote split among other candidates, including General Aleksandr Lebed and an eye surgeon, Svyatoslov Fyodorov.
<P>
Given this likely outcome of the first round of voting, the key to victory in a second round between Zyuganov and Yeltsin is the ability to win over the voters who went for the other candidates, particularly those who voted for Zhirinovsky and Yavlinsky. (The supporters of Lebed and Fyodorov are expected to vote for Yeltsin.)
<P>
Zhirinovsky has joined Yeltsin in warning that a victory for the Communists could lead to civil war, and he will certainly throw his support to Yeltsin in the second round if he does not make it to the second round himself. What cannot be predicted, however, is how many of Zhirinovsky's supporters would follow his advice. His voters are, by nature, oppositionist, and in the past they have been more drawn to the Communists than to Yeltsin despite the fact that Zhirinovsky has been a strong supporter of Yeltsin in the Russian parliament.
<P>
At the same time, it is also not clear whom Yavlinsky's voters will support in the second round. Many might support Yeltsin to head off a victory by the Communists, but anger with Yeltsin over corruption and the Chechen war, coupled with the belief that Yeltsin cannot be considered a democrat, may lead many of them to vote for ``none of the above.''
<P>
<P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+3>T</FONT>HE election June 16 will be the first presidential election in Russia's history as an independent state, and it may well be its most fateful. If the Communists win, nearly any of the measures that they have proposed -- from freezing prices on some items to redistributing privatized property -- have the potential for provoking either violence or economic collapse, in that way compelling new and more draconian coercive measures to keep a deteriorating situation under control.
<P>
If Yeltsin wins, however, it is not certain that violence can be avoided. Employing people without paying them is not a long-term solution for a modern economy, and the Yeltsin ``democrats'' no longer have the moral authority to institute far-reaching economic reforms. Eventually, many of the plants that produce products for which there is no demand will need to be closed, and adequate measures will have to be taken to provide for workers who are displaced. To do this, however, requires a state based on law and respect for individual dignity. This is what Yeltsin has not been able to provide.
<P>
What has happened under Yeltsin is that economic reform has been taken as an end in itself and a goal that justified any number of illegal and undemocratic practices. Under these conditions, the government has succeeded not only in unleashing the corrupt elements in a very fragile society but in discrediting for many the idea of reform itself.
<P>
Only a state based on law can start Russia on the path to a better future, but, on the basis of their records, this is something that neither Yeltsin nor Zyuganov can offer to the beleaguered Russian voter.

Dear Rusty,
<P>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<P>

I'm enclosing your FBI file, which I promise I haven't so much as peeked at. A couple of the guys in Leon Panetta's office brought it by -- they're doing some late spring cleaning over there -- and they thought I'd better forward it to you.
<p>
So I guess it's good news, bad news. The good news is that you're cleared at ``all-access'' level, which means that if you and I are planning some day to meet for lunch in the White House Mess, and I'm not in my office, well, you can walk all over the building looking for me and no Marine is going to shoot you. The bad news is that your tax returns were forwarded to the IRS and it's not clear whether you've adequately reported foreign cash income. Apparently, the IRS will be in touch.
<p> 
What can I say? I'm sorry. The stack of files in the ``Al's Friends'' box inadvertently got mixed up with the ones in the ``Known Enemies'' box, and some low-level Army clerk ordered full FBI work-ups on all the names -- from Jim Baker and Tony Blankley right on down to you, Rusty -- and when the files came back, some of them inadvertently got put in the file box marked ``Political Ammo,'' which sat untouched until this spring, when the campaign team started poking around.
<p>
At which point, the whole thing becomes kind of funny, when you look at it the right way. See, all we wanted was the files on the Travel Office personnel. But, apparently, they were using an old list or something, and the whole kit and caboodle came over from the DOJ, and, well, we've been chuckling over this snafu for days, let me tell you.
<p>
The point is, the Travel Office was being run in a slapdash and haphazard way, but now it's run by us, so things are much better. Naturally, the press is having a field day with this. They don't see the humor in it, I guess. And of course, so much of the outcry is politically motivated.
<p>
It was a simple, honest mistake. We requested the FBI files, we received them, we mislaid them. You know, if I had a nickel for every important thing we've mislaid in this Administration . . . well, you know.
<p>
The problem is, this kind of silly event really plays into the Republicans' hands.
<p>
They're trying to run on the ``character'' issue, again, Rusty. I keep telling Bill not to worry, that I've got character enough for both of us, but the truth is, it might work.
<p>
I was talking to Tipper about this over breakfast.
<p> 
``Tipper,'' I said, ``I'm concerned that the Nixonesque overtones of the FBI file debacle -- ''
<p>
``Shhhhhh,'' she said, peering over a pile of pages. ``I'm trying to read.''
<p>
I was quiet for a moment. Then Tipper looked up.
<p>
 ``Guess,'' she said, ``how many unpaid parking tickets Liddy Dole had in 1985.'' 
<p>
``I'm sorry?''
<p>
``Go on. Guess.''
<p>
``Six?'' I said.
<p>
``Try eleven. That's pretty negligent, don't you think?''
<p>
``Tipper,'' I asked firmly, ``what are you reading?''
<p>
``Let's call it opposition research,'' she answered. ``I just wish that Christie Todd Whitman had done a stint for Reagan or Bush,'' she added.
<p>
``Tipper, I'm trying to share with you how I feel about the character issue. And right now, I feel very vulnerable.''
<p>
``Well, you should.''
<p>
``Tip?''
<p>
``Look, Al,'' she said, ``I was the one who said that '96 was the year you should be on the top of the ticket. I was the one who wanted to invite Susan Thomases over for a drink, dust her wine glass when she left, and send the prints to Ken Starr to compare with the ones he lifted from the Rose Law Firm billing records. I was the one who wanted to wear a wire during one of Hillary's 'stonewall-'em' tirades. Each time you said no.'' 
<p>
``You're darn right I did.''
<p>
But Tipper was on a roll. ``So now you come to me,'' she said, ``worrying about the character issue. Well, honey, the only way to combat the character issue is with a character issue of our own.''
<p>
``What does that mean?'' I asked.
<p>
``It means I have a lot of reading to do before these files are discovered by a White House Fellow cleaning out the dust bunnies in the Lincoln Bedroom the day after tomorrow.''
<p>
``What?''
<p>
``Al, don't worry about it. You're going to be late for your 'Corporate Responsibility Summit.'''
<p>
She was right. I gave her a peck on the cheek. Tipper always makes me feel better.

NEW YORK, MAY 28
<P>


At graduation ceremonies at Wesleyan, retired Circuit Court Justice Leon Higginbotham closed by making two requests of the students -- that they should see always, and hear, the pleas of invisible people. He closed, ``I trust that you will never sign on to any contract with America that sanctions or promotes exclusion rather than inclusion of the weak, the poor, women, minorities, and persons of color.''
<p>
A week earlier, Senator Al D'Amato of New York anticipated the injunction of Mr. Higginbotham when (on the Don Imus program) he attacked Newt Gingrich and his policies. ``I think that we do a great disservice to ourselves if we think that people want a Republican Party that is perceived as exclusionary.''
<p>
How do non-invisible people evaluate this kind of thing? They begin by making preliminary distinctions. Judge Higginbotham is an all-time, never-say-die liberal. He has spoken mournfully and eloquently of a childhood and youth wrestling with segregation and prejudice. He distinguished himself at the Yale Law School, was appointed judge by President Kennedy, and seems to be forever committed to any public policies that he identifies as in the interest of black Americans. He actively criticized the judicial record of Justice Clarence Thomas, has appeared jointly with Anita Hill, and has testified in favor of continuing programs of affirmative action.
<p> 
So what does one conclude about his advice to graduating seniors at Wesleyan? That Judge Higginbotham really believes all that business about Republican disdain for the invisible man.
<p> 
Now Al D'Amato is something else, because he is an instructed conservative, who was launched in the Senate by the Conservative Party of New York. What he means to say, when breaking with Newt Gingrich, is that his sense of the political situation is that Gingrich and his programs are unpopular, and, under the circumstances, Al D'Amato retreats from positions he and his party have been associated with for years -- balanced budget, tax reduction, line-item veto, term limits, regulatory reform, and the rest of it.
<p> 
Politicians are forever adjusting their positions to the direction of the wind, so why did Senator D'Amato make such a splash? Because the general view of Senator D'Amato is that, unlike Judge Higginbotham, his views are not fixed. Congressman Gingrich commented, ``I don't know why he is wandering around saying these things.'' That isn't true. Gingrich knows. 
<p>
And a third item over the weekend: we are made privy that the First Lady is thinking of adopting a child. Now even after making the greatest effort to understand her motivations, we must reluctantly pass over as primary an explosive appetite for more maternal experience. Mrs. Clinton chose, after the birth of her only child, not to have a second child; that, or else there were medical reasons for this; but no reason whatever to have kept her from adopting a child at any time during the past 16 years. There are good reasons for First Ladies to send their children home for the length of their husbands' tenure, not many for bringing more babies into the White House. Moreover, Mrs. Clinton is and has been for years one of the liveliest girls in town, distinguishing herself at law school and as a practicing lawyer and as wife of a governor and President, consumed by political life. So what are we to make of her sally?
<p>
That her advisors thought it useful, bringing attention as it does to the hearth-like nature of Bill and Hillary's real life, and incidentally blunting the nails of the nymphs who scratch away at her husband.
<p> 
Why do we fall for such things? What drives the wind that drives D'Amato? Why does Higginbotham really believe (he most certainly does believe it) that the GOP is the enemy of the invisible American?
<p>
Because of the GOP assault on school lunches. That's why! Higginbotham would cite that. Al D'Amato's constituents would cite that. Reduced school lunches are the stigmata of the Invisible American, broken by the wheel of Gingrich.
<p>
What exactly did Mr. Gingrich's Congress propose? The Democrats had scheduled a 5.2 per cent increase in school-lunch money.
<p>
The exclusionary Republicans proposed a 4 per cent increase.
<p> 
It is over such as this that Higginbotham weeps, D'Amato defects, and the Clinton family prospectively grows.

<LI>District of Columbia Mayor Marion Barry spent a week at a Maryland retreat to ``engage in a program of spiritual and physical renewal.'' He was not missed. During the Barry years, taxes soared while services plummeted (except insofar as patronage, divvied among the mayor's numerous supporters, was a service). Congress finally had to put the District's affairs under a financial control board. Barry, a recovering drug addict, said his vacation was necessary to prevent a relapse. More likely, the District's relapse into some honest government has been too stressful.

In the shadowy world of spin and furtive self-promotion that is the race to be Bob Dole's running-mate, Ohio Gov. George Voinovich has until recently been on the upswing. Voinovich is popular, Catholic, and from a state rich in electoral votes. Just one problem: he is lacking in conservative hormones. Voinovich recently confessed he just didn't understand why Republicans would try to repeal Clinton's gas-tax increase (``If the deficit is such a problem, how can you be arguing to reduce the gas tax . . . ?'') There's a lot Voinovich doesn't get: he recently proposed re-instating a one-cent tax on soft drinks even after Ohio voters had repealed it; he floated a gas-tax increase after his 1994 re-election; he defends racial preferences, and doggedly resists attempts to require a super-majority in the legislature for passing tax increases. Dole would do better to look to California, where both Attorney General Dan Lungren and Rep. Chris Cox are intelligent, energetic, and conservative. Go West, mature man.

What to make of Felix Rohatyn, long known as a zero-sum economics man and advocate of industrial policy? His lengthy paean to economic growth, published in the Wall Street Journal, could have been written by an RNC staffer. At 2 per cent to 2.5 per cent per year, economic growth is woefully inadequate. Cut capital-gains tax rates. Restrain entitlement growth. Balance the budget in order to satisfy financial markets. Do all this, says Mr. Rohatyn, and we'd tack one percentage point onto the national growth rate, add millions of new jobs, and halt the sickening decline of living standards for those at the bottom of income distribution. Election-year epiphanies are always a bit suspect. (We fully expect the Clinton administration to pre-empt Republican tax-cut efforts with a proposal of its own.) But Rohatyn's musings seem genuine. ``As a traditional Democrat,'' he wrote, ``I have always believed that freedom, fairness, and wealth, basic to modern democracy, required an essentially redistributionist philosophy . . . The experience of the last two decades . . . has very much shaken that view. Fairness does not require the redistribution of wealth; it requires the creation of wealth . . .'' Perhaps he is aware of what fellow Austrian Friedrich Hayek wrote in 1944: ``We are ready to accept almost any explanation of the present crisis . . . except one: that the present state of the world may be the result of genuine error on our part.''

As we write, O. J. Simpson is addressing the Oxford Union. The format calls for him to speak for ten minutes, then answer questions. The Union, in its 175 years, has sponsored guests who are conversant with the subject they address. Normally, they debate a proposition, but there were no invitations issued, as far as we know, to Marcia Clark or Christopher Darden, to argue the only subject on which Mr.Simpson is qualified to speak, namely how to kill a woman and her walking companion in Los Angeles, leave traces vivid enough to light up the Empire State Building, and appear two years later as a guest of the Oxford Union. The New York Post reporter advises that ``British police [at the airport] mounted a massive security operation at public expense to protect Simpson after his request that his bodyguards carry guns was turned down.'' On the subject of the usefulness of guns O. J. is also an expert. Proceeding without them can leave an awful mess.

``We're leaner, meaner, and going nowhere fast.'' Economists ``don't really know'' why. And it has been that way for more than two decades, says New York Times economic reporter Louis Uchitelle. Two decades? Well yes, economic growth over the past 25 years has averaged 2.5 per cent per annum, compared to 4.4 per cent for the prior quarter-century. (Had we maintained the earlier rate, per-capita income would be $10,000 higher today.) But economic stagnation is hardly, as Uchitelle claims, a poorly understood fact of modern life. After all, real GDP grew by one-third from the end of 1982 through 1989. The principal stimulus, most economists say, was the decline in marginal tax rates; letting taxpayers keep more of each added dollar gave them more reason to work and produce. But that wasn't all. This period also saw less government interference in business -- evidenced by a 50 per cent decline in the number of pages of federal regulations issued between 1981 and 1989. And a generally less expansive government: federal spending fell from 23.3 per cent of GDP in 1981 to 21.3 per cent in 1989. Since 1989 all these vectors have reversed. Private employers are feverishly downsizing and investing in new equipment. This strategy will eventually deliver a higher standard of living -- when the government lets it.

Gay-rights activists are about to consummate their Hawaiian gambit. This summer, state judge Kevin Chang is expected to hold, in the case of Baehr v. Lewin, that anti-sex-discrimination language in the state's constitution makes it illegal for Hawaii to refuse marriage licenses to gay couples. Under the ``full faith and credit'' clause of the Constitution, every other state in the Union might be forced to recognize gay marriages sanctioned by Hawaii. In a counter-gambit, Rep. Bob Barr (R., Ga.) and Sen. Don Nickles (R., Okla.) are pushing a marriage-defense bill that would free states from the requirement of honoring same-sex marriages sanctioned in other states, and that defines marriage, for the purposes of federal law, as union between a man and a woman. Not exactly radical stuff. President Clinton is already distancing himself from same-sex marriages. But the bill still puts him in a tight spot. Does he side with his cultural Left or with the vast majority of Americans? Clinton's partial-birth veto suggests the former, which should give voters yet another reason to sue for divorce in the fall.

The U.S. has nondiscriminatory (i.e., normal) trading relations with 150-odd countries, which go under the misleading name of ``most-favored-nation'' (MFN) status. Renewing MFN for China was controversial two years ago, when Tiananmen Square was fresh in people's minds. MFN is now up for renewal again, and is no less controversial this time; added to China's human-rights problems are its sales of nuclear material to various rogue states and its attempt to intimidate Taiwan. But denying MFN is a crude weapon; it would, among other things, devastate Hong Kong's economy. Bob Dole has committed himself to supporting the Administration in seeking renewal. Denying MFN, he says, ``would not free a single dissident, halt a single missile sale, prevent a single threat to Taiwan, or save a single innocent life.'' Quite right.

One hundred twenty-five years ago, Pope Pius IX attacked the government of united Italy and considered himself a ``prisoner in the Vatican.''

You know how some people study every syllable uttered by a maximum leader, to try to detect a wind in motion? What did you make of that reference by Franco to Don Juan? -- that he would be appointed successor? What did you make of that dangling participle in Ralph Reed's mention of abortion and the Republican plank? -- that a compromise was in order? Well, we are that way with the New York Times, the ideological Bureau of Weights and Measures. For forty years we've waited to hear the Times refer to somebody or something as ``ultra liberal.'' Not yet, but get this! In a book review last week, Dorothy Gallagher was permitted to get away with a reference to ``the Rosenberg case'' in the context of espionage activity. That is thunderous stuff, suggesting that indeed the Rosenbergs were guilty (they were of course, and everybody has known it for a generation, but the other side hasn't capitulated). More, the reviewer refers to the Institute of Pacific Relations, the snuggery in which Owen Lattimore operated, in a context that clearly suggests he was engaged in subversive activity. Remember Joe McCarthy? He said that Lattimore was his do-or-die case. Lattimore loyalists were as outspoken as the Hiss people. What we have seen is a cataclysmic move.

On the evening of May 12, St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York accommodated a Tridentine Mass, standard in Catholicism from the sixteenth-century Council of Trent until 1963, when Vatican II supplanted it with a new Mass, in the vernacular. Trent represented a largely successful effort to consolidate and regularize Catholic practice in the teeth of doctrinal gales blowing down from Germany and Geneva. Many today see the Latin Mass as a symbol of resistance to the corrosions of modern culture. In his solemn high Mass that morning John Cardinal O'Connor expressed surprise that the Tridentine Mass scheduled for that evening was being viewed by the press as a gesture of discontent within the Church. He professed to see it, rather, as an authorized, indeed normal, occurrence. Yet St. Patrick's has high visibility and, until now, no Tridentine Masses. The celebration was done by Alfons Cardinal Stickler, a visiting cardinal of curial rank. In the evening, Cardinal O'Connor termed it ``historic.'' Four thousand worshippers filled the cathedral. It is difficult to avoid the impression that some vectors may indeed be shifting, and that some of the faithful may be tiring of the John - Jane - Gyp English of the awful contemporary translations.

The Dartmouth Review is on a roll, under the editorship of James S. Panero, a sophomore, no less. The editorial writing is clear, clean, and bright. The rebellious flavor is sui generis sophomore, and can be just plain fun, as witness the latest fusillade at the expense of the arch-enemy, Mr. Freedman, president of Dartmouth. . . . A half-page ad. Collegium Dartmuthens/In Aqua Vitae Conditum A.D. 1770 (a huge wine barrel with roisterers on all sides). Then in huge boldface: ``How much would you contribute in exchange for James Freedman's resignation?/Please fill out this form, cut it out and mail it to: The Committee to Save Dartmouth, P.O. Box 5077, Hanover, N.H. 03755.'' Boys will be, and should be, boys. Crossing the fun-line, however, is a review of the tormented president's latest column. ``If I wrote this way on my class papers, I'd surely fail out of Dartmouth. I am curious now to speak to Freedman in person. I bet he talks with his eyes crossed, or drools . . .'' Icky stuff. And a pity, given the excellence on the whole.

WASHINGTON, D.C.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+3>A</FONT>t their weekly meeting on April 22, Republican senators' legislative directors received their marching orders: they were to expect a cloture vote on immigration and then ``stall'' for the rest of the week. For many present, it was a low point in a month in which it had become painfully clear that despite having a majority in both houses of Congress, Republicans were unable to set the national agenda. Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole was ``listless and detached'' in meetings, recalls one Senate aide.
<P>
But that was before Sen. Phil Gramm and Speaker Newt Gingrich raised the issue of a 4.3-cent gas-tax cut. Dole started to demand that any increase in the minimum wage be linked to the cut and to labor-law reform. ``For the first time in a long time . . . Dole was aggressive and focused,'' says the aide. Dole wasn't the only one. Republicans were on the offensive again.
<P>
Even in a city where moods swing more frequently than the First Lady changes her hair style (not to mention her testimony), the effect of such a minor policy feint on the Republican psyche was remarkable. Together with the Clinton Administration's withdrawal of the nomination of the hapless Charles Stack for a federal judgeship, it was enough to pull many Republicans temporarily out of their funk. Yet the gas-tax initiative also highlights the small-mindedness of Republicans. They are prone to go in for measures that are piecemeal, reactive, and tactical.
<P>
Not surprisingly, then, defeatism has continued to plague the GOP. Some Republicans despair of the party's chances of holding onto Congress. Many more treat the Dole campaign as a grim joke. Highly visible spats within the party both result from this defeatism and cause it to deepen. Republicans are clashing over abortion, as usual, but also over campaign strategy, the role of Newt Gingrich, the proper response to organized labor's political resurgence, and the politics of the minimum wage. Participants in these sometimes unpleasant debates include almost every branch of the party: representatives and senators, state party chairmen and governors, conservatives and liberals. And that is the down side of the remarkable Republican success in 1993 - 94: Never before in a modern election has the GOP had to coordinate this many power centers. In 1988 House Minority Leader Bob Michel could have campaigned for Angela Davis and no one would have noticed; now many Republicans draw media attention. There are more Republican governors than at any time in recent memory -- and they are all over the lot ideologically.
<P>
This shows up most clearly on the abortion issue. Congressional Republicans' one unequivocal recent success was the partial-birth-abortion ban, which briefly isolated Clinton as an abortion-rights extremist. Moderate Republicans, however, could not tolerate this state of affairs, and so Governors Whitman, Weld, Wilson, and Pataki quickly diverted attention from President Clinton to intra-Republican squabbling. They announced their intention to lead a platform fight in San Diego. Whitman and Weld even defended Clinton's veto of the partial-birth ban.
<P>
This can perhaps best be understood as the political equivalent of a psychological disorder: Munchausen by proxy, a syndrome which leads sufferers to inflict illnesses on others in order to get attention for themselves. Gov. Whitman, one of the nation's most prominent Republicans, recently graced the cover of the New York Times Magazine under the plaintive headline, ``It's My Party, Too'' -- which certainly suggests a pathological need for attention.
<P>
It also reflects the fact that most abortion-rights Republicans know they can't win a fight at the convention. To judge by the states' delegate selections, the convention could well be dominated by committed social conservatives. Pro-lifers are a majority of even the Massachusetts delegation, much to Gov. Weld's consternation.
<P>
So instead of organizing at the grassroots, these Republicans take their grievances to the national media, which will always lend a sympathetic ear. If they stage a floor fight in San Diego and lose it, they can present the convention to elite opinionmakers as a replay of Houston 1992, thus strengthening their hand for 2000 in the event Dole loses in November. This sort of thing is nothing new. Says Don Devine, a veteran of the Reagan Administration and a prominent Dole supporter, ``I've been involved in Republican conventions for over twenty years, and every Republican convention brings out the 'shoot-the-wounded' Republicans. It's a disease outbreak we have to expect.'' But the weaker the candidate appears, the greater the likelihood that the disease will become an epidemic.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+3>W</FONT>hich is why Bob Dole's dramatic and wholly unpredicted decision to resign his Senate seat was exactly what the campaign needed. The World's Greatest Deliberative Body, with its individualistic members and arcane procedural traps, was working against bold revival strategies. ``Daschle and Kennedy are beating up on Dole right now, and Clinton has the luxury of sitting back and beating up on the whole process,'' a House aide observed last week. And maverick Republicans typically do some beating up of their own. Sen. John Chafee (R., R.I.) could, for instance, be the undoing of House Republicans' plan to send President Clinton another welfare and Medicaid reform bill. Chafee voted for reforms last year only as part of a historic, comprehensive balanced budget; he is unlikely to support meaningful reform in a stand-alone bill. Since Republicans have a one-vote majority on the Senate Finance Committee, his defection could kill the bill. ``I don't like any strategy that depends on John Chafee,'' says a conservative Senate leadership aide.
<P>
Dole will have to follow up his departure from the Senate with additional moves to reassert his leadership over the party. In the absence of adult leadership, the Republicans have been stealing a page from Lord of the Flies. They are picking on the most vulnerable among them -- and Newt Gingrich is Piggy, the rotund intellectual who gets felled by a rock. Surrounded by these squabbling children, Dole has been acting like a distant older brother. The Republican rank-and-filers who expect him to silence treasonous voices don't appreciate his aversion to conflict and controversy. ``His reputation [as a tough-guy] comes from a few stories newspapers play up, but conflict avoidance is how he really operates,'' explains a veteran Dole-watcher. (His father, Doran Dole, dealt with family conflicts in much the same way.) As majority leader, Dole has always found consensus by persuading and cajoling his colleagues -- not by twisting arms or knocking heads together.
<P>
Take his reaction to a recent foray by his crony Sen. Al D'Amato (R., N.Y.). D'Amato, who appears also to be afflicted with Munchausen by proxy, made waves by echoing liberal rhetoric to the effect that the Republican Congress had gone too far, threatening to inundate the nation with ``dirty drinking water.'' When challenged, D'Amato escalated, attacking Newt Gingrich and the GOP's ``philosophical ayatollahs'' (it wasn't clear which word he meant as an insult). Gov. Pataki joined the chorus, and even conservative Rep. Peter King (R., N.Y.) complained about the House leadership's ``Southern, anti-union attitude that appeals to the mentality of hillbillies at revival meetings.'' A Republican senator summarizes the situation: ``Bob has a lot of friends who are hurting him.''
Not only did Dole make no effort to keep his friends in line; within a week of Sen. D'Amato's first attack on Gingrich, Dole had adopted a kinder, gentler version of it. At a dinner for the GOP's major donors on May 9, Dole said that Republicans may have scared some people by going too far, too fast. The Speaker, he said, has a lot of ideas, and ``some of them are even good.'' This return of the pre-primary-season Bob Dole, anxious to distance himself from Gingrich and the Contract with America, came at an odd time: the Republican Congress is in fact more popular than Dole himself.
<P>
If Dole now means to change course, he still has to move quickly. On some Beltway types' reckoning, the campaign has a roughly six-week window of opportunity during which it must devise its message, approach conservative groups with it, and set them to work. If that doesn't happen and conservatives are left out, more of them will start saying they have no stake in Dole's election and that they will work for lower-level conservative candidates.
<P>
And who will tell straying Republicans that they had better get back with the party line? In 1988, would-be mavericks feared James Baker; nobody really thinks Scott Reed will come back to haunt them. One solution to both these problems would be to place a recognized heavyweight like Haley Barbour in charge of the campaign. The appointment of the aggressive Republican National Committee chairman would help greatly with both the message and the presentation, causing defeatists to take a long second look at the campaign.
<P>
Those defeatists have been thick on the ground recently. Conspiracy-minded conservatives suspect that some of the Dole-bashers want to tear him down so that he will be forced to pick Colin Powell as his vice-presidential nominee in order to remain viable. But the likely conservative dominance of the convention makes the Dole campaign wary of offering the vice-presidential nomination to Powell. Those opposed to a self-described ``Rockefeller Republican'' on the ticket wouldn't have to wait until November to express displeasure; they could embarrass the campaign, or even defeat the nomination, in San Diego. Which would be just as well: a Powell pick would hardly invigorate the demoralized Republican base.
<P>
A more charitable explanation is that some conservatives have been trying to position themselves as best they can in case of a blowout Dole defeat. That is certainly what is going on in the Republican Congress. When staffers are told that the passage of their pet bill would help Clinton, they often shrug and say, He's going to be re-elected anyway, so we may as well get the best deal we can while he's renting our issues. That attitude is particularly pervasive among that subgroup of Hill staffers known in Washington shorthand as ``policy people,'' but plenty of congressmen will say the same thing off the record. ``It's every man for himself'' is a phrase we hear with tiresome regularity on the Hill these days.
<P>
One good reason for Republican congressmen to be nervous is that, if their leaders have developed a new grand strategy since the dissolution of the Contract, they have yet to disclose it. As noted above, it has been all reaction, not a bold new attack.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+3>T</FONT>he rest of the panic is media-driven. One month the rap is that Republicans have gone too far, the next that they haven't done enough. The same Republicans go wobbly each time. All but the most steel-willed -- like House Majority Leader Dick Armey and Reps. Bob Walker (Pa.), John Boehner (Ohio), and Bob Livingston (La.) -- have lost the intellectual self-confidence needed to make the principled arguments against superficially popular proposals like boosting the minimum wage, or to take up new issues. They assume Clinton and the Democrats will be able to run rings around them in terms of tactics and public relations.
<P>
A disgusted Hill aide argues, ``It's like being a salesman and never going to customers because they don't think they'll be able to convince them. We have a lot of members who just do focus groups and polls but never go out there and make the arguments. They should find another way to make a living.'' Congressmen are coming into D.C. on Tuesdays and leaving on Thursdays, eager to spend time in their districts. 
<P>
Many conservative House members were outraged when they learned  that Gingrich had told moderate Rep. Chris Shays (R., Conn.) that if he wanted a vote on raising the minimum wage, he should get like-minded colleagues to sign a letter to the Speaker so that he could say he was forced to schedule one. In other words, his ``capitulation'' was orchestrated. When pressed on the issue by conservatives, Gingrich crassly defends a minimum-wage boost as ``an 80-20 issue'' (i.e., 80 per cent of the public favors it). The episode sheds light on the Speaker's leadership style and ideological malleability, and has allowed Dick Armey and Whip Tom DeLay to burnish their conservative credentials at the Speaker's expense. This leadership jockeying leads some on the Hill quietly to predict that Gingrich won't be Speaker next year even if the Republicans retain their majority. The lack of gratitude for his role in creating that majority in the first place is astonishing.
<P>
Rank-and-file Republicans cannot be expected to defer their intra-party battles until after the elections when highranking officials set a contrary example. The leadership that should be keeping them in line is part of the problem. Furthermore, as political analyst Stuart Rothenberg recently wrote, ``It's important to note that activists from both wings of the Republican Party share the blame'' for the recent fratricide. Conservatives and moderates also share problems that could be corrected if given some of the attention currently reserved for attacks on each other. All Republicans are too apt to complain about the lessons of the last year rather than absorbing them. For instance, they gripe about press bias and Clinton's demagoguery and duplicity. These are facts of life; complaining about them is pointless and can easily come across as whining (which is how some recent Gingrich remarks played).
<P>
Moreover, Republicans continue to suffer from communications problems going well beyond Bob Dole's rhetorical deficiencies. For the last year they have talked about means, legislative tools, while Clinton talked about ends; they rarely bothered to lay out the intellectual predicates for the policy changes they wished to enact. Too many congressmen still think they're in production rather than sales. Part of the solution is simply for Republicans to present their best face to the public. For example, Rep. Steve Largent (Okla.) should be joined by another Republican with star quality -- say, Sen. Fred Thompson (Tenn.) -- in pushing the Defense of Marriage Act. And for a party that sets so much store by federalism and civil society, Republicans are much too given to relying on the usual Beltway suspects, while underutilizing the wealth of talent outside the inner circle. On crime, for example, the public face of the GOP should not be Rep. Bob Barr (Ga.); it should be Charleston police chief Reuben Greenberg. On morals, ``Best Friends'' head Elaine Bennett, not her husband, Bill, should lead the way. On economics, it should be Godfather pizza exec Herman Cain, not professorial congressmen, expounding Republican views.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+3>A</FONT> real and lasting Republican recovery, however, will require more substantive steps. There is widespread agreement among Republicans that tax cuts must be an important part of the fall campaign. ``A broad-based, true-blue tax cut is the quickest way to the hearts and minds of the American people,'' says pollster Kellyanne Fitzpatrick. ``A quick and easy tax cut signals all Americans that the Republican Party wants to give them immediate relief and long-term hope.''
<P>
A leading Democratic operative recently told the L. A. Times that it was imperative to avoid ``a debate in which the primary difference between us is they want to cut taxes and we don't.'' And -- the most hopeful thing we've heard in many a day -- the Dole campaign is actually considering a 15 per cent across-the-board cut in income taxes. But watch that word ``considering'': campaign advisors complain that nothing has been firmly decided. And indeed, by obsessing about the deficit over the last year, Republicans have painted themselves into a corner where many feel uncomfortable proposing major tax cuts. They will have to be ready to answer charges of hypocrisy if they adopt a tax-cutting strategy now.
<P>
Republicans still have time to recover their footing. In generic ballots (where respondents are asked whether they would rather vote for a Democrat or a Republican for Congress), the GOP has pulled even -- which is ahead of where they were at this time in 1994. Even at the presidential level, Clinton's lead in the polls is much narrower among ``likely voters'' than among registered voters (the more-often-cited figure). And Clinton has vulnerabilities on the economy and on foreign policy that have barely begun to be explored.
<P>
That doesn't mean the GOP should be complacent; indeed, those Republicans who aren't defeatists may be banking too much on the passage of time and the magic of a national convention to restore their fortunes. But it does mean that there's no reason for concern to take on the coloration of panic. The distribution of open seats in Congress continues to favor Republican candidates; and since candidate recruitment took place at a time when Republicans looked stronger, the GOP is fielding a higher-quality team than the Democrats are. The sheer magnitude of the Democrats' task in retaking Congress is being widely underestimated.
<P>
Many conservatives have little patience with those who moan that Congress could be lost in November but never do anything constructive to prevent that from happening. Gingrich recently told the Washington Times, ``If [Bill] Bennett thinks the party needs excitement and passion, then Bennett should go out and be exciting and passionate.'' Adds tax activist Grover Norquist, ``It's a sin for people to whine that nobody's articulating the message when they're not articulating the message themselves. This is not a monarchy -- we don't wait for Bob Dole.''
<P>
A Republican collapse is by no means inevitable. If Republicans are willing to stop blaming each other for a November rout and start working to avoid it, they can still not only hold their congressional majorities, but expand them and recapture the White House as well. But they can't wait till October.

Dear Rusty,
<P>
<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->
Rusty
<P>
I've got to be totally honest with you, Rusty: it's nice to be on the winning team. I haven't felt this confident about things since the night before Super Tuesday in 1988, and let me tell you, after the first couple of rocky years of the Clinton - Gore Administration, this feels nice. But, Rusty, I never knew how much fundraising we were in for. In the past few weeks, Tip and I have been out every night. If we're not at a dinner dance for the DNC, then we're at a black-tie fundraiser for the Clinton - Gore '96 campaign. 
<P>
As you would imagine, the cynical press has raised its collective eyebrow over our fundraising efforts, even going so far as to suggest that what we're doing is ``selling access,'' to which I reply, That's only a danger if you think the President is some kind of wishy-washy weather vane, who adopts the opinion of the last person he spoke to. And that pretty much ends that. We're doing what every political party has to do: we're holding a few simple fundraising events. 
<P>
I'm sitting here in the tub, enjoying a quiet moment before Tipper and I have to get dressed up for ``Victory 1996: A Celebratory Dinner for Very Special Over-One-Mil-a-Year People.'' Last year, if you remember, after the pretty dismal 1994 election, we had to cancel the VSOP Dinner; this year, we filled up the Capitol Hilton ballroom twice! Once for lunch (``Victory 1996: A Celebratory Lunch with a Powerful Bureaucrat of Your Choice'') and once for the VSOP Dinner. 
<P>
As if that wasn't enough, there are a lot more events this week: ``Victory 1996: A Celebratory Breakfast with the President of the United States,'' which was oversold the moment it was announced. That prompted Bill, very generously I may add, to offer to eat more than one breakfast a day, for, as he put it, ``as long as the party needs me to.'' So now we've got Breakfast I and Breakfast II, for ``Golden Juice'' level donors (over $150,000); Luncheon I and Luncheon II with me, Tip, Bill, and HRC for donors at the ``Welcome to the Club Sandwich'' level (over $200,000); and the VSOP Dinner for those at the ``Fatted Calf'' level (over $300,000 over and over again). 
<P>
And that's just Tuesday. Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday we do it all over again. The sad part is, Tipper was feeling bloated after Luncheon I, so I had to caution her to pace herself. 
<P>
Next Monday, in what I think is a poignant tribute to the late Ron Brown, we're doing something he came up with. He called it the ``Businessman's Special,'' but we're calling it, in his honor, ``Victory 1996: A Very Special Tribute to Ron Brown.'' It's a simple buffet lunch with the Under-Secretary of your choice. Typically, what Ron liked most about the idea was the simplicity: ``Businessmen don't have a lot of time for the niceties. They don't want to talk to the guy at the top, they want to talk to the guy who makes the decisions,'' I can still hear him say. 
<P>
And when it came to making a decision about trade policy for China, we held a dinner called ``Victory 1996: MFN for China?'' and we were gratified by the response from Kodak, Lehman Brothers, Caterpillar, Citibank, Ford Motor Corp., Bechtel, Amoco, Goldman Sachs, Schering-Plough, PacTel, Wal-Mart, Coca-Cola, Chase, American International Group, Boise Cascade . . . and that's just to name the CEOs at my table. Bill was at a table for two dozen CEOs, which was made manageable by the very Chinese touch of a Lazy Susan - type arrangement which allowed Bill to kind of spin around the table every few minutes to give every diner ``his money's worth,'' as Bill put it. 
<P>
What's great about our lead over Dole in the polls (21 per cent and climbing!) is that, first of all, Bill's starting to get the kind of numbers that I've been getting so there isn't any more of that awkwardness between us. And second, now that our team has the winning edge, everyone wants to be on it. 
<P>
Hazel O'Leary, our Secretary of Energy (who is an African-American, as if that made a difference) held a dinner last week called ``Victory 1996: A Dialogue on the Gas Tax.'' The great thing was that every ticket was bought by Chevron. 
<P>
Bob Rubin over at Treasury put together a nifty brunch called ``Victory 1996: Behind the Scenes at the IRS,'' which was oversold the moment the invitation appeared on the Bloomberg. He's offered to take it ``on the road,'' as he puts it. That ought to pay for some 30-second spots in the fall, huh? 
<P>
Of course, I don't want you to get the impression that it's all about money. It's about a lot of other things that I could name, but Tipper just called up that the limo is waiting, so I'd better go.

<H2>Gingrich-Thought

<HR>
<P>
NEW YORK, MAY 7
<P>
These are hard times for Newt Gingrich, as everybody concedes. A month ago the story was out that House members in troubled seats were discouraging any prospect of a visit by the Speaker to endorse their candidacies. On Saturday, a left-oriented comedian, performing at the annual White House Correspondents dinner, enjoyed himself and a (very) few others by making jokes about every aspect of Gingrich's life, including his 13-year-old daughter's rites of puberty.
<P>
What is accepted as the Dick Morris formula is paying off. Clinton's instructions are to sound like a conservative/moderate in his speeches, while pursuing the left agenda as Chief Executive. He adroitly exploits the Republican ambiguists in the House and in the Senate. NR's Rich Lowry cites the debate over a welfare bill as an example. ``By the time Senate moderates are through with it, [the bill] could actually produce a presidential signature rather than a veto. What to do? 'Here's what we lay out for ourselves,' complains one Senate aide. 'If we pass it and he signs it -- we lose. If we pass it and he vetoes it -- we didn't get anything done. And if we don't pass it, he can't veto it -- but we're do-nothing. So, therefore, we lay out a scenario where whatever we do and whatever he does -- we lose.'''
<P>
Most conservative analysts are closing in on the matter of taxes. Mr. Gingrich is of course in favor of reduced taxation, but the accent he has placed on a balanced budget has got in the way of a political crusade on the subject. It is correct that there is danger in coming out for tax cuts without corresponding spending cuts. But it is also correct that Mr. Clinton has succeeded in framing any tax-cut proposal as an assault on the poor. And when Mr. Gingrich decided on military action and laid down his siege, he discovered that the leader of the besieged had the critical megaphone in hand, which he used repeatedly to criticize the army outside the moat, whose soldiers got colder, and hungrier, and lonelier as they struggled -- in the eyes of the American public -- to deny students and old folks access to the Statue of Liberty and the Library of Congress. 
<P>
The conviction is growing that the way to go is with a resounding call for tax cuts. When asked what spending cuts he would endorse, the typical Republican will come up with a favorite target or two, and then go vague. Even Pat Buchanan, campaigning for President in 1992, could not come up with recommended cuts of more than 1 per cent. That's the kind of thing that happens to people who engage in political life, even if their name is Ronald Reagan. That's the reason so much of the public is saying: Give us a tax cut -- and you figure out how and where to save the money. And at a more sophisticated level, there are those who are saying: Give us a tax cut with heavy emphasis on capital gains and please note the ensuing harvest. If Jack Kemp were omnipotent, he would cut taxes on productive activity and confidently predict that gross revenues would rise at least sufficient to make up the predicted revenue loss.
<P>
Newt Gingrich is overwhelmed by the political question. He has responsibilities not faced by opinion merchants. Thus on the minimum wage he makes his point, in order to stay on good terms with his philosophical network; but then capitulates, on the grounds that flesh-and-blood Americans who are running for re-election can't fight back against the charge that they would deny a worker a better wage than the current minimum. 
<P>
Even so, it isn't only sedentary Republicans who believe the time has come for Mr. Gingrich to return to the theoretical fastness. In the last analysis, the vitality of the conservative movement has got to depend on the communicability of truths. It is an untruth that the minimum wage helps the very poor, and the question then becomes, Is this one of the battles on which we should weigh in? There are two points of view on this, but a reduction in taxes is increasingly accepted as indispensable to philosophical prosperity, as well as political success. 
<P>
Newt Gingrich is greatly gifted. Maureen Dowd of the New York Times wrote over the weekend. ``Is he impressed with the way Dick Morris has refashioned Mr. Clinton's image as mature centrist?'' 
<P>
``Laurence Olivier plays many roles,'' Gingrich replied. ``If you stipulate somebody as a good actor, why should it surprise you when they act well? Is somebody who's always sincere ever sincere?'' You can't do better than to think your way through to such observations, or to phrase them that way. Newt Gingrich will be around for a good while, and that is welcome news.

The ease with which Newt Gingrich, Bob Dole, and their troops buckled under pressure on the minimum wage betokens an emptiness at the center of the Republican Congressional agenda. For nearly two years the GOP has neglected the pocketbook concerns of average voters, talking instead about budget-balancing and Medicare-fixing that by some time in the next century might have reduced long-term interest rates enough to make it easier to re-finance your mortgage while the Medicare Trust Fund inches its way back into solvency -- according to the latest CBO Trust Fund report, of course. No wonder the minimum wage seems like a vivid issue by comparison. Meanwhile, on other economic issues, House Majority Leader Dick Armey is on the right track with a package -- now endorsed by Gingrich -- that is likely to include the $500-per-child tax credit (the GOP's lone recent stab at serious middle-class tax relief) and other measures to get the government's hands off people's take-home pay. Gingrich and Dole are on the right track, too, with their call for a repeal of Clinton's gas-tax increase. But as long as Republicans are tame about taxes Clinton will co-opt them; he already has his own package of tax credits and is making favorable noises about a gas-tax repeal. The GOP can reach for bolder stuff -- actual cuts in tax rates -- or run on empty all the way to November..

Boris Yeltsin let the cat out of the bag in a Kremlin news conference on April 21, with his running-mate Bill Clinton standing beside him. The issue was NATO enlargement. Beaming with pleasure, Yeltsin said it was not being pushed right now, that the delay was ``at our request,'' and that his friend Bill had ``promised this.'' Moreover, no new members were going to get into NATO without Russia's agreement, or without changes in the nature of NATO itself. Clinton squirmed, and tried to claim in response that nothing in U.S. policy had changed. That, indeed, is the problem. When NR Senior Editor Peter Rodman wrote last year (``On the Scene,'' December 25) that the Administration had assured Moscow that NATO enlargement wasn't going to happen any time soon, the official denials were hot and heavy. Apparently, no one told Boris -- then or now.<p>

Only 10 per cent of the nation's newspaper editors, according to a recent poll, think that President Clinton has ``a clear foreign policy''; a whopping 83 per cent think he just ``reacts to foreign events.'' Nevertheless, 64 per cent of the editors approve of the foreign-policy job Clinton is doing. By a margin of 42 - 34, they think Bob Dole would do an even better job, which may mean, extrapolating from their Clinton answers, that they think his foreign policy would be even less clear.<p>

Oops. That wasn't supposed to happen. At least not yet. Medicare's Hospital Insurance Trust Fund is already spending more than it takes in -- $4.2 billion more in the first half of the fiscal year. Only last April the Administration had predicted a surplus. Those of you who pay (and pay, and pay, and pay) the Medicare tax are entitled to an explanation. Unfortunately, no one has come up with one: ``Hospital admissions of Medicare patients are rising more than can be explained by the number of beneficiaries . . .'' is the best a spokesman for the American Hospital Association can do. Both parties agree on the need for cuts. The hang-up is over philosophy. The Administration's plan calls for the same top-down price controls that have failed Medicare for thirty years, while Republicans want to give beneficiaries a choice between the current system, and a combination of private, high-deductible insurance, paid for by the government, and Medical Savings Accounts to help cover out-of-pocket expenses. Meanwhile, if we bumble along as at present, the Trust Fund will probably deplete its balance before the 2002 date usually forecast for that unpleasant event. And then the baby boomers start retiring.<p>

Labor Secretary Robert Reich recently credited the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) with the decline in national workplace fatalities that has occurred since it was created in 1970. But two economists, Thomas J. Kniesner and John D. Leeth, in the latest issue of the Cato Institute journal Regulation, say that Reich is like the doctor who claims to have cured you when in fact you were recovering by yourself before he first saw you. Workplace accidents were declining just as steadily in the decades before OSHA went to work as since. ``It is hard to conclude,'' say Kniesner and Leeth, ``that OSHA passes even the minimum criterion for the establishment of any government program, namely, Is it effective?'' (One quibble for the economists: Since when was that a criterion for establishing government programs?)<p>

When you raise the price of a good or service, the demand for it goes down. This, in a nutshell, is why most economists think that raising the minimum wage is a bad idea. It is estimated that a 90-cent increase (to $5.15 per hour) would eliminate 200,000 entry-level jobs by 1999. David McIntosh, a leading House freshman from Indiana, has a better idea for helping low-income workers. He would allow minimum-wage-earning taxpayers to keep the federal taxes currently withheld from their paychecks. Employers would not see any increase in the cost of labor under the McIntosh plan, and so the demand for low-skilled labor would not fall. Low-income families would enjoy higher after-tax income than under the proposed minimum wage. Preliminary estimates put the cost of this tax cut at $8 to $10 billion annually -- equal to about 10 per cent of next year's welfare spending. The resulting tighter welfare system will increase the number of the disadvantaged looking for work; the McIntosh tax cut will make it easier for employers to hire them.<p>

When Darrell Cabey teamed up with some other toughs to bully five dollars out of Bernhard Goetz, he never could have imagined the heist would eventually earn him $43 million in a civil suit. But thanks to his radical attorney, a Bronx jury, and an inept defense, Cabey is nominally America's most successful mugger. Think what you will about Goetz's culpability (he may have fired more bullets at the men preying on him than necessary), that decision belonged to the criminal court, which acquitted him of all serious charges. The question of whether Cabey deserved indemnification for the injury he sustained is easy. The law prohibits felons from profiting from their crimes; Cabey was out to rob. Even if Goetz had thrown a grenade at Cabey, he wouldn't be entitled to a penny. To a criminal, gunshot wounds are an occupational hazard, like housemaid's knee. Fortunately, Goetz happens to be penniless, so Cabey will end up getting what he deserves -- once again.<p>

Francois Mitterrand admitted posthumously in his memoirs that the purpose of European integration was to ``obtain independence from America.'' No surprise here: Mitterrand declared years ago that he preferred countries you could reach by land -- which evidently meant that he liked the Soviet Union more than the United States. Although Mitterrand's attitude to NATO was sounder than that of his predecessors, he still believed Europe to be an entity with values distinct from, and threatened by, those of the Atlantic Community. American policymakers will blunder if they continue to think that all forms of European integration are necessarily in America's interest. As a senior German politician explained with candor last month, a European defense identity -- an idea Mitterrand long advocated precisely because it implies a reduced American component -- was a way of reassuring (i.e., appeasing) Moscow. He added that Russia should belong to a pan-European security structure, simply because Russia was ``in Europe,'' while the American presence was optional.  Anyone who thinks that way is guaranteed to repeat some unpleasant European history.<p>

As reported in New York magazine, some black students at Columbia Law School set out to do something about the problem of racist cab drivers: after videotaping cabbies who refused to pick them up, they would report the drivers to the city for $500 fines. However, the sting did not work as planned. When one student wore a Columbia sweatshirt, every cab picked him up and agreed to take him to whatever destination he named, even to the heart of Harlem. However, when he was joined by a classmate in a dark hat and lumberjack shirt, 14 out of 15 cabs zoomed past. Two conclusions: 1) Cab drivers don't mind picking up blacks per se. 2) Cab drivers do mind picking up young men dressed according to the sartorial standards of criminals. And for many youngish black men in New York, including law-abiding ones, it is the height of fashion to dress like a thug: low-slung jeans, hooded sweatshirts, etc. Giving new meaning to the phrase ``fashion victim,'' taxi drivers figure that you are what you wear. The minute the real criminals figure this out and start wearing Ivy League athletic clothes, it will become impossible to drive a cab in New York.<p>

Fox News has entered the Sunday-morning TV competition with a news/interview show of its own. Official Washington was wary, given the conservative field markings -- Roger Ailes heads the Fox news division, and Tony Snow, the show's host, was an editor at the Washington Times and a Bush speechwriter. But the first show on April 28 corralled a bipartisan line-up of Dick Gephardt, Pat Moynihan, John Kasich, Linda Chavez, and Robert Shrum, along with top Israeli official Uri Savir. The show was fair and lively, an auspicious debut. Good sailing.<p>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=+3>W</FONT>HAT a difference an era can make. When free-market entrepreneurial economics were revived during the Age of Reagan, and classical thinkers such as Friedrich Hayek, Milton Friedman, and Joseph Schumpeter replaced John Maynard Keynes, John Kenneth Galbraith, and Paul Samuelson, the American economy flourished on a grand scale.
<P>
From 1982 to 1995, the Dow Jones industrial average increased 300 per cent (adjusted for inflation), or 11 per cent per year. All told, a phenomenal performance. Along the way, roughly 100 million Americans who own stocks and bonds (through brokerage accounts, mutual funds, IRAs, and other retirement plans) saw their net worth go up by an extraordinary $10 trillion, a 176 per cent gain, which annualizes to 8.1 per cent. From this rising wealth base, the U.S. economy created 29 million new jobs and produced a whopping 43 per cent gain in real disposable income. No other G-7 industrial nation has come close to this performance. It's a fact. You can look it up.
<P>
During the prior Age of Inflation, which I mark as 1965 to 1982, Democratic and Republican Presidents alike practiced Keynesian fine-tuning, de-linked the dollar from gold, inflated the money supply, raised taxes, imposed wage and price controls, and maintained tight government regulation over key economic sectors such as banking, transportation, and energy. Meanwhile, the U.S. stock market <I>declined</I> by 67 per cent (adjusted for inflation), dropping by an average of 6.5 per cent per year.
<P>
Of course, in recent years Reagan's tax-cut policies have been compromised, first by George Bush and then by Bill Clinton. But the damage so far has been manageable, and the tide has not yet turned back out to sea. The top income-tax rate, which stood at 70 per cent during the Age of Inflation, is now holding at 40 per cent. The 28 per cent capital-gains tax rate is much lower than the 45 per cent during the 1970s. Corporate-income-tax rates are in the low 30s, compared to their hefty earlier perch of the mid 40s. The inflation rate in recent years has hovered near 2 per cent; it was 10 to 15 per cent during the last years of the Age of Inflation. Interest rates today run from roughly 5 to 7 per cent; they were 15 to 20 per cent 15 years ago.
<P>
Just as important, although Reagan himself has departed from the public square, his <I>spirit</I> lingers on, especially among the new generation of business leaders that was spawned during the Eighties. These men and women came to live by the Schumpeterian growth model of innovation and risk-taking. They started new businesses on a massive scale, they modernized business practices through downsizing and consolidation, and they instituted sophisticated financial-management techniques every step of the way. Their footprints are found throughout the economy, in computer tech, telephone tech, information processing, autos, utilities, transportation, steel, textiles, and electronics.
<P>
And they went global. For it was Reagan who first opened free trade in Latin and Central America, then negotiated throughout the Pacific Rim, including China, and it was Reagan's political economy that caused Soviet Communism to implode, thus re-opening Central and Eastern Europe, then South Asia, and even kindling hope in the Middle East. In short, American -- not German, not British, not Japanese, but American -- business has provided the leadership and cutting-edge management infrastructure for the worldwide spread of democratic capitalism.
<P>
All that said, there is however a growing sense, at least in stock-market circles, that the best of our story may have passed. In recent months the market has stalled, interest rates have again started to rise, and inflation risk is in the air. A year ago, buoyed by the Republican capture of both houses of Congress, many believed that 1995 would bring a new installment of Reagan's agenda: another round of pro-growth tax cuts, serious entitlement reform, more deregulation, and substantially smaller government.
<P>
Yet none of this came to pass. Speaker Gingrich showed himself to be a shrill, uncompromising, and unpopular figure, unable to grow into the job. As a unit, the House Republicans were obsessed with dreary numerical budget formulas and the politics of austerity and sacrifice. Gone was Reagan's message of optimism and growth. By early 1996 the Contract with America was dead in the water, and its underlying policy agenda of tax cuts, smaller government, and cultural reformation had been tattered and muddled.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=+3>W</FONT>HAT'S more, politicians ranging from Pat Buchanan to Dick Gephardt have emphasized the darker side of the economic story. Real median family income, they have been pointing out, has slumped in recent years after recovering nicely during the 1980s. And Social Security and Medicare payroll-tax increases have eroded take-home pay.
<P>
Of course, when measured <I>properly</I>, the worker wage story over the past twenty years is quite a bit more respectable. Wage data exclude a sizable chunk of the modern worker's real compensation: health care, retirement, vacations, holidays, sick leave, and so on. When those generally untaxed benefits are added in per-worker annual income has been rising at a rate of 1.4 per cent. And, as the wealth numbers suggest, somebody has made good money. Even going back to the early 1970s, real per-capita consumption has averaged 1.7 per cent yearly increases.
<P>
Whatever the correct data, though, today's political reality reflects a cranky <I>attitude</I> of restlessness, irritability, and discontent among a major population segment. Many middle-income workers -- one might think of them as Reagan Democrats -- simply do not believe they have the financial resources to take care of their businesses or their families. In social and cultural terms the deck is stacked against them: racial quotas, illegal immigration, liberal courts, no-fault divorce, generation X dress codes, rampant welfarism, schools without prayer (or education), and government opposition to moral standards. To defend against moral slippage -- by putting their kids into private or parochial schools, for example -- middle-class folk need financial resources.
<P>
For this group, President Clinton's tired old big-government nostrums just won't work. Nostalgic for the social-insurance welfarism of Germany, France, and Sweden, Clintonites such as Robert Reich, Laura Tyson, Jeff Bingaman, and Byron Dorgan have come up with a program of higher minimum wages, more health care, more federal education money, more union power, more caps on executive pay, more community investment schemes financed by corporate pensions, and more limits on layoffs and restructuring.
<P>
Fact is, nearly everyone in America knows this stuff won't work. It never has. Just look at Europe, where a social-democratic model has maintained double-digit unemployment and blocked private job creation. More to the point, American politics has never favored class warfare or zero-sum economic pessimism. A few months ago a <I>Reader's Digest</I> poll showed that ``Americans in nearly every group -- across racial, economic, age, ideological, religious, educational, and sexual lines -- had the same median response: A family of four with an income of $200,000 should pay no more than 25 per cent in all its taxes combined.'' Polltaker Everett Ladd called it ``the single most extraordinary finding in the history of domestic-policy polling in the U.S. . . . America is probably the only country in the world where there are no significant differences by party or class in the 'ideal' fair tax.'' In other words, class warfare doesn't work.
<P>
But you cannot beat something with nothing. At this point, future economic policy and the stock market both stand at the crossroads. It is up to Senator Dole to renew and reinvigorate the optimistic economics of Ronald Reagan. This presidential election will not be fought over income inequality and redistribution, or over austere numerical balanced-budget plans, unless Republicans allow it to happen. And if they allow it to happen, they will lose.
<P>
To regain the political and economic high ground, the GOP should hark back to the 1993 gubernatorial campaign of underdog candidate Christine Todd Whitman. During the final weeks of her uphill quest, Mrs. Whitman hammered home one simple, clear message to the voters of New Jersey: ``You will spend your money more wisely than the government will.'' On this impeccable premise, her plan to slash income taxes across the board catapulted her to victory over incumbent Jim Florio, who had enacted the largest tax increase in New Jersey history. And it was Mrs. Whitman's plucky adherence to a bold economic growth plan that started the national Republican Party on the road to political resuscitation in the aftermath of George Bush's devastating defeat.
<P>
For Senator Dole, who campaigned hard for Mrs. Whitman, the lessons are very clear. Across-the-board income-tax cuts generate a powerful message of traditional family values because they show trust in ordinary people, who will spend their own money more wisely than government will. American families are more than willing to accept the risk and responsibility of making personal choices with regard to education (vouchers), health care (portability and medical savings accounts), and retirement (unlimited IRAs invested in private markets).
<P>
Add to the merits of personal responsibility the related demand for governmental accountability. Taxpayers insist that large-scale entitlements such as welfare and Medicaid be turned over to the states, where legislatures and governors will be more responsive to voter preferences than far-away Washington. People are increasingly convinced that generational welfare dependency, alcohol and drug addiction, family break-up, unlimited abortion on demand, and recidivist criminal pathologies are more closely related to soul-sickness than to the absence of material benefits. Ordinary people intuitively know that working together, through local churches, synagogues, schools, charities, fellowships, and self-help groups, is the only lasting solution to our nation's social and cultural problems.
<P>
Of course, across-the-board income-tax-rate relief is not only a values issue: it is also an <I>economics</I> issue because of the favorable impact on incentives. Tax credits are more manna from Washington, part of the old model that elites know best. Bill Clinton is at home with his own scheme for tax credits because it preserves the centrality of governmental planning, prioritizing, and allocation. The Clinton Administration simply does not trust the populace. Because of this, it will never agree to income-tax-rate cuts. Senator Dole, however, is in a position to -- and must -- acknowledge that those who work harder, save more, and are willing to invest must be rewarded through the incentive structure of lower marginal income-tax rates.
<P>
Today, a family-owned business that grosses $50,000 per year pays income tax at a 28 per cent rate and Social Security/Medicare payroll taxes at a 16 per cent rate. In most of the twenty largest population centers, state and local taxes take another 5 per cent. So, right off the top, the combined marginal tax rate takes away nearly 50 cents of every middle-class dollar earned. Senator Dole must champion the forgotten middle class with a bold across-the-board income-tax cut. Lower tax rates, higher tax-bracket thresholds, and a payroll tax deduction are far more powerful instruments of growth than government-given tax credits. After-tax take-home pay will go up; fresh incentives to earn, work, save, and invest will rejuvenate overall economic growth. And people will have much greater opportunity to form their own priorities, run their own businesses, and care for their own children.<P>
Income-tax relief can be seen as a down payment on future, more radical tax reform. Right now the Republican Party and the nation are split over which system would be better: a single flat-rate income tax or a national sales tax that replaces the income tax altogether. And after tax hikes in 1990 and 1993, a majority of taxpayers seem unwilling to give up large deductions for mortgages, charitable contributions, and state and local taxes in return for yet another politician's promise. Once the White House is returned to safe hands, presumably with a Republican Congress, there'll be plenty of time to thrash out the most workable plan.
<P>
Meanwhile, income-tax cuts will keep the focus on the individual. Right now the biggest tax burdens hit individuals, not businesses. The GOP is too quick to emphasize full depreciation expensing, or eliminating the capital-gains tax altogether, and not quick enough to address the combined burden of high payroll- and income-tax rates. On capital gains, for now, indexing would be just fine. But as Reagan understood full well, cutting income taxes is a populist issue, whereas cutting business taxes looks like and often is an elitist approach.
<P>
In Washington today economists are beginning to sense the middle-class public's growing desire for expanded economic growth. Thanks to back-to-back large-scale tax hikes in 1990 and 1993, this recovery cycle has produced yearly growth of less than 3 per cent, compared to a normal rate of better than 4 per cent. As a result, the nation has forgone nearly $2 trillion in income and nearly 6 million jobs.
<P>
But the solution is not to force the Federal Reserve into inflating the money supply. Already this year, fears of inflation have driven up interest rates. Investors are worried that government policies will shift toward easy money rather than tax cuts, lower budget spending, and deregulation. 
<P>
The Dole campaign should learn something else from Reagan's policy notebook: Inflation is caused by too much money chasing too few goods, not by growth. If across-the-board income-tax-rate cuts, along with higher-bracket thresholds, freshen economic growth incentives to produce more goods and services, then the larger volume of output would render the existing money supply <I>less</I> inflationary. Of course, when Paul Krugman and Larry Summers briefly worked on the staff of the Council of Economic Advisors during Reagan's first term, they argued that tax cuts would increase inflation. They were dead wrong. Smart men, wrong theory. Reagan had the story right. Now, Dole must draw from Reagan, not the Washington economic establishment.
<P>
The populist approach resonates with voters. It worked for Reagan, Whitman, Engler, Thompson, Symington, and Pataki, and it will work for Dole. Real simple: He raised them, I'm going to cut them. Across the board. For everyone. I led the fight in 1993, losing by only a few votes. Please give me a chance to finish the fight and win the war. People will spend their money more wisely than government will. The economy can grow by 3 per cent or more, with a steady dollar and no inflation. And folks will be freer to set their own moral standards in communities across the nation. I am optimistic about the ability of individual men and women to make our nation grow and prosper, and to supply jobs, income, and financial power well into the next century.
<P>
PS.: The stock market will signal that this is a political winner well before the November election is held.

Dear Rusty,
<P>


As hard as I try, I can't seem to shake this feeling that we're headed for certain victory in November.
<P>
I'm trying not to be too cocky. I remember well the days in 1988 when The New Republic endorsed my bid for the Presidency, and I thought to myself, ``Hey, TNR is about as in touch as you can get. If they like me, then everybody likes me.'' So, obviously, I'm keeping a lid on the counting-chickens department. 
<P>
Still, it's nice to have a comfortable lead. We had originally planned to spend the spring and early summer with a kind of ``Plan A'' and ``Plan B'' approach -- ``Plan A'' being a lot of appearances by me on Brinkley, CNN, and Meet the Press reaffirming my complete faith in the integrity and honesty of Bill and HRC irrespective of the
grand-jury indictments; and ``Plan B'' being Tipper's hunger strike outside the Little Rock jailhouse until they released HRC and waived bail. 
<P>
But, as things turned out, we didn't need either plan, so now, with three months to go before the convention and $22 million to spend, we're kind of looking at each other and thinking, ``Now what?''
<P> 
So when Chris Dodd, one of Connecticut's senators, and the chairman of the party's Senate campaign, gave me a call last week, I took the bull by the horns. ``Chris,'' I said, ``you and I both know that victory in November is a foregone conclusion. But I've always thought that it's important to plan the move after the next move. So what do you and Tom have on the agenda come January 1997?''
<P> 
``Me and who?'' Chris asked.
<P> 
``Tom Daschle,'' I said. ``Senate Minority Leader, and, after November, the Majority Leader.''
<P> 
``Oh. Right. Tom. Tom,'' Chris said. ``Tom's a super guy. I just love him to death, don't you?''
<P> 
``I'm fond of him, sure,'' I said.
<P> 
``He's a great little soldier; loyal, steadfast, maybe not the most visionary guy, but hey, that's not what we need in a Minority Leader, is it?''
<P> 
I was getting a little impatient. ``Yes,'' I said, ``there's something to that, but Chris -- ''
<P> 
``But a majority leader -- whoa. That's a
different-type cat altogether, no?''
<P> 
``Chris,'' I said, ``I'd love to chat all day with you, but I've got a meeting in a few minutes, and I really want to talk about the future, okay?''
<P> 
``Mr. Vice President, that's all I think about.'' 
<P>
And with that, he dashed off to a floor vote, after promising to call me back. In the meantime, I dialed Dick Gephardt's office.
<P> 
``Speaker Gephardt's office,'' a voice answered.
<P> 
"Is Dick in?'' I asked, after identifying myself.
<P> 
``Please hold.'' 
Which I did. For almost twenty minutes. You know me, Rusty. I'm not a stickler for protocol. And I wasn't personally insulted to be kept on hold, I was insulted for the office of the Vice Presidency. Look, I know that Dick and I haven't always gotten along -- heck, we both wanted our party's nomination in 1988, and while some people have characterized him as a half-witted knee-jerk big-government-liberal lightbulb-faced albino, I've always admired his keen legislative skill. 
<P>
So when Dick finally got on the phone with a cheery ``How 'ya doing, Al?'' I let the jarring breach of protocol pass -- I'm usually called ``Mr. Vice President,'' after all.
<P>
``I'm fine, Dick. How are you?''
<P>
``Doing pretty well for a guy who's 'so far left, he's left America.'''
<P>
``Excuse me?''
<P>
``Presidential Debate, the Sunday before Super Tuesday, 1988.''
<P>
``Sorry?''
<P>
``That's what you called me.''
<P>
``Well I was hoping we could move past that. It was eight years ago, Dick. And as you know, I've always admired your keen legislative skill. In fact, that's what I'm calling about. November. I was just wondering what your plans might be, after we take back the House.''
<P>
``Plans? Oh, I've got plans. I've got a million.''
<P>
``Care to share any of them?''
<P>
``Let me summarize them: Remember how it was when you guys had Tom Foley around?''
<P>
``Sure do, Dick. He supported us to the hilt -- always ready to help our agenda.''
<P>
``Okay. Well now he spends his day representing the National Aerosol Packaged Cheese Spread Manufacturers Association. Get me?''
<P> 
``C'mon, Dick. We've got to think -- not just about '96, but about 2000 and 2004.''
<P>
``That, Al,'' he said, ``is all I think about.''
<P>
And with that, he dashed off to a floor vote.
<P>
It wasn't easy, but at least I got those two to start thinking about the future. After all, that's all I think about, too

<H2>Are the Germans Guilty?
</H2> </CENTER>

<HR>
<P>
NEW YORK, APRIL 16
<P>
The new book that insists that the vast majority of the German people were exterminationist in word and deed (the title of Daniel Jonah Goldhagen's book is Hitler's Willing Executioners) is more merely than historically depressing. It is bad enough to be asked to believe that the huge majority of the German people were aware of Hitler's enterprise. It is horrifying to meditate on the question: How safe is it to assume, if that were so in 1938 - 45, that its equivalent isn't reposing in the minds and hearts of other cultures right now?
<P>
Professor Goldhagen's thesis will be disputed by other scholars, given that he is not everywhere furrowing fresh historical ground. His thesis is that the anti-Semitism of the Germans was so deeply rooted that they had no problem at all in going from what he calls the ``eliminationist'' stage (let us get rid of the Jews) to the ``exterminationist'' stage (let us get rid of them by slaughter).
<P>
There are, to say the least, some very rough edges in Mr. Goldhagen's thesis, among them that in describing the indifference to slaughter evidenced by the Germans when they conquered Poland he seems to be talking about an undifferentiated impulse to slaughter. It didn't seem to matter whether the victims were Jewish or non-Jewish, any more than it seemed to matter what was the attachment, religious or ethnic, of the hundreds of thousands (millions?) of East Europeans and Ukrainians murdered at both ends of the German invasion of the Soviet Union. If an entire population is inflamed with the lust to kill, how much does it matter who the victims are, except to those who wish to come up with a vague schematic handle for justifying an antagonism? At an academic level, researchers have written about those terrible years without concluding that the German people were empathic collaborators, let alone participants in genocide. At a personal level I am a friend of a German expatriate (he left Germany twenty years after Hitler) who even as a boy was given to sharing his father's necessarily concealed hatred of the Fuhrer. My friend's trade (in retail) keeps him in common touch and he reports -- frighteningly -- that he has encountered more anti-Semitism in America than ever he did in Germany. If this is so or even nearly so we have reason to question the most basic claims of civilization.
<P> 
It is a haunting question, and reduces to microcosmic measure. Mr. Goldhagen would have us believe that many, perhaps even a majority, of those killed in the years he writes about were killed by single bullets. Science came along with the extermination process, which could take care of hundreds at a time. But the support system even for extermination camps was extensive, hundreds and thousands of executioners, suppliers of lethal materials, barbed-wire manufacturers and installers.
<P>
But how widely was news of the enterprise known? The evidence is everywhere sobering. When Mao Tse-tung promulgated his Cultural Revolution he was able to count on the approving roar of the mob, which included sons and daughters of those proclaimed to be enemies of the people and therefore fit to die. In Cambodia they did have machine guns, but they did not depend on weapons of corporate death: there were enough individual peasant soldiers willing to kill one and one-half million of their brothers and sisters. In Rwanda - Burundi we think of tribal antagonism as generating the impulse to the killing of a half-million, but what is it that causes that tribal antagonism to go to genocidal extremes? Why does the Serb so despise the Muslim as to go to lengths one would never suppose a California Anglo would go to against a Hispanic?
<P>
Few of us have reviewed inflammatory anti-Semitic literature published in Germany during the twenty years before the Holocaust. But of course it exists, Hitler's own manifesto being of primary importance. There is anti-black (and anti-white) material published in America. We are all absolutely fatalistic about, if not acclimated to, episodic violence traceable to race and religion, but it is incomprehensible, if not inconceivable, that the kind of thing we have could develop into genocide. 
<P>
We have a considerable stake in hoping that Professor Goldhagen has himself committed sociological genocide. You cannot exaggerate the terrible implications of ethnic hostility. But if it is true that almost the entire German population actively contributed to what happened in mid-century, then no minority, anywhere, is safe.
<P>

Despite an all-out effort on his behalf by the Republican establishment, incumbent Rep. Greg Laughlin, a former Democrat, lost a primary runoff to Ron Paul in Texas's 14th District. Democrats hope that Laughlin's defeat will discourage other officeholders from defecting to the GOP (205 have done so since Bill Clinton's election). But in ex-Congressman Ron Paul, the Libertarian Party candidate for President in 1988, Laughlin faced a tough, well-known, and more conservative opponent. Laughlin is the least conservative congressional Democrat to switch parties so far; he has an anemic 58 lifetime rating from the American Conservative Union, and his voting record proved more important to voters in this conservative district than his spanking new party label. So Mr. Laughlin's failure to make a convincing conversion is unlikely to dissuade desirable conservative Democrats from fleeing across the aisle. Democrats might even the score by tempting undesirable liberal Republicans to join their ranks. NR would happily provide the names of Republicans who have shown every sign they'd rather switch than fight.

Economic conservatives are right to like free trade. Pat Buchanan's conservatives-with-a-heart are right to worry about its impact on vulnerable Americans. In our last issue, David Frum proposed a sensible compromise (``Living with Nationalism,'' p. 22) that answers both concerns: stop mass unskilled immigration. Current mass immigration is virtually worthless to Americans in aggregate, causes serious displacement of native-born workers, and is not at all logically linked to economic growth. Current economic research supports Frum's political case. For example, an article in the May 1996 American Economic Review by George Borjas, Richard Freeman, and Larry Katz estimates that 30 to 40 per cent of the recent widening of the wage gap between skilled and unskilled workers is due to trade and immigration -- but that immigration is perhaps twice as significant as trade in the calculation. Helping the unskilled begins abroad -- by keeping the foreign unskilled there.

At least one factor in GOP's 1994 sweep is gone, never to return: the complacency of the other side. The AFL-CIO last month approved a special 15-cent-a-month assessment on its members to help fund a $35-million anti-Republican blitzkrieg this fall. For a foretaste of hypercharged union political activity, consider the special election to fill Bob Packwood's Senate seat last January, where a union field staff of forty, large-scale mailings, and massive independent expenditures on advertising tipped the race to liberal Ron Wyden. Labor -- and the feminists and environmentalists -- are ready to fight to the death to preserve their threatened federal status quo. Unless the Right creates a countervailing sense of urgency -- the kind it mustered when opposing President Clinton's tax increases and health plans -- it will be bulldozed right back into righteous opposition. Talking up ``divisive'' issues like tax cuts, affirmative action, immigration, and crime would be a first step. If Republicans feel guilty about hitting the hot buttons, soon-to-air AFL-CIO attack ads will be just the thing to help them get over it.

It used to be a scarlet letter A. Today it's V, for Votetally. Those rankings, by the National Taxpayers Union Foundation, of congressional voting patterns seem to carry quite a stigma for sinners. Consider the shift in voting patterns uncovered in the latest NTU report: The ten congressmen ranked by Votetally as the biggest spenders of 1994 changed course dramatically in 1995; their rankings dropped by an average of 136. The second ten dropped by 76; the third by 72. All in all, declines occurred throughout the top third of the 1994 distribution -- a remarkable shift given the institutionally controlled nature of congressional floor votes. Members, chastened by that V on their foreheads, got religion. So why didn't more of the Contract pass? Look waaaay down at the bottom, at the most conservative penny-pinchers of 1994. They moved up by an average of 91 places in the 1995 rankings. The backsliding, NTU says, ``may reflect an attitude of complacency among those who thought they had done well in the [1994] study.'' A misapprehension, dispelled by the latest report, not to mention by the status of the Republican agenda.

In the aftermath of Oklahoma City, we discouraged our brethren in the media (to little effect) from portraying Timothy McVeigh as a man of the Right -- an only slightly more deranged cousin of Rush and Newt. With the arrest of Theodore Kaczynski, the suspected Unabomber, we similarly resist the temptation to link him to Kirkpatrick Sale or Al Gore. As David Gelernter, one of the bomber's victims and an NR contributing editor, wrote in Time: ``The tendency among some intellectuals and journalists to dignify with analysis the thinking of violent criminals has always struck me as low and contemptible. I couldn't care less what the man's views on technology are or what message he intended to deliver; the message I got was that in any society, no matter how rich, just, and free, you can rely on there being a certain number of evil cowards. I thank him for passing it along, but I knew that anyway.''

New York Gov. George Pataki has vowed to lead the fight against the Republican platform's pro-life plank in San Diego. He believes the issue has ``hurt the Republican Party'' and says, ``I think it is important that we make it plain that being against abortion is not the position of the Republican Party.'' This arguably places Gov. Pataki to the left, on this issue, of his predecessor, Mario Cuomo, who at least always maintained he was ``personally opposed.'' For the record, we would favor maintaining the anti-abortion stance even if it cost the party votes. But there is no credible evidence that it does. Polls show that among single-issue voters, pro-lifers outnumber pro-choicers by roughly 2 to 1. Pro-lifers would win any fair intra-party debate on the issue. But San Diego is not the proper place for one: it would turn into a circus ring-mastered not by Republicans but by the media. To fend off that possibility, Gov. Pataki's mentor, Sen. Al D'Amato, who claims to be pro-life, and Bob Dole, whose campaign D'Amato co-chairs, should point out to the governor the political obtuseness of his new position. While they're at it, they should keep an eye on Governors Weld and Whitman, who are also spoiling for a San Diego fight. By supporting President Clinton's veto of the partial-birth-abortion ban, these governors have shown that they are the spokesmen not for a major wing of the GOP, but for an extremist fringe. (Only 15 House Republicans voted against the ban.) Party leaders -- and journalists -- should treat them accordingly.

Even as Congress moved crabwise toward mild but welcome measures against illegal immigration, an incident in Southern California in which police chased and finally stopped a pickup truck carrying 23 illegals made the case for even sterner moves. Though everyone by now has probably seen the videotape of two white police officers beating two illegals while the other illegals fled into the bush, the issue is not really one of ``police brutality,'' much less ``racism.'' The truck had penetrated our porous border and led the police on a wild chase at 100 mph while its occupants flung garbage and metal objects at the pursuers. The videotape records 15 seconds. The chase lasted an hour. The driver of the truck is suing for $10 million, and might get it from the right jury. The fleeing illegals, no kidding, now have six-month residency permits. Thanks to the mass media's bias on immigration, the case has become a second Mylai. The ACLU has seized the opportunity to call for more affirmative-action quotas in police departments. But to most callers to California talk shows, and NR, these police officers are not villains but overworked and decent cops who were pushed too far. Their sins are trivial compared to their defense of their country and its laws.

NR has never before endorsed candidates in Italy. But if the Center - Right wins the national election on April 21, a contender for the premiership could well be Antonio Martino, former foreign minister, first-rate economist, and occasional contributor to NR. Italy's electoral system forces politicians, Left and Right, to form broad coalitions. The leftists, led by the renamed Communist Party, stand for continuing the old system of welfare and patronage for big business. The Right's most dynamic component is the southern-based National Alliance. Its leader, Gianfranco Fini, is the country's most popular politician, but he is simply too controversial for the premiership. No one expects that the Right's nominal leader, media magnate Silvio Berlusconi, distracted by legal attacks on his media empire and allegations of tax evasion, would be more effective in a new stint as premier than he was in 1994. So, as the most effective spokesman for tax cuts and economic liberalization, Martino could well be the respectable compromise candidate for prime minister. If he won, Italy would instantly become the intellectual leader at gatherings of the G-7 group of heads of state of the industrialized world.

In response to a wave of rocket attacks launched by Hezbollah from Lebanon, Israel retaliated -- and upped the ante. Israel's troops swept into southern Lebanon to expand the buffer zone, and its planes and gunships destroyed sites in Beirut belonging to Hezbollah and other radical groups. It was the first big Israeli operation in Beirut since the early 1980s. The real culprit here is Syria, which sees periodically giving Hezbollah free rein as a cost-free way of pressuring the Israelis. By humiliating Lebanon (Syria's puppet), the Israelis have demonstrated that it's not so cost-free. With the May election coming, Shimon Peres could do no less.

``The readers of the Boston Evening Transcript,'' wrote T. S. Eliot, ``sway in the wind like a field of ripe corn.'' So it is with the writers of the New York Times. To celebrate the hundredth anniversary of the Ochs - Sulzberger family's ownership of the paper, the New York Times Magazine surveyed the last century, and the resulting excerpts are depressing stuff: soft on tyrants (Herbert L. Matthews on Castro), laggard on freedom, but mostly dull and drab -- weather reports on the Zeitgeist, as far-sighted as a herd of manatees.

The first thing to say about seven-year-old Jessica Dubroff is that she was not a pilot. Nine years short of the minimum legal age to solo an airplane -- or for that matter to drive a car -- she was a passenger whom an indulgent flight instructor and father had permitted to manipulate controls so that she might appear to break some dubious record for youngsters flying cross-country. Reportedly, Jessica had recently been reading Hillary Clinton's It Takes a Village. In her case, a village might have done a better job of raising her than her two earnest, New Age parents. Her mother, Lisa Blair Hathaway, said she raised her children to be people of ``freedom and choice.'' She seems to have assigned absolute worth to these ideals without recognizing that they are prerogatives of adults who have taken life's buffetings; they must be earned. ``Children are fearless,'' she said. ``That's their natural state until adults ingrain fear in them.'' True enough. But she neglected the responsibility of parents to ingrain proper fear; an ordinate sense of one's limitations in the face of the world's dangers defines the mature mind. Miss Hathaway remembers Jessica as a little girl who had lived ``a full, wonderful, wonderful, exquisite life.'' It should have been a much longer one.

A weighty tome (417 pages) issued by the National Research Council deserves a lot more attention than it has gotten. Produced by a panel of twenty scientists, the report thoroughly debunks the ``natural is healthier'' theme that is in such vogue among regulators, activists, and elites generally. The report finds no basis for the notion that synthetic additives, pesticide residues, and byproducts of manufacturing are a significant cancer risk. On the contrary: ``It is the naturally occurring compounds in our diet, together with excess fat and calories, that have the greatest effect on cancer causation.'' The panel found ``no notable biological differences between synthetic and naturally occurring carcinogens.'' But because of the much greater quantity of natural carcinogens in the diet -- in cooked meats, cereals, spreads, fruits, vegetables -- they deserve the most attention. Seventy common, naturally occurring chemical constituents of food have both cancer-causing and cancer-fighting properties under different conditions and at different concentrations; disease defies simple notions of good and bad. Since most environmentalist health scares -- as well as the parallel illusion of the healthiness of the ``natural'' -- trace their ancestry to Rachel Carson's Silent Spring, Dr. William M. London, in Priorities, the journal of the American Council on Science and Health, has suggested that such alarms be dubbed ``Carsonogenic.''

The California State Supreme Court has delivered itself of a theological finding. Mrs. Evelyn Smith, a Presbyterian landlady, has been sued by a man and a woman who wished to live together and who had at first lied about their marital status. When Mrs. Smith discovered that the couple was not, in fact, married, she said her religion would not permit her to rent them an apartment. The court ruled that Mrs. Smith had violated the couple's right to ``freedom from discrimination based on personal characteristics.'' No mention of Mrs. Smith's right not to be morally affronted in her own home. Marian Johnston, triumphant attorney for the unmarried pair (who have since split up), offered an illuminating interpretation of the decision: ``We're not precluding [Mrs. Smith] from exercising her religion. We're just saying she can't bring it with her into the business world.'' In the opinion of the highest court in the nation's largest state, religion must be reduced to an emasculated cultural habit with no relevance to the actual conduct of people's lives. We don't care what you believe, so long as it's nothing.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=+3>T</FONT>HIS has been a winter of discontent for conservatives, one that left the high spirits of 1995 a frustrating memory. Budget defeats and infighting in the primaries have left them still more demoralized. Republicans in Congress fear taking on powerful but controversial issues such as official English and affirmative action. They ascribe to Bill Clinton and Dick Morris mythic powers of winning the public-relations battles that would ensue. And in some cases their defeatism extends to predictions that the GOP will lose its majority in the Congress.
<P>
At the grassroots, the Left is more energized than the Right for the elections. ``You can practically feel the malaise,'' says Amy Moritz, head of the National Center for Public Policy Research.
<P>
This mood is in part a byproduct of the political season, the dog-days between the primaries and the general-election campaign. Grover Norquist, the jovial strategist, argues that ever since ``the adrenalin rush in the first hundred days,'' conservatives have had been marking time. They should use the lull, he says, to build up their grass-roots organisations rather than grousing. 
<P>
Then, too, Beltway conservatives are still adjusting to majority status. Unrealistic expectations of a ``revolution'' after the 1994 elections set them up for disillusionment. A thin majority in the House and merely nominal control of the Senate ought to have led them to build the case for expanding their majorities by giving the public a preview of the tangible benefits they could expect from conservative governance. Instead they tried to govern immediately, believing that their triumph was historically inevitable and permanent. When Clinton declined to roll over as expected, says Michael Horowitz of the Hudson Institute, ``Many conservatives, particularly the younger ones, discovered to their shock that the other side can shoot real bullets.'' As a result, the Congress has so far delivered for only one group: speed demons made happy by the repeal of the federal speed limit.
<P>
And those early defeats have made them gun-shy. Where they once had over-ambitious goals, they are now nervous of having any goals at all. Their inability to devise a sequel to the Contract with America that would command broad support from lawmakers is an ominous indicator of the present mood. ``If you don't have a goal, you won't have morale,'' says Miss Moritz. ``And we haven't had a goal other than taking Newt's orders for fifteen months.''
<P>
But if specific mistakes and the constraint of having Clinton in the White House were wholly responsible for the current malaise, conservatives could be optimistic. But they have a deeper anxiety: is their coalition cracking up, its internal disagreements no longer submerged by a common desire to topple the mighty empire of Liberaldom? Even on an issue as central as taxes, conservatives have not reached a consensus. After two years of debate, supply-siders still see the tax credit for children as a sop to the Christian Coalition, and social conservatives still see the capital-gains tax cut as a sop to Wall Street. In this and other debates, different sorts of conservatives are too often walled up in their respective ghettoes.
<P>
When they're not hurling incendiary charges at each other. Charges of racism and nativism, for instance, have been bandied about freely, and other charges typically used by liberals to smear conservatives en masse have been brought into intra-family debates. Such conduct ftyhr tjos jave jadee beem [be has provided grist for liberals' mills and eroded the collegiality that used to exist on the Right.
<P>
And as conservatives fought these Beltway battles, they were losing touch with the concerns of conservative voters in the boondocks. The two candidates who won the most votes, Dole and Pat Buchanan, were the very ones most disliked by the conservative intelligentsia. Conservatives were, at best, irrelevant to the presidential race. Yet they have been remarkably disinclined to reflect on their role in the debacle.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+3>F</FONT>OR debacle it was -- and, moreover, an unnecessary one. In 1988, the three conservative candidates won about a third of the primary votes; this time around, economic and social conservatives combined were pulling much closer to 50 per cent. The conditions were there for a united conservative coalition to win the nomination and the election. While it's too early to know how a Dole Administration would turn out, it's not too early for recriminations.
<P>
On paper the choice was an easy one: either make a conservative case for the front-runner, or coalesce around a candidate capable of stopping him. A thin slice of the conservative intelligentsia settled for Bob Dole early. The rest played with weak candidates or non-candidates. A number of prominent conservatives, many of them clustered around The Weekly Standard, flirted with Colin Powell and Newt Gingrich -- helping Dole freeze out his actual competition for crucial months. (By the time they moved to the Lamar Alexander camp, their influence in these matters had worn thin.) Other conservative notables such as Norquist and Paul Weyrich adopted an airy nonchalance about the outcome; some even suggested that it might not matter if Republicans won the White House so long as they held Congress.
<P>
And in the absence of a unifying candidate, the Reagan coalition split, with economic conservatives backing Steve Forbes and social conservatives going to Buchanan. The Forbes campaign was an attempt by the libertarian minority of the coalition to overpower the traditionalist majority through the sheer force of money and the support of a portion of the conservative elite (the Wall Street Journal's editorial page and The American Spectator blew kisses toward Forbes on a regular basis). The effort backfired, magnifying the influence of Buchanan, the least pro-market candidate, in early primaries.
<P>
Few conservative leaders backed Buchanan (though Gary Bauer, Phyllis Schlafly, Human Events, and others indulged his departures from free-market orthodoxy). But the Beltway Right inadvertently helped Buchanan to exploit fissures in the coalition by blithely ignoring the sentiments of social conservatives. A steady drumbeat from D.C. had signaled that social issues, notably abortion, had to be pushed to the back-burner. Washington conservatives' blind spot on the familial and moral principles that animate the grassroots caused them to underestimate Buchanan's political potential.
<P>
The upshot: social and economic conservatives signed a suicide pact. Not only did conservatives fail to control the nomination, they marginalized themselves as well. A fifth of primary voters listed taxation as their most important issue. An impressive plurality (39 per cent) of them backed Forbes even as he was soundedly defeated (with 12 per cent of the vote). Arguably, the effect of his campaign was to set back the cause of tax reform. Buchanan, meanwhile, did even better among dedicated pro-lifers than Forbes did among anti-taxers. When he was going strong, Buchanan simply isolated religious conservatives from the rest of the party. In the end, the man who won the primaries owes very little to either economic or social conservatives; except for Ralph Reed and Pat Robertson, they've mainly given him trouble.
<P>
Phil Gramm deserves a good portion of the blame for this debacle. In many ways the logical candidate of the coalition, he apparently assumed he was therefore its inevitable candidate. (In this respect, his campaign was eerily reminiscent of Kemp's in 1988.) Dole, ironically, did a better job of courting it. Gramm might have recovered from his early errors in a longer campaign. But although everyone talked about the speed of the primary process this year, nobody was really prepared for it. Even NR, which did the right thing in endorsing Phil Gramm, did so too late to do any good -- and that was before Iowa, let alone New Hampshire.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+3>C</FONT>ONSERVATIVES overestimated their power in the nominating process for the same reason Gramm erred. They confused electoral victories for conservative candidates over the last three decades with a deep and systematic belief in conservative ideas on the part of the voters. The conservative ``movement'' exists in the minds of a fairly small number of people; many who march with it have no deep understanding of its principles. (Nor, apparently, do its pundits.) While there may be an inchoate conservative majority in the country, it's not there just for the asking. That majority has to be continually converted, recruited, and given rousing song sheets. 
<P>
Conservatives ought to ponder the possibility that their current difficulties are symptomatic of an underlying disease, one whose debilitating effects may last beyond November regardless of the election results. Richard Vigilante saw the danger as early as 1985. Writing in NR's 30th anniversary issue, he warned that the conservative enterprise had become ``too large and too busy for philosophical reflection. If it does not find, or is not given, a clear, simple sense of what holds it together, it will split apart, ruptured by confusion and opportunism.'' Conservatives are not receiving that kind of intellectual sustenance, and are therefore increasingly adrift.
<P>
If conservatives are on intellectual autopilot, much of the explanation may lie in the culture of that network of thinkers, writers, and activists, (too) largely located in Washington and New York, whom one might designate collectively as ``conservative opinion leaders.'' They are, in short, an elite -- and they act like one. Too many conservatives are operating on a stale and derivative, even if largely accurate, orthodoxy. If popular concerns fit into that orthodoxy -- for instance, anti-tax sentiment -- they can respond readily enough, and win votes by doing so. Other anxieties -- notably, over the nation's cultural fragmentation -- just pass under their radar screen.
<P>
But the Right's strength since the Fifties has largely been built by diagnosing the grievances and anxieties of ordinary Americans and responding to them with real remedies. It is now losing touch with its base and its potential support. Thus conservatives are constantly being caught off guard by swings in the popular mood. (A case in point: the panic over ``worker anxiety'' after Pat Buchanan's showing in New Hampshire.) On occasion they have even tried to suppress discussion of the public's cultural anxieties. Instead of asking why so many grassroots conservatives opposed NAFTA, for instance, the Beltway elite simply told them they were being paranoid. A political movement in touch with its supporters can tell them when they're wrong; it can't tell them that they're not worried.
<P>
One Reaganite, herself a Beltway insider, decries ``the pernicious influence of the think-tank approach to life and politics. In the Seventies and Eighties, they did a terrific job of giving policy articulation to inchoate political resentments. But the policy articulation has now floated free of the political ground from which it originally sprang.'' The think tanks tend to reduce politics to a set of discrete policy areas without providing an overarching philosophy to link them.
<P>
Worse, conservative intellectuals seem unable to distinguish between their role and that of conservative politicians. They take care to keep their arguments safely within the confines of the politically ``possible'' while perhaps seeking to nudge those boundaries rightward. ``Too many people are writing op-eds which picture them in the campaign bull session or in the committee mark-up room,'' complains Lawrence Kudlow. As a result of this sort of positioning, conservative leaders lose sight both of first principles and of their own social base.
<P>
Meanwhile, the occasional mention on the Style page has gone to some of their heads. The immersion of many conservatives in the celebrity culture -- and particularly their willingness to caricature their ideas in order to make them sellable on television -- has been corrupting. With some honorable exceptions, they entertain viewers with their political movement and in the process are domesticated and rendered ineffectual. Blurring the line between politics and entertainment tends to make conservatives -- especially those in the Beltway -- seem cynical and frivolous.
<P>
Indeed, fin-de-siccle conservatism is increasingly concerned with matters of style, straining to make itself appear fashionable. Conservative chic often accompanies a tiresome triumphalism. The implication, notes Kudlow, is that ``we've won, we're cool, and you better join us'' -- as if the goal of conservatives were to replicate the smugness of a liberal Georgetown cocktail party. The result is not so much moral compromise, though it is sometimes that, as the political myopia that was evident during the primaries.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+3>G</FONT>IFTED and principled political leadership would go far to cure the conservative malaise. But no one since Reagan has emerged to provide a focal point for conservatives. Jack Kemp and Bill Bennett, icons to almost all conservatives just a few years ago, lacked the stomach to audition for the role. Instead, they have gone out of their way to annoy other conservatives; their remaining influence derives mostly from good press. Newt Gingrich, for his part, has proved unable to lead congressional Republicans and the conservative coalition simultaneously in the face of a hostile press. By default, then, Rush Limbaugh is the most visible conservative on the national scene. He is a force for common sense, but, wisely, he has declined to play a role for which he is not suited.
<P>
Conservatives cannot afford to wait for another Reagan to come along. Former NR publisher William Rusher says, ``I share the nostalgia. But the Lord does not always provide you with Ronald Reagans. We were badly spoiled and sometimes you have to do without.'' It is especially unbecoming for conservatives to complain that Bob Dole dispirits them when their own fecklessness did so much to ensure his nomination. One thoughtful observer of the Beltway Right expresses exasperation with the current conservative mood: ``All these people who are lamenting that we don't have a Reagan are betraying his legacy, which was a can-do spirit. If he were at these meetings he'd be asking how we could aggressively push forward, not kvetching that there's no Reagan.''
<P>
If Bob Dole is elected, it will make a difference whether the dominant faction of the party he leads is rudderless and confused, or vigorous and clear-headed. Tom Pauken, chairman of the Texas Republican Party, warns that if economic and social conservatives do not form a successful governing coalition in the next few years, ``You're going to see the splintering of our movement, you'll see conservatives start leaving the Republican Party, you'll see third- and fourth-party movements, you'll see a phenomenon in which people after a while just kind of bail out of the whole political system.''
<P>
Or conservatives could use the Dole interregnum to regroup, developing a higher degree of ideological self-consciousness and becoming accustomed to the political discipline of governing. They must simultaneously hold the conservative coalition together; keep the GOP anchored within a conservative, antistatist consensus while tackling new cultural and economic anxieties. A movement beset by inertia will be unable to accomplish any of these tasks. So far, however, conservatives don't seem to grasp that there's a problem.

I have to be honest with you. Your last letter disturbed me. I don't think it was fair to call us ``too cocky by half.'' It just so happens that the American people are happy with what we've done and are eager to have us do more of it.
<P>
I could quote poll numbers and cite focus-group findings all day. But the truth is, we're going to win because we have a secret plan.
<P>
Okay, it's not a completely secret plan. I mean, I'm authorized to tell a few people. Tipper, for one, and you, and Joe Klein makes three . . . 
<P>
Here it is: for the next six months or so, Bill, HRC, Tipper, and I are pretty much going to live in California full time. Bill's taken a suite at the Sheraton Miramar in Santa Monica, Tip and I are looking at property up north, in Marin County, and HRC is going to kind of divide her time between San Diego and the Central Coast.
<P>
I wasn't sure about it at first. But Tipper convinced me.
<P>
``I don't know, Tip,'' I said. ``Won't the people in California see right through us?'' 
<P>
``What are you talking about?'' she asked. ``And don't stop packing.'' 
<P>
``Well,'' I said, ``we've already ordered more B-1 bombers, we're talking about cracking down on illegal immigration, and now we're all going to move to the state and pretend it's all a coincidence?'' 
<P>
Tipper held a ``Heal the Bay'' T-shirt against me. ``Does this still fit?'' she asked. It did, so she tossed it into the duffel bag. 
<P>
``Look, Al,'' she said. ``What I know is we start with an electoral-vote deficit of about one hundred. And California has over half that.'' 
<P>
``Yes, but how dumb do you think the people in California are?'' 
<P>
``Um . . . If you lived in an area that periodically suffered devastating, property-destroying brush fires, would you keep rebuilding million-dollar houses there?''
<P>
``No.''
<P>
``Okay. Say you had a nice house on the beach. But every year, violent storms would wash it away, leaving you with nothing but a pile of driftwood and some sandbags. Would you, A) move; or B) build a new house in the same place?''
<P>
``A?'' 
<P>
``Good. Now say that you lived in an area in which, periodically, the earth shook violently for several seconds, leveling houses, freeways, bridges, destroying property, and killing people. What would you do?''
<P>
``Gosh, I'd move.'' 
<P>
``But what if you didn't?'' 
<P>
``Why wouldn't I? What am I, stupid?'' 
<P>
And then the light bulb went off above my head. I smiled at Tipper. 
<P>
I called Dad that afternoon to tell him the news. 
<P>
``Dad, Tipper and I are going to live in California for a while.'' 
<P>
``Wait a sec,'' he said. I could hear him picking up his highball. I could hear the ice tinkling in the glass as he sipped. 
<P>
``Is it November already? Did you guys lose?'' 
<P>
``No, Dad,'' I said as patiently as I could. ``We're just going out -- '' 
<P>
``Don't tell me. It's a must-win state and you're going to spread a little money around?'' 
<P>
``Well, I might quibble with your gloss, but -- ''
<P>
``Kiddo, let me give you a piece of advice. Wait a sec.'' I heard him pick up his highball, wipe the sweat off the glass, then take a big sip. ``Kiddo,'' he said, ``do you really think you're going to be able to make sense out of that state? They're the people who gave us Ronald Reagan and Jerry Brown in the same year! They put shrimp on their pizza! They hire illegal aliens for a buck an hour to do the cleaning and the gardening and the odd-jobs around the house and then they complain that the illegals are ruining the state! The last time we Southerners had a deal like that we went to war to keep it!'' 
<P>
``Dad -- '' 
<P>
``And they keep building their damn houses on fault lines or tinder boxes or storm fronts.'' 
<P>
``Dad -- '' 
<P>
``You'll go out there, spread the money around, order some bombers and a missile-defense system or two, build more freeways, and do you know what those lunatics out there will do? They'll vote for the Libertarian -- or worse: they'll vote for that funny-looking guy with the big ears.'' 
<P>
``Prince Charles?'' 
<P>
``No! Then again, maybe -- they're weird out there.'' 
<P>
And with that, Dad hung up. Or maybe he put his drink down on the phone, I'm not sure. 
<P>
The point is, Rusty, we have a plan. Gotta go reset my watch!

<H2>Colin Powell, VP
</H2> </CENTER>

<HR>
<P>
NEW YORK, MARCH 29
<P>
Concerning the proposal: Colin Powell for Vice President, a few observations:
<P>
1. The primary qualification for a vice-presidential selection is: Will he substantially enhance the probability of the election of the presidential candidate?
<P>
On the matter of General Powell, the answer to that question, at this reading, is Yes. In fact, his name conjoined to that of Bob Dole makes up the only slate that would defeat Clinton - Gore. Granted, the popularity of General Powell would almost certainly diminish soon after he began to campaign. In part his high prestige rests on his reputation as an Olympian figure, undefiled by politics.
<P>
It was so with General Eisenhower in 1952. The New Leader magazine illustrated the sharp turn in public opinion the week after Eisenhower's first political address in his home state. The headline was ``IKE STOPPED AT ABILENE.'' It is not even safe to assume that Powell would sweep the black vote. The last estimate on this question, in October, was that he would carry 30 per cent of black Americans. But that is a critical swing, given that 95 per cent have gone Democratic over the years. And, true, the fact of a black on the national ticket would turn some white voters away. The awful social/ethnic division highlighted by the reaction to the O. J. Simpson verdict instructs us that there is a body of Americans not yet prepared to vote for a black candidate. As much is probably true of a Jewish candidate; as much was certainly true of a Catholic candidate up until JFK. 
<P>
2. The ideological objections to General Powell as Vice President are of an entirely different order from what they'd have been if he were running for President. A presidential candidate's position on such high-ignition questions as abortion and affirmative action matters substantially. The voters are asked to express their choice both politically and symbolically. If Bob Dole were flat-out in favor of abortion he would not win, either the nomination or the election. 
<P>
It is another thing when it is a vice-presidential candidate being considered. For one thing, by accepting the nomination, the vice-presidential candidate subordinates his position on divisive issues, deferring to the presidential candidate. It is simply inconceivable that nominee Powell could tour the country during the fall taking issue with Dole's position on abortion or for that matter any other important political question. The last time that happened was Andrew Jackson - John C. Calhoun. If the voter were deciding whom to vote for on the assumption that Dole would die or retire, it is hardly probable that on being sworn in, President Powell would reverse his predecessor's position on abortion. 
<P>
On the question of affirmative action, the Republican delegates in San Diego are going to realize that the direction the debate will take depends on two factors. The first is how the plebiscite that would forbid affirmative action fares in California. The second is how the Supreme Court, which is narrowly divided on the issue, swings. Affirmative action is an empirical failure and a philosophical disaster. Its destiny is not in the hands of the Republican nominee for Vice President. 
<P>
3. On the matter of Powell's designating himself as a ``Rockefeller Republican'' we are constrained to ask two questions. The first is, Did it substantially damage Gerald Ford when he named Rockefeller as Vice President in 1974? Evidence is not abundant that the selection was an abomination among Republicans of the day. And this was owing to two factors that have been lost in the mists of memory. The first is that although Rockefeller had been the embodiment of liberal Republicanism, he was always on the right side on foreign policy: the anti-Soviet side. A second is that the Rockefeller of the Seventies was, on domestic questions, a changed man. I was present at a small dinner party in 1972 when Governor Rockefeller raised his glass to Governor Reagan and said that he needed to admit that on most domestic issues, Reagan had been wiser than he. 
<P>
4. If Colin Powell accepts the nomination, nothing like the treachery suggested will have been done. In 1964 I urged candidate Goldwater to name ex-President Eisenhower as his running-mate. Quixotic stuff, but an early recognition that a presidential candidate wants a running-mate who will help him get to the White House, and it dazzles the imagination that anyone who cares about abortion or affirmative action would in effect endorse the re-election of Bill Clinton for the platonic satisfaction of a loyalty-test rejection of Colin Powell.

Who says Ross Perot is unpredictable? As soon as Bob  Dole wrapped up the nomination and the press needed something to write about, the Texan stepped into the vacuum with media-teasing talk of running for President again (but only, of course, if his supporters and hired political operatives around the country draft him). Perot represents the rot of American politics, a populism that is off the point (avoiding the gut-level issues that bother Americans), mindless (refusing to distinguish between the GOP Congress and President Clinton), and destructive (seeking, ultimately, to encourage cynicism among the voting public). After bringing the balanced budget to the fore in 1992, Perot stood idly by as Republicans banged their heads against a wall trying to enact one. Now, naturally, he attacks them for failing. The focus of Perot's 1996 campaign will be campaign-finance reform. So, naturally, he will spend $60 million of his own cash denouncing the role of money in politics. Enough people seem to be onto this act that Perot will be relegated this time around to single digits (where his support will be drawn in unpredictable proportions from Dole and Clinton). Then, this particular crazy aunt will finally be put back into the basement.

On March 28, the Senate Judiciary Committee adopted an amendment to the immigration-reform bill introduced by Alan Simpson (R., Wyo.) to increase -- yes, increase -- legal immigration by more than 100,000. The amendment's supporters, including Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.), Spencer Abraham (R., Mich.), Paul Simon (D., Ill.), and Mike DeWine (R., Ohio), manipulated statistics to present their plan as a moderate reduction in family-preference and ``diversity'' immigration. But Rosemary Jenks of the Center for Immigration Studies points out that while the original Simpson bill would have cut total legal immigration to an estimated 600,000 a year during the first five years, and to just over 450,000 thereafter, the Kennedy - Abraham amendment would push legal immigration to more than 830,000 while reducing the share of visas for skilled workers from 20 per cent under the original bill to a maximum of 15.6 per cent. (Unused visas for skilled workers would be allocated to family-based immigrants, although the immigrationists tell us that there is a shortage of skill-based immigrants.) Kennedy, Abraham, Simon, DeWine, Orrin Hatch (R., Utah), Patrick Leahy (D., Vt.), Dianne Feinstein (D., Calif.), and Russ Feingold (D., Wis.) voted for the amendment; Simpson, Strom Thurmond (R., S.C.), Hank Brown (R., Colo.), and Jon Kyl (R., Ariz.) voted nay. That makes the breakdown: Republicans, opposed; Democrats and Mugwumps, in favor.

In 1998, get ready for Tom Campbell, Republican senatorial nominee from California. At least that's what the moderate congressman was thinking when he hatched the idea of switching California's primaries from ``closed'' to ``open.'' Translation: Instead of only Republicans being permitted to vote for their party's nominee, Democrats can vote in the GOP primary too (and vice versa). The intention is to make it easier for moderates like Campbell -- who narrowly lost to conservative Bruce Herschensohn in a 1992 primary -- to draw the votes of Democrats and dilute the strength of conservatives. Bankrolled by the late David Packard, a Campbell backer, a ballot measure to open the primaries, effective in 1998, passed easily in late March. Both parties opposed it. But the battle was lost early on when ballot language was approved describing Proposition 198 in such goo-goo terms that voting against it seemed like opposing democracy itself. Now the parties have to figure out another way -- perhaps a law suit or a counter-initiative -- to preserve the integrity of their primaries. As for Campbell, there's nothing about his eager desire to win Democratic primary votes that a simple switch in registration wouldn't satisfy.

The Freemen, currently holed up near tiny Jordan, Montana, ran an elaborate check-fraud and counterfeiting operation that since late 1994 bilked businesses and the government of around $1.8 million. They held seminars on tax evasion and check fraud for other free spirits from across the nation. They set bounties on local officials and threatened their lives. And they did it all undisturbed by federal law enforcement. The Freemen are the Loony Right's answer to Rodney King. America's most famous drunk driver, you'll remember, has a free pass for life from an LAPD not eager to tangle with him again. The Freemen almost got similar treatment from the FBI and its director, Louis Freeh, rightly chastened by Waco and Ruby Ridge. Members of the Freemen had been indicted by a federal grand jury for offenses related to their creative financing back in May 1995. But the FBI didn't dare arrest them. It took the local county attorney begging for action, and a local farmer rounding up a 25-man posse to storm the group's stronghold, before the feds acted. Now that there is a siege on, the FBI is wise to heed the lessons of the past and take it slow. But a lesson can be learned too well. Mr. Freeh, it's OK to arrest nuts when they also happen to be crooks.

We're all free-traders now. Right? Wrong. Case in point, the latest G-7 conference on employment. Further liberalization of world trade, said Jacques Chirac, requires ``a few basic rules'' to be applied universally ``so as to guarantee the dignity of the working man, wherever in the world he may be.'' Translation: The onerous employment restrictions that make it nearly impossible to downsize in Europe, along with European-style entitlements (and their corollary -- high rates of unemployment and taxation), must be adopted in the U.S. and Japan. Chirac avers that different wage and employment laws would be ``less and less tolerated'' as international competition grows. We agree: left to itself, free trade will invariably shrink government in countries that have too much of it. But Robert Reich is supporting Chirac, and the International Labor Organization in demanding uniformity -- at Europe's levels. Perhaps someone should teach the Labor Secretary some French, as in, Vive la difference.

A cohort of GOP leaders, from Dole and Gingrich on down, appeared at a March 21 news conference to announce the Defend America Act of 1996. Its aim is to require the deployment by 2003 of an anti-missile defense for the United States. President Clinton, in thrall to outmoded strategic doctrines, vetoed a similar provision in the 1996 defense-authorization bill and has slowed down procurement of theater missile defenses as well. But the congressional leaders rightly cited the emerging missile threat not only from rogue states like Iran, Iraq, and North Korea, but also from China: Gingrich quoted a Chinese official who recently boasted to a visiting American that Taiwan was vulnerable because the U.S. would never risk Los Angeles. Protecting this country and its forces and friends abroad is an obvious strategic priority -- a political priority, if the Democrats shirk it.

The National Association of Scholars has just issued a study called ``The Dissolution of General Education, 1914 - 1993,'' documenting the precipitous drop in mandatory coursework in American universities and colleges, particularly since the 1960s. This amounts to the loss of a common core of knowledge once deemed essential to a liberal education; college students can now remain intellectual freshmen for four years. In 1914, 98 per cent of elite schools required English composition; by 1993, the figure had dropped to 36 per cent, making way for the advent of remedial English comp, which is often merely a diet of ``free writing'' exercises. Courses in foreign languages were required by 90 per cent of top schools in 1964, by 66 per cent in 1993; courses in history, by 38 per cent in 1964, 12 per cent in 1993. The proportion requiring literature courses dropped from 57 per cent in 1914 to 14 per cent in 1993, mathematics courses, from 82 to 12 per cent. The study concludes that the well-structured general education has ``largely vanished,'' causing ``a purging from the curriculum of many of the required basic survey courses that used to familiarize students with the historical, cultural, political, and scientific foundations of their society.'' In this light, multiculturalism begins to make sense: it gives students the soothing feeling that what they don't know isn't worth knowing.

This week's new disease is hyperlexia. It means taking, quote, an ``unusual'' interest in letters and numbers, and learning to read and spell, quote, ``too soon.'' In other words, being a bright kid.

Bishop Fabian Bruskewitz of Lincoln, Nebraska, has put his flock on notice that they must choose between being Catholics in good standing and belonging to organizations that oppose Church teachings. The proscribed organizations include Planned Parenthood and the Hemlock Society, as might be expected, but also super-traditionalist groups that reject the Second Vatican Council as heretical. The media blazoned, ``Bishop Threatens to Excommunicate Dissenting Catholics.'' Another way of putting it is that Bishop Bruskewitz is doing his pastoral duty in alerting people to the fact that they have removed themselves from communion. He apparently believes that he who affirms A on Sunday cannot affirm not-A on Monday. Public, persistent, and knowing agitation against the teaching of the Church is not compatible with membership in it. That's not so difficult to grasp. While canon lawyers reportedly mull the legal niceties of the bishop's action, we believe that he has made a very good start that other church leaders (and not only Roman Catholic) might think about emulating.

Any kid can figure out how to get on the Internet, but the IRS, after spending $4 billion to modernize its 1960s-era computers, still has to truck taxpayers' records from one office to another on magnetic tapes. The Treasury Department acknowledges that the IRS modernization is ``badly off track,'' but has not called off plans to spend over $16 billion more. Still, if that's all it costs to keep the IRS primitive, it's a bargain.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=+3>F</FONT>OR American liberals, Thomas Jefferson is the cultural hero par excellence, cherished for his positions on freedom of expression and on separation of Church and State and for his populistic rhetoric. (That this was a populism for whites only is a fact which American liberals have managed not to address.)
<P>
Of course Jefferson is a hero to many Americans apart from liberals, and his admirers include, as we now know, some white right-wing terrorists. On July 3, 1995, the Washington Post published Serge Kovaleski's profile of Terry Lynn Nichols, the second man charged in the Oklahoma City bombing. According to Kovaleski, Nichols read the works of Thomas Jefferson and Thomas Paine and was particularly inspired by Jefferson's maxim, ``The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants.''
<P>
According to CNN News (January 31, 1996), the first suspect in the Oklahoma City bombing, Timothy McVeigh, was wearing a T-shirt carrying those same words at the time he was arrested while driving away from Oklahoma City. The CNN correspondent, Susan Candiotti, put a question about the T-shirt to McVeigh's lawyer, Stephen Jones. Jones replied: ``Well, if Thomas Jefferson said it, I don't think it would be incriminating at all.''
<P>
Jefferson did say it. He wrote those words in a letter to William Stevens Smith on November 13, 1787. Jefferson was writing from Paris, where he was Minister Plenipotentiary at the time, but the words do not imply any premonition of impending revolution in France. They are used in justification of Shays's Rebellion in Massachusetts. In the letter to Smith, the words, ``It is its natural manure,'' appear after ``blood of patriots and tyrants.''
<P>
Jefferson did not have the French Revolution in mind when he wrote those words. But as soon as that revolution began he wrote about it in the ``tree of liberty'' spirit, and set virtually no limits to the amount of blood the French Revolutionaries might legitimately shed in the cause of liberty -- ``Rather than it should have failed, I would have seen half the earth desolated.'' So Jefferson wrote in January 1793 after the news of the September massacres in Paris had reached America.
<P>
The concept of the bloodthirsty tree of liberty entered into the rhetoric of the French Revolution itself and specifically into the rhetoric of the Revolutionary Terror. The terrorist Bertrand Barcre used a variant of it in the peroration of his speech calling for the execution of Louis XVI: ``The tree of liberty, as an ancient author remarks, flourishes when it is watered with the blood of all varieties of tyrants.'' Macaulay, whose knowledge of classical literature was prodigious, did not believe in the existence of Barcre's ``ancient author'': ``In the course of our own small reading among the Greek and Latin writers, we have not happened to fall in with trees of liberty and watering-pots full of blood, nor can we, such is our ignorance of classical ambiguity, even imagine an Attic or Roman orator employing imagery of that sort'' (Edinburgh Review, April 1844).
<P>
We know (as Macaulay probably did not) that Thomas Jefferson had ``employed imagery of that sort'' five years before Barcre did and in the same city. Could the idea have reached Barcre from Jefferson? Conceivably. Barcre could not have known of Jefferson's letter of five years before to an American correspondent. But Jefferson had been in Paris for the Fall of the Bastille, which was accompanied and followed by a number of bloody episodes. Jefferson's dispatches and letters of the period reflect a sober appreciation of the efficiency of mob violence in a revolutionary situation. ``The decapitation of de Launay worked powerfully thro' the night on the whole aristocratical party [so that they realized] the absolute necessity that the king should give up everything to the States [General].'' Some of Jefferson's acquaintances in Paris (who mostly belonged, like La Rochefoucauld and Condorcet, to the Enlightenment section of the nobility) may well have been shocked by the bloodshed, and have said so to Jefferson. If so, he could well have comforted them with some version of the thought about the tree of liberty and its natural manure. The story could then have gone the rounds and eventually reached the ears which were most likely to be attracted by the characteristics of that tree.
<P>
In any case, the bloodthirsty tree remains part of the revolutionary and terrorist traditions in the twentieth century. In ``The Rose Tree'' -- the most ``revolutionary'' of the four poems W. B. Yeats wrote about the Easter Rising of 1916 -- the last stanza runs:
<P>
<blockquote>
``But where can we draw water,''<BR>
Said Pearse to Connolly,<BR>
``When all the wells are parched away?<BR>
O plain as plain can be<BR>
There's nothing but our own red blood<BR>
Can make a right Rose Tree.''
</blockquote>
<P>
Yeats was probably not aware of the Jeffersonian origins of his metaphor. But I have heard the Jeffersonian passage about the tree correctly quoted, and properly attributed, by people who were interested in legitimizing the terror offensive of the Provisional IRA, which began in 1971, was suspended in 1994, and again resumed in February of this year.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+3>L</FONT>IBERALISM and terrorism appear as opposing concepts. But they have something in common. Both belong to the large and heterogeneous family of the devotees of freedom. Freedom is the most powerful and the most ambiguous of abstract ideas. There are two main divisions within the massive ambiguities. There is freedom combined with order and limited by law. This is the freedom of England's Glorious Revolution and of the American Constitution. This is the ``manly, moral, regulated liberty'' which Burke defended in Reflections on the Revolution in France. This is the freedom of the mainstream liberal tradition in the English-speaking world. And it is also the freedom of the mainstream conservative tradition in the same world. In their philosophy of freedom, the common ground between the two traditions is more important than the differences. Edmund Burke belongs to both those traditions, and no one should seek to wrest him from one of them in order to monopolize him for the other.

Outside the zone of ordered freedom, now more or less coextensive with the Western world, the idea of freedom and the love of freedom take starker and more elemental forms. Freedom is thought of as the appurtenance and rightful heritage of a particular group of people defined by nationality, religion, language, ancestry, or territorial affiliation, and usually by some combination of several of these elements. Some other group or groups of people are felt to be denying freedom to us, who must have it. Freedom so understood is one of the most powerful of human motivating forces and the most destructive, impelling large numbers of people to risk their lives for it and to take the lives of others, the enemies of freedom. Serbs and Croats cut one another's throats, and all for freedom's sake.
<P>
When the Communist system collapsed in Europe, many Westerners were confident that freedom would take its place, and so it did. But in many parts of the former Soviet Union, the freedom that emerged was not freedom as understood in the West, but rather a conflict of freedoms: national and ethnic freedoms, at war with one another. Russians are making a brave effort to establish an ordered version of freedom, but that version is challenged by other versions.
<P>
Much of the world today breathes what Edmund Burke called ``the wild gas'' of liberty. Burke used that phrase about the French Revolution in the condition it was in in 1790, a year after the Fall of the Bastille, and two years before the advent of the Terror. The Whigs -- the ancestors of modern liberals -- believed that the French Revolution was over, having brought about the triumph of liberty. Burke was about to break with the Whigs, over that proposition. He wrote in Reflections:
<P>
``When I see the spirit of liberty in action, I see a strong principle at work; and this, for a while, is all I can know of it. The wild gas, the fixed air is plainly broke loose; but we ought to suspend our judgment until the first effervescence is a little subdued, till the liquor is cleared and until we see something deeper than the agitation of a troubled and frothy surface. I must be tolerably sure before I venture publicly to congratulate men upon a blessing that they have really received one. I should therefore suspend my congratulations on the new liberty of France, until I was informed how it had been combined with government, with public force, with the discipline and obedience of armies, with the collection of an effective and well-distributed revenue; with morality and religion; with the solidity of property; with peace and order; with civil and social manners. All these (in their way) are good things too, and, without them, liberty is not a benefit in itself, and is not likely to continue long. The effect of liberty to individuals is, that they may do what they please. We ought to see what it will please them to do, before we risk congratulations, which may soon be turned into complaints.''
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+3>I</FONT> REFERRED just now to the contrast between ``ordered liberty'' in the West, and passionate versions of liberty in the world outside. The contrast is obvious, but it is not clear cut. Within the West also there are passionate absolutist libertarians claiming inspiration from within the Western tradition, as in the cases of the persons arrested for the Oklahoma City bombing. And Western liberals are ill-prepared to cope with terrorism. This is a question of psychology, not of formal liberal doctrine. In the British tradition that doctrine was formulated most authoritatively by John Stuart Mill in On Liberty. Mill wrote: ``The sole end for which mankind are warranted, individually or collectively, in interfering with the liberty of action of any of their number, is self-protection.'' The doctrine of ``self-protection'' would seem to authorize democratic societies to take such measures as may be necessary to defend the citizens against terrorist conspiracies, without defection from liberal principles. If the ordinary courts, and the ordinary criminal laws, are inadequate to protect the citizens from terrorism, then a liberal of the school of Mill could legislate, without a qualm of principle, for the introduction of internment without trial of persons whom the security authorities believe to be terrorists.
<P>
John Stuart Mill is the leading British liberal thinker. But a figure more representative of the British liberal tradition is the great liberal politician, William Ewart Gladstone. And Gladstone is the classic embodiment of the weakness of the English liberal mind in trying to cope with terrorism. Gladstone admitted that his whole attitude to Ireland was changed overnight by a single Irish terrorist act: the Fenian bombing of Clerkenwell Prison in 1867. That bomb convinced Gladstone that the Irish must be suffering from terrible grievances, which it was his duty to remove. ``My mission is to pacify Ireland,'' he declared. He tried to do this by a series of reforms, beginning with the disestablishment of the Irish (Anglican) Church in 1870.
<P>
The Irish terrorists were not interested in matters like Church disestablishment. But they were very interested in the effect which their Clerkenwell bomb had had on the mind of the leading British politician of the day. What Gladstone's reaction to that bomb taught them was that terrorism works. And that lesson is the most enduring legacy of Gladstonian liberalism. ``Violence is the only thing the British understand'' is the favorite maxim of Irish Republicans even today. Canary Wharf in 1996 is heir to Clerkenwell in 1867.
<P>
At the level of logic, the liberal mind is in the grip of a fallacy: that terrorism can be rooted out by concessions and compromise, without any need to resort to inconvenient and painful emergency measures, like internment. This is a fallacy, because the terrorist mind is absolutist and unappeasable. Irish terrorists want to destroy Northern Ireland, and will not voluntarily stop anywhere short of that. Arab terrorists want to destroy Israel, and will not voluntarily stop anywhere short of that. Both sets of terrorists are interested in concessions and efforts at compromise only as evidence that the bombings are moving the enemy in the right direction, however slowly.
<P>
Compromises are possible, of course, but only with terrorists who are willing to become ex-terrorists, like Michael Collins in the 1920s or Arafat now. But terrorism survived the compromises. In the current case, Israel surrendered territory to Arafat, hoping to get peace in exchange. But unreconstructed terrorists, ignoring Arafat, have been able to use the territory surrendered as a base for attacks on Israel.
<P>
To seek to end terrorism by compromise is a fallacy in logic, because it misrepresents the nature of the phenomenon with which it attempts to cope. But beneath the fallacy lies a powerful emotional force: guilt (exceptionally strong in Gladstone, for example). British Gladstonian liberals -- to be found today among both Tories and Labourites -- feel chronically guilty about Britain's past treatment of Ireland. Israeli doves -- the liberals of Israel -- feel guilty about Israel's treatment of Palestinian Arabs. In both cases, there are some reasons for guilt. Unfortunately, feelings of guilt are of no help in the struggle against terrorism. On the contrary, they are a resource which the terrorist knows he can exploit, and he does so with a savage satisfaction.
<P>
In some cases, but not in all, there are political initiatives that could isolate the terrorists, and perhaps eventually lead to their defeat. For Israel, peace with Syria is the best available option: to give back the Golan Heights, in exchange for which Syria would eliminate terrorism in Lebanon and dry up the sources of supply for terrorists in the Territories.
<P>
In Northern Ireland, unfortunately, no promising political option is within reach. There are two sets of private armies there, a Protestant one and a Catholic one. Efforts to appease one -- at present the Catholics -- do not appease it, and they risk arousing the latent violence of the other one. Efforts to make the realities of Northern Ireland conform to a Gladstonian agenda are doomed to failure. The best hope for Northern Ireland would be a co-ordination of security measures between London and Dublin, including the introduction of internment -- applied evenly to both sets of political-sectarian paramilitaries -- on both sides of the border. (Which worked during the Second World War and in 1957 - 1962.) At present British and Irish versions of liberalism (combining in Ireland with nationalism) inhibit that response. I fear that the necessary measures will not be taken until things get much worse. The IRA promises another 25 years of ``war.''
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+3>I</FONT>F THE terrorist threat increases in America, American liberals are likely to oppose any counter-measures which may be proposed against it. In doing so they will claim the sanction of Thomas Jefferson, whose protests against the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798 are part of the charter of American liberalism. But I don't think American liberalism is strong enough, in itself, to inhibit counter-measures against terrorism. What might inhibit them is something different but cognate: the dislike among millions of Americans for the restraints and constraints of ``ordered freedom'' and a taste for the absolute stuff, straight out of the bottle: the version of the Jeffersonian tradition offered by McVeigh and Nichols. Most of the five million members of the National Rifle Association no doubt repudiate terrorist acts. But most of them would oppose any serious clampdown on terrorists who happened to be white, Christian, and conservative. So liberals protesting against an anti-terrorist clampdown would have some unaccustomed allies. If American terrorism ever acquires sustained momentum, it could be more dangerous than is today's terrorism in the Middle East and the British Isles.
<P>
Let me close with a pair of disquieting statistics. I have seen it estimated that there are between thirty and forty thousand armed men in the militia movement who regard themselves as either at war or on the verge of war with the Federal Government. The total active membership of the IRA is reckoned as between two and three thousand.

Dear Rusty,
<P>
We're tops in the polls, the economy looks solid, Perot might run, and no one's stepped on a land mine yet in Bosnia. So why am I so down? 
<P>
I started feeling not-totally-up at yesterday's campaign-strategy meeting. We've been having these monthly meetings for a year now, and it was just me, Bill, Dick Morris, and HRC. And with HRC in Bosnia, I thought it would be a cozy threesome -- a time when Bill, Dick, and I could start some long-range thinking about the next 12 years, when the country transitions from a Bill Clinton operating system to an Al Gore operating system.
<P>
But now that polls have started showing us 23 points ahead of Bob Dole, the room was packed. There was George Stephanopoulos, Mandy Grunwald, Mack McClarty, Vernon Jordan, Leon Panetta, the entire White House Fellows program, Joe Klein (for some reason), and some people I've never seen before. A large man in a blue windbreaker sat against the wall, eating doughnuts out of a carton. I walked up to him. ``You're a Secret Service agent, right?'' 
<P>
``Wrong.'' He reached into his pocket and handed me a card. ``AFL-CIO, campaign division. You gots a problem with me, you gots a problem with my boys on K Street. So what's it gonna be?'' 
<P>
``This is supposed to be a closed meeting,'' I said, as politely as possible. 
<P>
``So close it,'' he said, shrugging. He jerked a thumb at Stephanopoulos. ``Kick pretty boy out. But me, I paid 35 mil for this seat and I ain't givin' it up. So if you'll excuse me, I'd like to get back to my cruller.'' 
<P>
This was too much. We had made such great strides in the past few months keeping the meetings organized and efficient. It seemed like our poll numbers were encouraging the staff to slip back into old bad habits. I ducked out into the hallway to wait for Bill.
<P>
As he strode up, I stopped him. ``Bill,'' I said, ``I've got some bad news.'' 
<P>
He went pale and bit his lower lip. ``Oh my Lord,'' he quavered. ``It's Hillary, isn't it? She's been killed in a Serb mortar attack? Oh what a fool I was to allow her to go!'' 
<P>
``Bill!'' I said. ``Hillary didn't get killed in a mortar attack.'' 
<P>
``A Greek terrorist suicide bus bomb?'' 
<P>
``No,'' I said. 
<P>
``What, then?'' he asked, sighing. 
<P>
``I just wanted to warn you that the meeting is packed. We're starting to lose our discipline again. We're getting too complacent. This meeting has so many people, it could go on forever.''
<P>
Bill smiled. ``I know,'' he said. ``Isn't it cool?'' 
<P>
The meeting itself went not much better. Actually the AFL-CIO guy wasn't a problem. He never made a sound, except for some paper rustling and napkin dabbing. He and Bill argued briefly over who touched the honey-glazed first, but other than that, he wasn't there. 
<P>
But Stephanopoulos must have asked nine times if the time wasn't right for Bill to resubmit his health-care program, now that his poll numbers are above 50 per cent. Dick patiently explained nine times that the reason Bill's poll numbers were above 50 per cent was because people had forgotten about his health-care program, which, frankly, I dispute, since many portions of it -- the mental-health task force in particular -- enjoyed widespread support. 
<P>
Finally, the subject came around to the budget.
<P>
``I'm concerned,'' I said, ``that the budget plan may end up hurting more than helping us.'' 
<P>
``How so?'' Dick asked. 
<P>
``Well,'' I said, ``I think the people are looking for leadership here, and I'm not sure that we're giving it to them.'' 
<P>
``We balance the budget in seven years, Mr. Vice President. What more do you want?'' 
<P>
``But we don't, really,'' I said. ``We don't make any real cuts for four years. All the cuts are made in the back three years.'' 
<P>
Bill chimed in. ``Al, with all due respect, those 'back three years' you're talking about -- hey, I plan to be in Cambridge, Massachusetts, as Dean of the Kennedy School, working on two things -- my memoirs as a two-termer, and some co-eds.'' 
<P>
``But I plan to be here, filling out my first term as your successor,'' I said. ``So why don't we take the long view, and spread the budget cuts evenly over the seven years?'' 
<P>
Bill looked out the window for a moment. He took a bite of his doughnut. ``You know,'' he said quietly, ``I'll bet George Bush said that same thing in this same room 12 years ago.'' 
<P>
And then he headed out of the meeting. So you can see why I'm depressed.

NEW YORK, MARCH 26
<P>
After months and months of negotiation, one American enterprise made a deal with the half-dozen most critical custodians of Soviet data. It would bring out 25 volumes, perhaps as many as 50, laying bare, so to speak, the minutes of the Communist era, 1917 - 1991. It wasn't the State Department that managed this, or the CIA, or the Library of Congress, let alone the National Endowment for the Humanities. It was Yale University Press. Jonathan Brent, its executive editor, made a deal that gave U.S. scholars the right to research and to publish the critical archives of the regime. Of the KGB, the military, the Presidium, the Central Committee, the foreign ministry. The terms? The Yale University Press is obliged to publish its volumes simultaneously in Russian, for distribution from Moscow.
<P>
Now this enterprise is a huge contribution to an understanding of the most important political phenomenon of the century, the rise and fall of the Communist international movement. The documents tell us not only about the workaday machinations of the largest totalitarian organization in history, but also about its actors. We have already from the Annals of Communism series a volume giving us the letters written by Stalin to Molotov, his most trusted subordinate -- arguably, his only trusted subordinate. They tell us things many of us more or less knew -- that Stalin was suspicious, ruthless, ironhanded -- but they do so with the finality of the holographic original. Labor problem out there? Stalin writes to his lieutenant, ``Definitely shoot two or three dozen wreckers from these apparaty [sic], including several dozen common cashiers.'' Volumes are scheduled, all of them edited under scrupulous scholarly supervision, that deal with the last days of the Romanovs. There will be volumes on Lenin's secret archive, the church, the people and the Bolsheviks, Soviet politics and repression, the diary of Georgi Dimitrov, the assassination of Sergei Kirov . . . ``What Saudi is to oil, these records are to twentieth-century history,'' Bruce Nelan wrote in Time magazine.
<P>
Now here is the problem. 
<P>
The parliamentary turmoil in Russia casts long shadows. The Russian Left has never liked the idea of disgorging all the secrets because they have the effect of eviscerating any trace of idealism in the Soviet experiment, at least in the hands of its generals. And the Russian Right doesn't like it because the firm hand of authoritarian government beckons to a society punchdrunk with liberalism and suffering now corruption, crime, inflation, and unemployment. The elections in June could very well result in a Communist victory. How long between such a development and a freeze of the agreement with Yale? It would not happen overnight, and there would be great pressure from the archival community within Russia to continue with the operation. The publications are of academic and historical interest to the United States. Their importance to Russia has to do with the country's future. And the volatility of the political situation justifies proceeding without delay. 
<P>
And the U.S. problem? Funds. The usual good soldiers have made contributions -- Olin, Smith Richardson, Bradley -- but, to date, less than $400,000 (out of $3 million needed) has been raised. The project is unique. If it were less than that we could say of it that it is ``the kind of thing'' the National Endowment for the Humanities was created to encourage. Why not? Why not the Ford Foundation? The Rockefeller Foundation? The MacArthur Fund?
<P>
The judgment of this observer is that we have here something on the order of a biblical narrative discrediting everything about the Soviet Union popularized by leftist fancy for two generations. The hero John Reed turns out to have been paid $1 million for his work as a Soviet agent. The labor-union movement was primarily an instrument of Soviet power. The independent ``progressive'' movements in the United States, France, Italy were Moscow operations. We have here a historical juggernaut capable of refashioning the trendy history in which so many American scholars were once ensnared; and they are not in the mood, many of them, to invite the coroner to certify to their naivete.
<P>
Imagine, just imagine the amount of money that would have flowed in if an early document had established that Alger Hiss was, through 1935 - 1945, a U.S. patriot, untempted by any ideological wind east of the New Deal. If such a document existed, the MacArthur types would have handed the Yale enterprise the keys to their treasuries. The National Endowment? You account for it. But if you have influence, use it to raise money for the Annals of Communism series of the Yale University Press, Executive Editor, Jonathan Brent, 302 Temple Street, New Haven, Connecticut 06520.

He came, he spent, he went. That is the Beltway wiseguy epitaph on the Steve Forbes campaign. But that shows you what wiseguys know. Mr. Forbes ran a campaign of good humor and principle, in the face of ruthless counterattacks from the Dole forces. Ultimately, he focused on a too-narrow range of issues. But his issues -- economic optimism and a populist approach to tax cuts -- will be essential to GOP victory in November. To make his case, he spent $25 million of his own money, which occasioned much hand-wringing. Another way to look at Forbes's campaign potlatch is that it costs that much to get neglected ideas through the fog of reporters' and politicians' indifference. (Pat Buchanan, the other high-profile outsider, profited from years of television and newspaper commentary.) A clever GOP establishment, having taken Mr. Forbes and Mr. Buchanan to the cleaners, would selectively steal their clothes.

Before the agony of last year's budget fight is fully over, along comes President Clinton's proposed 1997 budget. There's not much new: the same tepid tax cuts combined with lots of ``loophole closers''; the same bogus, unspecified spending cuts set to take effect sometime after Clinton has ended his second term; the same very real spending increases today (both spending and the deficit would go up in 1997). In short, the latest Clinton budget is as craven a political document as the eight ones that preceded it in the last 12 months. The first thing Republicans should do in response is: Get over it! It should be clear by now that Clinton isn't going to cut a deal, nor is he going to play straight with his numbers. So, there need be no more talk from Republicans of government shutdowns, of defaults, of CBO scoring, of saving Medicare, of balance in 2002. (We hope Newt Gingrich is kidding when he talks of making his troops vote on another massive balanced-budget plan this spring.) Instead, Republicans should put the remnants of the fight over 1996 spending behind them as quickly as possible, and declare victory: thanks to their series of tight continuing resolutions, the deficit will indeed decline steeply this year. Republicans should restrain 1997 spending with another tight CR (avoiding fights over budgetary details) and then change the subject. Any budget talk should focus on tax cuts to counteract the effects of the Clinton Crunch, and on widely popular proposals like the Balanced Budget Amendment. The President has gotten a free ride for a year because he has been the only one playing politics on the budget. Last year the Republicans couldn't beat him; now it's time to join him.

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde is used to fighting attempts from the Left to water down crime bills. But when the House recently took up anti-terrorism legislation, it was conservative freshman Bob Barr (R., Ga.) -- cheered on by the National Rifle Association -- who led an effort to gut the bill, over the opposition of the likes of liberal Brooklyn Democrat Charles Schumer. What accounts for the strange turnabout? Hyde got part of the answer in the House cloakroom when one GOP colleague told him: ``I trust Hamas more than my own government.'' After Waco and Ruby Ridge, a radical distrust of federal law enforcement, reminiscent of the New Left, has infected parts of the Right. There is ample reason to distrust centralized police power, and any abuse of it must be exposed and punished promptly, which famously did not occur with Ruby Ridge or Waco. But limitless distrust offends against both good sense and good politics. Rep. Barr worked successfully to strip from the anti-terrorism bill provisions that would have, among other things, allowed the expedited deportation of aliens linked to terrorism and permitted the Federal Government to designate foreign groups as terrorist and outlaw U.S. fund-raising for them. Idaho conservative Rep. Helen Chenoweth went further, co-sponsoring an amendment to scuttle habeas-corpus reforms long sought by Republicans, lest they be wielded against those ``wrongfully prosecuted for exercising their constitutional right to keep and bear arms.'' Needless to say, the Clinton Administration was overjoyed with the newly soft-on- crime GOP. And it will be treated to more of the same until some House Republicans learn the difference between Hamas and the FBI.

To those who have been hoping there will be significant cuts in corporate welfare once Senator Ethanol steps down as Majority Leader, meet Senator Bilge-Pump. Trent Lott (Miss.), Mr. Dole's likely successor and the son of a shipyard pipefitter, is leading the effort to ram a ten-year extension of federal maritime subsidies through Congress. Although benefits to the shippers would be lower than in the past, the bill would still provide some $100 million annually in direct payments and continue to grant exclusive rights to $500 million in government contracts. Al Gore's government-waste committee recommended killing the subsidies in 1993, as did the House Budget Committee in 1994. Even the Pentagon, which once maintained that national security required a robust maritime industry, has backed off, citing the successful use of its own fleet and foreign firms during the Gulf War. By championing corporate welfare, Senator Lott lends credence to liberals who claim Congress is interested in slashing only the personal variety of welfare, and gives cover to Buchananites, who insist that government should spare domestic manufacturers from foreign competition. Tow the ten-year extension out into the Gulf of Mexico, and open the sea-cocks.

Is the era of strong economic growth over? Washington's latest buzz says so. Downsizing and global competition are not transitory phenomena. Neither is an aging population, and no one saves any more. History and circumstance, say the new pessimists, make the rising economic tide of the 1950s and 1960s unattainable in the 1990s. ``It might be good for our politics if some candidate acknowledged this,'' says Bill Kristol. Good for politics, maybe, but bad for economics. We refer the depressed reader to Peter Brimelow's ``It's the Taxes, Stupid,'' in the February 12 Forbes. Our economic funk, says Brimelow, is self-inflicted, by a government that extracts too much from its citizens. The evidence? Gerald Scully's econometric study of the entire period since World War II. Economic growth falters, Scully found, when the sum of federal, state, and local taxation exceeds 22.9 per cent of GDP -- a level breached forty years ago. Had taxes remained at that level, today's GDP would be twice as high as it is -- $15 trillion instead of $7.5 trillion. A typical family would have $100,000 more personal wealth. The kicker: Government would raise more revenue at the lower tax rate. And Bill Kristol would be peddling his (uncharacteristic) pessimism at a deep discount.

Just days after breaking ranks with other cigarette makers on a class-action suit aimed at the tobacco industry, the Liggett company agreed to compensate Florida, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Mississippi, and West Virginia for smoking-related Medicaid spending. Other tobacco makers are undoubtedly thinking of following Liggett's example. Listen up, you tobacco executives: Government should reward you, not fine you. Consider the recent National Bureau of Economic Research study by W. Kip Vicusi. The medical costs attributable to smoking come to 55 cents per pack, according to Vicusi. But smokers defray most of that with the 53-cent-per-pack cigarette tax already in place. Extra sick-leave costs are negligible -- under 1 cent per pack -- while health-insurance premiums rise 14 cents for every pack smoked. Smoking-related fires add less than 2 cents per pack in social costs. On the other hand, because smokers die sooner, they spend less time in nursing homes, saving 23 cents per pack. They collect less in Social Security and private pensions, saving $1.19 a pack. On the other hand, smokers' premature deaths deprive the rest of us of taxes they would have paid had they lived out their full span -- about 40 cents per pack, in Vicusi's calculation. Net net, every pack consumed saves society 83 cents. That comes to $20 billion a year. So stay the course. And thank you for smoking.

Stephen Hale, the County Attorney of Wise County, Texas (north of Fort Worth), has tried a new approach to misdemeanor marijuana-possession cases: he dismisses them. ``As I see it, the possession of four ounces or less of marijuana is a victimless crime, and there's no point in tying up the system and ruining someone's life over it.'' Hale is up for re-election, and the local paper is unhappy with him. The real problem, though, isn't Hale, but lawmakers in Austin, and 49 other state capitals, and Washington, D.C., who don't see the issue with the same practicality and clarity.

IFTY years ago, on April 18, 1946, Jackie Robinson broke organized baseball's color barrier with a characteristic bang, homering and scoring four runs in his historic first game for the Brooklyn Dodgers' top farm team. This anniversary will no doubt unleash a wave of media meditations, since it combines the two national pastimes of the American male intellectual: denouncing racism and waxing nostalgic over the Brooklyn Dodgers. Spike Lee is preparing The Jackie Robinson Saga, and I'm sure Stephen Jay Gould will favor us with his thoughts.
<P>
Yet, beyond the obvious platitudes, baseball's long struggle over race can yield some surprising perspectives on our national predicament. The Robinson epic is generally lumped in with the 1954 Brown decision against segregated public schools and the 1964 Civil Rights Act outlawing job discrimination. Yet two crucial differences stand out. 1) The integration of organized baseball preceded the civil-rights revolution, and in reality baseball helped make later reforms politically feasible by giving white Americans black heroes with whom to identify. 2) Government had almost nothing to do with this triumph of the competitive market. Baseball owners finally realized that the more they cared about the color of people's money, the less they could afford to care about the color of their skin.
<P>
It's ironic that the hallowed civil-rights revolution owed so much to something as seemingly trivial as pro sports. Yet, without this business of producing heroes for public consumption, whites might never have cared enough about blacks to be bothered by racial injustice. It's not the most noble trait of human nature, but we tend to be more outraged by minor slights to winners (note the endlessly recounted tales of the indignities Robinson endured) than by mass atrocities against downtrodden losers.
<P>
That competitive markets make irrational bigotry expensive -- not impossible, but costly -- was first formally demonstrated in 1957 by University of Chicago economist Gary Becker (the 1992 Nobel Laureate), and in the four decades since has barely gained a toehold in conventional thinking. Let me be clear: this idea does not pollyannaishly presume that white people (or any other people) are motivated by disinterested good will. It merely assumes that if forced to by competition, people will hire whoever makes them the most money. Don't forget, though, that we humans are always conniving to exempt ourselves from competition. The more we can insulate ourselves from the open market, the more painlessly we can then discriminate for kin and countrymen and against people we don't like. Baseball's often ugly history shows this clearly.
<P>
Back in the 1880s, when the term ``organized baseball'' reflected ambition more than reality, the general anarchy let a few dozen blacks play in integrated leagues. By the turn of the century, however, blacks had been utterly banished. Although liberal demonology would assume that the owners were the villains, the prime agitators for segregation were, as economic theory would predict, the white ballplayers. Cap Anson was the best known of the many white athletes who threatened strikes or violence against black rivals. The banning of blacks came up for a vote only once, in 1887 in the International League. Following many nasty anti-black demonstrations by white players, the owners of the six all-white teams outvoted the owners of the four mixed teams. Elsewhere, blacks were driven out by ``gentlemen's agreements.''
<P>
Why did all the owners, although often after some resistance, ultimately give in to rabble-rousing white players? Easing the slide into segregation was organized baseball's curious status as a sort of Portuguese man-of-war of economic entities -- in some ways an industry of independent competitors, in others a single enterprise. Baseball teams must agree upon how they will compete, and, while they're at it, it's always tempting to agree upon how they won't compete. Congress ratified organized baseball's collusive tendency in 1920 by exempting it from the Sherman Antitrust Act.
<P>
The team owners' ill-named ``gentlemen's agreement'' to discriminate against blacks closely resembles today's unspoken understanding among the presidents of another government-sanctioned cartel, our elite colleges, that they will all discriminate against whites and Asians. Both clubowners and college presidents chose to head off ugly incidents by pre-emptively caving in to racial activists. They then browbeat all their peers into closing ranks, lest a lone dissident spotlight their spinelessness.
<P>
When all teams colluded against blacks, each team could assure itself that it was no worse off competitively than if all hired blacks. Cartels often collapse quickly because of cheating, but it was easier to enforce a national ban on black ballplayers than on, say, black factory workers. A ballclub couldn't hide its black workers away inside the mill, but would have had to flaunt them on the road before hostile, even murderous crowds.
JACKIE ROBINSON'S vast (and deserved) fame tends to make us assume that blacks and whites never played together before April 1946. In truth, as the supply of black baseball talent exploded after World War I, the demand for it could not be contained either. There were of course the Negro Leagues. By the 1940s they were booming, and their All Star game frequently outdrew the white version. More forgotten are the many venues outside the South where blacks and whites increasingly played together. 1) Collegiate athletics had been haphazardly integrated for decades. At UCLA, for example, Robinson starred in baseball, football, basketball, track, tennis, golf, and swimming. 2) The California winter baseball league was integrated, though not its individual teams. 3) In the Caribbean winter leagues, race meant even less. Many teams had black and white American stars playing in the same lineups, with few problems. 4) In the mid Forties, a Mexican mogul raided both the Negro and the Major Leagues to stock his summer Mexican League's integrated teams. (Among 18 big-leaguers heading south after the 1945 season was Dodger catcher Mickey Owen. Whether this increased competition for whites encouraged the Dodgers' owner, Branch Rickey, to plunder the Negro Leagues is unknown, but it certainly didn't hurt.) 5) Semipro ball, which was hugely popular before TV, was surprisingly integrated. For instance, in 1935, Bismarck, North Dakota, fielded an awesome team, half white, half black, lead by the fabled pitcher Satchel Paige. Soon, practically every town in the Dakotas boasted ``semipros'' lured from the Negro Leagues. 6) Barnstorming was the chaotic epitome of Disorganized Baseball, requiring only two teams willing to play and a crowd willing to pay. In many Midwestern villages, the annual athletic highlight was the arrival of a Negro Leagues squad to play the local semipros. 7) Each October the black Satchel Paige All Stars and the white Dizzy Dean All Stars barnstormed the nation together. (Predictably, the blacks won a sizable majority of these games.) During World War II, Paige could claim to be the highest-paid player in all of baseball.
<P>
In the liberal world-view, discrimination stems from prejudice, from ignorance of the actual talents of blacks. In organized baseball, the opposite was true. White Major Leaguers freely admitted that many blacks could have taken white players' jobs. Yet, somehow, this enlightened perception failed to make the white pros into ardent integrationists. Meanwhile, a number of owners and managers tried to cheat on their gentlemen's agreement. For example, many historians claim that the Washington Senators quietly broke the color barrier in the late 1930s by playing Cubans dark enough to have been banned as Negroes if they had spoken English.
<P>
There was strikingly little correlation between the rectitude of the man and his urge to integrate baseball. For example, among managers the most creative was the choleric John J. McGraw, a ferocious scrapper who won ten pennants. In 1901 he almost succeeded in smuggling a light-skinned black second baseman onto his team as a full-blooded Cherokee named ``Chief Tokohama.'' During World War II huckster Bill Veeck tried to buy the dreadful Philadelphia Phillies and stock them with Negro Leagues stars. Like all direct challenges, though, this was rebuffed by the autocratic Commissioner of Baseball, Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis. After the Chicago Black Sox threw the 1919 World Series, the owners had restored faith in the game by appointing Landis, who was famed for his strict moral standards -- one of which was Segregation Forever. After the good Judge went to his reward in late 1944, the owners, hoping to lighten up, picked as Commissioner the Southern politician A. B. ``Happy'' Chandler. When Happy surprisingly indicated that he wouldn't veto black players, Branch Rickey set his plans in motion.
<P>
``Mahatma'' Rickey was as renowned as Landis for his righteousness (as Rickey tirelessly reminded his players while chiseling down their salaries). No one should look down upon Rickey, however; pursue his self-interest he certainly did, but with infinitely more intelligence and courage than his rival owners. (Today's elite colleges, for example, have yet to produce their own Branch Rickey, a school president brave enough to dump affirmative action.) Rickey chose Robinson because they had so much in common: both were Methodists who didn't smoke, drink, or chase women, and both were smart enough to know the historic importance of their undertaking. Most importantly, both were too competitive to back down.
<P>
Further undermining the naive presumption that breaking the color line was an act of progressive piety was the key role played by Rickey's favorite field manager, the little ferret Leo Durocher. Bonding the Mahatma and Leo the Lip was a shared passion for victory and money. During spring training in 1947, Rickey scheduled a series between the Dodgers and Robinson's minor-league team. He hoped that when the Dodger players saw Robinson's talents, they would demand his promotion. Instead, fearing for their jobs or those of their friends, they said nothing. But when some Dodgers from Dixie actively protested against Robinson, Durocher deflated their mutiny: ``I don't care if the guy is yellow or black, or if he has stripes like a f --  --  --  zebra. I'm the manager of this team, and I say he plays. What's more, I say he can make us all rich. And if any of you can't use the money, I'll see that you are all traded.''
<P>
WHAT lessons can we learn from this tangled tale? A few simple ones seem to leap out. The more greed and lust for victory, the less discrimination. The more competition between teams and businesses, the more cooperation between the races. In contrast, the more collusion, centralization, community standards, and concern for the feelings of people you know, the more bias. If we now look at the remarkable impact that the first few dozen blacks had on Major League baseball, we can confirm the Chicago School's theory that competition tends to make irrational discrimination self-defeatingly expensive.
The 1946 World Series looked as if it would be only the first of many between the Boston Red Sox and the St. Louis Cardinals. Led by Ted Williams, the greatest hitter since Babe Ruth, the 1946 Red Sox had won an exceptional 104 games, losing only 50. The Cardinals, meanwhile, had averaged 104 wins per season during the four seasons that the young Stan Musial had anchored their lineup. Both leftfielders would long remain superlative hitters. As late as 1957 Musial led the National League (NL) with a batting average of .351, while Williams topped even that with .388, the highest average between the Roosevelt and Carter Administrations. Yet neither man ever returned to the World Series. Why not?
<P>
Largely because of St. Louis's and Boston's boneheaded bigotry. With Robinson apprenticing in the minors throughout the 1946 season, the Brooklyn Dodgers finished two games behind the Cards. In 1947, Rookie of the Year Robinson made the difference, as the Dodgers edged the Cards for the pennant. Jackie instantly became the league's biggest draw, with the Dodgers setting NL records for both home and away attendance. During each pre-season alone, Robinson earned his annual salary from the huge Southern crowds, black and white, that turned out to cheer and boo him at Dodger exhibitions. (By barnstorming through Dixie, Rickey was exposing Robinson to a real threat of assassination, as well as the insults of Jim Crow, but, hey, the money was too good to pass up.)
<P>
Rickey followed up his masterstroke by signing more Negro Leagues stars like Roy Campanella and Don Newcombe. During Robinson's ten-year tenure, Brooklyn's dividends for desegregating first were six NL titles, fueled by black Dodgers' winning five Most Valuable Player awards and four Rookie of the Year awards.
<P>
In contrast, St. Louis frittered away the heart of Musial's stupendous career by not obtaining a black regular until Curt Flood in 1958. The Cards paid a brutal price for discriminating. During the first four years they had Stan the Man (up through 1946), the Cards won almost 18 more games per year than the Dodgers. But during the Robinson era, the Cards fell to nearly 13 victories per year fewer than the Dodgers, a monumental swing of over 30 wins per 154-game season. The Cardinals stubbornly ignored blacks until Augie Busch bought the team in 1954. Fearing a black boycott of Budweiser, he immediately ordered his scouts to find black players, but by then the easy pickings were gone. Although too late for Musial, Busch's integration move finally paid off in the 1960s, as blacks like Flood, Lou Brock, and Bob Gibson became the core of great Cardinal teams.
As could be expected, the National League, which had been sorely trailing the American League (AL) in superstars since the days of Ty Cobb, more aggressively pursued black talent. By the mid Fifties all NL teams except the Cardinals and the hapless Phillies featured at least one black headed for the Hall of Fame. Between 1949 and 1962, blacks won 11 of the 14 NL MVP awards, while no black was the AL MVP until Yankee catcher Elston Howard in 1963. And the AL lacked an African-American superstar until Frank Robinson arrived via a 1966 trade and promptly showed the league what it had been missing by capturing the rare Triple Crown for batting.
<P>
Integration electrified the NL's style of play, as blacks showed that sluggers didn't have to be sloggers -- e.g., Willie Mays led the league four times in home runs and four times in stolen bases. The balance of power shifted away from the slow, complacent American League. The AL had won 12 of the 16 All Star games played in the Thirties and Forties, but could capture only 5 of the 24 held in the Fifties and Sixties. 
<P>
Where competition is not particularly intense, however, discrimination can linger. In the AL, the New York Yankees ruled, winning 29 of 44 pennants from 1921 to 1964. Not surprisingly, the Yankees saw little need to rush into integrating, especially after they signed Mickey Mantle, a white man even faster and stronger than the NL's black stars. With most of the AL not expecting to dethrone the Yankees (indeed, some forlorn AL franchises subsisted by routinely selling their top prospects to the Yankees), most other AL teams also lagged at integrating. 
<P>
The main exception was the Cleveland Indians. Under master promoter Bill Veeck, in 1948 the Tribe suddenly overtook the Red Sox as the Yankees' chief challenger. The Indians edged out the Red Sox for the pennant that year by a single game, a difference more than accounted for by their two blacks, outfielder Larry Doby and a 42-year-old rookie phenom named Paige. As the AL's most integrated team, from 1948 to 1956 the Tribe would average 94 wins, peaking with a 111 - 43 record in 1954, the best anywhere since 1906. In comparison, under the ownership of beloved philanthropist Tom Yawkey, the Red Sox would fade into mediocrity, wasting Williams's bat as they refused to play a black man until 1959. Still, to be fair, the Red Sox did take only seven more years to hire a black than the Braves -- the Osaka Braves, that is.
<P>
WHILE the complete integration of baseball through competition took longer than we would have liked, it's worth contrasting baseball's record to the civil-rights milestones dependent upon the Federal Government. For example, the vaunted 1954 Brown decision remained mostly a symbol until the Nixon Administration began broadly enforcing it 15 years later. Likewise, although the decline in job discrimination in the South in the 1960s is often attributed to the 1964 Civil Rights Act, little of the now vast array of bureaucratic and legal machinery for enforcing that law existed before the end of that decade. Far more beneficial during the 1960s than pestering private companies was federal intervention freeing up the Southern economy by cracking down on state-authorized discrimination, whether imposed by legislatures or by mobs winked at by local authorities. These gains became permanent under the most wholly successful civil-rights law, the 1965 Voting Rights Act. By finally establishing a competitive market for political power, this law rapidly made hatemongering unprofitable for Southern office-seekers. 
<P>
Today, conservatives tend to lionize the 1964 Civil Rights Act for embodying color-blindness. In denouncing quotas while supporting anti-discrimination laws, however, the Right shows a surprising faith in the ability of government bureaucrats and judges to decide case by case which private hiring decisions were tainted by bias. In reality, close study of possible instances of discrimination shows why the sainted 1964 act made quotas inevitable. Frequently, no outsider, and sometimes not even those involved, can know which of the many possible reasons for an employment decision was actually conclusive.
For example, the Yankees first employed black minor-leaguers in 1949 but didn't promote any to the big club until 1955. Was this long delay caused by discrimination? If you assume that any team in the early 1950s that didn't have a few blacks must have been discriminating, it appears obvious that the Yankees were guilty. But if you reject this kind of statistical or quota-based reasoning, how do you find the smoking gun? Did the Yankees trade away their top prospect, the black Puerto Rican Vic Power, for his uppitiness (when a Southern waitress once told him, ``I'm sorry, but we don't serve Negroes here,'' he blithely replied, ``That's OK, I don't eat them'')? Or were they sincere in claiming they'd lost faith in his potential? Or both? Presumably bias played a role, since Power turned out to be a good (though not great) Major Leaguer. But who can say for sure? Ballclubs constantly make honest mistakes about minor-leaguers (in the same period, the integrated Dodgers discarded another young black Puerto Rican, the great Roberto Clemente). Did the Yankees then force their other most promising black minor-leaguer, outfielder Elston Howard, to convert to catcher in order to delay his rise to the big leagues? Possibly, but this time the Yankees proved right, as Howard became an MVP behind the plate.
<P>
This ambiguity inherent in so many hiring decisions explains why aggressive anti-discrimination laws always end up impelling employers toward quotas. Unfortunately, racial quotas have numerous side effects. While the overall impact of reverse discrimination remains harshly controversial, we can safely say that year by year quotas' benefits to blacks diminish while quotas' costs to blacks rise. Since strong anti-bias laws make quotas inevitable and quotas are inexorably becoming a net harm to blacks, then logic would imply that we must eventually repeal enforcement of the Civil Rights Act's prohibitions against discrimination by competitive employers. 
<P>
How, then would we fight racism in hiring? I suggest: in roughly the same way as we now deter its cousin, nepotism. In noncompetitive organizations like government agencies, laws often ban nepotistic hiring. On the other hand, the government allows the market to police competitive firms. If a CEO promotes Junior and he turns out to be inept, well, the firm pays the price in lost profits.
<P>
Our country is probably several years away from even beginning to grasp this logic, but in the long run it may prove compelling. Conservatives, however, can't seize the rational high ground until they stop leaping to defend institutions they, especially, should be wary of -- e.g., unions, regulated monopolies, and government agencies -- against the threat of racial quotas. True, competition does restrain irrational discrimination. But where competition is lacking -- such as in government monopolies like police and fire departments, or in labor unions, which exist to negate competition -- then quotas can sometimes be necessary to put a price on discrimination.

NEW YORK, MARCH 12
<P>
Impatient right-minded reformers are whispering to themselves that the Gingrich GOP has run out of steam, and they are quite right about that. The big parade is stalled out there as people leave to look in on the primaries. Last week's action/inaction on regulatory reform was an attempt at a quick revival, but it didn't work. 
<P>
The idea was based on something that didn't happen about twenty years ago. The idea of it is ``sunset legislation.'' An example of the kind of thing Mr. Gingrich has had in mind inflames the memory. 
<P>
The story goes back to the early Fifties, when former President Herbert Hoover was asked by President Truman to recommend reforms that would retire useless government ventures. The Hoover Commission went to work and made a number of recommendations, but one of them sticks in the mind. During the Civil War, the British Navy quarantine threatened the import of hemp needed by the Union Army. So . . . something like a synthetic fiber was developed to make certain that the army should not run out. 
<P>
The Civil War ended in 1864. In 1951, Mr. Hoover's scouts discovered that the hemp factory was still operating in a little town in Massachusetts, never mind that hemp had been available on open markets for nearly ninety years. It employed about ninety hemp workers, and Mr. Hoover marked it down for execution. But Senator John F. Kennedy interceded: He did not wish any Massachusetts enterprise to be hurt. Mr. Hoover sent an emissary to Kennedy: How about agreeing that anyone who retired from work in the Civil War Massachusetts Emergency Hemp Factory should not be replaced? That way, the factory would die of old age in a little while. The answer from JFK: No. For all we know, they are still making hemp in Massachusetts, with a government subsidy, at twice the cost of the other stuff. 
<P>
About twenty years ago, the idea of sunset legislation had a very strong run. Its primary enthusiast was Senator Charles Percy, a Republican from Illinois. The idea was that every ten years, a given regulatory agency would report to Congress on what it was doing and how much it was spending. The Executive would then recommend changes in that agency's activity. Congress would ponder those recommended changes, and adopt them or not. If they were not adopted, the agency would -- expire, at the end of that congressional session. Assuming that every agency of government were reviewed and disapproved, in ten years there would be none left; no, not even the agency that had kept alive the hemp makers in Massachusetts. 
<P>
A version of that was sought by the Gingrich Contract, which borrowed the old sunset idea about existing regulations but put it on a seven-year cycle. A year ago, the House leadership sought a moratorium on new federal rules along with a demand that proposed new rules give an accounting estimate of how much they would cost, and how much they should effect. 
<P>
This year, under the kind of inertial pressure that the Clinton White House has become so effective in generating, the leadership retreated from the robust bill that would have included all regulatory agencies to something more modest, more tentative. Wearily, that was sent back to the drawing board, where a paler version is asked for. 
<P>
Mr. Gingrich's offensive is the great casualty of the Republican primary campaign, which has had a dissolute effect on Republican purpose. The call for a flat tax is bracing and interesting in itself. The call for protective tariffs, for some sort of intervention to guard against corporate downsizing -- all these have had the effect of diverting attention from a job that might well have been done without the primaries to absorb public interest and energy. 
<P>
It will all be fine for the GOP if the downsizing of the Contract with America has merely meant that the gestation of an effective political program is taking longer than envisioned. Reformers will not complain if, a year from now, President Dole signs one after another of the bills sent to him by a Republican Congress. Yes, if you had some ham we could have a ham sandwich, if I had some bread. 
<P>
The Republicans have a great deal to do to re-energize a Congress that so inspirited the country as recently as 14 months ago. A good beginning would be for Messrs. Buchanan and Forbes to call it a day.

<LI>Free-market fanatics, which emphatically includes us, are disturbed by Patrick J. Buchanan's heretical revival of the American tradition of tariffs. Of course, we have to admit that tariffs are just another form of tax. Arguably, they would result in no more misallocation than the enormous onslaught of taxation that has taken federal revenues from below 5 per cent of GDP under Calvin Coolidge to almost 20 per cent under Bill Clinton, without too much libertarian uproar. But meanwhile we have another question: Why has no one -- for example, his fans at the Cato Institute -- noticed that Steve Forbes is committing an even greater heresy against free-market writ? He is reviving another American policy tradition, that of the currency crank. He wants to abandon floating exchange rates (the prescription and lifetime achievement of Milton Friedman), fix the U.S. dollar against gold at a high rate, and resist any and all pressures to let the dollar depreciate (``trashing the dollar,'' in Forbes-speak). This, of course, would mean periodically closing down the economy to reduce imports and generate a dollar-bolstering current account-surplus -- the celebrated ``stop - go'' effect that crippled Britain in the 1960s. That's apparently OK with Mr. Forbes, who seems to view a ``strong dollar'' as an end in itself. But his ``strong dollar'' would also make American products more expensive in foreign markets -- and foreign products cheaper in American markets. Amazingly, Steve Forbes intends to subsidize imports and tax exports -- across the board. He's a protectionist too -- an inverted protectionist. Ed Crane, call your office.

<LI>ANNALS OF EXTREMISM. ``By forcefully raising the issue of economic vulnerability, Buchanan pushes the whole debate to the left. A month ago, the issues were budget balance and the flat tax. Today they are corporate greed and working-class wages. Thank you, Pat. . . . Now that Pat Buchanan has demonstrated that economic fears equal political pay dirt, we can expect Democrats . . . to begin speaking with a bolder voice. It's about time.'' -- Robert Kuttner, Boston Globe. Looks like ``flirting with socialism'' to us.

<LI>ANNALS OF EXTREMISM, CONT'D. ``Joseph A. Ditzhazy, chairman of the Colin Powell for President Committee in Michigan, . . . was fussing over logistics at [a book signing for My American Journey] in Detroit. Before taking up the cause of Powell, Ditzhazy had been chief of intelligence and counterintelligence for the Southeast Michigan Militia. . . . When I asked what was the connection between maneuvering in the woods out of fear that the government might go tyrannically haywire and campaigning for a lifelong Pentagon/Beltway insider, Ditzhazy praised Powell's 'integrity and moral courage' . . .'' -- Richard Brookhiser, in a piece on the Powell book tour in Forbes FYI. Powell never made it from author to candidate. But if he had, surely America would have been entitled to ask why militiamen were attracted to his campaign.

Anyone who thinks that the Democrats are really reconciled to the end of the era of big government should look at congressional Democratic proposals to address worker anxiety. Much of their agenda, outlined by House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, is standard Democratic fare: ``fair trade,'' more spending on education and training programs, health-insurance regulation, pressure on the Fed to ease up on inflation. But the centerpiece of Gephardt's proposal -- and of legislation sponsored by Sens. Daschle and Bingaman -- is financial incentives (tax breaks, government contracts, pension-fund investments) for ``corporate citizenship.'' Essentially, the Federal Government will bribe companies to operate little welfare states for their employees. Companies will be rewarded for not laying people off, for offering generous non-wage benefits, and for unionizing. This bold new idea is in fact corporatist socialism, a very old idea with roots in medieval guilds. Democrats offer these regressive proposals because their analyses of the economy's problems focus on huge bureaucratic corporations like AT&T. In fact, the health of small businesses and the number of new business start-ups are vastly more important than the health of a few mega-corporations. There is reason for concern about the economy: family incomes and wages have been stagnant in the Nineties, and, as Alan Reynolds points out, the seven ``fat years'' of the Reagan expansion have been followed by seven ``lean years'' under Bush and Clinton. But this anemic growth is largely the result of specific mistakes: e.g., tax and welfare policies that discourage people from seeking work. Americans' economic anxieties can be addressed by reversing those mistakes: by cutting taxes and regulations. House Majority Leader Dick Armey gave a fine speech along these lines the same day Rep. Gephardt spoke. We hope Sen. Dole -- and Mr. Buchanan -- were listening to the right speech.

On February 29, Federal District Court Judge Louis Oberdorfer threw out the suit brought by the Federal Election Commission against GOPAC. The FEC admitted that GOPAC gave no money to federal candidates, Newt Gingrich included. Still, it claimed that efforts to organize state and local GOP groups and to shape the national agenda were actually sneaky, unregistered attempts to affect federal elections. According to the FEC, any attempt to affect politics or issues at any level falls under the control of the FEC. Judge Oberdorfer said, No way. The get-Newt crowd spun into overdrive. David Bonior filed another ethics charge against Gingrich rehashing the FEC charge; the still-taxpayer-funded National Public Radio expressed dismay that the judge would let GOPAC beat the rap for ``secretly'' raising millions of dollars to engineer a Republican takeover of Congress. Next on NPR: Gingrich's New World Order?

NATIONAL REVIEW's call to reconsider a failed drug war has not exactly been embraced on the presidential hustings. That is no surprise -- politicians respond only to deep-seated shifts in opinion. But a gradual shift on the drug war continues: Richard E. Neville, a Chicago Criminal Court judge, became the latest law-enforcement figure to say: Enough is enough. High profits bring ``ten replacements'' for every drug offender imprisoned. ``No matter how many we put in jail, that isn't going to stop. . . . It's a revolving door that has continued for thirty years, and will continue until we change the policy.''

In Australia's elections -- a decisive defeat for Labor -- the main campaign issues were youth unemployment and immigrants on welfare. John Howard, the new conservative prime minister, campaigned on dismantling the system of lavish ``retraining'' and high minimum wages, which produces unemployment of 30 per cent among 16-to-21-year-olds. Howard also promised to extend from six months to two years the waiting period for immigrants to be eligible for welfare. But some of the biggest electoral upsets suggested that there's an even tougher-minded brand of conservatism in the outback. Labor's Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Robert Tickner, a loud champion of all kinds of superstitious native land claims, lost his seat in a 14 per cent swing. Graeme Campbell, a Labor MP expelled from the party for his attacks on multiculturalism, won re-election as an independent. And in the fastest-growing state, Queensland, another rebel won -- conservative Pauline Hanson, who stirred up the media by saying that campaigners for aboriginal land rights were ``only interested in money.'' Disowned by the frightened establishment, including Howard, as a ``racist,'' she lost her party support but won her race handsomely, also running as an independent. The Australian electorate wanted straight talk on taboo issues, and the more politically incorrect the better. Sound familiar?

Minister Louis Farrakhan made a One Man March through Africa and the Middle East, strewing bouquets everywhere he went. In Iran, he addressed crowds that were chanting, ``Death to America''; in Libya, he was promised a billion-dollar (sic) loan from Col. Qaddafi; in Iraq, he called UN sanctions ``mass murder'' and a ``crime against humanity''; in Nigeria, he compared Gen. Sani Abacha, the local tyrant, to Moses. He also visited the Sudan, where (black) slaves can be had for $15. Teach, brother! All of which led Eric Breindel of the New York Post to an interesting point. Pat Buchanan is supported by Larry Pratt of Gun Owners of America, who has shared podiums with racist kooks. Bill Clinton is supported by former Rep. Kweisi Mfume, who, as head of the Congressional Black Caucus, made a ``sacred covenant'' with Louis Farrakhan. Pratt, called on his behavior, denounced kookery. Mfume, not called on anything, maintains a profound silence. Pratt and Buchanan are Bad Men. Mfume and Clinton are -- what?

Before 1970, one member of a divorcing couple had to be shown to be at fault. After 1970, states began allowing divorce merely on the grounds of ``irreconcilable differences.'' Divorce rates shot up, and there arose the phenomenon of impoverished, mostly middle-aged women whose husbands had abandoned them for fresher prospects. In California, divorced women on average suffer a 73 per cent decline in standard of living. Their former husbands suffer more subtle woes. Lately, state legislators in Iowa, Michigan, Illinois, Idaho, Pennsylvania, and Georgia have been talking about reinstating the older criteria for granting divorces. But the lawmakers face an uphill battle. As Janet Daley has pointed out in the London Daily Telegraph, no-fault divorce arises from a common intellectual assumption: that social institutions should be judged according to whether they retard or advance ``personal liberation.'' By this standard, marriage becomes just a love affair which, when it ceases to satisfy one partner, may be dissolved. If it is to be at all meaningful, says Miss Daley, marriage must be more than that: ``a public act of commitment [to] the wider community: the extended family, future offspring, perhaps the Church, and society at large.'' What is needed is not just a legal counterrevolution but a philosophical one.

Americans are conducting the sixth presidential election campaign since the Supreme Court decreed a virtually unlimited ``right'' to abortion in Roe v. Wade and its companion case, Doe v. Bolton. Over the past 23 years, the abortion debate has been about abortion, of course; but it has also been a debate about the kind of society America is and seeks to be. Throughout our national history, few issues have so sharply focused attention on the fundamental purposes of the American democratic experiment. For, in the abortion debate, we are required to confront an urgent moral issue: Who is to be included in the community of the commonly protected?<BR>
The following statement of principle, endorsed by a broad spectrum of pro-life organizational leaders and scholars, is the result of consultations held over the past several months at the Ethics and Public Policy Center in Washington, D.C. The statement aims to clarify the principles on which the pro-life movement stands, to articulate a pro-life vision of the American future, and to suggest a set of political, legal, and cultural strategies that are capable of translating that vision into reality. The signatories, who join the statement as individuals, offer this statement to the public in the hope that it will raise the level of public discourse on this highly controversial issue, and thus strengthen American democracy. The signatories are deeply grateful to NATIONAL REVIEW for opening its pages to their ideas and concerns.

<FONT SIZE=+3>T</FONT>WENTY-THREE years after the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton decisions, the conscience of the American people remains deeply troubled by the practice of abortion on demand. Because of these two decisions, abortion is legal at any time of pregnancy, for virtually any reason, in every state. This constitutes an almost completely unrestricted private license to judge who will live and who will die.
<P>
That America has the most permissive abortion regime among the world's democracies is a betrayal of the American promise of justice for all. That is why a new sense of moral concern is stirring throughout our country in this election year. That is why millions of Americans have refused to accept the Court's 1992 admonition in Planned Parenthood v. Casey to stop debating the issue.
<P>
2. To those weary of this argument, it may seem that there is nothing more to be said on the matter of abortion. We disagree.
<P>
Survey research tells us that the American people do not want a legal regime of abortion on demand for any reason, at any time during a pregnancy. We believe we have an obligation to employ the arts of democratic persuasion to help reinstitute legal protection for all unborn children.
<P>
The extent of the abortion license and its reach into other areas of law and public policy is widely underestimated. We believe that, as citizens of the United States, we have the responsibility to discuss with our fellow citizens the facts of the abortion license and its impact on our common life.
<P>
Many women in crisis earnestly seek alternatives to abortion. We believe we ought to encourage those alternatives and help to provide them.
<P>
3. Pro-life service to women in crisis and pro-life advocacy on behalf of legal reform are expressions of our highest ideals as citizens of the United States. We affirm the nobility of the American democratic experiment in ordered liberty. We affirm the rule of law and the principle of equal protection under the law, even as we work to reform constitutional and statutory law so that the American legal system is, once again, congruent with the Founders' claim that the inalienable right to life is one of the great moral truths on which American democracy rests. We want an America that is open, hospitable, and caring -- a community of civic friendship in which neighbors reach out to assist neighbors in distress.
<P>
4. The abortion license has helped to erode the moral foundations of the American civic community. Right now we are not the country we ought to be. That is why our national conscience is troubled. That distress is, to us, a sign of moral vitality. We speak now because we seek to defend the America we love. We speak to promote the cause of an America in which women and men, together, rebuild the fabric of civil society by acknowledging our common responsibility to serve and protect the weakest and most vulnerable among us. We speak for a rebirth of freedom in these United States: a freedom that finds its fulfillment in goodness.
<P>
<H3>Victims of the License</H3>
<P>
5. Americans of every race, economic condition, religion, and political persuasion share a common concern today for what some have called a national ``virtue deficit.'' As a country, we have not paid sufficient attention to nurturing those habits of heart and mind that make democratic self-governance possible and that undergird what the Framers of the Constitution called ``civic virtue.'' We believe that the abortion license is a critical factor in America's virtue deficit.
<P>
6. Abortion kills 1.5 million innocent human beings in America every year. There is no longer any serious scientific dispute that the unborn child is a human creature who dies violently in the act of abortion. This brute fact is the root of our national distress over the abortion license. Abortion kills: few would now deny that. But in order to defend the private ``right'' to lethal violence that is the essence of abortion, proponents of the license frequently resort to euphemisms like ``products of conception'' and ``the termination of pregnancy.''
<P>
The public dialogue is not coarsened by depictions of the reality of abortion. But a coarsening of our common life has taken place; it is evident in the lack of moral revulsion that follows one newspaper's accurate description of an abortion procedure that ``breaks . . . apart'' the ``fetus'' before ``it'' is ``suctioned out of the uterus'' or ``extracted.'' 
<P>
7. The abortion license hurts women. Some (including the narrow Supreme Court majority in the 1992 Casey decision) contend that the license is necessary to ensure social and economic gains for women. It is ever more clear, though, that women pay a huge price for abortion. By providing an alleged technological ``fix'' for unintended pregnancy, the license has encouraged widespread male irresponsibility and predatory male sexual behavior. Abortion-on-demand has given an excuse to a man who shirks his responsibilities, claiming that the child he helped to conceive ought to have been aborted, or that the woman who declined to abort may not impose on him any responsibility for her ``lifestyle choice.''
<P>
Fathers have also been harmed and dehumanized by the abortion license. Some watch their children killed against their will; others learn to their distress only much later that a child they would have raised is dead. Even when agreeing to support the abortion decision, fathers, like mothers, suppress their grief, deny their protective instincts, and otherwise damage themselves when they allow the killing of their own children. Abortion contributes to the marginalization of fatherhood in America, which many agree is a primary cause of the alarming breakdown of American family life. 
<P>
The license has thus poisoned relationships between women and men, even as it has done serious harm to the thousands of women who now suffer from the effects of post-abortion grief. The women of America do not need abortion to be full participants in our society. To suggest otherwise is to demean women, to further distort relationships between women and men, and to aggravate the difficulties of re-creating in America a community of virtue and mutual responsibility.
<P>
<H3>The Public Dimension</H3>
<P>
8. Abortion is not simply a matter of private ``choice.'' Rather, the abortion license cuts to the heart of America's claim to being a law-governed democracy, in which equality before the law is a fundamental principle of justice.  The abortion license also threatens the cultural foundations of our democratic political community. For if it becomes a settled matter in American law and in American public morality that there is, in fact, a private ``right'' to use lethal violence to ``solve'' personal, family, or social problems, then the claim of American democracy to be an expression of the people's commitment to ``establish justice'' will be undermined, just as it was when the law claimed the ``right'' to exclude certain Americans from its full protection on the basis of race. Thus the abortion issue is the crucial civil-rights issue of our time.
<P>
9. A sweeping abortion license was defined unilaterally by the Supreme Court without recourse to the normal procedures of democratic debate and legislation. This in itself wounded American democracy. And the Court's persistent refusal to permit the American people to debate the basic issue of an alleged ``right to abortion'' in their legislatures continues to damage our democracy by alienating tens of millions of Americans from their institutions of government.
<P>
10. The Court's definition of a ``right to abortion'' -- first enunciated as a ``privacy right,'' then as a ``liberty right'' under the Fourteenth Amendment -- has had other damaging effects. The language of ``rights'' puts the dilemma of unwanted pregnancy into a legal-adversarial context, pitting mother against child, and even father against mother. But as the common experience of humanity -- and, increasingly, the findings of science -- demonstrates, what hurts one party in this most intimate of human relationships hurts both parties. The America we seek is an America in which both mother and child are the subjects of our concern and our community's protection. To abuse the language of ``rights'' in this matter further advances the demeaning practice of reducing all human relationships in America to matters of adversarial adjudication. This is a prescription for democratic decay. For democracy rests on the foundations of civil society, and in a truly civil society, relationships between people have a far richer moral texture than that suggested by adversarial procedure.
<P>
11. The Court's vain attempt to justify the abortion license in terms of an all-encompassing right of personal autonomy has begun to infect other areas of the law. Thus the ``autonomy'' logic of the Court's 1992 Casey decision is now invoked as a warrant for a constitutional ``right'' to euthanasia. And if it were followed to its conclusion, this logic would require us to consider such profound human relationships as the bond between husband and wife, or the bond between parents and children, to be nothing more than matters of contract, with the claims of the autonomous individual trumping all other claims. Enshrined by the Court to legalize abortion on demand, this autonomy logic threatens to give us an America in which the only actors of consequence are the individual and the state; no other community, including the community of husband and wife, or the community of parents and children, will have effective constitutional standing.
<P>
12. The Supreme Court's insistence on a ``right'' to abortion has had other disturbing effects on our public life. This ``right'' has been used to justify the abridgment of First Amendment free-speech rights, as when sidewalk counselors are threatened with legal penalties for proposing protection and care to women in crisis at the crucial moment of decision outside an abortion clinic. This ``right'' has been used by the Federal Government to coerce state governments into providing abortions, even when state legislatures or popular referenda have clearly registered the people's unwillingness to use public funds for elective abortions. The abortion ``right'' has distorted our national health-care debate, as well as the debate over welfare reform. It has even had an impact on U.S. foreign policy. American attempts to impose the ``right'' on the rest of the world at the 1994 Cairo world conference on population and the 1995 Beijing world conference on women have been deeply resented by other countries, as have U.S. attempts to promote abortion overseas through foreign aid.
<P>
13. The Court's attempt to define a ``right'' to abortion has polarized institutions and professions that were once among the bulwarks of American civil society. Professional associations of lawyers, academics, teachers, and civil servants have been divided by attempts to enlist their resources and prestige in support of abortion on demand, and in opposition to any effort to regulate abortion even in ways held constitutional by the Supreme Court. The medical profession has been deeply divided over its relationship to the abortion license. That the practice of abortion on demand is now widely recognized within the medical community as contradictory to the most deeply held values of the profession of healing is, we believe, a sign of hope. Yet some medical groups now threaten to reverse this trend by coercion -- for example, by requiring medical residency programs to teach and perform abortion techniques. There are also disturbing signs of the corrupting influence of the abortion license in other professions. History has been rewritten to provide specious justification for Roe v. Wade. The teaching of law has been similarly distorted, as have political theory and political science. Such extremism underlines the unavoidably public character of the abortion license. The abortion license has a perverse Midas quality -- it corrupts whatever it touches.
<P>
<H3>The Way Ahead</H3>
<P>
14. Our goal is simply stated: we seek an America in which every unborn child is protected in law and welcomed in life. Legal reform and cultural renewal must both take place if America is to experience a new birth of the freedom that is ordered to goodness. We have just described, in this statement, the nature, sources, and dimension of our concern. Now, as pro-life leaders and scholars, we want to propose a program of action which we believe will appeal to Americans with open minds and hearts on this issue.
<P>
15. Means are always available to enable women to overcome the burdens that can accompany pregnancy and child-rearing. There are always alternatives to abortion. The legacy of Roe v. Wade involves a massive denial of this truth and a deformation of social attitudes and practices so pervasive that women are actually encouraged to have abortions as the ``easier'' road to the goals that an unexpected pregnancy appears to threaten. As individuals and as a society, we bear a common responsibility to make sure that all women know that their own physical and spiritual resources, joined to those of a society that truly affirms and welcomes life, are sufficient to overcome whatever obstacles pregnancy and child-rearing may appear to present. Women instinctively know, and we should never deny, that this path will involve sacrifice. But this sacrifice must no longer remain a one-way street. In particular, men must also assume their proper share of the responsibilities that family life -- indeed, civilization itself -- requires.
<P>
16. The pro-life movement must redouble its efforts to provide alternatives to abortion for women in crisis. There are now over 3,000 pregnancy-care centers in the United States, providing medical, educational, financial, and spiritual assistance to women who, facing the dilemma of a crisis pregnancy, bravely choose to carry their unborn children to term. We support an expansion of this service to our neighbors, so that by the turn of the century what we believe to be true today has become unmistakably clear to every American woman: No one in the United States has to have an abortion.
<P>
17. The overwhelming majority of Americans believe that adoption is preferable to abortion. We must streamline and simplify the legal procedures involved in adoption, while providing effective support to those married couples who choose to adopt. 
<P>
18. The abortion license is inextricably bound up with the mores of the sexual revolution. Promotion of the pro-life cause also requires us to support and work with those who are seeking to re-establish the moral linkage between sexual expression and marriage, and between marriage and procreation. We believe that a renewal of American democracy as a virtuous society requires us to honor and promote an ethic of self-command and mutual responsibility, and to resist the siren song of the false ethic of unbridled self-expression. 
<P>
19. Service to women in crisis, the promotion of adoption, and the restoration of sound sexual morality are essential if we are to experience a national cultural renewal that will help to sustain legal reform of the abortion license. The way in which we pursue the latter is also crucial, both to cultural renewal and legal reform.
<P>
We pledge ourselves to exercise the arts of democratic persuasion in advancing our legal agenda. We urge Congress and the courts to reconsider their ill-advised restrictions on the rights of pro-life activists.
<P>
We unequivocally reject the use of violence in the pro-life cause as contrary to the central moral principles of our movement. For more than 23 years, we have worked within the democratic process to advance the protection of all innocent human life, and we will continue to do so. 
<P>
20. The unborn child in America today enjoys less legal protection than an endangered species of bird in a national forest. In this situation, we believe a broad-based legal and political strategy is essential. There are many steps to be taken on the road to an America in which every unborn child is protected in law and welcomed in life. Thus we find no contradiction between a rigorous adherence to our ultimate goal and the pursuit of reforms that advance us toward that goal. Legal reforms that fall short of our goal, but that help move us toward it, save lives and aid in the process of moral and cultural renewal. 
<P>
21. In its 1992 Casey decision, the Supreme Court agreed that the State of Pennsylvania could regulate the abortion industry in a number of ways. These regulations do not afford any direct legal protection to the unborn child. Yet experience has shown that such regulations -- genuine informed consent, waiting periods, parental notification -- reduce abortions in a locality, especially when coupled with positive efforts to promote alternatives to abortion and service to women in crisis. A national effort to enact Pennsylvania-type regulations in all fifty states would be a modest but important step toward the America we seek. 
<P>
22. Congress also has the opportunity to contribute to legal reform of the abortion license. A number of proposals are now being debated in the Congress, including bans on certain methods of abortion and restrictions on federal funding of abortions. We believe that Congress should adopt these measures and that the President should sign them into law. Any criminal sanctions considered in such legislation should fall upon abortionists, not upon women in crisis. We further urge the discussion of means by which Congress could recognize the unborn child as a human person entitled to the protection of the Constitution. 
<P>
23. The right to life of the unborn will not be secured until it is secure under the Constitution of the United States. As it did in Brown v. Board of Education (when it rejected the Plessy v. Ferguson doctrine of ``separate but equal'' as an adequate expression of rights secured under the Fourteenth Amendment), the Supreme Court could reject the ``central finding'' of Roe v. Wade, that abortion on demand is required by an unenumerated ``right to privacy'' protected in part by the Fourteenth Amendment. The claim that such a correction of error would damage the Court's authority is belied by the experience of Brown v. Board of Education, and by the fact that the Court has corrected its own erroneous interpretations of the Constitution on scores of other occasions.
<P>
A more enduring means of constitutional reform is a constitutional amendment both reversing the doctrines of Roe v. Wade and Casey, and establishing that the right to life protected by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments extends to the unborn child. Such an amendment would have to be ratified by three-fourths of the states: a requirement that underlines the importance of establishing a track record of progressive legal change on behalf of the unborn child at the state and local levels.
<P>
Even with a constitutional amendment, every path to the protection and welcome we seek for unborn children requires the re-empowerment of the people of the United States and their elected representatives to debate and resolve the specific statutory enactments that will govern the question of abortion. A constitutional amendment, in other words, is not a self-executing instrument that will end the debate on abortion. It will, rather, correct a gross misinterpretation of the Constitution (as was required to reverse the grievous errors of the Dred Scott decision) and require states to debate and adopt policies that do not violate the unborn child's right to life.
<P>
Such a process does not, we emphasize, amount to the determination of moral truth by majority rule. Rather, it requires conforming fundamental constitutional principle to a fundamental moral truth -- that abortion is the unwarranted taking of an innocent human life. Such a process also respects the role of representative government in fashioning policies that will ultimately secure that principle in practice. The project of constitutional reform on this issue, as on the precedent issues of slavery and segregation, is to bring our legal system into congruence with basic moral truths about the human person.
<P>
<H3>An Appeal to Our Neighbors</H3>
<P>
24. We believe the pro-life cause is an expression of the premise and promise of American democracy. The premise is that we are all created equal; the promise is that there is justice for all. For all the reasons cited above, the abortion license has done grave damage to America: it has killed tens of millions of unborn children, caused untold anguish to their mothers, and marginalized fathers in our society. The renewal of American democracy according to the highest ideals of the Founders requires us to stand for the inalienable right to life of the unborn, to stand with women in crisis, and to stand against the abortion license.
<P>
25. Few Americans celebrate the abortion license today. For many who are troubled by the license and its impact on our society, to be ``reluctantly pro-choice'' is now thought to be the responsible position. We respectfully urge those of our neighbors who hold that position to reconsider. We ask them to ponder the relationship between the abortion license and the crisis of family life in America. We ask them to reconsider whether radical autonomy is a sufficient understanding of freedom. We ask them to reflect, again, on the morality of abortion itself. We ask them to think about the social impact of a legally defined private ``right'' to lethal violence. 
<P>
We ask them to ask themselves: ``Is American society, today, more hospitable, caring, and responsible than it was before Roe v. Wade?'' We believe the answer is ``No.'' Problems that the proponents of abortion claimed the license would help alleviate -- such as childhood poverty, illegitimacy, and child abuse -- have in fact gotten worse, throughout every level of our society, since Roe v. Wade. Thus we respectfully ask our neighbors to consider the possibility of a connection -- cultural as well as legal -- between the virtue deficit in contemporary American life and the abortion license.
<P>
26. The pro-life movement is about affirmation. Thus we ask our neighbors, of whatever political persuasion or current conviction on the matter of abortion, to engage in a great national debate about the America we seek, and the relationship of the abortion license to that future. We ask all Americans to join with us in providing effective, compassionate service to women in crisis. Work on alternatives to abortion and on the reform of adoption laws and procedures can create the conditions for a new dialogue on the future of abortion law and practice in America. We are ready for that new conversation. We invite all our neighbors to join us.

Dear Rusty,
<P>
This is going to be a quick one. Little Al and I are conducting an experiment, and I can't take too much time from it.
<P>
We're watching television. We've been glued to the set since seven o'clock this morning, and we're going to try to watch until dinnertime. 
<P>It was Little Al's idea. ``Dad,'' he said, ``you talk a lot about all the bad stuff that's on TV, but I don't think I've ever seen anything bad on TV.'' 
<P>``You have an excellent point, son,'' I said. I haven't had much time to really sit in front of the set and ``vege'' out, as the kids say. Bill and I have been too busy leading the nation and supervising AmeriCorps. But after the White House Summit of leaders in the television industry, well, I knew I was a little bit behind. In the first place, I'm not really sure who the Friends are -- though I'm pretty sure I don't want Little Al to know either. But the minute it came up in the conference, Bill just lit up: ``Oh yeah -- love that show,'' he said, ``we ought to get Jennifer Aniston involved in this -- we ought to get her to come to the White House.''
<P>``Can do, Mr. President,'' said Bob Wright, the head of NBC. ``We'll get the whole dang cast of Friends and ER right here to salute you in the wisdom you have shown by not auctioning the remaining spectrum.''
<P>``Just Jennifer, okay?''
<P>``As you wish, sir,'' Wright said, ``and insofar as the spectrum auction is concerned -- ''
<P>Just then, Bob Iger, the head of ABC/Cap Cities, hustled over. ``Mr. President,'' he said, ``about this ratings idea -- is there some wiggle room here?'' 
<P>``I'm not sure I understand the question,'' Bill said. 
<P>``Well, now, take a show like NYPD Blue, okay? What I'm saying is, on that show -- which airs pretty darn late, nine or ten o'clock -- sometimes we'll show -- strictly in context, you understand -- how do I put this delicately?'' 
<P>``You show that fat guy's naked hindquarters.''
<P>``Yes, sir. Exactly. Okay, we're all on the same page here.''
<P>``And I think you shouldn't be allowed to show that. If you absolutely must, then you should rate the show 'adults only,' and the V-chip, which I proposed in my State of the Union message -- ''
<P>Iger looked taken aback. ``Gosh, sir,'' he said, ``I was about to ask if we'd be out of line to once in a while show the naked top half of a feisty young policewoman, but if you're dead set against -- ''
<P>``Let me finish,'' Bill said. The ``V-chip, and a set of ratings, should not be imposed without careful consideration.''
<P>``I've got an idea!'' Bob Iger exclaimed. ``What if the ratings were voluntary?'' 
<P>``I love it!'' Bill cried.
<P>Peter Lund, the head of CBS, pushed over. ``And the V-chip could be removable!'' he shouted. 
<P>``Or,'' Bill added thoughtfully, ``it could have an on-off switch hidden somewhere so your wife couldn't tell.'' 
<P>``Better,'' Lund said. 
<P>I was happy that the meetings were going so well. Bill and I are going to need the support of the television industry. They have a sacred duty to use the airwaves responsibly. In a way, they should treat the people's airwaves with the same care that we treat the people's money. I made a mental note to pass this analogy on to Bill for use on the campaign trail. 
<P>``So, what?'' I heard Bill say to Bob Iger as they headed to lunch. ``She'll be, like, in bed or something and then suddenly sit up or roll over?'' 
<P>``Or she could be in the shower, Mr. President, toweling off.''
<P>``Yeah, yeah, I see how that could be contextual.'' 
<P>``Totally. Totally contextual.''
<P>``And you could just kind of reach around and click off that V-chip -- ''
<P>``Just click it off, Mr. President,'' Iger agreed.
<P>``Could you make that V-chip go three ways? You know, on, off, and a setting where . . .''
<P>``Where if she dropped the towel . . . ?''
<P>``Yeah, exactly. Exactly.''
<P>``Mr. President, I see no reason why not. The era of big government is over. Let the era of big entertainment begin.''
<P>So here I am, channel surfing. And let me tell you, there are a lot of programs on in the middle of the day that are totally unfit for children. I caught Little Al watching a program that included the most shockingly explicit sexual descriptions. Granted, it was the opening arguments of the Paula Jones sexual harassment suit on Court TV, but -- in the middle of the day? I made Little Al switch to an old Western. A gunfight is easier to explain.
<P>
Your Pal,  Al

NEW YORK, FEBRUARY 23
<P>

The New Hampshire event throws light primarily on Pat Buchanan even though, at only a point or two ahead of Senator Dole, his victory was nominal. The exhilaration was there, bringing to mind that of Senator Eugene McCarthy in 1968 when even though he did not defeat the sitting President, he came close enough (at 42 per cent) to electrocute Lyndon Johnson. A few weeks later, Johnson announced that he would not run for re-election. What has the Buchanan vote in New Hampshire told his own party?
<P>
This is not instantly clear, because many of his positions are also held by other contestants. Steve Forbes is not the original flat-tax man, but he is the flat tax's primary champion -- Buchanan, with this or the other modification, agrees. On turning functions over to the states and, where possible, to individuals, Buchanan's position is also that of Lamar Alexander. Senator Dole took a strong stand against the degeneracy of Hollywood and so pleased the social conservatives, to whom Mr. Buchanan speaks eloquently. Buchanan is isolated from the others on two matters, one specific, the other general. He would repeal the two treaties that commit us to free trade, NAFTA and GATT. And he would adopt an isolationist foreign policy. The other three would not. 
<P>
And yet when Mr. Buchanan speaks of his candidacy he singles it out as entirely unique, a messianic episode. And there is a sense in which he is correct. These things are not up for arithmetical measurement. Suppose one reasonably predicted that on ten positions involving public issues, Buchanan and Alexander (or Dole) would vote the same way on eight. Does that make them in the long perspective indistinguishable?
<P>
The answer is, No. Because Buchanan is a figure whose persona overwhelms the political grid. In Houston in 1992 he declared that the United States was engaged in a war to the death between two cultures, the traditional and the countercultural. Many thought him correct (I do), but his tone was not that of Abraham Lincoln, but that of John Brown. The afflatus is historically distinguished and honored, and as often as not the prophet is martyred. He is seldom brought on, like Churchill, to act as leader. 
<P>
There is another question, a matter of public and moral psychology. There are those Americans (again, I include myself) who believe that the isolationist temptation, both politically and economically, is a temptation most fiercely to be avoided, since its implications can be lethal. Although I do not believe for one minute that, if he were President, Mr. Buchanan would actually rush to dismantle NATO (any more than I believe that if Dole were President he would immediately balance the budget), the fact is that Buchanan said exactly that. The go-it-alone insularity is reflected in his economic nostrum for demoralized American workingmen: Blame foreigners. Charge the Japanese 10 per cent on imports, the Chinese 20 per cent. 
<P>
The political conundrum looms, as such wise men as there are in Republican politics acknowledge one thing, namely that there would not be much point in nominating Pat Buchanan with the mission of dispossessing President Clinton, since that is inconceivable. Buchanan is a prophet, not a king. That being so, practical men will pause over how exactly to handle the phenomenon. The memory of George Wallace comes to mind. In 1968 his popular strength was critical: he more or less owned the South, and he had a large following among hardhats in the industrial Midwest. But the Democrats were moving sharply left just then and had no time for him or for conservative Democrats in general. He avenged himself by running as an independent candidate, securing 13.5 per cent of the vote, and ensuring the election of Richard Nixon. Wallace's followers voted Republican for the next twenty years.
<P>
The challenge is to detach from Buchanan that in his campaign which the Republican Party ought to concern itself with, and be grateful to him for giving it focus. Buchanan almost singlehandedly revitalized moral political sentiment on the matter of abortion. His call for a national acknowledgment of a common culture has as its symbol a vote against Bilingual America. His earnest suspicion of predatory government is repeated by other candidates, but they are toothless in their language by comparison. The sheer joy with which Buchanan takes his positions is -- a joy to hear. A long night with the master cheerleader. 
<P>
It will end in a few weeks, and then Republicans need to hope that the idealistic imperative of replacing Mr. Clinton will generate the necessary poultices, and mobilize the common will; which requires reorienting America in the general direction fought for by Pat Buchanan.

<P>

11-MARCH-1996
<HR><P>

<LI>``Anonymous'' has a new novel in the works about the Gramm campaign. Working title: Colorless Primary.
<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>

<LI>How's this for a bizarre twist: Phil Gramm is a Bob Dole supporter. The Gramm campaign -- predictably -- couldn't recover from the wound inflicted on it by Pat Buchanan in Louisiana. But in many ways it was self-inflicted. The foray into Louisiana -- fertile territory for New World Order-baiting Buchanan -- was misconceived from the start, a too-clever attempt to get a contrived bounce into Iowa, where, ironically, Gramm was doing just fine prior to his bayou debacle. There were other more fundamental problems with the campaign as well: its failure to court social conservatives vigorously or early enough; its myopic focus on ``ready cash'' (the campaign foolishly discounted Buchanan because he didn't have it); Gramm's unsympathetic public persona. But, all that said, Gramm looked like the candidate best suited to unite the rapidly parting economic and social wings of the conservative movement. The GOP had better find another, or Gramm won't be the only loser.
<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>

<LI>Dr. Jack Kevorkian was prevented from assisting in another suicide when police stopped him at the entrance to RNC headquarters.<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>

<LI>This year, as in past years, the Iowa caucuses were marked by appeals to the state's many religious conservatives. Sadly, they were also marked, as in past years, by dirty politicking among the same. In 1988, when Pat Robertson and Jack Kemp battled for those votes, slanders abounded that Kemp was gay, and that Robertson belonged to a Korean cult. This time, the victim was Steve Forbes, whose yacht was accused of harboring a Mapplethorpe (an accusation designed to allude to Malcolm Forbes Sr.'s late-blooming homosexuality). There is a Mapplethorpe in the Forbes yacht -- a seascape. A group which is itself the regular of malicious falsehoods should take care to honor the common decencies, to say nothing of the Ninth Commandment.<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>

<LI>Plans for that nationwide chain of Phil Gramm charm schools have been put on hold.<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>

<LI>Because establishment leaders have abandoned them on immigration, the American people have been in effect growing a new head. One sign of this: the high quality of private individuals speaking out on the issue. Thus the University of California at Davis's Professor Norman Matlof has single-handedly discredited the notion that Silicon Valley needs ``foreign geniuses'' [NR, ``Debugging Immigration,'' Oct. 9, 1995]. Now his expose of Chinese and Russian immigrants' massive dumping of elderly parents on the Supplementary Security Income program has been cited by the Heritage Foundation's Robert Rector in the first critical article on immigration to appear on the Wall Street Journal's editorial page for nearly three years. Devastatingly detailed and closely reasoned letters from Linda H. Thom, a Santa Barbara budget analyst, are an occupational hazard for unwary media immigration enthusiasts: Miss Thom has just shown that the U.S. census is systematically understating the impact of immigration by shifting the U.S. citizen children of immigrants into the totals for native-born families. And Barbara Coe, a principal architect of California's successful Proposition 187 denying illegal immigrants social services, is now running for the Republican nomination in the state's 67th assembly district. This is another reason immigration will be an issue in California's March 26 primary. Good luck to her -- and to all of us.<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>

<LI>After one year as New York's Governor, George Pataki is rapidly turning the Empire State into the privatization capital of the nation. Pataki's fast start owes much to the appointment of businessman and long-time privatization advocate, Ronald Lauder, as Chairman of New York's Privatization Council. The Administration has accepted Council recommendations to privatize Stewart Airport, the World Trade Center, the freight division of the Long Island Railroad, and a variety of state properties and services. Governor Pataki has also been appointed Chairman of the Privatization Task Force of the Republican Governors' Association. In February, both Pataki and Lauder testified  before Congress's Joint Economic Committee on eliminating federal barriers to privatization (by means other than victory in November).<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>

<LI>The era of progress continues. After toppling the previous regime, the victorious military junta in Niger, Africa, sent word of its coup to the country's diplomats abroad by fax.<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>

<LI>Maybe Lori Berenson was naive when she and the Tupak Amaru Revolutionary Movement co-signed the lease on a house in Lima, Peru, which police later found packed with weapons. Or maybe Miss Berenson, a 26-year-old Manhattanite sentenced to life imprisonment in Peru for aiding terrorists, really is as fierce a revolutionary as her madwoman-in-the-attic performance at a pre-sentencing press conference would suggest. Probably the truth lies somewhere in between, in which case it wasn't entirely fair of that secret Peruvian military court to make Miss Berenson spend the rest of her days in an Andean dungeon with no heat and no hot water. But ordinary Peruvians, sick of decades of revolutionary terror, don't feel too sorry for Miss Berenson. May her example serve as a warning for other idealistic norteamericanos eager to meddle in other people's politics.<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>

<LI>``Grover Cleveland was the only President to serve two non-consecutive terms. Bill Clinton is the only President serving two consecutive Presidencies in one term'' -- Paul Gigot in the Wall Street Journal. Hmmph. By our count, Mr. Clinton is up to six or eight Presidencies, or maybe twenty-three, and that's not counting Mrs. Clinton's Presidencies, which are reinvented every time she changes her hair.<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>

<LI>The commander of U.S. forces in South Korea, Gen. Gary Luck, cabled the Pentagon late last year warning that the threat of North Korean Scud missiles was growing and urging that he needed two batteries of the Army's new THAAD (Theater High-Altitude Area Defense) anti-missile launchers as soon as possible. Gen. John Shalikashvili, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, cabled him back a month later to say that delays in the Pentagon's overall theater-missile programs would postpone THAAD deployments until 2002 or 2003 at the earliest. Fortunately, the 1996 defense authorization act -- signed into law February 10 by President Clinton -- will force the Pentagon to cut through the red tape and deploy THAAD and other systems by 1999. Time for Shali to get cracking.<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>

<LI>Iran will hold elections for its majlis (parliament), and the Chief Justice, Mohammad Yazdi, gave a sermon on Teheran radio explaining the ground rules: ``It does not matter if [there] is a majority vote or a consensus. As long as the suffrage counters the will of God, it does not count.'' At last, a clue to the late Mayor Richard Daley's whereabouts in the hereafter.<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>

<LI>The Army Corps of Engineers, which valiantly defends the nation's wetlands, recently declared the drainage ditches along a highway in central Nebraska to be protected ``waters of the United States.'' The Nebraska Roads Department wanted to fill in the ditches as part of a road-widening project on the twenty-mile stretch of Route 30 between Cozad and Lexington. Before the project could proceed, the Corps demanded offsetting new wetland. To satisfy the Corps, the state Roads Department is buying 19 acres of prime alfalfa farmland at $2,000 an acre and spending more than $2 million to turn it into a bog. The 
Roads Department designed, and the Corps approved, an artificial wetland in the shape of a bison, the state's emblem. Though the Omaha World Herald figured out it's really bull.<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>

<LI>President Clinton, meanwhile, has approved a plan to turn hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of productive south-Florida farmland into the Everglades. Like, all we need down there is more alligators, huh? And of course at taxpayer expense. But wait: the land is currently used for growing cane sugar, and the screams you hear are from a handful of domestic growers getting stinking rich thanks to federal sugar-price controls at triple the world price that cheat American consumers out of billions of dollars. The answer is to remove price controls and open U.S. markets to foreign sugar. The farmland will thus lose its artificial premium value, and so be restored to the Everglades at a fraction of the cost. Consumers will save those billions. And the alligators can have any remaining sugar growers.<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<LI>The victory of ``actress-author'' Joan Collins in a contract dispute with Random House left earnest folk wondering what Miss Collins's famous editor, Joni Evans, could have been thinking. Random House said it shouldn't have to pay for Miss Collins's ``very primitive, very much off base . . . jumbled and disjointed'' novel, as Miss Evans put it sneeringly before a New York jury. Didn't Miss Evans know, when she first offered Miss Collins a multi-million-dollar advance, that actors, like First Ladies and billionaire-businessmen, rarely write their own books, and that when they do, the result tends to be incoherent, dull, or both? Of course Joni Evans knew. What she didn't know was that Joan Collins would fade from TV while the work was in progress, thus cutting into her marketability as a celebrity ``author.'' The jury was right to let Miss Collins keep her advance, bloated as it was by her publisher's greed. As for Joni Evans, she deserves to be confined to her office with nothing to read but Joan Collins novels until she admits that a deal, however dumb, is a deal.<p>

NEW Hampshire's first-in-the-nation primary seems designed to keep the GOP race going to the bitter end, and maybe beyond to a brokered convention. Pat Buchanan won with 27 per cent of the vote and must now be considered a serious candidate. Front-runner Bob Dole ran behind with 26 per cent, so narrow a margin as almost to amount to a tie vote. Senator Dole's failure to score higher is damaging, but hardly enough to justify predicting his defeat. And Lamar Alexander's third-place finish at 23 per cent was indeed better than expected. With Mr. Buchanan supported by the grass-roots, Mr. Dole by the party establishment, and Mr. Alexander by the media, there is a candidate for every taste. So why the gloom?
<P>
A British saying has it that ``the Tory Party never panics -- except in a crisis.'' In the last few weeks, the GOP establishment has outdone the Tories; it has panicked without the excuse of a crisis, and indeed in the face of a historic realignment. Pat Buchanan's strong showings in Louisiana, Iowa, and New Hampshire are treated as harbingers of the end of civilization. Grown politicians threaten not to support him in the (still unlikely) event of his nomination. And there is much dark muttering that the new voters supporting him are -- O Horror! -- not Republicans, but people voting Republican for the first time. (Buchanan Democrats?)
<P>
But things are not as bad as they would seem to those whose interest is limited to differences within the party. Mr. Buchanan's showings are a tribute to his skills as a campaigner, which everyone has long acknowledged. They reflect also the allure of his positions and highlight the narrow ideological turf the GOP has been defending since the Bush years and, yes, even since the Gingrich revolution.
<P>
Mr. Buchanan's issues come in three clusters: moral, cultural, and economic. These attract three broad constituencies. Mr. Buchanan has gathered his support by opposing abortion and gay rights, by affirming family values, and by criticizing a degraded popular culture.  On most of these issues he is at one with other conservative leaders, though he sometimes speaks in a distinctive voice. His opposition to racial and gender quotas and to unrestricted immigration gives him access to the more secular ``radical middle'' owned by Ross Perot. But his appeal to blue-collar voters anxious about their economic future takes him furthest from Republican -- and conservative -- orthodoxy. For here his appeal is frankly protectionist.
<P>
NATIONAL REVIEW has for many years urged the GOP to adopt many of the positions taken by Mr. Buchanan. It is a weakness of the Dole - Gingrich Congress that these issues have been either neglected (official English), or soft-pedaled (immigration, racial quotas). Red-meat issues have yielded to green eyeshades. And the GOP comes off looking like etiolated, bloodless bookkeepers.
<P>
But Mr. Buchanan's economic stance is troublesome. And it is an aspect not only of his economic position but also of his isolationism -- America v. the world. He has rightly identified a strong vein of worry about the economic future among middle-class, especially blue-collar, Americans. These worries are real. But Buchanan's protectionist remedy is flat-out wrong: American workers benefit from selling their goods in global markets, and American consumers benefit from buying goods without the taxation of tariffs. Above all, John O. McGinnis points out in this issue what free trade protects: the American people, against high levels of government regulation and taxation. 
<P>
But political disagreements, even fundamental ones, are the stuff of coalition politics every party must learn to live with. The GOP needs the votes of those attracted by Pat Buchanan in the primaries, and it is reassuring that he has promised to stay within the Republican party, the alternative being a nagging third party whose only accomplishment would be to keep the Democrats in power. There are, after all, many points on which the combatants can agree. Mr. Buchanan endorses a flat tax, his opponents have paid some deference to official English. Before the recent spate of negative ads, these men were all friends and occasional colleagues.
<P>
The anxieties that are appeased by calls for protectionism need to be dealt with. But that policy is uniquely divisive in GOP ranks. The incomes of both low-paid and highly skilled workers have suffered from indiscriminate immigration policies and the prospects of white male workers are plainly hurt by race and gender quotas. Here are issues on which economic conservatives can give Pat Buchanan and his supporters more than they could get from the synthetic and short-term relief of tariff barriers. And if such a compromise unites the GOP, it would also split the Democrats, capturing more blue-collar voters than the Republicans have seen since the Gipper's heyday.
<P>
High stakes. The GOP establishment should play to win big, not hoard its chips for fear of losing. And so should Pat Buchanan.

<FONT SIZE=+3>E</FONT>IGHTEEN months ago, ``The 100 Best Conservative Movies'' was a big hit with NR readers, inspiring an outpouring of their own film favorites. The following new list is drawn mainly from these suggestions with a few additions. Once again, many films come from the 1930s, '40s, and '50s. If you want to understand the meaning of ``Victorian virtues,'' in Gertrude Himmelfarb's phrase (as distinguished from ``modern values''), these movies are the place to start. Their creators often were children of the Victorian age. They grew up with convictions like faith, family, thrift, self-restraint, and patriotism, long before the ``de-moralization'' (Miss Himmelfarb again) of society and mass culture by material affluence, radical ideology, and cynical, corporate commercialism. But lately there are some hopeful signs of  a return to these virtues -- in films like Apollo 13, which celebrates American know-how, or the three new Jane Austen adaptations, which subtly endorse traditional manners and morals. So much for trends in film history. Now to Your 100 Best Conservative Movies.
<P>
Most Popular Conservative Movies Omitted from the Previous List: Patton (1970). This film makes a calculated appeal to anti-war liberals as well as to conservatives. But there's no doubt about George C. Scott's riveting portrayal of our greatest World War II army commander. It's a performance that sweeps away all those liberal theories that the way to fight a war is by controlled escalation or ``sending signals.''
<P>
Ben-Hur (1959). Oscars for Best Picture and Actor (Charlton Heston). The most revived of the 1950s biblical epics, giving a panoramic and realistic view of the cruel pre-Christian world. Long -- but not long enough for many NR readers.
<P>
The Sound of Music (1965). One of the best loved of all movies. President Reagan once apologized for not having read his official papers because the previous night this film had been shown on television. Best-Picture Oscar.
<P>
Best Modern Films about Individual Conscience and Courage: Walking Tall (1973). Based on the true story of Tennessee Sheriff Buford Pusser, powerfully played by Joe Don Baker, who routed local corruption while wielding a baseball bat. See also Lean on Me (1989), the story of conservative New Jersey school principal Joe Clark (played by the admirable Morgan Freeman) for the baseball bat as a symbol of sturdy American righteousness.
Rob Roy (1995). Scotsman fights for his home and property, from the Walter Scott novel. It is, however, marred by needlessly explicit sex and violence. Braveheart (1995), another Scottish patriotic tale, brilliantly directed by Mel Gibson, is also open to criticism for its unrestrained violence. But both are powerful morality tales about chivalry and courage in the face of ruthless adversaries. Incidentally, Tim Roth, the wonderfully wicked English courtier in Rob Roy, may be the long-awaited successor to Basil Rathbone as an all-purpose distinguished villain (see below, passim).
<P>
Notable Films about an Individual's Triumph over Adversity: Rocky (1976). Best Picture Oscar.
Interrupted Melody (1955). The story of opera star Marjorie Lawrence, felled by polio. Tour de force performance by Eleanor Parker (the Baroness in Sound of Music), the unsung greatest actress of the 1950s (e.g., in Caged, Detective Story, and The Man with the Golden Arm.)
<P>
Best Film about a Poor Family's Struggle to Succeed: The Southerner (1945). Sharecropper Zachary Scott's uncle collapses in the field and dies in his arms with the words, ``Grow your own crops.'' This beautifully directed film (French master Jean Renoir) dramatizes the faith, love, and determination that unite Scott's family against terrible adversity; their suffering and hard work lead to fulfillment.
<P>
Best Movies about Russia's War in Afghanistan: The Beast (1988). Superb drama of Red Army versus mujahedin.
<P>
Best Movie about Defeating Terrorism: The Final Option (1982). Stirring film about anti-nuclear Marxist terrorists who seize hostages in U.S. Embassy in London to block deployment of U.S. missiles in Britain. Britain's elite Special Air Services teaches them a thing or two. Also critical of bureaucrat appeasers, this is one of the noteworthy conservative films of the 1980s.
Delta Force (1986). Chuck Norris and his all-purpose motorcycle lead U.S. commandos into downtown Beirut to rescue American hostages. Lively adventure film.
More Great Movie Tributes to the Soldiers of Freedom: Twelve O'Clock High (1949). Outstanding drama about ``tough love'' Air Force commander who saves a wartime USAAF base from demoralization. Plus The Purple Heart (1945); Back to Bataan (1945) and Sands of Iwo Jima (1949), both with John Wayne; Battleground (1949); and Uncommon Valor (1983) among many more.
SPECIAL MENTION: Prisoner of War (1954). Ronald Reagan as intelligence officer who arranges his own capture by North Koreans so he can document their torture of U.S. POWs. Make that man President.
But Not All Soldiers Are in Uniform: In Casablanca (1942), directed by Michael Curtiz, Humphrey Bogart and Claude Rains join the Allies, Ingrid Bergman joins the Resistance, and ``As Time Goes By'' joins the unforgettables.
<P>
Best Movies about Dropping of the Atomic Bomb: The Beginning or the End (1947) and Above and Beyond (1953). Notable for contrast with ABC's vile documentary last July on the Enola Gay mission and other press attacks on this harsh but necessary feat of American arms. The first film, although marred by some propaganda claims, is important because it points out that the success of the $2-billion Manhattan Project was a triumph of free enterprise. Not only scientists, but ``men, women, builders, carpenters, electricians,'' not knowing their project, met the challenge by ``working, working, working.'' The film respects scientists who declined to work on the bomb, but, as the Enrico Fermi character comments, ``Sometimes it takes greater principles to stay than to go.''
Fighters for Good against Evil: The Magnificent Seven (1960), with its famous score by Elmer Bernstein.
<P>
Best Films Depicting Martial Valor: Zulu (1964) and Zulu Dawn (1979). If the battle of Rorke's Drift -- in which ninety Welsh soldiers beat off an attack by four thousand Zulu warriors -- had not happened, we would have dismissed it as a cartoon adventure. But a heroic episode gets a superb dramatization in Zulu (also an early Michael Caine movie).
Best Movies about the Evil of Our Enemies: The Hunt for Red October (1990). Russia plans first strike against U.S. Plus The Fourth Protocol (1987), about a KGB nuclear terrorist (although weakened by liberal ending).
The Charge of the Light Brigade (1936), directed by Michael Curtiz. This sweeping Errol Flynn epic has nothing to do with the facts of that disaster, but it has a scene that should be required viewing for all hostage negotiators. British commander of garrison besieged along the Northwest Frontier accepts treacherous enemy Surat Khan's pledge of safe passage, only to see all men, women, and children slaughtered.
<P>
Best Swashbucklers: Mention of the intrepid Mr. Flynn inevitably brings us to this thrilling genre. What makes swashbucklers conservative? They feature bold heroes who have no difficulty at all distinguishing right from wrong: no moral relativism for these fellows. Three of the best are:
Captain Blood (1935). Still the best pirate saga. Classic duel on the beach between Flynn and his rival, the inimitable Basil Rathbone, for the hand of Olivia de Havilland, to the stirring music of Erich Wolfgang Korngold. Directed by (who else?) Michael Curtiz.
Gunga Din (1939). Cary Grant and comrades in British India. (Hollywood did more for the British Empire than Cecil Rhodes.) Sam Jaffe is the courageous sepoy who perishes as he saves the battalion: ``You're a better man than I am, Gunga Din.'' A noteworthy point about imperial epics like Gunga Din and Drums (1938) is that anti-colonial rebels are not dismissed as savages, but allowed to state their case.
Thunder Road (1958). A swashbuckler is a flamboyant adventurer. That certainly describes Robert Mitchum in this cult classic about a slick-haired, independent hero running moonshine past ``Revenooers'' through the Smokey Mountains.
Happily, with the Reagan 1980s we saw a return to tradition with Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984), and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989), all directed by Steven Spielberg. Good, although slightly self-conscious, fun.
<P>
John Wayne's Oscar: True Grit (1969). Our aging, fat-bellied hero still has what it takes to dispatch Robert Duvall and a host of other villains as he fights for justice for a teenage girl (herself full of the right stuff).
Best John Wayne Character of Our Time: Clint Eastwood of course in, among other films, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly (1966), High Plains Drifter (1973), Pale Rider (1985), and the Dirty Harry series.
<P>
Best Adventure Film about Personal Redemption: The Four Feathers (1939). Branded a coward, young aristocrat redeems himself in the 1898 Sudan campaign. Perhaps  the best movie celebration of imperial heroics, it contains a superb conservative speech by the heroine explaining why duty must come before happiness.
<P>
Glorifying the American Family -- and Families Divided: Ah, Wilderness (1935). Lovely comedy of teenage growing pains in turn-of-the-century New England (from the play by, curiously, Eugene O'Neill). Affectionately directed by Clarence Brown. Funniest scene: the high-school graduation.
The Fighting Sullivans (1944). Story of five brothers who all went down for their country with the U.S.S. Juneau in the Solomon Islands in November 1942. Most of the film depicts their childhood and is a case study in classic family virtues.
Life with Father (1947). Mary Gaydos of New York loves William Powell (playing Clarence Day), writing: ``Perhaps you have something against red-headed, heterosexual, capitalist, Eurocentrist men. Me, I love them.'' Directed (again) by the great Michael Curtiz.
Love Finds Andy Hardy (1938). One of the vastly popular series about the growing pains of young Mickey Rooney, who learns some truths at the knee of father Lewis Stone.
Of Human Hearts (1938). Young James Stewart becomes an army surgeon in the Civil War thanks to the sacrifices of his mother; but he ignores her, and for his ingratitude receives a lecture on a son's duties from no less than President Lincoln himself. Yes, it sounds corny, but this is a moving film, directed by Clarence Brown. John Carradine's Lincoln is by far the most credible performance in this impossible part.
Home from the Hill (1959). A divided Texas family, and the hurt endured by an illegitimate son whose father won't accept him. This film has the most restrained murder scene in movie history -- we see no killer, no weapon, and no blood, but the artistry of director Vincente Minnelli (he made more than just the best musicals like Gigi) conveys all the horror and pathos of the crime. Is such artistry of restraint beyond the abilities of today's filmmakers? Robert Mitchum's best movie.
<P>
Best Scene Dramatizing the Sanctity of Innocent Life: Rob Roy (see above). Our hero's wife is raped by his enemy, but Rob Roy embraces the child she conceives as an innocent life that must be brought into the world.
<P>
Best Movies about Children Learning Virtue: Captains Courageous (1937). Rich brat falls off transatlantic liner and is rescued by fishing trawler. Under the tutelage of a simple, devout Portuguese fisherman, he learns to be a man. Spencer Tracy as Manuel amply earned his first Oscar for the role that made him a major star. Based on the novel by Rudyard Kipling, and directed by Victor Fleming, this is one of the outstanding films of Hollywood's Golden Age.
Boys Town (1938). Tracy retained the Oscar as Father Flanagan, who founded an orphanage for ``wayward'' boys: volunteerism over bureaucracy. The film reflects traditional liberal reformism in its stress on improving a child's environment -- although conservative suggestions nowadays on removing neglected children to better surroundings receive liberals' scorn. Perhaps liberals worry this new environment would include religious teaching and discipline, as in the film, rather than ``self-esteem.''
<P>
More Classics about Religious Faith: Faith is not, of course, a matter of being conservative or liberal, but the treatment of religious themes in earlier movies reflected a society that was less secular -- and thus healthier -- than our own.
The Fugitive (1947). ``Whisky priest'' in Mexico on the run from anti-clerical government. As in Graham Greene's novel, the flawed vessel of Christianity offers more real hope for the people than the this-worldly salvation of the socialist state. Reportedly the personal favorite of director John Ford.
A Man Called Peter (1955). Biography of the Scotsman who became a minister and chaplain to the U.S. Senate. 
The Keys of the Kingdom (1944). A missionary in China.
<P>
Best Conservative Romantic Movie: Camille (1937). This classic story of a beautiful, consumptive Parisian courtesan, who forsakes her life of riches and pleasure for the love of an earnest young diplomat, is conservative in 1996 because it is a story about responsibility and sacrifice. It also features Greta Garbo in the screen's most moving performance.
<P>
The film, directed with rich detail and nuanced understatement by George Cukor, contrasts Garbo's hedonistic life with an almost sacred depiction of marriage, family, and religious ritual. When Garbo cynically dismisses her friend Nichette's plan to marry a penniless young lawyer (they once existed), Nichette entreats her: ``It's ideal to love and to marry the one you love.'' Their later wedding scene in the country (the priest reciting the Latin service) briefly but movingly conveys the holiness of the marriage sacrament. In another brief but telling scene, Cukor depicts the devout familial bonds of Robert Taylor's (Garbo's diplomat suitor) family, and particularly the respect of son for father (Lionel Barrymore).
<P>
The peak of Garbo's performance is the renunciation scene, when Barrymore pleads with her to end her country idyll with his son, who will be ruined if it goes on. Barrymore had come in anger and reproach. Love cannot last, he says, ``unsanctified by marriage, unblessed by children or social ties.'' But -- such is the spirituality and force of Garbo's performance -- he departs with humility, gratitude, and admiration when she accedes to his pleas.
<P>
Also noteworthy from today's perspective is the eroticism conveyed by the film's understatement. In a famous scene at one of Garbo's Paris parties, Taylor has followed her into her boudoir, where he urges that she send her friends away. She agrees, but he must leave first to keep the others off guard. As he kneels before her, she leans over and kisses him all over his face -- restrained by the Production Code, but white hot with passion. Such restraint also raises the dueling scene between Taylor and Garbo's aristocrat paramour (Henry Daniell) to classic status: the camera is on Garbo as she hurries out of her carriage, running to stop it. No gore, only the sound of the pistols firing, but deeply dramatic.
<P>
Camille's lavish production, the hallmark of MGM (e.g., The Wizard of Oz), reflects the sensibility of a more refined, civilized time. It is evident how much the studio strove for perfection: sets, costumes, Garbo's hair styles, editing, and music (one of the few successful examples of classical music as a score, arranged with keen dramatic sense by Herbert Stothart) underline the writing and acting to make a profound emotional experience.
<P>
HONORABLE MENTION: Sense and Sensibility (1995) for its depiction, as in Camille, of romantic love, and for its realization of the ideals of visual beauty and noble character. This is the best translation to film among the recent crop of Jane Austen adaptations; but both Persuasion and the made-for-TV Pride and Prejudice are fine pictures -- well acted, beautifully photographed, and scrupulously attentive to period detail and atmosphere. More to the point here, they embody a classical morality of self-restraint, civility, and good manners -- but also the injunction not to be deceived by outward appearances.
<P>
Best Soap-Opera Movie about Accepting Responsibility: My Reputation (1946). Barbara Stanwyck could have received an Oscar for this performance as a young widow with two boys. After extended mourning, she is about to accompany an officer friend to New York, only to recognize that her duty lies with her children. Her mother advises, ``Young people hate convention. But as they grow older they learn conventions meet a need.'' When she bids her friend goodbye at the train station, he says, ``You have to take responsibility. You wouldn't be you if you didn't.''
<P>
Ronald Reagan's Most Charming Movie: The Voice of the Turtle a/k/a One for the Book (1947). Sgt. Reagan on wartime leave in New York is stood up by superficial Eve Arden and falls for winsome young Eleanor Parker, a fellow-unsophisticate. In a movie glowing with gossamer charm, they dance to ``Danny Boy,'' have milk and cookies -- and he sleeps on the couch. One of the many 1940s films that paint New York as a wonderfully civilized city, and NR's favorite Reagan movie.
<P>
Best Scene Illustrating pre - Great Society View of Welfare: In Love on the Run (1936), Joan Crawford flees her London socialite wedding and is spirited off to France by Clark Gable. When she learns Gable is a reporter who has been secretly filing stories with his New York paper, she sends him packing, and he's fired. The following dialogue ensues between Miss Crawford and Gable's rival (Franchot Tone):
Tone: ``He's blacklisted. Through.''<BR>
Crawford: ``Can he do anything else?''<BR>
Tone: ``Nothing that won't land him in jail.''<BR>
Crawford: ``I suppose he'll get on relief.''<BR>
Tone: ``He might for a few days, but that's all. They're fussy about who gets on relief.''<BR>
<P>
Best Movie Dramatizing pre - Great Society View of Penology: The Big House (1930). Still among the best prison dramas. The inmates here have no radio and no weights. They wear grim flannel uniforms, are marched into the mess hall, and, when the guard's whistle blows, eat their gruel in silence. If they get out of line (which doesn't take much), they are deposited in the ``dungeon,'' where they stew alone for thirty days on bread and water. And when they riot and take guards hostage, Warden Lewis Stone answers their demand for freedom: ``I'll see 'em in Hell first. Let 'em have it.'' Whereupon his machine guns open up and the tanks crash through the inmates' barricade. Or was the lower crime-rate in those Depression days just a coincidence?
<P>
Best Movies about Capital Punishment: Angels with Dirty Faces (1938). Murderer James Cagney agrees to the request of Father Pat O'Brien to feign fear as he heads to the electric chair in order to give a moral lesson in the wages of sin to the Bowery Boys. Another Michael Curtiz winner, and a welcome contrast to amoral blood baths like Bonnie and Clyde and The Godfather.
Just Cause (1995). Liberal law professor saves victim of police brutality from Death Row -- only to find he really is a vicious murderer. In today's Hollywood, this is a surprise.
Best Movie about Government Economic Controls: A Private Function (1985). Confronted with British Labor government's rationing, three local worthies fatten up an illegal pig. The vet's socially ambitious wife discovers the plot, and a British class-war comedy breaks out. All Creatures Great and Small laced with arsenic.
<P>
The Editor's Favorite Satire on Modern Manners: Serial (1979). Hilarious send-up of ``liberated'' Northern California customs from granola to marriage (``I declare thee to be pair-bonded for so long as you find it mutually enriching''), drawn from Cyra MacFadden's martini-dry satire. Brilliant off-beat casting includes Christopher ``Dracula'' Lee as leader of gay San Francisco bikers.
Four More Conservative Comedies: Being There (1979). The always brilliant Peter Sellers as an obscure, hermit-like gardener who finds himself the darling of Washington's power elite and a media sage. Is ``being there,'' rather than knowing anything, a secret to Washington success? Sellers does dispense two bits of wisdom: Let the economy grow on its own like a garden (though it's not clear the film takes a positive view of this advice) and -- horrors -- he doesn't read the New York Times or Washington Post!
Sullivan's Travels (1942). Joel McCrea as Hollywood comedy director (Ants in the Pants of 1933) who wants to make socially significant films (Brother, Where Art Thou?) but accidentally lands in a Southern prison where he learns that the oppressed masses would rather laugh than be uplifted. This comedy has an unexpectedly moving scene that has probably done more to undermine racism than anything out of Washington -- a black preacher urges his dirt-poor congregation not to shun the prisoners when they arrive shackled for Sunday service; they are God's children too. Written and directed by Preston Sturges. Mr. McCrea, incidentally, was the staunchest of Hollywood conservatives.
Brother Orchid (1940). Edward G. Robinson as hood who takes refuge as a monk in a monastery. At first he tries to work the monastic system to his own advantage, but he soon learns the real truths of life from the other monks.
Harry's War (1981). Postman battles IRS.
<P>
Best Tax-Revolt Movie: The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938). Rush Limbaugh once noted that Robin Hood is actually the story of taking from the government and giving to the poor and middle class. Here Errol Flynn is the definitive Robin in another great triumph of Hollywood's Golden Age, directed by (you guessed it!) Michael Curtiz, with William Keighley. We first encounter Flynn galloping his horse as the camera cuts to a close-up of his confident, smiling face. This heroic romanticism characterizes the entire film, from the early Technicolor verdant greens and shimmering light that evoke Sherwood Forest as Arcadia, to the balcony scene between Flynn and Olivia de Havilland (Maid Marian), accompanied by a gorgeous love theme from Erich Wolfgang Korngold's Richard Strauss - Puccini-like score. Supply-siders will love the ambush of the villains in Sherwood and even Keynesians will relish the duel (photographed in silhouette against monumental castle walls) between Flynn and Basil Rathbone. Run through, Rathbone plunges into the moat, and Flynn leaps down a stairway to the dungeon into Miss de Havilland's loving arms, all to triumphant Korngold fanfares.
<P>
Finest Unsung Anti-Communist Movie: Hollywood's political transformation in the 1960s sent a large batch of anti-Communist movies down the memory hole. The Red Danube (1949) is the best of them -- a striking drama about forced repatriation of Russians in postwar Vienna. The conflict is one of Christianity against Communism. A decent, atheist British officer (Walter Pidgeon) thinks it his duty to return to the Russian sector a young ballerina (the lovely Janet Leigh) who has been given sanctuary in a convent. After a series of debates with the Mother Superior (Ethel Barrymore) and the suicide of the ballerina, he eventually understands how faith helps one recognize evil (``This is what men do to other men when they don't believe in God''). Excellent script and cast, including the young Angela Lansbury as Pidgeon's service driver. Occasionally seen late at night on TNT -- but, then, so is the absurdly pro-Stalinist Mission to Moscow.
<P>
More Anti-Communist Movies: The Conspirator (1949) features the gorgeous 17-year-old Elizabeth Taylor as wife of British officer and Red spy. Her shock and disgust on learning of his treason, as if he had the plague, is a valuable reminder of the early resolute Cold War spirit.
<P>
Of course, the greatest anti-Communist movie is, improbably, a comedy: Ninotchka (1939), directed by Ernst Lubitsch, written by Charles Brackett and Billy Wilder, starring Garbo and Melvyn Douglas. This appeared in the first list of best conservative films, but it must be mentioned again because, underneath the jokes, it is a powerful defense of humane values against totalitarian ``virtue.''
Example: ``How are things in Moscow?''
``Very good. The last mass trials were a great success. There are going to be fewer but better Russians.''
<P>
Also be sure to see Pickup on South Street (1953), directed by Samuel Fuller; The Woman on Pier 13 a/k/a I Married a Communist (1949); The Prisoner (1955); The Seduction of Mimi (Italy, 1974); Night People (1954); High Treason (1952); Guilty of Treason (1950), about the Cardinal Mindszenty case; and the recent Burned by the Sun (1995).
<P>
Another Classic about the Inhumanity of Mass Revolution: The Scarlet Pimpernel (1935). Cross out ``Bolsheviks,'' insert ``Jacobins'' -- and send in languid aristocrat Leslie Howard to rescue the victims and wife Merle Oberon from Robespierre's left-hand man, played by Raymond Massey (second only to Basil Rathbone in portraying distinguished villains). Interestingly, Howard actually was a British agent in World War II.
<P>
Two More Great Movies about the Value of Tradition: Goodbye, Mr. Chips (1939). Robert Donat, who won the Oscar for Best Actor, is superb as the shy teacher whose long service wins the affection of generations of schoolboys. Telling moment: Mr. Chips, reading out list of teachers and old boys killed in World War I, includes the former teacher of German who died fighting on the other side.
Tunes of Glory (1960). A Scottish regiment falls into turmoil when army bureaucrat tries to override its traditions.
<P>
Best Movie Depicting America as One Culture: It's a Big Country (1952). Eight short stories about the immigrant experience, with an all-star cast (Gene Kelly, Gary Cooper, Fredric March, Nancy Davis). Best line: ``Religion is part of the heart of American culture.'' Note the producer, liberal Dore Schary. Liberal then, conservative today: because the Clintons' secular and multicultural politics are radical; they have abandoned traditional liberalism. Where today's liberals prattle about ``diversity,'' Schary's movie ends: ``America, one nation, indivisible.''
<P>
Best Movie Critique of Multiculturalism: Around the World in Eighty Days (Best Picture of 1956). Intrepid Phileas Fogg (David Niven), exemplar of British imperial phlegm, rescues Indian princess from suttee funeral pyre (young Shirley MacLaine, of all people!). Many critics today undoubtedly would object. After all, if that's the Indian custom, what right has Fogg to impose Western values?
<P>
Best Anti-Anti-American Movie: Barcelona (1994) describes the last gasp of European anti-
Americanism -- the Soviet-inspired campaign to halt U.S. missile deployment in the early Eighties -- through the eyes of two young Americans trying to pick up Spanish girls. Good fun.
<P>
Best Conservative Science-Fiction Movies: Frankenstein (1931) and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1932) explore the consequences of hubris -- Dr. F.'s ``insane ambition'' and ``mad dream.'' Sounds like the Great Society -- except that Mr. Hyde and the Monster don't live on indefinitely.
The Thing (1951). The scientist as Rationalist Fool. Researchers in the Arctic defrost a visitor from outer space who is not friendly. Here is an early prototype of the scientists behind SANE and the nuclear freeze, and who oppose any common-sense policy to defend ourselves. Best scene: the scientist attempts to negotiate.
<P>
Best Conservative Musicals: MGM's Singin' in the Rain (1952), An American in Paris (1951), and The Bandwagon (1953). They are conservative because Gene Kelly, Fred Astaire, and director Vincente Minnelli celebrate common sense and professionalism over pretension and phoniness. They have no designs on us, they simply want to divert and amuse.
<P>
Best Conservative Special-Effects Movie: San Francisco (1936), for the famous earthquake. Clark Gable as blasphemous gambler finds faith through priest friend Spencer Tracy and beautiful, devout Jeanette MacDonald.
<P>
Best Scene Illustrating Press Irresponsibility: King Kong (1933). As the giant ape is being exhibited in a New York theater, the press is invited onto the stage to photograph Ann Darrow (Fay Wray) standing before him. The flash bulbs enrage the beast and his captor demands they stop: ``He thinks you're attacking the girl.'' The photographers click away, one saying: ``Let him roar. It's a swell picture.'' The rest of the story is, as they say, history.
<P>
Best Movie Illustrating Politicians' Blather: In Hitchcock's The 39 Steps (1935), our hero on the run finds himself in a political meeting, where he is mistaken for the official introducing the candidate. He proceeds to deliver a hilarious parody of windy oratory -- and gets a standing ovation.
HONORABLE MENTION: A Face in the Crowd (1957). This will stand as the best movie depiction of an Arkansas demagogue until Barbra Streisand produces a movie biography of the 42nd President. A striking film about TV image manipulation, ahead of its time. Directed by Elia Kazan.
<P>
Best Conservative Silent Movies: Orphans of the Storm (1921), America (1926), both by the father of all directors, D. W. Griffith; plus Ben Hur (1925); The Iron Horse (1924), directed by John Ford; and Noah's Ark (1929), an early Michael Curtiz gem in which the flood was so realistic that some extras drowned.
Best Conservative Shorts: The Sons of Liberty, with Claude Rains as Hayim Solomon, who comes to the financial rescue of Washington's Army, and dies reciting the Declaration of Independence. (One more by Michael Curtiz.)
The Monroe Doctrine. The melodramatic sweep and production panache of Casablanca applied to U.S. history.
An Airman's Letter to His Mother. U.K. film by Michael Powell, based on fact, in which RAF officer penned an eloquent statement of war aims before he was shot down.
And Our Gang in Three Smart Guys, wherein the boys play hooky and go fishing, only to receive a lesson in how those who study catch the biggest fish of all.

<P>
Dear Rusty,
<P>

A few months ago, Bill and I were having lunch together, and I said to him, ``Bill, you should get out and meet the people, get the campaign muscles warmed up.'' He nodded, picked up the phone, dialed a few numbers, and said into the phone, ``Dick, it's Bill. What are my numbers today?''
A few minutes later, the fax machine delivered the numbers: he beats Dole, Lamar!, and Buchanan. He's got a 49 per cent approval rating in Iowa and New Hampshire -- which, with the margin of error, is almost a 49.5 per cent!
``Al,'' Bill said as he surveyed his fax, ``it looks like I'm going to New Hampshire and Iowa.''
I headed off to Florida to talk about preserving the Everglades, a real barnburner. After the rally, I headed to a local coffee shop to do what we in the campaign biz call ``a flying drop-by.''
I moved on down the row of booths until another elderly woman introduced me to her husband.
``What brings you to the Miami - Dade area?'' she asked.
``What?'' asked her husband.
``I ASKED HIM WHAT BRINGS HIM TO THE AREA,'' she replied loudly. Several Secret Service agents turned down their earpieces.
``I'm here to talk about preserving the indigenous creatures of South Florida. You know, we too easily assume that because a mammal has scaly skin or is unattractive to look at, that we can just let it die. Well I'm here to fight for their preservation.''
``HE'S HERE TO PRESERVE SOCIAL SECURITY,'' she shouted.
``Well, actually -- ''
``You mean you're not?'' she asked.
``That's exactly why I'm here,'' I said.
You know, Rusty, back in the '88 Democratic primary, I would have told that woman the truth: that I wasn't in South Florida to talk about Social Security, and that if I was elected, I would means-test benefits and gradually phase out the system, and replace it with an IRA-type instrument. 
Boy, have I learned a lot since then!
A quick change of clothes and I was in snowy New Hampshire.
Since I had so much luck with the senior citizens in Florida, I scoped out a lonely looking old man sitting by himself at the counter of the local Derry, New Hampshire coffee shop.
``Sir,'' I said, ``I'm Al Gore, and Bill Clinton and I would like your vote in November.''
``Forget it, Al,'' said the man. ``I'm going all the way.'' And then he chuckled to himself.
``Dick Lugar?'' I asked.
``So what if I am?'' said the old man, who, it turned out, was indeed Dick Lugar. ``So what if I come in fifth or sixth? I've just got to stay viable until Super Tuesday, ride out the storm, walk into the convention hall with my head held high, and then, you know what? People will say -- hey, Dole can't beat Clinton, Lamar can't beat Dole, but who's the man with the eye of the tiger? Who's the White Knight come to slay the Dragon?''
``Colin Powell?'' I asked.
``Exactly. And when he isn't available it'll all fall in Dickie Lugar's lap, just you wait.'' He held his coffee mug up to the waitress. ``You want to hotten this up for me, honey?''
As she poured him more coffee, I slipped out.
I was about to enter another local coffee shop, when we had to wait for the CNN camera crew to make it from Manchester, where Pat Buchanan had announced that Burger King was owned by Grand Metropolitan, an English-owned company, and that when he was elected, he'd string concertina wire along the drive-through lane until each Whopper was ``crafted with pride by legal Americans in the USA.''
As I waited outside the coffee shop for the crew to arrive, it began to snow.
``Can't I wait inside the coffee shop?'' I asked.
``Then we'll miss getting the delighted looks on the faces of the citizens of Nashua as they realize that the Vice President is joining them for lunch.''
``But they can see me standing here through the window. Look, some of them are waving.''
``Don't worry, Mr. Vice President. These are New Hampshire folks. They'll turn it on for the cameras. They're just saving their energy for show time.''
But, sad to say, Rusty, I never did get to go inside. Boy, did I freeze my toes out there in the snow. But, apparently, back at the Burger King in Manchester, Pat Buchanan committed a verbal gaffe when he declared that he was the only candidate running who would beat President Hindenburg in November -- so the CNN crew never left.
I'm getting the feeling back in my toes! I'm ready for Super Tuesday!

NEW YORK, FEBRUARY 16
<p>
Mr. Yeltsin has announced that he will run for re-election as President of Russia. It is his duty to ``consolidate all healthy forces and prevent shocks that could lead to a civil war.'' That is quite a threat to toss about, something no candidate in New Hampshire has got around to. In the past few months Mr. Yeltsin has got rid of those of his lieutenants identified with the reform movement. This greatly surprised those members of our State Department who rued the long interval back in 1991 during which Gorbachev was falling apart and U.S. policy refused to recognize the importance of Yeltsin. We did so only after that dramatic day in Red Square when Yeltsin defied the revolutionists and soon after was elected president.
<P>
It was demoralizing to read the assessment of Yeltsin by Vyacheslav Kostikov, Yeltsin's former press secretary. ``Power is his ideology,'' he said, ``his concubine if you want, his lover -- and his passion. Everything that is beyond the fight for power concerns him much less.'' When that remark about Yeltsin was aired, Kostikov was instantly fired (he had been ambassador to the Vatican). Fifty years earlier he'd have been instantly executed. Even ten years ago he would have suffered something more resonant than dismissal from a diplomatic post.
<p>
There are many contenders for the presidency of Russia, but the thinking in some quarters is that there will be a run-off between the two lead candidates, and that they will be Yeltsin and Gennadi Zyuganov. Now Mr. Zyuganov, formerly a provincial teacher, is running on the Communist Party ticket and is thought the probable victor.
<p>
It staggers the mind. Suppose that in Germany a politician were to run on the National Socialist Party ticket. He might say, ``Let's see if this time around we can do it without killing the Jews, or invading France.'' Zyuganov being a very acute politician, it can't be said of him that he got tripped up into running as a Communist. As with Yeltsin, one can't know what this politician's internal designs or attachments or loyalties are. But Zyuganov proclaims his attachment to Communism, intending to persuade the Russians that much of the pain they now experience -- en route to a free society and a free market -- they didn't experience back then under Stalin and Brezhnev, when no one was ever fired from his job, prices were stable, and crime was at low tide. In December's parliamentary race Zyuganov faced a liberal challenger. At one of their encounters, posters were flaunted: ``50,000,000 VICTIMS OF CIVIL WAR, COLLECTIVIZATION AND REPRESSION WOULD NOT VOTE FOR ZYUGANOV.'' He won handily.
<p>
The great revisionism is underway. It begins by closing the memory. Four years ago, 84 per cent of high-school students tested knew what the Gulag was. Today, only 34 per cent can tell you that the Gulag was that great charnel, the archipelago in which twenty million Russians were killed, either by execution squads, or starvation, or exposure. Such historical tablelands, when brought to the attention of the Communist candidate for President, are shrugged off as incidents of yesteryear. ``We can't answer for the mistakes of the past.''
<p>
What is lost sight of is the primary finding of history in the matter of the Communist approach to government. It is that the cruelty, the repression, the economic sclerosis are an organic part of the whole. When Gorbachev authorized glasnost his critics proved absolutely correct, that glasnost would need to be repealed, or else that it would bring on the dissolution of the Communist enterprise, because free speech and Communism are irreconcilable. Yeltsin is already moving toward economic interventionism, and in his pursuit of power will almost certainly go further. The Communists in China are experimenting with economic freedom carefully sequestered, but their fear of its leverage on civil rights brings them to furious exhibitions of power and threat; because experience teaches that economic freedom requires a measure of personal freedom. 
<p>
So, after all of this, the next President of Russia might be a Communist. What will be his attitude toward the liberated republics? We know what the position is of Zhirinovsky, the hero of the super nationalists: bring them all back. If that were accomplished, we would be facing a Communist leader of a new Soviet Union and wondering, quite reasonably, whether it would be thought new for so very long.
<P>

<HR>
26-FEBRUARY-1996
<P>

<LI>Outgoing, and if that isn't proof of God, what is? Rep. Pat Schroeder (D., Colo.)
instructed Sen. Al D'Amato (R., N.Y.) to stop the ``witch hunt'' against Hillary Clinton.
Ahhh . . . le mot juste. <p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>

<LI>The Republican loss of Bob Packwood's Oregon Senate seat shouldn't come as a shock, even
though conservative businessman Gordon Smith had a good chance to pull off a long-shot
victory there. Instead, Rep. Ron Wyden, the Portland liberal who in his 15 years in Congress
has famously managed to avoid learning Bosnia's location or the name of the Canadian prime
minister, squeaked through by a paper-thin 1 per cent margin. If Wyden's win is hardly a
harbinger of a liberal revival, it does point to some Republican weaknesses, especially on
the environment. Wyden made crucial inroads among suburban women with the issue, which
Republicans have consistently mishandled over the last year (they have yet to find a
convincing way to defend free-market environmental reforms). Meanwhile, liberal coalition
groups demonstrated that they still have some weight to throw around, dumping hundreds of
thousands of dollars into ads that made a mockery of Wyden's ``100 per cent positive''
campaign. The Teamsters ran a shameful radio spot accusing Smith of, in effect, being
responsible for the death of a 14-year-old at one of his companies. Smith, a top-notch
candidate, almost overcame it all, even prevailing among older voters, according to one exit
poll, despite the usual Democratic Mediscare campaign. The GOP should take heart: if a
conservative message almost takes in ecotopian Oregon, it can sell anywhere.

<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>

<LI> Mrs. Clinton must now be willing to answer the Senate Whitewater Committee's questions
in writing. She called Barbara Feinman to the White House.

<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>

<LI> Rep. Charles Canady (R., Fla.) plans to revive his bill banning federal race and gender
preferences, again presenting the House leadership with the decision whether or not to push
it. Last year, the leadership blinked, opting for the development of an ``empowerment
package'' that would, in theory, provide cover for a subsequent assault on racial
preferences. That package is now almost complete, but waiting for it to wend its way through
Congress would be a mistake. No package of enterprise zones and school vouchers is ever
going to win over blocs of minority voters or make it easy to repeal preferences. But the
same voices that urged the empowerment tack last year -- including Southern conservatives
worried about energizing their districts' black voters -- will be raised against Canady
again. Their fears are unjustified: Are any of the 226 Republicans who voted to end the
Viacom set-aside last year suffering as a result? In any case, with a revived California
Civil Rights Initiative now likely to make the November ballot (thanks to the support of
Gov. Pete Wilson), there will be no dodging affirmative action in the fall. Congressional
Republicans might as well seize the moral high ground of color-blindness, present President
Clinton with a bill that makes for a tough veto -- and stop looking guilt-ridden about it.

<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>

<LI> Dr. Kevorkian has presided over the suicide of his 27th ``patient,'' showing once more
that he believes the Hippocratic Oath to be a living document.

<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>

<LI> The ruckus over the proposed Parental Rights Amendment, which asserts that ``The right
of parents to direct the upbringing and education of their children shall not be
infringed,'' points up the degree to which the traditional prerogatives of parents have
already been eroded by the state. Through the schools, it has arrogated to itself the right
to counsel children on everything from careers to abortion options. Introduced now in twenty
state legislatures with eight more in the offing, the amendment has so far garnered wide
support, including that of the very visible Virginia Gov. George Allen; some, believing the
idea less viable as an amendment, have embodied its essence in more salable bills before
legislatures. Critics say they oppose the watering-down of local school boards' legitimate
authority to help abused or neglected children. What they really dread is the loss of the
educational establishment's promotion of a purely secular agenda. One proponent of the
amendment accurately described the opposition as showing ``the level of distrust of parents
by the elitist so-called experts who want to raise our children. Whose kids are they,
anyway?''

<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>

<LI> At the big feminist meeting in Washington last week Michelle Billies, a 28-year-old
social worker, sighed, ``We do feel that the world is open to us. But we find out that it's
not the clear straight path we may think it is.'' Welcome to the human race, baby.

<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>

<LI> House Democratic Leader Richard Gephardt has spent his long congressional career
fighting Republican tax-cut proposals. In the 1980s he opposed President Reagan's cuts in
the income-tax rate. In the early 1990s he successfully blocked President Bush's proposal to
cut capital-gains taxes. And, today, he stands in the way of Republican efforts to grant
parents a $500-per-child tax credit. Gephardt, a self-proclaimed advocate of ``working
Americans,'' says Republican tax-relief initiatives subsidize fat cats by raiding programs
for the elderly, the poor, and the infirm. Thanks to an ethics complaint filed against
Gephardt by Rep. Jennifer Dunn (R., Wash.) we now know that in 1991, while he was blocking
tax cuts for the rest of us, he was involved in a property swap to acquire a substantial
oceanfront lot. The deal enabled Gephardt to avoid paying about $79,500 in capital-gains
taxes. Apparent inconsistencies among Gephardt's real-estate and tax records raise serious
questions of possible tax and bank fraud. Worst of all, think of the schoolchildren who went
without hot lunches.

<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>

<LI> The key to Republican success is to make the next election a referendum on the
incumbent President -- to run, in other words, a ``negative'' campaign. An implication of
this strategy is that Republicans in Congress must abandon the attempt to build a
``positive'' record for themselves. An object lesson in what not to do is provided by the
GOP's decision, as we go to press, to send President Clinton a watered-down package of
welfare and Medicaid reforms cobbled together by the nation's governors. The substance of
this deal is bad enough. For the sake of immediate budget savings for the states,
Republicans are now endorsing proposals that would have no perceptible effect on American
life -- other than to persuade the public five years from now that conservative reforms have
been tried and have failed. The politics is worse. Clinton has already vetoed welfare and
Medicaid reform: now he will have another opportunity to deprive Republicans of a key issue
and build up a fraudulent ``New Democrat'' personality. By September, he will be sounding
like Charles Murray on the stump.

<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>

<LI> Re: President Clinton's veto (later overridden by Congress) of the bill limiting
securities-fraud suits. With one stroke of his pen Mr. Clinton: a) alienated the business
community, especially the high-tech companies headquartered in California, the most populous
state; b) alienated Democratic moderates who supported the bill; c) aligned himself with
trial lawyers, arguably the least-liked group in the nation; and d) reinforced the
perception of a man bereft of core beliefs, since only a few days before his veto he was
telling supporters he would sign the bill. Well, at least he's efficient.

<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>

<LI> It just isn't safe to make a joke about global warming. Someone will take it seriously.
So it happened when we wrote that the January 7 - 8 blizzard in the Northeast obviously
``proves'' global warming has arrived . . . Whereupon Jessica Matthews, a leading
environmentalist commentator, immediately wrote a column in the  Washington Post arguing
precisely this proposition with great seriousness. Global warming as a long-term trend, said
she, is increasing the severity of the weather, whether hot or cold, flood or drought. The
problem is that the climate models all predict higher temperatures at the poles (hence the
melting of the icecaps) and minimal change at the equator. Since most extreme weather events
are driven by temperature differences between the poles and the equator, global warming
should reduce the severity of storms, not increase them. At other times it has been claimed
that the warming would be apparent if only all that awful atmospheric pollution weren't
there. A few years ago, we were being told that the explosion of Mount Pinatubo was masking
global-warming effects. And so it goes. If one argument disappears, another is grasped, then
another. The theory is logically unfalsifiable, hence unscientific. One thing, however, is
clear: since global temperatures began to be measured accurately from a satellite in 1979,
there has been no warming trend, rather a slight cooling. The rest is, well, hot air.

<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>

<LI> There are three things Hillary must do to become more popular. Unfortunately, no one
knows what they are.

<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>

<LI> Jacques Chirac, the most pro-American French president in decades, recently paid a
state visit to Washington. When he addressed a joint session of Congress, all the seats on
the Republican side of the aisle were filled (so much for Republican isolationism), but
there were rows of vacancies on the Democratic side. Some were out campaigning; some were
protesting France's just-completed series of underground nuclear tests in the Pacific. Poor
Chirac -- boycotted by American Greens even after he had caved in to Clinton Administration
pressures to curtail the tests. Perhaps the Republicans should have boycotted his speech to
protest his cave-in.

<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>

<LI> Sesame Street is going to be shown in Russia. If Vlas, Enik, and Korzhik don't sound
quite like Bert, Ernie, and the Cookie Monster, too bad. PBS gets its foot in the door, and
we all know where that can lead. Next it will be Barney, then All Things Considered, then
the restoration of the Soviet empire . . .

<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>

<LI> In Rochester, New York, the parents of a comatose young woman have been confronted with
certain ``ethical'' considerations about saving the life of a baby growing inside their
daughter's body. The daughter has been in a coma for ten years, and this past summer she
seems to have been raped by someone at her nursing home. Before the car crash that sent her
into a coma, she was adamantly pro-life, and so her parents think she would object to an
abortion. An ``ethicist'' quoted in the New York Times will have none of it. Ellen Moskowitz
asks if ``using [the comatose woman] as a vessel . . . offends the natural order.'' So, goes
the implied answer, off with the baby's head! For the pregnant woman's Catholic parents, the
``natural order'' has a name, God, and in His eyes using their daughter ``as a vessel'' is
better than killing their grandchild. It looks as if ``ethics,'' as our pluralists define
it, is a one-way street, which always leads away from God, even if believers are involved.
Which isn't very pluralistic, is it?

<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>

<LI> In an early reaction to our cover story last issue, the Clinton White House declared
that ``we're not'' going to ``throw in the towel'' on the drug war, though ``NATIONAL REVIEW
might want to.'' New slogan: FIGHT DRUGS -- DON'T INHALE.

<H1>GEORGE WASHINGTON</H1> 

<H2>Founding Father</H2>
<p>
<H3>by RICHARD BROOKHISER</H3>  
<p> 
<I>His own father died when he was 11, and he had no children
himself.<BR> But Washington bound his fate to the destiny of his stepchildren,
his soldiers, and unborn millions of Americans.
</I><BR>
<P>
<HR  width=50%>
Mr. Brookhiser is a senior editor of NR.<BR>
<HR  width=50%>
This article is adapted from <BR>Father of His Country: Rediscovering George Washington,
(c)1996 by Richard Brookhiser,<BR> to be published later this month by The Free Press, an
imprint of Simon & Schuster. <HR  width=50%> </center><P> <FONT SIZE=+3>W</FONT>E speak of
``founding fathers,'' in the plural. Yet there has been only one ``father'' of this country.
National paternity began gravitating to George Washington six months before the Declaration
of Independence, when one Levi Allen addressed him in a letter as ``our political Father.''
The first reference to him as ``Father of His country'' appeared in an almanac in 1778, and
since then the title has been fixed. <P> That title is the greatest barrier to our
appreciation of him now, for never was the comparative term of the metaphor so problematic.
We are not sure what the fathers of families do, much less fathers of countries. The
stereotypical father of the Fifties, who worked till five, then read the paper, has been
replaced by a new stereotype of dad as diaper-changer. But the increased role taken by
fathers in rearing children (by those who actually take one rather than just talk about it)
has been more than offset by the increased number of fathers who have disappeared through
the escape hatch of divorce. Other fathers vanish pre-emptively, by not marrying the mothers
of their children in the first place, while the men who take their places -- stepfathers,
mothers' boyfriends -- are responsible for most of the beating and raping of children that
goes on. Our predicaments have a biological basis. Bearing a child takes nine months of a
mother's life, and through most of that time, she is in touch with what is going on inside
her. She carries the weight, she feels the kicks. Once a child is born, it seems that a
mother is, to some degree, wired to attend to it, however badly she may do the job. None of
this applies to fathers. Conception is a spasm, an incident. The task can be as easily
accomplished by a sperm bank, or a baster. Without a blood test, fathers cannot tell how
many of ``their'' children are their own, while mothers who have not been rigidly faithful
cannot tell who are the fathers of their children. <P> Seneca, whose book of moral essays
Washington owned, was aware of the wispiness of literal fatherhood. ``My father gave me the
benefit of life . . . not knowing to whom . . . It is true, that without a father I could
never have had a being . . . but I do not, therefore, owe my virtue . . . to my nativity. .
. . The generation of me was the least part of the benefit: for, to live is common with the
brutes; but, to live well is the main business.'' If a man does only the biological minimum
required for fatherhood, then he has no role in whether his children live well, or even in
whether they live at all. <P> Fatherhood, as any society understands it, is the result of
training, and an act of will. A man who would be a father in name as well as in fact must go
beyond what is merely natural. A father is a man who follows through. This is why it was
particularly appropriate that Washington came to be known as the father of his country, for
he was the founder, above all others, who followed through. <P> The old historian's parlor
game, whether events make men or men make events (old because most historians long ago gave
the palm to events), seldom considered the option that was always open to historical actors,
which is that of doing nothing at all. If the question is, How many of Washington's public
deeds were thrust upon him by circumstance?, the simplest and truest answer is that none of
them were, for he could always have stayed home. If an entirely private life would have been
too eccentric for a man of his station -- even the retiring George Mason held public office
-- then he could have spent his career in the planters' club of the Virginia legislature. If
he went to the Continental Congress, he need not have taken committee chairmanships, or made
himself available for military service. At the end of his tenure as Commander-in-Chief, he
could have returned home for good, and spent the remainder of his days farming and fussing
with canals. If he went to the Constitutional Convention, he could have sent the document
into the world, and not himself. After one term as President, he could have stepped down.
But always he did the next thing, and then the next. <P> The span of his accumulated
follow-throughs is remarkable. Jefferson, Jackson, Wilson, Reagan, and (we now realize)
Eisenhower were strong Presidents for two terms, with varying degrees of national leadership
before their first elections. Franklin Roosevelt was a leader in peace and war for 12 years.
Lincoln's national career lasted only 7 years, from the Senate race against Stephen Douglas
to his assassination. Washington was the most important man in America, whether he was
onstage or off, for 24 years; for 17 of those years, he was front and center. It is a record
unmatched in our history, scarcely matched in the histories of modern democracies. <P> <FONT
SIZE=+3>W</FONT>ASHINGTON'S record as a ``political Father'' is all the more striking
because his own father, Augustine Washington, seems to have left such a blank in his life.
Augustine was 38 years old when George was born, the first child of his second marriage, and
he died 11 years later. We know nothing bad about Augustine Washington as a father; we also
know nothing good, except for the facts that he sent his two sons by his first marriage to
England to be educated, and that he left his family a substantial estate. The many volumes
of Washington's collected works yield three brief references to him, all unrevealing. <P>
Scanning Washington's life for possible father figures, one finds a few candidates. His
half-brother Lawrence, 14 years older, was a captain in the British army during a forerunner
of the French and Indian War. Lawrence went off to war when George was 8; here may have
begun the lifelong love of uniforms. Later there was Lawrence's father-in-law, William
Fairfax, who employed George as a surveyor, and General Edward Braddock, who commanded him
in the French and Indian War. But they do not seem to have been significant father
substitutes; they do not bulk as large in Washington's life or his recollections as he
himself loomed in the lives of his proteges. <P> Mary Washington, George's mother, left a
more vivid impression, though it is rather grim. In her later years particularly (which
lasted into her son's Presidency) she was stingy with praise and lavish with demands. During
the Revolution, she encouraged a motion in the Virginia legislature to grant her a pension,
which prompted Washington to send the Speaker of the House a mortified letter. ``Before I
left Virginia, I answered all her calls for money, and since that period, have directed my
steward to do the same. Whence her distresses can arise, therefore, I know not . . . she has
not a child that would not divide the last sixpence to relieve her.'' She did give her son
her temper. ``Of the mother,'' a childhood friend of George's recalled, ``I was ten times
more afraid than of my own parents.'' Mary Washington influenced her son's choice of a wife:
Martha Custis, besides being cute, rich, and a shrewd businesswoman, was calm and devoted,
and never gave her husband a moment's trouble. <P> Washington's early life is too misty to
understand the family dynamics. All that stands out is the lack of positively engaging
parental figures, especially paternal ones. <P> Washington never became a parent himself.
Martha Custis was a 27-year-old widow when he married her in 1759, and she had given birth
four times in her first marriage. There is no account of an illegitimate child of
Washington's that is more than graffiti on the bathroom wall of history. The conclusion that
he was sterile is inescapable. <P> >From time to time he tried to escape the conclusion
nevertheless. After he had resigned his commission as Commander-in-Chief in 1783, he wrote
to Congress asking if he could have the paper back, since it might ``serve my grandchildren
some fifty or a hundred years hence for a theme to ruminate upon.'' Both he and Martha were
over fifty, and they had been married for almost a quarter of a century. If they were going
to have any children, they would have had them by then. Still he ruminated. <P> Six years
later, the subject came up again, though in a very different way. In the discarded draft of
his first inaugural, a long and often personal address which Madison persuaded him not to
give, Washington was prepared to acknowledge his childlessness publicly. ``. . . it will be
recollected,'' he wrote, ``that the Divine Providence hath not seen fit, that my blood
should be transmitted or my name perpetuated by the endearing, though sometimes seducing
channel of immediate offspring. I have no child for whom I could wish to make a provision --
no family to build in greatness upon my country's ruins.'' This lack, he argued, made him
more fit to be entrusted with the Presidency. ``Let then the Adversaries to this
Constitution . . . point to the sinister object, or to the earthly consideration beyond the
hope of rendering some little service to our parent country, that could have persuaded me to
accept this appointment.'' Washington's wistful letter to Congress had been written at the
beginning of his sixth decade; as he neared the end of it, he accepted his personal loss,
and though he never gave the speech, in his own mind he transmuted the loss into a political
benefit. <P> The dynastic temptation was very real. The country was lucky that there was so
little material for temptation to work with. Of the first five Presidents, only John Adams
had sons who survived to adulthood. Jefferson, Madison, and Monroe, whose Administrations
covered the first quarter of the nineteenth century, were known as the ``Virginia dynasty,''
but if the seducing channel of immediate (male) offspring had flowed from any of them, the
dynasty might have extended into a second generation. How much more likely was it that this
would have been the case for literal sons of Washington. None of these men would have
tolerated a son becoming President by any means except election. But a gaggle of junior
Washingtons, Jeffersons, Madisons, and Monroes could have crowded the political landscape
intolerably. As it was, John Adams's eldest son, John Quincy Adams, became the sixth
President. <P> Lacking descendants of his own, Washington turned to three substitutes. The
first were his stepchildren and stepgrandchildren. Two of Martha's four children survived
infancy: a daughter, Patsy, who was sickly and died at 17; and a son, Jack, who married and
lived to be 27. Washington worried about Jack's education, writing one tutor that he wanted
him ``fit for more useful purposes, than a horse Racer,'' and he worried about his behavior
when Jack was elected to the Virginia State Senate during the war: ``I do not suppose that
so young a Senator, as you are . . . can yet have much influence in a populous assembly. . .
. But it is in your power to be punctual in your attendance.'' He expended the same anxious
attention on Jack's son, George Washington Parke Custis. But he never considered the Custis
brood his own, and they never considered him theirs. ``. . . his own near relatives feared
to speak or laugh before him,'' remembered Nelly Custis, one of Jack's daughters, ``. . .
not from his severity,'' but out of ``awe and respect. . . . When he entered a room where we
were all mirth and in high conversation, all were instantly mute. He would sit a short time
and then retire, quite nd the army was winding up its affairs, he twice used a striking
phrase. In a letter to a staff officer, he hoped that the ``Peace and Independency for which
we have fought'' would be ``a blessing to Millions yet unborn,'' and in the Circular to the
States, his farewell address as Commander-in-Chief, he warned that ``our fate'' was bound up
with ``the destiny of unborn Millions.'' This was a more particularized image than ``the
destiny of the republican form of government,'' which he would invoke in the version of the
first inaugural address that he actually delivered -- more particularized, and more
personal, even though the persons were unknown, unknowable.     In 1783, as his letter to
Congress showed, he still imagined that the unborn millions might include descendants of his
own. But even if he had been the most prolific father in the world, most of them would be
the posterity of others -- strangers to his blood, as well as strangers to him in time.
Mentioning them was an act of adoption. <P> Six years later, Washington received a printed
sermon, which had been delivered in 1759 by a minister in Maine. Washington got sermons all
the time; when he acknowledged this one, he added that he ``appro[ved] of the doctrine
inculcated.'' The sermon commemorated the death of a Maine hero, Sir William Pepperrell, who
fought in two colonial wars and was made a baronet and a general. The text was from Psalm
82, a short psalm addressed to ``the mighty'' of the earth, which ends by reminding them
that ``ye shall die like men.'' What, when the mighty die, should they have accomplished?
The minister turned for an answer to a funeral oration quoted by Socrates. ``Hereditary
Honor is indeed a noble and splendid Patrimony. But to enjoy a fair Estate, either in Fame
or Money, and for want of a proper Supply of Wealth and Glory of your own, not to be able to
transmit it to your Posterity, is infamous and unmanly.'' The mighty -- the Pepperrells and
the Washingtons -- should pass on as much honor and riches as they had inherited. But to
whom? Hereditary, Patrimony, and Posterity are terms of blood, of literal fathers and
children. General Pepperrell had a son; this part of the sermon had been addressed to him.
General Washington had no sons. But he could ensure that his ``Honor,'' the reflection of
his life lived well, might be a benefit to the millions unborn, his adopted political heirs.
This was a doctrine he could approve of.<P>

<P>
Dear Rusty,
<P>

You'll never believe it! Tipper just gave me the best gift ever -- and it isn't even my
birthday! <P> I was sitting in my study, reading that new book, Primary Colors. It's a new
novel by an anonymous author loosely -- and I mean loosely -- based on our '92 campaign. The
whole town is trying to figure out who wrote the darn thing. Personally, I don't really
care. It's not a funny book. It's a mean book. If Bob Dole wasn't so busy campaigning and if
I wasn't sure that he wasn't on our Clinton-Gore '92 Bus Tour, then I'd be convinced that he
wrote it. <P> Anyway, while I was reading, Tipper wheeled in a giant crate. She giggled
excitedly while I opened it -- it was a HealthRider. Sort of a cross between a see-saw and a
bicycle. <P> ``Tipper!'' I shouted happily. ``This is the best present ever!'' <P> ``I knew
you wanted one,'' she said. <P> ``Wanted one?'' I said. ``Tip, I needed one. Watching those
clips from the State of the Union -- '' <P> ``I know, I know.'' <P> `` -- and listening to
Al Jr. say, 'Who's that fat guy sitting next to Newt Gingrich?' But aren't these things
expensive?'' <P> ``Don't worry about it, Al,'' Tipper said mysteriously. ``I've just had a
little windfall. Pretend like I invested in cattle futures, if it eases your mind.'' <P>
``But why, Tipper? Why the surprise?'' <P> ``Well,'' Tipper said, ``it looks like it's going
to be a long, hard campaign -- '' <P> ``You think I need to shape up for a race against Bob
Dole?'' <P> ``Okay, okay. You look fat, Al. And I don't want to have to let out the waist of
your inauguration trousers.'' <P> ``Okay, then,'' I said. I appreciated Tipper's honesty.
And before I knew it, I was bobbing up and down on the bicycle seat just like they do on the
commercial. It was a cozy Sunday afternoon, and one of the few quiet ones we've had for a
while. The girls were at the library studying for exams, Bill was in New Hampshire at a
pancake breakfast, Hillary was at the office of Wilmer, Cutler, & Pickering, and Al Jr. was
quietly surfing the 'Net until his mother saw the places he was surfing to and put a stop to
it. <P> After about twenty minutes of bouncing up and down, I was pretty tuckered out. So I
collapsed on the couch with Primary Colors. Tipper curled up next to me and read the Sunday
New York Times. <P> ``Primary Colors just hit the bestseller list,'' she said. <P> I
shrugged. I don't really like it when I'm reading and Tipper keeps trying to start a
conversation. It's one of the reasons I haven't been able to get through the Telecom bill.
<P> ``Tipper, do you mind?'' <P> ``I'm sorry.'' <P> ``It's just that I have to finish this
stupid book this afternoon. I don't want to be left out at tomorrow's Cabinet meeting.'' I
went back to reading. <P> Tipper rustled a few pages of the paper. ``Al?'' <P> I looked up,
exasperated. ``What?'' <P> ``What did you mean when you said it was a 'stupid' book? The
critics don't seem to think it's 'stupid.' The Post called it 'winning and lively.' The New
York papers raved. It got nice write-ups in The New Yorker and Time and Newsweek. And it's
selling like hot cakes. And if it gets sold to the movies we're talking some heavy coin.
They have to let the original author write the first draft. So when you say something is
'stupid' you should think first, because a lot of people might think that writing a book
about the environment is stupid and writing a best-selling novel about the '92 presidential
campaign is smart. Especially the author of Primary Colors and her agent, Mort Janklow, who
thinks she's a 'rare comic find.''' <P> ``Excuse me?'' <P> ``Nothing. It's the weather. It's
got me cranky.'' <P> She smiled her wide Tipper smile, and I smiled back because I know how
the weather can ruin a person's mood. It's this damn global warming, Rusty. It's made the
winters cold and the summers hot and the autumns chilly and the springs wet. Where will it
end? <P> I went back to my reading. Tipper suddenly looked up. <P> ``Kim Basinger and Alec
Baldwin!'' she cried. <P> ``What?'' I asked. <P> ``They'll play us in the movie of Primary
Colors!'' <P> ``Tipper, we're not even in the book.'' <P> ``Yeah, well, we'll be in the
movie.'' <P> And she raced off, leaving me in peace to finish the book. I'm sorry, Rusty.
It's just not funny. And I know funny. <P> Your Pal,  Al <P> </body> </html>

<H3>Misfire On Drug Policy
</H3> 
<div align=center><p>

<p>Wm. F. Buckley Jr. </p>


NEW YORK, JANUARY 30
<P>
The bipartisan Council on Crime in America, whose most conspicuous spokesman is William
Bennett, does fine work, but when it touches on the matter of drugs its analytical powers
simply decompose, as though the writer were high on crack cocaine or the legal stuff. <P>
Last week the Council exploded in opposition to the call for an approach to the legalization
of drugs made by seven writers (myself included) in this journal. To the title of the
symposium -- ``The War on Drugs Is Lost'' -- the Council replies that that is most certainly
not so. To the end of proving this, it cites the reduction of drug use by non-addicts. It
declined by 50 per cent between 1979 and 1992. The planted axiom of course is that that
decline is owing to the war on drugs. But what is it that accounts for the decline in the
number of users of tobacco during the same period, from 33.5 million to 26.5 million? The
use of tobacco is not illegal. But since 1979, and beginning even before that, the
deleterious effect of cigarettes was so persuasively argued that even William Bennett gave
up smoking. <P> A look at the formal side of the war on drugs is required. If something is
illegal, then the law that makes it so is effective to the extent that it imprisons those
who violate it, thereby hypothetically reducing the number of lawbreakers. <P> That would
seem obvious, but isn't to the distinguished members of the Council on Crime in America. In
1985, 811,000 arrests were made for drug offenses. In 1994, 1.35 million arrests were made
for drug offenses. Does that mean that the war on drugs is effective? Well, no. An effective
law diminishes, rather than increases, the number of violators who have to be arrested. <P>
And then of course one asks, If 1.35 million drug users were arrested in 1994, how many drug
users were not arrested? The Council informs us that there are more than 4 million casual
users of cocaine (defined as people who use it less than once a week). How so? Why haven't
they been arrested? And goes on to say that there are over 2.2 million heavy (at least
weekly) users. That makes a total of 6.2 million who violate the law from once a week, to
every two weeks or so. How effective is the war when such figures can be cited? Now take the
big one. There are over 70 million Americans who have smoked marijuana, and about 10 million
who continue to do so. Why aren't they in jail? Does the Council on Crime in America really
wish that they were in jail? <P> It must have embarrassed the Council that the same week it
sputtered forth on the great success of the war on drugs, The Economist cited another
Council report on crime in America which gainsays its entire position on the drug war. We
learn that only one criminal is jailed for every hundred violent crimes committed; that over
one-half of America's convicted felons are not sentenced to prison (because, in part, the
prisons are full); that the most violent criminals serve less than one-half their sentences,
and the average murderer released in 1992 from a state prison had served only 5.9 years. <P>
The Economist cites the experience of a patrolman in Haughville, a scruffy area of
Indianapolis. ``He drives up and down in the evenings, past anoraked figures who stand
outside liquor stores and turn their faces from him. He can guess what they are; few people
apart from drug dealers stand around on nights like this, when the puddles in the potholes
freeze hard. Besides, Patrolman Reichle knows most of them: he reckons he has arrested one
in five of these young men.'' City prosecutors ``do not even bring charges against drug
dealers until they have been arrested several times. Those who do get charged and found
guilty will not go to prison, unless they have other convictions. President Bill Clinton's
call for a crackdown on drug dealers sounds pretty hollow in Haughville.'' <P> Such is
overcrowding in state prisons in Indiana -- notwithstanding that the national increase in
prison space is threefold since we decided to wage hard war on drugs -- that even a
relatively new American prison might have merited describing by Charles Dickens. ``Prisoners
pass their days in narrow, ill-lit cages; there are no chairs or tables, so the men pace up
and down like zoo animals or slouch upon the floor.'' <P> So what has the war done? It has
made a mockery of an anti-drug law that is simply ignored by millions; it has induced
violent felonies in pursuit of drug profits; and it is self-evidently powerless to do
anything about the recent increase in marijuana use by reckless adolescents. It is a pity
that men and women of the moral and intellectual character of William Bennett treat drug
legalization as the equivalent of moral acquiescence in drug abuse, when other reasons for
repealing our stupid laws are so clearly articulated, primary among them to relieve non-drug
users from the heavy load they bear in the phony and ineffective war. One forgets -- who won
the Hundred Years War back then? Was it really necessary to take it on for one hundred
years? <P>

<center>
<h2>The Week</h2>
<hr></center>
<P>

<p><li>
Scientists have found the so-called missing mass of the universe, the invisible matter that shapes galaxies. It was discovered in a cardboard box inside a closet at the White House.

<p><li>It's time for Republicans to beat a strategic retreat on the balanced budget. Any attempt in the House to stick it to the President with so-called ``targeted appropriations'' -- bills that fund Republican priorities, but not those of the Democrats (AmeriCorps, the Commerce Department) -- will appear vindictive, rather than simply economy-oriented. And the President will just veto the bills. Nor should Republicans give Mr. Clinton a reason to paint them as ``extremists'' by playing politics with the debt limit. The GOP's best option is to pass a continuing resolution funding the government for the rest of the year at levels low enough that they can say they have cut spending as much as could be done with a recalcitrant Democrat in the White House. Then they should put the budget behind them. Republicans can continue to slam the Clinton budget proposal as dishonest, but only within the context of a wide-ranging assault on the President designed to collect as many vetoes (or Senate filibusters) on tough issues as possible. In keeping with this strategy, the GOP's work on welfare should be considered complete. Clinton already sided with ``welfare as we know it'' with his veto of a weak reform bill this month. Why give him a second chance? Next, he should be made to declare himself on affirmative action, English as the official language, third-trimester abortions, and all the other issues pushed aside by the GOP's year-long effort to balance the books. The more chances Republicans give Clinton to obstruct popular legislation unacceptable to his liberal base, the more likely voters are to veto him in November. After that the ``revolution'' can begin in earnest.

<p><li>In a speech to the Cato Institute, Sen. Phil Gramm became the first candidate in the presidential race to offer a comprehensive economic agenda. Gramm promises to balance the budget in his first term and, if re-elected, to start paying back the national debt. He proposes a flat tax set at 16 per cent; if his policies spark so much economic growth that federal revenues threaten to increase ahead of schedule, the rate would be cut still further. He would repeal the estate and gift taxes and work to reduce regulations to free trade. Flat-tax purists will not be perfectly satisfied -- Gramm would not abolish the deductions for mortgage interest and charitable giving, as Steve Forbes does. And where Forbes would eliminate capital-gains taxes, Gramm would apply the 16 per cent rate to them after adjusting for inflation. But if enacted, Gramm's proposal would still provide the most favorable treatment of capital in recent history. And it's the most politically attractive reform plan around. By retaining the two deductions and by taxing investment income at the individual level rather than at the business level, Gramm cuts off openings for liberal attacks while sacrificing little of substance. Any candidate who wants to offer a different plan is going to have a tough act to follow.

<p><li>Tax-policy wonks were recently treated to the rarest of rarities: a controlled experiment in supply-side theory. In 1993 the top federal income-tax rate for the highest-income families ($250,000+) was increased from 31 per cent to 39.6 per cent. The income cap on Medicare taxes was also eliminated, effectively tacking on another 2.9 per cent. By contrast, income-tax rates on the middle-income group ($50,000 to $200,000) didn't change. So we have, in effect, two test tubes -- tax hike, and no tax hike -- with everything else held constant. The results? Gross income of the ``tax hike'' highest bracket fell $31 billion short of the level it would have reached had it kept pace with the gross income of the ``no tax hike'' middle-brackets in 1993. So instead of collecting an extra $16 billion, Uncle Sam received just $5 billion, according to a National Bureau of Economic Research study. By earning less, highest earners have pushed a larger share of federal taxes onto the backs of the rest of us.

<p><li>President Clinton toyed with a core belief that he would like to punch columnist William Safire in the nose for calling Miz Hillary a congenital liar. He has not yet expressed any core belief about punching out columnists Suzanne Fields, Georgie Anne Geyer, and Mona Charen, among others who concluded Miz Hillary was you-know-whatting about her role in Travelgate and Whitewater.

<p><li>A while back Nina Totenberg of National Public Radio said that ``if there is retributive justice,'' Jesse Helms will ``get AIDS from a transfusion, or one of his grandchildren will get it.'' The tireless Arnold Beichman has found a source for her moral reasoning. After the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, the anti-nuclear activist Dr. Helen Caldicott told a reporter that ``the accident should have happened here. I hate to say that as a physician, but unless there are thousands of American martyrs, nothing will be done.'' Dr. Caldicott has disappeared since the end of the Cold War. Maybe Nina Totenberg could find out where, and join her.

<p><li>It is the conventional wisdom of welfare reformers across the political spectrum that people on welfare must move to the work force. The problem is that welfare pays too well for most of them to afford to work. The latest Cato Institute Policy Report shows that in New York City welfare provides the equivalent of an hourly pre-tax wage of $14.75 (it's $11.35 in Baltimore and $10.90 in Detroit). In 40 states welfare pays more than $8.00 an hour, and in 17 states more than $10 an hour. In 9 states welfare pays more than the average first-year salary of a schoolteacher, and in 29 states more than the average starting pay of a secretary. In 47 states it pays more than a janitor gets. In the 6 most generous states a first-year computer programmer would be better off on welfare. How many NR readers would be better off on welfare? And would they use the extra cash to buy subscriptions for friends?

<p><li>An observant reader notes an apparent contradiction among NR editors. Contributing Editor Stephen Moore argues in NR (December 25) that Republicans are losing the budget battle because Federal Government spending will continue to increase in dollar terms. Senior Editor Peter Brimelow, with help from NR Economics Analyst Ed Rubenstein, argued in Forbes (December 18) that Republicans are winning because federal spending will fall as a share of the economy (at least 3 percentage points of Gross Domestic Product between 1995 and 2005 -- both in the Republican and in the White House plans). Who's right? Both. Dollars spent are important because there's no absolute reason why spending should move pari passu with GDP. But the Federal Government's share of GDP is the ultimate issue, because it measures Washington's stultifying effect. Now all we need is for those out-year forecasts to be something like accurate.

<p><li>The presidential campaign, as George Will remarked, is generating more detailed policy arguments than usual. Yet the recent Republican debates have been remarkably unedifying, with most of the cheap shots aimed at Steve Forbes and his flat tax. (See ``On the Right,'' p. 62.) The low point of the Iowa debate came when Lamar Alexander trashed Forbes for having raised the price of his magazine. Far worse than the unfairness to Forbes is the possibility that the rumble could bury tax reform as an issue. Grover Norquist of Americans for Tax Reform has sent an open letter to the candidates reminding them that in ``a similar heated primary season not long ago, one candidate's unfortunate remarks about 'voodoo economics' did incalculable damage to the party over a period of years and contributed to a climate of distrust that ultimately doomed a Presidency.'' Ronald Reagan's 11th Commandment was meant to protect the climate of opinion, as much as personalities.

<p><li>The House and Senate have reconciled their versions of the FY1996 defense authorization bill, but only at the price of significant concessions by the House conferees. The commitment to deploy a multiple-site ground-based national defense against ballistic missiles by the year 2003 has been dropped, as were restrictions on the President's freedom to dispatch U.S. troops under UN command. The Administration will be cheered by these concessions. Meanwhile, also on the defense front, some liberals have started once again casting their eye on the defense budget as a place to raid for funds for domestic programs. It won't fly. This year's defense appropriation (already signed into law) puts spending at about $265 billion. That's 40 per cent below the 1985 level in real terms, and a little over 3 per cent of GDP -- lower than at any time since before Pearl Harbor. We've cut enough.

<p><li>The uproar over the World Trade Organization's ruling against the United States for differential pricing is embarrassing. If ever they ruled against us motivated by reasoning manifestly tendentious, then that would be the time to tell the court -- and, for that matter, GATT -- to go to hell. But when you join in a conference to set the speed limit and proceed to exceed that limit, you should expect to be stopped, and should be stopped. The principal beneficiary of free trade is the American people, and it is for that reason that Congress and Presidents Reagan, Bush, and Clinton entered into a convenant whose executive arm should have no alternative than to rule on the facts, which the court did.

<p><li>Secretary of State Warren Christopher mentioned in passing in a Harvard speech on January 18 that admission of the Central European democracies into NATO would proceed ``on a roughly parallel track'' with their entry into the European Union. But linking the NATO and EU timetables for admitting new members only slows down the NATO process, since the EU, at its December meeting in Madrid, put off the beginning of any such membership talks until 1998 at the earliest. This is another sop to Russia and another slap in the face for the Central Europeans.

<p><li>Disturbing evidence continues to surface of discrimination on Death Row. Guinevere A. Garcia, an inmate in Illinois, made news by publicly pleading to be put to death. (Gov. Edgar ultimately commuted her sentence.) As Professor Victor Streib told the New York Times, ``We've sentenced 112 women to death since 1973 and only executed one. . . . It was nearly a joke in the business that for a woman to get executed she would have to volunteer, and that's what's happening now.'' If there is any merit in the call for more executions of white men to bring that statistic in line with the figure for black men, then there should be many, many more executions of women, black and white. America executes thirty or forty people a year, all men. If enough women to make up the difference can't be found languishing on Death Row, the obvious solution is to extend the death penalty to lesser offenses than murder. Since women don't commit rape very often, we'd be willing to consider littering, driving too slowly on the freeway, and eating peanuts from supermarket bins without paying for them as new capital crimes. Let Justice reign and flourish through the land, nor youth, nor charms divert her iron hand.

<p><li>A social-service inspector in England has acted, censuring a vicar who operates a day-care center. His offense? There are no black dolls for the kiddies. They do have one or two yellow dolls, who represent the Sino-Japanese community. But even though there are no black children in this center, the inspector reminded the vicar, there are black children elsewhere, and so this affront to multiculture must cease. And then there was the church ceremony in Coventry intended to honor the automobile. An 1897 Daimler sputtered its way down the aisle, but its exhaust nearly asphyxiated the congregation. They recovered, only to succumb again when a young woman stripped naked, a la Lady Godiva, the better to make her point, which was a naked protest against the ravages of the motor car. The madness is not entirely domestic.

<p><li>Heard from the Greens: Now that two of the last three winters have proved colder, icier, and snowier than any others in the last half-century, there can no longer be any doubt about the reality of global warming.

<p><li>What did Hillary know, and when did she shred it?

<h2>THE WAR ON DRUGS IS LOST</h2>
<hr></center>
<P>



The following is an excerpt from a symposium that appears in the Febuary 12th issue of the magazine
 
<p>
<p>NATIONAL REVIEW has attempted during its tenure as, so to speak, keeper of the conservative tablets to analyze public problems and to recommend intelligent thought. The magazine has acknowledged a variety of positions by right-minded thinkers and analysts who sometimes reach conflicting conclusions about public policy. As recently as on the question of troops to Bosnia, there was dissent within the family from our corporate conclusion that we'd be best off staying home.
<p>For many years we have published analyses of the drug problem. An important and frequently cited essay by Professor Michael Gazzaniga (Feb. 5, 1990) brought a scientist's discipline into the picture, shedding light on matters vital to an understanding of the drug question. He wrote, for instance, about different rates of addiction, and about ambient pressures that bear on addiction. Elsewhere, Professor James Q. Wilson, now of UCLA, has written eloquently in defense of the drug war. Milton Friedman from the beginning said it would not work, and would do damage.
<p>We have found Dr. Gazzaniga and others who have written on the subject persuasive in arguing that the weight of the evidence is against the current attempt to prohibit drugs. But NATIONAL REVIEW has not, until now, opined formally on the subject. We do so at this point. To put off a declarative judgment would be morally and intellectually weak-kneed.
<p>Things being as they are, and people as they are, there is no way to prevent somebody, somewhere, from concluding that ``NATIONAL REVIEW favors drugs.'' We don't; we deplore their use; we urge the stiffest feasible sentences against anyone convicted of selling a drug to a minor. But that said, it is our judgment that the war on drugs has failed, that it is diverting intelligent energy away from how to deal with the problem of addiction, that it is wasting our resources, and that it is encouraging civil, judicial, and penal procedures associated with police states. We all agree on movement toward legalization, even though we may differ on just how far.
<p>We are joined in our judgment by Ethan A. Nadelmann, a scholar and researcher; Kurt Schmoke, a mayor and former prosecutor; Joseph D. McNamara, a former police chief; Robert W. Sweet, a federal judge and former prosecutor; Thomas Szasz, a psychiatrist; and Steven B. Duke, a law professor. Each has his own emphases, as one might expect. All agree that the celebrated war has failed, and that it is time to go home, and to mobilize fresh thought on the drug problem in the context of a free society. This symposium is our contribution to such thought.
<p>  -- THE EDITORS

**********************************************

<H3>1. Wm. F. Buckley Jr.</h3>
<p><i>Last summer WFB was asked by the New York Bar Association to make a statement to the panel of lawyers considering the drug question. He made the following statement:
</i>
<p>WE ARE speaking of a plague that consumes an estimated $75 billion per year of public money, exacts an estimated $70 billion a year from consumers, is responsible for nearly 50 per cent of the million Americans who are today in jail, occupies an estimated 50 per cent of the trial time of our judiciary, and takes the time of 400,000 policemen -- yet a plague for which no cure is at hand, nor in prospect.
<p>Perhaps you, ladies and gentlemen of the Bar, will understand it if I chronicle my own itinerary on the subject of drugs and public policy. When I ran for mayor of New York, the political race was jocular, but the thought given to municipal problems was entirely serious, and in my paper on drugs and in my post-election book I advocated their continued embargo, but on unusual grounds. I had read -- and I think the evidence continues to affirm it -- that drug-taking is a gregarious activity. What this means, I said, is that an addict is in pursuit of company and therefore attempts to entice others to share with him his habit. Under the circumstances, I said, it can reasonably be held that drug-taking is a contagious disease and, accordingly, subject to the conventional restrictions employed to shield the innocent from Typhoid Mary. Some sport was made of my position by libertarians, including Professor Milton Friedman, who asked whether the police might legitimately be summoned if it were established that keeping company with me was a contagious activity.
<p>I recall all of this in search of philosophical perspective. Back in 1965 I sought to pay conventional deference to libertarian presumptions against outlawing any activity potentially harmful only to the person who engages in that activity. I cited John Stuart Mill and, while at it, opined that there was no warrant for requiring motorcyclists to wear a helmet. I was seeking, and I thought I had found, a reason to override the presumption against intercession by the state.
<p>About ten years later, I deferred to a different allegiance, this one not the presumptive opposition to state intervention, but a different order of priorities. A conservative should evaluate the practicality of a legal constriction, as for instance in those states whose statute books continue to outlaw sodomy, which interdiction is unenforceable, making the law nothing more than print-on-paper. I came to the conclusion that the so-called war against drugs was not working, that it would not work absent a change in the structure of the civil rights to which we are accustomed and to which we cling as a valuable part of our patrimony. And that therefore if that war against drugs is not working, we should look into what effects the war has, a canvass of the casualties consequent on its failure to work. That consideration encouraged me to weigh utilitarian principles: the Benthamite calculus of pain and pleasure introduced by the illegalization of drugs.A YEAR or so ago I thought to calculate a ratio, however roughly arrived at, toward the elaboration of which I would need to place a dollar figure on deprivations that do not lend themselves to quantification. Yet the law, lacking any other recourse, every day countenances such quantifications, as when asking a jury to put a dollar figure on the damage done by the loss of a plaintiff's right arm, amputated by defective machinery at the factory. My enterprise became allegorical in character -- I couldn't do the arithmetic -- but the model, I think, proves useful in sharpening perspectives.
<p>Professor Steven Duke of Yale Law School, in his valuable book, America's Longest War: Rethinking Our Tragic Crusade against Drugs, and scholarly essay, ``Drug Prohibition: An Unnatural Disaster,'' reminds us that it isn't the use of illegal drugs that we have any business complaining about, it is the abuse of such drugs. It is acknowledged that tens of millions of Americans (I have seen the figure 85 million) have at one time or another consumed, or exposed themselves to, an illegal drug. But the estimate authorized by the federal agency charged with such explorations is that there are not more than 1 million regular cocaine users, defined as those who have used the drug at least once in the preceding week. There are (again, an informed estimate) 5 million Americans who regularly use marijuana; and again, an estimated 70 million who once upon a time, or even twice upon a time, inhaled marijuana. From the above we reasonably deduce that Americans who abuse a drug, here defined as Americans who become addicted to it or even habituated to it, are a very small percentage of those who have experimented with a drug, or who continue to use a drug without any observable distraction in their lives or careers. About such users one might say that they are the equivalent of those Americans who drink liquor but do not become alcoholics, or those Americans who smoke cigarettes but do not suffer a shortened lifespan as a result.
<p>Curiosity naturally flows to ask, next, How many users of illegal drugs in fact die from the use of them? The answer is complicated in part because marijuana finds itself lumped together with cocaine and heroin, and nobody has ever been found dead from marijuana. The question of deaths from cocaine is complicated by the factor of impurity. It would not be useful to draw any conclusions about alcohol consumption, for instance, by observing that, in 1931, one thousand Americans died from alcohol consumption if it happened that half of those deaths, or more than half, were the result of drinking alcohol with toxic ingredients extrinsic to the drug as conventionally used. When alcohol was illegal, the consumer could never know whether he had been given relatively harmless alcohol to drink -- such alcoholic beverages as we find today in the liquor store -- or whether the bootlegger had come up with paralyzing rotgut. By the same token, purchasers of illegal cocaine and heroin cannot know whether they are consuming a drug that would qualify for regulated consumption after clinical analysis.
<p>But we do know this, and I approach the nexus of my inquiry, which is that more people die every year as a result of the war against drugs than die from what we call, generically, overdosing. These fatalities include, perhaps most prominently, drug merchants who compete for commercial territory, but include also people who are robbed and killed by those desperate for money to buy the drug to which they have become addicted.
<p>This is perhaps the moment to note that the pharmaceutical cost of cocaine and heroin is approximately 2 per cent of the street price of those drugs. Since a cocaine addict can spend as much as $1,000 per week to sustain his habit, he would need to come up with that $1,000. The approximate fencing cost of stolen goods is 80 per cent, so that to come up with $1,000 can require stealing $5,000 worth of jewels, cars, whatever. We can see that at free-market rates, $20 per week would provide the addict with the cocaine which, in this wartime drug situation, requires of him $1,000.
<p>My mind turned, then, to auxiliary expenses -- auxiliary pains, if you wish. The crime rate, whatever one made of its modest curtsy last year toward diminution, continues its secular rise. Serious crime is 480 per cent higher than in 1965. The correlation is not absolute, but it is suggestive: crime is reduced by the number of available enforcers of law and order, namely policemen. The heralded new crime legislation, passed last year and acclaimed by President Clinton, provides for 100,000 extra policemen, even if only for a limited amount of time. But 400,000 policemen would be freed to pursue criminals engaged in activity other than the sale and distribution of drugs if such sale and distribution, at a price at which there was no profit, were to be done by, say, a federal drugstore.
<p>So then we attempt to put a value on the goods stolen by addicts. The figure arrived at by Professor Duke is $10 billion. But we need to add to this pain of stolen property, surely, the extra-material pain suffered by victims of robbers. If someone breaks into your house at night, perhaps holding you at gunpoint while taking your money and your jewelry and whatever, it is reasonable to assign a higher ``cost'' to the episode than the commercial value of the stolen money and jewelry. If we were modest, we might reasonably, however arbitrarily, put at $1,000 the ``value'' of the victim's pain. But then the hurt, the psychological trauma, might be evaluated by a jury at ten times, or one hundred times, that sum.
<p>But we must consider other factors, not readily quantifiable, but no less tangible. Fifty years ago, to walk at night across Central Park was no more adventurous than to walk down Fifth Avenue. But walking across the park is no longer done, save by the kind of people who climb the Matterhorn. Is it fair to put a value on a lost amenity? If the Metropolitan Museum were to close, mightn't we, without fear of distortion, judge that we had been deprived of something valuable? What value might we assign to confidence that, at night, one can sleep without fear of intrusion by criminals seeking money or goods exchangeable for drugs?
<p>Pursuing utilitarian analysis, we ask: What are the relative costs, on the one hand, of medical and psychological treatment for addicts and, on the other, incarceration for drug offenses? It transpires that treatment is seven times more cost-effective. By this is meant that one dollar spent on the treatment of an addict reduces the probability of continued addiction seven times more than one dollar spent on incarceration. Looked at another way: Treatment is not now available for almost half of those who would benefit from it. Yet we are willing to build more and more jails in which to isolate drug users even though at one-seventh the cost of building and maintaining jail space and pursuing, detaining, and prosecuting the drug user, we could subsidize commensurately effective medical care and psychological treatment.I HAVE spared you, even as I spared myself, an arithmetical consummation of my inquiry, but the data here cited instruct us that the cost of the drug war is many times more painful, in all its manifestations, than would be the licensing of drugs combined with intensive education of non-users and intensive education designed to warn those who experiment with drugs. We have seen a substantial reduction in the use of tobacco over the last thirty years, and this is not because tobacco became illegal but because a sentient community began, in substantial numbers, to apprehend the high cost of tobacco to human health, even as, we can assume, a growing number of Americans desist from practicing unsafe sex and using polluted needles in this age of AIDS. If 80 million Americans can experiment with drugs and resist addiction using information publicly available, we can reasonably hope that approximately the same number would resist the temptation to purchase such drugs even if they were available at a federal drugstore at the mere cost of production.
<p>And added to the above is the point of civil justice. Those who suffer from the abuse of drugs have themselves to blame for it. This does not mean that society is absolved from active concern for their plight. It does mean that their plight is subordinate to the plight of those citizens who do not experiment with drugs but whose life, liberty, and property are substantially affected by the illegalization of the drugs sought after by the minority.
<p>I have not spoken of the cost to our society of the astonishing legal weapons available now to policemen and prosecutors; of the penalty of forfeiture of one's home and property for violation of laws which, though designed to advance the war against drugs, could legally be used -- I am told by learned counsel -- as penalties for the neglect of one's pets. I leave it at this, that it is outrageous to live in a society whose laws tolerate sending young people to life in prison because they grew, or distributed, a dozen ounces of marijuana. I would hope that the good offices of your vital profession would mobilize at least to protest such excesses of wartime zeal, the legal equivalent of a My Lai massacre. And perhaps proceed to recommend the legalization of the sale of most drugs, except to minors.

Well, Tipper was right again! She told me this morning that if I cleaned out the basement, I'd be surprised by what turned up. So down I went with a box and a mess of recyclable trash bags and a reluctant Al Jr. And boy! do we Gores have a messy basement!
<P>But since it's snowing like the dickens out and since Al Jr.'s soccer game (St. Alban's vs. Calvert) was called off due to snowdrifts five feet high (the tallest kid on Al's team is 4'11"), the Gore men weren't that unhappy to do some early spring cleaning.
<P>We found the usual basement stuff: solar hats, earth brick molds, planetary communication panels, that kind of thing. But behind a box of copies of Earth in the Balance, we found a box of notes that look like they could belong to you -- they're handwritten, and written in some form of scientific notation, I think; at least, I can't make heads or tails out of it:
<P>2/23/93
<br>HRC -- v. upst. Scrmng. Rd fcd. Snrlng. Thrwng lmp @ potus.

<p>Does any of that make sense to you? It looks to me like some kind of complicated photosynthesis thing.
<p>We also found a stack of computer printouts. Here's one of them.
<br>RSE LW FRM -- BILLING/PROJECT CODE/HRS
<br>HRC -- WhtWtr/CstlGrnd/McDgl/et al -- 110 hrs @ $350

<p>These go on and on. Stacks and stacks of them. Could they be the baby-sitting ledger for one of the girls?
<p>And then we found some more handwritten notes.

<p>Does any of that make sense to you, Rusty? Could it be something the Quayles forgot to take?
<p>The strange thing is, I was just down here a few weeks ago and I didn't notice all of this junk cluttering the place up. And when Tipper ordered me to clean up the basement, it was like she knew that all of these boxes and papers were here, even though as far as I know, she hasn't been down here for ages. 
<p>``What's down there, Tip?'' I asked.
<p>``Our last hope,'' she said. You know women, Rusty. It's like they have some kind of sixth sense for housecleaning. 
<p>The next thing that turned up was a computer disk, which Al Jr. happily ``hacked'' his way into. The screen on his laptop just sprang alive -- numbers and figures zooming by. All I caught was: 
<p>TO: B.C. & H.R.C.
<p>FR: H.Th. & L. B-Th. 
<p>Attached please find profit projections for Air Thomason, Inc. Please initial and route to M. McL. and D. Watkins. 
<p>Then some sort of spreadsheet program began, and the numbers kept getting larger and larger.
<p>And the last scrap of paper -- and this one really might be important -- 
<p>IOU $30,000 for re-election Gov. Ark.
<p>Redeemable in cash or in kind.
<p>I'm tempted to recycle most of this -- we should be encouraging people to e-mail whenever they can, and so if whoever it belongs to comes back looking for it, well, let them learn the hard way.
<p>There was also a giant box of computer diskettes, but I gave them all to Al Jr., who's merrily erasing them so he can use them to save his ``Zoop'' games.
<p>I still haven't decided what to do with all of this paper, though. Maybe I'll ask Tipper to handle it. After all, she's the one who sent me down here in the first place. She'll know what to do with
it.

Forbes's Rich Problem
<p>
NEW YORK, JANUARY 16
<p>Steve Forbes's campaign is revealing, challenging, and amusing. The sheer improbability, last 
November, that he would get anywhere tended to interdict any other consideration of his candidacy,
 yet here he is, running second in various states. In the debate in Iowa on Saturday the other 
candidates all consolidated as a Get Forbes posse. He escaped, but bruises landed, inflicted by 
fellow Republicans, of course, and, in many cases, fellow conservatives. 
<p>He has split the 
conservative vote, and, accordingly, Senator Gramm went after him lustily. This was in part a 
professional obligation (there is no way Phil Gramm can stop Dole and share affections with Steve 
Forbes) and in part personal (Senator Gramm is smarting from Forbes's ads).
<p>Forbes has of course 
been baiting Gramm in a television and radio campaign that has suffused Iowa with Forbes's agenda. 
His complaint is that Gramm's insistence on a reduction in government expenses pays insufficient 
heed to the possibilities that open up under a return to supply-side policies. Gramm counters that 
you can't have effective tax relief without asphyxiative government policies that would hugely 
reduce government expenditures. Without exactly saying so, Forbes resists this, preferring to 
cite the prodigality of growth when the yokes are removed from the taxpayers' necks. 
It is a nice quarrel, and conservatives tend to hope that both sides will win.
<p> Now the special vulnerabilities of Forbes on the larger political scene are 
difficult for such as Phil Gramm and Pat Buchanan and indeed Lamar Alexander to 
cope with. His company has a private airplane blissfully named Capitalist Tool. 
And his company has a gorgeous big yacht, which will take you around the world, 
if you press the right button. Now the Internal Revenue Service, over the years, has 
examined the expense accounts of these two amenities with ferocious attention, but the 
records absolutely establish a business purpose in maintaining them. The primary weight 
of their expense rests on the shoulders of the stockholders, who are the Forbes family. 
<p>There is that, plus also the general political disability of disposing of great wealth. 
The public doesn't find this disqualifying -- FDR was relatively rich -- and anyway, right-wing 
inclinations do not go in lockstep with wealth. (Bill Gates voted for Clinton.) In 1958 there were 
three contenders for statewide office in New York. Averell Harriman was standard-bearer of the left
 wing of the Democratic Party; challenger Nelson Rockefeller was standard-bearer of the left wing 
of the Republican Party; Corliss Lamont was, pure and simple, a Communist fellow-traveler running
 on a socialist ticket. All three gentlemen were heirs to great fortunes. 
<p>So that the Republican
 public, in a Republican primary, is not going to be frightened off by the documentation of Steve 
Forbes's wealth. It is a slightly different matter that he has put that wealth entirely at the 
disposal of his campaign. That understandably irritates those poor souls who have to spend half 
of every day collecting nickels and dimes from house to house; but there is no indication that the 
public is put off on the matter, although there may be a considerable difference between the cited 
popularity of Steve Forbes and the number of people who will actually turn up to vote for him. 
<p>His primary problem has to do with the widespread belief that a flat tax would hurt the middle 
class, specifically, those who earn between $70,000 and $200,000. Forbes acknowledges that for the 
first year, perhaps two years, taxing families with incomes over $36,000 at 17 per cent, 
disallowing deductions, and immunizing dividend and estate income would mean a deficit, but 
one which, he vows, would soon disappear under the promptings of an invigorated marketplace. 
But of course the first thing done by the other candidates and their accomplices was to try to 
figure out how much less this would hypothetically cost Steve Forbes personally, compared with 
what they figure out he paid last year. 
<p>The estimated saving is substantial. Forbes was 
justifiably inflamed at the preposterous suggestion that someone is going to run for President of 
the United States in order to spur on a tax reform that will save the new President money on his 
income tax. The gentle Steve Forbes waxed wroth on the point and retorted that he will have spent 
twenty times the hypothetical saving on his presidential campaign. A rather convincing point: It 
doesn't really make sense to spend $20 million in a campaign in order prospectively to diminish 
one's tax payments by about $200,000. Some will remember the character in the Hollywood movie 
whom the all-powerful, manipulative gang offered either of two alternative posts: Commissioner 
of Baseball, or President of the United States. William Powell paused, twitched his moustache, 
then said, ``Which pays more?'' 
<p>Mr. Forbes isn't playing a political part, isn't going to be 
President, but he has done an endearing thing.

<h2>The Week</h2>

<P>


<p>

Severe weather last week forced the cancellation of thousands of flights, most of them Hazel O'Leary's.

Even the arcane election laws of New York State have not prevented Steve Forbes and Pat Buchanan from collecting enough petition signatures to get on the presidential primary ballot. Provided they surmount one last hurdle: the efforts of the state party machine, which backs Bob Dole, to disqualify them. New York's laws give gimlet-eyed regulars so many opportunities to challenge signatures that petitioners are advised to collect twice as many as the already extravagantly high legal requirement. Dole knows these rules well, for they were used to keep him out of the New York primary in 1988, when the Bush forces ran the state GOP. But this is playground justice, not justice. New York Republicans should be able to vote their preference. And wouldn't it be fun to watch Forbes and Buchanan returning each other's serves in a New York match-up? (Dole could take the role of the net.)


<p>
<li>


After a few weeks of ``crisis'' and media interviews of whining federal workers suffering speakably on paid leave, someone started the whole thing up again, and the next thing you know, you get your Form 1040 in the mail.



<p>
<li>

Just as Nixon has Oliver Stone, so Pat Buchanan, Nixon's old speechwriter, has Charles Lane, whose profile of Mr. Buchanan (``Daddy's Boy'') ornaments a recent issue of The New Republic. Lane finds the source of Buchanan's pathologies in his twisted family roots: Catholic dad, Franco-lover, walloped his kids, etc., etc. As it happens, the worst that can be said about Buchanan's brawling youth was said by Buchanan himself, with candor and charm, in his memoir, Right from the Beginning. So Lane has to reach further, exhuming old quarrels with neighbors and trotting out that classic of politics masquerading as science, Theodor Adorno's The Authoritarian Personality. In the authoritarian personality, Lane quotes, ``there is no place for ambivalence or ambiguities.'' That's Pat! But then, five pages later, when Lane asks Buchanan about some of the liberal policies he had to swallow working for the Nixon White House, such as the opening to China, Buchanan says, ``You know, I'm ambivalent about that.'' Lane doesn't take the hint (he lacks Stone's empathy) but maybe there are sparks of goodness in Buchanan after all.

<p>
<li>



The White House announced that President Clinton was considering putting himself out of work for the shutdown and taking no pay, to show his sympathy for furloughed federal workers. Then some whiz must have noticed that this would have put the President in the ``non-essential worker'' category. The story quickly and quietly disappeared.



<p>
<li>

Perhaps Bill Clinton is running for re-election because he must, says Mark R. Levin of Landmark Legal Foundation. Levin reminds us that Mr. Clinton is the first President to claim attorney - client privilege, which he did in hopes of preventing congressional investigators from learning about his Whitewater activities. He is the first President to assert executive privilege against himself, which occurred when his own deputy attorney general was stopped by his own White House counsel from examining the late Vincent Foster's files. He is the first President to receive legal aid from the taxpayers by using government lawyers for his personal legal matters, a practice previous Presidents considered unlawful. And Mr. Clinton is the only President to demand absolute immunity from all civil lawsuits -- even where the suit involves matters alleged to have occurred prior to his election to the Presidency -- which is intended to prevent a trial on charges that he sexually molested a former Arkansas state employee. If Clinton loses the Presidency, he may actually have to account for his personal behavior.



<p>
<li>

Our friend Bill Kristol, after talking up Newt Gingrich and Colin Powell as presidential candidates, has recently been seen dallying with Lamar Alexander. With a record like that, if Bob Dole does get elected, Kristol will be forced to move to Bermuda come January 1997. On the other hand, if Dole caves in to Clinton on the budget again, Mr. Kristol will quickly be joined by members of the late Republican majority in Congress.


<p>

When Bob Dole and Newt Gingrich created the Kemp Commission on tax reform, it was widely viewed as a stalking horse for a Dole tax plan. In the end, however, the commission shied away from devising a detailed plan of its own, preferring to outline general principles for tax reform with which all the advocates of competing flat-tax and sales-tax plans could agree. The most important of these was that the ``progressive'' structure of multiple rates be scrapped in favor of a single low rate. The task for Republicans now is not to design an ideal tax system from scratch, but to improve the tax system in a politically achievable way. (The commission has already suggested that the charitable deduction and mortgage-interest deduction may have to stay.) We would urge that long-term political consequences also be kept in mind. Tax reform should not raise taxes on any large class of taxpayers; so tax reform must incorporate a major tax cut. Reform should not make taxes less visible and thus easier to raise -- a substantial defect of some current proposals. And conservatives should be leery of taking millions of Americans off the income-tax rolls, as both the Armey and Forbes plans do, lest citizens come to believe that they can enjoy Big Government for free.

The new 1040s have been mailed, yet there are still 97,000 people who haven't received a refund check for last year's IRS overcharges.

Some time ago, North Miami passed a law, upheld by a Florida state court, disallowing applications for city jobs  from anyone who had smoked in the past year. A 52-year-old typist, Arlene Kurtz, challenged the ruling, but the Supreme Court has now declared that it was rational for North Miami to discriminate against her, because smokers get sick more often than non-smokers. Logically, this clears the way for all kinds of ``rational'' discrimination: against gays, because they suffer disproportionately from AIDS; against skiers, because they break their legs more often than non-skiers; against lovers of junk food, because a healthier diet would make them less vulnerable to heart disease; and so on. Of course, the New Class has no ideological interest in attacking skiers and it takes a decidedly protective interest in gays. Smokers, on the other hand, and everyone else who enjoys bodily pleasures deemed medically inadvisable, are very much in the sights of our betters. It's time for Congress to step in. They live pretty carelessly, and what's bad enough for them should be bad enough for the rest of us.

CNN Crossfire co-host Bob Beckel angrily declared that, because of the shutdown, his mother was not going to receive her meals on wheels. Suddenly the devastating effects of the shutdown came home to us. A food basket is on its way to Mrs. Beckel as a token of NR's atonement.

Sam Zhadanov, a 60-year-old inventor and engineer, is serving a five-year sentence in federal prison for making little plastic bottles. His customers told him the containers were for perfume samples. The government said they were crack vials. Feeling he had done nothing wrong, Zhadanov originally insisted on a trial. But under pressure from prosecutors, who threatened to arrest his wife, and on the advice of his attorney, he pleaded guilty. In addition to the prison sentence, Zhadanov has lost almost all of his property to forfeiture. He had never been in trouble with the law before. Yet he was punished more severely than anyone else in the case, including the distributors who hired him to make the bottles and the retailers who sold them to the ultimate users. Although the government said the retail buyers were crack dealers, none of them were arrested, and none of the defendants ever saw any drugs, let alone sold them. Furthermore, in a 1992 case involving crack vials, the courts found that containers did not fall within the federal definition of drug paraphernalia. Zhadanov, who has been in Allenwood Federal Prison Camp for a year, plans a hunger strike on January 18 to call attention to the abuses committed in the name of the war on drugs. ``For much of my life I endured the oppression of the former Soviet Union. Now I am reliving that experience in my new home, where I came in search of justice and liberty.''

Chap in Fort Worth walked into a bank next door to a police station, waited patiently in line wearing a ski mask, ordered the teller to fill a bag with money, politely told her to have a nice day, walked out, and was arrested instantly. Evidently another great mind produced by the public-school system.

<p>
<li>



The great environmental scare of the 1980s was acid rain threatening forests with epidemics of dieback. The Environmental Protection Agency and the Canadian forestry agency looked into the causes of forest dieback, and the results are just coming in. Records of the health of maple and birch forests going back a hundred years show no evidence of increased dieback: ``in fact the successive peak levels [of dieback] decreased slightly over the three most recent episodes.'' The research cites no role for acid rain, and explains episodes of dieback as owing to ``overmaturity'' (scientific jargon, we assume, for ``old age'') and late frosts, which can weaken trees. We expect the EPA to say that the electric companies can scrap all those expensive electrostatic precipitators they were forced to install on their smokestacks to reduce sulphur-dioxide emissions. And to announce that electric bills will drop 20 per cent.

<p>
Rich and Spoiler
<p>
Steve Forbes's optimistic message
is resonating with voters. But does
Forbes really have a chance?
<p>
RICH LOWRY
<p>
Mr. Lowry is NR's national political reporter.
<p>


<p>STEVE Forbes's campaign manager, Bill Dal Col, volunteers an answer to a question a reporter asks of his candidate: What has Forbes learned about campaigning since launching his long-shot presidential bid? ``That at least you're pretty good at it,'' says Dal Col, smiling, glancing admiringly at his boss. Forbes, making a late-December campaign swing through Iowa, is tucked into the back of a chartered jet in awkward proximity with two reporters and two members of his campaign staff, trying to steal glances at the day's Wall Street Journal. He laughs at the boastful comment with an almost boyish embarrassment, then gestures Dal Col's way with a typically laconic rejoinder: ``Spinmeister, here.''
<p>If the cliche of 1990s politics is that ``anything can happen,'' this is anything: a diffident multi-millionaire magazine publisher with no elective experience, no knack for small-talk or back-slapping, seemingly no traditional political skills at all, rocking the race for the Republican presidential nomination. Thanks to a TV advertising blitz that has already cost an estimated $12 million and made him a minor celebrity among blue-haired old ladies in places like Sioux City, Iowa, Forbes is running second in polls in Iowa and New Hampshire and is first, according to one recent survey, in Arizona. He may be the candidate of the ``air war,'' but Forbes threatens to cause major disruption on the ground -- for the candidates still looking to get a clean shot at Bob Dole, and even for the front-runner himself.
<p>The Forbes campaign is 1980s supply-side faith given a 1990s torque. Its roots are in the collapse of the supply-side message within a GOP that has made Ross Perot's obsession with the deficit its own; in the slow political deterioration of supply-side champion Jack Kemp, who has failed to stay at the cutting edge of the party; and in the search of supply-side guru Jude Wanniski, among others, for a presidential candidate to fill the resulting message and leadership vacuums. But the campaign also owes a debt to Perot populism -- in its anti-Washington, pro-term-limit rhetoric -- and, oddly enough, to the hard-ball political tactics of Sen. Jesse Helms. So, at the same time Forbes runs on Reagan optimism, he flirts with an opportunistic, ``outsider'' populism at odds with the idea-driven rationale for his candidacy.
<p>Steve Forbes, of course, enjoys a head-start in name ID. His grandfather, B. C. Forbes, began Forbes magazine in 1917 as a feisty chronicle of the ``doers and doings'' of American business. When his son Malcolm took over in 1964, he embarked on a frenetic campaign of promotion of the magazine -- as a ``capitalist tool'' -- and of himself that swelled the magazine's circulation and profit margins. By the 1970s, Malcolm was the world-conquering capitalist, famous for his collection of Faberge eggs, his motorcycling, and extravagant parties. Steve joined the magazine shortly after graduation from Princeton. He started as a reporter, worked his way up through the ranks and already had a large hand in running Forbes by the time of his father's death in 1990. 
<p>Steve's first full-contact political experience was as chairman of the Board of International Broadcasting, which oversaw Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty, in the Reagan and Bush Administrations. By all accounts he was an able BIB chairman, engaged on the substantive questions before him and tenacious in protecting the interests of the ``radios'' on Capitol Hill. In 1993, along with then - Wall Street economist Larry Kudlow, Forbes developed the 30 per cent, across-the-board tax cut proposal that became the centerpiece of his friend Christy Todd Whitman's successful New Jersey gubernatorial campaign. Around the same time, Forbes became chairman of the board of the listless Jack Kemp/Bill Bennett organization, Empower America.
<p>Part of Empower's trouble was that it was perceived as a mere holding pen for Kemp until he ran in 1996. As 1995 progressed, it became clear that Kemp  wouldn't be running, and supply-siders began looking for another horse to back. Jude Wanniski, the brilliant if eccentric supply-side guru, had been engaged in an unlikely dalliance with Bob Dole that he abruptly cut off in early March. Within days he was faxing Forbes (one of a number of Wanniski's unlikely presidential possibilities, including first-term Utah Senator Bob Bennett) a several-thousand-word memo on why he should run. ``Several hours later,'' recalls Wanniski, ``the phone rang and it was Steve. And he said, 'Wow, this memo knocked me out.''' Forbes would soon decide that there was a growth, supply-side vacuum in the race, and that he was the man to fill it.
<p>
<p>The shy Forbes appears the unlikeliest of politicians. At a late-December meet-and-greet at a restaurant in Council Bluffs, Iowa, Forbes stood away from the doors, his hands awkwardly at his sides, as dozens of locals filed in for a chicken sandwich and stump speech. With those voters who ventured over to him he shook hands in his distinctive style -- arm out stiffly, head bowed as if he's looking at his interlocutor's Adam's apple. Standing three feet from him its impossible to hear Forbes's words, he's so soft-spoken, except for the occasional, ``Oh, goodness!'' But he laughs often, tucking in his chin like a Citadel cadet, grinning wide with all his teeth. With his thick eyeglasses and soft manner, the impression is of Clark Kent, pulled from his desk at the Daily Planet, forced to do public relations.
<p>The Forbes stump speech can be just as awkward. He delivers it from memory, but in the same halting cadences as if it were being read. Despite it all, Forbes elicits warm reactions from crowds, who not only like his themes but take a shine to his naked genuineness. The speech has almost no applause lines except his prescription for the current tax code: ``Scrap it, kill it, drive a stake through its heart, bury it, and hope it never rises again.'' But at a restaurant in Sioux City, jammed with two hundred Iowans one recent Friday night, people clapped almost every time Forbes stopped to take a breath, even after he called for a radical overhaul of Social Security.
<p>The key to the Forbes campaign is that it has a split personality; the good-willed awkwardness of Forbes the person is combined with the relentless ferocity of Forbes the campaign ad. Free from the state-by-state spending restraints that limit other candidates, Forbes has blanketed Iowa, Arizona, and New Hampshire with his spots. Some are biographical, others pegged to the flat tax, still others ruthlessly critical of his opponents, especially Bob Dole. One attacked Dole for delaying a term-limits vote in the Senate, neglecting to mention that Dole did so at the behest of term-limits supporters. A shameless cheap shot. The latest are cut from the same cloth, hitting Dole for supporting the construction of the Senate subway and funding for an Idaho ski project -- minutiae pulled from larger bills with no particular connection to Dole.
<p>The ads are almost certainly the fruit of Forbes's early decision to make a battle-tested group of North Carolina operatives, instead of Jude Wanniski, central to his campaign. Explains one insider: ``Jude basically tried to bring in John Sears to resurrect the old Reagan campaign of '79 and early '80, this time with Jude as the Svengali of policy. And Forbes wouldn't have any of it -- thankfully.'' Forbes turned instead to the tag team that ran Jesse Helms's campaigns until a bitter recent split with the senator, Carter Wrenn (who is on the Forbes payroll) and Tom Ellis (who is an informal ``kibitzer''). The hallmark of the two are media-intense, hard-hitting, through-the-roof-expensive campaigns.  In the deep-pocketed Forbes, says one North Carolina insider, ``they got the dream candidate.''
<p>The chief issue they will help Forbes sell is, of course, the flat tax. Under his plan, personal exemptions would keep a family of four that makes up to $36,000 a year from paying any taxes at all. All income after that would be taxed at a 17 per cent rate. There would be no deductions and no tax on interest, dividends, or capital gains -- just on labor income. The benefits from rationalizing the system, reducing marginal rates, and eliminating the double taxation of savings and investment would be considerable. And, sure enough, part of the Forbes sales pitch is pure Jack Kemp optimism, a paean to economic forces unleashed. But Forbes also talks, like Pat Buchanan, of families sweating it out on the ``treadmill.'' And there are whiffs of another flat-taxer, maverick Democrat Jerry Brown, in his attacks on the current code as ``the principal source of political corruption in Washington.''
<p>It makes for a potent mix. But, upon closer examination, the politics get trickier. The dirty secret of the flat tax is that it threatens to raise taxes on the middle class, drop lower-income people off the rolls, lower the tax burden on upper-income taxpayers, and exclude capital income, disproportionately enjoyed by the rich, from taxation entirely and someone, i.e., the middle class, will have to pick up the slack (and give up their home-mortgage deductions to boot). It's a deadly political shortcoming. Forbes tries to avoid it by promising a flat tax that is a tax cut. His 17 per cent rate would, by his campaign's estimate, lose $40 billion its first year (by some estimates it would lose as much $200 billion). Forbes dismisses these figures because he argues that lower tax rates will lead to greater growth and, hence, more revenues.
<p>But again politics intrude. After a grueling year-long fight, are Republicans really ready to say all their Congressional Budget Office economic assumptions are irrelevant and the ``glide-path'' to the balanced budget of secondary importance? Perhaps they should be. But the deficit has become a crucial political proxy for shrinking the size of government. Without it, making the case for getting ``savings'' from entitlement programs like Medicare or paring back discretionary spending becomes that much more difficult. Forbes gives no indication of having the stomach for the fight. On the stump he offers up one specific agency for total elimination: the Federal Communications Commission. Forbes exudes the naive 1980s supply-side faith that it's not the size of government per se but marginal tax rates that pose the biggest threat to the economy and to the culture. 
<p>Indeed, for Forbes the flat tax is more than an economic elixir. It stands in for most of the rest of his policy. ``Contrary to what some people would have you believe,'' he says on the stump, ``in America there really is no difference between values and economics. They are one and the same.'' Forbes then evokes thrift, hard work, trust, etc. -- and within limits he has a point. But it's not always clear he knows the limits. In his announcement speech Forbes promised that the flat tax and his other economic idee fixe, the gold standard, would lead to ``a renaissance the like of which has never been seen before. Families would step off the tax treadmill; wage earners could relax a little, save more easily; parents would have more time to spend with their children and each other; they would have more time to devote to where it belongs -- to the home and hearth, where all true value lies.''
<p>For this vision, ``optimistic'' is not the word. It is tinged with a kind of economic determinism and a faith in human nature that offends against the deepest wellsprings of traditional conservatism. In the world of Steve Forbes, entrepreneurs busily advance their ambitions in a kind of perfect social harmony, responding to the positive incentives of a free economy. Harold Johnson of the Orange County Register refers to it as ``possibility thinking,'' the sunniness popularized by Californians like Kemp and supply-side pioneer Arthur Laffer. Traditionally conservatism takes a darker view of the human potential for vice and folly, and prescribes a certain amount of negative incentive, whether through social ostracism or the force of law, to keep it in check. It is this element that is missing from the Forbes world-view and is reflected, on the concrete level, in his unease with parts of the Republican social agenda.
<p>Take abortion. On Roe v. Wade -- bad law, whatever you think of abortion -- Forbes takes the essentially pro-choice dodge that it can't be overturned absent a shift in public opinion. Pro-lifers in his camp hold out hope of moving him rightward on the issue; he recently denounced partial-birth abortion in his ``Fact and Comment'' column in Forbes  and characterizes his position as ``not pro-choice.'' But as of now his position limits his appeal among the social-conservative base of the GOP necessary for any serious challenge to Dole.
<p>The other social issues present a similar problem. The social agenda provides the ``wedge issues'' -- crime, welfare,  immigration -- that allow conservative candidates to appeal to Reagan Democrats. Forbes clearly isn't comfortable talking about them. On immigration, he parts ways with an employee, Forbes senior editor and immigration restrictionist Peter Brimelow. ``I prefer Julian Simon on that issue,'' says Forbes. He has warned of the more hard-edged GOP welfare proposals that ``The American people will not tolerate cutting off benefits for children.'' Forbes tries to make up for his soft social edge with anti-Washington rhetoric; instead of talking about welfare, he runs ads on the Senate subway.
<p>And he has had some success with this tack. Rather than picking up the traditional pro-growth voters (wealthier, better educated), Forbes, according to New Hampshire surveys by the Polling Company, is making inroads among men making less than $40,000 a year and independent voters. The populist appeal of the flat tax and his anti-Washington rhetoric, as well as his indisputable status as an ``outsider,'' account for this seeming anomaly. Meanwhile, in lower taxes and economic growth, Forbes has picked up on an appealing theme inexplicably dropped by the other candidates. All this combined with piles of money -- at least $25 million -- makes the campaign's strategy plausible, if not likely. The idea is to finish respectably in Iowa and New Hampshire, then become a real contender by knocking Dole off somewhere else, perhaps the early primary state of Arizona, where Forbes is spending a mint.
<p>An alternative scenario is not so happy. Forbes is vulnerable to just the sort of cheap populist attacks he himself has been launching. (If the Forbes campaign thinks the Senate subway makes a good image for extravagance, it should just wait till some opponent latches onto the Highlander or Capitalist Tool.) Some of Forbes's advantage dissipates as soon as it becomes clear that the other candidates have already endorsed the principles (if not every politically unpalatable detail) of the flat tax. And Forbes's late jump in organizing will inevitably hurt when it comes time to turn out actual voters, especially in the Iowa caucuses.
<p>All these obstacles suggest that the upper limit for Forbes may be the role of spoiler. He splits the conservative vote three ways with Gramm and Buchanan, and blocks Alexander's emergence as an ``outsider'' alternative to Dole, while perhaps never quite becoming viable himself. Jude Wanniski, always the supply-side optimist, once wrote that ``Insofar elections are honestly conducted, they always turn out right.'' His candidate is about to sorely test the theory.

Rusty
<p>
I understand that you're angry. You have every reason to be. You know and I know that your work down in the Amazonian rainforest is important.
<p>But you have to understand that while I certainly don't consider you ``non-essential,'' the Federal Government does. And, if I may say so, you've got it pretty easy down there; the furloughed non-essential federal employees who live up here can't pay for their groceries with a carton of cigarettes and a Penthouse
magazine.
<p>I'm trying to be sympathetic here, but, as my dad would say, ``Put a little gratitude in that attitude.'' Be thankful that when I re-invented government, I didn't re-invent it so much that we got rid of 350,000 ``non-essential''
personnel.
<p>And, it isn't our fault that those people aren't working. It's the Republicans who keep erecting roadblocks. I mean, we've agreed to balance the budget in seven years.
And we've agreed to cut Medicare. And we've agreed to a per-child rebate. But they keep pushing for a balanced budget in seven years, and Medicare cuts, and a per-child rebate. And so the impasse continues.
<p>And in the third place -- and this is strictly between us -- I mean, let's be honest: most of those federal employees make an average annual salary of $41,500, which by OMB standards, puts them squarely in the category of the ``super mega rich,'' and so in many ways, I say to them what my dad said to me when I complained about the food in Eliot House: ``Cry me a river.''
<p>And in the fourth place, the ``super mega rich'' are all that the Republicans care about, giving them huge tax cuts and corporate handouts. So the ``super mega rich'' and ``non-essential'' federal employees should blame the Republicans for this gridlock, not us, because we care about them, and the Republicans only care about . . .
<p>Wait a sec. I'm getting lost here. Let me check my notes.
<p>Okay. Got it. Back on trac.
<p>Dick Morris has provided all of us with a laminated three-by-five card -- just like Reagan used -- that keeps a lot of these issues straight. Tipper quizzes me on it while driving me to the Brinkley show. It's a pretty clear card:
<p>We're totally against the Republican tax cuts for the rich. But that doesn't mean that we don't think that we raised taxes too much on the rich. It just means that we're totally against the Republican tax cuts for the rich.
<p>And we are absolutely not going to cut welfare. But we are going to end it as we know it. But we are not going to cut it.
<p>And we are going to balance the budget in seven years. But a balanced budget isn't that important. And anyway, we've already balanced it.
<p>Any question?
<p>The only thing that concerns me is that I'm not sure this message will carry us through November. I keep pushing for a ``They'll warm the globe; we'll warm your heart'' type of slogan, but Dick is pretty adamant that we stay ``on message.''
<p>``Dick,'' I asked him the other day, ``are you at all concerned that running against Congress might backfire? Sure, we're ahead in the polls now, but so was Jimmy Carter at this point in 1976 -- and, for that matter, George Bush in 1992. But at some point, we're going to have a budget deal, and people are going to forget about the impasse.''
<p>``That's an awkward question, Mr. Vice President. The short answer to your question is, 'Hey, I've got you guys to about 54% approval, Bob Dole is most probably going to be your opponent -- I mean, what more do you want?' The longer answer to your question is, 'Yes, you've made some interesting points, and I'm sure that when he takes over, Jim Carville will fine-tune the message to a more, shall we say, left-wing frequency.' Rest assured, though, I will never be more than a phone call away.''
<p>For some reason, Rusty, that didn't reassure me. 
<p>I spent a few minutes collecting my thoughts. Then I popped into the Cabinet Room. Bill, Bob Dole, Newt Gingrich, and an assortment of others were embroiled in negotiations. Bill had just conceded a capital-gains tax cut.
<p>``Am I hearing you right, Mr. President?'' Speaker Gingrich asked. ``You're now in favor of a capital-gains tax cut?''
<p>``Absolutely,'' Bill said.
<p>``Well, this is good news,'' Gingrich added
<p>.Bill smiled. ``Just as long as it doesn't involve a capital-gains tax cut.''
<p>``Um . . . '' Gingrich said
<p>.Bill folded up his laminated card, looked up and caught my eye, and gave me a big ``thumbs up.''
<p>Here's hoping you get back to your non-essential work soon, Rusty.

Who Is to Blame?
<p>
NEW YORK, DECEMBER 19
<p>
<p>On the program 60 Minutes, a half-dozen retiring legislators submitted to friendly interrogation inquiring into the reason for their decision to give it all up, go home. Most of their complaints we are familiar with. Unquestionably the most searing is the business about money: Senator Alan Simpson reported that a senator has to raise a minimum of $10,000 every week, which is a heavy load. When you consider 10 thou times 52 times 6 that adds up to over $3 million -- which is only one-third of what retiring Senator Paul Simon had to spend to get back into the Senate. 
<p>Is that situation inherently corrupt? Not a bad question. One senator put it this way. He gets back to his hotel at 10 P.M. after a hard day of electioneering and he has twenty telephone messages, all of them from strangers. But one name he does recognize, because that goodbody had donated $1,000 to the senator's campaign. The senator has the energy left, at that time of night -- after such a day -- to make one phone call, so whom does he call? Right. And even if it happened that the caller's message was, Please vote in favor of Measure X, and the senator goes out and votes against Measure X, it still remains that the only person who got through to him was a Measure X enthusiast, and enthusiasms have a way of communicating themselves, not least when fueled with thousand-dollar bills. Is there a way to stop all that? No, not under our system. It could be changed only by going to a parliamentary system on the British model.
<p>But a less conventional complaint of some of the retiring gentlemen had to do with the under-celebrated art of compromise. People just don't understand, one man put it, that politics is -- you guessed it, the art of compromise. The gentlemen being interviewed were too polite to say it in exactly as many words, but what they were criticizing was the Gingrich House. To use bald figures, one had the impression that if Gingrich would simply give up on tax reform, he'd get substantially what he wanted in the way of tax reform. 
<p>And of course compromise is the civilized approach to most controversies, but the operative word in that sentence is ``most.'' And the entrenched mood of the congressmen who do not wish to compromise with Mr. Clinton is reinforced by the rhetoric used by Mr. Clinton and his satellites. It could be that your call to reduce medical expenses by $270 billion in seven years could be adulterated a little, say to $250 billion in eight years, that kind of thing -- do it, take a deep breath, and sigh resignedly over the rough nature of democratic compromise. 
<p>But to engender receptivity for the compromise mode requires rhetorical adaptation at the other end, and this President Clinton is ostentatiously declining to do. He speaks instead of Republicans wishing to cut medical services for the aged and the indigent, using words appropriate to a situation in which Congress was planning to sequester a million people every year in a huge federal compound and let them die there of starvation and exposure. Slowly. 
<p>Even the most dogged defenders of state welfarism here and there break under the strain. The New Republic's editorialist, remarking on the success Mr. Clinton is having with his phony scare tactics, lays the final blame on the voting public. ``The only people being fundamentally irresponsible in the recent -- and continuing -- budget battle are the American people. They are, to borrow a phrase from our colleague Michael Kinsley, big babies. A year ago, in a realigning election, voters ushered in a Republican Congress that had pledged, in complete candor, to balance the federal budget. In the days before that election, voters backed Republicans over Democrats by a 2.8 per cent margin. Then the Republicans made a fatal error: they tried to deliver on their promise. The result is that in the last few months, the party positions have been completely reversed. The Democrats now lead by 2.4 per cent.'' 
<p>But then whom do you blame for the people's immaturity? The editorialist suggests it is the people themselves who are to blame, for wanting one thing and authorizing another. ``Speaker Gingrich, for all his failings, is the first American politician actually to confront the public with the reality. For that, he gets an approval rating of 27 per cent.'' Any effort to bail out the American people for this act of irresponsibility would have to reason to the people's ignorance for believing what their President has been telling them, six times a day, for the past six weeks. If the voters believe Clinton is correct -- that passage of the Contract with America will result in agony and death for uncounted hundreds of thousands of Americans -- then they are right to say no to Mr. Gingrich. 
<p>And the problem becomes: What to do about demagogues in the White House? Vote them out of office? Yes, but what will inform the voters that that is the thing to do?

Jack Kemp explains that liberal Congressman Tom Campbell (R., Calif.) represents ``what Colin Powell calls the Lincoln wing of the Republican Party.'' Make that the Lincoln Continental wing, Jack.

Yes, the House Ethics Committee essentially cleared Newt Gingrich on all but one of the sixty counts of ethics complaints against him. It's also true that the one outstanding question -- whether tax-exempt foundations violated their tax status by donating to his college course -- involves an eye-glazing technicality. But Republicans are fooling themselves if they think any of this matters. The Speaker suffered a grievous blow when the Ethics Committee agreed to appoint an outside counsel to investigate that last count. Ethics Committee Chairman Nancy Johnson (R., Conn.) apparently didn't realize it, but any other result would have been preferable. In an outside counsel, Democrats get what they've always wanted, a gung-ho investigator who will push to expand his inquiry until he finds the one violation that provides the leverage for forcing Gingrich from office. In this overtly political fight, Republicans must start punching back. First, they should insist that the outside counsel be a tax lawyer rather than a prosecutor willing to become a Grand Inquisitor. Next, the GOP needs to defend the Speaker more generally. Republicans were encouraged when the exquisitely moderate Tom Campbell trounced an anti-Newt candidate in a December 12 special election. But GOP freshmen won't have Campbell's luxury of distancing themselves from the Speaker. Their reputations depend, at least partly, on resisting the Democrats' effort to decapitate the new majority through the sheer force of negative press and ethics smears. This time it's the counter-revolution that mans the guillotine. Republicans must blunt its blade.
<p>
<li>

After speaking non-stop for five hours at a news conference, Rep. Enid Waldholtz (R., Utah) faces a little-known federal charge: impersonating the President.
<p>
<li>

Rep. Ron Wyden won the Democratic nomination to run for Sen. Bob Packwood's seat in Oregon's special election, but the eight-term House veteran hasn't recovered from the humiliation of scoring 0 for 7 in a local TV station's pop quiz. Wyden couldn't find Bosnia on a globe; didn't know the price of a loaf of bread, a gallon of gas, or a gallon of milk; couldn't give the unemployment rate or largest employer in Oregon; and couldn't name Canada's prime minister. Mail-in balloting begins on January 10, and a recent poll has Republican State Sen. Gordon Smith (quiz score: 5 for 7) ahead by 5 points. Poor Wyden -- he was probably looking for Bosnia at the heart of Europe.

Move over, Engler and Weld; George Pataki has joined the club. In his latest budget New York's governor calls for a 25 per cent cut in welfare benefits, a six-month eligibility limit for able-bodied beneficiaries, and a reduction of $1 billion in the state's gold-plated Medicaid program. For the first time in over fifty years spending financed by state and local sources will decline -- if George Pataki has his way. To be sure, his program is unlikely to survive intact, and even if it did, would still leave New York with the highest per-capita state and local spending in the nation. The governor's conservatism is less an epiphany than atonement for mistakes made in his freshman year, when the largest tax cut in state history was offset by a wide array of gimmicks, most of which merely pushed costs into future years. Time may be on Pataki's side, however. After lagging the nation throughout the Cuomo years, New York State added 90,000 new jobs in the last year, catapulting from 50th to 4th in private-sector job creation. Replacing nanny with a job seems like a far more practical proposition today -- even in the nation's premier nanny state.

For all the attention the Western media have paid, the world-wide evangelical Protestant revolution, described in this issue by the distinguished sociologist David Martin, might not be happening at all. Yet as revolutions go, it seems likely to prove of at least equal significance to Islamic fundamentalism and more lasting than Marxism. Other Christians, especially Catholics, will be of two minds about its religious impact since its general tendency is to turn bad Catholics into good Protestants. Even so, its effect on the Roman Catholic and other mainline churches may be ultimately benign. As Professor Martin points out, it provides them with a sharp incentive to reform religious beliefs and practices that have become infected by either a tepid secularism or leftist politics. For the paradox of evangelical Christianity is that by stressing holiness and personal salvation above the ``social gospel,'' it turns this world upside down. It releases people from ancient forms of bondage, both practical and psychological, into hard work, self-reliance, responsibility, love of family, and equality before God. These virtues, preached pre-eminently by John Wesley, redeemed the British working class from the moral squalor of the early Industrial Revolution and, translated to politics, fueled the American Revolution (ruefully described by George III as a revolution of Presbyterians). On the wings of the English language, they are now spreading to every continent. The Western media will notice eventually -- watch for headlines like: ``The Religious Right Goes Global.''

David Rieff writes in The New Yorker that President Clinton ``has probably never before made a decision so fraught with political peril'' as to deploy troops in Bosnia. ``The stakes are enormous -- for the peace of Europe and, if American soldiers start coming home dead, for his own re-election hopes.'' For the soldiers too.

The great regulatory push to ban smoking in bars, airplanes, restaurants, and workplaces is based on studies that purport to show that non-smokers breathing in smokers' smoke are at risk. The most important study came from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which went so far as to claim that three thousand Americans were dying each year from exposure to secondhand tobacco smoke. The 1993 EPA report was subject to widespread criticism by statisticians and epidemiologists, and now the Congressional Research Service has called it junk science: ``the results are not definitive . . . even at the greatest exposure levels the measured risks are still subject to uncertainty . . . very few or even no deaths can be attributed to ETS (environmental tobacco smoke) . . .'' Senator Wendell Ford (D., Ky.) called on federal agencies to reconsider the blanket ban on smoking in public and semi-public places. Fat chance! The PC bureaucrats' rule is: Never let science get in the way of a good regulation.

Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary knows how to travel in style. On a week-long trip to South Africa, she flew in a luxury jet used by Madonna and brought along one hundred people. She has also taken expensive trips, courtesy of the taxpayers, to India, China, and Pakistan. Al Gore came to her defense: ``On these trips, she has created thousands of American jobs and billions of dollars in contracts for companies in this country.'' And that's just counting her entourage.

From the German magazine Der Spiegel: ``Gunther Burpus remained wedged in his front-door cat flap for two days because passersby thought he was a piece of installation art. Mr. Burpus, 41, of Bremen, was using the flap because he had mislaid his keys. Unfortunately, he was spotted by a group of student pranksters who removed his trousers, painted his bottom bright blue, stuck a daffodil between his buttocks, and erected a sign saying: 'Germany Resurgent. An Essay in Street Art. Please Give Generously.' Passersby assumed Mr. Burpus's screams were part of the act, and it was only when an old woman complained to the police that he was finally freed. 'I kept calling for help,' he said, 'but people just said, ``Very good, very clever!'' and threw coins at me.'''

<P>

Dear Rusty,
<p>

<p>Happy Holidays from all of us at the Gore home, and let me just say, right now, things are up in the air. We've got a budget showdown looming, to be honest, and it looks like it's going to be another eye-to-eye staring contest. We were strategizing just this afternoon in the Oval Office. 
<p>``What's our strategy?'' I asked. 
<p>Dick Morris looked up from his pipe. Bill puffed away on his cigar. 
<p>``I'm not following you, Mr. Vice President,'' Dick said.
<p>``You see, Al,'' Bill chimed in, ``Dick thinks -- and I think, too, of course -- that while a budget is nice -- hey, more than nice, a budget is pretty darn useful in many ways -- it's not the be-all-and-end-all.''
<p>``I'm a little confused,'' I said.
<p>``What Dick is saying -- and I agree with him, by the way -- is that sometimes a budget is really good and really helpful by not being written. By not being settled. Do you get me?''
<p>``What the President is saying,'' Dick interjected, puffing on his pipe, ``is that a dog that doesn't bark sometimes saves the house from being robbed.'' 
<p>``So I shouldn't call my friends in the Senate and work the back channels to make a deal?''
<p>``Weeeeelllllll,'' Dick said, ``if you put a gun to my head, I'd say no.''
<p>Bill gazed at me through the thickening smoke. ``You see, Al,'' he said, ``there are deficits and there are deficits. There's the $250-billion budget deficit -- and hoo, boy, that's a big one, no one's saying it isn't -- but there's also a little thing called a 'people deficit'.''
<p>``A 'people deficit'?'' I asked.
<p>``As in, how many people we need to approve of what we're doing versus how many people actually approve of what we're doing,'' Dick said.
<p>``Oh,'' I murmured. 
<p>``And you've got to admit, Al,'' Bill said, tapping the latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, ``that Dick's starting to get at least one of these deficits under control.'' 
<p>I had to admit that, Rusty. As much as I like to think that I'm governed by pure motives, once or twice I've allowed myself to think about the coming campaign -- not '96, you understand, but '00, and '04. And when I hear talk like that from Bill and Dick Morris, well, I get a little concerned. Gore '00 and Gore '04 are going to be a lot easier -- and a lot more fun -- if we can lick this budget thing right now. 
<p>So I left the meeting a little early, just as Bill wasn't returning a phone call from John Kasich. The minute I sat down behind my desk, the phone rang. It was Dad, calling from Carthage, Tennessee. 
<p>``Hi, Dad,'' I said. ``How's the weather down there?'' 
<p>``Cold, I think. Though I'm getting warmer,'' he said, shaking his highball glass next to the receiver. ``Well, all this talk about Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security has got your mother and me a little worried.''
<p>``Worried?''
<p>``You folks up there aren't planning to hang us older folks out to dry, are you?''
<p>``Of course not, Dad,'' I said, with as much emphasis as I could. 
<p>``Glad to hear it. Some of the neighbors are starting to talk -- there's a rumor around town that Medicare premiums are going to go up almost $14 in the next few years.'' 
<p>``Well, they might, Dad. You see, the system is very expensive -- '' 
<p>He interrupted me. ``I know it's expensive, son. You forget: I voted it in! I was in the Senate at the time, Mr. Smartypants, while you were in Harvard Yard, experimenting with prose forms. And we didn't vote the damn thing in so's you guys could cut it off. We voted it in for us! So let us have it!''
<p>``Dad?''
<p>``You know, you've got your Great Aunt Catherine scared to death. She thinks that you guys in Washington are going to take her Medicare and her Social Security away and leave her penniless and begging in the streets.'' 
<p>I tried to soothe him. ``Okay, Dad, I'll call her this afternoon and explain things to her.'' 
<p>``It'll have to be next month,'' Dad replied. ``She's on a Mediterranean cruise until February.'' 
<p>He hung up on me. I was too keyed up to work, so I headed back to the Oval Office. But by the time I got there, it was such a smoke-filled room that I could barely recognize Bill and Dick. 
<p>My secretary just buzzed me -- John Kasich is on line one. Excuse me while I don't take this. 
<p>Happy Holidays, Rusty!

<p>



<p>When Members of Congress finally head home for the holidays they will have ended the busiest legislative session in the last 14 years; both houses convened during 1995 for three months more than last year. How is the show being received? Well, even without thunderous applause for the Act I Contract with America, and despite the intermission in Act II's balanced-budget act, the House Republican leadership is already scripting an encore for its exhausted troupe.
<p>Much depends on whether a deal is reached with President Clinton on the budget. If so, veteran Members and the freshman ingenues alike believe they can look forward to a more measured pace of activity next year. Congressional Republicans will be focusing on implementing the budget provisions. But 1996 being a presidential election year, they will also be timing their debates and floor votes on new issues to cause maximum discomfort for candidate Clinton. Without a budget deal, however, the arguments over Medicare, tax cuts, welfare reform, and Medicaid will remain at the center of congressional politics -- and of the presidential race. Deal or no deal, next year promises to be every bit as contentious as this year has been.
<p>But there will be no second Contract with America. As one leadership aide explains, ``It was easier last year to draw up the Contract because many Members had little interest in it.'' He points out that a second version of the Contract could never accommodate the specific interests of enough Members to win consensus support. Still, Republicans recognize the success of last year's common message and the importance of the ``promises kept'' strategy. So they plan to unveil a joint legislative agenda for their presidential nominee and congressional candidates to run on following their convention in August.
<p>San Diego is nine months away, however. What will the GOP talk about in the meantime? Senator Dole won't be sitting down with his committee chairmen until January to lay out a legislative agenda that promotes issues he views as helpful to his presidential campaign. But the House leadership has sketched out an agenda: on immigration reform, eliminating race and gender preferences, campaign-finance restrictions, an empowerment/community-renewal program for the cities, parental-rights legislation, and banking reform. As well as this fresh agenda, some old issues will be back to cause dissension in the ranks. There will be funding disputes over abortion and Title X, and House conservatives are determined (again!) to see large spending cuts imposed on the National Endowment for the Arts and Legal Services Corporation.
<p>New and old issues alike will provoke tough fights within the Republican caucus. One Hill staffer predicts that Newt Gingrich will regret not having the discipline of this year's Contract to enforce consensus. ``The Contract provided momentum that kept the caucus together, but next year Members will be looking at their individual races and the issues they care about,'' he explains. Still, GOP strategists hope that if these issues provoke some fratricide among Republicans, they can also be framed to threaten regicide at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue.
<p>``This stuff scares Clinton to death,'' declares a House Judiciary Committee staffer about the bill introduced by Rep. Charles Canady (R., Fla.) to eliminate federal race and gender preferences. As proof he points to the Administration's refusal to disclose the results of its review of preference and set-aside programs undertaken following the Supreme Court's Adarand decision holding that such programs are subject to strict scrutiny. Scared or not, however, Mr. Clinton has to fight on this issue; his liberal base will insist. He is therefore expected to begin by laying down a smokescreen of disinformation, claiming (falsely) that he too opposes quotas, and that the Republican bill weakens existing anti-discrimination laws. A donnybrook is likely. But the leadership is committed to the Canady bill and its supporters are confident they can win -- if their colleagues have the stomach for the fight.
<p>Some have ulcers. More timid Republicans, fearful that the race card will be played against them, want the new empowerment/community-renewal package (sponsored by Oklahoma's J. C. Watts and Missouri's Jim Talent) moved first. The Watts - Talent bill, designed with the help of community self-help groups, is expected to include tax and regulatory relief for inner cities, school-choice provisions, and housing reforms. Watts and Talent promote the bill on its merits, recoiling from any connection with the debate over affirmative action. GOP moderates insist they need its cover to help them do the right thing.
<p>The Republican caucus remains divided over legal immigration -- with House Majority Leader Dick Armey strongly opposed to new restrictions. The President, on the other hand, gave an instant welcome to the Jordan Commission's proposals to cut legal immigration. Apparently, he feels Jimmy Carter lost him the Arkansas governorship in 1980 by admitting the Mariel's Cuban immigrants. He doesn't intend to lose himself the White House over immigrants -- and he has already invaded Haiti to prove it.
<p>
<p>That leaves campaign-finance reform, where the impetus comes from the freshman class. Party strategists are less gung-ho, fearing its provisions will damage GOP candidates and that even raising the issue will fuel public cynicism about Congress -- now run by the Republicans. Caring little for such calculations, the freshman class plans a retreat in January to determine next year's priorities. Institutional reforms and the elimination of Cabinet agencies will be top priorities, as will the parental-rights legislation sponsored by their fellow freshman, Steve Largent of Oklahoma.
<p>Many freshmen believe they were thwarted in their attempts to advance proposals this year. They will be less compliant next year. So, God rest ye merry, gentlemen, there'll be little respite in the new year. -- KATE O'BEIRNE

The Pot War In England
<P>

NEW YORK, DECEMBER 8
<P>
<P>A friend abroad writes to ask whether the U.S. press has picked up on the November 11 editorial in The Lancet entitled ``Deglamorising cannabis.'' The answer is: No, not as far as I am aware. And indeed no-news here is very strange news because The Lancet is the pre-eminent medical publication in Britain, something like the New England Journal of Medicine. And the extraordinary last line of the editorial reads, ``Cannabis per se is not a hazard to society but driving it further underground may well be.'' 
<P>Inquiry into the story reveals that a Labour MP, Clare Short, proposed in the House of Commons recently that pot be legalized. As would have been the case if she had made the same proposal in Congress, Miss Short was all but run out of town.
<P>But one has to suppose that some of the data she cited seeped through to the British consciousness. Begin with the poll in Glasgow. It documents a quite astonishing story, namely that one-half of all students between the ages of 14 and 25 admit to smoking pot ``every day.'' Miss Short then went on to cite the experience of cannabis use in the Netherlands and in doing so bumped into another story.
<P>It is this, that for twenty years the authorities in Amsterdam have simply ignored the use of pot, which is regularly sold in four thousand coffee shops in amounts up to 30 grams per customer. Technically, the use of the drug, let alone the sale of it, is illegal, and during its most recent campaign the governing party pledged to rectify this hypocrisy and was all set to do that when it was reminded by its neighbors of something called the Schengen agreement, which introduced the border-free zone between the Netherlands, France, Germany, Spain, Luxembourg, and Belgium. France threatened to annul the agreement because cannabis was flowing merrily into a country in which no drug is permitted to compete with alcohol. The Dutch have said that they must therefore crack down on pot, which would mean closing half the coffee houses, not a popular idea. 
<P>But The Lancet, reviewing the controversy kicked up by Miss Short, asks the Home Office to consider the implications of the rise in marijuana use in Great Britain. Notwithstanding its laws, consumption of pot has doubled in ten years. And The Lancet goes on, ``Perhaps the politicians' real fear was that freedom to use soft drugs would automatically progress to increased use of substances such as cocaine and heroin. If so, they must have overlooked the recent Dutch government review which pointed out that decriminalization of possession of soft drugs had not led to a rise in the use of hard drugs.'' 
<P>Even so, the government struggles on. Last year Home Secretary Michael Howard increased the maximum fine for possession of the drug from $750 to $3,750, which is rough stuff but not, of course, to be compared with going to jail for a year or ten, as we do things here. There it ``depends where you get caught,'' writes drug-reformer Mike Goodman. ``There are parts of Wales and various rural areas where you'll certainly go to court for possessing cannabis and get a fairly stiff fine. In other areas, such as London, you'd be unlikely even to get a caution.'' In London, what you usually get is ``informal disposal'' -- which means the police throw the confiscated drugs down the drain.
<P>The evidence pours in. Another Home Office survey, this time of 25-year-olds, reveals that eight out of ten men and women have taken illegal drugs and that the biggest consumers were not schoolchildren but young white males from the professional and middle classes. At the other end of the empire we read that a businessman in Vancouver is quite openly engaged in distributing cannabis seeds all over the world, is paying his taxes, and the government of British Columbia is perfectly happy to accept the wages of sin, keeping his tax money and ignoring his illegal activity. ``If the drug ever does become legal in Britain,'' writes a correspondent of The Herald (Glasgow), ``it will be because of the sheer weight of such statistics, which indicate a threefold increase in the use of pot since 1989.'' 
<P>What is striking isn't so much the difference between what is legal and what people do, as the quite calm acceptance by the medical community of the relative harmlessness of cannabis, though the point is regularly made that if the weed were legalized, its quality could be superintended. And attention continues, however gradually, to focus on the paradox. Although ``no exact figures are available,'' says the dispatch from The Herald, ``it is known the Government is spending about twice as much on policing and prosecuting drug offenders as it does on education, prevention, and rehabilitation.'' That strikes some people, including your servant, as dumb.

<h2>The Week</h2>
<hr></center>
<P>


<p>
<li>
TV stations in New Hampshire and Iowa have started to get complaints that they keep
interrupting the Steve Forbes commercials to show programming.
<p>
<li>

All signs are that the obstructionists among President Clinton's advisors have the upper hand in
the internal debate over the budget. The idea is to stonewall the GOP's huge budget-reconciliation
bill, then pick it apart next year, making each element one plank in a scare campaign: the farm bill
in the Midwest; the Medicare reforms in Arizona, Florida, and just about everywhere else; etc.
(Think of it as their version of the Contract with America.) Republicans, meanwhile, would be
denied both any significant legislative accomplishment this year and any chance to rebut
Democratic distortions by pointing to the non-apocalyptic reality of their policies. So, it's
imperative that the GOP avoid this gridlock scenario. The chief means of doing so is by holding
the outstanding appropriations bills hostage and threatening another government shutdown come
December 15. Nervous senators -- Bob Dole is calling a second partial shutdown a ``mistake'' --
are beginning to shy away from this approach, chastened by the fallout from the mid-November
shutdown. Which obviously could have been handled better (may Newt Gingrich never exit from
the front door of a plane again). But, even so, once the November shutdown became focused on a
seven-year balanced budget, the White House's nightly tracking polls crashed and congressional
Democrats began to peel off. Clinton has no stomach for doing publicly what he wants in his
heart: to keep the red ink flowing. In the coming weeks, then, Republicans must drag him out in
the open, be flexible on the spending details (giving a little on Americorps, Medicare, and so on),
but refuse to accept ``no'' for an answer. Actually achieving a balanced budget is indispensable
political cover. As in 1990, when the Bush Administration headed for Andrews Air Force base,
the Republican future hangs in the balance. Blink -- and you're dead.


<p><li>
Whatever President Clinton's rhetoric about ``mending'' affirmative action, his Administration's
real commitment is to expanding it. One of the most telling pieces of evidence has been its
conduct in a Piscataway, New Jersey, case involving the use of race as a factor in employment
decisions. The Justice Department had sided with a fired white teacher, Sharon Taxman, during
the Bush Administration. But soon after Deval Patrick became chief of its Civil Rights Division in
1994, the department switched sides -- in the middle of an appeal. This astonishing breach of legal
ethics proved too much for a three-judge panel, by no means composed of conservatives, which
threw the Justice Department out of court late last month. Yet the theoretical revolution here is
even more sinister: for the first time, a branch of the Federal Government is advocating racial
discrimination not to remedy past discrimination, but to promote ``diversity.'' Which is perilously
close to advocating racial discrimination -- the ``right'' kind, of course -- for its own sake. So far,
no court has accepted this rationale for racial preferences. But the President has at least another
year to make judicial appointments. To squelch the social revolution Mr. Patrick desires, voters
will have to throw him out of office as well as out of court.


<p><li>
President Clinton says his Bosnia policy comes with a one-year guarantee. But would you buy a
used civil war from this man?
<p><li>


The ``energy crisis'' that the federal 55-mile-per-hour speed limit was meant to alleviate ended
long ago. Since liberals cannot bear to see any regulation die, they opposed repeal anyway,
warning of carnage on the roads. (If ``saving lives'' were a dispositive argument for the current
speed limit, it would be an even better argument for lowering it to 45 mph.) Now that President
Clinton has grudgingly signed the bill, drivers will still be able to reap most of the safety
advantages of the old laws by driving slowly if they wish to. The added danger from others'
driving faster is too negligible to be taken seriously. If liberals were really concerned about
highway fatalities, they would urge consumers to buy bigger cars -- currently discouraged by
government fuel-efficiency standards.


<p><li>
The U.S. Postal Service has decided what to do about terrible customer-satisfaction ratings. It
will no longer publish them.

<p>
<li>
Poof! In a keystroke Robert Rubin turned the Civil Service retirement fund into old-fashioned
IOUs. Since the latter are not subject to the debt limit, D-Day (as in default) was pushed back
until December 28. We don't recommend the practice. Not only are further trust-fund raids illegal
(Rubin's own lawyers attest to this), but they would increase future federal liabilities, thereby
making a balanced budget that much more difficult. There's a better way. Why not sell all those
assets that the government has no business holding under any fiscal situation? Mortgages and
other loans held by Uncle Sam are worth $203 billion, according to the budget. Government lands
with their mineral rights are worth $577 billion; even environmentalists acknowledge their
despoliation under Washington's management. Selling off gold, foreign exchange, and other assets
held by the Treasury and Federal Reserve would raise about $205 billion, and move us toward the
privatized money supply long advocated by libertarians. Liquidating all non-defense assets could
keep the government afloat for five and a half years, according to the Joint Economic Committee.
Unfortunately, it would take years just to plan such a sell-off. Maybe in the Gingrich
Administration . . .


<p><li>
President Clinton ventured a new core belief that ``Bosnia lies at the very heart of Europe.''
Publishers of maps, atlases, gazetteers, geography texts, and derivative material, kindly make the
necessary revisions.


<p><li>
Peter Rodman's revelation (p. 23) of secret Clinton assurances to Yeltsin that NATO expansion
would be delayed indefinitely was given wide advance circulation by NR among Capitol Hill
denizens, diplomats, and journalists. George Will asked Warren Christopher about it on the
December 3 Brinkley show -- only to be told it was ``absolute nonsense.'' Mr. Christopher denied
any such ``arrangement'' and promised that the NATO Allies were ``on a steady course'' on the
enlargement issue. The term ``arrangement'' was of course a straw man, and the NATO Allies are
in fact on a ``steady course'' to nowhere: the only schedule they have is a schedule of infinite
evasions. Mr. Rodman's sources are authoritative witnesses, on both the Russian and the
American side, to the summit conversation at Hyde Park and also to lower-level exchanges. The
Secretary's stonewall is unbecoming. Speaker Gingrich is including a query about the matter in a
formal letter to the President. We expect a more judicious -- and candid -- reply.
n To you skeptics, we say: A nation that can bring lasting peace to Somalia can bring lasting
peace to Bosnia.

<p><li>

Javier Solana, Spain's foreign minister, has been chosen as NATO's new secretary general to
replace the departed and discredited Willy Claes. Solana, however, is a Socialist who opposed
Spain's entry into the Alliance in the early 1980s, who has no experience in security matters, and
who represents a country that is not a member of NATO's integrated military command. Six GOP
senators, led by Bob Dole and Jesse Helms, have rightly protested the choice. But the
Administration, having clung to Claes well past his sell-by date, and having vetoed the staunchly
pro-American Ruud Lubbers (apparently he wasn't sound on Bosnia), was finally satisfied with
Solana. He's Clinton's kind of guy.


<p><li>
The White House spin is that we are sending ``peacekeepers'' to Bosnia. Presumably that means
that the army, navy, and air force will get to stay home. We'll see. We never quite trust the White
House in these matters.

<p>
<li>
A poll conducted by Frank Luntz uncovers some interesting moral differences between liberals
and conservatives. More liberals ``admit to having taken a hotel towel'' (46 to 37 per cent). They
are less likely to fly a flag outside their home, but far more likely to sleep around, and more likely
to be convinced (61 per cent, to 57 for conservatives) that they are better than their fellow man.
Since all these self-estimates but the last are true, they also rate high in honesty.


<p><li>
Over the past twenty years, the CIA and the DIA (Defense Intelligence Agency) have spent $20
million on psychics, asking them to look into issues of national concern, and we still don't know
what the President's core beliefs are.

<p>
Dear Rusty
<p>
<br>What can I say? We're on a roll!
<br>Peace in Bosnia! Can you believe it? I had a little trouble with the complexities of the
agreement, to be honest. I gave Dick Holbrooke a buzz and said, ``Hey, Dick, when you get a
sec, I'd like to have a quick debrief on the peace talks.''
<br>``Absolutely, Mr. Vice President,'' he said. ``How's mid-morning coffee on February 11th
strike you?''
<br>``Um, to be honest, Dick, I was hoping for something sooner.''
<br>``Sooner?''
<br>``As in today, tomorrow, that sort of thing.''
<br>``Can I be totally honest with you, Mr. Vice President? Personally, I would love to sit down
and chew over the peace plan with you. But my schedule is an absolute bear. I mean, I've got a
profile slash interview thing to sit for -- it'll be in either the Times or the Sunday magazine, we're
still going back and forth on that. Then Walter Isaacson's got some nutty idea about 'Man of the
Year' stuff, silly, I know, but there it is. Then I've got my book to do -- ''
<br>``You've got a book, too?'' I asked. I'm always interested in talking to other authors.
<br>``A couple, actually. I'm almost done with my memoirs, The Peacemaker Finds His Stillness,
then I've got a kind of monograph coming out next year, America in 2000: The Holbrooke
Envisioning -- so as you can see, if I could squeeze you in I'd do it but I just can't.''
<br>``Well,'' I said, ``if you can't, you can't.''
<br>``How about a quick nutshell? It'll have to do because I've got Gail Sheehy here and I'm in
the middle of explaining to her why she's nuts to think that I should be Secretary of State --
though let's be honest, Chris is looking tired and old and rode-hard-and-put-away-wet, and he's
seventy years old, and do we need new blood at State? Darn right we do! -- but it's not like I have
the time, you know?''
<br>``It doesn't sound like it.''
<br>``But could my arm be twisted? Could I be persuaded? I can answer that in the affirmative.''
<br>``Ummm . . .'' I mumbled. I was beginning to get confused. 
<br>``Okay. Bosnia in a nutshell. Got a pencil?''
I grabbed a pencil and a sheet of paper.
<br>``Okay. The situation before Dayton: the Serbs, Milosevic of the Serbian Republic, and
Karadzic and Mladic of the Bosnian Serbs -- ''
<br>``You just lost me,'' I said.
<br>``Let me put it very, very simply: We were in Dayton for three weeks. The first two and half,
we mostly bickered, while the various delegations gorged on Domino's and freaked out over the
high-quality toilet paper we've got in America. Then, in the final days, we brokered a deal.''
<br>``Which was?''
<br>``Well, I thought to myself, 'Okay, pretend you're a Serb leader. You've been killing and
maiming and raping for 44 months, waging a campaign of massacre and genocide, perpetrating
some of the most unspeakable acts of violence and inhumanity since the Third Reich, for what?'
And I answered myself, 'For more land, for more territory.'''
<br>``Once you found out that Serb aggression and their various war crimes were designed to
increase their territory, what did you do?''
<br>``What do you think we did? We gave it to them! C'mon, Mr. Vice President, meet me
halfway here!''
<br>``So the Serbs get away with it? They get what they want? No punishment for their crimes?''
<br>``Hey, I don't know what you call 21 days in a Marriott Suites in Dayton, Ohio, but I sure as
heck don't call it nothing!''
This didn't sound so good to me. ``But aren't we just, I don't know, appeasing them?''
<br>``Mr. Vice President, this is what they taught me at the Kennedy School. What can I tell
you?''
<br>``Well, I guess then it's okay,'' I said.
<br>``Can I go now?'' he asked. ``I've got to call the Times and the Post and issue a strongly
worded statement in support of Warren Christopher, denying that I have any interest at all in the
office of Secretary of State.''
<br>``I do have one quick question. What about Haiti? The word is President Aristide wants
another term in office.''
<br>``Let him have it. You want a second term. So does he.''
<br>``Good point,'' I said. It was, too.
<br>``And bear in mind, Mr. Vice President,'' he said, ``that if you're successful in 1996, Warren
Christopher will be almost eighty years old. And the world, Mr. Vice President, the world is
young. And now I really have to go.''
And he hung up. He's an amazing guy, Rusty. I can't wait 'til he turns his attention to China!

The Hot Plotters
<p>
NEW YORK, NOVEMBER 28
<p>

The search for a greater choice of presidential candidates can't reach more desperate lengths than
the situation reported over the weekend, namely that a Hot Plot has been hatching by means of
telephone conference calls. Of the seven players who participated in these calls, reported to have
lasted two hours each, three are relatively unknown, the others being Bill Bradley, Gary Hart,
Paul Tsongas, and Lowell Weicker.
<p>Time magazine reports that in their last telephone conference, it couldn't be settled which of
the plotters should enter his name in the formal contest. About Senator Bradley there is this
problem, namely that he would put his audience to sleep if he recited King Harry's speech to his
soldiers at Agincourt. Mr. Bradley was recently in California testing the waters. He found them
uniformly cold, if that is the right word for waters that react not at all to the finger stuck in them
seeking Delphic encouragement. 
<p>Gary Hart, of course, has troubles that date back to his hubristic outing on the yacht Monkey
Business, the design of which caper has to have been to prove that the American voters don't care
any more about adultery than they are supposed to care about abortion. To be sure, Senator Hart,
unlike most of the others on the party line last Sunday, is a charismatic political campaigner. But
when the opportunity came up earlier in the year to run for the Senate from his home state,
Colorado, he decided to pass it up. If you can't count on your home state for senator, it doesn't
make much sense to go for 26 states.
<p>Paul Tsongas is an attractive former senator who fired off a Roman candle or two during the
Democratic primaries in 1992 by calling for a reduced federal deficit. He ran into the usual
problem, which is that most voters are a) in favor of a balanced budget, and b) in favor of
everything that causes the budget to be unbalanced. In any event, Mr. Tsongas has medical
problems which are said to have caused him to rule himself out as the candidate of the Hot
Plotters.
<p>Lowell Weicker did succeed when he ran as an independent for governor of Connecticut,
soon after his defeat for re-election as senator at the hands of Joseph Lieberman. Governor
Weicker's reign calls to mind the blurb written by Evelyn Waugh for his friend Nancy Mitford's
novel. ``In 1945,'' Mr. Waugh wrote, ``Miss Mitford voted the socialist ticket. Having done her
best to make England uninhabitable, she went to France to live.'' It was Mr. Weicker who
instituted the income tax in Connecticut, which has served no purpose other than to make the
state less genial than it once was to middle-class residents and to corporations, many of which
have fled. There is this additional problem, which is that Mr. Weicker is the most obnoxious
moralist since Savonarola, suggesting that any deviation from whatever was his most recent
political epiphany marks the dissenter as a cretin. 
<p>So where do we go from here? As regards Bradley - Hart - Tsongas - Weicker, the answer is:
absolutely nowhere. What their putative coalition is meant to say is that there is (their word) a
``huge'' hunger for the kind of politics they represent. How does one reduce this agenda into
idiomatic political language? Well, the easiest way to put it is that they are anti-Newt.
<p>The Speaker has been having a rough time of it in recent days, and some of it is his fault. It
isn't a fault you'd score against a philosopher, who happily comes up with reticulate bearings to
help to understand any phenomenon. Years ago, wondering about some political quandary, I
asked a distinguished historian to trace the cause of the problem and he replied unhesitantly,
``William of Occam.'' He meant by this the introduction of relativist thought engendered by the
denial of universals in the fourteenth century.
<p>Okay, but of course Mr. Gingrich is supposed to speak in an idiomatic mode, and when
someone calls to his attention a quite awful specimen of human depravity, it is not wise, let alone
prudent, for him to cite federal welfare as the progenitive cause, even if, in a seminar, a professor
might persuasively track depravity back to welfare, back to original sin. But of course the trouble
with an etiological search so comprehensively concerned to identify the prime cause of human
misbehavior is that it could finger Newt Gingrich as suffering from the sin of intellectual pride.
But the surviving point has got to be that the courage and the stamina of the Speaker have given
the voters a vision of something truly distinctive from such an awful stew as one gets from the
Hot Plotters, who don't even have an interesting idiosyncrasy to call attention to them.

<CENTER><H2>Yalta in the Balkans</H2></CENTER>
<HR>

<p>
by Peter W. Rodman
<p>

WASHINGTON, D.C.
<p>
	One of the better arguments for the Dayton Accords and the dispatching of U.S. troops to Bosnia was that putting the Bosnian conflict on ice would serve larger American strategic interests.  One such interest was the future of the Western alliance: the prolongation of the Bosnia war and the squabbles among the Allies were poisonous to the Alliance itself, and the resulting incoherence of Western policy was poisonous to NATO's credibility.  A second key strategic interest was the enlargement of NATO into Central Europe, and prolongation of the Bosnia war was also complicating this.  (During the climactic NATO bombing operations in September, Boris Yeltsin gave a tempestuous news conference in which he conflated the two issues, blustering that an enlarged NATO would soon be dropping bombs on Russia's doorstep.)  The Dayton Accords offer us a chance, in other words, to put all this behind us and to re-focus our European policy on our larger concerns.
<p>
	These arguments for Dayton still hold, but NATIONAL REVIEW has learned of a stunningly duplicitous turn in the Clinton Administration's policy toward Russia, Bosnia, and the Atlantic Alliance:  The President and his associates are reported to have given Moscow secret assurances that, in return for its cooperation with the U.S. in Bosnia peacekeeping, NATO enlargement will be put "on the back burner" for the foreseeable future.  The rationale was that, given this demonstration of Russia's readiness to be a partner in a new cooperative "European security architecture," the extension of NATO security guarantees to Central Europe would not be a priority any time soon.  This account comes from official and authoritative sources, both Russian and American.
<p>
	It has long been understood (indeed, admitted by some Administration officials) that concrete decisions on admitting new NATO members would be put off until after the Russian elections, especially the presidential election scheduled for June 1996--which meant, as a practical matter, until after the U.S. presidential election as well.  Russian officials interpret the new assurances to mean that if Mr. Clinton is re-elected, nothing will happen on NATO enlargement in his second term either.
<p>
	The story is accompanied by reports of other assurances to the Russians that their cooperation on Bosnia would put the United States in their debt and earn them greater American understanding on other issues, such as their reassertion of control in their "near abroad" (Central Asia and the Caucasus, including the oil-rich Caspian basin).
<p>
	As usual, this Administration has its strategic priorities totally bass-ackwards.  It is wrong to pay a price to Russia over Bosnia in the strategic coin of our larger interest in consolidating security in Central Europe.  It is wrong to sacrifice NATO enlargement to the Russians over Bosnia or over anything else.  The Administration's repeated assurances to Congress and to the Allies that Russia would not have a veto over NATO enlargement turn out to be empty--perhaps just another of the "terminological inexactitudes" that have become so familiar.  A huge price will ultimately be paid for this.
<p>
	There is no current threat to Central Europe.  The newly liberated states of the region, however, have just recently awakened from a 60-year nightmare, still find themselves situated between Germany and Russia, and know in their bones that their survival is not guaranteed by history.  They consider themselves part of the West culturally, politically, and morally; they therefore seek Western assurances that we feel a stake in their security and independence.  Seen in this light, NATO enlargement is not a new act, but a consolidation of the post-1989 status quo: the are free, sovereign countries exercising their free, sovereign choice to associate with us.  Either Russia accepts this, or it does not.
<p>
	Leaving the security status of Central Europe ambiguous only leaves open temptations to Russian irredentists.  NATO membership for Central Europe is among other things a way of telling the Russians that their acceptance of the post-1989 status quo in Central Europe is the sine qua non of any relationship with us.  If the Russians have a problem with this--which they clearly seem to have--then we are all facing a major problem five or ten years down the road as Russia regains its strength.
<p>
	The Administration's rationale for delaying NATO enlargement has been twofold.  One is the claim that it will be easier to achieve such enlargement if we go about it gradually.  But the nationalist turn in Russian politics, expected to be given new impetus by the December elections for the Duma, tells us that it will not get any easier.  Russia is only getting stronger and more assertive; every month, the risks and inhibitions on our side will only grow.  The Administration's second rationale (at least so I suspect) is what philosophy majors will remember as Zeno's Paradox: the idea that if you divide a distance into an infinite number of tiny increments, you never get to the destination.  This may be the Administration's real calculation.  In other words, it just doesn't want to enlarge NATO--for fear of antagonizing Moscow.  The first rationale is bad judgment; the second is bad faith.
<p>
	Whatever the short-term plaudits due to the Administration for putting the Bosnia conflict on ice, in Central Europe we are seeing a strategic blunder of historic proportions.

<h2>The Week</h2>
<hr></center>
<P>

<P><li>
The Federal Government briefly shut down on our 35th anniversary.
Never ones to rest on our laurels, for our 40th we arranged a
shutdown rather more spectacular than the last. For our 45th,
we plan to shut down the Supreme Court.
<P><li>
The Florida straw poll was the last of those elusive pre-primary
events that reflect in equal parts hype and organizational energy,
and generate a wave of analysis that discounts the results even
as it dissects them. The common wisdom from Orlando, as it turns
out, is roughly right: Dole remains the front-runner but is still
a weak one; Gramm's second-place finish was what he needed to
remain viable; Alexander suffered from expectations that he might
come in second, but his finish close to Gramm inches him near
the top tier; everyone else is going to have trouble running a
national campaign (although Buchanan is looking strong in New
Hampshire, and Alan Keyes, who is running on nothing except his
soaring words, continues to inspire a slice of GOP activists).
But the straw poll should send the clearest signal to Bob Dole.
So far, he has run a campaign about as near to flawless (except
for incessant ``off-message'' unscripted comments -- the latest
in Time) as could be expected given his record and inclinations.
And the result is still tepid: a third of the vote, after pouring
a million dollars and impressive organizational resources into
an event stocked with party regulars. If this is what it's like
when the going is good, what happens after a gaffe?
<P><li>
To paraphrase an old feminist line, the U.S. without a Federal
Government is like a fish without a fish-hook.
<P><li>
A few months back, conservatives were criticizing Sheila Burke,
chief of staff to Sen. Bob Dole, for allegedly tugging her boss
leftward. Our own Rich Lowry noted that some of the criticisms
were ``over the top'' and suggested that Dole, not his staffers,
was responsible for any disappointments from his office [``The
101st Senator,'' July 31]. Now Jason DeParle has written a cover
story for the New York Times Magazine under the headline, ``Sheila
Burke is the Militant Feminist Commie Peacenik Who's Telling Bob
Dole What to Think,'' and the subhead, ``Well, no. She's just
the senator's moderate chief of staff, the latest victim of the
conservative attack machine.'' Where to start? No conservative
described Mrs. Burke as a ``Commie peacenik,'' etc. Since NR's
balanced article contradicts his premise, DeParle ignores it except
to mention a minor error that was immediately acknowledged in
the magazine. The cover promises an expose of ``The Campaign to
Demonize Sheila Burke,'' as if DeParle considers it ``demonization''
to call a liberal a liberal -- which, considering what most Americans
think, isn't so far off. Keep ruminating, DeParle: you've come
up with one half-truth, you may find another.
<P><li>
But when the New York Times is fair, how can we fail to be? So
we applaud the Times for its headline after the GOP took the Louisiana
governorship: ``Republicans Regain/National Momentum/With Louisiana
Win.'' Just kidding.
<P><li>
On November 21, the President announced that the Dayton talks
had produced a Bosnia agreement, and he promised to ``consult''
with Congress before a peace treaty was signed and U.S. troops
were sent to police it. Four days earlier, the House had passed,
243 to 171, the Hefley amendment barring any Bosnia deployment.
The President will probably be able to make a veto of this stick,
but a positive vote of support may be out of reach, even in the
afterglow of the agreement. On one side of the debate will be
arguments about the last best chance for peace, keeping a promise
made to allies, and preserving U.S. influence in Europe; on the
other side, arguments about the flaws and shakiness of the ``peace''
and the risks to American soldiers. Sending troops without a congressional
vote of support would compound all the risks, both in Bosnia and
at home, and in all likelihood lead to 1) an attack on U.S. troops
by whichever side finds their presence an obstacle, and 2) their
withdrawal by an Administration not known for its courage under
pressure. That would damage U.S. leadership far more than a refusal
to provide American forces now. Our advice to Mr. Clinton is borrowed
from the Duke of Wellington: ``You have got yourself into a damned
difficult spot, and you must think hard how best to get out of
it.''
<P><li>
If the California Civil Rights Initiative gets enough signatures
to qualify for the ballot, it will almost certainly win -- and
quite possibly scuttle President Clinton's chances of re-election.
But the CCRI is in deep trouble, partly because people mistakenly
assume it is a done deal, partly because of the campaign's own
amateurism. Paid petitioning has been suspended for lack of funds,
and only a fraction of the required signatures has been collected.
Now is the time for the national Republican Party to set up an
independent petition drive to get the CCRI on the ballot; and
for GOP  presidential candidates and California congressmen to
donate soft money to aid that drive. Republicans cannot afford
to let the CCRI fail. Nor can any American who believes that people
should be judged by their individual qualities, not by their race.
<P><li>
Remember Hillary's task force to socialize American medicine?
The White House said it cost $100,000, which turns out to be off
by a factor of at least 138 -- somewhere between an ordinary Clinton
fib and a whopper. The real figure is now put at $13.8 million,
maybe more, who knows?
<P><li>
President Clinton's intervention in Haiti seemed to be going swimmingly
-- until November. First, prime minister Smarck Michel resigned
to protest President Aristide's refusal to proceed with economic
reform. Then, Aristide began to foment violence in an apparent
effort to undermine -- and perhaps to head off -- presidential
elections scheduled for December 17. Aristide's words and actions
have become so indefensible that even his cheerleaders at the
New York Times front-paged a story about the worsening mess. Where
are things now heading? Either to an election seen as illegitimate
by most of Haiti's democrats, in which the leftist Rene Preval
becomes president, or to massive disorder, which permits Aristide
to stay in power. It's entirely plausible that our troops will
leave on schedule, but their departure may well be followed by
yet more violence and even another coup. Isn't this where we came
in, a few hundred million dollars ago?
<P><li>
Fred West, the English serial killer who buried nearly a dozen
bodies at 25 Cromwell Street, Gloucester, was writing his memoirs
in prison when he hanged himself. He entitled them I Only Ever
Loved an Angel. The jury did not entirely agree with him. It had
little difficulty in finding the supposed angel, his wife, Rosemary,
guilty of murdering her daughter, stepdaughter, and lodger (who
was pregnant at the time by Mr. West). By comparison with the
goings-on at Number 25, as revealed at the trial, Fellini's Satyricon
looked like an evangelical crusade for chastity. For the most
part, the sexually insatiable Wests preyed upon rootless young
women from the underclass whom they enticed into their home, where
they tied them up, beat and raped them, killed them, dismembered
them, and then buried them. Their most active period of unspeakable
depravity was the 1970s. The picture of life in the English underclass
that emerged from the trial was horrific in the extreme. One lesson
to be learned from the whole sordid episode is that the underclass
was clearly in place before the advent of Mrs. Thatcher, who is
often blamed for creating it. The West trial, in fact, was a reductio
ad nauseam of the values of the 1960s -- self-expression without
self-restraint.
<P><li>
Incidentally, Dr. Jack Kevorkian presided over his 26th snuffing,
and still hasn't received a Clinton nomination to be the new surgeon
general.
<P><li>
Last January, the Claremont Institute brought together 17 prominent
conservatives -- including Richard Brookhiser, Angela ``Bay''
Buchanan, Linda Chavez, Alan Keyes, Ed Meese, Ralph Reed, William
A. Rusher, and Bret Schundler -- to consider the culture wars.
The ``Conservative Manifesto'' they came up with calls for a renewed
commitment to ``the moral and natural law,'' a project of restoration
that has two steps: ``dismantling . . . ruinous bureaucracies,''
and fighting relativism in the culture. The friends of freedom
and virtue must hang together, or they will hang separately. The
manifesto is a good antidote to liberal pundits eager to see the
conservative coalition break up. If it is less detailed than the
Declaration of Independence, that is because the Founders' enemy
was smaller, and less protean.
<P><li>
Most minorities, according to a Labor Department survey, prefer
older racial and ethnic designations over newfangled multiculturalist
alternatives. Blacks, for example, are most likely to describe
themselves as such (45 per cent); only 28 per cent choose ``African
American.'' Likewise, Hispanics overwhelmingly favor that title
over the liberal-chic ``Latino'' (57 per cent to 12 per cent);
and American Indians scalped ``Native American'' by a margin of
49 to 37 per cent. Whether the Census will respect the wishes
of these groups remains to be seen. Meanwhile, more questions
for the next survey: how many liberals call themselves liberals;
how many feminists call themselves women; how many Episcopalians
call themselves Christian.
<P><li>
The fictional Administration in Rob Reiner's movie The American
President bears a sharp resemblance to the real Administration
of Bill Clinton, down to the  wisp of hair on the forehead of
Michael J. Fox as President Shepherd's Stephanopolitan chief domestic
advisor. But Shepherd is less like the actual incumbent than like
Mr. Clinton's daydream of himself: a strong, decisive leader;
a principled liberal; popular with the electorate and with a sexy
lady whom he gets to bed down right in the White House; highly
organized; slim; a widower.
<P><li>
Samuel Francis, a scholar of political theory and an occasional
contributor to NR, has lost his job as an editorial writer at
the Washington Times. In both his writing and his public speaking,
Mr. Francis had expressed some highly provocative opinions. Most
recently he chided the Southern Baptists for publicly regretting
their failure to fight slavery. Then Dinesh D'Souza, in his book
The End of Racism, quoted Mr. Francis as calling on whites to
``reassert our identity and our solidarity . . . in explicitly
racial terms.'' Now, these strike us as foolish views, especially
the latter: racial consciousness-raising would be as destructive
for whites as it has been for blacks. But are they hanging offenses?
An employer has the right to fire someone he feels is bad for
business. But the decision of Times editor Wesley Pruden to act
on this right was regrettable. At the New York Times, when the
editorial writer Brent Staples published, successively, a bizarre
admission that he had stalked Saul Bellow, and an illiterate attack
on Leo Strauss, he got clean away with it (no surprise: white
liberals expect very little from black liberals). That too was
wrong. Foolishness calls for a rebuke -- whether severe or light,
depending on the degree of foolishness and other mitigating circumstances
(the numerous writing awards Francis won for the Times). With
their respective treatments of wayward writers, neither Times
has done itself credit.
<P><li>
The FDA is thinking about allowing the hair-growth drug Rogaine
to be sold without a prescription, and more cheaply, too. One
instantly infers that the bureaucrats themselves are getting old
and bald. Perhaps there is hope yet for America.

ON THE RIGHT / Wm. F. Buckley Jr.
<P>
X-Ray Time
<P>
NEW YORK, NOVEMBER 14
<P>
It is useful to examine the federal deadlock through a strictly
democratic prism.
<P>
1. We have a separation of powers that authorizes Congress uniquely
to pass legislation; and a subdivision here that authorizes only
the House of Representatives to write bills that will cost money.
<P>
2. The President is authorized to veto any bill presented to him
by Congress. To override a presidential veto requires two-thirds
of the vote in each house.
<P>
3. In the existing situation, a majority of both houses passes
a measure that would simultaneously do a great many things, including
program an increase in payments required by the public to sustain
Medicaid and Medicare.
<P>
4. The President exercises his veto, complaining specifically
about the measure's health-care provisions.
<P>
5. Congressional leadership asks itself: Given that an override
of the veto cannot be recruited, how might Congress force its
hand on the President?
<P>
Force its hand!? Yes, that is what Messrs. Dole and Gingrich are
saying in effect, because they are seeking to implement what they
understand as strict instructions from the American people. They
are to move toward balancing the budget, and their plan for doing
so is blocked by the President's power.
<P>
But Congress also has power. The continuation of federal activity,
including the health benefits, requires financing. It is generally
assumed that so-called entitlements are inertial forces that cannot
be interrupted. But the forward movement of those forces requires
constant propulsion, and this is doable only by appropriations
by Congress.
<P>
The leadership is quite confident that its mandate hasn't withered
since it was enunciated in the November election. A national survey
done by Public Opinion Strategies only a week ago reveals that
66 per cent of Americans favor ``balancing the budget [even] if
that means that spending on Medicare and Medicaid would continue
to increase but at a lower rate.'' Accordingly, Congress uses
its trump card and freezes spending at the highest level authorized
by a preceding Congress, i.e., at 4.9 trillion borrowed dollars.
<P>
So: The people voted, Congress acted, the President vetoed, Congress
used its primordial power.
<P>
In a parliamentary system, such an impasse would be quickly solved.
The parliament would be dissolved, an election scheduled. If the
party upholding a balanced budget prevailed in that election,
the prime minister would resign and be replaced by a member of
the validated party. If otherwise, the prime minister would be
back with a compliant legislature. But then, the prime minister
wouldn't be occupying the executive mansion unless placed there
by the ruling faction in the legislature. What we face today is
what the British would call a constitutional crisis.
<P>
The public has not yet been discomfited, and no one will be for
a period, the exception being 800,000 furloughed federal workers.
The Treasury secretary is maneuvering and isn't likely to run
out of gas unless a major creditor nation decides that there is
too much harum-scarum going on and, instead of holding its reserves
in dollars, switches to yen, or marks, or pounds sterling.
<P>
What we do have is high-pitched political theater. The people
are vaguely aware of the instructions they gave to the new Congress,
but they are, with various degrees of intensity, concerned with
medical care, and that element of Americans most concerned is
of course the senior citizens, and it is they who exercise critical
clout. The President is relying on his incantatory evocations
of starving children and homeless old people, with here and there
a tear shed for what used to be Yellowstone Park. Presidential
indignation makes its way quickly to the headlines.
<P>
By contrast, it is Congress that is held to be the agent of all
those things, and we come quickly on the supreme irony, which
is that references are almost inevitably to the ``rigid,'' the
``defiant,'' the ``reckless'' Congress, the complement of the
lonely, single defender of the people's interest. There was never
a better example of everybody being out of step except Johnny.

<HR>
27-November-1995

<P>



<p><li>The Dole campaign accuses Sen. Gramm of using Jimmy Carter tactics. We don't know what this is all about, but we know mud when we see it flung.<p><li>The end of the ``revolution''? Not exactly. The results of the November 7 elections offer no signs of a Democratic resurgence. Democrats barely held onto the Kentucky governor's mansion and the Virginia State Senate -- both of which they have essentially owned since Reconstruction -- by mobilizing their base with scare talk about Newt Gingrich and GOP budget cuts. Republican voters, meanwhile, appeared to suffer from complacency, an almost inevitable reaction to 1994. The GOP momentum has unquestionably slowed. But the inertia had set in months ago, especially in the U.S. Senate. A Republican Congress elected to reshape American politics has left its contours remarkably unaltered: so far, no tax cuts, no welfare reform, no end to affirmative action, no regulatory relief -- in short, no tangible benefits for Middle America. So who needs more Republicans? If the elections are taken as proof that the GOP has gone ``too far'' -- if they prompt Republicans to back off before any of their agenda has become law -- voters will inevitably be asking the same question next year.
<p><li>In a partial-birth abortion, the infant is pulled feet first from his mother's womb while the head is kept just within the uterus; the abortionist then punctures the infant's skull and suctions the brain out. (You can understand why pro-abortionists would rather talk about ``choice'' than about these grisly realities.) By a vote of 288 to 139, the House of Representatives passed a bill to ban this vile procedure -- and, in the process, shattered the myth that social issues are tearing Republicans apart. In fact it was Democrats, not Republicans, who were split. If the Senate follows the House's lead, President Clinton will be forced to choose between enraging his most vocal supporters and defending the indefensible. Abortionists are already enraged: in the words of one New York Times story, ``Most of the doctors interviewed said they saw no moral difference between dismembering the fetus within the uterus [and] partially delivering it, intact, before killing it.'' They are, of course, correct.

<p><li>The debate among conservatives over Colin Powell was already burning nicely when Bill Bennett threw gasoline on the fire with some ill-chosen words on abortion. Social-conservative activists had criticized him for speaking favorably of Gen. Powell despite his pro-choice position, and Mr. Bennett blasted back. ``Holding onto the chimera of a constitutional amendment to outlaw abortion (the means) has done nothing to reduce the number of abortions (which ought to be the end).'' Pro-lifers would do better, he argued, to support presidential candidates who would talk about ``teen abstinence, adoption, crisis-pregnancy centers, individual responsibility, and the importance of a civilization's common moral code.'' Finally, he maintained that proponents of a Human Life Amendment, to be logically consistent, should advocate applying the penalties for first-degree murder to doctors who perform abortions and women who procure them. Mr. Bennett's empirical claim is debatable: abortion rates have fallen over the last decade and a half, and surely the cultural impact of the campaign for the HLA had something to do with that decline. He errs more seriously in describing anti-abortion laws as merely a means to an end. The ``right'' to take a life unjustly would remain a blot on the nation's conscience and its lawbooks even if nobody chose to exercise it. And abortion laws, contrary to his assertion, never invoked penalties equivalent to those for first-degree murder. Mr. Bennett's proposed alternative -- a lot of talk about consensus virtues -- is striking in its timidity. Polls continue to show strong public support for substantial abortion regulation; pro-abortion intellectuals are in retreat; and pro-lifers have scored significant political victories -- most spectacularly in 1994, when not a single pro-life incumbent of either party lost an election to a pro-choice candidate. Given these trends, pro-lifers would be better advised to escalate their demands than to settle for an agenda that Hillary Clinton could happi
ly endorse.

<p><li>If this is part of a sequel, The Book of Easy Virtues, Mr. Bennett should be warned that it will be a long, long volume.<p><li>Rep. James Saxton (R., N.J.) is House Chairman of the Joint Economic Committee (JEC), responsible among other things for producting studies that illustrate the benefits of Republican policies like, oh, balancing the budget. So it was no small embarrassment when Saxton, who enjoys a safe congressional seat and hence has no discernible need to pander, voted against the House GOP's budget and Medicare plan, despite a last-minute deal that sent an extra $750 million to his state. (Surely the House leadership can find a JEC chairman who actually votes the way his committee's literature reads.) New Jersey Rep. Dick Zimmer, who plans to run for Bill Bradley's Senate seat, deserted the GOP too, laying to rest any doubts that he would be an additional Senate roadblock to Republican reform. A roadblock like Maine's William Cohen, who after extracting concessions on regulation of nursing-home care and other matters still voted against the Senate Republican budget because he couldn't in good conscience vote to cut taxes. But all this looks almost statesmanlike in comparison to Pat Buchanan's new radio ad attacking GOP Medicare reform as ``cuts'' unfair to the elderly, a particularly naked bit of opportunism from a politician who prides himself on principle. Maybe the next Contract with America should propose career limits.<p><li>Why is Sen. Barbara Boxer participating in the Whitewater oversight hearings? Her daughter, Nicole, is married to Hillary Clinton's brother Anthony. Nicole Boxer Rodham, therefore, is Hillary's sister-in-law. Perhaps this explains Sen. Boxer's blind defense of Bill and Hillary throughout the Whitewater hearings. But it does not explain why her colleagues tolerate what most people would consider a serious conflict of interest. One wonders what former Sen. Bob Packwood thinks of Sen. Boxer's conduct.<p><li>In case it slipped by you, Saddam Hussein won re-election in Ir
aq with a comfortable 99.5 per cent of the vote. The other 0.5 per cent were members of his family who defected to Jordan.<p><li>``For thirty years, Ottawa's federalists have claimed successively that the Quebec separatist dragon did not exist, that its jaws were not open, that it was not going to swallow anyone and -- now -- that Confederation will escape by hanging onto its tonsils.'' NR said that last year about the complacency that greeted the Parti Quebecois's victory in the provincial elections. After the stunningly close vote in the October 30 referendum on sovereignty (see page 32), the Ottawacrats are hanging onto the dragon's tonsils by their fingernails. Even more significant than the overall squeaker was the 60 per cent vote for the Yes cause among French-speakers, a margin of victory that a referendum on American independence probably could not have achieved in New England in 1776. A nation is in quest of a state in Quebec, and Premier Jacques Parizeau was only being realistic when, in his much-denounced concession speech, he pointed out the anomaly that this quest is being frustrated only by the province's English-speaking and immigrant minorities. Naturally, he has been excoriated by the Ottawacrats' Canadian mouthpieces and by their liberal soulmates here. More surprising is to find the usually sensible Charles Krauthammer, in the November 3 Washington Post, decrying the breakup of Canada over ``an issue as relatively trivial as language.'' There could be no better measure of the extent to which even some of America's conservative intellectuals have lost sight of the ethnic and cultural realities that constitute a sense of common nationhood. Except, of course, for our own immigration and language policies.<p><li>U.S. Army medic Specialist Michael G. New is before a court-martial because he refused to don United Nations insignia when his unit (of the 3rd Infantry Division) was assigned to peacekeeping duties in Macedonia. He had served meritoriously before, including a tour in Kuwait last year, b
ut he balked at exchanging his U.S. Army insignia and status for the UN blue helmet and for the nebulous status of serving under UN command. His rationale is that he swore allegiance to the United States, not to the United Nations. Now, individual GIs cannot be allowed to make decisions of high policy. But policymakers ought to make better decisions. The Clinton Administration's infatuation with multilateralism long ago went over the top. If we want to be in Macedonia, we should be there under the red, white, and blue. And New should be reassigned to Alaska, not court-martialed.<p><li>NATO has been searching for a new Secretary General since Willy Claes stepped down to face charges in connection with a Belgian bribery scandal. The real scandal, as NR was among the first to point out, was that Claes held the position in the first place. In the early Eighties, the Belgian Socialist had opposed deployment in Europe of U.S. Pershing II and cruise missiles (NATO's response to the Soviet SS-20s), which should have disqualified him. Good riddance. Now, the leading candidate to succeed Claes is Ruud Lubbers, a Dutch Christian Democrat and former prime minister who supported the Euromissile deployment. He is a firm Atlanticist. The Clinton Administration, showing the strategic judgment for which it is so famous, supported Claes to the end and has been resisting Lubbers -- apparently because European NATO members have openly favored him, and Washington does not want to have a staunch pro-American foisted on us by a bunch of pesky foreigners.
<p><li>President Clinton ran a new, wholly unexpected Core Belief up the flagpole, confessing that he had raised taxes too much. Next day, after the Democratic establishment had voiced shock and dismay, Mr. Clinton's Core Belief was back to being ``very, very proud'' of the tax increase, and life returned to normal.<p><li>``The ultimate logic of a market economy is the gangsterization of culture. . . . The marketplace . . . is an extension of the laissez-white supremacy. . . . Same as those with homophobia, keeping trapped the humanity of gay brothers and lesbian sisters.'' No, this is not a scene from Dead Presidents. It is the racio-economic stylings of Cornel West -- liberal flavor of the month -- at the 25th anniversary celebration of the Catholic-funded Campaign for Human Development. For the last several years, drawing on reports from the Capital Research Center, we have been writing about the antics of CHD, which funds gay-rights activists, pro-abortionists, and radical feminist nuns -- all in the name of empowering the poor. In the words of one such activist pondering his good fortune: ``My God! I can't believe they're funding that here.'' Yet Catholics continue to pony up for this organization amid denials from pastors and bishops that, as Catholic readers report to us, go something like this: ``What do you expect from a bunch of conservatives?'' We are glad to see that fallacies like the ad hominem are still taught in Catholic seminaries, but disturbed that they seem to be given as exercises. This year, when the basket comes around for the Campaign for Human Development, just refuse to participate in the ``gangsterization'' of Catholicism.<p><li>Three relics of one of those Arcadian Indian civilizations so cruelly snuffed out by the Spanish Empire were uncovered by scientists on an Andean mountain peak. Frozen and perfectly preserved, they had been killed by Native American priests as a sacrifice to the gods of Mount Ampato. It was an Inca thing. You wouldn't understand.

THE AIDS PLAGUE<br>
Dying of the Light<br>
Presumably aware of the dangers they court, homosexuals continueto contract AIDS at an astonishing rate. The 'support' theyreceive for doing so is unconscionable.
<br>MIDGE DECTER<br>
Mrs. Decter is a writer living in New York City.<br>


<p>SINCE 1981, the experts tell us, some 441,528 Americans have been diagnosed with AIDS. Of these, it is said, about half have contracted the disease as a result of male homosexual coupling, and another quarter as a result of using contaminated needles for intravenous drug consumption. The rest are in one way or another simply victims of the above: people who have been given transfusions with infected blood, or women whose husbands have taken their secret extramarital pleasures with infected men, or babies born to AIDS-infected mothers. To be sure, in that same period the rates for heart disease and cancer have been much higher, but considering that AIDS has so far proved to be not only incurable but invariably fatal, the number of its sufferers has struck everyone as especially terrible.

<p>An even more terrible number, however, is the 187,309 new cases reported for the years 1993 and 1994. For whereas the earliest AIDS patients knew nothing of their potential affliction until it was too late, by 1993 the means for avoiding infection were very widely known -- indeed, in some places were even being taught to schoolchildren -- and surely universally known to the country's homosexual population. Thus it must be assumed that (with the exception of wives ignorant of what their husbands were doing on the sly and the doomed babies of criminally negligent mothers) the bulk of the most recently recorded cases have been contracted with foreknowledge of the dangers. Particularly in a society as health-obsessed and disease-conscious as our own, this most recent statistic fairly boggles the mind.

<p>Is it, then, willful suicide, or hubris, or the former posing as the latter, that has lately been leading so many young homosexuals knowingly to engage in the kind of unprotected sex that is most calculated to leave them with AIDS? Finding the answer to this question is essential not only for understanding what is really involved in the effort to control the spread of the infection but also for getting a handle on the agenda of the homosexual activists.

<p>For a long time gay-rights activists have divided their time between, on the one hand, declaring that everyone, homosexual or heterosexual, is equally at risk of contracting AIDS, and, on the other hand, demanding special attention and compassion as a community uniquely victimized by it. The idea that everyone is at risk was, of course, meant to prevent a fresh mark of pariahdom from being set upon the brow of the so newly respectable homosexual community: homosexual sex was to be held no more dangerous and no more at fault for the spread of AIDS than the heterosexual variety. (This idea, in addition to leading to the disproportionate expenditure of government funds on research into a cure -- more than a billion dollars per year -- carried the added benefit of engaging homosexuals as homosexuals in the process of writing and/or revising health-education curricula.) On the other hand, the idea that the homosexual community is being singularly victimized has helped to fan the sense of injustice and outrage on which the gay-rights movement, like any rights movement, must depend for its political livelihood and that precisely as a result of its successes might be in danger of diminishing.

<p>Thus the issue of AIDS has plunged those activists who speak most loudly in the name of their fellow homosexuals even more deeply into the contradiction that trembles perpetually beneath their relations with the ``straight'' world -- the simultaneous assertion that they are the same as everyone else and that their experience is unique.

<p>In this, of course, gay politics is more or less like all the other forms of rights-politics in our time. With this one overriding difference: that while the two other current major rights movements, the blacks' and the women's, are subject to essentially the same basic contradiction, neither of them happens to be beset by the complication that a significant number of its members and intended beneficiaries seem to be willfully courting death.

<p>Now, the connection of homosexuality to suicide -- a connection about which the most recent history of AIDS has left little room for doubt -- is, like most things having to do with suicide, in the end a profound mystery. It is, moreover, a mystery which it would be presumptuous, not to say useless, for anyone but homosexuals themselves to attempt to confront -- although confront it is something they would sooner or later be well advised to do. Still, what is in its way even more mysterious is the response of the homosexuals' putative friends and well-wishers to this scourge that has been racing virtually unhindered through their community. For surely never have people professing care and loving kindness been so admiring, so celebratory, of hopeless suffering as has the society of America's enlightened, liberal, rich, famous, and/or beautiful heterosexuals with respect to AIDS.

<p>There are two problems here, one perhaps not so difficult to understand, the other difficult indeed. The first has to do with the homosexuals themselves and their cooperative acceptance of what can be called, if not actual dancing, then certainly large-scale posturing on their graves. Can they really be so benighted as to regard public cheering in the face of their mortal danger as love? Would not scolding and imprecations and efforts to turn them from their fatal ways, however unpleasant, be truer marks of fellow feeling? Alas, so widespread and commonplace has the disease become among them that tolerance for AIDS and tolerance for them may have come to seem one and the same thing. And then, to be sure, there are the enormous political benefits for the gay-rights movements in AIDS's having become literally a cause celcbre.

<p>If memory serves, the celebration began almost immediately upon the country's becoming widely aware of the disease: with the death of Rock Hudson, who was possibly the first very famous person to die of it -- anyway certainly one of the earliest cases to be publicly acknowledged. No doubt millions of American women were stricken to discover that this figure who had for so long haunted their daydreams had in fact been a homosexual and had been carried off as a result of a sexual career both hidden from, and a denial of, them. But whatever that first shock, it must soon have been dispelled by the way a whole raft of people in Hollywood responded to what would once have been a scandal by coming very close to claiming that they had witnessed their colleague being assumed into heaven in a fiery chariot.

<p>And almost from that first moment it was decreed by those who dictate the nation's displays of stylish sentiment that not only would no whisper of shame be attached to what is after all essentially a venereal disease, but indeed suffering from AIDS would be deemed an honorific condition. Nor would it be honored only in profound thought and sensitive prose but, on the contrary, in the most determined and lavish public display. This decree did not, of course, extend to those who became diseased as a result of intravenous drug use; that was tacky. And as for the innocent victims -- hemophiliacs, babies, and so on -- for them there would of course be pity and charitable gestures but certainly no celebration. To be celebrated for having been felled by AIDS -- which is to say, to be sung, storied, eulogized, lobbied for, polemicized about, and truly wept over -- one had to be a homosexual. In other words, one had to have contracted the disease the good old-fashioned venereal way, through heedless (or lately, we are told, intentional) acts of anal and/or oral sex with already infected and equally heedless male partners.

<p>Which brings us to the second problem; call it the puzzle of the scarlet ribbon. Do healthy people who pin the shiny red commemoration of AIDS to their lapel -- and their number is by now legion -- mean to express by it their solidarity with those who are gone? With those who are about to go? With those who will one day inevitably be going? With the disease itself? The issue is not a trivial one, for what does it mean to make a gesture of fellowhood with people who have contrived to become hopeless when one has not oneself?

<p>Perhaps the ultimate in such display was reached in that moment of the Academy Awards ceremony of 1994 when Tom Hanks, accepting the Oscar for his performance as a man afflicted with AIDS, got swept across the boundary between performance and reality and, before an audience of millions, wept with love for his momentarily imagined fellow AIDS sufferers; ``angels in heaven,'' is what he tearfully pronounced them to be. (Hanks himself, of course, would soon be going on to another hugely successful movie, while who knows how many of his potential ``angels'' would be climbing into their beds of pain.)

<p>Actors and their emotions aside, it is no small thing for people who are in virtually no danger of coming down with AIDS -- and who, whatever they say, well know that they are in no such danger -- to make a show of cheering on those who are unlikely to escape it. Under ordinary circumstances, the word for such a show would be cruelty. It is not altogether unlike the behavior of the crowds that gather and watch with bated breath when someone threatens to jump from the ledge of a tall building: whatever such behavior signifies, we could certainly not call it compassion.

<p>Is it, then, that their self-styled friends and sympathizers among the heterosexuals subconsciously wish for homosexuals to die -- much as those crowds subconsciously wish for the figure perched on the high ledge to jump? The answer is of course no. Doubly no: nothing so horrible and nothing so simple. But what they are almost certainly up to is something no less difficult to admit to themselves. For the one unmentionable thing that AIDS has accomplished is to make sex dangerous, and hence important, again.

<p>It would seem that human beings cannot for too long abide our present-day toleration for, and openness to, the possibility of mindless, effortless copulation. It enervates them, and leaves them with an unpleasant sensation of floating, of, as Milan Kundera so perfectly called it, ``the unbearable lightness of being.''

<p>Among heterosexuals, until only the day before yesterday, the ever-present threat or possibility of pregnancy made sex important -- dangerous, even. Now with effective contraception and easy-come-easy-go abortion, what is there to supply the sense of consequence? Under the old anti-promiscuity dispensation, men used to dream of sex without bother, without the burdensome necessities of entanglement. Ironically, what heterosexual men have always dreamed of -- or rather, daydreamed of -- is precisely what homosexual men used to have. In any case, as quickly became evident in those singles bars that served for a time as the local soviets of the sexual revolution, the heterosexual men did not thrive on being granted what they had so much wanted. (About their women, don't even ask.)

<p>In the case of the homosexuals, liberalism deprived them, too, of a good deal of that which had for so long lent consequence to their sex lives, namely, danger -- the danger of exposure and danger from the cops. They came out of the closet and marched in the streets with police protection, and yet seemed to grow ever more shrill and restless.

<p>Now there is AIDS, and there is consequence for them indeed.

<p>The good burghers who don their hiking clothes and go on fundraising walks ``for,'' as they put it, AIDS, the people who fill concert halls and theaters for benefit performances dedicated to AIDS, will tell you one of the reasons they are doing so is that unless a cure is found, we will soon all be at risk. Yet they know that they are not at risk; in 15 years they have seen only a handful of proper, well-off heterosexuals like themselves come down with the disease. Like Tom Hanks, they are play-acting.

<p>``For the rich to play at being poor,'' says a character in Lillian Hellman's <i>Toys in the Attic</i>, ``is a dirty game.'' For the healthy to pretend that they are in imminent danger of fatal illness is even dirtier. There are easier and more honest, though admittedly less popular, ways of trying to call off the sexual revolution.

<p>As for the homosexuals, the only true act of human fellowship with them would be to shake them by their collective shoulders and say over and over again: Cut that out!

<P>



ON THE RIGHT / Wm. F. Buckley Jr.


<br>

NEW YORK, OCTOBER 24
<p>Fifty years of the United Nations certainly does not bring on undifferentiated congratulations. The world organization received a jump start on hypocrisy when, in San Francisco, on a motion that Sweden, Switzerland, and Ireland be admitted, the ruling was negative, on the grounds that they were not ``peace-loving nations.'' They were three countries that had not gone to war. But the term ``peace-loving'' had already got into the hands of the wordsmiths who gave us the ``Democratic Republic of Germany,'' which was Soviet-speak for undemocratic unrepublican East Germany. 

<p>In the Security Council we had from the outset the Soviet Union as a permanent member with veto rights, and then China, with the same rights. And in the General Assembly, with spooky consistency the Third World powers voted against Western measures, in line with Soviet measures. When in 1960 Fidel Castro, freshly arrived in power, visited the UN, he was hailed as a hero. In 1979, after he had clearly established himself as a ruler as tyrannical as those who presided over North Korea and Albania, he visited the United Nations again; and, again, was treated as a hero by the majority of its members. 

<p>On Sunday, President Clinton opened the celebratory proceedings by giving a moderate speech about this and that. Later in the day, Castro spoke -- the usual tirade against Western conventions, larded with the usual declamations in favor of self-government everywhere except in Cuba -- and got an ovation. Much heavier applause than that given to the President of the host country, our old friend, the superpower, Uncle Sam. 

<p>We pause to note that one reason for the anti-U.S. fever within the UN these days is our failure to pay our debt to the UN. When the organization was founded, President Truman accepted an imposition on the U.S. of 40 per cent of the UN's budget. In the immediate postwar world that was not an unreasonable allocation, given that we were at the time generating about 50 per cent of the world's production. In 1972 we reduced our share to 25 per cent, in line with the reviving economic fortunes of other countries. But in 1982 we began to stall on our payments, in part because we thought the allocations for peace-keeping expenses were rigged against us, in part because the relevant committees in Congress found it tempting to economize at the expense of an organization not all that popular back home.

<p>But the result of it is a very considerable embarrassment. If the State Department believes we are unfairly burdened, then that case should be made. But to make it by simply refusing to pay is to act the deadbeat. We are not alone in lateness in paying our share, but we are the major offender and certainly the most conspicuous. It would be nice to hear from the presidential candidates that they don't go for cheating on obligations, whether to the American Express Company or to the United Nations.

<p>The pointed objective of Fidel Castro this time around is to generate pressure to repeal the U.S. embargo. It is nice to see the tatterdemalion prince of universal prosperity through Marxism begging U.S. business to come on down and give him a hand. And on the merits of the argument, there is every reason to restore relations with Cuba given that it is no longer a salient of a global power seeking the overthrow of the United States. We would need to swallow our pride, but then that is healthy: we did not succeed in bringing Castro down, and it is not dignified to salve our bad consciences by continuing policies appropriate only during the Cold War. We are trading with Vietnam and China, and we never really broke off from trading with the Soviet Union, so why Castro?

<p>He made his demonstration at the UN, and sharply, and sadly, reminded us all that if the division within the UN were once again suddenly to return to Communist superpower challenging Western superpower, we'd almost certainly find ourselves face to face with the old lineup. About 80 per cent anti-American. The old juices run strong, anti-, and jealous of, success; there are memories mired in anti-colonialist slogans, and then, too, some defensible skepticism over U.S. leadership. 

<p>But the UN is with us. We should pay our debt, ignore most of its pieties, and make policy as we have always made it, soliciting UN sanction but quite prepared, when necessary, to ignore it.

<P>



Deconstruction, American-Style

<p>
<li>Much of this issue is devoted, in one way or another, to race. But then, so is much of American politics. The 
combination of the O.J. verdict and the Million Man March has shifted it to the forefront of politics again, 
temporarily overshadowing even Medicare.
<p>
As so often, however, the lessons being drawn from these events are the opposite of any reasonable 
conclusion. One subtle suggestion, as Mark Cunningham points out, is that the ``attack'' on affirmative 
action is responsible for the signs of increasing division between the races. 
This might be plausible if there had been signs of growing racial harmony before November 1994. In fact, 
as Paul Craig Roberts and Lawrence M. Stratton show, racial divisions have been steadily growing in step 
with the increasing scope, enforcement, and blatancy of the racial quotas at the heart of affirmative action. 
Nor is that curious. Race-conscious policies make people conscious of race.
It is alarming, however, that such race-consciousness has now reached the point where many black 
Americans have begun to think of themselves as a separate nation -- a kind of black English-speaking 
Quebec scattered across the American continent.<p>
That is, after all, the candid agenda of the Nation of Islam, of the Million Man March which it sponsored, 
and of influential black scholars and professionals who devote much ingenuity to constitutional schemes 
that would replace majority rule with cantonal democracy, racial vetoes, ``concurrent majorities,'' and 
various forms of racial proportionality.<p>
Until now, such ``fancy franchises'' have been waystations on the road to majority rule (as in South Africa). 
Will America be the first case in which they lead away from it? The question sounds far-fetched. So did the 
idea of racial quotas when Congress passed the Civil Rights Act.
America is now faced with two theories about itself: either it is a single people or it is a federation of many 
peoples. If the former, it will eliminate racial quotas and downplay race-consciousness generally in favor of 
an inclusive American identity. If the latter, it will move gradually toward racial proportionalism and its 
own deconstruction.<p>
These possibilities are incarnated in two men. Colin Powell embodies the inclusive concept of the American 
whose race is a secondary identity, Louis Farrakhan that of the black who has rejected the accident of being 
born American.<p>
Mr. Farrakhan argues his case forcefully; Mr. Powell does not yet seem to know there's a war on.
<p>


<li>Deconstructionism has been the theme of much speculation on the O.J. verdict. It has been claimed 
incessantly that black Americans, on and off the jury, ``saw'' the evidence differently because they brought 
their own experiences (of police brutality, etc.) to the judgment. Since whites had a different experience, 
black and white ``truths'' were different. And never the twain shall meet.
All this is the greatest nonsense. It denies that there is such a thing as truth or objective reality. Indeed, it 
logically implies that Simpson could be both guilty and innocent of his wife's murder -- depending upon 
who's reaching the verdict.<p>
But it is the identical argument used to justify ``diversity'' in the newsrooms of the mainstream press. As the 
diversity-mongers put it, we need black, Hispanic, lesbian, gay, etc. perspectives on the news. 
Of course, they don't know their own theories. Any competent Parisian deconstructionist could tell them 
that you can safely have a newsroom staffed by live white males because the readers create the texts (i.e., 
write the newspapers) by their own interpretations.<p>
Still, think of the Washington Post and the New York Times as newspapers specially tailored to the 
demands of the crowds who celebrated Mr. Simpson's acquittal.  -- JOHN O'SULLIVAN

06-November-1995

<P> 

 
 
<p><li>Watch for our analysis of Louis Farrakhan's speech at the Million Man March, as soon as he finishes it. 
 
<p><li>Was President Clinton coaching him? 
 
<p><li>The conventional wisdom on the march stresses the dignity and decency of most of the men there, and says 
it's too bad that its main political effect will be to enshrine the noxious Louis Farrakhan as black America's 
most significant political leader. All that is true. And any crowd that boos Rep. John Conyers off the stage 
can't be all bad. Conservatives will even be tempted to praise Farrakhan's message of self-reliance and 
middle-class values as a revolt against the social liberalism of the welfare state. But to indulge blacks as 
they follow the lead of a hatemonger is condescending: adults have to be held responsible for their 
affiliations. And their revolt against liberalism is anyway incomplete. In favoring racial separatism, the 
Nation of Islam has taken ideas long favored by the liberal establishment -- separately tracked school 
admissions, racial employment criteria, segregated campus dormitories and congressional districts -- to their 
illogical conclusion. President Clinton is wrong to describe Farrakhan's bigotry as merely ``one man's 
message of malice and division.'' It is incidental neither to his program nor to his appeal to many black 
Americans. Both the uplifting and the ugly sides of Farrakhan's movement flow from an ideology that posits 
blacks as aliens, as members of a proud and separate polity. Farrakhan does not think blacks should wear 
America's uniform or be subject to America's laws, or that non-blacks should own property or run 
businesses in black neighborhoods. The only antidote to this message is the cultivation of an overarching 
sense of an American identity. It will not be promoted by merely biting our lips as Farrakhan becomes a 
power broker in American politics. 
 
<p><li>According to the Washington Times, one rebellious -- we hope -- soul held up a placard that read: ``ELECT 
FARRAKHAN - SIMPSON.'' 
 
<p><li>The campaign to end the income tax continues to gain momentum on Capitol Hill. Reps. Dan Schaefer (R., 
Colo.) and Billy Tauzin (R., La.) have drafted legislation to replace the personal-income, corporate-income, 
capital-gains, and estate taxes with a 16 per cent national sales tax. Not to be outdone, freshman Rep. Joe 
Scarborough of Florida is working on a 10 per cent national sales tax to replace the personal-income tax. To 
those who argue that ending the income tax for good would require repealing the Sixteenth Amendment, 
Rep. Sam Johnson (R., Tex.) has proposed a new constitutional amendment: ``Three years after the 
ratification of this article of amendment, the Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States 
is repealed, and the Congress shall have no power to lay and collect taxes on incomes except in times of 
war.'' Let the Court find the penumbras in that one. 
 
<p><li>President Clinton will soon issue a statement vowing to devote the rest of his life to searching for the real 
killer of the Democratic Party. 
 
<p><li>Under assault for its aggressive agenda, the Legal Services Corporation has been portraying itself as an 
essential provider of legal services to the poor. However, in a recent Capital Research Center newsletter, 
David Wilkinson, inspector general of the LSC from 1989 to 1991, opens a new line of attack, writing that 
``sufficient resources exist to provide legal assistance to the poor without LSC.'' Turns out that more than 
500,000 lawyers contribute nearly 25 million hours a year of pro bono work valued at an estimated $3.4 
billion; this is five times the number of hours worked by LSC attorneys, and eight times the LSC budget. 
The LSC complains that these numbers are too high because they include attorneys who work individually 
rather than through an organization -- although the poor represented by such attorneys surely are 
unconcerned by the difference. These lawyers are also criticized for doing pro bono work that is 
``traditional'' rather than ``controversial.'' In other words, non-LSC lawyers perform the traditional purpose 
of helping poor people, rather than the controversial one of blocking welfare reform and harassing 
employers. 
 
<p><li>Sen. Sam Nunn won't run for re-election in '96, the eighth Democratic incumbent to take a pass. The Iraqi 
army had fewer deserters during the Gulf War. 
 
<p><li>The number of Americans living in poverty declined in 1994. The bad news is that for an economy 
performing so well, the decline -- from 15.1 to 14.5 per cent -- was pitifully small. But is the news really so 
bad? The government's poverty statistics don't count in-kind transfers like food stamps and housing 
subsidies, and they overstate inflation. Income is a famously misleading indicator of need; cf. the banker's 
son who enters the ranks of the poor by moving out of Dad's estate. Nearly 40 per cent of all ``poor'' 
Americans own their homes. Economists who study these issues have developed an alternative poverty 
measure, one based on what people actually consume rather than the money they take in. Consumption 
poverty fell steadily throughout the 1980s. The reputed failure of Reaganomics to ``lift all boats'' seems 
rooted in statistical malpractice. Surely the poverty industry will embrace this more accurate, and more 
hopeful, analytic prism. Well, maybe not. 
 
<p><li>Willie Brown recently encouraged students to, ``basically, just terrorize'' Professor Glynn Custred, co-
author of the California Civil Rights Initiative, which would outlaw state-sponsored affirmative action. This 
from the other side of the debate. 
 
<p><li>Heard any good economist jokes lately? Here's one: In March 1981, 364 economists wrote the Times of 
London to warn that Margaret Thatcher's economic policies were destroying the economy. The punch line: 
a recent New York Times article detailing the mad dash of foreign investors into Britain. Over the past 
decade Britain has become the preferred European location for the big three Japanese automakers (Nissan, 
Toyota, and Honda) and for large Asian electronics manufacturers such as Samsung and Fujitsu, as well as 
for German and French manufacturers seeking expansion beyond their high-cost home markets. American 
companies, building upon a long tradition, invested 7.5 times more in Britain between 1986 and 1993 than 
in Germany. Thatcherism didn't carry the day without a struggle. For years Europe derided Britain's 
economy as being too much like America's. Translation: Job security was sacrificed to economic growth. 
Now, with French unemployment stuck at 11.5 per cent and German labor costs nearly double Britain's, 
Continental policymakers are wondering whether to emulate the British experience. Tax cuts, privatization, 
and deregulation were important. But the biggest piece of the puzzle, according to a prominent German 
industrialist, was the defanging of the unions. This, of course, was the quintessence of Thatcherism -- unless 
it was ignoring establishment economists. 
 
<p><li>Hillary Rodham Clinton was seen in South America, her hair done in an Evita bun. We hope she gets the 
job down there, but she will probably be back. 
 
<p><li>It could have been worse. The Nobel Peace Prize this year could have gone to Jimmy Carter. Instead it went 
to Joseph Rotblat and the East - West arms-control dialogue that has proceeded for nearly forty years under 
the aegis of the Pugwash conference, named for the town in Nova Scotia where it first met. The Pugwash 
gatherings provided one of the earliest networking opportunities for Western and Soviet scientists and 
academics. Pugwash was innocent enough in theory, though too often a forum of agitation against NATO 
defense policies and U.S. negotiating positions. The timing of the prize -- the 50th anniversary of Hiroshima 
-- was invidious too. But the grinding of molars, audible all the way from Plains, Ga., almost makes up for 
it. 
 
<p><li>The New York State Trial Lawyers Association has people walk every block of New York City recording 
any and all cracks in the sidewalks. By sending this record to the city government, they ensure themselves a 
case whenever someone trips. You can't call it ambulance chasing -- they're there before the ambulance 
arrives. 
 
<p><li>Conservative economists on the far side of 45 have a special advantage when it comes to appreciating 
Nobel Prize - winner Robert Lucas's contribution. They were brought up on Paul Samuelson's Economics, 
which demonstrated, with crystalline examples and simple diagrams, how the right mix of government tax 
and monetary policy could banish the business cycle and ensure prosperity, and they came of age as Walter 
Heller and Gardner Ackley seemed to be proving Samuelson right. But then came the 1970s. 
Unemployment and inflation both rocketed to near record levels, violating the Phillips Curve (Samuelson, 
p. 344), in which higher inflation produces less unemployment. Robert Lucas spotted the flaw: When prices 
rise unexpectedly, producers initially think that things really have gotten better. They hire more workers 
until, as invariably happens, the price rise affects things that they themselves buy -- notably labor. Producers 
eventually come to expect this chain of events and are no longer snookered by changes in monetary policy. 
With this simple insight Lucas showed that Emperor Keynes was naked. His critique became a rallying cry 
for young conservatives chafing under the interventionist consensus. 
 
<p><li>It would be kind of opportunistic, but one way Steve Forbes could protest the capital-gains tax is by leading 
a Millionaire Men's March on Washington. 
 
 
<p><li>Even as congressional committees scrutinize the behavior of the FBI and U.S. Marshals at Ruby Ridge and 
Waco, the Environmental Protection Agency has developed its own ``green'' berets -- 147 gun-toting 
Special Agents with power to use force to seize records and make arrests, without court warrants. Sen. 
Lauch Faircloth (R., N.C.) has written the EPA inquiring by what authority its agents brandished guns in a 
raid on a shrimp farm in Ponce, Puerto Rico, in June 1990. The agents claimed the farm was in violation of 
wetlands regulations and seized the farm's records and some cash. Five years later John Pai White, the 
owner, has yet to get his money or his records back, even though no charges have been brought against him. 
In reply, EPA Administrator Carol Browner pointed to two paragraphs in the 1988 Medical Waste Tracking 
Act that give agents the power ``to carry firearms; execute and serve warrants; and make arrests without 
warrants for the investigation of criminal violations of any law administered by the EPA.'' If that isn't bad 
enough, the EPA's ``Firearms Policies and Procedures'' were approved by Attorney General Janet Reno. It's 
a good thing the EPA wasn't sent to investigate kerosene emissions at Waco, or there might have been a 
three-way shootout. 
 
<p><li>NR senior editor Jeffrey Hart is seeking reparations for the efforts of his forebears to end slavery. One was 
a colonel in the Union Army's artillery. Another took time out from his work as an artist to paint 
documentary murals of battle scenes for the Union Army. Several others served in the federal ranks. Mr. 
Hart will be pleased to receive one dollar from every descendant of former slaves. Reparations may be sent 
to him care of NR.

<P>
The Hangover
<P>
<P>NEW YORK, OCTOBER 5

<P>The brainy wife of the brainy professor said, ``I think the O.J. verdict should be protested.'' The brainy 
professor said, ``How?''
<P>Indeed. How?
<P>The prattle, in which such as Senator Dole are engaged, is that we must accept the verdict and turn over a 
new leaf. Well, it is one thing to accept the verdict as a juridical reality: Nobody is arguing that O. J. 
Simpson should be sent back to jail. It is quite another thing to abide by the superstition that justice has 
been done. A lot of white folks who lynched black folks in the bad days went scot free because white jurors 
wouldn't convict them. But there are those who left that age with their honor intact: they screamed and 
yelled, and insisted that justice was not done. Screaming and yelling doesn't come naturally to a lot of 
people, but the brainy wife of the brainy professor was right, the verdict should be protested. 
<P>One way to do this is to remark the little filigrees on formal acquittal, and resist their effrontery. Johnnie 
Cochran tells the press moments after the verdict that the will of God has been done, as he knew it would 
be. One sighs: someone who can compare Mark Fuhrman to Adolf Hitler can, one supposes, adduce the will 
of God as motivating the jury's finding. Let us in charity assume that the relatives of O.J. sincerely thought 
him to be innocent, and pass over their bulletins to the effect that justice had been done. But what are we to 
make of O.J.'s solemn declaration that, now that the distraction has been swept away, the police should get 
serious and search out the real killer. He, O.J., will do ``whatever it takes'' to identify him. One way to begin 
this search is for everyone to submit a blood sample to the laboratories. And then ask the one out of 28 
million with the telltale blood -- that adds up to about thirty people, sprinkled about in Tibet, Tierra del 
Fuego, and Kazakhstan -- what they were doing on the night of June 12, 1994.
<P>And yes, we really should equip ourselves against hit-and-run self-vindication by legerdemain. Johnnie 
Cochran was on <i>Larry King Live</i> on Wednesday saying what you would expect, the phone rings, and lo! 
O.J. is on the line. He says serene things, and then chastises a woman who had called in to ask Mr. Cochran 
to explain the shadowy creature who had been identified by the limo driver as coming into the Rockingham 
driveway just before 11 the night of the murders. O.J. says, Did the woman not<i> listen</i> to the witness, because 
the witness, if you followed him carefully, had said something quite different, and oh! how much he, O.J., 
had suffered from people drawing conclusions from the testimony which the testifiers had simply not said, 
understand?
<P>It is on the order of rising to say, ``I told you there wasn't a purple cow on the property that night, DID I 
NOT?'' People begin nodding their heads. We are off to the races with the reconstruction of the scene that 
night in June, one little piece at a time. 
<P>What effect will the verdict have on the career of Colin Powell, somebody asked? Answer: One would hope 
none. But there is most definitely a danger there. When 75 per cent of black Americans believe that the 
answer is A, not B, and 75 per cent of white Americans believe that the answer is B, not A, then what we 
have is a breakdown in communication between two cultures. Either we share a common language and a 
common rational apparatus or we do not. It is a very very scary thing when three-quarters of one ethnic 
group flatly disagree with three-quarters of another ethnic group about the structure of rational arguments. It 
is simply wrong to suppose that the white majority believed O.J. to be guilty because he was black. It is 
simply undeniable that the black majority believed him innocent because he was black. And -- remarkably -- 
those figures remained static throughout those endless months of testimony. It was tempting for the white 
majority to conclude that the black majority was engaged in iconolatry. O.J. is a hero and that is the end of 
it. 
<P>Not entirely hard to understand. If the spelunkers were to come up from their caves with evidence that St. 
Francis of Assisi ate live pigeons for breakfast, there are those of us who would simply refuse to believe it. 
Legends, to be legendary, must be sacred, inviolate. But this is not to dodge the question: Yes. If the 
innocence of O.J. is a black postulate, then intercommunication has suffered a quite awful setback.

<HR>
06-November-1995

<P>

<P>IN the 1930s, when James Burnham, later a founding editor of this magazine, was a young professor 
becoming committed to Marxism, he was recruited by Earl Browder, the head of the American Communist 
Party. Browder managed to explain all his party's doctrines but one: its endorsement, as dictated by Stalin's 
latest inspiration, of a separate state in the South for American blacks. Burnham knew that was a non-
starter, and moved on to Trotsky.
<P>How is it that what seemed fantastic sixty years ago, even in the heart of 
the totalitarian Left, can draw a Million Men (give or take a few hundred thousand) to Washington, and 
only ad hominem criticism of the march's sponsors?
<P>There is a black American identity, partly out of free 
choice, partly because centuries of racism have been perversely reinforced by thirty years of misguided 
liberalism. Busing, quotas, affirmative action, wars on poverty (read: black poverty), urban renewal (read: 
inner-city renewal), victimology, multiculturalism, diversity -- all conspire to set blacks apart, not in an 
affirmation of their culture or way of life, but because they are persuaded to feel they have no alternative in 
a racist white-majority America which wishes them ill.
<P>This ``community,'' so artificially maintained and so 
carefully hedged about, is experiencing a vacuum of leadership just now. Jesse Jackson has gone nowhere. 
The Congressional Black Caucus is a bunch of gerrymandered petty chieftains, who lost their institutional 
clout when the GOP took Congress. Black clergymen -- and this is a bad legacy of Martin Luther King -- 
have become what Burke called political theologians and theological politicians, as distracted in their way 
as their soulmates in the pulpits of the white Protestant mainstream. Into this void stepped Louis Farrakhan -
- scenery-chewing orator; leader of a thuggish cult; possible conniver in the murder of Malcolm X; inspired 
by visions from UFOs; expounder of the view that whites are devils produced by a prehistoric experiment in 
dysgenics on the island of Patmos; apologist for slavers, so long as they are Moslems who pay him off. This 
was his march; he was its ``onlie begetter.'' 
<P>But take Farrakhan out of the march -- and Alton Maddox, the 
lawyer who defended the hoaxster Tawana Brawley, and Farrakhan's aide, Khalid Mohammed, who praised 
the racist murderer Colin Ferguson -- and would the march have been the worthy thing that earnest liberals 
claimed?
<P>Self-help is a good thing -- if the self is helped to the right goals. It is not good for blacks to talk up 
economic nationalism (even if they don't use Farrakhan's imagery of ``bloodsuckers'' to describe non-blacks 
who deal in black neighborhoods). Korean storeowners provide services for their customers. If a black 
storeowner wants to provide the service, let him offer a better product or a lower price. If responsibility is 
the goal, why converge on Washington -- fount of the handouts that have done blacks such damage? Yes, 
that's where King marched in 1963 -- but by then, he was calling for welfare-state liberalism too.
<P>The religious revival is an old feature of American life -- older than independence. And celebrations of ethnicity 
have also been welcome, so long as they were combinations of good clean fun and Tocquevillian mediating 
institutions: the Columbus Day parade and the charitable society. There was a lot of this mixed up in the 
Million Man March. But American leaders, both black and white, have to sift it all out, and condemn the 
alloys.
<P>Colin Powell, concluding his book tour cum campaign swing, had an ideal chance to do so, and he 
wimped out. ``Let's let the people at the march make the judgment,'' he told reporters in New York on march 
day. ``Let's trust them to make an informed decision [about] what is wisdom, and what is not wisdom.'' But 
that's what leaders are supposed to do. Instead, he worked at earning back his advance, and becoming 
President-by-coronation.
<P>America will never become two literal nations. But, without hard thinking from 
men who would be leaders, and men who would be millions, we can be a house divided against itself -- and, 
pace Lincoln, such houses can stand, unhappily, for a long, long time.

<FONT SIZE=+3>A</FONT> <font size=+1>generation</font> after the civil-rights movement, Americans are once again engaged in a radical rethinking of their attitudes toward race. Racial preferences are now opposed by the vast majority of Americans; even among blacks, there is a new and vibrant diversity of opinion on the subject. Yet so far no one has questioned the very premises of the discussion. The basic assumption of our current racial debate is still that racism is the theory and discrimination is the practice. Racism is said to be based on ``prejudices,'' which constitute judgments made in the absence of evidence, and ``stereotypes,'' which are grossly misleading generalizations about groups. The obvious solutions, promoted by Martin Luther King and other activists, were twofold: statutes intended to outlaw racial discrimination, and social and educational programs to increase interaction between groups. As whites regularly lived and worked with blacks, their attitudes and actions toward them were expected to undergo a transformation, as ignorant prejudices gave way to enlightened acceptance.
<P>
As a result of these policies, state-sponsored segregation is dead; overt and arbitrary racial discrimination has greatly abated; white attitudes have undergone a revolutionary transformation in favor of equal rights in employment, housing, voting, and education; and there is a large and thriving black middle class. Yet, at the same time, the prevailing civil-rights model, and the laws and policies based on it, now seem irrelevant to contemporary problems, such as the lurid sufferings of the underclass, which have worsened over the past few decades. Consequently the debate seems to have been polarized and stalled by the crosscurrents of white backlash, black rage, and liberal despair. African American scholar Derrick Bell conveys some of the regnant frustration: ``We have made progress in everything, yet nothing has changed.''
<P>
Perhaps one way to gain an enlarged perspective on our current situation is to step back and turn our assumptions into questions. Are there circumstances in which discrimination actually makes sense? Are people who discriminate against people of other races by definition racist? Might prejudices reflect not ignorant predisposition but prudent judgment?
<P><P> 
<font size=+3>T</font><font size=+1>HE</font> problems with the prevailing civil-rights paradigm become evident when we examine the most widely cited contemporary example of racial discrimination -- the refusal of many taxidrivers to pick up young African-American males. In a recent article, Gregory Wright commented in the <I>Washington Post</I>:
<P>
<blockquote>
As an African American, I am fed up with having to flag down five cabs before finding one that will take me home, fed up with feeling anger, embarrassment, and frustration when cabdrivers swear they are off-duty and then pick up a white customer before I can get around the corner. Taxidrivers, many of whom come from Africa, the Caribbean, and the Middle East, say they don't want to pick up African-American passengers because they are afraid of being robbed, assaulted, or murdered. One Nigerian cabdriver told me he only picks up African Americans who are well dressed and look like businessmen. For African Americans, this discrimination can be inconvenient and downright humiliating.</blockquote>
<P>

It is easy to sympathize with the indignation expressed at such flagrant acts of racial discrimination. Yet according to Wright's own account, many of the cabdrivers who are reluctant to pick up young African-American males are themselves African, Caribbean, or Middle Eastern.  Moreover, the Nigerian cited by Wright says explicitly that he will pick up blacks who are suitably dressed. His discrimination seems to be based not simply on skin color but on other aspects of appearance.
<P>
During my travels I took up the issue with a number of taxidrivers in New York, Washington, Chicago, and other cities. Most of them denied that they refuse to pick up every black male, and all ridiculed the notion that cabdrivers pass up black women. But many groused that African-American passengers frequently leave no tip and sometimes beat the fare, and virtually all acknowledged that as a consequence of previous threats, robberies, and assaults they employ a kind of heightened scrutiny before they will stop for a young black man.
<P>
``This racism stuff is all bull --  -- ,'' one African student who was driving to put himself through school, told me. ``I'm not going to pass up a fare, which is money in my pocket. But I don't want to get robbed. You know what the black crime rate is in New York? Do you want me to risk a gun to my head, man? What's wrong with you?''
<P>
A white driver in Chicago told me, ``No exceptions, pal. I never pick up niggers.''
<P>
``You don't like blacks?'' I asked.
<P>
``Not blacks. Niggers.''
<P>
``That sounds like racism to me.''
<P>
``Hey, that's c---- . I pick up older blacks all the time. I have no problem with giving black women a ride. My black buddies won't pick up no niggers. I ain't no more racist than they are.''
<P>
These concerns seem to be borne out by cabdriver muggings and killings. In August 1994, Keith Moore, a 38-year-old cabdriver and single father, was found with the keys in the ignition and two bullet wounds in his head. His friends told the <I>Washington Post</I> that he never worried about picking up passengers in questionable neighborhoods no matter what the time of day. If Moore had exercised prudence, his colleague Louis Richardson said, he probably would be alive today. The U.S. Labor Department recently reported that driving a cab is the riskiest job in America, with occupational homicide rates higher than those for bartenders, gas-station attendants, and policemen.
<P>
These facts suggest how hollow it sounds to accuse cabdrivers of ``prejudice'' and ``stereotypes.'' While we can be sure that racist taxidrivers would discriminate, not all taxidrivers who discriminate are racist.
<P>
<P>
<font size=+3>M</font><font size=+1>ICHELLE</font> Joo, an Asian-American shopkeeper in Washington, D.C., acknowledges that she discriminates based on race. When deciding whether to let people into her jewelry and cosmetics store, she tells the <I>Washington Post</I>, ``I look at the face.'' She won't open the door ``if he looks ugly, if he's holding a bottle in a paper bag, if he's dirty. . . . If some guy looks kind, I let him in.'' Young black men are kept out if they seem rowdy, Miss Joo says. Usually they react by banging on her glass windows. One may say that Michelle Joo has no fixed policy of keeping blacks out. Nor does she have a quota about the number she will admit. Rather, she seems to be a prudent statistician. She employs race as one factor, but not the only factor, in her decision-making. As a means to ensure her security and business survival, she is practicing what may be termed rational discrimination.
<P>
Thousands of other store owners in major cities make similar decisions every day. So do countless women -- black, white, Hispanic, and Asian -- who come across black males in circumstances they consider not entirely safe. Regardless of their general attitudes about civil rights, they do what they feel is necessary in each particular case. Shopkeepers scurry to the front of the store where they can monitor the exit. Female pedestrians may clutch their purse more tightly or cross the street if approached by one or more young black men. Sometimes people snap the locks on their car doors as African-American youths walk by.
<P>
The psychological toll of such reactions is high. If you are black, columnist William Raspberry says, it is unusual to find yourself treated as an individual, and to receive the kind of consideration that whites expect. In <I>The Rage of a Privileged Class</I>, Ellis Cose describes a typical justification for black rage: ``Why am I constantly treated as if I were a drug addict, a thief, or a thug?'' Many who echo these sentiments also question the basis for group judgments about blacks. Legal scholar Charles Ogletree argues that ``99 per cent of black people don't commit crimes.''
<P>
Blacks make up approximately 12 per cent of the nation's population. Yet according to Uniform Crime Reports, published annually by the FBI, blacks account for 39 per cent of those arrested for aggravated assault, 42 per cent of those arrested for weapons possession, 43 per cent of those arrested for rape, 55 per cent of those arrested for murder, and 61 per cent of those arrested for robbery. Even discounting for the possibility of some racial bias in criminal arrests, it seems clear that the average black person is between three and six times as likely to be arrested for a crime as the average white person.
<P>
Young black males are arrested and convicted of crimes at an astonishingly high rate. According to the Sentencing Project, a liberal advocacy group, about 25 per cent of young black men in America are in prison, on probation, or on parole on any given day. For whites, the figure is 6 per cent. In major cities, the figures for young black men are even higher.
<P>
Jesse Jackson acknowledged the cultural pathology of violence among inner-city blacks when he said, ``There is nothing more painful for me than to walk down the street and hear footsteps and start to think about robbery, and then see it's somebody white and feel relieved.'' Faced with immediate criticism from other black activists, Jackson hurried to ``clarify'' his views and deny that he meant what he said. But several African-American scholars have made the same point. Johnnetta Cole writes that among black women ``one of the most painful admissions I hear is: I am afraid of my own people.'' Given black crime rates, Howard University education professor Kenneth Tollett says, ``The statements we have called stereotypes in the past have become true.''
<P>
Personally I would be angry and upset if, as a law-abiding person, I were routinely treated as a criminal by taxidrivers, storekeepers, or pedestrians. Yet, equally predictably, taxidrivers, storekeepers, and women who clutch their purses or cross the street will attach little significance to such personal and historical sensitivities. Such people are unlikely to be intimidated by accusations of prejudice. For them, the charges are meaningless, because the prejudice is warranted. In this context, a bigot is simply a sociologist without credentials.
<P><P>
<font size=+3>I</font><font size=+1>T IS</font> now time to examine with fresh eyes the meaning of familiar terms such as prejudice and stereotype, which underlie the conventional liberal understanding of racism. African-American scholar Henry Louis Gates writes: ``Racism exists when one generalizes about attributes of an individual, and treats him or her accordingly.'' Gates offers some specific examples: ``You people sure can dance,'' and ``Black people play basketball so remarkably well.'' He concludes, ``These are racist statements.'' But are they?
<P>
In his classic work, <I>The Nature of Prejudice</I>, published in 1954, Gordon Allport drew on modern social-science theories to explicate the paradigm of liberal anti-racism.  Allport argued that prejudices and stereotypes reveal less about their objects than their subjects. Applying such concepts as displacement and frustration-aggression theory, Allport maintained that when people feel hostility and anger which they have difficulty coping with, they project it onto others, who thus become sacrificial victims or ``scapegoats.'' Allport helped to establish a premise that many social scientists continue to hold today: prejudices and stereotypes endure because of the principle of self-selection. From the distorted perspective of the racist, blacks who do not conform to preconceived notions simply do not exist; they are, in Ralph Ellison's term, invisible men.
<P>
For the better part of a generation, this liberal understanding of racism worked fairly well. The reason was that both whites and blacks had indeed developed many erroneous views about each other as a consequence of the social isolation produced by Southern segregation. During slavery the races stayed in regular, even intimate, contact, but after emancipation the forced separation of the races created a divided society in which dubious and even absurd generalizations could endure, unchecked by contrary experience. The civil-rights movement's assault on prejudices and stereotypes, as well as the experience of desegregation, helped to topple many such group generalizations that could not withstand empirical examination.
<P>
The problem with the liberal paradigm is its premise that <I>all</I> group perceptions are misperceptions. Paradoxically it is desegregation and integration which have called the liberal view into question. One of the risks of increased exposure to blacks is that it has placed whites in a position to discover which of their preconceived views are true.
<P>
In fact ethnic groups which have had little history of oppressing each other now seem to be formulating clear and often critical images of other groups. In one of the more remarkable surveys of recent years, the National Conference of Christians and Jews reports that many minority groups harbor much more hostile attitudes toward other minority groups than whites do. For example, 49 per cent of blacks and 68 per cent of Asians said that Hispanics ``tend to have bigger families than they can support.'' Forty-six per cent of Hispanics and 42 per cent of blacks agreed that Asian  Americans are ``unscrupulous, crafty, and devious in business.'' And 53 per cent of Asians and 51 per cent of Hispanics affirmed that blacks ``are more likely to commit crimes and violence.''
<P>
It is, of course, possible that these minority perceptions reveal that, by a kind of social osmosis, everyone is learning racism from whites. But if so, why would minority perceptions be stronger than those of whites who are the alleged racists par excellence? More likely, these intergroup minority perceptions are the product of experience. Most people today have fairly regular contact with others of different races, and have many opportunities to verify their collective judgments about other groups.
<P>
During my speaking trips to college campuses, I decided, as a journalistic exercise, to test people's perception of group traits by raising the question of whether stereotypes may be true and prejudices based on them therefore legitimate. Inevitably, I encountered strong emotional opposition. Educated people today have been taught to despise group generalizations. In a sense, we have been raised to be prejudiced against prejudice.
<P>
Recently on a West Coast campus, I raised the question of whether, as a group, ``blacks have rhythm.'' A professor of Afro-American Studies insisted, ``Absolutely not,'' and a number of white students readily agreed. Instinctively, they raised the familiar defenses, ``I know a black man who can't dance.'' ``How can you generalize about a group that is so diverse?'' ``What about Elvis? He had rhythm, and he wasn't black,'' and so on. I pointed out that these were poor refutations of a proposition that was being offered as true on average, or compared with the experience of other groups. One cannot rebut the statistically irrefutable statement that men on average are taller than women by producing a six-foot woman and a four-foot man. Those individuals would merely constitute exceptions to a general pattern that has persisted across cultures for most of recorded history.
<P>
Incidentally, the view that blacks tend to be more rhythmic than whites is no whimsical recent invention but is supported by observation and experience in several cultures over two millennia. In ancient Greece and Rome, which held no negative view of black skin color, Ethiopians and other blacks were celebrated for a perceived natural inclination to music and dance. This is a central theme of that segment of Greek and Roman art which focuses on blacks. Moreover, the same perception of blacks is evident in many Arab descriptions of African blacks written in the late Middle Ages. Ibn Butlan, for example, writes that if a black man was dropped from heaven ``he would beat time as he goes down.'' The Muslim historian Ibn Khaldun attributed the black African proclivity for music to the relaxing influence of the sun's heat.
<P>
On one point the liberal paradigm about group generalizations is sound: people's perceptions of others are always filtered through the lens of their own prior experience. But the liberal understanding cannot explain how particular traits come to be identified with particular groups. Only because group traits have an empirical basis in shared experience can we invoke them without fear of serious contradiction. Think how people would react if someone said, ``Koreans are lazy,'' or ``Hispanics are constantly trying to find ways to make money.'' Despite the prevalence of anti-Semitism, Jews are rarely accused of stupidity. Blacks are never accused of being tight with a dollar, or of conspiring to take over the world. By reversing stereotypes we can see how their persistence relies, not simply on the assumptions of the viewer, but also on the characteristics of the group being described.
<P>
This is no case for group traits having a biological foundation. Probably the vast majority of group traits are entirely cultural, the distilled product of many years of shared experience. Yet prejudices and stereotypes are not intended to explain the origins of group traits, only to take into account their existence. Nor is this an argument to emphasize negative traits. Stereotypes can be negative or positive. Indeed the same stereotype can be interpreted favorably or unfavorably. One can deplore Roman machismo or admire Roman manliness; deride Spanish superstition or exalt Spanish piety; ridicule English severity or cherish English self-control. In each of these interpretations, we see a single set of facts, a different set of values.
<P>
William Helmreich, in <I>The Things They Say Behind Your Back</I>, takes up the issue of whether there is a rational basis for group stereotypes. Helmreich finds some stereotypes that are clearly false. During the Middle Ages, for example, apparently many Christians took religious polemic literally and came to believe that Jews have horns. Clearly this was not a perception destined to last: one has only to encounter a few Jews to discover that they do not, in fact, possess horns.
<P>
Helmreich takes up other stereotypes, however, such as the view that many Nobel laureates are Jewish, or that the Mafia is largely made up of Italians, or that the Japanese tend to be xenophobic and nationalistic, or that many Irishmen and American Indians drink enormous quantities of alcohol. Basically Helmreich finds that these perceptions are confirmed by the data. Of all the stereotypes he considers, Helmreich concludes that ``almost half the stereotypes have a strong factual basis.''
<P>
Thus the liberal assumptions that groups do not differ and that group generalizations are irrational turn out to be wrong. Indeed they generate a civil-rights paradigm which is at variance with most people's direct observation of the world. We would do better to acknowledge the reality of group traits and ask how we should act on it.
<P><P>

<font size=+3>R</font><font size=+1>ATIONAL</font> discrimination is not limited to the exasperating but relatively inconsequential actions of taxidrivers and storekeepers; it is also quite pervasive in other areas, notably hiring.
<P>
In one of the most famous demonstrations of the persistence of hiring discrimination, in 1991 the Urban Institute sent ten black and ten white testers to apply for a range of private-sector jobs in Chicago and Washington, D.C. The testers were matched in pairs with very similar appearances, deportments, and credentials. The Institute found that in 67 per cent of cases neither candidate received a job offer; in 13 per cent, both did; in 15 per cent, only the white tester received an offer; and in 5 per cent, only the black tester did.
<P>
Although these results hardly prove, as the Institute concluded, that racial discrimination against blacks is ``widespread and entrenched,'' they do suggest that it continues to exist. Curiously, however, the Institute study found that white and black employers were equally likely to discriminate. This suggests the possibility that discrimination persists because in some cases it is efficient; it makes economic sense.
<P>
Conventional economic theory holds that arbitrary racial discrimination is economically costly. The reason was explained years ago by economist Gary Becker: employers who refuse to hire the best person for the job are likely to suffer relative to their competition. Even discrimination based on arbitrary features such as race can be profitable, however, when the cost of discrimination is lower than the transaction cost of evaluating candidates individually.
<P>
Consider the case of a chain of stores seeking to hire entry-level workers recruited mainly from the local high-school. Let us assume, further, that African Americans as a group have substantially higher crime rates than whites, Hispanics, or Asians. Employers could disregard this fact and carefully scrutinize the individual history and character of each applicant. This would certainly be the ideal course of action. But employers, who are in business to make a profit, may reason that entry-level jobs do not warrant the expenditure of time and effort to investigate every applicant's personal history. The employer may save transaction costs by simply keeping the number of blacks hired to a minimum.
<P>
That the discrimination unearthed by the Urban Institute study was probably rational is suggested by its finding that the race of the interviewer showed no correlation with the likelihood of engaging in discrimination. Discrimination practiced equally by white and black employers is likely to be discrimination that does not depend on racist intentions, but rather applies the logic of predictive evaluation, discriminating against people in high-risk categories. Race is not being singled out here: employers may have similar rational reasons for their reluctance to hire women, who may get pregnant and leave, or the elderly, who are more likely to fall ill, or young people, who may prove less reliable as employees.
<P>
In Chicago, one of the sites of the Urban Institute study, Joleen Kirschenman and Kathryn Neckerman interviewed employers about their motives for hiring and found support for the rational-discrimination hypothesis.<br>

 -- In general, one construction-company owner said, for urban blacks ``the quality of education is not as great as white folk from the suburbs, and it shows.''<br>
 -- Another employer remarked, ``The Polish immigrants that I know are more highly motivated than the Hispanics.''<br>
 -- One manufacturer said, ``We are not shutting out any black specifically, but I will say that our experience has been bad.''<P>
The authors conclude that employers are using race as a proxy for ``aspects of productivity that are relatively expensive or impossible to measure.'' Many employers do seem to recognize diversity among blacks, often describing a particular individual as a good prospect, ``the exception to the rule.'' Nevertheless, employers do use group generalizations, so that in Kirschenman and Neckerman's view, ``black job applicants, unlike their white counterparts, must indicate to employers that the stereotypes do not apply to them.''
<P>
Rational discrimination may be difficult to understand in hiring, yet its economic justification is obvious in other areas. Insurance companies, for example, have no special dislike for teenage boys, but they charge them higher rates than female and older drivers. This is very unfair to an individual teenage boy who is a skilled and cautious driver, because he is penalized on account of the statistical habits of a group he did not voluntarily join. Yet even with reasonably thorough personal information, companies are not in a good position to predict individual behavior.
<P>
<font size=+3>I</font><font size=+1>S</font> discrimination based on race necessarily racist? Not if you define racism as a doctrine of intrinsic superiority and inferiority, which leads to judgments against a group on grounds of biology rather than conduct. Indeed, the existence of rational discrimination compels us to revise the liberal paradigm which holds that racism is the theory and discrimination is the practice. The two may be unconnected. It is possible to be a racist and not discriminate: this would be true of many poor and marginalized whites who might hate blacks and consider them inferior, but who are not in a position to enforce their convictions. So too it is possible to discriminate and not be a racist: this would constitute rational discrimination.
<P>
Just because discrimination can be rational, however, does not mean that it is always moral. When individuals and companies make decisions not to go to great lengths to ensure that they are not misjudging any particular person, they are sacrificing the just treatment of individuals at the altar of security, convenience, or profits. Even though such judgments may be prudent and realistic, they are not, strictly speaking, fair. Rational discrimination based on unalterable traits is problematic in a way that discrimination against high-school dropouts and convicted felons is not.
<P>
Thus the question of whether rational discrimination should be legal is a real one. The new public-policy dilemma is based on the recognition that discrimination sometimes makes practical sense, and that such discrimination forces a choice in which the claims of morality are on one side, and the claims of rationality and productivity are on the other.
<P>
We have, in fact, three models of how to deal with the persistence of discrimination. The first is affirmative action. Some advocates, such as legal scholar David Strauss, argue that racial preferences are an essential remedy for rational discrimination. Yet this argument is specious. After all, rational discrimination is objectionable because it treats competent individuals as incompetent on account of their involuntary membership in a disfavored group. This is hardly remedied by racial preferences which treat comparatively incompetent individuals as competent on account of their membership in a favored group.
<P>
The second approach is to make all discrimination, including rational discrimination, illegal in the public and private sector. This was Martin Luther King's solution, and it remains attractive to most Americans. Yet such a solution, although a vast improvement over the current system of racial preferences, would require massive state intervention in the private sector to unmask and punish discriminators, including minority firms which prefer to hire members of their own group, and other employers whose only sin amounts to engaging in rational behavior.
<P>
Then there is a third, and venerable option which was once considered liberal, but which has been virtually forgotten. In a free society, which maintains a distinction between the private and public sphere, rational discrimination is far more problematic when perpetrated by institutions of government than by private individuals and institutions. The reason is that in a democracy the government is responsible to all its citizens, who have a right to demand that they be treated as individuals equally under the law. Thus a new option emerges: the government should be strictly race-neutral, but private actors would be free to discriminate. In this scenario, rational discrimination would be legal, and so would private-sector affirmative action.
<P>
I can already hear the gasps of civil-rights activists, who are so wedded to the paradigm of old struggles that they cannot see what is obvious to the generation born after the civil-rights movement: Bull Connor is dead, and the <I>ancien r&#233gime</I> is finished. True, there will be employers who will refuse to hire blacks, and some may even post signs that say ``No African Americans Need Apply.'' So what? Irrational discrimination of this sort is harmful only when it is comprehensive in scope -- when everyone discriminates. On the other hand, if only some employers discriminate, then competitive markets impose the main financial cost of discrimination on the discriminator, where it belongs.
<P>
Thus we arrive at a supreme irony: perhaps the best way to save affirmative action is to abolish the civil-rights laws, or rather, to limit their employment provisions to government conduct. This would be not a repudiation of the civil-rights movement but its natural fulfillment. Only such a bold strategy establishes a framework of state-neutrality and personal freedom that permits citizens of all backgrounds to pursue their competing utopias, and offers a realistic way out of our current thicket.

<LI>John Paul II's book tour will be less extensive than Colin Powell's, and rightly so: he is only the Vicar of Christ.

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>



<LI>Do people, and the businesses they form, have a presumptive right to the money they earn? Or do they get to keep some portion of it only as a favor from the Federal Government? That's the question at issue in a dispute over the meaning of the term ``corporate welfare'' -- and astonishingly enough, the usually sound conservative Rep. Bill Archer (R., Tex.) is on the wrong side of it. The chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee wants to eliminate about sixty business tax preferences over the next seven years to help balance the budget. But to end a tax break without reducing tax rates amounts to a tax increase -- which, political junkies might recall, Republicans are supposed to be against. If Congress really wants to attack ``corporate welfare,'' it should abolish the Export - Import Bank, agribusiness subsidies, and tariffs. Giving other people's money to select businesses is welfare; letting them keep more of their own is not.

<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>



<LI>House Republican efforts to dismantle the Legal Services Corporation (LSC) are in danger of falling victim to the McCollum syndrome, an illness marked by the eager willingness to accept half-a-loaf legislation that afflicts the chronically behind-the-curve Florida Republican. Bill McCollum, joined by Judiciary Committee Democrats, failed in his bid to scrap at the committee level a proposal by George Gekas (R., Pa.) to block-grant LSC funds to the states. But McCollum did succeed in increasing funding for LSC and stretching it out over several years. Conservatives rightly consider this a betrayal of the deal the House leadership cut earlier this year to end LSC funding after two years. McCollum explains: ``The very essence of being a conservative is a desire to preserve the underpinnings of the democratic system, and this [the LSC] is one of them.'' The House leadership hopes to strip the weakening amendments out of the legislation on the floor. Senator Phil Gramm, meanwhile, managed to get a tough Gekas-like bill out of committee, but faces a possible stiff challenge on the Senate floor (perhaps led by Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici). The upshot of all this may eventually be that the LSC gets the axe. But in Washington these days nothing pays like revolutionary skepticism.

<LI>The first contributor to the ``If I Were President'' column in <I>George</I> magazine was Madonna. Yeah, it was frivolous -- but Steve Forbes has less money, and Arlen Specter has the same positions on social issues.

<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>



<LI>From a shoebox in Pat Robertson's garage to a 1.7-million-member organization. From political outcasts  -- ``poor, uneducated, easy to command,'' as the <I>Washington Post</I> once put it -- to presidential kingmakers. The Christian Coalition celebrated a political passage at its annual ``Road to Victory'' conference in Washington. All the GOP presidential candidates -- except Pete Wilson and the uninvited Arlen Specter -- were there to tout their social-conservative credentials. And Robertson could quote a recent article describing the Coalition as the dominant force in 18 state Republican parties -- and counting. ``We have gained what we have always sought,'' declared Executive Director Ralph Reed. ``A place at the table.'' The transformation of evangelical Protestants into a powerful, impossible-to-ignore electoral bloc -- by one estimate the Coalition mobilized 4 million activists and 50 million voters last year -- will keep ``the culture'' front and center in American politics. Of course some fear the GOP's becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Pat Robertson -- a groundless fear when Catholics, Jews, non-evangelical Protestants, and hard-headed agnostics account for more than half of the <I>conservative</I> coalition. Perhaps a more likely danger is the Christian Coalition's becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of a GOP which will not always behave as the Coalition would like. A place at the table is worth having only if on occasion you can walk away from it.

<LI>A new nationwide poll conducted by Adams Research for <I>Talk Daily</I> flattens the media myth that talk-radio listeners are rednecks and morons. The survey finds that listeners have higher annual incomes than the national average, are twice as likely to be college graduates, and are politically active (92 per cent are registered voters). A whopping two-thirds of listeners regard talk radio as an ``important source of political information and ideas.'' And they're everywhere: one in six Americans has listened to Rush et al. in the last 48 hours, three out of ten in the past week. Such talk is music to our ears.

<LI>One advantage the Left has long enjoyed is its ability to get funds coercively, in the form of tax dollars and compulsory union dues. Since last year's elections, taxpayer funds have permitted the advocacy Left (e.g., groups like the National Council of Senior Citizens, 90 per cent federally funded) to fight the new majority's agenda on the balanced budget, Medicare savings, and welfare reform. Conservative freshmen in the House are eager to strip the Left of that advantage. Their vehicle is the Istook - McIntosh - Ehrlich amendment, an appropriations rider that would prohibit non-profit organizations that receive federal grants from spending more than 5 per cent of their budgets on lobbying. Liberal special interests have fought back ferociously, enlisting prestigious organizations like the YMCA, the March of Dimes, and the American Red Cross to lead the battle. And the strategy has worked with liberal Republicans, to the extent that Arlen Specter stripped the rider out of the HHS/Labor appropriations bill, and Mark Hatfield and James Jeffords are resisting efforts to attach it to the Treasury/Postal appropriations bill. Now, however, scores of freshmen have indicated that they will vote against the bill unless it includes the rider. The House leadership may not understand this freshman intransigence. The people back home will.

<LI>Democrats were indignant when Republicans issued a ``Wanted'' poster with pictures of Democratic politicians, including many women and minorities. Now Majority '96, a Democratic group, has compiled a list of 33 House seats it's targeting in the next election, including those of Gary Franks, Andrea Seastrand, Linda Smith, Helen Chenoweth, and J. C. Watts. That's one-fifth of the Republican women (and almost half the conservative women) in Congress, and 100 per cent of the black Republicans. A coincidence, we're sure.

<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>



<LI>House leaders traditionally refrain from making presidential-primary endorsements. Majority Leader Dick Armey broke that tradition by announcing his support for Phil Gramm, saying that he could not inflict another Bush Administration on his children. So Gramm has swept the economists in Congress.

<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>



<LI>It was the first rumpus of the Age of Newt. After being sworn in as Speaker, Mr. Gingrich appointed Christina Jeffrey, a former colleague from Georgia academic life, to be House Historian. Democrats spotted a critical 1986 review she had written of ``Facing History and Ourselves,'' a Holocaust-education program for schools. It took a lot of selective quotation to turn Mrs. Jeffrey's critique into evidence of anti-Semitism and Nazi sympathy, but Reps. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.) and Barney Frank (D., Mass.) were up to the task. Gingrich buckled under the barrage -- though subsequently, he showed the courage and the decency to regret publicly his loss of nerve. Now Abraham H. Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, has declared that the ADL is ``satisfied that any characterization of [Mrs. Jeffrey] as anti-Semitic or sympathetic to Nazism is entirely unfounded and unfair'' -- a creditable statement. He also accepted her invitation to co-sponsor a conference on Holocaust education at Kennesaw State College in Georgia, where she now teaches. No sign yet from Messrs. Schumer and Frank -- who slandered an innocent woman and exploited a catastrophe in order to score political brownie points -- that they have faced this bit of history, or themselves.

<LI>Who's the richest one of all? Australians, according to a new study by the World Bank, are worth an average of $835,000 per capita, putting them at the top of the heap. The U.S., at $421,000 per capita, ranks a mere 12th, behind such stellar performers as Iceland, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates. The catch? Along with income and man-made wealth, these figures include the value of a nation's untapped natural resources, i.e., all the outback gold and silver or Gulf oil available to future generations. But how valuable will those resources be to someone a hundred years from now? When measured relative to wages, the prices of natural resources today are half what they were in 1980, and only one-eighth what they were in 1900. Real oil prices dropped 62 per cent between 1980 and 1992. Food is 49 per cent cheaper. Prices of most resources shoot up during wars or when the government imposes price controls, but quickly fall again when markets are allowed to allocate resources freely. The Greens have it all wrong: countries that husband natural resources will become ever less wealthy relative to those that turn them into something useful. We'd short Iceland and go long on the United States.

<LI>Preparing for a possible train wreck, the State Department asked each ambassador to provide a list of essential personnel, with a justification of their essentialness. The result has been a mad scramble as worried diplomats rush to justify their embassy's particular mission. Although several embassies are rightly concerned about having continuous support at a sensitive time (e.g., those handling the Bosnian peace negotiations), others are more worried about losing face over the diplomatic grapevine (``Did you hear, Bob got only ten 'essentials' while Jim held out for fifteen?''). How else to explain David Aaron's cable stating that his entire staff of 44 at the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is essential? His assertion is remarkable considering that no one knows exactly what the OECD does. Aaron's cable explains that fall is the busiest season at the OECD (just like the fashion industry). What happens during the other three it doesn't say.

<LI>When Tina Brown, hip editor of <I>The New Yorker</I>, announced that Roseanne -- no last names, please, we're famous -- would guest-edit a special issue on women, the feeling in journalistic circles was that the <I>Tinad&#228mmerung</I> had begun. It isn't that Roseanne is <I>lumpen</I> left -- the magazine is as liberal as it was for years past. It isn't that Roseanne is gross -- no surprise from an editorial regime that, among (many) other horrors, put a crucified Easter bunny on one cover. The reason folks feel Tina Brown's time is up is that Roseanne is pass&#233. She has been gracing the pages of People and The National Enquirer for the better part of a decade. And yet, Tina Brown just discovered her. Fatal, for the High Priestess of Now. The New Yorker, whatever its ideological short-circuits, was once a beacon of urbanity and style. Those are different from hype and hip, as Miss Brown is at long last learning.

<H2>Se Habla Ingles</H2></CENTER>

<HR>
<P>
NEW YORK, SEPTEMBER 5
<P>








It was wise of Senator Dole to come down on English as the national language when he was firing away over the weekend at anti-U.S. academics. The movement to make English the official language of the United States is making legislative headway. The State of New Hampshire has just now enacted an English-language bill, and what appeals to New Hampshire, beyond apples, tends to appeal to presidential candidates.
<P>
The principal lobbying group in favor of universalizing English (it is called ``U.S. English'') is ironically headed up by someone whose native language wasn't English (he is Mauro E. Mujica). And of course the heftiest warrior for English was the late senator and semanticist S. I. Hayakawa, whose native language was Japanese. Senator Hayakawa wanted nothing less than a constitutional amendment. U.S. English will settle for less; others want more.
<P>
There is of course the other side. Why does the United States have to have a common language? After all, Switzerland doesn't.
<P>
The first thing to learn about Switzerland is never to invoke what happens there in an effort to prove any point about any other country. Switzerland breaks all the rules, gets away with it; is a wonderful country with, unhappily, a bad drug problem.
<P>
There are very good historical reasons why the French should have been permitted to nourish their language in Canada and, more recently, to insist on the recognition of French as a substitute language in everything from ballot forms to road signs. But every now and again Canada threatens to become two nations, and so reminds us of the burden the British would have been spared if, two hundred years ago, they had, after defeating the French, exported them back to France, or else sent them south to the United States, where immigrants were taught English.
<P>
Opponents of the universalization of English use two arguments. The first is multiculturalist in ideology, the second, a <I>faux</I> cosmopolitanism. There is every reason in the world for the schools in the United States to teach foreign languages, beginning with Spanish, which is progressively important in commerce and hemispheric comity. But hanging onto one's Spanish if that is the native language is entirely different from depending on it.
<P>
It makes sense in addressing the issue to close our eyes to what happens with the first generation. Yes, many immigrants -- perhaps millions -- who arrived here in middle age went on to become conversant with English. But millions did not, and will not, and it is an expression of geniality to give them radio and television and newspapers in Spanish.
<P>
But their children need to be treated differently. I have experienced a 15-year-old boy who speaks English with difficulty even though he has lived in New York City with his mother for five years. It turns out that in public school, before he moved to a parochial school where he now studies, young Saul was taught six classes every day, five of them in Spanish.
<P>
The quarrel is between two camps, one of them, so to speak, total immersion in its approach, the second a little looser. There are those who believe that English can only be rapidly mastered if every foreigner is required to use it when engaged in any transaction over which that person is superintended. Thus, for instance, employees at McDonald's would be required to talk to each other in English while on-premise. One way to generalize this approach is that everywhere you're not permitted to smoke, you are permitted to speak only in English.
<P>
The approach of U.S. English is less draconian, so also is the House bill introduced by Representative Bill Emerson. It would enforce the use only of English in all government communications, forms, ballots, whatever. Mr. Emerson's bill has 180 sponsors, and in a previous version had also as sponsor Newt Gingrich, who endorses enthusiastically the notion of a national language, nationally accepted as such.
<P>
It is really quite cruel to go in the other direction. A few years ago a middle-aged woman told me that when her parents were sent to Moscow they plunked her down in a Russian school. ``I cried every day for about a month and in about six weeks I understood everything that was said in Russian.'' To stand in the way of young people devoting themselves to the English language is on the order of encouraging obesity by cramming them with Mars bars. It is surely the case that every immigrant who can now handle English is grateful for the experience even if it meant crawling through gnarled, spiky, thorny brushwood for a few months or years.

Dear Rusty

<P>



You'll never guess who I met last week! Hint: he dresses in robes, speaks in a foreign accent, and has been reincarnated 17 times. Give up? I gave Tipper the same clues, but after she guessed ``Henry Kissinger,'' she lost interest in the game.
<P>
Okay, I'll tell you: the Dalai Lama! That's right! The Lama himself was right in my office, and let me tell you, we had a great conversation. He has a real ``presence,'' if you will -- you can tell at once that he's a religious man, and not just because of the robes and the bald head and the incense, either. His eyes are very wise, in a non-Western way. And the way he kept murmuring, ``We need more money,'' had a distinctly spiritual ring to it.
<P>
You're probably wondering how this all came about. Well, with Mrs. William Jefferson Clinton in Beijing, at the UN Women's Tribunal, a lot of us in Washington thought we should do something publicly to denounce the repressive regime in Beijing. But since we've been doing that for a couple of years now, and it hasn't seemed to work -- I mean, they're all still in power over there (though I hear that Deng smokes two packs of unfiltered Camels every day, and has since he was 17 years old, so he'll be lucky to see his 97th birthday) -- someone over at State thought it would be smart to consult with an expert. And who knows better how to deal with the Chinese than the Dalai, who's been on the run since the late '50s?
<P> 
Anyway, besides you and my daughter Karenna, I don't really know any practicing Buddhists, so I was a little nervous about the meeting. Plus, Tipper, Sara, and Kristin insisted on being part of the formal greeting party, ``in case he brings Richard Gere,'' so the office was crowded. 
<P>
Yet he instantly put us at ease. He sort of glided into the room -- a big robe and flip-flops has that effect -- sipped a glass of iced tea, and smiled. Tip and the girls left quickly -- no Richard Gere, just a few monks -- and the Dalai and I got down to talking. ``Welcome to Washington,'' I said. 
<P>
``Thank you, Mr. Vice President. You know, your office looks remarkably like the set they're using on Oliver Stone's movie Nixon.''
<P>
``Really? I didn't know that,'' I said.
<P> 
``Oh yeah. Oliver's pretty much a detail person. I just visited with him. I flew in on the red-eye.''
<P> 
``Oh.''
<P> 
``Can I get a slice of lemon in this tea?''
<P> 
``Of course, of course,'' I said, and sent an usher out to get a tray of lemons.
<P> 
``So, Mr. Vice President,'' the Lama continued, ``as you know, the Chinese have been occupying my nation of Tibet for almost half a century. Theirs is a brutal and violent reign.'' 
<P>
``Yes, we know. But you see, Dalai Lama, we're having a hard time deciding on a policy.''
<P> 
``Any chance of a cigarette?''
<P> 
``I'm sorry, your Holiness, but there's no smoking in the White House.''
<P> 
``Not even for a reincarnated holy man?'' 
<P>
He had a point, Rusty -- and since the enforcer of the ``No Smoking'' rule was in Beijing I sent another usher out for Marlboro 100s and a light.
<P> 
``So,'' I continued, ``do you have any suggestions as to how to proceed with our relationship with Beijing? How we can stop the violence against your people?'' 
<P>
The Lama thought about this. ``I'm not sure,'' he finally murmured. ``We've been fighting them for generations -- well, not fighting, since we're non-violent and we advocate non-violence for others -- but we've been pressuring them and pressuring them, and so far, with no result.''
<P> 
``Hey, same here,'' I said. ``But you know, the First Lady is in Beijing right now. Just yesterday they passed a law against sex-based wage inequities, so if we keep our fingers crossed, they might get to the whole Tibet situation before the Tribunal disbands.''
<P>
An usher dashed into the office. Apparently, no one in the White House would admit to having cigarettes -- they suspected some sort of trap, it seems -- so the usher had to race down a couple of blocks to the liquor store. He was mugged.
<P> 
``I'm sorry, Dalai Lama, but I'm afraid we won't be able to offer you a cigarette. But if we could get back to the violence in your homeland . . .''
<P>
``I wish we could. Unfortunately, I'm due for dinner in Manhattan with Richard Gere. If I leave right now I can snag the three o'clock shuttle.''
<P> 
As the Dalai left my office, an aide handed me an urgent cable. Mrs. William Jefferson Clinton and the delegation at the UN Women's Tribunal in Beijing had just voted to outlaw male aggression, which, if broadly defined, might include things like the Chinese invasion of Tibet. So at least there was some good news to celebrate.

<P>
The Little Engine that Couldn't
<P>
STEPHEN MOORE
<P>
Mr. Moore is director of fiscal-policy studies at the Cato Institute.

<P>
WASHINGTON, D.C.
<P>
ON December 21, 1987, the Democrat-controlled Congress wrapped
13 appropriations bills into a $600-billion, 1,400-page omnibus
spending bill, dumped it on President Reagan's desk, and then
adjourned. Reagan's unhappy options: sign into law the most expensive
spending bill in the history of Western civilization or veto it
and set in motion a Christmas Eve budget train wreck. In the end,
Reagan blinked (thanks to advice from Jim and Howard Baker), the
bill was signed, and House Speaker Jim Wright and Senate Majority
Leader Robert Byrd were exalted. It was perhaps the low point
of the Reagan Presidency.
<P>
There's a useful, if painful, lesson here for Newt Gingrich and
Co. as they prepare to go mano-a-mano with Bill Clinton to decide
the fate of the GOP fiscal revolution. Throughout the 1980s, congressional
Democrats played fiscal hardball with the White House; they played
to win, and invariably did. They routinely used the threat of
a budget train wreck as a strategic offensive weapon in policy
disputes with Reagan. Most importantly, they almost never blinked
first.
<P>
Will the Republicans? One thing seems certain about the looming
budget fight: if this GOP Congress has anywhere near the fierce
loyalty to its agenda of shrinking the government that Jim Wright
and the Democratic leadership of the 1980s had to their agenda
of expanding it, conservatives will score a resounding victory
by early November. The balanced-budget blueprint, the family and
economic-growth tax cuts, the dismantling of failed Great Society
social programs, the Medicare fix, and the real end to welfare
as we know it -- every one of these long-sought conservative goals
will be achieved in full. As veteran budget analyst Harrison Fox
of Citizens for Budget Reform has put it: ``All that can prevent
total victory is Republicans themselves.'' However, if Republicans
remain unflinchingly committed to the budget revolution that won
them 50 House and 8 Senate seats last November, the White House
will almost assuredly fold like a cheap dime-store tent. Let's
not forget this isn't Clint Eastwood in the Oval Office, it's
just Bill Clinton. 
<P>
Even if Clinton vetoes Republican budgets, he still can't conceivably
force concessions from a unified Republican House and Senate.
Remember, Clinton's beef with Congress is that it's not spending
enough money. (We're talking about a GOP budget of $1.6 trillion,
more money than is spent by all of the Fortune 500 companies combined.
Even if Republicans have their way, spending will still rise by
an enormous $350 billion over the next seven years. This is hardly
scorched-earth fiscal policy.) Since the Constitution gives only
Congress the power to appropriate funds, Clinton can veto Republican
balanced budgets till doomsday, but he can't force Republicans
to spend a dime more money than they want to. To paraphrase House
Appropriations Committee Chairman Livingston: ``When you veto
a zero, you still get zero.'' 
<P>
The real battle looming is not between Republicans and Democrats,
but rather between Republicans and Republicans. At stake is the
soul of the party in the post-Reagan era. Now we find out who
really runs the GOP: conservative visionaries Newt Gingrich and
Dick Armey? Or Bob Dole, Bob Packwood, John Chafee, and other
centerfield Senate Republicans whose concept of a bold new agenda
for America is a slightly less expensive version of the liberal
welfare state?
<P>
``There are a dozen, maybe two, Senate Republicans who are deathly
afraid of a budget train wreck,'' concedes one Senate leadership
staffer. ``They are desperate to avoid the politics of gridlock.''
These are the same GOP senators who have spent the past six months
voiding much of the Contract with America. They now want to chop
off the legs of House conservatives by plotting a separate peace
with Clinton on the budget. Sen. Pete Domenici is already sketching
the outlines of a deal with White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta
that would balance the budget over 8 or 9 years (rather than 7)
and neuter the tax cuts. 
<P>
Any such negotiated settlement with the White House would be a
monumental political and policy blunder. Almost nothing could
do more to resuscitate this comatose Presidency and re-establish
Bill Clinton's policy ``relevance'' than this. And any budget
that Clinton would willingly agree to is a budget not worth having.

<P>
It's not clear why so many Republicans are terrorized by the prospect
of a budget train wreck. A train wreck --  Washington's metaphor
for a fiscal stalemate between the White House and Congress that
causes a short-term shutdown of the government -- conjures up
the image of a kind of mutual assured destruction: everyone loses.
In reality the only casualties would be hundreds of liberal spending
programs. Under the Anti-Deficiency Act, all ``essential federal
activities'' -- the FBI, the military, the courts, the air-traffic-control
system, and other agencies that protect Americans from ``an imminent
threat to life or property'' -- must remain in full operation
if the budget is not approved. Social Security checks would still
be sent out. Everything else, though, from the Legal Services
Corporation, to the National Endowment for the Arts, to the Department
of Education, would grind to a halt. (Sounds as if I died and
went to heaven!)
<P>
Newt Gingrich was right on target when he explained that the GOP
isn't the least bit reluctant to allow Clinton to close down federal
operations, because ``it's their government, not ours.'' Clinton's
threatening conservative Republicans with the prospect of a government
shutdown that would largely defund the agencies of the Left is
as if Harry Truman had threatened that if Japan didn't surrender,
he would drop the bomb on New York City.
<P>
Republicans have been in Washington too long if they believe that
Americans would fret over a five- or six-day time out from having
to pay taxes for a multitude of nonessential government activities,
such as the Small Business Administration, transit subsidies,
or Title X sex-education grants. It's no great catastrophe if
the public schools have to economize by cutting condom-distribution
programs. Former Reagan Administration budget director Jim Miller,
who is urging Republicans not to blink first, recently conjured
up the ultimate liberal nightmare: ``If Clinton shuts down the
government, most Americans may not even notice.'' How many Americans
are even aware that there were seven temporary closures of the
government between 1981 and 1990?
<P>
If Clinton vetoes appropriations bills or the extension of the
$5-trillion debt ceiling, Republicans have a rare opportunity
to unilaterally impose a de facto balanced budget immediately.
Gingrich and Dole could essentially confront Clinton with an ultimatum:
until you accept our seven-year balanced budget plan, our tax
cuts, and our welfare overhaul, we will suspend any further borrowing
this year and prohibit you from spending money on all but the
essentials of government. In fact, Nick Smith, Christopher Shays,
and 150 other House Republicans have declared unequivocally in
a letter to the President and the congressional leadership that
they will refuse to raise the statutory ceiling on the debt until
``legislation is enacted ensuring a balanced budget by 2002 or
sooner.'' 
<P>
Engaging in a high-stakes budget collision with the White House
is unarguably a high-risk political strategy. Senate Republicans
worry that voters' attitude will be: A plague on both your houses.
But it's of no small consequence that the roles in this year's
budget conflict between Capitol Hill and the White House will
be reversed from the institutional struggles of the 1980s: this
Congress is trying to balance the budget, not bankrupt it. In
any face-off with the White House, Gingrich and his allies have
the enormous public-relations advantage that they are the ones
on the side of the angels. More importantly, the central virtue
of a knock-down, drag-out budget fight between congressional Republicans
and the White House is that it will help sharply define for 1996
voters the ideological grand canyon between the two parties. 
<P>
The danger to the GOP majorities in Congress is the growing public
perception that Republicans are doing too little, not too much.
I became aware of this at a political summit of Perot supporters
in Virginia earlier this summer where participants blasted this
``do-nothing Congress.'' One frustrated voter told me that, yes,
he realized there is an ideological war over the size and scope
of government in Washington. But he asked: ``Which side of the
war are Republicans on?'' 
<P>
It's a fair question. We'll have the answer in a few weeks.

ONE is going to take it away.
<P>
DAKOTA: Twenty-five bucks, doofoid.
<P>
DAKOTAH: Can you let the man talk, please?
<P>
MODERATOR: Thanks. What I'd like to talk about is your feelings
about Bill Clinton and Al Gore.
<P>
OTIS: Hate 'em. Hate 'em both. And that wife of his tried to steal
my Medicare.

MODERATOR: Um . . . okay, we'll start with Otis. Otis, you say
that you quote hate unquote Bill Clinton and Al Gore -- 
<P>
OTIS: And his wife.
<P>

<P>
OTIS: Clinton's wife. The Medicare thief.

BILL: My wife.
<P>
MODERATOR: I mean in a political sense.
<P>
BILL: Still her.
<P>

a crazy man. So full of rage. I reject that rage.
<P>
MODERATOR: Dakotah, how would you describe your politics?
<P>
DAKOTAH: I wouldn't.
<P>
MODERATOR: You mean you can't describe your feelings?
<P>
DAKOTAH: No, I mean that you probably work for the government
which killed Kennedy and Malcolm X and if I told you what I really
believe you'd have me killed just like you killed Jerry Garcia.
<P>
MODERATOR: Keith . . . how about you?

my voice.
<P>
MODERATOR: I'm terribly sorry.
<P>
KEITH: You think that white man is angry? Check under my hood
sometime.
<P>

<P>
Where Does Fuhrman Take Us?
<P>
NEW YORK, AUGUST 25
<P>
One account analyzes the Mark Fuhrman situation as follows: If
the exposure of the tapes comes in as the closing episode in the
trial, the probability is high that the disgust and loathing for
Detective Fuhrman (richly deserved) will provoke in the jury a
sentiment extraneous to the question, Did O. J. kill his former
wife and her companion? Instead, the analysis goes on, the jurors
will ask themselves, How can we express our disgust? Well -- the
analyst concludes -- by voting, Not Guilty.
<P>
The prosecution will of course make an earnest, desperate attempt
to situate the tapes in context. Marcia Clark will argue that
Houdini himself could not have contrived to arrange the evidence
against O. J. with which the prosecution has made its case. The
chief of police in Los Angeles, Mr. Willie Williams, told a press
conference that ``it is inconceivable to believe that for this
one murder 10, 20, 30, or 40 people got together to plot against
Mr. Simpson.'' Only Oliver Stone could stitch together a plot
to do in O. J. that originated at two in the morning and matured
with a bloody glove at his residence, and bloodstains that identified
O. J., his ex-wife, and Mr. Goldman here and there along the route
from the scene of the crime back to Simpson's residence.
<P>
But the thinking at the moment is that the jury will waive matters
that have dulled in memories of men and women who must be feeling
as though they had been sentenced to perpetual isolation during
a seemingly endless trial. Human sensibilities are as they are,
and the jurors are not likely to blame the defense for their incarceration.
The enemy will be the Establishment: the judge who ordained their
isolation, the prosecution that droned on endlessly, and, above
all, the Los Angeles Police Department, which retained in its
ranks someone who -- if the tapes are to be believed -- lives
in fury against the existence of blacks, women, homosexuals, and
civil rights. 
<P>
It is mystifying what exactly were the objectives of Mr. Fuhrman
in his recorded conversations with Laura Hart McKinny, the scholar
at the North Carolina School of Arts, starting in 1985. He reported
to her (according to one passage in the tapes) how on one occasion
he and fellow officers handled four suspects. ``We basically tortured
them. We broke 'em. Their faces were just mush. They had pictures
of the walls with blood all the way to the ceiling and finger
marks of [them] trying to crawl out of the room.'' A messy business,
handling suspects in that way. It required Mr. Fuhrman and his
fellow law enforcers to clean themselves up with a garden hose.

<P>
Now the Fuhrman narrative gives one pause. It does not surprise
that here and there one comes upon sadists, whether in Los Angeles
or in Gulag. The viewers of the Rodney King beating tend to reason,
Why should we be surprised? Such evidently is the way the police
in Los Angeles, and perhaps elsewhere, routinely act. But the
Rodney King story is complicated. Extensive investigations revealed
that there was a genuine, spastic concern that King might be armed,
might have intended his own impetuous defense using a weapon.
But in the Fuhrman telling of the treatment of four suspects there
would seem to be nothing of that. It was clinical sadism. 
<P>
Already a quiet investigation by the Los Angeles Police has begun,
designed, no doubt, to track the record of men handled over the
years by Detective Fuhrman. Why did they not complain of their
treatment by him? And if there was a record of Fuhrman engaged
in such activity, why was he retained in the force? How will he
be handled by the law? As a perjurer? He swore under oath that
he had not used the term ``nigger'' when manifestly he had done
so, using the word not in the detached tones of a storyteller,
but with invidious gusto. ``You're talking sh--. You sound like
a nigger.''
<P>
It is endlessly fascinating. Fuhrman the cool bigot. O. J., who
earned the confidence of his private investigator because of the
coolness of his behavior in Chicago in the hours immediately after
the killing. How could somebody so casual in his conduct during
those hours before being told of his ex-wife's murder be guilty?
But of course such reasoning, from the particular to the general,
would justify confidence that the Fuhrman observed on the witness
stand could not be the same Fuhrman who spoke into those tapes.

<P>
The jury's responsibility in this case is awesome, extending far
beyond the question of O. J.'s guilt or innocence. It touches
on the recognition of the awful baseness of which human beings
-- Americans -- are capable.

<P>
<LI>Big winners from <B>Ross Perot</B> confab are an ideological grab-bag:
<B>Pat Buchanan, Jesse Jackson, John Kasich</B>. Former Perot pollster
<B>Frank Luntz</B>, however, points out that audience at United We Stand
America convention was not representative of Perot's '92 supporters.
(Would most Americans pay to hear more than three dozen politicians
speak?) . . . GOP presidential candidates addressed group despite
<B>Bill Bennett's</B> warnings not to kowtow to Perot. Not kowtowing
was front-runner <B>Bob Dole</B>, whose speech defended politicians and
criticized isolationism. According to <I>Washington Times</I>, Buchanan
``electrified'' crowd with America First and protectionist messages;
but <B>Alan Keyes</B> slammed Buchanan for downplaying anti-abortion
stand, less popular among UWSA members. <B>Phil Gramm</B> reiterated
pledges to balance budget in first term and to abolish federal
quotas by executive order in first day on job. (Dole recently
told columnist <I>Lally Weymouth</I> he would not issue such executive
orders.) <I>Lamar Alexander</I> predicted that independent candidacy
would re-elect <I>Bill Clinton</I> if party nominates Beltway insider
. . . Also sounding anti-Beltway note was <I>Pete Wilson</I>. Though
moderate/liberal on social issues, Wilson called rising illegitimacy
``the greatest threat I can think of to America's future.'' .
. . Survey for U.S. News finds that whites like <I>Colin Powell</I> more
than blacks do, ``largely because a surprising number of blacks
don't know much about him.'' Of blacks who can identify Powell,
19 per cent don't know his race.
<P>
<LI>Announcement by N.J. Sen.<B> Bill Bradley</B> that he won't run for re-election
next year reduces Democrats' already-slim chances of retaking
Senate. Dems currently hold 6 of 7 Senate seats that will be open
in 1996 -- and they lost all 6 of their open seats in '94. <B>Claiborne
Pell </B>(D., R.I.) is probably next out the door. Will <B>Sam Nunn</B>,
in Republican-friendly Georgia, be far behind? Dems may be lucky
to hold onto the power to filibuster. . . . Race to replace Bradley
is already crowded: among Republicans, Rep. <B>Dick Zimmer</B> is widely
expected to win nomination but <B>Richard DuHaime</B> is challenging
him from the Right; ex-Gov. <B>Tom Kean</B> and Rep. <B>Marge Roukema</B> could
jump in. Main contenders on Democrat side are likely to be Reps.
<B>Robert Torricelli</B> and <B>Robert Andrews</B>, but ex-Gov. <B>Jim Florio</B> is
interested. . . . <B>Newt Gingrich</B> and <B>John Lewis</B> (D., Ga.) -- the
same Lewis who recently disrupted a Gingrich symposium on Medicare
-- joined forces to submit a redistricting proposal to protect
Georgia's 11 congressional incumbents.
<P>
<LI><B>Norma McCorvey</B>, better known as Jane Roe of Roe v. Wade, departed
the pro-choice movement. Feminists,  she complains, never treated
her -- a reform-school dropout, former drug dealer and alcoholic
-- with respect. Reaction from <B>Sarah Weddington</B>, her lawyer in
Roe: ``It doesn't really matter. The case was a class-action suit.''
New York Times piles on: McCorvey ``never was much of a poster
girl for choice,'' declares editorial page. . . . Pro-lifers make
progress in state legislatures across the country. <B>Clarke Forsythe</B>
of Americans United for Life reports in Wall Street Journal that
so far this year four states have passed laws requiring parental
consent or at least notification before a minor daughter's abortion,
leaving only 12 states without such laws. Three states passed
informed-consent laws -- and Missouri would have joined them but
for Dem. Gov. <B>Mel Carnahan's</B> veto. And the Ohio legislature sent
a ban on ``partial-birth'' abortions to GOP Gov. <B>George Voinovich</B>
for his signature.
<P>
<LI>Defection of Lt.-Gen. <B>Hussein Kamel Hassan</B>, head of Iraq's military
industrialization -- including nuclear and poison-gas projects
-- means regime of <B>Saddam Hussein</B> is collapsing. Iraq itself might
splinter, with neighboring states wrangling for pieces in Yugoslav-type
ethnic free-for-all. . . . Colombia Prosecutor-General <B>Alfonso
Valdivieso</B> expects other drug traffickers to replace captured
Cali cartel leaders <B>Miguel Rodriguez Orejuelo</B> and his brother.
Defense Minister <B>Fernando Botero</B> resigned after accusations he
took drug money while running Pres. <B>Ernesto Samper's</B> campaign.
. . . Meanwhile, U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency chief <B>Thomas Constantine</B>
says amphetamines from Mexico are rapidly overtaking Colombian
cocaine as drug of choice in U.S. . . . Mexican police have grabbed
<B>Aaron Morel Lebaron</B>, leader of Texas polygamist sect who is accused
of ordering the murder of three members. . . . Senators <B>John McCain</B>
and <B>Joseph Lieberman</B> are co-sponsoring proposal to establish international
fund to arm Bosnian government. <B>Jesse Helms</B>, chairman of Foreign
Relations Committee, says, ``It's time we treated the Bosnian
people the same way we treated the Contras in Nicaragua and those
people in Afghanistan -- as freedom fighters.'' . . . Russian
ultranationalist <B>Vladimir Zhirinovsky</B> has ordered all his party's
candidates in December parliamentary elections to be examined
for drug addiction, mental illness, and criminal backgrounds.
. . . <B>Vitaly Usov</B>, general manager of new Moscow restaurant offering
traditional Russian fast-food, has taught waitresses to smile
like McDonald's employees.

<CENTER><H2>The Week</H2></CENTER>
<HR>
11-September-1995

<P>

<LI>Republicans are pondering a budget showdown that would be, in
the words of one of their analysts, ``the fiscal equivalent of
dropping an atomic bomb on the government.'' Aw, go ahead. It's
the right thing to do. Don't even wait for a budget crisis. Do
it!
<P>
<LI>If you shut down the government, every family in the country would
get a pay raise of, oh, $300 a week. Of course we'd have to give
up bureaucrats and Form 1040, but most families could easily afford
that. Do it!
<P>
<LI>If you have doubts, think of the number of American casualties
it would cost to invade. Do it!
<P>
<LI>You might think that Newt Gingrich is calling for tax cuts because
of a commitment to limited government and economic growth. If
so, you obviously have not read Gail Sheehy's profile of Gingrich
in the September <I>Vanity Fair</I>. Miss Sheehy's readers know that
tax cuts, Medicare reform, and deregulation are not policies at
all, but mental anomalies to be explained by Gingrich's longing
to be loved by two cold, authoritarian fathers. The Speaker is,
in short, a victim. But he is not to be indulged like most victims,
because he is dangerous. Miss Sheehy's article is unlikely, however,
to be remembered for its contribution to public understanding
of manic depression. Much more titillating are her allegations
of infidelities during Gingrich's first marriage, which ended
in 1981. Whatever the truth of the matter, it is none of Miss
Sheehy's -- or the reading public's -- business. Most people are
not saints, and their reputations would suffer from harsh scrutiny.
It might be a different matter if Mr. Gingrich had presented himself
as a sterling moral leader. But he has not done so. The only silver
lining to the story is that it may help dissuade Mr. Gingrich
from entering the presidential race this time  -- which, as we
have argued, would be against his own interests anyway.
<P>
<LI>If President Clinton really wants to stop teenagers from smoking,
he should propose a law requiring that they must be able to read
the writing on a cigarette package before it can be sold to them.
<P>
<LI>Defense hawks are questioning Senate Republicans' commitment to
strategic defense. The House's defense authorization bill, and
previously the Senate's, required that a multiple-site ballistic-missile
defense system be <I>deployed</I> by 2003. But now Senators Cohen, Warner,
Nunn, and Levin have reached a bipartisan agreement (if Cohen
and Warner count as Republicans) which speaks instead of ``developing
for deployment'' -- in other words, still more years on the drawing
board. Armed Services Committee Chairman Strom Thurmond has signed
off on the deal, which will be approved by the Senate. If missile-defense
supporters in the House hold firm in conference, however, they
can probably win enough votes in the Senate for final passage
of their version of the bill. It's high time for Republicans to
come to the defense of missile defense.
<P>
<LI>Hurricane Felix drifted in, drifted out, drifted around, killed
a few people, and otherwise acted remarkably like United States
foreign policy.
<P>
<LI>If Bill Bradley had retired in September, or July, or anytime
except a very slow August, the nation might have been spared the
hype surrounding the New Jersey senator's hint at an independent
presidential bid. Two days on the front page of the <I>Washington
Post</I>. Four pages, including an interview, in <I>Newsweek</I>. Bradley
says both parties are failing America. But in what ways does this
self-styled maverick -- a roughly 90 per cent Americans for Democratic
Action liberal who voted against unfunded-mandate reform, regulatory
reform, and the Balanced Budget Amendment -- differ from his President?
``The issue isn't where I agree or disagree with the President,''
he told <I>Newsweek</I>. ``It's too easy to say, Well, I agree on these
five, I disagree on those four. What does that tell anybody?''
More than anything else we're likely to hear from Bill Bradley.
The senator's glowing coverage suggests that this pillar of the
establishment can, through the sheer force of his seriousness
and decency, save American democracy. From what exactly? He's
not saying.<P>
<LI>And if Bill Bradley is thinking of running for President
as an independent, he joins others considering such a run, including
Jesse Jackson, Colin Powell, Lowell Weicker, and Ross Perot. The
only independent to announce so far is Bill Clinton.
<P>
<LI>On August 17, Whitewater Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr indicted
Clinton crony and business partner James McDougal on 19 counts
of fraud and related crimes. Starr also indicted McDougal's former
wife, Susan, and Arkansas Governor Jim Guy Tucker. This can't
be good news for the Clintons. The McDougals and Clintons were
50 - 50 partners in the Whitewater Development Corporation. Whitewater
contributed to the failure of Madison Guaranty Savings &amp; Loan
-- which cost taxpayers $60 million. Resolution Trust Corporation
investigator Jean Lewis told the House Banking Committee that
Whitewater -- hence, the Clintons -- benefited from Mr. McDougal's
fraudulent activities. Miss Lewis also testified that she was
``obstructed, hampered, and manipulated'' during the course of
her investigation and placed on administrative leave along with
the two supervisors who had backed her. There are several problems
here. First, the Clintons' taxes. They deducted two interest payments
(one of $2,811, the other of $2,322) on loans that were paid not
by them, but by Whitewater. Also, from 1982 to 1986, McDougal
was making their Whitewater mortgage payments. The Clintons claim
they did not know of McDougal's generosity, and they never bothered
to ask who was making the payments. In other words, don't ask,
don't tell.
<P>
<LI>Led by Reps. Barney Frank, Charles Schumer, and Maxine Waters,
the Democrats at the House Whitewater hearings exercised the full
extent of their mental faculties and moral superiority by emitting
grunts, bleats, cackles, groans, chirps, and snorts whenever they
didn't want to hear the evidence, which was usually. Chairman
Jim Leach finally had to rule ``guttural noises'' out of order.
Why didn't anyone think of that these last sixty years?
<P>
<LI>As the number of Whitewater-related indictments rose to 14, Bill
Clinton has denied ever being governor of Arkansas.
<P>
<LI>It didn't take Shannon Faulkner long to realize that there had
to be an easier way to lose twenty pounds. On August 9, the U.S.
4th District Court of Appeals had ordered The Citadel to admit
Miss Faulkner, despite her being above the weight limit, and despite
her refusal to submit to a physical evaluation. By mid afternoon
of the first day of the plebes' Hell Week, Miss Faulkner was in
the infirmary, from which she did not emerge until her hastily
called press conference at week's end. ``I don't think there's
any dishonor in leaving,'' she stated. ``I think there's dis-justice
in my staying and killing myself just for the political point.''
Her unscripted admission on why she had waged her prolonged assault
on the all-male military college was unsurprising. Miss Faulkner's
simple plea for equal treatment was belied by the fact that she
wanted to attend the demanding, 152-year-old institution on her
own terms and clearly relished her role as feminist icon -- until
reveille sounded, and Gloria Allred was nowhere to be found.
<P>
<LI>A dozen top Iraqis defected from Baghdad to Jordan, and ``Jane
Roe'' defected from her pro-abortion stance to join Operation
Rescue. David Gergen is demanding royalties.
<P>
<LI>In an interview in the <I>Wall Street Journal</I> Bui Tin, the North
Vietnamese general who received South Vietnam's unconditional
surrender in 1975, confirmed what the Right has known all along:
the antiwar protestors undermined the American war effort and,
yes, through visits of prominent Americans to Hanoi, gave aid
and comfort to the enemy. Says General Bui: ``[The antiwar protestors]
represented the conscience of America. [That conscience] was part
of its war-making capability, and we were turning that power in
our favor.'' Thomas Sowell argues in <I>Forbes</I> that Thirties pacifists
in England, France, and the U.S. helped cause an unnecessary World
War II by keeping their governments from building up deterrent
arms, thus giving Germany and her allies a crucial head start.
In the case of Vietnam the protestors didn't cause the war, but
they weakened our will to continue, resulting in our broken promise
to the people of South Vietnam and -- lest we forget -- to the
57,000 Americans who died there. The Sixties pacifists can atone
for their past offenses by admitting what their professions of
peace-and-love led to.
<P>
<LI>Alternative energy is having some problems, according to the newsletter
<I>Access to Energy</I>. Twenty per cent of the mirrors at the solar-power
field in Barstow, California, are broken, and the rest are working
at reduced efficiency because smoke from the Mount Pinatubo eruption
four years ago is still reducing the intensity of sunlight. Southern
California Edison isn't too unhappy about the low productivity
because it is required by federal law to pay the solar electric
generators 15a/kWh compared to its own generation costs of 3a/kWh.
(Then again, in the absence of competition it can pass the higher
power bills on to its customers.) Meanwhile, at another politically
correct project which generates electricity by means of windmills,
the blades have chopped up thousands of birds in the past two
years, including 78 golden eagles. And at El Centro, California,
a power plant that burns biomass is out of commission: the manure
it was being fed as fuel wouldn't burn after recent wet weather,
and the plant is plugged up with the stuff. No report on whether
it is being tested for conformity to air-quality standards.
<P>
<LI>A controversy broke out in the advertising world over some vaguely
soft pornographic ads taken out by Calvin Klein in <I>YM</I>, a magazine
for girls ages 12 and up. The ads show under-age models in various
states of undress. As reported in the <I>Wall Street Journal</I>, the
dispute focuses on whether the ads will or will not offend the
young girls who read <I>YM</I>. ``Something that is offensive to adults
may not be to kids,'' reasoned Ira Garey, publisher of <I>Sassy</I>.
``It [the ad campaign] just isn't subtle enough and therefore
isn't cool,'' countered Jane Grossman, publisher of<I> Seventeen</I>.
Nobody seems to have thought about the moral effect the ads might
have. That just wouldn't be subtle enough and therefore wouldn't
be cool.
<P>
<LI>President Clinton is warning Iraq that any military moves against
Kuwait or Saudi Arabia will be met with the full mobilization
of Mark Fuhrman.

Fear Itself
<P>
RICH LOWRY
<P>
Mr. Lowry is NR's national political reporter
<P>
WASHINGTON, D.C.
<P>
``DIRTY rotten stinking . . . meat,'' screams the headline of
the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) press release.
``Warner to Voters: `Eat This.' '' DSCC executive director Don
Foley elaborates: ``Senator Warner is an E-Coli Republican. His
vote for corporate greed and irresponsible government literally
threatens American lives.'' Lest anyone miss the point, the DSCC
release includes a cartoon depicting Warner dishing out putrid
meat to a kid.
<P>
 Juvenile campaign tactics are, of course, a bi-partisan affair.
The National Republican Congressional Committee's recent ``wanted''
poster of prominent House liberals won't be winning awards for
high-mindedness. But there are differences that make Democratic
broadsides worth special notice: their shrill attacks still have
a credulous echo-chamber among the establishment media; they often
seem to work; and they may be all that's left in the Democratic
arsenal.
<P>
Consider the stalled effort on regulatory reform. On July 3, as
the Senate prepared to take up Bob Dole's reform bill, the<I> New
York Times</I> ran a front-page story that alleged a GOP assault on
food safety. Calls poured in to the Center for Science in the
Public Interest, a consumer-advocacy group that along with Safe
Tables Our Priority (STOP), a coalition of families of <I>E. coli</I>
victims, had already been agitating on food safety. These groups
argued that regulatory reform would nix proposed U.S. Department
of Agriculture (USDA) meat-inspection standards, exposing millions
to tainted meat.
<P>
At one event, activists took 100 hamburgers to Capitol Hill to
hand out to senators, daring them to play ``hamburger roulette.''
Reporters ate it up. In the wake of the Jack in the Box outbreak
in 1993 in which three children died, the bacterium is a high-profile
poster-child for food contamination. Perhaps the most damaging
story was one that aired on ABC News, with a reporter alleging
that under regulatory reform new meat-inspection rules ``could
be dismantled.'' Then the father of an <I>E. coli</I> victim warned against
any reform-induced delay of new rules: ``Every time there's a
delay, over one child a day dies.&quot;
<P>
The thrust of the ABC story and most other <I>E. coli</I> commentary
in the media was dubious on three grounds: 
<P>
-- The original draft of the Dole bill had several provisions
providing an emergency by-pass for new regulations deemed necessary
to protect the public from an imminent threat to its health or
safety. In any case, the bill's cost - benefit analysis wouldn't
stop new meat-inspection rules if they were likely to deliver
the touted benefits.
<P>
 -- The proposed new testing is expressly aimed at catching meat
infected with salmonella, not <I>E. coli</I>. Activists and the media
focused on <I>E. coli</I> anyway because it's scarier. Furthermore, the
difference between the inspection changes favored by industry
and those sought by the USDA is hardly dramatic.
<P>
 -- The figure of 500 <I>E. coli</I> deaths a year -- more than one child
dying a day -- is surely an exaggeration. Anti-reform activists
cite the Centers for Disease Control for the figures. But when
the independent D.C.-based Statistical Assessment Service (STATS)
ran the numbers, knocking out unwarranted extrapolations, it came
up with a range of 3 to 73 <I>E. coli</I> deaths a year.
<P>
``What you really seem to be getting is a known prospect for maybe
3 or 4 people a year dying and then a huge black box of assumptions
and guesses,'' says David Murray of STATS. ``The highest-end numbers
were selected to get the maximum exposure from [the] press.
<P>
''ON THE environment the story is similar. When Republicans proposed
restrictions on the Environmental Protection Agency in July, Democrats
accused them of -- what else? -- endangering children. The Republican
changes, Rep. Barbara Kennelly (D., Conn.) charged, ``will make
it easier for lead and arsenic to contaminate our drinking water,
causing immeasurable harm to our children.'' Louis Stokes (D.,
Ohio) told listeners that ``while efforts to control refinery
toxic emissions go into suspended animation, the lungs of our
citizens will not.
<P>
''Never mind that with the exception of a provision limiting enforcement
of the Clean Water Act -- meant to prod the Senate into re-authorizing
the Clean Water Act -- many of the 17 so-called ``riders'' on
the EPA appropriations bill are minor, dealing with issues like
auto-emissions testing. President Clinton still denounced the
bill as a threat to Americans' ``basic safety.'' In August, he
alleged it would allow oil refineries ``to spew benzene, a cancer-causing
chemical, without stringent safeguards.'' Actually, the rider
in question is meant to keep the EPA from using 15-year-old emissions
data to justify a new tightening of refinery regulations.
<P>
Still, Democratic jabs can sting. ``If you give them any kind
of hook,'' explains a GOP leadership aide, ``even if it's not
wholly true or wholly accurate, they can use that to reinforce
[a] pre-existing notion.'' Especially on issues like regulation
and the environment, Republicans resort to a defensive crouch.
``On welfare, the Speaker and Republican leaders are able to articulate
an alternative vision,'' says Jonathan Adler of the Competitive
Enterprise Institute. ``The Republicans have yet to transfer that
approach to the environment.
<P>
''The bright side to the Democratic assaults is that the party
seems to have little else. As Majority Leader Dick Armey likes
to put it: ``The party that once lived by the proud motto 'We
have nothing to fear, but fear itself,' has been reduced to a
political strategy of: 'We have nothing to offer but fear itself.'''
<P>
But fear together with a compliant media can be a useful weapon.
In March, a GOP staffer held a courtesy briefing for Democratic
staff on regulatory reform. He had three lawyers, all experts,
along to help answer questions. Afterwards, an account of the
meeting was leaked to the <I>New York Times</I> (almost certainly by
a Democratic staffer), which on March 31 ran a front-page story
suggesting that the lawyers' presence at the informal, open briefing
proved that lobbyists control the GOP. The White House talked
up the story. The Ralph Nader group Public Citizen filed ethics
charges (which have since been dismissed). The evidence? The March
31 <I>New York Times</I>.

Dear Rusty,
<P>
This is going to sound strange, but I'd appreciate it if you'd
please sign the enclosed ``I'm Mad as Hell! Perot in '96!'' petition,
get your research associates down there in Brazil to sign it --
heck, we're not too picky about their citizenship status -- and
pouch it back to me ASAP, so I can dash it down to Dad in Tennessee
and he can mail it from the local post office. I'd ask you to
send it yourself, but if Perot sees a postmark from south of the
border, well, he goes bananasville.
<P>
It's all part of our ``43% and Holding!'' strategy for '96. And
let me be totally honest: for the first time, I get the sense
that Bill is firing on all jets. We had our usual guy-to-guy lunch
yesterday -- just him and me, one on one, except for Dick Morris,
Leon Panetta, Dick Schoen, and Mark McCurry -- and did he ever
have fire in his belly!
<P>
Part of that could be the new McBacon Salsa Ranch Burgers and
the SuperSize Fries (``SuperSize it!'' Bill always says . . .
) that we -- well, that he -- had for lunch, and part of it could
be the fact that he'd just approved Mrs. William J. Clinton's
trip to Beijing (``Stay a while,'' he said breezily. ``SuperSize
it!''), and another part of it could be that the family settled
on Jackson Hole for its summer vacation (``Get me some new shorts!''
he barked good-naturedly at George Stephanopoulos, ``and SuperSize
'em!''), but I think most of it had to do with his sudden realization
that we have 1996 in the bag. 
<P>
In the first place, Bob Dole is pretty much a lock for the Republican
ticket. So we're ahead going in. And in the second place, it looks
certain that Ross Perot will join the fray. I have to be totally
honest with you, Rusty -- two weeks ago, I'd have bet that the
little guy was going to sit this one out.
<P>
So we thought and thought: if only there was some way to goad
him into running, some way to make it clear how little we fear
him and how low our regard is for his importance. 
<P>
``Send Mack McClarty to talk to him,'' Dick Morris suggested,
which I said I thought was odd since McClarty had retired to Arkansas
months ago, but then I was informed that he was still here, not
just in the District, but here here, in the White House here,
and so I scraped the egg off my face (!) and signed on. We send
Mack down to Dallas -- he opened for Alan Keyes, I think -- and
if I'm not mistaken, it was a ``message received'' situation.

<P>
Then, the new Vanity Fair came out with Gail Sheehy's article
on Newt Gingrich. She serves up some pretty spicy revelations,
and boy, did Bill ever eat it up. He flipped through that issue
like wildfire, pages snapping every second. ``I've done that,''
he said at one page, ``did that,'' at another, ``did that twice,''
at another, and ``did that, almost did that, watched that'' at
the final few pages, and tossed the issue aside with a resounding,
``That boy better learn to SuperSize it!'' A few minutes later,
he was on the phone to the woman Sheehy quotes, thanking her for
her ``forthright honesty'' and asking her if she lives in ``the
202 area code.'' It's nice to see him connecting with voters again.
<P>
And, of course, it's nice to see him connecting with Gingrich,
too. As rough as the past few months have been, I think Dick Morris
is right when he says that ``Gingrich in the Big House keeps Bill
in the White House,'' so when Bill read the Vanity Fair article,
the first thing he said was: ``We can do business with him.''
I think Bill really noticed the parallels in their lives -- you
know: strong, slightly nutty moms; weird dad situations; both
kind of fat. The only problem I see is that Bill is insisting
on meeting the woman Sheehy interviews -- ``opposition research,''
he insists -- and that sounds a little too Jimmy-Carter-scheduling-the-White-House-tennis-court
to me. ``Let the experts do it,'' I counseled. 
<P>
I'll admit that there were some tense moments around here when
Bill Bradley announced that he was retiring from the Senate. He
really tore into the current partisanship that's dividing both
houses in Congress. I have to admit that I agree. Congress was
much, much better a few years ago before all those Republicans
got elected. But the bottom line is that he won't run against
me and Bill. He's a centrist, moderate New Democrat -- and there's
only room for one of us on the ticket. Plus, he and Colin Powell
are going to be mighty busy with their respective book tours.
<P>
So the view from here is that we're looking pretty good. About
the only fly in the ointment is the Congressional Medal of Freedom
campaign that Tipper wants to launch for Jerry Garcia. I'm sorry,
Rusty, call me a square, but I don't think the guy who wrote ``Truckin'''
needs any more honors. 
<P>
Gotta go! The NSC wire just blipped out a cable. Saddam Hussein
is massing troops on the Kuwaiti border. Somebody up there likes
us!

Newt Draws Fire
<P>
NEW YORK,
<P>
It's interesting how many are left feeling insecure when the subject
of Newt Gingrich comes up. Dan Quayle, Spiro Agnew, Jesse Helms
-- they can be handled with that equanimity that mainlines its
way onto critics who are confident they are peering down on their
targets. Newt Gingrich doesn't work for them in quite that way.
For one thing he has a very advanced academic degree; for another,
he is politically defter than most of his critics, and nothing
generates hurt like yet one more primary victory by Tricky Dick.
Gingrich stitched together a year ago the unthinkable, a proposed
legislative agenda for a Republican Congress. The whole world
laughed at such presumption and the next thing we knew, the House
of Representatives became Republican. They stopped making certain
kinds of jokes about FDR after 100 days, but in the case of Newt,
the need to laugh begins to sound like the aristocracy in the
Winter Palace, continuing to twit while the Revolution gathered
outdoors. 
<P>
Consider Maureen Dowd of the New York Times. Her recent assault
on Gingrich was ostensibly triggered by his confession that he
was not schooled in foreign policy (he had blurted out that Taiwan
should be recognized diplomatically). But Miss Dowd doesn't conceal
the totality of her concern over the Speaker. She entitled her
piece ``The Loss of the Dodo''; led off by remarking that Newt
was ``sickeningly'' cute; and ended by confessing her ``distress''
at the prospect of ``the Speaker frolicking in the woods with
a bunch of guys in sheets and dresses.''
<P>
The ``cute'' business was a reaction to Mr. Gingrich's having
told a visiting witness that she was welcome to ``come see my
dinosaur.'' The reference is to a facsimile skull kept in Mr.
Gingrich's office, which wouldn't strike most people as ``cute,''
so long as the addict stops short of dinosaur figures on his stationery
or calls for a National Dinosaur Day.
<P>
As to the foreign-policy statement (Why don't we just recognize
Taiwan?), in the same issue that carried Miss Dowd's column, the
Times ran a major story about Taiwan and the loss of national
identity by its people. Taiwan is large enough and important enough
to warrant recognition, but we have here the problem of, ``If
you had some ham we could have a ham sandwich, if I had some bread''
-- neither Taiwan nor China will affirm the obvious, which is
that modern Taiwan is as much a zone of modern China as Algeria
is a zone of France.
<P>
Then there is the frolicking in the woods. 
<P>
Miss Dowd noted that Mr. Gingrich would spend the weekend at the
Bohemian Grove, ``the exclusive men's club in northern California.
. . . The camp is a saturnalia of juvenilia, with a lot of old
white rich guys running around naked and in sheets, costumed as
Druids. They drink dawn-to-dusk gin fizzes, relieve themselves
on redwoods, and put on theatricals where they dress up like women.''

<P>
Well yes, but if you are playing the part of a woman in a theatrical,
what should you dress like? Miss Dowd might as well have written
that she doesn't understand why the people in the Metropolitan
Opera chorus go around clutching spears. 
<P>
About five years ago, CBS's Leslie Stahl did an interview with
me about women joining the Century Association. A few minutes
into the discussion she interrupted herself. ``Would you be willing
to talk about the Bohemian Club?''
<P>
Well, I said, it isn't something we're supposed to talk about.
. . .
<P>
``Well,'' Miss Stahl pressed, ``what about this business of going
around naked?''
<P>
I lowered my voice. ``In the years I've been going to the Bohemian
Club,'' I whispered, ``I have seen men naked only in the shower,
and now I'll tell you something in confidence.'' Her eyes hungered
for my revelation. The camera whirred. ``The Admissions Committee
of the Bohemian Grove does not like to admit to membership people
who shower with their clothes on.'' Miss Stahl simply smiled,
gamely. 
<P>
Did Maureen Dowd believe that men in the Grove go about naked?
No, she did not. Two days before her story appeared she telephoned
an old friend, an ex-member of the Club, who told her the naked
business was sheer fantasy -- ``It just doesn't happen.'' Perhaps
Miss Dowd thought to be cute by perpetuating the legend, and in
a way she succeeded, and I'd even go so far as to deny that she
was at this point sickeningly cute. 
<P>
Saturnalia? Those in the Bohemian Grove who drink gin fizzes all
day long (I know of two) drink gin fizzes from dawn to dusk wherever
they are. A drunkard need not bother to travel to California in
order to indulge his habit. But then Miss Dowd would rather spice
up her column than report facts, proving only that the antagonism
to Newt conquers all, even if it does not excuse all.

War Crimes and Misdemeanors
<P>
<LI>William Letwin's article, contrasting a recent visit to Japan with his earlier arrival as a young U.S. occupier in 1945, offers in general a benign judgment of what has been achieved by the Japanese since then. But about Japanese war guilt he feels disquiet.
<P>
With good reasons: the half-heartedness of the official Japanese apology for wartime crimes; the fact that even so modest a gesture was supported by less than half the Diet; and the Japanese concentration upon Hiroshima as the central event of World War II.
<P>
Mr. Letwin points to the main flaw of MacArthur's Occupation, otherwise rightly celebrated, namely that it did not force the Japanese to face up to the fact that Japan entered the war as an aggressor and committed war crimes on a scale that shocked even hardened soldiers. 
<P>
But national amnesia of that kind is common, national repentance on the postwar German model a rarity.
<P>
What is odd is that the U.S. should today agree to gloss over its victory. According to the script of President Clinton's Hawaii commemoration of V-J Day, however, it now turns out that we defeated the Pacific. As Dorothy Rabinowitz drily observed in the<I> Wall Street Journal</I>, the next stage will be to call it: Event in the Pacific.
<P>
This is doubtless intended to suggest America has generously decided to forget Japan's past crimes; unfortunately, it also enables Japan to do the same.

<P>

<LI>Almost every living GOP presidential candidate -- and some whose claim to be  living is questionable -- will have kow-towed to Ross Perot by now. Why?
<P>
It cannot be what he has to say. Now that we have grown used to his snappy (but lacking in nutrition) one-liners, Mr. Perot never says anything interesting, or indeed anything much. 
<P>
Nor can Republicans reasonably think that by proposing to Mr. Perot, they can marry the 19 per cent of voters who supported him in 1992. Mr. Perot was the beneficiary of a large protest vote, not its owner. 
The first Republican to dress down Mr. Perot will advance in the polls. He will have demonstrated the most important asset in politics -- authority.
<P>
Politicians unfailingly fail to grasp this. They imagine that the public wants likable and friendly leaders -- when what it wants above all is strong and decisive leaders. (Okay, okay. Voters would ideally prefer leaders who are both; but a Reagan or an FDR comes along once in a generation.)
<P>
So, the correct strategy for GOP hopefuls in Texas last weekend was to criticize Perot to his face while highlighting the issues his voters care about. 
<P>
Tell me: who did the right thing?


<P>
<LI>Senate rules are meant to cover breaches of a senator's public duty. Boorish actions in private are best dealt with by informal social sanctions such as snubbing. And no doubt decent women did shun Senator Packwood when they learned of his behavior.
<P>
But there is an interesting question that even Senator Barbara Boxer glided over: did his tactic of grabbing the nearest available girl and sticking his tongue into her mouth ever work?
<P>
If not, why did Mr. Packwood employ it for so long? After all, it is such an unpromising experiment that a few consistent failures would persuade most social scientists to try another approach.
<P>
The inference must be that its many humiliations were more than compensated for by a) the occasional conquest, and b) its sheer efficiency (no need of dinner, candlelight, flowers, etc.).
<P>
Will any of these responsive women come forward? Will they testify that it was the senator's power and glamor as a top legislator which led them so to forget themselves? And, if so, will they include those feminists who supported him long after his activities were known because they wanted his vote on abortion, etc.? He could stick his tongue into their PAC any time he chose.
<P>
I would continue on this theme, but it might become tasteless.

28-August-1995
<P>



<P>
<LI>We know why President Clinton works so hard to make sure no one has a clue where he stands on anything. He figures, if it works for Colin Powell . . .
<P>
After a brief appearance on the Senate floor, Bob Dole's welfare-reform bill was prudently pulled. It was vulnerable to attack from all sides, but especially the Right. More than twenty senators had rallied to a conservative alternative championed by Phil Gramm -- with good reason. The block grants in the Dole bill retained a tangle of strings and sops to the Health and Human Services bureaucracy (the job-training block grant was some 110 pages long and wouldn't have taken effect until July 1998). Its work provisions would have been entirely meaningless if Dole hadn't at the last minute added ``pay for performance'' provisions pushed by Gramm, and they would still have allowed states to count bogus training programs as ``work.'' And the bill lacked crucial provisions to keep federal funds from subsidizing unwed motherhood. (Sen. Packwood reportedly said such restrictions would be a violation of women's reproductive rights.) If the bill had gone forward this month, it seemed likely only to get worse, with Dole promising new child-care measures and GOP moderates angling for a ``maintenance of effort'' requirement to keep state welfare spending at current levels. Better to wait until September, when perhaps the Senate leadership will have embraced welfare reform worthy of the name.
<P>
<LI>There won't be much R&R over the August recess for nervous House Republicans who have been sent home with talking points, charts, and video cassettes to make the case for a radical restructuring of Medicare. In the words of one leadership staffer, the members have been in ``boot camp'' for the past three months, honing a Medicare reform message that will withstand the Democrats' ``Mediscare'' campaign, which alleges that Republicans will slash spending to give tax cuts to the rich. Republicans believe the report issued in April by the Medicare Trustees, which forecast the program's bankruptcy by 2002, convinced the public of the need for reform. A late July CNN/<I> USA Today</I> poll indicates that 65 per cent of respondents believe Medicare has serious problems, warranting ``drastic action.'' Republicans will unveil their plan for Medicare in mid September; meanwhile they are stressing their commitment to the program, to the 40 per cent increase in spending per capita over the next seven years, and to the expanded choices they hope to include in their reform, including Medical Savings Accounts. A final vote is expected within a month of the GOP plan's introduction. As long as it provides the elderly a real choice of coverage, with no bias in favor of managed care, Republicans can fend off the charge that their plan is warmed-over Clintonism using HMOs to ration care. Speaker Gingrich believes that Medicare reform will be the biggest challenge facing his troops in this high-stakes Congress. They're well trained, they're armed with the facts, and they'll have a detailed plan. But with Medicare as the battleground and the AARP aligned with the Democrats, Newt might want to call on the House chaplain too.
<P>
<LI>GOP charges that President Clinton gave the final go-ahead for the deadly tank assault against the Branch Davidian compound in Waco are ridiculous. That would have required making a decision.
<P>
<LI>On September 12, the Reverend Jesse Jackson and the Reverend Al Sharpton plan to hold a prayer vigil outside the home of Justice Clarence Thomas. They want Thomas to ``repent'' his opinions on the Supreme Court. Broadly speaking, Thomas's opinions have reflected his view that the law should be color-blind and his regard for the Tenth Amendment. Jackson and Sharpton apparently view this as not merely mistaken but as sinful. No word yet on whether Tawana Brawley will come to the mourners' bench.
<P>
<LI>The number of shooting murders in New York City has dropped by 40 per cent over the last year. The reason: police keep their eyes open for minor offenders -- subway turnstile jumpers, public drinkers, loud boom-box players -- and then frisk them if they act suspiciously when approached. Gun-toting thugs, scared of losing their guns over a loud rap song, are leaving them at home. Some of the highest-crime areas in the city have not had a single shooting since the program began on June 1. Sadly, instead of praising the police, the New York Civil Liberties Union and other civil-rights advocates have attacked the program as discriminatory toward blacks and Hispanics in poor areas. Well, crime fighting has got to happen where the crime is. Don't break any laws and you won't get frisked. Law-abiding citizens have lived in fear of the thugoisie long enough. It's time thugs feared the law.
<P>
<LI>Republican presidential candidates would rather have gone to the Vatican for an audience with John Paul II than to Dallas for a confab with Ross Perot. You only have to kiss the Pope's ring.
<P>
<LI>As the debate over affirmative action heated up, Jack Kemp urged Republicans not to run ``a campaign that separates people by race and by gender.'' A number of conservatives, including NR, jumped on him for jumping on us (see ``Equality of Opportunism,'' Aug. 14). Responding in the<I> Washington Post</I>, Kemp explains what he means by ``affirmative action'' -- which turns out to be the supply-side gospel. Calling quotas ``antithetical to the genius of the American idea,'' Kemp calls for school choice, reforming the tax code, enterprise zones, and free trade. If he added keeping out unskilled aliens who snap up starter jobs from poor Americans, we'd be perfectly pleased, but four completions in five plays is good work, quarterback.
<P>
<LI>A study on affirmative action carried out for Rep. Pat Schroeder (D., Colo.) concluded that affirmative-action remedies for minorities and women in education have not worked. So she is having the report rewritten to reflect her previous views -- namely that affirmative-action remedies for minorities and women have worked and need to be expanded. Call it affirmative action for disadvantaged ideas.
<P>

<LI>Will the amalgam of three unions -- auto workers, steel workers, and machinists -- wield more power than the sum of its parts? When it comes to lobbying politicians or playing hardball with management, one big slush fund can do far more than three smaller ones. But unionism's decline has little to do with politics or the managerial mindset. Currently only 11 per cent of private employment is unionized. That's less than a third of the peak 36 per cent in 1953. Foreign competition and deregulation of key domestic industries have contributed to the decline. But there has also been a profound change in worker attitudes -- except in the public sector. White-collar workers now constitute a majority in both the service and manufacturing sectors. They reject the notion that management's losses are labor's gains. Not surprisingly, surveys show that white-collar workers overwhelmingly prefer individual representation to union representation. An educated workforce may be the biggest union-buster since the Pinkertons.
<P>
<LI>According to Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart (R., Fla.), Fidel Castro boasts that he has no difficulty blackmailing the U.S. because ``Clinton has no backbone and his knees shake.'' We resent that characterization. We can't necessarily deny it, but we resent it.
<P>
<LI>Last year <I> NR </I>suggested that the International Republican Institute was poorly managed and needed to be shaken up or shut down (``The Week,'' Oct. 10). A flurry of indignant letters assured us that the IRI was in mint condition, and accomplishing near miracles in promoting democracy and human rights abroad. Now it seems that the powers that be have come around to our point of view, for IRI Board Chairman Sen. John McCain (R., Ariz.) fired IRI President Bruce McColm at the beginning of August. But the IRI Board still cannot bring itself to look for first-rate Republican talent. Last time around, a nominating committee talked to GOP foreign-policy hands like Elliott Abrams, Paula Dobriansky, and John Bolton -- then kowtowed when Sen. McCain insisted on Mr. McColm, who, though he had an impressive record in human-rights activities, was not even a Republican. This time, the nominating committee did not bother to meet. Sen. McCain insisted on promoting IRI Vice President Lorne Craner, a former McCain Senate staffer. Mr. Craner may be the man for the job, but his role in the IRI under its last two presidents raises doubts. Apparently IRI Board members get free trips abroad, attend a few meetings, and vote as they are told. Kind of like being Cuba's ambassador to the UN.
<P>
<LI>Jacques Chirac set off a public-relations explosion in June when he announced that France, after a three-year moratorium, would conduct eight underground nuclear tests in the Mururoa coral atoll in French Polynesia. Australia, Japan, and New Zealand have protested and organized anti-French boycotts. The ubiquitous Greenpeace is in the act, too, getting ready to infiltrate the site, even though the environmental risks are negligible: the blasts occur deep in the core of an extinct underground volcano; no radioactivity can escape because the blast's heat vitrifies the rock.<I> Cherchez la politique</I>. Anti-nuclear agitation is always directed against Western defense policies and strategies. (No one pressured China to give up its recent testing.) If Greenpeace can veto French defense decisions, it will try to veto ours next. We back Jacques.
<P>
<LI>China announced that Harry Wu has confessed to stealing files from Vincent Foster's office, setting the fire that destroyed the Branch Davidian compound, and causing <I> Waterworld </I>to go millions of dollars over budget.
<P>
<LI>A recent issue of Wellesley College's alumnae magazine contained an article slamming Harvard's legendary President Charles Eliot as a male chauvinist, claiming that in an 1899 address at Wellesley he had said that women's colleges were ``superfluities.'' A Wellesley alumna looked up Eliot's address. In fact, he had said: ``The colleges for women are still regarded by many people as superfluities.'' He then proceeded to disagree vigorously with that view. The alumna sent the correction to the magazine and to the faculty. She received no answer. The magazine made no correction. Instead it printed gleeful letters to the editor based on the assumption of Eliot's chauvinism. Could a Wellesley freshman hand in an English-comp paper using such shoddy methods? Only in the service of such shoddy ideas.
<P>
<LI>Paragon Cable company of New York had the inspired idea of dealing with deadbeat customers by taking away all channels except C-SPAN, forcing them to pay up or else watch the United States Government at work. Money is pouring in.

<BODY>
<CENTER><H2>Letter from Al</H2></CENTER>
<HR>
28-August-1995
<P>
I'm getting a bigger office! 
<P>
For the past couple of years, space has been pretty tight in the West Wing, so I've made do with a smallish office next to the Private Dining Room -- I've always kept my big office across the street in the OEOB, but to be close to Bill, I've pretty much worked out of the West Wing, in an office so cramped that I couldn't open my ThinkPad all the way. 
<P>
Well, finally, there's a little more room. We've knocked down the wall between what used to be Mandy Grunwald's office and what used to be George Stephanopoulos's office, and connected them to what used to be Stan Greenberg's office (right down the hall from what used to be Paul Begala's office) and what used to be Mark Gearan's office. So my office is a little more roomy -- plenty of room on the couch for Bob Squier -- and the walls are finally thick enough that I won't bug Leon Panetta when I play ``Descent'' on my desktop COMPAQ with the HighRes SoundCard on ``Blaster'' mode. 
<P>
And also, finally, the mood around here is a lot lighter -- and not just because we've got more office space. In all honesty, a lot of that space is earmarked for other things -- Mrs. William Jefferson Clinton, for instance, is giving up her West Wing office to the envelope stuffers for the ``Run, Ross, Run!'' campaign. And Park Rangers and Justice Department investigators have sealed off Mack McClarty's office suite until they have fully investigated his strange and unexplained disappearance. 
<P>
Still, even in the heat of August, everyone's cheery. For one thing, Bill's approval ratings are soaring (mine, I may have mentioned, have held solid at 63% for years and years); and for another . . . well, actually, it's just the approval ratings. But that's enough. Not to brag, but when Bill is reaching Gore-like heights of popularity, well, what can I say? I think Tipper's book proposal, ``Surviving the Worst -- Al and Tipper Gore's Year of Trial'' may be a little premature. 
<P>
We've had a string of foreign-policy non-disasters -- starting with normalizing relations with Vietnam. It was time, Rusty, to heal the wounds from that bloody and troubled time in our nation's history. When I voluntarily gave up my college deferment and voluntarily joined the armed forces to serve my country in a war I didn't agree with -- others made a different choice; hey, time to move on; no judgment here -- little did I know how important it would be in the future to keep the Chinese guessing, and how convenient it would be to do that, thirty years later, by allowing the Vietnamese to purchase fully licensed ``Beavis and Butthead'' paraphernalia. Two birds with one stone, Rusty. Three, if you include Bill's war record, which I don't. 
<P>
The second foreign-policy triumph was in Bosnia. We finally put that conflict to rest. Talk about statecraft! Next issue . . .
<P>
So all in all, as we cruise to Labor Day, things are decidedly on the upswing. The mood is positively giddy. When the Secret Service noticed someone lurking around the West Wing looking ``exactly like the Unabomber,'' they wrestled him to the ground and beat him unconscious with their rifle butts. Turned out it was George Stephanopoulos, who had, unbeknownst to any of us, grown a mustache and beard. The Servicemen apologized and apologized, but George was pretty calm about the whole thing -- he took it in stride. There was a time when something like that would have hit the newswires in an instant, but these days, the media's not terribly interested in George Stephanopoulos. I mean, the guy grew a mustache and a beard and no one even knew it. 
<P>
With the poll numbers looking up, we're all breathing a little bit easier on this whole Whitewater matter. The hearings are still going on, but mostly what they've revealed is that the Clintons had a whole lot of friends and a very wide circle of acquaintances, and many of these friends offered the Clintons -- in friendship -- investment advice. (Arkansas is a hotbed of investing, apparently.) And that most of these friends told some of the acquaintances not altogether the truth about these investments, and in any case, they've complied fully with every request for information, except for the requests they haven't, and the documents are being reviewed. 
<P>
See what I mean? I may as well settle in, because I've got an extra four more years surfing the 'Net from this office coming my way! 
<P>
Gotta go! The whole staff is getting together in one of the empty offices to stuff ``Dole in '96'' envelopes.

<HR>
<P>
August 14, 1995
<P>
<H3>Little Girl from Little Rock</H3>
<P><LI>Searching for phrases to describe Hillary Rodham Clinton's first newspaper column, I
find myself sounding like a wine snob: ``a certain naive charm,'' ``fresh and green-tasting with
hints of corn,'' and ``needs plenty of time to mature -- keep in a dark place.''
<P>It may not be Mrs. Clinton's own handiwork, of course. It lacks, for instance, the wacky
sophomoric platitudes of her valedictory address at Wellesley  -- the collected works of Marcuse,
Abbie Hoffman, and the Weathermen put through a blender and spread very thin. Nor does it
have any taint of her earnest postdoctoral search for ``meaning.''
<P>Indeed, she seems to have regressed to the fourth grade, where she is now writing about
``places I have been'' and . . . well, read on:
<P>``I also have met a lot of interesting people. Some are famous, like Lady Bird Johnson,
Nelson Mandela, and Mother Teresa. But most are men and women we never hear about who
wake up in the morning'' etc., etc.
<P>Through all Mrs. Clinton's personality changes, however, a certain Essential Hillary shines
though: bossy, determined, ambitious, and out of her depth.
<P>Once she saw a vision on the Road to Woodstock. It turned out to be an hallucination, or at
any rate it has had very disappointing results. But there is another Vision just around the corner
if only we would keep quiet and follow her. Orders have not worked; perhaps a little soft soap
will do the trick.
<P>Hence, ``. . . this column will give me the chance to talk things over in the hope that some of
you will join the conversation.''
<P>Over to you, Florence.



<P><LI>Recent articles in NR have dealt with the delicate question of what powers should be
given to the FBI in a politicized age. Much depends, of course, on how sophisticated the feds
are; Can they distinguish between a Bollinger Bolshevik and the real thing? 
<P>I am indebted to Bob Conquest for guiding me to a footnote by the distinguished
criminologist, Sir Leon Radzinowicz, about a philosophical policeman from Scotland Yard who
did just that.
<P>Sergeant W. Reiners, of the Metropolitan Police Office, called on Karl Marx in London on
August 1, 1874, in connection with his petition to become a British subject. Marx did not fool
the London bobby.
<P>``He is the notorious German agitator, the head of the International Society, and an advocate
of Communist principles,'' wrote the sleuth in his official report, adding significantly: ``He has
not been loyal to his own King and Country.'' Hence, by implication, he was unlikely to be loyal
to Britain's.
<P>Good work, Sergeant. Keep an eye on the blighter.



<P><LI>May I make clear that the non-appearance of the Trans-O-Gram in this and the previous
issue is not my fault. I have to be categorical about this because the last time it happened, I was
verbally assaulted by a Supreme Court Justice, a distinguished historian, and several elected
officials in a public place.
<P>Mr. Kem Putney, our puzzle-maker, is indisposed. We decided not to run an earlier
Trans-O-Gram because its devotees are hawk-eyed (and so would notice) and passionate (and so
would kick up a fuss). But we may be forced to such a recourse if Mr. Putney's indisposition
continues. 
<P>Just don't blame me. 



<P><LI>And now for a real apology. I am indebted to Richard Cowden Guido for correcting my
quotation from Dostoyevsky. He points out that what Ivan Karamazov actually says in Brothers
Karamazov is that without God ``everything is permissible.''
<P>As Mr. Cowden Guido points out: ``It  was Christ who said that everything is possible, albeit
with God, not without Him.'' Not therefore a trivial mistake.
<P>My apologies and my thanks to Mr. Cowden Guido. In future I will try to live up to
journalism's first rule: Always verify.

<P>
<P><LI>Announcing he was quitting as <B>Bob Dole</B>'s South Carolina co-chairman to
take same job with Sen. <B>Phil Gramm</B>'s presidential campaign, former congressman
<B>Arthur Ravenel</B> cited as reason Dole's chief of staff, <B>Sheila Burke</B>: ``She's a
former liberal Democrat, and she's still liberal, and it's said she has a great deal of influence over
Senator Dole.'' Noting recent outbreak of articles about Burke's influence on Dole -- including
<B>John Fund</B>'s in <I>Wall Street Journal</I> and <B>Rich Lowry</B>'s in <I>NR --
Washington Post</I> ran story with headline ``Dole's Chief of Staff Is Magnet for Criticism.''
<I>Post</I> also quoted conservative activist <B>Paul Weyrich</B>: ``I was the one to fire the
first salvo. Anything good we've gotten from Dole has been over her dead body.'' . . . Dole,
though, has picked up support from unexpected quarter: Arkansas chicken mogul and former
<B>Clinton</B> buddy <B>Don Tyson</B>, whose spokesman says ``Bill Clinton's election is
the worst thing that has ever happened to Tyson Foods and the state of Arkansas.'' . . . Air of
inevitability to entry of <B>Newt Gingrich</B> into presidential race? Gingrich's recent
emphasis to interviewers that Majority Leader <B>Dick Armey</B> runs House on day-to-day
basis may be Speaker's way of preparing colleagues. Newt will take the plunge, says columnist

Sen. <B>Richard Lugar</B> (Ind.). . . . On Democratic side, New York Times clearly worried

<P><LI>Behind the scenes at special Senate committee investigating Whitewater: Serious
consideration given to calling former Whitewater special counsel <B>Bob Fiske</B> as witness.
Fiske said he found no evidence that White House aide <B>Vincent Foster</B> was worried
about Whitewater when he committed suicide. In Foster's handwritten notes which were
available to Fiske, however, the committee found plenty. Fiske was initially recommended for
counsel's spot by ex-Clinton counsel <B>Bernard Nussbaum</B>, who has emerged in
committee hearings as leader of efforts to block police from searching Foster's office. In private
practice, Nussbaum and Fiske were friends and gave each other client referrals. . . . Whitewater
panel member Sen. <B>Frank Murkowski</B> (R., Alaska) hit front pages by holding up
Foster's briefcase to show Clinton aides couldn't have missed suicide note inside. He also
prompted first Watergate-style malapropism from defensive Democrats. Thrashing around with
briefcase, indignant Clinton defender Sen. <B>John Kerry</B> (D., Mass.) announced -- in a
quote gleefully used by conservative journalists -- ``When you pull the files out, the briefcase
closes essentially shut. You can't see in it. I can't see in it. Nobody could see in it.''

<head><title>IN DISPUTE -- NR</title></head>
<BODY>
<CENTER><H2>
The Cigar, Revisited</H2></CENTER>
<HR>
<P>
WILLIAM A. RUSHER
<P>
August 14, 1995
<P>
Mr. Rusher, NR's former publisher, is a Senior Fellow at the Claremont Institute.
<P>
IN THE special section on ``Pleasure & Its Perils'' in the May 1 issue of NATIONAL REVIEW, our young literary editor, David Klinghoffer, took a swing at ``pretended pleasures.'' He cites two well-known examples: one (the ``white lie,'' as in ``Doesn't the bride look lovely?'') that he approves, and one (which might be called the ``white laugh,'' since it involves laughing at a joke that isn't funny) about which he is somewhat more reserved.
<P>
Then he goes on to scorn -- quite properly, in my opinion -- those who pretend to virtue by admiring what is not admirable but only fashionable (bad foreign films, for example), or by ``abstaining from anything that might prematurely deprive [them] of life in this world: fatty foods, booze, and, above all, cigarettes.'' That sets him up for his final fusillade against water bars, coffee bars, and similar establishments that replace ``the old-fashioned, sinful kind of bar where alcohol and tobacco are ingested.''
<P>
But then Mr. Klinghoffer makes a fatal misstep, complaining that in Manhattan ``The first restaurant for cigar smokers has already opened. . . . Today, one chooses . . . not a cigarette (which is inhaled) but a cigar (which is not). . . . In sticking to safe pleasures such as a cigar, and extolling them as if they were the real thing, a person declares his allegiance to the leading ideology of the day: . . . secular left-liberalism, which took God from us and now seeks to take away even the consolation of genuine pleasure.''
Cigars ``not the real thing''? David, my boy, you have a lot to learn.
<P>
First, let's dispose of the notion that the pleasure of a good cigar must be faked because a cigar isn't inhaled. It's true that a cigar smoker doesn't (simply because he can't) inhale the way a cigarette smoker does: drawing huge billows of smoke into his mouth and thence directly into his lungs, to be exhaled in a great white cloud. Cigar smoke is stronger and thicker than cigarette smoke, and inhaling it that way is simply an invitation to choke.
<P>
But watch a cigar smoker carefully. He will draw smoke from the cigar into his mouth, exhale it gently, and then -- when it has mixed with the air -- inhale a portion of the mixture into his lungs, thereafter exhaling it quietly and almost invisibly. And the air around him will remain perfumed with cigar smoke, and available for further inhalation, almost until he draws on the cigar again.
<P>
In other words, the whole point of smoking a cigar is to savor its aroma and flavor, gentled by the air (and, of course to obtain the agreeable ``nicotine fix'' that all tobacco provides). There is nothing ``pretended'' about it. As a matter of fact, I would argue that smoking a good cigar is one of the most superbly sensual pleasures known to man. (And perhaps spiritual too -- a priest I know calls a cigar ``a sacrament.'')
What's more, just now -- right at the apogee of the national anti-smoking hysteria, when everyone's hand is turned against them -- cigars are making a comeback in the United States that deserves to be called historic. The broader cause is a pronounced upswing in the number of men who have decided to spend a little money on enjoying themselves before they die; but the immediate precipitating factor is a new quarterly magazine called Cigar Aficionado, published by Marvin Shanken, who also publishes The Wine Spectator.
<P>
Shanken is a journalistic genius who is well on his way to cornering the market in magazines catering to those in search of self-indulgent luxury. Simply to thumb through his two publications, reading the come-hither articles and looking at the ads (for everything from humidors to yachts), is to be introduced to a world of unrepentant enjoyment.
<P>
Cigar Aficionado was launched only about three years ago, but it has already led to a humongous boom in cigar sales  -- above all, in sales of the very best cigars. Cigar purveyors are being swamped with orders they cannot fill for months; cigar manufacturers are stepping up production as fast as they can, all too aware that they dare not sacrifice quality lest they ruin the reputation of their finest products. Predictably, cigar prices are going through the roof. But nobody seems to care.
<P>
On April 19 every one of the 31 Ritz Carlton Hotels in the world participated in an ``International Cigar Celebration,'' in the form of a sumptuous black-tie dinner (at $200 a plate) from which those attending took away (if they had not already smoked) eight superb cigars, including a Temple Hall Belicoso, a Partagas Limited Reserve, and a Macanudo Prince of Wales. I was number 54 on the waiting list for the affair at the San Francisco Ritz Carlton until a well-connected friend took pity on me and pulled the necessary strings.
<P>
Telling the two hundred guests at that dinner (most of them not old fogies like myself, but young San Francisco businessmen clearly on their way up) that they were proclaiming their ``allegiance to the leading ideology of the day: . . . secular left-liberalism'' would have invited either hilarity or fisticuffs. I doubt that anybody there was to the left of Newt Gingrich.
<P>
Like anything else, cigars can be overdone. One could, I am sure, smoke too many. (I recently heard of one nonagenarian who has cut back from twenty a day to eight.) And lately, as a result of Marvin Shanken's indefatigable promotion of their pleasures (and perhaps in an attempt to justify the resulting prices), efforts to describe the ineffable characteristics of particular cigars have begun to display the metaphorical excess that has long bedeviled the description of fine wines: e.g., ``filled with cocoa and coffee-bean flavors backed up by smooth woody and leathery notes'' (Cigar Aficionado, Spring 1995).
<P>
But these are quibbles. In the context of contemporary American culture, a good cigar is almost as eloquent as those little American flags that so many of us wore on our lapels in the early 1970s. It proclaims, first of all, that one is an individualist, not easily lured into the deadening conformity of cigarettes -- or, worse yet, into the smug self-righteousness of the health fascists of the anti-smoking brigade. It asserts, second, that the cigar-smoker believes in pleasure, is ready to seek it and spend money on it, and takes time to smell, if not the flowers, then at least the seductive aromas of the humidor. Finally, by its historic identification with good food, it speaks also of a high regard for the delights of the table.
<P>
``Allegiance to secular left-liberalism''? David, what do you think are passed at Bill Buckley's home, after one of Pat's magnificent dinners? What can you hear interfering, every so often, with Rush Limbaugh's enunciation as he sits there at the microphone lecturing his troops?
<P>
De gustibus non est disputandum. But for me, at least, when I have finished lunch and settled into my favorite leather armchair at my club, the Cigar Hour that follows (best of all, of course, with a new issue of NR to read) is the very quintessence of felicity -- and of conservatism.

August 14 1995
<P>

<LI>President Clinton has finally had it with Bosnia. He's thinking of deploying the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.



<P><LI>Item by item, the Contract with America is falling a couple of Republican senators
short of enactment. Regulatory reform is the latest victim. By the time the reform bill hit the
Senate floor in July it had been weakened to such an extent -- no provision for applying the
reforms to current rules; weakened provisions for judicial review of regulations -- that it had lost
the support of free-marketeers like the Competitive Enterprise Institute. Even then it was headed
for trouble with the Democrats. They set up a negotiating troika of John Kerry (Mass.), Carl
Levin (Mich.), and John Glenn (Ohio) that was less interested in compromise than in scuttling
the bill. One list of demands the negotiators submitted to Republicans actually had an asterisk
reserving the right to make more demands -- just in case the current ones were met. Meanwhile,
the OMB's czarina of regulatory affairs, Sally Katzen, kept up a drumbeat of outrageous charges,
while the media, especially ABC News, retailed its own (children dying from tainted meat
topped the list). The GOP response was lost in the buzz. In the end, Bob Dole got all
Republicans, even prodigal moderates like John Chafee, to vote for cloture on the bill. But that
wasn't enough. And it won't be until Senate Republicans get some new colleagues.



<P><LI>In the game of inside baseball, Florida Senator Connie Mack, grandson of the
legendary Philadelphia A's owner, recently hit a grand slam, as Senate Republicans adopted most
of the internal-rule reforms he had been pushing. Henceforth, at the beginning of each new
Congress, Republican senators will vote to adopt an agenda, a mini Contract with America. A
committee's choice of its chairman -- are you listening Mark Hatfield? John Chafee? -- must now
be ratified by a secret vote of the whole GOP conference. And committee chairmen will be
limited to six-year terms. All of this tends to chip away at the senatorial independence that has
made it possible for Republican senators to abandon key provisions of the Contract. Adoption of
the rules is the best thing that could have happened to Senate Republicans this year -- short of
Mark Hatfield's being sent down to the minors.



<P><LI>Yes, we want the Supreme Court rebuked sometime, somewhere. But is the
flag-burning amendment the right time and place? If Congress really wanted to light a fire under
the Court, it would invoke Article III, Section 2 (``. . . the Supreme Court shall have appellate
jurisdiction, both as to law and fact, with such exceptions, and under such regulations as the
Congress shall make''). Passing an amendment concedes the Court's power. Besides, if we need
an amendment to undo every judicial outrage, the Constitution will look like a flea market.
Leave the junk business to the courts.



<P><LI>When Harold Rogers (R., Ky.), chairman of the Commerce, Justice, State, and
Judiciary Subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee, decided to triple funding for
programs instituted by last year's Violence Against Women Act, from $25 million to $75
million, congressional women, including Republican Conference Vice Chairman Susan
Molinari, howled at his stinginess. Any funding below the Clinton Administration's $175-million
request, it seems, is sheer misogyny. Appropriations Committee Chairman Bob Livingston (La.)
-- a good cop working in a bad neighborhood -- tried to stand his ground, but a compromise
eventually sent an additional $40 million into an account for battered-women programs, much of
which will end up in the pockets of the feminist Left. Republicans need this old-style politics
like a fish needs a bicycle.



<P><LI>The White House report on affirmative action includes the following triple-negative
doozy: ``The federal programs . . . do not unduly burden non-beneficiaries.'' In English (we hope
this does not unduly burden non-English speakers), that means the onus that affirmative action
currently imposes on men and whites is, well, due. Call it the white man's burden.



<P><LI>Feminists and gay-rights advocates have taken a new turn into the perverse. Congress is
considering legislation -- put forward by Gary Ackerman (D., N.Y.) and Tom Coburn (R., Okla.)
-- to require states to test newborns for HIV, just as they test for diseases like syphilis and
sickle-cell anemia. The advantages of knowing a baby's HIV status are many. The child can be
treated immediately with AZT, which may reduce his chances of actually developing AIDS. The
mother can avoid breast-feeding, which transmits AIDS. Finally, special precautions can be
taken to protect the child against illnesses like pneumonia. But the sexual radicals don't bother
with details. The proposed testing of babies, the president of the New York City chapter of NOW
recently wrote, ``is just one example of the erosion of a woman's right to control her own [sic]
body.'' Gay-rights activists, meanwhile, don't like the idea of any testing. Forget ``Suffer the little
children.'' Try, Let the little children suffer.



<P><LI>Officials of the Republican National Committee arrived at the office one morning to
discover that most of their issues had been stolen. They were later found in the Oval Office, but
Clinton aides say they have no idea how they got there.



<P><LI>Malcolm S. (Steve) Forbes Jr. is thinking of joining the field of Republican presidential
candidates, and why not? In an earlier era his scant political resume would have been an
automatic disqualification, but when preachers, talking heads, and billionaires seek the Oval
Office, Forbes's eight years as chairman of the Board of International Broadcasting make him
seem like John Adams. Forbes represents the total-immersion wing of the supply-side
movement; his main issues are the flat tax and sound money. He thinks prosperity will solve
many of the problems that underlie the social issues. He is also unimpressed with the Beltway
fixation on balancing the budget. By itself, this seems too meager to serve as a winning formula
for him, or for the GOP. But it was certainly part of Ronald Reagan's winning formula. It would
not be a bad thing to add it to the current Republican mix.



<P><LI>Michael Lind has been described as a man full of learning, information -- and himself.
Evidence of the last appears in a review of Dick Armey's new book, <I>The Freedom
Revolution</I>, in which Mr. Lind blithely accuses the congressman of having ``bungled his
math.'' Armey had written that an individual in the lowest fifth of all incomes in 1979 was more
likely to have advanced to the top quintile ten years later than to have remained mired in the
lowest group. That struck Mr. Lind as a politically inspired howler. It isn't. Armey's statement is
verified by a Treasury Department study that tracked the ups and downs of 14,000 taxpayers
during the Eighties. Treasury found that roughly 17 per cent of the people who were in the
lowest income bracket during a typical Eighties year rose to a higher bracket in the following
year. As a result, only 14 per cent of those people stuck at the bottom in 1979 were still there ten
years later, while 15 per cent had made it to the highest income bracket. These success stories
were mainly baby-boomers, not unlike Mr. Lind himself. Unfortunately, he thinks he's the only
one.



<P><LI>Acting in unseemly haste, the U.S. Congress is voting on whether to move a statue of
some suffragettes up from the Capitol basement, where it has been sitting since 1921.



<P><LI>The banking industry's version of the abominable snowman has been spotted once
again. After massaging data from a notoriously flawed study by the Boston Federal Reserve
Bank, researchers at the Chicago Fed now claim that banks do indeed reject blacks more often
than equally qualified whites. It's not necessarily racism, mind you. William C. Hunter, author of
the latest study, allows as how bank credit officers, who are overwhelmingly white, simply have
trouble relating to applicants who are from different cultural and economic backgrounds. But if
cultural biases are at work, will Mr. Hunter explain why the relative denial rates by race are the
same at black-owned banks as white-owned banks? And why the default rates on loans approved
for blacks and Hispanics are about the same as for whites? Bankers care about money, not race.



<P><LI>``The GOP is on the brink of being embroiled in a bitter and untidy debate about
immigration reform,'' begins Jamie Dettner's story in the estimable <I>Insight</I> magazine. But
Dettner, otherwise perceptive, illustrates one reason for the untidiness. He relies on the Urban
Institute's estimates of immigrant welfare participation and net fiscal impact. But those estimates
are the result of manipulation, as UC San Diego Professor George Borjas showed in the April 17
NR. The Institute eliminates the immigration problem by eliminating problem immigrants -- for
example, Mexicans are removed from the total on the grounds that many are illegal, although
Mexico is also the leading source of <I>legal</I> immigrants. Authors Jeffrey Passel and Barry
Edmonston have yet to challenge Borjas. But in the one-way immigration debate permitted by
our political elite, they probably figure they don't have to.



<P><LI>Rebels in the Sudan captured some UN workers and then, for unknown and
unimaginable reasons, let them go. Like, we want them back or something?



<P><LI>Senator Jesse Helms has proposed a landmark foreign-policy bill that would (among
other things) abolish three semi-autonomous agencies -- the U.S. Information Agency (USIA),
the foreign-aid dispensing Agency for International Development (AID), and the Arms Control
and Disarmament Agency (ACDA) -- and fold their residual functions into the State Department.
The Helms bill has, deservedly, garnered widespread support. But Senator Joseph Lieberman has
offered an amendment that would preserve USIA's autonomy, on the grounds that its unique
``public diplomacy'' function (which includes supervision of the Voice of America) is better
served by a degree of independence from State Department micromanagement. We join many
prominent conservatives -- Jeane Kirkpatrick, Malcolm Wallop, Steve Forbes, Ed Feulner,
Michael Novak, Eugene Rostow, Richard John Neuhaus -- in seconding his motion.



<P><LI>Bill Clinton's effort to tar the Republicans as ``isolationists'' is not working abroad. The
Polish foreign minister met with Senator Dole in mid July and came away with a sense of what's
good for Poland. According to the <I>Financial Times</I>, he ``expressed doubts about the
Clinton Administration's commitment to early NATO enlargement, and suggested that his
government was already looking to a Republican President to make good on the promise after
next year's presidential election.'' All the progess in East - West relations, he added, had been
made under Republican Presidents.



<P><LI><I>New York Newsday</I> folded after ten years, victim of journalistic economics,
and of the lack of a constituency for blue-collar liberalism. In the tabloid's last week on earth,
some PC gnome changed a reference to The Five Blind Boys of Alabama, the black gospel
group, to The Five Blind Men of Alabama. Another year, and it would have been The Five
Visually Challenged Persons of the Cherokee Homeland.



<P><LI><I>Kids</I>, the hot new movie critics call ``frank,'' ``serious,'' and a ``wake-up call to
the world,'' recounts a day in the life of a middle-class white Manhattan teenager, who takes
frightening quantities of illicit drugs, talks in unremitting obscenities, beats a black man
senseless with his buddies, and pursues his hobby of deflowering virgins. He also has AIDS.
<I>Kids</I> is nothing new for the Disney-owned film distributor Miramax and its chief,
Harvey Weinstein, who brought you <I>The Crying Game</I> (adventures of a transvestite),
<I>Pulp Fiction</I> (shocking violence as cool humor), and the Catholic-bashing <I>Priest</I>.
Yet when <I>Kids</I> received an NC-17 rating, Disney pretended to draw the line by refusing
to let Weinstein market it under the Miramax name. So Weinstein set up an ``independent''
distributor called Excalibur. You know -- like <I>The Sword in the Stone</I>.



<P><LI>You are Rodney King. <I>The</I> Rodney King. And you are on a roll. Back in 1991
you led police on a 100-mph chase through Los Angeles and then tried to slug it out with them.
Those guys were rough, but when they were acquitted you had the Big R, man, that's Riot, a
billion-dollar riot. Nobody disses Rodney King any more, man. You are Rodney King. Yes, you
have been picked up twice since then for DWI. Yes, you have been picked up twice for
wife-beating. And, oh yes, you picked up a prostitute who turned out to be a transvestite and so
you tried to run him over. You're on a roll. Maybe you'll star in a movie with Hugh Grant. No
one can put Rodney King in jail, not <I>the</I> Rodney King. They dis Rodney King, they've
got another billion-dollar riot. Hop in. We can get from here to Santa Monica in ninety seconds.
Take a pull on this Old Screech Owl.



<P><LI>From the <I>New York Times</I>: ``Sounding hoarse but robust, President Boris
Yeltsin appeared on television from his hospital room here tonight to prove that while he was
sick, he was not as sick as the Kremlin had led people to believe by insisting he was fine.''

RAMESH PONNURU
<BR><I>
Mr. Ponnuru is NR's national reporter.

<P>
August 14, 1995
<P>
WASHINGTON, D.C.
<P>
``IF WE oppose set-asides and quotas,'' the memo began, ``we must be willing to support policies that will achieve equal opportunity for all, as opportunity has not been equal and is not currently equal for blacks, women, and others.'' No, the memo wasn't part of the Clinton Administration's internal review of affirmative action. Representative Nancy Johnson (Conn.) sent it to her Republican colleagues, whom she urged to adopt a ``clear, positive message on affirmative action.'' Specifically, she wanted them ``to offer women significant opportunities to compete in sports''; to let universities and employers take race and sex into account; to treat ``evidence of affirmative hiring processes'' as ``presumptive evidence of non-discrimination, encouraging employers to develop these processes''; and to favor ``socially and economically disadvantaged contractors plus women-owned companies'' in federal contracting. Her conclusion: ``Just as quotas are bad, so outlawing any consideration of difference is wrong.'' In other words, scrap preferences -- but keep preferences.
<P>
It's not a very inspiring battle-cry. Mrs. Johnson has at times seemed fearful that even Bill Clinton would go too far in criticizing preferences: she later issued the memo, slightly altered, as a press release directed at him (``Johnson Urges President to Support Affirmative Action Policies That Will Achieve Equal Opportunity for All''). Since her memo reflects the thinking of many liberal Republicans, it may prove difficult to keep them on board for an affirmative-action rollback. Indeed, the problem is not only Republican liberals: the party as a whole has shown little enthusiasm for moving toward a race-neutral legal regime.
<P>
Scrapping affirmative action wasn't supposed to be this hard. Just three months ago, the conventional wisdom held that it was about to crumble. The Congress started promisingly by killing a minority tax break; William Kristol lauded it for ``opening the entire, rusted arsenal of federal 'affirmative action' provisions to real, meaningful debate at last.'' Most of the Republican presidential candidates called for major reform. So did candidate Clinton. The California Civil Rights Initiative, designed to ban racial and sexual preferences in state hiring, contracting, and university admissions, seemed unstoppable, and sure to keep the issue in the spotlight through November 1996. Now Clinton is reaffirming the status quo, Republicans are addressing the issue tepidly if at all, the California campaign is having trouble raising funds, and the ``meaningful debate'' is stalled.
<P>Getting the 700,000 valid signatures necessary for the CCRI to qualify for the ballot will take roughly $1 million. Large Republican donors have not been opening their pocketbooks fast enough to meet that goal. The recent appointment of San Diego businessman Darrell Issa as co-chairman of the campaign may improve the situation. But national Republican leaders have largely failed to respond to requests for help. When Glynn Custred, one of the two academics who proposed the CCRI, visited Washington, D.C., in April to garner support, officials at the Republican National Committee stood him up. Lamar Alexander and Pete Wilson quickly endorsed the measure -- the latter even signing a fund-raising letter for it -- but other Republican presidential candidates have dragged their feet. Wilson's support has brought some disadvantages: by persuading the University of California Board of Regents to abandon racial preferences, he has removed some of the urgency of passing the CCRI. And the initiative has become so associated with his presidential bid that some conservative figures now appear unwilling to aid it.
<P>
ACTIVISTS in Washington have also had reason to doubt the commitment of Republicans. Repeated delays in the introduction of a bill by Bob Dole and Charles Canady to stop mandating preferences in federal hiring, contracting, and program administration have exasperated them. (Dole now promises to introduce it in late July.) A narrower proposal by Phil Gramm to end some federal set-asides by cutting off appropriations for them failed in the Senate thanks to 19 Republican defections. Not a single senator joined Gramm in speaking for the proposal during two hours of debate.
<P>
Clint Bolick of the Institute for Justice, who coordinates conservative efforts on preferences, calls Canady ``a congressional hero . . . both a solid rock and a moving force.'' Hearings before Canady's subcommittee, however, have disconcerted preference opponents. When preference supporters make a foolish or offensive comment, nobody calls them on it. When Democrats verbally abuse witnesses, Republicans don't fight back. Barbara Ledeen of the Independent Women's Forum still fumes recalling her testimony in April: at one point every Republican congressman but Canady left, while all the Democrats stayed. Republicans have been more effective in recent hearings, but the difference in intensity persists.
The Republicans' lack of focus on affirmative action results partly from legislators having their hands full with issues -- like the budget, Medicare, and welfare reform -- that have been deemed more important. In addition, congressmen are unfamiliar with the issue and reluctant to confront it. Democrats see preferences as a bread-and-butter issue politically, while Republicans merely have a mild preference against preferences. And as one staffer explains, ``It's no fun . . . being called racist, being compared to Hitler. There are a lot of weak knees.''
<P>
Some Republicans fear that attacking affirmative action could endanger an imminent breakthrough in black support for the party. David Bositis, who studies minority politics at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, pours cold water on the notion that a breakthrough is around the corner, and suggests that affirmative action would not necessarily prevent one anyway. Blacks willing to listen to what Republicans have to say, he contends, ``would be turned off if it were perceived that the Republicans were approaching this as a wedge issue,'' but not if they ``were going on principle.'' Moreover, at least one-third of black voters have long been skeptical of affirmative action.
<P>
Concern over the black vote has nonetheless led Republicans, including Newt Gingrich and Bob Dole, to seek a ``positive'' message to complement opposition to racial preferences. They want to link repeal to ``empowerment'' measures like school choice and enterprise zones, a tactic with undoubted appeal. Others fear, however, that this tactic both makes empowerment seem a crass, opportunistic ploy to appease blacks and concedes that abolishing racial preferences is a step for which Republicans should apologize. ``Color-blindness is so good in itself that you shouldn't have to link it with anything,'' says John Miller, vice president of the Center for Equal Opportunity. If Republicans want to win black votes, Bolick says, ``The key thing is a Republican presidential candidate who is willing to campaign in black churches, not a cobbled-together legislative package.''
<P>
Miller also complains that nobody is attacking ``the worst violations of color-blindness, the ones that have made the issue'': preferences in college admissions and in the private sector. Republicans are not proposing to change the legal rules that push the private sector toward quotas (e.g., treating employment practices that have a statistically ``disparate impact'' as discriminatory). Those rules were codified in the Civil Rights Act of 1991 with the support of most Republicans, many of them still on the Hill. One staffer notes, ``To require them to change their votes would kill this thing coming out of the gates.'' It would also draw opposition from big business, which has a large stake in current policies.
<P>
Sluggishness on preferences now may make the issue loom larger in 1996 -- an effect some Republican politicians will welcome. But proponents of color-blindness fear that race relations will deteriorate as long as preferences survive, creating opportunities for demagogues of all colors. They want to eliminate preferences now. But first they will have to overcome what Representative Johnson calls ``the proud history of Republicans in creating and using affirmative action.''

Works in Progress
<P>
<LI>With this issue, NATIONAL REVIEW appears in a splendid new design -- the work of our talented art director, Luba Kolomytseva. We hope that readers find it easy on the eye and enticing to read.
<P>
But further improvements will doubtless occur to Mrs. Kolomytseva after publication. And we are always attentive to suggestions from readers. Consider it a work in progress.


<P>
<LI>Exactly five years ago -- the last time that flag-burning was a political issue -- I wrote on this page: ``. . . [a] constitutional amendment would paradoxically make the flag a symbol of national disunity and partisan passions over two long years. It would be better perhaps to allow the odious antics of a few America-haters to remind the other 247 million Americans of the fundamental patriotism that unites them.''
<P>I am inclined to be even more liberal today. There has been little flag-burning in the last five years -- perhaps because the ``odious antics of a few
America-haters''<I> have</I> reminded the other 247 million Americans of the fundamental patriotism that unites them. Certainly the election results suggest so.
<P>More significantly, if expressive actions are a form of speech protected by the First Amendment, then common sense suggests that flag-burning is indeed closer to the political speech the Founding Fathers thought they were protecting than expressive actions such as nude dancing.
<P>Of course, I do not grant that expressive actions <I>are</I> constitutionally protected speech. But since I seem to have lost that battle, let me exploit my defeat.
<P>If flag-burning is protected by the First Amendment, so surely are cigar- and cigarette-burning. They clearly express hostility to the puritan regulation of our pleasures by a politically correct New Class of bureaucrats. 
<P>This argument seems stronger if the smoker is a non-smoker because his motives are presumably less mixed. The smoker might be smoking for enjoyment rather than for protest. But such an objection is easily countered: the right to free speech has never been invalidated on the grounds that the speaker liked the sound of his own voice (though, come to think of it . . . ).
<P>So, light up. You are employing your constitutional right to free speech -- and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.


<P>
<LI>O'Sullivan's Law -- ``An organization that is not explicitly right-wing will become left-wing over time'' -- continues to be confirmed by reality. 
<P>The latest organization to illustrate it is Action for Children's Television. Back in 1971, ACT asked the Federal Communications Commission to exercise greater control over television programming because (among other reasons) ``parents, no matter how attentive, sincere, or knowledgeable, are not in a position to really exercise effective control'' over what programs their children see. 
<P>By 1987, 1990, and 1994, however, ACT was leading the charge in challenging FCC bans on the late-evening broadcasting of indecent programs. It now took the view that children were at home during those hours and parents were able to supervise their TV fare.
<P>Lights! Camera! Inaction!


<P>
<LI>Friends are pressing me to run for President, but I am as yet undecided. 
<P>They argue, very plausibly, that with Jack Kemp sitting this one out, no candidate represents the upbeat, optimistic, generous-hearted spirit of the modern Republican Party. That I possess these qualities almost to excess will be confirmed by my bankers. On the other hand, February in New Hampshire is extremely cold, and I do not ski. 
<P>
The choice is a finely balanced one. I shall ponder my options through the summer, exploring the national mood through the pages of the
<I>Manchester Union-Leader</I> and working on the problem of how it is that taxes always seem to rise even when they fall. 
<P>Come Labor Day, I shall either announce for President, or not, as the mood takes me.

<LI>Are House Democrats in a self-destruct mode? First came resignations by Reps. <B>Billy Tauzin</B> (D., La.),<B> Mike Parker</B> (D., Miss.),<B> Jimmy Hayes </B>(D., La.), and <B>Greg Laughlin</B> (D., Tex.), from Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee after it issued document by House Whip <B>David Bonior</B> (D., Mich.) attacking their position on Clean Water Act. A week later, Laughlin and 18 other Texas officials formally switched to GOP. (Number of such switches since <B>Bill Clinton </B>took office: 105.) . . . <I>Time</I> magazine reports congressional Democrats say ``Clinton has all but abandoned them on central issues'' and that ``more defections are probably coming'' in House. ``My guess would be a half dozen more will probably make the change before the snows of next winter melt,'' says <B>Newt Gingrich's </B>press secretary, super-savvy <B>Tony Blankley</B>. . . . <I>Business Week</I> reports that GOP strategists looking toward '96 ``think they can pick up 20 more House seats to pad their current 232 to 202 edge.'' Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairman <B>Martin Frost</B> (D., Tex.) admits ``as many as 50 Democratic seats remain in play.'' . . . All this has mood turning nasty in House Democratic caucus. Queried whether he will leave his party soon, Tauzin says: ``I haven't been in the party for years.'' . . . ``The Democratic what?'' asked Rep. <B>Charles Rangel </B>(D., N.Y.), when asked how Democratic leadership is doing. Rep.<B> Bill Richardson</B> (D., N.M.) turned reflective: ``I think that for the morale of our troops we need some victories.''
<P>
<LI>Clinton's latest political make-over proceeding quickly as one-time GOP consultant <B>Richard Morris</B> elbows more liberal White House aides out of the way and gets Prez to return to his old ``middle class'' themes. GOP pollster <B>Alex Castellanos</B> sees the logic here: ``They're trying to move from something Bill Clinton's not very good at, which is being President.'' . . . GOP staffers doing negative research for '96 race are filling quivers as frustrated Democrats pop off at Prez. ``He is driven by polls and not conviction,'' says <B>Jesse Jackson.</B> And Sen. <B>Ernest Hollings</B> (D., S.C.): ``He's one of the most inadequate Presidents we've ever had, but one of the best campaigners.'' Meanwhile, only 36 per cent of Arkansas voters now say they would vote to re-elect Bill Clinton. . . .

<H2><CENTER> Was Ames A Mortal Blow?
</CENTER></H2>
<HR>




<P>
NEW YORK, JULY 4
<P>

A legislator who is critically important on such questions as who gets U.S. funding managed a very brief exchange at an affair too noisy to permit fine conversational calibrations. He asked, ``Do you think the CIA can be saved?'' I murmured that I hoped so. He shook his head mournfully. ``I don't think so, not after Ames.''<P>
The reference was to Aldrich Ames. Four books about his treachery were reviewed over the weekend in the <I>New York Times</I> and most of what was said was vaguely familiar, including that ten Russians were martyred at his dirty hands. Less prominent in the memory was the extraordinary behavior of CIA security. Ames disguised himself about as subtly as King Kong, but it seemed that there was nothing he could do blatant enough to attract the attention of the agency whose mission it is to protect the security of the United States and protect the friends of freedom who risk their lives by joining the resistance movement. During those days, 1985 - 91, Mr. Ames feared one thing. Not the CIA or the FBI or the OMB. He feared that friends of the men he was betraying, month after month, would notice the gory disappearance of a member of the resistance and advise Washington that obviously there had been a betrayal. One or two such signals did get through, but it occurred to nobody in charge at the CIA to rope in the alcoholic traitor even though he had become so carefree in his habit that he removed from Langley not discreet copies, but the original documents identifying our hidden friends in the Soviet Union. 
<P>
One recalls the trauma in Great Britain when they caught on to Kim Philby, the traitor who gleefully consigned to death any number of British patriots. Eventually Philby wrote his memoirs, and the reviewer for the <I>Daily Telegraph</I> was Lord Birkenhead, gone to the House of Lords after a legendary record as a trial lawyer. Birkenhead wrote: ``We shall never know how many agents were killed or tortured as a result of Philby's work as a double agent. He is now safe in Russia, and we must, alas, abandon any wistful dream of seeing this little carrion gibbeted.'' Well, Ames isn't in Russia, but we don't hang our traitors.
<P>
Nor, the authors of the Ames books advise us, do we do very much about those who made possible the extravagant treason of Ames. The question seriously arises whether the Agency itself can be rescued. 
<P>
The view is widely held that James Jesus Angleton was the dominant figure in the collapse of CIA security. This is ironic, because Angleton is associated with the sternest of views on security. He was an intellectual, a poet, a gourmet, an aesthete, and a very tough hombre. He had been a close friend of Kim Philby, and when he learned that Philby was a traitor, it affected his powers of reasoning. He became so suspicious, he thought almost every approach by a Russian official was a venture in double agentry. He approached me, on one occasion, requesting support for the publication of a book whose thesis was that the break between Moscow and Peking was a phony, concocted to conceal the ongoing Communist monolith. When he came to my house, the Russian author he desired me to meet, who came in a separate car, was given instructions on an order of exactitude I'd have been embarrassed to write into any of my spy novels. 
<P>
But whatever the causes of disrepair, one hopes that Congress will not go so far as to drop the CIA. Reforms are presumably needed, and were attempted by the Church Committee in 1975, but these were largely miscast, requiring a degree of intimacy between the Executive and the Legislative that is unrealistic.
<P>
But the point is that continued intelligence is critical. Whether Mr. Deutsch,  the new director of the CIA, can get the job done isn't known, though his credentials are good; and it is true that a job worth doing is worth doing even badly.
<P>Thanks to Mr. Ames, it may be another generation before a freedom-loving North Korean, Chinese, Iraqi, Iranian, or Libyan takes the risk of sending secrets for the benefit of the United States. But making the effort to penetrate to the secret designs and resources of such countries would appear to be a strategy more important, even, than an auto-da-fe over our mishandling of the traitor Ames.

31-July-1995



<P>
<LI>A Kansas judge has given permission to exhume the remains of Jesse James. First Zachary Taylor, then John Wilkes Booth, now James. They'll be going for Al Gore next.
<P>
<LI>If good things come to those who wait, the Republican assault on affirmative action will be something to behold. A bill to ban preferences in federal hiring and contracting is said to be forthcoming from Representative Charles Canady (R., Fla.) and, more importantly, Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole. But it was supposed to be forthcoming before -- namely in late June, until Dole abruptly canceled the press conference he had called to announce his bill. Behind some of the GOP skittishness is the idea that large numbers of minority voters are on the verge of joining the GOP (``We are very close to a major breakthrough with black voters,'' one House leadership aide explained to the Washington Times), and that attacking affirmative action will alienate them. Maybe. And maybe not -- polls have always shown large numbers of black Americans opposed to racial quotas. But whatever the politics, abandoning race neutrality as a principle would be too high a price to pay for a breakthrough with anyone. Speaker Newt Gingrich says he understands this and pledged in a recent letter to the New York Times that it is his intention that ``the final [GOP] policy reflect the historic American ideal that personal success and happiness are best achieved through individual liberty and equal justice under the law.'' We're waiting.
<P>
<LI>John Stuart Mill thought that recipients of government benefits shouldn't be allowed to vote -- they're too self-interested. But should they lobby? Legislation proposed by GOP Representatives David McIntosh (Ind.), Ernest Istook (Okla.), and Bob Ehrlich (Md.) would prevent any organization that receives federal funds from spending more than 5 per cent of its non-federal income on political advocacy. Representative Bob Dornan (Calif.) goes further. He would cut off all tax-exempt advocacy groups like the American Association of Retired Persons from federal grants (in FY1994 the AARP got $73 billion in federal support). Meanwhile, neither charitable non-profits nor for-profit corporations could lobby on any matter related to any federal grants or contracts they receive. Both proposals hit the Left where it lives, so they're meeting outraged opposition on Capitol Hill -- with innocuous groups such as the YMCA taking the lead. But something along Dornan/McIntosh lines is essential to short-circuit the self-perpetuating government machine in Washington. The last thing government should be subsidizing is efforts to make it larger.
<P>
<LI>Donors who pony up $100,000 for the Democratic Party will be rewarded with a dinner with President Clinton. Those donating $50,000 also get to eat with the President, but Hillary shows up.
<P>
<LI>William Bennett, in an interview with The New Yorker, discussed his fellow social conservative Pat Buchanan. ``The worst place to stand in a fight is . . . as someone who was on his side but has now deviated by one step. It's a pathology of small differences with him. A real S&M kind of thing.'' Bennett then repeated charges that some of Buchanan's remarks have been ``flirting with'' fascism. ``This Fortress America stuff, this You the People stuff -- I think it's tricky.'' Tricky indeed, if it makes conservatives resort to left-wing arguments when they disagree. If slightly misquoting the Preamble to the Constitution is flirting with fascism, who is preoccupied with small differences? Mr. Bill wants clients who have been very bad.
<P>
<LI>Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, who submits his own versions of any promising Republican legislative initiatives, has come up with a truly Gephardtian ``flat tax.'' It has five tax brackets, just like the present tax code. The brackets are progressive, also like the present code. The rich get soaked, also like . . . But the rates are, like, rounder numbers, or something. The only thing flat about the tax is how it will fall.
<P>
<LI>Until July 10, every cent that everyone in the country earned was taxed away. Government at all levels takes 52 per cent of net national product. Only this week did we start holding on to what we earn. You may wish to keep these details in mind as you follow the debate in Washington, D.C., which is not about taking less, but about whether to slow the rate of taking more.
<P>
<LI>School choice is taking off in Milwaukee. For the last five years, an experimental program involving 800 children (1.5 per cent of the district's students) has distributed to their families vouchers worth $3,209 each, which can be applied to tuition at private non-sectarian schools in the city. Two weeks ago, the Wisconsin legislature approved Governor Thompson's request to expand the program. Allocated funds will increase from $2.4 million to $14.7 million; 7,000 students will be included, with an increase to 15,000 for the 1996 - 97 school year; and parents will be allowed to use the vouchers at religious schools. Naysayers dispute the benefits of the program, and tremble for the future of the public-school system. But consider: the program saves the state money (because private schools are almost all more efficient); parents are involved in the schools and report overwhelming satisfaction; and the quality of education is at least commensurate if not superior. RIP the public-education monopoly; long live public education.
<P><LI>
As the debate over normalizing relations continues, the White House hasn't decided whether it would be better for President Clinton or the Democratic Party to make the first move toward the other.
<P><LI>
John Major won his gamble and is still prime minister, but the balloting showed that at least a third of Tory MPs wished to be rid of him. Startling too, reports our London correspondent, Anthony Lejeune, was the near unanimity with which Conservative newspapers called for a new leader and new policies. The Majorettes now boast that their media foes were discomfited, although whether Gadarene swine should congratulate themselves on having brushed aside herdsmen crying ``Stop!'' seems doubtful. In the subsequent cabinet reshuffle Major's right-wing critics were excluded while Michael Heseltine, his potential challenger from the Left, was enthroned as deputy prime minister. And on policy Mr. Major has categorically refused to alter course. So the profound ideological split, over Britain's increasing absorption into the European Union and over its tax-and-spend policies, gapes as wide as ever. If the Conservatives had been defeated at the last election, they might now be undergoing a Republican-type revival. If they lose the next one (as, in the light of their present unpopularity, seems probable), something similar may happen. Mr. Major, meanwhile, proposes to fight on the soggy middle ground.
<P><LI>
``Rapid Reaction Force Delayed'' -- headline, British Press Association, July 5.
<P><LI>
Excited crowds gathered around newsstands as the July Fourth holiday approached, all asking the same question: Would the Wall Street Journal editorial page (Robert L. Bartley, proprietor) dare to repeat its call for a constitutional amendment proclaiming ``There Shall Be Open Borders''? This high-water mark of loony libertarianism (apart from anything else, what about disease? welfare eligibility? education costs?) first appeared a few years ago and was repeated several times. It seemed intended as an instant July Fourth tradition. But it was conspicuously absent last year, perhaps because of the obvious imminent rout of immigration enthusiasts in California's Proposition 187 campaign. And the Journal blinked this year too. The disappointed crowds had to be content with an editorial extolling the virtues of skilled immigration. Which, of course, implicitly concedes NR's point that one of the ways in which the current system is fatally flawed is precisely that skilled immigration has been choked off by the misnamed ``family reunification'' provisions of the 1965 Immigration Act. The Journal says a Great Debate on immigration has begun, although the other side is notoriously absent from its pages. Not by Eastern Seaboard windows only, when daylight comes, comes in the light.
<P><LI>
Hugh Grant became the Cary Grant/Fred Astaire of the Nineties by playing charming, diffident men who explicitly included bedding down in their badinage. In real life, he had lived for eight years with a beautiful model, reinforcing his image. Then in real life two vice cops caught him in a car performing a ``lewd act'' with a hooker. Has an illusion left us? That unregulated passion can somehow be confined to charming encounters? The difficulty of so confining it is why Cary and Fred's love interests always maneuvered them toward wedding rings -- not that they would ever have been so crude as to propose doing without them.
<P><LI>
Weighing the messy options, journalistic and ethical, the New York Times began printing the Unabomber's manifesto in 800-word installments, signed ``Frank Rich.''
<P><LI>
Lord Thou Hast Delivered Our Enemies into Our Hands Department: The American Civil Liberties Union recently took out a four-page advertisement in The New Republic. Each page addresses a contentious issue and asserts that the American public agrees with the ACLU that organized school prayer is impolitic, that gays should have special legal recognition, that marijuana use should be legal, and that women should have the right to an abortion. At the bottom of the first three ad pages is the logo ``The American Civil Liberties Union,'' underlined by the phrase ``Live and Let Live,'' picked out in white on a bold black bar. However, on the final page -- the one that defends abortion rights -- the phrase ``Live and Let Live'' is somehow missing. Aborted, you might say.
<P><LI>
Representative Patricia Schroeder (D., Colo.) says the attempt in the House to make partial-birth abortions a felony reminds her of the old days when women were persecuted as ``witches.'' It's easy to see why Representative Schroeder took refuge in similes. The partial-birth abortion -- in which a fetus more than five months old is pulled out of its mother feet first up to its neck and then has its brains suctioned out with a catheter to collapse the skull -- is as grotesque as abortion gets. Perhaps the most striking report on the subject was a New York Times article which quoted an abortionist as saying that some mothers find partial-birth abortions comforting because afterward the body can be ``dressed and held'' to allow a chance to ``say goodbye.'' All the debates about the medical nuances of this relatively unusual surgery (does the fetus die painfully during the suction process, or is it killed beforehand?) fade away beside the image of a nurse dressing the tiny, mutilated corpse in baby's clothing and handing it over to the mother for a ``goodbye'' kiss. This picture should bring instant revulsion to any human being whose brain hasn't been sucked out with a straw.

<P>Greatness in Flushing Meadows
<P>JEFFREY HART 
 
 <HR><B>
<P>1939: The Lost World of the Fair, by David Gelernter (Free Press, 418 pp., $23) 
 </B><HR>
 
<P>Mr. Hart is a senior editor at NR. 
 
 
IF YOU frequent large and miscellaneous antique shows, you learn all sorts of things from old memorabilia. 
Some are surprising, such as that Bill McKinley was the most beloved of all American Presidents. Other 
things are not so surprising, such as that the New York World's Fair of 1939 - 40, at Flushing Meadows, 
was probably the most brilliant fair of all time, including the Great Exhibition in Hyde Park in 1851. I went 
to it almost every day, and I don't need the memorabilia to tell me how important it was.
<P>Which brings me to 
David Gelernter's book, whose subtitle should be noted: <I>The Lost World of the
Fair</I>. His subject is the lost 
world of the later 1930s as much as it is the Fair itself.
<P>
I cannot do more than begin to suggest here the 
richness of his treatment. In the New York City of 1939 that he paints here the subways and streets were not 
only safe but clean. In that city there were only forty murders per year; just think of that. Executions were 
very prompt. Manners at all levels were more formal than ours. In the middle and upper classes, men wore 
suits and ties. Women never wore shorts. There were rituals about when to touch your hat and when to take 
it off, correct modes of introduction, established rules governing interaction between the sexes. Men
<I>always</I> 
remained standing until the last woman was seated. Gelernter calls this an ``ought'' culture to contrast it with 
our ``want'' culture -- not an altogether satisfactory choice of terms, but pretty good.
<P>
He notices that art, 
technology, and their cousin, design, were allied, and shrewdly sees that this was because people wanted to 
get things done and expected to do so. Engineers were heroes. Among his greatest doers were Robert 
Moses, the master builder; Fiorello LaGuardia, the mayor; and Franklin Roosevelt, the President -- all men 
of authority, a key word here.
<P>
Mr. Gelernter believes that, since the time of the Fair, authority has 
evaporated. He is certainly correct in this, but he offers no theory to explain it. Perhaps it has something to 
do with the circumstances we live in. Could LaGuardia himself have kicked off West 96th Street that 
``homeless'' maniac who terrorized the neighborhood for months? Could LaGuardia have cut through the 
years of fuss and actually put pissoirs on New York's streets? Could Robert Moses, of Jones Beach, the 
Triborough Bridge, countless playgrounds, and magnificent public swimming pools, have rescued Times 
Square or even built a new highway on the West Side?
<P>
Mr. Gelernter is good, but also not entirely 
satisfactory, on the Fair itself. His device for taking us there is a fictitious diary by a bright young woman 
who went to the Fair. This does not quite rise to the subject, nor does Mr. Gelernter's own excellent 
research. He should have looked at the Fair more closely, more continuously and intensely. Yet meaning 
after meaning emerges.
<P>
The hero of the Fair was George Washington, whose large though banal statue 
graced the place: the Father of His Country, the very image of authority. Then you had the Trylon and 
Perisphere, by the great firm of Harrison and Fouilhoux. Let us explicate.
<P>
The Trylon was, by Fair 
regulations, the tallest structure there. No other was allowed to be as tall. Of course you can guess what the 
second tallest structure was: the Soviet pavilion with the Worker atop. He held aloft a huge red star that 
gazed angrily at night toward the Trylon and Perisphere, which were gleaming white but sometimes bathed 
in pastel colors.
<P>
The Soviet pavilion was a depressing and heavy hulk of Stalinist imperial architecture. All 
that I can remember from inside were some folk dancers and a replica station from the Moscow Metro, 
chandeliers and all. You can probably imagine my reaction, even at age 9, to the aesthetics here. Good old 
Ivan -- the Worker -- was a stitch. He had a thick neck and thick wrists, infallible signs of proletarian virtue. 
He seemed disconcertingly stupid. Ah, this was what Stalin was putting up against the Trylon and 
Perisphere? At 9, I became an anti-Communist at a glance.
<P>
An adult, meanwhile, would have seen that the 
Trylon and Perisphere were not casually conceived some lazy afternoon down at Harrison and Fouilhoux. 
He would have seen that they were a climax of High Modernism, perhaps its greatest architectural 
achievement. In their geometric character, they represented pure Mind. Henri Matisse had held that all 
spatial forms could be resolved into triangles, spheres, and cubes: the beginning of Cubism. The Eiffel 
Tower had famously insulted the low mansard roofs of Paris. Architects connected with European 
formalism had experimented with huge spires as images of aspiration, and one had even been submitted in a 
design for Coney Island. Wallace Harrison and Andre Fouilhoux (Wally and Andy to their architect friends) 
knew all this and figured out how to bring it to a brilliant result.
<P>
What did the two gigantic monuments 
mean? George Washington, the Father of His Country, had his Egyptian obelisk, a symbol of maleness, in 
Washington, D.C. This had to be retained, but also transformed. The four-sided obelisk became the three-
sided Trylon. (Ezra Pound: ``Make it new.'') Meanwhile, just as the Trylon was a representation of 
masculinity, the globular Perisphere was pregnant with The World of Tomorrow, a giant model inside 
named ``Democracity.'' Between the Soviet pavilion on the one hand, and the Trylon and Perisphere on the 
other, the Fair symbolized the greatest conflict of our age, and suggested its resolution.
<P>
Much of what this 
model, and the rest of the Fair, foresaw came to pass. That poor Soviet Worker, with his thick wrists and 
thick skull, did not stand a chance against the energy and creativity of the West, represented by Harrison 
and Fouilhoux. Neither, ultimately, did the regime that shipped him here in crates. If the poor clod could 
have escaped from his Stalinist perch, I like to think he would have headed for the Parachute Jump, the 
Aquacade, and the Voyage to Mars, picking up a Zombie (a drink that was ``one to a customer'') on the 
way.
<P>
The Fair was consciously designed to represent optimism and brains at home to the cruel new utopias 
so menacing abroad. Maybe that is why we cared about it so much. The good news is that the Fair -- 
brilliance, energy, speed, electronics, intelligence -- won.

The 101st Senator<BR>
Rich Lowry<BR>
<P>

Mr. Lowry is NR's national political reporter.
<P>
WASHINGTON, D.C.
<P>SHEILA Burke stands at a phone in her spacious Capitol office, looking down as she listens to an 
unhappy senator on the other end. The senator went home last night not realizing floor votes are scheduled 
today, and wants to know why he wasn't informed. Mrs. Burke apologizes, then explains that a notice went 
to every office last night outlining today's schedule. When she sits back down for an interview, she's still 
shaking her head. ``Told him there would be votes. He left. Now he's mad there's votes,'' she sighs. ``The 
freshmen are just . . . an interesting crowd.''
<P>
Bob Dole's chief of staff can afford some exasperation over the mistakes of first-year Senators -- not only 
has she been here longer, she's probably more powerful. The shortish 44-year-old mother of three, who 
typically wears a dour expression -- as if one of the kids had just tracked mud on the living-room carpet -- is 
often called the ``101st senator,'' in recognition of the latitude given her in running the day-to-day 
operations of the Senate. Conservatives often call her other, less flattering names, ranging from ``liberal 
Democrat'' to the ``woman who runs Bob Dole.''
<P>``The one consistent theme over every major battle that conservatives lost,'' says a former Senate 
staffer, ``was a knife in the back from Bob Dole, frequently at the behest of Sheila.'' A Traditional Values 
Coalition press release recently proclaimed, ``If the American people like Hillary Clinton, they will love 
Sheila Burke,'' an over-the-top piece of rhetoric that nonetheless captures her place in the pantheon of 
conservative villains. As the Dole campaign continues to roll, neutralizing serious opposition on the Right, 
Mrs. Burke stands as a personification of all the old conservative doubts about the convictions and the 
<I>modus operandi</I> of her boss. 
<P>Sheila Burke, a nurse by training, joined Dole in the mid 1970s. At the time, she was a Democrat with, 
as she told <I>U.S. News & World Report</I> last year, ``a bias on the liberal side.'' Her resume included time 
protesting the conservative reign of S. I. Hayakawa as president of San Francisco State and involvement in 
``Nurses for Moynihan.'' No matter. Dole, she says, ``was looking for somebody to do health policy who 
had experience as a provider.'' When in 1985 he was elected majority leader, Mrs. Burke left the Senate 
Finance Committee, where she handled health care, to become his deputy chief of staff. In 1986 she moved 
into the top slot. 
<P>Mrs. Burke's politics had shifted rightward -- ``a maturation on my part,'' she says -- but retained an 
accommodationist/liberal tinge in keeping with her Senate background. The Finance Committee, which 
spends half the federal budget and raises almost all of it, is in the minds of its members a domain too 
important for partisanship. ``She is the Finance Committee,'' one Senate aide says. ``In the Finance 
Committee, people who come to the table with strongly ideological agendas, whether liberal or 
conservative, are marginalized. I think her temperament and approach to issues comport very well with the 
way the committee does business.''
<P>And with the way the Senate does business. Sheila Burke is part of what one aide calls an ``Old Boys 
Network'' of staff loyal to the traditional non-confrontational ways of the Senate (the staff director of the 
Budget Committee was recently described by <I>National Journal</I> as ``deeply perplexed by what he viewed as 
a right-wing takeover of the House''). For Mrs. Burke, the most important boys in this network have been 
women, including Finance Committee staff director Lindy Paull and, until she left to be Rhode Island's 
Director of Human Services, John Chafee aide Christine Ferguson. It's a vaguely feminist, non-ideological 
environment.
<P>All of which has made Sheila Burke, whose intelligence and competence are not in question, a 
lightening rod for conservative suspicions. Whenever Dole strays, Sheila Burke gets fingered. Supporters 
contend this is unfair. ``Dole is his own person,'' says conservative activist Don Devine. Former Finance 
Committee staff director Bob Lighthizer insists, ``Nobody who succeeds working for Senator Dole elevates 
their own agenda above his. He just doesn't tolerate it.'' But Dole tends to have a hands-off management 
style; ``work it out'' can constitute a marching order. It's within this latitude of broad instructions and the 
detailed staff work surrounding any issue that Mrs. Burke has her influence.
<P>CONSERVATIVE critics point to her role in the health-care reform fight of 1993 - 94 as the prototype. 
She maintains close ties to a nursing community not prone to right-wing views, sometimes teaching courses 
at nursing schools. ``The people she sees socially tend to have a corporatist liberal point of view,'' says one 
observer. That background has made itself felt in a variety of ways, from Sheila Burke's personally twisting 
senators' arms to get them to agree to sell a valuable piece of federal land to the Columbia Hospital for 
Women in Washington, D.C., to her interest in becoming head of the Health Care Financing Administration 
(HCFA) in the Bush Administration.
<P>At first blush an odd career move, the HCFA job might have represented a fulfillment of Sheila Burke's 
ambitions (she couldn't take it because her husband's work with Aetna represented a potential conflict). The 
agency runs Medicare and Medicaid; ``it controls American health care,'' explains one staffer.
A chance to do the same by different means came in the health-care fight. Mrs. Burke's friends fashioned 
the Chafee proposal, a pre-emptive surrender to the Clinton plan that would, among other things, have 
required insurers to offer a set of government-defined benefits. At first called Dole -  Chafee, the legislation 
represented the initial instincts of Dole and the policy convictions of his chief of staff. ``Sheila was very 
comfortable with the Chafee bill,'' says one GOP aide.
<P>AS THE health debate moved right, conservatives worried that Mrs. Burke was pulling the other way. 
She achieved unusual visibility for a staffer. On <I>Meet The Press</I> in the fall of 1993 Senator Pat Moynihan 
proclaimed, ``Sheila Burke . . . said this is an important moment. . . . We agree that government now has to 
intervene.'' Come February 1994 Hillary Clinton was hawking the same line: ``Senator Dole told me, 'If you 
and Sheila can agree, I'll vote for the plan.''' Mrs. Burke seemed to be itching to cut the deal. ``If you didn't 
want to take care of this stuff, these [health-care] issues were of such a technical nature that it was a 
discussion you could easily beg off,'' says a former Democratic staffer. ``[But] she was interested in sitting 
down with the other side and getting into all the details.''
<P>When Dole finally decided to sink any version of government-run health-care -- after getting pounded 
privately by conservative colleagues -- Mrs. Burke did dutifully assemble the operation to do it. ``I've never 
seen in my six years up here anything that approached it for sophistication, level of organization, and 
effectiveness,'' says Doug Badger of the Senate Republican Policy Committee. By the end of the process, it 
was the moderates who were complaining. Says former Chafee aide Christine Ferguson: ``I feel like she 
abandoned the ship.'' The overall trajectory of the health-care fight followed a familiar pattern: first (at the 
point when an issue is most likely to be shaped by his staff) Dole gets on the wrong side, then he rights 
himself (when other, outside influences have been brought to bear).
<P>The latest complaint about Sheila Burke comes on welfare. Conservative staff contend she has worked 
in staff-level meetings to limit welfare reform and keep the bill free of language condemning illegitimacy, 
even an innocuous statement like ``marriage is the foundation of a successful society.'' Mrs. Burke says she 
just tried to broker an issue on which the Republican conference is bitterly divided (so-called ``clean'' block 
grants v. those with some illegitimacy strings). But, as on health care, being a good soldier will mean 
crossing her instincts: the ineffective reforms of 1988, which must be scrapped to make way for any 
meaningful change this year, would not have happened without her.
<P>The welfare controversy is typical, based on impossible-to-discern intentions and a pervasive distrust. 
``It's the sense you get of the meeting before the meeting,'' says one aide, ``that her more liberal friends are 
there when you arrive -- and still there when you leave.'' Stories of her betrayals in the Senate cloakroom are 
as rife as they are difficult to confirm. Eyewitnesses recall seeing her pow-wow in late 1992 with Nancy 
Johnson (Conn.) and Fred Upton (Mich.), as the two House moderates made a last minute push for a fetal-
tissue research bill. A similar allegation -- in writing, in an unsigned memo -- had her helping cloakroom 
staff find the votes to shut down a Jesse Helms filibuster last year. ``An absolute falsehood,'' she says. ``I 
wasn't there.'' 
<P>The strained relations with the Right may have contributed to Mrs. Burke's brief move this year to the 
position of Secretary of the Senate, a powerful institutional job, but one removed from Dole's political shop. 
The Dole campaign, went the speculation, was trying to ease her out. But Mrs. Burke kept her chief-of-staff 
job, and by June had moved back to it full-time. Her 18 years of loyal service no doubt stood her in good 
stead, as on a deeper level did her sympathy with Dole. She represents a part of him, if the ``bad'' part: the 
tough-as-nails demeanor, when the ``New Dole'' is supposed to be kinder and gentler, the pragmatic 
operator, when Dole is supposed to be an avatar of conservative principle.
<P>In recent months, Mrs. Burke has presided over an office churning out a steady diet of conservative 
results, most recently beating cloture on the Henry Foster nomination for Surgeon General. But she is 
clearly acting from the head rather than the heart. Asked whether she understands the nation's new political 
currents, Mrs. Burke says. ``There are a lot of things people accuse me of, but being stupid isn't one of 
them.'' The same can be said of her boss, which at least partly explains his compelling rhetoric of late. But 
after the campaign speeches are a distant echo, Sheila Burke (the next White House chief of staff?) will still 
be around. So will the side of Bob Dole that makes her such a good fit.

<H2>LEGALIZING DRUGS: JUST SAY YES</H2></CENTER>
<P>
Legalizing drugs may be the way to help
addicts, and win the drug war. 
<P>
AN INTERVIEW WITH MICHAEL S. GAZZANIGA
<P>
Dr. Gazzaniga is Director for the Center of Neuroscience at U.C. Davis.
<P>
NATIONAL REVIEW: Professor Gazzaniga, thank you for talking with us again [cf. 
``The Federal
Drugstore,'' <P>NR, Feb. 5, 1990]. We would like to examine the possible consequences 
of legalizing drugs
in America. However, before we take up this controversial issue, perhaps you 
can sketch a quick picture
of drug use today?

<P>DR. MICHAEL S. GAZZANIGA: The current figures suggest that about 10 per cent 
of Americans use
illegal drugs. Of course, the vast majority of these users -- perhaps as many 
as 90 per cent -- are not
addicted to drugs and use them only infrequently. There is also a strong correlation 
between age and drug
use. In surveys, 13 per cent of 18- to 25-year-olds claim to have used drugs 
in the past thirty days, while
a meager 4 per cent of people over age 26 say they have done so. So, while 
a substantial number of people
have experimented with drugs in one way or another, very few become addicted.
<P><BR><B><P>NR</B>: Are there any studies that help to explain why people take drugs -- and 
why they don't?
<BR><B><P>MG</B>: Human psychology is very complex; obviously, many factors go into the decision. 

Not
surprisingly, the dominant factor seems to be simply the short-term pleasure 
of the drug experience. In
other words, drugs make people feel good. This simple fact is what causes people 
to take these
substances, sometimes at great medical and social risk. The long-term consequences 
are just not present
in their minds at the moment of arousal.
<BR><B><P>NR</B>: Nevertheless, the fear of being caught -- and the consequences of being 
caught, like fines,
confiscation, and jail terms -- must deter drug use to a certain extent?
<BR><B><P>MG</B>: Again, human psychology is more complex than a basic analysis of reward 
and punishment. There
is a large project, near completion, at the Rand Corporation, that is producing 
a lot of information and
analysis, including a cross-national analysis of drug policies and outcomes 
and a historical analysis of
pharmaceutical records from the period when cocaine was legal in the United 
States.
Many of these studies challenge the empirical basis for using deterrence as 
a means of controlling drug
use. For example, the Scandinavians imposed a severe penalty for having blood-alcohol 
levels above
.08 per cent, regardless of a driver's behavior or demeanor. There was a transitory 
drop in road fatalities
but then a return to baseline levels. This pattern is seen over and over again 
when severe penalties are
imposed.
In studies that zoom in on individual people's actual beliefs, we also find 
that the severity of penalties
plays little or no role in controlling whether or not people prone to using 
drugs actually use them. This
disregard for the law is truly remarkable since the cumulative risk of getting 
caught over an extended
career of drug use is fairly high.
<BR><B><P>NR</B>: So, you are saying that potential drug users are not all that sensitive 
to the threat of legal sanctions?
<BR><B><P>MG</B>: Yes. Dozens of studies say exactly that.
<BR><B><P>NR</B>: In that case, are there any other forces that control -- and could therefore 
be manipulated by society
to control -- the decision to use drugs.
<BR><B><P>MG</B>: There are several other forces at work here. One is the perceived health 
risk. If people believe that
drugs are physically harmful to them, they are more likely to resist taking 
drugs. Other forces, such as a
person's perception of the morality of the act, and perceptions of the morality 
of the law, also have an
effect, as do stigmatization from being caught, shame, and other dimensions 
of humiliation. There are
also informal social norms. Professor Robert MacCoun of UC Berkeley, whose 
study was part of the
Rand project, makes a strong case for the importance of these factors. However, 
on the other side of the
coin there is the forbidden-fruit effect, a process that may attract people 
to drug use. As I said, human
psychology is extremely complex.
<BR><B><P>NR</B>: You've considered drug use in terms of the individual user. Could you tell 
us a bit more about what
drug use looks like from society's perspective? For example, what does drug 
use ``cost'' society?
<BR><B><P>MG</B>: In terms of direct financial cost -- money spent on drugs that could have 
been spent more
productively -- according to the Office of National Drug Control Policy [ONDCP] 
approximately $41
billion was spent in 1990, down from $54 billion in 1988. However, those numbers 
are probably highballs.
<BR><B><P>NR</B>: Why is that?
<BR><B><P>MG</B>: Drug expenditures aren't tallied accurately like your hotel mini-bar charges. 
There's a lot of very
iffy guesswork. ONDCP tries its best by using two different methods. The ``consumption'' 
method
involves multiplying estimates of the number of drug users by estimates of 
the average amount of drugs
used. As you can imagine, neither can be measured very accurately. So they 
try to verify these estimates
by what they call the ``supply'' method, which estimates the amount of base 
crop raised in producer
countries, reduced by the amounts lost, the amounts seized or consumed in other 
countries, and the
amounts seized in our country. The remaining amount is then assessed for value 
by considering current
street prices. So the supply estimate is only as accurate as the six other 
estimates it is calculated from,
and as ONDCP acknowledges, there are even more uncertainties because much of 
drug value is bartered
for sex or for other drugs.
<BR><B><P>NR</B>: So it's possible that the drug market may not be as large as it is commonly 
represented?
<BR><B><P>MG</B>: Yes. It is likely, in fact. In 1992, Americans spent approximately $44 
billion on alcohol and $37
billion on tobacco. The number of Americans using these drugs is vast compared 
to those using illegal
drugs. Furthermore, alcohol and tobacco are not only available everywhere, 
but are actively promoted.
Taken together, it is hard to imagine that the illegal drug trade produces 
an income nearly equal to that of
alcohol or tobacco.
The overall pattern of data collected by government agencies is also at odds 
with other common
impressions. For example, how much of the drug business is centered on high-school 
and college
students?
<BR><B><P>NR</B>: Well, you're the one with the data. We'll guess at least half?
<BR><B><P>MG</B>: According to ONDCP, only $2 billion of the $41 billion spent in 1990 was 
spent by high-school and
college students. That is less than 5 per cent of the drug market, if their 
figures are correct. So, students
are not the primary drug consumers.
<BR><B><P>NR</B>: Even if we can't pin down an exact number, it is clear that a substantial 
amount of money is wasted
by drug users on purchasing drugs. On the flip side of the coin, how much of 
society's resources are being
utilized in the war on drugs?
<BR><B><P>MG</B>: The cost of the drug war is staggering at every level of government -- 
local, state, federal. For
example, federal grants to state and local drug-enforcement programs are now 
nearly a billion dollars a
year. Federal efforts on international drug control cost more than $800 million 
annually. Federal efforts
on drug interdiction are now at least $2.2 billion a year. The total federal 
drug control budget is in excess
of $12.5 billion a year, according to the 1992 Bureau of Justice Statistics 
Sourcebook. And these
numbers do not take into account the huge amount of money spent by state and 
local governments out of
their own tax sources.
<BR><B><P>NR</B>: What about non-financial costs? Certainly the criminal-justice system must 
be heavily burdened
by the war?
<BR><B><P>MG</B>: No question. In 1989, 1,247,000 people were arrested for drug-related offenses. 
Two-thirds of
those arrests were for possession only, and most of those were for marijuana. 
As for incarceration, in
1990 there were 930,000 inmates across America in federal, state, and local 
prisons. Of these, 50,000
were in federal institutions, and of these, half were in prison for drug offenses. 
Of the 684,000 prisoners
in state prisons, no less than 22 per cent were being held for drug offenses. 
The courts and jails and
prisons are just jammed with drug offenders.
<BR><B><P>NR</B>: We've eased toward the issue of legalization, and now we'll ask you straight 
out. Why not legalize
drugs?
<BR><B><P>MG</B>: Adversaries of drug legalization or decriminalization feel that relaxing 
drug laws will lead to
increased consumption. They submit that the increase in consumption in turn 
will produce an
unacceptable burden on society. This single point, for example, is the basis 
for James Q. Wilson's
anti-legalization position. However, there are several reasons to think this 
concern is misplaced.
Studies on the decriminalization of marijuana suggest that it leads to no significant 
increase in
consumption. Now, these studies have been contested because decriminalization 
occurred at a time
when overall drug use was declining for many other reasons. However, recent 
re-evaluations of
Prohibition data are consistent with the value of drug legalization.
Furthermore, current surveys indicate that among non-users, only 1.7 per cent 
thought that, if drugs
were legal, they would become users. Addicts did say they might use more. But 
controlled users thought
their own use would be unaffected.
These answers make sense, if you think about it. As I mentioned before, the 
legality of drug use is only
one among many factors that a person considers when deciding whether or not 
to use drugs. At least as
important are considerations such as risks to health, costs in terms of lifestyle, 
the morality of the act.
<BR><B><P>NR</B>: But wouldn't lots of people ``try it out'' if it were legalized?
<BR><B><P>MG</B>: It's possible that there would be a minor bulge in drug use immediately 
after legalization -- again,
the forbidden-fruit phenomenon. But think about it. Suppose heroin were legalized 
tomorrow and
available everywhere. Would you suddenly become an addict, or even a user? 
Probably not. Well, why
not? Because you would decide that the pleasure does not outweigh the risks.
As for current addicts, if they did use a little more, that would not necessarily 
increase their inability to
function, or further impair society's efforts to deal with them. Addicts already 
cause harm to themselves
and present a danger to others. But there is a limit to the amount of harm 
they can inflict on themselves
and to the degree of risk they can present to society. Is a bum on the street 
much worse off if he drinks four
bottles of Jack Daniels a day instead of only three? Is society much worse 
off?
<BR><B><P>NR</B>: Then the question, perhaps, is, Would there be more addicts if drugs were 
legalized?
<BR><B><P>MG</B>: If non-users are unlikely to begin using drugs, as we've discussed, new 
addicts would have to come
from the ranks of controlled users. As I said, controlled users believe their 
drug use would be unaffected
by legalization. Is this a credible belief? Absolutely. Because drugs are already 
widely available,
controlled users could use more right now if they wanted to. They choose not 
to use more because they
have determined how much they can take and still function. In other words, 
they regulate their own
behavior. And for that reason, they would be no more likely to become addicts 
post-legalization than
they are right now.
<BR><B><P>NR</B>: This may be a naive question, but are drugs really that widely available?
<BR><B><P>MG</B>: National Institutes of Health studies show that perceived availability 
has remained consistently
high for marijuana since 1975. As it has for cocaine. Furthermore, from 1988 
to 1992 drug availability,
by and large, increased -- despite the war on drugs. There was a 2.5-metric-ton 
increase in marijuana,
with a peak in 1989 - 90. Cocaine, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration 
as of 1993,
``remained readily available in virtually all major U.S. metropolitan areas.'' 
Heroin is available, and its
purity has increased. There are some regional variations in this pattern, but 
overall, drugs are
everywhere.
<BR><B><P>NR</B>: So legalization would not affect availability. However, the street price 
of drugs is artificially
inflated because drugs are contraband. If the price of drugs dropped precipitously 
-- as presumably it
would if they were legalized -- could this lead to increased consumption? Perhaps 
controlled users are
controlled partly by the high price of drugs.
<BR><B><P>MG</B>: Lower prices might mean increased use, but the data on this point are mixed, 
and there is some
indication that drug users are insensitive to price. That is, that they use 
similar amounts regardless of the
price of drugs. And again, consider alcohol. It is widely available and inexpensive, 
but not everyone is a
drunkard. In fact, attitudes have changed markedly as far as drunkenness is 
concerned. In the decades
after Prohibition was repealed, drinking hard liquor was a way of showing how 
sophisticated you were,
how you were more urbane than the rubes in the Women's Christian Temperance 
Union. Think of the
image of cocktail parties, of the Thin Man movies in which much of the humor 
revolved around getting
drunk, of Dean Martin's shtik. Nowadays public drinking of hard liquor to the 
point of slurring and
dizziness is just tacky. Square, corny old Johnny Carson had a running joke 
where he affectionately
teased Ed McMahon for his excessive drinking. Cool, hip Letterman and Leno 
wouldn't be caught dead
doing it. These pushes and pulls to alcohol use have nothing to do with jail 
or availability or price and
everything to do with social mores. There's no reason to think that the psychology 
of drug use is any
simpler.
<BR><B><P>NR</B>: So is the ``bulge'' you mentioned earlier something like the post-Prohibition 
bingeing you just
described?
<BR><B><P>MG</B>: Yes. But there is an important difference. Just after Prohibition was enacted, 
the drinking rate fell
off sharply. However, throughout the Twenties the drinking rate rose, despite 
Prohibition, and it was on
the rise when Prohibition was repealed. By contrast, drug use is down in every 
age group and across all
sectors of society, and it is continuing to fall. Just as an example, in 1973, 
37 per cent of 18- to
25-year-olds said they had used drugs in the previous month. In 1992, only 
13 per cent said they had.
<BR><B><P>NR</B>: That would seem to prove the point of the prohibitionists: it's the war 
on drugs that has caused drug
use to go down.
<BR><B><P>MG</B>: No. The drug war targets three specific factors that affect the drug-use 
rate, namely the availability
of drugs, the perceived risk of arrest or legal sanction, and the perceived 
risk to personal health. As far as
drug availability is concerned, the drug war has been a total failure. Drugs 
are as widely available now as
they ever have been. The risk of arrest has certainly increased -- since 1985 
drug arrests have gone up
from 718,000 to 1,247,000 a year. Remember, though, studies indicate that the 
perceived risk of arrest is
often ignored by drug users. Finally, health-education programs are widely 
promoting the belief that
drugs are bad for bodily and mental health.
So, the war on drugs may be having an effect. But it is important to understand 
that that effect is created
through several approaches. I don't know if the risk of arrest reduces drug 
use more than education does
-- or even if it reduces drug use at all. However -- and this is an important 
point -- if drugs were
legalized, health-education programs would continue to disseminate information. 
And they might then
have the resources that now go wastefully toward trying to decrease availability, 
and toward arresting
people. If we could have the same level of drug use through simple education 
programs, wouldn't we as a
society prefer that to incarcerating millions of our citizens?
<BR><B><P>NR</B>: Isn't there also a financial dimension? Education might be far less expensive 
than our current full
mobilization of the judicial system, would you agree?
<BR><B><P>MG</B>: I have seen only one attempt at estimating the potential costs and savings 
that would accrue to
society from legalization. In a recent book, Prohibition's Second Failure, 
Theodore R. Vallance, former
chief of the Planning Branch at the National Institutes of Mental Health, laid 
out a proposal based on his
experience and research. His main professional effort for many years was to 
come up with estimates and
plans concerning America's drug problem.
Vallance's analysis builds on several sources. First he used the 250-page report 
prepared for the NIH by
Dorothy Rice and her colleagues at the University of California. Dr. Rice compared 
the direct and
indirect costs of alcohol and drug abuse as well as of mental illness. Direct 
costs refer to actual program
expenditures such as those by health professionals, the police, the courts, 
and the prison system. Indirect
costs refer to such things as premature mortalities and morbidities due to 
substance abuse. These reflect
real losses in terms of productivity and participation in normal society. Not 
surprisingly, alcohol costs
society more than illegal drugs: in 1985, $70 billion versus $44 billion. For 
alcohol, most of the cost was
for treatment and estimated damage to personal health. For drugs, most of the 
cost was for law
enforcement and losses sustained by crime victims.
<BR><B><P>NR</B>: Could you break those numbers down a little?
<BR><B><P>MG</B>: Yes. Let me just review the drug-abuse numbers. Again in 1985, the year 
that was analyzed in such
detail, $13.5 billion was spent directly on the criminal-justice system -- 
police, legal adjudication, state
and federal corrections, local corrections, private legal defense, and so on. 
There was another $19 billion
in the indirect-costs category: around $1 billion for victims of crime, $4.4 
billion in loss of productivity
for those incarcerated, and $14 billion in loss of productivity for those in 
crime careers. Throw in around
$10 billion for the costs of treatment, and you have the 1985 estimate of $44 
billion. The figures for
direct costs are surely much higher today. For example, totally new moneys 
in the amount of $6 billion
were added by the Bush Administration for new task forces, prisons, interdiction 
programs, and many,
many other projects. A realistic current figure would be around $100 billion 
a year.
Vallance does not, however, simply summarize the past. He uses the Rice data, 
combines it with 1993
data on extra expenditures for enforcement, and comes up with the startling 
conclusion that legalizing
drugs could save society approximately $37 billion a year! In fact, I am sure 
his estimate is low, given the
documented increase in the direct costs already discussed. (See table.)
<BR><B><P>NR</B>: So the Vallance estimate is about $37 billion, and you say that it is probably 
low. How did he
estimate how much of the saving should be reinvested in treatment? And how 
do you measure other
dimensions of the problem like reduced suffering that might occur under a legalization 
scheme?
<BR><B><P>MG</B>: He was making best guesses based on his experience, which he writes about 
with great verve. For
years he had been pushing alternative plans within the government, only to 
be scolded by his superiors
for attempting to question other government agencies' capacity to deal with 
the drug problem. But he
emphasizes that the details could all vary a bit, but the overall pattern of 
the savings would remain the
same.
It is another matter to find a metric for human suffering. Surely a legalization 
scheme ought to find
people less fearful of criminal activity in their neighborhoods. Parents should 
feel better knowing the
police could concentrate on those criminal forces that would continue to peddle 
drugs to children.
Addicts ought to feel better knowing that society is dealing with their problem 
from a health point of
view, and surely there would have to be more programs to assist those who abuse 
drugs.
<BR><B><P>NR</B>: Thank you for your time, Professor Gazzaniga.

McNamara's Brand 
 <P>
Mr. Ferguson is a senior editor of The Weekly Standard. 
 <P>
 
I'M a little bit worried. As I write this, in early June, it's been a 
full month since I've read a nationally published article trashing 
Robert McNamara. All spring, immediately preceding the publication of 
McNamara's memoirs and then for a luscious period thereafter, you 
couldn't pick up a magazine or a reputable newspaper without exposing 
yourself to a shower of bile, all of it directed at our diminutive and 
bespectacled former secretary of defense. NR and The American 
Spectator pitched in, of course, but so did the New York Times and the 
Boston Globe, and Time and Newsweek, and The New Yorker and The New 
Republic -- even The Nation! For a while there, many of us McNamara-
despisers thought we'd died and gone to heaven (a fate, incidentally, 
that McNamara himself is unlikely to enjoy).
<P>
And then -- silence. What gives? Apparently the scribes have moved on; 
never has the press's short attention span been so criminally obvious. 
I feel like a guy at a college beer bust who senses the buzz just 
starting to kick in and wants to part-ay down, only to discover that 
everybody has gone off to the library to cram for a chem final. But 
for all that, I am an optimist; I am one of those who believe the keg 
is half full rather than half empty. And speaking only for myself, I'm 
ready for another draft.
<P>
My interest in McNamara is intensified because he exemplifies a 
peculiar Washington phenomenon. In Washington people fail up. The city 
is exempt from the laws of professional gravity. No other city is so 
accommodating of failure, so friendly to the people who fail. Large 
awards await the bunglers and bobblers, the has-beens and wannabees-
who-never-could. Our present mayor, to cite an obvious example, 
destroyed the city's finances, smoked crack on TV, went to prison -- 
and then got re-elected. Other failures have shown greater artfulness. 
You can see them cruising K Street in chauffeured Town Cars, cashing 
large checks for their "consulting" businesses, digging into filets at 
the Palm. Here's the Iran - Contra bungler, awarded a popular radio 
show for his work destroying the Reagan Administration. Over there is 
the manager of the 1992 Bush campaign, mulling offers from candidates 
to work his magic again in 1996. And over here is the chief strategist 
for Jimmy Carter during the Iranian hostage crisis -- why, he's the 
secretary of state!
<P>
McNamara is spiritual father to them all. He is the architect of a 
career breathtaking in the scope of its screw-ups, a clockwork 
progression of failure and reward, error and advancement. Imagine a 
friend who comes to visit. The first night he cooks you dinner and 
sets fire to the kitchen. The next morning he accidentally 
electrocutes the cat. He blows his nose in the curtains and never 
flushes the toilet. He borrows your car and drives through the garage 
door, then spreads a rare contagion to your kids. By the third day you 
make the decision: You ask him to move in with you.
<P>
This is the pattern of McNamara's career. At Ford Motors, in the late 
1950s, he designed the sclerotic top-down management system that 
almost sank the American automobile industry; for good measure, he 
oversaw the production of the Edsel. Accordingly, JFK handed him the 
Pentagon. There McNamara got the idea for the Vietnam War -- the Edsel 
of American foreign policy. So awed was the Washington establishment 
that it placed him at the head of the World Bank, in hopes that he 
might do for the international economy what he had done for the 
American military. And he did! Within ten years he had doubled the 
amount of money loaned, and lost, to Third World kleptocracies like 
Brazil and the Central African Empire. He was Midas in reverse. 
Wherever he draped his hand, industries wilted, economies collapsed, 
corpses piled up.
<P>
NO one should have been surprised, then, that when McNamara chose to 
write the story of his life, it should have turned out to be a 
disaster by every literary measure: mendacious, sentimental, shameless 
in its exculpation, oily in its tone, a book so badly written that no 
one would ever really want to buy it. And of course it has been a 
rousing bestseller. 
<P>
How does one explain a life thus charmed? His good looks? They may 
indeed have dazzled back in the days when no one minded goofy wire 
rims and the stink of Brylcreem. His sensitivity? It's true he cried 
often, and still does -- the one time I met him, at a think-tank 
luncheon, he teared up over the Cuban Missile Crisis -- and in the pre 
- Alan Alda Sixties a man's capacity to cry could still disarm unwary 
companions. But none of this is sufficient. Washington's inverted 
culture, where failure propels a man ever upward, bespeaks a kind of 
masochism. Of course, the actual  pain is dispersed to the country at 
large. But for the professional failure Washington remains safe 
harbor. Within weeks of the publication of the book, McNamara had been 
called "evil," a "liar," and a "hypocrite." Out in the heartland, a 
few Vietnam vets even sued him. Here in Washington Katharine Graham 
threw him a book party. Everybody who's anybody was there.

10-July-1995 
 
<P>

<UL>

<LI> 
NR is delighted to announce the appointment of Kate Walsh O'Beirne as 
our Washington editor. Mrs. O'Beirne, who is vice president for 
government relations at the Heritage Foundation, first came to 
Washington as a staff assistant to the sainted junior senator from New 
York, James Buckley. In the Reagan Administration she served as deputy 
assistant secretary at HHS. She takes up her NR post on August 1. 
 <P>
<LI>A member of a state militia told a congressional committee the 
government is conspiring to change the weather. Is this the same 
government that can barely conspire to deliver the mail? 
 <P>
<LI>Welfare reform is getting typical Contract-with-America treatment in 
the Senate, i.e., GOP disarray followed by distressingly weakened 
legislation. Majority Leader Bob Dole and Finance Committee Chairman 
Bob Packwood both hoped to rush through a reform bill, Dole to win 
another feather for his presidential cap, Packwood to avoid a conflict 
with his end-of-June ethics hearings. But little had been done to 
ensure GOP unity, and now Senate Republicans are paying the price. The 
bill Packwood reported out of his committee -- weak on work 
requirements, silent on illegitimacy -- is unacceptable to 
conservatives like Lauch Faircloth (N.C.). And Packwood and Dole staff 
have rebuffed attempts to make the bill any more palatable to the 
Right -- even language merely declaring illegitimacy harmful to 
society was kept out of the bill. Faircloth and Phil Gramm were 
pointedly left off a task force formed to hammer out the welfare 
differences. This could herald a bloody intra-Republican battle -- 
with Phil Gramm carrying the conservative banner against the inside-
Washington maneuverings of, among others, prominent Dole staffers. Is 
the Dole campaign paying attention? 
<P> 
<LI>Beware the conciliatory Newt. At the outset of their New Hampshire 
shmooze-fest President Clinton and Speaker Gingrich shook hands on 
creating a bipartisan commission to recommend campaign finance and 
lobbying reforms. It was great feel-good theatrics, but awful policy. 
In the case of military-base closings, a bipartisan commission was 
just the trick, hammering out the unsavory details of a consensus 
goal. When it comes to campaign finance there's no consensus about 
anything, and the only meaningful role of a commission would be to 
create momentum for ill-conceived proposals, with public financing 
(a/k/a the politician's entitlement) topping the list. In case you 
doubt it: former Common Cause president Fred Wertheimer is gung-ho 
about the commission idea. Gingrich proved in New Hampshire that he 
knows moose when he sees them. If only we could say the same about 
bull. 
 <P>
<LI>Eagle-eyed Republican number-crunchers to the rescue! The President's 
budget is full of rosy assumptions, they say. Ten years down the road, 
it will still be $200 billion in the red when it is supposed to be 
balanced. You could almost hear the sigh of relief from the Democratic 
side of the aisle. 
<P> 
<LI>The House Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee recently heard 
five Federal Communications Commission officials explain why their 
bailiwick needed more funding at a time when other federal agencies 
are contemplating deep cuts. Why? The telecommunications legislation 
working its way through Congress creates so many new functions for the 
FCC that there's no way it can cope, given its current resources. The 
legislation crafted by the Senate Commerce Committee under Larry 
Pressler (S.D.) started out fairly deregulatory but got steadily less 
so under the pressure of fat-cat lobbyists and bipartisanship. By the 
time it hit the Senate floor, Bob Packwood (Ore.) and John McCain 
(Ariz.) -- the conscience of the Senate on telecom deregulation -- 
felt compelled to vote against it. The bill proposed in the House 
isn't much better. Subcommittee Chairman Jack Fields (Tex.) has been 
telling high-tech free-marketeers not to worry, reforms not made in 
the telecom bill can be taken care of in the course of re-authorizing 
the FCC. But the FCC bill Fields has just unveiled -- co-sponsored 
with liberal Democrat Ed Markey (Mass.) -- leaves FCC funding at 
current levels. Unless Newt Gingrich intervenes, the 104th Congress 
will blow an opportunity to unfetter a cutting-edge American industry 
by abolishing the FCC, privatizing the spectrum, and moving away from 
"universal service" requirements for phone service. What would the 
Tofflers say?n Gingrich will make his pitch to kids when he appears on 
an upcoming segment of MTV's Raw. Gingrich follows in the footsteps of 
Bill Clinton, whose performance on the rock 'n' roll network was a 
story second only to Michael Jackson's wedding. So, Mr. Speaker, 
boxers or briefs? 
<P> 
<LI>Ramon Cortines, the chancellor of the New York City School System, has 
resigned, and the liberal intelligentsia is in mourning. Felix Rohatyn 
called it "the saddest day in the twenty years I've been working with 
the city." But what were Cortines's achievements? Unlike his 
predecessor, Joseph Fernandez, he made some tentative but real cuts in 
an education bureaucracy larger than that of France. He reformed the 
practice of "social promotions" -- promoting sub-literate kids so they 
don't feel so bad about themselves. He gave parents the chance to take 
their children out of the program that would give them free condoms. 
But did Cortines gain from the powerful teachers' unions the right to 
dismiss incompetent teachers? Did he clean up the corrupt local school 
boards? Did he bring any discipline into a school system in which one 
teacher a day is hospitalized because of a student attack? Did he do 
anything to reduce the system's cost per pupil -- which remains 
several times that of demonstrably superior parochial schools in the 
city and of public schools in every other nation. Cortines is a decent 
man. The fact that his legacy was so meager shows how badly the 
schools need radical change. The first step toward that is to 
introduce real competition -- and not just in New York City. 
<P> 
<LI>In an annual rite of summer, New York City's "gay pride" parade will 
once again pass by St. Patrick's Cathedral, where militant homosexual 
activists will vent their hatred of the Catholic Church and its 
teaching of chastity for unmarried persons. Last year, while Rudy 
Giuliani turned a blind eye, gay exhibitionists pranced naked down the 
street and engaged in public masturbation. They chorused obscenities 
at the Cathedral, which while not illegal, as William Donohue of the 
Catholic League points out, would never be blessed by New York 
officials if it were done by Nazis in front of Temple Emanu-El, or 
Klansmen in Harlem. Mr. Giuliani has escaped political fallout so far, 
partly because Church officials have not put up much of a fight. Mr. 
Donohue, however, is another story. He has threatened to rouse the 43 
per cent of city residents who are Catholic, many of whom helped give 
the mayor his narrow victory over David Dinkins. If Mr. Giuliani 
wishes to show tolerance for gays, he should find a better way than 
tolerating bigotry against Catholics. 
<P> 
<LI>Will "even poor kids in distant areas," President Clinton asked Newt 
Gingrich, be able to cruise the Infobahn? Or "will the information 
superhighway simply give access on the Internet to [people] who tell 
you how to make bombs?" We hope not; we'd hate to see Ira Magaziner 
on-line. 
<P> 
<LI>The dramatic annihilation of Canada's pro-immigration Progressive 
Conservative Party in 1992, and its replacement in the national 
parliament by the new, immigration-questioning Reform Party, was a 
clear warning to U.S. political leaders. Now the general election in 
Ontario, Canada's largest province, on June 8 sends a warning about 
another elite-imposed policy: affirmative action, i.e., quotas. Before 
the three-week election campaign, the provincial Progressive 
Conservative leader, Mike Harris, had wisely positioned his party 
several hundred miles to the right of its late unlamented federal 
counterpart on tax and spending issues. But he still had only about a 
quarter of the vote, according to public-opinion polls. The provincial 
Liberals, with 52 per cent, appeared poised for a landslide win over 
the governing party, the socialist New Democrats. (Reform did not 
participate.) Then the New Democrats' quota policies exploded as an 
issue. Harris attacked them; the New Democrats denied they existed; 
the Liberals allowed as how they were against quotas but in favor of 
affirmative action blah blah blah. Result: Mike Harris is the new 
Progressive Conservative premier of Ontario. Typically, the Republican 
leadership in Washington was simultaneously passing the word that 
abolishing affirmative action will not, after all, be among its 
legislative priorities. 
<P> 
<LI>When Boris Yeltsin arrived in Halifax a reporter asked what it's like 
to come to a G-7 summit hoping to get a little attention. Yeltsin said 
he didn't know, but would ask Bill Clinton when he saw him. 
 
<P> 
<LI>Disney's new animated film Politicallycorrectahontas premiered in an 
extravaganza in New York's Central Park. The damage inflicted on the 
park's flora and fauna by the crowd of 70,000 certainly vindicates the 
film's message that Western Civilization has been harmful to the 
ecology of the New World. But the worst pollution was intellectual: 
Pocahontas is portrayed as a cross between Buffy Sainte-Marie, Joan of 
Arc, and Petra Kelly; the English settlers of colonial Virginia are 
brutal aristocrat/capitalist land-stealing predators. Powhatan, 
Pocahontas's father, is shown as the saintly leader of a people in 
true spiritual harmony with Nature; in reality he was a sort of Attila 
the Algonquin who conquered twenty rival tribes and annihilated some 
of them. All the facts of Pocahontas's story are so skewed that even 
her Native American descendants have complained that the film despoils 
their cultural heritage. Now we know what we were spared when Disney's 
project for an "American History Theme Park" in Virginia was 
torpedoed. 
<P> 
<LI>While hailing the encyclical Evangelium Vitae (The Gospel of Life), NR 
expressed concern on two points. The press had quoted Joseph Cardinal 
Ratzinger as saying that the encyclical's teaching on capital 
punishment represented a "development of doctrine," and that the new 
Catechism, issued only last year, would have to be revised to reflect 
the new teaching. Since then Fr. Richard John Neuhaus of First Things 
has asked the cardinal for a clarification, and has received this 
reassuring word. "Clearly, the Holy Father has not altered the 
doctrinal principles which pertain to this issue [the death penalty] 
as they are presented in the Catechism, but has simply deepened the 
application of such principles in the context of present-day 
historical circumstances. Thus, where other means for the self-defense 
of society are possible and adequate, the death penalty may be 
permitted to disappear. Such a development, occurring within society 
and leading to the forgoing of this type of punishment, is something 
good and ought to be hoped for." And there is no question of recalling 
the Catechism. The cardinal meant only that the official Latin text, 
which is being prepared after the publication of the vernacular 
versions, will refer to what Evangelium Vitae says about capital 
punishment. So Catholics relying on the Church's official teaching as 
expressed in the Catechism may in good faith disagree over whether, in 
today's circumstances, the self-defense of society requires the death 
penalty. Cardinal Ratzinger's clarification should be welcomed by all 
those who are concerned with the constancy of the Church's teaching. 
We expect it will not be welcomed by people who, ignoring what the 
encyclical says about abortion and euthanasia, triumphantly proclaimed 
that Evangelium Vitae condemns capital punishment. 
<P>  
<LI>"I am very much in favor of every American learning a second 
language," says Newt Gingrich. He adds, however, that every immigrant 
to America already has his second language and now needs to learn his 
first. After thirty years of multiculturalist foolishness, the 
government finally seems poised to make English the nation's only 
official tongue. Representative Peter King (R., N.Y.) has proposed a 
bill that would require election ballots and other federal documents 
to be in English, and would end bilingual education. To 
multiculturalism we do not bid adieu, hasta luego, sayonara, but good-
bye, farewell, so long forever. 
<P>  
<LI>The New Yorker now has a dress code. Staffers who deal with the public 
are told to wear Armani and Chanel suits. Tweedy stuff and Brooks 
Brothers are out. When the ukase came down, the staffers were told 
that "Tina" wants The New Yorker to be "a liberal, media-savvy kind of 
place." Oh. Get that oaf Thurber out of here. When New Yorker writers 
dressed like rubes and academics, they set the standard for national 
urbanity. Now they will dress up, and set the standard for mid-
Atlantic hype. 
<P>  
<LI>Recent visitors to the White House were offended by what they saw as 
"extreme and insulting" measures taken by Secret Service personnel 
against a minuscule safety risk. President Clinton has apologized for 
the Secret Service, and said the problem will be dealt with. As we go 
to press, however, the barricades on Pennsylvania Avenue have not been 
removed. 
<P>  
<LI>A study has determined that smoking reduces the risk of Parkinson's 
disease. Nyah, nyah.

<H3>Lost Right?</H3>
 
IN Lost Rights James Bovard chronicled typical depredations of federal 
agencies. Each page represents an American who has faced a rigid, 
often unforgiving government, at a price in wealth or energy or 
freedom, or all three. Such encounters serve as a recruiting ground 
for the panoply of new-wave anti-government groups, from property-
rights activists to the county movement in the West to a growing 
National Rifle Association. It's no coincidence that as government has 
gotten bigger -- trying to do more for you by doing more to someone 
else -- so has the range and variety of its resisters.Along with the 
burgeoning government has come an expanded police power. Law 
enforcement no longer just means a cop walking the beat. It can mean 
someone from the Environmental Protection Agency checking to make sure 
you haven't built a new deck on supposed wetlands. It can mean someone 
from the Drug Enforcement Administration confiscating your house 
because a marijuana plant was found growing on the back forty. It can 
mean, as Charles Krauthammer recounted, an FBI agent asking you 
whether a former employee up for an Administration appointment ever 
cracked an ethnic joke. It can mean -- as we all know -- the Bureau of 
Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms barging into your house to investigate 
some suspected firearms irregularity. Hence, the increasingly uneasy 
relation between conservatives and law enforcement; it's difficult to 
support vigorous enforcement of laws that shouldn't be on the books in 
the first place. But there's a profound risk in seeming anti-law-
enforcement in an American polity that rightly cherishes law and 
order. The risk is all the greater in the wake of Oklahoma City, which 
has shone the spotlight on a right-wing fringe -- the militias -- that 
seems willing to reject the most basic governmental authority. How 
should conservatives respond? First, by sticking to their principles. 
Central government has always posed the gravest threat to liberty, and 
as Angelo Codevilla points out (page 35), liberals bent on tarring the 
entire case for limited government with Oklahoma City are engaged in a 
sinister enterprise. If their logic is taken seriously, they are 
arguing for the criminalization of a philosophical position, while at 
the same time seeking to increase the power of the central government 
to move against it. Even in small doses, this medicine promises only 
unhappy effects.The best way to ensure respect for law enforcement, 
conservatives should insist, is to ensure it for laws. And that won't 
happen until there are fewer of them. As government has grown, 
people's respect for it has dwindled. In fact, it has become an object 
of fear. But all of this fades in the public mind when it sees law-
enforcement agents confronting an armed band that has gunned down 
their colleagues. Whether the case involves David Koresh or Rodney 
King, officers who daily put their lives at risk should get the 
benefit of the doubt, regardless of the operational folly of their 
political bosses.For conservatives this means taking care about where 
to draw the line both in criticizing government and in making allies. 
Freshman Republican Steve Stockman clearly crossed it with his 
incendiary remarks about Waco and Janet Reno in Guns & Ammo. So did G. 
Gordon Liddy when he encouraged his listeners to expect federal agents 
to come busting down their doors. The NRA deserves the flak it has 
gotten for calling ATF agents jack-booted thugs. Finally, most 
militiamen might be weekend soldiers playing with guns, but others are 
paranoiacs who scramble their gun-toting friends at the first sighting 
of a U.S. military vehicle. These lapses on the Right should be 
criticized from the Right. So it was almost refreshing to hear 
Republican Peter King of New York (lifetime ACU rating: 87) say of the 
militias: "They're wackos, they're nuts, they're dangerous, and we 
should have nothing to do with them."The pull of these two imperatives 
-- to limit government but not to stand in the way of legitimate law 
enforcement -- is being felt in Congress now over the anti-terrorism 
bill. The measure has passed the Senate and will soon be considered in 
the House. In a strange-bedfellow alliance, some conservatives are 
joining the ACLU in worrying about the civil-liberty implications of 
the bill. On the strict merits, as Eugene Methvin points out (p. 32), 
these concerns are excessive. One measure that has gotten particular 
attention is the so-called roving wire-tap, which would peg a wire-tap 
to a person no matter what phones he uses. But there is no reason to 
believe this authority would diminish Fourth Amendment protections; it 
is the individual who has the privacy right, after all, not the 
telephones. Also raising concerns are provisions allowing the military 
to assist in domestic cases involving biological or chemical weapons. 
But the military involvement would be strictly limited to technical 
assistance and analogous to the limited role it now plays in the drug 
war. This sounds merely prudent in a world of technological 
terrorists, foreign and domestic. Indeed, former Attorney General 
William Barr -- hardly a liberal -- calls the legislation "balanced 
and reasonable."Still, given the expansive abuses that have occurred 
with well-meaning legislation like the RICO statutes -- originally 
meant to rein in mobsters, now brought to bear against targets as far-
flung as abortion protestors -- conservative suspicion is reasonable. 
Indeed, the current IRS audit of the NRA looks suspiciously similar. 
Hence, it's difficult to cede any more power to a Federal Government 
one can't be sure will act within its given bounds. The short answer 
is to give law-enforcement agencies the powers they need to protect 
society while keeping a careful watch on them and investigating abuses 
like Waco as soon as they come to light. If this sounds ambiguous, 
well, conservatives are doomed to ambiguity on these issues until 
government is returned to its proper place, and law enforcement again 
means foiling criminals rather than harassing citizens. 
 

 
<H3<Courting Trouble</H3>
 
SUPREME Court decisions in two affirmative-action cases mirrored the 
opinions of politicians of both parties. Judges and lawmakers know 
that something has spoiled in the refrigerator, but they can't bring 
themselves to clean it up.Adarand Constructors v. Pena was a case 
involving minority set-asides in federal transportation projects. One 
way or another, the Federal Government steers $14.4 billion a year -- 
8.3 per cent of federal procurement -- to DBEs, or disadvantaged 
business enterprises: firms owned by minorities or women. In Missouri 
v. Jenkins, the Court reviewed the public-school system of Kansas 
City, Mo., which might be called systemic affirmative action. For 
nearly a decade a federal district judge has commanded the state to 
spend $200 million a year on the schools of the inner city, to make 
them equal to the schools of the suburbs.In each case, four Justices -
- Stevens, Ginsburg, Breyer, and David He-Did-It-Again -- voted to 
maintain the status quo. Justices Scalia and Thomas wrote concurring 
majority opinions, calling for a clean slate. "There can be no such 
thing as either a creditor or debtor race," wrote Justice Scalia of 
Adarand Constructors. "As far as the Constitution is concerned," wrote 
Justice Thomas, "it is irrelevant whether a government's racial 
classifications are drawn by those who wish to oppress a race or by 
those who have a sincere desire to help those thought to be 
disadvantaged." On Missouri v. Jenkins, Thomas was even more scathing. 
Affirmative action in education means that "blacks, when left on their 
own, cannot achieve. To my way of thinking, that conclusion is the 
result of a jurisprudence based upon a theory of black 
inferiority."But the majority of the majority -- Chief Justice 
Rehnquist and Justices O'Connor and Kennedy -- would only urge the 
race-levelers to be more cautious. Racial "qualifications," wrote 
Justice O'Connor in Adarand Constructors, "are constitutional only if 
they are narrowly tailored measures that further compelling 
governmental interests." Chief Justice Rehnquist, in Missouri v. 
Jenkins, ruled that the rogue district judge was not applying "the 
appropriate test," to evaluate the success of his edicts, but 
Rehnquist's decision did not order his educational fiefdom to be 
dismantled. In other words, the majority held that reverse 
discrimination is a bad thing, unless it is done very carefully. It 
was the equivalent of installing yellow lights on a street that has 
been taken over by drag-racers.The judges were echoed by the pols. 
President Clinton has been trying to find a way of seeming to give the 
issue a second thought, without actually thinking about it. Newt 
Gingrich, meanwhile, signaled to Republican reformers, such as 
Representative Charles T. Canady (R., Fla.), that he was inclined to 
"hold hearings, but not necessarily to move quickly."Which means that 
the decision will be taken by the voters. California will have a 
referendum on affirmative action in 1996; other states will follow. It 
is only a matter of time before the congressional elections will in 
effect become referenda, to be decided by an increasingly fed-up 
majority. If the GOP doesn't enact the majority's sense of justice -- 
which is also the Constitution's -- the electorate will find other 
agents of its will. 
 

 
<H3>Republican Budgets</H3>
 
IN ADVANCING his new plan to balance the budget over the next ten 
years, President Clinton rejects the lessons of Liberal Budget Math 
101: the budget can be balanced only with a combination of tax 
increases and spending cuts, preferably in defense, and never in 
entitlements.Clinton's embrace of a zero deficit, tax cuts, and 
entitlement reforms marks a seismic shift in the political debate over 
federal budget policy. In November, the President was arguing that in 
electing a Republican Congress, voters were expressing frustration 
with the pace of liberal change. Now, though his new budget plan is 
largely phony, the rhetorical capitulation it represents acknowledges 
Republican success in setting the agenda -- perhaps for a generation. 
But it is also smart re-election politics for Bill Clinton. Abandoning 
Hill Democrats reflects the political reality of a plurality President 
seeking majority support in '96. Most surviving Hill Democrats enjoy 
what Bill Clinton lacks -- a safe liberal seat. As 1996 approaches, 
Clinton's political fortunes will improve in direct proportion to the 
distance he puts between himself and a hopelessly liberal Democratic 
caucus. He will position himself as fighting off the mean-spirited 
excesses of the Republican majority while rising above the special-
interest politics of liberal Democrats. This balancing act will be 
popular in the Senate, where there is no shortage of Republicans eager 
to stymie Newt. Come next year, Clinton will, in the time-honored 
manner, run for re-election against Washington, arguing that the 
public needs to be protected against the extremes of both parties on 
Capitol Hill. Before that happens, Republicans can advance their 
agenda by a judicious compromise -- on the question of who keeps score 
over the next few years. Under the President's budget estimates, 
Republicans could keep the full tax-cut package as passed by the House 
without sacrificing their goal of a zero deficit by 2002. In his ten-
year plan, the President uses the Office of Management and Budget's 
estimates of future growth. These are more optimistic than those of 
Congress's scorekeeper, the Congressional Budget Office, which leave 
the President with a $200-billion recurring deficit in 2005. Since the 
CBO is unwilling to recognize the growth effect of tax cuts, 
Republicans should adopt OMB's projections, thereby making tax cuts 
affordable -- even for Senator Domenici. 
 

 
<H3>Last Rites for the IRS</H3>
 
THERE is a revolution going on in Washington after all. Anyone who 
doubts this missed the three days of hearings before the House Ways 
and Means Committee on replacing the income tax. Chairman Bill Archer 
of Texas forcefully restated his commitment to "pull up the income tax 
by its very roots." The Left is apoplectic.One of Mr. Archer's star 
witnesses was William Dakin, tax counsel for Mobil Corporation. Mr. 
Dakin brought along a 76-pound, 4-foot high stack of papers -- Mobil's 
tax returns for 1993. Dakin told the stunned congressional panel: "It 
takes Mobil 57 man years at a cost of $10 million to prepare these 
income-tax returns." In a perverse way, our income-tax system has 
become one of Washington's most successful jobs programs. Historian 
Charles Adams, author of For Good and Evil: The Impact of Taxes on the 
Course of Civilization, told Congress of the events that led Britain 
to abolish an income tax in the early nineteenth century. According to 
Adams: "When the British legislature voted to defeat the income tax, 
there was the loudest exultation ever witnessed within the halls of 
Parliament. A motion then followed to have all the records of the tax 
destroyed." The tax records were burned by the citizenry in a giant 
bonfire. (Unfortunately, the Chancellor of the Exchequer "kept 
duplicate copies of the tax records in the basement of the Exchequer 
Court.")The debate in Washington is now not so much over whether to 
replace the income tax, as how. Republicans are falling into two 
camps: flat-tax proponents want to eliminate all deductions, abolish 
the capital-gains tax, scrap withholding, and put in place a flat tax 
of 17 to 20 per cent with a postcard form that could be completed in, 
say, 15 minutes. That's the moderate position. Mr. Archer wants to 
bulldoze the corporate, personal, and estate taxes entirely and move 
to a national sales tax. Of the thirty or so witnesses before his 
hearings, only one defended the current tax system -- the Clinton 
Administration witness, Les Samuels of the Treasury Department. Archer 
asked Samuels repeatedly: "Will the Administration come forward with a 
tax-reform plan, and if so, when?" Mr. Samuels's roundabout answer 
amounted to this: No, the White House likes the tax system just the 
way it is. Even the Democrats winced.Don't look for the Spirit of '76 
in the woods, it's in the House. 
 

 
<H3>The Bear at the Table</H3>
 
BORIS Yeltsin's appearance at Halifax was little more than a temper 
tantrum over Chechnya. It coincided with a bungled "rescue" by the 
supposedly elite Russian Alpha Group commando force at a hospital in 
southern Russia where Chechen guerrillas were holding two thousand 
hostages. After two days of the abortive "rescue mission," Yeltsin 
opted for negotiations with the Chechens over the hostages, as his G-7 
interlocutors had urged.The West has no direct strategic interest in 
Chechen independence. Our stake is indirect: Russia's performance in 
Chechnya is an indicator of its general disposition as a presumably 
reforming ex-imperialist power. What we have seen is a Russia that is 
once again flexing its muscles geopolitically (at least within the 
confines of the old USSR), flirting with authoritarianism, quick to 
resort to force, and not fastidious about methods. This has obvious 
implications for Russia's future behavior outside its old borders. The 
fact that the Russians were incompetent in Chechnya is somewhat 
reassuring. But no great power tolerates humiliation indefinitely. 
Already the Russian military is claiming -- and getting -- a larger 
share of the national budget. Five years from now, Russia's military 
posture may be no laughing matter.The good news is that Russia's 
desire to become a full member of the G-7 is now less likely than ever 
to be fulfilled. The G-7 is, after all, the special fraternity of the 
industrial democracies. Chechnya has dispelled most remaining 
illusions about the nature of the bear. The otherwise boring Halifax 
meeting may have been a useful field trip. 
 

 
<H3>The G-7 Bails Out</H3>
 
WHILE squabbling over Bosnia and trade policy, the world's richest 
nations managed to agree on one idea -- a global economic bailout 
fund. The fund, managed by the International Monetary Fund, would 
provide instant cash to countries facing Mexican-style currency 
meltdowns. Such aid would not be free of strings: countries that 
deliberately strayed from "acceptable" economic policies in order to 
receive funds would not be eligible. To its credit, the G-7 admits the 
moral hazards involved in offering an open-ended entitlement.Sharing 
this burden with other industrial nations is at least better than the 
sort of unilateral rescue effort rammed through by President Clinton 
for Mexico. The Halifax proposal requires that nations disclose a 
great deal of financial information they now keep secret or release 
much later. But, as NR's Ed Rubenstein points out, the economics of 
the scheme are still questionable. Consider the numbers. Currency 
trading has grown by more than 50 per cent over the past four years, 
to an estimated $1 trillion per day. At the same time, the total funds 
stockpiled by all central banks in the world to stabilize their 
currencies amount to just $1 trillion, or one day's worth of trading 
volume. So even if all of it were made available for emergency 
borrowing, the task would be quite impossible. In fact, the G-7 is 
willing to risk only a "mere" $50 billion for the new credit facility. 
The idea is to prevent a replay of the Mexican crisis. There is a 
widespread perception that the bailout orchestrated by President 
Clinton and the IMF is working well. It isn't. The peso collapse wiped 
out more than 40 per cent of Mexico's economic wealth. In 1994 
Mexico's GDP totaled about $350 billion; today it has shrunk to $240 
billion. Although interest rates range from 60 per cent to more than 
100 per cent, Mexican inflation will exceed 30 per cent this year. The 
peso remains worthless, and U.S. taxpayers will likely shell out far 
more than the $20 billion already pledged.Although stable currencies 
benefit developing economies, international aid is not the way to 
achieve them. The key lies in sound domestic monetary policy. Mexico 
erred in printing too many pesos during 1994, an election year. The 
central bank should have soaked up the excess pesos by selling off 
assets such as government bonds. The Federal Reserve does this every 
day. So do other central banks; there's no rocket science involved.The 
problem is that central bankers are often under the thumb of 
politicians. There's a way out, however. Simply convert the central 
bank into a currency board such as those that now exist in Hong Kong 
and Argentina. Under a currency board, all currency growth has to be 
exactly matched by an expansion in foreign-exchange reserves, 
guaranteeing that the currency is fully convertible. Argentina endured 
inflation of 2,300 per cent in 1990, the year before it established 
its currency board. Today Argentina's inflation rate is under 4 per 
cent.Currency boards lack the glamor and excitement of bailouts. But 
make no mistake about it, bailouts are never what they seem to be. 
Messrs. Clinton and Rubin claimed to have the Mexican people on their 
minds, but the real winners were the American banks, mutual funds, and 
pension funds that held the debt and securities the bailout saved. The 
American taxpayer came in a distant last. That's where he'll come in 
under a global bailout fund. 

 
 
<H3>Lost in the Woods</H3>
 
THE nation had something to cheer about when Air Force Captain Scott 
O'Grady, whose F-16 was shot out of the sky over Bosnia on June 2, was 
rescued six days later by a daring helicopter raid by U.S. Marines. 
The heroism of all concerned was genuine. Less admirable was President 
Clinton's blatant exploitation of Captain O'Grady's rescue to salvage 
public support for the bankrupt policy that had put the captain in 
harm's way in the first place.The cause of the shootdown was not just 
an intelligence failure or a failure to communicate timely 
intelligence to the pilot. It was a political failure, at the highest 
level.It has been known since November that the Bosnian Serbs had 
acquired anti-aircraft missiles like the high-speed mobile SA-6 that 
hit O'Grady. The missile threat, indeed, had caused NATO to cancel air 
drops of humanitarian relief supplies late last year. Since that time, 
the U.S. Air Force has been arguing to the Joint Chiefs of Staff that 
NATO ought to eliminate the missiles as a threat to its "peacekeeping" 
operations. In northern Iraq, for example, U.S. air patrols like 
O'Grady's are accompanied by a robust capability for suppressing 
hostile air defenses by electronic jamming and radar-destroying 
counter-missiles. In Bosnia, however, at UN insistence, the Air 
Force's requests were repeatedly denied by higher authority, for 
political reasons, as an unacceptable "escalation." Until now, that 
is. The rules of engagement have been changed in the wake of the 
O'Grady drama.The captain won cheers with his tale of resourcefulness 
and his forthright declaration of religious faith. Given all the self-
defeating restraints that remain in the Western powers' Bosnia policy, 
nothing short of divine intervention will avert future losses of 
American or British or French lives. Captain O'Grady, once lost in the 
woods, has been rescued. The same cannot be said of his Commander-in-
Chief. 
 

 
<H3>John Finley, RIP</H3>
 
JOHN H. Finley Jr., a relic and type of Harvard's ancestors past, died 
last week. Scholar, classicist, and Master of Eliot House from 1941 to 
1968, Finley brought Harvard's house system to its pinnacle by 
investing Herculean effort into selecting each freshman who applied to 
live there. Master Finley defined the principles of a Harvard 
education in his 1946 "General Education in a Free Society." He 
expected the best from his students, and so they delivered it (a 
lesson in an age where grade inflation and personal-esteem enhancement 
predominate). A generation of men were molded by Finley and the 
college that he loved. Atque in perpetuum, frater, ave atque vale.

(RINGING)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE VOICE: Good morning, American Broadcasting 
Company.
VPOTUS: Robert Iger, please.
UFM: Certainly. 
(CLICKS. UNIDENTIFIED MUSICAL SELECTION.)
UFM #2: Robert Iger's office.
VPOTUS: Is Mr. Iger in?
UFM #2: Whom shall I say is calling?
VPOTUS: Al Gore.
UFM #2: And you're with . . . ?
VPOTUS: Um . . . the executive branch.
UFM #2: Of . . . ?
VPOTUS: The federal government.
UFM #2: Please hold the line.
(CLICKS. UNIDENTIFIED MUSICAL SELECTION.)
(ELAPSED TIME: 11 MINUTES, 23 SECONDS)
UFM #2: Go ahead, Mr. Iger.
ROBERT IGER, CEO -- ABC TELEVISION NETWORK: Newt?
VPOTUS: No, it's Al Gore.
RI: Al Gore? Al Gore? Oh! THAT Al Gore! Well, Mr. Vice President, this 
is indeed an honor. Hey, if you're calling about the nudity and 
violence on NYPD Blue you're too late -- Bob Dole already called! Ha 
ha! I'm kidding, of course. We here at the American Broadcasting 
Company -- and by extension our corporate parents at Capital Cities -- 
hold the nation's airwaves as a kind of a sacred trust. There's 
nothing more dear to use than the VHF band, as a viewing of, say, 
Family Matters or America's Goofiest Cops will attest to. And how may 
I help you, sir? 
VPOTUS: Well, I'm calling at the behest of the president. We're 
requesting thirty minutes of network airtime to present our budget 
plan.
RI: How many minutes?
VPOTUS: Thirty.
RI: Ouch. Mr. Veep, you're killing me! Thirty minutes which day?
VPOTUS: Tuesday.
RI: Tuesday? As in Roseanne? As in 33 share? 
VPOTUS: Wednesday, then?
RI: Oooh. Double ouch. Ellen. Grace Under Fire. 37 share. C'mon. Work 
with me, here. You know what I'm thinking? I'm thinking Thursday.
VPOTUS: Well, we tried that. NBC refused. 
RI: They did? Where's their sense of civic duty?
VPOTUS: Apparently, Seinfeld and Friends are pretty popular.
RI: I know, but by God! We're all Americans, after all. Hmmmm. I'm 
thinking here. I'm thinking here. 
VPOTUS: You know, in the past, it's been traditional for the networks 
to grant time to the president as a matter of course, without 
hesitation.
RI: Yeah, and with all due respect: A), in the past, the networks 
haven't had any competition; and 2) let's be totally honest, you're 
asking for thirty minutes now, but I remember a time when you folks 
down there told me to my face that the State of the Union wouldn't go 
past forty-five minutes, and I'm watching the thing go to an hour, 
then an hour and a half, eating up all of prime time on the east 
coast, taking a big chunk out of the west, and you guys are saying to 
me ``he's wrapping up, he's wrapping up,'' but hell, I KNOW when a 
guy's wrapping up and he wasn't even close -- and that's dollars down 
the drain, and don't quote me on this, but you didn't get the health 
care thing anyway, did you? 
VPOTUS: I hate to bring up the FCC here, but -- 
RI: Can I offer you a piece of advice? In my business, when a show 
isn't going as well as it should, or it's getting overlooked, or it 
needs re-tooling, we put it on something called ``hiatus.'' You guys 
should look into that option.
VPOTUS: You want us to put the executive branch of the federal 
government of the Unites States of America on ``hiatus?''
RI: Um . . . .yeah. Why? Is that bad?
VPOTUS: You know, CBS gave us the time with no argument.
RI: Of course they did! They're in fourth place! Their ratings are in 
the toilet! You offered them thirty minutes of free programming. What 
are they going to say? No? C'mon! They've got Murder, She Wrote, which 
skews way, way, way old, one of those really bad Linda Bloodworth-
Thomason shows -- hey, no offense -- and you! If I were them I'd offer 
you guys a whole series!
VPOTUS: This is unbelievable.
RI: Hey, if your guy just skewed a little younger. Not boomer, really, 
but younger. Somewhere between boomer and Gen-X. I can sell time for 
thirty minutes of that. 
VPOTUS: Sell time?
RI: Yeah, you know. Commercials? Pay the rent?
VPOTUS: The President of the United States doesn't ``break for a 
commercial.''
RI: Yeah yeah yeah. When he needs votes, he'll play the sax and talk 
about his underwear on MTV, but then suddenly it's all ``Mr. 
President'' this and ``Dignity of the Office'' that. I got news for 
you: you can't unscramble an egg, you know?
VPOTUS: Look, CBS and CNN and NBC said that they would give us the 
time. 
RI: Okay, okay. You twisted my arm. You win, okay! You win! We'll give 
you the time.
VPOTUS: Commercial free?
RI: You're killing me, here! Killing me! But, okay, commercial free.
VPOTUS: Thanks, Mr. Iger. Bill and I really appreciate it.
RI: Now there's something that you can do for me.
VPOTUS: What's that?
RI: You wanted thirty minutes, right?
VPOTUS: Right?
RI: Can you get it down to five? I've got a Circus of the Daytime 
Drama Stars special I just can't move.
VPOTUS: I'll see what I can do.

<H2><I>ON THE SCENE</I></H2>
<H3>Saving Gramm's Campaign</H3>

RICHARD BROOKHISER<P>

<I>Mr. Brookhiser is an NR senior editor.</I><P>
<BR>
NEW YORK<P>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE ="+2>P</FONT>HIL Gramm's film career bloomed and faded in Texas, 
and its dried petals were exhibited by The New
Republic in Washington, D.C., but the story found its home in Gotham. A PORN-AGAIN 
PREZ
HOPEFUL, shouted the Daily News. PORNO-GRAMM, squawked the Post. All that was 
missing was
TOPLESS BODIES FILMED BY BRAINLESS GRAMM.
<P>
The hinterlands made less of the tale. ``Not many people down here are interested 
in what The New
Republic has to say about Phil Gramm,'' said Bill Murchison of the Dallas Morning 
News.
Representative J. D. Hayworth (R., Ariz.), a strong Gramm supporter in the 
class of '94, compared the
impact of the flap in his district to a ``whoopee cushion -- it made a lot 
of noise, but the wind went out of
it quickly.'' In a few days, even the national-media pinball machine was flipping 
other news-bits.
<P>
The Gramm story shows yet again that while dirt is fun, presidential elections 
are serious affairs. The
weaknesses of the Gramm campaign are structural and intellectual. There is 
a limit to what he can do to
remedy them, but he can do quite a lot.
<P>
Phil Gramm came into 1995 trailing clouds of glory from last year's health- 
care wars. He raised more
money in one night in Dallas than most candidates see in a lifetime. He wins 
straw polls with dull
regularity. But the mountainous effort has so far produced mousey results in 
the polls. In a Zogby - New
York Post poll in late April, Gramm trailed Bob Dole by 47 points, and Pat 
Buchanan by 7.
<P>
Gramm's slow start is the result of difficulties with three Republican grouplets. 
The smallest, and
peskiest, is the guardians of New Hampshire's divine right to the first primary. 
Gramm encouraged
efforts by Arizona and Louisiana to jump to the head of the queue, and he attended 
a May convention in
Delaware despite stern warnings from New Hampshire Republicans that it was 
anathema. So, although
Gramm can show a New Hampshire senator in his corner (Bob Smith), the Manchester 
Union Leader has
sniped at him, and Stephen Merrill, the conservative governor, sits on the 
fence.
<P>
Gramm's night at the movies came in the midst of a push to shore up his standing 
with social
conservatives and the religious Right. Abortion was a symbol of his difficulties. 
Gramm has a pro-life
voting record, but he was reluctant to stress the issue in his campaign. ``Short 
of a moral reawakening in
the land, we are not going to have anything like unanimity'' on the issue, 
he had told the Washington
Times in 1993. ``I'm pro-life. I can't reach another conclusion in my heart,'' 
he told Human Events early
this March, but added that under Reagan the GOP ``attracted people who had 
many different views on
issues like abortion.'' When Gary Bauer of the Family Research Council complained 
that the ``in my
heart'' talk reminded him of the evasions of Mario Cuomo, Gramm met with him 
and James Dobson of
Focus on the Family. The meeting was frosty. ``At first there was a little 
filibuster'' from Gramm, Bauer
recalls. ``Then things went downhill.'' ``I'm not a preacher,'' Gramm told 
Dobson. ``That's your job.''
<P>
Early in May, Gramm went to Jerry Falwell's Liberty University to give the 
commencement address and
mend fences. He said that America was in the midst of an economic and a moral 
crisis, both having
``their roots in the explosion of a government'' that ``squanders the fruits 
of our labor'' and ``corrupt[s]
our values.'' The blue-movie episode that followed soon after was what they 
call ``off message,'' but
Bauer believes that it caused as little a stir as it did among social conservatives 
because Gramm had
already been out there, trying to address them.
<P>
Gramm's third problem is with a tendency rather than an organized lobby: the 
supply-side faith left over
from the Eighties. ``If we want to let people keep more of what they earn, 
we've got to not spend it,''
Gramm says. With a Republican Congress, that is now a possibility for the first 
time in decades. Would a
Republican President keep hammering the anti-tax, pro-growth message? Fear 
that neither Gramm nor
any of his current opponents would briefly encouraged supply-side publisher 
Malcolm Forbes Jr. to flirt
with running himself -- the most quixotic venture in a year that has produced 
Arlen Specter and Alan
Keyes. Forbes stayed on the sidelines, but supply-side doubts about the GOP 
field, including Gramm,
linger.
<P>
Gramm's strength is also his problem: he has a philosophy. ``He has been rock-solidly 
consistent,'' says
Jim Miller, former Reagan budget director, who went to college with Gramm at 
the University of
Georgia and taught economics with him at Texas A&M. ``When he first got into 
politics and started
calling up chambers of commerce, he gave a speech he called his 'government 
is the enemy' speech.''
He's been giving it ever since he arrived in Washington as a congressman in 
1979. You disarm the enemy
by cutting programs and cutting funding. Along the way, Gramm has made his 
share of compromises for
Texas pork -- the mohair program, the supercollider -- and in Bush-era debacles 
such as the 1990
budget deal and the 1991 Civil Rights Act. But this is where his music comes 
from. He is not going to
change it because some Beltway operatives ask him to. He is not going to change 
it because someone
shows him a better way. No one will, because Gramm's way is right. Gramm's 
knobbly personal
qualities -- abrasiveness, lecturing would-be advisors -- are not ``merely'' 
personal. They grow out of
his convictions and the pride with which, as a self-made academic, he holds 
them.
<P>
Social conservatives are looking for a soulmate. ``Something's wrong with the 
core of the country,'' says
Bauer, ``and it's not just the size of government. The size of government didn't 
make Mrs. Smith put her
kids in the lake. There is a coarseness, a depravity, a decay.'' Bauer's people 
want a leader who connects
with ``what they see in the headlines.'' Gramm won't be that leader. But he 
can show that he and they
have the same enemy in the explosion of government. Professor Gramm may think 
the connection is
obvious, but nothing is too obvious to be said one thousand times, especially 
in a presidential campaign.
<P>
Some staffers attuned to these things might help. Gramm has been dealing with 
the Bauers and the
Dobsons himself in part because he doesn't seem to have anyone around him who 
knows them.
(Compare Bob Dole, whose deputy political director is Judy Haynes, former deputy 
executive director
of the Christian Coalition.) New staff would offset some of the staff Gramm 
already has. Linda Dival, his
pro-choice pollster, will be reading the numbers through a socially liberal 
prism. She will also rub the
religious Right the wrong way every time she shows up on the box to spin for 
her man. Gramm needs
help fending off Buchanan. The Gramm campaign would prefer to ignore him, focusing 
on a battle of the
titans with Dole. But Gramm has temporarily lost titan status: his enemy of 
the moment is the man who
edged him in the Zogby poll. The shots are there to be taken -- on the Gulf 
War, on trade -- but Gramm
must understand that he needs to take them. In the meantime, the Liberty speech 
was a step in the right
direction.
<P>
Opposing Dr. Henry Foster for surgeon general will be another, if Gramm criticizes 
Foster on
philosophical grounds, namely that Foster is a bad nominee because of his record 
as a sex educator and a
supporter and provider of abortions, not because he told fibs about that record.
The supply-siders will have to grin and bear it. Phil Gramm is not Ronald Reagan. 
Gramm will not
promise morning in America. He wants high noon in Washington.

<H2>THE MISANTHROPE'S CORNER</H2>

<H3>Honey, I Shrunk the Attention Span</H3>
<P>

St. Martin's has just published The Florence King Reader, an anthology.
<P>

<FONT SIZE = "+2">T</FONT>HE American attention span always has gotten a lot 
of attention. The
first to note our easy distractibility was Alexis de Tocqueville. His findings 
were echoed by Frederick
Jackson Turner, but being an American, Turner used the more tactful and romantic 
``restlessness.''
Other commentators were people with a stake in concentration, such as teachers, 
inventors, bridge
players, and Jobean old salts who made boats-in-bottles. These earlier critics, 
who tended to use words
like ``stick-to-itiveness,'' held that Americans could not concentrate because 
we could not sit still. This
opinion prevailed until the television age, when a new kind of critic announced 
that sitting still was
destroying our ability to concentrate.
<P>
Sociologists of the Fifties warned that TV viewers were falling into the habit 
of thinking in clumps of ten
or fifteen minutes, until a commercial came on and temporarily shut down the 
cognitive process.
Actually this was the Golden Age of the American attention span. Early TV had 
some meaty shows such
as Hallmark Hall of Fame and Playhouse 90 that were presented live within the 
traditional boundaries of
the drama, so the resultant thought-clumping was not very different from what 
playwrights had been
doing for thousands of years.
<P>
The logic-friendly format of the theatrical act went out of style around the 
same time that more artistry
went into commercials. Our attention span consequently shrank to about five 
minutes, according to the
sociologists. It went on like this, with a new official attention span announced 
every few years, until it
was down to thirty seconds. It stayed at that for a while, long enough to begin 
acquiring the cachet that
attaches to permanence, but then the soundbite came along and turned thirty 
seconds into an eon.
<P>
No one has announced our new attention span yet, but there are hints. Bill 
Clinton promised to ``focus
like a laser beam'' on the economy. A current bumper sticker, ``Practice Random, 
Senseless Acts of
Kindness,'' effectively says that if you help more than one old lady across 
the street, instead of leaving
the second one standing there while you rush off to hug the squeegee man, you 
are in a rut. Computers are
getting faster and faster, with each new speed advertised as ``blazing,'' and 
Internet messages of ``snail
f---!'' greet those who still use a 386.
<P>
Movies are becoming increasingly incoherent as scriptwriters strive for new 
ways to keep the restless
interested. Gone is the orderly approach that Old Hollywood called ``backstory'' 
-- filling us in on the
action up to the point where the movie begins. It's a technique as old as storytelling. 
Hamlet: the king has
died; Rebecca: the first wife has died; The Odyssey: the hero is setting off 
for home after a long absence.
This is all we need to know to follow the plot, but we need to know it right 
away.
<P>
Apparently feeling that logical narration is for snail fanciers, today's movie 
makers eschew both
backstory and the traditional flashback in favor of the staccato technique 
known as ``cutting in and out.''
<P>
The movie opens with a scene of bankers in conference. We barely know who everyone 
is, when
suddenly the dreary discussion of loans is interrupted by a split-second shot 
of a naked smooth leg
draped over a naked hairy leg. This means that an affair was had, but we have 
as yet no idea who had it.
Back to the bankers for a few minutes, then another split-second shot of a 
knife on a kitchen counter.
When the bankers adjourn for lunch we see the entwined legs again. This time 
the hairy leg fades out and
immediately fades in again, covered now in prison orange. The orange-leg shot 
is mixed with a shot of a
boys' baseball team in orange socks; back and forth, faster and faster, man's 
leg, boy's leg, bad orange,
good orange, while the soundtrack emits whirring, clicking noises to suggest 
someone snapping still
photos as fast as humanly possible.
<P>
Never mind the popcorn, the best accompaniment for today's movies is a surge 
protector. Other
cinematic devices designed to nail our elusive attention are the split-screen 
telephone conversation and
the zoom shot that pulls a human dot on the horizon into an extreme close-up 
so fast that our stomachs
turn over. But of all the techniques for concentrating the mind, the most ironic 
is the freeze frame. A
character who stops dead in his tracks and assumes a basilisk stare is probably 
supposed to remind the
audience to focus like a laser beam, but in fact it resembles nothing so much 
as that menopausal dilemma
of standing motionless in the middle of a room, trying to remember what it 
was you came in to get.
<P>
<FONT SIZE = "+2">M</FONT>UCH of our flagging attention is a natural reaction 
against the unnecessary tedium we create for
ourselves. As the country that enshrined the clarion call of ``quick 'n' easy'' 
and still believes ads
promising mastery of a foreign language in only ``ten minutes a day,'' wouldn't 
it make sense for us to be
on the parliamentary system? We could have got rid of Bill Clinton long ago, 
but no, we wait out the
whole grinding, nerdy, petulant four years, and then wonder why we can't keep 
our minds on anything.
<P>
Our distractibility is also the inevitable residue of our undisciplined feelings. 
The American proclivity
for leaving our emotional lights on has drained the battery of our attention 
span dry. The human spirit can
take only so much of 24-hour coverage, memorial services, ribbons, teddy bears, 
crisis counseling, and
moments of silence. We pay such obsessive attention to disasters and tragedies 
that we end up seeking
respite in forgetfulness. (Quick, name one Teheran hostage.)
<P>
Welcome to America the Flea Circus. We now have a new disease, Attention Deficit 
Disorder, and like
all democratic diseases, it does not discriminate. The good news is that by 
the time we run the gauntlet of
ADD resources, clinics, programs, workshops, seminars, CBS Specials, and Sally 
Struthers promos, no
one will remember what it is. J

<H2>THE WEEK</H2>
<P>

President Clinton is reported to be contemplating a notion to develop an initiative 
to consider the
possibility of formulating an intention to assemble a framework which could, 
under certain
circumstances, be used to develop the foundation for a possible plan to devise 
a tentative policy on
Bosnia.
<P>

You don't have to be a weatherman to tell which way the wind is blowing -- 
you just need to look at Pete
Wilson. The California governor's executive order ending racial preferences 
not mandated by state or
federal law is reassuring: if Pete Wilson is out in front on affirmative action, 
there's no place safer to be.
Representative Charles Canady (R., Fla.) will soon join him there when he introduces 
his ``Civil Rights
Act of 1995,'' a measure (inspired by the California Civil Rights Initiative) 
that would wipe out
preferences at the federal level. Bob Dole will likely be close behind with 
his own version in the Senate.
It bears repeating that, in taking on affirmative action, jittery Republicans 
only have to cut through a thin
layer of media and establishment flak before meeting the broad sense of fairness 
of the American
people. Fortune, in this case, is forgiving; she doesn't favor the brave so 
much as those, like Wilson, with
elementary political smarts.
<P>

After watching House Republicans march with the precision of an honor guard 
through the first hundred
days, new-generation senators have rebelled at the stumbling on their side 
of the Capitol -- Mark
Hatfield's dissent on the Balanced Budget Amendment being the foremost example. 
So Connie Mack
(Fla.) has proposed a serious overhaul of the Senate Republican Conference. 
After each election Senate
Republicans would get together to set a policy agenda for the next Congress, 
a mini Contract with
America. Then, before electing their committee chairmen, senators could find 
out if a would-be
chairman disagreed with any of the items of this common-denominator, got-to-have-it 
agenda. If so,
would-bes might become also-rans. Moderates are screaming that this reform 
assails the ``diversity'' of
the party. But Mark Hatfield and his Old Guard soulmates would provide the 
same ``diversity'' as
ranking majority members of their committees that they now do as chairmen. 
They just wouldn't give as
much aid and comfort to the Democrats.
<P>

Telecommunications is the most thoroughly regulated industry in America, and 
it just might stay that
way. The telecommunications bill crafted by Senate Commerce Committee Chairman 
Larry Pressler
(R., S.D.) contains some ninety new rule-making functions for the Federal Communications
Commission, retains elements of the disastrous Cable Act of 1992, and raises 
the specter of new
telecommunications entitlements by possibly extending ``universal service'' 
requirements (which now
apply to phone service) to new technologies. Pressler has apparently been rolled 
by Senator Ernest
Hollings (D., S.C.), who has pulled the Senate bill ever closer to the two-hundred-page 
regulatory
monster he proposed last year. The House telecom bill is better, but it still 
suffers from timidity and the
close relationship of Representative Jack Fields (R., Tex.), chairman of the 
relevant subcommittee, to
liberal Democrat Edward Markey (Mass.). Bolder stuff comes by way of a new 
report from the Progress
and Freedom Foundation which calls for abolishing the FCC, slicing away huge 
swaths of regulation,
and privatizing the electromagnetic spectrum. It's time the Third Wave met 
the free market -- and
Republican committee chairmen met both.
<P>

Everywhere he goes, he says, people ask Colin Powell what he believes. We can 
tell you exactly what he
believes: that, ``You're not going to hear it today.''
<P>

Aliens who are convicted of felonies after coming to America are ``deportable'' 
under the Immigration
and Nationality Act. They are rarely deported, however, because they are able 
to seek endless judicial
review of the order of deportation. According to a 1995 Senate Report on Criminal 
Aliens in the United
States, a conservative estimate of the total number of deportable aliens in 
the country is 450,000. The
Immigration and Naturalization Service cannot house this many, so most of them 
are released onto the
streets, with instructions to report several months later for an INS hearing. 
Needless to say, most of them
miss their hearings. They do not vanish for good, however. A recent study by 
the General Accounting
Office found that 77 per cent of non-citizens convicted of felonies are arrested 
at least one more time. In
Los Angeles County alone, more than half of incarcerated illegal aliens are 
re-arrested within one year
of their release. Under provisions of the Senate Republican anti-terrorism 
bill sponsored by Spencer
Abraham (Mich.), aliens would still have all the due-process protections afforded 
American citizens on
the underlying offense. There would still be a hearing before an immigration 
judge, which could still be
appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals. All the Abraham provisions remove 
is the much-abused
process of judicial review of the order of deportation. But this is too much 
for Senator Edward Kennedy,
who has offered amendments to keep the status quo. If he succeeds, alien felons 
will continue to be
deported at the current pace -- about 4 per cent a year. Assuming no alien 
is ever convicted of another
felony, it would take 23 years to deport the current backlog. The first step 
to controlling our borders is
controlling Senator Kennedy.

<head><title>LETTER FROM AL -- NR</title></head><body>
<H2><I>LETTER FROM AL</I></H2>June 5, 1995
<P>Dear Rusty:
<P>

It's been pretty crazy around the Gore household these days -- the kids are 
out of school, Newt Gingrich
is dismantling the Clean Water Act, the rain gutters need to be cleaned out 
. . . it's a busy time.
<P>
Sarah and Kristin are actively seeking summer jobs. You were kind to offer 
to have them spend the
summer with you down on the Orinoco, classifying carrier ants, but after a 
long discussion, Tipper and I
decided that it would be best if they both spent the summer closer to home. 

<P>
The problem is that Little Al wants a summer job too -- he's bored mowing the 
lawn and selling
lemonade to his Secret Service detail -- but he's too young for most jobs. 
The girls couldn't be less
helpful. At every turn, they've accused Little Al of being part of the ``oppressive 
male patriarchy'' that
has kept women out of all of the ``really cool summer jobs.''
<P>
I'm starting to wonder about the National Cathedral School, Rusty. At dinner 
tonight, when I told the
girls that they couldn't spend the summer with you in Brazil, Kristin responded 
by going limp in protest
(splashing sorrel soup on Tipper's grandmother's tablecloth) and Sarah began 
scribbling furious notes in
her diary (which she has entitled: ``Sarah: A Slave Narrative''). Tipper reprimanded 
Kristin, who replied
that hand-rolled linen symbolizes an oppressive society that ``infantilizes 
women.'' And when Little Al
told Sarah that it's rude to write at the table, she shouted ``You will not 
censor me!'' and dashed out of the
room. 
<P>
I cleared the plates, made a pot of chamomile tea, and settled down to write 
you a letter. I had barely
finished writing ``Dear Rusty'' when the phone rang. An emergency National 
Security meeting at the
White House. Subject: Bosnia. 
<P>
When I arrived, the Situation Room was crowded: Bill, Tony Lake, ``Chris'' 
Christopher, Strobe Talbott,
and General Shalikashvili were missing, but Paul Begala, Ron Brown, Ron Brown's 
personal attorney
(who, it turns out, is Johnnie Cochran -- small world, no?), Stan Greenberg 
(the President's pollster),
and a lot of interns were there.
<P>
``It's grim, isn't it?'' I said.
<P>
``I'll say,'' Stan answered. ``The carnage, the loss of life, the breakdown 
of civilized norms, and worse
-- the inaction from the government. We keep saying we're going to do something, 
but we never do.''
<P>
Paul piped up. ``Let's do something,'' he said. ``Let's take off the gloves 
and get into the fight!''
<P>
``I agree,'' said Ron Brown. Cochran pulled him close and whispered in his 
ear for a moment or two.
Then Ron cleared his throat and spoke again. ``I refuse to either 'agree' or 
'disagree' or comment further
on these proceedings until the Special Prosecutor issues his report in full, 
at which time I will respond
and in detailed terms.''
<P>
``We have to do something,'' Stan said. ``The situation is starting to look 
like Bosnia.''
<P>
``Wait a minute,'' I said. ``Aren't we talking about Bosnia?''
<P>
``No. We're talking about the Republican budget,'' Begala said.
<P>
``And its 57% approval rate,'' Stan added.
<P>
``The Bosnia thing is down the hall.''
<P>
I ducked out of the room and headed down the hall. The minute I saw Strobe 
Talbott talking to Wolf
Blitzer, Michael Kramer, R. W. Apple, Brit Hume, Lesley Stahl, Joe Klein, Morton 
Kondracke, Sidney
Blumenthal, and Leon Wieseltier, I knew I was in the right place. I made my 
way through the throng of
people. ``I predicted this, you know,'' was all I heard Strobe say before I 
entered the room. 
<P>
``Hi, Al,'' Bill said.
<P>
``Sorry I'm late,'' I said as I took my seat.
<P>
``That's okay,'' Bill shrugged. ``We just decided to commit ground troops.'
<P>'
``We did?'' Leon Panetta asked.
<P>
``We did?'' General Shalikashvili asked.
<P>
``Didn't we?'' asked Bill.
<P>
``If I may, Mr. President,'' began ``Chris'' Christopher, ``I'd like to clarify 
and perhaps summarize the
sense of today's meeting by clasping my hands like so -- '' Chris folded his 
hands into a little steeple ``
-- and by looking very concerned indeed.''
<P>
As usual, we were all impressed by Chris's ability to get to the heart of the 
matter. The ground-troops
option was tabled for the moment, and in its place, finger-steepling and concerned-looking. 
I think
we've finally licked this thing!
<P>
At that moment, Strobe Talbott poked his head into the room and asked us politely 
if we'd mind moving
-- apparently, he had the room booked for a meeting with his biographers. So 
we hustled out.
This is all Top Secret -- I know I can trust you to be discreet. Plus, by the 
time you read this, I have a
feeling we'll have a new Bosnia policy. Or two.
<P>

<b>It Takes a Village To Have an Abortion</b><br>
It crops up all the time in discussions of abortion, this notion that the choice is best left to "a woman, her doctor, her conscience, and her God." That last was Colin Powell's formulation, but other variants are common. In Garry Wills's New York Post column today, for instance, he writes that most Americans "want the decision to be made by the women involved, with the help, ideally, of family and doctors and religious pastors." It never seems to occur to people who talk this way-and who are always accusing pro-lifers of being unrealistic-that this description is otherworldly. People don't generally go to their family doctors for abortions; they go to abortionists with whom they have no prior relationship and who have a direct financial interest in the abortion taking place. (By the way, if consultation is such a great idea, why do "pro-choicers" oppose waiting periods and counseling and informed-consent laws, no matter how mild?)
<P>
For a measure of Wills's intellectual integrity in this matter, consider that he refers to "late-term abortions in emergency cases-the procedure shrewdly but misleadingly labeled 'partial-birth abortion' by its opponents." He's also prone to making highly suspect empirical claims with no evidentiary support. "Even those who disapprove of abortion in general do not consider it murder," he writes. "And those who oppose late-term abortions do not consider them infanticide." How does Wills know this? (Polls actually suggest the reverse of his first claim: more people consider abortion murder than want to prohibit it.) He also writes that 'more people of genuine belief and piety do not consider abortion, no matter how wrong, to be murder." Perhaps Wills is using a circular definition of 'people genuine belief and piety" to mean those people who agree with him on the wisdom of liberal abortion laws. But on any plausible reading of the phrase, the claim is almost certainly untrue.
<P>
<b>As the Book World Turns</b><br>
In yesterday's <I>Washington Post</I> Book World, Charles Murray's new book was reviewed by a liberal (historian Michael Kazin), and former Planned Parenthood head Faye Wattleton's new autobiography was reviewed. . . that's right, by a liberal (whose name we won't mention because the review was so embarrassingly admiring, and besides we forget it).

<b>Truer Words Were Never Spoken</b><br> 


The Washington Post today editorializes against tax cuts. Clinton's "would give an indiscriminate and costly children's credit to the middle class; we can think of better uses of the money." We'll bet they can.
<P>
Come to think of it, we can think of better ways for the Post to spend its money too.

<b>They're Back!</b><br> 
The Harvard freshman orientation seminar is back alive and kicking. In 1994 the Heritage Foundation had succeeded in killing it off with its own alternative orientation for freshmen Republicans. Encouraged by the new House leadership, enough freshmen opted for Heritage over Harvard that Ivy League school canceled its event altogether. At the time, it was good riddance. Going to Harvard right after becoming a congressman was always exactly the wrong way to get started, enduring huge doses of goo-goo liberal good government and stern lectures about working together and bi-partisanship right off the bat. But now, in another sign of the return to "normalcy" in Washington and American politics, Harvard is back. The good news is that most Republican freshmen are still staying away: 35 Democrats and six Republicans attended the Harvard event. They heard from such luminaries as former Dole chief of staff Sheila Burke (now the executive dean of the Kennedy School), outgoing Clinton flack and media darling George Stephanopoulos, and former Bush policy advisor Roger Porter who best captured the spirit of the hapless Bush Administration and would allegedly judge applicants for White House policy jobs on the basis of their tennis games. Anyone who learns about Washington from this crew may never recover. The six Republicans who attended, according to a Harvard list, were: Merrill Cook (Utah), James Gibbons (Nevada), Asa Hutchinson (Ark.), Charles Pickering (Mississippi), Joe Pitts (Pennsylvania) and John Sununu (N.H. ). Count it as one strike against them.

<b>Media Bias Revisited</B><br>
A while back we discussed William Powers's maiden effort as <I>The New Republic</I>'s media critic. We complained that liberals who acknowledge the existence of anti-conservative media bias feel that they must simultaneously slam conservatives for having a crude , conspiratorial view of that bias. In fact, we observed, most conservative press critics understand the sociological reasons for media bias and accept that it is generally not deliberate or orchestrated. One of our readers kindly passed along an article  from <I>NR</I>'s special issue on the press (June 21, 1993)  that nicely makes the point. Ted J. Smith III wrote: "In short, by any reasonable standard, the case for widespread bias in reporting has been made. This does not imply, as some members of the press seem to imagine, that journalists have been found guilty of consciously slanting the news to make it conform with their ideological perspectives. While this may occur on occasion, what is more commonand more insidiousis the sort of bias that reflects the  unconscious assumptions of the writer. This emerges in such things as the kind of adjectives he employs, the kind of 'experts' he quotes, the kind of organizations he considers authoritative, and the kind of issues he thinks important." . . . And while we 're on the subject: Brent Bozell's Media Research Center Awards for the worst quotes of 1996 will be out by the end of the week. Our own Kate O'Beirne was one of the judges.

<b>Musical RNC Chairs</b><br>
The race for RNC chairman is getting more crowded. Texas GOP chairman Tom Pauken has announced his candidacy, which is being promoted by the conservative weekly <I>Human Events</I>. Pauken is smart, principled, and in Texas he has successfully knit together the  social and economic wings of the conservative movement. Announcing his candidacy, Pauken said: "Under my leadership the RNC will be a member-driven organization with an increased emphasis on rebuilding the grassroots Reagan coalition of economic and social  conservatives. By reactivating the Reagan coalition as well as forming other coalitions with those who believe in economic liberty, limited government, and the traditional American values that made our country great, the Republican Party will be able to  retain and increase its control of Congress in 1998 and make a unified effort to reclaim the presidency." Also entering the race is ex-RNC co-chair Jeanie Austin, who flirted with the interesting idea of running on a joint ticket with Rep. J. C. Watts, but  Watts declined. Austin will appeal to those convinced the party needs more high-profile women to combat its "gender gap" problem. Austin says that's not why she's running, but noted: "I have devoted a good part of my career in the Republican Party, recruiting women into the party, and getting women elected to office. I think our party needs to pay closer attention to what women are saying, and we need to listen to their ideas and concerns." The Christian Coalition has flagged Pauken, ex-New Hampshire Gov. Steve  Merrill, and California GOP chairman John Herrington as its preferred candidates. At this point the race is wide open, but the RNC insiders who will be doing the voting at the winter meeting on Jan. 17 are likely to favor one of their own, a fellow insider. This certainly spells trouble for Pauken and Merrill.

<b>Cohen-Head</b>
The cabinet pick Republicans should be happiest about (at least from a cynical political perspective) is probably Bill Cohen at Secretary of Defensealthough not for the reasons the Clinton Administration thinks. The bi-partisan bounce Clinton will get from this pick will last about two weeks; as soon as Cohen is confirmed the honeymoon ends. Then Clinton gets to deal with side of Cohen Republicans are so familiar withthat is his unreliable, disloyal side. The <I>Washington Post</I>'s Al Kamen recently provided a run-down of his record: Cohen broke with other Republicans during Watergate to vote to send articles of impeachment against Nixon to the House floor; during the Reagan Administration he constantly undercut the Administration's position on Nicaragua; he was skeptical of the Gulf War and at one point told Bush: "We visited the Kuwaitis, we saw the Kuwaitis, and we realized that Kuwaitis are willing to fightuntil every U.S. soldier has dropped." Cohen reportedly got the job on the strength of his interview with the President. But he has no management experience and beginning today all his cachet with Republicans is shot; Clinton is about to learn the limits of a pleasant conversationalist as Secretary of Defense.

<b>Fourth-Floor, Hardcore</b><br>
Hard-core House conservatives have made a concerted effort to get office space together on the fourth floor of the Cannon House office building, the better to coordinate their strategy in the next session of Congress. Get a load of this: on one corridor of the fourth floor of the Cannon building the line-up is John Hostettler (Ind.), John Shadegg (Ariz.), Tom Coburn (Okla.), Todd Tiahrt (Kan.), Steve Largent (Okla.), Gil Gutknecht (Minn.), Zach Wamp (Tenn.), Walter Jones (N.C.), Mark Souder (Ind.), Steve Stockman (Tex.), Mark Neumann (Wisc.), Jon Christensen (Neb.), John Ensign (Nev.), and, right around the corner, Ed Bryant (Tenn.). Whew! Texas Democrat Lloyd Doggett was briefly angling for space on Cannon's fourth floor, but when he realized who surrounded him he gave it up. Look for New Jersey Democrat Frank Pallone, plopped down in the middle of this right-wing real estate, to begin to look for new accommodations soon too (or maybe he'll convert). The House leadership, not eager to face pressure from the Right, can't like the idea of having all these guys together. Says one House aide: "They're going to post sentries, I think, on either end of the hallway."
<P>
<b>Tidbits and Outrages</b><br>
<I>The Washington Monthly</I> has a soporific reputation. It's concentrated for the last several years on nuts-and-bolts policy analysis - more nuts than bolts, if you ask us. Now the magazine has embarrassed itself by giving its monthly journalism award to Donald Barlett and James Steele for their interminable <I>Philadelphia Inquirer</I> series "America: Who Stole the Dream?" which has now, inevitably, been released as a book. It's been hooted by columnists right and center for its ludicrous and often self-contradictory arguments, its primitive "analysis," and its ignorance of basic economicsthemes that, alas, run through Barlett and Steele's work. <I>The Washington Monthly</I>, however, not only gave B&S an award, but excerpt their book in the same issue. This odd sort of self-dealing appears to be a pattern at the monthly: in his section of the magazine, editor Charlie Peters takes the <I>California Journal</I>'s side in a legal dispute with the <I>Wall Street Journal</I>; later in the magazine, the <I>California Journal</I>'s managing editor has a long article.

<b>The Senate's Only Democratic Committee Chairman</b><br>
Bad news for conservatives in the Senate. Indiana Sen. Dan Coats has decided not to challenge Vermont Senator James Jeffords for chairmanship of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee. The committee has always been a trouble spot, featuring some of the Democrats' most liberal Senators and some of the Republicans' most accommodating members. Retiring "Clueless in Kansas" Sen. Nancy Kassebaum was the last chairman, and with Jeffords taking over for her, if anything, the panel will get worse. Jeffords was the only Republican sponsor of the Clinton health care bill. His AFLCIO rating (45 per cent) is nearly as high as his U.S. Chamber of Commerce rating (55 per cent). In short, he's just the type of legislator who helped make the U.S. Senate a graveyard for House initiatives over the last two years. But disloyalty apparently has its rewardnow he's going to be chairman of one of the Senate's most important committees.

<b>Bias Squared</b><br>
"What every conservative press critic preaches, and almost every reporter denies, is largely true: the mainstream press is liberal," writes William Powers in the cover story of this week's <I>New Republic</I>. ". . . When conservatives huff about the cabal of liberal journalists that is constantly plotting to slant coverage, they are right about the effects but wrong about the cause. There is no plotting at all: liberal bias flows from principles so deeply held they're mostly unconscious." It's nice, we guess, to get another admission of liberal media bias by a non-conservative. But somehow such admissions always come wrapped in layers of condescension. No serious conservative press criticcertainly not L. Brent Bozell and his colleagues at the Media Research Center, perhaps the most prolificmaintains that reporters are "constantly plotting to slant coverage." (Notice, by the way, the pejorative choice of verb, "huff," which is a standard <I>TNR</I> technique for parroting an observation and slamming the observer simultaneously.) Most conservatives think that for a variety of sociological reasons journalists tend to be liberal, and this fact affects their coverage. Evidently Powers agrees. Couldn't he just say that on this point, conservatives are unambiguously right?

<P>
<b>Sin Tax Sins</b><br>
Libertarian <I>Washington Post<I/> columnist James Glassman today defends liquor companies' right to advertise their product. Guardians of the public health, he suggests, ought to try to raise beer taxes instead. He writes that "we don't tax beer nearly enough. Currently, the United States earns"surely he means "takes"?as much in excise taxes from a single bottle of scotch as it does from 39 cans of beer, according to Congressional Budget Office figures." Say it ain't so, Jim! Repeat after us: Beer isn't undertaxed; scotch is overtaxed.

<b>Oops</b><br>
Jonathan Yardley, one of the <I>Washington Post</I>'s most sensible regular reviewers and columnists, wrote in Sunday's Book World that "even the most devout Christians" know that Christ wasn't born on Christmas day. Even? Surely Yardley means "especially."

Jeff Rosen's gargantuan cover story in the <I>New Republic</I> on "O.J. Simpson, critical race theory, American law, and the triumph of color over justice" is attracting a lot of attention. Hilton Kramer and Maureen Dowd have both called it "brilliant." We're fans of Rosen, but this time we must demur. The essay's critique of critical race theory is neither novel nor sufficiently pointed. The article's only original insight is the linkage between that theory and the Simpson trial, which is sort of obvious. Finally, his critique is more aesthetic than intellectual or moral. He uses the word "crude" more often than "wrong" to describe arguments. . . . 
<P>
In the same issue, Jacob Heilbrunnthe only person who has identified himself as one of the folks who joined Michael Lind's alleged exodus of intellectuals from the Righthas a shoddier article on "a startling new species: fellow travelers on the right" who apologize for anti-democratic regimes like Lee Kuan Yew's Singapore. Some of the examples are howlers: outgoing Sen. William Cohen ("R.," Me.) can hardly be described as part of the Right. A more glaring weakness is that Heilbrunn's proposed parallelism between the leftist attachment to Marxist regimes and revolutionaries and the right's alleged embrace of "Asian values" ignores the distinctioncentral to conservative foreign-policy thought for a decade and a halfbetween authoritarian and totalitarian regimes. Some conservatives may defend dictatorships on grounds that amount "to a relativistic multiculturalism." But a much older tradition of conservatism looks askance at the notion that there is one best set of political arrangements that works everywherenot because sound values vary from place to place, but because circumstances do. And lastly, Heilbrunn should have noted that plenty of conservatives have criticized Singapore's regime. Its censorship of reporter Christopher Lingle, an incident Heilbrunn mentions, was, for instance, the subject of a story in <I>National Review</I>.

<b>Investment Advice</b><br>
Jim Glassman's "Your Money" column in the Sunday <I>Washington Post</I> focuses on Jim Grant's bearish views. Grant says the stock market has entered its "absurd phase." Yields on dividend-paying stocks have fallen to 2.2 per cent, "even below their level just before the October 1987 crash." The average Standard & Poor p/e ratio recently hit 20, where it was only 15 last year. (Glassman doesn't note that some analysts think structural changes in the economy are raising the trendline p/e ratio.) And then Glassman adds a cute point: "Another danger is that nearly all market advisers think that stocks will keep rising. That's proven to be a negative sign in the past." Grant "believes a decline in the market is imminent, and, if it occurs, investors will not ride it out. They'll sell their funds. Managers will have to dump shares to meet the redemptions, driving prices down further." Glassman thinks, on the other hand, that investors should hold on to their stocks but not buy any new ones.

<b>Boys Will Be Boys</b><br>
For some reason, <I>Washington Times</I> columnist Wesley Pruden delights in sexual slurs against his assorted enemies: "They're not real men" is his constant theme, even when he's discussing women. Normally this is harmless enough. But it takes a particularly ugly twist in today's column, "Trashy talk can have its rewards." Pruden writes, "Only this week a court in Eau Claire, Wis., awarded a 21-year-old man a million dollars for 'pains and slights' suffered at the hands of his high-school chums, who razzed him because he was a homosexual who prefers lads to lassies. Such a deal. An award of a million dollars just to be the butt of a joke is enough to make anyone cheerful, if not gay. This kind of stuff could be catching, and there's even a government agency to make whiners feel good about themselves." Pruden's version of events is misleading on several counts. The award was $900,000; and it was an out-of-court settlement. But the real distortion is his out-of-context use of the phrase "'pains and slights'" and his own words "razzed" and "whiners." The man in this casea boy at the time, let's rememberwasn't just "razzed." He was shoved, spat upon, beaten, and urinated on. He was kicked in the abdomen so many times he required surgery. A good case can be made that awards and settlements shouldn't be this generous. But Pruden doesn't advance that case. Nor does he do a service to those conservatives who harbor moral objections to homosexual behavior and are unjustly accused of vile bigotry.
<P>
<b>Affirmative Distraction</b><br>
The latest <I>New Yorker</I> includes an essay by Alan Wolfe on affirmative action. Like a lot of writing on the subject, it focuses on race preferences to the exclusion of gender preferenceswhich is odd, since the latter is far more significant by many measures. The article has its insights, but it is marred by conceptual confusions and ignorance of the conservative movement. 
<P>
Most of the article is devoted to exploring the alleged implications of corporate America's attachment to racial preferences. He writes that "the right doesn't want to admit that affirmative action has the blessing of the marketplace." "In fact, there are no conservative arguments against the most effective and prevalent forms of affirmative action in America, those implemented by companies." This is, at the very least, muddled. It is simply erroneous to assume that all practices in the private sector are necessarily free-market phenomena: like HMOs, race preferences are at least partly an adaptation to an environment created by the government. Quotas, that is, prevent lawsuits alleging the infringement of state-created "rights." Quite a few conservatives would not have (political) objections to truly voluntary affirmative action, which would be neither required nor encouraged by the government. Clint Bolick, a leading libertarian foe of preferences whom Wolfe never mentions, has said as much; Dinesh D'Souza incorporated an argument along those lines in the conclusion of his much-excoriated <I>The End of Racism</I>.
<P> 
Wolfe's argument becomes slippery when he writes that "conservatives have only two choices: to become liberals if they are to reject affirmative action in the private sector, or to accept such affirmative action if they are to remain conservatives. So why haven't more conservatives endorsed affirmative action? One answer is that a surprising number of them haveor, at least, did. Even the Reagan Administration, for all its professed opposition to affirmative action, adopted the practice of 'race-norming'; that is, raising the scores of minorities on standardized tests to make them more comparable with the scores of whites." He then writes about the Nixon Administration's role in fostering preferences, which he says conservatives don't like to admit. This entire passage is, not to put too fine a point on it, nonsense. The practice of "race-norming" is not the sort of "affirmative action in the private-sector" that conservatives are supposedly obligated to support; and conservatives, who have no love for Nixon's domestic politics, almost always mention his role in the history of race preferences when they write about the subject.
<P> 
Wolfe's thesis collapses at the finish line. "Without governmental enforcement," he writes, "some private companies may indeed drop their enthusiasm for diversity and retreat to 'birds of a feather' hiring policies." If that's the case, how can it be said that affirmative action "has the blessing of the marketplace"? Plenty of conservatives, though not all of us, would have no problem with Wolfe's conclusion that "while it makes sense for government to aspire to color blindness in order to underscore the importance of universality, companies and private universities ought to be free to take race into account for reasons of pluralism." Here is what <I>NR</I> said about the subject in its August 14, 1995 issue: "Conservatives may argue among themselves over whether purely voluntary, private affirmative action should be banned (as adherence to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 would require), but market forces would probably minimize such discrimination once [government regulations encouraging it were eliminated]." Wolfe is clearly the type of liberal who likes to think that ideas that complex never occur to conservatives.

<b>Ominous News</b><br>
American Enterprise Institute pollster Karlyn Bowman isn't sure what to make of the trend, but it appears that public opinion toward government is softening. This could be, she says, a "prosperity effect": people tend to worry less about runaway government during good times. But might it also suggest a general flabbiness in Republicans' pressing the limited-government case these days?
<P>
<b>For Worse</b><br>
The <I>Washington Post</I> Style section today carries a front-page story on a wedding, titled "Every Girl's Dream." That ought to be enough information for our readers to figure out that the wedding concerned pairs two lesbians. (Heterosexual marriages don't warrant Style treatment unless they involve celebrities.) One woman's family plans to attend; the other woman's family is torn between, guess what, love and prejudice. You could, in other words, write the article half-asleep. ABC's <I>20/20</I> did a segment on same-sex marriages, cleverly titled "For Better or Worse," a few weeks ago. ABC at least allowed family members opposed to same-sex marriage to have a say; but of course, none of them were articulate. Under no circumstances is an articulate traditionalist case allowed on the air. Since it looks like the gay-rights side is going to win in a matter of years anyway, why not say conservatives surrender now, and spare ourselves an endless stream of saccharine documentaries?
<P>
<B>Word to the Wise</b><br>
<I>National Review</I> is sponsoring a forum at the Heritage Foundation next Tuesday, 24 p.m., on the politics of abortion. Does the Republican Party's pro-life stance hurt its political prospects, as is often claimed? Ann Stone, head of Republicans for Choice, and Jim Pinkerton will argue that it does and should be changed. Columnist Maggie Gallagher and Frank Cannon, of Lehrman Bell Mueller Cannon, will argue the contrary position. Karlyn Bowman of the American Enterprise Institute will walk us through poll data on the subject. And <I>NR</I>'s own Kate O'Beirne will moderate. Come one, come all.

<B>TNR Notes</B><br>

The latest <I>New Republic</I> includes an inaugural "TRB" column from its new editor, Michael Kelly, fresh from the <I>New Yorker</I>. It's as well written as ever, but more pointed and open in its political position: that of a chastened, centrist liberal. . . . We've had fun with Michael Walzer's effusions in the <I>New Republic</I>'s "The Hard Questions" column before. This week's isn't particularly amusing; it's just daft. Walzer argues that "the right way out of the 'culture wars'" is to provide government funding for groups like the Gay Men's Health Crisis and black Baptist nursery schools, in order to make these institutions as strong as groups like Catholic Charities and Lutheran Social Ministries, the expressions of an older "multiculturalism." Where to begin ticking off the conceptual problems here? Making independent organizations as government-dependent as Catholic Charities is a recipe not for a vibrant civil society but a neutered and standardized one. Moreover, diversity of "religion, ethnicity, race, and region" is not the same as multiculturalism and has never been so considered by its prominent latter-day critics. Catholics never demanded separatist group rights or their own language; Farrakhanites and Hispanic lobbies do. For them to demand state funds is to ask a polity to fund its own dissolution. And lastly, the phrase "culture wars" most importantly denotes conflicts over competing visions of justice, morality, human personhood, and their implications for such practices as abortion. Converting the Federal Government into a large Ford Foundation isn't going to make those conflicts disappear.

<B>The Bi-Partisan Trap</B><br>
Newt Gingrich and Dick Gephardt held a joint press conference over the weekend that was full of talk of reconciliation, and completing the people's work, and bi-partisanship. Which is fine as far as it goes. There is no need for Republicans to be gratuitously partisan or confrontational with the Administration. But Republicans should also keep in mind that President Clinton built his political recovery on smart, well-managed partisan confrontation on the issues of his choosing: Medicare, the balanced budget, the government shut-downs. People hate partisan conflict in theory, but will endorse it in practice as long as it is marshaled against something they oppose (like the Clinton health-care bill back in 1993). Republicans might want to apply this lesson to the President's proposed intervention in Zaire. There is no national interest at stake, nor is it clear what goals U.S. troops would have in a mission there. Over the weekend the Administration had to re-consider the mission when Rwandan refugee began departing refugee camps in Zairewithout U.S. helpto head back to Rwanda; helping them make this trek was one of the goals of the U.S. intervention. The deeper problem in Zaire is that the government there is essentially non-existent, and if any intervention is going to have any long-term impact it will have to involve perilous and difficult "nation building." But that clearly is more than the American people will support; anything less thought is just a band aid. So why are American troops going to Zaire? And why aren't Republicans vocally opposing the idea?

<b>Newt: Should He Stay or Should He Go?</b><br>
	


The hot controversy inside Washington today was sparked by Kate O'Beirne's column in the current issue of <I>National Review</I> suggesting that perhaps it might be in the best interests of the Speaker Gingrich to temporarily step down from his leadership post, and if he did so a good replacement would be Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde. The column made ABC News, the <I>Washington Post</I>, the newspaper <I>Roll Call</I>,  and prompted remarks by Rep. Steve Largent (Okla.) that it might indeed be advisable for Newt to take a hiatus. Feelings against Gingrich do seem to run high among Republican freshmen who feel they were led astray by Gingrich over the last two years (many of them were shot at with bullets with Newt's name on them in the just-completed campaign). Also, the feeling that Gingrich has become a liability runs high among GOP opinion-makers in Washington, but until now has gone unspoken. The Gingrich forces were so worried about the stir that they reportedly called Hyde's office to see if he was collecting 
votes to challenge Gingrich in next week's internal Republican leadership elections. Such a challenge won't be forthcoming from Hyde, or anyone else for that matter. If Gingrich is going to go, he would indeed have to step aside voluntarily. But the Speaker is still in a precarious position. Yesterday liberal Republican Rep. Chris Shay (Conn.) announced he won't vote for Gingrich for Speaker in Januarythe public, official voteif the ethics committee report on Gingrich has not yet been made public. It seems a sensible demandbut, then again, Gingrich allies suggest this will only give Democrats on the committee reason to stall. Whatever happens, it will be a much reduced Speaker Newt Gingrich come the start of the new Congress, and Republicans have to be willing to think about the possibility in a few months of there being no Speaker Gingrich at all.

<b>Spare the Rod</b><br>
	
Conservative activist and strategist Jeff Bell's Parental Rights Amendment, which some social conservatives think of as a silver bullet, was tested in battle in Colorado on Tuesday. It lost, big. Bell explains that the PRA was unable to win any support from Colorado elites, including conservative elites. The Rocky Mountain News, Vincent Carroll, and Bill Armstrong all came out against it. Nobody with authority was willing to counter the canard that the PRA would license child abuse. (Although there really isn't any doubt on that score: previous legal findings of parental rights have had no problems distinguishing between legitimate parental authority and abuse.) Undecided voters tend to break against ballot initiatives; this conservative instinct was mobilized against a conservative reform. Still, Bell isn't too discouraged. He notes that term limits lost its first test, when Washington voters rejected it after a similarly alarmist and misleading campaign. (Washington was supposedly going to lose the benefits of seniority, and then California's delegation would take all its water rights away.) In any case, the point of the PRA campaign is not to win and generate litigation as much as it is to educate the public about the depredations of modern liberalism. The campaign, in other words, is the point. And the campaign continues

<b>NR Washington's Election Predictions</b><br>
	Pundits all around the country are weighing in with their election predictions, here is NR Washington's Stab at Prognostication:
<P>
	The Presidency: Bill Clinton, of course, wins in a walk, but a closer walk than people think. The president will be held below 50 per centprobably the 4748 rangedealing a blow to his plans to claim an election mandate (the press may well give him one anyway). Dole has been closing in recent days thanks to the Indonesian scandals. The word is that Dole internal polls have him within 6 points in California, which he must win if he is going to pull off his electoral-vote inside straight. But it's too late for him to win there. The campaign has also been taking heart from the Reuters/Zogby poll which has Dole down by just 4 point nationally. But most other tracking polls have Clinton up by 9-16 points, and with the President leading in Republican states like Arizona and Florida he is assured a very pleasant election evening. The Senate: Republicans gain two or three seats. Republicans will pick up seats in the South; they will certainly win the open Howell Heflin seat in Alabama, are likely to win the David Pryor seat in Louisiana, and have a chance to win Democratic open seats in Georgia (Republican Guy Millner has pulled even with Max Cleland) and Louisiana (Republican Woody Jenkins is tied with Mary Landrieu). Meanwhile, the only Republican incumbent who will lose is Sen. Larry Pressler who is trailing in South Dakota. Sen. Bob Smith will pull it out in New Hampshire, and Sen. Jesse Helms will be fine in North Carolina. Get ready for some more troops for Trent Lott (and they'll be more conservative too). The House: Republicans lose 5-7 seats tops and could even make some gains. The tide has clearly shifted the Republicans' way at the congressional level, thanks in part to a huge barrage of negative advertising against the Democrats. There are only 10 or so Republican freshmen who seem sure to lose. There are another nearly 30 seats where the Democrats have a chance, but these potential Democratic gains are easily offset by 10 Democratic seats where the GOP seems likely to make pick-ups and another roughly 20 where the Republicans have a chance. When all the dust settles the situation in the House will look much the way it does nowwith one important exception. By early summer, one way or another, Newt Gingrich will no longer be Speaker.

<b>"California Pandering"</b><br>
The <I>New York Times</I>'s latest insult to the intelligence of its readers was Thursday's editorial denouncing California's Proposition 209, the initiative to ban racial and gender preferences in state contracting, employment and university admissions. <I>The Times</I> complains that Bob Dole, "who voted for the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964, and a stream of race-conscious Federal laws since then, could now be heard complaining that all of these efforts, including many he had supported, had turned out to be a 'blind alley.' " We will eat an entire edition of the <I>Times</I> if Mr. Dole can be proved to have repudiated the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Notice also the slippery elision between that act and race-conscious laws that followed: some of the language, and the entire spirit, of Proposition 209 is borrowed from the 1964 act, which was a historic blow against "race consciousness." But it gets worse. The <I>Times</I> blasts Dole for having "tossed around code words like 'preferences' and 'quotas.' " Oh, so these things are figments of the right-wing imagination. (Have you noticed, by the way, that the word "liberal" increasingly appears in quote marks, as in "the 'liberal' Paul Wellstone," as if only a shameless partisan opponent would think to attach that label to moderates like the Senator from Minnesota?) Then we learn that "Proposition 209 is a retrograde measure that would deprive state authorities of what little leverage they have to promote true equality of opportunitya point President Clinton has grasped." These are the depths to which standards of argument have fallen at West 43rd St. Clinton is further congratulated for having "defused an angry national debate over affirmative action" with his " 'mend it, don't end it' policy." In fact, Clinton has done nothing to alter the practice of race and gender preferences, and his Justice Department has tried to extend them. "Mend it, don't end it" is a slogan, not a policy. But perhaps in the Clinton era, the <I>New York Times</I> can't tell the difference. 
<P>
<b>Affirmative Reaction</b><br>
The <I>New York Times</I> is on to something, though. The political battle over the California Civil Rights Initiative has featured a veritable avalanche of sleaze and misinformationall coming from its opponents. Take the new ad campaign against it. One ad features Candace Bergen saying, "If 209 passes, we could lose maternity benefits. . . . 209 will cut funding for rape crisis centers." In another, Bruce Springsteen exhorts the "working men and women" of California to vote against the proposition because it "will legalize discrimination against women and girls in jobs, in education, and in sports." Ellen De Generes's ad makes a bizarre link between the initiative and "the anti-choice boys" of "the religious right." A. Woodard appears in yet another ad quoting Gloria Steinem: "209 could wipe out maternity benefits." All these claims have something in common: they are lies, deliberate and utter fabrications. Bubble-headed Hollywood types may not know any better, but the people who write their lines surely do . The campaign to preserve race and gender preferences ought to be ashamed of itself. Here's hoping California voters won't be fooled. But if they are, it will not be proof that preferences are popular; it will be proof that they can only be sustained by a campaign of vicious demagoguery and simple lies.

<b>Holding The House and Senate?</b>
All right: here's some (possible) good news for a change. As of yet there's no sign of a national Democratic tide that would sweep the party back into control of the Senate and House. Although Republicans are still warily eyeing Clinton's final all-out campaign push, they are encouraged by trends in Senate and House races. In Senate races in Nebraska, Montana, and Iowa Republicans have made big gains in the last week in seats being defended by the Democrats. Presumablyalthough no one can say anything for surethe trend would be the opposite if Clinton were building a national Democratic wave. In the House the trend is similar. The kind of freshmen Democrats will have to beat to regain the majority have built leads over their opponents in recent weeks: Phil English and Jon Fox in Pennsylvania and Bob Ney, Steve Chabot and Steven La Tourette in Ohio. Republicans think a number of factors are working in their favor as the campaign draws to a close. 1) The message that Bill Clinton shouldn't be given a "blank check" with a Democratic Congressthe National Republican Campaign Committee is running ads to this effect in 50 House racesseems to be taking hold. 2) The continuing high-profile Asian fundraising scandal increases uneasiness with Clinton and supports the idea he can't be trusted with a Democratic Congress. 3) The Republican national committees are finally unleashing a tide of spending across the country, the National Rifle Association is kicking in a late $1.5 million independent expenditure, and Republican candidates have tended to save their resources, until now, for the final push. 4) The Christian Coalition will presumably be turning out voters big-time in an election everyone agrees will hinge largely on turn-out. 5) Perot seems to be gaining ground, and if his voters show up at the polls they will tend to vote for GOP congressional candidates. But Republicans should hold their breath until they actually cross the finish line. What they all dread is a smashing Clinton victory in the East, trumpeted by the networks around 8 p.m. eastern-time or so, which keeps Republicans away from the polls everywhere else. If that happens, despite everything, it might be time to start saying "Speaker Gephardt." (Uh, that's the bad news.)

The notion of "charter schools" is alluring (see, e.g., the last <I>Public Interest</I>), the point being to save public education by encouraging school districts to pay for innovative and rigorous new schools that evade excessive bureaucracy. But then theory runs smack into reality. The Board of Education in Washington, D.C., approved an application by A. . "Mama" Anigbo to open an Afrocentric charter school featuring standard English as a "foreign language," no failing grades, students dressed in military camouflage fatigues, and a staff including a convicted armed robber (the security guard) and a principal ("Mama" Anigbo herself) charged with assaulting a court officer and a housing inspector. When Susan Ferrechio, a <I>Washington Times</I> reporter, showed up to a do a story on the school, a mob of eight or nine students and teachers, including "Mama" Anigbo, told her to "get your white a out of this school," then grabbed, kicked, and pushed her out. Miss Anigbo (250 lbs.) alleges that the Miss Ferrechio (110 lbs.) assaulted her first. When Miss Ferrechio came back with cops and a photographer, a still-larger melee ensued. Well, a charter school can't be better than the people who run it, who probably won't be any better than the school district that hires them. Conservative education-reformers, take note.

	For almost two decades Ralph Nader and his followers badgered car manufacturers to install airbags in every automobile. Eventually the Naderites got their way, and since 1991 all new passenger vehicles have been required by federal law to include these devices at an increased cost to car buyers of about $500 per vehicle. Now it is being publicly admitted that airbags are unsafe for children and small adults. Trouble seems to be that the airbags, which explode out of their housing at 200mph, will give you a powerful whack. For long-armed adults sitting well back in the seat, airbags do a fine job of cushioning the abdomen from the force of a head-on collision. But the same device will hit a child or a small adult in the face, producing head and neck injuries, sometimes fatal.
<P>
	In time, the manufacturers will probably succeed in fine-tuning airbags, but the existing 12 million cars equipped with the first generation will remain as testimony to the dangers of federal mandates. Every safety innovation involves costs and risks, whose consequences are different from different peopleindividuals should be permitted to do their own evaluating.

	In 1899 a baby girl was born to a poor family in China. Three previous children had died in infancy, and the family hoped for a boy. The midwife expected that the baby would be exposed to die as was customary, but the father allowed the girl to live and gave her an education. Jeanette Li became an educator and had a long and productive life, amply justifying her father's decision. She also had a son. Min Chu Li became a physician and obtained a position at the National Cancer Institute, where he showed that the drug methotrexate caused complete disappearance of choriocarcinoma, a rare but fatal tumor occurring in young women. This was the first demonstration that chemotherapy could cure metastatic cancer, as well as the first demonstration that widely disseminated cancer could be cured by any means.
<P>
	Abortion and infanticide have been discussed from many viewpoints, but often with the tacit assumption that potential or nascent human beings are interchangeable: the fetus aborted today can be fully replaced by a baby born later. One need not be a geneticist, or a theologian, to know that this is not so. Jeanette Li's father, an uneducated peasant, knew it. Overpopulation and unwanted pregnancy are real problems; lofty pronouncements cannot solve them. But it is equally unrealistic to assume that human beings, even potential or nascent ones, are as replaceable, and hence disposable, as automobile parts.

 <LI>There is a trade dispute brewing with the European Community over its demand that imported U.S. food products show whether genetic engineering or recombinant-DNA techniques (rDNA) have been used to enhance the plant's resistance to predator organisms. It is rapidly becoming standard plant-breeding practice to use rDNA to accentuate plants' natural defense mechanisms against fungi, insects, and rodents. The same thing used to be done by watching the mutations of plants in plant-breeding farms and selecting those seedlings that had better protection. Advances in molecular biology now let plant breeders go directly to the plants' genetic material to find natural "pesticides" and implant them in new plant breeds.
<P>
	By relying on natural plant resistance, farmers need less synthetic chemical pesticide and fungicide to ensure that human beings, rather than a horde of little critters, get the crop. This was exactly what environmentalists advocated vociferously a couple of decades ago when it couldn't be done. Now that it is being done, they are against it. They raise the specter of Dr. Strangelove scientists misusing rDNA technology to develop strains of fruits and vegetables with subtle carcinogenic properties. Killer tomatoes.
<P>
Scientists around the world have repeatedly affirmed that rDNA is no more capable of changing the nature of plants than seed-selection techniques practiced since cultivation began millennia ago. But the eco-hysterics got the agricultural bureaucrats in Brussels to draft regulations for special labeling of rDNA use. Now protectionist farmers in Europe are using the lack of U.S. rDNA labeling to exclude U.S. produce.
<P>
And where is President Clinton's Environmental Protection Agency? On the side of eco-hysterics and protectionists, of course. It wants to bring genetic materials under its regulatory authority the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) by arguing that genetic extracts from plant materials are "plant pesticides" under the law and that they should be regulated and labeled in the same manner. FIFRA was enacted before rDNA techniques were developed and had been used to regulate conventional chemical pesticides. The EPA's effort to weigh in on the side of the anti-rDNA forces was signaled by an inconspicuous notice in the Federal Register.

 <LI>The Heritage Foundation has produced an impressive new volume, <I>Restoring American Leadership: A U.S. Foreign and Defense Policy Blueprint</I>. The Heritage team of experts, directed by Kim R. Holmes and Thomas G. Moore, surveys the fundamental problems of U.S. national strategy, in areas such as challenges (especially in Europe, the Far East, and the Middle East), defense policy, economic policy, and the tools of policy-making (the UN, intelligence, foreign aid, public diplomacy). It is a well-done critique, with wise prescriptionsa needed antidote to isolationist undercurrents that would leave the world a more dangerous place.

 <LI>Bill Clinton has charged Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle  with the unenviable assignment of negotiating a settlement with Congressional Republicans on the partial-birth abortion ban. His task: get the GOP to exempt  from the ban women whose "health" might be adversely affected by carrying their children to term.  Call it Mission Impossible. Pro-life Republicans know better than to fumble this issue; the Supreme Court has defined "health" so broadly that it includes emotional well-being and maternal youth. And, as Sen. Rick Santorum (R-Penn.) points out, "this procedure would never be used in an emergency," as it takes three days to perform. But given the Republicans' obvious intransigence, it seems peculiar that the President would be so eager to revisit this losing issueunless he fears that the 105th Congress will succeed in overriding his ban. This is a valid concern: Senate Republicans fell only nine votes short of overruling the President in the last term, and in the meantime they have picked up two more seats. Moderate Democratsthose uncomfortable having their names associated with infanticidewill be less likely to succumb to White House arm-twisting when their President is a lame duck, and some have re-election campaigns of their own to worry about in 1998. The hitch is that the President will try to turn the issue against the GOP, chastising its refusal to sign on as gridlock and indifference to women's concerns. 
If Republicans shield their ears from this Sirens' song, however, the public will recognize Clinton's desperation strategy  for what is. Then Congress might just get that override Clinton so fears.

 <LI> For twelve days in November, French truck drivers went on strike demanding early retirement, shorter working hours, and more pay. They did not merely refuse to work, as is their right, but set up over 200 blockadesat ports, on freeways, and around major cities and oil refineries. Road transport was massively disrupted, stocks of food and gas ran low, and foreign truck drivers, held hostage in the blockades, were compelled to live in their cabins without washing. One British driver who protested was admitted to intensive care after being severely beaten up by French truckers. Throughout the entire crisis, the government insisted that it would not "use force" to break the blockades. It thereby admitted that it was not prepared to fulfill its duty to uphold the rule of law. The settlement with the truckers will cost $200 million, and the country now faces hundreds of millions of dollars in claims from companies abroad who were severely hit. The French economy also suffered severely for the second time in a yearfrom a strike. But this is merely the inevitable tribute which a decadent political system must pay to any interest group willing to trample the common good.

 Last month President Clinton came clean on Bosnia, finally revealing that 8,500 U.S. troops would remain past the original December 20 deadline. The original deployment of 35,000 Americans had "succeeded beyond our expectations," he said, but a follow-on force, more limited in size and mandate, was required for another 18 months to ensure political stability. IFOR (Implementation Force) will be renamed SFOR (Stabilization Force). The problems, needless to say, are manybeginning with Congressional anger at Clinton's denials before the election that any such extension was planned. More  important, the political provisions of the Dayton Accords, which aim at creating a unitary, multi-ethnic Bosnian state, are beginning to unravel. U.S. training and equipping of the Bosnianswhich the President had promised Congresshas barely begun, leaving them still dependent on foreign troops. The President may get his way, given the difficulty of cutting off funds and overriding a veto, but he compounds all his risks, at home and in Bosnia, unless he keeps his promise this time and gives the Bosnians the wherewithal to defend themselves.

<LI> A study published recently in the <I>American Journal of Public Health</I> suggests that racial discrimination by whites against blacks causes high blood pressure in blacks. Curiously, it was among blacks who were unaware that they had suffered discrimination that the effect was most pronounced.

The study did not address the effect that black-on-white crimewhich according to Irving Horowitz in the January 1995 issue of <I>Society</I> in 60 times greater than white-on-black crimehas on the health of whites.

But why is what is they did so much more heinous than what a doctor might have done a few hours earlier, in a partial-birth abortion? The best line on this ugly affair belongs to George Will: "Could Delaware choose to execute the two by inserting scissors into the bases of their skulls, opening the scissors, inserting suction tubes and sucking out their brains? Of course not. The Constitution forbids choosing cruel and unusual punishments."

 a conservative Republican. The only reason I didn't vote for Barry Goldwater was because I was nine years old at the time. I am for medical marijuana because of my politics. But I'm also for it because I've had to use it.
<P>
As a political journalist, I mark the milestones of my life by election cycles. On the eve of Ronald Reagan's election I got married. On the eve of Bill Clinton's I got testicular cancer. The treatment was straightforwardoperation, followed by a rather harsh form of chemotherapy. Any chemotherapy is harsh, because all chemotherapy is poison. You're dumping poison into your bloodstream, killing millions of cells, in order to kill the thousands of malignant cells, which will not recover. Because it is poison, the body wants to get rid of it. That's why chemotherapy causes nausea. To deal with this, I took the latest anti-nausea drugs, including Zofran, and I also did self-hypnosis and mental imaging. These all worked to a point. But beyond that point, I needed extra help, and so I smoked marijuana.
<P>
I had smoked marijuana maybe ten times in college, during the Seventies. I even inhaled. I stopped because I found I didn't like smoke, or being high, or the conversation of pot-heads. I turned to it when I got cancer because marijuana gives healthy people an appetite, and prevents people who are nauseated from throwing up. None of my doctors or nurses at New York University Medical Center, or Memorial Sloan-Kettering, discouraged me from doing this. They had all had patients who had used marijuana to fight nausea, and who had reported good results. I had good results too. Because of the marijuana, my last two courses of chemotherapy were almost nausea-free.
<P>
There was only one problem-I had to become a criminal to do this.
<P>
Cancer patients are not the only people in this bind. AIDS patients who have the wasting syndrome report that marijuana gives them an appetite again. Glaucoma patients find that it arrests the deterioration of their eyes. People with chronic migraines, epilepsy, and multiple sclerosis use it to relieve their symptoms. A good summary of all these experiences can be found in <I>Marihuana: The Forbidden Medicine</I>, by Lester Grinspoon MD, and James B. Bakalar. Dr. Grinspoon is a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, and the book is published by Yale University Press, so this is not something downloaded from the Internet. But any sick person who wants to use marijuana to help himself has to break the law. I'm a member of the media elite, who lives in Manhattan, so I wasn't at high risk. But plenty of sick people get arrested, and plenty of them go to jail.
<P>
There are three common arguments against the medical use of marijuana, all of them faulty.
<P>
The first is that THC, the main active ingredient in the drug, is available in a legally prescribable pill form. But the pill has problems. It's expensive. Because it's a pill, and therefore slower acting, people have trouble adjusting the dosage; they often find themselves taking too much. It also seems to cause high levels of anxiety and depression. In my case, I thought treating nausea with a pill was not a bright idea.
<P>
The second argument is that smoked marijuana has never been tested scientifically. This is not entirely true. One test was done at UCLA in 1970 for the Los Angeles Police Department, which wanted to prove that pot smoking dilated the pupils. The researchers found that it contracted the pupils; they also discovered that marijuana relieved pressure within the eyeball. This is why marijuana is useful in treating glaucoma.
But it is true that it is difficult to test marijuana. That is because the government makes it so. The case of Dr. Donald Abrams at San Francisco General Hospital is instructive. Dr. Abrams is an AIDS researcher who wants to test the efficacy of smoked marijuana in treating the wasting syndrome. For more than two years, he tried to get marijuana legally from the National Institute on Drug Abuse for his experimentsto no avail. So doctors cannot prescribe marijuana because it hasn't been tested, but doctors aren't allowed to do any tests. This is a classic Catch-22.
<P>
The third objection is that by legalizing marijuana in one area, we will be setting a bad example to a society engaged in a war on drugs. In fact we will be setting no example at all. The availability of morphine in hospitals is not the reason people smoke crack. A hairless cancer patient with an IV tube in his arm is not a come-on for a pusher.
<P>
The connection between the issue of medical marijuana and the war on drugs runs the other way. The reason we don't allow medical use is because of the spill-over of an extreme war-time psychology. <I>National Review</I> has taken a stand on the war on drugs, but it is not relevant here. If you think the war is wrong, then the ban on medical marijuana is simply one symptom among many of its excess and folly. If you think the war is right, then the ban is an irrelevant and over-zealous off-shoot, like fighting the Kaiser in World War I by changing the German names of Midwestern streets.
<P>
I want to end by addressing my fellow Republicans. My support for medical marijuana is not a contradiction of my principles, but an extension of them. I am for law and order. But crime has to be fought intelligently, and the law disgraces itself when it harasses the sick. I am for traditional virtuesI support the Christian Coalition, and I supported the Moral Majority. But carrying your beliefs to unjust ends is not moral, it is philistine. Most important, I believe in getting government off people's backs. We should include the backs of sick people trying to help themselves.
<P>
My cancer is gone now; I was lucky. God forbid that anyone in this room should ever need chemotherapy. But statistics tell us that many of us will. Let me assure you that, whatever you think now, or however you vote, if that moment comes to you, you will turn to marijuana. Extend that liberty to your fellow citizens.

<font size=+3>I</font> <font size=+1>WOULD</font> have written this review sooner, but my computer broke down. I am not sure why it went dead, but since it did so just after I punched it, I would guess that there was some sort of connection. Why did I punch my computer? To punish it, of course. I had recently gotten on the Internet. After crawling -- not surfing -- along for about an hour and a half in search of some specific item of information, I had come just within reach of what I wanted when a stupid little screen display popped up and declared that Netscape, suffering from sensory overload, had had the cybernetic equivalent of a nervous breakdown. It was then that I punched my laptop.
<P>
In <I>Life on the Screen: Identity in the Age of the Internet</I>, Sherry Turkle presents us with a somewhat romanticized vision of the evolving interaction between computers and people. She notes that she has named her computer Miss Beautiful -- a sobriquet for her daughter -- and she tells of one of her students who named a computer program that organized her daily schedule after an  ex-boyfriend (``I love to see him do my menial tasks''). To me such personification is totally alien, even if I confess to feeling a little sorry for having acted aggressively against a machine that had served me irreproachably for the past year. Though I refuse to personify my computer, however, I do spatialize it. That is, as I peer into the blue, lacustrine depths of the Windows program, with its delightful frieze of parti-colored icons along the top, I feel as if I were floating in a post-modern swimming pool somewhere on Ischia or Capri. In other words, I feel at home in my computer and I am comfortable and happy there.
<P>
Still, that does not qualify me as a ``computer person,'' and I even take a little pride in not being one. This was one reason I had delayed for some time before subscribing to an Internet service. Another reason was that I failed to see what consequence this technology could possibly have for my life, why I really needed it. What finally convinced me to subscribe was the prospect of sending and receiving e-mail, not to mention a commercial in which Barry Farber seemed to suggest, if I understood him correctly, that I would essentially be able to launch intercontinental ballistic missiles from the intimacy of my bedroom.
<P>
I was soon undeceived. The first thing one notices about the Internet is that it has been vastly overrated. Though you will have heard of the Information Super-Highway, what awaits you is rather a high-tech single-lane dirt road where an excess of traffic has brought transportation almost to a standstill. Though you will also have heard about ``surfing'' the Internet, the gliding swiftness implied by that word will mean little to those who seem rather to limp or stumble than to surf. And to the extent that the surfing analogy has any validity, it is only in the sense that any moment a big wave -- as in more data than your fragile modem can handle -- will overwhelm the whole contraption.
<P>
The second thing one notices is that the Internet is the subtlest thief of time. By making you wait for each parcel of data you want, it steals a minute here and four minutes there until, before you know it, two hours of your life are gone beyond recall. And during this period of waiting, because these deposits of time are so tiny, you are unable to engage in any other activity. Add to this the fact that, once you arrive at the site, you are apt to find a poorly written document whose loopy, time-consuming graphics are as appealing as public-access cable television in all its ranting, unedited profusion. There are many polished web sites, but most of these turn out to be little more than advertisements for providers of commercial goods and services, or they are documents provided by non-profit organizations. The idea that one can surf through the shelves of the public library may one day become a reality, but we are very far from that now.
<P>
The Internet works in two ways. By typing in a web address, you can go directly to a specific site that has information that you know you want. But to surf the Internet is different. This suggests going along for the ride and not quite knowing where you are going. You do this by typing in the name of the subject or person you want to research. A moment later, the search mechanism, in my case Netscape, applies its various inscrutable criteria to come up with the nearest matches to what you seek. Naturally I began by typing in my name to see how many people on the Internet had mentioned -- dare I hope it -- my articles or my book. Here I ran into one of the most common problems with the Internet. The searcher cannot give you the object itself, but only matches of greater or lesser probability and a synopsis of each site. Thus when I entered the name James Gardner, it told me that it had found 86,754 Jameses and 23,456 Gardners and then proceeded to give examples in which the two words occurred in the requisite proximity. Unfortunately my name is not an uncommon one, and so I had to get through several entomologists and chiropractors, two naval engineers and a masseur before finding any reference to myself.
<P>
For some time I continued in this way to putter around on the information dirt road, accomplishing little and gradually coming to understand that the Internet, for all that people have said about it, is a more or less total waste of time and a not inconsiderable waste of money.
<P>
<font size=+3>A</font><font size=+1>ND</font> it was at precisely that moment that something happened which caused me suddenly to appreciate what everyone has been talking about for the last two or three years. What I understood was that the Internet can be viewed as a massive encyclopedia. But whereas all earlier encyclopedias, simply by virtue of their existing as physical objects, were in a sense dead and out of date as a precondition of their very existence, the Internet by contrast is the Encyclopedia of NOW. As it happens I am finishing up a book on fringe groups, a subject which the Internet is uniquely qualified to tackle. I found at my fingertips abundant information about flat-earthers, Andrea Dworkin, snuff films, Queer Nation, the John Birch Society, creationism, and Islamic Jihad.
<P>
Another thing the Internet teaches you is that, no matter how obscure your interests, there are other people out there in cyberspace who are as passionate about them as you are. Though I know very few people whose interest in Latin is as energetic as my own, I soon found that I could correspond in that language with a group of college men in the Netherlands as well as an old professor in Finland and someone else in South Africa. What I find important and emblematic about this fact is that the futuristic Internet can be an agent by which the past is preserved and reinvigorated.
<P>
When I understood that, I confess that I had something of a conversion regarding not only the Internet, but also the great information revolution which is said to be getting under way. As of this moment mankind is entranced by the possibilities of computing. The almost obsessive insistence with which people seem to talk of nothing else, with which the Internet haunts our business pages, publishers' catalogues, and the graphics of advertisers and television producers, suggests that something almost incalculably big is afoot. To some degree this fascination resembles the interest in the atom 50 years ago and in space exploration 25 years ago. But neither of these technologies ever really promised, and surely neither ever produced, a direct and material effect upon our daily lives. With the Internet, by contrast, there is a nervous, giddy sense that, at long last, we are approaching some kind of critical mass. There is a buzz running so loud through all the breadth of human society, an electric excitement so jolting and so unexpected, that one could be excused for thinking that we are on the verge of some great new age. And though books, if we believe the prophets of doom, are soon to vanish from the earth, there is nothing publishers seem to find more attractive or salable than volumes that promote and explain this instrument of their allegedly imminent demise.
<P>
The <I>People</I> magazine approach to the information revolution can be found in <I>Road Warriors</I>, by Daniel Burstein and David Kline. For these two investigative journalists, despite a useful introduction that reveals their deep understanding of what is at stake, the information revolution is essentially a re-enactment of earlier heroic ages of capitalist free-enterprise. But instead of the Fisks and the Goulds, we have shakers and movers ranging from John Malone and Ray Smith to Viacom, Sprint, and the Federal Communications Commission. Nevertheless, the authors are too hard-headed and rationalistic to be taken in by the euphoria of the revolution at hand, or to allow that enthusiasm to affect the tenor of their reportage.
<P>
Far different is <I>The Road Ahead</I>, by Bill Gates, the prophet, if not the Messiah, of the information movement. His book can be read, if one is cynically inclined, as an extended sales pitch for Bill Gates. But Mr. Gates, despite his open and irrepressible enthusiasm for computing, has written a surprisingly candid and useful book. For Gates, the future of computing is the future of mankind, with technology becoming ever cheaper, more powerful, and more pervasive. As he expresses it in his chirping way:
<P>
<blockquote>
I've already said I'm an optimist, and I'm optimistic about the impact of the new technology. It will enhance leisure time and enrich culture by expanding the distribution of information. It will help relieve pressures on urban areas by enabling individuals to work from home or remote-site offices. It will relieve pressure on natural resources because increasing numbers of products will be able to take the form of bits rather than of manufactured goods.</blockquote>
<P>
What makes <I>The Road Ahead</I> so surprisingly useful is that it seems to be a fair, even-handed, and sober appraisal of the situation and very clearly explains complicated ideas to laymen like myself. The author simply lays out one concept after another -- the Internet, the information super-highway, high-definition television, and fiber optics -- with the result that those of us who are not techies finally understand all the terms that have been buzzing around in our heads for the past five years.
<P>
Naturally the information revolution is not without its dissenters. Few are as dourly pessimistic as Mark Slouka in <I>War of the Worlds</I>. This book seems to me to overreach somewhat by buying into the whole virtual-reality racket -- which I predict will remain decidedly ancillary to the information revolution  -- and by supposing that this and other developments will spell the end of reality as we know it. As for the Internet itself, it ``combines the worst of television -- its addictiveness, its passivity -- with the worst of on-line communication -- its self-conscious glorification of superfice [<I>sic</I>], its pop-culture chattiness, its pointless immediacy.''
<P>
Mark Dery's <I>Escape Velocity</I> in one sense goes even further. Dery seems at once to mock and to believe recent ``post-human'' speculations that advocate or predict a literal, physical merging of man and machine into a digitized, dehumanized whole. His book is a highly detailed discussion of cyberculture: that is, those new forms of art, literature, music, and attitude that have arisen at the corners of the information revolution. In his pages we encounter all the technopagans, virtual anarchists, cyber-novelists, performance artists, and cult film-makers for whom the information revolution is a virtual Bohemia joined in cyberspace to an equally virtual, if dystopian, Wild West.
<P>
<font size=+3>T</font><font size=+1>HE</font> fixation on the future that all these books exhibit to a remarkable degree has been a fixture of Western discourse for the last two hundred years: starting with Restif de la Bretonne, and extending through Jules Verne, H. G. Wells, Arthur C. Clarke, and William Gibson. The problem with books that seek, as these do, to discuss the future is that the future really is an undiscovered country from which imaginary travelers come back bearing more outlandish tales than Sir John Mandeville with his one-eyed anthropophagi. And because anyone's guess is as good as anyone else's, there seems to be an overwhelming impulse to exaggerate in the most shameless fashion imaginable, since it is the <I>deformation professionnelle</I> of all writers to want at all costs to have something to say.
<P>
And yet futurologists, even when they are more circumspect in their predictions, always make the same fundamental mistake, whether they view the future as a light-filled, pyramid-powered Eden or as a cybernetic Hell. Indeed, it is precisely the same mistake that many historians make when writing about the remoter past. And this mistake, it seems to me, is to suppose that to change the material circumstances of life is to alter fundamentally the sense of life itself. But life as it is lived is always pretty much the same, with the same protocols of boredom and excitement, the same glare of midday and gloom of eventide, the same petty ambitions, existential doubts, and immortal longings. We can certainly create the circumstances of greater freedom or greater oppression, but the range of possible variation in life itself, in the simple, irreducible sense of being alive, is far narrower than our chattering classes usually appreciate.
<P>
At the same time, it would be foolhardy and unfair to reason from this that change never happens. We have undergone great changes in this century; and though the Internet is still in its earliest infancy, it promises to grow up quickly. From a purely technological perspective, many users of the Internet already have far more efficient modems than I have. And through Moore's Law, which states that every 18 months computers double in power as their prices drop by half, we can expect that we all shall soon be getting better Internet service for less money, which means that fewer users will feel the need to punch their laptops.
<P>
Earlier in my life, as a callow adolescent, I was so disenchanted with the paltriness of industrial civilization -- this was in the late Seventies -- that I almost felt, foolish as it sounds, that I'd like to repeal the modern age entirely. As each day passes, however, I find myself strengthened in the hope that, with the arrival at long last of the information revolution, human society will become more enlightened, more various, more efficient, cleaner, less expensive, freer, and more fun than it has ever been before. One feels privileged to be alive and conscious at this moment in history and can hardly wait to see what humankind will come up with next.

<H2>Mr. Dole's Fate.</H2>
</center> 
<P>
<center>By John O'Sullivan</center>
<P>
<center><I>Mr. O'Sullivan is the editor of</I> National Review.</center>
<P>
<center>
<B><I>This article originally appeared in the London</I> New Statesman, <I>August 9, 1996</I></B></center> 
<P>
If one had to predict the eventual verdict on the Republicans gathering in Convention at San Diego next week, it would be suicide by timidity. The GOPa conservative party in a conservative country at a conservative historical momentis facing a major defeat in November at the hands of the most distrusted President since Richard Nixon. It has reached these straits not by embracing a Pat Buchanan or a radical right agenda but by allowing the party establishment to impose a decent but ideologically flavorless moderate, apparently out-of-touch with both party and country, as its standard-bearer. And it proposes to celebrate this event, fittingly enough, by staging a Convention from which all debate, controversy and indeed politics will have been ruthlessly expunged to make room for short pep-talks, video cartoons, advertising films, and cameo appearances by political celebrities (who are, by definition, not very celebrated).
<P>
The manufactured enthusiasm in the hall, however, will be balanced by the sincere defeatism outside it. Even Republican politicians and pundits sympathetic to the GOP believe that Dole is as good as defeated already. The only question to be decided is whether he will take the Republicans in House and Senate down with him. Some even speculate that the Republican party itself is heading for a post-election crack-up in which economic conservatives ("moderates" in NewClassSpeak) will finally split from the Religious Right. After which, in the approved media version, Buchananite "America Firsters," Perotistas, supply-siders, right-to-lifers, and all the other inmates of the Right Zoo will battle endlessly to succeed the GOP , allowing liberal Democrats to regain their rightful place as the government of the country. Liberaldom, in ruins only last year, will have been restored.
<P>
If this vision seems at all plausible, it is a sour tribute to the extent of the GOP's collapse since 1994. The problem is generally assumed to be Dole the campaigner. Michael Kelly of the New Yorker brilliantly pinned him down as a "nega-candidate" who campaigns in an almost post-modern style, reciting his texts as instructed by consultants but then subverting their message with ironic ad-libs. Of his own campaign slogan, he remarked vaguely (and inaccurately) in one interview: "A Better Plan, a man for a better Americawhatever that slogan is they're working on." But Mr. Kelly points out what others have missed: there is something attractive about this unwillingness to play by the rules of a stage-managed media game. Such an assertion of integrity, subtle but unmistakable, against the cynical tactics of modern campaigning (which Clinton has embraced in the person of super-consultant Dick Morris), might even be the only way Mr. Dole could win in November.
<P>
What is killing him is his carefully-thought-out and well-executed political strategy. He has been following Richard Nixon's advice that the way to win the White House is by veering rightwards in the primaries and centerwards in the general election. This leftright analysis was always better-suited to Europe than America, but it made some sense when Big Labor confronted Big Capital across a fledgling middle class, when most Americans lived either in cities or in rural areas, when lunch-pail issues dominated both people's lives and political debate, and when there were no culture wars or fears of Balkanization because almost everyone agreed on the virtues and opportunities that together constitute the American dream. It has been rendered virtually useless by the growth of suburban America (now home to half the electorate), the rise of the Sunbelt (51 per cent of the electoral college vote), the continuing decline of labor unions (representing only 15 per cent of the workforce), the growing importance of small business, entrepreneurship and highly skilled labor (over 60 per cent of the workforce is now classified as professional or white-collar), the emergence of single-issue politics from feminism to abortion (which has helped drive blue-collar Democrats into the GOP), the demographic transformation of America by immigration from a bi-racial nation to a multi-ethnic one (in which non-Hispanic whites are projected to be a minority by 2051), and the social fragmentation and cultural anxieties these trends have fostered. 
<P>
Where once two great political blocs fought over the small strip of middle ground separating them, today political parties have to assemble a majority anew in each election from among a scattering of regional, ethnic and social groups. Psephologist Patrick Reddy has identified seven such "tribes": Blacks, new minorities (Asians and Hispanics), white liberals, working-class or populist whites, Northern rural voters, suburbanites, and conservatives. The first three groups are in the Democrats' pocket; the last three lean to the GOP; and working-class whites in recent years have been moving sharply to the Right. But all of these groups need to be won over, or at least energized, by the powerful political appeals every four years. 
<P>
So far Bill Clinton has been wooing them far more effectively than the GOP. He shored up his Democratic base among minorities and liberals by portraying Republican cuts in projected Medicare spending (which he was also proposing, though to a lesser extent) as root-and-branch attacks on social entitlements. He simultaneously made inroads into the suburbanite vote by accepting a balanced budgetwittily balanced by spending cuts that would come into effect after the end of his second term. And he appealed to both suburbanites and populist whites by rhetorical and symbolic conservatism such as his call for school uniforms and teenage curfews. Shameless though they are, such tactics would certainly have blunted a GOP attackif one had been launched.
<P>
But Bob Dole, in addition to diving towards a mythical center, has been almost entirely reactive, concentrating on issues like abortion or problems like the "gender gap" where his party is divided or the Republicans are less trusted . To grasp the effect, imagine that John Major had spent 1992 talking about the NHS and never mentioning taxes. 
<P>
In fact, as Clinton's tactics reveal, new demographics mean new issues. Most Americans (about four and a half of Mr. Reddy's seven tribes) are prosperous and believe that government is too big and too intrusive. They don't want to see middle-class entitlements eradicated, but they look at the budget and sense that they will have to be at least pruned. And anyway, with the combination of federal, state and local taxes at 31.5 per cent of GDPlow by international standards but a peacetime high in the U.S.they feel the tax bite of government more. Here, at least, the Republicans have crafted a positive appeal to their constituencies. Dole's promise of a tax cut earlier this week serves as a proxy for all of these issues. The voters may not believe that as President he would actually cut taxes by $600 billion, but they will take his pledge as a sign that he will not raise them, that he may even cut them by some amount, and that therefore he will be forced to rein government back. 
<P>
The pressing political reality of 1996, however, is that for all the talk about "downsizing" and "economic anxiety", it is the issues of moral decline, social disorder and ethnic separatism that people are really worried about. As Michael Barone pointed out in <I>The American Enterprise</I>: "Violent crime is a greater threat to most Americans than short-term unemployment. Divorce is a far greater threat than job loss to the typical person's lifetime project of accumulating wealth . . ." Immigration, racial quotas, and multiculturalism arouse similar fears, and they have the added annoyance that, unlike crime, they are the deliberate effects of government policy. But the language in which people would once have expressed such anxieties has been discredited as "racist" or "nativist" and so they complain about them in the code of "economic anxiety."
<P>
Clinton, who allegedly blames his 1980 gubernatorial defeat on voter anger at the Mariel boatlift of Cuban immigrants, has been quick to sense the importance of these issues. His symbolic conservative gestures, the administration's theatrical "crackdown" on illegal border crossing, and the crime bill, itself largely symbolic, have defused some of them. But his signing of the welfare reform bill was as far as he could go in this direction without enraging his political base among liberals, blacks, and new minorities. Dole's obvious tactic therefore is emphasize those issues where the President simply cannot endorse conservative policies. A random sample might include: restricting the powers of the federal judiciary; extending school choice, via vouchers, to parochial schools; ending race and gender preferences; seriously enforcing laws against illegal immigration but also reducing legal immigration; supporting English as the official language and, more generally, opposing the wen of multiculturalism; and in general defending the concept of an inclusive "American" identity against the second coming of hyphenation. 
<P>
Most of these issues fall into neither of the two approved conservative categories: the "social conservatism" of the religious right and the libertarianism of the economic right. But what might best be called "cultural conservatism" gets support varying from 65 to 80 per cent in opinion polls. It arouses all three of the GOP tribes, plus the swing vote of populist whites, <I>and</I> Black Americans who face competition in the labor market from low-paid immigrants. In particular, it appeals to natural Republicans disaffected from the post-Reagan GOPsecularized Protestants, Northern WASPs, environmentalists, the Planned Parenthood crowd, and above all supporters of the Reform Party. A good example is Ross Perot's challenger, former Governor Dick Lamm, who is the author of tract entitled "The Immigration Time Bomb."
<P>
The GOP has dabbled in these waters with extreme nervousness. What restrains it is mainly that its post-civil-rights leadership is afraid of being seen as "racist" or "nativist" and "on the wrong side of history." This nervousness is rational. <I>The New York Times</I>, which noted in a single detached comment on a Democratic political ad that it was "unusual" for Democrats to use "inflammatory negative images of illegal immigrants," would still be shrieking "Willie Horton" if the GOP had done anything similar. There is also an ideological element in Republican reluctance. Leading Republicans like Jack Kemp and House Leader Dick Armey are uncomfortable with non-economic "hot button" issues like quotas, and intellectually committed to the view that immigration is an unqualified economic benefit. But they are resisting the majority of their party here. And it is a fair bet that, in any post-election struggle but especially one after a Dole defeat, the Republicans will move to add cultural conservatism to the religious and economic varieties. The signs are already there in Republican fund-raising letters which highlight quotas and immigration. 
<P>
But that will be too late for Mr. Dole. If he remains committed to a campaign of blandness and Nixon's advice, he will repeat his recent experience with two issues which have eighty per cent popular backing in virtually every poll but until recently a low political salience: increasing the minimum wage and making English the official language. Dole doubtless believed, following the conventional media wisdom, that the first is centrist, and the second "right," even "extreme." At any rate, hardly anything has been heard from him on official English since the primaries (indeed, he has been visibly edging away from the similar issue of racial and gender quotas). But he did not take long to move to the center to endorse a higher minimum wage once the Democrats had raised the issue. The net effect was to deny himself a popular issue with a powerful appeal both to his natural constituencies and to working-class whites, while helping to concentrate people's attention on the minimum wage where the Democrats enjoy a natural advantage with the public.
<P>
And this on the say-so of the late Richard Nixon. It is hard to believe that the Nixon of 1968, who crafted the new Republican majority with the southern strategy and appeals to law 'n' order, would have followed his own advice so blindly. 
<P>

	"WashingtonA National Clergy Council official said yesterday he had been detained by the Secret Service after admonishing President Clinton at a Christmas Eve service about his veto of a late-term-abortion ban. Rev. bob Schenck, general secretary to the council, said Secret Service agents blocked him from leaving the Washington National Cathedral for about 15 minutes and rifled his pockets for identification after he had confronted Clinton, who took communion at the late-night service with his wife and daughter. Rev. Schenck said that while he had been waiting to receive communion, he had leaned over the altar rail toward the President's nearby seat and quietly told Clinton: 'God will hold you to account, Mr. President.'

<P>
	"As required, West Point's invitation was sent to the Pentagon for approval by the secretary of defense. It was denied.
<P> 
	"Kenneth Bacon, the Pentagon spokesmannot Defense Secretary William J. Perrytook credit for the rejection. It was against regulations for the news media to accompany presidential candidates on military bases, he explained.

"Barbara Coe, a leading proponent of immigration reform in California, was threatened with legal action by the Justice Department, the Orange County Registrar's Office, and immigrant advocacy groups for 'intimidating voters' on Election Day.
<P> 
	"Her crime? Distributing fliers that proclaimed: 'Only citizens can vote! Violators will be prosecuted!'
<P>
	"Latino groups saw her campaign as a blatant, racist effort to intimidate legitimate voters, many of whom were new citizens casting their first votes. But Mrs. Coe, 62, a Huntington Beach grandmother, said she felt the fliers were necessary to combat voter fraud after hearing from Hispanic members of the California Coalition for Immigration Reform, which she founded and chairs. . . .
<P>
	"In her view, the problem is twofold. Many immigrants are unaware that noncitizens cannot vote. Others, however, 'know it's against the law, but they don't care. They know there's no prosecution. There are no safeguards,' she said. 
<P>
	"She already has obtained a list of 18 illegal immigrants who voted, compiled by a social worker on duty at a local polling place, she said. . . .
<P>
	"An official from the Justice Department's civil-rights division called and interviewed her for more than an hour about complaints they'd received about her fliers. . . .
<P>
	"Then the Orange County registrar of voters called. 'She was just ballistic,' Mrs. Coe recalled. 'She said, If I get one complaint of voter intimidation, I'm going to prosecute you to the full extent of the law.'
<p>
	"Likewise, California Secretary of State Bill Jones put her on notice that he would not tolerate any intimidation activities. 'Interfering with any individual's right to vote . . . is a crime,' he wrote." . . .

"We've seen Gary Aldrich's name on the best-seller list for several months now. Obviously he's raking in the dough with his book <I>Unlimited Access: An FBI Agent Inside the Clinton White House</I>. Think again. In fact, if the White House has its way, Mr. Aldrich may never see a dime in book royalties. 'I put all I own on the line to expose the criminal behavior and discredited security procedures in the Clinton White House,' Mr. Aldrich writes in a public appeal for donations. 'Now, my wife, Nina, and I and our three young children could lose everything. That's right, everything.' Attorney General Janet Reno, the former FBI agent writes, is deciding whether to prosecute him and confiscate the proceeds of his book, as the FBI recommends. . . .'Even now, the Clinton Administration lawyers are threatening to tie up all my assets and keep me in court for six years or more,' Mr. Aldrich writes in his letter. He says he's already spent nearly $100,000 in legal fees, exhausting his life savings fighting lawyers from the FBI, Justice Department, and White House."

	"You'll still have to buy them, but you can have them turned off.
<P>
	"This is the concession that the National highway Traffic Safety Administration proposed last month, in response to growing public alarm over the risks posed by air bags to children. To date, more than 30 children have been killed by air-bag deployment, many of them in low-speed accidents, and there is mounting evidence that these devices may endanger certain adults as well. The children's deaths are not merely a tragic side effect; air bags kill more kids under age 10 than they save."

<blockquote>
	"The Young America's Foundation of Herndon, Va., has published 'Comedy and tragedy,' a list of some of the courses available at the nation's institutions of higher learning. . . .
<P>
	"Not surprisingly, some of the course descriptions that standout, even in this amazing list, come from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, locally called Zoo Mass, where the education department offers three different courses on 'Special Issues in Education,' including two fairly recent concerns of the left, 'HandicapismDynamics of Handicapism on Personal and Institutional Levels,' 'HeterosexismDynamics of Heterosexism on Personal and Institutional Levels,' and third, that timeworn leftist obsession, 'ClassismDynamics of Classism on Personal and Institutional Levels.'
<P>
	"But from the University of California at Santa Cruz comes the scariest offering. A Big Brotheror should we say, Big Sister-minded education department presents students with Education 189: 'Monitoring Girls for Science and Math Equity: This six-credit, multiple-term course provides opportunities for women students from any discipline to mentor girls in local K12 classrooms. Mentors are trained to promote equity in science, math, and technology.' Gifted boys had better learn to keep quiet or face fierce reprimand."

<blockquote>







	



	"Florida prison doors will swing wide open for 445 murderers, sex offenders, kidnappers, and child abusers beginning today after a state Supreme Court restored time off for good behavior for the state's most violent offenders, prison officials said. Attorney General Bob Butterworth said he'll appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, but by then hundreds of inmates will have been released. Officials are trying to determine who will be freed immediately. The pending releases have generated protests from the public. 'We've done everything we can to keep them locked up,' Corrections Department spokeswoman Debbie Buchanan said. 'We don't have any choice. Our hands are tied.' "

The Senior Information Network

</center>
Welcome to the Senior Information Network. The premier high tech source in obtaining information about Senior Support Services across the United States. This is made possible in two ways:
<BR>
<BR>
<ul>
<li>
  For various information categories such as Housing, Rehabilitation, Banking,
etc. interesting articles will be selected to keep one up-to-date with senior information and issues.<BR>
<BR>
<li>
 Specific information can be obtained via Web Pages by selected cities. For example: If someone from Boston, MA wishes to find out about Independent Living Housing in Colorado Springs, CO, they will start with this Home Page, be able to select
Housing, then either select articles concerning  Housing, or go directly to Web Sites for Independent Housing facilities in Colorado Springs.
</ul>     
<P>
<P>So get started by selecting a category like Housing and keep coming back as we continue to fill in this network.<p>
Please register with the Senior Information Network by completing this <A HREF="guest.htm">form</A> for the <A HREF="guest.htm">Senior Information Network.</A>

Senior Banking now starts with free checking accounts, free checks and free notary service, as well as the old stand-by Trust Department. Now with changes in securities regulations, more banks have set up insurance and securities departments. Some banks also go the one step further for seniors and do things like seminars on topics of interest to seniors, luncheons and trips for seniors only.

<BR>
Adult Day Care Services are a very specialized field of senior services that has developed only recently.  The need for such services, however, has been around for a long time<p>
The mission of Adult Day Care Centers is to help caregivers to provide respite for their efforts in caring for an elderly person, usually a parent.<p>
This is generally accomplished by professionals who can provide services like medication monitoring and specialized activities during daytime hours to allow the caregiver time for work or just some time alone.

Obviously, Senior Health Care encompasses a wide range of services. So within this 
series of web pages we will attempt to categorize as conveniently as possible.
<P>
<P>One thing to remember is that seniors bring with them a health history. So this 
usually means that the health care service that listens best will provide the best service to the needs of the senior citizen.

Senior Housing now encompasses a wide spectrum of options. These include Independent Housing, Assisted Living, and Skilled Care. 
<BR><BR>
<fonts=5><b>Independent Housing</b><fonts=3><br>
Approximately 85% of seniors presently live in what is referred to as Independent Housing,
i.e. their own homes or apartments, and often with at least one relative. 
There are also many independent living facilities that are exclusively &quot;senior&quot; or 
55+, to provide an independent living setting that excludes younger families.
<BR><BR>
<fonts=5><b>
Assisted Living</b><fonts=3><br>
The next basic step in Senior Housing is called Assisted Living. These 
are facilities designed to provide services for their residents such as 
medication monitoring, transportation and meal preparation because these residents 
need closer supervision than that provided in independent living situations, but 
they don't require 24-hour skilled nursing care.
<BR><BR>
<fonts=5><b>
Skilled or Long Term Care</b><fonts=3><br>
The third basic category of senior living is called Skilled Care or Long 
Term Care. Long term is perhaps a misnomer because most of these facilities 
are tuned into rehabilitation programs nowadays. We used to call them 
nursing homes, but now they are better named as Skilled Care Facilities.
<BR><BR>
<fonts=5><b>
Alzheimer's Care</b><fonts=3><br>
To these basic categories we have added Alzheimers Care because of it's specialized importance in Senior Housing continuum of care.

<BR>

Senior Financial Planning encompasses a number of things: insurance programs. mutual funds, 401K and other IRA plans, living trusts, reverse mortgages, etc.  
<P>
<P>This is one of those areas that needs plenty of pre-planning, and then plenty of reevaluation. And, it's not usually a do-it-yourself project! Fortunately, there is plenty of good help available.
<P>
<P>But, we will add here, look before you leap. There are also guys out there who have targeted seniors as easy. Any questions? Call the local Better Business Bureau before you hand over your hard-earned savings.

Insurance for seniors can cover a whole range and combination of topics, so we've decided to make <i>Senior Insurance</i> a category of itself even though insurance planning and financial planning go hand-in hand. Senior Insurance would include such areas as Medicaid, Supplemental (Medigap) Insurance, Annuities and Long Term Care Insurance.<p>
There are a lot of people who would like to talk to you about insurance, so be careful and do a lot of listening for second opinions before signing your name and writing your check.

Senior Rehabilitation starts with the basic programs of Physical Therapy, Occupational Therapy and Speech Therapy. But actually there are many variations of specialties within these general headings. For example: Head Injury Care is a special subject, Wound Care is a specialized field, etc.
<P>

</center>
<P>This page is designed to get you started towards the individual web pages where each rehabilitation organization or facility can outline how it best fits into your need program. From here you can read or print articles concerned with rehabilitation and/or go explore rehabilitation resources by city.

This page is formatted differently than others in the Senior Information Network. We receive a lot of good information from Social Security and thought that no senior resource network would be complete without presenting articles on this subject. So feel free to browse and down load those of interest, but you'll note that there wont be any web pages for suppliers of Social Security in each community, obviously. Further help can be obtained from your local Social Security office, or by dialing 1-800-772-1213. (Be patient, though!)

<P>Pueblo Colorado, the Steel city, has re-established itself as a prosperous Colorado community. It is located about an hour-and-a-half south of Denver, off I-25 and along the Arkansas River. A few years ago, Pueblo was voted one of the best places to live in the United States.
<p>
The number one attraction is the Pueblo Reservoir, where summer visitors can enjoy fishing, camping,  hiking, and swimming. The town is also the host of the Colorado State Fair, where each August since 1872 Coloradans have come to the fairgrounds.

<P>Pueblo Colorado, the Steel city, has re-established itself as a prosperous Colorado community. It is located about an hour-and-a-half south of Denver, off I-25 and along the Arkansas River. A few years ago, Pueblo was voted one of the best places to live in the United States.
<p>
The number one attraction is the Pueblo Reservoir, where summer visitors can enjoy fishing, camping,  hiking, and swimming. The town is also the host of the Colorado State Fair, where each August since 1872 Coloradans have come to the fairgrounds.

<P>Pueblo Colorado, the Steel city, has re-established itself as a prosperous Colorado community. It is located about an hour-and-a-half south of Denver, off I-25 and along the Arkansas River. A few years ago, Pueblo was voted one of the best places to live in the United States.
<p>
The number one attraction is the Pueblo Reservoir, where summer visitors can enjoy fishing, camping,  hiking, and swimming. The town is also the host of the Colorado State Fair, where each August since 1872 Coloradans have come to the fairgrounds.

<h1>Converting AOL to use Netscape Browser</h1>
The following are America Online's instructions for converting
your AOL browser to Netscape. Directions are provided for both Windows 3.1 users
and Windows 95 users.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 1 -->
<H2>Windows 3.1 Users</H2>
<p>
Now Windows users can use Netscape Navigator, the world's most popular way to
navigate the Internet, with their America Online account! Any Internet
browser enables you to browse the World Wide Web. But only Netscape Navigator
allows you to see more of the Internet, more easily.
<p>
The following step-by-step instructions take you through the installation
process in about ten minutes, after downloading the necessary files. It's
very important that you follow these instructions EXACTLY, and we strongly
recommend that you print them out (by selecting FILE, PRINT) or copy them
into your word processor (by highlighting the text and selecting EDIT, COPY)
for easy access.
<p>
STEP 1 - MAKE SURE YOU'RE USING AOL VERSION 2.5
<p>
Ensure that you are using Version 2.5 of the America Online software in
Windows 3.1. To check, select HELP from the toolbar at the top of the screen,
then click on ABOUT AMERICA ONLINE. If the version number is less than 2.5,
you need to upgrade your software by selecting GO TO, KEYWORD, and typing
UPGRADE.
<p>
STEP 2 - MAKE SURE YOU'RE CONNECTING VIA A MODEM
<p>
Ensure that you're accessing AOL with a modem, and NOT through a network
TCP/IP connection. If you're connecting to AOL from a network environment,
STOP HERE. These instructions are only for use with a dial-up, modem
connection to AOL.
<p>
STEP 3 - CHECK FOR EXISTING VERSIONS OF WINSOCK.DLL
<p>
Search for any file on your system called WINSOCK.DLL. In File Manager select
the FILE menu, choose SEARCH. In the dialog-box on the SEARCH FOR line, type:
winsock.dll. In the START FROM line type "C:\", without the quotation marks.
Be sure to include the colon and backslash after the "C". Make sure the box
next to "SEARCH ALL SUBDIRECTORIES" is marked, then click on OK.
<p>
If you find a file called WINSOCK.DLL or winsock.dll, you probably have other
online application(s) which require it. Installing another WINSOCK.DLL may
cause these applications not to work. We recommend you STOP here and consult
your software manuals before continuing. If you choose to continue with the
installation, and later discover that an application works incorrectly or not
at all, you will need to deinstall this version of WINSOCK.DLL and reinstall
the other one. This process can be tricky; therefore if you find other
versions of WINSOCK.DLL and are unsure about your abilities to reconstruct
the original configuration in case of problems, STOP HERE.
<p>
STEP 4 - BACK UP EXISTING VERSIONS OF WINSOCK.DLL
<p>
If you found previously existing versions of WINSOCK.DLL and have decided to
proceed anyway, first make a backup copy of the other versions on your
system.
<p>
You will need to close the Search Results window and insert a blank floppy
disk into your floppy disk drive before continuing the backup. Move any
existing versions of WINSOCK.DLL that you found in step 3 to a floppy disk,
and note the directory in which each was found. The easiest way to note the
directories is to recreate them on the floppy disk. In File Manager you can
open a window for the floppy drive and use FILE, CREATE DIRECTORY to create a
directory on the floppy disk with the same name as the directory on your hard
disk, then FILE, MOVE or drag and drop to move the older version of
WINSOCK.DLL to the floppy. If you are unsure how to do this, consult your
Windows documentation. Once you've copied the files to the floppy, remove
them from your hard drive.
<p>
Alternatively, you can rename the copies of WINSOCK.DLL that already exist on
your hard drive. Simply use FILE, RENAME in File Manager to change the .DLL
extension to your initials (as long as they aren't DLL!) or to .SAV.
<p>
Be sure that NO copies of ANY file named WINSOCK.DLL remain on your hard
drive.
<p>
STEP 5 - DOWNLOAD WINSOCK.DLL
<p>
Switch back to AOL and the Netscape menu. Double click on DOWNLOAD
WINSOCK.DLL, then click on DOWNLOAD NOW.
<p>
Save the file in your WINDOWS directory by selecting C:\WINDOWS in the
DOWNLOAD MANAGER box that appears.
<p>
When you have finished downloading the file, click on CANCEL to return to the
Netscape menu.
<p>
STEP 6 - DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL NETSCAPE NAVIGATOR
<p>
You should DOWNLOAD N16E20.EXE INTO AN EMPTY DIRECTORY, or move it to an
empty directory after downloading. To create an empty directory, switch to
File Manager. From the menu bar select FILE, then CREATE DIRECTORY, then type
ANY NAME OTHER THAN "NETSCAPE" for your new directory.
<p>
Now switch back to the Netscape menu on AOL. Double click on DOWNLOAD
NETSCAPE NAVIGATOR! and click DOWNLOAD NOW.
<p>
In the Download Manager box, change to the empty directory you just created
and click on OK. When you have finished downloading N16E20.EXE, click on
CANCEL to return to the Netscape menu.
<p>
After you have downloaded N16E20.EXE and moved it to an empty directory,
decompress it by double-clicking on it in File Manager. The file will expand
to many files. After the file has decompressed and you are returned to File
Manager, press F5 to refresh the screen and display all the files.
<p>
Once the file has decompressed, double-click on the file SETUP.EXE and follow
the installation instructions. 
<p>
STEP 7 - REBOOT, RESTART WINDOWS AND LOG ON TO AOL
<p>
Exit AOL and any other open programs, exit Windows, reboot your computer by
pressing CTRL, ALT and DELETE simultaneously, and then restart Windows if it
does not start automatically. Log onto AOL as you normally do.
<p>
STEP 8 - START NETSCAPE NAVIGATOR
<p>
While you are logged on to AOL, switch over to your desktop and start
Netscape Navigator by double-clicking on its icon. Success! You're now using
Netscape Navigator with your AOL connection!
<p>
STEP 9 - HAPPY SURFING!
<p>
We hope you enjoy the world's most popular World Wide Web browser. Be sure to
stop by PC World Online on the WWW at http://www.pcworld.com!
<p>
If you experience any problems in running Netscape Navigator or any other
online applications, you can undo this installation and return to your
original configuration by removing the new WINSOCK.DLL and replacing it with
the previous versions you backed up on the floppy disk or renamed.
<p>
<h2>Windows 95 Users</H2>
<p>
Now Windows 95 users can use Netscape Navigator, the world's most popular way
to navigate the Internet, with their America Online account! Any Internet
browser enables you to browse the World Wide Web. But only Netscape Navigator
allows you to see more of the Internet, more easily.
<p>
The following step-by-step instructions take you through the installation
process in about ten minutes, after downloading the necessary files. It's
very important that you follow these instructions EXACTLY, and we strongly
recommend that you print them out (by selecting FILE, PRINT) or copy them
into your word processor (by highlighting the text and selecting EDIT, COPY)
for easy access.
<p>
STEP 1 - MAKE SURE YOU'RE USING AOL VERSION 2.5
<p>
Ensure that you are using Version 2.5 of the America Online software in
Windows 95. To check, select HELP from the toolbar at the top of the screen,
then click on ABOUT AMERICA ONLINE. If the version number is less than 2.5,
you need to upgrade your software by selecting GO TO, KEYWORD, and typing
UPGRADE.
<p>
STEP 2 - MAKE SURE YOU'RE CONNECTING VIA A MODEM 
<p>
Ensure that you're accessing AOL with a modem, and NOT through a network
TCP/IP connection. If you're connecting to AOL from a network environment,
STOP HERE. These instructions are only for use with a dial-up, modem
connection to AOL.
<p>
STEP 3 - CHECK FOR EXISTING VERSIONS OF WINSOCK.DLL
<p>
Search for any file on your system called WINSOCK.DLL. To do this, click on
the Windows 95 START button, select (C) DRIVE; at the menu bar of your C:
DRIVE, select VIEW, then OPTIONS, then the VIEW tab and select the "Show all
files" option. Click on APPLY, then CANCEL. Now click on the Windows 95 START
button again, select FIND, and click on FILES OR FOLDERS. In the NAMED
dialog-box type WINSOCK.DLL. In the LOOK IN dialog-box select (C:). Make sure
the INCLUDE SUBFOLDERS box is checked and click on FIND NOW.
<p>
If you find a file called WINSOCK.DLL or winsock.dll, you probably have other
online application(s) which require it. Installing another WINSOCK.DLL may
cause these applications not to work. We recommend you STOP here and consult
your software manuals before continuing. If you choose to continue with the
installation, and later discover that an application works incorrectly or not
at all, you will need to deinstall this version of WINSOCK.DLL and reinstall
the other one. This process can be tricky; therefore if you find other
versions of WINSOCK.DLL and are unsure about your abilities to reconstruct
the original configuration in case of problems, STOP HERE.
<p>
STEP 4 - BACK UP EXISTING VERSIONS OF WINSOCK.DLL
<p>
If you found previously existing versions of WINSOCK.DLL and have decided to
proceed anyway, first make a backup copy of the other versions on your
system.
<p>
Copy any existing versions of WINSOCK.DLL that you found in step 3 to a
floppy disk. This can be done easily in the Find window by highlighting each
file in turn and using FILE, SEND TO, FLOPPY. If you found more than one
WINSOCK.DLL, you will need to create subfolders on the floppy drive to
differentiate the various versions. You can do this in MY COMPUTER by
clicking on the floppy drive icon and selecting FILE, NEW, FOLDER to create
the subfolders on the floppy drive. Once you've copied the files to the
floppy, remove them from your hard drive. If you receive a message saying
that Windows is using the file and it cannot be removed, you will have to
overwrite the older WINSOCK.DLL with the new version. This may cause
application(s) already on your system to work incorrectly or not at all. Be
sure you have a backup copy of the existing WINSOCK.DLL!
<p>
STEP 5 - DOWNLOAD WINSOCK.DLL
<p>
Switch back to AOL and the Netscape menu. Double click on DOWNLOAD
WINSOCK.DLL, then click on DOWNLOAD NOW. Save the file in your WINDOWS
subfolder by selecting C:\WINDOWS in the DOWNLOAD MANAGER box that appears.
<p>
When you have finished downloading the file, click on CANCEL to return to the
Netscape menu.
<p>
STEP 6 - DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL NETSCAPE NAVIGATOR
<p>
Double click on DOWNLOAD NETSCAPE NAVIGATOR! and click DOWNLOAD NOW. Ideally
you should download this file into an empty subfolder, or move it to an empty
subfolder after downloading. Make a note of the subfolder into which you
downloaded the file. When you have finished downloading the file, click on
CANCEL to return to the Netscape menu.
<p>
After you have downloaded N16E20.EXE and moved it to an empty subfolder,
decompress it by double-clicking on it in WINDOWS 95 EXPLORER or MY COMPUTER.
The file will expand to many files. When the decompression window title
changes to "FINISHED - N16E20", close the window by clicking on the X button
in the upper right hand corner.
<p>
Once the file has decompressed, double-click on the file SETUP.EXE and follow
the installation instructions.
<p>
STEP 7 - REBOOT, RESTART WINDOWS AND LOG ON TO AOL
<p>
Exit AOL and any other open programs. Use the SHUT DOWN menu to restart your
computer. Log onto AOL as you normally do.
<p>
STEP 8 - START NETSCAPE NAVIGATOR
<p>
While you are logged onto AOL, minimize its screen and go back to your
desktop. Start Netscape Navigator by double-clicking on its shortcut. If you
chose the default options during installation, you will find the shortcut on
your START menu under PROGRAMS, NETSCAPE. Success! You're now using Netscape
Navigator with your AOL connection!
<p>
STEP 9 - HAPPY SURFING!
<p>
We hope you enjoy the world's most popular World Wide Web browser. Be sure to
stop by PC World Online on the WWW at http://www.pcworld.com!
<p>
If you experience any problems in running Netscape Navigator or any other
online applications, you can undo this installation and return to your
original configuration by removing the new WINSOCK.DLL and replacing it with
the previous versions you backed up on the floppy disk.

<h1>Home medical devices a draw for scam artists</h1>
<p>By Mary Beth Franklin 
<br>Maturity News Service
<P>If you are among the millions of elderly or disabled Americans who 
require special medical equipment in your home for health reasons, Medicare may 
cover most of the cost.
<P>But be careful. There are numerous scams involving home medical 
equipment suppliers that cost the government billions each year in Medicare fraud 
and might leave you stuck with equipment you don't want or bills you didn't expect.
<P>Generally, Medicare helps pay for equipment that is medically 
necessary, appropriate for use in your home, and prescribed by a doctor. Oxygen 
equipment, wheelchairs, chairs equipped with special lift devices, and hospital beds 
are examples of devices that may be covered.
<P>But some types of equipment are not considered medically necessary 
and therefore are not covered because they are equally useful to people who are 
not sick or injured.
<P>Your personal doctor is usually the one to decide what medical 
equipment you need in your home. Either the doctor or a hospital discharge planner can 
refer you to one or more suppliers who can meet your medical equipment needs.
<P>If the supplier &quot;takes assignment,&quot; which means accepting the 
Medicare-approved amount as payment in full, Medicare will pay 80 percent of the 
approved cost of the equipment and you pay the remaining 20 percent. The 
reimbursement rules apply to both rentals and purchases.
<P>If a supplier does not take assignment, Medicare will still pay the same 
80 percent of the approved cost and you will be responsible for the difference 
between what Medicare pays and what the supplier charges.
<P>To save money, always try to find a supplier that accepts medicare 
assignment.
<P>If you have a private medigap policy that covers medical equipment in 
your home, your insurance will cover the 20 percent of the cost that Medicare does 
not pay.
<P>While there are plenty of reputable and reliable medical equipment 
suppliers, there are also those in the business of defrauding the Medicare 
system, whether by charging for equipment that's never delivered or by selling 
devises that aren't medially necessary.
<P>&quot;The plethora of scams out there makes the whole program vulnerable,&quot; 
said Judy Berek, a senior adviser at the Health Care Financing Administration, 
the agency that administers Medicare. &quot;We are all paying for it,&quot; she added. &quot;If we 
let scam artists destroy our program, we wont have a program or we'll have to 
give up other things.&quot;
<P>Altogether, the General Accounting Office estimates that Medicare 
fraud cost the government $18 billion last year - about 10 percent of the cost of 
the entire program.
<P>Unscrupulous suppliers trying to bilk the Medicare system often offer 
Medicare beneficiaries free medical equipment whether they need it or not.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 -->

<P>&quot;If someone offers you free medical equipment, be leery,&quot; warns 
Michele Kimball, a legislative associate with the American Association of Retired 
Persons who specializes in health care fraud. &quot;Only your doctor can prescribe 
medically necessary equipment.&quot;
<P>Similarly, if a medical equipment supplier offers to waive the 20 
percent Medicare co-payment, don't bite. It's illegal and should be reported to 
your Medicare carrier whose name and telephone number is listed on your 
Medicare statements.
<P>Watch out for telephone solicitors or door-to-door salesmen who tell you 
that you are entitled to certain medical equipment under the Medicare program at 
no cost to you.
<P>No medical equipment is free. You may find yourself with equipment 
that Medicare wont pay for and a supplier who wont let you return the item. 
You could get stuck with a bill you didn't expect.
<P>Also beware of suppliers who try to convince you that you need a 
more elaborate device than your doctor prescribed.
<P>For example, if your doctor says you need a manual wheelchair and 
your supplier persuades you to accept a souped-up electric one, Medicare will 
cover only 80 percent of the cost of the prescribed version. You will be responsible 
for the difference.
<P>One final warning, &quot;Never, ever, under any circumstances give your 
Medicare number out to someone you don't know,&quot; advises Kimball.
<P>She suggests that Medicare recipients safeguard their identification 
number just as they would a credit card number. Otherwise, a scam artist can use 
that number to commit costly fraud that can ultimately undermine the 
Medicare program.
<P>The Department of Health and Human Services has established a national 
tip line for reporting Medicare and Medicaid fraud. The number is (800) 
HHS-TIPS, or (800) 447-8477. You can call Monday through Friday, 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. 
EST. You do not have to give your name.
<P>You can also write to the Office of Inspector General, U.S. Department 
of Health and Human Services, HHS-TIPS, Hot Line, P.O. Box 23489, 
Washington, D.C.  20026.

<h1>Unscrupulous groups target lonely, dying</h1>
<P>By Joan McQueeney Mitric
<BR>Maturity News Service
<P>Anna Tucker was 83 and a frail resident of a nursing home in Phoenix 
when proselytizers began daily visits to her bedside.
<P>"My grandmother told me this woman was preaching at her without 
being invited, leaving literature she didn't want and asking her to redraw her will," 
said Rick Ross, now a professional counselor near Scottsdale, AZ.
<P>Ross intervened before his grandmother gave money away, and the 
home drafted guidelines to screen visitors.
<P>Nursing home administrators, chaplains, elder law attorneys, cult 
specialists and aging experts are urging facilities to establish such guidelines, warning 
that the ailing, lonely or dying are particularly vulnerable to unscrupulous 
visitors interested in their money.
<P>Experts stress that legitimate spiritual groups that counsel the elderly 
offer an immeasurable service to people grappling with the profound spiritual 
dilemmas surrounding death. But they agree that safeguards are needed in 
nursing facilities, veterans' hospitals or at the elders' own homes.
<P>Groups may read newspaper obituaries to find recent widows and then 
knock on their doors with a friendly offer to run errands. Others go to 
mainstream churches to seek our frail people with the idea of gaining their confidence.
<P>These groups "play on the loneliness and neglect an older person may 
be feeling," said Margaret Thaler Singer, a retired professor of clinical psychology 
at the University of California at Berkeley who has specialized in the study of cults.
<P>In extreme cases, Singer said, a group may try to separate an elder from 
her family, physically or psychologically.
<P>"They say things like, `Your daughter hasn't called for a month. She 
doesn't care about you. Why do you care what she thinks?' " Once under the influence of such a person, older people may sign away their homes or contribute large 
sums to religious groups, cults or impersonators, Singer said.
<P>Some nursing homes are familiar with the problem and have put 
safeguards in place.
<P>After seeing a few cases, the Rev. Daniel Kratz, a United Church of 
Christ minister who is director of chaplains for Manor Health Care Corp., helped set 
up visitor guidelines for 160-plus nursing homes the company owns. 
<P>Without clearance procedures, Kratz said "cultlike people can come in 
and put on a seemingly nice religious service for the residents. But their motive is 
to find out who has money and to cultivate that individual later by going to 
their private rooms."
<P>He said "a lonely older person is especially vulnerable as he 
approaches death and is thinking more and more about religious issues." But Kratz 
said residents have a "right to refuse to see anyone, just like they would at home."
<P>Wes Toepper, a Lutheran minister and director of pastoral care at the 
District of Columbia's 800-bed nursing facility, has seen "every kind of visitation 
from every kind of religious group. Some of the most abusive people would be 
ranting about hell-fire and damnation to people who had no interest in it."

<P>Toepper, who said he "came close to forcibly removing the most 
insistent," believes he must "protect the rights of the nonreligious person just as 
vigorously as I serve those who do want religious visits," especially at a federal facility. 
"It's as much a privacy issue as a religious one," he said.
<P>Though not aware of anyone at his facility who was defrauded of 
money, Toepper was concerned enough to put in a security system to screen visitors. 
He said county homes and veterans' hospitals may be more easily misled by 
volunteer visitors. "They are desperate for help and have much less time to weed 
out the rotten apples," he said.
<P>Chaplain Janette Silva at Manor Health Care's facility in Wheaton, MD 
said she tries to do a background check on "any volunteers who want to visit, work 
or pray with the residents."
<P>Florida group counselor Carol Giambalvo said some groups go to nursing homes or hospitals to recruit old patients with the "express purpose of getting them to revamp their wills."
<P>As a member of a fringe group herself years ago, Giambalvo said, she 
and other members were often sent into nursing homes to befriend unsuspecting elderly. Arm-twisting for donations began after they had gotten a patient interested, she said.
<P>"We had a holiday project that sent members into hospitals and nursing homes with these little gifts," Giambalvo said. "The patients were extremely happy with the visits and the special attention. We sang Christmas carols and spread cheer. But our real goal was to get them to join."
<P>Professionals like Margaret Singer say the children of elderly people must reconnect with their parents if they want to protect them from seemingly friendly strangers with hidden agendas.
<P>"Start visiting," she urged. "Call them more than once a month. If you can't be there regularly, try to set up a network of trusted friends who can fill in and keep them safe."
<P>Rick Ross said family members should be particularly alert if older 
relatives seem to be withdrawing, lose weight or begin to sound illogical.
<P>"Check out their new associates or any new groups they've joined - from book clubs to Bible seminars to New Age health clubs - to make sure they are legitimate," Ross said.
<P>Singer said adult children often get the first tip-off that something is amiss when they do Mom or Dad's finances and realize big checks are going to a group that is not their parents' regular church or a recognizable charity.
<P>Singer suggests children ask their parents' regular synagogue or church if it can supply rides to services and to inquire about other activities geared to older audiences.

<h1>Banks can help fight fraud against seniors</H1>
<p>By Mary Beth Franklin
<br>Maturity News Service
<p>Older people have long been a target of con artists. Yet a lesser known but perhaps far more prevalent problem is beginning to gain attention - fleecing of the elderly by family members or care givers.
<p>Seniors being defrauded by people they trust "is a hidden problem that is growing rapidly as the nation's population ages," said Jan Walsh, a Certified Financial Planner who specializes in retirement planning at the National Endowment for Financial Education in Denver.
<p>The National Center for Elder Abuse in Washington, D.C., reports that financial exploitation accounts for about 12 percent of all reported elder abuse cases. And that's just the tip of the iceberg, experts say, since abuse cases often go unreported because the victims are ashamed or embarrassed. Sadly, the abuser is often a close relative.
<p>When victims don't report a crime, it can be hard to detect. In many cases of fraud against the elderly, banks are in a unique position to spot the problem. For that reason, in some states, banks are enlisting in the fight to protect older customers against fraud or theft.
<p>In a model project in Massachusetts, for example, the state office of elder affairs, together with the state attorney general and office of consumer affairs, is teaching bank employees how to recognize and report financial exploitation of elderly customers.
<p>The state secretary of elder affairs, Franklin P. Ollivierre, said the Massachusetts plan was already widely used throughout the state and had been replicated on a smaller scale in New York, Kentucky, California and Washington. He hopes the Bank Reporting Project eventually will be used nationwide. 
<p>In the program, bank employees are taught to look out for banking activity that is inconsistent with a customer's usual habits. For example, warning signals should go up when there are large withdrawals from a previously inactive account or withdrawals or transfers from a recently opened joint account. 
<p>Suspicious signatures on checks or documents such as credit card applications should also serve as a red flag to bank employees.
<p>When a senior's account show frequent withdrawals from automatic teller machines (ATMs), especially if the person is physically frail and has not previously used an ATM, that's another sign that someone should investigate.
<p>The Bank Reporting Project cautions bank employees to be on the lookout for elderly customers accompanied by another person who seems to coerce them into making withdrawals or who does not allow them to speak for themselves.
<p>Elderly customers who appear nervous, give implausible explanations of why they need the money or seem confused about missing funds may be victims of fraud, theft or extortion.
<p>Financial crimes against the elderly can take many forms.
<p>Title to a home or other assets may be transferred to the abuser and then sold; funds from checking, savings or investment accounts may be withdrawn without authorization; wills may be changed as a result of intimidation. Loans may be taken out and the funds given to the abuser, or benefit checks from pensions or Social Security may be signed over to the abuser who cashes them.
<p>"Often the abuser is someone who becomes the agent of an elderly person through a power of attorney and then transfers assets for his or her personal use," said planner Jan Walsh, who serves as an adviser to the National Council on Aging.
<p>To reduce the risk of financial abuse, Walsh suggests these precautions:
<p><li> Limit powers of attorney. A power of attorney - a legal document authorizing a person to perform certain legal or financial actions on someone else's behalf - is often used to steal a person's financial assets.
Before making out a power of attorney, make sure the agent is someone who can be trusted. Limit the agent's authority and consider requiring an annual report of income and expenses to an outside party such as a lawyer or financial planner.
<p><li> Use direct deposit for Social Security or other benefit checks. This reduces the opportunity for theft, though funds can still be at risk if the abuser is a joint owner of the account.
<p><li> Use automatic bill paying. Routine bills can be automatically paid for elders from a checking or savings account. Or a bill-paying service can be hired.
<p><li> Communicate with the bank. Banks are often the first to see questionable financial activity and can alert the elder or a relative to any suspicious activity on an account.
<p><li> Check care giversreferences carefully. Anyone hired to provide care should be thoroughly screened.
<p><li> Be wary of a care giver who tries to isolate an older person. It is tougher to commit fraud when the prospective victim is in regular touch with friends and family members.
</ul
"By being aware of the signs of financial abuse and taking specific actions," Walsh said, "the risks can be dramatically reduced or even prevented."
If you think someone has been the victim of financial abuse, you can contact a local adult protective service organization (usually located within a state's human service agency), the local police or district attorney's office, or a state department of aging.

<h1>Gloria Francis helps seniors and her bank</h1>
<img border=0 width=200 height=235
SRC="../graphics/gfranp1.jpg" ALIGN="right"><BR>
<p>When someone talks about senior banking in Colorado Springs, the first person to come to mind is Gloria Francis. For almost twenty years her name has been synonymous with seniors, not only in banking, but in social issues as well.
<p>In 1975 she approached the then president of Central Bank, who she knew, and said "if you'll hire me, I'll do the best job that I can." He took the chance on this homemaker friend with no experience and the rest, as they say, became history. At that time seniors represented 10-15% of the bank's accounts and in 1994 that group had grown to 60-65%.
<p>"I got the idea to start some programs," says Gloria, " and the first one became Fun and Friends."  Seventeen years later Fun and Friends has become a group of about 300 people who gather at The Acacia, a downtown senior center in Colorado Springs, every last Sunday of the month for dances, entertainment and maybe a brief speaker. 
<p>Reflecting back, Gloria commented, "In this business we think that clothing, shelter and food are most important, but companionship rates up there pretty high. Many seniors suffer loneliness -some have lost spouses, some have come from other states to join sons or daughters and found that they lead busy lives." So Gloria began to bring these seniors together.
<p>"There was really something missing from Fun and Friends and that was minority participation, so I started the Historical Society, a misnomer because they don't really study history. Most of them are minority seniors and we have dinner and a social at the Senior Center every 2 or 3 months. Usually about 200 people show up for these."
<p>As the years went by other senior activities were also initiated by Gloria, such as:
<ul>
<p><li> A radio program on KWYD called "Senior Report" which airs four times a day.
<p><li> A radio call-in show "which is lots of fun" with all kinds of guests from Senator Campbell to Congressman Hefley to Governor Romer, "plus some people without big titles, but big hearts."
<p><li> A Christmas Dinner For Seniors given every first Sunday in December. 
<p><li> A Senior Luncheon each month at the Colorado National Bank on East Pikes Peak Avenue in Colorado Springs. About 120 attend this each month, but up to 300 have arrived for lunch.
<p><li> Numerous Board seats-Area Agency on Aging, Golden Circle Nutrition, Rocky Mountain SER, N.A.A.C.P. and Urban League.
</ul>
<p>"I'm really lucky because the bank sponsors a lot of my activities. They cosponsor a luncheon with the Urban League each month at Hillside Community Center, they sponsor the Senior Luncheons, they sponsor 'Fun and Friends', they sponsor coffees and seminars, functions at nursing homes and retirement residences, so the bank is very community-minded and they encourage me to participate in all of these activities
<p>As for the future, "According to demographics, the senior population is the fastest growing population in the country. I'm sure more and more banks are going to be concentrating on senior accounts. They should be doing more programming to encourage more seniors to come to their banks."
<p>Gloria also sees her bank, Colorado National Bank, continuing to develop more programs and expanding current ones now that there are more resources to draw upon with the merging and consolidating of the banks.
<p>And Gloria sees herself continuing to help others because "I love them. I've worked so closely with them over the years and I do what I can because these are people who need people."

<h1>What does your bank account cost? 
<BR>It pays to check.</h1>

<p>By Mary Beth Franklin
<BR>Maturity News Service
<p>The recent announcement by the First National Bank of Chicago that it would charge its banking customers $3 every time they used the services of a teller triggered angry reactions from consumers around the country.
<p>But the Chicago bank is not alone in raising service fees in order to direct customers toward less-expensive automated services. Many banks have been quietly raising their fees and instituting new ones for several years now.
<p>A recent study by the U.S. Public Interest Research Group (PIRG) found that between 1993 and 1995, consumer bank fees rose 10 percent or more, about twice the rate of inflation. During the same period, commercial bank profits broke new records, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
<p>In some cases, those interest-bearing checking accounts where you stash your cash for safekeeping and convenience could actually be costing you money in the long run after the annual fees and service charges are deducted.If you haven't done so lately, it may be time to review your bank's services and costs and see if they are really in your best interest. If they're not, shop around for a bank that offers you a better deal. 
<p>The PIRG study found that the annual cost of maintaining an interest-bearing checking account (also known as a NOW account) grew 11 percent from 1993 to $219 in 1995. Inflation during the same period averaged 5.5 percent.
<p>The annual cost of maintaining a regular checking account grew by 10 percent to $202 over the same period. Average monthly balance requirements to avoid regular checking fees rose 30 percent to $1,242 in 1995.
<p>The study concluded that banks in Maryland, Florida, the District of Columbia, North Carolina and Illinois imposed some of the highest fees in the country. Some of the lowest-cost banks were located in Hawaii, Idaho, New Mexico, Maine and Washington, according to the report.
<p>"We recommend that consumers shop around," said Janice Shields, a PIRG consultant and coauthor of the report. "And look around for a bank that offers tied accounts, "which means if you keep a certain minimum balance in your savings account, you may not have to pay fees on your checking account."
<p>Shields noted that shopping around is particularly important to certificate-of-deposit investors, since interest rates on CDs are one of the most competitive areas of the banking industry.
Here are some other tips for consumers to keep in mind:
<ul>
<br><li>
 Pay attention. Banks do not announce new fees or fee hikes in red letters. Often it comes in fine print stuck in with your bank statement. Take the time to read it.
For example, bounced check charges now average $20, up from $15 a few years ago. And two-thirds of the nation's banks charge customers for innocently depositing someone else's bad check. This particularly annoying charge is called a Deposit Item Returned (DIR) fee.
<p><li>
 If you get stung with what you consider outrageous or unfair bank fees, complain. Sometimes the bank will waive them in the name of good customer relations. The same holds true for banks that issue your credit card. Ask the issuing bank to waive its annual fee, lower the interest rate or both. You may be surprised at the response. If you don't like the answer, there are plenty of other banks to choose from.
<p><li> Comparison-shop. Banks are constantly changing their fee structures. Compare the costs of your account to those of other banks in your area. Know what types of transactions you regularly make and evalute accounts with your needs in mind. You may find a better deal at a different bank.
<p><li>Consider a credit union. Credit unions offer federally insured deposits but generally charge lower fees than commercial banks. Many companies, unions, state and local governments, and communities have credit unions that you may be eligible to join. Of course, you must weigh the issue of fees with other factors such as convenience, financial stability and quality of service.
<p> <li> If you use automated teller machines frequently, look for a bank or credit union with plenty of ATM machines. Most institutions don't charge you if you use their own machines, but may slap you with hefty fees usually $1 per transaction, if you use an affiliate's machine on the ATM network.
<p><li> Check out minimum balances. Find out how the bank figures the balance. Some use an average daily balance approach, but others use the low-balance method, meaning if your balance drops below the minimum for even a single day, you get hit with account fees and probably lose any interest due to be paid for the period.
<p><li>Also ask what the bank counts toward the minimum balance. Some banks count savings along with the checking and some even count CD deposits.
<p><li> Consolidate accounts and services. The more types of banking you do at one institution, the more likely you'll receive discounts or special deals. For example, if you keep minimum check and savings balances, you may be eligible for loan discounts, higher CD rates or no-fee credit cards. Also ask if your bank offers any special discounts for senior citizens.

<h1>Three museums in San Francisco share artistic rebirth</h1>
<P>By Joanna Biggar 
<BR>Maturity New Service
<P>Like three sisters, the three major museums of San Francisco have 
overcome rivalries rooted in their origins to seek a new, mature and vibrant beauty.
<P>In January 1995, the sensational new building for the San Francisco 
Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA), designed by Swiss architect Mario Botta, 
opened with worldwide attention on the museum's 60th anniversary.
<P>In September, the classically elegant California Palace of the Legion 
of Honor, modeled on the Palais de la Legion d'Honneur in Paris, reopened to 
rave reviews after a major seismic retrofitting and remodeling.
<P>And, after long debate about the future of the popular M.H. de Young 
Memorial Museum, trustees decided that it will remain where it has always been, 
in Golden Gate Park. Extensive rebuilding to modernize and make the oldest of 
the three museums earthquake-safe will begin next year.
<P>In a city of arts and artists, these events have kept the public eye focused 
on its museums, which have been at the epicenter of new cultural activity and 
have acted as a magnet, drawing visitors from America and abroad.
<P>That public eye was important from the beginning, when publishing 
baron Michael de Young, inspired by Chicago's 1893 international exposition and 
the Metropolitan Museum in New York's Central Park, staged a midwinter 
exposition in Golden Gate Park in 1894.
<P>After the exposition, which de Young's San Francisco Chronicle 
declared &quot;one of the greatest international expositions the world has ever known,&quot; 
he wanted a permanent home for some of the fair's surplus of &quot;treasures and 
curios,&quot; which became the nucleus of the de Young Museum.
<P>From a hodgepodge of stuffed birds and eggs, Alaskan and South Sea 
relics and mementos from pioneers, it grew to encompass American and 
European masterpieces, textiles, photography, and African, Asian, Oceanic and 
pre-Columbian American art.
<P>Major donors included Samuel H. Kress, Mr. and Mrs. John D. 
Rockefeller III, and Avery Brundage, whose world-class Asian art collection became 
the Asian Art Museum in 1973.
<P>The Spanish-style structure has been the site of major exhibits since 
1932, when it showcased such famous Bay Area photographers as Edward 
Weston, Ansel Adams and Imogen Cunningham. In 1983, Queen Elizabeth II and 
Prince Philip dined there with the President and Mrs. Reagan.
<P>Social aspirations were fundamental to the birth of the city's 
museums, according to geographer and historian Gray Brechin, whose book &quot;Imperial 
San Francisco: Urban Power, Earthly Ruin&quot; is forthcoming from the University 
of California Press.
<P>Before founding the museum, M.H. de Young used the Chronicle to 
heckle rival robber-baron Claus Spreckles for alleged misdeeds in his Hawaiian 
sugar plantations. Outraged, Claus' son Adolph shot de Young in 1884.
<P>The bad blood continued while the Spreckles bought their own paper, 
<I>The Call</I>, and while Adolph's wife Alma Spreckles in 1924 gave the city the 
beautiful Beaux-Arts-style Legion of Honor, on headlands overlooking the Golden Gate, 
in memory of Californians who died in World War I.
<P>&quot;Once Spreckles opened the Legion, the quality of art got better at the 
de Young because of their rivalry,&quot; contends Brechin.
<P>But quality went up when the rivalry ended, too. In 1972 both museums 
were merged as the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, which together hold 
more than 100,000 objects.
<P>Today's visitors are rewarded by those changes.
<P>Beyond pools, arches and columns, the courtyard of the Legion of 
Honor boasts a statue of Auguste Rodin's &quot;The Thinker.&quot; Its airy, spacious 
galleries house more than 4,000 years of European art, including medieval glass 
and sculpture, Dutch, English, Spanish and French paintings, and an 
outstanding Rodin collection.
<P>To view modern and post-modern work, as well as a jewel in the crown 
of late 20th-century architecture, it's necessary to cross town to the popular South 
of Market urban park, Yerba Buena Gardens. There the striated, round tower of 
the Museum of Modern Art dominates the cityscape like a gigantic eye, and 
brings the light inside. 
<P>According to Brechin, modern art was historically the domain of 
San Francisco's community of cultivated German Jews, who were excluded 
from other cultural circles.
<P>With its expansion into the new building, the museum is now 
attracting interest worldwide.
<P>Its 50,000 feet of exhibition space make it twice the size of most modern 
art museums. Permanent displays include works by Henri Matisse, Philip 
Guston, Frida Kahlo, Richard Diebenkorn, Georgia O'Keeffe and Andy Warhol, as well 
as an outstanding photography collection.
<P>But the great masterpiece may be Botta's new building itself.
<P>According to critic Allan Temko, with its bookstore, cafe and 
children's school, &quot;it is an Italian space,&quot; creating an indoor piazza.
<P>There is also grandeur in its light, height and the daring footbridge 
crossing the tower. Botta himself has compared the structure to a cathedral.

<H1>Eerie Idaho landscape resembles moon</H1>
<P>By Bill and Jan Moeller
<br>Maturity News Service
<P>If you've ever envied the astronauts who have had a close-up look at 
the moon, you can get an idea of what they experienced by journeying only as far 
as Idaho. Here, in the southern part of the state, are landscapes similar to those 
on the moon.
<P>The dominant feature of the area is the scabrous, lava-covered Snake 
River Plain. Extending 300 miles east to west and 60 miles across at its widest 
point, the plain forms an oval roughly bounded by the towns of Idaho Falls 
and Pocatello on the east, Twin Falls to the southwest, and Arco on the north.
<P>Here, between 15 million and 25 million years ago, molten basalt 
magma rose from the interior of the Earth. But instead of erupting from volcanoes, 
it welled up through cracks on the Earth's surface. The liquid basalt spread 
across the land to form the plain. In places, the layer of basalt is 100 feet thick.
<P>On Earth, this type of basalt formation exists in very few places, but on 
the moon, they are common. You can see them without a telescope: They are 
the round black spots visible on a full moon. The composition of the basalt from 
both Earth and moon is identical, as proven by moon rocks brought back by the 
astronauts. 
<P>Other moonscapes may be seen at Craters of the Moon National 
Monument, 18 miles west of Arco on the northern edge of the plain.
<P>Here is a truly other-worldly place. The landscape is almost totally 
black because much of the area is carpeted with cinders. What isn't is covered 
with black lava.
<P>It appears to be devoid of vegetation except for a few scrubby pines 
struggling to survive in the ropy lava flows that snake across the land, but more 
than 300 species of plants live here. If you visit the monument in the spring, you'll 
see wildflowers blooming among the cinders, their colors intense, almost 
fluorescent, against the dark background.
<P>You can climb cinder cones (some formed as recently as 2,000 years 
ago) and explore lava-tube caves floored with ice that never melts. A word of 
caution: Wear sturdy shoes, because lava formations can be sharp.
<P>If you are traveling in a recreational vehicle, you can stay in the 
campground at the monument. You will never have stayed in another campground like it. 
On moonless nights, it's sometimes difficult to distinguish where the sky ends and 
the black land begins. The eerie stillness of the early morning hours may be 
broken by the wailing of kit foxes and coyotes.
<P>An ice cave larger than any found at Craters of the Moon is nearby on 
the western edge of the plain, a few miles north of the town of Shoshone. The 
year-round temperature in the Shoshone Indian Ice Caves varies between 18 and 
28 degrees Fahrenheit, even when hot summer temperatures prevail outside.
<P>A guided tour, three-quarters of a mile in length, is given every 30 
minutes. Be sure to bring a coat.
<P>If you like to fish, you will have to forget the activity while at Craters of 
the Moon or anywhere else on the Snake River Plain because there are no 
streams. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 -->

<BR>Lava flows are riddled with fractures and underlying porous spaces, so any 
surface water quickly drains away.
<P>You can see the result of the underground drainage by visiting the 
Thousand Springs area a short distance west of Twin Falls. Water that may have 
traveled underground for more than 150 miles reappears here as waterfalls, but not 
conventional waterfalls that drop from the top of a cliff.
<P>Here, the water issues forth from points many feet down from the top on 
the side of the cliff. While there are not truly a thousand of them, there are a 
good number, frothing while as they spill from the emerald green, moss-covered cliff.
<P>On the way to Thousand Springs, approaching Twin Falls from the north, 
the highway runs through the relatively flat lava beds of the Snake River 
Plain. Suddenly, just outside the city, without any warning you find yourself on a 
bridge spanning the 486-feet-deep Snake River Gorge.
<P>The bridge is built on a series of arches and has no overhead structures 
that can be seen as you approach, so it's startling to find that the land has 
fallen abruptly away and you are on a bridge.
<P>Avail yourself of the parking areas and pedestrian walkways to inspect 
and marvel at this astounding chasm and the mighty Snake River, which appears as 
a tiny stream below.
<P>Shoshone Falls, also known as &quot;The Niagara of the West,&quot; where the 
Snake River takes a 212-foot plunge, is five miles east of Twin Falls. Although much 
of the water is diverted for irrigation in the summer, it's well worth seeing, 
especially in the spring when it's a thunderous cascade.

700 W. State St., Department C, Boise, Idaho 83720, or phone (800) 635-7820

<P><H1>What is a "continuum of care"?</H1>
<P>By Stan Mingus
<P>In the senior housing industry "continuum of care" is a term used to 
describe the type of services that a facility may offer ranging from independent living 
to total care.
<P>Perhaps these descriptions may help you to put this into perspective:
<P> <I>Independent Living</I> means that residents are capable of taking care 
of themselves. Senior residential facilities that offer independent living may 
offer some meals, activities and transportation to make life easier, but residents are 
not dependent upon them.
<P> <I>Catered Living</I> is a new term in our area this year. It provides 
24-hour access to a skilled caregiver and a resident services coordinator who 
coordinate the unique needs of each participant in the program. The program was started 
to basically provide aid for a caregiver whose spouse needed care, but they 
wanted to continue to live together.
<P> <I>Assisted Living Care</I> is designed for people who require a certain 
amount of services to be provided such as meal preparation, medication 
monitoring, laundry and personal care services and transportation; but they do not need 
the full-time care offered in a nursing home setting.
<P> <I>Skilled Nursing Care</I> is the full-time care offered by nursing homes, 
where all of the residents' needs must be met by a skilled staff. Most skilled care 
facilities are now geared towards rehabilitation care, rather than custodial care, 
with the goal of preparing their residents for a lower level of care situation.  
<P> <I>Subacute Care</I> is another term just recently introduced to our area. 
This level of care is for the patient who is seriously ill, but medically stable, who 
still requires highly skilled nursing/rehabilitative care; and can receive this care in 
a nursing home setting instead of remaining in the hospital. One of the 
obvious benefits of this is that the costs associated with subacute care are lower than 
a recuperative stay in the hospital.
<P> We add <I>Alzheimer's Care</I> to this list because it has it's own "continuum 
of care". In the early stages of Alzheimer's, a person may need to be placed in 
an Assisted Living program to help them with meals, transportation and 
supervision. There are now homes designed specifically to provide assisted care only for 
those in the early stages of Alzheimer's. As the disease progresses, however, 
full-time skilled care becomes necessary. This is being provided by many Skilled 
Care Facilities and, today, nursing facilities devoted solely to Alzheimer's care 
are being developed.
<P>To this list we must also add <I>Adult Day Care 
Service</I> facilities. These are becoming important for the at-home caregiver who needs some respite from their duties, or for the caregiver who must also hold down a job while still providing care for a loved one. These facilities usually provide daytime activities and 
meals from before-work hours to after-work hours.
<P>Within this continuum, all levels of senior care can be found. When 
looking for such facilities, one might be cautioned to look carefully, and don't be afraid 
to ask questions. In each community there are good resource people who can 
guide you in your selection of a senior housing facility. You can usually start 
your search for them at the Senior Information &amp; Referral Service provided by 
the local Area Agency on Aging.

<h1>Old farms drawing modern travelers</h1>
<P>By Joanna Biggar and Joe Volz
<br>Maturity News Service
<P>You just can't keep `em down on the farm. But you can sure bring `em 
back for a breath of fresh air.
<P>In idyllic rural settings across the country, modern travelers are stopping at 
a fascinating breed of tourist attractions to get a first-hand sense of life on the farm.
<P>The destinations include farmhouses that have been turned into small 
museums, bed-and-breakfast inns set in rolling pasture lands, and working farms 
and ranches that take in guests.
<P>Consider this travelogue through the fields of America:
<P> The Marilyn and Alden Hopkins family have owned their land near 
the coast of Delaware since 1845, making theirs a Delaware Century Farm - one 
kept in the same family for at least 100 years. In 1983, Alden took timber from 
his land to build a covered bridge and gave the historic place a new name, the 
Covered Bridge Farm.
<P>The oldest part of the old farmhouse, which is listed in the National 
Register of Historic Places, dates from 1830. This fall, it became part of the 
Delaware Farmland Preservation District, 25,000 acres pledged to remain farmland.
<P>Alden and Marilyn, a retired teacher, preserved a sense of heritage by 
turning part of their property into a little farm museum. Visitors of all ages can enjoy 
a stroll around the grounds, crossing the covered bridge and absorbing a sense 
of rootedness from the unchanged land secured by old trees, a red barn and 
white farmhouse, fences and fields yellowing with cornstalks in early fall.
<P>There is a quaint gazebo, and several outbuildings that have been 
converted to display collections: old tractors and farm vehicles (which Alden keeps 
in running condition) in the barn, and vintage farm tools in the old milkhouse.
<P>A favorite spot is the walk-through, two-story doll house, complete 
with furnishings, toys, a new blue floor, wallpaper and a mailbox where 
schoolchildren leave notes.
<P>Inside a newer house on the grounds, front and back parlors with old 
family pieces, china and cranberry glass create a real sense of Victoriana. 
At Christmastime, Marilyn's extensive collection of dolls, many in skating or 
caroling costumes, is displayed.
<P>Tours are free and by appointment only. Call (302) 684-1591.
<P> In the center of Mitchell, on Interstate 90 in the southeast corner of 
South Dakota, is a remarkable structure: the Corn Palace.
<P>The original building, of fantastic Moorish design with towers and 
minarets, was constructed in 1892 to highlight the fact that the fertile land was good 
for growing crops. 
<P>The present structure, the third version of the Corn Palace, was built in 
1921 and is more onion-dome in design, but like the original is covered with designs 
of ears of corn, outlined with grasses and grains.
<P>Each year in summer and early fall, 2,000 to 3,000 bushels of various 
shades of corn and grasses are used to refurbish and redesign the palace.
<P>Inside is a large auditorium, which in summer months caters to visitors 
with 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 -->

<BR>
shopping kiosks, videos and displays. The other nine months it serves the 
local community as a venue for entertainers, the circus, basketball games and proms.
<P>Other events include: in mid-June, the Corn Palace Balloon rally, with 
hot-air balloon races; in mid-July, the Corn Palace Stampede Rodeo, featuring 
calf roping and barrel racing; in September, the Corn Palace Festival, with a 
carnival, and the Polka Festival, with three days of dancing and music.
<P>Guided tours of the palace are given year-round. Admission is free.
<P>For information, call (800) 257-CORN.
<P> Many travelers find a link to the land at a restored fieldstone colonial 
house called The Inn at Fordhook in Doylestown, PA, in picturesque Bucks County 
near Philadelphia.
<P>The elegant house is the former home to W. Atlee Burpee, the 
legendary seed grower who developed a vast mail-order business with his seed catalogs. 
<P>Burpee's grandchildren have turned the house into a bed-and-breakfast 
inn named for his big selling Fordhook lima bean seeds. The house - sitting on 
60 acres of rolling pasture with a small carriage house nearby - contains six 
homey guest rooms as well as the study where Burpee wrote his catalogs.
<P>Although the seed company has been sold and seed cultivation no 
longer takes place at Fordhook, many of the old seedbeds have been turned into a 
community garden, giving the place the feel of an old-fashioned farm.
<P>For more information, call (215) 345-1766.
<P> In Southern California, the Rankin Ranch exemplifies a new breed 
of vacation retreat: the working cattle ranch that invites in city slickers.
<P>Set in a secluded valley with 12 duplex cabins for guests and a central, 
high-ceilinged dining room featuring Western-style grub, visitors of all ages feed 
farm animals, ride horses and even herd cattle with the real cowboys who work 
the ranch.
<P>The ranch has been in the Rankin family for more than 130 years and 
has been accepting vacationers for more than 30 years, making it one of the 
old-timers in the field of agritourism. The theme is quality time for family vacations 
- distinguishing it from fancy dude ranches that lure would-be cowboys 
from corporate America.
<P>&quot;It's a unique way to spend a vacation,&quot; said rancher Bill Rankin. &quot;People 
go away with a better sense of what agriculture in general - and cattle ranching 
in particular - is all about.&quot; Call (805) 867-2511.

<H1>Occupational therapy plays significant role in 
improving safety and independence</H1>
<P>By Sara Kennedy, OTR
<P>Who would have thought that &quot;home sweet home&quot; could be such a 
dangerous place? The home environment can be a significant factor in limiting 
our independence later in life. For example, more than half of falls by the 
well-elderly come as a result of tripping over something, with an estimated thirty percent 
of those over 64 falling at least one time a year.
<P>As our physical abilities change, safety in the home can be increased 
by adapting the environment to meet our unique needs. An occupational 
therapist can play a significant role in home assessment and adaptations for people 
desiring to improve safety and increase independence. 
<P>What happens in a home evaluation? The occupational therapist (OT) 
works with the consumer to develop a &quot;strengths and problems&quot; list related to the 
daily routine at home. Perhaps there are no concerns about getting around the home 
by day, but getting up at night is difficult. The OT would help the consumer get 
to the root of the problem; whether that may be lack of proper lighting, 
obstacles such as throw rugs, or even a medication that may be interfering with alertness 
or balance.
<P>Many people are concerned about bathroom safety, and rightly so, for 
more than half of the falls in the home happen in the bathroom. (After all, we all 
have to visit bathrooms regularly and the bathroom is often a slippery place.) 
Non-slip surfaces are one obvious solution. Narrow doorways that were not problem 
when we were fifty can be hazardous when we must navigate sideways to 
accommodate a cane or walker. 
<P>Besides addressing environmental barriers, the OT may also recommend 
a short course of therapy to improve functioning in daily living skills. If 
overhead reach has become a problem, therapeutic exercise and stretching can be 
beneficial. For people with memory difficulties, systems can be set up to 
enhance memory through written or other visual cues.
<P>In this day and age, most of us need some sort of calendar to keep track 
of our schedule - the same principle can be used to remember medication, 
cooking safety measures, and to manage bill paying. In any case, the consumer and the 
OT collaborate to reach the best outcome.
<P>Often, the therapist takes an active role in educating the family or 
other caregivers to improve safety, ease and efficiency of care. Common topics 
include conserving energy, easier methods for lifting, use of assistive devices for care, 
and simplifying tasks and routines.
<P>Opening up one's home to an assessment of this nature can be an 
uncomfortable notion. Many people fear that letting a health professional know that 
there are &quot;problems at home&quot; will spell an end to independent living. Certainly 
there are times when the benefits of living at home outweigh the risks of injury. 
However, those people who have successfully remained at home have made 
timely accommodations to their changing abilities. Safety first!

<h1>Leave Act only modest help for workers giving elder care</h1>
<P>By Mary Beth Franklin
<br>Maturity News Service
<P>Up to 40 percent of American workers, it's estimated, will have to help care 
for an older person within the next five years. Many may have to - or want to - take 
time off work to meet those obligations. You might think the 1993 Family and 
Medical Leave Act would be a big help, but for all its good intentions, the act may be of 
little use to many workers.
<P>The act allows employees to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave per year 
to recover from their own illness, to care for a newborn or newly adopted child, or 
to tend to a sick family member, including an elderly parent.
<P>The law guarantees that employees will have continued health benefits during 
a leave and a job upon their return. It covers all public sector employees and 
private businesses with 50 or more employees.
<P>That means nearly half of the private sector work force - those whose 
employers have fewer than 50 employees - are not covered.
<P>In addition, the fact that the guaranteed leave is unpaid means that many 
workers who would like to take the time off can't afford to.
<P>Today, seven to 12 percent of workers are caring for an older person. 
Dana Friedman, co-president of the Families and Work Institute, a nonprofit research firm in 
New York, projects that figure may rise to 40 percent within the next five years. A sizable 
majority of caregivers will be women.
<P>In its first report to Congress on the effectiveness of the new law, the 
Commission on Family and Medical Leave said more than two-thirds of employees 
surveyed agree that all workers should be entitled to up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave in a 
year for family and medical problems. 
<P>Actual use of the new law, however, was fairly low - about 2 percent of 
eligible employees, according to the report.
<P>Somewhere between 1.5 million and just over 3 million workers are estimated 
to have taken leave under the new law for a variety of family and personal 
medical reasons since its enactment, the report said.
<P>One provision of the law says leave can be taken intermittently in hours or 
days, rather than all at once. This arrangement can be particularly helpful to a worker 
with an ill parent who may not need whole days or weeks, but must leave work 
periodically to take a parent to the doctor or meet other medical needs.
<P>Overall, the commission offered a positive assessment of the Family and 
Medical Leave Act. The report termed it a first step in standardizing work place 
procedures to allow &quot;a larger cross-section of working Americans to meet their medical 
and family caregiving needs while still maintaining their jobs and economic security.&quot;
<P>But the fact that leave mandated by the act is unpaid is a major stumbling 
block to some workers who would like to take time off but can't afford to.
<P>The commission estimated that 3.4 percent of covered employees felt 
they needed a leave, but did not take it. For nearly two-thirds of those workers, the 
reason was that they could not afford the loss of wages.
<P>The commission said a majority of companies reported few new costs 
associated with administering the leave act. Some firms even indicated positive results in 
the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 -->

<BR>
form of increased productivity and lower worker turnover.
<P>While the federal government has tried to set the tone for more 
family-friendly work place policies with the passage of the Family and Medical Leave Act, 
real innovations will be up to the business community.
<P>Some forward-thinking companies, recognizing the impact that caregiving 
stress can have on worker productivity, have taken steps to help their employees 
cope. NYNEX, the regional phone company in New England and New York, is one 
example. Texas Instruments and Kodak are others.
<P>According to several human resources experts, the most useful benefits 
to employees with caregiving responsibilities are flexible work schedules and 
information and referral services.
<P>Those lucky enough to work for more innovative companies are benefiting 
from such assistance. But for many, elder care is a juggling act that can become simply 
too hard to manage, particularly as adult daughters and daughters-in-law, who 
traditionally provided care for the elderly, are increasingly working outside the home.
<P>Two trends - an aging population and increasing participation of women in 
the work force - mean the pressure will only get worse.
<P>&quot;Elder care is a tidal wave issue that companies and society have not yet 
dealt with,&quot; Friedman of the Families and Work Institute observed.
<P>In the meantime, take time to learn your rights under the law. For a free copy

<H1>Plan ahead to avoid tax traps in using retirement funds</H1>
<P>By Mary Beth Franklin
<BR>Maturity News Service
<P>When it comes to retirement planning, the first thing most people 
worry about is putting enough money away to finance a comfortable future.
<P>But you also have to plan how to get your money out of your nest 
egg. Otherwise, you may fall into one of three costly tax traps: withdrawing too 
soon, too late or too much.
<P>Qualified retirement plans, which include individual retirement 
accounts (IRAs), Keogh plans, SEP-IRAs and 401(k) plans offer the advantage of 
tax-deferred growth. Without taxes chipping away at your earnings, your 
investments can grow faster.
<P>But since the government gives you a tax deduction on the money earned 
by your investments and usually on the money you contribute to your 
retirement plan, it levies taxes on the money when you take it out.
<P>"Developing a strategy for getting your money out of your retirement plan 
is as important as putting it in", said Peter M. Quinn, a supervisor in the 
pension department of the Guardian Life Insurance Company of America. "You need 
a strategy to defer these taxes as long as possible." 
<P>Here's a look at the possible tax pitfalls associated with retirement 
plan withdrawals and suggestions on how to avoid them:
<P> <B><i>Withdrawing too soon.</B></i>
<P>If you take money out of a qualified retirement plan or IRA before you 
turn 59-1/2, you'll probably pay a 10 percent penalty on the amount you withdrew, 
in addition to regular income taxes.
<P>Obviously, the easiest way to avoid this trap is to leave the money 
alone until you turn 59-1/2. But a financial crisis may force you to go into your 
savings early.
<P>Luckily, there are some exceptions to the rule that may allow you to 
avoid the tax penalty.
<P>If you are 55 and are retiring or being terminated from your job, you 
can withdraw your qualified plan benefit in a lump sum without penalty.
<P>This provision does not apply to IRA distributions, but there are ways 
to take money out of your IRA early without tax penalty.
<P>You can withdraw funds in roughly equal periodic payments based on 
your life expectancy or the joint life expectancy of you and your beneficiary. (The 
IRS has tables telling you how long that is.) Withdrawals must continue for at 
least five years. 
<P>Or you can take an early withdrawal of IRA funds without tax penalty if 
the money is used to pay for catastrophic medical expenses - that is, medical 
costs exceeding 7.5 percent of your adjusted gross income.
<P>IRA funds can also be withdrawn early without penalty upon the death 
or disability of the plan owner or as part of a divorce court order.
<P><B><i> Withdrawing too little.</B></i>
<P>Most financial planners advise you to wait as long as possible before 
with
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 -->

<BR>
drawing funds from tax-deferred accounts because the funds grow faster that way.
<P>That's fine if you can get by without extra income. But at age 70-1/2, 
you must begin making at least minimum withdrawals, based on the life 
expectancy tables, even if you're still working. Otherwise, you will pay a 50 percent 
penalty on the minimum amount you failed to withdraw.
<P>The first withdrawal must be completed by April 1 of the year after you 
turn 70-1/2. Pay attention to the calendar and make those minimum withdrawals 
or Uncle Sam will take half of what you should have.
<P> <B><i>Withdrawing too much.</B></i>
<P>This sounds like a problem we all should have, but people who 
diligently sock away funds in their retirement plans during their entire working life 
can build up a good-sized account by retirement. It's not impossible to amass 
$1 million or more even on a middle-income salary.
<P>The rub is that when you reach 70-1/2 and have to start withdrawing 
funds, your minimum might be over $150,000 a year. If so, or if you have a lump 
sum withdrawal of over $750,000, you'll pay an extra 15 percent tax on any 
amount over those ceilings.
<P>The government lumps together all your plans in calculating whether you 
are subject to this so-called "success tax".
<P>Even though it's advantageous for most people to delay withdrawals 
from their retirement plans as long as possible in order to defer taxes, those 
with substantial retirement savings should consider withdrawing money each 
year before they are required in order to reduce the plan's balance. Income taxes 
will be due on withdrawals but you may avoid the 15 percent excise tax on 
excess accumulations.
<P>If you are in the "success tax" bracket, get some professional advice and 
start planning early for shifting funds out of your retirement account with the 
minimum tax liability.
<P>One strategy is to use your plan withdrawals to set up an irrevocable trust 
for the benefit of your children or grandchildren. The trust can purchase a life 
insurance policy that will provide for your heirs while removing the funds from 
your estate and potential estate taxes.

<b><h1>Reverse mortgage field is widening</h1></b>
<P>By Mary Beth Franklin 
<BR>Maturity News Service
<P>Growing competition in the reverse mortgage field means older 
homeowners now have more options than ever before in turning their home equity into 
retirement income.
<P>For retired homeowners, reverse mortgages can help with a variety of needs 
- making home repairs, paying property taxes, increasing monthly income 
or maintaining a ready cash reserve for health or other emergencies.
<P>But the array of new choices also means prospective borrowers must 
shop carefully for the loan that best suits their particular situation, warns Ken 
Scholen, a leading expert on reverse mortgages.
<P>The wrong plan could cost you thousands of additional dollars in loan 
costs or significantly restrict the amount you can borrow.
<P>&quot;You need to do your homework before putting your home equity to 
work,&quot; said Scholen, director of the nonprofit National Center for Home Equity 
Conversion in Apple Valley, MN. &quot;You simply cannot afford to make a mistake with 
your most important asset.&quot;
<P>The entrance of Fannie Mae, the nation's largest provider of home 
mortgages, into the reverse-mortgage market is expected to bring other lenders into 
the field as well, greatly expanding the availability and variety of this type of loan.
<P>Still a relatively new concept, reverse mortgages are tailored 
for homeowners 62 and older who are house-rich but cash-poor. This is a 
typical situation for older couples or individuals who have owned their houses for 
many years but whose incomes have dropped after retirement.
<P>As the name implies, a reverse mortgage is the opposite of a 
conventional mortgage.
<P>Instead of borrowing a large amount of money and then paying down 
the loan by making monthly installments over 15 or 30 years, a homeowner 
who takes out a reverse mortgage receives money from the lender in the form 
of monthly payments, a line of credit or a lump sum. Repayment is due when 
the homeowner moves, sells the home or dies.
<P>Since home equity, not income, is used to qualify, reverse mortgages 
are particularly attractive to lower-income borrowers faced with few financial 
options.
<P>Loan amounts are determined by the borrower's age, the value and 
location of the home and maximum credit restrictions imposed by the lender. 
Generally, the older the homeowner, the larger the available loan. 
<P>The homeowner retains title to the house and continues to live there 
while using it as collateral for the loan. The lender sends the funds to the 
homeowner for life or for a fixed number of years.
<P>Because the money is borrowed, not income, it is not subject to income tax.
<P>But large origination fees and other loan charges, high interest rates, and 
in some cases a promise to share a portion of the growth of the home's future 
equity with the lender can make reverse mortgages very expensive, particularly in 
the early years of the loan. After the loan is repaid, there may be little or nothing 
left for the owner or heirs.
<P>In addition to Fannie Mae's new &quot;Home Keeper&quot; mortgage program 
expected to be available nationwide later this year, consumers can choose from 
two other programs: the federally insured Home Equity Conversion Mortgages 
and private reverse mortgages available in certain states.
<P>In general, Scholen said, the federally insured Home Equity 
Conversion Mortgage provides the most cash at the lowest cost if your home's value is near 
or less than the median value in your area.
<P>For homes worth somewhat more than the median value, the new 
Fannie Mae plan might provide a greater cash advance because of its higher 
lending limits.
<P>For homes that are considerably more valuable, a private plan that is 
not limited by government lending restrictions might provide the greatest cash 
advance.
<P>But the only way to know which is the best reverse mortgage for you is 
to compare costs.
<P>A new federal truth-in-lending law requires lenders to disclose total 
annual loan costs for all reverse mortgages, making it easier for consumers to 
compare and analyze loans.
<P>When investigating a reverse mortgage, you want the answer to three 
basic questions: how much will you get, how much will it cost and how much will 
be left over after repaying the loan.
<P>While you may prefer getting as much money as possible, these new 
lending disclosure rules will help you determine if borrowing a little more money 
will cost you a lot more in the long run.
<P>Scholen outlines everything you need to know about the latest 
reverse mortgages, how they work and where to find them in his newly updated 
book, &quot;Your New Retirement Nest Egg: A Consumer Guide to the New Reverse 
Mortgages&quot; ($24.95, NCHEC Press). To order, call (800) 247-6553.
<P>For those who just want to know where to find a reverse mortgage lender, 
the American Association of Retired Persons offers a free Home Equity 
Information Kit (Publication D15601). Send a postcard to AARP Fulfillment, 601 E St. 
N.W., Washington, D.C. 20049.

<b><h1>What the pros consider when choosing mutual funds</h1></b>
<P>By Donna O'Bryant
<P>Have you walked down the cereal aisle of your grocery store lately? 
Today, there are more brands of cereal - and more varieties of each brand - than 
ever before. It can be difficult to make sure you get what you really want, but if 
you make a bad selection, you're only out a few dollars.
<P>If you think choosing from 100 different cereals is difficult, try picking 
from about 6,000 different mutual funds. Not only are there more choices, but if 
you wind up with one you don't like, you're out much more than a few dollars.
<P>More and more people are trying to select mutual funds on their 
own. Choosing from more than 2,000 stock funds, plus tax-exempt funds, 
government funds and money market funds, not only staggers the novice investor, but 
overwhelms the professionals. And simply paying a commission and blindly 
going along with a salesperson's recommendation is no assurance you'll get the 
right fund. Ultimately, success in selecting the right fund for your needs depends 
on you asking the right questions.
<P>What are those questions?
<P>Before you begin comparing funds, first decide on a specific 
investment objective. State in simple terms what the money is for. Then decide how long 
you plan to invest. Short-term money does not belong in stock mutual funds.
<P>In August 1987, for example, the stock market began a downturn that 
included a one-day 500-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 
October of that year. During that period, the average stock fund lost 29 percent. If you 
had bought a stock fund in August hoping to buy Christmas presents with your 
profits, you would have been disappointed.
<P>Long-term investors, however, have fared much better. In the more 
than eight years since then, the average stock fund is up 111 percent.
<P>After these two questions, you can begin comparing the wide variety 
of available mutual funds. What factors should you evaluate in your search? 
Consider what the professionals think is important.
<P>Mutual Funds magazine recently surveyed 100 mutual fund professionals 
to see what they look for when recommending stock funds for their clients. 
More than half said they look for &quot;consistently good results over a long period of 
time.&quot; These professionals were not concerned with short-term results, but rather 
consistent performance over at least a 10-year period.
<P>Another factor considered important is consistent portfolio 
management style. This quality, listed by 66 percent of the survey participants, is the 
discipline by the fund's managers to establish specific investment criteria and stick 
with them rather than trying out whatever is in vogue.
<P>A long-term track record and consistent style mean nothing if the 
fund manager responsible for those two qualities is no longer there. More than 
60 percent of the investment professionals said the longevity of the fund's 
current manager is a vital concern. Professionals want experience, and the longer, 
the better.
<P>The survey also uncovered numerous other concerns important to 
mutual fund professionals:
<BR>Risk                         48%
<BR>Expenses                         22%
<BR>How soon client will need money     22%
<BR>Past performance vs. peers          18%
<BR>Portfolio composition               18%
<BR>Fund family affiliation               14%
<BR>Good performance in down markets       8%
<P>
<P>These concerns should guide you in your choice of mutual funds. 
They require research either by you or the representative who offers the funds. 
The more information you have, the easier it will be to choose the right fund for you.

<h1>Which investments are best for tax-deferred account?</h1>
<P>By Mary Beth Franklin
<BR>Maturity News Service
<P>The key advantage of stashing money in a tax-deferred retirement 
account isn't just that you'll pay less to the government this year, but that your 
investments will compound faster than in a taxable account. The result is usually 
a larger retirement nest egg even after the funds are taxed upon withdrawal. 
<P>In tax-deferred accounts such as a 401(k), a Simplified Employee 
Pension (SEP) plan, Individual Retirement Account (IRA) or a Keogh plan for the 
self-employed, dividends and interest income are not subject to tax until funds 
are withdrawn after retirement. This means not only lower taxes in the current 
year but also a larger base in each successive year for that year's growth. Hence, 
the overall accumulation is accelerated.
<P>Some types of investments work better than others in these accounts. 
Here are some general Guidelines to consider when funding your tax-deferred 
retirement account.
<P><I> Tax-free bonds.</I>
<BR>One investment you should never put inside a tax-deferred account is  
tax-exempt bonds. That's because the interest is already tax-free, which is why 
tax-exempts generally yield less than comparable taxable bonds.
<P>If you put tax-exempts inside a retirement account, the earnings will be 
taxed as regular income when you withdraw them. The result would be to turn a 
tax-free investment into a taxable one - and that's not a wise move.
<P> <I>Taxable bonds and bond mutual funds.</I>
<BR>These investments are excellent candidates for inclusion in your 
tax-deferred retirement account.
<P>The income from taxable bonds and bond mutual funds is subject to 
federal and state taxes. By holding them in a qualified retirement plan you defer 
those taxes until you withdraw them in retirement, when your tax bracket may be 
lower because your annual income is reduced.
<P>This tax deferral is particularly valuable for deep discount and zero 
coupon bonds, which generate no current income but incur annual taxes.
<P> <I>Dividend-producing stocks and income mutual funds.</I>
<BR>Like bonds, individual stocks and stock mutual funds whose returns 
come mostly from dividends, not price appreciation, should be kept in 
tax-deferred retirement accounts.
<P><I> Growth stocks.</I>
<BR>Financial experts are divided on the wisdom of keeping these stocks in 
tax-deferred accounts.
<P>Some say it is better to keep these stocks in taxable accounts because 
most of their gain is from price appreciation, which you don't pay taxes on until 
you sell the stock. When you do sell a growth stock, it is taxed at the capital 
gains rate, which is often lower than a taxpayer's regular income tax rate.
<P>The maximum capital gains tax is 28 percent, while personal tax rates 
for upper-income taxpayers can go as high as 39.6 percent.
<P>If growth stocks are held inside a retirement account, you might be trading in 
a 28 percent capital gains tax for a higher tax rate, depending on your income 
and tax bracket. You also lose the ability to offset capital gains with capital losses when stock is held inside a retirement plan.
<P>However, a 1995 study in the Journal of Investing says this strategy 
of keeping growth stocks out of your retirement accounts works only if you buy 
and hold a stock for a long time.
<P>If you are an active trader, you may do better putting the stocks inside 
your tax-deferred account. That way you'll be taxed only once when you withdraw 
the funds rather than paying taxes on each transaction.
<P> <I>Higher turnover mutual funds.</I>
<BR>Mutual funds investing in growth stocks may be good candidates for 
inclusion in your tax-deferred retirement account. That's because these funds 
usually buy and sell a lot of stocks each year.
<P>By law, they are required to pass 98 percent of their net investment 
earnings, including capital gains, on to their shareholders. Unless you keep them in a 
tax-deferred account, you'll be taxed on these gains each year.
<P> <I>Consider interest rates.</I>
<BR>Since tax-deferred retirement accounts have limits on how much you can contribute each year, don't use up those quotas with low-yielding investments like money market funds. Why protect something that is only earning 3 percent or 5 percent interest? Better to reserve this valuable tax deferral for investments 
that warrant protection.
<P>On the other hand, if yields were to rise significantly in the future, it might make sense to shelter interest income from taxes with a tax-deferred account.
<P>Whatever you invest in, the most important thing is to contribute as much 
as possible to your tax-deferred account. Not only will you pay less on 
current income and increase your future retirement income, but you may also reduce 
your taxable income if your contribution qualifies for a tax deduction.

<h1>Social Security Trust Funds Growing: Long-Term Problems Remain</h1>
<P>By Sandy Taylor
<br>District Manager, SSA
<P>The Social Security trust funds are solvent for more than three decades 
into the future, according to the 1996 Annual Board of Trustees Report.
<P>The Board of Trustees is required by law to report annually to Congress 
on the current and estimated future financial condition of the Old Age and 
Survivors Insurance (OASI) and Disability Insurance (DI) Trust Funds. The report 
uses annually updated economic and demographic assumptions, reflecting the 
nation's most recent experience and best available research. The 1996 report reflects 
little change from the Board of Trustees reports for the past two years.
<P>The 1996 report shows that income to the combined retirement, 
survivors, and disability trust funds amounted to $400 billion in calendar year 1995, 
and expenditures were $340 billion. The combined trust fund assets thus increased 
by $60 billion, and at the end of December stood at $500 billion.
<P>The report also states that the combined trust funds are expected to 
grow until 2019, and then to decline until they would be exhausted in 2029. Both 
of these dates are one year sooner than estimated in the 1995 Annual Report of 
the Board of Trustees. Contrary to what many people believe, Social Security 
would not be &quot;broke&quot; in 2029. The Social Security system will continue to 
receive payroll taxes, enough to cover 77 percent of the full benefit costs at that 
time. While there are long-range financing problems for Social Security, there is 
also ample time to discuss alternatives and to find a resolution.
<P>The 1996 trustees report on the status of the Medicare trust funds was 
less favorable. The estimated depletion of the Hospital Insurance (HI) trust fund 
will occur in the year 2001, based on the most probably economic and 
demographic assumptions. This is one year earlier than had been forecast by the trustees 
last year.
<P>To address the short-term financial problems facing the HI trust fund, 
the trustees recommended the earliest possible enactment of legislation to 
reduce growth in HI program costs and to extend the date of exhaustion of the HI 
trust fund. For longer-term Medicare financing problems, the trustees 
recommended the establishment of a national advisory group on Medicare reform to 
develop proposals.
<P>Six people serve on the Social Security and Medicare Board of Trustees: 
the Secretary of the Treasury, Robert Rubin; the Secretary of Labor, Robert Reich; 
the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Donna Shalala; the Commissioner 
of Social Security, Shirley Chater; and two members appointed by the President 
and confirmed by the Senate to represent the public, Stephen Kellison and 
Marilyn Moon.
<P>If you have any questions on SSA or SSI programs, you can call us 
toll-free at 1-800-772-1213 from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Monday through Friday.

<H1>Federal agencies have free health info</H1>
<P>
<P>By Matthew Lesko and Mary Ann Martello
<BR>Maturity News Service
<P>Want to know the latest research on angioplasty? What about how to lower your high blood pressure? Or general information on exercise, menopause or how to get a good night's sleep?
<P>You can get information straight from top researchers in the field if you know who to call -- your own government.
<P>Here's a sampling of topics and sources of information:
<P>
<P><I>AGING.</I>     The National Institute on Aging (NIA) researches 
all kinds of subjects on aging, as well as the diseases 
and special problems of older people.  It can answer your 
questions and provide you with all kinds of free publications on a wide variety of topics.
For a publications list, contact the NIA Information 
Center, P.O. Box 8057, Gaithersburg, Md. 20898, or call 
(800) 222-2225.
<P>
<P><I>ARTHRITIS.</I> More than half of people over 65 suffer from 
some form of arthritis, whether it is a mild stiffness 
in the joints on rainy days or full-blown osteoarthritis.  But 
for many, a simple change in diet and exercise could 
result in an improvement in their condition.
<P>For free publications, contact the National Arthritis 
and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases Information Clearinghouse, P.O. Box AMS, 9000 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, 
Md. 20892; telephone (301) 495-4484.
<P>
<P><I>CANCER.</I>  No one likes to think about the &quot;C&quot; word.  
But think about this: The earlier cancer is found, the better 
 your chances of beating it.  Simple tests can help 
find cancer early, long before any symptoms appear, and 
research is showing that this has helped increase the survival rate 
dramatically for certain types of cancer.
<P>For accurate, up-to-date information about cancer and 
cancer-related resources near you, contact the Cancer 
Information Service, Building 31, Room 10A16, 9000 Rockville 
Pike, Bethesda, Md. 20892, or call (800) 4-CANCER.
<P>
<P><I>DIABETES.</I>  With the proper diet and exercise program 
many of the 11 million Americans with diabetes, can 
actually reverse or reduce insulin resistance, which is one of the underlying causes 
of diabetes.  
<P>For a list of free publications that can answer many of your questions, contact National 
Diabetes Information Clearinghouse, 1 Information Way, Bethesda, Md. 20892.
<P>
<P><I>EYESIGHT.</I>  For free publications on eye problems, you 
may write to the National Eye Institute, Information Office, 
Building 31, Room 6A32, Bethesda, Md. 20892.  Tips include: 
having regular health checkups to detect diseases that 
cause eye problems; having a complete eye exam every two to 
three years and seeking eye health care more often if you have 
a family history of eye problems.
<P>
<P><I>HEALTH FRAUD.</I>  There are all kinds of scams aimed at older people who are vulnerable to their unrealistic claims. But you should ignore those seductive ads in the supermarket tabloids.  No amount of rubbing, wrapping, massaging or scrubbing will cure your arthritis.  And no over-the-counter cream, lotion or device can prevent baldness, or induce new hair to grow.
<P>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has several pamphlets to help educate you about health fraud.  Some of the free titles include "Health Claims: Separating Fact From 
Fiction" and "Healthy Questions (To Ask Health Care Specialists)." To receive your copies, contact Public Reference, Room 130, FTC, Washington,D.C. 20580; or call (202) 326-2222.
<P>
<P><I>HEARING LOSS</I>.  If you are currently shopping around for a hearing aid, you know that the choices you have are as varied as their price tags.  To learn about the causes of hearing loss, hearing aid information and the latest research on the topic or to request publications that explain common problems, contact the National Institute 
on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders Information Clearinghouse, 
I Communication Way, Bethesda, Md. 20892-3456; phone (800) 241-1044; (800) 241-1055 TTY.
<P>
<P><I>HEARTBURN.</I>  No need to spend the rest of your life chugging antacids for that upset stomach. There are some simple home remedies you can try to control heartburn  for example, avoiding some foods, such as peppermint, orange juice and chocolate.  You can even try elevating the head of your bed six inches (although ask your spouse first).
<P>For more information on heartburn or ulcers, contact the National Digestive Diseases 
Information Clearinghouse, 2 Information Way, Bethesda, Md. 20892-3570; phone (301) 
654- 3810.
<P>
<P><I>HEART DISEASE.</I> With  help from the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, you can learn how to control high blood pressure or cholesterol. For publications or more information, contact the institute's Information 
Center, P.O. Box 30105, Bethesda, Md. 20824; phone (800) 575-WELL.
<P>
<P><I>PROSTATE.</I>   If a man lives long enough, he's 
almost certain to have some kind of noncancerous problem with his prostate.  Fortunately, there are also many effective treatments.
<P>To learn more about prostate problems and treatment options, write for a free information packet to the National Kidney and Urologic Diseases Information Clearinghouse, 3 Information Way, Bethesda, Md. 20892.

<H1>Study confirms exercise helps seniors sleep</H1>
<P>By Maturity News Service
<P>Older people who exercise moderately on a regular basis take less 
time getting to sleep at night and generally sleep longer and more soundly than 
their sedentary counterparts.This was the finding of sleep researchers at the Stanford Center for Research and the Emory University Sleep Disorders Program in Atlanta. 
<P>Two groups of older volunteers were studied. One embarked on an 
exercise program; the other remained sedentary. Within just a few months, it was 
apparent that the exercisers were falling asleep faster and sleeping almost an hour 
longer than the couch potatoes, said Emory's Donald Bliwise.
<P>Many factors can affect the quality of sleep for older people, including depression, neurological difficulties, sleep apnea, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease.
<P>Besides daily exercise, establishing a sleep routine and a normal bedtime 
is important in conditioning the body and mind to begin a period of rest, 
sleep experts say. Don't watch disturbing news or movies right before bedtime 
and avoid drinking alcohol if you are having trouble sleeping.
<P>Reducing the amount of caffeine consumed - in teas, colas and 
chocolate drinks as well as coffee - may help with insomnia.
<P>Try to get exposure to sunlight early in the day. This helps set up the 
body's clock and condition it to wake and sleep cycles. Artificial or fluorescent 
light does not have the same beneficial effect.
<P>A leisurely walk after dinner often helps older people sleep. More 
vigorous exercise like jogging or working out on a treadmill or stair machine is not a 
good idea. The elevated pulse which occurs during prolonged exercise often tends 
to energize and awake people and is better done at midday or earlier.

<h1>Even a few pounds less can improve seniors' health</h1>
<P>By Joan McQueeney Mitric
<br>Maturity News Service
<P>Once again, Americans are being warned to count the calories and skim 
the fat.
<P>Despite an increase during the 1980s in the number of people who 
joined fitness clubs or reported some daily exercise, new studies show that fried 
and fatty food and sedentary lifestyles are again ascendant and causing more 
American waistlines to swell to dangerous proportions.
<P>Doctors say the danger is more acute for people who are middle-aged 
or older: For them, even 20 excess pounds can trigger killer diseases such as 
diabetes, high blood pressure or heart disease and can put some people at a 
much higher risk of dying from colon, breast or prostate cancer.
<P>According to several recent studies, more than one-third of all adults, or 
59 million Americans, are overweight. Overweight is defined as weighting 20 
percent more than recommended under current medical guidelines. Obesity begins 
at 30 percent above the medically desirable weight for your age and height.
<P>But don't despair. There are commonsense rules for fighting the battle 
of the bulge at any age.
<P>According to JoAnne Manson, an endocrinologist at Boston's Brigham 
and Women's Hospital who's been studying obesity for 20 years, the fight against 
fat should start with cutting down on fried food, gourmet ice cream, 
extra-cheese pizza and 10-ounce steaks.
<P>Consumption of steamed or raw vegetables and unadulterated fresh 
fruit should be expanded, she said.
<P>Rice, lentils, beans, pasta and couscous are filling and healthy main 
courses. Skip the high-fat cream, bacon and alfredo sauces and try a medley of 
fresh tomatoes, peppers, garlic, spices or a salsa-type topping.
<P>Other fat-fighting tips:
<P> Try eating six or seven minimeals during the day instead of big dinners. 
For example, eat a half a grapefruit or a big wedge of melon and a slice of 
whole grain bread with some jam for breakfast. An hour or two later, have a low-fat 
bran muffin, a banana and some tea. A bit later, have a spinach salad and half a 
sandwich for lunch. Continue like this through the day and avoid eating a heavy 
meal after 7 p.m.
<P> Take a short walk after lunch and dinner. It will help you digest your 
food and burn calories long after the stroll is finished.
<P> Don't snack while watching television, unless you eat grapes, raisins, 
carrot sticks or other veggies and fruits. Chew gum instead of buttered popcorn at 
the movies or ask for a small portion of popcorn without salt or butter.
<P> Drink eight to 10 glasses of water, juice and other decaffeinated 
beverages each day.
<P> Cut out or reduce so-called &quot;empty calories&quot; such as alcohol or rich 
sweets. Try ending a meal with a single mint or a scoop of fruit sorbet. If you drink 
limit yourself to a single glass of beer or wine or one jigger of hard alcohol a day.
<P> In a restaurant, order two appetizers for dinner or split your main dish 
with 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 -->

<BR>
a  companion. Or fill up on soup and a vegetable side dish. (No, not baked 
potato with sour cream and bacon bits.) Ask for lunch or child-size portions or request 
a doggie bag at the outset and immediately stash half your portion for a later meal.
<P> Build a half-hour of moderate exercise into your schedule each day. 
Carry grocery bags, walk up steps, garden, vacuum, rake leaves or walk. Thirty 
minutes of walking each day is just what the doctor ordered. If you feel ambitious, 
add light wrist weights and improve the benefit to your heart and lungs.
<P>If feeling and looking better are not sufficient motivation for cutting the 
fat, three recent studies have shown that leaner is definitely healthier.
<P>One, a 16-year study of 115,000 nurses, showed that the women's risk 
of dying from cardiovascular disease and certain cancers increased significantly 
as their weight went up. The nurses were 30 to 55 when the study began in 
1976. Those who were lean because they smoked or for some other medical reason 
were excluded.
<P>The nurse study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, 
found that being overweight or obese contributed to a surprising one-third of all 
the cancer deaths as well as one-half of all cardiovascular deaths during the 16 
years of the study.
<P>Another study looked at 6,500 Japanese-American men and found 
that healthy men who had never smoked were not necessarily harmed by 
repeated cycles of weight loss and gain. But, once again, this study found that the 
leanest men were also the healthiest and longest-lived.
<P>And finally, first reports from an ongoing study of a group of Harvard 
alumni also indicate that the leanest men have the best health statistics. The men at 
the lowest end of the weight tables had death rates 40 percent lower than the 
heaviest men as they aged, said Walter Willet, a professor at the Harvard School of 
Public Health who also co-authored the nurses' study.

<h1>Brain studies may change theories about aging</h1>
<P>By Joan McQueeney Mitric
<br>Maturity News Service
<P>A brain is a terrible thing to waste. To this, Marian Cleeves Diamond 
readily concurs, saying, &quot;Use it or lose it.&quot;
<P>In three decades of brain research, Diamond has helped revolutionize 
the way we think about aging.
<P>&quot;We now know that with proper stimulation and an enriched 
environment, the human brain can continue to develop at any age,&quot; she said, speaking from 
her office in the university's department of integrative biology.
<P>Her work used middle-aged rats - the equivalent of 60 year-old humans - 
and some with brains corresponding to humans at age 90. In each case, Diamond 
and her colleagues were able to show that with added enrichment - in this 
case, colorful toys and balls, exercise equipment and other stimulating rodents 
for company - the size and cognitive agility of the rats' brains improved.
<P>Rats reared together with a changing variety of toys and other stimuli 
were much better at running mazes than rodents reared in more isolation or deprived 
of stimulation. Their brains also looked different, Diamond said.  They had 
many more branching or sprouting dendrites, nerve cells, blood vessels and a 
thicker cerebral cortex (the area central to thinking skills).
<P>&quot;We used middle-aged rats partly because they have a similar cortex 
to humans,&quot; Diamond said.
<P>At 69, Diamond says it was &quot;comforting to find we can change the brain 
at any age. We're saying that if you use your brain, you can change it as much as 
a younger brain.&quot; She said it may take the older brain longer to respond, but 
change does happen.
<P>She said people would be wise to think of their brain as any other 
muscle. Left in isolation, evidence shows, brain cells begin to shrink and shut down.
<P>These findings are particularly interesting in light of recent studies 
indicating that higher education and/or full development of the brain's cognitive 
abilities early in life may help protect people from the ravages of Alzheimer's in old age.
<P>A landmark study of older nuns who had donated their brains to 
science found that those who showed an early ability to write prose rich in ideas 
and dense in meaning were far less likely to die from Alzheimer's than those 
whose early writing was more impoverished in ideas.
<P>Scientists analyzing the so-called Nuns Study theorize that a more 
fully developed brain may be better able to switch on a sort of reserve power pack 
as one ages, giving it greater ability to ward off neurological invaders, or a 
stronger system for slowing diseases like Alzheimer's.
<P>As early as the 1940s, Yale University child development specialists 
A.L. Gesell documented the withering effect that deprivation, lack of stimulation 
and simple human contact had on infants and young children.
<P>Left unattended in their cribs, with no one speaking to them or 
hugging them, infants gradually took on a wizened, monkeylike appearance. 
Normal development - speech, cooing, talking and crawling - was retarded, and they 
aged physically.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 -->

<P>Today, Diamond and others in the field are convinced the brain's 
development can be altered through early stimulation and reenergized throughout life.
<P>&quot;The common sense brain research began with Gesell, but now we 
have been able to quantify brain changes in the lab,&quot; said Diamond. &quot;Others are 
doing the same in humans.&quot;
<P>At the Berkeley campus, Diamond is something of a legend and a role 
model for older colleagues. Her students lionize her and often interrupt her lectures 
with applause.
<P>In 1981, she was named one of the three most popular college professors 
in the nation. In 1989, the Council for Advancement and Support of 
Education selected her as its California Professor of the Year. This year the UC 
alumni association named her alumna of the year, one of only four women to win 
the honor in the 53 years it's been given.
<P>Outside the classroom, she is a devoted parent, an avid tennis player and 
a hiker who has scaled Kilimanjaro and Mount Whitney as well as many peaks 
in the Rockies and Himalayas. She also paints and sculpts with her husband, 
Arnold Scheibel, UCLA professor of neuroscience and psychiatry.
<P>Diamond says it's time to redefine the notion of retirement, starting with 
the word itself. &quot;We're trying to change the name of `retire' to `redirect'. The one 
has a negative connotation. It means slow down; the other is a challenge to do 
something different,&quot; she said.
<P>&quot;This is important especially if we are genetically programmed to live 
until about 100 and people are still thinking of retiring in the old sense at 60 or 65.&quot;
<P>She has followed her own advice. At 64, she became director of 
Berkeley's Lawrence Hall of Science, a hands-on museum and teaching facility with 
a stunning view of the San Francisco Bay. One of her exhibits there was, 
naturally, on the brain.
<P>Her physician father first piqued her fascination with this vital organ 
when she was a teenager and he took her on rounds at Los Angeles County Hospital. 
<P>Much later, Diamond found out that Albert Einstein's brain was in a jar 
of formaldehyde in Missouri. For years, she tried to get a few slivers of 
the physicist's brain to test a theory of how geniuses' brains differ from 
other people's. Finally the tissue samples arrived in a mayonnaise jar. She tested 
them and discovered that her theory was right.
<P>Now back teaching and doing research, Diamond is looking at the 
cerebral cortex and its role in immune function. This quest is quite personal. She 
hopes her findings will shed light on lupus, an immune system disorder that killed 
her sister and brother.
<P>Researchers already have shown that they can reinvigorate the 
immune system with a transplant from the thymus gland. Diamond says she will focus 
on this fertile area.
<P>&quot;I owe it to my family.&quot;

<h1>Telephone Service Safe and Faster</h1>
<P>By Sandy Taylor
<br>District Manager, SSA
<P>In today's hectic society, using the telephone is a quick, easy way to 
take care of business and Social Security is no exception. You can take care of most 
of your Social Security business by using a toll-free 800 number. But what if the 
call we receive about your Social Security business is not from you? Is your 
personal information safe? The answer is yes.
<P>Social Security recognizes that possibility an imposter may call and try 
to obtain information such as someone's Social Security number, earnings 
record, age, or address. This is why the employees at every Social Security office are 
very careful to verify the identity of the people who call us. If we are unable to do 
so, we request the caller to come into the office.
<P>If you ask a family member or friend to call Social Security for you, 
you need to be with them when they call so we will know that you want them to 
assist you. The Social Security representative will verify your identity and ask 
for permission to discuss your Social Security business with that person.
<P>In the case of a minor child, the natural parent or legal guardian can act 
on the child's behalf in taking care of the child's Social Security business, and 
Social Security takes every precaution to identify this person when they call.
<P>When you call the Social Security toll-free number, 1-800-772-1213, 
you can get information 24 hours daily. You can speak to a service 
representative between the hours of 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. on business days.
<P>Because our lines are often busy early in the day, it is best to call at 
other times such as late in the day, late in the week, and late in the month, if 
possible. Whenever you call, please have your Social Security number handy.
<P>People who are hearing impaired may call our toll-free &quot;TTD&quot; number 
1-800-325-0778, between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. on business days.

<h1>Retirees Should Be Aware of Pension Offset Rules</h1>
<P>By Sandy Taylor
<br>District Manager, SSA
<P>If you expect to receive more than one type of retirement pension, you 
need to know how your Social Security benefits may be affected.
<P>If you are entitled to both Social Security and a pension based on 
your employment from a job not covered under Social Security, your Social 
Security benefit may be reduced.
<P>There are two rules that may reduce your benefit. One, called the 
&quot;Government Pension Offset&quot; applies only if you receive a government pension from a 
job not covered by Social Security and are eligible for Social Security benefits as 
a spouse or widow(er).
<P>This offset will reduce the amount of your Social Security spouse's 
or widow(er)'s benefit by two-thirds of the amount of your government 
pension. Here is an example: if you receive a monthly civil service or P.E.R.A pension 
of $600, two-thirds of that, or $400, must be used to offset your Social 
Security spouse's or widow(er)'s benefit. If you are eligible for a Social Security 
spouse's or widow(er)'s benefit of $500 monthly, you will receive $100 per month 
from Social Security after the offset has been applied ($500 - $400 = $100).
<P>The other rule, called the &quot;Windfall Elimination Provision&quot; affects the 
way your own Social Security retirement or disability benefits are figured if 
you receive a pension from a job that is not covered by Social Security. This 
rule affects the person who spent most of his/her career working in a job not 
covered by Social Security such as civil service or other public employees, but who 
also worked at other jobs where they paid Social Security taxes long enough to 
qualify for Social Security retirement or disability benefits.
<P>Prior to 1983, employees who spent time in jobs not covered by 
Social Security receive the advantage of a formula under which lower-paid 
workers received larger benefits in relation to their earnings than higher paid 
workers. Because of this formula, those who worked only part of their lives in jobs 
covered by Social Security had their benefits figured as if they were long-term, 
low-wage workers. These workers received the advantage of the higher percentage 
Social Security benefits in addition to their other pension. A modified benefit 
formula enacted in 1983 eliminates this windfall.
<P>Here's how the formula works. Social Security benefits are based on 
the worker's average monthly earnings adjusted for inflation. When we figure 
your benefits, we separate your average earnings into three amounts and multiply 
the figures using three factors. For example, for a worker who became 65 in 1995, 
the first $387 of average monthly earnings is multiplied by 90%; the next $1946 
is multiplied by 32%; and the remainder by 15%. In the modified formula, the 
90% factor is reduced. The reduction is phased in for workers who reached age 62 
or became disabled between 1986 and 1989. For those who reach 62 or 
become disabled in 1990 or later, the 90% factor is reduced to 40%.
<P>There are some exceptions to this rule. For example, the 90% factor is 
not reduced if you have 30 or more years of &quot;substantial&quot; earnings where you 
paid 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 -->

<BR>
Social Security taxes. If you have 21 to 29 years of &quot;substantial&quot; earnings, 
the 90% factor is reduced to somewhere between 45 and 85 percent. 
&quot;Substantial&quot; earnings are a certain amount of yearly earnings required for a year of 
coverage for this provision. These &quot;substantial&quot; earnings can be obtained by requesting 
the factsheet titled &quot;A Pension From Work Not Covered By Social Security&quot;.
<P>The modified formula does not apply to survivors benefits. It does not 
apply if you are a federal worker hired after December 31, 1983, or if you were 
employed on December 31, 1983, by a non-profit organization that was exempt 
from Social Security and it became mandatorily covered under Social Security on 
that date. There are certain other cases where the modified formula does not apply.
<P>A guarantee is provided to protect workers with relatively low pension. 
It provides that the reduction in the Social Security benefit under the 
modified formula cannot be more than one-half of &quot;that part of the pension attributable 
to earnings after 1956 not covered by Social Security.&quot;
<P>If you have any questions on these rules or would like a fact sheet on 
either the &quot;Government Pension Offset&quot; or the &quot;Windfall Elimination Provision&quot;, 
call Social Security toll-free at 1-800-772-1213 Monday through Friday from 7 a.m. 
to 7 p.m.

<H1>Medicare Hospice Benefits</H1>
<P>By Sandy Taylor
<br>District Manager, SSA
<P>One of the less known Medicare provisions is providing relief to 
terminally ill patients, particularly those who prefer to spend their final days in the 
comfort of their home. Medicare's hospice care eases the stress for both the patient 
and the family through special services and care.
<P>Hospice care is a special type of care for people who are terminally ill. 
It includes both home care and inpatient care, and a variety of services not 
normally covered under Medicare. There are no deductibles and Medicare pays for 
services provided every day by a hospice. This program also permits a hospice to 
provide appropriate personal care, including homemaker services and counseling.
<P>A hospice may be a public agency or a private organization that 
provides care for terminally ill patients. It is not a hospital. The terminally ill patient 
can be cared for at home or as an inpatient in the hospice. This hospice also 
provides respite care, not to exceed five consecutive days, so the home caregiver, usually 
a spouse or relative, can have a few days off.
<P>Medicare's Hospital Insurance (Part A) will pay for hospice care if the 
three following conditions are met: A doctor certifies that the patient is terminally 
ill; <U>and</U>, the patient chooses to receive care from a hospice instead of a hospital; 
<U>and</U>, care is provided by a Medicare participating hospice program.
<P>In addition to doctor and nursing services, the hospice provides other 
Medicare covered services including medications, home health aide and 
homemaker visits, medical and social services, medical equipment, short-term inpatient 
care, and counseling for the patient and the caregivers.
<P>The hospice benefit covers a seven month period. This time can be 
continuous or, if the patient chooses, may be used in two 90-day periods, and then a 
30-day period. If necessary, this time can be extended. The patient may stop 
the hospice benefit period, return to regular Medicare coverage, and then start 
the hospice benefit again if another benefit period is available. The patient pays 
$5 towards each prescription, and five percent of the Medicare allowed rate 
for respite care, approximately $5. If a patient needs treatment for a condition 
not related to the terminal illness, Medicare continued to help pay for all 
necessary covered services under the standard Medicare benefit program.
<P>If you have any questions regarding Medicare and hospice benefits, 
please call Social Security toll-free at 1-800-772-1213 or Medicare toll-free at 
1-800-332-6681.

<B><H1>Higher Social Security earnings cap is finally law</H1></B>
<P>By Mary Beth Franklin
<BR>Maturity News Service
<P>Beginning this year, nearly a million seniors who continue to work past 
the normal retirement age can earn more money without jeopardizing their 
Social Security benefits. That's because after years of debate, Congress finally passed a law that will significantly raise the Social Security earnings cap, a Depression-era 
incentive designed to drive older people out of the work force to free up jobs for the young.
<P>But times have changed since that law was enacted in 1935. Rather than 
a shortage of jobs, many business owners - particularly in the retail, restaurant 
and hospitality industries, are complaining about a shortage of skilled workers 
and have turned to hiring retirees.
<P>&quot;Raising the earnings test will increase the standard of living of the 
elderly and help the nation's economy,&quot; President Bill Clinton remarked as he signed 
the bill into law on March 29.
<P>Business owners lamented to a congressional panel last year that many 
of their best older employees have had to cut back on hours or quit halfway 
through the year to avoid onerous cuts in their Social Security benefits.
<P>And many Social Security beneficiaries complained that while they 
were willing to work to make ends meet, the earnings test creates a financial 
burden they cannot afford. An estimated 900,000 workers over 65 lose part or all of 
their Social Security benefits each year because of the earnings restrictions.
<P>Under the earnings cap, Social Security benefits are reduced when 
recipients earn over a certain amount each year. The new law gradually increases 
that ceiling over the next seven years until it reaches $30,000 by the year 2002 - 
more than double what it would have been under the old law. 
<P>This year, workers age 65 to 69 can earn up to $12,500 with no change 
in their Social Security benefit. That's about $1,000 more than in 1995.
<P>"That's cold, hard cash they have earned through honest, hard work," 
observed House sponsor Rep. Dennis Hastert, R-IL., following the bill 
signing ceremony. "These seniors need and deserve relief." Workers earning more 
than the new limit will continue to lose $1 in benefits for every $3 earned over 
the limit.
<P>The earnings limit will continue to rise, reaching $13,500 in 1997, 
$14,500 in 1998, $15,500 in 1999, $17,000 in 2000, $25,000 in 2001 and $30,000 in 2002.
<P>After 2002, the limit will continue to be adjusted annually to reflect 
average wage increase.
<P>Supporters of the earnings cap increase pointed out that only older 
Americans who work are penalized by the earnings test, since seniors with income 
from other sources can receive any amount without jeopardizing their Social 
Security benefits.
<P>"Older individuals who are not fortunate enough to have a private pension 
or much in the way of savings should be rewarded, not penalized for wanting to 
be self-sufficient," said Horace Deets, executive director of the American 
Association of Retired Persons (AARP).
<P>"Raising the earnings limit is good common sense because both 
employers and employees benefit," Deets said.&quot;Older Americans have the skills, expertise, and enthusiasm that 
employers value.&quot;
<P>The Social Security Administration estimates that 65 percent of those 
who will benefit the most from the higher earnings limits when they are fully 
effective in 2002 will be retirees with earnings of more than $48,000 a year.
<P>The new law does not change limits already imposed for workers age 
62 through 64, which are more restrictive than those for older workers. However, 
as in the past, those limits are also adjusted every year to reflect increases in wages.
<P>This year, Social Security recipients under 65 who earn more than 
$8,280 will lose $1 in benefits for every $2 they earn over the limit.
<P>Under both the old and new laws, there is no earnings cap for people 70 
or older, who can earn any amount of income from any source without any loss 
of Social Security benefits.
<P>Seniors who work while getting Social Security benefits still must pay 
Social Security taxes on anything they earn over $400 a year.
<P>Even if their benefits are reduced because of the earnings cap, they are 
still subject to the same tax, which can be as high as 15.3 percent of earnings for 
self-employed seniors. That's because the self-employed must pay both the 
employer and employee portions of the Social Security tax.
<P>Higher-income seniors also pay income tax on up to 85 percent of 
Social Security income.
<P>The Congressional Research Service has estimated that in certain 
cases, when all federal, state and local taxes and benefit losses are considered, the 
effect on seniors whose wages exceed the earnings cap can be equivalent to a 90 
percent marginal tax rate.

<h1>Finding good home health aid takes work</h1>
<p>By Mary Beth Franklin
<br>Maturity News Service

<p>For many elderly people, the availability of someone to help them a few hours a day with personal care or household chores can mean the difference between continuing to live at home or moving into a nursing home. 
<p>Home-based care is a new and growing field and many of the services are unregulated. Here are some tips on finding an appropriate care provider and paying for that care:
<ul>
<p><li>
 <i>Consider community resources first.</i>
Contact your local Area Agency on Aging, often listed in the phone directory under "senior services" or "human services." Almost every county has one to help seniors remain independent in their own homes. Explain the need for home care and seek recommendations of service providers. A social worker usually will visit to assess the elderly person's needs.
<p>Some services provided by local aging agencies, such as transportation, home-delivered meals and help with household chores, may be available for free or at modest cost, depending on the person's income. 
<p>Long-distance caregivers can call the Eldercare Locator at 800-677-1116 to find the appropriate state or local agency to arrange service for an older person in need of assistance.
<p><li> <i>Private home-care services.</i>
Some people may not qualify for government programs or may require more help than local aging agencies offer. They, or their family members, may have to look for private home care services providers. Check your phone directory under "personal care services" or "home care services."
<p>Home care aides run the gamut from companions and housekeeping aides to those who help with personal care such as bathing, dressing and grooming. Fees usually run from $10 to $16 an hour. People with specific health problems may require a visiting nurse.
<p>In exploring home-based care, check whether the service you contact is an agency, which screens, trains and supervises its employees, or merely a registry of independent caregivers.
Also ask if the service is licensed - if required in your state - and accredited by a professional association, indicating a higher standard of quality.
<p>"Usually, the people who are referred instead of being employed are cheaper," said Margaret Terry, executive director of Homemaker Health Aide Services of the National Capital Area, a home care agency in Washington, D.C.
<p>"But the less costly person comes with a potentially big price," she said. Terry explained that if one of her employees is unable to visit a client on a particular day, a replacement is found. And if an aide is injured on the job, such as hurting her back when trying to lift an elderly person out of bed, the agency - not the client - is liable.
<p>When you hire an independent caregiver, you become the employer. That means you are liable for injuries, for withholding Social Security taxes, and for filing the proper tax documents. (To learn more about tax responsibilities of employers of household help, call the IRS toll free at 800-829-3676 and request Publication 907.)
<p>Some people find, however, that less expensive independent caregivers are the only way they can afford home-based care. An excellent book on the subject, "Home Care for Older People," discusses the advantages and disadvantages of various home care options and how to find needed help. For a copy, send $12 ot United Senior Health Cooperative, 1331 H. Street, N.W., Suite 500, Washington, D.C. 20005.
<p><li> <i>Paying for care.</i>
Once you find the home-based care you need, the next challenge is paying for it.
Medicare, the government's health care program for those 65 and over, does not cover long-term care or help with personal or household services. However, Medicare will pay for home care services related to acute, short-term health problems if a person is homebound, under a physician's care, and needs part-time or intermittent skilled nursing services or physical or speech therapy.
<p>Private insurance pays very few home care costs. Some newer supplemental medical insurance policies, known as medigap, offer limited coverage for home care, but only when a patient is also receiving Medicare.
<p>Private long-term care insurance policies often cover home-based care. But these policies are still so new and relatively expensive that only a small percentage of the elderly have them. The bottom line is that if you need private home care services, you're probably going to have to pay for it yourself. That may mean liquidating assets or engaging in some creative financing, such as applying for a reverse mortgage where the lender pays the homeowner.

<H1>Social Security and Family Values</H1>
<P>By Sandy Taylor
<br>District Manager, SSA
<P>Many people think of Social Security as a retirement program. But 
Social Security plays a role in most people's lives. It provides valuable protection 
for you and your family against the loss of income resulting from your 
retirement, death or disability. Forty percent of the 42 million people receiving Social 
Security benefits are not retired workers, they are the spouses and children of 
retired workers or are receiving disability or survivors benefits as the spouse, 
children, widow(er) or parents of retired, deceased, or disabled workers.
<P>When a worker's earnings stop or are decreased because of retirement, 
long-term disability, or death, Social Security benefits replace a portion of the 
earnings. How important is this protection to the average person? About 42 
percent of men and 30 percent of women will die or become disabled before 
reaching their retirement years. About 98 percent of the children under 18 and 
their mothers or fathers (with children under age 16) can count on monthly 
cash benefits if a working parent dies. About four out of five men and women 
between 21 and 64 can count on monthly cash benefits if the wage earner 
becomes disabled.
<P>Benefits paid to the worker with a spouse and two or more children 
may replace as much as 90 percent of prior earnings for low income families. 
In 1994, the average family benefit paid to a widow(er) and two children 
was $1,328; for a disabled worker and spouse with one or more children it 
was $1,088. The maximum benefit payable to a widower and two children of 
a worker who died at age 25 was $2,430 and $2,073 for a worker who 
became disabled at age 25 with one child.
<P>To qualify for retirement benefits, a worker needs to have worked at least 
10 years in a job covered under Social Security. The worker can qualify for 
survivors and disability benefits for his or her family with as little as 1-1/2 
years of work. The amount of work needed increases depending on the 
worker's age at the time of death or disability.
<P>Benefits are paid to children, wives and husbands, widows and 
widowers, whether divorced or still married, on the earnings record of an insured 
worker. Grandchildren and dependent parents of a deceased worker may also qualify 
for benefits under certain circumstances.
<P>You should know about Social Security benefits when you make plans 
for your family's financial future. Social Security provides a base of income, it 
does not completely replace earnings. You need to know how much you and/or 
your family can expect from Social Security. Call Social Security toll-free at 
1-800-772-1213 from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. and request a 
Personal Earnings and Benefit Estimate Statement. Complete the form and in about 3 weeks you will 
receive information as to how much you and your family could receive in benefits.
<P>If you have any questions regarding Social Security benefits for you or 
your family, or have any other Social Security questions, please call toll-free at 
1-800-772-1213.

<H1>CPI change could lower Social Security increases</H1>
<P>By Peter Vilbig
<BR>Maturity News Service
<P>For months, the debate on cutting the federal budget has focused mainly 
on Medicare and Medicaid. But a proposal to chop the Consumer Price Index, 
which measures inflation and helps determine cost-of-living increases for Social 
Security, could also have lasting effects on seniors well into the aging of the 
Baby Boom.
<P>The CPI is a measure, compiled by the government, of the costs of a 
wide variety of goods. In recent years, there has been a growing belief among 
economists that the rate overshoots actual inflation. The index exceeds the true 
cost-of-living increase by half of 1 percent to 2 percent, according to a 
Senate-appointed panel of economists whose report was released in September.
<P>Some on Capitol Hill, desperate to find the $894 billion Republicans 
insist must be cut to balance the budget by 2002, have turned to the idea of 
correcting the CPI as a way to avoid deep cuts in Medicare, Medicaid and other 
spending programs.
<P>Lowering the CPI by 1 percent would save about $281 billion in 
federal spending over seven years. That's nearly one-third of the total cuts needed 
to balance the budget under Republican plans. 
<P>The idea of revising the CPI is supported by Sen. Daniel Patrick 
Moynihan, D-NY, and by another group of 22 conservative House Democrats calling 
itself the Coalition and also known as the Blue Dog Democrats.
<P>In addition, a bipartisan proposal from the National Governor's 
Association, which represents both Democratic and Republican governors, has also 
urged correcting the CPI.
<P>Supporters of the concept point out that the average retiree would lose 
only $7 a month in the first year of the cut. And they argue that the overstatement 
in the CPI is costing billions in what amounts to a kind of bonus payment to 
millions of seniors.
<P>"We are at an impasse"; Moynihan said. "We need money. I think this is 
the only way we can get out of this."
<P>But opponents of the proposal - including most senior groups - oppose 
any cut remotely approaching the 1 percent level. They say the effects will 
compound over time, so that in the 10th year, the average retiree would be losing $107 
a month - equal to about 5 percent of income for a retired family with an income 
of $20,000.
<P>Some economists also question that present cost-of-living adjustments 
are too high. They argue that while the CPI may be inaccurate for some 
wage-earners, it probably is more accurate for many middle- and lower-income retirees and for poor workers - those most likely to be affected by cuts in inflation adjustments.
<P>One of the main reasons economists believe the CPI is overstated is 
that buyers today substitute less costly goods when prices rise for some other items.
<P>But, said Merton Bernstein, an economist and law professor at 
Washington University in St. Louis, "There's a real question whether the beneficiaries of 
the programs affected fit the CPI analysis. The poor don't have choices that the 
rest of us do."
<P>For example, Bernstein said, well-to-do people may be able to choose 
among a variety of supermarkets, but poor and elderly people often simply don't have 
the mobility to get around that well.
<P>"Many of them have to go to so-called convenience stores,&quot; he said. &quot;So 
they don't have the substitution effect."
<P>In addition, seniors often are unable to get to discount stores, which 
are "primarily a suburban institution," said Bernstein. "If you're stuck in the 
central cities, as an undue proportion of minority and elderly people are, you're out 
of luck."
<P>Proponents of a corrected CPI counter that elderly people don't face 
many costs that younger people must pay where inflation is a factor, such as 
transportation to and from work and clothing costs associated with work.
<P>But Bernstein points out that older people also have expenses that 
young people don't, such as higher medical bills.
<P>In the current budget-balancing effort, Bernstein says, seniors are 
being expected to absorb too many of the cuts in government spending.
<P>"It's amazing and appalling, at a time when people are talking about 
equal sacrifice, (that) the major so-called savings are in those programs that affect 
the poor and the elderly."
<P>The Blue Dog Democrats have advanced their own budget balancing 
proposal. Their plan would reduce the CPI by only one-half of 1 percent. 
<P>At least some adjustment to the CPI seems likely to emerge from 
budget negotiations. Clinton administration proposals have called for small reductions 
of a quarter of a percent or less.
<P>Regardless of what happens in the budget debate, the odds seem high 
that the debate over CPI-based cost-of-living increases will likely go on as the 
government continues to struggle in coming years with the challenge of 
balancing budgets.
<P>With 42 million recipients of various Social Security benefits, all of 
which are tied to yearly cost-of-living adjustments, a mathematical reality emerges.
<P>"You multiply even small amounts by 42 million and you've got big 
bucks," said Bernstein.

<h3>Links</h3>
The most common way to indicate a link is by highlighting text in blue and underlining it.<p>

<a href="index.htm">This link takes you to the <strong>Oregon Welcomes You!</strong> home page.</a><p>

<H1>The Travel Industry Council of Oregon</H1>

<P>
The Travel Industry Council of Oregon is a non-profit, state-wide
visitor industry association comprised of all private sector segments
representing the visitor industry in Oregon.
<P>
The organization is funded through membership subscriptions, grants
and special events.  In the past, it had principally served as
a lobbying agency for the Oregon Tourism Division, and been active
in legislative affairs.  Beginning in 1995, the association embraced
a much broader role as the private sector partner of the new Oregon
Tourism Commission (formerly Oregon Tourism Division).  After
successfully securing a Key Industries grant, the Council took
over the Visitor Industry Awareness campaign from the Commission.
 Other projects include linking the industry electronically, managing
the industry Workforce 2000 program, and continuing its legislative
lobbying efforts.
<P>
Future plans call for the Council to become fully independent
from the Oregon Lodging Association with separate offices and
paid staff to manage the ongoing activities and programs of the
association.  It will also be responsible for soliciting and securing
long-term funding for its own sustainability and for funding the
public/private account designated for Oregon's tourism efforts
by the 1995 legislature.
<H2>Mission Statement</H2>

<P>
It is the mission of the Travel Industry Council of Oregon to
cooperatively promote and ensure the economic vitality of Oregon's
visitor industry through leadership, advocacy, communication,
and education.
<H2>Objectives</H2>

<OL>
<LI>To provide a leadership role for the visitor industry in the
state of Oregon by communicating the economic benefits of tourism
to the people of Oregon, its governmental entities, and agencies.
<LI>To develop and implement programs which will educate all affected
audiences, public and private, of the economic value and contribution
the organization makes toward achieving its goals.
<LI>To work toward ensuring stable funding sources for the promotion
of Oregon's visitor industry.
<LI>To support and improve the balanced growth and development
of the visitor industry in Oregon.
<LI>To establish a working relationship between the State of Oregon
and the visitor industry for the promotion of tourism.
<LI>To promote and provide a forum for the exchange of information
and the discussion of tourism matters by associations and others
interested in the visitor industry.
<LI>To promote common business interests and improve business
conditions in the visitor industry.
<LI>To foster and promote public respect for the visitor industry.

<H1>The Oregon Tourism Research File</H1>

<P>
The Tourism Commission's research file contains a variety of information
on the visitor industry, and is available for your use.  Reports
produced by regional tourism organizations include, for example,
a report on Columbia Gorge residents' attitudes toward visitors.
 There are studies on the Oregon Coast and many other parts of
Oregon, economic research reports that analyze the effect of tourism
on Oregon, and strategies for future development of the industry.
 Out-of-state reports and reports on international tourism are
also available.
<P>
Various studies produced by the Department of Transportation have
been completed and are in the Commission's research file, including
studies on scenic byways and transportation improvement.
<P>
The Tourism Commission pays membership dues to several visitor
industry organizations in order to receive up-to-date tourism
and travel information.  The Travel and Tourism Research Association,
for example, sends out quarterly reports about the visitor industry.
 Other reports on file include Travel Industry Indicators (produced
monthly), and the U.S. Travel Data Center's series of reports
dating back to 1984.  Of these, the <I>Discover America 2000 </I>report
focuses on the implications of America's changing demographics
and attitudes about tourism and there are many other titles in
the series, including  <I>Tourism and Environment</I>.  Another
report, <I>1995 Outlook for Travel and Tourism,</I> includes the
proceedings from the 20th Annual Travel Outlook Forum.
<P>
All of these reports are available for your use at the Tourism
Commission.  If you are interested in borrowing some of these
materials, please call Doris Nelson at 503-986-0003.

<H1>Resident Attitude Survey</H1>

<P>
This is a survey of voters in Oregon who live outside the Portland
Metro  area (A separate survey was conducted in the tri-county
area).  It was conducted by Moore Information, Incorporated, an
independent, public opinion research company located in Portland,
Oregon.
<H2>Summary</H2>

<P>
Nearly nine-in-ten voters believe the visitor industry plays an
important role in the economy of their part of Oregon.  Further,
almost eight-in-ten believe it is appropriate for local governments
to promote tourism and rougly six-in-ten are aware that spending
generated by visitors creates tax revenues.
<P>
Additional evidence that the visitor industry is perceived as
important to voters was seen in that more than seven-in-ten find
benefits in the influx of people who visit our state, and roughly
two-thirds agree that the visitor industry is an important source
of jobs and new money.  A majority perceive the visitor industry
as less harmful to the state's quality of life than other industries,
and at the same time, while the visitor industry is perceived
more stable than the forest products industry, voters are less
convinced that the industry is more stable than the high-tech
or agriculture industries.
<P>
Looking at perceptions of visitor behavior, more than six-in-ten
Oregonians expect to travel within the state this year, and most
of them plan to spend at least one night away from home.  Interestingly,
70% of voters believe many of the people who visit the state end
up moving here, and voters are more likely than not to view this
as negative.
<P>
Finally, less than one-in-five (16%) respondents work for a business
or company which provides services to visitors.  
<P>

<H1>Talking Points on Tourism: State</H1>

<P>
As Oregon's economy continues to diversify, tourism plays a vital
role in creating new job opportunities and strengthening local
and regional economies.
<P>
In 1993, nearly $3.4 billion was generated statewide from visitor
expenditures, an 8.2% increase over 1992 expenditures.  Preliminary
estimates for 1994 indicate that expenditures increased 5.6% between
1993 and 1994.  This confirms that the visitor industry is not
only a key economic force in Oregon, but a significant growth
industry as well.
<P>
In addition to direct impacts, employment and revenue in support
sectors such as business services, utilities, and personal services
are significant.
<P>
Oregon's visitor industry provides important entry-level jobs
as well as increasing opportunities in managerial and professional
positions.  It also provides important transferable skills and
employment for women and minorities entering the job market.
<P>
Interestingly, tourism employment has grown at a slower rate than
payroll and travel spending, which in part reflects rising average
wage rates in the industry.  As the Oregon visitor industry matures,
so do the quantity, and particularly, the quality of jobs.
<P>
Between 1987 and 1994, growth in the tourism industry in Oregon
has shown substantial increases, as indicated by the statistics
below, not adjusted for inflation (prepared by Dean Runyan Associates):

<H2>Why Tourism in Oregon?</H2>

<UL>
<LI>Compatible with Oregon's commitment to a high quality of life
and protection of the natural environment.
<LI>Positive return on investment:
<UL>
<LI>For every dollar the Tourism Commission invests in advertising,
$19-$20 in new visitor revenue is returned to the state.
<LI>For every dollar the Tourism Commission invests in the State
Welcome Centers, $41 in new visitor revenue is added to the state's
economy.
</UL>

<LI>Helps rural economies diversify; links rural and urban areas.
<LI>Encourages regional partnerships and private-public cooperative
ventures.
<LI>Provides entrepreneurial opportunities (nearly 75 percent
of Oregon's visitor-industry businesses have a &quot;working proprietor&quot;
whose average family income is $39,768 per year).
<LI>Showcases the state and often leads to other business developments.
<LI>Generates more than $3 billion per year for local, county,
and state governments and private-sector businesses.
<LI>As tourism grows, investments in facility developments improve
the quality of life for all Oregonians.  Since 1990, these major
new attractions have been added to our product inventory:
<UL>
<LI>Oregon Convention Center, Portland (Sept. 1990)
<LI>Oregon Coast Aquarium, Newport (May 1992)
<LI>Oregon Trail Interpretive Center, Baker City (May 1992)
<LI>New OMSI, Portland (October 1992)
<LI>Museum at Warm Springs (March 1993)
<LI>Pacific Northwest Museum of Natural History, Ashland (July
1994)
</UL>

</UL>

<P>
<BR>

<H2>The Outlook?</H2>

<UL>
<LI>Nationally, the tourism industry is predicted to grow at 4
percent annually through 1995-Oregon has grown at a higher rate
than this over the past seven years.
<LI>Special-interest travel (ecotourism, heritage tourism, adventure
tourism) will become more important-Oregon's outdoor activities,
diverse natural beauty and historic attractions will be sought
after.
<LI>Cost-effective, safe, family-oriented destinations will become
increasingly popular into the next century.
</UL>

<P>

<H2>The Challenges?</H2>

<UL>
<LI>Ensuring that new facility development includes long-term
marketing support and operations funding.
<LI>Training and preparing the visitor-industry workforce; creating
career ladders and advancement opportunities in the industry.
<LI>Seeking public-private partnerships to alleviate housing shortages
during peak seasons and in primary tourism destinations.
<LI>Maintaining local, state and regional visitor promotion budgets
during difficult fiscal situations, and forming partnerships to
fund tourism marketing and development projects.
<LI>&quot;Internationalizing&quot; Oregon to better serve and
welcome international visitors.
<LI>Seeking ways to expand off-season tourism and alleviate congestion
during peak seasons at primary locations.
<LI>Encouraging more &quot;packaging&quot; of the Oregon tourism
product, making it easier for consumers and the travel trade to
purchase Oregon travel packages.

<H1>Sample Speech Outline</H1>

<P>
It's probably no surprise to many of you that tourism is growing
in Oregon-between 1987 and 1993, just six years:
<UL>
<LI>Overall economic impact has increased 89%, from $1.8 billion
to more than $3.4 billion annually.
<LI>Our growth rate between 1992 and 1993 was 8.2%.  This compares
with 1.5% for California and 2.4% for Washington.
<LI>Employment has grown from 38,500 people to 54,532-a 41% increase.
<LI>Payroll has increased 81%, from $355 million to $642 million
<LI>And local room tax receipts have risen 97%, from $20 million
in 1987-1988 to $39.4 million in 1992-93.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
This area is certainly no stranger to this growth.
<P>
In the past few years, Oregon has witnessed unprecedented growth
in new visitor facilities:
<UL>
<LI>The expansions at the High Desert Museum
<LI>Oregon Coast Aquarium
<LI>Oregon Trail Interpretive Center near Baker City
<LI>Museum at Warm Springs
<LI>New OMSI and Oregon Convention Center in Portland
<LI>The Pacific Northwest Museum of Natural History in Ashland
<LI>The End of the Trail Interpretive Center in Oregon City
<LI>The reopening of the Crater Lake Lodge
</UL>

<P>

<P>
...just to name the biggest.  However, many more smaller projects,
from marina improvements to historic building renovations, to
scenic driving tours to plain old better marketing, have resulted
in a far more developed, comprehensive, and sophisticated visitor
industry throughout Oregon.
<P>
In spite of this undeniable growth in visitor activity throughout
Oregon, tourism continues to be the &quot;Rodney Dangerfield&quot;
of Oregon's leading industries and &quot;gets no respect.&quot;
 As tourism professionals, we constantly hear:
<UL>
<LI>&quot;Tourism jobs are all low-paying.&quot;
<LI>&quot;Tourism is a seasonal industry.&quot;
<LI>&quot;Why market Oregon?  People will come here anyway.&quot;
</UL>

<P>

<P>
Well, I'm here to tell you that tourism is not only important,
it is a critical part of Oregon's future, just as it is for our
national economy.
<P>
Did you know that tourism is the top export industry in the United
States?  
<P>
The travel industry is just like any other company marketing a
product on the shelf-if we want to compete in the marketplace
we have to be aggressive, innovative, and pay attention to trends.

<H1>Oregon's International Visitors</H1>

<P>
A number of international markets hold significant promise for
Oregon: Canada, Japan, Germany, and the United Kingdom in particular.
 Research has shown that while international visitors comprise
only nine percent of Oregon's out-of-state visitors (and five
percent of total visitors), international visitors represent a
growth market for Oregon.  In addition:
<UL>
<LI>The average foreign visitor stays longer (11 days in Oregon)
and spends more ($96 per day) than domestic out-of-state visitors
(7.5 days and $84 per day).
<LI>International visitors tend to be younger, have a college
degree (59%), and hold a white-collar job (78%).
<LI>International visitors are more likely to be visiting Oregon
for the first time (53%) than domestic out-of-state visitors (30%).
</UL>

<P>

<H1>Oregon's Group Tour Market</H1>

<P>
The Oregon visitor industry has been actively involved in group
tour business for many years.  The term &quot;group business&quot;
includes tour operators, wholesalers, receptive operators, group
travel leaders, travel agents and their clientele.  In addition,
market segments encompass international and domestic tours, intermodal,
and fly/drive travel.
<P>
<B>The group market has many advantages:</B>
<UL>
<LI>40+ people are usually booked at once.
<LI>The business is easy to book, service, and track.
<LI>Groups cause less wear and tear on the local infrastructure
and are environmentally smart.
<LI>Groups have a strong economic impact in communities.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
<B>However, along with these benefits, there are challenges:</B>
<UL>
<LI>Most group tours travel on scheduled departures.
<LI>Itineraries tend to be inflexible and structured.
<LI>Facilities must usually be able to accomodate 40+ people at
one time.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
<B>There are several questions a business or community should
ask themselves before they pursue the group tour market:</B>
<OL>
<LI>Can the hotels/motels in the area accommodate groups, and
of what size?  Do they accept vouchers?  Will they direct bill?
<LI>Will the attractions in the area accept vouchers and develop
a group registration or entrance policy that is quick, efficient,
and welcoming?
<LI>Do restaurants have seating for approximately 40 people, or
group seating areas?  Are there set or limited menus?
<LI>What is the distance to the next attraction (natural or man-made)?
 What is the competition?
</OL>

<P>

<P>
<B>When selecting the itinerary for a tour, the operator will
seek the following:</B>
<UL>
<LI>What is available and unique in the region
<LI>The nature of the facilities or service
<LI>Quality customer service and price
<LI>Deposits and billing information
<LI>Frequent and open communication
</UL>

<P>

<P>
Tour clients include, but are not limited to: seniors, youth,
special interest groups (such as gaming enthusiasts, jazz lovers,
square dancers, etc.) and international visitors.  Tour operators
reach these clients through direct mail, advertising, travel agents
and consumer shows.  They expect us, the business (supplier) or
community (destination), to assist them with marketing, including
tools to sell their tours (videos, brochures, slides, etc.) and
to generate interest in the area.

<H1>Oregon Visitor Profile</H1>

<H2>Who Are They?</H2>

<P>
The average out-of-state visitor is a middle-aged, married Caucasian
who is affluent, has high educational attainment, and holds a
white collar job.
<H2>Where Do They Come From?</H2>

<P>
The majority of the out-of-state visitors are from Western states,
mainly Oregon's neighboring states: Washington (23%), California
(22%), and Idaho (4%).  
<H2>What Are Their Trip Characteristics?</H2>

<H3>How do they plan their trip?</H3>

<P>
Among out-of-state visitors to Oregon, the most important source
of information used to plan a trip to the state is friends and
relatives.
<H3>What mode of transportation do they use?</H3>

<P>
The prevalent mode of transportation to Oregon by out-of-staters

<B>Tourism Industry Launches Statewide Awareness Campaign</B>
<P>
Oregonians will soon be reminded of tourism's importance to the
nearly 60,000 Oregonians employed in the visitor industry.  The
goal of the Visitor Industry Awareness &quot;VIA&quot; Campaign
is to better educate people within Oregon's borders of tourism's
role in the economy and how it contributes to Oregonians' quality
of life.  Banners, bumper stickers and public service announcements
will blitz the state this spring, and organizers are hoping that
residents will take notice and learn about the $3.6 billion visitors
spend in Oregon each year.  
<P>
Tourism is one of Oregon's largest industries and the second largest
world-wide.  Yet funds for tourism marketing remain scarce, both
at the local and statewide levels.  
<P>
<B>Insert quote from local tourism industry authority regarding
funding sources, budget restrictions, number of visitors to the
community each year, and economic impact locally.</B>
<P>
At the statewide level, Oregon ranks 45th in comparison with other
states' tourism marketing budgets.
<P>
&quot;A lot of Oregonian's enjoy the state's world-class museums,
convention centers, quaint gift shops, state parks, restaurants,
ski areas and events offered throughout the state, but few realize
that many of these attractions couldn't survive if it weren't
for visitors coming into the state and supporting the facilities,&quot;
says Sue Pickell, president of the Travel Industry Council of
Oregon.  &quot;Our job is to let Oregonians know that many people
in non-traditional tourism roles, such as graphic designers, chefs,
bus drivers, utility workers and architects are indirectly employed
by the industry, and that for every dollar spent on marketing
to visitors, $20 is returned.&quot;
<P>
<B>Local quote regarding local VIA Campaign activities, hoteliers/restaurateurs
who are placing the VIA sticker on their window and pledging their
support, etc.***</B>
<P>
     
<P>
The Travel Industry Council of Oregon is a non-profit entity consisting
of associations and organizations that benefit from the visitor
industry.

<br><HR>
<H1>What is Media Relations?</H1>

<P>
Media relations consists of interacting with the media, seeking
publicity or responding to a journalist's needs.   A subset of
public relations, media relations entails engaging a journalist's
interest so that the journalist will write/produce a story that
will reach your customer.  Typically, coordinating media relations
is one of the most difficult activities, because of the need to
find a willing journalist and generate interest in the story before
it ever reaches the public.
<H2>What does it take to initiate and manage a media relations
campaign?</H2>

<P>
Such a campaign requires a belief in the story you're selling,
the ability to think quickly and provide many angles to the story,
creativity, honesty in telling your story, likeability and patience.
 As in the case of all marketing activities, do what you do well.
 Don't try to be someone you're not.  If the idea of meeting a
journalist in person to pitch a story frightens you  (although
after meeting a few journalists you'll find them to be human and
usually very nice people), then perhaps sending a press release
and following up with a call is a better way for you to work.
 If you don't have great color slides or photos, then don't enclose
them.  Again, do what you do well-and just do it!  
<P>
Good public relations professionals must truly believe in the
story (their product or service), or they will often be viewed
as a hired gun that is simply out to do a job.  Someone who believes
in the story has an infectious enthusiasm which definitely helps
to sell a story.  
<P>
Most public relations people are able to quickly bypass one story
angle when it is obviously not of interest to a particular journalist
and present another &quot;hook,&quot; or even a completely different
story.  They are also able to find a legitimate story in ideas,
products and events that are, on the surface, ordinary.  Media
relations is sales!  
<P>
Honesty is very important.  Don't bend the facts under pressure
or make up an answer to convey the image of being an expert. 
Credibility is what the journalist is looking for, so tell the
truth, give good leads and recommend quality visitor attractions.
<P>
Likeability is another key to success in your business.  While
it's critical that you be an expert in the area of your product
or service, you should not appear overly bold or directive (i.e.,
&quot;Of course, you must do this story!&quot;).  
<P>
Although approaching journalists can seem intimidating, don't
feel that you must have a slick presentation.  Honesty and a down-to-earth
nature can be a great asset, especially considering that most
journalists are inundated by material from large PR firms on a
 daily basis.  
<P>
Patience and persistence are also important, since the primary
goal of media relations is to create good, long-term working relationships
with journalists.  If a particular story doesn't work for a specific
journalist or media outlet, accept that fact and target other
media outlets.  Maintain a solid working relationship with all
contacts for future stories.  Also, keep in mind that magazines
may have a lead time of 18 months to two years.

<br><HR>

<H1>How to Organize an Event</H1>

<H2>1. Mission</H2>

<P>
Why are you staging an event? What is your goal:  fundraising,
awareness building, generating attention, attracting visitors,
educating, building community pride?
<H2>2. Theme</H2>

<P>
What is the cohesive theme that pulls the event together?  Arts,
children, time of year, entertainment?  Local activity, such as
a rodeo or harvest, or national celebration, such as the Fourth
of July?  What makes your event unique from other events?
<H2>3. Committee</H2>

<P>
Successful events are multi-faceted.  Few can be staged by one
coordinator.  It takes a team to pull together the details and
community support necessary for an event.  Select chairpersons
based on experience, ability to follow through and connections.
<P>
Sub-committees cover such areas as:  finance, publicity/marketing,
food, security, permits/regulations, first aid, guest services,
clean-up.
<H2>4. Work Calendar </H2>

<P>
Before choosing your event date, do a little research.  There's
nothing more frustrating than discovering too late that your event
conflicts with a major festival, holiday or committee meeting.
 Once you've chosen a free date for your event, work backwards
from the date to assign completion times to each activity.  Then,
move those dates back another two weeks to allow the extra time
that will probably be needed for each task.
<P>
The work calendar should include marketing, budget updates, outreach
to event facilitators (printers, permitting agencies, advertising
agencies, stage/ light/sound/tent vendors, food/beverage coordinators,
fencing, security, entertainment) and committee meetings.
<H2>5.  Budget</H2>

<P>
Determine budget outline and accounting procedures. Target potential
sponsors.
<P>
The budget could consist of office rent, equipment rental, marketing
efforts (printing, advertising, postage, telephone), food, souvenirs,
support services, guest hospitality, permits, entertainment, restrooms,
signage, security services, staff, travel expenses, etc.
<H2>6. Marketing</H2>

<P>
Create a marketing plan based on funds available, target markets,
and event message.
<P>
Create public service announcements (PSAs), press releases and
advertisements.  Determine marketing mediums, incorporate sponsors
in materials and get the word out locally as well as regionally,
 statewide, and nationally.
<H2>7.  Permits</H2>

<P>
Check on event site availability, and obtain the necessary permits.
 Secure insurance, if necessary, and review vendor contracts and/or
booth space rules.
<H2>8.  Refine Program</H2>

<P>
Review steps 1-7 and refine event coordination as necessary.
<H2>9.  Mental Walk-Through </H2>

<P>
Walk through the event mentally, as if you were a visitor.  Where
are the lights, ticket-takers, parking areas and signage?  How
is traffic flow, how does weather affect the event, where are
sponsor banners and booths, where are restrooms and handicapped
access entrances?  What is the communications mechanism?  Review
 the site plan.
<H2>10. Engage Work Plan </H2>

<P>
Redefine work plan as time progresses, and take notes regularly
as reminders of calls to make.  Review site plans, work closely
with sponsors and update your marketing plan as needed.  Have
a response mechanism (1-800 number) to answer calls for information.
 Get in-state publications, plan clean-up/tear-down, host volunteer
thank-you activity, keep documentation of planning process for
following year, etc.
<H2>11. Stage Event</H2>

<P>
Use logistics work plan with chain of communication/control for
decisions.  It is helpful to have a resource guide for key committee
members with home phone numbers, entertainment line-up, maps,
etc.  Have a briefing prior to the event opening and a debriefing
following the event to note improvements for future years.
