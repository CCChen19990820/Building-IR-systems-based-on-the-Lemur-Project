A MATHEMATICAL MODEL TO CHARACTERIZE, THE DISSOLUTION OF SULFIDES IN CuCl2-CuCl-FeCl3-FeCl2-NaCl-HCl- H2O SYSTEM: CUPRIC CHLORIDE LEACHING OF SYNTHETIC NiS:</B> R.C. Hubli, T.K Mukherjee, C.K.

Bautista, Mackay School of Mines, University of Nevada, Reno, NV 89557
<P>
Simulation of sulfide dissolution in cupric chloride media using the partial equilibrium approach has been investigated under different process conditions. The following observations may have a significant bearing on the dissolution behavior: The amount of cupric-chloro-hydroxy complexes is low, &lt;1% of total Cu(II), when the pH of the lixiviant is around 1.5 but increases at lower H+ concentrations. Under aerated conditions the hydrolysis is higher and control of pH during the dissolution process is necessary, the total initial Cu(II) concentration higher than 0.50 M does little to enhance dissolution but may entail a higher loss of &quot;free&quot; copper, the optimum temperature for cupric chloride leaching is around 373-378K (100-105&#176;C) and the presence of small amounts of ferric ion results in increasing the initial rate of dissolution as well as suppressing the hydrolysis of copper. <P>*Acknowledgments: This investigation forms a part of the INDO-US collaborative research programme supported by the Department of Science and Technology, Government of India and the NSF, USA under NSF Grant No. INT-9103106.

LEACHING OF A CHALCOCITE CONCENTRATE WITH CUPRIC CHLORIDE-OXYGEN:</B> M.C. Ruiz, S. Honores, R. Padilla, Department of Metallurgical Engineering, University of Concepcion, Casilla 53-C, Concepcion, Chile
<P>
This work outlines the results of leaching studies on a copper concentrate containing chalcocite (CU2S) and digenite (Cu9S5) with an acid saline solution of cupric chloride oxygenated at ambient pressure. The variables studied included the stirring speed, concentration of cupric ions, concentration of HCl, concentration of chloride ions, oxygen flow rate, temperature and time. The leaching system was found to be very effective for the dissolution of the concentrate. Over 95% of the copper was dissolved in 30 minutes with negligible dissolution of iron. The dissolution of copper increased with the stirring speed up to about 400 rpm and depended little on the total chloride concentration. The oxygen flowrate affected the dissolution of copper only below 0.09 l/min. The concentration of HCl did not influence tile dissolution providing its was sufficient to avoid the precipitation of copper oxychloride. The study of the effect of the temperature showed a maximum in copper dissolution around 90&#176;C.

ELECTROCHEMICAL STUDY OF PYRITE OXIDATION IN CHLORIDE SOLUTION:</B> H.K. Lin, Mineral Industry Research Laboratory, 212 O'Neill Building, University of Alaska Fairbanks, Fairbanks, AK 99775-7240; W.C. Say, Department of Material Science, National Taipei Institute of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan
<P>
Pyrite oxidation in chloride solution was investigated with cyclic voltammetry, ac impedance and potential step techniques. The pyrite oxidation in quiescent electrolytes is irreversible and controlled by diffusion. Depression of the semi-circle in the complex plane plot has been explained mathematically based on the concept of the equivalent circuit. When the semicircle is depressed, the mathematical formula indicates that the reaction resistance should be obtained from the intersection of the semi-circle with Z'-axis instead of the semi-circle diameter. The peak charging current densities at 1.10 and 0.90 V vs. SHE obtained from the equivalent circuit coupled with the ac impedance measurements match the peak current densities obtained with the potential step measurements.

LEACHING OF CHALCOPYRITE IN CuCl-NaCl-O2 SYSTEM:</B> R. Padilla, D. Lovera, M.C. Ruiz, Department of Metallurgical Engineering, University of Concepcion, Casilla 53-C, Concepcion, Chile
<P>
The leaching behavior of chalcopyrite concentrate in acidic CUCl2-NaCl-O2 solutions was investigated. Experiments were conducted under continuous flow of oxygen at atmospheric pressures. The results indicated that among the variables temperature has the largest influence on the dissolution of chalcopyrite in this medium, and high dissolution can only be obtained at temperatures near the boiling point of the solution. It was also found that the stirring speed did not influence appreciably the dissolution of chalcopyrite and that an increase in the oxygen flow rate in the leaching reactor increased the dissolution of chalcopyrite. The total chloride concentration affects markedly the dissolution of chalcopyrite up to about 4 M. Copper dissolutions of about 85% were obtained in leaching chalcopyrite of size fraction -65+100# Tyler at 100&#176;C in 2 hours.

VAPOR PRESSURE STUDIES OF THE SALT FLUX PHASES:</B> S. Wang, ASARCO Inc., Technical Services Center, 3422 South 700 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84119; R.G. Reddy, Department of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering , The University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487
<P>
Physical and chemical properties of the salt flux phase play a significant role in the recycling of UBC and aluminum melting processes. Particularly, the knowledge of several properties such as salt vapor pressure, melting temperature, loss of aluminum, corrosion of refractories are useful for the performance improvements in aluminum industry. In this paper, vapor pressure of sodium and potassium salt fluxes were studied in the pure, binary and ternary systems. The experimental results of vapor pressure studies are presented and the potential application I the industry to the efficiency and the operating advances are discussed.

COMPLEXES OF NIOBIUM (IV,V) IN LiF-NaF-KF MELTS WITH VARYING O2- CONCENTRATIONS:</B> Flemming Matthiesen and Pia Tolstrup, Jensen Kernisk Lab. A, DTU, 2800, Lyngby, Denmark; Terje Ostvold, Institutt for Uorganisk Kjemi, NTNU, Gloshaugen, 7034, Trondheim
<P>
The ternary eutectic LiF-NaF-KF (FLINAK) melt at 700&#176;C was used as a solvent for a study of Nb(IV,V)-O-F complexing. The motivation for this study is the electroplating mechanism of Nb from such melts. A 1.8 mol% Nb2O5 solubility is observed in this melt. The dissolution mechanism is K+ +Nb2O5=NbO2Fx1-x+KNbO3(s)+xF-. When Na2O or SrO is added to FLINAK containing 1 mol% Nb(V), a constant concentration of Nb and a concentration of O2- given by the added oxide up to nO/nNb=2 is observed. For 2 &lt; nO/nNb &lt; 3, the NbO2Fx1-x complex reacts to form KNbO3(s). The solubility data of this compound is matched by literature data. By further additions of O2-, this solid reacts to form NbO43- type complexes. When Na2O is added to FLINAK containing 1 mol% Nb(IV), a constant concentration of Nb and a concentration of O2- given by the added oxide up to nO/nNb=1 is observed. Above this ratio some Na2O still dissolves, but an unknown compound precipitates. At nO/nNb=2 the O2- and Nb(IV) concentrations decrease with increasing oxide additions and reaches a minimum at NO/nNb=3 and probably K2NbO3(s) is formed. Up to nO/nNb=3 the melts are coloured, but changes to colourless (white solids when cooled) at nO/nNb&gt;3. A melt containing a complex of the type NbO42- is probably formed at these high oxide concentrations. Na2O is now completely soluble in the melt.

KINETICS OF ERBIUM OXIDE CORROSION IN MOLTEN CERIUM:</B> C. Lensing, D.L. Olson, B. Mishra, Center for Welding, Joining and Coatings Research, Department of Metallurgical &amp; Materials Engineering, Colorado School of Mines, Golden, CO 80401
<P>
The compatibility between erbium oxide and molten cerium was investigated to understand the high temperature corrosion mechanisms and to provide kinetic data. High and low density erbium oxide samples were immersed into molten cerium at temperatures ranging from 850 to 975&#176;C for 16 to 128 hours. A parabolic rate dependence for corrosion scale formation was observed as well as an intergranular penetration of cerium into erbium oxide was noted. Activation energy for the complete corrosion process is 38.5 kCal/mole. Two reaction layers formed for the cerium system, viz. cerium oxide particle layer and a layer of erbium oxide-cerium oxide solid solution.

DEVELOPMENT OF PROCESSING METHODS FOR STAINLESS STEEL-ZIRCONIUM NUCLEAR WASTE FORMS ALLOYS:</B> S.M. McDeavitt, D.P. Abraham, Argonne National Laboratory, Chemical Technology Division, 9700 South. Cass Avenue, Argonne, IL 60439
<P>
Stainless steel-zirconium waste form alloys are being developed at Argonne National Laboratory for the immobilization of metallic materials left behind following the electrometallurgical treatment of spent nuclear fuel. The metal waste form comprises fuel cladding, noble metal fission products (e.g., Ru, Rh, Pd, Zr, and Tc), and other metallic constituents. These metallic wastes are not generated in the electrorefiner; they are present with the spent fuel before treatment. The nominal compositions stainless steel- 15 wt% zirconium and zirconium-8 wt% stainless steel are the baseline alloys for stainless steel-clad and Zircaloy-clad fuels, respectively. The selection process for the baseline compositions will be described and the subsequent development of basic alloying procedures will be reviewed (e.g., alloying temperatures, molten metal containment, and heating method). Other process-related issues still under development include microstructural refinement through annealing and molten salt fluxing for surface purity and composition control. <P>

INFLUENCE OF TEXTURE AND STRESS STATE ON THE CONSTITUTIVE RESPONSE OF AN AUTOMOTIVE STEEL:</B> <I>Carl M. Cady</I>*, Shuh-Rong Chen, George T. Gray III, Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), MST-5 MS-G755, Los Alamos, NM 87545; John F. Bingert, David A. Korzekwa, LANL, MST-6 MS-G770, Los Alamos NM 87545
<P>
The relationships between the stress state, texture, revalue (Lankford parameter), and yield surface for a DQSK mild sheet steel have been analyzed. The strain rate and temperature sensitivity of the flow stress and the insensitivity of the strain hardening rate indicate that thermal activation over a Peierls barrier is the rate controlling mechanism for deformation in DQSK. The stress/strain response for DQSK steel is shown to be strongly influenced by strain rate and temperature which is consistent with this controlling mechanism. A calculated yield surface, using the Quadratic Hill criterion, is shown to produce an accurate correlation with the experimental results. Comparisons of the stress/strain response with the calculated yield surface and texture measurements will be shown to correlate with the relationships between the inplane and through thickness deformation.

<P>THE MICROTEXTURE OF FRACTURE IN LITHIUM-CONTAINING ALUMINUM ALLOYS:</B> <I>R.

<P>
An Electron Back-Scattered Pattern (EBSP) system was used on a scanning electron microscope (SEM) to examine the crystallographic features of intergranular fracture in several lithium-containing aluminum alloys. The alloys examined have thin, flat grains with a &quot;pancake&quot; morphology, which tend to be highly elongated in the rolling direction. Metallographically prepared and electropolished samples of longitudinal sections were examined in the SEM where absorbed current images and diffraction data were collected through-thickness, with patterns indexed to the images. Delamination fracture was then induced in the samples by torsional loading, which often produced several cracks, and samples were returned to the SEM chamber to determine the crack locations relative to the previously acquired data. The results indicate that delamination occurs between grains near the S and R texture component orientations, which are known to form during deformation processing and as a result of grain boundary initiated recrystallization, respectively.

<P>ELEVATED TEMPERATURE COMPRESSIVE SLOW STRAIN RATE PROPERTIES OF SEVERAL DIRECTIONALLY SOLIDIFIED NIAL-(NB, MO) ALLOYS:</B> J. Daniel Whittenberger, Ronald D.

<P> 
Three NiAl-based alloys containing 3Nb-lOMo, 5Nb-lOMo or 13.6Nb-18Mo (at. %) were directionally solidified (ds'ed) to develop interpenetrating networks of B2 crystal structure NiAl Laves NiAlNb and bcc metallic Mo. It was hoped that the Mo would improve the fracture toughness, while the Laves phase would promote good creep resistance. Examination of the alloys indicated that the as-grown structure consisted of essentially unalloyed NAL NiAlNb alloyed with ~8.5 Mo, and a Mo solid solution containing 27Nb-7Ni-7A1. Compressive properties were measured between 1200 to 1400 K in air with strain rates ranging from ~10-4 to ~10-8s-1. The flow strengths of the two alloys with 10Mo were nearly identical and much weaker than those for NAI-13.6Nb-18Mo. Comparison the properties of this latter alloy with other ds'ed NAl-based eutectics revealed that it was the strongest material under lower temperature/fast deformation conditions, but this advantage was lost at higher temperatures and/or slower strain rates.

<P>DEFORMATION AND FAILURE MECHANISMS IN MATERIALS THAT DEFORM BY TWINNING AND MARTENSITIC TRANSFORMATION:</B>  Surya R. Kalidindi, R.D. Doherty, E. El-Danaf, S. Asgari, I Shaji, Department of Materials Engineering, Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA 19104
<P>
MP35N (35% Co, 35% Ni, 10% Mo, 20% Cr) exhibits an remarkable combination of ultrahigh strength, high ductility, high fracture toughness, high corrosion resistance, and it retains its room temperature strength upto about 600&#176;C. This alloy hardens from 390 MPa (in the annealed state) to 1385 MPa after being 53% cold drawn and then to 1935 MPa on subsequent aging of the cold-drawn material at 600&#176;C for four hours. Furthermore, the alloy was found to show a 50% reduction in area before failure in tension tests of the cold drawn and aged samples. The mechanisms of the primary and secondary hardening obtained through cold working and subsequent aging have been investigated in this study by optical and transmission electron microscopy investigations on deformed and deformed and aged samples. Some of the interesting observations made in our study include: (i) Plots of strain hardening rate versus stress (or strain) in simple compression of annealed MP35N indicate four distinct regimes of strain hardening which when suitably normalized were found to be in excellent agreement with the corresponding measurements in several other low stacking fault energy fcc alloys. (ii) The amount of secondary hardening in MP35N depended critically on the amount of plastic deformation imposed prior to aging. It was observed that a strain of about 0.2 was needed before secondary hardening could be detected and that the increase in strength by secondary hardening saturated at a strain of about 0.6. (iii) Simple compression deformation on samples that exhibited significant secondary hardening produced extensive micro-scale shear banding. The extent of shear banding increased with increased levels of secondary hardening and macro-scale shear bands were noted in compression of heavily deformed and aged samples. (iv) Measurements of plane strain fracture toughness revealed that the 53% cold-worked samples retained high toughnesses (about 120 MPa m112) even after the secondary hardening. The formation of shear bands noted above did not seem to effect either the fracture toughness or the ductility of the deformed and aged samples compared to the deformed only samples upto about 53% reduction levels in cold-drawing. Beyond about 60% reduction levels in cold-drawing, the ductility of the deformed and aged samples was observed to drop precipitously. A detailed investigation using the optical microscope and TEM was undertaken to explain the above observations. We are presently attempting to correlate the microscopy observations to the results from the mechanical testing. These results and our current understanding of the physical origin of the properties described above will be presented.

<P>
Material characterization tests for tensile, creep-rupture, low cycle fatigue and fatigue crack growth responses were conducted on P/M U720 forged disc alloy subjected to a specified heat treatment. The purpose of this investigation is to examine the effects of the thermomechanical processes on the high temperature mechanical behavior of this material with a special attention to the creep-rupture, low cycle fatigue and fatigue crack growth rate. The results of analysis are mainly based on the phenomenological approach and predicted methods so that the quantitative comparison can be presented. in addition, the fracture morphologies of the material at 538&#176;C and 650&#176;C were also investigated by SEM and optical metallography to determine the relationships of failure modes, relative fatigue and creep-rupture life to the grain size, local microstructure and defect inclusions resulted from different consolidation processes.

<P>STUDY AND COMPARISON OF (111) DEFORMATION MICROBANDS ASSOCIATED WITH IMPACT CRATERS AND PENETRATION CHANNELS IN THICK COPPER PLATES:</B> <I>L.E. Murr</I>, J.M. Rivas, E.P. Garcia, C-S.

<P>
While copper, having critical grain sizes greater than about 20 &#181;m, will twin above a critical, plane-wave shock pressure of about 20 GPa, {111} deformation twins are essentially absent below impact craters or along dense rod penetration channels in copper plates (1.3 to 3.5 cm thick) where instantaneous (plane-wave impact) shock pressures exceed 100 GPa; for spheres and rods impacting at velocities between 1.5 and 6.7 km/s, with densities ranging from 2.2 to 17.6 g/cm3. However, deformation microbands consisting of elongated, dense dislocation wall structures (0.1 to 0.4, am wide), coincident with primary {111}planes; occur in bands or zones removed several millimeters from the crater or penetration channel walls, and predominantly in grains which exhibit little or no (plastic) distortion. These microbands possess misorientations ranging from 1 to 3&#176; and appear to be created as a consequence of intense shear wave phenomena associated with these unique, high strain, high-strainrate deformation regimes. They also occur amongst dense, equiaxed, dislocation cells whose misorientations are &lt;1&#176;, and appear to be related to {111}deformation twins or twin faults which also emerge from or occur amongst, dislocation cells in plane-wave shock loaded copper, for example.

EFFECTS OF HEAT TREATMENT AND MO CONTENT ON THE MICROSTRUCTURE AND MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF FE-NI-CR-MO HIGH TEMPERATURE GEAR STEELS:</B> Cha-Yong Lim, Sung-Joon Kim- Korea Institute of Machinery and Materials, #66 Sangnam-Dong, Changwon, Kyungnam, Korea 641-010
<P>
The effects of heat treatment and Mo content on microstructure and mechanical properties of high temperature gear steels have been investigated. High temperature gear steels require temper resistance, hot hardness, fracture toughness and impact strength for operation at elevated temperatures. The compositions (wt.%) of gear steels studied in this work were Fe-2.0Ni-l.0cr-(1~3.15)Mo-2.0Cu-0.4Mn-0.llC steels. The ingots manufactured by the vacuum induction melting were hot-rolled at 1473 K to 15mm thickness. The hot-rolled plates were quenched and tempered at various conditions. The degree of secondary hardening is increased with the Mo content due to the precipitation of fine alloy carbide (Mo2C) during tempering treatments. Continuous cooling transformation diagrams were obtained. High temperature mechanical tests (Hardness, Toughness, Impact energy) were conducted. Cylindrical compressive specimens of 8mm diameter and 12mm height were machined from the hot-rolled plates. High temperature compressive tests were carried out in an compression testing machine at various strain rates. The microstructure aRer deformation was investigated. The deformed structure was dynamically recrystallized at higher temperatures and lower strain rates. Activation energy and flow equation at high temperatures were discussed.

MICROSTRUCTURAL CHANGE DURING SUPERPLASTIC DEFORMATION IN LOW ALLOYED Zn-Al ALLOY:</B> W.B. Lee, T.K. Ha, C.G. Park, Center for Advanced Aerospace Material, Univ. of Sci. &amp; Tech., POSTECH, Pohang, 790-784, Korea
<P>
Microstructural change and deformation behavior have been observed in superplastic Zn-Al alloys. Row-alloyed Zn-Al alloys, which contains a small fraction of precipitates at grain boundary, showed superplastic deformation behaviors even at room temperature, while pure Zn is very brittle. In the present study, the effects of aluminum composition (up to 1 wt.%) on the change in the microstructure (the role of precipitates) as well as dislocation structure have been investigated during the superplastic deformation. TEM in situ deformation was also performed to investigate dislocation behavior at grain boundary during superplastic deformation of low alloyed Zn-Al alloys.

EFFECTS OF YIELD STRESS AND TEXTURE ON DELAYED HYDRIDE CRACKING IN Zr-2.5Nb PRESSURE TUBE:</B> In Sup Kim, Je Yong Oh, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Taejon 305-701, S. Korea
<P>
The delayed hydride cracking (DHC) in pressure tubes is caused by diffusion of hydrogen atoms into crack tip region, precipitation of hydride, and consequent fracture of the hydrided region under stress. To explain DHC quantitatively, many models have been proposed and the Puls model has been well recognized among them. In this study, the effects of yield stress and texture on DHC have been investigated in Zr-2.5Nb pressure tube material and experimental results were introduced and compared to Puls DHC model. The delayed hydride cracking velocity (DHCV) increased with yield stress, while the threshold stress intensity factor increased as yield stress decreased. The activation energy of DHCV was dependent on the texture. When the direction of crack propagation was longitudinal, the activation energy was 34kJ/mol. However, in the case of circumferential propagation, the energy was measured as 17kJ/mol.

DEVELOPMENT OF TEXTURE AND MICROSTRUCTURE DURING COLD ROLLING OF Ni3Al(B,Zr):</B> <I>B. Bhattacharya</I>, R.K. Ray, Department of Materials and Metallurgical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur-208016, India
<P>
The present report deals with textural as well as microstructural developments during cold rolling of a two-phase Ni3Al(B,Zr) alloy. Basically a pure metal type texture was obtained at lower levels of deformation, while a mixed type (both pure metal and alloy type) was observed at high strain. The transition was detected after about 35% reduction which was correlated with a possible structural transformation in the <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">/phase. The change of deformation mode from slip to twinning in <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif"> was confirmed by electron microscopy. However, the second phase (Ni-base, disordered <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif"> phase) in the alloy is not known to suffer any change in the deformation mode with straining. Therefore, it is suggested, that the textural development in the two phases will be of different nature; the combined effect will be reflected in the form of the textural change for the whole sample, as mentioned above.

EXPERIMENTAL AND OPTIMIZED BINARY SYSTEMS OF POST-TRANSITIONAL ELEMENTS: </B> <I>B. Legendre</I>, Y. Feutelais and E. Dichi, Laboratoire de Chimie-Physique Min&eacute;rale et Bioinorganique, Facult&eacute; de Pharmacie, 5 rue J.B. Cl&eacute;ment, 92296 Ch&acirc;tenay-Malabry, France<P>
Post transitional elements present a lot of physical properties, especially in the fields of electronic and opto-electronic. Thus the knowledge of binary and ternary phase diagrams is of great importance both for the elaboration of alloys and for their application. One of the characteristics of the elements of post transition is a low melting point and for a large number of them a high vapor pressure. For this last reason it is of great interest to include the gas phase with the condensed phases and to calculate the pressure dependence of the phase diagram. In this lecture, we present experimental data and the result of the optimization for some systems such as: cd-Ge, Cd-Te, Zn-Te, Cd-Zn-Te, Ge-Te, Si-Te, Au-Te. All of these binary systems are included in a database (POSTRANS) compatible with Thermocalc.

PHASE EQUILIBRIA AND THERMOCHEMISTRY OF THE In-Se SYSTEM:</B> C. Mallika, C.H. Chang, A. Davydov, B.J. Stanbery, T.J. Anderson, Dept. of Chemical Eng., Univ. of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611<P>
The phase diagram and thermochemistry of the In-Se system have been studied by several investigators, however, the liquid mixture behavior is not well understood. The following galvanic cell: W|In(I),In2O3(s)||In2O3(s),[In]In-Se(s or 1)|C|W was used to determine the activity of In in In-Se liquid alloys in the compositional range 0.10&lt;xse,0.60 and the temperature range 800 to 975 K. Slightly positive deviations from ideal solution behavior were observed in the liquid solution and the measured liquids temperatures were in good agreement with those reported in the literature. In addition, the Gibbs energy of formation for each intermediate compound was derived from the measured values of emf. These results were then combined with other experimental data available in the literature to reassess the thermochemistry and the In-Se phase diagram. Four intermediate solid phases (In4 Se3, InSe, In6Se7, and In2Se3) were considered to be line compounds in this assessment and the Redlich-Kister expression was used to model the liquid phase.

ASSESSMENT OF THE PHASE DIAGRAM AND THERMODYNAMIC PROPERTIES OF THE As- Ga-Sb AND As-In-Sb SYSTEMS:</B> A. Watson, Univ. of Sheffield, Mappin St., Sheffield S1 3JD, United Kingdom; A. Davydov, S. Misra, T.J. Anderson, Dept. of Chemical Engr., Univ. of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611<P>
Group III arsenides and antimonides are extremely important materials used in the manufacture of high speed and high frequency electronic devices. In the III-V semiconductor family As-Ga-In-Sb, there are four ternary subsystems. By selecting different compositions within these subsystems, electrical and optical properties of the material can be changed in order to satisfy different applications. In this work, experimental phase diagram information and thermochemical data available in the literature for the As-Ga-Sb and As-In-Sb systems have been critically assessed as a preliminary step towards the study of the As-Ga-In-Sb system. Thermodynamic descriptions of the phases that are consistent with selected experimental data have been produced using the ternary optimizing program TERGSS and thermodynamic descriptions of the binary and unary phases from previous assessments. Phase equilibria and thermodynamic properties are presented which have been calculated from the optimized coefficients using MTDATA. This information can be used for optimizing materials growth conditions and device manufacture.

POTENTIOMETRIC DETERMINATION OF THE THERMODYNAMIC STABILITY OF SB2O3:</B> R. Lowery, C. Mallika, and T.J. Anderson, Dept. of Chemical Engr., Univ. of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611<P>
Precise values of thermodynamic properties of Sb2O3 are required to synthesize and characterize the alloys of antimony for applications in thermoelectric devices and semiconductor technology. The Gibbs energy formation of Sb2O3 has been reliably reported in the literature using solid electrolyte emf measurements. This work is extended to determine the phase equilibrium temperatures in Sb/Sb2O3 system. The galvanic cell used in this study can be represented as W|C|Sb(s or 1), Sb2O3(s or 1)_YSZ_ Cu2O,Cu|W. The oxygen potential for the biphasic mixtures were derived from the cell potential data over the temperature range 790 to 983 K. Phase transition temperatures of 845.5 K (Sb2O3, orthorhombic to Sb2O3, cubic), 905.6 K (Sb,s to Sb,1) and 930.0K (Sb2O3,cubic to Sb2O3,1) were obtained from discernible breaks in the emf-T plots. These results agree well with calorimetric values. A value of -712.4 kJ/mol calculated by third-law treatment for DH&#176;f,298 (Sb2O3, orthorhombic) reasonably agrees with literature data.

PREDICTING OF THE THERMODYNAMIC PROPERTIES FOR THE TERNARY SYSTEM Ga-Sb-Bi:</B> <I>Dragana Zivkovic</I>, Zivan Zivkovic, Univ. of Belgrade, Technical Faculty, 19210, Yugoslavia, Jaroslav Sestak, Czech Acad. of Sciences, Inst. of Physics, 18040 Praha, Czech Republic<P>
Ternary system Ga-Sb-Bi belongs to the group of alloy systems containing semi-conducting compounds, which are important from both the scientific and practical point of view. While binary systems Ga-Sb, Bi-Sb and Ga-Bi are mostly thermodynamically determined, there are only a few data about the thermodynamics of the investigated ternary system Ga-Bi-Sb. Because of the experimental difficulties in thermodynamic determination of this system, connected with the oxidation and volatizing of the present components at investigation temperatures, thermodynamic predicting is applied, and results of the comparative determination of thermodynamic properties in ternary system Ga-Sb-Bi by using following methods: Toop, R-function and general solution model, are given in this paper. Activities, activity coefficients, partial and integral molar quantities for all components in five quasibinary sections of the ternary system Ga-Sb-Bi are determined at temperature 1073K.

THERMODYNAMIC PROPERTIES AND VAPOR-LIQUID EQUILIBRIUM RELATIONS OF INDIUM-CONTAINING BINARIES:</B><I> Dajian Wang</I>, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Yunnan, 650093, China<P>
To establish the vapor-liquid equilibrium composition relations of In-Sn, In-Pb, In-Zn, the Miedema's cellular model of heat of formation of binary liquid alloys are employed to correlate the activity coefficients of each component in the binary. Based on the dissimilar Wigner-Seitz atomic cells model, a quantitative analysis of heats of mixing and solution of binary alloys was Miedema. Tanaka deduced the relation between mixing enthalpy and excess entropy of liquid binary alloy. Through the correlation between the heat of formation and excess Gibbs free energy, the activity coefficients and their practical pressures can be analyzed. The obtained results have met the needs of activity coefficients of each component in above alloys in the applications of vacuum separation techniques, as well as in the development of lead-free solder of In-Sn binary or related multicomponent systems.

APPLICATION OF KNUDSEN EFFUSION MASS SPECTROSCOPY FOR THE STUDY OF THERMODYNAMIC AND PHASE DIAGRAM PROPERTIES OF TRANSITION METAL-TELLURIUM SYSTEMS:</B> <I>M. Sai Baba</I>, Dept. of Chemistry, Texas A&amp;M Univ., College Station, TX 77843; R. Viswanathan, Materials Chemistry Div., Chemical Group, Indira Gandi Centre for Atomic Research, Kalpakkam - 603 102, Tamil Nadu, India<P>
Knudsen effusion mass spectrometric technique has been employed to study the thermodynamic and phase diagram properties of transition metal-tellurium systems. Preferential evaporation of these metal tellurides has been made use of to generate the nonstoichiometric telluride phases in situ. From the variation of tellurium activity as a function of composition, homogeneity ranges of the nonstoichiometric metal tellurides have been arrived at. By applying Gibbs-Duhem integration the thermodynamic activity of the second component could be arrived at. From the activities, partial molar Gibbs free energies were derived. Some of the metal tellerium systems studied include Fe-Te, Cr-Te, Mo-Te and Mn-Te. In this paper we describe some of our results with emphasis on the usefulness of Knudsen effusion mass spectrometric method for deriving such information.

THE INTERFACIAL REACTIONS IN THE As-Se/Zn COUPLES</B>: Ming-Horng Lin, <I>Sinn-wen Chen,</I> Dept. of Chemical Engr.,<I> </I>National Tsing-Hua University<I>,</I> Hsinchu, Taiwan 30043, China; Jinn-lung Wang, Chemical Systems Research Div., Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology, Lung-Tan, Taiwan, China<P>
The As-Se-based chalcogenide glasses are IR transparent, and are considered an ideal braze to the ZnSe and ZnS substrates in the IR detector. The interfacial reactions between As-Se and Zn are investigated for fundamental understanding. Three different kinds of reaction couples were prepared, and they were As-50at%Se/Zn at 350&#176;C. As-50at%Se/Zn at 370&#176;C, and As-60at%Se/Zn at 350&#176;C annealed for various length of time. The cross sections of the reaction couples were analyzed by using OM and EPMA. Two phases were formed at the interface, and the diffusion paths were glass/ZnSe/As2Zn3/Zn. The growth rates of the intermetallic layers were also determined by using as image analyzer. The growth rates followed the parabolic law for the type I and type III couples which indicated a diffusion-controlled mechanism.

THE ATMOSPHERIC OXIDATION OF TELLURIUM:</B><I> Marc Suys</I>, &Eacute;cole Polytechnique de Montr&eacute;al, Dept. of Chemical Engr, C.P. 6079, centre-ville, Montr&eacute;al (Qu&eacute;bec), Canada DA, H3C 3A7; A. Roy, and J. L'&Eacute;cuyer, Noranda Advanced Materials, 4950 L&eacute;vy, Saint-Laurent (Qu&eacute;bec), Canada, H4R 2P1<P>
Tellurium forms technologically important alloys which are being used increasingly in the semiconductor industry (CdTe,Bi2Te3). As such, control of the purity of the source TE metal is critical. Therefore, the understanding of the atmospheric oxidation of tellerium cannot be neglected, as it can be a source of oxygen incorporation in the metal, and thus in the alloys. We have studied, by X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), the oxidation of crushed tellerium under various conditions of humidity and air exposure. The rate of oxidation of tellerium is relatively slow: 30 A of tellerium dioxide is detected on the surface of a sample after 8 days of direct air exposure. Our results tend to suggest that the rate-limiting step is the transport of the oxidizing reactant to the tellerium surface. We have also observed that the oxidation reaction is dependent on the relative humidity, as has been reported previously, for thin films, by various authors.

IDENTIFICATION OF CONSTITUENT PARTICLES IN 2024-T3 AND 7075-T6 ALUMINUM ALLOYS:</B> Ming Gao, Robert P. Wei, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering and Mechanics, Lehigh University, 7 Asa Dr., Bethlehem, PA 18015; Jerry Feng, Metallurgy Division, Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, DC 20375
<P>
Constituent particles in 2024-T3 and 7075-T6 aluminum alloys were identified by analytical electron microscopy (AEM) to aid the understanding of particle-induced pitting corrosion. Convergent beam electron diffraction (CBED) was used, in conjunction with energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS), for determining their structure and composition. Typical phases in these alloys (CuA12, CuMgAl2 and Fe4CuA123) were identified. In addition, a complex rhombohedral phase, with composition close to (Fe, Cu, Mn, Si)Al, was also identified. Detailed aspects of these particles are described, and their role in pitting corrosion are discussed. *Research supported by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research, Grant F49620-93-1-0426, and the Federal Aviation Administration, Grant 92-G-0006.

TEM STUDIES OF PARTICLE-INDUCED CORROSION IN 2024-T3 AND 7075-T6 ALUMINUM ALLOYS:</B> Robert P. Wei, Ming Gao, , Dept. of Mechanical Engineering and Mechanics, Chi-Min Liao, Dept. of Materials Science and Engineering, Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA 18015
<P>
To better understand particle-induced pitting corrosion in aluminum alloys, thin- foil specimens of 2024-T3 and 7075-T6 aluminum alloys, with identified constituent particles, were immersed in aerated 0.5 M NaCl solution and then examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results clearly showed matrix dissolution around the iron and manganese containing particles (such as, Fe4CuAl23). Matrix dissolution was also observed around CuAl2 particles, while CuMgAl2 particles tended to dissolve relative to the matrix. These results are consistent with previous SEM observations of pitting corrosion, and are discussed in terms of the electrochemical characteristics of the particles and the matrix.

RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE SOLUTIONIZED MICROSTRUCTURES AND THE TRANSIENT CURRENT RESPONSE FROM SCRATCH TEST EXPERIMENTS IN 6061 ALUMINUM ALLOY AND A COMPOSITE CONTAINING ALUMINA PARTICLES:</B> Shane Andrews, S.K. Varma, Department of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering, The University of Texas at El Paso, El Paso, TX 79968-0520
<P>
The sensitivity of the scratch technique towards understanding the corrosion behavior of 6061 aluminum alloy reinforced with 0.1 volume fraction of alumina particles and in the monolithic form has been explored. Identical solutionizing treatment in the two materials shows different transient current responses. The depassivation and repassivation kinetics appear to differ considerably during the impact and continuous scratches since a balance between the two results in stabilized value of peak current during continuous scratching experiments only. The total charge density increases linearly with solutionizing time for both materials while grain growth law (square of the grain diameter is directly proportional to the solutionizing time) is valid for up to 25 hours of solutionizing time. Near surface microstructures have been examined with the help of TEM as well as SEM. This research has been supported by the National Science Foundation through the grant number HRD9353547.

SCC BEHAVIOR OF SENSITIZED ALLOY 600 LASER-SURFACE ALLOYED WITH Cr-NJ POWDER:</B> <I>Joung Soo Kim</I>, Jin Kuk Shin, Sun Ki Woo, Jeong Hun Suh, Yun Soo Lim, I1 Hyun Kuk, Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute P. O. Box 105, Yusung, Taejun, Korea
<P>
In order to prevent and/or mitigate intergranular stress corrosion cracking(IGSCC) occurring in sensitized Alloy 600, the surface of the material was alloyed with Cr or Cr-Ni powder using a CO2 laser beam. The thickness of the alloyed region was measured to be around 200 250 &#181;m. The Microstructure and the compositional variations of the alloyed layers were analysed with a transmission electron microscope (TEM) and analyzed using EDX attached to the TEM. The alloyed molten metal was observed to solidify epitaxially from the boundary between the melted and unmeted(matrix) regions, like the microstructure of sensitized Alloy 600 surface-melted by a CO2 beam. The compositional change in the alloyed layer was very small, i.e. very homogeneus. The surface-alloyed specimens were tested in a sodium tetrathionate (Na2S406) solution at room temperature using a CERT technique. IGSCC was completely prevented by the surface-alloying using a CO2 laser beam, i.e. the specimen was ruptured and the fracture surface was observed to consist of dimples, which is a typical morphology of specimen fractured by ductile failure(rupture). The relationship between the microstructure and the susceptibility to IGSCC will be discussed.

CORROSION-FATIGUE AND STRESS-CORROSION CRACK GROWTH IN PRECIPITATION-HARDENABLE STAINLESS STEELS:</B> <I>P.S. Pao</I>, C.R. Feng, R.A. Bayles, Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, D.C. 20375; G.R. Yoder, Office of Naval Research, Arlington, VA 22217
<P>
The effect of load ratio on the corrosion-fatigue crack growth kinetics and the stress-corrosion cracking of the precipitation-hardenable stainless steels PH13-8Mo, 15-SPH, and 17-4PH in a 3.5% NaC1 solution were investigated. All three PH-class stainless steels exhibit good stress-corrosion cracking resistance with stress-corrosion cracking thresholds in excess of 70 MPa<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/squareroot-m.gif">. These steels also demonstrate good corrosion-fatigue cracking resistance in a 3.5% NaC1 solution as the crack growth rates in a 3.5% NaC1 solution are less than twice the rates in ambient air. The corrosion-fatigue cracking thresholds progressively decrease as the load ratio (R) increases from 0.10 to 0.90. PH138Mo exhibits anomalous corrosion-fatigue crack growth kinetics and a concomitant change in fracture mode at R=0.90. The observed crack growth behavior, the deformation microstructure, and the significance of high load ratio corrosion fatigue will be discussed.

THE MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROPERTIES OF NITROGEN GAS ATOMIZED ALLOY 690</B>: G.E. Fuchs, Lockheed Martin Company, P.O. Box 1072, Schenectady, NY 12301-1072
<P>
Alloy 690 exhibits excellent resistance to stress corrosion cracking (SCC) and is frequently used in steam generator applications. In order to achieve the desired microstructure for SCC resistance in A690, high temperature solution annealing heat treatments are required. These heat treatments, though, can result in extensive grain growth and relatively low strength. Powder metallurgy processing and the addition of nitrogen during atomization results in an alloy with significantly improved microstructural control and properties. This study examines the microstructure and properties of a nitrogen gas atomized A690 heat consolidated by HIP and extrusion. The effects of consolidation temperature and subsequent hot working is also discussed.

THE BRITTLE-TO-DUCTILE TRANSITION IN NiA1 SINGLE CRYSTALS</B>: <I>S. Shrivastava, </I> F. Ebrahimi, Materials Science &amp; Engineering Department, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611
<P>
Intermetallic compound NiAl has the potential to be used as a turbine blade material for aerospace applications due to its low density, high thermal conductivity, and good oxidation resistance. However, it suffers from insufficient toughness at low temperatures. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effects of displacement rate on the brittle-to-ductile transition (BDT) in NiAl single crystals. Double-notched-tensile specimens with [110] tensile axis were used for fracture toughness testing. The results of this study show a strong strain rate dependence of BDT temperature, however, the low temperature toughness level was insensitive to the applied displacement rate. Fracture paths of the specimens fractured at different temperatures and strain rates were analyzed and the crack initiation and propagation mechanisms were investigated. In this paper, the process of BDT in NiAl single crystal will be discussed in terms of thermally activated deformation processes and their effects on crack initiation and propagation.

PRECIPITATION BEHAVIOR OF GAMMA PRIME AND SIGMA PHASE OF HIGH STRENGTH STAINLESS STEEL FOR SEA WATER APPLICATIONS:</B> <I>Minoru Suwa</I>, Hideto Kimura, Materials and Processing Research Center, NKK Corporation, 1 Kokancho, Fukuyama, 721, Japan
<P>
The effect of y'-Ni,(Ti, Al) and a phase precipitation on the mechanical properties and the corrosion resistance to sea water was investigated in Fe-(2025)%Cr-35%Ni-(4.5-6)%Mo-2%Ti-0.3%Alalloys. Though the hardness of the alloy increases after <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">' and a phase precipitation, pitting-corrosion resistance is deteriorated by a phase, while deterioration by <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">' phase precipitation is little. The precipitation of <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">' is found to occur almost simultaneously with a phase in 25%Cr-4. 5%Mo alloy. However, in 20%Cr-6%Mo alloy, the aging condition for <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">' phase to precede <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/sigma.gif"> phase is found, which achieves both Vickers hardness of 320, and critical pitting temperature(CPT) of 323K.

MICROSTRUCTURE CHANGE IN SILICON NITRIDE DURING SUPERPLASTIC DEFORMATION:</B> Naoki Kondo1, Eiichi Sato2, Fumihiro Wakai1, 1National Industrial Research Institute of Nagoya, Hirate-cho, Kita-ku, Nagoya, Aich 462, Japan; 2The Institute of Space and Astronautical Science, Yoshino-dai, Sagamihara, Kanagawa 229, Japan
<P>
Three dimensional (3-D) microstructures of <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/epsilon.gif">=1.34 (280 % deformed) silicon nitride nitride specimen were calculated using the stereological analysis. The grain radius slightly increased during deformation. The aspect ratio remained almost constant up to <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/epsilon.gif">= 0.88, and then, largely increased. The orientation angle decreased monotonously. A dominant deformation modes are considered to be grain sliding (<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/epsilon.gif">= 0.88-1.34). Grain rotation and alignment also act as sub-dominant deformation mode all through the deformation.

A TEM STUDY ON THE MICROSTRUCTURALEFFECTS ON PLASTIC DEFORMATION IN ALUMINUM ALLOY2219:</B> Carlos D. Rincon, Roy Arrowood , Department of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering and Materials Research Institute, The University of Texas at E1 Paso, E1 Paso, TX 79968-0520
<P>
A fundamental transmission electron microscopy (TEM) investigation is being conducted on the effects of microstructure on the plastic deformation of 2219-T87 aluminum. A previous study showed inhomogeneous and locally extreme work hardening in the heataffected-zone (HAZ)- regions in Variable Polarity Plasma Arc (VPPA) 2219-T87 butt welds, which strongly suggests that the HAZ microstructure plays a major role in the deformation and fracture process. Due to the small size of these butt welds, it can be quite difficult to accurately quantify the stress-strain behavior of the HAZ. Therefore, precipitate structures similar to ones found in the HAZ are being produced by heat treatment of tensile specimens machined from 2219-T87 plate. Heat treatments involve varying the aging time and temperature to obtain GP zones followed by the precipitation of transition phases. Uniaxial tensiIe tests will be performed on the heat treated specimens at low strain rates (0.01 mine-1 and 5.0 min-1') at room temperature in order to quantify the effect of precipitate structure on the stress-strain behavior. This work was supported by the General Electric Faculty of the Future Program.

COMPREHENSIVE FLOW STRESS DETERMINATION IN EXTRUDED ALUMINUM PRODUCTS:</B> <I>Michael S. Paulson</I>, Roger N. Wright, Materials Science and Engineering Department, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy NY 12180
<P>
Physical modeling of the aluminum extrusion process e reductions is difficult due to the large reductions and the complex extrudate shapes. Conventional machines flow stress specimens are not likely to be representative of the metal as it is extruded. A method of directly testing the total cross section is needed to properly represent extrudate flow stresses for process modeling purposes. Such a method is presented, as applied to rapidly heated commercial aluminum extrudates at temperatures and strain rates pertinent to die exit conditions. Resulting constitutive equations are compared to those developed for starting billet stock from the same lot of metal.

EFFECT OF REDISTRIBUTING RESIDUAL STRESS ON THE FATIGUE BEHAVIOR OF SS330 WELDMENT:</B> Yong-Bok Lee, Chin-Sung Chung, Dept. of Mechanical Eng., Hong-Ik University of Seoul; Nam-Ik Cho, Dept. of Mech. Eng. Chon-Ju Tech. College; and <I>Ho-Kyung Kim</I>, Dept. of Automotive Eng., Seoul National Polytechnic University, 172 Kongnung-dong, Nowon-ku, Seoul, Korea
<P>
Effect of residual stress and its redistribution in weldment on the fatigue crack propagation was investigated. Fatigue tests were conducted using center notched specimens machines from welded plats. The residual stress and its redistribution were measured by a magnetizing stress indicator and hole drilling method. The residual stresses were found to be redistributed during crack propagation. Crack growth rates were predicted and compared with the experimental results. It has been found that the predicted crack growth rates have a better agreement with the experimental results when the redistributing residual stress, rather than residual stress, was considered. Also when the concept of partial crack closure was adopted in the analysis of crack growth rates, fatigue crack growth rates were a good agreement with, in spite of variation of stress ratio.

Both 40 and 62 wt.% beryllium compositions were evaluated for ambient and elevated temperature compressive strength at low and high strain rates. Data indicated a strong influence of beryllium percentage along with an increase of yield point for fast strain rates of 0.5-1 inch/minute. Fatigue properties of a ternary BeAl-Ag cast and extruded material were determined for full reversal and standard tension fatigue conditions. Typical S-N curve behavior including endurance limit was observed.

<P>
Creep testing performed on 40 and 62 wt.% beryllium compositions of a powder metallurgy composite alloy at several elevated temperatures indicated a dependence of steady state creep rates and times to rupture on beryllium content, test direction, stress, and test temperature. A stress exponent of 8.5 for 40% beryllium and 10 for 62% beryllium was obtained from tests at 550 degrees F. A lower stress exponent of 6.7 was found for 62% beryllium at 630 degrees F. Activation energies for creep were somewhat higher than for self-diffusion in either pure metal, and exhibited significant anisotropy.

NEUTRON DIFFRACTION STUDY OF THE CO-DEFORMATION BEHAVIOR OF BERYLLIUM-ALUMINUM:</B> David H. Carter, Los Alamos National Laboratory, MS G770, Los Alamos NM 87545
<P>
Neutron diffraction measurements of internal elastic strains during mechanical deformation are performed on Be-50%Al. The material is produced from hot isostatically pressed powder which is rapidly solidified using a gas atomization process. Under rapid solidification, Be-A1 undergoes liquid phase separation, and upon complete solidification two intimately interpenetrating phases exist. The resulting microstructure can be described as a three-dimensional interpenetrating composite, where each phase is continuous. Strain measurements are taken at the Los Alamos Neutron Scattering Center (LANSCE) using a pulsed neutron source, which provides time-of-flight diffraction data. The elastic strains in the individual phases are measured as a function of applied stress. This data is used to quantify the deformation behavior of each phase. The A1 phase is highly constrained by the Be phase due to the morphology of the composite as well as the high stiffness and low Poisson's ratio of Be. The results provide more insight into the overall deformation behavior of Be-Al.

DEFORMATION OF Al70Pd21Mn9 ICOSAHEDRAL QUASICRYSTAL WITH DECAGONAL PHASE LAMELLAE:</B><I> Hisatoshi Hirai</I>, Mater. Eng. Dept., Kyushu National Indust. Res.

<P>
In our previous work, we prepared Al70Pd21Mn9 icosahedral quasicrystal by zone melting technique. The obtained sample contained fine lamellae of decagonal phase Al69Pd13Mn18. The Vickers indentation test revealed that the existence of fine lamellae and annealing improved the fracture toughness of the sample to be about 2.1 Mpam1/2 which is about 1.5 times as large as those without lamellae. In this paper, we will report the results of high temperature creep test of the sample with fine lamellae. We will also discuss the effects of decagonal lamellae on the high temperature plastic deformation of icosahedral phase, if possible. Detailed results will be presented at the meeting.

THE PROCESSING AND PROPERTIES OF P/M FE-MN-AL ALLOYS:</B> Chun Sien Lin, Materials Research Laboratory, ITRI, Hsinchu, Taiwan ; Shih-Chin Chang, Dept. Materials Science and Eng., Tsing Hua University Hsinchu, Taiwan
<P>
Powder metallurgy processing of Fe-Mn-Al alloys was studied. FeMn-Al alloy powder was produced by mechanical alloying of commercially available pure Fe, Mn, Al and C powder. The effect of ball milling, composition, pressure and sintering conditions on the microstructure and mechanical properties of resulted specimens were studied. For standard Fe-30Mn-lOAl-lC composition, 12 hour ball-milling is enough for producing the fcc structure of Fe-Mn-Al alloy after compaction and sintering at a temperature of 1240&#176;C or higher. It is found that the hardness, strength and ductility of the sintered specimens increase with sintering density. The specimen compacted with 800 MPa and sintered at 13260&#176;C for one hour in Ar have a sintered density of 6.18 g/cm3 (94.3% of theoretical density), hardness of HRC 32, and 0.2% offset yield strength of 1026 MPa. These mechanical properties are comparable to that of conventional casted material and are much better than that of the P/M carbon or stainless steels.

LOAD RELAXATION AND SUPERPLASTIC DEFORMATION BEHAVIOR OF A PB-SN ALLOY:</B> Tae Kwon Ha, Young Won Chang, Center for Advanced Aerospace Materials, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang 790-784, Korea
<P>
The deformation characteristics of Pb-Sn eutectic alloy, a typical microduplex superplastic material, has been investigated. For this purpose, a series of load relaxation tests has been conducted to obtain the flow curves under the condition of a constant structure and the results have consequently been analyzed based on the recently proposed internal variable theory of structural superplasticity. The effects of grain size and volume fraction of constituent phases on superplastic deformation behavior of this eutectic alloy has also been examined. The boundary sliding in this two phase alloy was characterized as a viscous flow process with the power index value of Mg=0.5. This value is much less than the previously reported value of Mg=1.0 for GBS obtained in several single phase alloys. The optimum strain rate is found to shift into a faster region as the grain size decreases.

DAMAGE TOLERANCE IN BRITTLE MATERIALS:</B> R.O. Ritchie, Department of Materials Science and Mineral Engineering, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720
<P>
<P>A critical factor in the design of advanced materials for structural application is the development of sufficient damage tolerance, i.e., resistance to fracture and subcritical crack growth in the presence of pre-existing flaws. In practical terms, this implies designing microstructures with adequate fracture toughness based on toughening mechanisms that are resilient to cyclic loading, and where appropriate elevated temperatures and adverse environments. In this presentation, such considerations will be reviewed for a number of &quot;low ductility&quot; advanced materials, including ceramics (Si3N4, SiC) and intermetallics (g-TiAl, MoSi2, Nb3Al) in the form of monolithic, composite and layered materials.

PROCESSING, MECHANICAL BEHAVIOR, AND MICROSTRUCTURAL CHARACTERIZATION OF LIQUID PHASE SINTERED INTERMETALLIC-BONDED CERAMIC COMPOSITES:</B> C.B. Thomas, P.K. Liaw, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, The University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN 37996-2200; T.N. Tiegs, Metals and Ceramics Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN 37831-6115
<P>
Intermetallic-bonded ceramic (IBC) composites with various amounts of a WC or TiC carbide phase mixed with a Ni3Al or FeAl binder phase were successfully fabricated by liquid phase sintering and hot isostatic compaction methods. The influence of carbide type, binder type, and binder content on the flexural strength, hardness, fracture toughness, and corrosion resistance of IBC composites was investigated. Experimental techniques used to characterize the mechanical behavior included Vickers hardness, four-point flexure at 25 and 800&#176;C, indentation fracture, indentation strength, and mass loss corrosion testing. In addition, the microstructure was characterized using optical and scanning electron microscopy to examine the polished and etched microstructures, the cracks located at the corners of the hardness indents, and the fracture surfaces produced by flexure testing. Correlations were made between the mechanical properties of flexural strength and hardness and the microstructural parameter of contiguity. Experimental results indicate that the strength of IBC composites with Ni3Al at 800&#176;C compares favorably to the room-temperature strength. At 25&#176;C, plastic deformation of the Ni3Al and FeAl binders occurs, but the strength of the composite with FeAl is higher due to strong bonding along the carbide-binder interfaces. WC-based composites yielded higher flexural strength and fracture toughness values, while TiC-based composites produced higher hardness values. Increased binder amounts produced higher values of flexural strength and fracture toughness due to a reduction in the number of carbide-carbide interfaces and an increase in plastic deformation in the crack-tip region, respectively.

INTERFACIAL SLIDING ALONG SOLDER/INTERMETALLIC INTERFACES:</B> C. Zhang, D. Yao, J.K. Shang, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801
<P>
Intermetallic cells formed during reactive wetting of metal substrates often lead to a microcellular interface morphology. Evidence is given of interfacial sliding as the crack grows, along these interface, subcritically at very low strain energy release rates under cyclic loading. Physical model was constructed to capture the salient aspects of the interfacial sliding mechanism. The model predicted that the crack shielding should arise from interfacial sliding and the magnitude of the crack shielding depended on loading-mode, roughness of the interface, and sliding resistance of the interface. Experiments designed to test the validity of the model will be described and comparisons will be made between model predictions and experimental results.

MICROMECHANISMS OF CRACK-TIP DEFORMATION AND TOUGHENING TITANIUM ALUMINIDES IN INTERMETALLICS:</B> W.O. Soboyejo, C.

Aswath, Materials Science Program, Department of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Texas at Arlington, P.O. Box 19301, Arlington, TX 76019
<P>
The micromechanics of crack-tip deformation and toughening are elucidated for a range of <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">2- and <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">-based titanium aluminides. Crack-tip deformation is shown (via crack-tip transmission electron microscopy) to occur by a combination of microcracking and slip under cyclic loading. Toughening mechanisms in <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">2-based alloys (crack-tip blunting, bridging, deflection and microcrack shielding/anti-shielding) are also modeled using micromechanics. Similarly, the crack tip deformation and toughening mechanisms in gamma-based titanium aluminides (deformation-induced twinning and slip) are elucidated for a range of experimental and near commercial alloys. Micromechanical models are also presented for the prediction of toughening in gamma alloys. The paper shows clearly that crack-tip shielding mechanisms do not necessarily result in slower fatigue crack growth rates.

SHEAR LIGAMENT TOUGHENING AND MICROMECHANICAL MODELLING IN IRON ALUMINIDE INTERMETALLICS:</B> Scott X. Mao, Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada T2N 1N4
<P>
The fracture behavior of an iron aluminide intermetallica in air environment was studied. At room temperature, round tensile specimens were tested at different strain rates. By carefully examining the lateral surface of the tensile specimens, ligament-like structures that connected between microcracks were found. SEM pictures show that these structures, which can be called shear ligments, undergo ductile fracture by shearing. This type of fracture dissipates more energy and was believed to enhance the fracture toughness of the material. By use of a micromechanical model of shear ligment toughening, fracture toughness of the material, K, was estimated at different strain rate. The values of critical parameters, which are ligment length, area fraction and work to fracture by shear were obtained from SEM observations on different tensile specimens. K was found to be decreased towards lower strain rates. This strain rate effect was similar to that obtained experimentally. This outcome verified the importance of shear ligments in determining the materials fracture toughness.

MICROMECHANISMS OF CRACK-TIP DEFORMATION IN ZIRCONIA TOUGHENED INTERMETALLICS:</B> F. Ye, G-Y. Lu, P. Ramasundaram and W.O. Soboyejo, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, The Ohio State University, 2041 College Road, Columbus, Ohio 43210-1179
<P>
The micromechanisms of crack-tip deformation will be elucidated for zirconia toughened nickel aluminide and molybdenum disilicide intermetallic composites reinforced with partially stabilized zirconia particles with different particle sizes. The transformation toughening components associated with different stabilizers (ceria, magnisia and yttria) are also quantified using micromechanics models and experimental results obtained from laser Raman spectroscopy and optical interference analyses. Shielding contributions from other applicable toughening mechanisms are also discussed. Stable fatigue crack growth in zirconia toughened intermetallics is attributed to the effects of kinematic irreversibility due to stress-induced martensitic transformations under cyclic loading. The relative contributions from microcracking and slip phenomena (to kinematic irreversibility) are also discussed.

RELIABILITY OF FERROELECTRIC CERAMIC MULTILAYER DEVICES: </B> Z. Suo, X. Gong, Mechanical and Environmental Engineering Department, Materials Department, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA 93106<P>
In a multilayer actuator, each internal electrode terminates an edge inside the active ceramic. Around the edge, the nonuniform electric field generates an incompatible strain field, which, in its turn, generates stresses and may cause the ceramic to crack, leading to device failure. The industry has been exploring alternative electrode configurations to alleviate the stress concentration. The effort has been empirical and benefited little from numerical simulations. An inherent difficulty is that the actuator ceramics have nonlinear electro-mechanical interactions, of which no unified mathematical description is now available. This talk describes the basic phenomena, and a crack nucleation model that includes essential features of this nonlinearity. The model shows that, everything else being fixed, a critical layer thickness exists, below which a multilayer actuator will not crack around its internal electrode edges.

NON-LINEAR FRACTURE PROCESSES IN LAMINATED METAL COMPOSITES:</B> Don Lesuer, Bob Riddle, Chol Syn, L-342, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, CA 94551<P>
Numerous fracture processes exist in layered materials. These processes, which include crack bridging, crack deflection, stress redistribution and local plane stress deformation, will, in general, increase the fracture toughness of layered materials over that observed for non-layered materials. However, their specific influence on toughness (namely their influence on initiation toughness, growth toughness and R-curve behavior) is a function of the specific fracture mechanism active during crack growth. Many of these mechanisms compete with one another. The active mechanism(s) are strongly dependent on the material properties of the component layers, laminate architecture (such as volume fraction of the component materials and layer thickness), and interface properties. This paper will discuss the various fracture mechanisms in laminated metal composites (LMCs) containing alternating layers of ductile and brittle materials. The layers between these component materials have sharp interfaces. Specific systems include LMCs of an aluminum matrix composite and a monolithic aluminum alloy as well as ultrahigh-carbon steel and brass. Simulations of crack growth in these materials have been done using finite element analysis to study the non-linear fracture processes involved. The influence of component material properties, interface properties and laminate architecture on these processes will be described.

A QUANTIFICATION OF THE FABRIC STACKING SEQUENCE EFFECT ON THE MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF A 2-D WOVEN NICALON FIBER FABRIC REINFORCED SiC COMPOSITE:</B> Wei Zhao, Peter K.

Kupp, David P. Stinton, The Metals and Ceramics Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN 37831<P>
The mechanical behaviour of continuous fiber reinforced ceramic matrix composites is affected by several factors, such as: the type and thickness of fiber/matrix interface, the fiber strength statistical distribution and degradation after processing, the fabric stacking sequence of the laminate etc. For a 2-D plain woven Nicalon fiber cloth reinforced silicon carbide (SiC) with a SiC interfacial coating, little attention has been paid to the stacking sequence effect. In this paper, the fabric stacking sequence effects on the stress-strain distribution in flexural laminate bars, and the elastic properties of the laminate are calculated. A theoretical calculation model is established based on a combination of the classical laminated plate theory and an undulation model depicting fiber continuity and undulation shape, which is first developed by Chou et al. A closed-form FORTRAN program is compiled. Different combination of fiber lamina orientation and their stacking sequence are studied.

TOUGHENING AND FATIGUE PERFORMANCE OF BRITTLE AND SEMI-BRITTLE STRUCTURAL MATERIALS:</B> John J. Lewandowski, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH 44106<P>
Significant efforts are being devoted to the cost effective processing of advanced structural materials with unique combinations of stiffness, strength, toughness, and fatigue resistance. Such efforts are necessarily multi-disciplinary and often combine the skills of academic investigators in Materials Science and Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Civil Engineering, as well as other related disciplines with those from both the materials producer and user community. Recent work at CWRU in conjunction with a variety of collaborators has begun to investigate the factors controlling the magnitude of performance enhancement possible in brittle and semi-brittle systems where a variety of approaches to toughening are being explored. The presentation will overview recent research by the P.I. and his collaborators on a number of different materials systems where toughening is being accomplished via the incorporation of ductile/tough reinforcements. The presentation will follow with documenting the fatigue performance of such systems.

INTERFACIAL INTERLOCKING FROM POROUS OXIDES:</B> Z. Zhang, Z. Xing, J.K. Shang, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801<P>
Surface oxides on metals are often highly porous and the pore structure depends on oxidant and kinetics of oxidation. In this work, the oxide structure on aluminum-alloy surface was modified by chemical and electrochemical processes to produce different pore sizes and morphology. Interfacial bonds were then formed from these porous oxides and the crack growth resistance of the interfaces measured in air and corrosive environments. Significant differences were found among interfaces with different oxide microstructures. Micromechanical models were developed to determine the interlocking resistance from porous oxides. Based on the model, the role of interfacial interlocking in interfacial crack growth is discussed.

Fiber-reinforced ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) are being developed for a variety of high temperature components for gas turbine engines. Many of these components are complex in shape and will be subjected to local stress 
 concentration under normal service conditions. The presentation will focus on the effects of stress concentrating features such as sharp slits and circular holes on the tensile properties of CMCs. Modeling and experimental efforts aimed at improving our understanding of the relationship between the mechanisms of inelastic deformation and their effects on notched strength will be reviewed. Results on MAS/Nicalon and woven SiC/SiC systems indicate that the conditions for fracture in the regions around holes are stochastic in nature and depend on the volume under stress. An approach for implementing weakest link statistics for predicting notched properties will be outlined. Recent work has revealed that inelastic deformation is also attainable in all-oxide CMCs with strong interfaces and porous matrices. The notched properties of these materials will be presented and their behavior compared with that of systems with weak interfaces. Research sponsored by ARPA-URI, Grant N00014-92-J-1808.

CREEP DEFORMATION AND RUPTURE OF Al2O3 UNDER STATIC AND CYCLIC LOADING</B>: Darrell Socie, Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801
<P>
Results of the tension and torsion tests on a commercial grade of vitreous bonded, 99.8% Al2O3, show that creep deformation is enhanced significantly under shear stress. Microstructural observations show that extensive grain boundary sliding occurs in the torsion specimens and gives rise to a large initial creep deformation. Evidence of cavity formation is found throughout the specimen. Little evidence of grain boundary sliding or cavitation was found in the tensile specimen even though the tensile stress was four times larger. The combined action of one tensile stress <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/sigma.gif">1 and one compressive stress, -<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/sigma.gif">3, doubles the grain boundary shear stresses to 2<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/tau.gif">. This results in more grain boundary sliding and early cavity formation under shear loading. In addition the compressive stress will cause a wedging action on individual grains that will result in a grain facet stress of <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/sigma.gif">n. This stress will be added to the tensile stress, <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/sigma.gif">1 , to enhance cavity coalescence and microcrack growth.

AN INVESTIGATION OF FIBER/MATRIX INTERFACE OF A NICALON FIBER REINFORCED SILICON CARBIDE COMPOSITE WITH A SILICON CARBIDE INTERFACIAL COATING:</B> Wei Zhao , Peter K. Liaw, David C. Joy, Dept. of Materials Sciences and Engineering, The University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN 37996-2200; Elizabeth R. Kupp, David P. Stinton, The Metals and Ceramics Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN 37831
<P>
The mechanical properties of ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) can be controlled by tailoring the fiber/matrix interface, especially the type of interfacial materials and their thickness. A new Nicalon/SiC composite with SiC as an interfacial coating processed by a forced-flow chemical vapor infiltration (FCVI) method at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory demonstrates improved high-temperature oxidation resistance than that with a carbon interfacial coating. However, it is difficult to differentiate the SiC interface from the matrix using scanning electron micrographs, because of nearly identical microstructures and similar chemical compositions of the fiber, the matrix, and the interfacial coating. In this paper, the line-scan chemical analysis technique in scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is used to investigate the SiC interfacial coating. As-received and oxidized specimens are studied. The existence of elements, such as Si, C, O, and Cl, and their distributions along the fiber/matrix interface, are detected. The profile of interface chemical composition can be used to identify interface structure as well as thickness. The effect of interface composition on mechanical properties is also studied.

CRACK NUCLEATION ON ELASTIC POLYCRYSTAL SURFACE IN CORROSIVE ENVIRONMENT:</B> Z. Suo, H. Yu, Mechanical and Environmental Engineering Department, Materials Department, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA 93106
<P>
This paper analyzes a process of crack nucleation on the surface of a ceramic subject to a stress parallel to the surface, in an environment where the ceramic evaporates slowly and deforms elastically. Both grain boundary tension and elastic stress concentration cause the surface to groove along its intersections with the grain boundaries. Two behaviors are identified. If the applied stress is small, the grooves approach an invariant shape, and the ceramic erodes by gross mass loss. If the applied stress is large, the grooves sharpen into crack fronts, and the ceramic breaks by decohesion. The models relate crack nucleation threshold and time to the applied stress, surface and grain boundary tensions, chemical free energy, grain size, and kinetic parameters. Surface self-diffusion is also included in the analysis.

ROLE OF GRAIN BOUNDARY PHASE DURING HIGH-TEMPERATURE FATIGUE-CRACK GROWTH IN CERAMICS:</B> J. K. Shang, D. Yao, C. Huang, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801
<P>
Role of grain boundary phase on high-temperature fatigue-crack growth were examined in a TiB2/SiC composite and polycrystalline aluminas of different purities at 800-1100&#176;C. The low-purity alumina and the composite contained a continuous film of glassy phase on the grain boundary while the high-purity aluminas contained either little or no continuous grain boundary phase. In the low-purity alumina and the composite, fatigue crack growth rate increased drastically as the cyclic frequency was decreased. The cyclic crack growth rate was slower that the creep crack growth rate at the same maximum stress intensity. In contrast, fatigue crack growth in the high-purity alumina was relatively insensitive to cyclic frequency and the fatigue crack growth rate was faster than the creep crack growth rate for the same maximum stress intensity. The difference in the fatigue crack growth behavior is explained in terms of the different fatigue crack growth mechanisms in these ceramics.

THE MECHANICAL BEHAVIOR OF CONTINUOUS FIBER REINFORCED CERAMIC COMPOSITES (CFCCs):</B> N. Miriyala, P.K. Liaw, C.J. McHargue, The University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN 37996; L.L. Snead, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN 37831
<P>
The mechanical behavior of two Nicalon fabric reinforced ceramic matrix composites, with alumina and silicon carbide as the matrix materials, respectively, were investigated. Four point-bend tests were conducted at ambient and elevated temperatures to study the monotonic and cyclic fatigue behavior. The stress-strain curves were non-linear for both composites, at ambient as well as elevated temperatures. During cyclic loading, the modulus of the composite was monitored to serve as a measure of the loss in load bearing capacity of the composites due to cyclic fatigue loading. Progressive damage in the composites was monitored by optical and electron microscopy techniques. The differences in the composite monotonic and cyclic fatigue behavior, depending on the orientation of the fabric plies to the loading direction, and the micromechanisms responsible for the differences, will be the focus of the paper.

<P>EFFECT OF COLD WORKING ON THE OMEGA PHASE IN BETA TITANIUM ALLOYS: </B>M.Saqib, N. Stefansson, R. Srinivasan, I. Weiss, Department of Mechanical and Materials Engineering, Wright State University, Dayton, OH 45435
<P>
High specific strength, excellent corrosion resistance, good cold formability and age hardening response are some of the attractive properties of the metastable <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/beta.gif"> titanium alloys. The effect of cold deformation on the stability of <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/omega.gif"> phase present in metastable <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/beta.gif"> alloys is not clearly understood. In this study, two <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/beta.gif"> titanium alloys: TIMETAL 21S and TIMETAL LCB were fast cooled from above the <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/beta.gif">-transus temperatures and subsequently cold rolled to total reductions ranging from 5 to 35%. The fast cooled microstructure consisted of <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/beta.gif"> phase with dispersion of athermal <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/omega.gif"> precipitates. Selected area electron diffraction patterns from the as-cooled and the cold rolled specimens revealed the presence of diffuse intensity maxima at 1/3&lt;112&gt;<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/beta.gif"> and 2/3&lt;111&gt;<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/beta.gif"> locations, characteristic of the presence of <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/omega.gif"> phase. The average integrated intensities of the diffuse maxima from the <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/omega.gif"> phase and the sharp diffraction spots from the <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/beta.gif"> phase were measured using microdensitometer. The intensity ratio; (diffuse intensity) <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/omega.gif">/(diffraction spots intensity) <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/beta.gif"> was used as a measure of the relative volume fraction of the <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/omega.gif"> phase in the <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/beta.gif"> phase matrix. The volume fraction of the <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/omega.gif"> phase was found to decrease linearly with an increase in the amount of cold deformation both alloys.

<P>GRAIN BOUNDARY NIOBIUM-RICH CARBIDES IN INCONEL 718*:</B> Ming Gao, Robert P. Wei, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering and Mechanics, Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA 18015
<P>
In a previous study, niobium was identified as the principal embrittling element for oxygen-enhanced crack growth in nickel based alloys, such as Inconel 718. Niobium was believed to come principally from the oxidation and decomposition of niobium-rich carbides at the grain boundaries. To better establish their type density and distribution, g.b. carbides in Inconel 718 that were exposed by crack growth at 700&#176;C or by hydrogen embrittlement were characterized by SEM and EDS. The carbides were also analyzed by high-resolution AEM. Two types of carbides were identified; those associated with the primary NbC, and those (secondary carbides) that formed during heat treatment. The results will be presented and discussed in relation to environmentally assisted crack growth.

<P>THE INFLUENCE OF CARBON LEVEL ON SULFIDE PARTICLE DISTRIBUTIONS IN TITANIUM MODIFIED STEELS OF THE AF1410 TYPE:</B> <I>Luana E. Iorio,</I> Warren M. Garrison, Jr., Dept. of Materials Science and Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA 15213
<P>
Earlier studies showed that small titanium additions to the 0.10 wt. % carbon steel HY180 lead to the gettering of sulfur as particles of Ti2CS. The Charpy impact energy of HY180 when sulfur is gettered as MnS is about 160J but increases to about 270J when sulfur is gettered as Ti2CS. The improvement in toughness is attributed to the particles of Ti2CS being more resistant to void nucleation than particles of MnS. The effects of small titanium additions on sulfide and other second phasae particle distributions and the toughness of AF1410 steel at carbon levels of 0.16 wt% and 020 wt% are being investigated. The results indicate that titanium additions lead to a substantial improvement in toughness at a carbon level of 0.16 but the improvement in toughness is less at a carbon level of 0.16 but the improvement in toughness is much less at a carbon level of 0.2. The objective of the work reported here is identification of sulfide type and measurement of sulfide size in these two higher carbon steels. Because of the large number of possible sulfides of titanium the major emphasis has been on identifying sulfide type from transmission electron microscopy diffraction results.

<P>HIGH TEMPERATURE PHASE STABILITY OF THE YTTRIA STABILIZED t' PHASE ZIRCONIAS:</B> <I>James S. Smith</I>, Fu-Jen Pan, Jan-Fong Jue, Materials and Systems Research Inc., 1473 S. Pioneer Rd., Salt Lake City, UT 84104; Kevin T. Zysk, AEDC/DOT, 1099 Avenue C, Arnold Air Force Base, TN 37389-9011
<P>
Yttria doped zirconias containing 3 to 8 mole% stabilizer were fabricated by (i) sintering at 1450&#176;C and (ii) heat treating at 2100&#176;C for 15 minutes with a gas fired furnace to obtain (i) regular tetragonal (t) and cubic (c) phase, and (ii) largegrained tetragonal (t') and c phase materials, respectively. The materials were annealed at temperatures between 1100&#176;C and 2000&#176;C in air for various times. The effect of annealing time and temperature as well as cooling rate on the phase stability of the t' phase zirconia will be discussed. A working T-T-T diagram will be proposed. High temperature bending strength and compressive strength data will be presented. The possibility of precipitation strengthening in the annealed samples will also be addressed.

<P>PHASE STABILITY IN NbCr2-BASED LAVES PHASE ALLOYS:</B> J.H. Zhu, P.K. Liaw, Department of Materials Science and Engineering The University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN 37996; C.T. Liu Metals and Ceramics Division Oak Ridge National laboratory Oak Ridge, TN 37831-6115
<P>
Phase stability in NbCr2-based transition-metal Laves phases is studied in this paper, using data from binary X-Cr, Nb-X, and ternary Nb-CrX phase diagrams. It was shown that when the atomic size ratios are kept identical, the average electron concentration factor (e/a = the average number of electrons per atom outside the closed shells of the component atoms) is the determinate factor in controlling the phase stability of NbCr2-based transition-metal Laves phases. The e/a ratios for different Laves phase structures were determined as follows: with e/a &lt; 5.76, the C15 structure is stabilized; at an e/a range of 5.88-7.53, the C14 structure is stabilized; with e/a &gt; 7.65, the C15 structure was stabilized again. A further increase in the electron concentration factor (e/a &gt; 8) leads to the disordering of the alloy. The electron concentration effect on the phase stability of transition-metal A3B intermetallic compounds and Mg-based Laves phases is also reviewed and compared wit'n the present observations in transition-metal Laves phases. Finally, experimental results on Cr-Nb-Cu ternary system were also presented and explained in light of the e/a ratio correlation with phase stability.

<P>THE MARTENSITIC TRANSFORMATION CURVES FOR SHAPE MEMORY ALLOYS:</B> H.Y. Yu, Naval Research Laboratory, Mechanics of Materials Branch, Code 6380, Washington, D.C. 20375-5343
<P>
The mechanical behavior of shape memory alloys is closely related to the martensitic phase transformation. A martensitic transformation is considered to be a first order solid state structural transformation that is diffusionless and whose initial phase maintains metastability. Conventional models, such as the &quot;exponential model&quot; and the &quot;cosine model&quot; do not describe the martensitic transformation satisfactorily. In this study, the martensitic transformation curves for thermoelasaticity and pseudoelasticitiy are obtained by using the principle of energy balance. The results are in good agreement with experimental results for steels and nitinol alloys.

<P>RULE OF ADDITIVITY IN PHASE TRANSFORMATIONS:</B> David T. Wu, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, Yale University, P.O. Box 208284, New Haven, CT 06520
<P>
The rule of additivity is used to predict CCT diagrams from TTT diagrams. Avrami showed that a nucleation and growth reaction is additive if it is isokinetic. Later Cahn proposed site-saturation as another condition for additivity to hold. This talk presents more general conditions under which the rule of additivity is valid.

<P>REVISITING THE EFFECT OF CURVATURE ON CHEMICAL POTENTIAL FOR BINARY SYSTEMS:</B> <I>N. Kulkarni, </I>R T. DeHoff, 253A Rhines Hall, Depas1ment of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, F1-32611
<P>
The effect of curvature on the chemical potential for binary systems, at constant temperature and pressure, is usually given in the literature by the Gibbs-Thomson equation. Many forms of this equation have appeared in the literature, that can be shown to be incorrect and in violation of the condition for chemical equilibrium for a two-phase system. A simple self-consistent procedure to derive the Gibbs-Thomson equation for binary systems is provided. The resultant equation for the chemical potential shift is independent of the solution model and has an inverse dependence on the width of the two-phase field.

<P>METRIC AND TOPOLOGICAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE RATE OF CHANGE OF BOUNDARY LENGTH IN TWO DIMENSIONAL GRAIN GROWTH:</B> R.T. DeHoff, Department of Materials Science Engineering, 253A Rhines Hall, University of Florida, Gainesville, Fl-32611 
<P>
The boundary in a two dimensional grain structure decreases its length during grain growth. Four distinct processes may contribute to this length change: 1) The smooth motion of the grain edges toward their centers of curvature; 2) Migration of cell corners resulting from the edge motion; 3) The annihilation of small grains (topological process b); 4) The switching process (topological process II). Using von Neumann's assumption that the local velocity is proportional to the local boundary curvature and geometrically general kinematic equations, the contribution of each of these four processes is assessed The result is a kinetic equation in which the metric and topological contributions to the rate of grain growth in two dimensions are made explicit.

A TWO-LIQUID SLAG MIXING EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUE FOR STUDYING THE OXIDATIVE PRE-FUMING TREATMENT OF LEAD BLAST FURNACE SLAG:</B> Adrian Deneys, David Robertson, and Nick Schupp Center for Pyrometallurgy, University of Missouri-Rolla Rolla, MO 65401
<P>
An experimental technique has been devised for studying the reaction kinetics of the homogeneous, liquid phase reaction: ZnO+FeO = Zn(g)+Fe203, by which zinc evolution can occur from a molten Al203-CaO-FeO-Fe203-SiO2-ZnO bath in the absence of a carbonaceous reductant. When studying the reaction kinetics by heating from room temperature, solid state reactions and poorly defined melting points may obscure the starting point of the reaction. In order to eliminate this problem, an experimental technique was devised whereby two molten slags could be melted independently, and then mixed, to provide a well defined starting point from which to begin taking measurements. Two crucibles were mounted in a vertical reaction cylinder. The upper, mild steel, crucible had a bottom pouring plug which was sealed by a steel stopper rod. A fayalite mixture was contained in this crucible. The lower crucible contained an Al203-CaO-SiO2-ZnO mixture. Once the two slags had been melted, the steel stopper rod was removed from the upper crucible. The upper, reduced slag (fayalite in equilibrium with the upper steel crucible), drained into the lower crucible where the two slags were mixed by submerged argon stirring. Dip samples were taken to measure the zinc content of the final mixture as a function of time. The experimental procedure will be described, as well as results of experiments which were conducted on synthetic slags. The system investigated was similar to the lead blast furnace slag which is produced by the primary lead smelters of Missouri, USA.

QUENCH DROSSING OF LEAD BULLION:</B>: <I>Funsho K. Ojebuoboh</I>, Asarco Inc., Technical Services Center, 3422 South 700 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84119

New technology has been developed for drossing lead bullion. The technique was developed to replace conventional copper drossing, so-called rough crossing, performed in kettles. With quench drossing, water granulation of bullion exiting the smelting furnace, usually above 900&#176;C (1700&#176;F), is used to arrest equilibrium formation of the dross species. The process is based on granulating lead bullion from the furnace, thereby quenching the bullion, and subsequently sweating lead off the granules in a rotary kiln furnace. The major benefit of the new technology is expected to be reduced air-borne lead which is normally associated with conventional drossing. The process also has the potential of making lead crossing metallurgy more susceptible to better process control. The process and its development are described.

RECYCLING OF MAGNESIUM ALLOY SCRAP, A NECESSITY:</B> Christine Brassard, <I>Lisabeth Riopelle</I>, Oddmund Wallevik, Hydro Magnesium Market Development Center, 21644, Melrose Avenue, Southfield, MI 48075-9705
<P>
The use of magnesium alloys is growing rapidly, particularly in die cast parts for the automotive industry. Supporting this growth in the future means that Mg has to be an economically and ecologically attractive material, and recycling of alloy scrap becomes a necessity. What kinds of magnesium scrap will be on the market? What are the opportunities and challenges for this emerging recycling industry? Different recycling processes have been developed, and operation facilities are today recycling large volumes of class 1 diecast returns based on a flux refining technology. Characterization of the recovered metal demonstrates that the performance of appropriately recycled magnesium alloy is comparable to an alloy made from primary electrolytic metal. The sludge generated from this process can also be recycled through the existing primary Mg operations in order to close the environmental loop.

THE REACTION MECHANISM OF OXIDIZED CHALCOPYRITE CONCENTRATE PARTICLES AND COPPER MATTE WITH IRON SILICATE SLAG</B>: <I>K. Fagerlund1</I>, P. Nurrni1, H. Jalkanen1, P. Taskinen2, 'Helsinki University of Technology, Laboratory of Metallurgy, Vuorimiehentie 2, FIN-02150 Espoo Finland; 2Outokampu Research Oy, P.O.BOX 60, SF-28101 Pori, Finland
<P>
The reaction mechanism and settling behaviour of oxidized chalcopyrite particles and coppper matte droplets introduced into synthetically prepared fayalite type slag under nitrogen and argon atmosphere have been investigated in this work. As a part of the investigation into flashsmelting reaction phenomena in a settler region, a laboratory experiments were conducted by means of a X-ray image system and a vertical tube furnace. The reaction phenomena of oxidized chalcopyrite in iron silicate slag was studied in a tube furnace, temperature being 1300&#176;C, and inert gas flow (N2). The partly oxidized samples of chalcopyrite were blown into synthetic fayalitic slag. Reaction products were studied and analysed using light optical microscope (LOM), scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) and chemical methods. Industrial copper matte and oxidized chalcopyrite were introduced into iron silicate slag. The melting and settling behaviour, the variation of the copper matte droplet shape and the movement of melting interface were continuously monitored by X-ray image system.

<P>
Technology developed and first implemented in the United Kingdom enables very low grade non ferrous scraps containing sils, organics, plastics and ferrous metals to be directly charged, without pretreatment, into a unique melting furnace. Two furnaces have been in full scale production for over four and two years, respectively. A third furnace was only recently commissioned. The oxy-fuel-based furnace design incorporates internal afterburning in the furnace's hot zone, producing excellent thermal efficiency and very low emissions. Advanced process control insures complete combustion of all volatiles in an environment that is not oxidizing to the melt. Thus metal yields have been excellent. The furnace is very low in Nox. This paper will provide both theoretical background and extensive operating results for this new melting concept. Applications describing both purpose built new furnaces and retrofits of existing reverberatory furnaces will be presented. Extensive operating emissions data will be presented.

OXYGEN ENHANCEMENT OF BURNERS FOR IMPROVED PRODUCTIVITY:</B> <I>D.J. Krichten,</I> W.J. Baxter, C.E. Baukal, Air Products and Chemicals, Inc., 7201 Hamilton Blvd., Allentown, PA 18195
<P>
A method of retrofitting air-fuel burners with oxy-fuel capability overcomes the potential problems associated with oxygen combustion in aluminum melting furnaces. Several years of operation in rotary furnaces reclaiming dross and UBC scrap and since 1993 in revereratory furnaces prove the usefulness of the retrofit approach. The retrofit burner uses the existing combustion air connection, burner housing, and burner tile and replaces the gas tube with an oxy-gas burner. Maintaining a portion of the air flow to the burner reduces the potential for localized overheating. This technique optimizes the mix of air and oxygen to the burner for the given furnace geometry and meltrate desired. Proper design of the burner reduces Nox emissions by moderating the flame temperature with furnace gas recirculation. Economic analysis of using merchant oxygen shows the benefits are increased productivity and reduced overall unit cost of melting. In practice, the melt rate in rotary furnaces increases by up to 50% and by up to 35% in reverberatory furnaces. Oxygen enhancement reduces melting cost by 1/2&#173;3/4 cents per pound of aluminum melted.

THE REDUCTION BEHAVIOR OF HEMATITE COMPACTS BY H2 and H2-CO GAS MIXTURES:</B> <I>I.J. Moon</I>, C.H. Rhee, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang 790-784, Korea
<P>
The reduction behavior of hamatite by H2 and H2-CO gas mixtures was investigated to elucidate the reduction mechanism at 1073~1223K. The hetatite compacts were made by Cold Isostatic Pressing to produce compacts of uniform shape and size. The compacts were sintered at 1273K for 30 min., and showed a contraction of 29%. Mercury pressure porosimeter and BET technique were used for measuring the total porosity, pore size distribution and pore surface area of the compacts. Reduction was followed up by means of weight-loss technique using Cahn Balance (Model: TG-171, capacity 10g, accuracy &#177; 10 &#181;g.) Microscopic examination (SEM, EPMA), X-ray, and carbon analysis were used to correlate the structure of reduced compacts with the mechanisms of reduction and carbon deposition. The values of apparent activation energy for H2 reduction were between 11.21 kcal/mol and 14.38 kcal/mol. Structural changes, kinetics, and mechanisms of reduction and carbon deposition with H2 and H2-CO gas mixtures is discussed.

MECHANISM OF NB TRANSFER TO HOT METAL FROM SLAG:</B> Fan Peng, Yang Tianjun, Zhou Yusheng, Dong Yicheng, Wei Shoukun, Sichuan Union University, P.O. Box 373, Chengdu, Sichuan, 610065, China
<P>
Nb-bearing iron ores are today the most significant source of niobium in China. Ferroalloy of Nb, as the main product of Nb recovered from Nb-bearing iron ores, is recently produced by the following route. Nb-bearing iron concentrate is reduced in a blast furnace to generate Nb-bearing hot metal, which is then smelted in a converter to yield Nb-enriched slag. Finally Nb- enriched slag is reduced in an electric furnace to get ferroalloy of Nb. In order to improve the recovery ratio of Nb, it is important to acquire a deep understanding on how Nb is transferred to hot metal from slag. In the present work, raw material containing niobium oxide were carbothermally reduced under the conditions of calm metal-slag interface or stirred metal-slag interface, respectively. Under the former condition, the quenched samples were found through SEM observations that NbC layer occurred at the metal-slag interface. In this case, Nb transfer to hot metal from slag slows down and the rate controlling step is Nb diffusion in NbC layer. Under the later conditions, it was found that no NbC layer occurred at the metal-slag interface, indicating that NbC formed at the interface sunk into hot metal due to the higher density of NbC than that of hot metal. In this case, the rate controlling step is Nb diffusion in slag.<P>

<P>SEPARATION OF RARE EARTHS, THORIUM AND URANIUM DURING MONAZITE PROCESSING BY SOLVENT EXTRACTION USING 2-ETHYL HEXYL PHOSPHONIC ACID MONO 2-ETHYL HEXYL ESTER:</B> <I>N.S. Narayanan</I>, V.R. Nair, V.D. Narayanan, Indian Rare Earths, Limited, Rare Earths Div., Udyogamandal, 683 501, Kerala State, India
<P>
Monazite, one of the major sources of rare earths, is normally opened by digestion with hot concentrated caustic soda solution. Caustic digestion dissolves phosphate and leaves a hydrated mixed metal oxides cake containing thorium, uranium and rare earths. By leaching this cake with hydrochloric acid at pH 3.0 to 3.2 bulk of the rare earths are preferentially removed and separated. The slurry left after removal of major portion of rare earths contains all the thorium and uranium present in the feed monazite. In addition this slurry also contains substantial quantities of rare earths. Solvent extraction tests were carried out to develop a process to separate rare earths, thorium and uranium present in the mixed chloride solution obtained by dissolving the above slurry in hydrochloric acid.

<P>PREPARATION OF DYCL3 BY DEHYDRATION IN A FLUIDIZED BED:</B> <I>Johan Sundstr&ouml;m</I>, Department of Metallurgy, Division of Process Metallurgy, The Royal Institute of Technology, S-100 44, Stockholm, Sweden.
<P>
Anhydrous DyCl3 was prepared from its hexahydrated mother-compound by batch-wise and continuous dehydration using a fluidized bed. A gas mixture of variable composition between argon and HCl was used. The productivity was high, reaching values of 0.28 mol H2O/m2xs during the dehydration to DyCl3xH2O and 0.079 mol H2O/m2xs during the dehydration to DyCl3. By using an overall reaction rate equation, developed from previous findings it was possible to predict the outcome of the continuous fluidization process. The fluidization process efficiency decreases drastically when water content is below DyCl3xO.1H2O. Therefore, in a final treatment the last traces of water were removed by slowly purging gas through a fixed bed.

<P>
In the present work the vaporization processes and thermodynamic properties of the DyF3-Dy2O3 system were studied at the temperatures 1173-1423 K in the concentration range from the individual DyF3 to the individual Dy2 by the Knudsen effusion mass spectrometric method. It was found, the DyF3, DyOF, Dy2OF4 molecules were the main species in vapour. The DyF3 activity in the DyF3-Dy2O3 system was calculated by comparing the total ion currents of dysprosium triufluoride over the system and the individual component. The influence of the cell material (Pt, Mo, Ta) on the concentration of the DyF3, DyOF, Dy2OF4 vapour species in the gaseous phase over the DyF3-Dy2O3 was illustrated. Results, obtained in the present study are in agreement with the available information on the phase diagram of the DyF3-Dy2O3 system.

Nanocrystalline mixtures of Nd2Fe14B and <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/variation.gif">-Fe have been synthesized by mechanical milling and heat treatment. The samples exhibit isotropic magnetic behaviour, with significant remenence enhancement associated with exchange coupling across the interfaces of hard and soft magnetic phases. Magnetic Phases. Magnetic properties are found to depend on the volume fraction of the <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/variation.gif">-Fe phase and heat treatment. The effect of alloy additions to increase the saturation magnetization of the soft phase and the magnetocrystalline anisotropy of the hard phase has also been investigated.

<P>NOVEL TECHNIQUE FOR THE PREPARATION OF SINTERED YBCO:</B> <I>M.I. Hussain</I>, F A. Khwaja, Mazhar Hussain, Anwar-Ul-Haque, Department of Physics, Quaid-I-Azam University, Islamabad, Pakistan., Department of Chemistry, Quaid-I-Azam University, Islamabad, Pakistan 
<P>
We report on the preparation of YBCO sintered sample by a novel technique named &quot;Explosion Method&quot;. The stoichiometric ratio of the compounds were mixed and the powder was encapsulated in the quartz tube. The capsule exploded at 16-hours for specific mass of the product and the size of the tube. The powder was pelletized and characteristic properties were checked. The detailed investigation is carried out on the mass of the product and the size of the capsule which plays an important role in the preparation of superconducting phase, in this method. It has been observed that explosion is important for the superconductivity. The absence of annealing is an advantage in this process, however, the sample deteriorate with time.

Misch metal based intermetallics are currently employed as reversible hydride-forming electrodes in Ni - Metal Hydride batteries with 30% KOH electrolyte. In spite of the thermodynamic instability of rare earths in this medium, these electrodes retain storage hydrogen ability and support rapid electron transfer for hundreds of hydriding-dehydriding cycles. Results of electrochemical and XPS studies of one such intermetallic MmNi3.5Co0.8Al0.7, have led to the development of a model to explain these properties.

The Joule-Thomson expansion of hydrogen gas offers a method to produce temperatures below 30K for use in cryocollers in space surveillance satellites. Metal hydrides are a critical components of these devices, providing a non-mechanical method to compress the hydrogen gas. The LaNi5-xMnx-hydrides have potential applications in cryocooling devices: Luo and coworkers1 presented detailed studies on their hydriding behavior. In this study, thermal aging behavior of two LaNi-5-xMnx-hydrides (x=0.4, and 1.5) was investigated to evaluate its long term stability. The hydriding behavior of La1.02Ni4.6Mn0.4 did not change significantly after thermal aging at 453K for 260 hours.

EFFECT OF RARE EARTH SUBSTITUTIONS FOR La ON THE HYDROGEN ABSORPTION OF La-BASED AB5 ALLOYS:</B> <I>C.O. Bounds</I>, B.M. Ma, J. Patel, Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc, Rare Earths and Gallium, CN 7500, Cranbury, NJ
<P>
The performance of Ab5-type alloys for hydrogen absorption including the electrochemical absorption as an electrode for rechargeable batteries has been demonstrated to be a complex function of the composition, microstructure and surface condition. The compositional studies have focused primarily on substitutions for Ni on the B-site (e.g. Co, Al, Mn, etc.). This current study examines the effect of rare earth substitutions for La on the A-site and considers both other &quot;light&quot; rare earths (Ce, Nd, Pr) and &quot;heavy&quot; rare earths (Dy, Sm, etc.).

<P>
<P>A series of LaNi5-based alloys, with partial substitution of Ni by Al, Co, or V, were prepared. The gas-phase hydrogen absorption kinetics and pressure-Composition-temperature curves were measured. The activation became easier and the plateau pressure was reduced as Ni was partially substituted by Al. Substitution with Co reduced the hysteresis as well as the hydrogenation capacity. Less degradation of hydrogenation capacity after long cycles of hydriding- dehydriding was observed when substituted with both Al and Co. Vanadium is often considered as a hydride former, but when it was added to LaNi5 it was found that V occupied the B site. A small amount of substitution of Ni with V led to a higher hydrogenation capacity and faster activation rate.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN RARE-EARTH-BASED ADVANCED PERMANENT MAGNET MATERIALS: FACTORS AFFECTING ACQUISITION AND STABILITY OF COERCIVITY:</B> <I>L.H.

Sellers, Idaho National Engineering Laboratory, Lockheed Idaho Technologies Co., Idaho Falls, ID 83415-2211, V. Panchanathan, Magnequench International, Inc., 6435 Scatterfield Road, Anderson, IN 46013
<P>
The basic relationships that link the microstructural properties of advanced permanent magnet materials to the magnetic hysteretic properties such as the magnetic hysteretic properties such as the coercivity are subtle and often<P>
difficult to quantify. These difficulties are magnified when the magnetic materials are fabricated by methods such as rapid solidification, which has the potential to produce non-equilibrium phases and structures in a nano-scaled matrix.

Nd-Fe-B POWDERS FOR BONDED MAGNETS--AN OVERVIEW:</B> <I> V. Panchanathan</I>, Magnequench International, Inc., 6435 Scatterfield Road, Anderson, IN 46013<P>

The rapidly solidified Nd-Fe-B powders form the entire basis of the bonded magnet industry. At present the rapid solidification is carried out exclusively by melt spinning, a technique in which a stream of molten alloy is directed onto the outer surface of a rapidly spinning wheel, producing flake like particles having highly stable and magnetically hard microstructure. These particles are comminuted into powder before being processed into bonded magnets. These powders are magnetically isotropic. These powders are magnetically isotropic. The bonded magnets made using these powders range in energy product of 5 MGOe for injection molded magnets to about 12 MGOe for compression molded varieties.

MAGNETISATION MECHANISMS IN EXCHANGE COUPLED MAGNETS:</B> <I>R. Street</I>, Research Centre for Advanced Mineral and Materials Processing, The University of Western Australia, Nedlands, WA 6907, Australia<P>
Nanocrystalline composites containing grains of hard (typically RE/TM alloys) and soft (typically <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/variation.gif">-Fe) magnetic materials exhibit the commercial useful property of remanence enhancement. The modelling of remanence enhancement in terms of inter- and intra- grain magnetic exchange coupling will be explained. The results of measurements of the magnetic properties of Nanocrystalline remanence enhanced magnets prepared by mechanochemical and melt quenching processes will be described.

RARE EARTH-BASED GIANT MAGNETOSTRICTIVE MATERIALS:</B> <I>S.F. Cheng</I>, Naval Surface Warfare Center, Silver Spring, MD 20903; A.E. Clark, Clark Associates, Adelphi, MD 20783<P>
Among the many extraordinary features of the rare earths are their magnetic and magnetoelastic properties. The rare earths, e.g., Tb, Dy, Nd, Sm, are known worldwide for their large magnetocrystalline anisotropy and magnetization, which has led to the importance of magnetic rare earths as vital ingredients of modern permanent magnets. In this paper, we focus on the <I>strain dependence</I> of these giant effects which gives rise to huge magnetostrictions, magnetomechanical couplings, and E effects. Magnetostrictions greater than 10-3 have been measured at temperatures as high as 250&#176;C. At low temperatures Magnetostrictions reaches ~10. No other solid state material can match these values.

McCallum, Dept. of Materials Sci. &amp; Engineering, Iowa State Univ., Ames Laboratory, Ames, IA 50011<P>
A corrosion study of a bonded NdFeB permanent magnet material alloyed with titanium carbide additions has been undertaken. Bonded magnets produced by rapid solidification of the alloy and consolidation in a polymer matrix are<P>
attractive due to lower cost, greater durability, and useful shape-forming ability. Melt spinning is used to produce ribbons of the desired composition. The ribbons are formed by the ejection of molten alloy onto the surface of a rotating wheel. The samples tested were ribbons of different composition and wheel speed. Commercial epoxy was used as a bonding medium.

ANODE EFFECT IN NEODYMIUM OXIDE ELECTROLYSIS:</B> Rudolf Keller, Kirk T. Larimer, EMEC Consultants 4221 Roundtop Road, Export, PA 15632
<P>
In the electrolysis of neodymium oxide from a molten fluoride electrolyte, anode effects may occur at the carbon anodes, interfering with smooth cell operation. In laboratory experiments, we attempted to circumvent this problem selecting electrolytes with a high oxide concentration, possibly at relatively low rare earth content, but cathodic deposition was not satisfactory. A regime at higher cell voltage was discovered to yield good cell performance, but evolution of considerable amounts of fluorocarbon compounds suggested that a reactive treatment of the off-gases would be necessary for environmental acceptability. Subsequent experimentation at low cell voltage revealed conditions for satisfactory operation without occurrence of anode effects and without any formation of CF4 and C2F6.

THERMODYNAMIC MODELING OF CALCIOTHERMIC REDUCTION OF NdF3:</B> P.T. Velu, <I>R.G. Reddy</I>, Department of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering, The University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487
<P>
Production of neodymium metal by reduction of NdF3 with calcium in the presence of calcium chloride is studied. The thermodynamic calculations of the reduction process was carried out using method of minimization of Gibbs energy. Yield of neodymium metal was calculated as a function of temperature and salt composition. Nd increased with increase in temperature and also increase in CaCl2. Impurity content of the alloy decreased with increase in CaCl2. The calculated data is an excellent agreement with the large scale experimental data.

IMPROVEMENT OF MAGNETIC PROPERTIES OF NANOCOMPOSITE NdFeB MELT SPUN RIBBONS BY ELEMENT SUBSTITUTION:</B> <I>W. C. Chang</I>, S. H.

<P>
The magnetic properties of the nanocomposite NdFeB melt spun ribbons are strongly determined by the remanence, coercivity and the squareness of its demagnetization curve. In this paper, three approaches in improving the magnetic properties of <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/variation.gif">-FE/Nd2Fe14B type nanocomposite melt spun ribbons will be addressed: (1) the effect of Co substitution for Fe on the remanence enhancement (2) the effect of La substitution for Nd on the improvement of remanence and the squareness of the demagnetization curve and (3) the effect of Cr substitution for Fe on the enhancement of the coercivity and the squareness of the demagnetization curve.

THE MAGNETIC PROPERTIES AND CRYSTALLIZATION PHENOMENA OF MELT EXTRACTED Nd9.8Fe90.2-XBX (X=6 through 11) FILAMENTS:</B> Q. Chen, <I>B. M. Ma</I>, C.O. Bounds, Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc, Rare Earths and Gallium, CN 7500, New Jersey
<P>
Recently, Nd-lean and/or boron-rich melt spun materials have attracted attention as potential materials for bonded magnet applications. Since the alloys can deviate significantly from the stoichiometric Nd2Fe14B composition, additional phases are usually present in the products. The size and volume fraction of these phases play important roles in determining the strength of exchange coupling interaction between phases and, consequently, the magnetic properties obtained. It is of interest to know how the Nd and/or boron contents impact the crystallization behavior and the magnetic properties of these materials. An alloy series of Nd9.8Fe90.2-xBx, where x=6 through 11 was prepared by a newly developed melt extraction technique at various wheel speeds.

MAGNETIC REFRIGERATION: </B><I>Karl A. Gschneidner, Jr.</I> and Vitalij K. Pecharsky, Ames Laboratory and Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Iowa State University, Ames, IA 50011-3020
<P>
Magnetic refrigeration is based on the magnetocaloric effect (MCE), i.e. the temperature change (usually an increase) of a magnetic material near its mag netic ordering temperature due to the application of an external magnetic field. For many lanthanide materials the temperature increase is sufficiently large that one can utilize these materials as magnetic refrigerants. The best materials are those which order ferromagnetically and contain a heavy lanthanide metal Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, or Er, and possibly Nd, since the available magnetic entropy, and therefore, the cooling power is proportional to the total quantum number, J. Generally antiferromagnetic, ferromagnetic and spin glass behaviors are not nearly as effective as ferromagnetic ordering. Studies to date have indicated that the MCE can be used as a method for the ligquefaction of cryogenic gasses, freezers for food processing plants, supermarket chillers and large scale building air conditioning.

RARE EARTH RAW MATERIALS AND APPLICATION MARKETS: A BALANCING ACT:</B> J.M. Tourre, Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc Rare Earth and Gallium 25 Quai Paul Dourmer, 92408 Courbevoie Cedex, France
<P>
1995 has seen a continuation of a positive trend in the Rare Earth industry. The availability of greater diversity of raw materials has brought additional flexibility to the producers permitting better economics. China remains the major raw material source; Chinese concentrate producers have increased capacity in 1995 (Baotou, Sichuan, etc..). China's role in the Rare Earth industry will continue to evolve; the acquisition of a majority equity position in Magnequench by San Huan will have significant impact on both the Rare Earth and Magnet markets. Chinese producers are increasing the quality of their products and realize their true values. The Chinese market, itself, is also changing as the internal needs for the separated rare earths grow.

THE COMMERCIAL SIGNIFICANCE OF MIXED-LANTHANIDE DERIVATIVES:</B> Barry T. Kilbourn, Molycorp, Inc., Fairfield, N.J
<P>
It is not widely appreciated that, currently, the largest consumption byfar of lanthanides is in <I>mixed</I>-lanthanide forms. Such forms are based on either &quot;natural-ratio&quot; or &quot;modified natural-ratio&quot; materials, where the &quot;natural-ratio&quot;
<P>
is the inherent blend of the Ln elements in the dominant ore bodies. The reason for the choice of mixed-lanthanides is simplesuch forms are the most economical. The same economics will obviously apply to new technologies under development such as, for example, solid oxide fuel systems based on lanthanide-containing ceramics and nickel-lanthanide hydride battery systems. Their commercialization depends on the availability and the economic accessibility of suitable raw materials, and, in many cases, that will mean using <I>mixed</I>-lanthanide derivativesnot pure lanthanide compounds. The production process from ore to mixed-lanthanide derivatives will be traced.

Re-BASED METAL HYDRIDES AND NiMH RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES:</B> <I>L.Y. Zhang</I>, Ph.D., Energizer Power Systems, Gainesville, FL 32614
<P>
The current status of metal hydride alloys for NiMH batteries was systematically reviewed. Extensive application-oriented R&amp;D has successfully made the NiMH batteries an important part, with growing potential, among rechargeable batteries. The rare earth-based metal hydrides (AB5) have been considered the best alloy material for use in the negative electrode in NiMH batteries. However, being in demand for high performance by electronic markets, the still young NiMH industry is facing serious technical challenges in developing better products. Among other efforts to respond to the challenges, advanced AB5 alloys are in great demand: the capacity enhancement race requires new or improved alloys processing higher volumetric capacity; high corrosion resistance when subjected to electrochemical cycling. Finally, price competition mandates MH materials with ow cost.

HIGH PERFORMING Sm(Co,Fe,Cu,Zr)z POWDERS FOR THE BONDED MAGNET APPLICATION</B>: W. Gong, B.M. Ma, and C.O. Bounds, Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc, Rare Earths and Gallium, CN 7500 Cranbury, NJ 08512
<P>
The outstanding thermal stability and high energy product make Sm (Co,Fe,Cu,Zr)z type alloys attractive for advanced applications. The near net-shape production of Sm(Co,Fe,Cu,Zr)z bonded magnets make them potentially superior to any magnets made by sintering. Although pioneering work done by Shimoda et al. And other investigators provide insights on the nominal compositional selection and process control of this alloy system, additional work is still necessary to improve our understanding of alloy behavior at various processing stages and to increase the production yield during powder processing. In this paper we report on the development of anisotropic Sm(Co,Fe,Cu,Zr)z alloy powders for the bonded bonded magnet application.

APPROXIMATE SOLUTIONS FOR STRAIN HARDENING SOLID WITH A CRACK:</B> <I>Yu G. Matvienko</I>, Mechanical Engineering Research Institute, Russian Academy of Sciences, 4 Griboedov Street, 101830 Moscow, Russia
<P>
A working out of nonlinear fracture mechanics criteria and application of calculation methods requires the availability of solutions to elastic-plastic crack problems. Such solutions depend on details of deformation behaviour of materials. For most cases the solutions must be computed numerically and that could be connected with some difficulties. Therefore, a working out of approximate analytical solutions is an actual problem. New analytical solutions relate J-integral to applied stress, notch (crack) geometry and strain hardening. The method is based on stress concentration analysis near a notch-crack tip in strain hardening solid. Approximate analytical J-solutions are calculated in accordance with the theoretical stress concentration factor formulas of Neuber for several crack configurations: elliptical notch in infinite plate, deep grooved shaft, deep double etch notch, shallow double notch in tension. The important role of J-integral is a measure of the intensity of the near-tip stress and strain that can be written in the form of the HRR-singularity. So, to assess J-dominance for fully plastic conditions the HRR-model and the method based on an equation of equilibrium was employed. It was assumed that (i) the characteristic size of the singularity is determined by the condition of the equality of the singularity stress and the applied stress, (ii) the force, that is not transmitted by the crack, is counterbalanced by the additional force of the singularity stress field depends strongly on the crack size and weakly on hardening. To predict the behaviour of a crack in ductile materials it is necessary to use non-linear fracture mechanics criteria. One such criterion can be associated with the failure assessment diagram (FAD) which merges the two extreme brittle fracture and plastic collapse. New FAD has been obtained from the energy balance taking into account crack tip blunting and difference between the energy of surface stresses and the surface energy.

<P><B>ESTIMATION OF DUCTILE FRACTURE TOUGHNESS FROM TENSILE TESTS FOR ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS:</B> <I>S.K. Ray</I>, A.K. Bhaduri and P. Rodriguez, Fracture Mechanics Section, Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research, Kalpakkam 603 102, India
<P>
<P>An empirical method for characterizing the ductile fracture toughness using two parameter (viz., <I>Gf</I> and <I>hf</I>) that can be determined from tensile test data of smooth cylindrical specimens has been evolved for engineering applications by Ray, Bhaduri and Rodriguez (herein after referred to as the <I>RBR</I> method). This stipulates that the post-necking regime during tensile deformation is demonstrated by microvoid growth and coalescence processes, and therefore the energy absorbed in this regime can be used to estimate the resistance of the necked region to ductile fracture. The test procedure employed is simple, and does not require gauge-length extensometry. The test is carried out in a screw-driven machine at constant cross-head speed, with on-line deformation of the load train. The method of computing <I>RBR</I> parameters, <I>Gf</I> and <I>hf</I> from the tensile test data at ambient and elevated temperatures, is described.
<P>
With <I>Wpn</I> the energy absorbed by the specimen from necking to fracture and <I>An</I> the uniform cross-sectional area at the necking point, the parameters <I>GfWpn/An</I> estimates the average energy per unit cross-sectional area required to cause fracture. Also, with <I>Af</I> as the minimum cross-sectional area of the neck at fracture, <I>ln(An/Af)</I> measures the average longitudinal plastic strain perpendicular to the plane of the neck accumulated from the point of necking to fracture. Therefore, the parameter, <I>&#165;f=Gf/ln(An/Af)</I> estimates the average incremental plastic energy per unit volume by the specimen per unit longitudinal plastic strain at the neck to sustain the fracture process. In the post-necking regime of tensile deformation with progressive development of the neck, the absorption of energy tends to get increasingly confined to the near-neck section, and therefore <I>Gf</I> and more so <I>&#165;f</I> reflect the resistance of this region to microvoid growth. Hence, for an initially homogeneous ductile specimen, the <I>RBR</I> parameters estimate the toughness in a severely work-hardened condition and for a state of stress which is a combination of uniaxial tensile and hydrostatic stresses. For a specimen with gradient in toughness along its length, for example a transverse-weld specimen the neck is expected to initiate at the section least resistant to microvoid growth. For such a specimen, therefore the <I>RBR</I> method automatically determines the toughness of the weakest section, without a prior knowledge as to its location or the need for placing a notch or crack in the section. The advantage of the <I>RBR</I> method has been successfully exploited to characterize the effect of aging of three different dissimilar metal weld (DMW) joints viz. (i) an Alloy 800/2.25Cr-1Mo steel joint (at 300 K), (ii) an Alloy 800/9Cr-1Mo steel joint (at 300 K) and (iii) a type 316LN stainless steel/Alloy 800 joint (at 773 K), including determination of the optimum post-weld heat treatment (PWHT) temperature determined from the<I> RBR</I> toughness parameters is identical to that determined by the conventional method of correlating the microstructure with conventional tensile properties. For the Alloy 800/9Cr-1Mo steel DMW joint, the <I>RBR</I> toughness parameters led to unambiguous identification of the optimum PWHT temperature while the conventional structure-property method failed to do so. The efficacy and sensitivity of the two new ductile fracture toughness parameters have also been demonstrated.

<P>There are several ways of approaching the problems of fracture. One of them is through algorithmic modelisation. We follow the ideas of a stochastic process, i.e. the most extreme situation, in order to find whether general behaviors of fracture phenomena can be quantified and if so through which ingredients. We use the numerical power of coarse grain cases allowing for easy access to asymptotic time regimes. Atoms on sites in a two dimensional plane are supposed to be ejected inside or outside an initial boundary. Several &quot;percolation/fracture-like&quot; path were found as a function of size. The concentration of the various crack thresholds, the distribution of clusters, the fractal dimension of the cracks were obtained. Power law features were indicative of essential processes. It will be shown that the rules give sometimes rise to &quot;healing processes&quot;.

<B>ATOMISTIC STUDIES OF CRACK PROPAGATION:</B> <I>Diana Farkas</I>, Vijay Shastri, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA 24061-0219
<P>
We will present the results of atomistic studies of fracture in ordered intermetallic alloys using the embedded atom method. The propagations of cracks is studied through atomistic computer simulation with particular emphasis on the competition between crack propagation and dislocation emission processes at the crack tip. The boundary conditions for these simulations are obtained from continuum elasticity theory and the region close to the crack is allowed to relax in order to achieve the minimum energy configuration. The atomistic simulations enable the study of the local atomic configuration at the crack tip in a realistic crystal structure and its importance for crack propagation. The studies include the simulation of crack structure and propagation in the presence of dislocations, in an effort to contribute to the modeling of ductile fracture processes.

<B>COMPARISION OF LOCALIZED NECKING CRITERIA USED IN FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSIS OF SHEET METAL FORMING OPERATIONS:</B> Sriram Sadagopan, <I>Robert H. Wagoner</I>, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, The Ohio State University, 2041 College Road, Columbus, OH 43210
<P>
Localized necking is one of the most common failure modes limiting formability in technological sheet metal forming operations. Prediction of localized necking for general three dimensional components using finite element simulations can be very useful in die/process design. Different failure criteria, based on macroscopic quantities, are used to predict localized necking. This presentation will compare the results from these different failure criteria for some standard geometries. The effect of applied boundary conditions on these results will also be discussed.

<P>
Micromechanisms of tensile deformation and fracture in a metastable beta Ti-15V-3Cr-3Al-3Sn alloy are elucidated in this paper. Tensile deformation is shown to be associated with significant levels of microplasticity at stress levels above ~10% of the tensile yield strength. Microplasticity in the so-called elastic regime is shown to occur via shear localization and concomitant slip band formation; grain boundary sliding; subgrain formation; stress induced a phase precipitation; and atomic flow mechanisms that are not fully understood at present. Ductile fracture is also shown to initiate by decohesion around a precipitates produced largely via stress-induced precipitation. Catastrophic failure in the metastable beta Ti-15V-3Cr-3Al-3Sn alloy is shown to occur by the coalescence of microvoids produced via decohesion around a precipitates. Attempts are made to model the ductile fracture processes using classical ductile fracture theories. The implications of the microplasticity phenomena are also discussed within the context of elasticity and plasticity theories.

<B>DAMAGE EVOLUTION IN HYPO- AND PSEUDO-EUTECTIC Al-Si ALLOYS:</B> <I>Tz. Kamenova</I>, R. Doglione, J.L. Douziech, C. Berdin and Dominique Fran&ccedil;ois, &Eacute;cole Centrale Paris, Laboratoire De M&eacute;chanique, Grande Voie des Vignes, F-92295 Ch&acirc;tenay-Malabry Cedex, France
<P>
The evolution of fracture processes in an hypoeutectic and in an eutectic Al-Si cast alloys has been studied by means of in situ tensile tests SEM observations. Chilled and cast alloys were investigated. It has been established that the damage initiates at low strains (of the order of 0.5%) by fracture of the largest Si particles, situated at the periphery of eutectic colonies. When the strain increases, finer and finer particles break within the colonies. In the hypereutectic alloys further straining induces a concentration of the damage along the fine interdentritic particles alignments. This leads to the formation of intensive slip bands in these regions followed by microcracks coalescence. The cracks thus created stop at the eutectic colonies, until final fracture by their propagation. The validity of the Weibull statistics to describe the number of cracked Si particles as a function of the applied load was proven. It was also observed that the volume increase of the microcracks was very small. These observations allowed to build a model of damage evolution based on micromechanics of inclusions at two different scales, that of eutectic colony and that of the whole specimen, yielding the fracture probability in the various zones.

<P>
When fracture occurs by micro-void coalescence the fracture toughnesses of structural steels are controlled by both the inclusion distribution and the fine-scale microstructure. The characteristics of the inclusion distributions which influence toughness include volume fraction, spacing and void nucleation resistance. The effects of inclusion distributions on toughness are, however, not independent of the fine-scale microstructure and the extent to which varying characteristics of the inclusion distributions influences toughness can depend on the fine-scale microstructure. This talk will focus on three areas. First the effects of inclusion spacing and void nucleation resistance of inclusion particles will be discussed. Second, the degree to which such effects are influenced by fine-scale microstructure, in particular austenite grain size, will be considered. It has been found that the most effective way of minimizing the detrimental effect of inclusions on fracture toughness is to getter sulfide as titanium carbo-sulfide as particles of titanium carbo-sulfide are more resistant to void nucleation than particles of other sulfides such as MnS. Therefore, the third topic to be considered will be the effect of alloy composition on the formation of as titanium carbo-sulfide.

The effect of mode I and mixed-mode I/III loading on the fracture behavior of a vanadium alloy containing 4 wt% Cr and 4 wt% Ti (V4Cr4Ti) was investigated at room temperature. The V4Cr4Ti alloy was annealed at 1000&#176;C for 1 hour in vacuum. Compact tension (CT) specimens were used to study mode I properties and modified compact tension (MCT) specimens were used for mixed-mode I/III. A MCT specimen is the same as a CT specimen except the principal axis of the crack plane is slanted at an angle of 25 and 45 degrees from the load line. When the crack angle is equal to zero, a MCT specimen becomes a CT specimen. With the MCT specimen, an applied load can be resolved to mode I load (Pi) and mode III load (Piii) at the crack tip. The mixities [Piii/Piii+Pi] used were 0, 0.32 and 0.5 for crack angles 0, 25 and 45 degrees, respectively. It was found that the introduction of Piii dramatically lowered fracture toughness of V4Cr4Ti alloy. The mechanism how mixed-mode I/III loading affects fracture behavior of the V4Cr4Ti alloy is discussed.

We investigate the propagation of a semi-infinite, mode III crack at constant KIII. At each time step, crack can grow and/or screw dislocations can be emitted from the crack tip. This model incorporates dislocation interactions with the crack, other dislocations, and all image dislocations. The emitted dislocations can significantly shield the crack. Dislocation-dislocation and dislocation-crack interactions are calculated using the fast multipole method applied within a stress-function framework. Dislocation-crack interactions are described using a conformal mapping procedure. Dislocation microstructures, generated from the crack tip, are shown over a wide range of loading rates. With increasing loading rate, a transition is observed from ductile-to-brittle behavior. However, even when the crack propagates in a brittle manner, significant dislocation emission occurs first. The dislocation microstructures observed are very complex and highly organized. As the load continues to increase, several distinct transitions in dislocation microstructure are observed. The effects of pre-existing dislocation network within the material are also examined. The dislocation network is strongly modified by the crack, decreases dislocation emission from the crack tip and, after evolution in the crack tip field, provides some crack tip blunting.

<B>MECHANISMS OF DUCTILE FRACTURE IN PURE SILVER UNDER HIGH-TRIAXIAL STATES: </B><I>Michael E. Kassner</I>, Department of Mechanical Engineering and The Center for Advanced Materials Research, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR 97331
<P>
Experimental and finite element method (FEM) analyses were used to study the mechanisms of ductile fracture of constrained, high purity, silver interlayers under high triaxial stress states. Interlayer bonds loaded in simple tension develop a principal stress state that is large and axisymmetric. Ductile, plastic-strain failure was observed in these bonds when the maximum mean stress to yield ratio () approached approximately four, in agreement with recent numerical analyses by other investigators, who postulated unstable growth of a cavity subjected to a far-field axisymmetric stress state at this ratio, without significant far-field plastic strain. Ambient temperature delayed-failure (creep) tests of constrained silver interlayers, at relatively low applied loads, also appear to be due to unstable cavity growth. The mechanism of ductile fracture was further studied by biaxially loading these interlayers through the application of various combinations of tension and torsion loads. Low macroscopic-strain ductile fractures are again observed, but the axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric failure-stress values and FEM analysis of the stress levels required for cavity instability do not directly support an unstable growth model, even when considerations for plastic incompatibilities across grain boundaries are considered. Other ductile fracture theories such as cavity nucleation and interlinkage warrant consideration.

<B>THE EFFECTS OF STERILIZATION AND OXIDATION ON THE FRACTURE OF 'ARTIFICIAL CARTILAGE' (ULTRA-HIGH MOLECULAR WEIGHT POLYETHYLENE):</B> <I>Thomas J. Mackin</I> and Jeff Windau, Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1206 West Green Street, Urbana, IL 61801
<P>
Ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE; 4x103 g/mole) is commonly used as artificial cartilage in orthopedic implants. Several processing methods are used to fabricate the stock material, followed by machining, and gamma-irradiation sterilization prior to final implantation. Over the 15 year anticipated lifetime, cyclic and tribological loading change the properties of the material. The need for improved implant lifetimes motivated a detailed investigation of the relationships between processing/sterilization and properties in UHMWPE. Gamma irradiation changes the mechanical properties by promoting enhanced crystallization, while lifetime aging results in the formation of carbon-oxygen groups that change the subsequent properties. Both effects improved the ductility of the materials and led to overall improvements in yield strength, tensile strengths elastic modulus. These results are in sharp contrast to previous studies where any increase in crystallinity decreased the ductility of the UHMWPE. A broad array of experimental techniques were utilized to verify the measured changes in microstructure and properties. We will report on these changes in mechanical properties coupled with a fractographic analysis of failed specimens to relate the mechanisms of ductile failure in UHMWPE to the microstructural changes brought about by production, fabrication, sterilization and aging of these implant materials.

<P>
As fracture mechanics has developed as a discipline, many parameters have been developed to characterize the instability condition. However, a majority of this work has been confined to the investigation of mode I fracture. Thus, we have standardized methods for experimentally determining KIC, JIC and J-resistance curves for mode I crack propagation. However, cracks in real materials can be subjected not just to tensile stresses but to complex stress states so that the development of suitable parameters to characterize mixed-mode crack initiation and propagation is important in the evolution of suitable design criteria. Further, observations indicate that initially flat cracks in some tough materials tend to reorient themselves to oblique planes during growth. For these materials, crack propagation can be said to occur under combined mode conditions. A considerable amount of work on mixed mode I/III fracture toughness of materials is available. The superposition of mode III loading results in drastic reduction in fracture toughness in some materials whereas in other materials it has little effect or even results in an increase in the fracture toughness. Fracture mechanism maps delineating regions of susceptibility to tensile and shear loads have been proposed. In this paper, data on a wider range of materials, including steels, aluminum alloys, metal matrix composites, ceramics and polymers will be used to extend and reinforce the fracture mechanism map concept.

<B>EFFECTS OF STRESS STATE ON DEFORMATION AND FRACTURE OF STRUCTURAL MATERIALS:</B> John J. Lewandowski, Dept. of Materials Science and Eng., Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH 44106
<P>
The deformation and fracture of structural materials is significantly affected by changes in the microstructure and imposed stress state. Such changes in stress state may affect the micro-mechanisms of failure whereby a material which normally fails in a ductile manner may undergo a ductile-to brittle transition. In other cases, the imposition of a more severe stress state may accelerate the stages of ductile fracture to such an extent that very low ductility is obtained. The imposed stress state may be easily changed via testing notched specimens or via testing with confining pressure in monolithic materials. The presentation will review previous and ongoing work investigating the effects of stress state on the fracture of a variety of metallic materials, including more recent work on metallic composites.

<B>EFFECT OF HYDROGEN ON THE MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF LOW CARBON STEEL:</B> B. Sarkar, D. Mukerjee, R&D Centre for Iron and Steel, Steel Authority of India Limited, Ranchi-834002, India
<P>
The effect of hydrogen on the mechanical properties of a low carbon steel has been investigated. In-situ tensile and hardness tests have been carried out while charging hydrogen. It has been observed that there is a substantial reduction in ductility as a result of hydrogen charging while there is no change in hardness. The strain hardening exponent (n) value decreased from 0.26 to 0.22 ( a decrease of about 15%) whereas, the total elongation decreased from a value of 44.2% to 33.8% (a fall of about 24%) as a result of hydrogen charging. This is suggestive of the fact that hydrogen charging affects all the stages of ductile fracture. Hydrogen charging has been found to increase the number of dimple nucleating sites. Consequently there was a decrease in the average dimple size. It is believed that the effect of hydrogen on the reduction of ductility is more prominent in the post necking region. It has been concluded that hydrogen charging enhances the number of dimple nucleating sites which promotes the process of ductile fracture.

<P>The developing understanding of fracture by hole growth is reviewed, 
with mention of unsolved problems: Tipper in the late 1940's showed not only 
the idealized limiting micro-mechanisms of fracture by cleavage and by 
hole growth, but also the current problems of linkages of holes by irregular 
fine cracks and cleavage with concurrent plastic deformation. 
Both micromechanisms can lead to either ductile or brittle structures; the 
Irwin-Williams stress intensity concept K; the Paris fatigue crack correlation; 
elastic-plastic fracture instability in sheet, the Hutchinson, and Rice and 
Rosengren annular J-fields for initial and early growth of cracks in power-law 
materials; The K-T and J-Q extensions; fracture mechanics for predicting the 
behavior of large structures from tests on small, perhaps fully plastic specimens; 
traditional and fitness-for-service design and maintenance; the finite 
element method; its strength, current limitations, and needs; history effects, 
including the wolf's ear fracture, very low cycle fatigue, and torsion; micro-models 
of crack formation and growth; McClintock and Gurson; extreme value 
idealizations in statistics; cooperative and multi-stage problems; crack 
roughening and three-dimensional effects; recent work on rigid-plastic;

<P>ELASTIC-PLASTIC FRACTURE MECHANICS OF STRENGTH-MISMATCHED INTERFACE CRACKS:</B> <I>David M. Parks, </I>S. Ganti, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139
<P>
Recent progress in rationalizing and predicting the diverse ductile and brittle cracking behaviors seen in a given structural alloy under monotomic loading (i.e., shallow versus deep cracks; tension versus bending; ductile growth versus cleavage, etc.) has rested critically upon improved characterizations of elastic-plastic crack-front stress and deformation fields. For macroscopically homogeneous elastic-plastic materials, these improved descriptions of the crack-front fields typically include a parameter such as <I>J</I> or <I>CTOD</I> which scales the intensity of crack-tip deformation, as well as a parameter such as the <I>T</I>-stress or the <I>Q</I> parameter which accounts for the triaxiality of the crack-tip fields. When a crack lies along or near a planar material interface across which there is a significant gradient in plastic deformation resistance, the local stress and deformation fields exhibits features which differ both in magnitude and in kind from the homogeneous fields noted above. Such conditions are encountered in strength-mismatched weldments, in which the flow strength of the weld metal, <I>Ywm</I>, differs that of the baseplate, <I>Ybp</I>. Major features of such strength-mismatched interface fields are that (i) for a given macroscopic characterization of crack-tip deformation (in terms of <I>J</I> or <I>CTOD</I>), deformation preferentially focuses in the softer material, and (ii) stress triaxiality in the softer material exceeds that attainable in even the most severe of the homogeneous fields noted above. We review basic features of strength-mismatched interface crack fields as determined from finite element solutions under well-constrained and fully plastic conditions, for a range of strength mismatches and strain hardening behaviors. The fields can be well-described with slip-line fields appropriate to the level of strength-mismatch. Implications of these fields for the toughness of interface cracks are noted.

<P>IN-PLANE CONSTRAINT EFFECTS IN ELASTIC-PLASTIC FRACTURE MECHANICS: </B><I>John W. Hancock</I>, J. Li, A.D. Karstensen, A. Nekkal, Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Glasgow, Scotland G12 8QQ, UK
<P>
McClintock (1971) has shown that under plane strain conditions, the fully plastic flow fields are not unique, but depend on geometry and loading. In mode I, the loss of uniqueness is shown to originate from the nature of the elastic field and in particular the sign of the non-singular <I>T</I> stress. The nature of these fields is elucidated by constructing a family of plane straw slip line fields (Du and Hancock 1991). As such they belong to a family of fields which can be described by <I>J</I> and a second parameter which determines the level of crack tip constraint (<I>Q/T</I>). This family of fields are deviatorically similar but differ largely hydrostatically (O'Dowd and Shih 1991, Beteg6n and Hancock 1991). Boundary layer formulations have been used to infer the force on mixed mode slip line fields in contained yielding (Hancock, Karstensen and Nekkal 1996). These differ from those discussed by Shih (1974) in that plasticity does not surround the crack tip, due to the occurrence of an-elastic wedge on the crack flanks. Both mode I and mixed mode fields for weakly stain hardening materials can be interpreted as belonging to a single family such that constraint loss by mixed mode loading. This gives a family of fields which differ largely hydrostatically on the plane of maximum hoop stress. Finally slip line fields for cracks on the interface between a rigid subsume and a perfectly plastic material, subject to mixed mode loading have been constructed, and these are also discussed in terms of constraint effects (Li and Hancock 1996). Experimental data on the effect of in plane constraint on fracture toughness is discussed within the framework of two parameter fracture mechanics. Finally the methods by which constraint enhanced toughness can be used in safety cases based on failure assessment diagrams is discussed (MacLennan and Hancock 1995).

precipitates of Al2Cu, through coarsening, permits control of the effective

<P>THE ROLE OF FRICTIONAL CRACK SLIDING ON THE COMPRESSIVE FAILURE OF ICE AND ON ITS BRITTLE-TO-DUCTILE TRANSITION:</B> <I>Erland M. Schulson</I>, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Thayer School of Engineering, 8000 Cummings Hall, Darthmouth College, Hanover, NH 03755
<P>
In 1962 McClintock and Walsh pointed out that frictional sliding across the surface of closed cracks inclined to the direction of loading is an important element in brittle compressive failure. The friction reduces the effective shear stress on the crack plane and so lowers the stress concentrated at the crack tip. Frictional sliding thus increases the far-field stress for out-of-plane wing crack initiation and growth, thereby raising the failure stress (e.g., Brace and Bombolakis 1963, Nemat-Nasser and Horii 1982, and Ashby and Hallam 1986). This paper will show that the brittle compressive failure of ice can be understood in terms of the frictional crack sliding/wing crack mechanism, and that its brittle-to-ductile transition can be explained by incorporating crack-tip creep.

<P>
Mode I crack initiation and growth under plane strain conditions in tough metals have been successfully simulated using an elastic-plastic continuum model which accounts for void growth and coalescence ahead of the crack tip. A row of void-containing cell elements is placed on the symmetry plane ahead of the initial crack. These cell elements incorporate the softening characteristics of the hole growth and its strong dependence on stress triaxiality. Under increasing strain, the voids grow and coalesce to form new crack surfaces thereby advancing the crack. The material parameters are the Young's modulus, yield stress and strain hardening exponent of the metal and two additional parameters, <I>D</I> and <I>fo</I>, characterizing the dimension of the cell element and the initial volume fraction of the void centered within the cell. Once the above material parameters have been calibrated for the material under investigation, the model can be applied to compute relationships among load, load-line displacement and crack advance with no restrictions on the extent of plastic deformation and crack advance [Xia and Shih, (1995a and 1995b)]. The model has been applied to several specimen geometries which are known to give rise to significantly different crack tip constraints and crack growth resistance behaviors. Computed results are compared with sets of experimental data for two tough steels. Details of the load, displacement and crack growth histories are accurately reproduced [Xia, Shih and Hutchinson, 1995]. Suitably defined measures of crack tip loading intensity, such as those based on the J-integral can also be computed; however such crack growth resistance curves no longer play the central role in this approach. The above model has been employed in the transition regime where a crack initiates an grows by ductile tearing but final failure can occur catastrophic cleavage fracture. Crack growth causes significant alterations in the stress field, the process zone size, the competition between ductile and brittle processes and the sampling volume. The effects are accounted for by incorporating weakest link statistics into the cell element model. The cleavage fracture model also takes into account the increase of sampling volume with crack growth and the competition between void nucleation from carbide inclusions and unstable inclusion cracking which precipitates catastrophic cleavage fracture. Load-displacement behavior, ductile tearing resistance and transition to cleavage fracture are discussed for several different test geometries and a range of microstructural parameters. The model predicts trends in the ductile/brittle transition region that agree with experimental data [Xia and Shih, (1996)].

DETERMINING THE J-CRACK GROWTH RESISTANCE BEHAVIOUR OF A DUCTILE MATERIAL: </B><I>Edward Smith</I>, Manchester Materials Science Center, Manchester University and UMIST, Grosnover Street, Manchester M1 7HS, UK
<P>
Ductile fracture has been the major theme of Frank McClintock's research career. This paper is concerned with the determination of a ductile material's crack growth resistance behaviour when it is expressed in terms of the deformation J-integral <I>JD</I>. Attention is focussed on the determination of the crack growth resistance curve from load, load-point displacement and crack extension measurements using single loaboratory test specimen. A commonly used procedure is based on the separation of <I>JD</I> into an elastic component <I>JE</I> and a plastic component <I>JDP</I>, and the ability to express <I>JDP</I> for a non-growing crack in terms of the plastic energy integrals via eta factors that are independent of the applied loadings. The paper highlights the conditions which must be satisfied for <I>JDP</I> to be expressed in this way, and the limitations of some currently used practices based on this <I>JDP</I> formulation are indicated. Against this background, the author reviews his &quot;two extremes&quot; procedure, whereby the appropriate eta factors are obtained by ensuring that <I>JDP</I> assumes the correct form at the two extreme levels of deformation: small-scale yielding and extensive deformation at limit load conditions. Determination of the eta factors requires only a knowledge of the stress intensity factor and the limit load solutions, and not the material flow properties. The &quot;two extremes&quot; procedure is validated by comparing its predictions with well documented results for specific geometrical configurations. However, the procedure can be applied to any geometrical configuration, and the paper provides some examples.

PREDICTING THE DUCTILE-TO-BRITTLE TRANSITION IN NUCLEAR PRESSURE VESSEL STEELS FROM CHARPY SURVEILLANCE SPECIMENS:</B> <I>James A. Joyce</I>, Department of Mechanical Engineering, U.S. Naval Academy, 590 Holloway Road, Annapolis, MD 21402
<P>
One important application of elastic-plastic fracture mechanics has been to assure the structural integrity of nuclear reactor pressure vessels. Present toughness requirements are based on the postulation of a large defect size, the use of dynamic test data to give lower bound toughness values, and the use of safety factors on the allowable stresses. As vessels have aged the material toughness has degraded and the ductile-to-brittle transition has shifted toward the vessel operating temperature. Extrapolating this process means that many existing vessels will not meet the present toughness requirements well before the end of their design lives. The need to superimpose multiple safety factors, as is presently done has thus been questioned, and much recent research has been directed toward lessening the toughness requirements while maintaining a high level of structural integrity. The situation remains difficult, however, at least in part because only Charpy specimens are available as surveillance specimens for many commercial reactor vessels, and these specimens are too small to obtain any type of &quot;valid&quot; fracture toughness information using standard ASTM methods. Presently a lower bound KIR toughness curve is shifted relative to reference temperature RTNDT and used to define the ductile-to brittle transition. The RTNDT is thus a very critical value, and difficulties have arisen because of the wide variability that can result in its estimation. Recent work by ASTM Committee E08 has proposed a method to obtain a new reference temperature and a method to define using a probabilistic approach, a median ductile-to-brittle transition curve from a set of six properly tested small samples which would in many cases be precracked Charpy specimens. This method seems to be very robust, predicting a reference temperature with small variability. From the results of these specimens a &quot;master curve&quot; can be developed defining the median ductile-to-brittle transition curve as well as statistical confidence bounds. This curve is plant specific and could be used to assure that the pressure vessel had adequate toughness for continued operation. This paper presents a large data set on two pressure vessel steels, A515 and A533B, obtained to investigate the newly proposed ASTM test method. Data is available on a large number of precracked Charpy specimens, as well as data on standard IT C(T) and SE (B) specimens. Additional data is also available on large specimens, specimens with shallow cracks (a/W = 0.1), and surface cracked geometries tested in tension, bending, and combined tension and bending. Most specimens demonstrated cleavage failure - in some instances after significant amounts of ductile crack extension. Since the data sets are not presently complete, how well the new procedure fares cannot be determined. The applicability of constraint quantification and correction techniques that are presently being developed separately by this project will be included in the final analysis. The comparison of the large and small specimens, the surface cracked and through cracked specimens, and the predominantly bend and tensile loadings should allow a clear determination of the value of the new proposed ASTM &quot;master curve&quot; approach.

<P>A COMMON FORMAT APPROACH FOR APPLYING DUCTILE FRACTURE MECHANICS:</B> <I>John D. Landes+</I> and J. R. B. Cruz*, +Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN 37996; IPEN, *S&atilde;o Paulo, Brazil (on leave to the University of Tennessee)
<P>
<P>Applications of ductile fracture mechanics methods to prediction of structural behavior can be done using numerical or analytical methods. Numerical methods can be more accurate but are often beyond the capability of ordinary engineering organizations. Also the result may have relevance only to the specific structure being analyzed. Analytical methods have often used a failure diagram approach in which the failure load of a structure can be estimated. A ductile fracture methodology proposed by <I>Landes, et. al. </I> took the load versus displacement for a laboratory specimen and through a series of analytical steps predicted the load versus displacement behavior for a structural component. The prediction could be made for any geometry where the information on limit load, and the calibration of fracture parameters was available. This prediction gave a more complete information in that both the maximum load could be determined as well as the stability of the structure after maximum load. The prediction of the loading behavior during ductile fracture depends on the deformation behavior of the structure and the cracking behavior, usually the former is the more important. The ductile fracture methodology uses a principal of load separation proposed by Ernst in which the loading of a cracked body can be specified by separate but multiplicative functions, one of geometry, that is cracking behavior, and one of deformation. The load versus displacement for the specimen is separated into two functional behaviors, a transfer is made for these functions from the specimen geometry to the structural component geometry and two functions are combined to predict load versus displacement of the structural component. The entire procedure could be completed with a hand calculator. Since the first proposal of this ductile fracture methodology, additional work has been done on the determination of the deformation behavior for the structural component. Donoso, et. al. showed that deformation behavior of any structural component, including test specimens geometries, can be derived from the basic stress-strain behavior of the material. With this the deformation behavior of the component can be determined from that of the specimen using common functional expressions with similar constants, ones that be determined from the stress-strain behavior and transferred to any common geometry with a set calibration factors that pertain to that geometry. This approach was labeled, the &quot;common format&quot; approach. Using this &quot;common format&quot; approach the ductile fracture methodology was revisited to see if the procedure could be simplified using the calibration factors to transfer from one geometry to another, namely from test specimen to structural component. This paper describes the result of that study. What was found was that the 'common format' calibration factors can be used to transfer the load factors based on material stress. However, a difficulty rose with the transfer of strain factors. The relation of the structural displacement to strain behavior is sensitive to the type of displacement being measured, that is placement of the gage, and gage length. In order to complete an easy transfer of specimen deformation characteristics to the structural component, strain calibration factors need to be determined. With the development of these, the procedure in the ductile fracture methodology can be made easier and application of ductile fracture mechanics greatly facilitated.

<P>A NEW MODEL TO CALCULATE THE CRACK EXTENSION:</B> <I>Inhoy Gu</I>, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Chung-Ang University, Seoul 156-756, South Korea
<P>
<P>A fracture analysis method is proposed on the criterion that the resistance to crack extension can be characterized in the critical CTOA, an instantaneous ratio of CTOD increment to stepwise crack extension. The CTOD of finite element analysis is written in a function of crack length and applied stress for the load range up to near the limit load. The normalized CTOD function for the compact specimen is independent of crack length ratio with some conditions, under which the function can be used in the crack-extension analysis. After crack initiation, the CTOD increments due to a load increment and a crack increment are successively calculated to determine another crack extension, with their integrations during the stable crack growth. The calculations are made to fit to the tests of effective crack lengths by appropriate fracture constants. The cleavage fracture mode is characterized in the crack growth without crack opening. The total CTOD for the cleavage fracture of Al 7075-T651 increases a little as the specimen size increases greatly. Thus the cleavage fracture may occur with a rising load in big specimens and with a falling load in small specimens. The critical CTOA for the ductile fracture of Al 2024-T351 decreases with an<B> </B>increasing specimen size. The size-corrected fracture constants are applied to calculate the failure loads on other compact and center-cracked specimens, in good agreement with the available test loads. The fracture-predicting capability of the proposed method seems promising from cleavage to ductile fracture modes regardless of crack extension, probably, except the limit-load fracture. Therefore, the fracture constants may account for specimen property as well as material property, and they are transferred between specimens.

<P>DUCTILE FRACTURE OF HIGH TOUGHNESS STEELS UNDER MULTIAXIAL TENSION: </B>D. M. Goto, J.P. Bandstra, <I>D. A. Koss</I>, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Penn State University, University Park, PA 16802; Concurrent Technologies Corporation, 1450 Scalp Avenue, Johnstown, PA 15904
<P>
<P>The influence of stress state on ductile fracture is examined on the basis of both experiments and computational modeling. Using HY-100 steel as a model material, we examine the failure of notched tensile specimens in terms of the void initiation, growth, and linking process. Particular attention is given to the issue of void linking as a result of either global coalescence, which occurs at high stress triaxilities, or a localized void-sheet process, as is observed at high stress triaxilities. The void-sheet mode of linking is modeled on the basis of microstructural conditions present in the HY-100 steel with the result that the predicted influence of stress state agrees well with experimental observations. The transition to global void coalescence, and a much greater sensitivity of failure stress to stress state, is also addressed. This research was supported by the Office of Naval Research, the Naval Surface Warfare Center, and Concurrent Technologies Corporation.

<P>MIXED-MODE NON-LINEAR FRACTURE ALONG INTERFACES:</B> <I>John L. Bassani,</I> N.J.-J. Fang, Department of Mechanical Engineering and Applied Mechanics, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104
<P>
Recently, problems in interfacial fracture have led to a general interest in planar crack growth under mixed-mode loading. Of particular interest is the relationship between the applied stress intensity/mode-mix and the corresponding quantities near the crack tip. We have developed mixed-mode solutions of the HRR type and of the Hui-Riedel type for stationary and propagating interface cracks. In contrast, asymptotic and small-scale yielding solutions for the crack growth in a time-independent elastic-plastic material predict that the mode mix (tension versus shear) in the vicinity of the crack tip can only take on discrete values rather than varying continuously with the mode mix of the remotely applied elastic fields. In the case of a stationary interface crack or a growing creep crack in either homogeneous materials or along interfaces we have found crack-tip solutions which admit a continuous variation of mode mix within certain limits. Slip line solutions for stationary interface cracks have also been developed. These asymptotic solutions are in good agreement with small-scale-yielding finite element calculations that include the transient growth period.

RECENT ADVANCES IN THE APPLICATION OF THE GURSON MODEL TO THE EVALUATION OF DUCTILE FRACTURE TOUGHNESS:</B> <I>Winfried Schmitt</I>, D. -Z. Sun, J. G. Blauel, Fraunhofer Institut Werkstoffmechanik, Fraunhofer IWM W&ouml;hlerstra&szlig;e 11, D-79108 Freiburg, Germany
<P>
For many metallic materials the Gurson model modified by Needleman and Tvergaard describes the ductile rupture process characterized by nucleation, growth and coalescence of voids. Since these local processes are similar in smooth specimens and in cracked specimens, a material dependent critical volume fraction of voids, <I>fc</I>, may be determined from numerical analyses of tensile tests. However, because of the strong gradient in the stress-strain field at the crack tip an additional length parameter, <I>lc</I>, is required to model the coalescence process in cracked specimens. Since the effects of triaxiality are adequately taken into account in the model, <I>fc</I> and <I>lc</I> may be transferred to specimens with different shapes and sizes. Hence, it is possible to evaluate ductile fracture resistance curves for different geometries and loading conditions with the same set of micromechanical parameters. The authors have applied this local approach to ductile fracture for a series of ferritic and austenitic steels including weld materials even after neutron embrittlement. Besides notched and smooth tensile specimens of standard sizes also miniature specimens with diameter down to 2 mm have been used for the determination of <I>fc</I>. Dynamic effects have been taken into account based on dynamic tensile tests and visco-plastic formulation to model the strain-rate sensitivity of the stress-strain curves. The characteristic length is usually determined for small SENB-specimens. As examples, instrumented impact tests with SENB and Charpy specimens have been simulated using three-dimensional models.

<P>SUPERIMPOSED EFFECTS OF DSA AND NEUTRON-IRRADIATION ON MECHANICAL AND FRACTURE BEHAVIOR OF FERRITIC STEELS IN THE UPPER SHELF REGION:</B> <I>Rao K. Mahidhara1</I> and K. Linga Murty2, 1Tessera Inc., 3099 Orchard Drive, San Jose, CA 95134; 2North Carolina State University, P. O. Box 7909, Raleigh, NC 27695
<P>
It is now well established that radiation embrittlement of ferritic steels such as used for pressure boundary applications is sensitive not only to the alloying elements (Cu, Ni, P etc.) and interstitial impurities (IIAs) such as C and N, but also radiation flux and irradiation temperature. The increased strength and decreased ductility in the DSA region leads to reduced energy to fracture and this region usually lies in the upper shelf regime. This is also clearly evident in the elastic-plastic fracture toughness (<I>JIC</I>). While dips in the fracture energy are noted in steels, pure (Armco) showed peaks in this region apparently due to the increased rates of work-hardening. Exposure to neutron irradiation suppressed the effects of DSA leading to <I>apparent</I> increased energy values at temperatures where dips are noted in the unirradiated materials. Such tests on pure iron are in progress and results to-date will be reported here. Radiation effects on Hall-Petch relation are investigated in pure iron, and radiation exposure resulted in increased friction hardening and decreased source hardening which lead to interesting effects of thermal neutrons on radiation hardening of these materials.

<P>USE OF X-RAY TOMOGRAPHIC MICROSCOPY TO STUDY DUCTILE FRACTURE:</B> <I>Wayne E. King</I>, G.H. Campbell, D.L. Haupt, J.H. Kinney, R.A. Riddle, W.L. Wien, Chemistry and Materials Science Directorate, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, P.O. Box 808, Livermore, CA 94551-9900
<P>
<P>X-Ray tomographic microscopy (XTM) is a promising technique to investigate ductile fracture because voids formed under conditions of high triaxiality can be directly observed nondestructively. In this experiment, ultra high vacuum diffusion bonding has been used to make model specimens in the Al/sapphire system. Samples were prepared in the 4-point bend geometry with notch. XTM images acquired after several loadings of the sample revealed the morphology of the growing voids. The primary finds are that (i) damage ahead of the notch initiates by interface debonding at a location coinciding with maxima in triaxiality and tensile traction at the interface, (ii) debonding occurs at the most early stages in the observation of plasticity, (iii) the debond expands for a limited distance, likely arresting due to crack tip blunting, (iv) this lenticular debond then becomes spherical with further strain, and (v) intergrowth of the spherical voids leads to the typical ductile rupture fracture surfaces observed in the system. This work performed under the auspices of U. S. Department of Energy and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under contract No. W-7405-Eng-48.

<P>MICROPLASTICITY AND DUCTILE FRACTURE IN METALS: </B><I>Wally O. Soboyejo</I>, B. Rabeeh, J. Dipasquale, R. Pryor, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, The Ohio State University, 2041 College Road, Columbus OH 43210-1179
<P>
<P>Recent evidence of microplasticity in ductile metals is presented for a range of ductile metals with cubic and hexagonal closed packed structures deformed to failure under monotonic loading. Microplasticity is shown to occur at very low stress levels (~5 - 10%) of the bulk stress. Microscopic of microplasticity evidence is shown to include: slip band localization via shear localization; grain boundary sliding; subgrain formation; deformation-induced precipitation; and localized flow mechanisms. Ductile fracture is shown to initiate by coalescence of voids that are nucleated around stress-induced precipitates. Deformation in the so-called elastic regime is shown to be associated with the spread of localized plasticity phenomena across the gauge. Linear plasticity concepts are used to explain the initial deformation characteristics. The implications of microplasticity are also assessed for fatigue damage initiation and ductile fracture initiation.

DUCTILE FRACTURE IN STEELS AND ALUMINIUM ALLOYS: </B> <I>John F. Knott</I>, School of Metallugy and Materials, The University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, Birmingham B15 2TT, UK<P>
Ductile fracture mechanisms in these alloys, of such importance to modern civilization, are set in the context of the main applications for which they are used. Thin-sheet applications encompass two main aspects: prevention of localized shear fracture in sheet-forming, promotion of reproducible shear fractures in the &quot;ripping&quot; of &quot;ring-pulls&quot; on beverage cans or in the stamping-out of milk-bottle tops from oil. Both aspects relate to the generation of through-thickness shear fractures. In thick-section applications, it is necessary to address local fracture mechanisms in the combination of steep strain-gradient and high hydrostatic tension ahead of a notch or pre-crack. The prime micro-mechanisms are microvoid coalescence and &quot;fast (in-plane) shear&quot; linkage resulting from a (plane-strain) localization of flow. Behaviour in steels and high-strength aluminum alloys is contrasted and recent findings on &quot;mixed-mode&quot; shear fracture criteria are discussed. Attention is drawn to a number of applications for which &quot;plane-stress&quot; and &quot;plain-strain&quot; methodologies must be combined.

MODELLING LARGE DEFORMATION AND FAILURE IN MANUFACTURING PROCESSES USING INTERNAL STATE VARIABLES:</B> <I>Doug Bammann</I>, Mechanics and Simulation of Manufacturing Processes Department, Mail Stop 9405, Sandia National Laboratories, Livermore, CA 94551<P>
A state variable model for describing the fine-deformation behavior of metals is described. A multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient into elastic, volumetric plastic (damage), and deviatoric plastic parts is considered. With respect to the natural or stress-free configuration defined by this decomposition, the thermodynamics of the state variable theory is investigated. This model incorporates strain rate and temperature sensitivity, as well as damage, through a yield surface approach in which the state variables follow a hardening minus-recovery format. The microstructural underpinnings of the model are presented along with a detailed description of the effects which each model parameter has on the predicted response. Issues associated with the implementation of this model into finite element codes are also discussed. A range of problems involving damage at various loading rates are presented including hydroforming, prediction of forming limit diagrams from limiting dome height studies and cracking during welding processes. In each case, experiments are well described by predictions based on this model.

THE EFFECT OF HYDROSTATIC PRESSURE ON THE ROOM TEMPERATURE FORMABILITY OF METAL SHEETS:</B> <I>Henry Piehler</I>, Consortium for the Advancement of Deformation Processing Research, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Wean Hall 2323, Pittsburgh, PA 15213<P>
The effect of pressure on the room temperature formability of 6111 T4 aluminum and &szlig; 21 S titanium sheets was evaluated in stretching, drawing, as well as plane strain. The sheet formability tests were performed using the patented Carnegie Mellon hot triaxial deformation system in conjunction with a specially developed 2 in diameter hemispherical punch and forming fixture. The strain state was varied by using different sample widths and lubrication conditions. Tests were conducted at ambient pressure and constant pressures of up to 70 MPa (10 ksi). Increasing all pressures used in forming increased the formability of the al sheets along all forming paths. The largest pressure-formability increase in the Al sheets occurred in plane strain. Biaxial stretching tests on the &szlig; 21 S sheets revealed that the formability actually <I>decreased</I> under a pressure of 10 ksi compared to the formability at ambient pressure. This pressure-induced formability decrease was accompanied by a change in fracture path and its mechanism is currently being investigated.

MICROSTRUCTURAL EFFECTS ON CAVITATION AND FRACTURE IN SUPERPLASTIC METALS: </B> <I>Amit K. Ghosh</I>, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109<P>
Cavitation leads to flow localization and fracture during superplastic forming process. In this paper, several approaches on the micromechanical aspects of cavitation are critically examined. With plasticity effects present, constrained diffusional and plasticity-induced growth of cavities have been proposed in the dislocation creep regime. In the superplastic regime, however, cavitation behavior is considerably complicated by the predominance of grain boundary sliding and grain rotation effects. Consequently the amount of grain boundary sliding strain has a major effect on the degree of cavitation through cavity initiation, growth and coalescence. Dynamics of cavitation and its effect on strain localization leading to fracture has been examined. Also detailed quantitative aspects of cavity initiation on cavity growth have been carefully documented to separate the phenomenon of continuous nucleation of new voids from the cavity growth process. It appears that dynamic grain growth which influences grain boundary sliding in a major way, also influences cavitation. Thus flow localization and fracture are critically affected by microstructural evolution effects such as dynamic recrystallization and dynamic grain growth. Illustrative examples will be given from various metallic system.

MECHANISMS OF DUCTILE FRACTURE IN CRACK-TIP FRACTURE PROCESS ZONES:</B> <I>Peter F. Thomason</I>*, Department of Metallurgy and Materials Science, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 3QZ; *on leave from University of Salford<P>
The strength and toughness of engineering alloys, under conditions where general yielding and subcritical crack growth precede catastrophic fracture, are critically depend on nucleation, growth and coalescence of microvoids in fracture process zones that are generally subject to high mean-normal stresses. It is shown that, at these high mean-normal stress levels, microvoid nucleation and coalescence can become the controlling process of ductile fracture in crack-tip plastic zones, with negligible dilatational void-growth prior to microvoid coalescence on the fracture surface. This effect is direct result of high mean-normal stresses promoting the microvoid coalescence process when the microvoids are still relatively small and widely spaced; thus virtually all dilational void-growth is confined to the final void-coalescence fracture surface, and the result of plastic limit-load failure (or internal microscopic necking) between adjacent microvoid nuclei.

IMPROVED PROPERTIES OF HSLA AND DUAL-PHASE STEELS:</B> <I>Gareth Thomas</I>, Department of Materials Science and Mineral Engineering, University of California, Berkeley, CA 97420-1760 and National Center for Electron Microscopy, Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, Berkeley, CA 94720<P>
The utilization of controlled rolling and quenching from the finish roll allows the design of composite microstructures, whereby the advantages of the second phase are optimized while the less desirable features of this phase are simultaneously mitigated by the presence of the other constituent phase. The size, morphology, distribution, shape and volume fracture of the second phase critically control the mechanical properties, especially fracture and fatigue of the dual phase systems. As a consequence, these structures offer a degree of metallurgical flexibility that is absent in single phase structures or in many precipitation strengthened systems, for attaining optimum sets of mechanical properties. Examples are presented here of martensite/austenite (~2 - 5%) mixtures designed for optimum combinations of high strength, toughness, and wear properties in medium carbon steels, e.g., for mining and agricultural applications; low carbon martensite/ferrite (~80%) structures for high strength, cold formability, improved low temperature ductility, and attractive improved corrosion resistance in concrete. In all cases these steels can be produced on line in a hot mill by controlled rolling and direct quenching.

EXPERIMENTAL AND THEORETICAL ANALYSIS OF THE CAVITATION AND FAILURE BEHAVIOR OF A SUPERPLASTICALLY DEFORMED NEAR-GAMMA TITANIUM ALUMINIDE ALLOY: </B> Carl M. Lombard, Perikles D. Nicolaou, <I>Amit K. Ghosh</I>, S. Lee Semiatin, US Air Force Wright Laboratory, WL/MLLM, Room 101, Building 665, Wright Patterson Air Force Base, OH 45433; UES, Inc., 4401 Dayton-Xenia Road, Dayton, OH 45432; Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109<P>

The uniaxial hot tension behavior of a near-gamma titanium aluminide alloy sheet (Ti-45.5Al-2Cr-2Nb) was determined in the as-rolled condition (initial grain size ~3 to 5 &#181;m) and a rolled-and-heat treated (1177&#176;C/4 hours) condition (initial grain size ~10 to 12 &#181;m). Microstructure evolution, cavitation rates, and failure modes were established via constant strain rate tests at 10-4 to 10-2 sec-1 and test temperatures between 900 and 1200&#176;C. For both initial microstructural conditions, the failure mode was established as predominantly cavitation/fracture controlled. Cavity growth rates was greatest at lower temperatures and in the heat treated specimens; the higher cavitation rates in the heat treated specimens led to elongations only approximately one-half those of the as-rolled material. Experimental results were then compared with a 'force equilibrium approach' theoretical analysis of the isothermal hot tension test under cavitating conditions. Model results delineated the competition between failure controlled by localized necking versus fracture, the latter being defined by a critical volume fraction of cavities. The validity of the modeling approach was confirmed through the analysis of the experimental results and data from the literature.

THE EFFECT OF HYDROSTATIC AND SHEAR STRESSES ON THE HOT WORKING BEHAVIOR OF BULK METALS:</B> <I>Henry Piehler</I>, Consortium for the Advancement of Deformation Processing Research, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Wean Hall 2323, Pittsburgh, PA 15213<P>
The effect of pressure on the hot workability of a Ti-49.5Al-2.5Nb-1.1Mn (a/o) titanium aluminide was evaluated using both isothermal compression and isothermal hydrostatic upsetting tests. Tests were conducted at 1050&#176;C to strains of the order of one with and without pressure of 260 MPa to evaluate the effect of pressure on flow stress response, fracture retardation, and hot worked microstructure. The samples deformed without pressure exhibited noticeable cracks on the bulged free surface as well as internal deformation-induced voids; the superimposition of pressure suppressed both these types of deformation damage. Pressure was observed to have a neglible effect on the flow stress response, which could be adequately described by the von Mises criterion in all cases. Similarly, pressure had a negligible effect on dynamic recrystallization and microstructure under the conditions investigated. Preliminary results on pore closure in Osprey processed IN 718 subsequently deformed by isothermal hydrostatic upsetting are also presented.

THE EFFECT OF MATERIALS PROCESSING ON FRACTURE OF METALS:</B> <I>Clyde L. Briant</I>, Division of Engineering, Brown University, Providence, RI 02912<P>
Thermomechanical processing of metals is often used to improve the fracture properties of materials. When materials are processed at room temperature, one can often achieve good control over resulting properties because one can avoid dynamic recovery and recrystallization. However, when processing is carried out at elevated temperature, dynamic changes can occur and make control difficult. In this paper we report on work in which refractory metals were processed at elevated temperatures try to achieve optimum fracture strength as measured in four point bending. The results will show that there is an optimum processing range to achieve fracture resistance. If the material is processed at too low a temperature internal cracks that occurred during processing will cause failures. If the processing temperature is too high, recrystallization occurs and the material will fail by low energy brittle fracture.

THE INFLUENCE OF INCLUSIONS ON THE FRACTURE TOUGHNESS OF AerMet 100:</B> <I>J.W. Morris, Jr.</I>, J. Chan and K. Sato, Department of Materials Science and Mineral Engineering, University of California, Berkeley, CA 97420-1760 and, Center for Advanced Materials, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA 94720<P>
AerMet 100 is an ultra-high strength alloy recently that was recently commercialized by Carpenter Technology. The alloy is a secondary hardening, Fe-Ni-Co-Cr-Mo alloy that is age-hardenable to yield strength above 250 ksi, and fractures in a ductile mode at ambient temperature even after hardening to peak strength. The alloy is currently under investigation for potential use in aircraft landing gear. As expected from its ductile fracture mode, the fracture toughness of AirMet 100 is strongly dependent on the density of inclusions with sizes greater than about 2 &#181;m. As the inclusion spacing increases from ~0.2 to ~0.8 mm, the fracture toughness rises by roughly 70%, from ~110 ksiin. Metallurgical analysis shows that the large inclusions in these alloys are primarily rare earth (La, Ce, Nd) oxysulfides. The rare earth elements are present in the low concentration in the alloy, and, presumably, represent intentional additions to getter metalloid impurities such as sulfur. Research has shown that substantial improvements in toughness can be obtained by filtration before solidification. The toughness of AerMet 100 can be further improved by modifying, the alloy heat treatment the alloy heat treatment to alter the distribution of hardening precipitates. A brief pre-age at 510&#176;C prior to the standard aging at 485&#176;C significantly increases the fracture toughness, particularly in the case of the low-toughness sample.

STEREO-SECTION FRACTOGRAPHIC STUDY OF FRACTURE BEHAVIOR OF A Ti6Al4V ALLOY:</B> <I>Xian J. Zhang</I> and R.L. Tregoning, Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, MD 20742; Fracture and Fatigue Branch, Naval Surface Warfare Center, 3A Leggett Circle, Annapolis, MD 21402<P>
The stereo-section fractography (SSF) technique has been employed to study the relationship of surface microfractographic features and internal microstructures. In this way, a direct correspondence is established between various fracture modes and microstructural details beneath the fracture surface of fracture toughness and fatigue specimens of an () Ti6Al4V alloy. The measurements show a one to one relation between surface and internal features. It was found that ductile holes formed along grain boundaries and also, cleavage facets cut through grains. It was evident that the microscopic texture formed in the solidification process affects the fracture mechanisms and hence, the fracture toughness of the alloy. Thus, the SSF technique is demonstrated as a very useful tool for the study of fracture behavior of materials.

MODELING OF DUCTILE FRACTURE:</B> <I>Alan Needleman</I>, Division of Engineering, Brown University, Providence, RI 02912
<P>
Analyses of fracture are discussed where the initial-boundary value problem formulation allows for the possibility of a complete loss of stress carrying capacity, with the associated creation of new free surface. Hence, fracture arises as a natural outcome of the deformation process without any ad hoc failure criterion being employed. The failure mechanisms modeled are plastic void growth and coalescence, and cleavage cracking (so that the ductile-brittle transition can be analyzed). The role of porosity induced weakening in precipitating shear band failures will be illustrated. However, the main emphasis will be on recent predictions of crack growth, including ductile-brittle transitions and three dimensional effects such as shear-lips.

NON-LOCAL EFFECTS IN DUCTILE FRACTURE PREDICTIONS:</B> <I>Viggo Tvergaard</I>, Department of Solid Mechanics, Technical University of Denmark, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark
<P>
Continuum studies of ductile fracture have been based on local constitutive relations, which do not represent a material length scale. The resulting numerical predictions show inherent mesh sensitivity, since the softening material behaviour near final failure will tend to give localized damage in regions as narrow as possible within the mesh resolution. Nonlocal constitutive relations, with the delocalization related to the damage mechanism, have been proposed for ductile fracture where damage involves the nucleation and growth of voids to coalescence. The effect of using this nonlocal material model will be illustrated by a number of analyses, including studies of shear band failure, ductile matrix failure in metal matrix composites, and failure involving two size - scales of voids. Based on recent comparisons with cell - model predictions of localization in a void - sheet the relevant material length scale for a ductile fracture model are discussed.

NUMERICAL SIMULATION OF DUCTILE RUPTURE: ANALYSIS OF EXPERIMENTAL SCATTER AND SIZE EFFECT: </B> <I>Jacques Besson,</I> A. Pineau, Ecole des Mines de Paris, Centre des Mat&eacute;riaux, CNRS URA 866, 91003, BP 87 Evry Cedex, France

Ductile rupture behavior is usually characterized with specimens of various types including smooth and notched bars, compact tension specimens, bending bars. In addition, similar specimens geometries of different sizes are also used. Using different specimen geometries allows to investigate the effect of mechanical parameters such as stress triaxility and amount of plastic deformation on ductile rupture. Changing specimen sizes allows to evaluate experimental dispersion and size effects. Considering these effects is of primary importance for the transferability of laboratory tests carried out on relatively small samples to assess the resistance of relatively large industrial components. Both dispersion and size effect are caused by material heterogeneities which have to be accounted for by modeling. This work presents both experimental data and numerical simulation relative to dispersion and size effects on two very different materials. The first one is a plane carbon steel containing MnS inclusions which easily debond from the matrix so that rupture is essentially controlled by void growth. The second material is a cast ferrite - austenite duplex stainless stainless steel. Microcracks are continuously nucleated in the embrittled ferrite so that final rupture is essentially controlled by void nucleation. Both materials were tested using axisymmetric smooth and notched bars and Charpy specimens of different sizes. In order to obtain microstructural data, relevant to modeling, both materials were carefully examined. In the first case, initial local void densities (MnS inclusion content) were measured using image analysis. In the second case, local crack nucleation rates were determined by carrying out interrupted tensile tests and determining crack locations. These examinations are needed to get physically based data to be used in the modeling thus reducing the number of &quot;fitting parameters&quot;. Modeling of rupture, dispersion and size effects can be done using two different approaches both based on finite element analysis. The first one (uncoupled) consists in carrying out simulations of the mechanical response of structures assuming that the material is undamaged. Subsequently, a local rupture criterion is applied to the structure to determine that the material remains unchanged. Subsequently, a local rupture criterion is applied to the structure to determine its failure probability. It is therefore assumed that damage is small enough not to affect the stress strain distribution in the part. In addition the material is supposed to break according to the weakest link theory. The second approach (coupled) is based on continuum damage mechanics using models for ductile metals such as those proposed by Gurson and Rousselier. In this case, the effect of damage evolution on stress distribution in the parts can be fully accounted for. In addition the effect of defect spatial distribution can also be investigated. No specific assumption has to be made on the onset of rupture. Finite element calculations were carried out for both materials using the Gurson-Tvergaard/Rousslier constitutive equations. Initial void volume fractions (first material) or microcrack nucleation rates (second material) were randomly distributed in the structures. Dispersion can be modeled by carrying a Monte Carlo type simulation using the same mesh and different random drawings. Size effect is modeled by keeping the element size constant, thus increasing the number of elements for larger structures. The uncoupled approach was also used for the first approach. Results show that size effect and dispersion can be successfully modeled using both approaches. The fully coupled approach, although more time consuming, is thought to be the most promising since: (1) it is based on fewer assumptions, (2) it can be applied to any geometry (e.g. cracked components); in particular it gives much better results on smooth tensile specimens, (3) it can model the interaction between neighboring heterogeneities clusters.

Evidence is reviewed of particle size aspects of hole formation and growth, texture effects and grain size influences, for example, as revealed in stereosection fractographs of titanium and steel alloy ductile failure surfaces, in the latter case, near to the condition of cleavage fracturing. The results are related to model considerations of particle debonding and local region strain rate enhancement and plastic instability properties (see e.g. J.P. Gudas, G.R.

MACROCRACK NUCLEATION IN DUCTILE MATERIALS:</B> <I>Owen Richmond</I>, Aluminum Company of America, Alcoa Technical Center, 100 Technical Drive, Alcoa Center, PA 15069
<P>
In ductile materials, it is typical of many microcracks and pores to nucleate and grow before some of these coalesce to form dominant macrocrack which leads to ultimate failure. This paper is concerned with quantitative identification of the microstructural regions in which this macrocrack nucleation occurs, and the development of constitutive relations for these regions. These microstructure-based constitutive relations can then be used in macromechanical analyses to evaluate potential improvement in macroscopic behavior due to alterations in microstructure.

<P>
Microvoid coalescence or MVC fracture depends strongly on microstructure. This applies to each of the constituent processes of MVC, namely nucleation, growth and coalescence of voids, and is true for both transgranular and intergranular MVC. Experimental as well as analytical evidence on this point reveals both needs for further experiments, and gaps in analytical understanding. Methods to vary the behavior of MVC processes, such as variations in temperature, or introduction of hydrogen, convey further information (provided MVC fracture is maintained) and have proven valuable in understanding these processes; of particular value are the notch bend tests, in which stress state can readily be varied to identify control of stress, strain, or a combination of the two.

A MODEL FOR CRACK INITIATION AND CRACK GROWTH IN DUCTILE MATERIALS:</B> Xi Zhang and <I>Yiu-Wing Mai</I>, University of Sidney, Centre for Advanced Materials Technology, Department of Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering, Sydney, New South Wales 2006, Australia
<P>
A refined mathematical model is presented in this paper to account for the effects of void nucleation, growth and coalescence on fracture initiation and subsequent quasi-static, slow and little crack growth in ductile materials under plane strain and mode I condition. A chain of larger voids uniformly-distributed ahead of the crack tip is used to model the discontinuous fracture process and discontinuous nucleation of small voids at second-phase particles is the main cause for crack initiation in high strength and ductility steels. A cumulative damage criterion, which is the ratio of uncracked length between the crack tip and the first large void to characterize size, is employed. Effects of crack-tip constraint and material parameters on ductile fracture are discussed in terms of the gradient of the variation of crack-tip constraint within the damage zone. Estimation of upper-bound fracture toughness is established and numerical results show that, with the exception of crack growth there is no obvious constraint effect on ductile crack initiation.

DUCTILE CAVITY GROWTH IN NORMALLY BRITTLE MATERIALS:</B> <I>Donald R. Curran</I>, R.E. Tokheim, and T. Cooper, SRI International, 333 Ravenswood Avenue, Menlo Park, CA 94025
<P>
The term &quot;ductile fracture&quot; can be interpreted in a number of ways, but to a materials scientist who focuses on microscopic mechanisms the meaning is clear: &quot;ductile fracture&quot; means that failure occurs by the nucleation, growth, and coalescence of approximately ellipsoidal microscopic voids in plastically deforming material. To be sure, extremely ductile materials stretched under plane or uniaxial stress conditions may fail in the absence of voids by simple plastic necking. Nonetheless, in most practical engineering applications of failure in ductile materials, microscopic &quot;ductile fracture&quot; play a central role in the failure process. Frank McClintock was one of the pioneers in this area (as well as many others), and his 1968 paper [J. Appl. Mech., <U>35</U>, p.363], along with papers by C.A. Berg [Proc. Fourth U.S. National Congress Appl. Mech. <U>2</U> (1962) 885], J.R. Rice and D.M. Tracy [J. Mech. &amp; Phys. Solids, <U>17</U> (1969) 202], A.L. Gurson [Trans. ASME, J. Eng. Mater. &amp; Technol. (1977) 2], and M.Y. He and J.W. Hutchinson [J. Appl. Mech. <U>48</U> (1981) 830], stimulated much further work. The above papers discussed the conditions for cavity growth in a viscous or plastically deforming material under tension and shear. In the present paper, we take a similar approach, but consider cases in which the cavity growth is driven not only by the externally applied stresses, but also by internal cavity pressure. Such conditions arise when a material is exposed to penetrating radiation from lasers or x-ray sources of sufficient fluence to cause local heterogeneities to vaporize while leaving the matrix material relatively cool. Under such loading conditions, microscopic cavity pressures of several tens of GPa may be produced, sufficient to cause the surrounding matrix material to flow plastically, even when the matrix material is a normally brittle material like a ceramic. Under some boundary conditions, the expanding cavities may drive the matrix material into tension, producing brittle tensile fractures between cavities. We present a computer model of the above processes, and illustrate the model with several example calculations.

HYDROGEN EFFECTS ON THE DUCTILE FRACTURE ON IRON-BASED SUPERALLOYS:</B> <I>Neville R. Moody</I>*, I. Baskes*, J.E. Angelo,* and T. Tsuji**; *Sandia National Laboratories, P.O. Box 969, Mail Stop 9403, Livermore, CA 94551; **Shizuoka University, Hamamatsu, Japan
<P>
Austenitic superalloys can exhibit dramatic reductions in ductility and crack growth resistance when hydrogen triggers a change in failure mode. All failures begin by void growth at fractured matrix carbides. However, void growth is prematurely terminated terminated in hydrogen by second generation void formation at slip band intersections and separation of interconnecting slip band segments. As a first approximation to understanding hydrogen effects on the fracture process, we have combined the Embedded Atom Method with Monte Carlo simulations to model the segregation of hydrogen to dislocation in slip bands and slip band intersections. We will present these results and draw a direct correlation between the segregation of hydrogen to slip band intersections, void formation, and crack growth susceptibility.

NEAR-TIP FRACTURE PROCESSES IN DUCTILE MATERIALS:</B> <I>Kwai S. Chan</I>, Southwest Research Institute, San Antonio, TX 78238
<P>
Ductile fracture is generally considered to occur via void nucleation, growth, and coalescence mechanisms that result in a dimpled fracture appearance. For many materials, void initiation and growth take place at hard particles or inclusions. However, ductile fracture involving void formation has been observed in materials that contain neither hard particles nor inclusions. In this paper, the near-tip fracture processes in several structural alloys, including Al-, Ti-, and Nb-base alloys, that exhibit ductile fracture in a variety of microstructures with and without hard particles are summarized. Possible mecha nisms for the formation of dimpled fracture in these materials are identified. These fracture mechanisms are correlated with the microstructures and the fracture resistance curve to provide a basic understanding of the role of microstructure in the crack-tip fracture process, the transition from ductile to brittle fracture, and the source of fracture resistance.

PREDICTION OF DUCTILE BEHAVIOUR IN WELDED STRUCTURES (DUCTILE TO BRITTLE TRANSITION BEHAVIOUR, SHEAR LIP, NOTCH ACQUITY, AND SPECIMEN SIZE):</B> <I>James R. Matthews</I>, Dockyard Laboratory, Department of National Defence, Defence Research Establishment, Atlantic, Dartmouth, Nova Scotia B2Y 3Z7, Canada
<P>
Design of ships against fracture requires, at the simplest level, that the minimum service temperature of the ship coincide with the upper shelf of the structural ductile to brittle transition curve for the steel and weldments. Material specifications in shipping standards often have no requirement for notch toughness and when they do specify toughness the specimen is of insufficient size and notch acquity to reflect the structural transition behaviour and to guarantee that the structure will be ductile at the lowest service temperatures. Consequently minimum standards should be adopted and specimen size and notch acquity requirements should be sufficient to predict ductile behaviour. In this paper, it will be shown that the transition behaviour for Charpy six specimens can be 50 to 100&#176;C below that for larger DT specimens. It will he shown that replacing the standard notch with an EDM notch in Charpy speci mens moves the transition curve towards the DT curve but as little as 20 degrees for some materials. This leaves the DT specimen as the simplest existing specimen whose transition behaviour would approximate that of a structure. Data will be presented for 350WT and A517 steels. Refinement of the DT specimen to include an EDM notch as opposed to a machined and pressed notch may marginally reduce cost of testing. Relying on a shear lip width transition curve as opposed to an energy based transition curve can reduce the cost considerably. Data will be presented to show that shear lip width is related to the fracture energy of specimens over a wide range of temperatures, compositions and weldment locations. Finally data will also be presented to show that the relationship between shear lip and energy is independent of specimen thickness between l6 mm and 25 mm thickness.

A COMPUTER SIMULATION OF THE EFFECTS OF LOADING PATH ON THE MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF POROUS COPPER: </B>Anthony Kee, Peter Matic, Jennifer Morris and <I>Andrew Geltmacher</I>, Mechanics of Materials Branch, Code 6382, Naval Research Laboratory, 4555 Overlook Drive SW, Washington D.C. 20375
<P>
The present research examines the local stress and strain rates generated during loading in porous copper specimens produced by the GASAR gas-eutectic process, developed by Shapovalov and Timshenko. Two-dimensional explicit finite element simulations are performed on a representative microstructure taken from a 21.5 percent pore volume fraction bulk sample which contains high aspect ratio pores. The fraction bulk sample which contains high aspect ratio pores. The models investigate the role of multiple pore interactions and their effect on the mechanical properties of the porous materials. Previous research has shown the dependence of bulk strength and ductility on factors such as pore density, spacing, constraint and axial offset for uniaxial tensile loading. The present study extends the effort by applying biaxial and shear boundary conditions to the specimen, which simulates the effects of strain path on the deformation and fracture behavior of the porous materials. From these finite element models, the shape of the yield surface has been determined for the porous materials.

HIGH SPEED TEMPERATURE AND OPTICAL MEASUREMENTS OF DUCTILE FAILURE EVENTS IN METALS:</B> <I>Ares J. Rosakis</I>, G. Ravichandran, Raman P. Singh, Graduate Aeronautical Laboratories, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA 91125
<P>
An experimental investigation has been conducted to study dynamic crack initiation in precracked highly ductile steel specimens. The specimens are fabricated out of 4340 mild steel and 304 stainless steel and subjected to dynamic three point bend loading by impacting them in a drop weight tower at various loading rates. This dynamic impact of the pre-cracked steel specimens results in deformation followed by fracture initiation at different loading rates. During the dynamic deformation and failure process the time history of the transient temperature and deformation fields around the crack tip are recorded experimentally. The transient temperatures are recorded using high speed infrared detectors, while the deformation fields are obtained using the optical method of Coherent Gradient Sensing (CGS) in conjunction with high speed photography. The experimental information is used to extract fracture parameters of interest, such as the time history of the dynamic J-integral (<I>Jd(t)</I>) and its critical value at initiation (<I>JdInitiation</I>) This is the first time that a noncontact temperature measurement is used to evaluate <I>Jd(t)</I>. The applicability and accuracy of this technique is validated through comparison with the simultaneously performed CGS optical measurements. Finally, the data provided by the two techniques is used to identify various ductile failure mechanisms and quantify the fracture initiation toughness in terms of <I>JdInitiation</I> at different loading rates.

ANALYSIS OF FAILURE MODES IN IMPULSIVELY LOADED PRE-NOTCHED STEEL PLATES: </B><I>Ramesh C. Batra</I>, N.V. Nechitailo, Department of Engineering Science and Mechanics, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA 24061-0219
<P>
We analyze transient plane-strain thermomechanical deformations of a pre-notched 4340 steel plate impacted by a 4340 steel projectile in the direction of two parallel notches, and study the influence of the impact speed and notch tip radius on the localization of the deformation. The plate configuration is identical to that in Kalthoff's experiments (1987, 1988). There is no failure or fracture criterion included in our work. However, the computed evolution of stress and plastic strain fields strongly suggest that with an increase of impact speed and decrease in notch tip radius, there is a failure mode transition from a tensile crack opening at approximately 70&#176; to the notch ligament to an adiabatic shear band propagating at (-5&#176;) - (-15&#176;) to the notch ligament. This is in qualitative agreement with Kalthoff's findings.

EFFECT OF STRAIN RATE ON THE FRACTURE TOUGHNESS REFERENCE TEMPERATURE To FOR FERRITIC STEELS:</B> <I>Kim Wallin</I>, Materials and Structural Integrity Department, VTT Manufacturing Technology, P.O. Box 1704, FIN-02044 VTT, Finland
<P>
The new master curve concept for describing materials fracture toughness in the transition region, with the help of a reference temperature <I>To</I>, is a candidate for structural integrity assessment codificaton. Normally, <I>To</I> is determined for (quasi) static strain rates, while often dynamic values are required. The master curve concept can of course be applied also to dynamic tests, but this would require a double amount of testing. Therefore, if the effect of strain rate on To can be quantified with sufficient accuracy, the applicability of the master curve concept for structural integrity assessment codification would be strongly enhanced. For this purpose, fracture toughness data found in the literature was analyzed with the master curve concept, and, using the Zeller-Hollomon strain rate parameter, a simple semiemperical expression for the strain rate dependence of <I>To</I> was developed. The error of the expression is only of the order &#177;20% covering yield strength levels from 200 to 1400 MPa.

DYNAMIC PLASTICITY OF DUCTILE MATERIALS AT THE MESOSCOPICAL SCALE LEVEL:</B><I> Yuri I. Mescheryakov</I>, Institute of the Mechanical Engineering Problems, Russian Academy of Sciences, Saint-Petersburg, V. O. Bolshoi 61, 199178, Russia
<P>
Dynamic tests of ductile materials (copper, aluminum, ductile steels) were carried out under uniaxial strain conditions to determine the criterion of transition between translational (shear banding) and rotational modes of deformation. All the basic processes defining the mode of plastic deformation were found to occur at the mesoscopical scale level (0.1 - 10 &#181;m) and depend on the particle velocity distribution at that level. The later has been recorded with a velocity interferometer modified for measuring both average mesoparticle velocity and particle velocity dispersion simultaneously. The kind of kinematical mechanism (translational or rotational) is determined by difference between longitudinal and transverse components of the mesoparticle velocity dispersion. This conclusion results from theoretical analysis of rotational motion of medium by using the mesomechanics approach.

FLOW AND FAILURE OF HIGH DENSITY MATERIALS IN BALLISTIC IMPACTS:</B> <I>Lee S. Magness1</I>, Jr., Deepak Kapoor2 and Moon Chung2, 1U. S. Army Research Laboratory, Aberdeen, MD 21005; 2U. S. Army Armament Research, Development and Engineering, Picatinny Arsenal, Dover, NJ 07806
<P>
High-density alloys and composites are employed as the penetrator core materials in modern armor-piercing projectiles. During ballistic impact with an armored target, the length of the penetrator core is eroded or back-extruded as a cavity is opened in the armor. The core material is deformed to very large strains at strain-rates exceeding 104 per second. The hydrostatic component of the stresses on the penetrator can exceed 5 GPa (1 Msi), suppressing void nucleation and growth as a fracture mechanism. However, plastic localization and failures (shear bands) are promoted by the high rate, adiabatic deformation. The ballistic performances of a number of high-density alloys and composites are compared. Deformation and failure behaviors are categorized via optical metallographic examinations of penetrators recovered from ballistic impacts.

ANALYTICAL MODELING OF THE SHEAR MODE AND OPENING MODE OF DUCTILE FRACTURE:</B> <I>G. Rousselier</I> and G. Barbier, Electricit&eacute; de France, Research Division, Les Renardi&egrave;res, F-77250 Moret-sur-Loing, France
<P>
Strain localization in the vicinity of a surface is a precursor to ductile fracture of materials. It can be analyzed by considering the stability of a linear perturbation. For a broad class of materials: plastic, rate-dependent, with void-growth damage and loading conditions: three-dimensional, thermomechanical and dynamic, a closed-form solution is obtained for the stability condition. From this condition, a mode of ductile fracture can be predicted: shear or opening. In a plastically incompressible material, the shear mode of fracture only is obtained; it results from a competition between strain hardening and thermal softening. In a void-growth damaging material, the opening mode is promoted by stress triaxiality. The analytical results are in agreement with experimental observations and numerical results from the literature.

LOADING RATE INFLUENCE OF FRACTURE TOUGHNESS IN INSTRUMENTED PRECRACKED CHARPY-TYPE TESTING:</B> <I>Thomas Varga</I> and Friedrich Loibnegger, Technische Versuchs- und Forschungsanstalt, Technische Universit&auml;t Wien, A-1040 Wien, Karlspaltz 13, Austria
<P>
The usual loading rate of impact testing is near to 0.5 m/s. As it will be demonstrated, force-time and force-deflection diagrams show at least at the beginning strong oscillations. Investigations on realistic loading rates showed, however, in most practical cases effective loading rates below 0.1 m/s. The loading rate of precracked Charpy-type testing is by using the Schnadt pendulum 0.1 m/s. Because of this factor in nearly every situation a loading rate of 0.1 m/s seems to be sufficient. If the loading rate is reduced from about 5 m/s to 0.1 m/s the force-deflection-diagram can be evaluated without parasitic oscillations. The measurement of fracture toughness, <I>Kid</I>, <I>Jd</I> and the calculation of CTOD becomes therefore easier. If the steels tested are sufficiently brittle, an extrapolation to the fracture toughness of larger sections becomes possible. Otherwise side grooving may help in obtaining realistic fracture toughness values. A comparison between fracture toughnesses measured at high and at low loading rates will be demonstrated. HSLA-steels, thermomechanically treated, will be used for the comparison.

EFFECTS OF INCLUSIONS ON DUCTILE FRACTURE OF AN Fe-42PCT Ni ALLOY IN TENSION AND SHEAR:</B> <I>N. Yuki*</I>, R. Foley** and G.

<P>
Effects of inclusions on ductile fracture have been examined with laboratory produced Fe-42 pct Ni alloy. The inclusion volume fraction was varied between approximately 0.01 and 3.00 pct. Axisymmetric tensile bars and cylindrical, double shear test samples were tested in the recrystallized condition. In the tensile test, increasing inclusion volume fraction significantly reduced post-uniform elongation and strain to fracture . In the shear test, fracture displacement obtained from load-displacement data and strain to fracture calculated from shear test samples decreased with increasing inclusion volume fraction. The fracture behavior in tension and in shear is related to inclusion distribution. Applicability of different models is considered.

<P>
Fracture studies of high strength low alloy steels, at very high loading (strain rates) of up to equal to 107 were conducted using specially designed Split Hopkinson Bar equipped with a swing arm mechanism capable of fracturing CT specimens with a thickness of 12.7 mm. While it was possible to reproduce the load-displacement curves for the specimens, evaluation of the fracture toughness was mostly obtained from post-test examination of the stretch zone ahead of the crack using scanning electron microscopy. Several factors affecting the stretch zone were identified including the effect of fatigue precracking as well as the method of measurement of the stretch zone (nine point vs. three point approach). Significant differences in the stretch zone were observed which are attributed to the extent of the constraint factor ahead of the crack due to fatigue precracking which demonstrates the occurrence of some nonlinearity in the initial part of the J-Stretch Zone Width relationship.

NEUTRON IRRADIATION EFFECTS ON THE DUCTILE-BRITTLE TRANSITION OF FERRITIC/MARTENSITIC STEELS:</B> <I>Ronald L. Klueh</I> and D. J. Alexander, Metals and Ceramics Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN 37831
<P>
Below ~450&#176;C, neutron irradiation hardens the Cr-Mo ferritic/martensitic steels considered for future fusion power plants. Hardening reduces ductility, but the major effect is an increase in the ductile-brittle transition temperature (DBTT) and a decrease in the upper-shelf energy (USE), as measured by a charpy impact test. After irradiation, DBTT values can increase to well above room temperature, thus increasing the chances of brittle rather than ductile fracture. Such a shift in DBTT could eliminate certain steels for nuclear applications. Steels are being developed for fusion applications that have a low DBTT prior to irradiation and then show only a small shift after irradiation. Low-chromium (3% Cr) and high-chromium (9% Cr) Cr-W steels are being investigated. A martensitic 9Cr-2WVTa (nominally Fe-9Cr-2W-0.25V-0.07Ta-0.1C) steel had a much lower DBTT than the conventional 9Cr-1MoVNb (Fe-9Cr-1Mo-0.25V-0.06Nb-0.1C) and 12Cr-1MoVW (Fe-12Cr-1Mo-0.25V-0.5W-0.5Ni-0.2C) steels prior to neutron irradiation and showed a much smaller increase after irradiation. The tantalum in 9Cr-2WVTa was concluded to affect the fracture stress. For the 3Cr steels, the type of bainitic microstructure formed during heat treatment affected the impact behavior. Granular bainite had inferior properties compared to an acicular bainite. Alloying was used to promote the acicular bainite. Improved toughness makes the steels candidates for both nuclear and non-nuclear applications.

MECHANISMS OF FATIGUE FRACTURE IN METALLIC, CERAMIC, AND INTERMETALLIC MATERIALS:</B> <I>Robert O. Ritchie</I>, Department of Materials Science and Mineral Engineering, University of California, Berkeley, CA 97420-1760 and, Center for Advanced Materials, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA 94720<P>
From his early micro-mechanical modeling of fatigue-crack propagation in anti-plane shear to his later hypothesis for the existence of a fatigue threshold, Frank McClintock has made many seminal contributions to the understanding of fatigue fracture in metallic materials. In this presentation, current thinking on the mechanics and mechanisms of fatigue is examined, with particular emphasis on the similarities and differences between metal fatigue and the failure of monolithic and composite intermetallics and ceramics under cyclic loading. This is achieved by considering the process of fatigue-crack growth as a mutual competition between intrinsic mechanisms of crack advance ahead of the crack tip (e.g., alternating shear), which promote crack growth, and extrinsic mechanisms of crack-tip shielding behind the tip (e.g., crack closure and bridging), which impede it. The widely differing nature of these mechanisms and their specific dependence upon the alternating and maximum driven forces (e.g., <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/symbols/cap-delta.gif">K and Kmax) provide a useful distinction of the process of fatigue-crack propagation in the different classes of materials.

OBSERVATIONS ON THE NUCLEATION AND MICROSTRUCTURALLY DEPENDENT CRACK PROPAGATION IN STRUCTURAL METALLIC MATERIALS:</B> <I>David W. Hoeppner</I>, Department of Mechanical Engineering and Quality and Integrity Design Engineering Center, University of Utah, 3209 MEB, Salt Lake City, UT 84112<P>
In the mid 1800's Sorby used the optical microscope to study fatigue deformation of materials and started an activity that continues with some vigor today. The early investigators of fatigue deformation wanted to learn the mechanism(s) of fatigue crack nucleation and propagation. This progress was aided by many investigators including Frank McClintock. McClintock and other investigators inspired many investigators to pursue the observation of fatigue deformation so that improved understanding of fatigue mechanisms could be attained. However, many studies that were made were &quot;static&quot;. That is, materials were exposed to cyclic loading and then viewed with the observational technique. While this allowed some progress to be made, this did not deal with the actual deformation(s) that were occurring and thus progress in understanding fatigue was very limited. However, some investigators did mount microscopes on fatigue machines and make what became known as &quot;in-situ&quot; observations. Some of the contributions made will be reviewed as background of this paper. The development of the scanning electron microscope has changed the understanding of cyclic deformation response in engineering and model materials. Starting in 1970 numerous investigators around the world developed fatigue machines that were either placed in the chamber of an SEM or were attached to the SEM. Contributions of Kromp, Weiss, Strickler, Kikukawa, Jono, Aachi, Davidson, Hoeppner and others will be reviewed. In addition the past 25 years has seen the development of numerous in-situ systems. This has led to much greater understanding of fatigue crack nucleation and microstructurally dependent propagation. These studies and observations will be reviewed in the paper.

DISLOCATION-CRACK INTERACTIONS DURING FATIGUE CRACK GROWTH:</B> <I>K. Sadananda1</I>, N. Louat2 A. K. Vasudevan3, 1Naval Research Laboratory, Code 6323, 4555 Overlook Drive SW, Washington D.

Fatigue crack growth occurs due to irreversibility associated with the plastic flow under cyclic load. Although crack growth occurs by plastic flow, the use of elastic fracture mechanics parameter to quantify crack growth may still be justified since material for the most part is under elastic loading, normally termed as small scale loading. In the past, concepts such as plasticity induced crack closure have crept into the literature and led to massive confusion in the literature in understanding and quantifying fatigue crack growth. We present new unifying concepts using dislocation models that accounts, load-ratio effects, so-called anomalous effects of short cracks, over-load and under-load effects, as well as concepts that connect the crack nucleation through Kitagaawa diagram.

FATIGUE FRACTURE STRIATION FORMATION AND ITS RELATION TO CRACK TIP BEHAVIOR:</B> <I>Campbell Laird</I> and Pedro Peralta, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Pennsylvania, 3231 Wanut Street, Philadelphia, PA 19104<P>
The mechanisms of fatigue striation formation are reviewed in terms of ductile and brittle fracture processes. Depending on these processes, fatigue striations can show considerable morphological variations, which are explained in terms of detailed slip processes and dislocation structures as well as fracture mechanisms. The problem of striation formation during intergranular crack propagation is also treated with respect to new results obtained on bicrystals having misorientation. These results are helpful for understanding how striation formation is related to the geometry and crystallography of slip at the crack tip.

INFLUENCE OF MICROSTRUCTURE ON LOW CYCLE FATIGUE FRACTURE:</B> <I>S. L. Mannan, </I>K. Bhanu Sankara Rao, Materials Development Division, Indira Gandhi Center for Atomic Research, Kalpakkam 603 102, India<P>
High temperature low cycle fatigue (LCF) has been an area of great interest in the last decades because of its relevance in nuclear and aerospace industrial applications. In general, the cyclic deformation and fracture of alloys engineered for high performance applications depend critically on the stability of initial microstructure during cyclic loading and on the slip mode, both of which in turn depending on temperature, govern the cyclic stress response and the mode of crack initiation and propagation. In order to attain adequate fatigue resistance in high temperature materials, a thorough understanding of quantitative relationship between initial microstructure and the fracture mode is required. Grain size, degree of prior cold work, thermal aging that occurs prior to and during service are the major structural parameters that influence LCF of austenitic stainless steels while the size and distribution of <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/symbols/gamma.gif">' and carbides control the cyclic deformation and fracture in nickel base superalloys. Low cycle fatigue studies have been conducted on 304SS to examine the effects of grain size (75, 310 and 700 &#181;m), cold work (0, 10, 20 and 30%) and thermal aging (923K: 1000h, 3000h, 5000h) on LCF fracture over a very wide temperature range (300-1023K). Fine grained material exhibited better endurance in terms of total and plastic strain amplitudes at all temperatures. The temperature dependence of fatigue life showed a complex behaviour. Medium and coarse grained alloy displayed a continuous reduction in life with increase in temperature with recovery in life at elevated temperatures. The effects of grain size on life were rationalised on the basis of martensite transformation, dynamic strain aging, oxidation and creep in the temperature range of their operation. The superior fatigue resistance of fine grained material has been attributed to the occurrence of trangranular fracture at all the temperatures. Cold work has been found to be both beneficial and harmful for fatigue life depending on the temperature. LCF life decreased with increasing PCW at and below 823K, whereas at 923K, PCW levels greater than 10% cold work exhibited recovery in life due to the reduced incidence of intergranular cracking. Thermal aging prior to LCF testing promoted transgranular cracking and improved fatigue resistance. The influence of microstructure (A: free from carbides and <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/symbols/gamma.gif">', B: peak aged spherical <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/symbols/gamma.gif">' of 18 nm diameter and C: overaged spherical <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/symbols/gamma.gif">' of 35 nm diameter) on strain controlled LCF behaviour of Nimonic PE-16 superalloy has been studied at 923 K. Coffin-Manson plots describing the plastic strain amplitude versus life showed that Microstructure A had maximum fatigue resistance while C displayed the least. Microstructure B showed a two slope behaviour in the Coffin-Manson plot. For this condition samples cycled at low strain amplitudes exhibited much shorter lives than would be expected by extrapolation from high strain portion of the plot. Microstructure A exhibited crack initiation in planar slip bands, followed by transgranular propagation marked by fatigue striations. In B, the fracture mode at high strains was transgranular, while at low strains propagation by both trans and intergranular (mixed mode) was observed. Alloy C displayed cleavage facets very frequently on the fracture surface, and crack propagation was mixed mode at all strain amplitudes. The microstructural dependence of LCF behaviour and fracture modes have been rationalised on the basis of operative deformation mechanisms, degree of slip homogenization and the evolving microstructure during cyclic deformation. The degree of homogeneity was assessed by slip band spacing measurements on tested samples. These studies on 304SS and Nimonic PE-16 emphasise the need for optimisation of microstructure for maximizing fatigue resistance.

CORROSION FATIGUE BEHAVIOR OF METALS AND ALLOYS:</B> <I>David J. Duquette</I>, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY 12180<P>
The qualitative aspects of the effects of corrosion on the fatigue behavior of metals and alloys have been recognized for more than 60 years. However, for much of that time, corrosion was assumed to lower fatigue resistance, simply by either inducing stress raisers in the form of pitting, or by reducing the cross-sectional area of a component. Modern research has shown that there may be a complex synergism between corrosion and the cyclic deformation response of metallic materials. This synergism may affect precrack deformation, crack nucleation and/or crack propagation. This presentation will address this synergism, and attempt to demonstrate that neither simple corrosion models for crack initiation, nor superposition models where corrosion rates and fatigue crack propagation rates are numerically added, are adequate to represent corrosion fatigue damage.

THE EVOLUTION OF A CONSTITUTIVE RELATION FOR FATIGUE CRACK GROWTH:</B> <I>Arthur J. McEvily</I>, Department of Metallurgy and Institute of Materials Science, U-136, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT 06268<P>
Load sequence effect can exert a strong influence on the rate of fatigue crack growth. For example, a large spike overload can result in a period of crack growth retardation after the overload. In order to calculate the number of delay cycles resulting from such an overload, a constitutive equation is needed, and it has been proposed that the following equation provides a generally valid constitutive relationship for the rate of fatigue crack growth: da/dN = A (<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/symbols/cap-delta.gif">Keff - Keffth)2 where <I>a</I> is the crack length, <I>N</I> is the number of cycles, <I>A</I> is a material constant, <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/symbols/cap-delta.gif">Keff is the effective range of the stress intensity factor, <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/symbols/cap-delta.gif">Keffth is the effective range of stress intensity factor at threshold. This equation can only be used if crack closure effects are accounted for. Examples of the use of the equation to calculate the number or retardation cycles following an overload as a function of specimen thickness will be given. In addition, the application of the equation to the study of short crack growth involving high-low and low-high load sequences will also be demonstrated.

MICROMECHANICS OF FATIGUE AND FRACTURE IN LAMELLAR TiAl:</B> <I>Bimal K. Kad, </I>Robert J. Asaro, Department of Applied Mechanics &amp; Engineering Sciences, University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093<P>
While phenomological correlations, or simple rules of mixtures, are an important initial step in predicting the composite bulk response, the complexities of inhomogeneous deformation in layered morphologies, strain partitioning and incompatibilities between the respective micro-constituents, and discrete interface slip characteristics present formidable challenges for microstructural design. Thus, finite element based numerical procedures, incorporating phyically based crystal plasticity models, are employed to study the evolution of non-uniform deformation, under monotonic and fully reversed cyclic loadings, in lamellar TiAl microstructures. The impetus for such efforts is to gather fundamental insight into microstructure sensitive deformation mechanisms, and to extract additional information, not obtainable from traditional mechanical property data measurements. Such an effort is particularly desirable to help track various aspects of plastic anisotropy of specific layers, and micro-constituents are implicit in polycrystalline aggregates. We will present several examples of experimentally observed, and numerically computed results, to identify hot spots for strain localization in fully reversed loadings, and prescribe microstructural remedies to alleviate such effects.

STEADY-STATE FATIGUE CRACK GROWTH IN COMPOSITE LAMINATES:</B> <I>J. Tong</I>, Department of Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering, University of Portmouth, Anglesea Building, Anglesea Road, Portmouth PO1 3DJ, UK<P>
Matrix crack growth behaviour under mechanical fatigue loading has been studied in a quasi-isotropic GFRP laminate. Detailed experimental observations have been made on the growth of individual cracks and the accumulation of cracks in &#177;45&#176;C as well as 90&#176; plies. The results show that when the crack length is sufficiently long compared with the layer thickness, the growth of fatigue cracks in off-axis layers is essentially independent of crack length, a phenomenon termed as steady-state cracking. A generalised plane strain finite element model has been constructed and used to relate the crack growth rate to the associated strain energy release rate. A good correlation has been achieved which indicates that strain energy release rate may be the appropriate parameter to characterise stable matrix growth behaviour in composite laminates.

MODELLING OF CREEP CRACK GROWTH: </B><I>George R. Webster</I>, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Imperial College, London, SW7 2BX, UK
<P>
Failure in high temperature components which suffer creep can occur by net section rupture, crack growth or some combination of both processes depending on the loading conditions. Failure by crack growth is most likely to occur from sites of stress concentration or in components which contain an initial defect. In many practical situations, cracking is preceded by an incubation period, or at least a transient region of very slow growth, prior to the onset of steady state behaviour. This transient region can occupy the majority of life and it is important that it is taken into account to obtain reliable lifetime predictions. In this presentation non linear fracture mechanics concepts will be used to predict the behaviour. A model involving the build up of damage in a process zone at a crack tip will be employed to describe an incubation period, the transient region and steady state crack propagation rates. The role of superimposed fatigue loading will be examined. The analysis will be applied to characterize high temperature crack growth in polycrystalline, directionally solidified and single crystal materials.

INTERFACIAL DECOHESION FROM SURFACE - ABSORBED EMBRITTLING ELEMENTS:</B> R.C. Muthiah1, Y. Xu2, <I>C.J. McMahon1</I> and J.L. Bassani2, 1Department of Materials Science and Engineering; 2Department of Mechanical Engineering and Applied Mechanics, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA
<P>
Motivated by problems in high-temperature cracking in superalloys exposed to an oxidizing environment, McClintock and Bassani (1981) developed a model that considered the diffusion along a grain boundary due to a concentration gradient alone and the resulting decohesion in the presence of the time-dependent crack-tip stresses. More recently, Bika and McMahon (1995) extended their ideas to include the influence of the crack-tip stress gradient on the diffusion process. In this paper we develop a model where diffusion is driven both by concentration and stress gradients while those stresses are directly influenced by cracking process. The formulation utilizes a cohesive zone model that couples creep deformation, diffusion, and damage ahead of a crack to predict the cracking due to dynamic embrittlement. This cracking process is being studied experimentally in systems in which the surface-active embrittling element comes either from the material itself, i.e., from surface segregation, or from the surrounding atmosphere. Both polycrystalline and bicrystal specimens are being employed. We have found that a precipitation-hardened copper-beryllium alloy makes an ideal model material for the study of stress-driven oxygen-induced embrittlement in high-strength alloys. The effect of varying the diffusion coefficient as function of direction in bicrystals is being investigated in a copper-tin alloy, in which the embrittlement comes from surface-segregated tin.

STRESS INDUCED ELECTRICAL FIELDS AND THEIR INFLUENCE ON HIGH TEMPERATURE FRACTURE IN CERAMICS:</B> <I>Rishi Raj</I>, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853
<P>
High temperature fracture in ceramics is nearly always controlled by the nucleation and growth of intergranular cavities. The mechanism of growth is stress induced diffusion of point defects. In ceramics the point defects are charged and therefore, their movement can be influenced by local electrical fields. Internal fields can arise near interfaces as a result of net segregation of charged defects to the interfaces. These electrical fields can, in turn, change the defect concentration, thereby, the self diffusivity in the nanoscale region adjacent to the interface. I will discuss, and present results from fundamental experiments that show how these fields can be influenced by applied stress and how these fields participate in the fracture kinetics. Further consideration leads us to speculate on the use of externally applied electrical fields to control nucleation and growth of cavities at grain boundaries.

CRITICAL ASSESSMENTS OF CAVITATION FAILURE PROCESS IN HIGH STRAIN-RATE SUPERPLASTIC MATERIALS:</B> <I>Kenji Higashi1</I>, M. Mabuchi2 H.

<P>
A new accommodation process for high-strain rate superplastic flow is analyzed from a viewpoint of the relaxation of stress concentrations at triple junctions of grain boundaries for the alloys and around reinforcement particles for the composites resulting from sliding at boundaries and interfaces. A special process by an accommodation helper such as a liquid phase is required to continue superplastic flow when the stress concentration is insufficiently relaxed by diffusional flow and/or diffusion-controlled dislocation movement under the given deformation conditions. A liquid plays an important role as an accommodation helper in the accommodation mechanisms of high strain-rate superplasticity, that is, in an assistance to relax stress concentrations caused by sliding. However, the presence of a liquid phase does not always lead to the high strain-rate superplasticity. The critical conditions such as optimum distribution, thickness and volume in liquid phase are discussed based on the observation results by transmission electron microscopy and cavitation behavior. Cavitation behavior at various conditions for liquid phases are investigated by a quantitative analysis for high strain rate superplastic materials. It is suggested from theoretical analysis that diffusion-controlled cavity growth is limited and the plastically-controlled cavity growth is dominant when stress concentrations at triple junctions of boundaries and around reinforcements are relaxed by the presence of a liquid phase, so that the cavity growth is significantly slow in a small cavity size range. This view was in agreement with the experimental data of the cavity growth rates.

ROLE OF DIFFUSIONAL RELAXATION IN FRACTURE OF ALUMINUM MATRIX COMPOSITES DURING CREEP AND SUPERPLASTICITY: </B><I>Rajiv S. Mishra</I> and Amiya K. Mukherjee, Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science, University of California, Davis, CA 95616
<P>
Reinforcement of metallic matrix with second phase ceramic particles can lead to significant increase in creep strength. Some of these composites also exhibit high strain rate superplasticity. The diffusional relaxation of stresses during creep and superplastic deformation plays an important role. For example, the creep fracture behavior depends on the diffusional relaxation rate. Diffusional relaxation models can be used to calculate the critical creep rate. Below the critical creep rate intergranular fracture is observed, whereas above the critical creep rate transgranular fracture is observed. These observations can be explained on the basis of metal/ceramic interface decohesion. The importance of early onset of interfacial cavitation in the analysis of creep data to obtain mechanistic interpretation is discussed. The change in high strain rate superplasticity mechanism with the size of reinforcement is also explained using the diffusional relaxation models.

CREEP FRACTURE DURING SOLUTE-DRAG CREEP AND SUPERPLASTIC DEFORMATION: </B><I>Eric M. Taleff*</I>, Donald R. Lesuer** and Chol K.

<P>
Creep fracture has been studied in Al-Mg and Al-Mg-Mn alloys undergoing solute-drag creep and in micro-duplex stainless steel undergoing superplastic deformation. Failure in these materials can be controlled by two mechanisms, neck formation and cavitation. The mechanism of creep fracture during solute-drag creep in Al-Mg is found to change from necking-controlled fracture to cavitation-controlled fracture as Mn content is increased. Binary Al-Mg material fails by neck formation during solute-drag creep, and cavities are formed primarily in the neck region due to high hydrostatic stresses. Ternary alloys of Al-Mg-Mn containing 0.25 and 0.50 wt pct Mn exhibit more uniform cavitation, with the 0.5Mn alloy clearly failing by cavity interlinkage. Failure in the micro-duplex stainless steel is controlled by cavity growth and interlinkage during superplastic deformation. Cavitation was measured at several strains, and cavitation is found to increase as an exponential function of strain. An important aspect of cavity growth in the superplastic stainless steel is the long latency time before cavitation occurs. For a short latency period, cavitation acts to significantly reduce ductility below that by neck growth alone. This effect is most pronounced in materials with high strain-rate sensitivity, for which neck growth occurs very slowly.

FAILURE BEHAVIOR OF DUCTILE LAYERS IN LAMINATED COMPOSITES:</B> <I>S. Bulent Biner</I>, Ames Laboratory, Iowa State University, 208 Metals Development Building, Ames, IA 50011
<P>
In this study, the failure of the ductile layers from collinear, multiple and delaminated cracks that occur in laminated composite systems was studied using a constitutive relationship that accounts for strength degradation resulting from the nucleation and growth of voids. The results indicate that in laminated composites, void nucleation and growth ahead of cracks occur at a much faster growth rate due to evolution of much higher stress values at the interface region. Except for short crack extensions, collinear and multiple cracks develop crack resistance curves similar to that seen for a crack in the ductile layer material as in homogenous isotropic cases. For delaminated crack cases, the fracture behavior is strongly influenced by the delaminating length. The resistance of the ductile layers to crack extension can be significantly reduced by short delamination lengths; however, for large delamination lengths the resistance to crack extension becomes greater than that seen for the ductile material.

HIGH TEMPERATURE CRACK GROWTH UNDER MIXED-MODE CONDITIONS:</B> William E. Churley and <I>James C. Earthman</I>, Department of Chemical and Biomedical Engineering, University of California, Irvine, CA 92717
<P>
Results from finite element analyses have long been used to model high temperature crack growth processes beginning with the pioneering work of Bassani and McClintock. Recently, finite element results have been used to to study the mechanisms of high temperature crack growth under mixed-mode loading. Experimental studies of this failure process in high temperature alloys and intermetallics have been performed by measuring crack growth direction and crack growth rate in specially designed specimens under Mode I, Mode II and a range of mixed-mode loading conditions. The focus has been on how certain multiaxial stress parameters determined from finite element results can be used to predict both the crack paths and crack growth rates observed experimentally. This approach has led to a better understanding of the dominant crack growth processes in the high temperature materials investigated.

ON VOID GROWTH IN VISCOPLASTIC SOLIDS UNDER CREEP-FATIGUE CONDITIONS:</B> <I>Raj Mohan</I> and F.W. Brust, Engineering Mechanics Department, Battelle Memorial Institute, Columbus, OH 43201 USA
<P>
The growth of intergranular voids in elastic-viscoplastic solids is studied using an axisymmetric micromechanical model. Numerical unit cell calculations are performed under remote slow as well as fast cyclic loading. Among the many issues examined include the effect of initial void shape, the effect of on boundary diffusion, the effect of primary creep mechanism, the effect of stress triaxiality as well as the role of elastic accommodation. The results of the study demonstrate that the void growth history and void shape evolution are significantly affected by stress triaxiality, material nonlinearity and initial void shape. The importance of accounting for primary creep mechanism, in addition to secondary creep (power-law creep) is demonstrated for cyclic loading conditions. The analyses shed some light on experimentally observed peculiar behavior under balanced cyclic loading.

TWO PARAMETER CHARACTERIZATION OF CRACK TIP FIELDS UNDER THERMOMECHANICAL LOADING:</B> <I>Noel P. O'Dowd</I>, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Imperial College, London, SW7 2BX, United Kingdom
<P>
Two parameter approaches (K-T, J-Q) have been used to account for constraint and geometry in fracture under mechanical testing. This paper examines the effect of thermal loading on the near tip constraint. Finite element analyses of representative thermal loading which give rise to high and low constraint fields (high and low T and Q) have been conducted. As in previous analyses linear elastic, power law hardening materials have been examined. Following the thermal loading the structure is subjected to mechanical loading, both tension and bending dominated to assess the effect on the near tip constraint. On subsequent mechanical loading it is observed that the two parameter structure of the fields is maintained and the values of Q stress have been obtained from the analyses. The thermal loading initially has a strong effect on the <I>Q</I> value but at higher loads when the mechanical loading dominates, this effect is much weaker. The ability of a combined thermo-mechanical <I>T</I> stress approach to characterize the variation in constraint is assessed.

HIGH TEMPERATURE FRACTURE OF 6061/Al2O3 MMC'S DEFORMED AT HIGH STRAIN RATES:</B> P. Ganguly and <I>Warren J. Poole</I>, Department of Metals and Materials Engineering, The University of British Columbia,, 309-6350 Stores Road, Vancouver, B.C., V6T 1Z4 Canada
<P>
The deformation of the particulate reinforced metal-matric composites (PRMMC) at high temperatures and high strain rates is of critical importance for a number of industrial forming applications, such as hot rolling and hot extrusion. The ductile fracture mechanism in this regime is the classic void nucleation, growth and coalescence, with the void nucleation arising from particle fracture or decohesion of the matrix-particle interface. To predict the onset of damage, it is important to be able to estimate the stress and strain states in and around the reinforcing particles. However, the situation is complicated by relaxation processes in the matrix, which tend to lower the stresses in the particles and at the matrix-particle interface. Furthermore, at large volume fractions (&gt;0.25), the interaction between adjacent particles becomes significant resulting in substantially larger hydrostatic stresses which can aid or deter the formation of the voids depending on whether the hydrostatic stresses are compressive or tensile. The present work aims at studying the failure of PRMMC at high temperature (200&#176;C to 550&#176;C) and moderately high strain rates (0.1 to 10 s-1). Collar compression testing will be used to evaluate the ductility of these materials. The deformation of the macroscopic sample (i.e. w/o the explicit presence of the particles, but with the mechanical properties of the composite) has been modelled using the FEM code ABAQUS. The deformation at the particle length scale has been then determined by imposing the boundary conditions from the macroscopic model on a unit-cell FEM model with single or multiple particles. Metallographic examination of the fracture sites has also been conducted to aid the interpretation of the fracture mechanism.

ON THE MECHANISMS AND TOUGHNESS OF DUCTILE FRACTURE:</B> <I>Alexander D. Vasilev</I> and S. A. Firstov, Francevich Institute for Problems of Materials Science, 3 Krjijanivskoho str., Kyiv-142, UA-252680, Ukraina

The mechanism of ductile fracture of metallic and some ceramic materials subjected to uniaxial and bending loading in a wide temperature range as well as fracture toughness, and its temperature and structural dependencies are discussed. The main instrument that was used to formulate the ductile fracture mechanism was scanning and transmission electron microscopy of single and polycrystalline, and strengthened by particles, materials. On the basis of study of fracture surfaces of pre-deformed pure particleless materials, the mechanisms of void nucleation, growth and coalescence of voids was found. <I>The pore in particleless materials nucleate along the boundaries of dislocation cellular structure that formed in a course of deformation preceding fracture</I>. The nucleation of pores and subsequent delaminations along the cell and grain boundaries is the main reason of the fracture toughness increase of pre-deformed materials. With the longitudinal cleavage technique it is shown that the intergranular pores nucleate first of all. The decrease of grain size promotes to the transition from cleavage to ductile, by void coalescence, fracture. In materials strengthened with particles there is the temperature region where particles, even with weak interface, do not play the preferable sites of pores nucleation. In those materials, two kinds of ductile, by void coalescence, fracture mechanism may be determined. It is shown that the same mechanism of pores nucleation is valid in ionic (NaCl) single crystals but at temperature above 0.6 of melting temperature. In partially stabilized zirconia single crystals some dislocation plasticity arises at temperature above 1300&#176;C and results in delaminations along interdomain boundaries that points out the same mechanism of pores nucleation. In silicon nitride ceramics the dimple-like, the so-called foam-like, fracture may be found as a result of decomposition of silicon nitride into silicon oxide and gases at temperature above 1000&#176;C. To estimate the fracture toughness of materials failed by ductile manner, the formula: where is the yield stress, is the elastic modulus and is the diameter of the dimples, is proposed. It is shown also that toughness of ductile fracture decreases with temperature and is proportional to the root square of the yield stress. All the conclusions are proven using fractographical data.

<P>MODELING OF THE POWDER/MONOTAPE METHOD FOR TITANIUM MATRIX COMPOSITE CONSOLIDATION:</B> <I>C.C. Bampton</I>, K.J. Newell, Rockwell Science Center, P.O. Box 1085, Thousand Oaks, CA 91358
<P>
<P>A computer model, Discrete Element Consolidation Analyzer (DECA), is described which was developed with support from Wright Laboratory, to assist in the optimization and control of the so-called tape-cast powder monotape processing method for titanium matrix composite consolidation. DECA simulates the viscoplastic densification of a randomly packed spherical titanium alloy powder aggregate and continuous fiber array by hot pressing. Using state variable analysis together with automated remeshing, the model performs a continuous simulation of powder particle contact-contact interaction, free surface evolution and void closure. A unique capability of this model is the realistic simulation of the final random powder packing geometry, prior to consolidation, following the debulking, i.e., binder off-gassing, and powder settling and fiber rearrangement, of the initial tape-cast powder/fiber monotape.

<P>A DENSIFICATION CONSTITUTIVE MODEL FOR POWDER BASED ALUMINUM MATRIX COMPOSITES MATERIALS:</B> <I>Erik J. Jilinsk, </I>John J. Lewandowski, Dept. of Material Science and Engineering, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH 44106; Paul T. Wang, The Aluminum Company of America, Alcoa Technical Center, Alcoa Center, PA 15169
<P>
<P>Intelligent, cost effective processing of powder based materials requires an understanding of the key physical variables during processing and the ability to implement these variables into suitable analytical models that can describe the overall consolidation behavior of the powdered material during fabrication. In this presentation, a modified form of the Gurson continuum level densification model, derived through a micromechanical approach, is developed and applied to an aluminum metal matrix composite reinforced with SiC particulate. The results of this model, also applicable to short or chopped fiber reinforced powder based composite material, capture the influence that volume fraction of reinforcement has on the densification of the powder based aluminum alloy metal matrix composite and provides the first step of the analytical framework needed for designing a process model capable of describing the consolidation behavior of the composite material during a powder forging type fabrication process.

<P>MODELING THE HOT CONSOLIDATION OF METAL POWDERS AND METAL-MATRIX COMPOSITES:</B> <I>R.E. Dutton</I>, S.L. Samiatin, Materials Directorate, Wright Laboratory, WL/MLLM, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 45433
<P>
<P>The modeling of the deformation and densification behavior of metal powders during hot consolidation processes was treated through the application of a continuum yield function and associated flow rule modified to incorporate microstructure effects such as grain growth, pore size, and pore geometry. It was shown that consolidation behavior can be described over the entire range of densities through two parameters, Poisson's ratio and the stress intensification factor, which are readily measured using uniaxial upset tests. The accuracy of the material modeling approach was validated by comparing the densification predicted from both a simple analytical model and an FEM with observed behavior during the die-pressing of monolithic gamma titanium aluminide powder and the hot-isostatic pressing of tapecast monotape composite layups comprising alpha-two titanium powder and continuous silicon carbide fibers. In addition, the effect of pore anisotropy on the yielding and flow behavior of partially consolidated powder compacts was addressed.

<P>PHYSICAL MODELING OF THE EARLY STAGES OF METAL POWDER CONSOLIDATION AND COMPARISON TO EXISTING ANALYTICAL MODELING APPROACHES:</B> David P. DeLo, Henry R. Piehler, Dept. of Materials Science and Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA 15213
<P>
<P>The important mechanisms during the early stages of metal powder consolidation are not well understood nor are they properly included in consolidation models. The result is that models tend to underpredict strain-rates, particularly during the early stages of consolidation. In a series of interrupted HIP experiments, PREP Ti-6Al-4V powder was consolidated in thin-walled containers, and the resulting partially consolidated specimens examined metallographically. Stereo micrographs of fractured specimen surfaces were examined qualitatively and quantitatively to gain insights into early stage mechanisms and appropriate modeling approaches. Evidence of particle rearrangement was found throughout the early stages of consolidation. Contact areas between particles increase in size at a much slower rate than is predicted by popular mechanistic models. Particle size effects, including rigid body motion of larger particles facilitated by preferential deformation of small particles, contribute to rearrangement. The critical assumptions required for common mechanistic and continuum models are not consistent with the observed mechanisms and behaviors requiring new modeling approaches that are consistent with the observed behavior.

<P>CONSOLIDATION OF NANOSTRUCTURED METAL POWDERS BY RAPID FORGING:</B> <B>PROCESSING, MODELING, AND SUBSEQUENT MECHANICAL BEHAVIOR:</B> G.R. Shaik, Walter W. Milligan, Dept. of Metallurgy and Materials Engineering, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI 49931
<P>
<P>Nanostructured metals are a potentially-promising class of materials with ultrafine grain sizes. A limitation on commercial implementation of nanostructured materials has been grain coarsening during consolidation. In this research, attritor-milled powders with 20 nm grain sizes inside micrometer-sized powder particles were consolidated by induction heating and rapid forging of cold-pressed compacts. Grain growth was limited by minimizing the time at consolidation temperature. Fully-dense materials were obtained at relatively low temperatures around 500&#176;C. The consolidation process was successfully modeled with the Arzt-Ashby-Easterling HIP model, modified slightly for geometrical constraints, stress state and the nature of the nanostructured metal. Modeling and mechanical testing indicated that creep dominated the consolidation process, apparently due to the ultrafine microstructures. Mechanical properties at ambient and elevated temperatures.

P/M APPLICATIONS IN THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY:</B> <I>Alan Lawley</I>, Dept. of Materials Engineering, Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA 19104<P>
The North American automotive industry is now a major user of P/M products. In the last sixteen years the weight of P/M parts in a family vehicle has increased from 7.7 to 13.7 kg. and this trend is expected to continue. The results of a recent Delphi Study predict substantial growth over the next decade in power train applications (camshaft lobes, conrods, bearing caps, transmission gears, valve seat inserts, and valve guidelines). In this presentation, three P/M automotive case studies are examined in terms of the technical and economical factors that resulted in commercial viability: (i) the pressed and sintered main bearing cap, (ii) the warm formed turbine hub, and (iii) the powder forged connecting rod. Potential new P/M automotive applications are also discussed.

PRESSURE CYCLING ENHANCED DENSIFICATION IN SEVERAL COMPOSITE COMPACT SYSTEMS:</B> <I>Ching-Yao Huang, </I>G.S. Daehn, Dept. of Materials Science and Engineering, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210<P>
Recently, it has been observed that pressure cycling can significantly enhance densification of composite powder compacts in the constrained uniaxial consolidation. The simple explanation for this is that differential compressibility in the constituents of composites drives plasticity in the deformable phrase and the net compressive stress biases the resulting strain to fill porosity in compacts. In the present paper, several composites powder systems including Pb, Zn, Al matrices and Al2O3p, TiO2p, SiCw, reinforcements have been studied in room temperature consolidation in static and cyclic loading. Effects of pressure cycle maximum stress, amplitude, and period on the densification of composite powder compacts are observed and analyzed in terms of matrix strength as well as reinforcement properties including size, shape, and agglomeration. Some simple ideas are able to explain the observed results.

HIGH-NITROGEN AUSTENITIC STAINLESS STEEL POWDERS PORDUCED BY GAS ATOMIZATION:</B> G.O. Rhodes, W.B. Eisen, Crucible Research Center, 6003 Campbells Run Rd., Pittsburgh, PA 15205<P>
Nitrogen is increasingly being utilized as an interstitial alloying element in stainless steels due to the intrinsic benefits imparted on the strength and corrosion resistance properties. Using an alloy design model, austenitic stainless steel powders consisting of about 6-12% manganese, 22% nickel, 25-28% chromium, 4-8% molybdenum and having 0.6 to 1.25% nitrogen have been produced using nitrogen gas atomization. The nitrogen contents attained are substantially higher than predicted at a temperature of 1600&#176;C and nitrogen partial pressure of 100kPa using current thermodynamic models. The powders are subsequently consolidated to full density by hot isostatic pressing (HIP), and in the solution annealed condition the materials exhibit tensile yield strengths of up to 700 MPa with good tensile ductility and excellent corrosion resistance. The development and evaluations of the new steel are described in comparison to other established super austenitic stainless steels and nickel base corrosion resistant alloys.

SELF SINTERING AND BONDING USING ELECTROEXPLODED NANOSIZE ALUMINUM POWDERS:</B> Henry R. Piehler, Gennady V. Ivanov, Frederick Tepper, Dept. of Materials Science and Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA 15213; Institute of Petroleum Chemistry, Academy of Sciences, Tomsk, Russia; Argonide Corp., Gateway Towers, Pittsburgh, PA 15222<P>
Aluminum powders approximately 100 nanometers in diameter, made by the process of electroexplosion of wire in argon, have stored surface and strain energy that is released at threshold temperatures well below the melting point. This energy release and accompanying temperature increase allows self sintering and bonding to occur at relatively low temperatures. We studied the self sintering of nanosize aluminum powders made by electroexplosion by heating cold compacted pellets to 450C, at which point they exothermed with the generation of light and sufficient heat to partially melt the pellets. Preliminary results are also reported for bonding conventional aluminum powders and sheets using the energy release and temperature increase from exotherming nanosize electroexploded aluminum powders.

FREE FROM FABRICATION OF HIGH STRENGTH METAL COMPONENTS &amp; DIES:</B> <I>C.C. Bampton</I>, K. Newell, S. Fowser, Rockwell Science Center, Thousand Oaks, CA 91358; Rocketdyne, DeSoto Avenue, CA 91303<P>
A two-staged method has been developed for free form fabrication of nickel and iron based alloy parts directly from alloy powders without the need for tooling or machining. The method provides shape and property control equal or superior to investment castings in the same base alloys. A major advantage of the approach is the ability to utilize commercially available selective laser sintering systems with virtually no modification from their standard configurations as intended for plastic model generation direct from CAD data bases. We have demonstrated the feasibility of shape, dimension and property control for complex, low production volume rocket engine components and for tools and dies intended for higher volume commercial production applications in fully hard commercial steels and superalloys. A new finite element model has been developed specifically to aid in control of sinter densification without distortion or cracking.

DEVELOPMENT OF A MANUFACTURING PROCESS FOR AFFORDABLE, COMPLEX NET SHAPE P/M COMPONENTS:</B> Ellen W. Robare, Clifford M. Bugle, Tony E. Zahrah, Phillip A. Parrish, Dynamet, Inc. Washington, PA 15301; MATSYS, Inc., Arlington, VA 22209
<P>
This paper describes the background and progress of a research and development effort called Rapid Net Shape Forming. This effort involves the development and reduction to practice of a process, known as the MetalShell process, for manufacturing complex net shape powder metal components. The process involves the use of electroformed nickel to create a net shape HIP canister. One of the outstanding features of the process is that it can be used to make hollow parts with thin walls. Potential applications for this technology include titanium and beryllium components including fan blades, inlet guide vanes, nozzle hardware, prosthetic devices, and intermetallic and composite components. This effort uses recent advances in process modeling and in-process sensing technologies to reduce the lead time and number of iterations required to make a net shape component. This is turn will make components more cost effective. The areas being exploited include rapid prototyping from CAD files to generate patterns and molds, numerical simulation of the electroforming process to optimize shield design and uniformity of canister thickness, and numerical simulation of HIP consolidation to predict final component dimensions.

ENHANCEMENT OF SINTERING KINETICS IN NANOCRYSTALLINE ALUMINA POWDERS BY ELECTRIC PULSING:</B> <I>R.S. Mishra</I>, A.K. Mukherjee, Dept. of Chemical Engineering and Material Sciences, University of California, Davis, CA 95616<P>

Plasma activated sintering (PAS) involves application of electric pulsing before the sintering cycle. A comparative study has been carried out on nanocrystalline alumina powders with <I>y</I> and <I>a</I> starting phases. The results obtained with and without electric pulsing clearly establish the enhanced sintering kinetics due to prior electric pulsing. These results are explained on the basis of dielectric properties of the powders. In addition the present results show that the powder with <I>a</I>-phase sinters better. High densities (&gt;98%) can be obtained in less than 10 minutes at 1573 K. The time and temperature are significantly lower as compared to the conventional sintering parameter of 1773 K and 3 h. The reason for slower sinterability of powder with <I>y</I>-phase is linked to formation of vermicular structuring during transformation to <I>a</I>-phase. Examples of obtaining sintered products with simple shape in one step using PAS would be shown.

<P>
The feasibility and cost benefit of using PIM for the manufacture of aerospace components was investigated. An optimized thermal processing cycle was developed for hydrogen sintering, vacuum sintering, and HIPing the PIM Inconel 718 parts. The parts were subsequently solution and precipitation heat treatment. A tensile, creep, stress rupture, low cycle fatigue, and high cycle fatigue data base was generated. Tensile properties exceeded AMS 5663 minimum specification requirements. The associated cost reduction was greater than 50%. Both J52-P-409 Bushings and F119 Aircraft Mounted Nozzle Sidewall Saddle Supports were fabricated out of PIM Inconel 718.

<P>
Cubic phase alloys of (Al2Cr)3Ti are being developed as high temperature, oxidation resistant coatings for Ti-based materials. High quality powders of these alloys have been made by high pressure gas atomization (HPGA) and are now available from a commercial powder manufacture. The powders have been applied to Ti-6Al-4V, Ti-6242, and Ti-47Al2Cr-2Nb alloy sample pieces using low pressure plasma spray (LPPS) to form coatings 100-150&#181;m thick. Coupons cut from the samples have been subjected to high temperature cyclic oxidation tests. The as applied and oxidation tested coatings have been analyzed for structure and integrity. The results of these tests and analysis, related advancements in coating development, and powder processing will be discussed.

MICROSTRUCTURAL ANALYSIS OF MECHANICALLY ALLOYED AND POWDER METALLURGY PROCESSED W-HfC AND W-Ir-HfC PENETRATOR RODS:</B> <I>Christine Kennedy</I>, L.E. Murr, S. Pappu, D. Kapoor*, Dept. of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering, The University of Texas at El Paso, El Paso, TX 79968; *Army Research Development and Engineering Center, Picatinny, NJ 07806
<P>
Tungsten heavy alloys (WHA) as well as depleted uranium (DU) alloys (U-0.75% (Ti) for example) have been the primary materials employed in large caliber, U.S. tank ammunition or kinetic energy (KE) penetrators. Since the deformation behaviors and resulting ballistic performance of these alloys are different, there has been considerable effort to develop alternative and more effective penetrator materials. This study involves the mechanical alloying (MA) and PM processing of tungsten-hafnium carbide (1, 2, and 5 weight percent) and W-HfC containing 0.1% lr as a novel approach to WHA development. Slugs of W-1HfC, W-5HfC, and W-2HfC-0.5 lr and W-5HfC-0.5 lr processed from MA powder corresponding to high-speed attritor milling times ranging from 8 to 40 h, have been examined by light metallography and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). These products are remarkably free of disclocations and average (bulk) hardness range from 700 VHN for W-1HfC to 1200 VHN for W-5HfC precursor powders milled 16 h. The corresponding W-5HfC-0.5 lr hardness was 1250 VHN, and there were some interesting metallographic differences between the W-5HfC and W-5HfC-0.5 lr. HfC particle size and size distribution measurements have also been made in the TEM, and the effects of attritor milling time on residual hardness and microstructure have been examined.

IN SITU METAL MATRIX COMPOSITES UTILIZING INTERMETALLIC MATRIX COMPOSITE (IMC) REINFORCEMENT:</B> S.L Kampe*, J.S. Marte*, L. Christodoulou**, T. Zarrah**, *Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA 24061; **MATSYS, Inc., Arlington, VA 22209
<P>
A new processing methodology is described whereby metal matrices are reinforced in situ by deformation-processing of metal/IMC blends. The IMC &quot;reinforcement&quot; is exemplified by its high strength, attributable to high loadings of dispersed ceramic (e.g. 30-50 v%) within its intermetallic matrix. Processability of the metal/IMC composite is governed by the thermodynamic compatibility of the metal and the intermetallic, and the relative high temperature flow behavior of the metal and the IMC. The methodology will be illustrated through its application to a titanium metal matrix composite, produced by hot extrusion of prealloyed Ti-6Al-4V and IMC (Al3Ti + 40 v% TiB2) powders. Microstructures and preliminary mechanical behavior will be presented for composites produced over a range of deformation processing conditions and with varying percentages of IMC reinforcement.

THERMO-FLUID ISSUES IN SPRAY FORMING</B>: <I>Michael M. Chen</I>, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109-2125; Dawn White Ford Scientific Laboratories, Dearborn, MI, Chuan Li, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109-2125
<P>
A critical review on the heat transfer and fluid mechanical issues of spray forming will be presented. The paper will focus on those thermo-fluid issues which have important influence on the spray and solidification processes as well as the properties of the product, combining the perspectives of materials and manufacturing scientists and specialists in heat transfer and fluid mechanics. Among the topics to be considered are atomization, dynamics of sprays, including oversprays, droplet solidification, splat formation due to impact of liquid droplets and partially solidified particles with the substrate, heat transfer and solidification in the formed part, and residual stress formation. Emphases will be placed on current levels of understanding of the physics from a first principles point of view, semi-quantitative estimates of the length and time scales of interest, and current capabilities for accurate modeling and prediction. Recommendations for future research and development will also be made, based on results of the survey.

NUMERICAL INVESTIGATION OF MULTI-PHASE FLOW INDUCED POROSITY FORMATION IN SPRAY DEPOSITED MATERIALS</B>: <I>J.-P. Delplanque</I>, E.J. Lavernia, R.H. Rangel, Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science, University of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA 92697-2575
<P>
Several mechanisms have been recently identified as responsible for porosity formation in spray deposited materials. These mechanisms may be categorized according to their underlying fundamental nature; chemical (e.g., porosity generated by a foaming agent), physical (e.g, solidification shrinkage porosity), or dynamical (e.g., liquid-jet overflow). This investigation focuses on the latter category: pore formation mechanisms related to liquid metal flow and interactions between the flowing liquid metal and the irregular solid formed by the previously deposited droplets. These mechanisms are investigated using a combination of analytical models and detailed numerical simulations. The numerical model is based on a Navier-Stokes solver combined with the Volume Of Fluid method to track free surfaces. A multi directional algorithm is used to simulate the solidification process. The model case considered is that of liquid metal flooding of a random dense particle packing made of solidified droplets. Particular attention is devoted to cases where there is insufficient liquid to fill all the interstices and to capillary effects.

A model of the flow of melts on rotating disks has been combined with models based on wave theory to predict the size of powder particles in centrifugal atomisation/spray forming. The analysis considers the role of process parameters and materials properties on powder size.

<B>NUMERICAL SIMULATION OF GAS ATOMIZATION IN SPRAY FORMING PROCESS:</B> <I>Huimin Liu</I>, Concurrent Technologies Corporation, 1450 Scalp Avenue, Johnstown, PA 15904
<P>
The spray forming process is emerging as a cost-effective manufacturing route for net and near-net shape preforms in a wide range of materials. In the past, numerical simulations have been made to model the melt delivery, the spray deposition, and the consolidation stages in the spray forming process. However, the atomization stage, particularly gas flow in the nozzle-close region and melt break-up kinetics, have not been adequately simulated. Atomization is a key stage in the spray forming process because it determines the size, size distribution, and initial conditions of the particles, hence, influences particle velocity, temperature, cooling rate, microstructure, and thus the mechanical properties of the spray-formed preforms. This work uses numerical tools to model atomization mechanisms. The full compressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved to simulate the gas flow in the nozzle-close region. The melt flow and heat transfer are modeled on the basis of the boundary layer theory and the modified van Driest and Cebeci mixing-length turbulence model. The information on the flow and temperature fields obtained from the numerical simulation is then used to investigate melt break-up and droplet formation during atomization.

MODELING OF OSPREY SPRAY METAL FORMING PROCESS:</B> <I> T.R. Govindan</I>, The Pennsylvania State University, Applied Research Laboratory, P.O. Box 30, North Atherton Street, State College, PA 16804-0030
<P>
A detailed computational model of the spray metal forming process is being developed. The model provides process figures of merit, identify process control parameters, and help process design in support of the process development activity. The core of the model is an Eulerian-Lagrangian flow solver in which the gas phase is treated in an Eulerian framework involving the Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes equations and the droplets are treated as a discrete phase involving single particle dynamics. Statistics are generated from the discrete phase by computing a large sample of particle &quot;trajectories&quot; in the force field due to the gas phase. In turn, particle statistics generate forces in the gas phase equations. Models are used in the discrete phase for particle drag, heat transfer, and solidification. The computer code is capable of handling complex three-dimensional geometries. Results will be presented showing details of the two-phase flow in a typical Osprey spray chamber; gas flow velocity and temperature distributions, gas flow and droplet interactions, droplet cooling curves and deposition profiles. Computed results will be compared with available experimental data.

An induction skull melting (ISM) spray forming process was used to investigate the spray atomization and deposition of tantalum alloys. Several systems were considered in order to tackle the scientific issues inherent to the spray forming of refractory metals in a gradual manner. Optical microscopy, X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy were used to characterize the spray formed materials and oversprayed powders. A theoretical and numerical analysis of the deposition and solidification of tantalum alloy droplets was conducted concurrently. This approach is based on a multi-directional solidification model combined with a Navier Stokes solver for flows with interfaces. Various droplet size and impact velocities consistent with the experiments were considered. The simulation results and the experimental data were compared and analyzed in order to identify the critical process parameters controlling the microstructure and porosity of as-deposited tantalum alloys.

<P>
A non-adiabatic calorimetric method was developed and used to determine the enthalpy of droplets in a spray as a function of flight distance with the purpose of providing critical information for the controlled spray forming using uniform-droplet sprays (UDS). A UDS consists of droplets that are uniform in size and thermal history and can be used to produce a variety of novel deposit microstructures in a controlled manner. Such controlled spray forming, however, requires thorough characterization of the thermal state of the uniform droplets. The calorimetric method developed accounts for the heat loss that occurs while collecting the droplets in the calorimeter, and uses a data acquisition system for in-situ determination of droplet enthalpy. Comparison of measured droplet enthalpy values and those predicted by model calculations shows a very good agreement.

<P>
The spray forming process offers advantages for both material properties and process technology. A deeper understanding of the spray forming process, with particular concern to the complex disintegration phase and the formation of the deposit. The present work introduces an experimental set-up to investigate the in-flight behavior of sprayed droplets. In a chamber with controlled atmosphere, a spray cone is wire. This process allows to skip the complete melting unit of a spraying facility and facilitates maintaining a spraying experiment for a desired period of time (a couple of minutes generally) and changing the set of parameters for the next experiment within minutes in order to save time diameter and feed rate, laser beam power and intensity, and atomizing gas flow. During spraying of mild steel with nitrogen, the nitrogen content of droplets sampled at various locations within the spray cone is investigated. The results of the in-flight interaction of the sprayed dropletes with the ambient atmosphere are discussed.

MODELLING DROPLET BEHAVIOUR DURING SPRAY FORMING USING FLUENT:</B> P.S. Grant, R.P. Underhill, B.

<P>
A finite difference based fluid dynamics software program, FLUENT, has been used to model the 2-dimensional dynamic and thermal behaviour of Udimet 720 droplets during gas atomisation and spray forming. The effect of atomising gas pressure pressure, spray distance and melt mass flow rate (MFR) on the equilibrated droplet spray temperature has been examined and the predictions compared with measured maximum deposit temperatures from spray forming experiments performed under the same process conditions. The predicted spray temperatures at the substrate were always higher than the measured deposit temperatures under all conditions, and were found to increase with (I) decreasing gas pressure, (ii) decreasing spray distance, and (iii) increasing MFR. Mean droplet temperatures and velocities were found to be strongly dependent on droplet size with mean droplet temperature decreasing, and mean droplet axial velocities increasing, with decreasing droplet size.

EXPERIMENTAL BASED DETECTION OF THE SPLASH LIMITS FOR THE NORMAL AND OBLIQUE IMPACT OF MOLTEN METAL PARTICLES ON DIFFERENT SURFACES:</B> M. Berg, J. Ulrich, Universitat Bremen, SFB 372,Verfahrenstechnik/FB4, Postfach 330440, D-28334 Bremen, Germany
<P>
Understanding of the impact of single molten metal particles contribute to reduce the overspray during the spray deposition processes. The impact of molten Pb- and Sn-particles with a flat solid surface is investigated experimentally. The impact process is monitored by a high speed video system. At each measurement all temperatures (particle, target, and ambient) are taken as the weight of the particle before and after impact. By means of the image processing, the final diameter of the splat is found and evaluated regarding physicla properties, impacting diameter, impact power, and target surface roughness. By the weight difference of a particle before and after the impact, amount of splashing material is detected. The impact diameter, the impact speed, and the spreading diameter are also observed by the high speed, and the spreading diameter are also observed by the high speed video system. The results are presented in the form of diagrams with dimensionless numbers such as the ratio of the maximum spreading diameter, d, to the initial particule diameter, D. Other numbers such as Weber, We, or Reynolds, Re, in connection with d/D ratio give the possibility of comparing all experimental results with each other. A critical dimensionless number above which splashing exists has been discussed.

MICROSTRUCTURE CHARACTERIZATION OF AL-SI AND AL-MMCS PROCESSED BY SPRAY ATOMIZATION AND DEPOSITION: </B> Jose Luis Estrada, Enrique Nicolas, Instituto Politecnico Nacional, Unidad Profesional Adolfo Lopez Mateos, MEXICO; Enrique J. Lavernia, Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science, University of California, Irvine, CA 92717<P>
The spray atomization and deposition process is described as applied to Al-Si alloys and Al-Si metal matrix composites. This process shown to be similar to powder metallurgy (P/M) in that advanced alloys can be manufactured. However, many difficulties inherent in P/M are avoided, including oxide film formation and the need for degassing. In the spray atomization and deposition process atomized droplets exist for only a few milliseconds before being deposited to form high density preforms. The primary metallurgical characteristics of Al-12w/oSi, Al-17w/oSi, Al22w/oSi and Al-alloy based MMCs reinforced with SiC particulates preforms are presented. Characterization of the preforms consisted of the description of the production technique, descriptions of the microstructures by light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and Auger electron spectroscopy. The volume percentage of reinforced particles was determined. Both the spray deposited Al-Si alloys and the Al-Si metal matrix composites exhibited a rapid solidified matrix microstructure and the spray deposited MMCs a relatively uniform distribution of reinforcements.

TUNGSTEN BORIDE SYNTHESIS IN BURNING</B>: <I>S.V. Nikolenko</I>, V.V. Gostischev, Institute of Materials, Far Eastern Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Khabarovsk, Russia<P>
Nowadays, a great theoretical and practical interest is observed towards tungsten boride, that can be explained by its' specific physical, chemical and mechanical properties. This paper discusses the process of tungsten boride extraction by alumothermy from the tungsten-containing mineral (sheelite concentrate) derived from the original product by enriching. The experiments were conducted in air and vacuum. The study of the extracted products has shown that their composition differs and depends on the synthesis conditions. For example, if we use B2O3, in relation W:B=1:2; 1:3; 1:4, as a boride element, then we get the lower borides as the synthesis products: W2B, WB and metallic tungsten. The use of boron oxide with coal gives W2C together with W2B5. Including boron carbide guarantees that we shall receive the higher boride W2B5, independently from the environment of the reaction, due to the high speed of the burning. The conducted set of experiments, shows the possibility of synthesizing tungsten boride-base powders from the enriched mineral raw materials, which can be used for electro-spark and laser deposition of wear and heat resistant harding coats on construction and instrumental steels.

POROSITY AND OXIDE DISTRIBUTION IN SPRAY FORMED Al-Cr-Zr ALLOYS</B>: M. Baker, A. Hellwig, A.F. Norman, <I>P. Tsakiropoulos</I>, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey GU2 5XH, UK<P>
In spray formed Al alloys porosity is common and typically about 2 to 8% depending on alloy and product form and the oxygen content is typically less than the level of oxygen in commercially produced RS/PM Al alloys. There is no experimental evidence available about the distribution of Al2O3 in spray formed Al alloys. We have studied the size and distribution of pores and the distribution of oxides in spray formed Al-Cr-Zr alloys. The fracture surfaces of the as sprayed and forged deposits were examined by AES and SAM. Cratered regions on the in situ fracture surfaces were identified and a localized 2nm thick Al2O3 film on their surface was measured by high resolution AES. The fracture path followed areas rich in Al2O3.

STUDY OF MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROPERTIES OF SPRAY FORMED Al-Cr-Zr ALLOYS</B>: A.F. Norman, <I>P. Tsakiropoulos</I>, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey GU2 5XH, UK<P>
The technical problems and cost associated with the multi-step PM processing of RS Al alloys have hindered their successful development. Spray forming can obviate these problems by means of the integral inert gas atomisation and deposition operation in which the alloy exists in particulate form only for a few milliseconds. Spray forming experiments have been performed on Al-Cr-Zr alloys studied previously by the combined RS/PM route. The microstructure and the tensile properties of the forged and heat treated deposits will be compared with the RS/PM alloy. The latter exhibits superior properties, not matched by the spray formed alloy.

ABOUT SELECTION AND DESIGN OF ELECTRODE MATERIALS FOR ELECTRO-SPARK ALLOYING OF STEELS</B>: <I>A.D. Verkhoturo, </I>S.V. Nikolenko, Institute of Materials, Far Eastern Branch of Russian Academy of Sciences, Khabarovsk, Russia<P>
Earlier, we have proposed several parameters of selecting and designing electrode materials for electro-spark alloying (ESA) of metallic surfaces. These parameters were developed according to the necessity of achieving the maximum depth, continuity, the least stress in the alloyed layer (AL), as well as the least roughness. However, the developed principles account only for the &quot;geometrical&quot; characteristics of AL, without accounting for the technological characteristics, and the current manufacturing demands: higher productivity of the ESA process, creating the optimal conditions for the AL forming. Considering all of the above this paper discusses: 1) The scientific principles of designing and selecting the multi-component electrode materials, that account for the electrode space composition, as well as the composition-structure-characteristics relationship of electrode materials on the physical-chemical characteristics of AL and allowing to decrease fragile destruction of electrode material in the total erosion phenomena. 2) &quot;Technological&quot; scheme of AL forming, that accounts for effect of physical-chemical properties of electrodes, parameters of ESA process on physical-chemical and exploitational properties of AL and allowing to receive coatings with given characteristics. According to these principles several new electrode materials have been created, using tungsten carbide and titanium base with self-fluxing and mineral additives that allow to greatly increase wear and heat resistance of construction and instrumental steels.

CHARACTERIZATION OF CONTINUOUS PRODUCTION OF ALUMINUM ALLOYS DURING LINEAR SPRAY ATOMIZATION AND DEPOSITION</B>: Y. Zhou, E.J.

Kozarek, Processing Design and Smelting Division, Aluminum Company of America, Alcoa Center, PA 15069<P>
The linear spray atomization and deposition is a potential near-net shape technique for continuous production of aluminum alloys. Possible benefits of linear spray atomization and deposition are: a) deposit geometry improvement, b) high productivity, c) high aspect ratio, and d) low overspray yield. In the present study, characterization of metal sprays using phase Doppler particle analyzer (PDPA), such as droplet velocity distribution, droplet size, droplet size distribution and spatial distribution, was carried out. The droplet size distribution of aluminum alloy powders were also studied using the mechanical sieving method to compare with the results obtained using PDPA. The plot of the axial velocity with droplet diameter reveals the relationship that smaller droplets have higher axial velocity than do lager droplets. The results also indicate that the axial velocity exhibit the bimodal behavior when atomization pressure approaches a certain critical value and this bimodal behavior behaves increasingly with higher atomization pressure. The Sauter mean diameter obtained using PDPA and the mass median diameter using the mechanical sieving show a decreasing trend with increasing atomization pressure.

The microstructure of spray formed Ti-47Al consists of fine, equiaxed fully lamellar <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/symbols/alpha.gif">2+<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/symbols/gamma.gif"> structure, with an average linear grain size of 60 &#181;m and an average interlamellar spacing of 0.3 &#181;m. These microstructural characteristics led to a higher creep resistance, in a temperature-stress regime of 780 to 850&#176;C and 180 to 320 MPa, relative to fully lamellar <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/symbols/gamma.gif">-TiAl obtained through conventional casting + heat treatment processes. A two dimensional modeling of the momentum and thermal behavior of atomized droplets of <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/symbols/gamma.gif">-TiAl predicted that the two dimensional droplet size distribution in the spray cone changes from being heterogeneous to being almost homogeneous as axial flight distance increases. The modeling results also indicated that the two dimensional distribution of the fraction solidified in the spray cone is heterogeneous. The fraction solidified in the spray at any given axial distance increases with increasing radial distance from the spray axis.

<B>COARSENING KINETICS OF SOLID PARTICLES IN THE SPRAY-FORMED ALUMINUM ALLOY PREFORMS:</B> <I>Ram B. Bhagat, </I>Maurice F. Amateau, The Pennsylvania State University, Applied Research Laboratory, P.O. Box 30, North Antherton Street, State College, PA 16804<P>
The coarsening kinetics of solid particles in the semi-solid aluminum alloys have been reported to follow a parabolic or a cubic law. Considering the gas-dynamic nature of the spray forming process, the high-velocity impact on the substrate is most likely to cause extensive deformation of the semi-solid and even the fully solidified droplets leading to dendrite fragmentation and grain multiplication followed by homogenization and coarsening both during the solidification and subsequent cooling until the temperature falls to a low value. In this investigation, we have developed a growth kinetics relationship based on our experimental results of the heat treatment of select spray-formed aluminum alloys. The calculated rate constant (as a function of temperature) is used in conjunction with a two-dimensional finite element analysis for transient heat transfer to determine the growth of a solid particle in the semi-solid state at any time. The results of this study are useful in understanding the kinetics of grain growth and in obtaining equiaxed, fine-grained microstructures in the aluminum alloys.

THE COMMERCIAL SCALE APPLICATION OF SPRAY FORMED MATERIALS:</B> <I>A.J.W. Ogilvy, </I>A.C. Lealham, Osprey Metals Ltd., UK
<P>
Advanced materials produced by the Osprey Process are satisfying an ever wider range of applications. The driving force for process substitution may be either cost, property improvement or novel materials which are unobtainable using any other production route. This paper will discuss examples of spray-formed materials in the aerospace, automotive, metal processing and electronic industries. In each case, the reasons for the successful commercial application of the materials will be discussed. In addition, details of the requirements for large-scale production of spray-formed alloys and process developments to reduce costs and improve product reproducibility will be given. Post processing of the as-sprayed products to satisfy customer requirements will also be covered.

<B>NAVY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN METAL SPRAY FORMING:</B> <I>Richard Rebis</I>, Materials Engineer, Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division (NSWC-CD), Code 6120, Bethesda, MD 20084-5000; Craig Madden, Director, Manufacturing Programs, NSWC-CD, Code 7206, Bethesda, MD 20084-5000; Patricia Mahoney, Mechanical Engineer, NSWC-CD, Code 7220, Bethesda, MD 20084-5000
<P>
The Metal Spray Forming Technology Group of the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division (NSWC-CD) has conducted research in support of Navy and private industry programs. In the spray forming process, a liquid stream of molten metal is atomized into a spray of semi-solid, semi-liquid particles and the metal spray is subsequently collected onto either a cylindrical or flat substrate that is rotating and translating underneath the spray. Spray forming produces a characteristic fine equiaxed, nearly-full dense microstructure in a near net shape product which can be subsequently processed. NSWC-CD has both non-reactive and reactive metal (titanium) R&amp;D spray forming facilities. The non-reactive facility has a 300 lb. Melt capacity and is used to produce nickel, steel, or copper alloy parts. Over 380 runs have been conducted on this R&amp;D plant since 1988. This facility is also used to produce prototype parts in support of the Navy Manufacturing Technology spray forming plant, which is currently operated by Babcock &amp; Wilcox. In 1995, NSWC-CD installed a Reactive (Titanium) Metal Spray Forming Facility. The facility utilizes cold wall &quot;skull&quot; induction melting to produce up to 75 pounds of molten titanium (7000) cm3, 424 in3) for spray deposition. Recent results from both plants will be presented.

<P>
Plasma Spray Forming is a droplet deposition method which involves the steps of melting, rapid solidification, and consolidation into a single operation. The advancement of technology enables the processing a wide range of metals, intermetallics, and ceramic matrix composites. The advent of Vacuum Plasma Spraying (VPS), which has opened a new dimension in Plasma Spray Forming of these materials, is outlined. The main considerations are being given to fiber reinforced metal matrix composites (MMCs) and ceramic matrix composites for their potential uses in different industrial fields, especially in making automotive engine components like pistons, cylinder liners etc. A brief case study specifically based on its annual production, cost factors, and marketing survey are discussed at length.

THE INFLUENCES OF AGING PRACTICE ON THE MICROSTRUCTURE AND TENSILE PROPERTIES OF SPRAY CAST Al-3Li-1Cu-0.6Mg-0.3Zr ALLOY SHEET</B>: <I>D.L. Yaney</I>, Lockheed Martin Missiles and Space, Palo Alto, CA 94304; D.J. Chellman, Lockheed Martin Aeronautical Systems, Marietta, GA 30063
<P>
A spray cast aluminum-lithium alloy with nominal composition Al-3Li-1Cu-0.6Mg-0.3Zr (wt.%) has been successfully processed into 0.090 in. thick sheet. Following solutionizing at 540&#176; C, selected combinations of quenching, stretching and aging treatments were evaluated in terms of their effect on the tensile properties of the final sheet product. Transmission electron microscopy was used to characterize the microstructural changes introduced by variations in aging practice. Although the maximum attainable yield strength was observed to increase with decreasing aging temperature, the double aging treatment of 3 hours at 170&#176;C followed by 26 hours at 190&#176;C, originally investigated by Gregson and Flower for similar direct chil cast Al-Li alloys, was shown to be effective in minimizing the in plane anisotropy frequently observed in Al-Li-Cu-Mg-Zr sheet products.

PROPERTIES OF SPRAY FORMED NON-HEAT TREATABLE ALUMINUM ALLOYS:</B> <I>M.F. Amateau,</I> H. Patts, T.J. Eden, The Pennsylvania State University, Applied Research Laboratory, P.O. Box 30, North Antherton Street, State College, PA 16804
<P>
Non-heat treatable aluminum alloys rely on a combination of solid solution hardening and plastic deformation to achieve usable strength. The Al-Mn and Al-Mn-Mg alloys (3000 series) are used in applications requiring a high degree of deep drawing capability. Improved formability an drawability require high degree of ductility which depends upon rolling texture, recrystallization texture, grain size uniformity, and grain morphology. Spray metal forming produces a very fine and controlled starting microstructure which can have a profound effect on subsequent mechanical working and heat treatments. DC cast and spray metal formed Al-Mn and Al-Mn-Mg alloys were deformed to various amounts after which, microstructure and crystallographic texture were determined via x-ray diffraction pole figures. Subsequent recrystallization treatments were applied to evaluate the effect of the spray formed microstructure on recrystallization texture, recystallization kinetics, grain size, grain uniformity and mechanical anisotropy.

<P>
Aluminum-silicon alloys, especially hypereutectic silicon compositions are finding increasing use in automotive components that are subjected to sliding contact. Conventional DC casting methods for processing these alloys result in unsuitably large primary silicon particles for subsequent extrusion and forging. Three spray cast hypereutectic aluminum-silicon alloys were processed to various states of extrusion, heat treatment and over aging. Wear measurements have been performed using the pin-on-ring configuration in the unlubricated condition sliding velocities of 4.46 m/s. The ring mating surfaces were grey iron. As cast B390 aluminum alloy was also wear tested for a standard of comparison. The worn surfaces were examined by scanning electron microscopy, electron beam microprobe analysis, and cross section microscopy to determine the nature and mechanism of wear.

<B>THE USE OF TUNGSTEN BORIDE AS POWDER ELECTRODE MATERIAL FOR ELECTRO-SPARK ALLOYING OF STEELS</B>: <I>S.V. Nikolenko</I>, Institute of Material Science, The Far Eastern Branch of Russian Academy of Sciences, Khabarovsk, Russia
<P>
The current development of technology is followed by the more and more complex demands for construction materials. In many cases the use of a combined material that has both the necessary hardness of the base and the high resistance of the outside layer to the environmental factors and wear is most efficient. This can be achieved by applying different kinds of protective coatings. Electro-spark alloying is one of perspective methods of coating deposition. This paper discusses the process of depositing the tungsten boride base composite powder material using a powerful impulse discharge, developed in a semi-closed volume with an electric field, accomplished by interaction of the powder units with the discharge plasma fed into the electrode space in gaseous environment. The process is conducted on a &quot;Rasryad-3A&quot; set, designed for coating with powder electrode materials.

AN INVESTIGATION OF THE CYCLIC FATIGUE AND FRACTURE BEHAVIOR OF SPRAY ATOMIZED AND DEPOSITED ALUMINUM-SILICON ALLOY:</B> S. Anand, T.S. Srivatsan, Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Akron, Akron, OH 44325-3903; E.J. Lavernia, Department of Chemical and Biochemical Engineering and Materials Science, University of California, Irvine, CA 92697
<P>
In this study an Al-17Si-4.5Cu-0.6Mg was synthesized utilizing the spray atomization and co-deposition technique to modify the distribution of the silicon phase in the alloy matrix. Detailed microstructural characterization studies were done using optical and electron microscopy observations with an emphasis on understanding the influence of spray deposition processing on distribution of the silicon phases in the alloy deposition processing on distribution of the silicon phases in the alloy matrix. Specimens of the aluminum alloy were cyclically deformed under stress-amplitude control over a range of amplitudes. The mechanisms and micro-mechanisms governing cyclic stress response and fatigue life of the alloy will be highlighted, compared with a conventional ingot metallurgy processed counterpart, and discussed. The kinetics governing the cyclic deformation characteristics and fracture processes of the spray processed and conventional ingot metallurgy processed alloys will rationalize in light of mutually interactive influences of microstructural effects, nature of loading, matrix deformation characteristics, macroscopic aspects of fracture, and ductility of the material.<BR>

<P>FERROMAGNETIC BULK AMORPHOUS ALLOYS:</B> <I>Akihisa Inoue</I>, Institute for Materials Research, Tohoku University, Katahira 2-1-1, Sendai 980-77, Japan
<P>
Since the discoveries of bulk amorphous alloys in Ln-Al-TM, Mg-Ln-TM and Zr-Al-TM (Ln=lanthanide metal, TM=transition metal) systems for the last several years, great attention has been paid to bulk amorphous alloys. It was subsequently reported that bulk amorphous alloys were formed in Ti-Zr-TM, Zr-Ti-TM-Be and Pd-Ni-Cu-P systems. The maximum thickness reaches 40 mm and the critical cooling rate is of the order of 1K/s. However, there have been no data on bulk amorphous alloys with ferromagnetism at room temperature. We have derived three empirical rules for the achievement of large glass-forming ability from previously reported bulk amorphous alloys. Based on the three rules, we have searched new ferromagnetic bulk amorphous alloys and succeeded in finding several ferromagnetic bulk amorphous alloys in Fe-, Co- and Ln-based systems. The Fe-based bulk amorphous alloys exhibit good soft magnetic properties of 1.3 T for magnetization, 2 A/m for coercive force (Hc), 7000 for permeability at 1 kHz and 21x10-6 for magnetostriction. The Ln-based bulk amorphous alloys were prepared in the diameter range up to 15 mm and exhibited rather good hard magnetic properties of high Hc of 400 kA/m and maximum energy products of 20 kJ/m3. These discoveries seem to be promising for future progress of bulk amorphous alloys.

<P>THERMODYNAMIC AND KINETIC ASPECTS OF BULK METALLIC GLASS FORMING ALLOYS:</B> <I>William L. Johnson</I>, W.M. Keck Laboratory of Engineering Materials 138-78, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA 91125
<P>
The development of several families of multicomponent alloys which 
form metallic glasses at relatively low cooling rates has triggered renewed 
interest in thermodynamic and kinetic properties of undercooled liquid metals as 
well as glass formation. Results of studies of atomic diffusion, viscosity, 
specific heat, liquid phase separation, and crystallization kinetics will be surveyed 
for alloys in the Zr-Ti-Ni-Cu-Be and Zr-Ti-Ni-Cu-Al systems. Containerless 
processing studies of the undercooled melts using electrostatic and 
electromagnetic levitation will be described. Liquid phase separation, impurity 
effects, and heterogeneous crystal nucleation are found to play an important and 
often unanticipated role in the crystallization kinetics. This has led to new 
understanding of the factors which govern glass formation in these bulk 
glass forming materials.

<P>PHASE SEPARATION, CRYSTALLIZATION AND FORMATION OF QUASICRYSTALS IN BULK Zr-BASED AMORPHOUS ALLOYS:</B> <I>Uwe K&ouml;ster</I>, Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Dortmund, D-44221 Dortmund, Germany
<P>
<P>Crystallization occurs by nucleation and growth. Growth may be 
primary, eutectic or polymorphic. Crystallization statistics as performed by TEM 
indicate heterogeneous nucleation with large transient times below the glass 
transition; nucleation and growth rates obey Arrhenius equations with 
activation energies typical for diffusion. Above glass transition homogeneous 
nucleation has been found and kinetics can be described best by 
Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann equations. From Crystallization studies typical 
metal-metalloid glasses are fragile, but the new bulk amorphous alloys are strong 
glasses. Amorphous phase separation prior to crystallization not only increases 
the glass forming ability, but also leads to the formation of nanocrystalline 
structures. Phase separation might be responsible for the strong influence of 
oxygen and hydrogen on the crystallization of Zr-based metallic glasses. 
Some bulk amorphous alloys transform into quasicrystals. Their nucleation 
and growth rates are measured in detail. The relation between glass-forming 
ability, existence of Laves phases and formation of quasicrystals will be discussed.

<P>BULK AMORPHOUS METALLIC ALLOYS: SYNTHESIS BY FLUXING TECHNIQUES AND PROPERTIES:</B> <I>Yi He</I>, Ricardo B. Schwarz, Center for Materials Science, MS-K765, Los Alamos National Laboratory, P.O. Box 1663, Los Alamos, NM 87545
<P>
Fluxing techniques have been used to study the undercooling and vitrification of glass-forming binary, ternary and quaternary alloy melts. By reducing and neutralizing heterogeneous nucleation centers, molten Pd10Fe30Ni40P20 were undercooled to 303 K or 0.26 T<I>m </I>below its melting temperature T<I>m</I>, while bulk amorphous Pd-Ni-P and Pd-Cu-P alloy rods with diameters ranging from 7 to 25 mm were synthesized over a wide composition range. The crystallization temperatures T<I>x </I>and the glass transition temperatures T<I>g </I>of these bulk amorphous alloys were determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). For most bulk amorphous Pd-Ni-P alloys, the difference <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/cap-delta.gif">T=T<I>x</I>-T<I>g</I> is larger than 90 K, and bulk amorphous Pd40Ni40P20 cylinders with 25 mm in diameter can be easily fabricated. <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/cap-delta.gif">T for bulk amorphous Pd-Cu-P alloys is smaller than for amorphous Pd-Ni-P alloys, and exhibits a dependence on the phosphorus concentration which peaks near 20 at.% P. The glass formability of Pd-Cu-P was increased substantially when part of Cu was placed by Ni. Our results demonstrate that the critical cooling rates for glass formation in Pd-Ni-P and Pd-Cu-Ni-P alloys are the lowest among all known bulk metallic glass forming systems. The density, microhardness, elastic properties, specific heat and the glass formation range of these alloys will be reported.

STRUCTURE OF BULK AMORPHOUS ALLOYS DETERMINED BY SYNCHROTRON RADIATION:</B> <I>T. Egami</I>, W.

<P>The atomic structure of Pd-Ni-P bulk amorphous alloys was studied by the anomalous (resonance) x-ray scattering technique using synchrotron radiation tuned near the Pd K-edge. Bulk samples of Pd40Ni40P20, Pd30Ni50P20, and Pd50Ni34P16 amorphous alloys were prepared by the flux method in the form of rods with the diameter of 10-14 mm. X-ray measurements were carried out at the X-7A beamline of the NSLS, Brookhaven National Laboratory. The results show that the structures are basically described by the dense random packed structure with small chemical short-range order. The implication of this result with respect to the stability of the glass will be discussed.

<P>CAN A BULK AMORPHOUS PHASE BE OBTAINED FROM LIQUID SILICON OR GERMANIUM?:</B> <I>Yan Shao</I>, Frans Spaepen, Division of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Pierce Hall, Harvard University, 29 Oxford Street, Cambridge, MA 02138
<P>
<P>A number of methods have been used to undercool liquid silicon and germanium: levitation melting, flux treatments, atomization, rapid cooling following laser melting of thin films, and quenching of droplet dispersions. An amorphous phase has been produced so far only in small volumes. The competition between the kinetics of nucleation and growth of the crystalline and the amorphous phases under these various conditions will be reviewed, and the possibility of obtaining bulk amounts of the amorphous phase will be assessed.

<P>THERMODYNAMIC FRAMEWORK FOR SOLID-STATE AMORPHIZATION:</B> <I>D. Wolf</I>, Materials Science Division (MSD-212), Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL 60439
<P>
Atomistic computer simulations are used to expose important thermodynamic parallels between melting and solid-state amorphization and the important role of nanocrystalline microstructures. Molecular-dynamics simulations demonstrate that every crystal can, in principle, melt by two entirely different causes and underlying mechanisms; a comparison with experiments suggests that both can be operative in solid-state amorphization1. Also, simulations of a model nanocrystalline material exhibit the existence of low- and high-frequency lattice-vibrational modes not seen in the perfect crystal but also present in the amorphous phase2. The possibility of a reversible, free-energy based transition between these two metastable phases that is governed by a critical grain size is discussed together with possible mechanisms for the transition.

<P>
The magnitude and temperature dependence of the liquid state shear modulus G, specific heat Cp, diffusivity D and viscosity <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/eta.gif"> are all closely related, according to the interstitialcy model. It has been proposed by Dyne, Olsen and Christensen that the viscosity is given by <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/eta.gif">=h0exp(F/kT) where h0 is a reference viscosity and F is given by the work required to shove aside neighboring particles in a diffusion process, where F=GVc and Vc is a characteristic volume. In the interstitialcy model, the high frequency thermodynamic liquid state shear modulus is given by G(T)=G0exp[(-<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">(T-T0)], where G0 is the shear modulus at a reference temperature T0 which can be taken as the glass temperature. The resulting non-Arrhenius behavior of the viscosity is compared with experimental data for the shear modulus.

COMPUTER SIMULATIONS OF THE STRUCTURAL, DYNAMIC, ELECTRONIC AND MAGNETIC PROPERTIES OF AMORPHOUS ALLOYS: </B> <I>J. Hafner</I>, Institut f&uuml;r Theoretische Physik, Technische Universit&auml;t Wien, Wiedner Haupstrasse 8-10/136, A-1040 Wien, Austria<P>
There is hardly any area in materials science where the necessity to supplement the experimental information acquired in the laboratory by the results of computer experiments is felt as urgently than for liquid and amorphous materials. The classical example is the structure: whereas laboratory experiments describe a one-dimensional projection of the three-dimensional structure, the computer-simulation delivers the full set of the atomic coordinates. During the last years, a wide variety of computational tools have been developed. These techniques can essentially be classified in three groups: (a) <I>Ab initio local-density functional techniques</I> in the spirit of the Car-Parrinello method. While in this approach no further assumption beyond the reduction of the many-electron Hamiltonian to an effective one-electron form is required, the massive computational effort restricts the application to models with at most a few hundred inequivalent atomic sites. (b) A variety of <I>tight-binding (TB)</I> based techniques (ranging from TB molecular dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC) to tight-binding-bond approaches to many-atom forces) allow to treat larger systems, albeit at lower accuracy. (c) Classical MD and MC based on <I>effective interatomic pair and volume forces</I> derived via effective-medium approximations, pseudo-potential theory, TB-moment expansions...etc. In this talk I shall attempt to review the state-of-the-art of the computer-modeling of the structural, dynamic, electronic and magnetic properties of amorphous alloys.

AB INITIO STUDIES OF THE ELECTRONIC STRUCTURE AND ENERGETICS OF BULK AMORPHOUS ALLOYS:</B> <I>G.M. Stocks</I>, D.M.C. Nicholson, Y. Wang, X.-D. Wang, C.L. Fu, W.A.

We present results of first-principles LDA calculations of the electronic structure and energetics of Ni40Pd40P20 and Zr60Al15Ni25 bulk amorphous alloys based on large unit cell (about 300 atoms) structural models of the amorphous state. The calculations are made tractable by the order-N locally self-consistent multiple scattering (LSMS) method implemented on massively parallel computers. For the Zr2Ni-based system, we have also studied the energetics and bonding of some competing stable and metastable ordered phases into which the amorphous state decomposes. The implications of these calculations for understanding the unusual stability of bulk amorphous alloys will be stressed.

ELECTRONIC STRUCTURE AND RELATED PROPERTIES OF METALLIC GLASSES: LINEAR MUFFIN-TIN ORBITALS CALCULATIONS: </B> <I> S.K. Bose</I>, Physics Department, Brock University, St. Catharines, Ontario L2S 3A1, Canada<P>
We describe various aspects of electronic structure calculation for metallic glasses using the Linear Muffin-Tin Orbitals (LMTO) scheme. A method of calculating the electronic transport properties based on the LMTO-recursion method and the Kubo-Greenwood formula is discussed. The practical limitations of the method and the ways to overcome them are presented. We discuss calculations of the magnetic properties within the framework of multiple scattering formalism assuming collinear magnetic structure and using the Linear Muffin-Tin Orbitals Green's Function (LMTO-GF) method. Results for the effective exchange coupling parameters and local magnetic moments for amorphous Fe and Co are discussed with special emphasis on the dependence of these quantities on the local and global features of the structure. A simple interpolation scheme, based on the electronic properties of the pure components, is proposed for estimating the spin fluctuation effects in transition metal glasses.

REAL-SPACE ELECTRONIC STRUCTURE APPROACH TO CHEMICAL ORDER IN AMORPHOUS ALLOYS:</B> <I>P.E.A. Turchi</I>, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (L-268), P.O. Box 808, Livermore CA 94551; D. MAYOU, LEPES-CNRS, 25 Avenue des Martyrs, BP 166, F-38042 Grenoble Cedex 9, France<P>
A recently developed real-space approach for studying the electronic structure properties of materials which exhibit both chemical and topological disorders is presented, within the tight-binding framework. For a chemically random alloy, we show that the Coherent Potential Approximation (CPA) equations can be solved self-consistently in real-space with the same accuracy as is currently done in reciprocal space, in the case of homogeneous and inhomogeneous systems. Based on the orbital peeling technique, effective on-site and many-body interactions which build up the configurational part of the total energy are computed. With this energetics, Monte Carlo simulations based on the Kawasaki spin-exchange dynamics are performed to predict chemical short-range order in amorphous alloys. The relaxation of the lattice is performed with TB-molecular dynamics simulations, and the overall scheme can be reiterated to self-consistency. Advantages of this global scheme are discussed and application to Zr-Ni alloys are presented. Work performed under the auspices of the U. S. Department of Energy by the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under contract No. W-7405-ENG-48. Partial support from NATO under contract CRG 941028 is gratefully acknowledged.

FREE VOLUME, PERCOLATION, AND GLASS TRANSITIONS: </B> <I>Mo Li</I>, W.M. Keck Laboratory of Engineering Materials 138-78, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA 91125<P>
Free volume model is examined systematically and quantitatively in a model binary liquid using molecular dynamics simulations. It is found that at the glass transition, the liquid-like cells undergo a percolation transition. However, further analysis shows that free volumes do not exhibit any cooperative behavior at the percolation threshold. The continuous change in thermodynamic and transport properties suggests that the glass transition is kinetic in nature. Implication of the percolating properties of the free volumes in transport properties of undercooled liquids will also be discussed.

Macroscopic mechanical properties of materials arise from cooperative dynamics of atoms. However, it is difficult to detect the atomistic dynamical behavior by <I>in situ</I> experiment. We performed a large scale molecular dynamics simulation to study the deformation and fracture processes in Zr-Ni amorphous alloy. Finnis-Sinclair type pair functional potentials is used. Uni-axial strain is applied for a nano-size rod with constant strain rate at various temperatures. Tensile processes are traced by checking the internal energy and by the snapshots for atom configuration. The discrete atomic model reproduces the behavior of the continuum matter. The correlation between the inhomogeneous atom configuration and atomic level stress is analyzed.

METASTABILITY AND PROPERTIES OF METALLIC BULK GLASS FORMING ALLOYS:</B> <I>Hans J. Fecht</I>, Institute of Metallic Materials, Technical University Berlin, Hardenbergstrasse 36, PN 2-3, D-10623 Berlin, Germany
<P>
The absence of crystallization over a wide time/temperature window can be utilized to produce bulk metallic glass by relatively slow cooling of the melt. For a number of alloys including the multicomponent Pd-Ni-P, Au-Pb-Sb, Zr-Cu-Ni-Al, and Zr-Ti-Ni-Cu-Be alloys the relevant thermodynamic and thermomechanical properties of the metastable glassy and undercooled liquid states have been measured below and above the glass transition temperature. These measurements include specific heat, viscosity, density and elastic properties as functions of temperature. As a result it becomes obvious that the maximum undercooling for these alloys is given by an isentropic condition before an enthalpic or isochoric instability is reached. Alternatively, these glasses can also be produced by mechanical alloying, thus replacing the thermal disorder by static disorder and resulting in the same thermodynamic glass state. For the &quot;weaker&quot; glasses the isentropic instability also coincides with a divergence of the viscosity. During heating through the undercooled liquid a nanoscale phase separation occurs for most glasses as a precursor of crystallization. Further measurements of the mechanical and tribological wear properties point to the unique engineering applications of this new class of advanced materials.

Recent studies indicate that moisture-induced hydrogen embrittlement is a major cause of low ductility and brittle fracture of many intermetallic alloys in moist air at ambient temperature. This embrittlement involves the reaction of reactive elements in intermetallic alloys with the moisture in air and the generation of atomic hydrogen which penetrates into crack tip and causes loss of tensile ductility. In the current study, bulk amorphous alloys based on Zr-Al-Ti-Cu-Ni were tested in tension at room temperature in various environments. Preliminary results indicate that the tensile fracture strength of about 1400 MPa is not strongly affected by test environments. These results alone do not rule out the possibility that these amorphous alloys may react with moisture during tensile testing. Additional work involving laser desorption spectroscopy will be conducted in order to detect this reaction.

SEEBECK PHENOMENON ON AMORPHOUS-CRYSTALLINE INTERFACE AND AMORPHOUS-CRYSTALLINE THERMOCOUPLE:</B> <I>Mikhail V.

Chen, Mechanical Engineering Department, Temple University, 12th &amp; Norris Street, Philadelphia, PA 19122
<P>
Thermo-electric Seebeck phenomenon on amorphous-crystalline interface in several alloys is studied. The thermocouples, consisting of amorphous and crystalline parts of the same alloy are proposed and investigated. The amorphous-crystalline transition zone formed by heating of amorphous alloys in heterogeneous temperature field serves as a hot junction. It is shown that this zone could be made as narrow as 10-100 mm. Thermo-Electric Moving Force (TEMF) for thermocouples made from Fe-B, Ni-Fe-Si-B, and Co-Fe-Si-B alloys was measured. TEMF of thermocouple made from Co-Fe-Si-B alloy in its as-cast condition can achieve 8.1 &#181;V/K, and it is constant in the range 293K to 593K. It is shown that relaxation of the amorphous structure affects the TEMF of amorphous-crystalline thermocouple. (Patent is applied)

THEORETICAL CALCULATIONS FOR INTERFACES: GRAIN BOUNDARIES IN COVALENT MATERIALS AND METAL-CERAMIC INTERFACES:</B> <I>Masanori Kohyama</I>, Dept. of Material Physics, Osaka National Research Institute, AIST, 1-8-31, Midorigaoka, Ikeda, Osaka, 563, Japan
<P>
For distorted configurations at interfaces in covalent materials or for interfaces between dissimilar materials, it is difficult to develop reliable interatomic potentials. For such systems, it is desirable to perform electronic structure calculations so as to clarify the stable configurations and microscopic nature. Currently, such kinds of enormous calculations are becoming possible by virtue of the development of the efficient theoretical methods and the high-performance computers. In this paper, we present our recent band-theoretical calculations for grain boundaries in Si, SiC and diamond, and for Al-SiC interfaces. First, grain boundaries in covalent materials have been dealt with by using the transferable tight-binding method [1]. For those in Si, general features of stable configurations and general relations between local structural disorder and local electronic structure are clarified. These are compared with those in diamond. For those in SiC, effects of interfacial C-C or Si-Si bonds and interfacial stoichiometry are analyzed. Second, <I>ab initio</I> calculations for grain boundaries in Si and in SiC have been performed by using the first-principles molecular dynamics (FPMD) method [2]. Stability of the structural models and the nature of interfacial C-C and Si-Si bonds in SiC are analyzed more quantitatively. Third, <I>ab initio</I> calculations for Al-SiC interfaces have been investigated [3]. The features of Al-C and Al-Si interactions at the interfaces are clarified.

The microstructure of nearly stoichiometric TiAl alloys, which are important candidates for high-temperature applications, consists of lamellae with L10 and DO19 structures. A serious limitation is their low room temperature ductility. The failure often occurs by cracking along the lamellar interfaces and one clue to the fracture propensity is the atomic structure of these interfaces. To investigate this atomic structure we first carried out atomistic calculations employing Finnis-Sinclair type central force many-body potentials. However, calculated atomic structures exhibit some significant discrepancies when compared with high-resolution electron microscopy observations. For this reason further calculations have been made using an ab initio electronic structure full-potential method. An excellent agreement between calculated and observed structures was then attained. This result can be interpreted in terms of the covalent type bonding across the interface. This emphasizes significance of directional bonding in TiAl which may play an important role in its mechanical behavior. *Research supported by the U.S. Dept. of Energy, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Grant No. DE-FG02-87ER45295 and NEDO.

<P>ATOMISTIC STUDY OF GRAIN BOUNDARIES IN NiAl:</B> <I>M. Yan</I>, V. Vitek, S.P. Chen, Theoretical Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM 87545; Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104
<P>
We have studied the grain boundary properties in NiAl B2 compound by applying the empirical N-body central force potentials of the Finnis-Sinclair type. These potentials have been constructed for B2 NiAl by fitting a number of equilibrium properties of the alloy and reproducing the asymmetric behavior of constitutionals point defects in off-stoichiometric NiAl. At the same time, these potentials assure the structural and mechanical stability of the B2 lattice. It was found that in stoichiometric NiAl alloy boundaries in surplus of Al atoms have appreciably lower cohesive strength than the stoichiometric boundaries or boundaries in surplus of Ni atoms. From the structural point of view, boundaries in surplus of Al possess the largest expansion and are associated with large &quot;holes&quot;. On the other hand, boundaries with the stoichiometric configuration or in surplus of Ni atoms have more compact structures. The segregation of the antisite defects and vacancies at grain boundaries was also investigated by performing molecular static and Monte Carlo calculations. It was found that no antisite defects are favored at grain boundaries at the stoichiometric bulk composition. In the case of Ni in surplus in the bulk Al atoms have strong tendency to segregate to the boundary region. The effects of such grain boundary features upon the mechanical properties of NiAl will be discussed.

<P>GRAIN BOUNDARY STRUCTURE TRENDS IN B2 COMPOUNDS</B>: Batsirai Mutasa, Diana Farkas, Yuri Mishin, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA 24061
<P>
The relaxed atomistic grain boundary structures in B2 aluminides were investigated using molecular statics and embedded atom potentials in order to explore general trends for a series of B2 compounds. Free surface energies and grain boundary structures were studied in three compounds, FeAl, NiAl and CoAl. These alloys respectively have increasing anti-phase boundary energies. The misorientations chosen for detailed study correspond to the <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/cap-sigma.gif">5(310) and <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/cap-sigma.gif">5(210) boundaries. The effects of both boundary stoichiometry and simulation block stoichiometry on grain boundary energetics were considered. Chemical potentials and point defect energies were calculated for boundaries contained in both stoichiometric and off-stoichiometric bulks. The surface energies for these B2 aluminides were also calculated so that trends concerning the cohesive energy of the boundaries could be studied. The implications of stoiciometry, the multiplicity of the boundary structures and possible transformations between them for grain boundary brittleness are also discussed.

When two crystals are in contact, the interaction between the atoms at or near their interface often orients the crystals in a unique way. Usually, one of the two crystals is a matrix or a substrate, and the other crystal is a precipitate within the matrix, or a deposit on the substrate. In this talk, a recently-proposed method for predicting the orientation relationship (OR) between two crystals is described and experimental cases of film/substrate composites are compared with the predictions of the model. The case of three-dimensional OR, where the film-substrate orientation relationship is maintained irrespective of the substrate surface on which the film is grown, is described, and this is compared with those cases where multiple ORs may be favored resulting on the dependence of the OR on the substrate surface. Finally, the physical basis of the model is described in terms of the energy minimization of adatoms deposited on a rigid substrate.

We are investigating Al/Al2O3 interface structure using thin films fabricated by deposition of aluminum from an effusion source onto (0001) sapphire under UHV conditions. Structural considerations suggest that the metal would grow to match the close-packed metal planes and directions with the close-packed oxygen ions of the sapphire substrate, i.e., (0001)Al2O3//(111) metal and [10-10]Al2O3//[-110]metal. Although this orientation is predominant, transmission electron microscopy observations also show the existence of two additional types of orientation relationship, corresponding to rotations of 30 degrees and ~11 degrees from the primary domain orientation. A comparison of the predictions of atomistic calculations for the interface structure and dislocation configuration with the results of high resolution and conventional transmission electron microscopy observations will be presented.

Grain boundary embrittlement by impurity or alloying elements is a common and technologically important phenomenon, of which the embrittlement of Cu by Bi is a classic example. Investigations, using the near edge fine structure in the electron energy loss spectrum (EELS), have indicated that there is a change in bonding at the grain boundaries associated with the segregation of Bi. Namely, there is a decrease in the density of the d states for Cu atoms at the boundary when Bi is present. The effect of variations in grain boundary misorientation on the Bi segregation levels and on the near edge structure will be described. Comparisons between results from EELS and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) will also be made. (Supported by NSF) (DMR 93-0625).

<P>The mobility of high-angle grain boundaries and triple junctions is the key factor, which controls the recrystallizations and grain growth processes. The mobility of individual &lt;111&gt; tilt grain boundaries in Al was measured under the constant driving force, <I>in-situ</I>, over a wide range of temperatures, in the vicinity of special misorientation and away from it, in ultra-pure Al and in Al doped with small amount of soluble impurities. The steady state motion of grain boundary systems with triple junctions was investigated <I>in</I>-situ at different temperatures on tricrystals of Zn. A transition of the steady state motion of the grain boundary system with triple junction from junction kinetics to grain boundary kinetics was observed. For the first time it was shown that triple junctions are able to drag grain boundary motion. The grain structure evolution in polycrystals for different kinds of kinetics will be discussed.

<P>
<P>Two dimensional molecular dynamics simulations of grain boundary migration are performed using the half-loop bicrystal geometry employed in the experiments performed by Shvindlerman, et al. We examine the dependence of the <U>steady</U> <U>state</U> grain boundary velocity on grain boundary curvature by varying the half-loop width at constant temperature. The grain boundary velocity is proportional to the half-loop curvature and the grain boundary mobility follows an Arrhenius relationship. In the present study, we examine grain boundary migration for several different grain misorientations. We employ movies of these simulation in order to deduce the dominant mechanisms of grain boundary migration and how these mechanisms depend on grain boundary structure.

<P>
<P>The sliding of grain boundaries can be influenced by the presence of solute segregants. Additionally, the sliding mechanism itself also triggers vacancy fluxes that may result in the non-equilibrium redistribution of solute atoms at boundaries and triple points. The interaction of these two processes have been studied in Al Mg-Mn based systems with and without additions of Sn, an equilibrium segregant. Fine-grained structures have been produced and samples tested under conditions that induce grain boundary sliding (GBS). The presence of Sn on the boundaries before deformation allows easier GBS with lower cavitation. High-resolution grain boundary composition measurements on deformed samples revealed that the Sn remains on the boundary during GBS but the Mg is redistributed in a heterogeneous manner. The points to the possibility of engineering the grain boundary composition for optimized deformation characteristics and post-formed properties such as stress corrosion cracking resistance.

<P>Our research on ceramic/metal (C/M) interfaces that utilizes transmission electron, high-resolution electron, Z-contrast microscopy, and atom-probe microscopies, in collaboration with <I>ab initio</I> atomistic modeling, is presented. Heavy use is made of atom-probe microscopy to address questions concerning the chemistry of the terminating plane and segregation of solute species to the ceramic/metal interfacial region. Detailed results are presented for the {222} MgO/Cu, {222} CdO/Ag, {222} MgO/Cu(Ag), and {222} CdO/Ag(Au) interfaces. All the C/M interfaces were created via internal oxidation, at elevated temperatures, of high-purity binary or ternary metallic alloys, thereby producing atomically clean interfaces. Solute-atom segregation was induced at the {222} C/M interfaces by annealing specimens containing a ternary addition at 500&#176;C for prolonged periods of time. The level of segregation, i.e., the Gibbsian interfacial excess, is determined directly by the atom-probe technique. Results concerning <I>ab initio</I> atomistic modeling of the {222} MgO/Cu coherent interface (zero-misfit approximation), using local density functional theory (LDFT) within the plane-wave pseudopotential framework, are presented for two polar {111} and two nonpolar {100} MgO/Cu and CdO/Ag interfaces and are discussed with respect to our experimental observations.

<P>
<P>Two kinetic processes associated with grain boundaries are discussed. In the first study, we examine quantitatively the impact of heterogeneous nucleation on the temporal evolution of a phase transformation with particular emphasis on the correlation of nucleation site distribution and product phase microstructure. This is accomplished by investigating spatial correlations in the transforming system via the calculation of nonequilibrium correlation functions and by characterizing product grain sizes and shapes. Computer simulations of transformations are employed in order to validate our theoretical description and to relate microstructural features of the evolving phase to relevant length and time scales in the problem. In the second study, we investigate the kinetics of grain boundary diffusion using a spatially inhomegeneous lattice gasmodel. It is found that atomic transport can be accurately described by a series of approximate rate equations and that one can ascribe a bias, in a certain sense, to tagged atoms.

<P>
Nonequilibrium microchemistries develop at irradiated interfaces in alloys. The driving force for the radiation-induced segregation is the flow of radiation produced defects to internal interfaces. A unique feature of these segregation profiles is the narrow nanometer dimension near grain boundaries. Theoretical predictions and analytical measurements indicate that nonequilibrium composition gradients normal to grain boundaries are in excess of 106 atom fraction/cm. Fast arrival rates of radiation-produced point defects create potential influences on grain boundary structure and dynamics. Conventional theories assume that dominant mutual recombination of grain boundary defects prevents their influence on boundaries. In the present paper, the dynamics of defect arrival and annihilation are examined in relation to extreme nonequilibrium conditions at internal interfaces.

TEMPERATURE AND CONCENTRATION DEPENDENCE OF GRAIN BOUNDARY-DIFFUSION OF 63Ni IN PURE AND BORON-DOPED Ni3Al:</B> <I>Stefan Frank</I>, J&ouml;rg R&uuml;sing and Christian Herzig, Institut f&uuml;r Metallforschung, Universit&auml;t M&uuml;nster, Germany, now: Hahn-Meitner-Institut, Berlin, Germany
<P>
Knowledge about the diffusion behaviour in the grain boundaries of pure and of boron-doped Ni3Al is of basic importance to improve our understanding of the boron-effect and the mechanical properties of polycrystalline Ni3Al. We report on a first study of grain boundary diffusion in pure and doped Ni-rich Ni3Al polycrystals. Diffusion penetration profiles were determined by a serial sectioning technique using a precision parallel grinding device. The low energy <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/beta.gif">-decays of the 63Ni tracer were detected by liquid scintillation counting. The high efficiency allowed to significantly increase the detectable concentration range of the measured profiles and provided the basis for investigating grain boundary self-diffusion in Ni3Al in a meaningful way. For comparison grain boundary self-diffusion in pure Ni was re-investigated in true type R-kinetic. It is known that the temperature dependence of the grain boundary diffusion parameter P=<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/delta.gif">Dgb of 63Ni in pure Ni and in both Ni3Al materials is of the Arrhenius type. The absolute values of P follow the sequence P Ni&gt;P Ni3Al&gt;P Ni3Al+B. The remarkably higher activation enthalpy Qgb (Ni3Al) in comparison with Qgh (Ni) can be attributed to the grain boundary structure of the strongly ordered Ni3Al compound. Ni-diffusivity in the doped alloy is about 2-3 times lower than in pure Ni3Al. A prospective reason for the decreased diffusivity is the segregation of B and the thereby enhanced cosegregation of Ni in the grain boundaries. The strong segregation of boron leads to a certain blocking of diffusion paths of the Ni atoms. High angle grain boundary energies in pure and R-doped Ni3Al are derived from the diffusion data applying the Borisov et al.relation. The effect of stoichiometry on grain boundary self-diffusion in Ni3Al was investigated for compositions between 73 and 78 at% Ni. A V-shaped concentration dependence of P with a minimum at near 75 at% Ni was observed which becomes very distinct at lower temperatures. At e.g. 1066 K P increases by about one order of magnitude from stoichiometric to Ni-rich Ni3Al. This behaviour is related to the change in composition and state of order of grain boundaries in non stoichiometric Ni3Al.

CALCULATIONS OF DIFFUSION AND SEGREGATION IN Al-Cu GRAIN-BOUNDARIES:</B> <I>X.Y. Liu</I>, J.B. Adams, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 105 South Goodwin Avenue, Urbana, IL 61801; Wei Xu, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, University of California, Livermore, CA 94551<P>
We have studied the atomistic mechanisms of electromigration in Al-Cu, in specific, the diffusion of atoms and segregation of Cu atoms in the Al grain-boundaries with a newly developed EAM interatomic potential constructed by the Force-Matching Method. The potential parameters are fitted to available experimental data plus <I>ab initio</I> force database. The energetic and structural properties of Cu segregation and the effect in atomic diffusion path and activation barriers are studied. The grain-boundary calculations, in agreement with <I>ab initio</I> results, show that the Cu segregation is dominated by size effects in the Al-Cu system, i.e., Cu atoms segregate to sites which are locally compressed. In the case of a <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/cap-sigma.gif"> 11 tilt boundary, this predicts that the Cu will segregate to sites away from the symmetric center of the boundary.

ATOMISTIC SIMULATION OF GRAIN BOUNDARY STRUCTURE AND DIFFUSION IN B2 NiAl:</B> <I> Yuri Mishin, </I>Diana Farkas, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Materials Science and Engineering Department, Blacksburg, VA 24061<P>

We modify the existing embedded-atom potentials for NiAl by fitting them to self-diffusion data for pure Ni and Al and to the triple-defect model for this compound. Using the modified potentials and molecular statics we calculate the structure, excess energy and cohesive energy of [001] tilt grain boundaries in NiAl. The calculations are performed for 25 orientations with $\Sigma$ values from 5 to 185. For each orientation the lowest-energy stoichiometric boundary structure is established. Low-$\Sigma$ orientations are associated with minima of the boundary energy and maxima of the cohesive energy. The boundary structures obtained are analyzed in terms of the structural unit model. For two lowest-energy boundaries, $\Sigma=5$ (210) and $\Sigma=13$ (230), we simulate tracer self-diffusion in the boundary core both parallel and normal to the tilt axis. We assume the vacancy mechanism and calculate the vacancy formation and migration energies in the boundary core. To calculate the boundary diffusion coefficients we use the technique proposed recently by one of us [Phil. Mag. A 72, 1589 (1995)]. This technique combines the matrix method with Monte Carlo simulations of individual vacancy-tracer encounters. The effective activation energy is calculated in a wide temperature range and compared with the spectrum of individual jump energies in the boundary. The results are discussed in terms of the grain boundary mass transport and its effect on high temperature properties of NiA.

THE IVANTSOV GROWTH EQUATION AND INTERFACIAL KINETICS:</B> <I>Zi-Kui Liu</I>, Y. Austin Chang, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, 1509 University Avenue, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI 53706<P>
The growth equation of parabloid was first derived by Ivantsov1 and later modified by Trivedi2 to take into account the interfacial energy and finite interfacial mobility (interfacial kinetics). The modification was done by first considering the effects of the interfacial kinetics and the interfacial energy and curvature, and then solving the diffusion equations on the composition at the interface. Though the modification was necessary, the growth equation was much more complicated that the original Ivantsov equation. In a recent publication by us, the advantage of the modern development of computational thermodynamics was taken and the Ivantsov equation was then used directly with the actual composition after taking into account the interfacial energy and the finite interfacial mobility. It was pointed out by a reviewer that this approach was not self evident if it is identical to Trivedi's modification. In the present report, we will formulate a consistent framework to describe the phenomena.

MICROSTRUCTURAL CHARACTERIZATION OF TiAl3 PRODUCT LAYERS IN AlCuSi/Ti AND AlCu/Ti REACTION COUPLES:</B> <I>C. Wauchope</I>, J.E. Sanchez, Jr., University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109; P.R. Besser, R. Alvis, Advanced Micro Devices, Sunnyvale, CA 94088<P>
Metallization interconnects in advanced integrated circuits are typically fabricated from Al alloy (500-1000nm)/Ti (20-50nm) multilayer thin films. The Ti provides several effects in the Al layer; improved reliability against electromigration-induced failure, reduced Al grain size, increased Al (111) fiber texture, and reduced Al thickness due to Ti+Al reaction to form TiAl3. The TiAl3 reaction occurs during thermal processing and device fabrication, and leads to increased line resistance as the Al thickness is reduced. We present detailed cross-section transmission electron microscopic analysis of TiAl3 layers formed in AlCuSi/Ti and AlCu/Ti reaction couples. Results show that the Al alloy/TiAl3 and TiAl3/Ti interfaces are &quot;clean&quot; and free of intermediate phase layers. In addition local energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analyses show Si partitioning in the TiAl3 region in AlCuSi/Ti samples. The TiAl3 grain size is roughly independent of Al alloy type, and depends primarily on total TiAl3 thickness. These results are described in terms of models which describe the effects of Cu and Si alloying additions on the TiAl3 formation kinetics, in particular to the Ti+Al reaction rate dependence on the Ti/AlCuSi thickness ratio.

STRUCTURE, COMPOSITION AND THERMAL STABILITY OF METAL/CERAMIC INTERFACES:</B> <I>Manfred R&uuml;hle</I>, Max-Planck-Institut f&uuml;r Metallforschung, Seestr. 92, D-70174 Stuttgart, Germany<P>
Metal/ceramic interfaces play a crucial role in different areas of materials science such as metallic interconnects in semiconductors, adhesion of oxide scales on metal substrates, thermal barrier coating, composites and bonding between bulk parts of metals and ceramics. It is of great interest to correlate the microstructure of those interfaces to their properties. The possibilities of getting information on the structure and composition of metal/ceramic interfaces will be discussed for several systems. The focus will be mainly on model systems (Cu/Al2O3, Ni/Al2O3, Nb/Al2O3) but also applications for real materials will be discussed. Segregation of impurities may lead either to an increase or decrease of the adhesion. Therefore, it is crucial to determine those impurities as accurately as possible. Metal/ceramic interfaces are often exposed to high temperatures at different atmospheres. Therefore, the thermal stability under service conditions is of great interest. The paper will describe recent advances and possibilities of determining the structure, composition and chemical reactions at those interfaces by conventional transmission electron microscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and analytical electron microscopy. The results of experimental studies will be compared to results of <I>ab-initio</I> first principles calculations and to experimental studies on the adhesion of metal films on ceramic substrates.

THE Al/Ni AND Al/Cu INTERFACIAL REACTIONS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF ELECTRIC CURRENT:</B> Wen-Chyuarn Liu, <I>Sinn-wen Chen</I>, Department of Chemical Engineering, National Tsing-Hua University, Hsin-Chu, Taiwan 30043, China<P>
Electromigration has been observed and quite extensively investigated in the integrated circuit devices with the electric current density higher than 105 A/cm2. The electric current density in the electronic packaging was usually lower and the effect of electromigration has not been discussed. This study investigated the effect of weaker electric current, up to 103 A/cm2, upon the chemically-driven interfacial reactions in the Al/Ni and Al/Cu systems by analyzing their reaction couples. The reaction couples would be heated by the passing-through electric current. The temperatures of the reaction couples increased with the increasing electric density. Annealed at the same temperatures, similar results were found for the reaction couples with and without the passing-through electric current. Same intermetallics, such as Al3Ni and Al3Ni2, were formed at the interfaces, and the thickness of the reaction layers was the same. It was concluded that the electric current density up to 103 A/cm2 has little effect upon the interfacial reactions in the Al/Ni and Al/Cu systems.

INFLUENCE OF THE CRYSTALLOGRAPHIC PARAMETERS OF GRAIN BOUNDARIES ON THEIR ENERGETIC, KINETIC AND CHEMICAL PROPERTIES:</B> <I>E. Rabkin</I>, Wolfgang Gust, Max-Planck-Institut f&uuml;r Metallforschung and Institut f&uuml;r Metallkunde, Seestr. 75, D-70174 Stuttgart, Germany
<P>
We review the recent experimental data about the dependence of the grain boundary (GB) energy on the misorientation of adjacent grains and on the inclination of the GB plane. The relationship between inclination dependence of the GB energy and the morphology of faccted twin Gbs in Cu and Ag is demonstrated. The kinetics of development of the faccted morphology at the originally flat twin GB in Cu is studied experimentally. The strong influence of small additions of Bi on the chemical compositions of Gbs in Cu is shown. The effect of atomic ordering on the GB energy is considered. The discontinuous ordering reaction in Fe-50 at.% Co alloy in combination with the analysis of the electron backscattered Kikuchi patterns is used to study the atomic mobility in Gbs in the ordered B2 alloy. It is shown that the low energy special Gbs exhibit also the decreased atomic mobility.

THE EFFECTS OF GRAIN BOUNDARY MISORIENTATION ON M23C6 PRECIPITATION AND SENSITIZATION IN 304 STAINLESS STEEL:</B> <I>Elizabeth Trillo</I>, L.E. Murr, Department of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering, The University of Texas at El Paso, El Paso, TX 79968
<P>
The correlation between grain boundary misorientation and energy has been the subject of study even before Stickler and Vinckier (in 1963) demonstrated that sensitization behavior is related to the energy of different types of individual boundaries in the sensitizing temperature range of 500-850&#176;C. This research goes beyond these types of studies by attempting to uncover the role of grain boundary misorientation on M23C6 precipitation behavior in 304 stainless steel. The four materials utilizaed in this study having differing carbon contents (0.01, 0.025, 0.05, 0.07%C) and were heat treated at 670&#176;C for 10 and 50 hours. In addition, the 10 hour samples were deformed (0, 10, and 20% true strain) to observe simultaneous strain effects. Electrochemical Potentiostatic Reactivation (EPR) tests were performed to characterize the sensitization behavior, and the precipitation behavior was observed through the transmission electron microscope (TEM) at 200kV. A &quot;critical nucleation energy&quot; was found to be in the range of 16 mJ/m2 to 265 mJ/m2 which corresponds to the energies of special boundaries, no precipitation was observed on coherent twin boundaries (#16 mJ/m2). This research supported in part by the Patricia Roberts Harris Fellowship.

GRAIN BOUNDARY SEGREGATION AND PRECIPITATION EFFECTS ON ENVIRONMENT-INDUCED CRACKING:</B> <I>S.M. Bruemmer</I>, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, P.O. Box 999, Richland, WA
<P>
Environment-induced cracking at internal interfaces has long been explained due to local chemistry differences. Widespread use of high resolution analytical techniques (analytical transmission electron microscopy and scanning Auger microscopy) has recently &quot;quantified&quot; this effect by direct correlation's between grain boundary composition and intergranular failure. Examples of this quantification will be presented and critical interfacial compositions identified for various metallic alloys. material susceptibility can often be minimized by controlling segregation and precipitation characteristics at grain boundaries. Compositional anisotropy among internal interfaces, and its effect on cracking, will also be demonstrated and discussed.

Ni-Cr-Fe Alloy (UNS N06690) is being widely used as corrosion resistant tubing material in nuclear power plants and believed beneficial to stress corrosion resistance to have intergranular chromium carbide precipitates (semi-continuously or continuously). Alloys were prepared through VIM and ESR and tubular products were fabricated by pilgering process. Several solution heat treatments were conducted at a relatively rapid heating and cooling rate. Selective precipitation of chromium carbide along grain boundary was observed in this alloy. Even along a single grain boundary carbide precipitates were revealed as very discretely distributed in association with twins. Distribution and orientation relationship of precipitates with grain boundary in association with twins were analyzed through electron microscopy and explained with CSL model.

ATOMISTIC STUDIES OF SOLUTE-ATOM SEGREGATION AT GRAIN BOUNDARIES IN METALS: SIMULATION AND EXPERIMENTS:</B> <I>David N. Seidman</I>, Northwestern University, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Evanston, IL 60208-3108
<P>
I review our studies of the relationship between the atomic structure of grain boundaries (GB) and solute-segregation in binary metallic alloys. The principal experimental tool utilized to measure segregation is atom-probe microscopy. This is used in conjunction with Monte Carlo techniques (Metropolis algorithm and overlapping distributions MC) to explore the multidimensional GB phase space. Experimentally we determine the five macroscopic degrees of a GB employing transmission electron microscopy and then determine the Gibbsian interfacial excess of solute of the same GB employing atom-probe microscopy. The simulational approach uses lattice statics calculations to determine initially the lowest energy GB structures and then MC simulations to calculate their Gibbsian excesses. The effects of both the macroscopic and microscopic degrees of freedom are studied. It is demonstrated that the Gibbsian excess is a complicated function of both the macroscopic and microscopic degrees of freedom. Also a GB's atomic structure determines the partition between segregation at dislocation's cores and in the elastic stress fields of GB dislocations. It is concluded that none of the geometric criteria discussed in the literature is capable of predicting the propensity for GB segregation.

INTERFACE ENGINEERING FOR SINTERING CORDIERITE GLASS-CERAMIC COATINGS ON MOLYBDENUM:</B> Thomas A. Kuhr, <I>Guo-Quan Lu</I>, Dept. of MSE, VPI &amp; SU, Blacksburg, VA 24061
<P>
An economical technology for laying down thick ceramic coatings on a metal substrate is to tape-cast a ceramic slurry on the metal surface followed by binder burn-out and sintering. We used the technology to produce cordierite coatings on molybdenum for use as electrostatic wafer chucks. A critical issue in the production was adhesion between the two materials after the coatings were sintered at temperatures ranging from 900&#176;C to 1000&#176;C. To solve the problem, thin metallic interlayers were deposited by electroplating on Mo surface before tape-casting. We will discuss the selection and processing of several interlayer materials that significantly enhanced adhesion between the ceramic coating and metal substrate.

ADVANCE IN STUDY OF NON-EQUILIBRIUM SEGREGATION ON INTERFACE:</B> <I>Xinlai He</I>, Huaiyang Cui, Department of Materials Physics, University of Science and Technology Beijing, 100083, Beijing, China
<P>
Equilibrium segregation of solute on interface has been recognized quite a long time. In recent years, there are more interests in non-equilibrium segregation, for example, the boron non-equilibrium segregation on grain boundaries during cooling, annealing and pre-strained treatment has been studied systematically. In 1991, by means of Particle Tracking Autoradiograph (PTA) technique, it was found that boron non-equilibrium segregates on moving boundaries during recrystallization in low carbon steels (X.L.He). In Fe-3%Si alloy with b.c.c. structure, it was observed that no detectable boron segregation on boundaries during continuous cooling and annealing but a stronger boron segregation on moving boundaries during recrystallization (S.H.Zhang, 1992). Recently, in Fe-30%Ni with f.c.c. structure, a significant segregation of boron was shown on recrystallizing boundaries while segregation of boron was hardly observed on primary grain boundaries during recrystallization at high temperature (H.Y.Cui, 1995). These investigations indicate that three characteristics relate with the moving boundary segregation: (1)the segregation accompanied with motion of boundary (2)the degree of the segregation was higher than that at thermodynamical equilibrium (3)the velocity of moving boundary and addition of alloy elements influenced on the segregation process. In order to explain the phenomenon, based on the interaction between dislocations and the moving boundaries during recrystallization, a dislocation relaxation and widening grain boundary mechanism of solute segregation on moving boundaries was proposed.

Molecular-dynamics simulations are used to induce the migration of a flat (001) twist grain boundary (GB) by anistropically straining a bicrystal of Cu at high temperatures. The observed migration process has the following three characteristic features: (1) the motion of the GB is viscous and continuous; (2) the observed drift velocity is proportional to the applied driving force and thermally activated; (3) the activation energy for migration is significantly lower than either that for GB diffusion or that for self-diffusion in molten Cu. The atomic-level mechanism of grain-boundary migration is discussed. *Work supported by the US Department of energy, BES-Materials Science under Contract No. W-31-109-Eng-38.

MAKING LINKS BETWEEN GRAIN BOUNDARY CHARACTER DISTRIBUTIONS AND POLYCRYSTALLINE PROPERTIES:</B> <I>Alexander H. King</I>, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, State University of New York at Stony Brook, Stony Brook, NY 11794-2275
<P>
Automated orientation analysis makes it possible to perform an &quot;epidemiological&quot; kind of materials research in which the occurrence of certain types of grain boundary is associated with certain types of polycrystalline property. What is left out of many studies of this kind, however, is the causal link that relates a certain grain boundary character distribution to a particular polycrystalline behavior. In this presentation, I will caution that focusing upon the grain boundary character in terms of &quot;small-angle,&quot; &quot;coincidence-related&quot; and &quot;general&quot; categories can be misleading. I will provide a number of examples to show that these are not always the important (or desirable) features of the grain boundary character distribution, drawing my illustrations from work on high-Tc superconductors and metallic polycrystalline thin films. Finally, if time permits, I will comment upon the characterization of triple-junctions and show, once again, that currently popular types of characterization are seriously misleading.

THE STRUCTURE OF DEFORMATION INDUCED HIGH ANGLE BOUNDARIES:</B> <I>D.A. Hughes</I>, Materials and Engineering Sciences Center, Sandia National Labs., Livermore, CA 94550
<P>
Internal interfaces develop during deformation at the places where grains subdivide. Some of these interfaces develop into high angle boundaries that subsequently have a large effect on the materials properties including local crystallographic textures, flow strength and annealing behavior. The structure of very high angle boundaries (&gt;30=B0) formed during deformation by dislocations and texture processes was examined using transmission electron microscopy and convergent beam diffraction. The large misorientation angles that develop by these processes are similar to those angles encountered in ordinary grain boundaries. These boundaries are characterized according to their angle/axis pair, boundary plane, tilt/twist character, thickness, sigma value and their association with trapped glide dislocations. In general these boundaries have a complex character and are not low sigma boundaries. The structure of these deformation induced boundaries is then compared to that of equilibrium grain boundaries such as those that form during recrystallization.

ANALYSIS OF TWINS AND STACKING DEFECTS IN THE CUBIC LAVES PHASE OF THE Hf-V-Nb ALLOY SYSTEM:</B> D.E. Luzzi, <I>D.P. Pope</I>, A. Goldberg, G.

<P>
The brittle nature at low temperatures of Laves phase intermetallic compounds remains a major obstacle to the use of these complex-structured materials for their excellent high temperature properties. Deformation by twinning is seen as a possible mechanism by which to obtain acceptable levels of ductility and toughness at low temperatures. In this paper, the microstructures of a cubic HfV2+Nb Laves phase is studied before and after compressive deformation using conventional and high-resolution electron microscopy. The Laves phase occurs as precipitates within a matrix of a V-Nb bcc solid solution. In the underformed material, narrow stacking defects with thicknesses of from one to three times the (111) interplanar spacing are seen lying on the (111) crystallographic planes. The distribution of these defects is anisotropic on the mesoscopic scale with spacings ranging from approximately 2 nm to over 200 nm. The deformed material shows extensive twinning of the Laves phase precipitates. The twins occur in clusters and twin bands as small as 2 nm in width are seen. Analysis of the structure of the stacking defects and twins and comparisons between the mesoscopic distributions of stacking defects in the undeformed materials and twins in the deformed materials will be presented.

DISSOCIATION MECHANISMS FOR EXTRINSIC GRAIN BOUNDARY DISLOCATIONS: </B> <I>S.G. Song</I>, J.S. Vetrano, S.M. Bruemmer, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, WA 99352
<P>
The plastic deformation of grain boundaries (GBs) is central to the understanding of a wide range of materials behavior including superplasticity and creep. In analogy to the bulk deformation carried out microscopically by lattice dislocations, GB deformation cannot occur without the involvement of grain boundary dislocations (GBDs). The present investigation examines the stability of extrinsic GBDs in Al alloys. It is found that the dissociation of extrinsic GBDs not only is a function of temperature but also of other variables such as solute content and GB structures. Given a boundary structure, the Burgers vectors of the secondary GBDs, resulting from the dissociation of extrinsic GBDs in general GBs, can be predicted based on the DSC-lattice. The visibility of the secondary dislocations varies with the magnitude of their Burgers vectors. The GBD stability of different boundary misorientations is compared so that common properties of grain boundary plastic behavior can be drawn.

EFFECT OF THE MAGNITUDE OF GRAIN BOUNDARY DISLOCATION BURGERS VECTORS O DISSOCIATION OF EXTRINSIC GRAIN BOUNDARY DISLOCATIONS:</B> <I>S.G. Song</I>, J.S. Vetrano, S.M. Brummer, Structural Materials Interfaces, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, WA 99352
<P>
The concept of Burgers vectors of secondary grain boundary dislocations (SGBDs), resulting from the dissociation of extrinsic grain boundary dislocations (EGBDs), in general grain boundaries can be extrapolated from those of GBDs in CSL boundaries. Increasing CSL boundary index results in the decrease in magnitude of the basis vectors of the corresponding DSC lattice on which the Burgers vectors of the SGBDs are determined. There exists a critical size of the elementary Burgers vectors of the dissociated grain boundary dislocations. Below this value, an EGBD disappears eventually after the SGBDs resulting from the dissociation spread to a sufficient distance that is dependent on temperature and instrument parameters. On the other hand, the resulting SGBDs are always visible if their Burgers vectors are above the critical size.

CONTROL OF METAL PRECIPITATE MORPHOLOGY BY SOLID STATE REACTIONS:</B> Monika Backhaus-Ricoult, CECM-CNRS, 15 Rue G. Urbain, F 94 407 Vitry sur Seine
<P>
Internal reduction of transition metal doped mixed oxides yields formation of fine dispersion of metal particles within the oxide matrix. Selection of special reaction parameters like oxygen partial pressure gradient, reaction temperature, chemical composition of the mixed oxide and the type of matrix oxide and dopant allows to control the microstructure of the reduced scale, the morphology of the metal precipitates and the fine-structure of the metal-ceramic interfaces down to an atomic scale. Experimental results for different mixed oxides containing magnesia, alumina or zirconia will be reported. Growth and thermodynamical equilibrium shapes of the precipitates will be presented. Precipitate morphology, relative orientation relationship and interface fine structure will be interpreted in terms of the diffusion field (which allows the metal precipitation), the chemical reaction at the precipitate interface, the interface energy and its anisotropy and the mechanical response of the system to solid state reaction related stresses.

INTERFACIAL DEBONDING IN MULTI-LAYER THIN FILM SYSTEMS</B>: <I>X.H. Liu</I>, C.F. Shih, Division of Engineering, Brown University, Providence, RI 02912
<P>
To improve the reliability of electronic devices, it is important to understand the interfacial debonding of multi-layer thin film systems. The interfacial fracture energy can be measured experimentally using a sandwich four-point bending specimen. This interfacial fracture energy includes both the intrinsic debonding energy of the metal/ceramic interface and the plastic dissipation in the metal layers. The plastic dissipation makes a substantial contribution to the interfacial fracture energy. In contrast to the plastic dissipation, which depends on the layer thickness, the intrinsic debonding energy is a material property of the interface and is important in the evaluation of interface adhesion and design of multi-layers. A micromechanical model is used to investigate interfacial debonding. From the model the intrinsic debonding energy can be obtained using the measured interfacial fracture energy. The effects of interfacial adhesion and metal layer properties on the interfacial fracture energy are discussed.

THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GB SEGREGATION AND FRACTURE STRENGTH:</B> R.G. Faulkner, L.S. Shvindlerman, Institute of Polymer Technology and Materials Engineering, Loughborough University, Loughborough, Leics LE11 3TU, Institute for Solid State Physics, Russian Academy of Science, Chernogolovka, 142432, Moscow, Russia<P>
A thermodynamic analysis is performed of the effects of segregation and grain boundary structure on grain boundary free energy in metallic solids. This leads to a definition of the reduction in grain boundary free energy caused by a given level of segregant. In turn this allows the prediction of grain boundary fracture strength assuming a ductile material intergranular fracture mechanism as proposed by McMahon and Vitek. The net result is that intergranular fracture strengths can be predicted as a function of the segregation patterns existing for the material's specific thermal history, the grain boundary sigma value, and the interplanar spacing on the boundary plane. A knowledge of the binding energy of the segregant atoms to the boundary is required but this is shown to be calculable on the basis of atomic misfits for metallic lattices. The results are compared with available data from Lim and Watanabe on GB fracture in Al-Sn-Zn materials.

THE ROLE OF GRAIN BOUNDARY ARBON FILMS IN THE RATE-DEPENDENT, INTERGRANULAR FRACTURE OF NICKEL-COPPER</B>: <I>MarjorieAnn E. Natishan</I>, Matthew Wagonhoffer, Mechanical Engineering Department, University of Maryland, College Park, MD 20742<P>
As part of an ongoing investigation to bound the service conditions of intergranular failure in nickel-copper alloy K-500 containing grain boundary precipitates of carbon, previously tested stress-rupture specimens were examined to document and characterize the deformation associated with grain boundary failures. Of particular interest was defining the role of the grain boundary carbon precipitates in the rate-dependent intergranular fracture process under ambient conditions. The failed creep/stress rupture specimens were sectioned perpendicular to the fracture surface and prepared for optical and electron microscopy of the microstructure adjacent to the primary fracture. High resolution microscopy revealed voids opened along the grain boundaries at carbon precipitate/nickel grain boundary interfaces. It is postulated that voids nucleate along these interfaces due to the combined driving force of the applied local stress resulting from dislocation accumulation at grain boundary/carbon interfaces and vacancy diffusion to these high energy sites. The intergranular failure then results from crack propagation along intergranular paths weakened by void formation.

ATOMISTIC STUDIES OF SEGREGATION AND FRACTURE IN Al-Mg ALLOYS:</B> <I>X.Y. Liu</I>, J.B. Adams, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 105 South Goodwin Avenue, Urbana, IL 61801
<P>
High Mg content (&gt;5%) Al-Mg alloys are known to cause edge cracking during the hot working. We investigated one possible explanation, that Mg segregation to grain-boundaries can embrittle them. The extent of Mg segregation to a wide variety of grain-boundaries in Al alloys with 10% Mg is determined with the EAM. These results are consistent with our previous surface segregation studies, which are consistent with experimental studies of surface segregation. The Griffith ideal work of fracture is determined by rigidly cleaving both pure Al and Al-Mg alloys; the presence of 20-40% Mg at interface is found to lower the work of adhesion by 10%. Segregation of Mg to surface (for slow fracture, i.e., below the threshold for catastrophic failure) suggests a further reduction of 20% in the work of adhesion. Dynamic studies of fracture are also carried out with Molecular Dynamics, to determine the effect of plastic deformation.

ATOMISTIC SIMULATION OF NANOCRYSTALLINE MATERIALS:</B> <I>S.R. Phillpot</I>, P. Keblinski, D. Wolf, Materials Science Division, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL 60439; H. Gleiter, Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe, 76021 Karlsruhe, Germany<P>
Molecular-dynamics simulations have been used to synthesize and characterize fully dense, three-dimensional, &quot;relaxed&quot; nanocrystalline fcc metals and silicon. The high-energy grain boundaries in these nanocrystalline materials are found to be highly disordered. In the case of silicon the structures of the highly-constrained grain boundaries, triple lines and point grain junctions were found to be highly disordered and similar to the structure of amorphous silicon. Computer simulations of the behavior of an idealized model nanocrystalline material expose important parallels that exist in the dynamical properties of nanocrystalline materials and glasses. Both types of heavily disordered, metastable microstructures exhibit low- and high-frequency lattice-vibrational modes not seen in the perfect crystal, giving rise to similar thermodynamic properties at low temperatures, most notably a pronounced anomaly in their specific heats and a free-energy based phase transition from the nanocrystalline state to the glass below a critical grain size. Based on a free-energy argument, we suggest that below a critical grain size nanocrystalline materials should be unstable with respect to the amorphous phase.

THE EFFECT OF GRAIN BOUNDARY CHARACTER ON TIME DEPENDENT CRACK PROPAGATION IN A Ni-BASE SUPERALLOY:</B> <I>P.F. Browning</I>1, M.F. Henry1, K. Rajan2, 1General Electric Corp. Res. &amp; Dev., P.O. Box 8, Schenectady, NY 12301; 2Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Dept. of Materials Engrg., Troy, NY 12180<P>
An investigation of the effect of grain boundary character in the Ni-base superalloy Rene 88DT on environmentally assisted crack propagation in high temperature, gaseous environments will be presented. When tested at elevated temperature under hold time fatigue or sustained loading conditions in gaseous environment, crack propagation can occur intergranularly in this alloy, and hence may be influenced by grain boundary character. Automated microanalytical techniques have been applied to the crack tip area, with the intent of determining whether intergranular cracking occurs more readily along certain types of grain boundaries. The Coincident Side Lattice approach has been taken to characterize the misorientation between adjacent grains.

DYNAMIC EMBRITTLEMENT IN BERYLLIUM-STRENGTHENED COPPER:</B> <I>Ranjani C. Muthiah</I>, C.J. McMahon, Jr., University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA; Amitava Guha, Brush Wellman Inc., Cleveland, OH<P>
Dynamic embrittlement refers to the quasi-static diffusion-controlled decohesion, usually along grain boundaries, that can occur when a high-strength alloy is stressed in the presence of surface-absorbed impurities. Oxygen-induced cracking of nickel-based alloys at high temperatures (relevant to gas turbine engines) is thought to be an example of this phenomenon. A precipitation-hardened Cu-0.26%Be, which can be heat-treated to a wide range of strengths, is being used as a low-temperature model material for dynamic embrittlement. This alloy was found to be resistant to cracking at 200&#176;C in an inert atmosphere but was highly susceptible to grain boundary cracking in air. Preliminary tests indicate that the failure time is highly stress-dependent, but there is an incubation time for the cracking, presumably related to crack nucleation. Crack growth rate studies are being done to eliminate the effect of the variable nucleation time. The oxygen partial pressure and yield strength dependence of the cracking mechanism are also being studied.

ATOMIC-SCALE SIMULATIONS OF GRAIN-BOUNDARY FRACTURE:</B> F. Cleri, ENEA, Divisione Materiali Avanzati, Centro Richerche Casaccia, CP 2400, 00100 Roma A.D., Italy; S.R. Phillpot, D.

Yip, Department of Nuclear Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02138
<P>
The results of fully atomistic simulations of grain-boundary fracture are presented. Microcracks were placed in the interface plane of symmetric-tilt grain boundaries (STGBs) for an fcc system described by a smoothed Lennard-Jones potential uniaxially loaded in pure mode-I. Proper treatment of boundary conditions was ensured, as demonstrated by the good agreement of crack propagation energy and stress fields with the continuum-elasticity solutions for the bulk reference crystal. The ductile vs. Brittle response of different STGBs was investigated as a function of the grain-boundary structure. A directional toughness effect was observed and compared to available experimental data and continuum-elasticity-based theoretical treatments. Extensive comparison with the Peierls-Nabaro-Rice model of dislocation nucleation from a crack tip was carried out, showing that some of the assumptions of the model need to be reconsidered in the case of interfacial fracture. *Word of FC was partly supported by Italian National Research Council (CNR), grant AI93.02171.11.

<P>SCIENCE &AMP; TECHNOLOGY POLICIES FOR DEVELOPMENT: AN INTERNATIONAL OVERVIEW:</B> <I>Dr. Krishan Rajan</I>, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Materials Engineering Department, MRS-110, Troy, NY 12180-8554
<P>
In the presentation we provide an overview of the role changing political structures and its influence on science and technology policies. Specific issues of the role of the private sector in different types of economies are from the role of multinational corporations to state owned enterprises. The different roles played by industry in these counties in promoting cooperation among the different sectors in science and technology policy are examined.

<P>COMPETITIVE TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT: STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS WITH UNIVERSITY AND GOVERNMENT:</B><I> Michele Migliuolo</I>, Vice President of Technology, Kurt J. Lesker Company, 1515 Worthington Avenue, Clairton, PA 15025 
<P>
Product development in a growing small business can be difficult due to lack of internal expertise or facilities. Often technology is not developed due to an apparent lack of appropriate resources. We discuss the long standing and on-gong strategic technology transfer programs at the Kurt J. Lesker Company. We leverage financial resources (internal, government, customer) with technical resources (internal, university, customer), to develop new products and processes which are more effectively manufacturable. Our research programs serve to establish us as a manufacturer of exceptional deposition systems and component, and as an engineering firm with the knowledge which a manufacturer of devices and systems requires. It is the combination of our deposition systems and process technology which will ensure that this firm is regarded as a world leader in materials science. By allowing our company to perform research and development efforts which we would not have otherwise undertaken, our funding sources thus contribute to business growth, direct company growth, academic research, education of graduate students and researchers, and local economic growth as a result of increased employment.

METALLURGICAL INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION AND STEEL INDUSTRY IN CHINA:</B> Prof. Zengyong Zhong, Chinese Society for Metals, 46 Dongsixi Dajie, Beijing 100711, China; Prof. Xishan Xie, University of Science and Technology, Beijing, 30 Xueyuan Road, Beijing  100083 China; Prof. Zhongwu Lu, Northeastern University, Shenyang, 110006, China
<P>
The progress of the Chinese steel industry in the last four decades and appropriate development of metallurgical institutions of higher education are briefly reviewed.  The favorite and unfavorite conditions for close contact between academic institutions and industry are discussed.  Principal linkages between institutions of higher education and steel industry are induced; they are the following:  science popularization, continuing education, qualification and degree education staffs in-service, joint accomplishment of research projects, and supervision of student practices in steel works.  The important role of The Chinese Society for Metals in respect of relationship between academic institutions and industry is emphasized.  In the process of economic reform in China more close university/college-industry linkages are expected.

BRIDGING THE UNIVERSITY AND INDUSTRY CULTURES: A Canadian Perspective:</B> J.K. Brimacombe, O.C., Alcan Chair in Materials Process Engineering, The Centre for Metallurgical Process Engineering, The University of British Columbia, Room 112-2355 East Mail, Vancouver, British Columbia V8T 1Z4, Canada
<P>
Although encompassing a land mass roughly the same as that of the United States, Canada has only one-tenth of the U.S. population.  Consequently to sustain major industries which serve large markets, Canada by necessity is a nation of global traders; indeed Canada and the United States are the worlds largest trading partners.  Notwithstanding a strong and growing manufacturing sector, Canada has relied on her abundant natural resources  minerals, petroleum, forests and fishery  to buttress her economy.  The development of advanced materials has been important but less so than in the United States, largely because Canadas military-based research has been small compared to that of its southern counterpart.  Thus research at Canadian universities has not lost a focus on the natural resource industries even while developing programs in advanced materials.  This balance has been underpinned by the enlightened funding policy of the Canadian Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council which has strongly encouraged university-industry linkages.  NSERC programs are described briefly and illustrations of university-industry collaboration, drawn from the authors experience, are presented.

STATUS-UNIVERSITY-INDUSTRY COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH IN JAPAN: </B><I>Professor Shuji Hanada</I>, Institute of Materials Research, Tohoku University, Katahira 2-1-1, Sendai, Japan
<P>
<P>There are two types of universities in Japan; national universities and private universities. Basically, the former are supported mainly by the government (The ministry of education, culture and science-the Monbusho), while the latter partly by the government. Among them, the national universities are active to collaborative research with industry. In this talk the various systems and their activities concerning the research collaboration between national universities and industry will be addressed. In addition some recent topics will be mentioned briefly. From the early 1980s, new systems of joint research with the private sector, endowed chairs and funded research departments and centers for cooperative research were introduced. Consequently, the exchange of researchers between universities and the private sector industries has become quite active, and the sources of research funds for national universities has become diversified. Currently over three thousand outside researchers participate in research activities at universities and the total amount of funding from industry has become almost as large as the Monbusho grants-in-aid budget.
<P>In the system of the joint research with the private sector, national universities receive researchers and funding from private industry. Then university researchers and private industry researchers combine efforts to do joint research on common projects, to enhance the likelihood of achieving excellent results. Under the commissioned research system, scientific researchers in universities are commissioned by industrial firms, government research institutes, local governments or other outside organizations to carry out research by contract. No researchers from the industrial world join in carrying out the research at the universities. In the commissioned researchers system, national universities accept technicians and researchers currently employed in private industry and other outside agencies. They are given guidance in doing research at the graduate level, which helps them to improve their abilities. Endowed chairs can be established within a faculty or department of a national university. Funded research departments can be established in a research laboratory attached to the university or in an inter-university research institute. The wages of the visiting professors or associate/assistant professors, who are appointed by the universities, and the educational and research expenses of the chairs and departments are paid totally from the endowments from the private sectors. Many national universities have Centers for Cooperative Research. These centers employ professors as part-time directors as well as full-time associate professors and part-time visiting professors. They are equipped with all purpose research facilities and provide technical consultation and training of technicians and researchers, in addition to their functions of engaging in joint and commissioned research. National universities accept donations from both private organizations and individuals to support scientific research and educational activities. Quite recently, the ministry of international trade and industry (MITI-The tsusansho) has started supporting and funding basic research at universities whose results will bring new industries in future.

Recent advances in the synthesis of light-weight metallic materials will be reviewed with emphasis on developments which have occurred since the last symposium in this series. Primary consideration will be given to alloys based on aluminium, magnesium and titanium both in monolithic and composite configurations. Emphasis will be on synthesis/processing/fabrication rather than the more traditional microstructure-mechanical property relationships.  Particular attention will be given to the status of commercialisation of high performance light-weight metallic materials.

<P>
Of potential practical hydrogen storage materials (HSM), pure Mg would be best from the standpoint of hydrogen capacity per unit mass. However, pure Mg has poor hydrating reactivity due to surface oxide poisoning and low catalytic activity. Mg-Ni is a well-known attentive that is more stable against oxidation. The Ni aids catalysis of the H2 dissociate chemisorption and produces additional benefits by lowering the dehydrogenation temperature, but at the expense of a decrease in storage capacity. Theoretical considerations suggest that nanostructured Mg with low concentrations of both Ni and Fe will be an optimum Mg-based HSM. We have prepared submicron Mg-(Ni,Fe) pseudoalloys by bail milling and report here on the hydrogen storage characteristics.

<P>PROCESSING AND PROPERTIES OF TITANIUM AND TITANIUM METAL MATRIX COMPOSITE BASED LAMINATES: </B>Y.Q. Zuo, D.J. Smith, P.G. Partridge, A. Wisbey; Department of Mechanical Engineering, Interface Analysis Centre, University of Bristol, UK; Structural Materials Centre, DRA Farnborough, UK
<P>
Two laminate systems based on titanium alloy IMI834 and titanium metal matrix composite (MMC) have been manufactured by diffusion bonding. The S-type laminate contain 50% MMC in the outside layers and 50% Vol. IMI834 in the middle of the laminate. The C-type laminate contains the same volume fraction of IMI834 and MMC, but here the MMC is in the middle of the laminate. Bonding parameters: temperature, pressure and time have been optimised. Effective Young's Modulus and bend strength have been investigated using four-point bend tests, and impact fracture toughness of the laminates and control samples have been assessed by using an instrumented impact testing. For un-notched specimens, 100% IMI834 has highest fracture toughness with lowest E and strength; MMC, in contrast, has higher strength and lowest fracture toughness. However, for notched specimens, both of them have lower strength and fracture toughness compared with the S-type laminate. The measured stiffness (E) for the S-type laminate was greater than that for IMI834 by about 1.7. By laminating materials, the impact fracture toughness of S-type laminate for un-notched and notched specimens, compared with 100% MMC material, increased by about 2.7 and 4.6. Young's modulus strength, and fracture toughness can be optimised by selecting different structures. Lamination by combining tough matrices and reinforced components is an effective way to improve toughness for high strength materials, like MMC, and the properties of the materials can be tailored according to a particular application.

<P>PROCESSING OF Ti/SiC COMPOSITES: A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF THE FOIL-FIBRE-FOIL AND THE TAPE-CASTING TECHNIQUES: </B><I>Zheng Xiao GUO</I>, Department of Materials, Queen Mary and Westfield College, University of London, Mile End Road, London E1 4NS, UK
<P>
Ti-based SiC fibre reinforced composites are strong, stiff and light-weight materials for high temperature applications up to 700-1000&#176;C. As with any other advanced materials, their development has to overcome both economic and technical hurdles. Here, a study into the foil-fibre-foil and the tape-casting processing techniques is reported. The fundamental procedures involved in the techniques are compared and discussed. Possibilities of reducing product costs are analysed. Due to the reactive nature of titanium, the composites must be processed under minimum thermal exposure to reduce undesirable fibre/matrix interfacial reactions: on the other hand, care should also be taken not to use too low a temperature or too large a pressure in order to avoid fibre breakage. This requires an optimum balance of the processing temperature, pressure and time. Therefore, both theoretical and experimental investigations were conducted for the consolidation of aligned fibre mats with matrix foils or with matrix powder-tapes. The effects of processing parameters, such as temperature pressure and time, on the mechanisms of identification are evaluated. Predictions of the process model are compared with experimental findings, which shows satisfactory agreement. Various types of interfacial defects and fibre breaking have been analysed in relation to the processing parameters and fibre/matrix lay-ups. Consequently, defect- and reaction- free composites have been obtained. This is particularly successful with the assistance of a temporary hydrogenation procedure using either pre-hydrogenated foils or powder particles during processing.

CHARACTERISATION OF SIGMA SIC FIBRE/TITANIUM ALLOY MMCS FABRICATION BY PLASMA SPRAYING AND FOIL/FIBRE METHODS:</B> <I>A.M. Baker, </I>P.S. Grant, M.L. Jenkins , C.M. Ward-Close, Z. Fan, B Cantor ,OCAMAC, Department Of Materials University of Oxford, Parks Road, Oxford OX1 3PH, UK

A new process for vacuum plasma spray manufacturing of multi-ply Titanium/SiC fibre MMC rings has been developed. Material produced can be identified easily by subsequent vacuum hot pressing or HIP. Ti and Ti-6A1-4V matrices have been 'spray-wound' with C coated and C/TIBx coated DRA Sigma SiC fibres. Characterisation by electron microscopy has identified interfacial reaction products, showing that the fibre/matrix reaction is similar to that for plasma sprayed monotapes. SiC fibres chemically extracted from the matrix have been subjected to tensile and bend testing to quantify process damage for spray-wound and foil/fibre material. This has shown that fibre damage from spray/winding is of a similar magnitude to that from foil/fibre processing. Possible mechanisms for fibre damage during processing have been identified.

CONSOLIDATION OF CONTINUOUS SiC/Ti-6Al-4V MATRIX-COATED FIBRE METAL MATRIX COMPOSITES: </B><I>S. Schuler</I>, B. Derby, M.J. Wood, C.M. Ward-Close1<B>, </B>Oxford Centre for Advanced Materials and Composites, OCAMAC, Department of Materials, University of Oxford, Parks Road, Oxford , OX1 3P; Structural Materials Centre, Defence Research Agency, DRA, Farnborough Hampshire, GU14 6TD, UK

The consolidation of continuous matrix-coated fibre Metal Matrix Composites, MMC, has been investigated using a theoretical as well as an experimental approach. A numerical, quantitative model has been developed for the solid-state consolidation of continuous Matrix-Coated Fibre, MCF, Metal Matrix Composites. In addition, an experimental verification programme was conducted using two different samples types, one produced under normal conditions and one containing yttrium maker layers. The marker layers were used to make the matrix deformation visible, which occurs during the consolidation, and hence offered the opportunity of a direct comparison of the predicted matrix deformation and the experimentally determined matrix deformation. The materials investigated were continuous Textron SCS-6 SiC fibres in a Ti-6A1-4V metal matrix. The fabrication route chosen was the Matrix-Coated Fibre method, developed by the DRA Farnborough, UK. In this method, the fibres are pre-coated prior to consolidation with the matrix material using Electron Beam Evaporation, a Physical Vapour Deposition technique. The thickness of the matrix-coating and hence the final fibre volume fraction of the composite can easily be varied by adjusting the coating time. For the consolidation to the final composite the matrix-coated fibres are stacked, degassed placed into a titanium container and hot-isostatically pressed. The analytical model is based on a Finite Element Model, FEM.

RECENT ADVANCES IN FIBER COATING TECHNOLOGY FOR USE IN SiC/Ti-MMCs:</B> <I>D. Upadhyays, </I>P. Tsakiropoulos, and F.H.

Continuous silicon carbide fibre-reinforced titanium-based metal matrix composites offer many advantages over conventional monolithic materials including high strength-to-density ratio. However, there is a need to design an improved protective coating for the silicon carbide fibre to combat interfacial chemical reactions as well as to accommodate large mismatch in the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) between the SiC fibre and titanium matrix. This paper describes the strategy for designing coating for continuous silicon carbide fibre and reports on a new coating system based on a compliant layer/ reaction barrier concept developed for titanium metal matrix, composites including those based on <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">-TiA1. The newly developed coating system, designated FUWT1. consists of Gd/GdB3 where the Gd layer (adjacent to SiC) works as a compliant layer while the GdB3 layer works as a reaction barrier. The results of this work indicate that the FUWT coating perform well both a reaction barrier (protect the SiC fibre from reactions with titanium up to 100&#176;C) and a compliant layer (absence of thermal cracking in AiA1 based composite). The interfacial shear strength of an as-fabricated SiC/FUWT/Ti-6A1-4V was found to be higher than the presently available SCS6/Ti-6A1-4V and Sigma (SM1240)/Ti06A1-4V composites. From the surnames of the four co-inventors: Froes, Upadhyaya, Ward-Close and Tsakiropoulos.

SYNTHESIS AND PHASE EQUILIBRA IN TiB2 PARTICLE REINFORCED HIGH MODULUS STEEL: </B>Kouji Tanaka, Tadashi Oshima, and Takashi Takashi Saito, Toyota Central R&amp;D Labs, Inc., 41-1 Yokomichi, Nagakute, Aichi, 480-11, JAPAN
<P>
This paper describes the synthesis of high modulus steel for automobile parts with an emphasis on its alloy-designing concept and phase equilibrium. Titanium diboride (TiB2) particles have been verified to be the best reinforcement for improving isotropic Young's modulus of steels. The calculated phase diagram shows that TiB2 has a narrow tow-phase equilibrium window with carbon-free Fe-Cr-Ti ferric steel and has neither solubility of iron nor chromium. Those thermo-dynamical stability's of TiB2 are responsible for maintaining its own high Young's modulus of 540GPa in the ferocity steel. Both pre-mixed and in-situ TiB2 particles effectively reinforced the ferocity steel matrix. The developed steel with 30vol.%TiB2 showed a Young's modulus of 280GPa which apparently corresponded to 350GPa due to its reduced density of 6.6g/cc compared with 7.8g/cc of the conventional steel.

PRODUCING METHOD AND MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF TiB2 PARTICLE REINFORCED HIGH MODULUS STEEL:</B> <I>Kouji Tanaka</I>, Tadashi Oshima, Takashi Saito, Toyota Central Labs., Inc., 41-1 Yokomichi, Nagakute, Aichi, 480-11, Japan
<P>
<P>In our effort to develop high modulus steel, titanium diboride (TiB2) has proved to be the best reinforcement because of its high Young's modulus and excellent thermodynamic stability in iron-based alloys. In this paper, mechanical properties of the developed steel and the methods applied to practical parts fabrication are discussed. Conventional P/M techniques, including liquid phase sintering to achieve its full density and reaction sintering using low-cost ferroalloy powders, have been successfully utilised. Tensile strength, fatigue strength, and abrasive wear resistance of the developed steel were investigated in order to evaluate its potential application. These mechanical properties revealed a linear improvement with the increase in TiB2 volume fraction. The developed steel also provided hot workability required in die-forging process. Trial forged parts demonstrated a possibility of producing high performance automobile parts.

<P>A STUDY ON MANUFACTURING METHOD AND ABRASIVE CHARACTERISTICS OF SUBSIEVE SIZE SiCp REINFORCED A1 ALLOY COMPOSITE:</B> <I>S.W. Han</I>, S.W. Kim, Department of Metallurgical Eng, Chonbuk National University, Chonju, 560-756, Korea
<P>
<P>This study aims to manufacture A1 alloy composites reinforced by subside size (3 mm, 5mm, 10mm) SiCr with duplex process of squeeze-infiltration (1st process) and squeeze casting (2nd process) developed in this study, to investigate effects of alloying element and heat exposure on the microstructures and heat and wear resistance of A1-Si-X(Cu, Cr, Ni)-SiCr). In the last process, when the melt is infiltrated into SiCr bed. At the same time, melt is flowed to loser part along the gap between mould and SiCr bed. Then, the melt is filtrated into upper-direction conversely. At infiltrating depth of 30-40% into SiCr bed, the vertical lamellar infiltration is appeared heterogeneously due to lack of the melt and increase of viscosity. Although pre-composite fabricated by 1st process has excellent distribution of SiCp on matrix, the SiCp wt% is high as applying industrial articles. Being modelled, the pre-composite and A1 alloy are squeeze casted follow melted, agitated in the caster. Through these processes, SiCp wt% is freely controlled as well as the distribution is increased owing to active plain on SiCp during agitation of the 2nd process. A1-12Si-2Mg-3Cu-SiCp has the least wear loss amount among all the composites manufactured in this study. But, A1-12Si-2Mg-3Ni-SiCp has the lowest relative ratio of wear loss amount (wear loss amount after 350&#176;C, 70hr exposure)-(wear loss amount before 350&#176;C, 70hr exposure)/(wear loss amount before 350&#176;C, 70hr exposure) at high sliding speed. Composites with 15wt%(10mm)SiCp increased the wear amount with the increase of sliding speed because of change abrasive wear to adhesive or melting wear. But composite with 35wt%(10mm SiCp) decreased wear amount with the increase of the sliding speed because abrasive wear with power debris occur in high sliding speed and wear debris with block type occur in low sliding speed.

<P>
<P>Recently, particle reinforced A1 alloy matrix composites accomplished weight reduction by utilising A1 alloy matrix and improved wear resistance, heat resistance and mechanical properties. This technique is believed to have advantages compared to the conventional manufacturing process, in that the intermetallic compounds enforcers as well as density and shape of the perform are more easily controlled. In this study, perform composition of 25, 40, 50, 60 and 75at%A1 were manufactured. The perform swelled after the reactive sintering process in the case of 25at%A1 composition. On the other hand, the perform shrinkage in the case of 60at%A1 and 75at%A1 composition. Microstructures of the composite samples squeeze casted at the mould temperature of 500&#176;C and the A1 alloy melt of 610&#176;C were investigated using X-ray diffractometer, energy dispersive spectrometer, micro-vickers hardness and etching experiments. In the case of Fe-25at%A1 and 40at%A1 composites, mixture of the compound and the A1 alloy matrix were observed at the top part of the ingot, whereas small amount of A1 alloy matrix were dispersed within the compound islands at the bottom part. Composite structure were observed throughout the whole sample in the case of 50at%A1, which is the structure initially intended to obtain.

<P>
Multicomponent Mg-Y-Cu lightweight alloys were prepared by mechanical alloying of elemental powder mixtures. The progress of alloying, the resulting phases and their thermal stability were characterised by x-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermo-mechanical analysis (TMA). Coexistent amorphous and nanoscale crystalline phases are found for a variety of alloys with different composition. The thermal stability data of the materials as obtained by constant-rate heating DSC and TMA measurements and isothermal annealing experiments are discussed with respect to phase separation in the undercooled liquid state and nucleation and growth of nanocrystalline phases. Some characteristic properties of the glassy phase are presented and discussed with respect to the composition dependence of the glass transition and the crystalline temperature. The results are compared with data for melt-quenched samples. Finally, the influence of processing conditions and contamination effects during milling on the phase formation and the thermal stability of the mechanically attrited powders is critically assessed.

IRON AND ALUMINIUM MICRO/NANOLAMINATES PROCESSED BY HIGH RATE DEPOSITION:</B> C. Loader, D. Dunford, Z. Kulikowski, C.M. Ward-Close, Structural Materials Centre, Defence Research Agency, Farnborough GU14 6TD, UK
<P>
A model iron-aluminium system was employed to understand the toughness characteristics observed in multi-layered materials. The process for fabricating laminates by physical vapour deposition using either thermal or electron beam evaporation is described. Laminates are deposited onto a rotating collector and are typically around 2-4mm thick. In this work a range of laminates were fabricated with layer thickness varying from 10nm to 5mm. Microstructural evaluation of the laminates was performed using SEM, XRD, EPMA, and TEM; mechanical property data was generated using tensiles, four-point bend, notched bend, and microhardness. Results show strength and toughness increases are obtained in multi layered materials compared to monolithics primarily due to crack deflection and blunting. The effect of changing layer thickness on the strength and toughness is reported.

MICROSTRUCTURE PROPERTY STUDIES IN Fe-Al LAMINATE MATERIALS:</B> G. Shao, P. Tsakiropoulos, C. Loader, D. Dunford,* and C.M.

<P>
Fe/Al laminates of different layer thicknesses were produced by PVD. TEM studies showed that as deposited microstructure depends on the ratio of the nominal thicknesses of the Fe and Al layers and on the actual layer thickness. For dfe:dal=0.4mm the microstructure consisted of nanocrystals of Fe/Al solid solution with A2 or B2 structure and Al2Fe. For dfe:dAl>>44nm or 2.1mm:0.7mm laminated structures were produced. The laminates consisted of layers of Fe(A2-bcc) and of solid solution of Fe in Al with B2 (ordered bcc) structure which was formed by interdiffusion between the Fe and Al layers. Thermodynamic modelling showed that interdiffusion and interface reaction in the as deposited materials are closely related to the overall heat of mixing. The mechanical properties of the laminates will be related to their microstructures.

THERMODYNAMICS OF VACUUMTHERMIC REDUCTION OF LIGHTWEIGHT MAGNESIUM-LITHIUM ALLOY:</B> <I> Dajian Wang,</I> Department of Metallurgy, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan 650093, China<P>
The principles of preparation of light weight alloy of Mg-Li alloy with a low-density less than 1g/Cm3 with vacuumthermic reduction are described according to the preliminary laboratory-scale results. The process involves the use of ferrosilicon and aluminium to reduce magnesia and lithium oxide concurrently in a vacuum furnace to mixing gas of metallic magnesium and lithium due to the higher pressures for both magnesium and lithium. The metallic vapours are cooled at the lower temperature part of the furnace. Thermodynamic analysis of related reactions and their equilibrium constants revealed the probabilities of reactions and preferable reductants of ferrosilicon or aluminium. The alloying effects at low pressure of reduced magnesium and lithium and their evaporation may significantly dominate the progress of the process. Based on the calculation determination of activity coefficients of components in Mg-Li binary, the thermodynamic aspects for both reduction process and vaporisation process are systematically analysed in the paper.

STRESS RELIEVING METHODS FOR THICK ALUMINIUM ALLOY PLATE: EVALUATION BY X-RAY DIFFRACTION RESIDUAL STRESS MEASUREMENT:</B> <I>Bernt Jaensson,</I> CSM Materialteknik AB, Box 13200, S-58013 Link&ouml;ping, Sweden; <I>Alfred Heinz</I>, Hoogovens Aluminium Walzprodukte GmbH, Postbox 920, D-56009 Koblenz
<P>
In the design of metallic structural parts for aircraft there are, basically, two approaches that can be taken: either the part is built up from a number of individually formed elements which are joined by riveting or adhesive bonding, or the part is sculptured from a single forging or piece of plate. In this situation, designers of small aircraft tend to use the first approach, while integrally machine parts are dominant in the structure of large aircraft. However, the balance between the two options is also changing with time, in that present-day aircraft engineers are increasingly favouring the sculpturing method. Contributing to this trend is the availability of numerically controlled high-speed milling machines, as well as forgings and plate with low levels of residual stress. The choice between a hand forging/die forging or plate is often dictated by the height of the final part. Since plate can be more efficiently stress relieved - by stretching - it is the preferred choice whenever the thickest available plate can accommodate the part. In the last couple of years, plate producers have strived to raise the upper limit of the thickness range from, say, 150 mm to 250 - 300 mm. In so doing, might exceed the capacity of existing stretching presses, which necessitates the use of an alternative stress-relieving method e.g. stepwise cold compression. With respect to the resulting residual stress level, one could ask the question to which extent the relative advantage of plate over forging is preserved in this case. An earlier investigation of the relationship between stress-relieving of die forgings, residual stresses and distortion during machining is recapitulated to give a background to the present work, which involves measurement of through-thickness stress variations in 100 and 150 mm thick plate, stress relieved by stretching, and in cold compressed plate of 200 mm thickness.

TEXTURE CONTROL OF ALUMINUM ALLOY SHEETS:</B> C.-H. Choi, K.-H. Kim, D.N. Lee, School of Materials Science and Engineering and Center for Advanced Materials Research, Seoul National University, Shinrimdong, Kwanak-ku, Seoul 151-742, Korea<P>
In order to achieve good deep drawability it is imperative to obtain well developed {111}texture which gives rise to the higher plastic strain ratio. It is difficult to obtain the texture from conventional rolling and annealing processes. Therefore an unconventional rolling process which causes shear deformation has been introduced in addition to the conventional rolling process. Various combinations of the conventional and unconventional rolling processes and the annealing process have been theoretically and experimentally studied to obtain the well developed {111}texture which in turn gave rise to a substantial<B> </B> increase in the plastic strain ratio.

The Al-M-Mm (Mm=misch metal) alloys have been produced by a gas atomization, a sing roll melt spinning and a twin roll spinning methods. These alloys have amorphous structure, finely mixed structure consisting of aluminium phase, intermetallic compounds homogeneously embedded in the ultrafine &quot;rained aluminium matrix and intermetallic compounds in the large &quot;rained aluminium matrix depending on the process variables. The alloy powders and ribbons have been warm compacted to various relative densities at various temperatures. The cylindrical and ring shapes compacts have been upsetted at various temperatures and the plastic deformation behaviours have been investigated using TEM, DSC and XRD. The density distribution, load, deformed geometry, friction coefficient, interparticle bonding behavior have been compared with the theoretically calculated ones. The forming limit diagrams have obtained from the ring compression tests.

NUMERICAL ANALYSIS OF MICROSEGREGATION IN AL ALLOY WELD METALS:</B> C.H. Lee, E.P. Yoon; RASOM, Dept. of Met. Eng., The Hanyang University, Seoul, Korea, 133-791<P>

During solidification of alloys under rapid thermal excursion of welds, the solute redistribution brings out microsegregation. The microsegregation causes the formation of non-equilibrium second phases, shrinkage and porosity degrading properties and forming solidification crack. Therefore, it has been required to predict microsegregation quantitatively. To predict the degree of microsegregation, more exact and appropriate computer simulation technique has been being actively used during last two decades. In this study, an advanced two dimensional model was suggested on the basis of the previous one and two dimensional models. In the new model, both primary and secondary arm regions were defined for the analysis region. Before calculation of microsegregation, the analysis region was determined by the theoretical equation for the primary and secondary arm spacing. The growth in the primary arm region was assumed to be a planar for effective calculation. Especially, for the growth of a secondary arm, a simple and effective mathematical function was established to show the growing pattern(polynomial interface). The solute diffusion in the solid phase was calculated by finite difference method (FDM). The solid-liquid interface movement was considered to be in local equilibrium state indicated by the phase diagram.

PHASE STABILITY OF Ab66Mn9(Ti, Zr)25-DISPERSION-STRENGTHENED Al ALLOY:</B> Seung-Zeon Han, Seong I.

<P>
The addition of Mn to the tetragonal Al3(Ti1-xZrx) phase produced cubic Ll2-type Al66Mn9(TiZr)25 phase with a small amount of second phases such as Al8Mn5 and Al2Zr, still existing in the as-cast state. Second phases disappeared when intermetallic compounds were homogenized at 1000&#176;C for 24 hours. After homogenization, intermetallic compounds were mixed with pure A1 in the form of powder by attritor mill and then vacuum hot pressed. IDS (intermetallic-dispersion-strengthened) Al alloys prepared in this way were analyzed in terms of phase stabilities and microstructures through XRD, SEM and TEM methods.

SOLIDIFICATION PROCESSING FOR THE PRODUCTION OF FINE GRAIN ALUMINUM ALLOY MATERIALS</B>: Akira Sato, Garo Aragane, Yoshiaki Osawa, and Susumu Takamori; National Research Institute Far Metals, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 306 Japan<P>
It is well-known that metallic materials having fine grain crystal structures possess high mechanical properties, ie., high strength and at the same time high toughness. A new process named &quot;Rapid solidification with vigomus agitation&quot; is developed to produce large ingots having fine grain and homogeneous structures. The molten alloys are rapidly solidified with watercooled copper molds and at the same time stirred vigorously by graphite rods during falling down of the melt through the gap between the mold and the rod. The results obtained using Al-Si alloys are as follows. The mean grain size of primary crystals in slurry become smaller with increasing the intensity of cooling and the rotation speed of stirring rod. Primary and eutectic Si grains are not only small but also globular when the agitation is strong enough.

FABRICATION OF TiNi INTERMETALLIC COMPOUNDS BY SELFPROPAGATION HIGH-TEMPERATURE SYNTHESIS PROCESS (SHS):</B> <I>Suk-Kwon Ko</I>, Joong-Chai Jung, Jong-Hyeon Lee, Chang-Whan Won, Rapidly Solidified Materials Research Center(RASOM), Chungnam National University, Yuseong, Taejon, 305-764 Korea
<P>
TiNi intermetallic compounds were manufactured by the self-propagating high-temperature synthesis process. The effects of chemical composition(Ni/Ti=0.5 ~2.0 molar ratio), compaction pressure and preheating temperature on the reaction were investigated. As the molar ratio of Ni, compacting pressure and preheating temperature were increased, the combustion temperature and its velocity were increased. In the every mole ratio of M, without preheating, secondary phases such as Ti2Ni, TiNi3, Ti3Ni4 as TiNi were found in the products according to the XRD analysis. At the same condition, the products prepared by of 200 were TiNi single phases by perfect reaction. Hence, the reasons to form the different phases during the reaction and the forming mechanism of TiNi for combustion reaction were discussed.

RAPID SYNTHESIS OF NANOSTRUCTURAL INTERMETALLICS AND THEIR BULK MECHANICAL PROPERTIES: </B>S.M. Pickard, A.K. Ghosh, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-2136
<P>
A PVD process has been developed to produce bulk intermetallics at high rate by direct vacuum evaporation. Independent elemental sources are directly heated using 5kW electron beams and the evaporate is deposited as a nanolaminated (layered) structure at a rate of 1-mm/minute on a rotating substrate. Insitu reaction occurs on the heated substrate to produce a homogenous nanograined bulk intermetallic deposit. The deposit can be further thermomechanically processed to produce optimum mechanical properties. TIA1, NiA1 binary and ternary alloy systems has been chosen for initial evaluation of potential mechanical property and processing advantages of bulk PVD. Both relatively thin 9140-180mm) and relatively thick (2.3) mm) layers of intermetallic alloys, have been formed. Hardness characterisation of the -deposited film shows a Vickers hardness value which is 2-3 times higher than the expected value for an as cast alloy. An initial flow stress of 700-800 MPa has been observed for the T1A1, which is higher than that of conventional cast material, with delimitation failure of the layered material. Tests on the bulk material using 3-Point banding indicate and rupture strength of 450-500MPa for Ti-30a% A1, with linear-elastic loading response to failure, indicative of extrinsic defect controlled strength. Elevated temperature tensile tests are being conducted on the intermetallics to determine rate sensitivity.

BERYLLIUM ALUMINUM ALLOY DEVELOPMENT FOR INVESTMENT CASTING: <I>Nancy F. Levoy</I>, Brian J. Smith, Nuclear Metals Inc., 2229 Main St., Concord, MA 01742
<P>
Be-Al alloys are unique, light weight, composite alloys that combine high specific stiffness and substantial strength with good ductility and toughness. This combination of properties makes these alloys attractive for many high performance aerospace applications. Due to the inherent problems associated with casting Be-Al alloys, processing of these alloys has previously been restricted to rolling or extrusion of prealloyed powder compacts. Beralcast(363 is a new cast in-situ composite alloy containing 65 wt% Be that is formed by the controlled solidification processing of a higher-order Be-Al alloy. This paper will describe the development of the Beralcast( family of alloys specifically for production of near net shape components via investment casting.

<P>
Phase selection and microstructural refinement in Nb-17A1-xMo (x=20,30,40) alloys can be controlled via alloy design and solidification processing route. The formation of ordered (B2) or disordered (A2) phases in the as cast microstructures of cold hearth processed ingots and cold hearth melt overflow processed ribbons will be briefly reviewed. DSC and TG studies of the ingots and ribbons will be discussed with emphasis on the oxidation behaviour of the alloys.

<P>
The production of TiA1-based alloys with small grain sizes has been approached in two distinct ways. Firstly, by addition of B-containing compounds to the melt and secondly via atomisation and subsequent processing. These route coupled with hot extrusion, allow control of the microstructure of these alloys so that a wide range of properties can be obtained. Results for several different alloys will be presented and the influence of composition on control of microstructure and hence of properties will be illustrated.

MICROSTRUCTURE AND MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF GAMMA TITANIUM ALUMINIDE STRIP: </B>Gopal Das, Pratt &amp; Whitney, P.O. Box 109600, West Palm Beach, FL-33410-9600
<P>
Thin gamma titanium aluminide (Ti-45A1-2Cr-2Nb at.%) series, 20 mils thick, were produced by the melt overflow rapid solidification technology (MORST) process. The microstructure resulting from heat treatments was studied by a combination of optical, X-ray, SEM and TEM methods. Transition temperatures including the alpha transits temperature were determined by DTA. Textures of gamma TiA1 strips were studied on as-cast and heat treated specimens. The microhardness was measured for specimens subjected to different heat treatments. Tensile properties of heat treated specimens were determined at RT-760&#176;C along the strip growth direction and perpendicular to it. The material failed in a brittle manner at RT for both orientations. It started to yield at 650&#176;C and at 760&#176;C, it failed in a ductile manner. The strain-to-failure along the direction perpendicular to strip growth direction was poor. Deformation microstructure was analysed by TEM and fractographs were studied. Results will be compared with those of investment cast and wrought gamma titanium aluminised. This work was supported by NASA LeRC, Cleveland, OH under Contract No. NAS3-26385.

<P>
Fully dense nanocrystalline Ti-47.5A1-3Cr intermetallic compacts were produced by mechanical alloying and hot isostatic pressing. Grain growth behaviour of these compacts was studied in the temperature range of 725 to 1100&#176;C for annealing times of 0 to 500 hours, using analytical transmission electron microscopy techniques. The temperature and time dependencies of the grain sizes and the grain size distributions were determined, allowing the evaluation of the prevailing transport mechanism responsible for the growth of nano-sized grains to be defined.

PHASE FORMATION AND PROPERTIES OF MECHANICALLY ALLOYED Mg-BASED MULTICOMPONENT LIGHTWEIGHT ALLOYS:</B> J. Eckert, N. Schlorke, C.A.R.T. Miranda1, and L.

<P>
Multicomponent Mg-Y-Cu lightweight alloys were prepared by mechanical alloying of elemental powder mixtures. The progress of alloying, the resulting phases and their thermal stability were characterised by x-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermo-mechanical analysis (TMA). Coexistent amorphous and nanoscale crystalline phases are found for a variety of alloys with different composition. The thermal stability data of the materials as obtained by constant-rate heating DSC and TMA measurements and isothermal annealing experiments are discussed with respect to phase separation in the undercooled liquid state and nucleation and growth of nanocrystalline phases. Some characteristic properties of the glassy phase are presented and discussed with respect to the composition dependence of the glass transition and the crystalline temperature. The results are compared with data for melt-quenched samples. Finally, the influence of processing conditions and contamination effects during milling on the phase formation and the thermal stability of the mechanically attrited powders is critically assessed.

HIGH TEMPERATURE DEFORMATION BEHAVIOUR OF MECHANICALLY ALLOYED Al-10Ti-XSI ALLOY:</B> C.J. Choi, W.W.

The creep property of mechanically alloyed A1-10Ti-xSi (in wt%, x=0,2 4) alloy was investigated in a wide range of stress (60-310MPa) and temperature (300-450&#176;C). Creep mechanisms were analyzed in some details and compared with each other. Two distinctive creep mechanisms have been observed depending on the testing stress and temperature, ie, Coble creep at low stresses and temperatures and dislocation creep at high stresses and temperatures. True creep activation energies in dislocation creep regime were calculated using modified semi-emperical creep equation. The calculated values were in good agreement with that for self lattice diffusion in pure aluminium. The diffusional (Coble) creep regime significantly enlarged to high stress and temperature region with an increase of Si content due to an increasing volume fraction of dispersiods.

MECHANICAL ALLOYING OF Ti-Ni BASED MATERIALS USING THE HORIZONTAL ATTRITOR:</B> H. Zoz1, D. Ernst2, I.S. Ahn3, W.H. Kwon;1Zoz GmbH, D-57482 Wenden, Germany; 2University of Siegen, D-57068 Siegen, Germany; 3Gyeonsang National University, Chinju, Gyeongnam, 660-701 Korea
<P>
The production of large quantities of contamination free mechanically alloyed powders from titanium and nickle based materials has proven to be a major challenge. Feasibility of such a goal can be carried out, at laboratory level, by any milling device like the very common planetary ball mill. In this case however, the possibility of a subsequent scaling up for larger production is hindered by the intrinsic limits of a planetary ball mill design. On the contrary the horizontal Zoz attritor can be experimented at laboratory level using small volume chamber-units (0.25, 0.5, and 2.1) and, for industrial production, using the large volume units (up to 400 1) based on the same conceptual design. Therefore, experiments have been conducted on blended elemental Ti-Ni compositions in the proportions Ti-51.5Ni, Ti-50Ni, Ti-49.5Ni and Ti-48.5Ni (at %) using a Zoz attritor with a small unit-chamber (0.51). Due to the inherent ductility of the powder, the material has the tendency to adhere to the grinding unit and the grinding media. Further, in order to avoid high contamination and to make the process realistic from an economical point of view, the milling time has to be reduced to a minimum. The above points identify a Critical Milling Behaviour (CMB) of the system under investigation that must be kept under control to achieve the wanted goal. It will be shown by the present paper that by adopting a suitable milling and discharging procedure (Cycle Operation by Operation Cycle and Discharging Cycle) low contamination and good yield have been substantially achieved. This is investigated by chemical analysis, by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction.

Mechanical alloying and hot isostatic pressing techniques were employed to synthesise a fully dense Ti-47.5AJ-3Cr alloy containing equipped nanocrystalline <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif">TiA1 grains. Isothermal annealing was conducted at 1200&#176;C (above the eutectoid transformation temperature) at holding times of 5, 10, 25 and 35 hours. Analytical transmission electron microscopy investigations revealed the presence of a dual structure comprising <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">2/<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif"> laths and equipped g grains some of which were twinned. The grains coarsened during annealing and the <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">2/<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif"> laths were formed during cooling as a result of the eutecroid transformation. At the maximum annealing time studied (35 hours), the average grain size of grains was about 2 mm and the width of the <IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/alpha.gif">2/<IMG SRC="/pubs/journals/Symbols/gamma.gif"> laths was -0.3mm.

CHARACTERISATION OF A Ti-48AJ-2Nb-2Cr ALLOY SYNTHESIZED FROM MIXED GAS ATOMIZED AND MECHANICALLY ALLOYED POWDERS:</B> O.N. Senkov, N. Srisukhumbowarnchai, M.L Ovecoglu*, N. Hoo, C.C. Ward-Close**, P.

Gamma TiA1 based compacts were synthesized by hot isostatic pressing (HIP'ing) a mixture of pre-alloyed Ti-48A1-2Nb-2Cr gas atomized and mechanically alloyed powders. Mechanical alloying of the initial powder was performed in a SPEX mill for 15 hours. HIP'ing was conducted at 850&#176;C under 206 MPa pressure. Two different volume proportions of the gas atomized and mechanically alloyed powders were utilized in the HIP'ing process. This allowed production of microstructures in HIP'd compacts: a homogeneous nanocrystalline structures, when 100% mechanically alloyed powder was used, and a bimodal structure consisted of the mixture of micron-sized and nono-sized grains, when the compacts were HIP'd from a blend of the gas atomized and mechanically alloyed powders. Evolution of the microstructure during mechanical alloying and HIP'ing was studied by XRD, SEM and TEM techniques.

FLOW AND COOLING CHARACTERISTICS OF AL-SI DROPLETS/PARTICLES DURING GAS ATOMIZATION</B>: Seong-Yeon Yoo, Sang-Yoon Lee; Rapidly Solidified Materials Research Center, Department of Mechanical Design Engineering, Chungnam National University, Taejon, 305-764, KOREA
<P>
There are two important parameters in gas atomization - particle size and cooling rate. These two parameters are mainly controlled by gas flow and heat transfer between gas and droplets/particles. The purpose of this research is to investigate flow structure, cooling rate and trajectory of Al-Si droplets/particles by numerical simulation. Gas flow is simulated using finite volume method, and particle trajectory is simulated using Eulerian method. Rosin-Rammler formula is used for the particle size distribution. Gas field influences particle trajectory, reversely particles alter the gas field. So momentum and heat exchange between gas and particles are calculated by iterative method. Particle trajectory is found to depend on particle size, the location of particle formation, and turbulent motion of gas. Cooling rate of particles is calculated by taking into account latent heat of melt and local heat transfer between particle and gas. Small particle cools down rapidly, while large diameter particles solidifies very slowly.

PREPARATION OF Ti POWDER BY A MECHANICAL MILLING INDUCED REDUCTION REACTION: </B>E.G. Baburaj, Kevin T. Hubert, Carl Powell, C. Suryanarayana, and F.H. Froes, IMAP, University of Idaho, Moscow, ID 83844-3026
<P>
A displacement reaction between TiC14and Mg, induced by mechanical milling, has been employed for preparation of fine Ti powder. The present work shows the possibility of considerable reduction in milling time by the use of pre-milled Mg which enhances the reactivity due to an increase in surface area and surface activity. The milled product has been leached repeatedly to obtaining pure Ti. The reaction products before and after leaching have been examined by XRD, SEM, and TEM. The product after leaching, as determined by XRD is pure Ti. The particle size, as observed by TEM is in the range of 5-200nm. The EDX analysis of individual crystals or agglomerates using TEM, does not show the presence of chloride. Small amount of oxygen and nitrogen as impurities have been detected. Further work on the analysis of the powder is in progress.

MICROSTRUCTURE-PROPERTY STUDIES IN AL-8Fe-4Ni-2 5Zr ALLOYS:</B> P. Keramidas, P. Tsakiropoulos; Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey GU2 5XH, England, UK

The microstructures of shill cast ingots, gas atomised powders and extruded bars of Al-8Fe-4Ni-2.5Zr (wt%) were studied. Phase selection in the wedge shaped ingots and in the gas atomised powder particles will be discussed. The microstructures of the as extruded and heat treated alloy will be presented and related to the hardness, tensile properties and texture of the alloy.

STRUCTURE AND PROPERTIES OF RAPIDLY SOLIDIFIED Al-Li-Cu-Mg ALLOYS CONTAINING Zr AND Ag</B>: V.G. Pushin, L.I. Kaigorodova, E.I. Selnikhina, Institute of Metal Physics, Ural Division of Russian Academy of Sciences, +1620219, +0+1 Ekaterinburg, Russia
<P>
Rapidly solidified Al-Li-Cu-Mg alloys prepared by argon atomization process were investigated. Using cold compaction and canning, the powder was hot extruded into a bar of diameter 17 mm. Compared with traditional ingot metallurgy alloys, the microstructure and properties of rapidly solidified powder metallurgy alloys has been significantly improved. The effects of adding minor Zr, Ag or rare earth (RE) Nd and La on the Al-Li-Cu-Mg alloys are different. Minor Zr and Ag can efficiently accelerate the ageing process and increase the strength and hardness of alloys. Minor RE raises the ductility. The microstructure of alloys forms due to precipitation process of metastable binary phase Al(3)Li, ternary Tl-phase Al(2)CuLi with hexagonal crystal structure, and also tetragonal metastable phases on base of Al(2)Cu. These three coexistent channels of phase transformations are responsible for strengthening of alloys during subsequent ageing. The particle size of atomized powder for alloys was in the range of 10-150nm, but after optimal thermo-mechanical treatments the microstructure of alloys has been significantly dispersed and more refined. The grains are more homogeneous and have a nano-scale size on the average. In this state particles of this phase has a globula form and preferably heterogenuons nucleation at consequent aging.

REACTIVE PROCESSING OF ALUMINIUM METAL-MATRIX COMPOSITES:</B> M.J. Capaldi1, J.L.F Kellie2, and J.V. Wood1, 1Department of Materials Engineering and Materials Design, University of Nottingham, UK; 2 London &amp; Scandinavian Metallurgical Co Ltd, Rotherham, UK<P>
Two distinct processes have been used to produce in situ reactions in aluminium in order to form composites with varying amounts and types of additive. The first involves fluoride salt reactions which result in the production of TiB2 particulate finely distributed in a wide range of aluminium base alloys (both cast and wrought). The particulate concentration is limited to about 12 vol% before problems of inclusion entrapment and porosity become evident. Brief details of the process and properties after conventional and pressure die casting will be reported. The second process uses a self-propagating high temperature synthesis reaction to make carbides, nitrides, borides or mixtures. A particular reaction to be reported will be for A1+TiC. Details of the SHS reactions involved will be correlated with processibility and properties.

REACTIVE MILLING AND SINTERING OF ALUMINIUM BASE POWDER METALLURGY COMPONENTS</B>: C.C. Degnan, J.V. Wood, Department of Materials Engineering and Materials Design University of Nottingham, UK<P>
A form of mechanical alloying has been employed to create a range of structures in aluminium +X powders. The emphasis has been on partial mixing so that the energy of mixing can subsequently be utilised during sintering. A similar process has been employed to make intermetallica and sintering aids. The prime objective of the work is to allow conventional pressing and sintering to be employed for making high strength structurally sound powder metallurgy components.

THERMOMECHANICAL STUDY IN COMBUSTION SYNTHESIZED Ti-Ni SHAPE MEMORY ALLOY:</B> F.M.H. Zarandi, K. Sadrnezhaad, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran 11365-9466<P>
The thermal explosion mode of self-propagating high-temperature synthesis, by which time and energy can be saved and the cast product has the least interstitial contamination and high homogeneity, is used to successfully producing Ti-Ni shape memory alloys. The specimens, after hot and cold rolling, are solution treated and aged. The Rhombohedral(R)-phase transformation is observed in the Ti-50.03 at%Ni alloy. MS(1) and TR(2) have their maximums at aging temperatures of 773 and 723 k, respectively, and rise with Ni-contents. The rate of rising of TR, in aged specimens, depends on the composition and in the Ti-50.33 at%Ni alloy, in spite of the Ti-50.23 at%No alloy, MSis more than AS(3).After cold rolling of solution treated specimens, more than 50 percent reduction in thickness, and aging treatment the rate of variations of MSand AS versus aging temperature decreases and up to aging temperature of 723 k, TR is higher than that is in the not cold worked specimens. Also variations of MSwith amount of old working strains does not show uniform behaviour. All Round Shape Memory Effect occurs completely in the Ti-50.33 at%Ni alloy. 1: Start temperature of martensitic transformation; 2: Start temperature of R-phase transformation; 3: Start temperature of reverse martensitic transformation.

STRUCTURAL METAL FOAMS FROM BONDED ALUMINIUM ALLOY HOLLOW SPHERES:</B> N.E. Naxter, J.K. Cochran, T.H. Sanders Jr., Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA 30332-0245<P>
The demand for ultra low density structural materials that are economical is increasing. The feasibility of bonding monosized hollow spheres at points of contact to fabricate net-shaped foams with isotropic properties has been demonstrated. Currently, research efforts are focusing on adapting existing technology developed at Georgia Tech to fabricated low density hollow metal spheres. Spheres are fabricated directly from the melt using a coaxial nozzle process. Molten aluminium is injected through the outer orifice of the nozzle with gas passing through the centre orifice. As instabilities form on the liquid jet, surface tension serves to pinch off hollow monosized spheres Parameters such as melt and nozzle temperature, liquid and gas flow rates, and temperature gradient of the drop zone are controlled. As in-depth study relating sphere cooling rates to microstructural evolution and corresponding mechanical properties has been undertaken and the results of these investigations will be the subject of this presentation.

EFFECT OF THE FABRICATION METHOD ON THE AGING BEHAVIOR OF 6061 Al COMPOSITES REINFORCED WITH 20 VOL% SiC WHISKERS:</B> S. Ryu1, Y. Choi2, S.S. Cho3, H. Kwon3, S.I. Hong4, 1Tongyang Nylon Co. Ltd., Ulsari  Kyungnam, Korea; 2Sunmoon Univ., Asari, Chungnam, Korea; 3Kookmin University, Seoul, Korea; 4Chungnam National University, Taedok Science Town, Taejon, Korea
<P>
Age hardening behaviors of SiC whisker reinforced composites with 6061 Al matrix fabricated by powder metallurgy and squeeze casting were investigated to examine the effect of the fabrication method on the aging kinetics. In squeeze cast composite, numerous triangular particles which is believed to be MgAl2O4 were observed at Al/SiC interfaces whereas no visible interface particles were observed in P.M. composites. P.M. composites showed faster age hardening and reached the maximum hardness earlier than in squeeze cast composites. The decrease of the aging kinetics in squeeze cast 6061 Al matrix composites compared to that in P.M. composites is thought to result from more severe depletion of Mg atoms due to interfacial reactions in squeeze cast composites. The uniformity of whisker distribution is suggested to influence the general aging behavior through its effect on the local dislocation density. Data on the aging kinetics and the interfacial reactions in other Al alloys were also examined to study various factors which can influence the aging kinetics.

SOLIDIFICATION BEHAVIOURS AND POWDER MAKING MECHANISMS OF THE EMULSIFIED METALLIC POWDERS:</B> Chang-ki Min, Kyong-tae Nam, <I>Woo-young Yoon</I>, RASOM, Dept. of Metallurgical Engineering, Korea University, 1,5 Ka, Anam-dong, Sungbuk-ku, Seoul, 136-701, Korea
<P>
New metallic powder making processes, named &quot;Centrifugal Emulsification Process (CEP)&quot; and &quot;Mixer and Settler (MS)&quot; have been developed to synthesize rapid solidified metallic powders. The underlying principle of CEP and mS was to emulsificate the liquid metals with inorganic oil (or salt) using centrifugal force. Through CEP and mS processings, the high temperature metals as well as the low temperature alloys are fabricated. The mean particle size and size distribution could be controlled by various processing parameters that could be managed easily. The morphology of the particles could also be customized using spherodization vs. Solidification time ratio in CEP. The powder formation mechanisms in CEP and MS were rationalised through the energy balance between the input energy by centrifugal force and the increment of total surface energy of metallic liquids. The calculated mean size of powders agrees relatively well with that of the experiments. Also, the effects of rapid solidification undercooling, solidification rate and crystallisation behaviours can be evaluated effectively through the processes. The possibility of the customised not only size and morphology control but microstructure control was also shown. Both of the new methods can be applied to continuous powder making processes without oxygen contamination.

Ti-6A1-4V HOLLOW SPHERE FOAMS:</B> <I>C. Uslu</I>, J.K. Cochran, K.J. Lee* and T.H. Sanders, Jr, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA 30332-0245: *Ceramic Fillers, Inc., Atlanta, GA 30318<P>
Structural foams, formed to near-net-shape by bonding monoxides hollow metal spheres at points of contact, offer the possibility of strong, light-weight, reasonably priced materials. The technology of making titanium hollow sphere foams has been developed using the coaxial nozzle powder slurry technique. Titanium hydride hollow powder spheres of 3 mm diameter and 20 mm wall thickness were fabricated from a high solids content acetone slurry. The powder shells were controlled atmosphere sintered and point contact bonded using the initial alloy hydride powder to form hollow sphere foams that were 20% of theoretical density. The sphere wall microstructures obtained by pressureless, solid-state sintering of the hydride alloy were compared to the conventional alloy microstructures and quantitative measures of sintering kinetics were established. Initial mechanical properties such as compressive yield strength and modulus will also be considered.

METAL FOAMS FROM FUGITIVE BURNOUT:</B> <I>A.R. Nagel</I>, J.K. Cochran, T.H. Sanders, Jr, K.J. Lee*; MSE-Georgia Institute of Tech Atlanta GA, 30332-0253; Ceramic Fillers Inc., Atlanta, GA<P>
Metallic foams are being made from powders using naturally occurring organic fugitive burnout material. Most forms are fabricated by introducing pores from a gas phase into a liquid system. This tends to produce pores of irregular cell size due to pore coalescence. The object of this effort is to introduce porosity utilising a fugitive solid phase to allow greater precision in forming pore systems. The foams being investigated are nickel and titanium alloys formed from slurries with starches as the fugitive materials. Starches are inexpensive and clean burning sacrificial materials. Because replication of fugitive starches requires fine particle size powders, brittle precursor powders (i.e. metal hydrides or oxides) are initially used to form the foam and subsequently decomposed or reduced to form metallic foams. Using particle packing and theological theories, the percolation value of closed cell porosity should be increased, and the microstructure of the foam should be made more uniform. Porosity and mechanical properties are being characterised for comparison to other forma geometries.

MODELING AND CONSOLIDATION OF NANOCRYSTALLINE ALUMINUM:</B> J.S. Idasetima, R.B. Bhagat, M.F. Amateau, The Pennsylvania State University, Applied Research Laboratory, Box 30, New ARL Building, State College, PA 16804
<P>
The consolidation of nanograined powder metals presents a major problem of grain growth to micrometer size thereby lowering the potential benefits expected of the nanocrystalline microstructures. The aim of this investigation is two fold: (a) to present our results of consolidating nanograined alumium powder in conjunction with process modeling using Ashby's HIP program. The preliminary modeling results suggest that the nanograined aluminum powder can be consolidated into full density with minimal grain growth without using any grain growth inhibitor by optimizing combined sintering and vacuum hot pressing. The predicted hot pressing temperature for aluminum nanopowders (20-200 nm) ranges from 300 to 400 K for a fixed pressure of 19 MPa; time being less than 10 minutes. Boundary diffusion mechanisms dominate in both stage 1 and stage 2 of the densification. The as-received nonograined powder and the fabricated specimens have been characterized by optical, scanning, and transmission electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction and microprobe analysis. Density and microhardness of the consolidated specimens are also reported and discussed.

SPRAY FOAMING OF HIGH PERFORMANCE ALUMINIUM GOES FOR VOLUME PRODUCTION:</B> <I>Klaus Hummert</I>, PEAK Werkstroff GmbH, Velbert, Germany
<P>
Very recently the major break-through in spray forming of high performance aluminium has been achieved. After many years of intensive alloy and process development, the first long time volume application could be realised. The use of PM aluminium for cylinder liners in gasoline passenger car engines gives strong improvements in the system of piston, piston rings and liner running surface. Furthermore the engine emissions have been reduced drastically. Based on the progress made with respect to technical and economical aspects this first volume production will have great impact on other application in automotive and aircraft industries or for leisure equipment. The paper describes the state of the art spray forming of aluminium based alloys under technical and metallurgical aspects. Examples will be given several applications in different market sections with functionally relevant test results. Finally the economical situation of spray forming will be discussed in comparison to competitive technologies.

FABRICATION OF LOWER THERMAL EXPANSION ALUMINIUM ALLOYS BY SPRAY-CASING PROCESS</B>: Chong-Sung Park, Hyun-Hp Park, <I>Myung-Ho Kim</I>, R.A.S.O.M., Department of Metallurgical Engineering, Inha University, Inchon 402-751, Korea
<P>
Spray-casting process is becoming increasingly attractive as an alternate production route for particulate reinforced metal matrix composites, and the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of the composites can be controlled by altering the level of reinforcement. In this study, performs of Al-Si matrix composites reinforced with SiCp were fabricated by spray-casting process, and the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of the composites were investigated using thermal mechanical analysis (TMA) after hot-extruded. It was found that the CTE of the composite with SiCp reduced with increase in volume fraction of SiC particles, and the Al-Si performs without SiCp also exhibited reduced CTE compared to mold-cast specimen. The effect of the grain and Si phase size, and the aspect ratio of Si phase, as well as the volume fraction of the SiCp on the CTE of the Al-Si composite have also been examined.

PRODUCTION OF CONTINUOUS POLYCRYSTALLINE Al-Cu RIBBONS BY PLANAR FLOW CASTING AND SOLIDIFICATION STRUCTURES:</B> Department of Metallurgical Engineering, Yonseu University, 134 Shinchon-dong, Seodaemun-gu, Scoul, Korea
<P>
The geometry and microstructures of ribbons spun by planar flow casting have been investigated as functions of processing parameters adapting various kinds of crucial material and slot design. Microstructural transitions from segregation free zones to cellular/dendrite regions increased with increasing wheel velocity and the superheat of molten metal before ejection. X-ray diffraction spectra indicated an increasing tendency towards a (200) preferred orientation on the wheel-side surface of the ribbon with increasing the superheat of molten metal. A model based on a two-dimensional cellular automaton technique coupled with the control volume method was developed for the prediction of dendrite grain structures in planar flow casting. The calculated grain structures were in good agreement with those obtained from experimentation.

<P>
The CET(Columnar-Equiaxed Transition) of solidification structures in squeeze casting of Al-Cu alloys was investigated. The interfacial heat transfer coefficient between the casting and the mold was evaluated using an inverse problem method. Solidification sequences in squeeze casting were simulated using the calculated interfacial heat transfer coefficients. The cellular automaton coupled with the control volume method was developed for the predication of solidification grain structures and was applied to evaluate the CET in squeeze casting. The effects of casting process variables, such as pressure, pouring temperature, mold temperature and inoculation on the CET in squeeze casting were investigated. The solidification parameters, solidification rate and thermal gradient at the solidification front, were also analyzed in regard to their effects on the CET. The calculated results were also compared with those obtained experimentally.

SEMI-SOLID PROCESSING OF A356 Al ALLOYS:</B> C.P. Chen, <I>C.-Y.A. Tsao</I>, Department of Materials Science and Engineering National Cheng-Kung University Tainan, Taiwan
<P>
A356 Al alloys were synthesised and processed in the semi-solid state. The alloys with a non-dendrite structure were synthesised via electromagnetic stirring in the semi-solid state and then subsequently cast into billet form. The billets with non-dendrite structure were then reheated to semi-solid re gime and isothermally upset-deformed. The effects of the solid fraction during semi-solid deformation, deformation rate, and deformation temperature on the morphology, macrostructure, and stress-strain relationships of semi-solid deformed billets were investigated and compared to those of conventional deformed billets. A phenomenological model was developed to help explain the different behaviours of the semi-solid deformed billets.

<P>
Nanocrystalline Fe powder has been produced from 1-4 mm size initial powder, using non-transferred arc plasma processing. Both the processed and initial powders have been consolidated by HIPing at different temperatures to determine the lowest possible processing temperature-time combination which gives rise to full densification. The fine powders and consolidation products have been characterised in detail for particle size, structure and morphology by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and the results have been used as feed-back to improve the processing conditions. The particle size of plasma processed Fe powered is in the range of 10-50 nm. The temperature dependent grain growth of plasma processed and starting Fe powders have also been examined in this study.

STUDY OF MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROPERTIES OF SPRAY FORMED Al-Cr-Zr ALLOYS:</B> A.F. Norman, <I>P. Tsakiropoulos</I>, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey GU2 5XH, UK
<P>
The technical problems and cost associated with the multi-step PM processing of RS Al alloys have hindered their successful development. Spray forming can obviate these problems by means of the integral inert gas atomisation and deposition operation in which the alloy exists in particulate form only for a few milliseconds. Spray forming experiments have been performed on Al-Cr-Zr alloys studied previously by the combined RS/PM route. The microstructure and the tensile properties of the forged and heat treated deposits will be compared with the RS/PM alloy. The latter exhibits superior properties, not matched by the spray formed alloy.

EFFECT OF ALLOY ELEMENTS ON THE DAMPING CAPACITY OF SPRAY CAST Al-Zn ALLOY:</B> B.C. Moon, Z.H. Lee, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, RASOM, Kaist, Korea
<P>
Damping capacity of a material refers its ability to dissipate vibrational energy into thermal energy. In Al-Zn system, damping originates form the interfacial friction between two phases and the damping capacity is proportional to the interfacial area. The microstructure of spray cast alloys are very different from the cast alloys and the damping characteristics of spray cast Al-Zn alloys is expected to be also different. In this study, the effect of third element on the damping behaviour of spray cast Al-Zn alloys was studied. Al-Zn-X alloys were made by spray cast and mold cast. Third elements were Cu, Mg and Mn. Uniformly rolled cast and sprayed specimens were solution treated then quenched by water. Specimens were aged at room temperature for 24 hours. Damping capacity was measured by logarithmic decrement of freely decayed vibration of cantilever beam. Damping capacity of spray cast alloys was higher than cast alloys. Dilute tried elements increased the hardness but decreased the damping capacity alightly.

The geometry and microstructures of ribbons spun by planar flow casting have been investigated as functions of processing parameters adapting various kinds of crucible material and slot design. Microstructural transitions from segregation free zones to cellular/dendritic regions were obsened in Al-Cu alloys. The thickness ratio of columnar layer increased with increasing the wheel velocity and the superheat of molten metal before ejection. X-ray diffraction spectra indicated an increasing tendency towards a (200) preferred orientation on the wheel-side surface of the ribbon with increasing the superheat of molten metal. A model based on a two dimensional cellular automaton technique coupled with the control volume method was developed for the prediction of dendritic grain structures in planar flow casting.

OPERATING PARAMETERS FOR THE CONTINUOUS UNIDIRECTIONAL SOLIDIFICATION OF A 1% Si ALUMINUM ALLOY DRAWN TO FINE WIRE:</B> M.H. Kim, Chungbuk National University and RASOM, Cheongju Korea; <I>T.S. Song</I>, Chungbuk National University, Cheongju, Korea; H.H. Jo, Korea Academy of Industrial Technology, Incheon, Korea; C.S. Kang, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea; C.R. Loper, Jr., The University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI
<P>
Previous studies have demonstrated the technique of producing continuous cast, directionally solidified castings of a limited number of alloys. These procedures have been successful when the casting conditions are established so that the solid-liquid interface is maintained outside of the mold by insuring a mold temperature in excess of the liquidus temperature and a solid-liquid interface located near enough to the mold so that the molten metal surface tension is able to support the liquid phase. Rods varying from 3 to 10 mm. (0.12 to 0.39 in.) D. have been successfully cast in this manner. This study has expanded that technique to a 1% Si aluminum alloy, and the casting, and the casting conditions which would enable production of an 8 mm. (0.31 in). D. rod having a mirror surface with a highly longitudinally oriented microstructure have established. Furthermore it was demonstrated that this alloy could be wire drawn, without the need of intermediate recrystallization or stress relief, to produce wires of 0.14 to 0.10 mm. (0.0055 to 0.0039 in) D. <P>

WASTE DISPOSAL BY RESIDUE RECYCLING AT KGHM POLSKA MIEDZ SA:</B> <I>Helena Byrdziak,</I> Jerzy Dobrzanski, Jan Garbaczewski, Janusz Piatkowski, KGHM Polska Miedz SA, P-59300 Lubin, Ul. Sklodowskiej 48, Poland
<P>
KGHM Polska Miedz SA, existing since seventies, operates three underground mines and three smelters with local production of over 400,000 mtpy of electrolytic copper. Its impact on the environment, very serious in the past, has been gradually reduced, In general, recently emission into the air and water has been put under control. Nowadays tailings and residues disposal has turned to be the subject of first environmental importance. The total bulk of tailings is enormous as copper ore contains only about 2% of copper, so 98% of extracted material must be disposed gradually in each step of technology. The main Streams are tailings from the flotation, slags, captured dust from dedusting systems and gaseous compounds like SO2 and CO. Much effort has already been done and is still being done to utilize them for by-products production or to dispose them within the process by recycling. The most effective measures taken up so far and present activity towards waste disposal are presented.

RECYCLING OF PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARDS BY SMELTING WITH OXIDIZING/REDUCING TOP BLOWING PROCESS</B>: Andrea Bernardes,<I> Isrun Bohlinger, </I>Diosnel Rodriguez, Wolfgang Wuth, Technical University Berlin, Institute of Metalllurgy, Strabe des 17. Juni 135, D-10623 Berlin, Germany
<P>
Printed circuit boards (PCBs) of varying compositions have been converted by incineration, followed by smelting to an environmentally stable slag and a copper-nickel-tin alloy, containing the precious metals. The environmentally compatibility of the slag was established according to the German Standard DIN 38414, Part 4. The concentration of toxic elements in the lixiviates was found to be lower than the threshold value for drinking water (CE-Standards). In each experiment the charge was 500 g scrap from PCBs and 100 g flux. The products were a king of mullite slag, poor in iron, which was recirculated, and an alloy containing up to 0.3% gold. With a burner the process gas was combusted without soot formation and the generated mixed zinc-lead oxide fume containing silver was separated as flue dust.

COPPER FROM COPPER BEARING SCRAP, A MOVING TARGET:</B> Albert W. Spitz, <I>Robert A. Spitz</I>, Michael Saltzburg, 560 Bedford St., B-12, Abington, MA 02351
<P>
Profitably recovering copper and precious metals from copper bearing scrap is a demanding and frustrating combination of art, science and economics. With fluctuating markets, varying raw materials and increasingly stringent environmental regulations requiring process revisions, practically everything is changing. The volatile copper market constantly shifts the percentage of copper in the scrap that can be economically processed. Scrap that has value one day may incur a disposal cost the following day. Also with less copper in the scrap, more residuals, slag, fume, etc. are generated which frequently present disposal problems and infrequently generate income. The ever increasing amounts of electronic scrap add value to the copper produced by virtue of the precious metals present. Printed circuit board materials create more slag and organic off gases which must be treated. Finally, the emphasis on reducing emissions of organics and other metals, especially lead, is a continuing challenge. Stack gases, fugitive emissions and ambient air quality all demand constant surveillance.

CHANGES IN THE DUST HANDLING SYSTEM AT HUDSON BAY MINING &amp; SMELTING CO., LTD: </B><I>Keith McTaggart</I>, Hudson Bay Mining &amp; Smelting Co., Ltd, P.O. Box 1500, Flin Flon, Manitoba R&amp;A 1N9, Canada
<P>
The waste gas cleaning system of the Hudson Bay Mining &amp; Smelting copper smelter in Flin Flon, MB, consists of an electrostatic precipitator followed by a baghouse. These units collect the copper and zinc bearing dusts, respectively, from the gas streams of the reberberatory furnace and Pierce-Smith converting furnaces. A process change in 1993 led to the rapid destruction of the existing baghouse fibreglass filter bags, shortening their life-span from 15 to 3 months. A decision was made in September 1994 to replace this type of filter media with an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane filter supplied by W.L. Gore Associates, Inc. Following the original installation a dramatic increase in dust capture was observed, however high pressure drops across the filter material lead to decreased flow through the off-gas handling system, limiting ventilation of the process. This increase in pressure drop across the PTFE bags was a function of the PTFE material and the inability of the baghouse shaker system to release the dust layer from the PTFE bags. Recently acoustic horns have been tested as a replacement to the shaker cleaning mechanism. Preliminary results indicate a dramatic reduction in pressure drop across the bags and a subsequent increase in process ventilation. This allows for fewer production interruptions caused by fugitive process emissions. The final acoustic horn results will be presented.

THE ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS OF AUSMELT TECHNOLGY IN SECONDARY COPPER SMELTING AND CONVERTING:</B> Edward N. Mounsey, Ausmelt Ltd., 12 Kitchen Rd., Dandenong 3175, Victoria, Australia; Norbert L. Piret, Piret &amp; Stolberg Partners, Im Licht 12, D-47279 Duisburg, Germany
<P>
The requirements to smelt secondary copper more economically, to process a wide range of materials with large fluctuation in size and composition and to cope with the increasingly stringent environmental constraints have put considerable pressure on existing conventional secondary copper smelters. The Top Submerged Lance (TSL) process, developed and commercialized by Ausmelt Ltd over the past 20 years, offers a low cost technology, which is particularly suitable for the treatment of copper-bearing scrap and residues, because of its low investment, use of cheap fuel and reductant, high rate of recovery of metals and low slag losses, potential use of oxygen, high flexibility with regard to feed material, applicability to high and low throughputs, absence of dioxins in the process gas, simplicity of handling of feed, process gas and slags. This presentation outlines the application of Ausmelt technology in secondary copper smelting, producing converter grade copper ready for anode furnacing, both for a new installation and for a retrofit of the smelting or converting stage of an existing smelter. The economic and environmental benefits of its application are highlighted.

METALLURGICAL UTILISATION OF REUSABLE PRODUCTS FROM THE RECYCLING INDUSTRY IN A SECONDARY COPPER SMELTER:</B> <I>Andreas Nolte</I>, Huttenwerke Kayser AG (HK) Postfach 15 60, D-44505, Lunen, Germany
<P>
This paper includes a comprehensive report about the metallurgical utilisation of reusable products from the electronic scrap recycling, car scrapping industry, used glasses and various waste products such as for example slimes and flue dusts in a secondary copper smelter. Dependent on the copper content, the existing copper compound and further aspects of the additional material content, the materials are treated in reducing and oxidizing furnace operations. HK's pyro- and hydrometallurgical processes, blast furnaces, converters, anode furnaces, tin lead alloy plant and tankhouse will be explained. The treated reusable products are structured according to the origin of the materials and then presented in quantity and quality balances. Processing methods, processable quantities and required qualities of the reusable products are described. The utilization degree of the most important metals (copper, tin lead and zinc) is described with graphics. The report is rounded by information on operating licence according to the emission protection regulations of the Federal Republic of Germany and informations concerning supply and contracts.

ASPECTS OF IMPURITIES CONTROL AT CARAIBA METALS ELECTROREFINERY:</B> <I>Jose Luiz Rodrigues Bravo</I>, Caralba Metais S.A.(CMSA), Via do Cobre N&#176; 3700, A.l.O. - Copec, Dias D'Avila - Bahia - Brazil
<P>
The production of electrolytic copper with assured quality corresponding to international standards in a conventional electrorefinery of a custom smelter, is a hard and cautious task, if no advanced technologies for selective control of electrolyte impurities are available. The improper control of the amount of As, Sb and Bi in the anode that enter de tankhouse, attributable either to a bad schedule of concentrate input or to the unavailability of clean concentrates from the international market, as well as the lack of means to maintain the suitable level of these elements in the electrolyte together with other operational circumstances, can result in off-grade copper, as well as affect the starting sheet quality chemically and physically. This paper presents in a practical way the relationship between the operational conditions and the cathode and starting sheet quality produced at CMSA, covering the period of the last five years of operation, discusses the technologies available in the market for antimony and bismuth removal and compares the results of testwork, achieved in the laboratories of CMSA, using two resins not associated with patented technologies.

REMOVAL OF ANTIMONY AND BISMUTH FROM COPPER ELECTROLYTE DEVELOPMENT OF A COMMERCIAL PLANT AT AMARILLO COPPER REFINERY:</B> <I>R.M. Cunningham</I>, Asarco Inc, Amarillo, TX; J.V. Calara &amp; M.K. King, Asarco Technical Services Center, Salt Lake City, UT
<P>
Asarco operates one of the largest individual copper electrorefineries in the world at Amarillo, Texas. The feed is a mixture of anodes from Asarco smelters and copper purchased from various primary and secondary sources. The variation in feed makes it imperative that the refinery practices state-of-the-art quality control to minimize the effects of unwanted impurities. In late 1993, a plant designed to significantly reduce the antimony and bismuth levels in the electrolyte was commissioned. The purification plant uses ion exchange technology in conjunction with a novel stripping system developed by Zeneca Specialties, which permits the recycling of the eluant. Thereby, the extremely high costs of stripping with conventional reagents are avoided. In addition, the environmental impact of treating the eluant for recovery of antimony and bismuth is minimized. This paper outlines the development of the technology and, in particular, describes the operational practices and improvements at Amarillo since the commissioning of the plant.

BLEED-OFF TREATMENT OF HK-SECONDARY COPPER ELECTROREFINERY:</B> <I>Dr. R.F. Dobner</I>, Huttenwerke Kayser AG, Posffach 1560, D44505 Lunen
<P>
After a short introduction of the electrolysis process at HK and explanations concerning the anodes used, the regulation and buffering of bleed will be described and the principles of technology for processing of bleed will be presented. Modernization aspects, especially installation equipment, and the different types of evaporators used will be described in detail. Besides experience made with acid-resistant materials - stainless steel, enamel, plastics - will be reported. Environmental aspects such as water and air pollution will be outlined briefly and in conclusion the quality of products obtained as well as quality control will be presented.

PROCESS OPTIONS IN THE TREATMENT OF COPPER REFINERY ELECTROLYTE BLEED:</B> <I>James E. Hoffmann</I>, Jan H. Reimers &amp; Associates USA Co., P.O. Box 420545, Houston, TX
<P>
This paper will briefly review the conventional technologies employed for the treatment of copper refinery electrolyte bleed. The distinction between decopperizing and electrolyte purification will be emphasized. The strengths and weaknesses of conventional practice will be reviewed and a number of process options to address the weaknesses of present process technology will be described and evaluated. The effect of process selection upon energy consumption and the environmental aspects of process effluent control will be discussed.

IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF THE NICKEL SULFATE HEXAHYDRATE PRODUCED AT CARAIBA BY APPLYING THE QUALITY FUNCTION DEPLOYMENT METHOD (Q.F.D.):</B> <I>Ivan Marcelo Santos Moraes</I> and Group of Q.F.D., Caraiba Metais S.A., Via do Cobre N&#176; 3700, A.l.O. - Copec, Dias D'Avila - Bahia Brazil, CEP 42800-000
<P>
Caraiba Metais has a plant for the purification and the crystallization of the crude nickel sulfate removed from its copper electrolyte purification system. In November 1994, an interdepartmental group was formed to study the Q.F.D method, through its application on the improvement of the quality of the nickel sulfate hexahydrate. The team, formed with representatives of the following areas: production, technology, marketing, sales, maintenance, laboratory and TQC office, had also the task of checking the applicability of the method to other products of the company. This paper describes the main steps such as the survey of customer's demands, the preparation of the quality matrix, the planned and the designed quality and the consequent identification of the engineering bottlenecks. It is also shown how these bottlenecks were studied and solved. The application of the method allowed the team to identify means of increasing the production capacity by 40%, to improve the intrinsic quality of the product (including packaging), and to increase the reliability of the process.

COPPER SULFATE RECOVERY USING FLUIDIZED BED CRYSTALLIZATION:</B> Martin Schranz, <I>Robert J. Farrell</I>, Swenson Process Equipment Inc., 15700 Lathrop Ave., Harvey, IL 60426
<P>
Copper sulfate pentahydrate is recovered from the spent etchant waste stream of a printed circuit/wiring board manufacturing facility. The fluidized bed crystallizer contains submerged cooling surfaces (through which a coolant is passed) which are bathed in a stream of air. The air bubbles provide agitation which improve heat transfer, reduce fouling and maintain crystals in suspension. The recently patented fluidized bed crystallization apparatus (US 5,523,064) has significant advantages when compared to a conventional surface cooled crystallizer including capital cost, ease of operation and production of larger more uniform crystals.

Can you design a low-cost, high-performance, lightweight composite? If you think you can, the <A HREF="/Society/MDMD.html">Materials Design &amp; Manufacturing Division</A> (MDMD) of <A HREF="/TMSHome.html">The Minerals, Metals &amp; Materials Society</A> (TMS) has a challenge for you--to design and fabricate your own composite material to compete in an international undergraduate materials contest. A win could eliminate the need to ever have to work again, or at the very least, look excellent on your resume!

<P>
Mission Implausible? Materials scientists, engineers and designers are engaged in a quest for the next generation of structural materials for use in extreme conditions, for example those found at the core of power generating devices such as gas turbine engines. The reigning champions in this no-man's land of materials are the superalloys--highly sophisticated, metallic materials offering great strength, yet able to deform without fracture. However, the potential performance of the superalloys may be nearing exhaustion with increasing years of effort invested for each incremental improvement. Ceramics are highly attractive because they're light and because of their excellent strength at high temperatures. Unfortunately, they are still to unreliable and may fail catastrophically without warning. Composites may offer a means of achieving the best of both: the high strength and low density of a ceramic with the toughness of a metal. But with the limitless possibilities for ways in which materials may be combined comes the difficulty of finding the internal structure which provides the optimal balance of performance and weight and can be produced at low cost. This is where you come in...

<P>
<FONT SIZE="5"><B>The Materials Design (MaD) Contest</B></FONT>
<P>
The objective is to design and synthesize a composite using inexpensive, readily available materials as constituents and to produce several bend test samples for competition in a test of mechanical performance. While your composite material may not withstand the rigors of a gas turbine engine, the principles you will use in its design and manufacture and the factors determining its performance are the same ones as for high-temperature metal/ceramic composites.
<P>
You design the microstructure. Using any of a wide range of low-cost materials (an extensive selection of materials is available at any hardware store or building materials supplier) and your imagination, you synthesize your own material. You select the materials making up the matrix and any reinforcing phases (these may be of any geometry--its up to you) and design a process route resulting in a finished component having the required geometry (the dimensions of the bend beam testing samples is provided below). While the external design is ours, the internal design is yours--your choice of materials, the distribution, geometry and arrangement of any reinforcing phases and any microstructural changes (reactions, precipitation, interfacial reactions, crystallization, etc.) which might occur as a consequence of the processing route will determine the physical and mechanical properties of the composite you design. Elaborate laboratory equipment for processing is not required--in many cases, no processing equipment will be needed and in others, typically no more than a small furnace, an autoclave, or a hot press.
<P>
Materials should be ones available at a local building supply or hardware store. Commercial composite products such as carbon-fiber-reinforced plastics (as might be found in a tennis racket or golf club) may not be used.<P>

Optimal performance at minimal cost--your prototype material will be submitted in the form of rectangular bars having the dimensions, 0.5" x 0.5" x 8". The samples are then subjected to three-point bend testing to assess material performance--as a measure of this, the initial elastic modulus, breaking strength and the area beneath the load-displacement curve (a measure of the energy required to fracture) will be recorded. Since you are designing a structural (possibly aerospace) material, weight and cost are critical factors, so that performance goals must be achieved while constraining weight and cost.
<P>

The following formula will be used to provide a quantitative basis for comparing performance among entries:<P>

<H2>What It Takes to Win</H2>

Each team (or individual) will need to complete the official <A HREF="MaDEntryForm.pdf">MaD Contest Entry Form</A> by <B>June 30, 1997.</B> This form is downloadable as an <A HREF="http://www.adobe.com/acrobat/readstep.html">Adobe Acrobat</A> portable document format file. Alternatively, contact Vicki Koebnick, <A HREF="mailto:koebnick@tms.org">koebnick@tms.org</A>, for a copy of the form.<P>

At least one member of each competing team must be a <A HREF="/TMSHome.html">TMS</A> member at the time the contest entry is submitted. All students must be undergraduates. The competition itself requires two things: three samples for mechanical testing and a written report (7 pages or less). The three samples submitted for testing must comply with the specified geometry. (If samples are anisotropic, the plane of bending can be specified by the designer.) Receipts showing the date and place of purchase, the materials purchased and the amount paid must be provided by each competitor (or team)--these may be subject to verification by the judging committee. Weights of samples will be measured by the judging committee. The performance, S, of each sample will be determined and a final score given as the average of the results for the three samples tested.
<P>
The report should describe the microstructural design of the composite (possibly with the help of micrographs), the materials used and their weight and volume fractions, costs, etc. It should also discuss how the design was chosen--show any analysis tools (e.g., structure-property relationships) that were used as an aid in designing the composite. Describe the route used to process the composite and discuss how the process may have influenced the composite's performance. You may wish to describe results of your own mechanical performance testing or approaches that were tried, but which did not ultimately lead to a successful design. The creativity exercised in designing the composite (i.e., the consideration of novel approaches, materials selection, optimization strategy, etc.) will be given special importance when evaluating the written reports.
<P>
The final score will be based on both the results of mechanical testing and the written report:<P>

<H2>What It Pays to Win</H2>

A panel of judges will determine the top three entries (based on the results of performance tests and the written reports). These three finalists will then be invited to submit a further two material samples, which will be tested &quot;live&quot; (open to the public) during <A HREF="/Meetings/TMS-Fall-Meetings.html">Materials Week '97</A>. These results, combined with the previously obtained written reports, will then be used to determine the first and second place winners.

<H2>FLOWSHEET MODELING SOFTWARE FOR PROCESS ANALYSIS AND
DESIGN:  An Open Forum Presentation</H2>

<B>Presenter</B>: Arthur E. Morris<br>
<B>Forum Times</B>: Sunday, October 27, 1996,9:00 AM-11:00 PM or 1:30-3:30 PM<br>                

<b>Cost</b>: $30	<p>
<HR>
<b>Indicate your plans to  participate on the <A HREF="registration.html">Registration form</A>.</b><p>

The process engineer is increasingly called upon to develop models for
existing and conceptual flowsheets. This presentation is an opportunity to
become familiar with various software programs for process analysis and design,
and to see how such programs are applied to process engineering for the
minimization and treatment of waste. The session will begin with an
introduction to simple programs for reactor modeling, followed by
demonstrations of multireactor flowsheet modeling programs (Metsim and Pyrosim). Copies of software developed at UMR will be distributed free of charge. The presentation will not cover single-use software developed for repetitive calculations on a single process.<p>

The forum is planned to complement the technical program of the Symposium.
Effective process modeling can decrease the time required to develop processes
for treating and minimizing waste, and to modify processes in response to
changing regulations. The demonstrations will show for example how process
control strategies can be optimized to minimize either the amount of waste, or
the concentration of a hazardous substance in a waste stream.<p>

To give personal attention, each session is limited to 12 registrants, and the
presenter will remain after the session to answer individual questions. To
assure your place in the session, please register in advance. Additional
registration will be accepted on-site if space is available.<p>

<b>About the presenter:</b> Arthur E. Morris is Professor Emeritus of
Metallurgical Engineering at the University of Missouri-Rolla, and a staff
member of the Center for Pyrometallurgy at UMR. He has developed various
process modeling programs, and has directed four international conferences on
the application of computer software to extractive and process metallurgy. Dr.
Morris was co-presenter of Open-Forum presentations at the TMS Second International Symposium on Metallurgical Processes for the Year 2000 and Beyond Conference in 1994 and
the Third International Symposium on Recycling of Metals and Engineered
Materials in 1995.<p>

<b>About the course:</b><p>
This course is a perfect complement to the Symposium on Extraction &amp;
Processing for the Treatment &amp; Minimization of Wastes. Increasing
competition from alternative materials and awareness of environmental
sensitivities demand mining industries to seek opportunities from wastes and recyclables with
economic value and manage them using the best economically feasible and
environmentally available technologies. The course is intended to provide basic
understanding and overview of the various aspects of waste minimization
including recycling technologies that are either currently applied or hold potential for
application. <p>

Case studies from automotive and recycling industries on waste minimization
will be included. A panel discussion between the presenters and attendees on
all issues of concern will conclude this learning intensive course.<p>


<b>Who should attend:</b><p>
The course will be of particular interest to environmental managers,
plant operators, researchers and consultants.<p>

<TR>
<TD><FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=#8E2323><B>Richard S. Dennis</B>, a chemical engineering graduate of Lehigh University, has 23 years of experience in process development, design and operation of chemical and hydrometallurgical processes that utilize separation technologies. For the past 11 years, he has worked first with Advanced Separation Technologies, Inc. and now with TETRA Technologies, Inc. on continuous ion exchange applications for use in the chemical, mining and nuclear industries.</FONT></TD>
</TABLE>
<H3>Who Should Attend:</H3>
This course is designed for engineers, metallurgists and chemists who want to acquire a broader understanding of the capabilities of ion exchange resins in commercial applications and for those involved in the process development of separation processes.
<p>

<H3>Course Overview:</H3>
Ion exchange resins are best known for their use in water demineralization, softening or other forms of water purification. In mining, resins have been commercially used for the extraction of valuable metals, specifically gold and uranium. There are much broader applications for ion exchange than these relatively simple, low concentration separation processes, and advancements in resin quality, resin handling systems and process control have paved the way for commercialization of more complex processes.<P>

<H3>The general overview will cover:</H3>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>The basic structure of cation, anion and specialty resins
	<LI>Ion exchange capacities, rates and selectivities
	<LI>Resin regeneration, moisture content and deterioration
	<LI>Physical properties of resins--hydraulic properties, particle size, swelling, attrition, useful life, and feed solution characteristics
</UL>

<H3>The second portion of the course will deal with applications and design of ion exchange processes, such as:</H3>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Demineralization, purification, product recovery, selective separation and other uses
	<LI>Comparison with alternative separation processes: solvent extraction, precipitation, etc.
	<LI>Conventional and specialized resin handling systems
	<LI>Process design phases: project definition, preliminary economics, laboratory and pilot testing, commercial design and equipment selection
	<LI>Review of specific hydrometallurgical applications
</UL>

The Web is the hottest Internet service ever, but most companies and individuals make poor use of it. Learn how to find information and information providers through Internet search engines, develop a Web presence without bankrupting your company, and strategies that make sure others will find your Web site worthy of repeated visits. Find which sites have substantive content for materials professionals, and which are just glossy advertisements.<p>

<I><b>Section III: Netnews</b></I><BR>
Netnews is a global "chat room," and it is now possible to offend hundreds of thousands of users with a single message. Learn how to judge group "netiquette," to write a news message that gets responses, and when to take a discussion to email or a private mailing list.<p>

<I><b>Section IV: Getting Online</b></I><BR>
Online access is straightforward, but users still need to match their access level with their needs. Learn the differences between access through Internet service providers and online services, and the tradeoffs of different connection technologies.<p>

<I><b>Section V: Getting It Together</b></I><BR>
Where do you start? How do you justify Internet usage to your management? What special resources are available to materials professionals over the Internet? Learn the answers to these questions, and techniques for evaluating the effectiveness of your Internet activities.<p>

<H3>Who Should Attend:</H3>
The course is primarily targeted for process engineers and operating personnel responsible for improving and assuring the quality of molten aluminum prior to solidification. Specifically, this audience includes production supervisors and managers, quality assurance personnel, metallurgists, process engineers, and researchers engaged in the production of quality aluminum castings.
<p>
<H3>Course Overview:</H3>
Approximately one half of the syllabus is dedicated to presenting the underlying physiochemical principles that govern molten aluminum treatment operation. A perspective is given on reactions stoichiometry, thermodynamics and kinetics, oxidation mechanics, and relevant transport phenomena.<P>
Next, these fundamental principles are applied to the formation and removal mechanisms of impurities in molten aluminum. Finally, the selection, description, and operation of commercial fluxing and filtration processes will be discussed including the topics of molten metal quality monitoring and specific issues relating to metal treatment in foundry operations. A course manual is provided that will serve as a desk reference in the field.<p>

<I><b>When:</B> Tuesday, February 11, 12:00 Noon</I><BR>
<I><B>Location:</B> Grand Ballroom D, Clarion Plaza Hotel</I><P>

<FONT SIZE=4><B>About the Topic:</B></FONT><BR>
The talk will focus on the goals for new process development for any new metallurgical process and how they have been applied to the design of a new energy efficient and environmentally friendly process for making steel from iron ore using iron carbide as the intermediate step.<p>

<FONT SIZE=4><B>About Dr. Geiger:</B></FONT><BR>
Dr. Gordon H. Geiger was born and raised in the Chicago area and earned his Bachelor of Engineering degree in Metallurgy at Yale University in 1959. He earned M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Metallurgy and Materials Science at Northwestern University.<p>

He worked for Allis-Chalmers on iron ore processing plants and for Jones and Laughlin Steel Company in its research department on steelmaking processes before joining the University of Wisconsin as an Assistant Professor of Metallurgical Engineering in 1965. After promotion there to Associate Professor, he then went on to the University of Illinois at Chicago, being promoted to Professor in 1971. In 1973 he joined the University of Arizona as Professor and Department Head of Metallurgical Engineering.  During his teaching career he trained over 50 graduate students, published several well-known textbooks, and consulted for industry and government. The latter work included chairing an advisory committee to the U.S. Congress dealing with the financial technological needs of the steel industry.<p>

After 15 years of teaching, Dr. Geiger returned to industry as an internal consultant at Inland Steel and as a Vice President of Chase Manhatten Bank. From 1983 to 1993 he was Vice President of North Star Steel, helping it to grow from three to six plants, implement Computer Integrated Manufacturing, implement Total Quality Management, diversify into new products, and develop new technology.  During that time he also was Senior Vice President of Cargill, North Star Steel's parent company, in charge of Cargill's Research and Quality Management programs.<p>

In 1993 he left North Star and Cargill to start a new company. In January 1995, Qualitech Steel was incorporated, and five colleagues left their jobs to join him in raising the funds to build a new state-of-the-art special quality steel bar mill in Pittsboro, IN, and a plant to produce a new source of iron for melting, iron carbide, in Corpus Christi, TX. That fundraising was completed in June of 1996 and those two plants are under design and construction, with start-up expected in summer 1998. These two plants will hire 400 people between them and provide the lowest cost, highest quality steel in the United States.<p>

<H2>Metal Extraction From Ores by Heap Leaching</H2>

<I><B>Presented by:</B> Dr. Robert W. Bartlett, University of Idaho</I><BR>
<I><B>When:</B> Tuesday, February 11, 1:45 p.m.</I><BR>
<I><B>Location:</B> Grand Ballroom C, Clarion Plaza Hotel</I><P>

<FONT SIZE=4><B>About the Topic:</B></FONT><BR>

Heap leaching low-grade ores has become a major contributor to the extraction of economically important metals, notably copper and gold. The state of art in heap leaching is reviewed with emphasis on process engineering. Included are specific applications of rock leaching diffusion and mineral kinetics models, solution flow and retention in ore heaps during percolation leaching, biooxidation of sulfidic ores, oxygen transport within heaps by gaseous diffusion natural convection and forced air ventilation, environmental containment of leachates, and the use of aggregate metal extraction rate constants for ore heaps in making metallurgical business decisions.<p>

<H3>About the Topic:</H3>
Many binary systems exhibit miscibility gaps in the liquid state. It is well known that melts which are passing a miscility gap on cooling, solidify to a regulus consisting of two layers. Such metallic solid bodies are not interesting for technical applications and have also scarcely been investigated scientifically. Genuine interest in demixing systems only arose as it seemed possible to prevent layer formation under zero gravity. However, experiments in space have shown that even under micro-g conditions, phase separation is occurring, but, in a different way as on earth and also not finely dispersed. Afterwards, there resulted an intensive disclosure of the thermodynamics and the kinetics of the separation of liquid immiscible phases. After the discussion of the results obtained, it is indicated how layer formation can be prevented and a finely dispersed structure can be realized in order to enable technical use.<p>

<H2>The Role of Particles Nanosized From Nanostructured Materials to Environmental Problems</H2>
<I><b>Presented by:</b> Dr. Miguel Jose Yacaman, Instituto De Fiscia</I><br>
<I><B>Location:</B> 315A, Orange County Convention Center</I><BR>
<I><B>When:</B> Wednesday, February 12, 12:00 Noon</I><p>

<H3>About the Topic:</H3>
Nanosized particles play an important role in many systems in modern materials science. In the present talk we review the unique properties of nanosized particles indicating the dramatic changes that can be observed in the structure of matter at this level. This has suggested that it might be considered a fifth state of the matter.<p>

In recent years, many applications for nanosized particles have been developed, one of the most relevant is the Nanostructured material which has shown unique mechanical, magnetic and optical properties. We will discuss some applications including the most promising systems such as "Quantum Dots" and "Quantum Colloids". It has been recently discovered that nanoparticles suspended in the Troposphere might play a very important role in chemical reactions that lead to serious pollution problems. We will show that with the study of "Quantum Aerosols" we can gain insight into important environmental problems.<p>

Advanced materials with mechanical and physical behavior characteristics well in excess of those exhibited by conventional high volume materials such as steels and aluminum alloys have contributed significantly to the increased performance of transportation systems in aerospace, automobiles, and rolling stock (trains). The characteristics which are important include strength, ductility stiffness (modulus), temperature capability, forgiveness (a collective term including fracture toughness, fatigue crack growth rate, etc.) and low density.
<P>
In recent years, advanced materials have also seen greatly increased use in sporting equipment; a current pertinent example is the amazing market which has suddenly developed for titanium golf club heads.
<P>
In this presentation, the design of sports equipment will be discussed showing how a number of disciplines are involved including materials sciences, mechanical engineering, physics, anatomy, physiology and biomechanics. Various sports will be considered including running, pole-vault, bicycling, tennis, golf and baseball/softball. It will be shown that advanced materials have made much more contribution to sports such as pole-vaulting (a doubling of the world record in the past 100 years) in comparison to running (a 30% improvement in the same time period).
<P>
The ethics of the use of advanced materials in sports equipment will cover questions such as affordability, and whether the playing field should be "titled" to favor athletes with a certain physique by allowing/disallowing certain materials/designs.  The paraplegic athlete will not be ignored: including runners, basketball players and tennis players.  Did you know that each sport now has "tailored" wheel chairs--for example in basketball forwards have high seats and guards have more slant in their chairs, in order to turn quickly (at a price!).
<P>
You Luddites out there, come and hear more of electronically guided darts, heat-seeking missiles for grouse shooting, and terrain following golf balls which automatically find the lowest local elevation on a putting surface (the bottom of the hole).

The art of traditional Japanese metalwork has produced some of the most beautiful examples of the esthetic use of materials. Its origin is tied to contacts with other Asian countries, and its appeal in the West dates to the earliest world expositions in 19th century Europe and America. The growth of Tiffany &amp; Co. was related to its import and the stylistic influences that resulted from Tiffany's worldwide sale of metal-art objects. Examination of this Japanese artwork by the scientific community in Europe led to an early understanding of diffusion in solid metals. The presentation will describe the various unique alloys, solders, and metalworking methods used for traditional Japanese metalwork, and will discuss the specifics of the transfer of science and technology fostered by the esthetic appeal of this art.<BR>

<H2>Growing Faith in Individualism--Prospect for Change in Australian Workplaces</H2>

<I><B>Presented by:</B> Dr. Grant Thorne, Group Mining Executive, Comalco Aluminum</I><BR>
<I><B>Location:</B> Grand Ballroom D, Clarion Plaza Hotel</I><BR>
<I><B>When:</B> Wednesday, February 12, 12:00 Noon</I><P>

<H3>About the Topic:</H3>
Since 1994, Comalco Aluminum has featured prominently in the Australian media for its stance on industrial relations.  Determined to create an environment that would foster the most productive relationships at its operating sites, Comalco set out to promote individual staff contracts as the preferred alternative to collective arrangements involving Unions.  In so doing, Comalco confronted the belief structures of the main stakeholders in the formal Australian Industrial Relations system.<P> Other aluminum majors in Australia have chosen different paths, but Comalco is encouraged by the response of its employees and the impact of their effort on its operating performance.  Staff employment is not new, but the high profile of the debate has ensured an alternative model on the Australian industrial landscape is now given active consideration.  Dr. Thorne offers a perspective on the changing environment in industrial relations and its potential effects on major resource industries.<P>

</TABLE>

<H3>About Dr. Thorne:</H3>
As Group Mining Executive, Dr. Thorne oversees RTZ-CRA's investments in resource businesses across Europe, Africa and South America.  His current responsibilities include operations in aluminum, copper, base metals, gold and uranium.  Previously, he was Vice President, Research and Technology, and General Manager, Weipa Operations for Comalco which is the Group's aluminum subsidiary.<P>

Dr. Thorne is an Australian with Bachelor and Doctoral degrees from the University of Queensland. He joined the CRA Group in 1975 as a metallurgist at Broken Hill and has filled production and development roles since in a variety of business units.<P>

<H3>Introductory Material:</H3>
Grant Thorne joined the CRA Group in 1975 as a metallurgist at its lead/silver/zinc operations in Broken Hill, New South Wales.  From a dairy-farming background and the product of a small state school on the Sunshine Coast of Queensland, he received an Honors Degree in Metallurgy Science and a Doctorate from the University of Queensland.  His doctoral research under Dr. Alban Lynch at the Julius Kruttschnitt Mineral Research Centre gave him easy entry to the mining company that was to become the vehicle for his career.  Grant tells me he has never applied for a job to this day, although he is very familiar with invitations from his Company to up-stakes and move on to new challenges.<P>

Now, Dr. Thorne is Group Mining Executive responsible directly to the Chief Executive of RTZ-CRA for Group investments in Europe, Africa and South America. His portfolio of businesses includes a zinc smelter in Norway, an underground copper/tin mine in Portugal, underground gold mines and a nickel refinery in Zimbabwe, and open-cut uranium mine in Namibia, an aluminum smelter in the United Kingdom, and underground lead/silver/zinc mines and zinc smelter in Bolivia and Argentina.  For those occasions when the work-load is light, he is required to progress the feasibility study for the Las Cruces complex sulphide deposit in Spain.<P>

In his career with CRA, Dr. Thorne has filled numerous senior operating and development roles. The operational experience has covered lead/zinc in Broken Hill, porphyry copper in Bougainville, and bauxite and kaolin mining at Weipa. For two years, he was an internal consultant to lead smelting and coal mining businesses that were restructuring their organizations, and he has filled roles concerned with business growth in copper and kaolin.<P>

In 1994, Dr. Thorne was appointed Vice President, Research and Technology for Comalco Aluminum. That was his first opportunity to take an interest in the activities of <A HREF="/TMSHome.html">TMS</A> but he says ruefully that his attendance at last year's Las Vegas meeting was preempted by the large numbers of his R&amp;D staff who had been quicker off the mark to register. About twelve months ago, Dr. Thorne transferred to the London headquarters of the recently merged RTZ Corporation and CRA. Comalco is still well represented at this year's meeting, but Dr. Thorne and his wife Robin were unable to resist the temptation of a few days in Florida as an alternative to London's winter.<P>

For his address to us today, Dr. Thorne draws upon his personal experience as a production site manager in Australia, and a perspective gained more recently as an expatriate. The mineral wealth of Australia is known to us all, however, some legacies of inefficiency that handicap its export industries are less so.<P>

ZYP&reg; Coatings, Inc. was established in 1982 and specializes in producing the most complete line of protective paintable refractory coatings for high-temperature use. Fields of use include washcoatings that provide long-term protection of metals, ceramics and graphite from oxidation and chemical attack. These unique paintable coatings produce the maximum performance of the coated substrate.
<p>
ZYP&reg; Coatings, Inc. pioneered the use of boron nitride-based coatings for non-wetting applications with molten aluminum, magnesium and their alloys and drosses. The Boron Nitride Lubricoat&reg; is known as the leader for foundry uses such as for permanent molds, and as a coating for crucibles, ladles, molds, dies, stalk tubes, riser tubes, immersion tubes, degassing units, bubbler tubes, etc.
<P>
A totally new product, Boron Nitride Hardcoat, was developed to meet customer requests for added hardness and abrasion resistance along with the nonwetting of boron nitride. ZYP&reg; Coatings, Inc. sells these products internationally in many specialty foundry areas.

Alan Worswick (Engineering) Ltd. was formed in 1960 and initially specialized solely in the design and manufacture of rotary ingot casting machines. Progressing from this they moved into the field of automatic ingot handling with the conveyors, cooling baths and ingot stacking machines to provide a complete, automated ingot production system. As time passed, they received many enquiries and subsequent orders for specialized machines for the non-ferrous metal industry including billet stackers, anode producing machines, block/sow casters, lead dross removal machines and automated gravity die casting machines, in fact equipment to produce everything from zinc balls to aluminium engine blocks.
<P>
To date, Worswick have built more than 300 casters and 100 stackers and would be pleased to discuss your requirements at the 1997 TMS Annual Meeting in Orlando, Florida at our Booth #135.

"THE PRESS," the patented device for treating hot dross, maximizes the in-house recovery of metal and prepares the remaining dross for maximum recovery from the dross recycler.  The system is environmentally clean, in most cases eliminating the need for a baghouse. "THE PRESS" is safe, easy to operate, has fast cooling cycles and low operating and maintenance costs.  "THE PRESS" does not utilize compressed air, water or other costly gas additions.  ALTEK offers additional recycling stems that treat the cooled dross.
<p>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="AltekLogo.gif">
ALTEK also has a joint venture agreement with DIDION Manufacturing Co., manufacturer of Dross Tumbling equipment for the aluminum recycling industry. The cold processing technology, "THE TUMBLER", further treats the dross, increases the in-house recovery, generates saleable by-products and other smaller fractions that require subsequent handling or land filling.  Another TUMBLER system treats salt cake, recovering substantial amounts of metal.

B&amp;P Process Equipment and Systems, LLC, (Manufacturers of Baker Perkins Machinery), is a supplier of specialized process equipment for the production of carbon pastes, energetic materials, plastics, industrial chemicals, solid waste pyrolistion, and chemical separations. In 1903, B&amp;P supplied batch anode and cathode paste mixers for the first commercial aluminum smelter in the United States.
<P>
As smelters began to increase in size, B&amp;P evolved the initial tilt-type unit into a fixed bowl, bottom discharge unit specifically for the production of carbon pastes, with the first unit being installed in 1935, which is still in service today. As the industry requirements continued to grow, B&amp;P increased our offering in 1952 with the continuous carbon paste Polyneader<SUP>&reg;</SUP>, which is being displayed at the <A HREF="/Meetings/Annual-97/AnnMtg97Home.html">1997 TMS Annual Meeting</A>.

Bomem offers advanced analytical instruments for the characterization of aluminium melts. LiMCA II systems are a novel technique for the in-line monitoring of inclusions in aluminium melts. They provide real-time data on the total inclusion content of the melt, as well as the distribution of particle sizes, in the range of 20 to 300 micrometers.
<p>
The PoDFA technology consists in the metallographic analysis of a porous disk through which a sample of melt has been filtered. It provides a measurement of the total inclusion content, broken down by types of particles.
<p>
AISCAN hydrogen analyzers define the state of the art in the direct measurement of hydrogen dissolved in liquid aluminium. They are easy-to-use, portable instruments which provide objective and reproducible measurements at very competitive costs. Three different models are available to suit your needs.

During the <A HREF="/Meetings/Annual-97/AnnMtg97Home.html">1997 TMS Annual Meeting</A> Erico personnel will be demonstrating the CADWELL<SUP>&#174;</SUP> Process. The CADWELD<SUP>&#174;</SUP> Process is a method of making welded electrical connections of aluminum to aluminum, copper to copper, and copper to steel in which no external sources of heat such as electricity or gas are required.
<p>
The CADWELD<sup>&#174;</sup> Process is based on the reaction of granular metals which when reacted produce a molten metal. This reaction, which is completed in seconds, takes place in a graphite crucible. The liquid metal flows from this crucible section into a mold section where it meets the end of the conductor to be welded. The temperature of the molten metal is sufficient to fuse the metal of the conductors and results in a welded molecular bond. Welding alloys exist for aluminum, copper, and copper to steel connections.

GORE-TEX<sup>&reg;</sup> membrane filter bags are a two layer filter system consisting of an microporous expanded PTFE membrane laminated to a backing support material. The efficiency of this filter media is such that even sub-micron particles are filtered at the surface of the membrane. This allows for extremely low emission rates, especially for PM10 and heavy metals. Since the membrane is very slick, it offers excellent particle release when the filter is cleaned. This allows for low operating pressure drops, even at higher-than-normal filtration velocities, which in turn allows for improvements in process draft and melt shop evacuation.
<p>
GORE-TEX membrane filter bags are used in a wide variety of metallurgical processing applications. They are considered when existing control equipment is inadequate for emission any hygiene requirements. The use of these filters allows you to upgrade the performance of your system, reducing or eliminating the need for additional baghouses or operating costs.

Heraeus Electro-Nite is the world's largest producer of molten metal sensors to the iron and steel industry. Heraeus Electro-Nite has, for the past several years, devoted a portion of their R&amp;D efforts to the primary aluminum area. As a result of these efforts, they have introduced two new sensors for the primary aluminum potline.
<p>
The Postitherm AL expendable thermocouple system has been developed for direct and accurate temperature measurements in the liquid bath. The Type "S" thermocouple has been designed to provide the potline operator with an accurate, calibrated temperature measurement every time, in less than 15 seconds.
<p>
The Cry-O-Therm Sensor has been recently described as "breakthrough technology for the potline". The Cry-O-Therm Sensor utilizes a single precision thermocouple to measure both the bath and liquidus temperatures on the potline floor.
<p>
Visit Heraeus Electro-Nite during the <A HREF="/Meetings/Annual-97/AnnMtg97Home.html">1997 TMS Annual Meeting</A> at booths 523 &amp; 525 to learn more about these exciting new sensors for the potline.

</TABLE>
<P>
The motor rests upon a hinged motor mount. This flip-top design allows easier removal of the shaft and impeller from the top of the pump.
<P>
Heavier materials and a beefed-up shaft and impeller are standard features for an improved pump life. An optional self-cleaning control system generates automatic cleaning cycles. This mechanism reduces the need to stop the pump for cleaning.
<P>
Gas injection is an available option with new benefits. A high speed vortex generation at the point of gas introduction improves the disbursement of gas in the melt. A spring loaded flux tube holder assures a better fit into the base extension. Patents pending.

H&ouml;gan&auml;s Eldfast AS is part of the H&ouml;gan&auml;s Eldfast group of companies originating in Sweden and dating back to the 19th century. We supply "complete packages" of refractories and acid resistant material, from design to products, contracting and service.
<p>
Our fast, easy to install pot barriers, layer-and-sidewall refractories. BJUFS, DENSCAST 50, and ladle castable ALKON have been very popular in the aluminium industry for many years.
<p>
Now, at last, we can meet demands to reduce pollution and harmful dust in the production environment and, at the same time cut installation costs with our unique new product called Drycast. Drycast is a ready-to-use vibratable mix for electrolytic pot lining. It flows easily into all corners, forming an even smooth surface of high penetration-and slag resistance and minimal porosity in less than 30 minutes.
<p>
If you are looking for better working environment, improved economy and productivity and no dust! Welcome to H&ouml;gan&auml;s Eldfast AS, Booth #327.

The U.S. Department of Energy is sponsoring aluminum-related technologies through the Innovative Concepts program. The concepts address innovations in aluminum production, waste minimization, and fabrication.
<P>
The program sponsors technologies that are novel and innovative, providing seed money, commercialization strategy guidance, and preliminary promotional assistance to introduce the concepts to industry for consideration for further development and eventual incorporation into their processes. The technologies are breakthrough technology or novel uses of current technology and will likely require additional development and industrial guidance, but will introduce technologies that may be utilized in the future by the aluminum industry.

Since its founding in 1950 as the Kawecki Chemical Company, the name KB Alloys has been synonymous with innovation and leadership in the aluminum master alloy industry. Many of today's industry standards--metallurgical grain refiners, including TIBOR&reg;, TITAL&reg; and TICAR&reg;, waffle ingot and rod, along with countless chemistry advances--number among KB Alloys' industry-firsts. The company has always been guided by a philosophy of growth through a commitment to research, technical development and high-quality products.
<p>
TIBOR&reg;, TICAR&reg; and TITAL&reg; master alloys are used for grain refinement to deter cracking in the ingots when casting and to improve casting speeds. BORAL&reg; master alloy is used to improve conductivity, beryllium to minimize magnesium burn off, and strontium to modify the silicon phase in foundry alloys. Hardener alloys are used to improve mechanical and physical properties. MULTIPLEX&reg; alloys provide an effective method for simultaneous introduction of multiple alloying elements. Alloys are available in a variety of forms--ingot, bar, buttons, flake and coiled and cut rod--each designed to increase throughput, uniformity and better predictability as compared to pure elements or salts.
<p>
Every KB Alloys product is backed by outstanding worldwide technical support and a company-wide commitment to customer service. Experienced sales engineers, research metallurgists and trained agents can help you select the best product for your process and application. We can also provide responsive, knowledgeable answers and technical support to help you overcome problems and get the most out of the products you produce.
<p>
Strategic, customer-focused manufacturing and worldwide inventories. With advanced ISO-9002 certified manufacturing facilities in both the Eastern and Western United States, as well as in Great Britain, and strategically located customer-focused inventories, we provide fast, reliable delivery of consistently high-quality master alloys anywhere in the world.

Master Alloys Company will be exhibiting its popular 100% canned hardeners. The canned hardener is 100% element in a pre-weighed, moisture-proof aluminum can. The element is not released into the aluminum until it is under the melt which negates any oxidation and results in very high recoveries.
<p>
This unique way to alloy aluminum has many advantages over other forms of hardeners. Besides being pre-weighed and moisture proof, as stated, the product is easy to store which reduces inventory, it is easy to use, offers fast dissolution and high recoveries, is free from contamination, and has a guaranteed composition.
<p>
Master Alloys Company also supplies grain refiners and specialty alloys to the aluminum industry.

In twenty years of research, the MOLTECH Group has developed products and processes for aluminum electrowinning, including TINOR<SUP>&reg;</SUP> Aluminum-wettable Protective Cathode Coating, OPANOR<SUP>&reg;</SUP> Anode Oxidation Protection, and EXCELNOR<SUP>&reg;</SUP> Side Wall Oxidation Protection, which have been tested extensively in laboratories and commercial cells and are now available for commercial use.
<p>
The ultimate goal for MOLTECH research is the development of the NOVANOR<SUP>&reg;</SUP> non-carbon non-consumable anode to replace carbon anodes, thereby reducing pollution in their fabrication and use, and in residue disposal. NOVANOR<SUP>&reg;</SUP> anode laboratory test results are very promising and pilot scale tests are now in process. The TINOR<SUP>&reg;</SUP> application system and the OPANOR<SUP>&reg;</SUP> system are available for the automatic application of the products.
<p>
MOLTECH invites everyone to visit its booths at the <A HREF="/Meetings/Annual-97/AnnMtg97Home.html">1997 TMS Annual Meeting</A>, which will feature an
OPANOR<SUP>&reg;</SUP> System.

The National Refractories exhibit during the <A HREF="/Meetings/Annual-97/AnnMtg97Home.html">1997 TMS Annual Meeting</A> will highlight applications of EZ<sup>3</sup> and FUSiO<sub>2</sub>N. EZ<sup>3</sup> products expand the uses of the company's well known EZ Cast product line. FUSiO<sub>2</sub>N products are National's new line of fused silica preformed shapes, foam blocks, castables, and cement.
<p>
EZ<sup>3</sup> castables are a family of products designed to offer three options for installation; pouring, gunning, and pumping. The unique materials can be installed by mixing and pouring into place without vibration. They can be mixed and pumped some distance to a form. Best of all, they can now be gunned with standard swing-valve pumping equipment.
<p>
FUSiO<sub>2</sub>N preformed shapes are pure fused silica. A unique production process allows National to be very cost competitive while offering customized materials and shapes to meet customer needs.

Picard is an international company with subsidiaries in Germany, England, USA, and Hong Kong. For more than 120 years, Picard is well known as a manufacturer of Wear Parts for various industries.
<P>
One of the main production ranges of the company is the production of Wear Parts for anode-paste-mixers such as liners/wearing plates, kneading teeth, and screws flights/paddle screws. These Wear Parts can be offered in two executions:
<OL>
<LI TYPE=a>Standard Execution, and 
<LI>Special High-wear-resistant Execution
</OL>
The Standard Execution is a hard-faced execution to achieve good and long service-time. The High-wear-resistant Execution guarantees an extraordinary long time and wear-resistance which is caused by hardfacing and coating a tungsten-carbide material.
<P>
Besides the new parts, C.A. Picard offers an economical and favorable re-conditioning service which either can be arranged in your plant or our works.

Research-Cottrell is the exclusive worldwide licensee for Alcoa's A-398 and A-446 fluidized bed dry scrubbing technologies. The technologies--the basis for the new MACT rules--provide state-of-the-art emission control and fluoride recovery from both primary aluminum potline and bake oven applications. A-398 systems are currently installed on more than 20 smelters (56 potlines) worldwide, treating over 20 million cfm of potroom gases from both prebake and Soderburg-type reduction cells. The A-398 and A-446 technologies routinely achieve greater than 99.9% fluoride removal efficiencies. In addition to controlling fluorides and particulate, the A-446 scrubbing process significantly reduces hydrocarbons (Tars, POM, B(a)P) and SO<sub>2</sub> emissions from bakeoven furnaces, without a separate spray cooling chamber.
<P>
Alcoa's proven fluid bed scrubber systems and Research-Cottrell's vast air pollution control experience in fabric filter, electrostatic precipitator, wet and dry scrubber, and VOC-removal technologies, combine to allow Research-Cottrell to offer the "Best" technologies at a competitive price.

<HR>
Shieldalloy Metallurgical Corporation's (SMC) Aluminum Products Group has been producing grain refiners, master alloys, and compacted products for use in the Aluminum Industry for 25 years.
<p>
SMC was the first company to develop and introduce the newest technology of continuous cast and conformed rod which offers the highest quality grain refining rod, strontium-aluminum rod or other master alloy rod in the industry.
<p>
Our continuing efforts in technical development have resulted in a variety of new grain refiners or master alloys and hardeners for use in the primary, secondary, and foundry markets. SMC not only offers traditional briquettes of manganese, iron, and chrome but also our newest product ALTAB which offers the most cost effective means of adding manganese, iron, chromium, copper, etc. to molten aluminum.
<P>
We invite you to visit our booth #318 during the <A HREF="/Meetings/Annual-97/AnnMtg97Home.html">1997 TMS Annual Meeting</A> to discuss these new alloys and other new products that we have developed such as our Castcut which offers very tight weigh control for precision addition requirements.

Backed by more than 80 years experience, Skamol Insulation is one of the world's leading manufacturers of thermal insulation for the temperature range 600-1200&#176;C (1112-2192&#176;F) offering products based on Moler, Perlite, Calcium Silicate, and Vermiculite.

<p>
Visit our booth #329 and 331 during the <A HREF="/Meetings/Annual-97/AnnMtg97Home.html">1997 TMS Annual Meeting</A>, where Skamol will be introducing a new range of Perlite Block Insulation. The Perlite Blocks are especially applicable for insulation of aluminium reduction cell cathodes giving the benefit of good resistance to molten aluminium and quick installation due the special chemistry and the large sizes.
<p>
Further, Skamol has joined forces with Norwegian Elkem Carbon in introducing two new types of cold ramming pastes based on Electrically Calcined Anthracite (ECA). The development of these cold ramming pastes is a clear improvement of the conventional lining concept, reducing emissions of hazardous tar and PAH (polyaromatic hydrocarbons) to a minimum and increasing pot life and enhancing profitability.
<p>
Skamol Insulation will be introducing some of these new products at the <A HREF="/Meetings/Annual-97/AnnMtg97Home.html">1997 TMS Annual Meeting</A>. In addition, we are pleased to announce that our senior R&amp;D Manager, Mr. Stig F. Johansson will be giving a lecture on the subject: Penetration Force of Bath Components into Pot Linings Described by Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics. Our sales teams from Denmark and the USA look forward to seeing you.

Melting and holding furnaces for aluminium designed and built by Thermcon are in wide spread use with major aluminium producers around the world. In recent years D.C. casting machines and homogenizing furnaces have been added to the delivery program making Thermcon an all-round supplier for turn key casthouse packages. Recycling of aluminium scrap has been a priority with Thermcon for many years already, hence the development of side well furnaces with integrated incinerators, enclosed charging systems and delacquering and preheating installations in operation with clients such as V.A.W., Daiki in Japan.
<p>
Thermcon will give an update on the latest furnace technology available and developments underway to meet the requirements of the future, both with respect to improved economics and compliance with environmental regulations.

In collaboration with academia, and other federal and state agencies, the Department of Energy's Office of Industrial Technologies and the aluminum industry are working together to build a stronger and more competitive industry, to achieve national goals for energy, the economy, and the environment.
<p>
The Aluminum Association recently published <i>Aluminum Industry: Industry/Government Partnerships for the Future</i> which provides the initial vision for the U.S. Aluminum industry to compete globally into the 21st century. On October 9, 1996, Secretary Hazel O'Leary signed a compact with the aluminum industry to establish a research and development partnership. This partnership will identify appropriate areas for joint R&amp;D that can improve the quality of life in the United States and promote the manufacture of competitively priced and ecologically sustainable aluminum products.
<p>
DOE is facilitating the Aluminum Industry's development of Technology Roadmap to establish a strategy for achieving the goals set forth in its vision document.

<B>Programming: </B> This symposium will provide a forum for discussion of practical as well as fundamental
aspects of recycling of metals and engineered materials. In response to growing pressures to curb waste, many
industries have established successful recycling loops. This has led to the development of sophisticated
process technologies, which, in turn, have stimulated basic research in the field.

<h6><ul>The vestige of a huge pit dwelling house
  The traces show this pit dwelling house was 18 meters long and 12 meters wide.  6 timber poles gave support to the roof and it had a hearth in the center of the floor.  It seems that the house was used as a meeting hall, a group workshop, a public boarding house in winter, and so on.</h6></ul></ul>

<h4>
The phrase "my home," adapted from English, is a common Japanese term for the
 privately-owned family residence, a dream and aspiration shared by a large
 majority of the Japanese people. With space scarce in this island nation,
 and land prices high even by European and U.S. standards, more and more
 people must satisfy their goal of home ownership with condominium apartments
 (called, with some exaggeration, "mansions"-also from English). 
 But the desire for a private house with a garden, however modest in size,
 persists. In this issue of Japan Pictorial we follow some "my homes"
 from design to construction, and learn from the joys and frustrations
 of their occupants.

<title>Learning Japanese Where It Is Spoken</title>

<h1><b>
Learning Japanese Where It Is Spoken
</h1></b>
<hr>
<p>
Sakamoto Kikuko's work and what she finds gratifying are one and
 the same: teaching Japanese to foreigners living in Tokyo's Nerima
 Ward. Her first chance to do this was in 1991, at a class organized
 by the Nerima International Friendship Association.
 She was so popular that, at the end of the 17-week course,
 some of her students asked her to find a way to continue
 teaching them. She couldn't refuse. In time her classes
 grew, through word-of-mouth. Now her Hanashimasho,
 Nihon-go wo (Let's Speak Japanese) classes are held once a week,
 free of charge. Sakamoto also participates in two other
 Nerima Ward programs, teaching regular Nihon-go
 classes and coaching future instructors in how
 to teach Japanese as a foreign language. <br>
	Eight other Japanese instructors in addition to
 Sakamoto teach the Hanashimasho, Nihon-go wo course.
 This lets them break the 47 students up into small groups,
 according to level. All classes are conducted in the same
 room at the same time (luckily the room is large).
 "I learn a lot too-how good it is to feel consideration
 for people around one, and how important family bonds are.
 Many of our students are mothers with children.
 The kids come to class too, and are cared for by
 people around them whenever they need help. Things
 get a little noisy, like in a nursery school, but we all have a great time."

<p>
<hr>
<img src=exchgs1.gif>
This is a truly international group-they all live in Japan, but come from different places on four continents: Australia, Brazil, China, Ecuador, Indonesia, Nepal, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and the U.S.A. Many of these students are housewives and mothers. When they place their children in nursery schools they will need a basic knowledge of spoken and written Japanese.
<hr>
<img src=exchgs2.gif>
Sakamoto Kikuko received a Master's degree in International Relations from the University of Chicago in 1964. She has coauthored and edited two books to help foreigners communicate 
in Japanese in different situations.
<hr>
<img src=exchgs3.gif align=left>
Students say that during their Japanese lessons they also learn about Japanese
 customs, pick up hints on how life in Japan can be more rewarding, and,
 best of all, make new friends. The mood often seems rather laid-back,
 but behind the chatter is an eagerness to learn-four more students
 from these classes recently attained the highest level in the Japanese
 Language Proficiency Test.

<h1><b>
The Disabled-Gradual Progress<br>
Towards Equality in Society
</h1></b>
<hr>
<h2><b>
Employment Levels Leave Room for Improvement
</b></h2><p>
During the United Nations Decade of Disabled Persons (1983-1992),
 the situation for disabled people in Japan improved considerably.
 Perhaps the most important advance was a change in mentality-people
 came to understand the importance of "mainstreaming." This buzzword
 refers to disabled people getting out of their homes and facilities
 to join in the everyday activities of society at large. Mainstreaming
 is more than just wanting to be part of society and live life to the
 full. It also means getting a job.<br>
	The Fundamental Law for Persons with Disabilities, passed by
 the Diet in November 1993, welcomes the disabled into the mainstream of 
society. Also, regulations stipulate that at least 1.6% of a
 large company's work force is to be made up of disabled persons.
 The actual percentage is rising slowly, but only in a few companies
 in certain sectors such as mining and manufacturing.<br>
	Work in a city poses particular difficulties: it probably
 entails cramming onto a train in the morning, hardly feasible
 for someone in a wheelchair. If the workplace is an office, in
 all likelihood the employer rents, so building renovations are
 not a top priority. Many barriers remain. The problem has to be
 resolved on different fronts at the same time-employers have to
 adapt their workplaces to the specific needs of disabled workers,
 while the Government provides incentives to help them do so.
<p><hr>
<img src=disabl1.gif>
The '95 Tokyo City Half-Marathon, held in January this year, was a good opportunity for these 76 wheelchair racers to show their stuff to the 4,700 participating runners. Sports for the disabled are not only for rehabilitation and enjoyment-they are for out-and-out competition as well. This idea is catching on in Japan.
<hr>
<img src=disabl2.gif align=left>
Sasaki Katsuya was 41st in his division-he came in at nine seconds under one hour on the 21-kilometer course. The neighborhood where he lives is hardly ideal for racing practice, but that doesn't stop him from participating in many marathons of this type all over Japan.

Communication Strikes a<br> Chord in Others

<hr>
<h2>Gracious Poise in the Hectic World of Broadcasting</h2><p>
Caroline Brillet works in the thick of sportscasting, so she knows the importance of communication. As an assistant director in the Sports Program Division at Television Tokyo, her main jobs are interpreting for foreign athletes competing in events being broadcast by her 
television station, and conducting negotiations with foreign 
broadcasting companies. She also does slow-motion replays for live sportscasts, and relays inside information on the action and the players to the broadcasting unit.
Working behind the scenes requires split-second timing. "Usually we have no time to explain things to our fellow 
workers. So our communication involves intuition as much as words." Caroline communicates well in several languages-she was born in France, brought up in Australia, and now lives in Japan. Her Japanese has a graciousness that shows her consideration of others.
</h4>
<p><hr>
<img src=spot.gif>
On her days off, Caroline plays for one of two different soccer teams. One of her ambitions is to produce a documentary on women's soccer in Japan.
<hr>
<h2>New Music from International Harmony</h2><p>
Music knows no boundaries. Miura Naoyuki is a case in point: to introduce Japanese contemporary music to the American scene, in 1975 he set up an organization in New York called Music From Japan (MFJ). Each year, MFJ organizes performances of Japanese music-that is, 
music written by Japanese composers but played by American musicians-and symposia. As part of its 20th anniversary celebrations, MFJ has booked New York's Lincoln Center for October and November performances of the opera, Kinkakuji, inspired by Mishima Yukio's novel of the 
same name.
For 17 years, Miura was a 
regular contrabass player in the orchestra of the New York City Opera. He came to believe that the best way to introduce Japanese music and theatrical art abroad is to have musicians and performers of other cultures perform it. This introduces a fresh feeling, and brings the work to new heights.
<hr>
<img src=spot2.gif align=left>
Miura is Vice President of Fukushima College for Women in Fukushima,
 his home town. His eyes are on the future-his organization, Music
 From Japan (MFJ), is compiling an English-language database on Japanese
 traditional and contemporary music. This fall, users all over the world
 should be able to access the database with a personal computer connected
 to a telecommunications network. 
MFJ's future plans go further: adding multimedia sound and images to the database.

<h1><b>
Yokohama-<br>
In Close Contact with the World
</h1></b>
<hr>
<h2>Port City Blends Past, Present and Future</h2><p>
A visit to Yokohama, one of Japan's largest ports, quickly reveals its links
 with foreign countries. Of the more than 55,000 ships entering the harbor
 annually, a considerable number have arrived from foreign lands, to unload
 and take on in excess of 68 million tons of cargo each year.<br>
The city embraces the future with the same energy it shows to the world
 at large. The downtown waterfront is in the midst of tremendous development.
 The Minato Mirai 21 Project (mirai means "future," while the "21" refers
 to the 21st century) and many other construction projects are in full
 swing, experimenting with new concepts that combine different urban
 elements, such as housing, business, retail trade, international
 conventions and cultural events. The future certainly involves high
 technology, and parts of Yokohama's industrial core are at the cutting
 edge, fostering highly advanced industries and smaller, local companies.<br>
Yokohama's historic roots are relatively shallow-full-fledged development
 started only after 1859, when the port opened to foreign trade. Culture
 and technology from abroad quickly poured in. Trading houses sprang up
 to represent British, American and other interests, and Yokohama almost
 overnight found itself at the forefront of western culture and thought.
 Japan's first railway ran from Yokohama to Tokyo. Yokohama citizens were
 the first to experiment with, then adopt, western infrastructure like
 electric lights, the telephone and a modern water supply. Other innovations
 also began here-daily newspapers, western-style hotels, barber shops and
 photography studios, to name only a few.
<p>
<hr>
<img src=yoko1.gif>
At the heart of the Minato Mirai 21 Project stand two immense developments: the 70-story Landmark Tower (height, 296 meters, or 971 feet) in the center of the photo and, on the right, Pacifico Yokohama (a complex which includes the Yokohama Grand Inter-Continental Hotel and halls for international conventions). 
The immense ferris wheel is another popular attraction.<br>

The Yokohama Bay Bridge is one of the most dramatic parts of a new expressway linking Yokohama to Tokyo. The bridge's walkway, which is suspended 50 meters (164 feet) above the entrance to 
the bay, is a great place to enjoy a view of the city harbor.<br>

<h2>
The Great Hanshin/Awaji Earthquake, Greatest Disaster
To Strike Japan in Half a Century
</h2>
<hr>
<p>
At 5:46 a.m. on 17 January 1995, a terrifying earthquake struck southern Hyogo Prefecture. The quake, whose epicenter was shallow and practically right under the city of Kobe, registered a magnitude of 7.2 on the open-ended Richter scale. Well over 5,000 people lost their lives, and an additional two million were seriously affected. More than 210,000 dwellings were destroyed or damaged. The Great Hanshin/Awaji Earthquake was Japan's worst disaster in half a century.
<br>Assistance came from all over Japan and more than 30 other countries. The sight of 
volunteers and members of international non-governmental organizations offering their help did much to raise the spirits of the survivors. 
<br>The disaster has prompted a reexamination of the nation's disaster relief measures, and provides many lessons on measures needed to protect lives and property against a similar 
disaster in the future.

<h1><b>
Home Ownership: Different Attitudes <br>
about Housing</h1></b>
<hr>
<p>
Most Japanese want a home of their own. Yet since the 1960s the
 percentage of people owning rather than renting has remained at
 a low of around 60%. Here are two likely reasons why. (1) More
 young people live alone in urban areas; and (2) Japanese house
 prices are exorbitant (though they have declined somewhat recently).
 Europeans and Americans generally enjoy spacious rooms and well-equipped
 accommodations, whether they rent an apartmenteven a publicly
 owned oneor buy their own house, and rents are comparatively
 cheap. Japanese rented dwellings are expensive and often
 inferior to purchased housing, and property is considered a
 tangible asset. What percentage of homes in different countries
 are owned by their occupants, and how large are the dwellings?

Exchanges:Bangladeshi Villagers and Japanese Volunteers

</title>
<body bgcolor=ffffff>
<img src=../jpsmart2.gif>
<h2><b>
Bangladeshi Villagers and Japanese Volunteers Learn from Each Other

</h2></b>
<hr>
<p>In 1972 fifty young volunteers from Japan arrived in Bangladesh to give guidance in modern agricultural methods. This was the beginning of a non-governmental organization now known as Shapla Neer (Bengali words meaning "water lily homestead"). More than twenty years have passed since then, yet the group remains true to the original aim, to raise the living standards of villagers. About half of the farmers live day to day, working on the land of others. With Shapla Neer's advice they have organized their own groups, giving themselves a degree of autonomy that enables them to help each other. Over the years the villagers have rationalized their farming methods, and have raised literacy and health and sanitation levels as well.

<br>

Shapla Neer's head office is called the Citizens' Committee in Japan for Overseas Support. 

Ito Hiroshi, one of the Committee members, has a simple approach: "Overseas cooperation is not as awesomely complicated as people think it is. We make things easy and enjoyable by concentrating on everyday living-food, clothes, handicrafts used in the home, and so on."

<br>

Since 1976 the Committee has held bazaars to sell handicrafts from Bangladesh. Four years ago it started "Curry Aid." Everyone likes curry, so this 

program has turned out to be an excellent way to increase interest in a different culture. The Committee has 2,800 members in Japan, with about 

300 volunteers in the Greater Tokyo region. Ito says modern technology has greatly reduced barriers imposed by distance, but there remains another challenge: to work together with people of other 

cultures, helping them raise their standard of living.

<p>

<hr>

<img src=p14-15.gif>

Shapla Neer often sells handmade fabrics and other goods made in Bangladesh. Sales in Japan help provide work for women living in Bangladesh farming villages. During the two-day "Bazaar Bengal" held in Tokyo, these Japanese volunteers were brought into direct contact with another culture.

<hr>
<img src=p14.gif align=left>

Ito Hiroshi lived in Bangladesh for about 

18 months, which explains his skill in making curry. "When I teach people how to cook curry, I find I also need to talk about Bangladeshi culture and the country. In our classes I am learning how to get students interested not only in foreign food but in a foreign culture as well."

<br clear=all><hr>

<img src=p15.gif align=right>

Shapla Neer members with a woman from Bangladesh. During her stay in Japan she too is a volunteer, teaching how to wear a sari. The experience lets Japanese women "feel" a different culture.

<h3>The Growing Craze for Comics</h3>

Japan's comic culture is growing. The number of comic books and magazines sold has risen for years, and topped 2,250 million in 1993. While the printing of ordinary books has declined steadily over the last five years, the comic-book market keeps expanding. The number of comic books published in 1993 rose 9.7% over 1992, while the value of sales jumped 10%. Comics now represent 36% of the total reading market. This explains why some publishing houses that never touched comic magazines in the past jumped into the market this year.

<br>

Japanese comics (affectionately called <i>manga</i>) are a
 unique genre, appealing not only to kids but to adults too (as
 many a tourist on a train has remarked). In the 1940s an extremely
 talented artist, Tezuka Osamu, pioneered a new style. He took a playful
 and satirical genre and added a story-line, spinning out a "story <i>manga</i>"
 that could lead the reader through thousands of pages of fiction and fantasy.
 For almost fifty years many comic-strip artists have followed Tezuka's lead,
 each one appeal-ing to a certain segment-young or old, male or female-of the market.

This oasis for <i>manga</i> lovers is just one outlet belonging to a chain of stores selling used comic books. This store offers more than 200,000 comic-related items: books and magazines, compact and laser discs, and comics published by amateur groups. If you include its warehouse stock, the store has a total of about 500,000 <i>manga</i> items.

Spotlight:Making an Impact Abroad Takes More Than Skill

Making an Impact Abroad Takes More Than Skill

</h2></b>
<hr>
<h3>In Soccer You Need a Strong Will</h3><p>

Women's soccer is gaining world attention because of people like Linda Medalen. Her attack skills as a striker are obvious in major competitions in Norway (her homeland) and Japan. In 1992 she started playing for the Dream Ladies, a team sponsored by The Nikko Securities Co., Ltd., and gratified the other players by 

leading them to victory. 

<br>

Linda is convinced that if Japanese women are to succeed in soccer they need to develop a stronger spirit. "When you're 

playing soccer it's normal for 

your entire body to ache. But if you ignore the pain the game becomes enjoyable, and you play much better. You have to put everything out of your mind except playing. Once the game is over, try to forget all about it."

<br>

When in Japan, Medalen 

sometimes gets lonely, maybe because she finds it difficult to communicate in Japanese. But that doesn't inhibit her. "If you want to win a game you have to do your best. When I make a real effort to speak in Japanese I 

often end up having a great time."

<p>

<hr>

<img src=p24-1.gif>
Linda Medalen is a police officer in Norway. 

"As Europe becomes a single market, narcotics develop into even more of a trans-border problem. After the 1996 World Cup, I intend to retire from soccer, then dedicate my police work to stamping out drug use. That is my future goal in life."
<hr><p>


<h3>Health Care Involves More Than Medical Treatment</h3><p>

"My wife and I made a vow when we got married. It was to go to an out-of-the-way corner of the world and see if we could be of help to the people there."  So in 1962 

Dr. Iwamura Noboru and his wife went to live in Nepal under the auspices of the Japan Overseas Christian Medical Cooperative Service. For the next 18 years they lived in a village where 

<br>

Iwamura was the only doctor. Using the village as a base, he trekked from hamlet to hamlet, preventing contagious diseases 

like tuberculosis and raising public health standards.

Dr. Iwamura was in Hiroshima when the atom bomb fell in 1945. The effect of the radiation lingered for years, then became worse, so he and his wife 

returned to Japan in 1989. Four years later his service in Nepal was recognized when he was awarded the Magsaysay Prize, Asia's equivalent of the Nobel Prize.

<br>

"In remote locations medical services are often non-existent. Disease and poverty create a vicious circle. To break the circle, a doctor must work with others who are trying to develop the village economy and raise crop yields."

<hr>

<img src=p25.gif align=left>
One time an itinerant merchant carried a seriously ill patient on his back over mountain passes, in order to obtain medical help. He wouldn't take anything for his trouble. He told Dr. Iwamura that, for the Gurung people of Nepal, the Golden Rule is, "Living means sharing with those in need."  This maxim has since guided the doctor's own life.

Hida Takayama-Ancient Castle Town with an International Spirit

Kyoto in Miniature



</h1></b>
<hr>
<h3>Kyoto in Miniature</h3>

<p>

Takayama's location is part of its charm. It lies in a small basin 573 meters (almost 1,900 feet) above sea level, surrounded by mountains on all sides. In ancient times it served as a central way station on a major road, so it developed into a castle town rich in history. Takayama's atmosphere, somehow reminiscent of Kyoto, also gives it charm, and its small population (only 

65,000) is a pleasant contrast to larger cities. Though located in the center of Japan, it is off the beaten track, so parts of the city seem to have ignored the passage of time. Almost two and a half million tourists visit each year.

<br>

In 1986 Takayama declared itself an international tourist city, to commemorate 50 years of municipal government. The goal, to attract foreign visitors, was given concrete expression with English signs erected and pamphlets given out at Takayama's many tourist spots. There are also tourist centers called Takayama Information Desks located in ten different parts of the city. City Hall has a list of about 100 volunteers who understand a foreign language (among them, English, German, French, Spanish and Chinese); the city office can find an interpreter-guide for those who request one. Takayama is very much open to the outside world in other ways as well. For example, the Hida Takayama International Association offers foreign language courses twice a month and sponsors an annual English speech contest for junior and senior high school students.


<p>

<hr>

<img src=p26-2.gif>

Old buildings remain in the Kamisan-no-machi district. A good place to buy cakes and candies, or have a light meal in traditional surroundings. In the evening, after all the tourists have left for their hotels, you might think you were in another era.

<hr>
<img src=p26.gif align=left>

Each year Takayama receives around 24,000 visitors from abroad-53% from North America, 27% from Europe and 15% from Southeast Asia.
<br clear=all><hr>

<img src=p27.gif align=right>

This bridge spans the Miyagawa River, which flows north through the middle of Takayama toward the Japan Sea. The red and green are so different from each other that they work well together.

Books or Comic Books-Which Are More Popular?



</h1></b>
<hr><p>

Japanese are avid readers of comics. How about ordinary books? One would assume that the young crowd favors comics, while older people ignore them-but how true is this? To answer such questions, a newspaper company conducted a survey that looked at Japanese monthly readership of books and comic books, by age group. The response, "haven't read either," was the most common, followed by "one book and one comic book per month." The keenest readers of both books and comic books turned out to be between 16 and 39 years of age.

<h4>

Relaxations in regulations on large-scale retailers have made it easier for entrepreneurs in Japan to open large discount stores and supermarkets. This means greater pressure on the small-sized, family-operated stores which are the heart of Japan's retail industry. Small retailers can't often compete with supermarkets in pricing, and must work out other strategies for appealing to customers. This issue of Japan Pictorial takes a look at retailing today, with special attention to some of the tricks of the trade that small shopkeepers 

are using to survive in a more competitive market.

Exchanges: ISSHO Productions' Japanese Drama

</title>
<body bgcolor=ffffff>
<img src=../jpsmart2.gif>
<h2><b>
ISSHO Productions'<br> Japanese Drama: Interaction<br>Gets Rid of Prejudice

</h2></b>


<p><hr><p>

Tony Laszlo is a product of this international age. His father is Hungarian, his mother Italian. He grew up in a number of European countries, graduated from an American university, and is now a resident of Japan. 

<br>	He says that when we see someone from a different culture, our first reaction is to pigeonhole that person according to factors like race, nationality and religion. But he believes a more flexible approach can lead to something more interesting - observing how people of different cultures can interact.

<br>	Laszlo first came to Japan in 1985 to organize an exhibition of his modern art. The Japanese language interested him, so he decided to stay a while. The longer he stayed, the more his interests grew. He was especially drawn to the idea of foreigners in Japan debating in Japanese, so he organized discussion sessions on a regular basis. This led, in 1993, to his writing a drama in Japanese called "Issho" (which means "Together"). A group of people of many different nationalities formed ISSHO Productions and put on the play, with Laszlo as producer. (A revival is scheduled for this autumn.) The play centers on amusing situations that result when foreigners living in Japan inevitably run up against prejudice and misunderstanding. This is Tony Laszlo's abiding theme - people of different backgrounds interacting with each other.

<br>	"It's natural to pigeonhole someone, even when you want to be friends on a one-to-one basis. But it's possible to keep looking at the person in different ways, and to see him or her in a new light each time you interact. People's relationships will change and develop in time, if you let them."







<hr>
<img src=photo01.gif>
Workshops in "theater sports" (the art of 

ad-libbing and improvising in a dramatic situation) are part of the training the actors in Laszlo's production receive.

<hr>


<img src=photo02.gif align=right>



Laszlo's theatrical workshops bring together people from many different countries, including, of course, Japan. The common language is Japanese.



<br clear=all><hr>



<img src=photo03.gif align=left>



Laszlo's talents extend beyond the theater and fine arts. He writes articles in Japanese and English, and is also a translator. He 

is also involved in international exchange 

in Fujisawa, about 50 km (30 miles 

or so) from Tokyo, where he lives.

Perspectives: Pets Fill a Gap in Modern Life

<h2><b>
Pets Fill a Gap in Modern Life

</h2></b><hr><p>
<b>A Wide Choice of Pets for Today's Cramped Living Conditions</b><p>

Westernized and affluent: Japanese society has become both. This may explain why many people in Japan, often lacking meaningful contact with other human beings, have adopted pets. Dogs and cats are the most popular, followed by birds. But since the country is also heavily urbanized, it is natural that prospective pet owners are turning to tropical fish and reptiles - these creatures won't disturb the neighbors by yelping, knocking over flower pots, or creating bad smells.

<br>	Dogs still rank first, though. About 60% of all pets in Japan are dogs, according to a recent survey by the Prime Minister's Office. Next come cats, at 26%. But for all their lovable qualities, dogs and cats need a lot of care; finally, they become sick and die. Trouble and heartbreak can be avoided with a new kind of "pet," a mechanized creation which is more than a stuffed animal. A sensor somewhere inside will set its tail wagging when you call its name. Walk close to another, and it will meow. And then there are "fish," filled with lighter-than-air helium, that "swim" in the air. These are inane toys you might laugh at, but they brighten up the apartment of a young worker or senior citizen who lives alone and has no time or energy to look after a pet.



<p><hr>
<img src=photo01.gif>
In the city, chances are there's no garden to bury a dead dog in. Some bereaved owners have their pets cremated, then place the ashes in urns, to be cherished for a long time. The owner of this dog belongs to a club that arranges periodic memorial services for the dear departed. Beside the picture stands the urn, enclosed in a fabric cover. Pet food is offered on either side.

<b>Pottery with a Touch of Sweden</b><p>



"When I first came to Hagi in 1969 there was a lot I didn't understand about Hagi pottery, so I began studying under a master potter. I had originally agreed to stay three years, but when the time was up I realized each goal I achieved just forced me to set a new one." It is now 17 years since Bertil Persson, a native of Sweden, set up his own kiln, which he calls Nanmyoji. He makes his home in Hagi (near the western tip of Japan's main island) with his Japanese wife, Fusae, and their two children.

<br>	Before coming to Japan, Persson worked 12 years in Denmark as a professional decorator of Royal Copenhagen tableware.

<br>	Persson says, "My pottery somehow ends up blending Scandinavian and Japanese tastes together. Maybe that's the distinctive aspect of my life's work."

<img src=photo01.gif align=left>
Hagi pottery is simple - even after firing, the clay is natural to the eye and touch. Usually it is not decorated with a brush, but on his own ware Persson often paints the Japanese wild flowers he loves.

A Piano Player Who Makes Jazz Universal

</b>

<p>



Onishi Junko on stage radiates a powerful energy. But this power isn't tossed about recklessly - her jazz, from beginning to end, is restrained; her piano becomes an extension of her unique, controlled vitality.

<br>	Like jazz musicians everywhere, Onishi is flexible, and she 

continually experiments with new band arrangements. Her twice-monthly performances in Tokyo clubs are very popular, and she's eager to play in countries where she hasn't yet performed, particularly in Europe, Africa and Southeast Asia. "I want to play for many years yet," she says.

<br>	Onishi compares classical music's universality with the current popularity of jazz: "Classical music had its roots in European court music, but spread all over the world through the inspiration of many talented composers and performers. Likewise, jazz was picked up by Europeans, Asians and others, then given further expression. People everywhere take what they admire of a foreign culture, develop it, then make it universal. I suppose I'm one small part of this evolution."<p><hr>



<img src=photo02.gif>
Onishi Junko's experience at the piano started at the age of four with lessons in classical music. She developed a name for herself as a professional musician while on tour during the three years she studied music performance at Berklee College of Music in Boston, and during an additional three years of performing after graduation. Onishi's third album, appearing this autumn, was recorded during a live performance at the New York jazz club, Village Vanguard. Her two-week European 

tour will help propel her to world fame.

Otaru, an Old Port City with a New Face

</h2></b>
<hr><p>
<b>

Buildings Tell of Days of Glory <br>

100 Years Ago

</b><p>

Otaru's many old stone buildings recall the city's past. Some structures were obviously warehouses, built at the beginning of this century when Otaru flourished as an important port for Hokkaido, Japan's northern island. The warehouses served two industries: herring fishing and trade with Russia. Other equally old stone buildings, more elegant in style, were offices for companies or financial institutions. Years ago it was not Sapporo, but Otaru, that was the economic center of the island. In those days businessmen from different parts of Japan arrived to make money in this town, the gateway to what was then Japan's frontier.

<br>	Those days are over. By Japan's standards, the population is small (about 160,000). But Otaru's past has made it a charming place to visit. People say it was mostly young couples in love who discovered the charm, easily enjoyed during a day trip from Sapporo, not far away. Word spread, and about seven or eight years ago the tourist boom started. Now Otaru receives more than five million visitors a year.

<br>	Otaru residents now realize the attractions their city offers - old canals, stately buildings that remind us of a different era, fresh seafood, and ateliers where you can watch artisans making glassware. And the mountains, which form the backdrop for the city, offer excellent opportunities for hiking in summer and skiing in winter. Otaru is a natural tourist spot - the city's attraction lies in its being itself.

<p><hr>



<img src=photo01.gif align=left>
In the old days this canal provided transport for goods being moved to and from the warehouses. Today it is an ideal spot for an evening stroll.

<br clear=all><hr>



<img src=photo02.gif align=left>



This steam-driven time piece comes from Vancouver (Canada), Otaru's sister city. The clock stands almost 5.5 meters tall (about 18 feet) and weighs about two tons. The location is ideal, at a square where seven streets meet. Residents are sure the clock will add to the charm of Otaru.

<h2><b>
Japan, Still a Nation of Small 

Neighborhood Stores

</h2></b>
<hr>

<p>

When Japanese people go shopping, more than 70% of the time they go on foot or by bicycle. One good reason for this is that stores are located conveniently close to where consumers live. We can infer from this that Japan has a lot of shops. Statistics show this is true: there is about one store for every 80 people. Italians have an even greater choice, with about one retail outlet for every 60 people, but in France, Germany, the U.S. and the U.K. shoppers get by with one store for about 120 to 160 people. (With its large population, though, the U.S. still has a lot of stores, around the same number as in Japan.) Incidentally, though giant supermarkets are making inroads, many retailers in Japan are small, with fewer employees than in stores in most of the other countries mentioned.

<p>

Games of chance are played throughout the world. In Japan, five kinds of 

gambling enjoy legal recognition: horse racing, bicycle racing, boat racing, motorcycle racing and the National Lottery. But until recently, gambling, even in its legalized forms, was a kind of sub-culture in Japan. Respectable citizens sought their entertainment elsewhere. In recent years, though, things have been changing dramatically: gambling has become a respectable leisure activity. This issue of Japan Pictorial focuses on the increasingly upscale clientele for games of chance, and their search for a formula to win.

Exchanges: Asian Folk Festival Adds to the Joie-de-vivre of Paris

</title>

<body bgcolor=ffffff>

<h2><b>

Asian Folk Festival Adds to the <i>Joie-de-vivre</i> of Paris

</h2></b>

<hr><p>

A celebration called Jours de F&ecirc;te '94 Paris brought the atmosphere of a Japanese festival to Paris for three days, starting on 3 June 1994. Events showing Japan's fun-loving side include <i>kamikiri</i> (silhouette paper cutting), top spinning, making small animal figures from rice gluten, blowing soap bubbles, <i>iai</i> (swordsmanship) and ring tossing.

	<br>It can be said that France's feast days bear a resemblance to Japanese festivals held on days called <i>ennichi</i>. Long ago the Japanese dedicated these days to Shinto and Buddhist deities, to celebrate the personal connection they felt they had with the gods. But in the 15th and 16th centuries <i>ennichi</i> evolved into festivals for the masses, and, since the Meiji period (1868-1912), they have lost most of their religious significance. Instead, they have become fairs for people to enjoy themselves and watch street performances.

	<br>Jours de F&ecirc;te '94 Paris was coordinated by a Tokyo group of artists headed by Majima Naoko. Majima says <i>ennichi</i> festivities in rural Japan always bring out a spirit of fun-loving spontaneity that, once experienced, is unforgettable. She personally feels this dynamism springs from Japan's roots in Asia. Majima was most interested in seeing how an Asian <i>joie-de-vivre</i> would be perceived in France.





<p><hr>

<img src=p14-01.gif>

Performers indulge in witty banter while making all kinds of shapes with <i>Nanking tama-sudare</i>. Each <i>sudare</i> is 

made of 56 bamboo sticks joined together with thread. Takamine Tendo, a recognized master of the art, has 

also performed in New York.


<hr>

<br clear=all>

<img src=p15-01.gif align=left>





Majima (second from right) has a special skill in turning ordinary pieces of cloth into <i>objets-d'art</i>. She says her view of art changed during the almost two years she spent organizing Jours de F&ecirc;te '94 Paris. "Japanese artists tend to emulate European styles, but <i>ennichi</i> street artists and performers have their own traditional ways, which strike a stronger chord within me."

<hr>

<br clear=all>

<img src=p15-02.gif align=right>



Jours de F&ecirc;te '94 Paris was organized by a friendship committee of 53 members. Takamine Tendo is one of the 46 performers on the committee (the oldest one is 87). They say they do not mind working without pay, since the chance to demonstrate the energy behind Japan's folk performances is reward enough.

Perspectives: Mail-Order Shopping

</title>

<body bgcolor=ffffff>

<h2><b>



Mail-Order Shopping <br>- Trustworthy, but No Personal Touch



</h2></b>

<hr><p>



<b>Recession Hasn't Hurt Shopping by Mail and Telephone</b><p>



Like many countries around the world, Japan has been hit by recession. Buyers are not buying. Yet one exception is mail-order shopping: Japan's consumers may be cautious, yet they are still swayed by what they hear on the radio and see on television. Radio, unlike TV, cannot show the product, but if the voice coming over the waves is that of a celebrity whom consumers trust, the response rate is high. And only about 1% of all items promoted in this way are returned for a refund, compared with a 3% to 5% rate of return for goods advertised through other media.

	<br>Cable television has gotten into the act with trendy programs for gourmets. In a typical show, a reporter, nibbling at samples, interviews the manager of a seafood company located in a beautiful marine setting. Fish is sent directly to viewers who place orders through the show.

	<br>Of course, catalog shopping still pulls in the greatest volume of mail-order sales (about 46%). Inserts in newspapers attract the next largest number (25%), followed by television (5%), then radio (1.8%).

<p><hr>

<img src=p18-01.gif><p>



Every weekday this Kanto region radio station introduces something new. These pearl necklaces must have been a bargain at 198,000 yen (about US$1,900), because more than 150 people ordered them.


<hr>

<br clear=all>

<img src=p18-02.gif align=right>



The heart of a mail-order company is the room where orders are processed. This company uses television and catalogs to attract buyers, and on a busy day receives more than 10,000 telephone calls.

<br clear=all>

<hr>

<img src=p19-01.gif align=left>

Mail-order companies try to satisfy consumer demand for inexpensive goods of excellent quality. But customers may want more: to see, first-hand, what they are buying. In this TV studio, the company displays some of its wares, then invites people to a display center to pick up the goods they want.

Spotlight: Teaching Means Sharing Feelings

</title>

<h2><b>

Teaching Means Sharing Feelings

</h2></b>

<hr><p>



<b>Exciting Discoveries in the World of Chemistry</b><p>

"Mankind has made fantastic discoveries over the years, but we still don't truly understand the process behind many things that happen around us all the time. For example, how does photosynthesis occur? I often tell my students that their future work will be to greatly increase our understanding of nature."

<br>Professor Kuroda Reiko teaches at the University of Tokyo, at both the College of Arts and Sciences and the graduate school. She is also the mentor of eight researchers in her own laboratory, exploring the common ground shared by physical chemistry and biochemistry. Her research centers on molecular recognition, trying to learn more about how molecules recognize each other. Kuroda has broken this research into two areas: chirality (how asymmetric molecules in living things can recognize each other's right- and left-handedness), and DNA base sequence recognition (how miniscule amounts of codes are chosen from a tremendous store of genetic information). Kuroda's research takes her inside cells, but her future ambition is to go further, learning how cells communicate with one another.


<p><hr>

<img src=p24-01.gif>



After obtaining her doctorate, Kuroda moved to the United Kingdom in 1975 to conduct research at London University, then returned to Japan in 1986 after being named assistant professor at the University of Tokyo. In 1992 she was promoted to the position of full professor.


<br clear=all>

<hr>

<img src=p24-02.gif align=left>

"I try to teach my second-year students not only the basics of chemistry but the latest 

discoveries as well. I want them to feel the thrill that comes from groping towards 

understanding, and the excitement that 

awaits when they finally do understand."

<br clear=all>

<b>Freedom of Expression in Life and Art</b><p>

Steven Doma-Mik&oacute; has roots in three countries: Hungary, Japan and Tonga. In Japan he teaches his unique style of acrylic painting. In the Kingdom of Tonga he serves as court painter, doing portraits for the royal family. And he keeps in touch with Hungary, where he was born into a family of counts, by editing and publishing "Inter Japan," a Hungarian-language magazine on Japan's economy and culture.

<br>Since his arrival in Japan in 1979, Steven has had exhibitions all over the country. His knowledge of Japan prompted him to open a museum of Japanese culture in Hungary. But in 1983 his efforts to bring the two countries' cultures closer together were thwarted when the Hungarian Communist regime, labeling him an anti-socialist activist, confiscated all his property. Yet this setback resulted in support from the United Nations, and in his being granted permanent resident status in Japan.

<br>"I think it's great Japanese youth are going abroad. They may find it difficult, but the best experience they can have is to travel alone without a word of Japanese, eating the local food and learning what the people think."

<hr>

<img src=p25-01.gif align=left>



Doma-Mik&oacute;'s interest in Japan started in Budapest when he was a university student in fine arts. He now gives courses in 

illustration at the Niigata College of 

Art and Design.

Students are amazed at what one can do with a razor, sponge, sandpaper and cotton swabs. "Artists usually guard their techniques like trade secrets, but why? Tools are just a means to an end; the goal of art is to share experiences and feelings."

Destinations: Hagi, a Former Castle Town

</title>

<body bgcolor=ffffff>

<img src=../jpsmart2.gif>

<h2><b>



Hagi, a Former Castle Town



</h2></b>

<hr><p>



<b>Past and Present Intertwined</b><p>

Hagi's charm lies in its quiet and historic surroundings. Quiet, because the population is under 50,000 and the topography is ideal - hills on three sides, the Japan Sea and seven islands on the other. Historic, because for centuries Hagi was a feudal castle town. Hagi is situated in Honshu's westernmost prefecture, Yamaguchi.

	<br>From the summit of nearby Mount Tadoko (383 meters above sea level) one has a good view of the city's geography: built on a delta, Hagi has water on all sides. The air, for the average Japanese tourist coming from a large and noisy city, is remarkably pure - sounds from below penetrate unfiltered to 

the highlands. 

	<br>For about 260 years, from the beginning of the seventeenth century until the Meiji Restoration, Hagi was the castle town of the Mori family of feudal lords. To this day there remains the atmosphere of what was once a center of power, far removed from the central government of those times. A tourist will happen upon a way of life that draws on the achievements of another era. Old <i>samurai</i> residences are still lived in. A building erected long ago on the site of a school which once educated the children of feudal retainers is still used by its successor elementary school. To this day, people wash with water flowing through channels on its way to the rice fields.

	<br>After centuries of national isolation, the Meiji Restoration modernized Japan and set it on a new path. Energetic young men from Hagi were in the vanguard of this movement - Yoshida Shoin, Takasugi Shinsaku, Kido Takayoshi, Ito Hirobumi and Yamagata Aritomo, men whose names are familiar to every serious student of Japanese history. It is somehow paradoxical that from the ancient and provincial town of Hagi there sprang such an innovative spirit.





<p><hr>

<img src=p26-01.gif>

From Mount Tadoko, you can see the entire city of Hagi. The urban area on the delta is known as "<i>kawauchi</i>" (within the river), while people with homes off the island say they live in "<i>kawasoto</i>" (off the river).


<hr>

<img src=p26-02.gif align=left>

A stroll through the city takes you past the former homes of wealthy merchants and of influential people who changed the course of Japanese history during and after the Meiji Restoration (1868).


<br clear=all>

<img src=p27-01.gif align=right>



Hagi's castle ruins may be the main attraction in Shizuki Park, but in the first part of April the cherry blossoms are equally impressive.

Charting Japan: Trying to Beat the Odds in Japan

Trying to Beat the Odds in Japan



</h2></b>
<hr><p>



Japan has no casinos. But this does not mean that the Japanese are immune to the gambling spirit. Many are more than eager to play the lottery game, on the off chance that a tiny investment in numbers will result in millions of yen. One out of three adults buys lottery tickets, with that third purchasing tickets an average of five times a year, and dishing out a total of about 20,000 yen (US$200).* But the current global recession, which many once thought Japan could sail through unperturbed, has put a dent into the amount of money the Japanese are willing to throw to the winds of chance.

<img src="../img/ph1.gif" align="right">
<ul><dd>Shakoki-Dogu (the earthen figure with something like sunglasses) was our treasure, especially for me who was born near to the relics of Kamegaoka.  Afterwards I had a look of the relics of Korekawa and I knew the culture of Jomon Age was highly advanced and vastly spread.  My initial understanding was, however, that Kore-kawa relics was a treasure of just Aomori Pref.  In the past ten years I have been able to gain a better understanding as lots of relics of Jomon Age were dug up in many places including Aomori pref.  and many new facts became known to us.  It is the north-eastern (Tohoku) district that was the center of Japan at the ancient time, I wonder.  The truth is the theory that the north of Shirakawa is the secluded area of Japan is just a viewpoint of Yayoi Age culture.<br>
<dd>It was last summer that the relics of Sannai Maruyama made its appearance before our face, awakened from 5,000 years sleep.  Really indescribable is the excitement I felt when I saw the vast 5 hectare relics.<br>
<dd>All the remains which show they led a collective life here for 1,500 years completely exploded the image of Jomon people who they say hunted and collected for living from place to place.  The existence of a great civilization of 5,000 years ago is what a lot of remains dug up there try to tell.  It is said that the relics is already beyond "a Japanese civilization" and that it should be added as the fifth to "the four greatest civilizations" in the world which school textbooks tell us.<br>
<dd>If an institute to preserve and research the relics is to be created, it should bear characteristics of being national and international, not local.  My desire is to let it known to people at home and abroad.<p>

<dd>"Huge wooden pillars of 4,500 years ago dug up  More than 20 meters high building ?  Possibley surpassing Yoshinogari"<br>
<dd>It was on 16th, July, 1994.  The Asahi reported the relics of Sannai Maruyama as top news in the front page of her eveninger.  The report said three wooden pillars of about 80 centimeters in diameter and their six pits were discovered.  According to it, the building existed in more ancient times than the relics of Yoshinogari in Saga pref. by two thousand and several hundred years and it was more than 20 meters high, possibly surpassing the many-storied building in Yoshinogari.<br>
<dd>She also reported in the top of her city news page a picture of the mound which shows layers of soil and earthenware for 1,000 years.  The story said the ancient inhabitants drew a dividing line between graveyard and dwelling area and that they seem to have had the continuity of dwelling and the social norm.<br><img src="../img/ph12.gif" align="left">
<dd>A novelist Hideo Osabe, reading the report in Tokyo, said "I was all of a tremble in amazement and delight."  Ryotaro Shiba also said "A romance spread. I rejoiced."  The name Sannai Maruyama relics has been absorbing public attention from all over Japan since that day because it exploded the Jomon theory which says Jomon people didn't settle in a place, depending on hunting and collecting for life.<br>
<dd>Sannai relics attracted attention not only from archaeologists and experts but from many ordinary civilians.  The decision to preserve the relics was officially made in the mounting fever among ordinary people.  I continuously watched the relics during my two years stay in Aomori bureau of the Asahi.  In the meantime I put everyday occurence on record.  I'd like to report some informations and episodes regarding the relics from next time on.<br>

<dd>It was last summer that the relics of Sannai Maruyama made its appearance before our face, awakened from 5,000 years sleep.  Really indescribable is the excitement I felt when I saw the vast 5 hectare relics.<br>
<dd>All the remains which show they led a collective life here for 1,500 years completely exploded the image of Jomon people who they say hunted and collected for living from place to place.  The existence of a great civilization of 5,000 years ago is what a lot of remains dug up there try to tell.  It is said that the relics is already beyond "a Japanese civilization" and that it should be added as the fifth to "the four greatest civilizations" in the world which school textbooks tell us.<br>
<dd>If an institute to preserve and research the relics is to be created, it should bear characteristics of being national and international, not local.  My desire is to let it known to people at home and abroad.<p>

<H2>Newly discovered rank of grave telling us the city plan in jomon Age</H2><br>
<ul>
<img src="../img/S02.gif" align="right">
<h3>A wonder of 210 meter long grave rank</h3>
<ul><dd>Aomori prefectual authority has excavated some part of Sannai Maruyama
Relics since last July in order to confirm the magnitude of grave for
the national designation of a historic site.<br>
<dd>We already knew the existence of a grave of about 120 tombs in two
rows which stretches from the central part of remains of houses group
to the east. It was about 90 meter long each. We have now confirmed the
grave rank is longer to the east.<br>
<dd>The grave confirmed by October 27th is thought to have existed in the
mid term of Jomon Age. A tomb is about 1.5`2.0 meter long, about 60`80
centimeter wide and about 20`40 centimeter deep. The new discovery increased
the total distance of grave rank to about 210 meter.<br>
<dd>10 flint arrowheads dug up from one of the newly discovered tombs give
us some suggestions of the entombing method and social strata at that ancient
times.<br>
<dd>The 210 meter length of the grave rank goes by far beyond our common
sense about Jomon Age. So huge is Sannai Maruyama Relics.<p>

<img src="../img/S01.gif" align="left">

<h3>City structure now visible with a  stone circle as her center</h3>
<dd>Tombs are placed in good order in two rows on both sides of a passage.
Judging from the dirty color of the passage soil, we can know Sannai Maruyama
people incessantly walked on it at that time.<br>
<dd>To the south of the grave rank there are buried valley gutter which
is not dug up yet and the west parking lot of integrated sports park
where we discovered 56 tombs in two rows in 1976. We also found a tomb
with a stone circle at the western edge of both grave rank. This is possibly
a proto type of that of nationally designated Komakino Relics which existed
in the last term of Jomon Age, about 4000 years ago. Aomori city authority
suspended her city planning road construction and preserved it.<br>
<dd>Hiroyasu Okada, a specialist, saidG<br>
<dd>I think the grave was deliberately formed, judging from its disposition.
We need to examine the grave as one body, not as an individual tomb separately
from our excavating research. There is a possibility that two rows of the
grave rank are further stretching with the stone circle as their center.
Remains of houses are also supposed to be the case. They are very important.<p>

Some interested members of Aomoriprefectural assembly started a new gathering for the preservation just5 days later. On the same day 3 standing committees of the assembly listenedto the issue. Toru Sasaki, a prefectural superintendent of educationalaffairs, showed his recognition that the relics are treasures of the wholenation.<br><dd>Citizens made inquiries one after another about the relics to organizationsconcerned. Hiroyasu Okada, a staff member of Aomori prefectural centerfor research into buried cultural properties who is responsible for theexcavation, was so busy in the field receiving many visitors includingofficials, assemblymen and reporters, but repeatedly explained the relicsto them as much as time permitted.<br><dd>gWonderfulI So many earthenwares are there.h Cheerful voices of childrenechoed in the excavated field of Sannai Maruyama on July 19th when wefelt painful in the rays of the summer sun. Visiting there were 80 sixthgrade students of local Sannai Nishi(west) primary school for observationstudy. Some excavating workers were mothers of the school students. Theywere forced to remove clay very carefully. 80 students had planned theobservation study about a week before and applied to the field headquarters.The plan was realized just after the report of huge pillars excavation.The children were apparently surprised to see the pillars and very numerousearthenwares in piles.<br><img src="../img/S08.gif" align="left"><dd>The center finished research into only half of the 60 thousand squaremeters projected place for a diamond until then for two years and a half.As a result the excavation including earthenwares and stone implements wasas many as 40 thousand corrugated cardboard boxes. The quantity of excavationin Sannai Maruyama Relic spanning for only a year was a match for thatof all the relics in Aomori pref. for the past 20 years.<br><dd>For archaeology which makes a letterless age an object of scientificstudy remains are the most important material. Archaeologists can inferthe ancient life, culture, social organization and ancient people's thinkingway from the excavation. The more numerous the excavation is, the moreconvincing the inference is. That's why the numerous remains dug up inSannai Maruyama Relics attract an interest of many archaeologists.<br><dd>Akio Kogawa, a vice-schoolmaster of Sannai Nishi primary school, wholed a party of students there saidGgNot only children but I am surprisedto find such a tremendously great place in the neighborhood. I hope we can restore tall buildings and preserve the relics.h A student said livelyGgI thought ancient people were primitive, but they made such things.

<title>BUSINESS OTSUKIAI / CHAPTER 1</title>

<body bgcolor=ffffff>

<img src=../bobar.gif alt=BUSINESS OTSUKIAI>

<hr>
<h3>CHAPTER 1  APPOINTMENTS</h3>

</head>

<body>

<hr>
<h3>When Asking for Someone's Time, Be Polite</h3>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>Once it's clear you have to meet, call for an appointment<br>
-even if the time and place have been decided.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>As a rule, you should make all the calls for the appoint-<br>
ment if it's going to be your first meeting.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>Good manners require that you ask the other person<br>
whether the time and place for the meeting are convenient.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>Sometimes you may need to contact an important<br>
executive or other well-known figure. Go ahead with the<br>
contact only after finding out who is the right person to go<br>
through first.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>Always get the name of the other person's colleagues or<br>
secretary-just in case.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>Never break an appointment. It's also extremely impolite<br>
to cut short the time for the meeting or to leave in the middle.<p>

<hr>
<h3>The Time to Make the Appointment is<br>
When You First Think You May Need to<br>
Meet the Other Person</h3>

<img src=10.gif align=left>
 In business, courtesy requires that appointments for meet
ings should be made a week in advance. Even when people
routinely meet at each other's companies, it's still important to
leave at least a day between the request and the meeting itself . And
when the meeting time can't be set at that moment, it's always best
to ask that the other person hold a certain day open just in case.
That way you can call the afternoon before to set the time and not
create the impression that you're being sudden and unreason
able. The secret to making appointments successfully is always
letting people know as far in advance as possible. And that can
also be the secret that will lead to success in your job, too.<p>

When you absolutely need to meet someone fast, it's all right
to ask for an hour of their time the following day. But, unless you
are extremely busy, you should be flexible enough to meet at
whatever time the other person specifies.

<hr>
<h3>Considerations for the First Meeting</h3>

When you want to meet someone for the first time on a
business matter you wish to propose, first think of the right time to
call the person. That time probably will be different for each
company, but, in general, around 10 a.m. is best.<p><p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>When the right person gets on the line, first
 tell him who you are, and then ask if you can speak to him for about five
 minutes. After he agrees, briefly tell him the nature of your business,
 ask what time is most convenient for him and then adjust your schedule to
 it. Even when it's urgent that you meet someone, you should be
 ready to offer several different options for the meeting time.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>When the person you wish to speak with is not
 at his desk, ask someone to tell him that you will call again later.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>When the other person has to come to your
 company, be sure to send a map of the route to him either by fax or
 by mail, and also send your business card. To make it easier for him
 to contact you also write on the card the name of someone he can
 speak to when you're away from your desk.<p>


<hr>
<h3>When Problems Come Up</h3>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>When you're meeting outside the office,
 it's best to provide a number at which you can be contacted. Also,
 if the meeting is to take place in a public place, like a train
 station or public building, always arrive five minutes before
 the appointed time.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>When it looks as if you'll be late for an appointment, always call<br>
the other person's office. If it seems that you'll be ten minutes late,
for example,then it's best to say you'll be 15 minutes late.That five
minutes of margin will probably be necessary. And if you actually
manage to make it to the appointed place only ten minutes late,
then the other person will probably take it as a sign of your
sincerity that you came in such a hurry you shaved five minutes
off your time.<p>

<h3>CHAPTER 2  YOUR COMPANY'S FIRST IMPRESSION </h3>

</head>

<body>

<hr>
<h3>Showing Visitors In and Out <br>
is a Chance to Develop Business</h3>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>A visitor watches everything that goes on in the company.<br>
All employees should greet visitors crisply and bow when<br>
meeting them.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>When showing a visitor around your company, be<br>
reserved but smile and never turn your back towards him.<br>
Always be sure to personally escort him when he has to go to<br>
another building or someplace else that may be difficult for<br>
an outsider to find.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>Don't ever let anyone feel that they're not being given the<br>
fullest courtesy in a meeting or reception room. Be sure to<br>
keep the doors to all other reception rooms closed.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>If you see a visitor who looks as if he's waiting for someone,<br>
politely inquire whether you can help him.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>here's a tendency for some people to look very serious<br>
when seeing a guest out. Keep a friendly patter going until<br>
you see the person out of your office to the elevator.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>Seeing a visitor out of your office is a good chance to<br>
remind him of another matter of importance or to ask a<br>
favor. Don't miss the opportunity.<p>

<hr>
<h3>A Sharp Person Can Make Up His Mind<br>
about a Company from What He Hears<br>
Employees Whispering to Each Other in<br>
the Halls</h3><p>

<h4>Always Be Conscious That How You Look and<br>
Behave Reflects on Your Company!</h4>

<img src=12-1.gif align=left>
Mr. T, the assistant to the president of a certain large
company, makes it a practice-whenever his boss is to visit the
president of another company-to drop by their offices several
times on the pretext of making arrangements for the meeting.<p>

The real objective in doing this is to decide whether the other
company would be a good partner to do business with or not.<p>

"It's only proper that the general affairs person or the special
assistant to the president at that company will be very courteous, "
he explained. "But I make it a point to talk to young employees I
see in the corridors I'll inquire about how to get to another office in
the building, for example. How they answer gives me a good idea
about the state of employee training and the atmosphere in the
company. I also listen to catch what they whisper among them
selves. This tells a lot about the quality of employees."<p>

Many visitors come to your offices.Among them will be some
who can determine the fate of the company. Welcoming guests is
not just the job of the receptionist: there must be an attitude that
the whole company welcomes the visitor.<p>
<hr>
<img src=../hand.gif align=left>Inform the receptionist ahead of time that you are expecting a
guest, giving him or her the visitor's name and the time of the
appointment. When the receptionist shows your visitor he is
expected, it makes for a warmer welcome.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>Reserve a conference room in advance if you plan to have a
meeting. Make sure that all other conference room doors are
closed. This avoids giving the impression that there are better
conference rooms than the one you'll be meeting in.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>Don't leave the visitor stranded in the reception area. There
should be a sofa for visitors to sit on and magazines and company
brochures for them to read. Visitors waiting near the entrance
should be asked if they need help.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>When coming upon visitors in the corridors, be sure to bow.<p>

After showing important visitors or older people to confer
ence or meeting rooms, ask what they would care to drink.<p>

Mr. O, a secretary to the head of one of Japan's most
powerful government ministries, tells this story:<p>

"Whenever the Minister visited companies in the middle of
summer, the air conditioning would invariably be turned all the
way up. As his secretary, it fell to me to make sure that he was
never served the usual cold drinks. Whenever I found cups of
deliciously brewed hot tea waiting for us in a chilly conference
room in July or August, I thought to myself, 'Now here's a
company that knows what it's doing.' "<p>

Whenever an important visitor is scheduled to come to the
office, it's essential to go over all the details with your boss in
advance.<p>


<hr>
<h3>Seeing Visitors Out</h3>

<img src=13-1.gif align=left>
"The first time, I was shown out to the elevator, and the next
time only as far as the receptionist. It makes you feel like you're not
that important anymore."<p>

Even if you think that by now you've become close enough to
dispense with formalities, the visitor might not feel the same way.
The best way is to always see visitors out the same way. Decide
how far you will see people out-to the reception desk, to the
elevator or best of all to their car-and don't change it.<p>

Also, when you see your guests as far as the elevator, in that
minute or so until the elevator comes, use the chance productively
to thank them for the useful discussion, bring their attention to a
matter of importance or encourage them. Above all, don't run off to
other things without properly ending the visit.<p>

<h3>CHAPTER 3 <br>
MEETING VISITORS:
MAKE THEM FEEL THEY'RE NUMBER ONE</h3>

</head>

<body>

<hr>
<h3>The Feeling is:<br>
"We're Honored to Have You Visit Us."</h3>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>Run through the final checklist ten minutes before the<br>
meeting: Coffee and tea ready? Ashtrays? Materials all in<br>
place?<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>When the visitor arrives, chat for awhile about general<br>
topics and create a pleasant mood.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>When more than one person is meeting with a guest, it's<br>
best if everyone knows the agenda along which the discus<br>
sion will progress.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>Your attitude should be: "The customer is always right."<br>
Your attention to the small details tells a lot about your<br>
company's sensitivity to the visitor.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>Visitors who arrive without notice can also lead to<br>
business. Treat them very courteously.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>During your meeting, make the visitor feel he's the most<br>
important person you know. Don't leave the room or take<br>
phone calls unless it's absolutely necessary.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>There is a flow to meetings. Leading the flow carefully can<br>
produce results.<p>

<hr>
<h3>Preparation Begins as Soon as You Set<br>
the Time for the Meeting</h3>

<img src=15-1.gif align=left>
Everything is going well until you show the very important
 visitor into the conference room. There on the table are ashtrays
 brimming with ashes and cigarette butts and dirty coffee cups
 that haven't been cleared away yet. And on top of it all, the air in
 the room is stale and stifling. As you throw the window open, you
 pick up the phone to call to have someone come into the
 conference room to pick things up. But no matter how much you
 try to recover, the damage is done. The visitor doesn't have quite
 the same impression of your company.<p>

It's only common sense that conference rooms should
 always be kept clean. Reserve the room ahead of time and then
 shortly before the meeting check to make sure everything is ready:
tea or coffee, ashtrays and air conditioning. When documents are
 to be used at the meeting make sure that enough copies for
 everyone attending are made and placed in the room ahead of time.<p>

<h4>Set a Pleasant Tone to Meetings</h4>

Rather than start with the main topic as soon as the visitor
 is seated, you can create a more pleasant mood by first chatting a
 little about unrelated matters. Look at this phase of the meeting
 as a kind of warm-up for the actual business talk to come.<p>

Coffee and tea should be served with the right timing. There
 are those who will turn to a subordinate at a meeting and tell him
 to fetch tea. But it's better to ask someone who will not be at the
 meeting to serve beverages. This tells your visitors that each
 person at the meeting, even the lowliest new employee, has his or
 her own important function to play.<p>

<h4>More Than One is Better</h4>

Even if there is only one visitor, it's best to have several
 people from your company meet him. If several people can report
 on the conclusions reached and the progress of negotiations, it's
 possible for the company to avoid making a bad judgement based
 on the comments of one person.<p>

Also, having a number of people to meet the visitors means
 they can handle all the functions that may come up in the
 meeting, including the helper who'll go to fetch necessary docu
ments that are not in the room; the controller who'll prevent
 anyone from getting way ahead of the others at the meeting; and
 the mood maker who sets the appropriate feeling for the confer
ence.<p>

Having several people meet can also be desirable when
 dealing with complaints from outside the company, or when
 uninvited visitors turn up.<p>

<h4>Introduce Everyone</h4>

Make sure that everyone who attends the meeting is prop
erly introduced, even the lowest-ranking new employee. Intro
ducing your subordinates makes it easier for them to speak up if
 they have to. But remember to keep the introductions brief and to
 the point.<p>

A key part of the introduction is to let the visitor know to
 whom he can speak, and at what telephone extension, when you
 are out of the office.<p>

<h4>Fruitful Meetings That End on Time</h4>

After completing the preliminaries, the job is to conclude as
 much business as possible and reach agreement within the time
 allotted for the meeting. As the meeting proceeds, keep in mind
 how the meeting is moving and whether the appropriate amount
 of time is being given to each item on the agenda. If time is running
 short, briefly cover all of the main points and summarize as much
 as necessary.<p>

<hr>


<h3>"You're a Very Important Person to Our Company." </h3>
<h4>Skillfully Staging the Flow of the Meeting </h4>
<h4><i>If the Mood of the Meeting Turns Sour, Change It!</h4></i>

If the visitor starts leafing through documents when there's
 no need to or suddenly grows silent, the mood of the meeting can
 become strained. You can change the course of the meeting at this
 point by bringing up another aspect of the discussion or relating
 an interesting episode that is somehow related to the issue at
 hand. In using this tactic, be careful not to get carried away with
 what you are saying and forget about focusing on what's going on
 in the visitor's mind.<p>

<h4><i>When You Want to Make a Note of the Important Points<br>
in the Conversation</h4></i>

You're dutifully listening to a visitor's presentation. As his
 remarks turn to another subject, your expression changes, you
 whip out your pen and begin taking notes. Not surprisingly, the
 visitor feels that nothing he has said up to this point has struck
 you as worth recording. In other words, everything he has said
 until now has been wasted on you.<p>

Mr. M, the head of general affairs at a trading company,
 gives this advice about taking notes: "Make sure you have a pad
 with you from the very start of the conversation. In addition to
 jotting down the main points, take notes at other phases in the
 conversation." This is helpful because it keeps the other person
 guessing at what your company finds of most interest.<p>
 
<h4><i>When Someone Calls the Boss While He is<br>
Receiving a Visitor</h4></i>

Of course, the best response is to say that he is busy
 receiving a visitor and will call back later. But when it is an urgent
 matter, you can give him a message. Of course, while the visitor is
 talking you can not pass your boss a note without giving offense.<p>

If you have to break into the conversation, wait until your
 boss is speaking to the visitor, and then pass him the note. At the
 same time, be sure to ask the visitor to forgive the intrusion. You
 always want to convey the message to the visitor that he is very
 important to your company. If you take calls often, though, you
 can give the impression that the company doesn't care about the
 visitor at all.<p>

Of course, no one expects every business meeting will result
 in a deal. But whether or not the visitor leaves with his feelings
 intact will have repercussions long after the meeting is over.
Receiving a visitor as you would like to be received will improve
 your image and that of your company in the visitor's eyes.<p>

<hr>

<h3>Receiving Visitors with the Right Touch</h3>

"You can never spend enough time training employees to
 serve customers properly," explains Mr. K, a veteran executive in
 the employee training department of a major department store.
 "We train our employees, for example, to walk three paces behind
 the customer."<p>

Giving this kind of attention to the small details results in a
 level of service that always leaves the customer with a positive
 feeling. To touch the customer's heart demands attentive service
 that doesn't overlook any of the details.<p>

<h4><i>Preparing Things for Visitors Properly</h4></i>

There is a proper way to give things to visitors at meetings:<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>take the cap off the pen so that the visitor can use it right away;<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>if the visitor asks for a scissors, don't pass it point first, and;<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>when documents or books are being shown, make sure that
 there are tabs on them to make it easy to find the relevant sections.<p>

<h4><i>Another Cup?</h4></i>

If you have served your guest a cup of coffee at the start of the
 meeting, it's often useful to offer another cup when you start
 talking about the main issue of the meeting. Whether he accepts
 or not, your visitor will appreciate the kindness you've shown.<p>

<hr>

<h3>Using Your Wits Can Make You<br>
Shine a Hundred Times Brighter
</h3>
<h4><i>When a Manager Can't Come to Meet<br>
the Visitor Right Away</h4></i>

Tell the receptionist to let the visitor know that someone
 from the manager's section will come to meet him shortly. Having
 done this, don't assume it's all right to keep the visitor waiting
 indefinitely.<p>

In addition to letting the visitor know how long it will be
 before the person will come for him, provide a hot beverage and
 reading materials to make the wait more pleasant.<p>


<h4><i>When the Person Being Visited is Not in the Office</h4></i>


"This often happens, " says securities industry executive Mr.
M. "If by chance no one knows where the executive has gone it
 could hurt an outsider's view of our company, so we usually
 explain that he's in the building but away from his desk at the
 time. The executive's subordinate or boss will then come out to
 meet the visitor."<p>

<h4><i>Taking Care of a Visitor's Luggage</h4></i>

Sometimes visitors who are travelling on business will be
 carrying luggage with them. Before formally greeting them, offer
 to have reception hold their luggage for them.<p>

<h4><i>When the Visitor Has Forgotten Something<br>
at Your Company</h4></i>

Estimate how long it will take him to return to his company
 and then call him yourself. If the person is not there yet, leave
 word that you called and that you will call him again later. Under
 no circumstances should you say that you have found what he left
 behind and wish to return it to him. Being labelled forgetful is a
 minus factor and could hurt his standing within his company.<p>

<h3>Otsukiai Begins with a Single Business Card</h3>

<img src=20-1.gif align=left>
Mr. K, an executive for an electronics manufacturing com
 pany, was to meet an important client when he realized he was out
 of business cards. This is how he handled the situation:<p>

"I was supposed to have business cards and I didn't. In any
 case, I apologized on the spot and then sent a short note the
 following day along with one of my cards. As it happens, it all
 worked out for the best. I left a stronger impression on the
 customer, and ever since then we have been working very
 smoothly with his company."<p>

Mr. K's quick response left his customer with a vivid
 impression of his sincerity and seriousness of purpose . This is far
 from what he had expected would happen.<p>

<h4><i>It's More Productive to Start off Your Introduction by Giving<br>
Your Own Name First Rather Than Your Company's</h4></i>

The most common way to exchange business cards is to say
 your company's name first before saying your own name. Mr. A, a
 bank executive, suggests a better way. "I always give my name
 first, then say it's nice to meet you and tell the other person I'm
 from the finance department of my bank," he reports. Mr. A does
 this because he knows mentioning his name first will leave a
 lasting impression on the person he's meeting.<p>

In banks and other businesses where the relationship
 between the executive and the customer is very important, this
 method seems to be more effective. But whatever the order, the
 spirit behind exchanging cards is to create a mutual relationship
 with another person.<p>

<h3>Business Cards Can Become Seeds for
New Business</h3>


<h4><i>Exchange Cards as Soon as You Meet</h4></i>

There are many people who think that it's impolite to initiate
 an exchange of cards in a busy place, say for example a train
 station where you have just met the other person. Such people
 often think that it's better to wait until you reach a place where you
 can settle down and talk with the other person. But walking to
 such a place with a person you have not been introduced to can be
 disconcerting and uncomfortable. Remind yourself that there is
 no such thing as a place where it's impolite to offer to exchange
 cards. It's by far much more impolite to meet someone and not
 immediately offer to exchange cards.<p>


<h4><i>Who Goes First?</h4></i>


When a number of people are to exchange cards, the order
 starts with the senior persons and proceeds to those less senior. If
 a higher ranking person from the group you are meeting mistak
enly goes to present his card to a lower ranking person from your
 group, the lower ranking person should be alert enough to step
 back a bit to let his superior exchange cards first.<p>

<h4><i>Starting Up the Conversation</h4></i>

A veteran of over 20 years in sales tells how he develops the
 conversation after exchanging cards: "I look at the person's card
 and ask about the person's name, his department and the origin
 of the company's name. This helps to break the ice with the other
 person."<p>

It's foolish to exchange cards just to learn each other's
 names. Exchanging cards marks the starting line of human
 relationships.<p>

<hr>

<h3>The Business Card:<br>
Your Best Source of Data</h3>


It's often said that the more business cards you collect the
 better a business person you are. But you will never know the
 value of people's cards until you make full use of them.<p>


<h4><i>Make a Map of the Human Networks</h4></i>


Interior decorator Mr. A exchanges cards with everyone he
 can find at the large department store that's one of his best clients .
 "I get cards from everyone from the board of directors on down to
 the lowest ranked new employee, " he says. "By doing this I can see
 who is whose boss, who is whose subordinate and grasp the
 overall picture of what kind of organization the department store
 is."<p>

In short, by using business cards, he constructs a map of all
 the human networks within the company.<p>

Even for people who work in large corporations, these incompany
 power relationships are important. Mr. S, an employee
 of a large pharmaceutical company that hires several hundred
 executives fresh out of universities every year, is a good example.
 Mr. S visits those in the same entering class he belonged to and
 has them show him their business card files.<p>

"In particular, I check the files of friends in different sections
 of the company," he says. "If there is someone in their files I'd like
 to put in my network, I have them introduce me. Thanks to their
 help, I have a good network of connections throughout the whole
 company."<p>

<h4><i>Making Cards a Sales Diary</h4></i>


Sales people who go out and make calls every day collect a
 great many cards. Over a week's time they receive so many cards,
 in fact, that they lose track of them. To cope with the problem, it's
 best to take all the cards you receive and put them in some sort of
 order as soon as you get back to the company. If you write on the
 card the reason you met the person plus any impressions, you'll
 find that it's a lot easier to recall the person's face and other details
 later on. By filing business cards by the date you receive them and
 writing notes on them, you can keep a good daily diary of your
 business activities.<p>

<hr>

<h3>How to Exchange Cards</h3>


<h4><i>Your Pocket is Not a Business Card Holder</h4></i>


Offering a business card you've just pulled out of a shirt
 pocket is impolite. And it's equally offensive to take the card
 you've just received and pop it into the same pocket. The most
 unpardonable offense is taking a card out of or placing a card
 you've received into your back pocket. A business person should,
 at the very least, have a proper business card holder.<p>


<h4><i>When Someone in a Superior Position Offers His Card While<br>
Seated, You Should Stand to Receive It</h4></i>


In a Japanese-style tatami room this may seem a bit
 exaggerated, so you should straighten your back and sit formally
 to receive the card.<p>


<h4><i>Give the Card Directly</h4></i>


It is a breach of etiquette to place your card on the table for
 someone to pick up . It leaves the impression that instead of trying
 to start a relationship with someone, you're trying to avoid him. In
 addition to the bad feeling it leaves,the card itself is difficult to pick
 up off the flat surface of the table.<p>


<h4><i>Bowing is Part of It</h4></i>

Cards are exchanged after the two people have bowed to
 each other properly. You should be careful not to make a
 perfunctory bow, say by lowering your head only, since people
 may take it as an indication of your character as well as the
 character and level of your company. Nevertheless, be careful not
 to bow too deeply. When exchanging cards, bows should be crisp
 and not too low.<p>


<hr>

<h3>Widen Your Human Network with Business Cards</h3>

If you confine your network building to the business world,
you can only reach a limited group of people . But you can also use
cards to extend your networks to other worlds as well.<p>

Mr. H, a ham radio enthusiast for more than 20 years, had
special cards made with his call sign printed on them. He always
carries them along with his business cards.<p>

"After talking for awhile and discovering that the other
person is also a ham, I whip out my ham radio cards," he says.
"Giving people such cards that have some special theme or
interesting or decorative aspect make both people happy and
bring you closer through the experience."<p>

<h4><i>Cards with No Titles</h4></i>

Mr. S, the president of a toy company, has cards that show
his name but no title. Why break with convention and do away
with titles?<p>

"If I go to a pub or a small bar and meet some young people
and become friendly with them, it makes things easier to have a
card with my name only on it," he says . "Now, if I pulled out a card
that said president on it, they'd probably change their tone and
become more formal. There'd be lots of things they wouldn't feel
free to talk about with me. There are many things I want to ask
young people and get an honest answer, and I can't do that unless
they're relaxed when they talk with me. If they just think I'm an
ordinary old man they'll feel at ease with me . That's why I don't put
a title on my cards."<p>

<h4><i>Cards for the Neighborhood</h4></i>

Mr. Y manages a Little League baseball team and carries a
 card he had printed with his name and the inscription "Hiroshi's
 father."<p>

"If you're making an effort to communicate through your
 children," he explains, "then why not put your children's names
 on your cards. . . Thanks in part to these cards, my campaign to
 communicate with the local community is going very well and I
 have made friends I would never have dreamed of in the past."<p>

There are cards for every purpose and people are finding
 more and more new ways to use them. Whether it's your card or
 someone else's, you'll want to treat these small scraps of paper
 that can become either assets or trash as extensions of the person.<p>

<h3>CHAPTER 5<br>
TELEPHONE CALLS</h3>

</head>

<body>

<hr>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>Straighten up and smile when talking on the phone. Your<br>
voice should be crisp and pleasant.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>When apologizing on the phone, it's proper to bow.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>Use the most polite language possible.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>People are often put off by little things you may say on the<br>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>Be sure to thank those who call from outside as well as<br>
those from within the company.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>When you put someone on hold, and it turns out the<br>
called party isn't available, be sure to apologize and explain<br>
the situation.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>Begin your phone calls by asking if you can speak for ten<br>
minutes or so about a particular topic. Before proceeding<br>
be sure the other person agrees.<p>

<hr>


<h3>To Avoid Unpleasantness on the Phone</h3>


"I was in the middle of a phone call and thought I might as
 well have a cigarette since the conversation was going to take
 awhile. I lit up and inhaled when suddenly the person on the other
 end started coughing uncontrollably. 'I'm allergic to cigarette
 smoke, ' he gasped as I hurried to crush it out "<p>

This is one of those truth-is-stranger-than fiction stories
 that is definitely true. At the sound of the lighter and then the
 person exhaling smoke the person listening on the other receiver
 started choking. This indicates what a strong image is transmitted
 over the telephone wires. Even if you work on polishing your
 telephone voice alone and not your attitude toward the caller,
 people will be able to see through you . That's the most frightening
 aspect of the telephone.<p>

On the other hand, if you can work a little sincerity into your
telephone routines, you can make the telephone your most
powerful business tool.<p>

<h4>Most Unpleasant Telephone Experiences-<br>
First Place: "He's Out of the Office"</h4>

You call a company and ask if you can speak to a particular
person. Yes, he's here, please wait, you are told. And wait you do
until finally a voice comes over the line again and tells you that he's
out of the office now. "That's funny," you think to yourself, "it
sounded like he was there at first.'' Especially since you heard
someone call him just before you were put on hold. Naturally, you
wonder if he's trying to avoid you.<p>

We've probably all had this kind of experience. This is why
we should be extremely careful on the telephone.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>If you don't know for sure, don't answer yes when asked if
 someone is in the office. The caller will take that to mean that he is
 definitely in the office. You can say you'll check or that you think
 he may be in the office, and then ask the caller to wait as you put
 the call on hold.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>When the called party is not available, you should say: "I'm very
 sorry, I thought he was at his desk, but he's stepped out of the
 office."<p>

By starting off with "I'm very sorry," you let the caller know
 that you aren't the one he's trying to call and stop him before he
 launches into the conversation he planned to have with the
 person he wanted to speak with first.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>To avoid creating misunderstandings on the telephone, write in
 your destination on the office schedule board if you'll be away from
 your desk more than 10 minutes.<p>

<h4>Most Unpleasant Telephone Experience-<br>
Second Place:Waiting</h4>

<img src=26-1.gif align=left>
If the phone rings three times before anyone picks it up, be
 sure to begin by saying that you're sorry to have kept the caller
 waiting. If it rings five times, say that you're very sorry for the delay.
 If after being answered the call is transferred but then rings for
 more than 10 seconds, the switchboard operator should come on
 the line again and apologize for the delay.<p>

When you have to keep someone on the line while you refer
 to materials or check on facts, remember that the absolute limit
 for keeping someone waiting is 30 seconds. If it looks like it'll take
 longer than that, say you'll call the person back. If the caller offers
 to wait, then you should keep him waiting on the line no longer
 than a minute. Waiting a minute with a telephone receiver in your
 hand feels like waiting five minutes anywhere else.<p>


<h4>"I'm in a Hurry"</h4>

When someone is obviously in a big hurry, observing all the
regular practices for answering the phone may make him irritated. 
If you sense a strong urgency in someone's voice, dispense
with the usual formalities.<p>

<h4>Telephone Tag</h4>

When someone is not there to talk to the caller, saying he's at
a meeting outside and hanging up is not the proper way to
respond. It's your duty to ask if the call is urgent or see what the
call is in reference to so you can find the right person to help.<p>

Here's an example of how you can respond when someone is
not there to answer the phone:<p>

<u>You:</u> Mr.Sato will be back around three o'clock. Shall I have him<br>
call you at that time?<p>

<u>Caller:</u> I'll be in a meeting at three. I'll call him back at five.<p>

<u>You:</u> I don't know Mr. Sato's schedule for later this afternoon, so<br>
shall I ask him to call you around five.<p>

<u>Caller:</u> Fine. If my meeting runs past five, please tell him to get in<br>
touch with Mr. Tanaka here. He knows what this matter is about.<p>

<hr>

<h3>Improving Your Telephone Talk</h3>

We're living in a time when everything from the merging of
 companies to a couple's divorce can be stopped with a single
 phone call. Here are a few hints to add spark to your telephone
 conversations:<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>Straighten up your posture, and try to speak in a slightly higher
 voice. Speak clearly.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>Attune your conversation to the tempo or rhythm of the other
 person's speaking. This helps eliminate any uneasiness the caller
 may feel about not being able to see your face.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>Put feeling into your gestures. When you tell the other person
that you understand his situation, you should put as much feeling into it as you would if you were not on the phone. You
 should also nod your head in agreement. Gestures on the phone
 help to convince the other person of your sincerity.

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>Before hanging up, try to leave an even better impression.
Thank the person for his or her help, and then say you look
forward to speaking with them again.<p>

<h4>A Good Call Covers All Items on the Agenda</h4>

<img src=27-1.gif align=left>
Conversing on the telephone is something that comes
 naturally, but in the ordinary business call, methodically covering
 all the items on the agenda is more important than how well you
 carry on the conversation. This is because you're talking about
 documents or products without having them there in front of your
 eyes for both parties to see.<p>

First, you'll want to write out each item you wish to cover in
 the call so you can check them off as you talk. Then, when you're
 finished going through them, you and the other person should
 once again go over the points that remain to be clarified and the
 problems that still need to be resolved.<p>

For detailed talks, it's necessary to put certain items aside to
 make sure that progress is made on the main topic of business.
 When calls take upwards of 20 minutes, it's better to set aside
 time and meet in person.<p>

<hr>
<h3>CHAPTER 6<br>
FOR EFFECTIVE CONVERSATIONS</h3>

</head>

<body>

<hr>
<h3>Reach the Top Without Straining</h3>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>Before you start talking, make a list either on paper or in<br>
your head of all the main points to be covered as well as the<br>
content of the conversation.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>Assume that people can listen without getting bored for<br>
about two minutes. Lay out the essentials in a businesslike<br>
manner, making frequent pauses to facilitate understand-<br>
ing.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>Using examples can enliven your conversation.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>To make the talk productive, consider your relationship<br>
and distance from the other person in deciding where to<br>
focus your eyes, what gestures to use and what tone to take<br>
in speaking.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>In business, never use crude language or act overly
familiar.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>A good talker is usually also a good listener. You have one<br>
mouth but two ears, so by to do twice as much listening as<br>
talking.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>Using technical terms and unnecessarily difficult expres-<br>
sions will be taken as merely showing off. Avoid them as<br>
much as possible.<p>

<hr>

<h3>Some Believe the Less Said the<br>
Better, But Results Don't Happen<br>
Until You Start Talking</h3>


<img src=29-1.gif align=left>
There are times when it's smart not to say anything. When
 someone is writing a report furiously after having been reprimanded
 by a superior, offering a word of sympathy will probably
 only earn you an angry look.<p>

But conversation is needed for human relationships to
 work. In the beginning there was the word, the Bible says. When
 talking, don't just say the first thing that comes to your mind. For
 a lively conversation, you need to take into account the particular
 situation, the temperament of the other person and the atmosphere.<p>

Ad agency executive Mr. Z tells this story:"The silent ones
 are the toughest customers, aren't they? They listen to your
 presentation looking down at the table, not saying anything. Then
 just when you're about to give up in disgust and leave, they say
 okay to what you're proposing. But rather than be happy with
 that, you're left wishing that they could show some sort of reaction
 to what you're saying."<p>

Every day is full of deadly serious conversations about
 business. Silently listening without reacting to what the other
 person is saying is impolite. "For people who are skillful (but not
 silent) listeners, you want to do more than an ordinary job,"
 explains Mr. Z "For them, 120% isn't too much."<p>
 
<h4>How can you inspire people to do 120% for you?</h4>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>Start off by being positive both in what you say and the gestures
you use. Tell the other person that what he's saying is true and
reasonable, and only then tell him what your position is . Once the
other person understands that you respect him, he'll be more
willing to accept your wishes.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>Every now and then break off from the main topic for a few
minutes. Sometimes these pauses can lead to an entirely fresh,
new development.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>If you want to get someone on your side, sprinkle your
conversation with expressions that show you recognize and value
his opinion: "I see your point, " "That's an excellent observation, " or
some similar expressions. It's only human to crave recognition
and acceptance, and to feel gratified when you receive it. One
precaution: if your praise for the other person sounds affected or
artificial in any way, the effort will be counterproductive.<p>

<h4>How Your Eyes Perform is Also Important</h4>

<img src=31-1.gif align=right>

They say the eyes, too, can speak volumes. Think of your
 eyes as every bit as important as your tongue. Of course, it's best
 to look someone in the eye when you speak with him, but there are
 times when this produces unwanted tension. Try to fix your gaze
 a little below the other person's eyes.<p>

Where you sit, too, can have a lot to do with how the
 conversation flows. The sketch at the right shows a seating
 arrangement for a conversation used in a psychology experiment.
 In this arrangement, C and D were the positions where the most
 conversation was made. F spoke three times as much with E than
 with B, who was directly across the table from him. Keep this
 diagram in the back of your mind, and the next time you have to
 make a seating chart, put yourself in C, the one you most want to
  talk with in position D, and the one you'd like to keep at a
 respectful distance in position F.<p>

<h4>Never Make the Other Person<br>
Feel Uncomfortable</h4>

When speaking to others in your company about visitors,
use the words "gentleman" instead of man and "lady" instead of
woman.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>Rather than say "I believe you're aware of this already," it's
 better to leave open the possibility that he or she isn't. Try instead:
 "Perhaps you may have heard of this already."<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>When greeting people, some have the aggravating habit of
 making remarks about how fat one has become or how pale one
 looks today. Remarks like this are not forgotten and each time
 they are remembered they are more painful.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>If you use expressions like "one of our girls" for a female
 employee or "one of our vendors," it may be offensive not only to
 the person about whom it's being said but also to other noncompany
 people who may overhear.<p>

<h4>Choose Topics that Have a Fresh,<br>
Up-to-Date Feeling</h4>

When sitting down to talk business, it's helpful to start off by
talking about some bright, upbeat and recent development: Ginza
fashions, the latest trends on Tokyo's waterfront project or some
other interesting subject. It may take a little time, but it won't hurt
to do some research and educate yourself about a certain topic so
you can easily speak with authority about it.<p>

<h5><i>Topics to Avoid:</h5></i>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>Topics related to politics or religion. When these topics come up
 people's beliefs or value systems are revealed. It's better to avoid
 such topics in business.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>Rumors about a boss or subordinate, or a related company.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>Children's education problems. When the talk turns to ideals of
 education, personal education stories or complaints about the
 system, people usually feel uncomfortable.<p>

<h4>Pay Attention to the Flow of Things</h4>

In business, it's important to leave people with a positive
 feeling after a meeting. This is why we usually end by telling them
 the meeting was informative, or you're glad you met with them or
 that simply you want to meet them again.<p>

Even when a business meeting bogs down and the talk
 becomes difficult, end on an unemotional note, and give the other
 person credit for his contribution to the meeting. If you see the
 conversation running toward a dangerous topic or rumor, you'll
 want to head it off and direct the flow toward another subject.<p>

Personnel manager Mr. Y puts it this way: "In meetings,
 there's always someone who will strike the right notes and start
 the conversation off beautifully. This has nothing to do with age,
 by the way. I myself like to attend such meetings and observe my
 subordinates without saying anything. That way I can determine
 who I can depend on to run meetings in the future." Conversation
 skills express the person. You can never polish them enough.<p>

<h3>Try to Enliven Meetings-<br>
But Don't Lose Control
</h3>


<img src=../hand.gif align=left>Understand the aims of the meeting before speaking.<br>
Don't take on the role of the one who stirs things up unless<br>
asked.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>After grasping the flow of the meeting, become the mood<br>
maker. Good meeting skills can expand your human network.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>Watch your language . If your speech is either too polite or<br>
too familiar it can put a damper on the meeting.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>Avoid these three: 1. emotional utterances; 2. excessive<br>
circumlocution; 3. argumentiveness or stubbornness.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>If you want to make the meeting a success, start with the<br>
seating arrangements . Those who like to talk should be kept<br>
apart from each other.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>Plan to answer questions and counter any complaints<br>
that are likely to come up. Have an alternative plan and<br>
other materials ready when needed.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>To be truly prepared for the meeting, don't neglect your<br>
nemawashi, the advance informal discussions of the meeting topic.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>It's not good manners to criticize a meeting after it's over.<p>


<hr>


<h3>A Meeting's Success or Failure Depends on<br>
the One Who Moves It Ahead</h3>

"Learn from my failure," says Mr. T, a four-year employee
 who was chosen to run his first meeting: "I double-checked all the
 arrangements: the time, the room reservation, everything. After
 preparing all the materials and distributing them to all present, I
 was looking forward to a perfect meeting. But the meeting ended
 without deciding anything, and I was scolded by the attendees as
 well as by my boss. When I had a chance to think about it later, I
 realized it was because it wasn't clear in my mind what the
 objectives of the meeting were."<p>

All meetings have a specific purpose. If the point of the
 meeting is to solve a problem, you have to begin by analyzing the
 problem. If the aim is to develop ideas, then you use brainstorming
 and other techniques to coax ideas from those attending. In
 short, how the meeting proceeds depends on what the purpose of
 the meeting is.<p>

<h4>Selecting the Attendees</h4>

The selection of those invited to attend the meeting is one
 important element in the process. Keep the following points in
 mind as you work on selecting people:<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>You must balance the ranks of the main attendees.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>Do the attendees feel there is a problem related to the main
topic? Are they in a position to give a responsible opinion on the
subject?<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>Are they from the departments related to or affected by the main
topic? Do they have the authority to plan and implement the main
items on the agenda for the meeting?<p>

After considering these points, you have taken your first
step toward having a fruitful meeting.<p>


<h4>Be Careful about Seating</h4>

We all have our own individual personality traits. When it
comes to meetings, there are those who become high-spirited and
active and those who will only listen to what others are saying
without volunteering anything themselves, including a few who
will doze off during the meeting. As a result, it's necessary to take
some care in how you seat everyone.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>Do not seat those who will have a lot to say in positions next to
each other: A and B, H and I, etc . And, more importantly, don't line
them up alongside the meeting chairman because differences
between them will develop, the discussion will become rancorous
and others won't have the opportunity to speak.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>Those who don't plan to say very much will naturally gravitate
 towards seats that are away from the meeting chairman. Assign
 positions A and I for them as this will make it easy for others to
 speak and facilitate the exchange of opinions.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>People from the same department or section will naturally want
 to take up positions next to each other. Since meetings are not the
 occasion for different departments to open hostilities with each
 other, give adequate consideration to distributing members of the
 same department so as to permit greater interaction between
 everyone at the meeting.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>The opponents of the proposal will tend to sit together at the
 lower end of the table facing the chair. If in advance you position
 one of the proposal's advocates in one of those seats, the flow of the
 discussion can be changed.<p>

To make sure everyone adheres to the chairman's plan for
 the seating arrangements, make place cards in advance and have
 them in place before the attendees arrive.<p>


<h3>Your Real Ability Will Stand Out at Meetings</h3>

<h4><i>Become the Mood Maker</h4></i>

Whether it's a party or any other type of gathering, a mood
 maker is always necessary. So it should surprise no one that this
 is true also for business meetings. People always notice the one
 who leads the others into discussions and can end a meeting on
 an upbeat note.<p>

<img src=35-1.gif>

<h4><i>Know Your Role</h4></i>

If you ask someone who is experienced in chairing meetings,
 you'll find that there are times when you have to assign roles in
 advance to assure that the meeting proceeds smoothly. This
 means, for example, asking one of the participants before the
 meeting to express a certain idea or take a specific position when
 you call on him to speak later.<p>

Since people who are well informed about the issues will
 often be chosen to chair the meeting, adequate advance preparation
 is indispensable.<p>

<h4><i>Learn to Use Pauses</h4></i>

If you are ever confronted with a completely unexpected
 question at a business meeting, don't get flustered. Give yourself
 a minute to organize your thoughts before answering by playing
 for time. Try asking the person to rephrase the question or ask the
 others present whether they understood or have their own
 question about what was asked. By coming back with a question
 at such a point you will gain the time you need to fashion your own
 response.<p>

<h4><i>Never Engage in an Emotional Counterargument</h4></i>

As people begin to argue their opinions more forcefully and
 the arguments grow hotter, the tendency is to defend one's
 position tenaciously more out of a desire to save face than for any
 other reason. At such times, it's important to be able to coolly and
 objectively listen to others' opinions no matter how unreasonable
 you think they are. A meeting is no place to start a fight.<p>

<h4><i>Aim for Concise Expression</h4></i>

At meetings, those who don't speak to the point end up
 irritating the others. The best approach is to make an outline of
 what you want to say in your mind before speaking, and then
 when your turn comes, say it within three minutes at most. The
 following methods can be helpful:<p>

1. Bulleted Method: "I am now going to introduce three
 opinions. The first is. . ."<p>

2. Conclusion Up Front: Tell the meeting what it is you
 believe and then tell them why.<p>

3. Deductive Reasoning:"This is my conclusion. I have
 based this conclusion on the following principles."<p>

4. Inductive Reasoning: "Please consider these five items of
 data first. What we can conclude based on this data is. . ."<p>

<h4><i>Taking Notes at Meetings</h4></i>

A middle-level manager at an insurance company, Mr. F,
 always stands out at meetings. Here he tells how he uses notetaking
 to his advantage: "Whatever is said at a meeting that strikes
 me as really true or, on the contrary, as very doubtful, I jot down on
 a pad of paper. Then when it's time to ask questions, I refer to my
 notes. Whatever you find worthy of recording from another
 speaker's remarks in this way constitutes the key points of the
 speech. Of course, even opinions that strike an emotional chord in
 you still have to be treated in the same businesslike manner."<p>

<h4><i>Excuses Won't Work</h4></i>

When you begin your remarks by taking a humble approach
 and saying you are not a good speaker or you're not used to
 speaking before a group, you're really only trying to make excuses
 for yourself. Say what you have to say with self-confidence and
 you'll be a lot more persuasive.<p>

<h4><i>No Post-Meeting Quarterbacking</h4></i>

During the meeting, they're eager to agree, but once the
 meeting is over they find fault with everything. "What he said is
 crazy. . . that guy doesn't understand anything. . . " The complaints
 are endless.<p>

If you have an opinion at a meeting, you should have the
 courage to express it at the meeting, not afterward.<p>

<h4><i>Be Careful of the Five Meeting-Busters</h4></i>

<u>Outsiders:</u> Those who come late or get up and leave their
 seats, creating an unpleasant atmosphere. They make absurd
 statements.<p>

<u>Replayers:</u> When you finally think you've reached a decision
 and are ready to breathe a sigh of relief, you can count on these
 people to say something that will start everyone steaming again.<p>

<u>Destroyers:</u> Quick to catch any slip of the tongue, these
 meeting wreckers attack especially when they see progress being
 made.<p>

<u>Invaders:</u> They come up with issues that are completely
 unrelated to the topic at hand. Just when you have everyone at the
 meeting stirred up over an issue, they're sure to ask a question
 that's clearly off the mark.<p>

<u>Silencers:</u> Why don't they say something? Is it because they
 think silence makes them look better, or because to speak would
 be undignified? Or is it because they just don't understand
 anything that's going on at the meeting?<p>

<h3>CHAPTER 8<br>
BUSINESS WRITING THAT COMMUNICATES WARMTH
</h3>

</head>

<body>

<hr>
<h3>Word-Processed<br>
or Handwritten?
</h3>



<img src=../hand.gif align=left>Even a single handwritten stroke on business correspon-<br>
dence makes a difference.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>Send faxes to busy people.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>In word processing, you have a free hand with the layout<br>
and size of the typeface. But the first consideration should<br>
be readability.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>Letters of thanks, get-well wishes, letters to the bereaved<br>
and apologies should be handwritten to show your sincerity.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>Always use letters to express thanks. A written note is<br>
more effective than a telephone call.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>People who are good at writing letters are good with<br>
people. Use letters as a tool to build your human network.<p>

<hr>

<h3>Faxes and Word-Processed Documents<br>
Can Communicate Warmth</h3>

<img src=39-1.gif align=left>
"Our office was completely inundated with water from a
 typhoon," recalls trading company general affairs manager Mr. A.
 "But in the middle of all this mess, the first message we got from
 the outside world came through our fax machine. I was so happy
 I could have cried."<p>

When you're really busy it's often irritating to get phone
 calls. For communicating with busy people, faxes are the right
 answer, and they are all the more sincere when they're handwritten.
 Considering the time and the place is the essential step in
 becoming good at correspondence. Master the use of fax, word
 processing and handwritten notes and choose the appropriate
 means of communication for each occasion.<p>

<h4>Word Processing + a Handwritten Touch</h4>

Always add a handwritten touch to routine word-processed
documents and letters. You can reach the other person's heart by
writing a brief note like "Hope you can help with this," or "With
your cooperation, we won't have anything to worry about."<p>

Even for letters of rejection or complaint, it's advisable to
add a line that shows your consideration for the other person. By
saying that you understand that there must be extenuating
circumstances or that the other person must be extremely busy,
you make the tone of the letter softer and make it easier for him to
understand and accept your point.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>In important places, it's wise to increase the size of characters
 and underline them. Use smaller characters when referring to
 yourself or your company. You'll want to use the various capabilities
 of word processing to the fullest to create documents that are
 easy to read and show the greatest respect to the other person.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>When using a word processor to write a personal message,
 print it out on personal or colored stationery to avoid giving the
 impression of a formal or official document.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>Check word-processed documents carefully for typos and
 misspellings before sending them. Small mistakes can make you
 the butt of jokes and may damage the credibility of your company
 in the eyes of your customers.<p>

<h4>Use Faxes Skillfully for Greater Effectiveness</h4>

Mr. Y, a mid-level manager at a major publishing house in
 Tokyo tells how his office pursues efficiency: "We are now faxing all
 messages and other communications to the people we know are
 busiest. That way, when they get the chance to deal with the
 matter, they'll have all the information right in front of them."
 Instead of continuing to call and leave messages for someone
 who's out of the office, communication is a lot more certain when
 you send a note by facsimile. You also don't run the risk of having
 a receptionist or other third party make a mistake in taking down
 the message.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>
Use clear instructions for the handling of fax transmissions.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>
If you plan to send a very long document that will tie up the
 other person's fax machine for quite a while, get his or her
 permission before you start sending. In such cases, it's sometimes
 more considerate to have the documents delivered by hand.<p>

<h4>Handwriting Expresses Your Sincerity</h4>

In an age when word-processed documents are everywhere,
 handwritten notes have acquired a special cachet of their own.
 Word-processed thank-you notes, get-well wishes and letters of
 regret look too routine and unfeeling. Handwritten notes express
 your sincerity better.<p>

<h4>Rules to Live by</h4>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>
Never forget to show respect for the other person in writing.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>
When writing the other person's name or title, don't ever let it
 run onto the next line. If there isn't enough room on one line to
 write it completely, start on the next line.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>
Be careful not to mix in your own opinion or ideas in official
 correspondence. When you write for the company it is to express
 the company's desires. When in doubt, ask your boss to review
 and approve your correspondence.<p>

<hr>

<h3>Using Letters to Build Your Network:<br>
Become an Active Letter Writer!</h3>

Writing letters is extremely effective in building a network of
 contacts in the business world. Reading a handwritten note, the
 person can see your face and remember your personality in each
 stroke of the pen. And, unlike a phone call, the letter can remain
 in the hands of the receiver.<p>

An additional important point that shouldn't be overlooked
 is that the recipient of the letter will probably read it when he has
 more time in a relaxed atmosphere, conditions that favor a
 deepening of the feeling of closeness. This is why people who are
 active letter writers also have large human networks.<p>


<h4>Using the Unexpected Letter to Your Advantage</h4>

"Everyone sends year-end greeting cards to friends or other
 people who have favored them in the past," explains Mr. K, an
 executive in the office of the president of a large office automation
 equipment manufacturer. "But in that season, I like to send
 printed cards thanking those who have helped me over the past
 months. Of course, I don't forget to send new year's cards as well. "<p>

<h4>Send Picture Post Cards on Trips</h4>

"The best picture post cards," says architect Mr. G, "are
 those that show breathtakingly beautiful scenes." Post cards are
 just the right tool to stay in touch with those in your network with
 whom you may not have spoken recently.<p>

<title>BUSINESS OTSUKIAI / CHAPTER 9</title>

<h3>CHAPTER 9<br>
TRAINING OUTSIDE THE COMPANY</h3>

</head>

<body>

<hr>
<h3>Make Everyone Your Teacher-<br>
You Just Have to Have the Right<br>
Antenna to Catch Their Signals<br>
</h3>


<img src=../hand.gif align=left>
A surprising number of great inventions have been<br>
discovered by people who come up with ideas when they're<br>
not at work. You can learn a lot simply by avoiding the same<br>
old work routine and going to different places to socialize<br>
with different people.<p>

<hr>

<h4>Educating Yourself in Visits to Companies</h4>

<img src=41-1.gif align=left>
"Whenever we do business for the first time with a new
 company," explains Mr. G, a manager at a well-known heavy
 electric manufacturer, "we have them show us not only their
 offices but also their plant sites. This is necessary for both sides to
 get really serious about each other.<p>

"I usually plan to stay overnight on trips to the factory," he
 continues. "And when I go drinking with factory personnel, they
 tell me all about concepts or production management know-how
 that I'd never even dreamt about before." Mr. G's method of using
 simple visits to other companies for his own purposes has proven
 very effective for him.<p>


<h4>Discovery Through Contact with Different<br>
Types of Work</h4>

You link your company to a related one by computer. Two
 companies send people to study outside the company when they
 set up a joint venture. Or you simply organize a study group
 together. No matter what it is, whenever you get the chance to
 learn from other companies, take it. There was once a time when
 people said the three skills a businessman needed to get along
 with people were karaoke, mah-jongg and golf, but that time is
 long gone. The new era calls for study, building a network of
 business and other contacts and constant self-improvement.<p>

<h4>To Succeed, Study Groups Need<br>
Realistic Objectives</h4>

Study groups that are set up to blindly follow trends don't
 last long. To succeed, the group needs one or more of the following
 elements:<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>
Each member has his or her own strength, and learning takes
place through an exchange of information. There are many
examples of such salon-like circles.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>
A group can also have a strong leader or specialist who draws a
circle of people to study around him or her.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>
The group divides responsibilities for studying a topic, surveys
and researches it, then works to improve the understanding of
each of its members.<p>

Study groups take all sorts of forms, but to be fruitful, all of
 the members must have a clear idea of the group's objectives and
 must be dedicated enough to find the time to attend meetings
 faithfully.<p>

You should also give some thought to creating the proper
 atmosphere within the group. Because all participants are business
 warriors, you have to be prepared for those times when
 members will carry on fierce information wars with each other. On
 the other hand, you should keep in mind that without such
 tension the group will lose its vigor and die. In effect, the basic rule
 is that group members can attack each other as aggressively as
 they wish to the extent that it does not interfere with the balance of
 harmony that permits the smooth operation of the group.<p>

<h4>Using Your Studies</h4>

Wherever you turn you can see study groups flourishing. By
 participating actively, you can earn some return no matter how
 small. Inaction in the group, however, means you'll never see a
 return on the money, or time you invested in your studies.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>
Participate even in those groups in which study is most
difficult.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>
Prepare to take notes.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>
Your instructor is an expert in his field. By not asking him
questions, you are permitting a valuable opportunity to slip away.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>
If you don't at least exchange cards with the people sitting next
to you, you have wasted your time.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>
If you take what you have learned in your study group and
assemble your coworkers to report on it to them, you'll find that it
will be a lot clearer in your own mind. By putting it into simple
memo form, it will become even clearer.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>
The temporary satisfaction you get after studying something is
meaningless unless you apply it. You have to take the know-how
you acquire and use it to achieve results in your job. If you don't,
you'll soon forget it.<p>

<h4>Be Willing to Try Anything</h4>

Publishing company manager Mr. K talks about how he
 started using a computer: "In the beginning the idea of using a
 word processor in my job intrigued me, so I started doing drafts on
 floppy disks . Now I realize how much time and energy it has saved .
 And I only started doing it because it seemed like fun."<p>

Today, it's extremely important to anticipate the fundamental
 skills and technologies you'll need for the coming era and
 acquire them without wasting time. It's often the case that you or
 your company alone may not be able to master these valuable
 capabilities. When that's the situation, you'll want to take advantage
 of opportunities to participate and build contacts among
 managers from other fields.<p>

You can also work to deepen the relationship of trust and
 interdependence you have with companies you do business with
 and learn through this avenue as well.<p>

<h4>Manners for Study Groups</h4>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>
It's bad manners to attend a group meeting and just listen.
Don't just sit on the sidelines watching. Always prepare information
 that will be of interest to others at the meeting and be ready to
present it.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>
Don't take up everyone's time by asking questions that benefit
no one else but yourself, or asking for advice with problems that
you alone are dealing with on your job.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>
Don't ask another member who is already very busy to help you
with research or to arrange an introduction for you.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>
Don't introduce office hierarchical relationships into the study
group. All members of the group are to be treated as equals and as
individuals.<p>

<h3>CHAPTER 10<br>
COLLECTING INFORMATION</h3>

</head>

<body>

<hr>
<h3>Give and Take is<br>
the Way to Go
</h3>
<img src=../hand.gif align=left>
The information you have at your command is directly<br>
proportional to the number of your business friends and<br>
acquaintances. Cultivate your network.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>
When there's information someone needs to get from you,<br>
provide it freely.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>
Become friendly with others on the intellectual level.<br>
That's the best way to get information from people.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>
Keep an open mind so you'll always be able to take<br>
advantage of fresh information.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>
Details are what count in "human" information.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>
Never read highly confidential corporate materials on the<br>
train as you commute to and from work.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>
You'll find the keys to understanding a company buried in<br>
its public relations materials and employee communica-<br>
tions publications.<p>

<h3>To Get, You Have to Give Data as Well</h3>

<img src=44-1.gif align=left>
With office automation equipment undergoing one change
 after another, it's sometimes difficult to decide which products to
 buy. Mr. N, a manager at a stone material supplier, tells this story:
 "I was looking at a particular computer model, when the salesman
 told me that if I waited three months there would soon be a brand
 new model with many more functions. This was very valuable
 information for me and I returned the favor by letting him know
 that we were planning to introduce this sort of computer into our
 subsidiary companies as well."<p>

The salesman could have just made the sale, but he decided
 to put himself in the customer's shoes and offered some useful
 information. And for doing so he received some valuable informa-
 tion in return. Information flow requires give and take. Give
 information freely and you'll get a lot more back.<p>

<h4>With a Little Intellectual Curiosity, You Can<br>
Become an Information Source, Too</h4>

A good information exchange begins with the confidence
 you create by giving useful, correct information to the other
 person even though it does not benefit you. You can start by
 keeping an eye out for items that might interest some other person
 as you go through your own daily information collection activities.
 If there's a memo that might be useful to that person, make a copy
 of it and write a little note on it to ask if he is aware of it. Then send
 it to him by facsimile.<p>

If you think that you'll be able to collect new information at
 parties attended by many people in your industry, you are making
 a big mistake. You won't get anything if you just plan to listen to
 what others say. Use intellectual conversation as a tool to arouse
 the curiosity of the other person and start communicating.
 Depending on how interesting the conversation is, you can then
 get an active exchange going.<p>

<h4>React with Sensitivity</h4>

Mr. N. also tells what happens when information that's
 offered goes unused: "More times than I'd like to remember I'll give
 someone very useful information and then not hear anything else
 about it. When that happens, I usually worry that perhaps the
 information was meaningless and of no use. At the same time, I
 make a mental note not to provide the person with information
 again."<p>

When someone gives you new information, no matter how
 trivial it seems, be sure to report it so that your organization can
 take advantage. Information takes on real value when it is used
 properly.<p>

"Someone told me that a key person in one of our client
 companies had been promoted, " explains Mr. N. "When I met him,
 I was able to congratulate him on his new job . Right then and there
 he told me that he'd continue to order from us in his new position.
 That should be enough to demonstrate how reporting in detail can
 pay off for your organization. "<p>

You can also make ample use of seemingly minor matters.
 People who create new concepts and plans are always in search of
 information. They're able to sort through a mass of data and pull
 out exactly what they need. You can become as skilled as they are
 in both uncovering the right information and transmitting it
 accurately to those who need it.<p>

<h3>Business Otsukiai Depends on Good<br>
Information</h3>

<h4>Unleakable Information</h4>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>
In a moment of carelessness, information that's supposed to
stay inside the company is sometimes leaked to outsiders. Always
have what you can and can't speak about clear in your mind. No
matter how much others call for give-and-take, if you talk about
everything going on inside the company, the information you
reveal will lose its value.<p>


<img src=../hand.gif align=left>
Details related to new products are regarded as extremely
 confidential by companies. Talking about the name of a new
 product or other details in a commuter train or other public places
 is strictly forbidden. Worse yet is taking out documents related to
 new products and reviewing them in public places . In many cases,
 information is collected from strange sources and makes its way
 to rival companies.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>
Other types of information you should keep secret are:<p>

<ul> Upcoming personnel changes</ul>

<ul> Technical and other tie-ups</ul>

<ul> Issues before the board of directors</ul>

<ul> Feuding inside the company</ul>

<h4>Keep Confidential Files</h4>

<b>File 1:</b> There are many people who write the date of the
 meeting and other details on business cards they receive, but it's
 even more valuable if you add that person's interests, such as
 fishing, golf, stamps, karaoke singing, etc. Once you've indexed
 these for your files, you can start compiling a list of people and
 telephone numbers to consult on any number of topics.<p>

<b>File 2:</b> After entertaining someone who you're doing business
 with, always jot down a few notes about him that same day.
 Record what songs he sang, the type of liquor he preferred, golf
 handicap, place of birth, schools and universities attended,
 marital status and children and other such data. Getting this type
 of information would normally involve a lot of legwork, but you'll
 be able to collect this-and more-easily and naturally as you
 entertain.<p>

<title>How Much Does It Cost?</title>

<h2><b>
How Much Does It Cost?
</h2></b>
<hr>
<p>
A recent official survey found that 59.8% of Japanese families own
 their homes, while 38.5% live in rentals. In 1993, the number
 of new housing starts exceeded the previous year's by 6%, for a
 total of 1,480,000 units. The increase was spurred by the lowest-ever
 interest rates for publicly-financed housing loans and by a move
 towards cost reductions on the part of construction firms. Another
 survey showed that more than 60% of those interested in buying or
 building houses feel that now is a good time to do so.<br>
 Just how much does the dreamt-of "my home" cost in Japan
 today? The average purchaser of a new home is 38 years old,
 has about US$100,000 saved for a down payment, and expects
 to spend about US$500,000 for a house or condominium, about
 6.5 times his or her annual income. By international standards,
 homes in Japan are expensive. Expenses for furnishings and
 durable goods in the first year after buying a new home
 average US$15,680.

<title>The Disabled-Gradual Progress Towards Equality in Society</title>
<body bgcolor=ffffff>

<img src=smart.gif>
<h2><b>
Living and Working Together-<br>
The Dream Gets Closer to Reality
</h2></b><p>
<hr>
<p>
Japan Abilities Inc. proves disabled people can do useful work as full
 members of society, since more than 30% of its employees have disabilities.
 The company's business is something they have a personal stake in: catering
 to the needs of disabled people. This involves all kinds of endeavors, from
 developing and selling assistive devices to providing care in the home. The
 company is currently conducting a pilot project for the Ministry of Labour
 at its satellite office not far from Tokyo. Office design poses no problems
 for wheelchairs, and workers don't have to ride crowded trains to the head
 office in downtown Tokyo-they are linked with headquarters through a computer
 network that uses the company's own accounting and merchandise-management
 software. The satellite office receives all mail and telephone orders for
 assistive devices, sends them out, and manages product servicing programs.<br>
	The project is still in the experimental stages, but it has already
 shown how disabled people can do their bit right at the forefront of
 the work force, rather than behind the scenes, like before. Some of
 the bigger supermarkets offer similar proof. Store design shows a
 sensitivity to the needs of disabled customers. Some staff members
 are disabled, working directly with customers (this was practically
 taboo in the past). More and more store employees are learning to work
 with disabled colleagues-and some know sign language too.
<p>
<hr>
<img src=disabl3.gif align=left>
At this satellite office of Japan Abilities Inc., all special equipment and furniture arrangements have been designed to meet the requirements of workers in wheelchairs. The employee entering 
the room is Sasaki, seen on the previous page. The company makes influential suggestions to equipment manufacturers, basing its advice on 
the experience of disabled persons. Murozumi Fumio (foreground) is in charge of the advisory process.

It's easy to adjust the height of this desk top over a vertical distance of 28 cm (11 inches), to achieve maximum work performance and comfort. The desk was made in Denmark. (Almost no Japanese manufacturers make 
this kind of office furniture.)

<hr>
<img src=disabl5.gif align=right>
At this Japan Abilities store customers who will use the merchandise can try it out for themselves. The store carries the best of everything for the disabled-for example, special tableware, apparatus 
to move patients, and even this unique system for bathing. 
About 70% of the store's items are imported.

Nobody in this couple's family needs assistive devices, but they haven't come here out of idle curiosity. Their parents are aging-who knows what the future will bring? In addition, they both work in welfare-related fields. (Note how the aisles and display counters have been designed for wheelchair users.)

<h2>Refined Tastes Adapted to the Times</h2>
<hr><p>
With about 3.3 million people, Yokohama is now Japan's second largest
 city. An additional 28 million tourists visit each year. They come for
 the many attractions located near the port: the business quarter's century-old
 western-style buildings; Chinatown's exotic atmosphere and food for gourmets;
 the Yamate district, a different world altogether, with its elegant houses
 built by westerners in the Meiji period and its historic foreign cemetery;
 and parks, ideal for young couples who want a romantic view of the harbor.<br>
Yokohama's young crowd has cultivated its own fashions, somehow different
 from tastes in nearby Tokyo. This is hardly surprising, for the city boasts
 a 100-year-old scarf-making industry. About 90% of Japan's silk scarves
 are made here.<br>
Perhaps the best word to describe Yokohama's atmosphere is "refined."
 This refinement shows its face in different ways: commercial districts
 change, but keep their aura of foreign 
gentility; the city has become an influential center of information by
 sponsoring international conferences. Yokohama's refinement is unique
 in itself. Tall buildings grace the skyline, while 
tremendous bridges built using the latest engineering techniques open
 up new areas along the waterfront. In the midst of this development based
 on the advances of technology, Yokohama people keep up their own fashionable
 way of living.

Patterns are printed on scarves by hand. This workshop is involved in practically every stage of scarf manufacture, from design to printing to finishing.

Pictured above is one of five gates straddling entrances to Yokohama's Chinatown. In this district you can satisfy your culinary curiosity-Chinatown has more than 500 restaurants and stores, 
and many of the stores sell food. Almost 18 million people come 
here each year.

Coming-of-Age Day (15 January) is a rare and welcome opportunity for young women to dress up in long-sleeved kimono. Many 20-year-olds attend municipal ceremonies to commemorate their attainment of adulthood.

The Yokohama Port Opening Memorial Hall was constructed in 1917, to commemorate the port's beginnings as a gateway for international trade. 
The red brick facade has become a Yokohama landmark, and the building has been registered 
as an important cultural property. Concerts 
and lectures are given here.

A similar festival, called Nebuta, flourishes on a larger scale in Aomori, a nearby city. Aomori's Nebuta, together with a festival in Sendai and another in Akita, is famed as one of northeastern Japan's "three great <i>matsuri</i>," and has become a major tourist attraction, drawing some three million visitors each summer. Kuroishi's Neputa is a more modest event, conducted by its citizens for the benefit of the community. Southwest of Kuroishi, the city of Hirosaki holds its own Neputa Festival, distinctive for its fan-shaped floats. The <i>nebuta</i> of the Aomori festival, by contrast, are effigies of historical or legendary persons. In Kuroishi, midway between Aomori and Hirosaki, both types of neputa floats can be seen.<br>What does the word <i>neputa</i> (or <i>nebuta</i>) mean? Where does the festival come from? Everyone seems to have a different answer. What matters to the people of Kuroishi, more than the origins of their festival and its unusual name, is that once each year everyone shares the work of building the <i>neputa</i> floats, joins in the procession, and has a good time.. <p><hr><img src=p4-5.gif>Yamazaki Tsuneo is a master of the art of painting images used in the fan-shaped <i>neputa</i> sculptures for Kuroishi's festival. Most of the images depict legendary heroes from classic Chinese tales such as <i>The Water Margin</i> and <i>The Three Kingdoms</i>. Yamazaki has received numerous awards for his artwork. When the festival approaches he receives so many requests for paintings that he has to turn the running of his noodle shop over to his wife and daughter.<hr><a href=jp01.html><img src=../wback.gif></a><a href=jp03.html><img src=../wnext.gif></a>

Skilled Hands-Making the Fantasy Real

</h2></b>
<hr>

<p>


Professional comic strip writers are always rushing to meet a deadline. The bigger names contribute to a number of weeklies and monthlies, so they share the workload with many assistants. First, rough drawings are laid out, then the characters' lines are written in speech balloons. This takes a lot of time, since it isn't easy to obtain the right balance of imagination and realism. Readers, especially those in their late teens or twenties, have an innate feel for the world being depicted by the comic strip. They are quick to notice something that doesn't ring true, even in the world of imagination. After things look right it is time for artists and assistants to start the actual pen drawings on special paper, everything being done by hand with the deadline never far away.

<br>

Amateur <i>manga</i> artists-there are perhaps as many as 100,000 of them-can set their own deadlines, but they have to finance themselves. Some artists are in their early teens, some in their late 

forties; some are actually professionals who want to create the comic strip of their dreams, free from the constraints imposed by a company. Amateur <i>manga</i> groups have developed a reading audience estimated at about one million throughout the country. Over the last twenty years these groups have held national conventions, which have grown to the point that, at a typical one, about 16,000 groups now exhibit their comics to up to 200,000 fans over a two-day period.

<p>

<hr>

<img src=p21.gif>

To make sure the deadline is kept, Fujimura has assistants fill in the background, do the framing, and finish some of the extra details. Photographs are useful in providing convincing imagery. Fujimura's motto is "Do only the best."

<hr>

<img src=p20.gif align=left>


Fujimura Mari started drawing for a popular comic magazine when she was 15, and for the last 12 years has been a regular contributor to a monthly comic magazine for girls. Here she is working in the middle of the night, so as not to miss a deadline.

Destinations:Hida Takayama-Traditional Manufacturing

</title>
<body bgcolor=ffffff>
<img src=../jpsmart2.gif>
<h2><b>

Traditional Manufacturing Done with 
Loving Care

</h2></b>
<hr>
<p>
Takayama's natural setting gives it access to an excellent supply
 of timber for architectural purposes. For hundreds of years, indeed,
 as long ago as the 7th century, the region has 
produced carpenters skilled in the building of temples. Today these talents
 live on, notably in the furniture industry. More than 40 companies do a
 thriving business (worth about $17,000 million, or US$170 million, annually)
 in tables, chairs and the like.<br>
Cottage industries also abound, many making cakes and candies from
 inexpensive ingredients like flour of different grains, beans and brown
 sugar. These are a big hit with the tourists. Modern equipment is used
 where it makes sense, but no artificial additives are added. This is
 somehow typical of Takayama 
people on the whole-practical and unaffected.<br>
Old houses, traditional industries, city folk with an international spirit-all these factors combine most appealingly. Takayama certainly does not suffer from the fact that it lacks the excitement larger places offer. It has one eye on the past and 
one on the future, making it an ideal tourist city for people who come from all over Japan and many parts of the globe.

<p>

<hr>

<img src=p28-1.gif align=left>

Kashiwa Mokkou Co., Ltd., one of many Takayama furniture 

factories, has perfected the art of bending wood. The company's designs are varied, but mostly based on rural American styles.

<img src=p28-2.gif>

A two-hour car ride northwest from Takayama will bring you to the village of Shirakawa, where more than 180 ancient farmhouses have been preserved. The distinctive roofs, constructed in the gasshozukuri style, have steeply pitched rafters to prevent heavy snow accumulation in winter. UNESCO is considering whether some of the houses are worthy of being designated a World Cultural Heritage Site.

<img src=p29-1.gif align=left>

Mr. and Mrs. Moribayashi own this small bakery, Moribayashi Ryokuryokuen, which was founded in 1872. This is a typical Takayama cottage industry-only six people do all the work, including the selling. The most popular sweet is the kankanbo, the cookies shaped like sticks on the right. Almost 800 bags of these are made each day.

<img src=p29-3.gif align=right>

At about 6:00 each morning two outdoor markets open for business in Takayama. A great place to buy locally produced vegetables, pickles, flowers and 

handicrafts, and to chat with people who are down to earth.

Top Focus: The Appeal of Personalized Service

<h2><b>
The Appeal of Personalized Service - How Seafood Retailers Keep Their Customers


</h2></b><hr>



A survey in October 1992 found that the number of retail establishments in Japan came to 1,212,000, of which small- and medium-sized shops with less than 50 employees made up the overwhelming majority, at 1,197,000. But a comparison with figures from the same survey conducted six years earlier revealed something else: the number of small shops with 19 or fewer employees had fallen by 14.8%, while the number of large retailers with 50 or more employees was up 29.1%.

	<br>Fish has traditionally been preferred to meat in Japan, but in recent decades many Japanese have adopted Western-style diets, eating less fish. Over roughly the same period, beginning in the 1960s, supermarkets have begun drawing consumers away from small fish retailers, whose numbers are declining. The national organization of fish retailers has responded with a strategy for survival, encouraging its members to make the most of their advantages over the supermarket. This strategy includes: (1) talking, or personal communication with customers, (2) providing a wide range of fresh products, and (3) offering tips on storing and preparing seafood. Seafood retailers must provide very fresh goods, but friendly, person-to-person contact with the buyer is also a real factor in appealing to customers.





<p><hr>

Small retail shops line the street of a typical shopping arcade.

A fishmonger cleans and filets fresh fish, then slices it for sashimi as the customer orders. Personalized service like this is one of the attractions of the small retailer.

Perspectives: Animals as Friends to Love and Care For

<h2><b>
Animals as Friends to Love and Care For

</h2></b>
<p><hr><p>


Yet why is there this great need for animal companionship? Why will someone leave a dog alone all day long in a small apartment, for the thrill of being greeted joyfully in the evening? Society's trends are towards solitary living, later marriages, nuclear families, and fewer children. Animals are a welcome addition to the family. To remain physically and emotionally healthy, we human beings need to give and receive love; taking a dog for a walk, petting a cat, or looking after a bird or reptile helps fill this need. Caring for animals is an excellent way for residents in senior citizens' homes to feel more useful and alive. Maybe it even wards off senility.

<br>	Business, of course, has been quick to perceive our need for companionship. In spite of the current recession, the Japanese pet market has grown to immense proportions, at 500 yen billion (US$5 billion) annually. Much of this money goes for pet food. Fresh or dried, meal or snack, the choice is unlimited. There's even diet food for the poor pet who is overweight from overeating.



<p><hr>

A large Tokyo chain, which has nine stores, can treat this dog in an animal hospital boasting everything a veterinarian would need, from X-ray equipment to this CT scanner. Probably the owner herself will never need a scanner, but she feels her dog deserves the best.

Business can meet almost every need a pet owner might have. This is the best room in a high-class hotel for pets whose owners are away. The hotel suggests you bring something that has your scent 

on it, so your pet will feel more at home and know that one day you will return.

Destinations: New Ideas for an Old City

</title>
<body bgcolor=ffffff>

<h2><b>
Otaru, an Old Port City with a New Face

</h2></b>
<hr><p>
<b>New Ideas for an Old City</b><p>

Otaru's winters are cold, and the old buildings impart a touch of Europe. Tsukahara Fusako says this may be why she thought the sound of quaint music boxes would fit in with the city's atmosphere. Six years ago she started selling small music boxes, then opened an exhibition of antique ones from Europe and the U.S. Tsukahara says, "As the gramophone became popular, music boxes went out of style. This was right around the time when marine transport was losing ground to rail and road, which enabled Sapporo to grow at the expense of Otaru. So I think music boxes and Otaru go together."

<br>	Other ways are being tried to attract tourists to Otaru. A number of restaurants and coffee shops have been established in the waterfront buildings that once served as warehouses. The glassworks produce avant-garde ware, and have become excellent places to learn the art. Some citizens installed a steam-driven clock, made by artisans in Canada, in a downtown square. Traditional festivals are of course a big draw, and other festivities, more modern in taste, have been organized to boost tourism. Many of these efforts are because of civic-minded individuals and non-profit groups.

<br>	One hundred years ago this city was a bustling port, a center of commerce. Today it is equally alive - except that today's entrepreneurs, instead of looking to the sea for a livelihood in fishing and shipping, are trying out different ways to make Otaru a tourist mecca. 

<p><hr>



<img src=photo04.gif>
A local industry, the manufacture of glassware, is one of Otaru's drawing cards. Anyone is welcome to visit the atelier of Asahara Chiyoji (seen here on the right).

<hr>
<img src=photo05.gif align=right>



Glass is heated to about 800C (around 1,500F), until it is viscous. When making this vase and bowl the artisans added thin flakes of metal, like gold 

and silver, to the molten glass.


<br clear=all>

<hr>
<img src=photo06.gif align=left>



Otaru is situated between the sea and the mountains. The marine terrace on which it is located quickly rises as one goes inland. This slope is called Funamizaka ("Boat View Hill"), as apt a name as any.

<br clear=all>

<hr>
<img src=photo07.gif align=right>



A trip five kilometers (about three miles) northwest of Otaru to the Otamoi Coast is certainly worth it. 

The coastline, part of a quasi-national park, is Hokkaido at its best.

<hr>
<img src=photo08.gif align=left>



An <i>ennichi</i> festival is held each year in the middle of July near the entrance to Sumiyoshi Shrine. Portable shrines (<i>mikoshi</i>) wend their way through many parts of the city. 

A good way to celebrate summer.

In Otaru there are two separate collections of antique music boxes from Europe and North America. Here you can listen to a sound from another era.

Otaru's sushi is among the best in Japan. This man, Nakamine Shinji, has won quite a few prizes during sushi-judging competitions. With his fresh sense of humor, Nakamine gets on swimmingly with his customers.

Top Focus: A New Image for Horse Racing

<h2><b>

A New Image for Horse Racing





</h2></b>

<hr>



<p>

In Japan today, more than 10 different weekly or monthly magazines are published for horse racing fans. Most of these began publication in 1993. All are growing in circulation, including one weekly magazine started last fall that now sells some 400,000 issues. By contrast with the United States and the United Kingdom, with no more than one or two such magazines each, Japan's racing fans seem to have a predilection for printed media. The contents of these publications are diverse, but three kinds of articles form the mainstay: quasi-scientific forecasts on the outcome of races, stories about winning horses and their pedigrees and interviews with professionals in the racing business.

  <br>Gambling is a lonely sport in most places. The spectators who typically gather at the race track are isolated, remain indifferent to one another, and participate in their sport only from a distance. Today's Japanese racing fans don't fit these stereotypes at all. The stands are crowded with groups of young people, more and more of them women, and families on a day's outing. These fans don't have the look of bettors obsessed by the odds. For them, horse racing is less a matter of gambling than a kind of entertainment. They read the racing magazines to satisfy their curiosity about their favorite horses and jockeys, and come to the track to watch them perform.

Perspectives: If Time Is Money, Why Not Buy Time?

If Time Is Money, Why Not Buy Time?

<hr><p>



Mail-order shoppers get information from catalogs, newspaper and magazine ads, and television or radio promotions. Order what you want by mail or telephone, then just wait for it to be delivered to your door. You never see the seller. For many years, Japanese retailers assumed they couldn't sell without direct contact between the buyer and the product. But that mentality was contradicted in the 1970s, when mail-order businesses affiliated with newspaper and television companies started advertising high-quality goods with a sales pitch hard to resist: "Our prices are lower - and if you're not completely satisfied, just send it back." Consumers quickly realized that this form of shopping was reliable and could save considerable time. It is not surprising that total annual mail-order sales have risen to about 1.8 4yen trillion. (Even so, this is still only about 1.25% of the entire Japanese retail market - mail-order sales in the U.S., where this form of business originated, account for about 17% of all retail sales.)

	<br>Mail-order merchants have their sights set on achieving 5% of the retail market. Their latest strategy, in a society laden with a surfeit of goods, is to market specific lines of goods, and to sell only the best quality, each sales pitch aiming at a certain type of buyer. This is a natural approach for products like jewelry, works of art, specialty foods, fresh delicacies destined for the urban gourmet, custom-made furniture, exclusive imports, or goods catering to health-conscious senior citizens and expectant mothers - but it is also an approach being taken for necessities like clothing and bedding.

Destinations: Traditional Pottery for Today and Tomorrow

Hagi, a Former Castle Town



</h2></b>

<hr><p>



<b>Traditional Pottery for Today and Tomorrow</b><p>

Hagi naturally attracts many visitors - more than one and a half million a year. In addition to the tourist industry, the region's economy depends upon fishing and the cultivation of <i>natsu-mikan</i> (a large variety of orange), as well as the processing of these products. But Hagi is most famous for its pottery. The city's roots in ceramics go back to the seventeenth century, and today there are more than a hundred pottery factories in Hagi. One of the most famous is the Saka Kiln. The present owner, twelfth in the family line, is Saka Koraizaemon. Saka turns his potter's wheel by foot, since, according to him, motorized rotation is too regular, too smooth. His works achieve the effect he desires - a slight, subtle asymmetry that is natural and refined.

	<br>Hagi's present is connected in an unbroken line with its past. The castle town atmosphere remains, and Hagi pottery is still sought after. Modern industrialization never came to Hagi; instead, it has kept a way of life much of Japan is rapidly losing. Perhaps this is why Hagi will always attract tourists, from both Japan and overseas.





<p><hr>

<img src=p28-01.gif align=left>



Saka Koraizaemon is a 12th-generation potter carrying on the earthenware traditions of his family. Yet sometimes Saka paints pictures on his works, moving beyond the customary simplicity of Hagi ware.

Years ago a Japanese type of cow called </i>wagyu</i> was used for many agricultural tasks. Mishima, an island in the Japan Sea about 45km from Hagi, is the only place where one can see descendants of the <i>mishima-ushi</i> breed, the true <i>wagyu</i> species. The <i>mishima-ushi</i> has been designated a protected 

animal by the National Government. About 100 live here at present.

Appointments People Make</h3>

<body>

When inviting a VIP to
give a speech at our bank,
we always write a letter
first. We invite the person
to speak about a certain
subject at a particular
time, and also specify the
desired length of the
speech. We enclose our
corporate brochure,
information about past
speakers we've invited
and other materials. Only
then do we make a
telephone call to him.
If we didn't handle the
contact this way, we
couldn't get a clear
answer on whether the
person would accept our
invitation.<br>
-Bank Manager<p>

Construction companies
arrange to meet their
customers in coffeehouses
near major railroad
stations. Since we often
have to meet customers
for the first time in such
places, we have to do
something so they'll
recognize us. I usually
place a stack of our
corporate literature on
the table, so I always
carry a few brochures
with me.<br>

First Impression</h3>

<body>

 Be as polite as possible.<p>

 As a rule, the person
receiving the guest should
always stay on the right.
Going up the stairs, the
person showing the way is
in front. Going down, the
visitor is in front.<p>

 Getting on the elevator,
the person showing the
way enters first and keeps
the door open for the
visitor. Getting off, the
visitor goes first. When
there is an elevator
operator, the visitor
boards first and gets off
after the person showing
the way.<p>

<h3>CHAPTER 3  TIPS<br>
Ceremonial Visits are for Business, Too</h3>

</head>

<body>


"There are times when
appointments are made
for people to visit your
office and you have no
idea what will be dis-
cussed or why the visitor
has requested the
meeting, " says Mr. S, an
executive in a large
securities house in Tokyo.
"There is such a thing as
a ceremonial visit, and
such visitors have to be
treated with due respect
and courtesy. You never
know whether the meeting
might develop into
important business
someday. "<p>

There are also surprise
visits for which no
appointment has been
made. There can be no
excuse for not showing
your face, or having a
receptionist tell the visitor
you are in a meeting, or
that you've never heard of
them. That's the same as
slamming the door in the
caller's face. People get
angry when you make
them lose face. When
someone visits without an
appointment, by all
means receive him
warmly.<p>

<h3>CHAPTER 4 <br>
Business Card Trivia</h3>

</head>

<body>


<h5><i>Business Cards Overseas</h5></i>

In Europe and America
people don't ordinarily
exchange business cards
on the first meeting. But
recently the value of the
business card is being
recognized and exchanges
of business cards have
become quite routine.<p>

<h5><i>Preventing Business Card Abuse</h5></i>

If you're worried about
giving your business card
to someone whose char
acter you have doubts
about, just say that you're
sorry you've just run out
of cards. Another way to
keep people from misus-
ing your card is to write
the date or scribble a
number on your cards.
If something is written
on a card, it makes it
difficult for anyone to
use it for an illegitimate
purpose.<p>

<h5><i>Convenient Name Cards</h5></i>

In America and elsewhere
people often use name
cards, cards with only the
person s name printed on
them. In the blank space
around the name, a
person can write an
address or telephone
number.<p>


<h5><i>Added Value Business Cards</h5></i>

Some people's business
cards carry a calendar on
the back, a table showing
the calories in popular
foods, mathematical
tables, actuarial and
other tables. Nothing
makes a first conversa
tion easier than giving
someone a business card
with interesting informa
tion related to your work
printed on the back.<p>

<h3>CHAPTER 4 TIPS<br>
Cards Have Multiple Uses</h3>

</head>

<body>


 "When someone calls
and asks me to send them
materials, I always
enclose a card. Since I
worry that the card will
get bent if I clip it to the
materials, I usually put it
in a small envelope with a
brief note written on a
buck slip. "

 "When I'm sending
materials to someone, I
usually find a blank spot
on the cover letter page
and affix my card to it.
You can make a little ring
out of a piece of tape,
keeping the sticky side
out, and attach it to the
back of the card. "

 "When I visit someone
and they're out I usually
write a message on my
card and have someone
leave it on their desk.
After collecting about five
of these, the person will 
usually meet with you if
only because he feels
sorry for you. "

<h3>CHAPTER 5 Colum<br>
SOME TELEPHONE SITUATIONS
</h3>

</head>

<body>

<h5><i>Always Have 10 Yen Coins<br>
in Your Pocket</h5></i>

You race to make a call from a bank of
public phones on the platform where you're
changing trains. As soon as you reach
them, though, you find all the card phones
are in use. You search in your pockets for
some change to use in the coin phones but
can't find any. You race to the end of the
platform, buy a magazine to get change and
run back to make the call . By then you know
you're already late for your next appoint-
ment.<P>

Always make sure you have telephone
cards and ten yen coins with you whenever
you're out on business.<P>

<h5><i>The Receptionist Turned Out to<br>
Be the President</h5></i>

A woman's voice comes on the line
just as you are thinking that no one will ever
answer your call. "Sorry to have kept you
waiting," she says as you grow angrier, "but
we were on our lunch hour." You realize
then why it has taken so long, but keep up
the conversation with the same angry feel-
ing you had about being kept waiting. Later
you break out in a cold sweat when you
learn that she's the president of the com-
pany.<P>

Don't call companies during lunch
hour. And remember: anyone, including the
president and top executives, can pick up a
phone that's ringing. Always be polite on the
phone.<P>

<h3>CHAPTER 5 TIPS<br>
Be Especially Polite When Someone is Out
</h3>

</head>

<body>

 When someone from
your office is out and
can't answer a call, it
means that the caller's
time is wasted and, to a
certain extent, there is a
halt in the flow of work at
the caller's company. Be
sure to be properly
apologetic.<p>

 When someone calls
back and the called party
is still at an outside
meeting, be apologetic
and explain that the
meeting is taking longer
than expected. Phrase
your explanation in such
a way that the caller feels
your colleague has not
returned because of
circumstance over which
he has no control.<p>

"While You Were Out" Memos
</h3>

</head>

<body>

 If you write in the time,
 date and subject on the
 memorandum, it makes it
 easier for the person to
 respond to the call.

 Keep the recorded
 greeting on your telephone answering machine
 short and to the point.
 The caller is already
 disappointed that you're
 not on the phone and
 doesn't want to listen to
 some long-winded
 explanation.

<h3>CHAPTER 6 <br>
The Three Evils of Speech
</h3>

</head>

<body>

<u>Tediousness<br></u>
Repeating the same thing
over and over. Going
around the issue without
ever coming to the point.
Bragging about personal
things. Running over the
allotted time.<p>

<u>Pushiness<br></u>
Speaking one-sidedly
without allowing the
other person to put in a
word or two or ask
questions. "Look, you
can't afford to pass up
this work, right?" This
attitude invites a harsh
reaction.<p>

<u>Sarcasm and Offensiveness<br></u>
When someone says
things like "I'm close to
your managing director,"
it invites trouble. Some-
times polite speech can be
so overdone as to be
sarcastic and offensive.<p>

<hr>
<h3>CHAPTER 7 <br>
Ten Ironclad Rules for Meetings</h3>

</head>

<body>

1. Begin and end on time.<p>

2. Holding a meeting for
 no compelling reason is
 an evasion of your
 responsibility as a
 manager. Call a meeting
 only after carefully
 considering whether it's
 necessary or not.<p>

3. Don't sit in for someone
 else at a meeting and
 don't send anyone to sit in
 for you. Let people know
 about upcoming meetings
 and distribute materials
 to them well ahead of the
 appointed time.<p>

4. Summarize materials.
 It's best if you can get
 all the main points on a
 single piece of paper.<p>

5. Keep down the number
 of those who need to
 attend the meeting, and
 don't invite certain people
 out of a sense of loyalty. A
 good rule to keep in mind
 is that the limit for a
 discussion is 12 people.<p>

6. A meeting that ends
 without a conclusion is
 nothing but a glorified tea
 party. Cover every item on
 the agenda fully.<p>

7. A meeting that lasts an
 hour is best. One that runs
 two hours is acceptable.
 One that lasts three hours
 or more is counterproductive.<p>

8. Don't monopolize the
 discussion. If each person
 limits his or her remarks
 to within three minutes,
 everyone can be heard.<p>

9. Announce the points
 which have been decided
 and put them into action
 quickly.<p>

10. Always consider
 whether the meeting has
 been cost effective.<p>

To Get Information on Related Companies
</h3>

</head>

<body>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>
Everyday, go through all major newspapers
 that cover business, trade newspapers
 and magazines. If you find an item of
 interest, like a shift in top executives of a related
 company, clip it and put it in your files.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>
Obtain copies of the company's employee
 and external communications publications.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>
Become close to the secretaries of the top
 executives. They'll answer all your questions
 and let you know about upcoming
 changes of top executives.<p>

<img src=../hand.gif align=left>
Whenever there is a reshuffling of management,
 documents detailing the changes
 are sent to the appropriate departments.
 Collect and digest these documents and
 you'll be able to draw up a complete map of
 the personnel in the company.<p>

<title>Home Ownership Values</title>
<body bgcolor=ffffff>

<img src=smart.gif>

<h2><b>
Home Ownership Values
</h2></b>
<hr>
<p>
The sharp drop in land prices after the burst of Japan's "bubble economy"
 in the early 90s was said to accompany a trend among young people
 away from regarding real estate as an investment, and a preference
 for rentals. But a recent survey of six major urban areas found
 that 41% of those now renting houses wish to own one in the suburbs,
 while another 28% hope to buy a house in the city. The desire to
 become a homeowner remains strong.<br>
	The household or family has been regarded as the key unit of
 social identity in Japan since at least the Edo period (1603-1867).
 Pre-modern daimyo (feudal lords) exercised territorial control
 through hereditary family bonds; commercial enterprises, traditional
 performing arts, martial arts and schools of learning were all
 organized along family lines. Even today, the conduct of important
 social ceremonies, weddings and funerals reveals the weighty role
 the family retains in Japanese society. But the notion that the
 family home is a kind of asset, that owning a house might be one
 of life's larger goals, is a surprisingly recent phenomenon-fully
 93% of workers residing in the Tokyo area in 1922 rented their
 dwellings, according to a study done at the time. Government
 policies for dealing with the 
postwar housing shortage favored private-sector supply over public
 housing development. Rising 
land prices in the ensuing period of rapid economic growth fostered
 interest in real estate as an investment, and family home ownership
 emerged as a new social value.
<p>
<hr>

<img src=myhome04.gif>
Before laying the foundations for a new house, a ground-breaking ceremony,
 the jichinsai, is performed by a Shinto priest, the owners, and members
 of the construction firm. The ceremony is a traditional rite meant to
 appease the deities of the land and to pray for successful completion
 of the new house.
<hr>
<img src=myhome05.gif align=right>
Many new private homes are built to replace houses aged beyond repair.
 Tearing down an old house takes only a day, but disposing of the
 waste material can be a problem. Rebuilding an average single-family
 house with an area of 100 square meters (about 1075 square feet) of
 floor space generates waste equivalent in volume to the household
 garbage produced by a typical family of four over a period of 34 years.

<h2><b>
Accepting Differences
</h2></b><p>
<hr>
<p>
Mainstreaming depends on modifications in corporate buildings and legal support, but most important is that the majority realize it is perfectly normal to live and work side by side with people who face considerable physical challenges. In 1991 Japan had about 2,722,000 disabled people aged 18 and older. Of these, 62.7% were at least 60 years old; this points to an increasing likelihood for old age to bring with it some form of disability. All of us, 
whatever our age, are moving closer to the day when we may have to cope with our own incapacity. So it is in our own interest to look upon a disability as a personal trait, as one part of the human condition. This will happen when we accept different 
ways of thinking and different abilities, and when the road is opened up for the disabled to make maximum use of their own potential.

Otsuka Haruyasu refuses to let muscular dystrophy get in the way of his art. By controlling the air pressure in the tubes, he can send electronic signals which move the easel up and down, left and right. 
His small strokes with a piece of charcoal do the rest. Once a week he drives his electric wheelchair to 
a kindergarten located two hours from his home, 
to teach drawing; the days he teaches are 
some of his most enjoyable, he says.

One of the ideals sought after in "mainstreaming" is disabled children playing with kids their own age who do not have the same physical challenges. At Showa Kinen Park, operated by the National Government in the city of Tachikawa, Tokyo, disabled youngsters too can climb on monkey bars, roll down grassy mounds, and use their imagination with other playground equipment.

Otsuka can move his hands only a little, so this small keyboard set up in his atelier is ideal for his word processing.

Dr. Tanaka says a device might theoretically be very convenient, but it's up to the users to show just how helpful it can be.

<html><title>Top Focus:Mobilizing the Whole Community</title><body bgcolor=ffffff><img src=../jpsmart2.gif><h2><b>Mobilizing the Whole Community</h2></b><hr><p>Each year, as July comes around, small workshops in Kuroishi are set aside in each neighborhood to begin construction of the <i>neputa</i>. The effigies of legendary heroes are fashioned around a wire frame. After tiny light bulbs are strung along the frame, squares of paper are cut and pasted to the surface and painted. The process takes teamwork, concentration, energy, and artistic sense. Once the huge <i>neputa</i> dolls are finished, they are mounted on elaborate floats prepared by separate teams. Construction of the fan-shaped <i>neputa</i> begins with large paintings also attached to wire frames, prepared by specialists in this traditional art. During the day, the women and children share in the task of preparing their neighborhood's <i>neputa</i>. After 7:00 p.m., men returning from their jobs gather to continue the work. The pace slows down as laughter and <i>sake</i> are shared; the schedule has been designed to allow for evening relaxation. <br>When each <i>neputa</i> is completed, the lights are turned on to see how the work has turned out. Everyone falls silent as, illuminated from within, the colorful images come to life. The <i>neputa</i> are truly collective creations, imbued with the labor and passion of the whole community. For the people of Kuroishi, building the <i>neputa</i> is indeed the high point of the year.<p><hr><img src=p7.gif align=left>The pigments used for painting <i>neputa</i> images are safe enough to eat. Wax is applied to the unpainted areas to let the light shine through from within. The wax is used to emphasize the contours of the figures. Kitayama describes the tension of the moment when the eyes are painted onto the faces: "It's like blowing life into them."<br clear=all><hr><img src=p6.gif align=right>At the beginning of July, the smell of paste fills the workshops. Later in the month, the smells of pigment and wax predominate. In the last several days before the festival, the work goes on till late in the night. Kitayama Moriharu, in charge of designing and building the dolls, ordinarily runs a bicycle shop, but has to close his shop at noon to allow time for work on the <i>neputa</i> dolls.<br clear=all><hr><a href=jp02.html><img src=../wback.gif></a><a href=jp04.html><img src=../wnext.gif></a>

Comics in Serious Writing



</h2></b>
<hr>

<p>
Why this craze for comics? Given the stress factor-the need for an escape from the reality of hard work schedules or exam hell, why do Japanese people turn specifically to comics? (1) When writing Japanese, one combines Chinese characters with Japanese 

letters, so adding pictures to the written word is a logical step. (2) The generally high quality of <i>manga</i> today is attracting more readers. (3) In life's rat race, information is important, but no-one has much time to obtain it. Studies show that you can absorb twice as much information from a <i>manga</i> book as you can from an ordinary one in the same period 

of time.

<br>

Of course comics continue to evolve. The latest trend is to use comic strips in handbooks and manuals, which somehow are able to compress a lot of complex information into a small space. This innovation took hold in 1987, after the publication of what became an extremely popular <i>manga</i> introduction to the Japanese economy. The new genre is now also used in primers on culture, sports, business and many other fields. This has prompted government offices to use comic strips for their public relations material and white papers targeted at young readers. Company manuals and information brochures sometimes take the same approach. <i>Manga</i> are an effective tool, with the potential to keep evolving as a means of sharing information.

<p>

Characters of the comic book written by Tsubota Aika (see caption on the opposite page) gained a wider audience in 1994 when they appeared in the <i>Environment White Paper in Manga Form</i>, published by the Printing Bureau of the Ministry of Finance under the supervision of the Environment Agency. The Bureau and Agency are considering putting out an English version; here their representatives talk with staff from a company that is involved in the planning of the design and production.

Beer Helps Small Retailers <br>
Compete in Prices
</h2></b>
<hr>
<p>

Traditionally, the Japanese liquor shop was also the place to buy basic foodstuffs such as soybean paste (<i>miso</i>), soy sauce and cooking oil. Today, most consumers go to the supermarket for these products, and with the easing of regulations on retail distributors, more and more supermarkets are selling beer and spirits. Liquor retailers are feeling the competition. Small retailers cannot ordinarily make a profit at the discount prices that supermarket chains offer, so in some cases they have been banding together, forming groups to place large-lot orders and using their collective buying power to provide lower prices to the consumer.

	<br>Another strategy adopted by small retailers is to stock locally-produced or specialty products not carried by discount markets. Customers are willing to go out of their way to shop at stores that offer the unusual. The attraction of low prices on nationally-known brands is undeniable, and supermarkets which sell everything under one roof are convenient. But many Japanese consumers are prepared to pay a little more for the satisfaction of getting exactly what they want.

<h2><b>
Not All Owners as Mature as their Pets

</h2></b>
<p><hr><p>
Affluence extends beyond pet food to shampoos, fur rinses, manicures, breath fresheners, shawls and booties to keep out the rain, even traditional clothes so Taro the dog can worship in style at a shrine on New Year's Day. When taken to these extremes, our natural fondness for animals is distorted into a domineering attempt to mold them in our own image.

<br>	A more serious problem, though, is loss of interest. Anyone can fall in love with a Siberian husky when he is just a few weeks old. But when he grows into a demanding, overgrown canine, he could end up in the pound, his fate a foregone conclusion. This heartbreaking situation has led animal lovers to form groups to teach the basics of pet care. How and when do you scold, how can you show heartfelt approval, and how should training take into account the animal's character? These are three important subjects prospective owners need to learn.

<br>	In today's Japan, fewer couples are having children, and society is aging. The need for animals as friends we can enjoy life with will surely increase. Hopefully, so will our knowledge of how to interact with them.

Fans and Sponsors: Working on Winning



</h2></b><hr><p>



The cultural anthropologist Roger Caillois, in a book on play and human society, has suggested that games of chance are an essentially human activity. The notion of trying to outwit the abstract and 

impersonal forces of chance gives rise to a distinctive form of play. One thing which seems certain is that people who gamble believe they have a chance of winning, or can somehow improve their chances against odds which say they are bound to lose. It is this belief that keeps the betting papers, the professional tipsters and the experts who sell advice on winning in business. There is a constant demand, and a market, for a winning formula.

<h2><b>

Valuable Lists of Valued Customers

</h2></b>

<hr><p>



Whether a company advertises by bulk mail or electronic media, it is always subject to one simple rule: a mail-order business cannot survive unless the response rate is high. Generally, the minimum response rate is about 12%. Lists of customers known to be ready to spend are counted upon to boost this ratio. They are sent catalogs of their preferred type of merchandise, or are invited to special exhibits of mail-order merchandise, to buy what they want on the spot. One might think this face-to-face approach is contrary to the mail-order spirit, but specialized lists can be used in all kinds of ways to keep the attention of desirable customers.

	<br>In Japan, women make most of the purchasing decisions. Yet the workplace is giving more and more women the chance to use their talents, so time is now limited for many. Leisurely shopping is becoming a thing of the past. Purchasing by mail or telephone may be the perfect way to buy quality at a reasonable price.

<title>"A People Who Live in Houses of Wood and Paper"</title>
<body bgcolor=ffffff>

<img src=smart.gif>
<h2><b>
"A People Who Live in Houses of Wood and Paper"
</h2></b>
<hr>
<p>
This is how E.S. Morse, an American scientist who visited Japan in the
 late 19th century, characterized the Japanese, referring to the building
 materials used for a typical house. The framework was constructed of
 wooden pillars and beams. Exterior walls were of wooden board, and
 internal walls consisted primarily of partitions made of paper framed
 in wood. Hot summers and high humidity the year round have made wood,
 which absorbs and expels humidity, the building material of choice in
 Japan since antiquity. Today, land shortages and the high cost of wood
 result in most apartment buildings being constructed of reinforced concrete,
 though a majority (72%) of Japanese, even those of the younger generation,
 still express a preference for wood-frame houses over apartment buildings.<br>
	But with the introduction of Western style two-by-four construction
 methods, often adapted to local climatic conditions and the tastes of
 Japanese consumers, wood-frame houses are making a comeback. Variations
 range from "direct imports"-houses built in purely European or American
 styles-to those subtly modified to include Japanese-inspired interiors or
 rooms furnished in traditional fashion. Apart from large-scale
 development projects, housing design is not often regulated,
 and neighborhoods are typically free of any unity of appearance.
 Height restrictions are enforced, however, to protect residents'
 rights to sunlight. Three-story houses that make the most of limited
 building lots call for ingenious architectural solutions, and often
 appear, at first glance, to be no more than two stories tall. Another
 recent trend is towards prefabrication to cut construction costs.
<p>
<img src=myhome06.gif>
This house is being constructed in the traditional style for wood-frame buildings. In the past, carpenters had to be skilled in techniques such as planing and cutting mortise joints. Today, however, even traditional-style houses are built from pre-cut timber to reduce construction time.
<hr>
<img src=myhome07.gif align=left>
Once the roof beams for a new house are in place, ritual paper pendants are placed on the beams and a roof-raising ceremony is conducted to pray for the safe completion of construction work and for the safety of the future occupants. Traditionally, this is an elaborate ceremony featuring a dinner shared by the owners and all those involved. Today, the ceremony is often simplified, as in the case shown here.
<br clear=all>
<hr>
<img src=myhome08.gif align=right>
In many cases, all the timber to be used in building a new house is cut to size and finished at a mill before delivery to the construction site.

Those in charge of the large drums and flutes for the musical accompaniment begin practicing as early as spring, and must receive approval before they are allowed to play. Each day in July, children returning from school gather around the workshops to look in on the <i>neputa</i> floats under construction or to practice their roles. Their elders recall the excitement with which, as youngsters, they once looked forward to the annual festival, and are likely to tell the children, "All this work is, after all, just for your sake." The children know they can expect to receive sweets and plenty of good food when the festival begins.<br>Adults surround the floats and chant in unison with the shouts of the children and the music. The Nebuta Festival of Aomori is famed for the feverish excitement of its dancers leading the procession, singing and shouting amidst the uproar of onlookers. Kuroishi's Neputa procession is more solemn, yet no less impressive. As soon as the festival concludes, the carefully wrought paper sculptures will be smashed. The <i>neputa,</i> symbols of the community's self-affirmation, are destroyed at the hands of the children who so eagerly watched the creation of these spectacular but delicate sculptures. One man who had come to help in the construction of this year's <i>neputa</i> commented: "The festival is a huge waste, but a necessary one."<p><hr><img src=p8.gif align=left>The frames of the fan-shaped <i>neputa</i> are made of wood, and must be built solidly enough to support 3 or 4 adults riding within them on the floats. The frames are hinged so the sculptures can be folded to pass through narrow streets. A hydraulic mechanism is used to adjust the height, to avoid hitting overhead wires, and the base is designed to rotate the sculpture to show off all of its "faces" to the judges.<br clear=all><hr><img src=p9.gif align=left>Elementary school students gather after class each day to practice the refrains, which are based on three distinct rhythms.

<h2><b>
Maximizing Consumer<br>Convenience - The Challenge<br>of Supermarkets

</h2></b>
<p><hr><p>

Many observers feel that Japan's retail distribution industry is biased in favor of protecting marginal small retailers, at unfair cost to the consumer. Economists in Japan and overseas have pointed out that (1) the number of small retailers is too large to achieve efficient distribution, (2) distribution channels are too complicated, and rely on antiquated business practices, and (3) too many middlemen stand between producer and consumer, needlessly raising prices. One solution to all of these problems is the large suburban chain supermarket. These supermarkets appeal strongly to car-owning families who want to do all their shopping in one place at low prices. Chain supermarkets cut overhead expenses by purchasing large lots, and trim personnel costs by hiring part-time employees. These are effective strategies for lowering prices paid by the end user. But such stores risk alienating consumers by their lack of a personal touch. A surprising number of Japanese shoppers express dissatisfaction with supermarkets. Inventories are plentiful and prices are low. But shoppers cannot always find just what they are looking for. In response, supermarkets have developed lines of private brand-quality goods at modest prices, while fine-tuning their marketing strategies to meet regional and seasonal demand for attractive products.

<p>

<img src=photo05.gif>
This outlet of a large discount supermarket chain started business in 1975. Such stores appeal not only to shoppers in the neighborhood but to those who shop by car. This store sells groceries and a wide range of consumer goods, but has not displaced local retailers.



<hr>
<img src=photo06.gif align=left>

This supermarket occupies a seven-story building with about 15,000 square meter of floor space devoted to retailing. On the average, 8,000 customers shop here on weekdays and 40,000 on Sundays. Recent relaxations of official regulations allow such stores to stay open longer. This store is open until 9:00 pm during the summer to meet the needs of working families.

The National Lottery - Get Rich Quick?



</h2></b><hr><p>



The National Lottery, operated under the supervision of the Ministry of Home Affairs, is one of the most popular gambling games in Japan. Tickets are sold through some 10,000 outlets around the nation. The biggest payoffs are those of the triannual "jumbo" lotteries, with first prizes of 120yen million (a little more than US$1 million). Still, the odds for winning even a 1 yen million prize in the "Dream Jumbo" are no better than about 1 in 54,000. That hasn't prevented self-appointed experts from writing books on how to win. Long lines of buyers form at sales outlets where winning tickets have turned up in past lotteries. Today, a majority of lottery tickets are bought by those at least 40 years old. Hoping to attract a younger clientele, the sponsors of the National Lottery are planning to offer a "numbers game" allowing players to choose their own numbers for lottery tickets beginning in the fall of 1994. Such games, which offer a higher chance of winning, are popular in the United States, Canada, Malaysia, Singapore and France.

The Trials of Designing a House

When a family prepares to build a home, its members may spend days or weeks worrying over design plans, working out compromises for a house that comes as close as it can to meeting their ideals. Few are happy to live in the cramped dwellings 
a United Nations report once likened to "rabbit hutches." Fathers hope to provide their children with rooms of their own. Mothers make the most demands, industry sources report, with exacting specifications for convenience in the kitchen. The same sources note that bathrooms tend to reflect the preferences of the head of the household. One mother interviewed for this article, proud occupant of a new "my home," could barely conceal her delight even though she declared that, while her family was "basically satisfied," only half of their original expectations had been fulfilled.
	One new trend in home design is the two-household residence, built to accommodate a married couple and one set of in-laws. These dwellings are popular in urban areas where land is simply too expensive for young prospective homeowners. By expanding or rebuilding a house to accommodate two or three generations, a young married couple can avoid the cost of property, while the parents can be assured their children will be around to look after them in their old age. A wide range of designs for such homes has been devised to optimize use of space while accommodating differing lifestyles and needs for privacy.

One reason why housing costs in Japan are relatively expensive is that all construction work is expected to meet exacting standards. When the owners of 
a new house inspect the final results, everyone involved in sales, construction, design, and interior finishing gathers to answer questions and make sure the owners are satisfied.

When the interior, wiring, plumbing and gas lines have been completed, the next step is landscaping and finishing the exterior.

<html><title>Top Focus:Festival Economy-Matsuri as Value</title><body bgcolor=ffffff><img src=../jpsmart2.gif><h2><b>Festival Economy-Matsuri as Value</h2></b><hr><p>In ancient times, Japan's <i>matsuri,</i> or festivals, were annual events staged for the purpose of communion with the gods and spirits of the dead. Those who conducted the <i>matsuri</i> purified themselves to receive the gods, and offered prayers for rich harvests, for protection against illness and bad weather, and for the general welfare of the community. All members of the community shared in the task of entertaining the gods, everyone helping to carry the portable shrine typically used to receive the descending deities. Through the ages, however, the character of these events gradually changed to encompass fewer sacred elements. More and more, the festival became an occasion for affirmation of local identity and solidarity, as the emphasis on social communion displaced the traditional religious focus, especially in increasingly urban communities.<br>The fact that each <i>matsuri</i> is held only once a year makes it a special occasion, an opportunity to forget mundane cares and daily chores, an excuse for estranged neighbors to set aside their differences and join in the work and rewards of communal festivities. The sheer extravagance of so much non-productive expenditure, the "huge waste" of the festival, serves to release social tensions and restore the often precarious balance of community life. At the same time, many local <i>matsuri</i> have in recent years acquired significant commercial value as spectacles with strong appeal to tourists. One way or the other, <i>matsuri</i> have remained a powerful force in the social economy of Japan's communities.<p><hr><img src=p10.gif>The three day festival known as "Nagasaki Kunchi," held in Nagasaki each October, includes Shinto rites and traditional dances, and typically draws over 300,000 spectators. The spectacular "dragon dance" (<i>jaodori</i>) reflects its Chinese origins, adding an exotic flavor to the festival.<hr><img src=p11_1.gif align=left>The Mifune Matsuri (Boat Festival) of the Kumano Hayatama Shrine in Shingu City, Wakayama prefecture, held in October, is a highly sacramental <i>matsuri</i> thought to date from antiquity. The <i>mikoshi</i> is transported by boat to a sacred site where purificatory rites are performed. The awesome solemnity of this festival recalls ascetic Shinto traditions.<br clear=all><p><img src=p11_2.gif><hr><img src=p11_3.gif align=right>On the first day of the Nagasaki Kunchi, three <i>mikoshi</i> (portable shrines) are carried by men running down the 73-step stairway from the main shrine. On the third day, the <i>mikoshi</i> will be carried up the steps. The purpose of carrying the portable shrine through the streets is to permeate the community with the power of the local deities. This practice is common to a great many Japanese <i>matsuri</i>.<br clear=all><hr><a href=jp04.html><img src=../wback.gif></a><a href=jp06.html><img src=../wnext.gif></a>

<h2><b>
The Local Mini-Mall - Cashless Shopping from Local Retailers

</h2></b>


<p><hr><p>



Small retailers' associations in local shopping arcades have been trying new tactics for offering some of the benefits consumers seek from discount and large-scale retail stores. One new approach is issuing credit cards usable in a specific shopping district. Computer-based cards make shopping simpler and more convenient, while helping retailers keep track of customer accounts. Traditionally, many retailers' associations have issued shopping stamps to encourage consumers to buy locally. Such stamps can be used for discounts on the cost of purchases, but only after they've been saved up and pasted into booklets. This makes them unpopular with young or busy shoppers. Credit cards automate the process of keeping track of purchases and earning discounts. A fraction of these savings is pooled to cover costs and help improve public facilities or sponsor seasonal events. Other local shopping districts now issue prepaid shopping cards.



<p><hr>


<img src=photo08.gif align=left>
This shopping arcade, incorporated in 1947, includes 230 shops divided into five blocks. 

The leaders of each block association get together to discuss plans for summer festivals and other events designed to attract customers.

<br clear=all>

<hr><p>


<img src=photo09.gif align=right>

The retailers' association for this shopping arcade issues two types of cards: credit cards, and cards allowing rebates against accumulated purchases. More than 36,000 cards have been issued, most of them to female customers.

<br clear=all><hr>

<img src=photo10.gif align=left>



The same shopping arcade is strategically located to draw both local and regional customers of all age groups. Parking space helps attract shoppers from a wide area.

Top Focus: The Future of High-tech Pachinko

<h2><b>



The Future of High-tech Pachinko



</h2></b><hr><p>



Pachinko is a mechanized game of chance uniquely popular in Japan. Official reports show that pachinko fans number 29 million, for an annual market of about 17 yen trillion. Some 28% of Japanese adults, fully 40% of adult males, spend some of their leisure time on this game. Pachinko has its origins in a children's pinball game called "gachanko," which was modified into something like its present form in 1946. The game has no time limits, playing it requires no special skills and winnings can be converted into prizes such as cigarettes, chocolates, or other luxury items. In the postwar period, pachinko became something of a national pastime for Japan's urban population. From around the 1980s, however, more complex versions of the game, based on new mechanical and computer technology, became popular. These high-tech games call for more sophisticated skills, since the player's odds can be improved by learning the probabilities and honing response time. Many pachinko parlors today offer special corners for women and senior citizens, but as equipment has become more advanced, the cost of playing has grown, so pachinko no longer offers the low-budget entertainment it was once known for.

<img src=p10-01.gif align=left>

Pachinko is a kind of vertical pinball game. The board is 

covered with a pattern of pins, obstacles and holes. The object is to get the ball past the obstacles and into the holes. When a ball enters a hole, more balls are returned to the player, who can cash the balls in for prizes.

Pachinko magazines are popular with readers in their late teens and up (18 is the legal age for playing the game). Magazines carry stories on how to beat the odds with the latest pachinko games.

<title>People Change with Age</title>
<body bgcolor=ffffff>

<img src=smart.gif>
<h1><b>
People Change with Age -<br> Can Their Houses Change, Too?
</h1></b>

<hr>
When children grow up and leave home, their parents stay behind. Space that
 once served as children's bedrooms becomes empty. Suppose one of the children
 marries and wishes to return with his or her family. A home which had been
 designed in advance to be rebuilt or extended to house two generations
 would be the ideal. If the head of the household works full time,
 a den may be unnecessary. After retirement, though, a study or den
 for the pursuit of hobbies may become desirable. Construction firms
 are now vying to anticipate such needs by designing houses that not
 only meet present demands but offer flexibility for change.<br>
	Is home ownership really an asset important enough to serve as
 a universal goal in life? Surely the true value of a home is as a place
 where children can be raised and learn what a family is, and where parents
 can learn from their children. As each member of a family matures,
 relationships change. The living space they share should be able to
 accommodate growth and change. Solutions must be found to the
 excessive cost of land and housing in Japan if the dream of
 "my home" is to become available to all, though in the meantime,
 the underlying values of the house and home will continue 
to evolve.
<hr>
<img src=myhome11.gif>
Now that their house is ready to be occupied, this family starts moving in. Nearly eight months have passed since the mother and daughter made their first visit to a household appliance fair to begin designing their ideal home. Despite many compromises and some scaling down of expectations, the whole family shares the joy of having their own "my home."
<hr>
<img src=myhome12.gif align=left>
The house was designed for flexibility and the potential to accommodate three generations. For now, the parents have a room on the first floor, and their grown children occupy rooms on the third floor, with shared living, cooking and dining areas on the second floor. The first floor has its own kitchen, and the design allows for addition of an external staircase and separate entryway on the second floor, so the building can readily be converted in the future to house two families.

<html><title>Top Focus:Matsuri and the Future</title><body bgcolor=ffffff><img src=../jpsmart2.gif><h2><b><i>Matsuri</i> and the Future</h2></b><hr><p>For the citizens of Kuroishi, the Neputa Festival has not become a major tourist attraction, and they take pride and satisfaction in keeping things that way. There are signs of change: some of Kuroishi's neighborhood associations have begun employing part-time workers to help construct their <i>neputa</i> figures. For the most part, though, the <i>matsuri</i> remains a labor of love, a communal task with adults doing most of the work so children can have most of the fun. It is true that the Kuroishi city government has plans for publicizing the Neputa Festival to attract more tourists and help vitalize the local economy. Kuroishi is not trying to develop the event into something like Aomori's Nebuta Festival, which is heavily subsidized by commercial interests; but the city is seeking more support from local industry. In the past, Kuroishi's Neputa coincided with Aomori's Nebuta. A few years ago the date was deliberately advanced a few days to allow visitors to the region a chance to take in both festivals.<br>Historically, <i>matsuri</i> have changed in character: from religious rites they gradually became largely secular, but still local, communal events. Now, in many cases, they are acquiring new status as entertaining spectacles with great power to attract tourists. The temptations of commercialization are bound to come into conflict with traditional values of communal re-affirmation. The dilemma seems clear: can communities maintain the traditional stress-releasing effect, sacred or secular, of their <i>matsuri,</i> while accommodating new pressures from without? The power of the <i>matsuri,</i> always an act of renewal within life's continuity, faces a difficult test.<p><hr><img src=p12-13.gif>After the festival in Kuroishi, the <i>neputa</i> dolls are destroyed. The fan-shaped <i>neputa</i> images are removed from their huge wooden frames, which are used again. The images themselves are usually destroyed, except in regions where cloth rather than paper is used. By the time the Neputa Matsuri ends, the air in northern Honshu is already cool. Summer is over, and the residents of the area return to life-as-usual for another year.<hr><img src=p12.gif align=left>Traditional festivals call for the closely-coordinated participation of the whole community, and foster a sense of local solidarity. Some observers question whether future generations will be willing to expend the time and energy demanded to preserve festivals like Kuroishi's Neputa in their present form.<br clear=all><hr><a href=jp05.html><img src=../wback.gif></a><a href=../95-18-01.html><img src=../wret.gif></a>

<h2><b>
Satisfaction from Service -<br>"Vegetable and Fruit Consultant"<br>Helps Consumer Learn

</h2></b>
<p><hr><p>

One association of local greengrocers in Tokyo has successfully promoted sales via an office to provide educational services to consumers. This office dispenses information on selecting, storing and preparing seasonal fruits and vegetables, and holds cooking classes. The trend towards nuclear families deprives many young people of the opportunity to learn the arts of cuisine at home from more experienced family members. The office of the "Vegetable and Fruit Consultant" is making up for this, and its services are especially popular with younger housewives. Greengrocers' associations elsewhere also help consumers recycle waste. Such "value-added" services appeal to community residents and help establish customer loyalty.

	<br>Large-scale retail stores in urban areas often benefit nearby small retailers with their power to draw customers. The emerging consensus in the distribution industry is that the relationship between large and small retailers should be seen as symbiotic rather than competitive. For consumers, a diversity of supermarkets, discount stores, local "mom-and-pop" stores and specialty shops means greater freedom of choice, encouraging more individualized, and often wiser, purchasing habits. As the photos illustrating this article suggest, sheer scale is less critical than the quality and character of the retailer in satisfying the demands of customers.

Trying to Beat the Odds



</h2></b><hr><p>



Fans of gambling games may try to beat the odds by collecting data or refining their playing strategies, but in the long run they are up against the forces of chance. No amount of skill can turn the odds in the player's favor, and gambling remains an essentially passive sport. Still, gamblers enjoy the pleasure of trying their luck. The outcome of a game of chance can simulate the turns of fate, giving its players a taste of fortune whether winning or losing, and there's always another chance to play.

	<br>What is the attraction of gambling? Unlike games of skill, everyone stands a roughly equal chance, however slim, of coming out a winner. Perhaps the gambler is encouraged by this form of protest against the less egalitarian realities of everyday life. Many young Japanese who find entertainment in games of chance say they are more interested in testing and perfecting their own winning formula than in trying to make a quick profit. Dostoyevsky, the great Russian novelist who spent much of his life at the gambling tables, once advised that the gambler should not expect too much of fortune, and that games of chance are really enjoyable only as long as the player can afford to lose.

Deneb Robotics, founded in 1985 and privately held, is today a
world leader in 3D graphics-based factory simulation,
telerobotic, and virtual reality software. Its products are
known for their patented user-friendly menus, comprehensive
application functionality including built-in libraries and
automatic processing of common operations, and an open
architecture for applications involving remote control of
automated devices interfacing with external databases or
integration of multiple system components. Deneb Robotics'
simulation and telerobotic software is widely used in the
aerospace, automotive, defense, environmental, medical, nuclear,
and research communities. With offices in Europe, Scandinavia,
Japan, Korea, India, and the United States, Deneb Robotics has
earned an international reputation for physics-based simulation
products that combine ease of use with the state of the art in
"virtual environment" technologies and methodologies.

the models used in simulation, analysis, programming, and
control applications. As a result, models are an exact
replication of the "real world" and output data is accurate,
rather than an approximation.

<P>
MADE is a joint collaboration project between Deneb Robotics, Inc. and 
Raytheon Electronic Systems, which is funded under the DARPA Manufacturing 
Automation and Design Engineering (MADE) Program  
We are developing  
a Manufacturing Simulation Driver (MSD) based around a STEP 
product/process model.  
The MSD system will demonstrate the automatic generation and execution of
distributed manufacturing simulations. These simulation models are produced by
Computer Aided Process Planning (CAPP) software tools which reason about CAD
product models, and produce manufacturing "scripts" from a process and resource
model of a manufacturing facility. This capability will enable emerging virtual
enterprises conducting collaborative design and manufacturing operations 
to simulate and
prove out the manufacturing cycle of a product prior to launching production
ramp-up.

Lockheed - Aeronautical Systems Company a Division of Lockheed Corporation, 
has contracted with Deneb Robotics, Inc.
to participate in the Simulation Assessment Validation Environment
(SAVE) Project. The main goal of this effort is to take the best of the
currently available simulation tools and allow them to work together
in an integrated environment. SAVE addresses two key issues: (1) resolve
seamless communication between simulation tools and (2) 
development of effective use practices. The system under development in
the SAVE program will provide integrated product teams the capabilities
to quickly perform what-if studies and accurately define a product's
cost and risk early in the design process using an integrated virtual 
manufacturing environment for next generation aircraft programs.

<H3>UltraArc provides process engineers with a powerful tool for the comprehensive and efficient analysis of arc welding tools, positioners and production systems to assure the optimal process plan before any tooling is purchased or fabricated.</H3>
<H2><IMG SRC="../../images/bull4.gif">   Calibration</H2>
UltraArc's unique Calibration functions utilize the robot as a calibration tool, eliminating the need for expensive measurement equipment. The precise position of factory floor workcell components, tool point offsets, and the specific robot's signature are identified to improve off-line program accuracy.
<P>
<IMG SRC="../../images/nearmiss.gif"><I>Collisions and near misses are automatically highlighted</I>
<P>
<H2><IMG SRC="../../images/bull4.gif">   Process Refinement</H2>
UltraArc automatically highlights collisions and near misses between all devices in the workcell. This feature assists in the evaluation of various robots, torches, torch angles, positioners, and other equipment in the workcell. The user can then analyze robot placement, motion, and cycle time to determine the optima. workcell configuration.
<H2><IMG SRC="../../images/bull4.gif">   Analysis</H2>
Simulation data are displayed in floating pop-up windows:
<UL>
	<LI>	Position (Joints and TCP)
	<LI>	Speed (Joints and TCP)
	<LI>	Weld Process Data
	<LI>	Cycle Time
	<LI>	I/O Communication Status
	<LI>	Analysis features such as angle, distance, and part ID facilitate workcell refinement
</UL>
<P>
<IMG SRC="../../images/traject.gif"><I>Analysis of robot trajectory</I>
<P>
The user can display a trace of the robot trajectory, time log of when points are reached, and strip charts with continuous feedback.
Accurate motion planning based on field tests and manufacturers' specifications assures accurate trajectory.
Cycle time accuracy in excess of 95 percent can be achieved in UltraArc simulation. The ability to reach all seams with the proper torch angle and without collisions can be confirmed
<H3>To achieve a new level of "agile manufacturing," use the UltraArc robot simulation, analysis, and off-line programming tool. Just give us a call. We'll be glad to show you how to optimize your robotic arc welding systems.</H3>

<H1><B>The New Standard for Discrete Event Simulation</B></H1>
<IMG SRC="../../images/quest.gif"> 
<H2>The QUeueing Event Simulation Tool, QUEST, from Deneb represents a quantum leap in the modelling and analysis of manufacturing systems. Detailed physical system properties combined with interactive 3D graphics and visual analysis deliver a new level of ease, power and accuracy.</H2>
<P>
<IMG SRC = "../../images/pr_bar.gif">
<BR>
<BR>
<H2><IMG SRC="../../images/bull4.gif">   Modelling</H2>
QUEST includes a rich resource library of geometric models which, combined with a Visual File Interface, enables users to quickly and accurately model:
<UL>
<LI>Conveyors, Buffers, Docks
<LI>Workcells and Processes
<LI>Shared/Team Labor
<LI>AS/RS
<LI>Power & Free
<LI>AGVs, Forklifts, Cranes</UL>
<IMG SRC="../../images/quest6.gif"><P>
Other devices can be built with the integral CAD package, or imported from IGES, DXF, and other formats. For IGRIP users, existing robot workcell models and robot or other complex machinery cycle times can be directly imported to QUEST. 
<P>
Model states can be saved and recalled at any point during the simulation. This convenient feature speeds trouble-shooting and reduces the warmup time required to perform steady-state simulation experiments. 
<H2><IMG SRC="../../images/bull4.gif">   Logic</H2>
QUEST models directly emulate real-world system behaviors through distributed logics that can be associated with each resource, including:
<UL>
<LI>Route, Sequence, and Merge 
<LI>Composite Processes with Requirement/Selection Rules
<LI>Buffering Policies
<LI>AS/RS Storage and Retrieval 		
<LI>Built-in Pull Production Attributes
<LI>JIT/Kanban Thresholds
<LI>Request-based Decision-making</UL>
<IMG SRC="../../images/quest2.gif"><P>
The most commonly needed behavior logics are easily selected from comprehensive logic menus, and many are parameter-driven for even greater flexibility. 
<P>
For unique problems, QUEST's Simulation Control Language (SCL) can be used. This high-level, structured language provides distributed processing with access to all system variables. SCL allows expert users to define custom behaviors and to gain unlimited control over the simulation. 
<P>
<H3>Now, efficiently explore production scenarios, product mixes, and failure responses for machine and labor utilization, bottleneck and throughput evaluation.  Analyze and justify production costs, capital investments, and monitor the value of work-in-process, inventory and ROI.</H3>
<IMG SRC="../../images/quest3.gif">
<H2><IMG SRC="../../images/bull4.gif">   Physical Properties</H2>
QUEST incorporates real production variables, such as physical lengths, speeds, accelerations/decelerations, and plant layout to analyze the effects on material handling equipment and labor. For example, QUEST simulations enable parts of different sizes to accurately accumulate on conveyors, and user-defined labor paths to determine the time spent by a human model walking to service a workcell process.
<P>
<IMG SRC="../../images/quest4.gif">
<H2><IMG SRC="../../images/bull4.gif">   Batch Control</H2>
QUEST's open architecture allows the advanced user to perform batch simulation runs to automatically collect and tabulate data using the Batch Control Language (BCL). Replications and para-meter optimization are easily controlled with simple batch command files; advanced applications can be developed to drive QUEST from any program on a UNIX network using TCP/IP socket protocols.
<BR><P>  
<IMG SRC="../../images/quest5.gif">
<H3>QUEST gives new meaning to interactive modelling and what if evaluations. The effects of any model change can be instantly seen just by pressing the RUN button. True 3D animation occurs in real-time, not as a recording. Lengthy edit/compile/run/analyze cycles are eliminated.</H3>
<H2><IMG SRC="../../images/bull4.gif">   Power & Free</H2>
Accumulating and non-accumulating Power & Free conveyors are quickly built from such standard components as:
<UL>
<LI>Over		
<LI>Over/Under		
<LI>Sidepush		
<LI>Inverted		
<LI>Straight
<LI>Curve
<LI>Merge/Exit
<LI>Incline/Decline</UL>
<IMG SRC="../../images/quest1.gif">
<P>
Dog intervals, carrier spacing, gap/no-gaps, and dog delays at a chain transition are accurately modelled. Accumulation behavior is physically correct, with exact timings and delays, even for a mixture of carrier types and bias-accumulation. Decision points can be placed on the conveyor segments, with built-in or SCL logics to control:
<UL>
<LI>Loading/Unloading
<LI>Processing			
<LI>Delays
<LI>Zonal restrictions
<LI>Merge Sequencing</UL>
<H2><IMG SRC="../../images/bull4.gif">   Analysis</H2>

There is no limit to the number of machine tool axes that can be modelled; 3-, 4-, 5-, even 16-axis machines can be created. Any number of peripheral devices can be included, such as tool changers, pallet loaders or robots. 
<P>
Virtual NC is the ideal tool for simulating complex machining cells.
<P>
<IMG SRC="../../images/vnc1.gif">
<BR>
<I>The Visual File Interface simplifies component selection by enabling the user to quickly browse and access files</I>
<H2><IMG SRC="../../images/bull4.gif">   Training</H2>
Use Virtual NC to train new machine operators and NC programmers. For advanced training, operators and programmers can gain proficiency with high-level CNC controller commands safely, quickly, and without risk.
<P>
Recover the cost of Virtual NC by avoiding just one equipment crash!
<H2><IMG SRC="../../images/bull4.gif">   Cycle Information</H2>

<H3>Virtual NC's operator pendant has the same characteristics as standard CNC controllers and is operated in exactly the same manner as an actual machine tool controller. Standard functions like Jog, Single Block Execution, and Manual Data Input (MDI) are included. </H3>
<IMG SRC="../../images/vnc4.gif">
<I>Dynamic dimensions are continuously updated</I>
<H2><IMG SRC="../../images/bull4.gif">   Universal CNC Controller</H2>
Mimic, Virtual NC's configurable controller emulator, is capable of reproducing the functionality of any CNC controller. Mimic provides continuous monitoring and feedback of the machining cycle and automatically creates user-defined reports. Mimic also provides an open environment in which user-defined process algorithms can be evaluated, refined and implemented. A unique Mimic configuration file can be easily created for each machine tool. 
<P>
<IMG SRC="../../images/vnc5.gif">
<BR>
<I>Virtual NC also supports laser and waterjet cutting, punching, grinding, riveting, and EDM processing</I>
<H3>Virtual NC enables the user to improve the quality of NC programs, eliminate catastrophic program errors, and optimize machining processes. The result is maximized machine tool productivity.</H3>
<H2><IMG SRC="../../images/bull4.gif">   Concurrent Engineering</H2>
Virtual NC provides an environment through which engineers and program-mers can evaluate the actual machine controller and different processing techniques without monopolizing machine time or risking damage to the actual machine tool. Engineers can evaluate machine tool capabilities,  setups, and also debug and test new post-processors. With Virtual NC, uncertainty is eliminated.
<P>
<IMG SRC="../../images/vnc6.gif">
<I>Collisions and near misses are automatically highlighted</I>
<H2><IMG SRC="../../images/bull4.gif">   Collision Avoidance</H2>
Virtual NC automatically detects near misses and collisions, and will stop the cycle or log the event noting the NC program block in which the collision occurred, the collision duration, and the parts damaged. Collision tolerances can be specified to maintain safe distances between any two components. Users can enforce machine parameters by setting limits for axis over travel, maximum axis speed and maximum acceleration.
<H2><IMG SRC="../../images/bull4.gif">   Process Evaluation</H2>
Powerful functions indicate the conditions that cause chatter and tool breakage, or gouges and undercuts. All tooling data is linked to each tool. Monitoring functions automatically record the time spent and the volume of material removed by a tool to track wear and predict failure. 
<P>
<IMG SRC="../../images/vnc7.gif">
<I>The current program block is highlighted as the simulation runs</I>
<P>
When the simulation is cycling, the NC program can be viewed with the active block highlighted. The user can edit the block and instantly observe  the results.
<H2><IMG SRC="../../images/bull4.gif">   Process Refinement</H2>
Efficiently evaluate existing or new setups. Check fixture design and workpiece placement, verify machinability and identify interferences. Analyze feedrates, optimize the tool path, minimize tool changes. Identify program blocks that are responsible for excessive time spent cutting air. With Virtual NC, users can usually reduce cycle time by 30 - 40 percent.

<H1><B>The Complete Solution for Telerobotics</B></H1>
<IMG SRC="../../images/telegrip.gif"> 
<H2>Deneb's Tele-interactive Graphics Robot Instruction Program, TELEGRIP, represents a breakthrough in 3D simulation-based interactive programming and control tools for robots and other computer-controlled devices. </H2>
<P>
<IMG SRC = "../../images/pr_bar.gif">
<BR>
<BR>
<H2><IMG SRC="../../images/bull4.gif">   Complete Integration</H2>
With TELEGRIP, a new class of intelligent robots with integrated sensors, graphic representation, real-time reasoning, and electro-mechanical systems  can be developed and implemented. Systems can be planned, built, programmed, and controlled for:
<UL>
<LI> Telerobotics
<PRE>	 Shared Control
	 Graphical Programming
	 Video Overlay</PRE>
<LI> Distributed Control
<PRE>	 Direct Communication
	 Operation Feedback</PRE>
</UL>
<IMG SRC="../../images/tgrip1.gif">
<P>
TELEGRIP's flexibility and open architecture also support:
<UL>
<LI> Human Factors Engineering
<PRE>	 Human/Machine Interface
	 Maintenance</PRE>
<LI> Virtual Reality
<PRE>	 Information Presentation
	 Telepresence</PRE>
<LI> Prototyping
<PRE>	 Modelling
	 Operation Validation</PRE>
<LI> Task Visualization
<PRE>	 Texture Mapping
	 Conceptualization</PRE>
<LI> Design
<PRE>	 Mechanism Design</PRE>
</UL>
<H2><IMG SRC="../../images/bull4.gif">   Modelling and Programming</H2>
Models are easily created in TELEGRIP. Built-in CAD capabilities and tools such as comparative video overlays enable the operator to visualize the actual work environment and superimpose live video upon the model to assure accuracy. Kinematic models of the robot and workspace components allow the operator to pre-plan and optimize robot trajectories. Programming is enhanced by TELEGRIP's true 3D graphics which allow the operator to preview the result of operations before they are executed.
<P>
<IMG SRC="../../images/tgrip2.gif">
<P>
<I>Video Overlay</I>
<H2><IMG SRC="../../images/bull4.gif">   Validation</H2>
In systems with integrated sensors, TELEGRIP can be used as a strategic validation tool. Feedback from the actual work environment can reveal obstacles and update the modelled environment in real-time. With this data, TELEGRIP can automatically adjust robot motions. 
<P>
Feedback from devices can be used for task verification, to assure compliance with pre-approved operating parameters, and for database generation.

<H2><IMG SRC="../../images/bull4.gif">   Open Architecture</H2>
TELEGRIP has been developed using industry software and hardware standards and network protocols to assure inter-operability. 
<P>
Its open software architecture enables the user to develop and link user-generated programs in any high-level language, such as C. Tools include the Deneb Graphics User Interface and the X-based Motif User Interface. 
<P>
TELEGRIP's hierarchical architecture employs a reasoning system for high-level device control. This enables both the simulation system and multiple programmable devices to be controlled in one user interface:
<UL>
<LI> Direct all robots/devices in one language syntax and structure
<LI> Graphically program any robot simply by moving the goal point
</UL>
<H2>TELEGRIP provides a bilateral, real-time operator interface to robot and device controllers enabling operators to work safely, quickly, and efficiently in complex environments. TELEGRIP provides a dynamic, single point of control.</H2>
<H2><IMG SRC="../../images/bull4.gif">   Multiple Control Modes</H2>
With TELEGRIP's multiple control modes, robots can be programmed to adapt movements and avoid collisions without operator intervention to accomplish the specified task. If the robot cannot accomplish its task, TELEGRIP enables it to re-plan its motions or to request operator assistance. Control modes are user-defined:
<UL>
<LI> Shared Control
<LI> Autonomous
<LI> Teleoperation
</UL>
<P>

<H2><IMG SRC="../../images/bull4.gif">   Bilateral Communication</H2>
TELEGRIP's Low Level Telerobotic Interface (LLTI) is the industry's only optimized high-speed bilateral communication interface specifically developed for telerobotics. The interface is designed expressly for data flow from external controllers, teach pendants, or other input devices. This capability is essential for:
<UL>
<LI> Man-Machine Shared Control		
<LI> Hazardous Waste Cleanup	
<LI> Nuclear Reactor Maintenance		
<LI> Space Station Maintenance
<LI> Underwater Retrieval			
<LI> Virtual Reality
</UL>
<H2><IMG SRC="../../images/bull4.gif">   Application-Specific Options</H2>
The Path Planning option provides default path planners and the ability to create custom path planners.
<P>
The Calibration option provides advanced tools to locate parts or devices with respect to the robot's position, to determine tool offsets, and for robot signature analysis.
<P>
<IMG SRC="../../images/tgrip8.gif">
<P>
<H2><IMG SRC="../../images/bull4.gif">   Control Options</H2>
The Real-time Programming and Control option provides interfaces to device controllers or can serve as the real-time servo-control system for those computer-based devices  not equipped with a controller.
<P>
Standard interfaces provided 
include ABB, Adept, CimCorp, Comau, Fanuc, GMF, Motoman, Nachi, Robotics Research, Schilling, and Unimation. Custom control 
interfaces can also be developed. 
<P>

<P><U>For Immediate Release: September, 1996</U> </P>

<H3>Large Simulation Models Move to the Low-Cost Desktop </H3>

<P>AUBURN HILLS, Mich. -- The power of the Unified Memory Architecture
of the Silicon Graphics&reg; O2<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>TM</FONT></SUP> desktop
workstation combined with hardware support for texture mapping, enables
the Deneb user to enjoy the simulation performance previously available
on much higher priced machines. According to Jay Harrison, senior vice
president of research and development at Deneb, &quot;This is the machine
that brings the Deneb Hi-Fi Rendering<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>TM</FONT></SUP>
level of detail management down to the low cost desktop.&quot; This is
particularly important for Deneb's ENVISION&reg; Virtual Prototyping software
where very large CAD models must be interactive to maintain the user's
productivity. Also, complex 3D facility layouts modelled in Deneb's QUEST&reg;
discrete event simulation software can be fully rendered without a loss
in simulation speed. </P>

<P>The MIPS&reg; R5000<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>TM</FONT></SUP> and the R10000<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>TM</FONT></SUP>
processors provide the horsepower for the computational intensive material
removal algorithms in the Virtual NC&reg; software for CNC program verification
and optimization. This power allows the dynamics module within Deneb's
IGRIP&reg; and ENVISION software to perform in near real-time. This affordable
computational power for both CAD and process engineering will significantly
increase the efficiency of Deneb users. </P>

<P>Bob Brown, Deneb's president, is pleased that the O2 workstation is
built network-ready. He comments, &quot;This permits our users to take
advantage of one of our most popular options which provides Virtual Collaborative
Engineering across the Internet or dial-up lines.&quot; Non-collocated
Concurrent Engineering Teams can use these low-cost platforms to actively
participate in Virtual Manufacturing simulations evaluating Design for
Manufacturing and Design for Assembly trade-offs. </P>

<P>The JPEG real-time video capture capability is particularly important
for creating a historical record of these trade-off discussions. These
videos can be used to communicate product concepts to customers, component
assembly problems to vendors, and used to justify large capital expenditures
for plant and equipment. It is also a powerful tool for capturing the procedures
for manufacturing, assembly and service, and produce low cost videos for
worker training and field service training. Utilizing the O2 workstation's
standard video editor, the simulation video can be edited, titles inserted,
and a voice-over added. These service instructions can be easily &quot;dragged
and dropped&quot; onto the manufacturer's home page on the Web in the form
of a MPEG video, and downloaded from anywhere in the world. </P>

<P>This low-cost workstation with built-in TCP/IP socket capabilities makes
the O2 workstation ideal for Deneb's TELEGRIP<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>TM</FONT></SUP>
telerobotic software for controlling remote operations. The hardware-supported
texture mapping and Deneb's HI-Fi Rendering level of detail management
enable this platform to service large full 3D scene maps for remote operations.
</P>

<P>Rakesh Mahajan, the CEO of Deneb, said, &quot;We can finally recommend
with confidence a platform for under $10,000 that provides the productivity
demanded by our users.&quot; He expects this to enhance the acceptance
of the 3D simulation for Virtual Prototyping and Virtual Manufacturing
beyond the 35 to 40 percent growth rate experienced in the last two years.
</P>

<P>Deneb Robotics Inc. is a worldwide leader in 3D simulation software
for Virtual Manufacturing and Virtual Prototyping with headquarters in
Auburn Hills, Mich., and offices and representatives in Germany, UK, France,
Scandinavia, Japan, Australasia, Korea, Singapore and India. Deneb's products

RELEASE:  96-147

GOLDIN TO DEDICATE ROBOTICS FACILITY IN PITTSBURGH

     On July 29, NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin will 
officially dedicate the new National Robotics Engineering 
Consortium (NREC) facility, establishing a collaborative 
government/academia/industry commitment designed to rapidly 
move NASA-developed robotics technology out of federal 
laboratories and into the private sector.  

     To be dedicated at a ceremony in Pittsburgh, PA,  the 
Consortium -- operated by Carnegie Mellon University -- will 
involve NASA technologists, academic researchers and U.S. 
robotics companies who are concluding a two-year start-up 
period and will now begin meeting ambitious, near-term goals 
with immediate applications to the agricultural and mining 
industries. 

     "The United States robotics industry desperately needs 
to be re-invigorated," said Goldin.  "We must act now to 
regain what previously was America's dominance in this $8 
billion per year international robotics industry.  That's 
exactly what the Robotics Engineering Consortium is all about."

     Requiring equal participation by government and 
industry, and ultimately anticipated to be self-sustaining, 
the NREC was established in 1994 with NASA grants to Carnegie 
Mellon.  Agency "seed money" so far has amounted to $2.5 
million.  In addition, the NREC has attracted more than $10 
million in matching funds from the city of Pittsburgh and the 
state of Pennsylvania to support the NREC physical plant.  
More than $10 million in corporate sponsorship has also been 
obtained with major participation from Caterpillar, Ford, New 
Holland, Silicon Graphics, <B>Deneb</B>, Joy Manufacturing and 
Heister Corp. 

     The first major projects of the NREC include the 
development of an automated agricultural harvesting system 
and an autonomous mining vehicle.  

NOTE TO EDITORS:  The NREC dedication is scheduled for 4:00 
pm, EDT, on Monday, July 29, and will be followed by a 
demonstration of robot vehicles including NASA's Dante-II, 
developed by Carnegie Mellon, that explored an active crater 
of Mt. Spur, an Alaskan volcano, near Anchorage, in 1994.  
For further information on ceremony participants, directions, 
and a detailed listing of demonstrations, please contact Anne 
Watzman at the above listed number.

<H3>General Motors Truck Group Names Deneb Vendor of Choice</H3>
<BODY>
PONTIAC, MI, August 25, 1995  General Motors Truck Group (GMTG) is pleased to announce the decision on selecting Deneb Robotics as the vendor of choice for 3D simulation software. This decision supports GMTG's direction to use technology in support of GMTG's business goals of Fast to Market and Improved Quality. The use of simulation for 3D manufacturing operations reduces tooling development costs, optimizes manufacturing operations and time to market through the ability to eliminate equipment design problems with simulation prior to actual creation of manufacturing tools. A database library will be used to capture the best practices for future programs and enhance common process memory.
<P>
The selection of a single simulation software package brings GMTG closer to our vision of implementing a user friendly process to efficiently utilize math data, tool, and 3D simulation. Our envisioned process will validate up front product/process interfaces, tooling, operational ergonomics, workplace layout, and total process flow prior to production tool build. This will optimize total cycle time from concept initiation to start of pilot build by allowing earlier identification and correction of tooling, operator, and layout problems. GMTG will also be able to better link up front design alternatives with the Truck Bill of Process to optimize Design For Manufacturability/Design For Assembly and capture lessons learned.
<P>
GMTG's Manufacturing Engineering staff, have over the past three months accomplished a detailed evaluation of available 3D simulation software packages. Using a comprehensive software evaluation process recommended by EDS, this team evaluated several suites of software. The evaluation included the following decision factor categories:
<UL>
<LI>Support of GMTG's business goals and Visionary direction
<LI>Industry and technology trends addressed
<LI>Current usage of the software in the market place
<LI>Software functionality richness
<LI>Feature to Feature comparison
<LI>Performance, including translation of data
<LI>Vendor Focus, Direction and Support
<LI>Responsiveness to User Requirements</UL>

<H3>Army Honors "Quality"/ Deneb Robotics Named 1995 Supplier of the Year</H3>
<BODY>
AUBURN HILLS, MI, August 9, 1994  The United States Army Tank-Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center (TARDEC) recognizes five organizations as the 1995 Suppliers of the Year.  The three private corporations receiving recognition are Deneb Robotics (virtual prototyping); General Motors (Crash Avoidance Department); and ServAir Inc. (internal service contractor).  The other organizations recognized were Michigan Technological University (academia) and an internal Tank-Automotive and Armaments Command (TACOM) organization.
<P>
The Supplier of the Year ceremony was held in conjunction with TARDEC's Aug. 9 Associates' Day.  The day was designated as Associates' Day in recognition of Vice President Al Gore presenting TARDEC with the prestigious 1996 Presidential Award for Quality on Aug. 2.  TARDEC is the first Department of the Army organization to win this award and is only the fourth federal organization to win since the inception of the President's Quality Award Program in 1989.  "This is not an award given to the government organization with the highest level of quality, it is an award given to the organization that has demonstrated the greatest commitment to achieve quality," said TARDEC Director Wayne Wheelock.
<P>
Richard Alix, Vice President of Business Operations for TARDEC, presented the Supplier of the Year awards and said, "These are the best organizations that have been with us in the trenches along our quality journey."  He continued, "They are our partners in quality."
<P>
Also, Wheelock presented the Presidential Award for Quality to the associates, and expressed his honor and pride in representing TARDEC last week in Washington, D.C.
<P>
"You do not know how proud you should be for what you've done," said TACOM's Commanding General Edward L. Andrews.  "I watched the Vice President with honesty and compassion give you all the award."  Andrews continued by saying how Sen. Carl Levin and U.S. Rep. Sander Levin raved about how proud they were of TARDEC's accomplishment.
<P>
"We have collaborated with TARDEC on leading edge developments and look forward to working together on meeting future goals.  Our success and recognition today is a result of the quality and dedication of the employees from both our organizations.  Their commitment to excellence and continuous improvement has been responsible for our achievements," said Victor Rhoder, Director Business Development, Deneb Robotics, Inc., upon receipt of the Award.
<P>
TARDEC is a component of the U.S. Army Tank-Automotive and Armaments Command, headquartered at the Detroit Arsenal in Warren, Mich.

<H3>Deneb Announces Next-Generation Simulation Functionality  "HiFi" Level of Detail Management  for Indigo2 IMPACT from Silicon Graphics</H3>
<BODY>
AUBURN HILLS, MI  July 10, 1995  Deneb Robotics, Inc. announced today the widespread availability of the "HiFi" Level of Detail Management simulation enhancement on the new Indigo2 IMPACT workstation from Silicon Graphics. The HiFi  function was introduced to Deneb's simulation software products with the 1994 release, but only high-end workstations, such as the Silicon Graphics ONYX system, had the graphics performance to support the software. With the introduction of  the Indigo2 IMPACT systems, which were announced today by Silicon Graphics, virtually all Deneb's users can gain the benefits of HiFi simulations.
<P>
"Because this hardware/software combination expands computing performance and productivity, we expect that our installed base of users in the automotive, aerospace, defense, medical, nuclear, research and development, academic, and other industries will quickly take advantage of this breakthrough and apply the technology to more complex simulation and virtual reality applications," explains Jay Harrison, Senior Vice President, Deneb Robotics, Inc. "These are the applications that before the Indigo2 IMPACT system were not practical to undertake because productivity was bound by graphics performance. The price point of the Indigo2 IMPACT system will make it an attractive choice for both new workstation purchases and upgrades."
<P>
The Indigo2 IMPACT system offers the world's fastest desktop 3D graphics and imaging performance  a minimum of five times the 3D performance of Silicon Graphics Extreme Graphics. 
<P>
"The built-in texture mapping capability of the Indigo2 IMPACT system improves the graphics performance of the simulations without the loss of visual fidelity," says Harrison.  "In engineering applications, users can't customize simulations and reduce the model complexity in the same fashion as can be done in entertainment or marketing applications. Deneb's HiFi is a viable technique to interact with the model data at a reasonable update rate and without sacrificing the model complexity. We used SGI's unique texture tools to implement the HiFi functionality."
<P>
In a recent demonstration using actual simulations of U.S. Navy landing vehicles at sea, the performance capabilities of the Indigo2 IMPACT system enabled the simulation to run at a rate equivalent to 4 million polygons per second. Without HiFi and the Indigo2 IMPACT system, the performance of this simulation was 275,000 polygons per second.
<P>
"Deneb is very proud of its relationship with Silicon Graphics since 1985. Deneb and SGI have worked together closely on a variety of programs over the years to accelerate software and hardware development; the Indigo2 IMPACT system is another project undertaken for the benefit of the end user. The Indigo2 IMPACT system, running Deneb simulation software, will provide the user a significant performance enhancement compared to other currently available hardware platforms and software packages."

In this environment, customers, engineers, suppliers, managers, technicians, and operators interact with the product and process design and communicate much more effectively. The ability to rapidly generate multiple iterations of design alternatives helps achieve the optimal design configuration and benefits the customer by minimizing engineering and production costs through Design for Manufacturability, and also reduces the lead time to market.
<P>
The virtual environment serves all the life cycle requirements from product design through process engineering work to achieve an optimum configuration. The virtual environment allows comprehensive analysis and reconfiguration "on-the-fly" to rapidly evaluate multiple "what-if" scenarios. The virtual environment replicates the impact of the visual, auditory, and tactile feedback without the cost of developing a physical prototype. The virtual prototype can then be analyzed through all stages of manufacturing to verify that it meets both customer requirements and manufacturing criteria for a competitive cost.

<H3>Sandia National Laboratories and Deneb Robotics, Inc. to Jointly Develop 
Graphical System Controller and Robot Path Planner 
For Hazardous or Complex Telerobotic Applications</H3>
<BODY>
AUBURN HILLS, MI, November, 1994   Sandia National Laboratories and Deneb Robotics, Inc. have entered into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA). Under this agreement, Sandia and Deneb will jointly develop software leading to a user-friendly robot path planner and graphical programming environment for telerobotics. Utilizing the extensive experience of Deneb and Sandia in the field of robotics, the resulting software will greatly enhance the planning and execution of demanding robotic tasks such as hazardous waste remediation and manufacturing by providing safe, accurate, and efficient motion paths for robotic equipment.
<P>
This CRADA will accelerate the development of improved robotic functionality in extreme work environments such as waste remediation, weapons manufacturing, assembly and disassembly. The outcome of this CRADA will be a complete development and control, simulation-based environment consisting of a user-friendly robot path planner that will assist the operator of telerobotic systems in effectively planning and programming robot tasks.  This simulated task environment, coupled with the sophisticated robot control system will enable the operator to preview telerobotic procedures from a risk-free workstation with the confidence provided by a "what you see is what you get," or WYSIWYG approach for robotics. Using this approach, the actual work performed in complex environments is assured to proceed safely, quickly, and efficiently.  
<P>
The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is supportive of this effort as it will lead to the development of additional capabilities in its Robotic Technology Development programs.
<P>
For industry-at-large, this CRADA provides for technology transfer and commercialization of developments into the industrial sector. Technology enhancements will be incorporated into Deneb's software offerings, which will benefit Deneb's users in the automotive, aerospace, and nuclear power industries, among others.
<P>
Sandia has over three years of experience in developing the Generic Intelligent System Control (GISC) technology. This technology facilitates the integration of diverse intelligent subsystems using a communication based, client-server approach to rapidly develop and deploy intelligent systems. Several GISC systems have been structurally developed. These include environmental restoration applications, agile manufacturing, and biomedical applications. In addition to the GISC applications, Sandia has provided control methodologies and automatic path planners for intelligent robot systems for several years.
<P>
As part of its contribution to the CRADA, Deneb has over eight years in developing highly accurate, real-time simulated work environments that also facilitate off-line robot programming. Deneb's core technology, the IGRIP (Interactive Graphic Robotic Instruction Program) software package, reduces robotic task development time through realistic, real-time simulation and off-line robotic programming capabilities.

<H2><IMG SRC="../../images/bull4.gif">   ENVISION VR Virtual Reality</H2>
ENVISION VR for Virtual Reality (VR) provides a powerful environment for designing and programming complex design, engineering, and training operations by allowing the user to interact more directly with the simulation environment. Users can fly and walk-through the simulated environment using virtual reality and telepresence techniques to operate devices, alter the environment by relocating components, or other- wise interact with the virtual world. Options are available to support multiple person simulation and Virtual Collaborative Engineering.
ENVISION VR was specifically designed to provide high fidelity and high speed system interaction. Selected features include:
<UL>
<LI> Alternative display technology	
<LI> Geometric representation of immersed objects
<LI> Interaction between immersed objects and simulated world
<LI> Position tracking
<LI> Event handling		
<LI> 3D spatial sound (optional)
</UL>
In addition, a wide array of visual display systems, position and object tracking systems, and event feedback devices are supported.
<P>

<H2>Deneb enhances system and subsystem level models with physics-based motion, virtual reality immersion, and ergonomic evaluation capabilities for highly accurate 3D simulation, analysis, and visualization.</H2>
<H2>Simulation Based Design</H2>
ENVISION VE and VP support form, fit, and function evaluations. Designers can analyze component placement and system configuration to optimize operations. Denebs virtual environment automatically detect component collisions.
<P> 
Multiple what-if scenarios can be rapidly explored during initial design and trade studies to determine the best concept before design closure.

<H2>Simulation Based Training</H2>
The ENVISION VE, VP, or VR model is the ideal training environment. 
Simulation based training can begin before fabrication or installation. 
End-users can use the model to achieve proficiency in operating and
 maintaining systems and subsystems without risk to operators or equipment.

Deneb provides the industry's first commercially available human model fully integrated into a design environment. With the <A HREF="../ergo/ergo.html">Deneb/ERGO</A> option, human factors can be evaluated and ergonomic issues like Design for Assembly (DFA) can be resolved by both the designer and the end-user early in the design process. Users can rapidly prototype and analyze human motion, including:
<UL>
<LI> Reachability
<LI> Field of view
<LI> RULA posture analysis 
<LI> NIOSH lifting guidelines
<LI> Gargs energy expenditure (k-cal/hr. 	prediction model)
<LI> MTM-UAS analysis for accurate activity timing

<H4><B><I>ABB STAL AB, Ludvika, Sweden, manufactures turbine blades for gas and steam turbines. One of the manufacturing operations is belt grinding, which is performed both manually and in a robotic grinding workcell.
</H4></B></I>
<P>
<H3>The Problem</H3>
Programming the robot workcell was more difficult and time consuming than expected, and caused manufacturing productivity problems. The difficulty was correctly positioning the curved surfaces of the turbine blade, carried by the robot, on the grinding media and achieving a good grinding pattern. If the robot programmer did not orient the robot in the proper configuration at the beginning of the program, the whole program would have to be remade to meet the grinding specification.
<P>
To solve this problem, ABB STAL investigated off-line programming for the robot grinding cell in January 1995. At that time, there was no commercially available software capable of making advanced grinding patterns on turbine blades. So, ABB STAL sought a cooperation partner to develop such a system.
<P>
<H3>The Solution</H3>
Tehdasmallit AB, a Deneb representative in Goteborg, Sweden, conducted a five day practical test and proved that UltraFinishT, with some slight modifications and additional macros, could generate the complex grinding programs. Two competitor's products were also reviewed, but neither had robot signature and/or calibration analysis capabilities, nor did they have grinding modules, external TCP, or sufficient path creation capabilities.
<P>
UltraFinish is an interactive, 3D graphic simulation tool specifically designed for off-line programming and optimizing robotic surface finishing applications. UltraFinish uses the surface geometry to generate the paths for an optimal robot program and downloads robot motion and process programs. All process data associated with each point is stored with the position data.
<P>
For applications where the robot is holding the workpiece, such as the ABB STAL application, UltraFinish provides a stationary workpoint programming environment. This functionality allows the user to take advantage of 3D surface information to lay out path nodes that are truly normal to the surface of the workpiece and then to program the robot to pass this path through a stationary point located at the front of the abrasive media. In conjunction with stationary workpoint programming capability is the ability to shift the workpoint across the face of the abrasive media as the robot moves along a path, improving overall wear and life of the abrasive belt or wheel.
<P>
A graphical, color coded, Contact Time Analysis feature monitors accumulated contact time on the workpiece. Also, UltraFinish has comprehensive collision and near-miss detection, and penetration monitoring capabilities.
<P>
ABB STAL purchased UltraFinish in April 1995 and by June 1995 programmers completed their first production grinding program.
<P>
<H3>Precision Calibration</H3>
<P>
The UltraFinish grinding cell model was calibrated by using the software's built-in calibration functions. The calibration improved the robot absolute positioning accuracy down to the level of the robot's mechanical repeatability. For this particular robot, the calibration resulted in an accuracy of better than 0.5 mm (0.02 in.). UltraFinish's superior technology enabled the robot to act as the calibration tool, eliminating the need for costly mechanical hardware and time-consuming modifications. The robot signature, or unique operating characteristics of a particular robot, traditionally results in design tolerance stack-up during manufacturing and assembly. This stack-up results in minute dimensional variances in the joint and axes that affect the positioning accuracy of the robot. In the traditional lead-through-teach methods, the operator visually compensates for the dimensional variances. However, UltraFinish was used to identify the dimensional data specific to the robot. This data was uploaded to the model for calibration to the real-world workcell. Then, the final program was downloaded to the robot. 
<P>
<H3>Off-line Programming</H3>
UltraFinish also allowed ABB STAL engineers to develop and test robot programs off-line in UltraFinish's 3D simulation environment, prior to program installation. This eliminated costly robot downtime for program tryouts and allowed the robot to remain in production during new program development.
<P>
<H3>Simulation Advantages</H3>
Now, daily robot grinding cell programming is performed off-line and programs that once were nearly impossible to program by the lead-through-teach method are easily generated, simulated, and downloaded using UltraFinish. Other advantages include:
<BR>
<BR>
<BL>
<LI>Improved program accuracy
<LI>Minimized robot downtime
<LI>Verified robot programs prior to implementation
</BL>
<P>
At ABB STAL, the UltraFinish 3D simulation and off-line programming system is seen as the new efficient interface to their robot grinding cell. UltraFinish and Tehdasmallit continue to support ABB STAL, helping them stay competitive throughout the '90s and beyond.
<BR>

<BR>
The simulated workcell (above) allowed ABB STAL to develop, calibrate, and test the complex grinding program without interrupting the real robot (below). Once the robot was properly calibrated and the program verified, the final program wasdownloaded to the robot. Now, daily programming is performed off-line, allowing the robot to maintain production while developing new programs.

Using IGRIP's Calibration Technology, CLOOS Improves Positioning Accuracy by More Than 80 Percent.
</H4></B></I>
<BR>
<P>
<H3>Real-world calibration issues</H3>
One of the major factors affecting robot programs generated off-line is the dimensional variability intrinsic to the factory floor robot being used to execute the program. Dimensional variances in link lengths, link offsets, link twists, and joint zero position contribute to each robot's unique "signature" which, in turn, affects the robot's positioning accuracy.
<P>
When a robot is programmed by the traditional teach pendant method, the operator visually compensates for any dimensional variance. But when off-line programming techniques are utilized, the simulated robot reflects the theoretically exact dimensions, not the actual dimensions. As a result, when a program created off-line is downloaded, robot positions are not accurate. To correct the program, the robot's signature must be analyzed and the dimensional offsets incorporated into the simulated robot.
<P>
Traditional robot signature analysis methods require the use of an external system that measures the location of the robot's Tool Center Point (TCP) in a reference plane. Such systems are expensive, difficult to use, and ill-suited for use in a production-oriented factory setting.
<P>
<H3>Using IGRIP to calibrate the simulation</H3>
CLOOS, Haiger, Germany, conducted an experiment using IGRIP to define the robot's signature and calibrate the simulation. The objective was to improve the positioning accuracy of the robot when running a program generated off-line. This capability would enable CLOOS to improve the accuracy of its turnkey systems.
<P>
CLOOS first used IGRIP to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed experiment. The analysis included determining if the robot could be used to measure its own signature effects, analyzing how many measurement points would be required, where the points should be placed, predicting the results of the experiment, and determining what positioning accuracy could be achieved. The experimental hypothesis was that most robot accuracy errors were the result of incorrect joint zeros. The experiment was simulated and a robot motion program was generated off-line by IGRIP. 
<P>
The experiment workcell was comprised of a 6-axis CLOOS ROMAT 76AW robot and a 2-axis rotary positioning table. The calibration figure was comprised of three precision-machined cones mounted on the faceplate of the positioner at known positions. The robot was fitted with a weld torch in which the wire was replaced with a pointer to assure that all measurements had a constant tool offset.
<P>
In the IGRIP simulation, the robot's TCP was moved to each of the three cones in the various orientations using the two front configurations of the robot. A robot motion program was generated, downloaded, and stepped through to adjust each point so that the TCP was exactly at the tip of the cone.
<P>
Next, the actual TCP measurement data were uploaded into the IGRIP simulation. IGRIP's Joint Offsets ID function was used to analyze the data and automatically adjust the joint zero offsets of the simulated robot. With this data, the IGRIP workcell was calibrated. The calibrated program was then downloaded and executed.
<P>
<H3>Results</H3>
Prior to calibration, the robot's accuracy was between 1.0 and 2.9 mm (0.04 and 0.11 in.). After calibration, the robot's positioning accuracy was increased to between 0.0 and 0.5 mm (0.0 and 0.02 in.).
<P>
The next step was to repeat the experiment to analyze all eight possible workcell configurations. Before calibration, the accuracy was between 1.2 and 8.6 mm (0.05 and 0.34 in.). After calibration, the positioning accuracy was again improved to near 100 percent. Further, the experimental values indicate that the robot inaccuracies are, in fact, due to other signature effects in addition to joint zeros.
<P>
These results are significant because a production arc welding program may contain hundreds or thousands of data points. If, when the program is downloaded, many of the points must be adjusted, some of the off-line programming advantages - reduced robot down time, reduced robot programming time - are diminished.
<P>
In addition, it was determined that when a floor-mounted robot is used to work in the front configurations only, defining the joint zero offsets is sufficient for successful calibration, minimizing the number of points and time needed for signature analysis while still improving accuracy. But when all the robot configurations are used, all of the signature parameters must be defined.  This work has enabled Deneb to enhance IGRIP's CLOOS-CAROLA post-processor.

<H4><B><I>The U.S. foundry industry is using computer simulation to regain a competitive advantage.  Real-time process modelling helps to gain efficiencies and reduce costs in manufacturing, and allows the industry is prove out process changes to reduce environmental impact.</H4></B></I>
<BODY>
When stringent air regulation amendments to the 1990 Clean Air Act threatened U.S. foundries with significant capital costs for retrofitting or forced closure, the government and private sector formed the Casting Emission Reduction Program (CERP) to address the environmental issues.  QUEST interactive 3D graphics discrete event simulation software from Deneb Robotics, Inc., Auburn Hills, MI, has supported the CERP project team at McClellan Air Force Base, Sacramento, CA, to demonstrate the viability of a pilot foundry prior to construction.  The foundry will be built at McClellan AFB in 1996, to conduct environmental and process experimentation. The innovations resulting from experiments at the pilot foundry will be exportable to the Department of Defense (DoD) and commercial foundries. 
<P>
CERP participants include the U.S. Air Force Advanced Manufacturing Center at McClellan Air Force Base; and the Environmental Research Consortium, a committee of the U.S. Council for Automotive Research (USCAR) which is a U.S. auto company coalition.  The consortium includes Chrysler Corporation, Ford Motor Company, General Motors Corporation and Navistar International Corporation. The Environmental Protection Agency, the California Air Resources Board and the American Foundrymen's Society are also participating in the project. 
<P>
USCAR agreed to supply technical resources through a joint applied research project.  The five-year, $50-million effort received authorization and congressional appropriation of $13.5M in fiscal '94 and a $12M appropriation in fiscal '95.
<P>
<H3>Castings: Essential Products</H3>
Over 90 percent of all manufactured items used by the DoD either are castings, contain castings or are derived from castings.  The weapon systems used by all branches of the military make large scale use of metalcasting. Castings are also critical in the private sector.  Automobiles and transportation equipment use 50 to 60 percent of all castings produced.  Castings also have many applications in home and office products.     
<P>
Present environmental regulations and the capital intensive nature of the foundry industry has reduced that nation's capacity to produce castings. One fourth of the metalcasting facilities in the United States has closed or moved offshore. 
<P>
To revitalize the U.S. foundry industry, CERP's initial goal is to develop new materials, processes or equipment for metalcasting manufacturing that will achieve a near-zero effect on the environment.  A second goal is to bridge the critical gap between laboratory and full scale casting production.<P>
<P>
According to CERP's Site Program Manager Bill Walden,  "The formation of CERP grew out of a visit to McClellan by auto company executives on another government and industry partnership project.  During the visit, they toured the manufacturing facilities, including a foundry, and that led to a discussion about mutual environmental concerns. 
<P>
"Since the military isn't exempt from any rules that the private sector is subject to, we all needed to find ways to reduce foundry emissions to comply with the new regulations.  The auto companies have the same problems except they are larger.  The American Foundrymen's Society is concerned because it represents both big and small foundries.    
<P>
"We've involved the California and Federal Environmental Protection Agencies in what has become one of the largest focused initiatives on reducing emissions in the country.  Having the government and industry working together to reduce emissions and address foundry industry regulations strengthened our position.  As a result, we and the American Foundrymen's Society were able to get the EPA to move the time line for the maximum achievable control technologies standards act, which was set to go in force in '97, out three years." 
<P>
<H3>Demonstrating A Solution </H3>
CERP's objectives included building a pilot facility for testing and research, collecting data on actual emissions, developing low level emission testing equipment and modelling foundry processes. 
<P>
Walden reports, "As we started looking at the work going on in the project, we knew we needed a way to demonstrate the concept we had in mind.  That's when we looked at all the available software including Deneb's. 
<P>
"We explained that we needed a way to show people what this foundry's going to look like in a 3D way and we also needed bottleneck analysis and discrete event simulation capabilities.  It was clear that QUEST could provide the solutions not only for the foundry, but also for our need to optimize production processes throughout our command." 
<P>
After the procurement of QUEST and IGRIP, Manufacturing Engineer Kirsten Ulowetz, was trained at Deneb prior to developing the foundry simulation model.  Once completed, the model was shown at a commandwide VISION Conference to demonstrate the technology. 
<P>
"QUEST enabled us to create a computer simulation that takes the audience through the new foundry. Since viewers experienced it will all their senses, no prior technical knowledge was required and we didn't have to rely on their ability to imagine."
<P>
"Although the model we presented was conceptual, the content, like the object library that was created, could be used to prepare the technical model," says Dennis Schuetzle, Director of Research and Technology, Ford Motor Company.  "That's one of the software's strengths. You don't have to start over and changes can be made very quickly. 
<P>
"As a result, when we began design change discussions we didn't have to start from scratch.  We've moved into doing analyses to optimize the layout.  We're going in with very specific data from our design group and talking about feeds, flows and equipment. 
<P>
"Eventually, we see using the software as a solution to our time and motion studies problem.  We'll be using QUEST and IGRIP (Interactive Graphics Robot Instruction Program) to design our layout and our workplaces.  This will enable us not only to analyze them for the human factors from an ergonomics standpoint, but we also can do time study measurement. That will prevent us from having to do some huge industrial engineering stop watch study.  That's one of the reasons we want to build a consensus to implement the software as a standard in lieu of doing engineered time standards."
<P>
<H3>3D Graphics and Simulation:  A New User's Perspective</H3>   
Ulowetz explains, "When I began training at Deneb, I had no experience with 3D graphics or virtual reality simulation software. I knew I wanted to simulate a foundry so I brought equipment brochures, layouts and flow plans.  The contractor helping us do the foundry's conceptual design sent a disk with the layout and plans, which Deneb read in and converted to QUEST. 
<P>
"The software is incredibly user-friendly.  As a new user, I found the three-tier menu system very helpful.  I was able to do simulations right off the bat.  There are many features that made learning and doing simple.  For example, the CAD side of QUEST is so incredibly fast and easy to use, you can switch back and forth, pop things right in and even modify them just by clicking on the model side and attaching the new configuration. 
<P>
"Another capability that is extremely helpful is QUEST's ability to determine throughput.  It shows you in 3D where buffers are getting filled up so you can figure out what your bottlenecks are and easily evaluate different equipment layouts by moving them around.   
<P>
"It provides manufacturing information like work-in-process very readily and helps you analyze and use the data from other manufacturing systems.  Also, another benefit of doing real-time simulation is the statistical information that's available in a management friendly format. 
<P>
"QUEST needed to be able to do some very realistic motion. For example, there's some critical timing between loading the furnace, having it charge, pouring the molds and the timing of the overhead crane going back and forth.  QUEST handled that very well through the Simulation Control Language. 
<P>
"After the simulation was done and we began showing it to various audiences, I saw additional benefits to its ability to demonstrate the concept. As molders who actually work in the foundry saw it, we were able to get their input on how specific set ups would work for them.  I can also see its value for training employees.  
<P>
"Traditionally, we would use plans and flow diagrams to explain what we were doing.  Simulation enables us to show them. If a picture says a thousand words, then real-time simulation says a million."
<P>
<H3>Technology and Teamwork Mean New Life for An Old Industry</H3> 
Using virtual reality technology, the government and private sector CERP team has demonstrated the usefulness of virtual reality modelling in design.  QUEST is helping in the design of a flexible and relevant pilot foundry that will help the industry find new, low environmental impact ways of doing business.  The simulations have proven to be a valuable design tool, as well as a communication and visualization tool to help make the project "come to life" prior to construction.

<H4><B><I>The special engineering demands of seagoing vessels require an
interactive 3d graphics tool for visualizing CAD designs and simulating
ship motion and its effect on operating machinery and human workers
with support facilities for verifying a design and allowing design changes
to be made in an interactive manner.</H4></B></I>
<P>
The Directorate of Future Projects (Naval), DFP(N), in the United Kingdom has been looking closely at the use of dynamic 3D CAD tools to assist in the design and development of new ships for the Royal Navy. The special demands of seagoing vessels result in a set of unique requirements for such tools. Such a tool should provide interactive 3D graphics for visualizing CAD designs, be able to simulate ship motion and its effect on operating machinery and human workers, and simulate the lighting conditions of ship compartments. Additionally, the tool should support facilities for verifying a design and to allow design changes to be made in an interactive manner.
<P>
To assess the current state-of-the- art, DFP(N) commissioned Systems Engineering and Assessment Ltd. (SEA) to review the market and recommend a tool for evaluation. ENVISION was selected on the strength of its interactive graphics, dynamics, and human figure modelling capabilities.
<P>
A study was chosen as a test bed for the ENVISION software, examining the feasibility of deploying and recovering a large towed body from the quarterdeck of a Frigate.
<P>
The quarterdeck area resides at the rear of the ship, just underneath the helicopter landing deck. The area is comparatively small, with restricted headroom, making it difficult to accommodate large pieces of machinery.
<P>
<H3>CAD Modeling</H3>
The first step in creating the simulation was to use ENVISION to prepare an accurate 3D CAD model of the quarter- deck. The geometry of the compartments was already captured by GODDESS, a software suite used by the Ministry of Defense for surface ship and submar- ine analysis. A wire frame model of the quarterdeck compartments was exported from GODDESS as an IGES file and imported straight into the ENVISION system.
<P>
The CAD tools of ENVISION were used to create all of the surfaces and objects within the quarter- deck from a set of ship drawings. Doors and hatches were given kinematic properties so they could be opened interactively. The ENVISION analysis tools were used to verify the geometry using point-to-point and angular measurements. 
<P>
<H3>Motion Simulation</H3>
Next it was required to simulate ship motion. The motion axes of the ship were defined as six parts, each representing one motion axis. The axes in this case were displacements in x, y, and z and yaw, pitch, and roll. The kinematics of the ship motion were verified by moving each axis and observing the effect on the quarterdecks position and orientation.
<P>
The center of motion for the axes was chosen to coincide with the position of an accelerometer that was used to measure ship motion during a sea trial. The trial recorded the x, y, z accelerations and the pitch and roll of the ship as a time history, sampled every tenth of a second. A modification to a motion planner in Denebs' shared library allowed ENVISION to read the recorded trial data from disc and drive the ship motion axes, thereby recreating the ship motion of the quarterdeck. It was particularly useful in this case to attach the camera viewpoint to the ship rather than the ground.
<P>
The motion was validated by using the chart facility to plot graphs of the motion and comparing them with graphs of the same data produced from a spreadsheet. When running the simulation in forward dynamics mode, the doors and hatches (unsecured!) would swing open and shut due to the ship motion. ENVISION can output the position of a swinging door with respect to time as an ASCII data file. This data was used to validate the accuracy of the dynamic simulation against the predictions of a mathematical model.
<P>
At this stage a simple lighting scheme was devised to simulate nighttime red-lighting conditions and to show the effect of moving two bright spotlights around for illuminating the work areas.
<P>
The model was now ready to accept the handling equipment. These were added directly to the quarterdeck model so that any interference with the existing equipment could be checked. 
<P>
<H3>Sequencing of Operations</H3>
To control the sequence of operations of the handling equipment, a simple program was written using ENVISION's GSL language to perform the deployment and recovery sequence. The sequence was run once with no simulation of ship motion and again under moderate sea state conditions, while recording the forces exerted by the equipment pistons. In this way the effects of ship motion on the operation of handling equipment could be analyzed.
<P>
Finally, the modelling of dynamic human workers was investigated. In the simulation, two workers were program- med, one to hold tightly onto a ladder and the other to perform a walk around the quarterdeck area. To get the workers to respond to the effects of ship motion, GSL code was used to modify dynamically the posture of the workers according to the ship motion. 
<P>
This evaluation has shown that the ENVISION software provides a basis for a general simulation-based design tool for Naval applications.

ENVISION was used to show the stance of the workers when undergoing a particularly rough sea motion.

<center><H1>About Oregon Sea Grant</H1>
<IMG SRC="graphics/cologo.gif" ALT="Oregon Sea Grant">
<img src="graphics/bluemarb.gif" alt="------------------"></center>
<P>Based since 1968 at <A HREF="http://www.orst.edu">Oregon State
University</A>, Oregon Sea Grant has spent the past quarter century
furthering knowledge of the marine and coastal environments of the
Pacific Northwest, and the forces - natural and human - that shape
their destiny. From that knowledge, it is hoped, will come better
understanding of the complex biologic, geologic, social and economic
forces that shape the region, and better stewardship of its resources.
<HR>
<H2>Oregon Sea Grant is:</H2>
<UL>
<LI>A network of <A HREF="research.html">researchers,</A>  doing 
top-quality science to probe basic questions about ocean and 
coastal life and processes.</LI>
<LI>A coast-long network of <A HREF="extension.html">extension</A> agents
and  specialists who bring the results of that research to the people and communities who can put it to work.
</LI>
<LI>A network of <A HREF="comm.html">communicators</A>, using audio, video, 
print and new technologies to inform people about marine and coastal 
issues.</LI>
</UL>

<P>Oregon Sea Grant is headquartered at the OSU campus in Corvallis, but
its people also work up and down the coast and along the Columbia River,
from county offices of the <A HREF="http://www.oes.orst.edu">OSU Extension
Service</A>, at the <a href="http://www.hmsc.orst.edu">Mark. O. Hatfield
Marine Science Center</a> in Newport and at the <a 
href="http://www.ORST.EDU/dept/seafood/">OSU Seafood Lab</a> in Astoria. 

<P>Oregon Sea Grant also works closely its citizen <a
href="council.html">Advisory Council</a> and with other public agencies
and nongovernmental organizations to help bring greater knowledge to all
levels of ocean and coastal policy-making.

<p>Access to Internet services is expanding rapidly among Oregon's 
coastal communities. Local governments, businesses, non-profits and 
individuals are discovering how the World Wide Web and other on-line 
resources can help bridge geographic distance and build stronger communities.
<p>Here's a sample of the many on-line resources related to coastal 
communities and issues. We welcome your suggestions for more - email us

<BODY BGCOLOR="#00FFFF"><H1>Request for Proposals Delayed until 1997</H1>
<IMG SRC="../graphics/bluemarb.gif" ALT="separator bar">
<P>For the past several years, Oregon Sea Grant has solicited, reviewed 
and funded research proposals on a biennial cycle. Historically, we have
solicited preproposals in January or February of even-numbered years,
with funding beginning on Aug. 1 of odd-numbered years.
<p>We have been informed by the <a
href="http://www.mdsg.umd.edu/NSGO/index.html">National Sea Grant
Office</a> that our funding start date will change to March 1, effective
in 1997.
<p><strong>In order to adjust to the new funding cycle, we will not 
initiate new
research projects until March 1, 1998. We expect our next call for
proposals to be released in February of 1997.</strong>
<p>In the interim, <a href="../research.html">researchers with 
currently-funded projects</a>  have been
invited to submit competitive proposals for possible seven-month
continuation of their Sea Grant support, through March 1998. 
<p>Researchers who would like to be added to the mailing list to receive
the 1997 Request for Proposals may do so by email message to <a

<h2>January 1996 Directory</h2>
<img src="../graphics/bluemarb.gif" alt="------------------"> <P></P>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<hr>
<p> This is the electronic version of the biennial catalog of
publications funded by <a href="../osg.html">Oregon Sea Grant.</a>  
Entries are arranged by subject and listed in order of publication date. 

<p> Copies of most of the publications in this directory are kept in the 
National Sea Grant Depository. Should a publication go out of print, a 
copy of it may be obtained on loan from:

<p><a href="http://nsgd.gso.uri.edu/">The National Sea Grant 
Depository</a><br> Pell Library Building<br>
University of Rhode Island<br> 
Bay Campus, Narragansett, RI 02882.</address>

<p><em>The National Depository offers limited ability to search 
electronically for publications produced by Sea Grant programs across the 
country. A more detailed search engine is in the works.</em>

<p>For this electronic 
edition, we have provided an <A HREF=
"orderform.html">order form</A> which you may print out and use to order
publications from this catalog. We hope to set up an all-electronic
ordering system in the future.

<p>Some Sea Grant-sponsored publications are available through Oregon 
State University's Agricultural and Extension Communications Office, 
which also has an <a 
href="http://wwwagcomm.ads.orst.edu/AgComWebFile/EdMat/EdMatIndex.html">on-line catalog.</a>

<p><em>Note:</em> During the summer of 1992 the Industrial Arts building
which housed the print shop at Oregon State University was destroyed by a
fire. Most of Sea Grant's publications were stored in that building and
were lost. As a result, most Oregon Sea Grant publications prior to 
July 1992 are out of print. Copies may, however, be available from the 
National Depository.

Oregon Sea Grant is the conduit for 
<A HREF="http://www.noaa.gov">National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration</A> research grants, awarded competitively each 
biennium by the <a 
href="http://www.mdsg.umd.edu/NSGO/NationalSeaGrant.html">National Sea 
Grant College Program</a> after review by 
panels of scientists and coastal citizens. Additional funding
comes from the Oregon Legislature and other public and private sources.
<p>In 1995-97, research projects focus on:
<ul>
<li><A href="/research/atc.html">Fishing families, businesses,
 communities and regions</a></li>
<li><a href="/research/biotech.html">Biotechnology</a></li>

industry, ocean and coastal managers and the general public. 

<p>If you're looking for a researcher with expertise in a particular
field, Oregon State University offers a <a

<P>Extension is the outreach arm of Oregon Sea Grant. A team of marine
agents based in Oregon's coastal counties and specialists stationed at
Oregon State University and on the coast, delivers advice, assistance and
informal education to coastal people, businesses and communities as local
needs and issues arise. 

<P>Agents and specialists alike also focus on broader national and
global issues, from seismic hazards to declining fisheries. Many of them
conduct their own research projects, or work with other Sea Grant
<A HREF="research.html">researchers</A>. They often bring together others

<P><EM>... a quarterly newsletter about salmon, coastal
watersheds and people in Oregon and the Pacific
Northwest.</EM></P><BLOCKQUOTE>"During the past decade, residents
of the Northwest, the Oregon coast included, have been caught up
in a turmoil over the condition and the management of natural
resources. The condition of the resources of the coastal region,
from the mountains to the sea, has changed considerably in recent
years. Concern for those land and water resources has changed
also. Much public attention is now being directed to them,
particularly to the old-growth forests and the species that
inhabit them. Various agencies of local, state and federal
governments, as well as private organizations, are rapidly
developing new programs in an effort to restore damaged
landscapes and depleted populations of wildlife and fish,
especially the once-numerous salmon of our coast"</BLOCKQUOTE>

<h3><a name="about">About the Conference</a></h3>
<p>Coastal and marine activities based on resources continue to be a 
major growth sector in international tourism.
<p>In 1990, the first Congress on Coastal and Marine Tourism (CMT90) set 
out to examine the opportunities and challenges posed by this emerging 
sector of the industry. CMT90 brought together more than 250 participants 
from 31 nations and territories to consider the nature of tourism in the 
coastal zone. Business and government representatives, community leaders, 
and scientists agreed that successful, sustainable tourism must be a 
careful blend of integrated planning and development, with collaboration 
among communities, resource managers, industry, education, and 
not-for-profit organizations.
<p>How far have we come since 1990? The 1996 Congress will bring together 
the same diverse interests to discuss, debate, and create solutions and 
strategies for sustainable tourism development in coastal locales.
<p>(Some sessions will be jointly presented by <a href="#pacon">PACON 
96</A>). <hr>
<p><strong>The program</strong>:
<p>All participants will be asked to share their experiences 
in managing and developing coastal and marine tourism. 
Presentations and discussions will focus on:
<ul><li><strong>Stories</strong> (or case studies) about experiences 
good, bad or ugly;</li>
<li><strong>Ideas, concepts or strategies</strong> that can be shared</li>
<li>Management and development <strong>tools</strong>, such as manuals, 
technology, assessments and models</li>
<li>How <strong>people and places</strong> are affected or can produce 
successful, manageable and marketable tourism</li></ul>
<h4>Technical sessions</h4>
<p>Technical sessions are expected to examine what is meant by 
sustainable development and how to achieve it. Areas of 
discussion may include, but are not limited to:
<ul><li>industry and community policy</li>
<li>Local or bottom-up management</li>
<li>Fisheries</li>
<li>Integrated management and planning</li>
<li>Carrying capacity</li>
<li>Water quality</li>
<li>Education and interpretive programs</li>
</ul>
<p>A tentative conference program has been developed and may be seen <a 
href="cmt/cmtprog.html">here.</a>
<p>Some sessions ill be cosponsored by PACON96 and will 
focus on technology and facility design, waterfront 
development, marine resources and coastal erosion and 
protection.
<h4>Exhibits</h4>
<p>An exhibition will be held in conjunction with the technical program.
The exhibition area is immediately adjacent to the meeting rooms and
will be designed to encourage maximum exposure to attendees. The
exhibition booth fee is $1,500 for an 8 ft x 10ft space, assigned on a
first-come, first-served basis. Booths can be shared by more than one
exhibitor. Contact the conference organizers for more information.

96</A> - A Concurrent Opportunity</h3>
PACON 96 will be held June 17-22 in Honolulu, and is expected to draw
more than 600 participants from 32 countries. PACON's 96 theme is
<em>Solutions for the Pacific Century</em>, and the program will include
session topics such as ocean remote sensing, ocean acoustic systems,
chemical oceanography, undersea vehicles and robotics, ocean sea level
variability and hurricane and storm surges.
<p>PACON International is an organization of marine scientists,
engineers and policy makers dedicated to sharing state-of-the-art marine
science and technology and the appropriate applications of this
technology. The principal goal is to provide information to delegates
from all participating nations to promote the environmentally sound use
of ocean resources, and to emphasize through education and public
programs the need for sound ocean policies.

<h1 align=center>Why We're Here</h1>

<center><p>
<hr></p></center>

<p><font SIZE=+1>The National Sea Grant Program exists to encourage the
wise stewardship of our marine resources through research, education, outreach
and technology transfer.</font></p>

<p>In keeping with that mission, Sea Grant programs across the nation are
exploring new information technologies -- such as the World Wide Web --
in an effort to reach new audiences while providing better service to those
they traditionally serve.</p>

<p>These Coastal Recreation and Tourism pages are a joint effort by Sea
Grant programs nationwide to pool their resources into a &quot;one-stop
shopping center&quot; for information and expertise on marine recreation
and related subjects, from requirements of the Clean Vessel Act to research
on Zebra mussels and other exotic species.</p>

<p>Our objectives are to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Give Sea Grant specialists across the country quick access to information
that can enhance their professional collaboration and assist them in serving
coastal clientele </li>

<li>Provide rapid access to Sea Grant information for those coastal clientele
who are on line</li>

<li>Demonstrate the utility of the World Wide Web as an information-delivery
tool to a variety of interested government agencies, businesses and communities</li>

<li>Provide marine-related businesses with examples of how others are using
this medium to disseminate information and conduct commerce</li>
</ul>

<p>The Coastal Recreation and Tourism pages grew out of a two-year Sea
Grant Marine Advisory Service project known as <a href="mnet.html">MarinaNet.</a>
Although the MarinaNet project has a finite life, it is anticipated that
these pages will continue to grow and evolve to meet the needs of coastal
and Great Lakes residents, businesses and visitors.</p>

<p><font SIZE=+2>How well are we meeting our objectives? </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>Send your comments, questions and suggestions to the webmaster
at: <a href="mailto:kightp@seagrant.orst.edu">kightp@seagrant.orst.edu</a></font></p>

audiences, the guide offers practical advice for marina operators 
everywhere.</ul>

<h3><a href="http://www.mdsg.umd.edu/NSGO/SeaGrantResults/V1N2.html#1">Oil
Recycling at Marinas</a></h3>

<ul>
<p>A Washington Sea Grant demonstration project has opened a new market
for the oil recycling industry. The project, which benefits both business
and the environment, addresses the problem of used oil filters discarded
at marinas. Read how <a href="http://www.wsg.washington.edu/">Washington
Sea Grant</a> brought together a marina director and the recycling industry
- which already was collecting and recycling oil and oil filters from land
activities - to participate in a pilot project. </p>

<h3><a href="http://www.wsg.washington.edu/research/oilspill_prevention.html">Marine
Oil Spill Prevention Education Project</a> </h3>

<ul>
<p>Small oil spills are a fact of life in the Puget Sound Basin. While
small oil spills may seem innocuous, they usually contain highly toxic
refined or waste oil products and are discharged into our shallow, fertile
near-shore waters. <a href="http://www.wsg.washington.edu/">Washington
Sea Grant</a> is developing a voluntary spill prevention program involving
commercial fishing vessels, ferries, small pleasure craft, cruise ships,
ports and marinas.</p>

publication, <a href="newpub.html"><em>Clean Marinas-Clear 
Value</em></a>, for EPA</h3>
<ul>
<p>Twenty-three marinas and two large marina chains across America have 
made a wide variety
of environmental improvements to their operations which resulted 
in benefits to their business. 

Their stories, each with different approaches to common marina 
pollution control problems,
were written by national marina expert (and former Rhode Island Sea 
Grant staffer) Neil Ross 
under contract to the EPA.

<h3><a href="http://www.mdsg.umd.edu/../MDSG/Extension/RecBoat.html">Recreational
Boating Provides $1.01 billion impact in Maryland</a></h3>

<p>by Ben Sherman National Sea Grant Media Relations </p>

<ul>
<p>Maryland recreational boating expenditures total $1.01 billion annually,
providing a net economic boost of over $980 million annually to the State
of Maryland according to the results of a <a href="http://www.mdsg.umd.edu/MDSG/index.html">Maryland
Sea Grant</a> study released in Annapolis at the 17th Annual Maryland Marine
Trades Conference. Coordinated by <a href="masstaff.html#lipton">Douglas
W. Lipton</a>, Director of the University of Maryland Sea Grant College
Extension Program, the report finds that, on average, boaters of all classes
each contribute $5,136 annually to the state economic output. Those expenditures
generate over 18,000 full-time equivalent jobs in the Maryland economy,
and 34 percent of the expenditures result in actual wage payments and compensation
to Maryland residents.</p>

M. Liffman and Marilyn Barrett. 1995. Laws give ports, marinas, and terminals
responsibility for protecting the marine environment which is critical
to each facility's livelihood by offering vessels various acceptable disposal
options. Each port or marina will implement the marine debris laws differently,
but these laws assign all ports, terminals, and marinas the responsibility
for providing adequate waste reception for vessels. Port, terminal, and
marina managers are required to develop and implement a waste management
plan. This book is intended to help with one portion of that plan: recycling.

Spencer Rogers 1991. Trade Only Soundings. May 1991, p. 33. Public concern
for environmental issues is at an all-time high, and marinas have a public
image problem. The public looks at a marina full of boats and assumes it
is the source of sewage pollution in the surrounding waters. Marinas could
improve their public image by installing and providing free pumpouts for
boat waste. NCU-R-91-030.</P>

</A></I>Neil W. Ross. 1985. Docks and Marinas 12th National Technical Conference:
Madison, Wisconsin, October 1985. Various berthing options are compared
with respect to finger width, fairway, boats per acre, and thus slip efficiency.
While real marinas are a mixture of boat and slip sizes, it is possible
to increase slip capacity in existing docking areas with some sacrifice
of convenience. By eliminating fingers, there are significant savings in
capital costs, maintenance, and taxes. Increased space efficiency could
translate into improved business profits, reduced growth of slip rental
rates, and, most important, more access for new boaters. RIU-R-85-006.</P>

Many proposed marinas are planned near waters used for harvesting oysters,
clams and other shellfish. Prospective marina operators must ensure specific
water quality standards will be met before they can obtain a permit. Predicting
that a certain marina design will satisfy these standards is difficult;
many factors must be taken into account. In 1985, researchers from North
and South Carolina studied two marinas for six days over the Labor Day
holiday to document the relationship between boat use and water quality
during a period of peak boat use. NCU-T-87-001. 46 pages. </P>

Dowd and T.M. Leschine, 1989. Containerization, the movement of cargo in
containers, is a dynamic system within which the players (carriers, terminal
operators, stevedores, labor, port authorities, shippers, railroads, truckers,
government, and others) all interact. Each exerts influence over productivity
at a specific terminal or within the entire system.Whenever someone looks
at the containerization system, there is an assumption that if the terminal
works at its maximum efficiency, then the entire system benefits. However,
maximizing terminal efficiency might only shift the bottlenecks to some
other element within the system. This paper provides a perspective on container
terminal productivity--how it measured, the validity of the measurements
used, and the factors that affect the elements of productivity. WASHU-G-89-005

and its ancestors serviced Little Sarasota Bay on the west-central coast
of Florida for at least the past century. The now defunct pass moved through
stages of stability and instability with the demise of the pass being related
to the dredging associated with the Intracoastal Waterway. The broad spectrum
of changes that have taken place in this inlet are the result of a complex
combination of natural and human-related events and activities. It is the
purpose of this report to chronicle and interpret the sequence of these
changes in order to serve as an example of (1) how water circulation in
adjacent bays impacts on inlet behavior; and (2) how human-related changes
in adjacent water bodies influence circulation which in turn impacts inlets.

Draft User Fees</A></I>. Jenny Nyberg, Jerry Fruin and Dan Halbach, 1989.
Major policy debates in the early 1980s focused on U.S. ports and their
adequacy to meet the nation's present and future needs. After five years
of debate Congress passed the Waterway Resources Act of 1986, which established
an .04% ad valorem tax on all cargo passing through the port system. This
policy change to user fees to help share the costs of operation and maintenance
of U.S. harbors and navigable channels is a highly debated and controversial
issue. The export user fee scheme enacted by Congress is a compromise resulting
in a user fee scheme which can neither meet complete cost recovery nor
economic efficiency. Issues such as port location, capacity and the timing
of deeper draft ports are too important to be left completely to market
forces. A national policy on port development is still required.MINNU-T-89-002

thereby eliminating the need for port administrators to leave their office

Waterfronts</I> Marc J. Hershman (editor), 1988. This book tells two stories:
the story of an important and highly visible public resource, and the tale
of an obscure but influential governmental institution. The resource is
the urban harbor and waterfront, a recently rediscovered asset of the millions
of people in cities and towns that front on rivers, lakes, bays, estuaries,
and oceans in the United States. The governmental institution is the public
port agency, a semiautonomous landlord and public relations agent that
quietly builds docks or moves cargo or moors boats, acting as overseer
of the waterfront. Ultimately this book asks how the institution affects
the resource, and how the public port contributes to the stewardship of
the urban harbor. WASHU-B-88-003 (WSG-MR 88-2); 354 pp. Paper backs $27.50,

a long-range effort called the '2020 Plan.' This article offers background

Bottomland (Underwater) Preserve Communities Using the Nominal Group Technique.</A></I>
Kenneth J. Vrana. Seven Michigan underwater preserve committees were assisted
by a facilitator in producing a comprehensive list of facilities, services,
or other resources that may be beneficial in developing their preserve
areas into aquatic parks. The committees then identified the most important
facilities, services, or resources needed for aquatic park development,
a preferred management framework, and a preferred means of funding this
development and management. Results are based in social science theory
and method in group decision making. 58 pp. MICHU-SG-93-201 $10.00 </P>

1991. Twenty years ago, some far-seeing citizens of Washington State drafted
an initiative to protect and manage the State's shorelines. The public-spirited
efforts of those citizens, the responsiveness of their Legislature, and
the leadership of their governor resulted in one of the nation's pioneering
shoreline management programs. Participants in the Shorelines Management
Symposium had the opportunity to learn about and assess what had been achieved
under the Shoreline Management Act. They also looked ahead to the challenges
the state's shoreline managers will face over the next 20 years, and considered
whether or not the 20-year-old Shoreline Management Act will be sufficient
to meet them. Specific paper titles available through the NSGD search.
