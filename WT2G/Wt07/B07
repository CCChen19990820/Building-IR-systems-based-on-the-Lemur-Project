International Financing Review, one of the leading and most prestigious financing 
publications, has selected Goldman Sachs as its "Bank of the Year" for 1996.  The following 
is the complete article, as it appeared in IFR, naming Goldman Sachs "Bank of the Year":
</EM>

<P><HR>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1 COLOR="#330099"><STRONG>Back in business</STRONG></FONT><BR>

Two years ago, Goldman Sachs posted one of the worst results in its 127-year history. 
Since then, it has re-emphasised its client focus, restructured its senior management and 
rounded out its business mix. 
<IMG VSPACE=5 HSPACE=5  ALIGN=RIGHT BORDER=0 ALT="IFR Review of the Year" SRC="/images/ifr.gif" WIDTH=119 HEIGHT=75>
With 1996 pre-tax profits of US$2.6bn the second highest 
ever, Goldman, IFR's Bank of the Year, can truly claim to have recaptured its place at 
the pinnacle of global investment banking. 

<P>
Global is a 1980s word. Numerous financial institutions a decade ago were chanting it as 
though it were a mantra. Now the silence is only broken by a few survivors able to claim 
that they really do run a competitive full-service investment banking operation around the 
world. Goldman Sachs is one of them. 

<P>
"The strategy of global diversification of our businesses has allowed us to capture very 
attractive revenue streams," said Jon Corzine, chairman and senior partner of Goldman 
Sachs. Corzine was appointed to the position late in 1994, along with vice- chairman and 
chief operating officer Henry "Hank" Paulson. 

<P>
Goldman's 1996 profits of US$2.6bn came off revenues of US$6.14bn. This is second by 
a whisker to the firm's record year in 1993, when it made pre-tax profits of US$2.7bn. But 
the real story lies between these two figures. In 1994, the firm's profits collapsed to 
US$508m after big trading hits, especially in proprietary fixed income. Following the 
appointment of Corzine and Paulson in the autumn, Goldman pulled itself together and 
bounced back to make US$1.37bn pre-tax in 1995. It nearly doubled this in 1996. 

<P>
But despite its global reach, the balance of Goldman's earnings remains heavily in the 
favour of the States. About 25% of its profits, revenues and assets are booked outside 
the US. Senior executives at the firm dispute claims from rivals of a more balanced 
geographical mix of earnings, citing the huge fees available from the mergers and 
acquisitions business, as well as the preservation of margins in securities underwriting, 
this year. 

<P>
Equity capital totalled approximately US$5.25bn as of November 30 1996, while long-
term debt was running at US$13.97bn at mid-year.  Although assets are estimated to be 
running at around US$150bn, John Thain, chief financial officer, said that the firm runs a 
much larger matched book. Senior Goldman executives say this indicates the extent to 
which they have focused on client-driven business. "We have had a very good year with 
substantially less risk," said Thain. 

<P>
Three years ago, assets ballooned and risk was at an all-time high. "We did run very 
substantial risk positions in both the fixed income and currency markets in 1993. Today, 
our risk is far less than it was then," said Thain. 

<P>
With the increased profitability, diversity of earnings and reduced risk profile, the 
pressure on Goldman to go public to boost its capital base has reduced and the firm 
remains the only independent world-class global investment bank. 

<P>
Goldman has repeatedly turned down the opportunity to be part of the stock market, 
although at times it has been close. In 1986, the partners, including current chairman Jon 
Corzine, even voted in favour of going public. It has been discussed since, most recently 
in January this year, but with the firm's impressive profits in 1996, it now seems unlikely 
that the partnership structure will be dissolved this century. 

<P>
Outside partners own approximately 20% of the firm, with notably Sumitomo Bank and 
Kamehameha Schools/Bernice Pauahi Bishop Estate, a Hawaiian trust, both injecting 
US$500m into Goldman Sachs during the last decade. 

<P>
"We're absolutely committed in the near to intermediate term to the current structure," 
said Corzine. "The partnership has a number of advantages. Looking back, it is hard to 
find things that we haven't been able to do because of a lack of capital," said Paulson. 

<P>
Certainly, Goldman's trading operation has not suffered in 1996 through capital 
constraints. According to a raft of partners interviewed by IFR, profits have been 
impressive in their sheer diversity. In fixed income, for example, 15 out of the 16 
businesses made money on an after-tax basis. The equity operation posted record 
profits, while in M&A, Goldman had its best year ever. It has also developed new 
business lines, such as syndicated bank lending and secondary loan trading. 

<P>
The prospects for its investment banking businesses have never looked better and only 
a large failed acquisition or a major correction in the US stock market appears likely to 
derail the M&A bull market that has been such an important element of Goldman's 
revived profitability. M&A volume has increased from US$360bn in 1991 to US$790bn in 
1996 to end-November. 

<P>
At the end of November 1996, Goldman was the world's number one adviser on 
completed deals, with 193 transactions, of which 35 were for over US$1bn and 147 for 
over US$100m. Even so, the firm makes a great play of placing quality of business over 
league table or volume considerations. 

<P>
"We have a business principle which says, 'given the choice of being the biggest or the 
best, we'll be the best,'" said Steven "Mac" Heller, head of M&A at Goldman. 

<P>
The growth of the market is supported by up to US$50bn of uninvested leveraged buy-out
equity which, if leveraged by 5:1, would create a warchest of US$250bn. LBO funds 
are arguably the single largest source of revenues for the Wall Street firms, and are 
among the biggest users of investment banking services. When combined with strong 
debt and equity markets, world-wide deregulation and the "de-stigmatisation" of the 
unsolicited, or hostile, bid, the future looks rosy round the globe. 

<P>
As multinationals increasingly view the world as one market, so firms like Goldman - with 
relationships with two-thirds of the Fortune 100 - are driven to make the same 
commitment if they are to provide a one-stop shopping environment for customers. 
Nothing speaks louder for the way Goldman manages to seamlessly integrate its 
businesses world-wide, than the Royal Ahold acquisition of The Stop and Shop 
Companies Inc in July. 

<P>
Besides advising the Dutch company on the acquisition, Goldman also arranged a 
US$1.1bn syndicated bank facility and ran the books on the US$1.8bn global equity 
offering. "To us, being global is 'mission critical,'" said Heller. 

<P>
The US$1.8bn Ahold deal was the largest non-privatisation issue ever to emerge from 
the Netherlands. Having put the deal away, Goldman was back within a week with Merrill 
Lynch at the helm of Volvo's secondary offering in Pharmacia & Upjohn. The offering 
raised US$1.84bn during turbulent market conditions. Around 65% of the deal went to 
the US, with a dual listing in Stockholm and New York. 

<P>
But in a way the highlight of the equity calendar had to be Deutsche Telekom. The 
DM17.5bn privatisation was more than just an equity issue, it was an attempt to change 
the buying mentality of the German public. The prestige of this business is inestimable 
and for Paulson, the call he received confirming Goldman's mandate as joint global co-
ordinator on the Friday after Thanksgiving Day in 1994 was the highlight of his time in 
office. 

<P>
"The deal was an illustration of the art of the possible. It has set new standards of what is 
achievable," said Michael Evans, European head of equity capital markets. 

<P>
The DM17.5bn IPO generated DM120bn worth of demand. In a country which lacked an 
equity investment culture, the marketing process and package of incentives generated 
orders amounting to five times the domestic tranche. Around 65% of the deal was finally 
placed in the home market, with the largest non-German placement being into the US. 

<P>
Other significant international transactions include the US$313m initial public offering for 
AsiaSat, which was almost 25 times subscribed for the international offering and over 
100 times in Hong Kong, and Korea Mobile Telecommunications' US$337.9m ADR 
offering, the first Korean company to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. 

<P>
In the US, Goldman Sachs had a phenomenal year - jointly leading the US$3bn initial 
public offering for Lucent Technologies (the biggest IPO in history and IFR's US Equity 
Deal of the Year), as well as leading the second largest US IPO this year, from 
Associates First Capital. In early May, Goldman introduced a Ford affiliate, Associates 
First Capital, to investors in a jumbo IPO that raised just short of US$2bn at its issue. 

<P>
The firm also played a leading role in bringing new issues from the retail sector, most 
notably the IPO and subsequent secondary offering from Saks Holding. In May, 
Goldman led a US$400m IPO for the parent company of luxury retailer Saks Fifth 
Avenue. After pricing at the top of its upwardly revised range, investor froth pushed up 
Saks' share value by nearly 36% at its debut. 

<P>
Early in October, Goldman further demonstrated its equity muscle when it raised 
approximately US$2bn in one week, including a US$1.02bn offering for Gulfstream 
Aerospace and a US$545m offering for Sabre Group, distinguishing itself as the only firm 
to lead two US$500m-plus new equity issues in one week. 

<P>
The firm's autumn line-up, recognised by several of its rivals to be the strongest on Wall 
Street, continued to pack a strong punch all the way through year-end. In the third week 
of November, the firm raised US$2.1bn in proceeds from just six deals, helping to push a 
new record in equity issuance in terms of proceeds to US$5.53bn. 

<P>
In the convertible arena, Goldman displayed its innovation with the US$2.12bn 
exchangeable offering for the Republic of Italy, convertible into shares of Italian 
insurance company, INA. Dubbed "PENs", the instrument represented the first equity-
linked privatisation for a G7 country. In Japan, Goldman acted as joint global co-
ordinator with Nomura Securities on the US$2.05bn privatisation of Japan Tobacco, and 
snared the mandate for a Y200bn mandatory convertible for Sumitomo Bank. 

<P>
But the equity new issue business is no more significant for Goldman than the visible tip 
of an iceberg. "Underwriting is responsible for only 15-20% of our revenues (in equities), 
even in a good year," said Roy Zuckerberg, head of equities and Goldman's longest-
serving partner. 

<P>
During the 1990s, the equity division has been concentrating on spreading its business 
internationally and the proportion of business derived from selling non-US product or US 
product outside the States has increased from about a third to half. 

<P>
The core areas for the equity business - derivatives, convertibles, secondary trading and 
private banking - provide the bulk of the revenues, but the business is diverse and 
includes other areas of fee income, such as stock lending. "Fees are a desirable form of 
income, but no more desirable than any other form of income," said Zuckerberg. 

<P>
While the firm's revenue stream from its US business is fairly predictable, it finds it 
harder to budget for the less mature international share markets. Equities was not 
immune from the bath that Goldman took in 1994, which was widely attributed to the US 
fixed income operation. "While we were not as affected as other divisions, we came 
down fairly dramatically from our 1993 levels of earnings," said David Silfen, co-head of 
equities with Zuckerberg, until he retired recently. 

<P>
The most significant management changes that have been made in the division this year 
were the appointments of two chief operating officers: Pat Ward in London and Bob Steel 
in New York. 

<P>
The fixed income division is run by Mortara and Garonzik, two highly-experienced 
professionals. Both accept that the market conditions have been ideally suited to the 
industry this year. "We're not saying that we've found a way to eliminate cyclicality from 
the business. We're a beneficiary also from the rising stock market," said Garonzik. 

<P>
Garonzik and Mortara were appointed in the autumn of 1994, Goldman's nadir. "There 
was some concern that our emphasis on proprietary trading in the early 1990s had 
detracted from our long-term focus on the customer franchise. In the last two years, we 
have made sure that we have achieved a proper balance," said Garonzik. 

<P>
"I'm no stranger to volatility of earnings," said Mortara, who moved to Goldman from 
Salomon Brothers in 1987 as head of mortgage trading. "The difference between 
Goldman and Salomon when I was there is the tremendous focus on customer business 
as well as the proprietary side." 

<P>
"Over the last couple of years, our big franchise has been in negotiated industrial 
financings [in the US]," said Mark Schwartz, head of world-wide debt capital markets. 
Key deals have included a US$3.5bn trade for Lockheed Martin, a US$1.5bn issue for 
Lucent Technologies, a US$800m deal for Levi Strauss, and a US$750m issue for 
Hanson's chemical company spin-off, Millennium. Interestingly, of the four banner deals 
mentioned above that Goldman won, they only had the lead banking relationship in one 
instance. 

<P>
Lockheed Martin was the peach of the crop, combining both behind-the-scenes acumen 
and significant placement power. Following Lockheed's US$9.1bn bid for Loral's defence 
electronics and systems integration businesses in January, the firm lobbied Lockheed to 
allow it to raise the total sum in the commercial paper market before refinancing it with 
long-term debt. This they did, with a hugely successful US$3.5bn six-tranche bond 
offering, but not before they earlier in the year partially hedged the company's interest 
rate exposure through Treasury purchases and paying in the swap market. 

<P>
"Our relationship with Lockheed goes back to the early 1980s," said Robert Hurst, co-
head of investment banking, who worked on the 1996 deal. As well as acting as an M&A 
adviser, Goldman lead-managed the first issue of deep discounted debentures for Martin 
Marietta in 1981. 

<P>
The US$1.5bn issue for Lucent Technologies was used to capitalise the new company 
following the break-up of AT&T into the core telephone company; Lucent Technologies, 
the equipment manufacturing and Bell Laboratories arm; and AT&T Capital, the finance 
arm. Morgan Stanley was lead adviser on the restructuring. 

<P>
In the case of Levi Strauss, the Haas family, which has about a US$12bn stake in the 
company, wanted to buy back the majority of the outstanding stock, and needed to raise 
US$1bn in the market. Goldman raised US$200m through a Y20bn private placement in 
Japan with an insurance company, while the remaining US$800m was sold under Rule 
144a in the US market. 

<P>
All of the companies mentioned are rated Triple B, the hot area of the fixed income 
markets in 1996, as investors have been looking to pick-up yield by going out along the 
credit curve. The move has been particularly obvious in the US, where large investment 
managers and mutual funds have been shifting out of the Treasury and mortgage 
markets for the added returns available in the asset-backed securities and corporate 
sectors. 

<P>
The high-yield theme continues in Latin America, where Goldman had a banner year, the 
highlight of which was probably the 30-year global that resulted from the US$1.75bn of 
Brady bonds Mexico accepted at the tender of those securities in May. The deal was key 
in that it freed up collateral on the Bradys, which Mexico then used to pay down short-
term debt. 

<P>
A key emphasis for the firm in 1996 has been on lengthening the maturities on bonds for 
Latin credits, which both extends the liability duration of LatAm borrowers and better fits 
the requirements of the sophisticated US institutional investor base. While Latin America 
is already a focus for the firm, it has been weak in Eastern Europe, an area in which it 
intends to increasingly focus attention. 

<P>
"Our capacity to relate to the emerging markets is important not only for the business 
generated there, but because of the perspective we can bring to companies in developed 
countries," said Peter Sutherland, chairman of the European business, whose first 
encounter with Goldman was a chance conversation on an airplane with Gene Fife, his 
immediate predecessor. 

<P>
In the international bond markets, Goldman has snared a large number of fixed income 
mandates, and has been especially dominant in the global bond market, where it has 
won deals for, among others Canada, the World Bank, Ford Motor Credit, Federal 
National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp 
(Freddie Mac). (See also Global Bond House of the Year article). 

<P>
"On a fully-costed basis, we will have a profitable Eurobond business this year," said 
Michael Sherwood, co-head of capital markets in London. "A lot of people look at it and 
say, 'it's a profile business'; we're well past that stage." 

<P>
Sherwood said that the biggest success of the year has been the balance of business 
across product lines: swaps, government bonds and Eurobonds. 

<P>
Swaps is run in Europe by Tom Montag, government bonds by Mike Rantz and the 
relative value proprietary trading desk by Anthony Williams. Brace Young is now co-head 
of fixed income sales with Mike Zamko, and co-head of capital markets with Sherwood. 

<P>
Like a number of other investment banks, Goldman Sachs has seen its syndicated loan 
business ramp up dramatically, even compared with the steady progress seen over the 
last three years. It is a measure of the group's success that Robert O'Shea, a former 
loan trader who jumped ship from Bear Stearns nearly five years ago to start up the unit, 
was made partner. 

<P>
Goldman's merchant banking activities continued to drive much of its deal volume early 
in 1996, including one of the largest leveraged transactions attempted during the year, a 
complex cross-border leveraged buyout of the AMF bowling business. 

<P>
Conceived as a play on both the recreational activity's business consolidation in the US 
and its growing popularity elsewhere around the globe, the US$1.4bn transaction was a 
true one-stop shopping exercise: Goldman Sachs Capital Partners committed US$383m 
of equity while the institution sold US$400m in Rule 144a bonds and syndicated 
US$815m of senior credit facilities. 

<P>
In one of its major coups of the year, Goldman stole the lead spot on a US$200m 
financing for debt collection firm OSI Holdings, a long-time client of Chase Manhattan. 
Chase and Goldman wound up sharing the administrative agent duties (an investment 
bank first).  Just as importantly, the deal augured a move away from strictly Goldman-
related investments into the lucrative sponsored market. 

<P>
Soon, Goldman had snared deals from other leveraged buyout firms, and formed a 
strong alliance with Blackstone Capital Partners. Goldman is a major investor in Loewen 
Group, the big international funeral services operator, and had co-arranged a financing 
for Loewen earlier in the year with Bank of Montreal. 

<P>
Later, when Loewen and Blackstone's joint acquisition vehicle Prime Succession needed 
US$125m in financing, Goldman got the nod. A follow on transaction for the venture, 
Roses Inc, was also successfully syndicated. 

<P>
Mirroring its original focus as a trading shop, Goldman continued to push its proprietary 
amortisation extended loan (Axel) structured throughout the year. The Axel structure 
offers call protection to institutional loan investors, which some quarters of the market 
have found useful given the continuing cycle of refinancing that has seen the redemption 
of so many high-yielding institutional loan assets. 

<P>
Goldman bankers capped the year on a high point: a US$1.225bn credit facility backing 
the acquisition of Laidlaw's waste management business by a much smaller concern, 
Allied Waste Industries. Goldman, along with co-arrangers Citibank and Credit Suisse, 
brought the deal to market in late October, selling through concerns over the regulatory 
outlook for the solid waste industry and the acquirer's small size relative to the overall 
transaction. 

<P>
Goldman's incursion into traditionally commercial banking areas does not stop at 
syndicated loans. It is also one of the leading participants in the foreign exchange market 
through its J Aron operation, which is also responsible for the firm's commodities 
business. "But this year, the main driver for J Aron has been foreign exchange," said 
Lloyd Blankfein, head of J Aron. 

<P>
Although the firm has a very small number of FX professionals when compared with a 
money centre bank such as Citibank or Chase, there have been a number of key hires in 
the last two years. One of these, late in 1995, was Jim O'Neill from SBC Warburg, one of 
the rare outside hires to be made at full partner level. Another was Goldman's European 
chairman, Peter Sutherland, although to be strictly accurate, both joined and were made 
partner within two months. 

<P>
"I was too much involved in management and I wanted to get back to what I was 
supposedly good at: covering the FX market," said O'Neill.

<P>
Along with O'Neill, Gavyn Davies in London and Thomas Mayer in Frankfurt form the hub 
of a powerful and widely-respected team of economists, enabling Goldman to claim to be 
the best provider of fixed income research. "They genuinely employ top-class research 
people because they want to use them. My impression is that a number of other firms 
tend to use research for public relations," said O'Neill. 

<P>
Although the firm has an enviable client base, its reputation in foreign exchange lies 
more in its proprietary trading operation, which Blankfein said it had a "very good year," 
although he would not elaborate. What is quite clear is that Goldman has done well out 
of the strengthening of the US dollar against the yen, and has also turned good profits 
from convergence plays on European Monetary Union. 

<P>
"Anything to do with convergence we've done well," said O'Neill, who also said that 
Goldman correctly called the recent depreciation of the Swiss franc. 

<P>
"Goldman had a very strong year in foreign exchange trading despite generally low 
currency volatility," said Blankfein. The foreign exchange market generally had its worst 
year in a decade. 

<P>
While foreign exchange trading may have been the prime earner for J Aron in 1996, 
Blankfein said that commodities was also profitable. 

<P>
"Our metals business, in particular, performed very well this year," he said. This was in a 
year which saw a number of upsets in the market, including the huge copper trading loss 
from Sumitomo Corp. Indeed, although it has never been officially confirmed it is widely 
known that Goldman was hired by Sumitomo to unwind its massive positions, which it 
successfully did.

<strong>
As of November 24, 1995
</strong>
</p>

<P>Goldman Sachs became a private partnership in 1882.  As of the end of
the fiscal year 1995, the partnership was composed of 174 general
partners and a number of limited partners.

<P>Under the partnership structure, profits and losses directly affect
the capital holdings of the general partners.  This is reflected in
their approach to daily management and new business ventures.  The
partnership focuses on businesses that offer the highest potential
returns within the context of tightly controlled costs and
conservative risk management.

<P>Most of Goldman Sachs' income is retained in the firm.  This reflects
the partnership's emphasis on building capital to support the firm's
business activities and to allow investment in future growth.

<FONT COLOR="#330099"><H3>From Modest Beginnings to Worldwide Financial Organization</H3></FONT>

<P>If some morning we could step back to Manhattan's financial district
circa 1869, we might see a man in a frock coat and high silk hat
hurrying along the cobblestone streets. This could be Marcus Goldman,
an immigrant from Europe and budding entrepreneur.

<P>Each day, Marcus Goldman made the rounds of local businesses. He
purchased the promissory notes of their customers, providing an
alternative to bank credit, which was expensive and in short
supply. He stuffed the notes in the headband of his hat for
safekeeping and, at midday, sold them to New York's commercial banks.

<P>Of course, Marcus Goldman had no idea that his modest enterprise -
which came to be known as the commercial paper business - would grow
into a worldwide financial organization.  Nor could he have known that
his client-driven approach would thereafter define and guide the firm
he founded.

<FONT COLOR="#330099"><H3>Ventures at Home and Abroad</H3></FONT>

<P>During the remainder of the century, Goldman Sachs built the
commercial paper market into a major source of short-term capital.
Our firm also formed relationships with European banks to provide
clients involved in international commerce with foreign currency
financing, letters of credit and foreign exchange.

<P>America was industrializing rapidly as the 20th century began, and
some fast-growing clients needed large amounts of capital.  In its
earliest public financings, Goldman Sachs added new safeguards and
policies that made offerings of equity and debt securities more
attractive to investors.  Our firm also took a unique approach to
marketing securities, maintaining that the quality of management, not
just physical assets, determine a company's earnings power and that
both should drive investment decisions.  These innovations opened a
vast source of capital and became standard in our industry.

<FONT COLOR="#330099"><H3>Wall Street Leaders</H3></FONT>

<P>Goldman Sachs, like most of Wall Street, experienced difficulties in
the Great Depression.  Led by Sidney Weinberg, who ultimately sat on
the boards of more than 30 corporations and was known as "Mr.  Wall Street," our
firm regained momentum by the end of World War II.

<P>Weinberg was joined in directing our firm by Gustave Levy, an
innovator in the equities markets and head of our securities trading
business.  Their leadership reflected a unique understanding that
issuers and investors were best served by closely coordinated
securities underwriting, marketing and trading operations.

<FONT COLOR="#330099"><H3>Industry Innovations</H3></FONT>

<P>With institutions playing a larger role in the securities markets,
Goldman Sachs was the first to establish a group of professionals
dedicated to serving institutional investors.  Our firm also pioneered
buying and selling large blocks of stock and set the industry standard
for serving private investors.

<P>Corporations required broader financial support as consumer and
industrial markets expanded rapidly in the postwar decades.  In the
1950s, Goldman Sachs formed a separate group to market the firm's full
range of investment banking services and to ensure continuity of
client relationships.  This innovative approach to client service was
also embraced throughout the industry.

<P>In the following two decades, our firm became a leader in developing
the private markets as a source of equity and debt capital.  We set up
Wall Street's first department dedicated to advising companies on
mergers and acquisitions - which were becoming a fundamental
management tool.  We took the initiative in applying investment
banking techniques to commercial real estate, providing market
participants with alternatives for raising and investing capital.
Responding to the needs of municipalities to finance construction of
public facilities for their rapidly increasing populations, we began
underwriting and trading tax-exempt securities.

<FONT COLOR="#330099"><H3>Worldwide Challenges</H3></FONT>

<P>Clients' needs were becoming more international and the world's
financial markets were increasingly interconnected, complex and
volatile.  By the 1970s, the firm faced one of its greatest
challenges: to provide a full complement of services on a worldwide
scale while maintaining a level of performance and dedication to
client interests that accounted for its growth in the U.S.  This would
require a momentous effort that would transform Goldman Sachs into a
global investment banking firm.

<P>It was our view that in this unprecedented environment, clients could
best be served by applying worldwide the teamwork for which we were
known in the U.S.  We set about building a multinational team of
professionals with in-depth knowledge of local and global markets and
expertise in a broad array of specialized financial fields.
     
<FONT COLOR="#330099"><H3>International Mosaic</H3></FONT>

<P>Our first international offices opened in London in 1970 and in
Tokyo and Zurich in 1974. Two decades later, we had 17 offices
outside the U.S.  and had become a mosaic of people from over 90
countries engaged in an increasingly international business.

<P>In place were policies, procedures and a vast technological
infrastructure to quickly focus broad, geographically dispersed
expertise to support client goals.  Globally integrated research
generated information and ideas for planning financial strategies.
Sales and trading professionals provided around-the-clock investment
opportunities in equity, fixed income, currency and commodity markets.
Investment bankers supported financing, merger, real estate and other
objectives worldwide.  Financial innovations expanded opportunities to
raise and invest capital and manage risks.

<P>Most of all, the firm had sustained a culture in which people from
many backgrounds worked harmoniously within the spirit of business
principles that stress client interests and ethical conduct.

<FONT COLOR="#330099"><H3>Striking Connection</H3></FONT>

<P>If Marcus Goldman visited our firm today, he would likely marvel at
the magnitude of change in the company that bears his name.

<P>But perhaps he would also see a striking connection with 1869.
At that time, as a newcomer in the U.S., he was seeking to carve out a
constructive role for himself in the financial markets through
creative initiative, hard work and enthusiastic dedication to clients.

<P>Now, 128 years later, we are a relative newcomer in many parts of
the world.  And we seek to sustain the entrepreneurial spirit that
guided the founder of our firm.

      Our assets are our people, capital and reputation.  If any of
      these is ever diminished, the last is the most difficult to restore.
      We are dedicated to complying fully with the letter and spirit of the
      laws, rules and ethical principles that govern us.  Our continued
      success depends upon unswerving adherence to this standard.

      We take great pride in the professional quality of our work.  We
      have an uncompromising determination to achieve excellence in
      everything we undertake.  Though we may be involved in a wide variety

      be best than biggest.

      We stress creativity and imagination in everything we do.  While
      recognizing that the old way may still be the best way, we constantly
      strive to find a better solution to a client's problems.  We pride
      ourselves on having pioneered many of the practices and techniques
      that have become standard in the industry.

      We make an unusual effort to identify and recruit the very best
      person for every job.  Although our activities are measured in
      billions of dollars, we select our people one by one.  In a service
      business, we know that without the best people, we cannot be the best
      firm.

      We offer our people the opportunity to move ahead more rapidly
      than is possible at most other places.  We have yet to find the limits
      to the responsibility that our best people are able to assume.
      Advancement depends solely on ability, performance and contribution to
      the firm's success, without regard to race, color, religion, sex, age,
      national origin, disability, sexual orientation, or any other
      impermissible criterion or circumstance.

      We stress teamwork in everything we do.  While individual
      creativity is always encouraged, we have found that team effort often
      produces the best results.  We have no room for those who put their
      personal interests ahead of the interests of the firm and its clients.

      We consider our size an asset that we try hard to preserve.  We

      the intimacy and the esprit de corps that we all treasure and that
      contribute greatly to our success.

    <FONT SIZE=+2  COLOR="31639C"><B>Goldman Sachs Asset Management Offers Outstanding International Credentials</B></FONT>
    <BR>
    <BR>
    Goldman Sachs Asset Management and its affiliates have offices in New York, London, Tokyo and Singapore.  The Asset Management Division has established its own presence abroad in a number of key areas:
    <UL>
    <LI><B>Local Investment Expertise.</B>  Our portfolio managers, based in New York, London, Tokyo and Singapore, bring in-depth knowledge of local markets, politics and economic trends &#150 a critical edge in identifying and monitoring investment opportunities. They meet with company management and conduct analysis that goes far beyond the resources available to most U.S. investors.
    <BR>
    <BR>
    <LI><B>Currency Management Capabilities.</B>  We employ a separate team of currency specialists who manage foreign exchange exposure in our international funds.  Currency fluctuations can have a dramatic impact on the performance of international portfolios.  As a result, we believe it is critical to have a team of currency specialists who follow foreign exchange markets and can seek to protect a portfolio&#039s value during periods of currency volatility.
    <BR>
    <BR>
    <LI><B>Extensive International Presence and Client Base.</B><BR> 
    &#150 Goldman Sachs Asset Management Japan and Goldman Sachs Asset Management International were among the first investment advisors, domestic or foreign, selected to manage money for the Japanese Pension Welfare Service Public Corporation (Nenpuku) in 1995.  The mandate included global equity and Japanese equity portfolios.<BR> 
    &#150 In 1996, we launched our first domestic mutual fund in Japan and, with three funds now in place, have already become the third largest foreign-owned mutual fund company in Japan.<BR> 
    &#150 We further strengthened our international position with the strategic acquisition of CIN Management Limited (CINMan), the pension fund manager for British Coal.  Along with the acquisition, the Asset Management Division was awarded a mandate to manage $25 billion in assets for the U.K. Coal Schemes.

        <B>The First Step: Know Yourself</B>
        </FONT> 
        <BR>
        <BR>
        The first step in creating your investment plan is deciding what you want to accomplish.  Start by identifying your personal needs and preferences.  The following questions and answers illustrate some of the issues you should discuss with your financial advisor.
        <BR>
        <BR>
        <IMG SRC="/funds/gif/q.gif" ALIGN="BASELINE" WIDTH="33" HEIGHT="26" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"> Does it matter what stage of my life I am currently in?
        <BR>
        <IMG SRC="/funds/gif/a.gif" ALIGN="BASELINE" WIDTH="33" HEIGHT="23" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"> Yes.  Several important factors to consider in choosing appropriate investments are your age, the ages of your children (if any) and the number of years until your expected retirement. For example, do you need income to live on today?  Are you seeking to invest in anticipation of a major purchase in the near future, such as a new home or a child&#039s education?  Or are you investing to build assets for a long-term goal, such as retirement, that is five or more years away? Your investment time horizon can make a big difference in determining what type of investments are right for you. 
        <BR>
        <BR>
        <IMG SRC="/funds/gif/q.gif" ALIGN="BASELINE" WIDTH="33" HEIGHT="26" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"> Why is my investment time horizon so important?
        <BR>
        <IMG SRC="/funds/gif/a.gif" ALIGN="BASELINE" WIDTH="33" HEIGHT="23" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"> Your investment time horizon is a critical aspect to determine what types of investments are right for you.  Some investments, like equity funds, are appropriate only for long-term investors who are prepared to remain invested for five years or more and can therefore ride out short-term market fluctuations.  Your financial advisor can help you determine the mix of investments that is best for you.
        <BR>
        <BR>
        <IMG SRC="/funds/gif/q.gif" ALIGN="BASELINE" WIDTH="33" HEIGHT="26" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"> When I invest in stock funds, I worry about losing my money in market downturns. Should I invest anyway?
        <BR>
        <IMG SRC="/funds/gif/a.gif" ALIGN="BASELINE" WIDTH="33" HEIGHT="23" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"> Everyone&#039s temperament is different.  Some people are comfortable investing in equities despite their potential volatility in order to participate in their long-term growth potential while others are very uncomfortable with short-term price fluctuations.  Discuss your goals and feelings about risk with your financial advisor. Above all, be true to yourself.
        <BR>
        <BR>
        <IMG SRC="/funds/gif/q.gif" ALIGN="BASELINE" WIDTH="33" HEIGHT="26" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"> I don&#039t have much money to invest. Should I wait until I build up my savings?
        <BR>
        <IMG SRC="/funds/gif/a.gif" ALIGN="BASELINE" WIDTH="33" HEIGHT="23" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"> One of the best ways to achieve your investment goals is to start as soon as possible. Even small amounts of money invested regularly can help you build your assets over time.  The sooner you establish an investment program, the better your chances of reaching your objective. The key is getting started.
        <BR>
        <BR>
        By evaluating your answers to these and other key questions, your financial advisor can help determine whether you are a conservative, moderate or aggressive investor and which investments are most suitable for you.

      </FONT>
      <BR>
      <BR>
      Typically, investments that offer higher potential returns also involve greater risk of price fluctuation and therefore require a long-term time horizon.  The reason is that the longer you can leave your money invested, the more likely you will be able to wait out a market cycle and the less you will be adversely affected by short-term market declines.  
      <BR>
      <BR>
      <B>The Importance of Diversification.</B> Most people have a combination of short-, intermediate- and long-term goals.  As a result, they need a mix of different types of investments (i.e., stocks, bonds and cash) to accommodate their different objectives. Diversifying your portfolio among different types of assets also helps reduce risk because it means that all your eggs are not concentrated in one basket.  Since different types of investments often do not go up or down exactly at the same time or to the same degree, diversification  may help to reduce the impact on your investment portfolio if one segment of the market performs poorly.

      Specific investment goals can be as different as the people who hold them, but most goals can be grouped under one of five broad objectives.  These objectives are ranked in the pyramid you see below, with the most conservative at the bottom and the more aggressive at the top.  To identify your priorities, reference a specific objective.  The major investment objectives and the Goldman Sachs mutual funds that are designed to meet them are shown below.

      Goldman Sachs Funds are sold through a select group of brokers, financial consultants, financial institutions such as bank trust departments, and investment advisors around the country. They are also available through the Private Client Services Department of Goldman Sachs, which serves high-networth individual investors.  
      <BR>
      <BR>
      We believe that brokers and financial advisors can add a great deal of valuable guidance when you are ready to invest in Goldman Sachs Funds. They can  help by evaluating your financial objectives and suggesting a portfolio of funds that best serves your needs.

      Making your way through the maze of investment products and services on the market today is a full-time job in itself. With more than 6,000 mutual funds on the market today, comparing and understanding their objectives, potential advantages and risks is a huge task.
      <BR>
      <BR>
      The newspapers and business magazines are full of stories citing recent performance and various rankings.  But there is a great deal more you need to do before deciding which investments are right for you.  And that&#039s exactly where a professional financial advisor can provide valuable guidance.
      <BR>
      <BR>
      To decide how a financial advisor might be able to help you, start by taking the quiz in the following section.

      <B>How You Can Benefit From the Guidance of a Financial Advisor</B>
      </FONT>
      <BR>
      <BR>
      <BR>
      <B>Ask yourself a few key questions:</B>
      <BR>
      <BR>
      <IMG SRC="/funds/gif/q.gif" ALIGN="BASELINE" WIDTH="33" HEIGHT="26" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"> Do you have a well-thought-out financial plan?
      <BR>
      <IMG SRC="/funds/gif/a.gif" ALIGN="BASELINE" WIDTH="33" HEIGHT="23" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"> A good place to start would be to sit down with your financial advisor and review your current assets, income and expenses, as well as what you expect your financial situation to be in five years and beyond. How much are you currently allocating to savings and investments?
      <BR>
      <BR>
      <IMG SRC="/funds/gif/q.gif" ALIGN="BASELINE" WIDTH="33" HEIGHT="26" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"> Do you understand the objectives of different types of mutual funds, such as growth funds, growth and income funds, balanced funds and income funds?<BR>
      <IMG SRC="/funds/gif/a.gif" ALIGN="BASELINE" WIDTH="33" HEIGHT="23" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"> Every category of mutual funds, and in fact every individual fund, has a specific investment objective. For example, the primary goal of many growth funds is to seek capital appreciation over time whereas a growth and income fund would typically pursue a dual goal of growth of capital and growth of income. The name of a fund alone is not enough to understand the fund&#039s goal.  Your financial advisor can help explain the basics and help you determine whether a fund category or specific type of fund matches your objectives.
      <BR>
      <BR>
      <IMG SRC="/funds/gif/q.gif" ALIGN="BASELINE" WIDTH="33" HEIGHT="26" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"> Is your equity portfolio well diversified among funds with different investment styles?
      <BR>
      <IMG SRC="/funds/gif/a.gif" ALIGN="BASELINE" WIDTH="33" HEIGHT="23" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"> There are many different ways to select stocks.  Two of the most common investment styles are "growth" and "value".  A growth style typically emphasizes the future growth potential of a company emphasizing such characteristics as rapidly accelerating earnings.  A value style typically seeks stocks that are believed to be inexpensive relative to their earnings or their book value.  Not all stocks move in tandem.  That&#039s why it is generally a good idea to diversify your portfolio among funds with different styles.  Your financial advisor can help you decide what mix of fund styles is best for you.
      <BR>
      <BR>
      <IMG SRC="/funds/gif/q.gif" ALIGN="BASELINE" WIDTH="33" HEIGHT="26" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"> Do you currently have any international investments?
      <BR>
      <IMG SRC="/funds/gif/a.gif" ALIGN="BASELINE" WIDTH="33" HEIGHT="23" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"> The U.S. stock market and some foreign stock markets may move in different directions at different points in time.  That&#039s why some diversification among investments in different stock markets around the world can help to reduce the impact of the movements of any one market on your portfolio. Your financial advisor can help you determine which types of international funds best fit your goals and tolerance for risk.
      <BR>
      <BR>
      <IMG SRC="/funds/gif/q.gif" ALIGN="BASELINE" WIDTH="33" HEIGHT="26" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"> Do you have the discipline to stick with your investment plan, regardless of  short-term market fluctuations or bad economic news?
      <BR>
      <IMG SRC="/funds/gif/a.gif" ALIGN="BASELINE" WIDTH="33" HEIGHT="23" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"> It often helps to talk to an investment professional during periods of market volatility.  He or she can provide some historical perspective on long-term stock market trends and help you keep focused on your long-term goals.
      <BR>
      <BR>
      <IMG SRC="/funds/gif/q.gif" ALIGN="BASELINE" WIDTH="33" HEIGHT="26" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"> If you were faced with a financial emergency, would you know which of your investments should be liquidated first?
      <BR>
      <IMG SRC="/funds/gif/a.gif" ALIGN="BASELINE" WIDTH="33" HEIGHT="23" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"> Once again, your financial advisor can help you determine which investments might be best to hold onto, depending on the state of the economy at the time, your personal tax situation and many other factors.
      <BR>
      <BR>
      <IMG SRC="/funds/gif/q.gif" ALIGN="BASELINE" WIDTH="33" HEIGHT="26" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"> Do you have the time to monitor the market, economic trends or international events yourself?
      <BR>
      <IMG SRC="/funds/gif/a.gif" ALIGN="BASELINE" WIDTH="33" HEIGHT="23" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"> Few people have the time or access to research to track economic data on their own.  Sifting through what are often mixed economic signals can be very difficult.  And trying to follow markets around the world can tax the resources of most people. Your financial advisor can help to answer your questions on the impact that economic and important political events can have on your investments. 
      <BR>
      <BR>
      Even if you know most of the basics about investing, a financial advisor can help you come up with a plan designed to meet your objectives and fit your time horizon and tolerance for risk.

<LI><B>Steady Growth</B>. During the past year, Goldman Sachs&#039 Asset Management Division has increased its assets under management and administrati on from $55 billion on January 1, 1996 to $95.1 billion as of December 31, 1996 through a combination of internal growth and acquisition.<BR><BR>
&#150 In January 1997, we acquired Liberty Investment Management (Liberty), a Tampa, Florida-based investment advisory firm with approximately $5.4 billion in assets under management.  Liberty serves a wide range of clients, including many Fortune 500 companies, public pension funds, endowments, foundation and high net worth individuals nationwide.<BR><BR>
&#150 Last August, we acquired CIN Management Limited (CINMan), British Coal&#039s pension fund manager, which included a $25 billion global balanced mandate and will significantly strengthen our portfolio management teams in Europe, Japan and the Pacific Rim.
<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Recent Articles about Goldman Sachs Mutual Funds:
<BR><BR>&#150 <B>Goldman Sachs Select Equity Fund</B> and the <B>Goldman Sachs International Equity Fund</B> were recently mentioned for their competitive performance in <I>Kiplinger&#039s Personal Finance Magazine</I>, October 1996.

<P>In year-end reviews by industry publications,
Goldman Sachs has been commended for a number of its 1996 transactions.
<p><hr>

<P><STRONG>International Financing Review</STRONG><BR>
December 21, 1996

<P>"IFR Review of the Year"

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In its annual "Review of the Year," the International Financing Review awarded Goldman Sachs a 
number of awards for the firm's performance over the past year.  In its most prestigious designation, IFR 
named Goldman Sachs "<A HREF:"/about/media/ifr96.html">Bank of the Year</A>" for 1996.  

<P>The firm was also named IFR's "Equity House Of The Year," based upon the strength of its equity 
underwriting performance in 1996.  Goldman Sachs held top positions in many of the new issues last year, 
including <A HREF="http://www.dtag.de">Deutsche Telekom</A>, Japan Tobacco, <A 
HREF="http://www.lucent.com">Lucent</A> and Associates First Capital.  The article 
compliments the firm with having set a "new standard in global integration."

<P>Goldman Sachs received "Asian Equity House of the Year" honors.  IFR credits the firm with breaking 
fresh ground and pushing into diverse new markets in the Asian region to corner a large share of the new 
equity issuance there.

<P>The award for "Equity-Linked House of the Year" was given to Goldman Sachs for the "geographical 
diversity and sheer variety of its numerous lead-managed transactions."

<P>"Global Bond House of the Year" honors were also given to Goldman Sachs.  The article cites the 
diversity of credits and structures the firm provides and its effective, global distribution system as reasons 
behind the award.

<P>Finally, Goldman Sachs was also named "Loan Trading House of the Year," based upon the firm's 
vision within its secondary loan trading business.  The article states, "In a  market that continues to develop 
exponentially each year, Goldman has successfully juggled distressed and par trading to support its overall 
lending objectives."

<P>In addition to these awards, the following Goldman Sachs-led transactions were named "Deals of the 
Year" in this issue of IFR:

<P>Ten Goldman Sachs deals were singled out as "Breakthrough Deals" in this issue of IDD:

<P><EM>Equity Underwriting</EM><BR>
<A HREF="http://www.dtag.de">Deutsche Telekom</A> US$13 billion global privatization &#150 the 
second largest privatization in history and the largest foreign IPO in the U.S.

<P><EM>Debt Underwriting</EM><BR>
<A HREF="http://www.chase.com">Chase Manhattan Bank</A> US$550 million bank REIT preferred

class.

<P><EM>Convertible Underwriting</EM><BR>
<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</A> US$1 billion convertible preferred &#150 aimed 
to attract income-oriented investors because the software giant doesn't pay dividends on its stock and 
offered unusual 100% downside protection by guaranteeing a conversion at Microsoft's stock price on the 
day of the preferred's issuance.

<P><EM>Financing Financial Services</EM><BR>
<A HREF="http://www.wellsfargo.com">Wells Fargo</A>-First Interstate US$14 billion acquisition and 
NationsBank-Boatmen's Bancshares US$9 billion acquisition &#150 the two largest bank deals of the 
year.  Both deals were notable for their use of purchase accounting in lieu of pooling so the banks could 
conduct stock buybacks.

<P>ABN Amro-Chicago Corp. acquisition &#150 marked the increasing interest of foreign banks in 
moving into U.S. investment banking through an acquisition-based strategy.

<P>First Bank System US$300 million trust preferred &#150 issued on November 19, weeks after the Fed

<P>The following transactions, in which Goldman Sachs was at least one of the bankers on the deal, were 
named "Deals of the Year" by Institutional Investor:

<P><EM>Corporate Finance</EM><BR>

20 years without an issue and is stage one in a planned US$850 million capital program.

<P>Orange County US$761m recovery certificates of participation and US$122m taxable refunding 
pension obligation bonds &#150 marked the county's return to the municipal bond market after its

many in the market expected.

<P><EM>Real Estate</EM><BR>

<P><EM>International</EM><BR>
<A HREF="http://www.dtag.de">Deutsche Telekom</A> US$13bn initial public offering &#150 its

<P><STRONG>World Equity</STRONG><BR>
January 1997

<P>"Deals of the Year"

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In its annual "Deals of the Year" issue, Goldman Sachs received a number of prestigious awards from 
World Equity magazine.  The following are excerpts from the articles on the awards:

<P><EM>Global Equity House of the Year</EM><BR>
"Goldman Sachs has made it to the top of the tree in the international equity business. . . .  In fact, the 
firm's core equity underwriting business is simply churning out new offerings:  a total of 90 SEC-
registered common stock issues into the U.S. market (to December 16) with an average size of US$182m. 
&#133

<P>"Most of Goldman Sachs' landmark deals in 1996 were for corporate clients and included 
privatization-sized offerings such as Lucent Technologies' US$3.025bn IPO and the US$1.12bn flotation 
of mobile phone company Orange.

<P>"In 1996 Goldman Sachs had a 9.21% share of the bookrunning of all equity issues around the world. 
&#133 The greater the focus on the international equity business, the more impressive the numbers 
become. Goldman Sachs has a leading 14.4% share of SEC registered deals by U.S. and non-U.S. issuers; a 
leading 17.2% share of the primary market for international equity issues for European names; and - in a 
region which the firm admits it is not as strong as it would like to be - an 8% share of Asian deals, ranking 
it second only to Peregrine in 1996.

<P>"But, despite the global span of its business, there is no doubting the firm's crowning achievements of 
the past year have been European privatization sales:  the creation of Privatisation Exchangeable Notes for 
Italian insurance company INA; the third tranche of the Spanish government's sale of oil company <A 
HREF="http://www.repsol.es">Repsol</A>; and &#150 above all &#150 Goldman Sachs' global 
coordinating position for Deutsche Telekom's US$12.98bn IPO last November."

<P><EM>Global Equity Deal of the Year &#150 Deutsche Telekom</EM><BR>
"November's US$13bn IPO set new parameters for global equity markets.  First and foremost, it was a 
success for both the issuer and its investors. &#133 [The offer] can only be described with superlatives:  
the biggest international equity issue ever; the largest privatization out of Europe; the mightiest syndicate 
ever assembled; the most expensive retail advertising campaign; and by far the greatest ever participation 
in any stock issue by German retail buyers."

<P><EM>North American Equity Issue of the Year &#150 Lucent Technologies</EM><BR>
"There were a number of challenges facing Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, the bookrunners for the 
US$3 billion sale of <A HREF="http://www.lucent.com">Lucent Technologies</A>, which was spun off 
from <A HREF="http://www.att.com">AT&T</A> last April.  Lucent's chairman had set the investment 
banks a tight schedule for the sale of the first 20% of the telecommunications equipment business &#133 
[Lucent] was also a company with an uncertain market for its products among AT&T's rivals &#133.

<P>"Above all perhaps, floating 20% of Lucent was hardly going to create a sense of scarcity.  [Through 
successful marketing of the offer, the bookrunners overcame this obstacle.]  Priced at US$27 per share at 
the beginning of April (compared with an initial filing range of US$22-US$25), Lucent stock has soared to 
US$47 1/8, and the company's revenue growth has surpassed all expectations during its first year of 
independence."

<P><STRONG>Finance Asia</STRONG><BR>
January 1997

<P>"Achievement Awards"

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Finance Asia selected Goldman Sachs as Asia's "Most Improved Equity House" for 1996, based upon 
the strength it showed in Asian equity capital markets.  Its presence in the IPO market was bolstered not 
only by such issues as Asia Satellite Telecommunications (AsiaSat), but also by more-structured deals, 
such as the offering of US$338 million shares in the U.S. market for Korea Mobile Telecom.  Goldman 
underwrote 12 offerings in 1996 from eight different countries throughout Asia.  Goldman has also rapidly 
developed its presence in equity-linked products.  The partnership executed six equity-linked offerings 
totaling US$660 million last year, including Mahindra & Mahindra (see below).

<P>Goldman Sachs was also named the "Best IPO House" in Asia for 1996, and AsiaSat was selected as 
"Best IPO for an Asian Issuer" in 1996.  The high-profile dual listing of AsiaSat in both Hong Kong and 
on the NYSE was a "triumph" for its global coordinator, Goldman Sachs, the article contends.  AsiaSat was 
also notable for being the first satellite company to be listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

<P>A Goldman-led transaction, Mahindra & Mahindra, was selected as "Best Convertible Bond Offering 
for an Asian Issuer."  The sale of US$115 million of unsubordinated convertible bonds for the Indian 
vehicle company reopened the Indian convertible market after 18 months without a convertible issue.  The 
issue was lauded within the banking community as "one of the few true, if not the only true, convertibles 
this year."

December 30, 1996

<P>"Deal of the Year:  Japan Tobacco Recognized as Best Deal in Field of Public Offering and Sale of 
Corporate Stock"

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In a survey of 44 securities and industrial firms by the Nikkei news organization, Japan Tobacco 
ranked first among public offerings and sales of corporate stocks.  Goldman Sachs was one of two global 
coordinators of the offering.

<P>"It was a deal that strengthened our company's confidence in selling Japanese stock overseas," said 
Eric Dobkin, head of equity capital markets at Goldman Sachs.  "Not only was the scale of JT stock issue 
big and its sale good but also there were many innovative aspects, such as it was the first privatized stock 
sold overseas."

</CENTER>

<P>Distinguished members of the Keidanren and distinguished guests,
let me begin by saying how deeply honored I am to have the opportunity
to address the Japanese Federation of Economic Organizations.  In
saying that, I am mindful of the progressive and constructive role
that the Keidanren has played over the years in helping to shape
economic and financial policies and performance here in Japan.  That
tradition of leadership was vividly demonstrated earlier this year
with the publication of Keidanren's "Vision in 2020".

<P>My task today is to share with you my views on the evolution of the
Japanese banking and financial system in a global context.  As a
preface to that discussion, two central points need to be stressed.

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>First, a growing and prosperous Japan is obviously good for Japan,
but it is also good for the United States and good for the world;

<P>and Second, one of the prerequisites for sustained and robust
growth is a healthy, competitive and sound domestic banking and
financial system.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>As we all know, in Japan the last several years have witnessed
disappointments and frustrations with regard to both of these central
points as economic growth has floundered amid a persistent pattern of
serious asset quality problems across much of the banking and
financial system.

<P>Based on my experience in the US and elsewhere, and based on my
admittedly imperfect observations of developments here in Japan, it
seems clear to me that both the low growth and the banking sector
problems importantly have their origins in the asset price bubble of
the second half of the 1980s.  Of course, having said that, it must
quickly be added that the asset price bubble problem had its own
causes, some of which can be traced to public policies and some of
which can be traced to private actions.  The diagnostics and
post-mortums as to exactly what happened and why it happened are, of
course, important, but so, too is the need to view the Japanese
situation in context.  As a part of that context, the following
considerations are relevant:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>First, the asset price bubble and subsequent period of subpar
economic performance and serious banking sector problems are by no
means unique to Japan.  Indeed, as with the United States, broadly
similar problems of greater or lesser severity have been experienced
in recent years in a broad cross-section of countries of all sizes and
stages of economic development.
 
<P>Second, in many countries experiencing serious banking sector
problems, the national governments -- typically working with the
central bank - have made explicit decisions to protect depositors
and/or other creditors from financial loss in ways that involved the
use of taxpayer money to protect the stability of the banking system.
In all such cases, the decisions to use taxpayer money for this
purpose were highly controversial -- and understandably so.  However,
in the United States and in the other countries -- including Japan --
where I am reasonably familiar with the details of these events, I
believe such decisions were appropriate.  The reason for this
conclusion is based on my conviction that, had the authorities not
acted as they did, there existed a clear and present danger of
cumulative and indiscriminate liquidity pressures on the banking
system that had the potential to cause major damage to the financial
system and the economy as a whole.  While such actions by governments
bring with them certain dangers -- including the dangers associated
with the so called moral hazard problem -- there clearly are
circumstances in which governments and central banks must take
extraordinary steps to protect the well being of the banking system as
a whole.  Having taken such actions, aggressive steps must also be
taken to ensure that the causes of the banking sector problems do not
repeat themselves in the future.

<P>Third, in the US, Japan and other countries, the inevitable
bursting of asset price bubbles was followed by an extended and
necessary period of balance sheet rebuilding by households, businesses
and financial institutions.  This essential process of balance sheet
rebuilding curtailed propensities to spend, thereby retarding economic
activity even in the face of significant monetary and/or fiscal
stimulus.  In the US, these forces were the "head winds" which
Chairman Greenspan so graphically referred to in the early 1990s.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Looked at in this international setting, the recent economic and
financial problems in Japan are neither unique nor altogether
surprising.  At the same time, it appears that these problems have
been more persistent in Japan and that the turnaround and recovery
process in Japan is proceeding more slowly than it did in the US.  In
saying that, let me confess that the speed and extent of the
turnaround and recovery that occurred in the US financial system in
the early 90s was something of a surprise to me because, at the time,
I expected the process would take longer.  Accordingly, there may be
some value in briefly recounting the main factors that made this
adjustment in the US work so well and so quickly.

<P>To begin, it is worth recalling that in the interval roughly
between 1989 and 1991 an alarmingly large number of major US banks,
securities firms and insurance companies were in very poor financial
condition.  In addition, the period was laced with financial scandals
including the Drexel, Salomon Brothers, BCCI and B.N.L. Atlanta
episodes.  Despite all of this, within about three years, US financial
institutions, including the internationally active commercial banks,
had re-emerged as world leaders.  In the case of the banks, the rapid
turnaround was attributable primarily to four major factors:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>First, the relatively low level of short term interest rates and
the upward sloping yield curve clearly helped to improve
profitability, and thereby the internal capital generation rate.
Having said that, this factor was not, by itself, decisive, nor as
important as suggested by a number of observers.  Finally, and
contrary to the views of some, during the period in question, monetary
policy was not framed with a specific view toward aiding the banking
system.  The objectives of monetary policy were framed, as they always
are, in terms of macroeconomic performance, even though it was
obviously true that the policies needed to stimulate the recovery of
the economy were consistent with interest rate patterns that were
beneficial to the banks.

<P>Second, the second -- and in many respects -- the most important
factor in accounting for the rapid turnaround in the condition of US
banks was the dramatic reductions in operating costs the banks
achieved in a relatively short time frame.  In some instances, this
process was facilitated by mergers, but in several prominent cases
including Citicorp and Chase, major cuts in costs were achieved in the
absence of mergers.  To put the magnitude of these cost cutting
efforts in perspective, a number of US banks experienced improvements
in efficiency ratios of five full percentage points or more over a
period of about two to three years.  The flow-through effect of these
huge gains in efficiency to profits and internal capital generation
rates was very large and continues to benefit the performance of these
banks to this day.

<P>The dark side of the cost cutting and gains in efficiency was, of
course, that much of it was achieved through reductions in employee
headcounts.  This is clearly difficult in human terms, and it is also
an approach that is difficult to duplicate in countries having
different traditions associated with the relationship between the
employer and employee.

<P>Third, another key factor in accounting for the rapid turnaround in
the position of the US banks was the and enormous buildup in bank
capital that occurred in a short time.  As noted above, part of this
was attributable to internal capital generation originating with
spreads and the yield curve, but the majority of the capital buildup
resulted from improved efficiency.  Beyond these factors, the build up
in capital was accelerated by reductions or eliminations of dividends
to shareholders and aggressive programs to raise fresh capital --
especially equity or Tier I capital -- in the marketplace.  While such
capital-raising efforts entailed substantial dilution of existing
shareholders, such shareholders were richly compensated by the very
sharp run-up in bank stock prices that accompanied the restored and
enhanced financial health and profitability of the banks in question.

<P>In looking at the history of the build-up of the capital resources
of the major US banks in the early 90s, it should also be stressed
that even before the US banking crisis reached its peak, the US
regulatory authorities were taking an aggressive posture with regard
to provisions against bad or potentially bad loans.  Because of this
aggressive posture, it was transparent to top management, boards of
directors and shareholders that a number of large banks were faced
with the need to raise fresh capital in the marketplace.

<P>Fourth, the final factor that helped speed the rebuilding of the US
banks was the liquification of the underlying assets -- especially
real estate -- through loan sales and/or securitization.  These
techniques helped to make seemingly illiquid assets liquid and
provided a vehicle through which price discovery for the underlying
assets began to emerge.  In many cases, the disposition prices for the
loans in question relative to the book value of the loans were such
that existing provisions covered the full amount of the loss.  As a
consequence, it was often true that no additional income statement or
equity account charges were needed as these transactions were
consummated.  Finally, these techniques helped to stabilize and
ultimately reverse the fall of real estate prices much more quickly
than had been expected by most observers, including this observer.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>In citing these factors that were at work in the US, I fully
understand that experiences in one country may have little
applicability in another country.  Nevertheless, the US experience may
provide some useful grist for the mill in assessing the Japanese
situation.  With that in mind, allow me to now turn my attention to
some observations about the Japanese banking sector problems.

<P>The first and most important point is that the public, politicians,
journalists and the business community need to more fully appreciate
that a sound, competitive and appropriately profitable banking system
provides considerable value-added to the economy and the society at
large.  As such, all segments of society benefit when the banking
system functions well and all segments of society suffer when the
system functions poorly.  This is why, as I have said time and again,
"banks are special", and it is why banks in every country are subject
to a greater amount of official oversight than are almost all other
lines of commercial enterprise.

<P>In considering what steps might be taken to speed the recovery of
the Japanese banking system, it must be recognized that in the
international marketplace, there remains a nagging sense of unease
that the full dimensions of the asset quality problem in the Japanese
banking system is not fully understood or not fully disclosed.  In
part, this skepticism grows out of the fact that the definitions used
in Japan for calculating the level of non-performing or problem loans
are very liberal, and fall short of prevailing international
standards.  Unfortunately, this skepticism has damaged both the
credibility of the Japanese banks and their regulatory bodies.

<P>For this reason, it is my judgment that a first order of business
should be to move as quickly as possible to require much greater
transparency on the part of the banks and to adopt all relevant
international standards as they pertain to accounting, statistical
reporting and disclosure standards, including the rules and
definitions for disclosing non-performing or problem loans.  An
aggressive move in this direction will go some distance in improving
credibility even if, as seems likely, it will take considerable time
to fully implement these changes.

<P>Greater transparency is desirable in its own right, but it is also
consistent with movement in the direction of less regulation, less
administrative guidance and greater competition.  In this regard,
Japan has probably gone further in many aspects of financial
de-regulation than is widely recognized.  However, it remains true
that innovation and rapid technological adaptation are not the
hallmarks of the Japanese banking system.  Steps that will further
open the system while lowering the obstacles that prevent specialized
institutions from competing across a wider range of products and
services will all work to provide more competition and better services
for the public at large.

<P>Greater transparency, less regulation and more competition also
imply that the risk management systems used by banks must be
strengthened.  I am not sufficiently informed to have an opinion as to
the quality of the risk management systems in the major Japanese
banks.  However, I do know from my experience at the Fed and my role
as a member of the top-level risk committee at Goldman Sachs, how
demanding and expensive these efforts are, even in organizations
smaller and less complex than many of the very large Japanese banks.

<P>Moving toward greater transparency, less regulation and more
competition will yield desired results over time, but a complementary
effort to speed the resolution of problem assets is also needed.
Here, recent months have witnessed important progress as the banks
have moved more aggressively to bolster reserves, accelerate
write-offs, and, in some cases, to raise fresh capital.  But it is
certain that further steps in these areas will be needed, especially
as they pertain to cost containment and efforts to sell, securitize or
otherwise liquify the problem loans and the underlying assets
associated with those loans.

<P>The remaining area in which major initiatives are called for
relates to the clear need to strengthen the bank supervisory process
in Japan.  Historically, in Japan and in many other countries, the
supervisory philosophy was based on a special element of trust between
the banks and the supervisor.  Implicit in that trust was the
expectation that top management in banks would always know of any
serious problem and would, in an appropriate fashion, inform the
supervisor of any such problem.  Unfortunately, we have seen episodes
in many countries -- including the United States -- that run counter
to that historic relationship.  For this reason alone, stronger
supervisory efforts are needed.  However, the case for stronger and
more effective supervisory programs fundamentally rests on the readily
observable fact that the world of banking and finance has become so
much more complex, especially for large, internationally active banks.

<P>In these circumstances, it is clear to me that the quality and
quantity of the resources devoted to banking supervision in Japan must
be substantially increased.  For example, as I understand it, the MOF
and the BOJ have a combined examination staff of considerably less
than 1,000 employees.  Based on my experience, a work force of this
size is not even remotely adequate to the task at hand.  I also
believe that consideration should be given to formally and legally
assigning certain supervisory responsibilities to the BOJ, especially
with regard to bank examinations.

<P>I know this subject is controversial, so allow me to elaborate
briefly on my thinking.  To start with, I strongly believe that an
inherent responsibility of any central bank is to help ensure the
ongoing stability of the banking and financial system.  Because I see
this as an inherent responsibility of the central bank, it follows as
a matter of logic that the central bank must play an important role in
the supervisory process.  But, I have never argued that supervisory
responsibility should be the sole and exclusive responsibility of the
central bank, even though that is the practice in some countries.  In
the US, for example, I have been quite comfortable with the system of
shared responsibilities between the Fed and the Treasury because the
task is too important to be concentrated in one entity, and because
the shared responsibilities provide a critical element of "checks and
balances" in an area where few important issues are ever black or
white.

<P>More importantly, I believe the legal mandate of the Bank of Japan
should also be changed to provide the Bank with clear authority and
autonomy for the conduct of monetary policy.  As things stand now,
Japan is one of the increasingly small number of important countries
that does not have an independent central bank.  An autonomous central
bank with responsibilities for monetary policy and shared
responsibilities for banking supervision provides an institutional
setting in which the prospects for improved public policy are very
real.

<P>I might add in this regard that, in my judgment, autonomy and
independence are just as important in the supervisory arena as they
are with respect to monetary policy.  Politics and partisanship should
have no place when it comes to the dual and complementary goals of
price stability and financial stability.

<P>In speaking of the independence of the central bank, it must be
stressed that autonomy or independence do not imply a lack of
accountability.  To the contrary, there are any number of vehicles --
including greater disclosure and transparency through the legislative
oversight process -- that can provide a very high level of
accountability, even in the face of a much higher degree of legal
autonomy and independence.

<P>In closing, allow me to acknowledge that there is no simple and easy way to deal with these 
complex problems and that Japan must deal with them in a manner that suits Japan's needs, 
traditions and culture.  With that in mind, the suggestions I have made are respectfully offered in 
the spirit of friendship and candor that has marked my long association with leaders from both 
the public and private sectors here in Japan.  In that spirit, nothing will please me more than the 
dawn of the day when we see that the Japanese economy is growing again at a robust rate and 
when we see the Japanese banking and financial system has fully regained its critical role as an 
anchor for financial stability here in Japan and around the world.

<P>Thank you for your attention.

GOLDMAN SACHS PURCHASES CINMAN
</STRONG>

<P>LONDON - British Coal has agreed to sell CIN Management Limited
(CINMan) to Goldman Sachs Asset Management, a Division of The Goldman
Sachs Group, L.P.  In a joint announcement today, British Coal and
Goldman Sachs confirmed that negotiations had been completed to the
satisfaction of all parties involved, including the Trustees of the
two Coal Pension Schemes, the British Government and CINMan's
management.

<P>CINMan manages some &#163;15 billion of marketable securities assets
for the British Coal Staff Superannuation Scheme and the Mineworkers'
Pension Scheme and is one of the U.K.'s leading in-house pension fund
managers.  The expanded fund management activities of Goldman Sachs
Asset Management will have some $85 billion (approximately &#163;55
billion) of funds under management.

<P>The terms of the arrangements between the Trustees and Goldman
Sachs for the management of the Schemes' assets have been approved by
the U.K. Secretary of State for Trade and Industry in his capacity as
guarantor of the Schemes' assets.  Following a thorough review, the
Trustees of the British Coal Pension Schemes said they are confident
that the high quality of investment management services provided to
the British Coal Pension Schemes over many years will be maintained
and enhanced by this move.

<P>Commenting on the sale, Neil Clarke, Chairman of British Coal,
said, "We are very pleased that Goldman Sachs Asset Management will be
the new owners of CINMan.  At the final stage of the sales process,
bids were sought and received from a number of very high quality
institutions.  This has not only ensured British

<P>Coal will satisfy its statutory requirement to obtain the best
available terms, but will also enable the British Coal Pension Schemes
to continue to benefit from high quality asset management as in the
past.  Ownership by Goldman Sachs will also provide very significant
opportunities for the future career development of CINMan's management
and staff."

<P>Peter Sutherland, Chairman and Managing Director of Goldman Sachs
International, commented, "We are delighted to learn of the decision.
Goldman Sachs has known and worked with this outstanding group of
professionals for many years and we greatly respect their expertise
and excellent performance record.  We look forward to a long and
successful relationship with the two Coal Pension Schemes."

<P>David B. Ford and John P. McNulty, Co-Chief Executive Officers of
Goldman Sachs Asset Management, added, "This acquisition will
substantially strengthen our European, Japanese, Non-Japan Asia and
U.S. portfolio management teams.  CINMan has a solid long- term track
record in numerous markets and asset classes."

<P>Paul Trickett, Secretary of the Coal Schemes, said, "The Trustees
are delighted that CINMan is to be sold to Goldman Sachs.  Throughout
the sales process, the Trustees have sought to ensure that the
Schemes' 500,000 beneficiaries can continue to benefit from the good
track record of CINMan which, over a long period, has served the
Schemes well.  The Trustees believe that the integration of Goldman
Sachs and CINMan will improve the prospects of better investment
performance in the future.  They are looking forward to working
closely with Goldman Sachs."

<P>Rick Di Mascio, Managing Director of CINMan, commented, "Goldman
Sachs is a first class financial institution of worldwide stature and
repute.  We are looking forward to joining Goldman Sachs, so as to
combine the skills of both organizations to the benefit of both our
existing and future clients."

<P>British Coal have been advised by HSBC Samuel Montagu, and the
Trustees of the Schemes by Robert Fleming.

<P><HR>

<P><EM>Background Information on CIN Property Management and British Coal's Other Pensions Related 
Activities:</EM>

<P>The sale of CINMan is the penultimate step in the transfer of all
British Coal's pensions related activities to private sector
management.

<P>The process of the sale of CIN Property Management, which manages
some &#163;1.4 billion of property assets for the two Coal Pension
Schemes, is underway and is expected to be completed in the Autumn.
In preparation for the separate sales of CINMan and CIN Property
Management, the business of CINMan's property division was transferred
earlier this month into CIN Property Management, which is a separate
direct subsidiary of British Coal.

<P>CINVen, the manager of the venture capital assets of the Coal
Schemes and of those of The Railways Pension Schemes, Barclays Bank
Pension Fund and Royal Life Insurance, was sold to its management in
October 1995.  Subsequently, in November 1995, the pensions
administration activities undertaken by British Coal's Centris
subsidiary were outsourced to Godwins, a subsidiary of the AON
Corporation.

<STRONG>
GOLDMAN SACHS LAUNCHES COMPREHENSIVE TECHNOLOGY 
INDEXES, REPRESENT NEW COMPOSITE AND SINGLE SECTORS TECHNOLOGY
INVESTMENT BENCHMARKS
</STRONG>

<P>NEW YORK - Goldman, Sachs & Co., the international investment banking
and securities firm, unveiled today a new family of equity indexes,
The Goldman Sachs Technology Index (GSTI<SUP>TM</SUP>).  This includes
the flagship composite index of 176 stocks covering the entire gamut
of technology.  In addition there are six sector specific indexes,
GSTI<SUP>TM</SUP> Hardware, GSTI<SUP>TM</SUP> Software,
GSTI<SUP>TM</SUP> Semi-Conductors, GSTI<SUP>TM</SUP> Multi-Media
Networking, GSTI<SUP>TM</SUP> Internet, and GSTI<SUP>TM</SUP>
Services.  The GSTI<SUP>TM</SUP> Composite and the sector indexes
represent the broadest measure of technology stock price performance
of any publicized indexes, and are published in cooperation with The
Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE).

<P><STRONG>GSTI<SUP>TM</SUP> Includes 176 Important Technology Industry Common Stocks</STRONG>

<P>The GSTI<SUP>TM</SUP> will initially include stocks of U.S. - based
technology companies meeting the following criteria: industry code
based on Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes or the Russell
industry codes; market capitalization greater than $600 million as of
April 30, 1996; float greater than 20% of shares outstanding;
liquidity based on an annualized share turnover of 30%; and the common
shares must trade on the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock
Exchange or on NASDAQ.  The GSTI<SUP>TM</SUP> sector indexes are a set
of more narrowly based indexes originally selected by the Technology
Research Group at Goldman Sachs from the universe of composite index
stocks.  A company may be included in more than one index, but some
stocks may be included only in the composite and not in any sector
index.

 
<P><STRONG>CBOE Will Monitor & Sanction GSTI</STRONG>

<P>Stocks in the GSTI<SUP>TM</SUP> and sector indexes will be
rebalanced semi-annually, with selection of new companies and deletion
of those falling beneath market capitalization minimums monitored and
approved by CBOE.  Share adjustment to reflect changes in outstanding
shares will be made at the time of rebalancing.  Sector index stocks
may also have industry classifications changed at that time.

<P>The structuring of six sector indexes is designed to service the needs of investors 
focused on one or several industry segments with a greater level of detail than offered by the 
composite index.  Individual sector indexes include a range of nine to forty-five qualified 
stocks, representing a broad mix of companies.

<P>The companies included in the sector indexes are:

<TABLE>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>Semiconductors:</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP>Capital equipment, wafer and chip manufacturers</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>Computer Services:</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP>Systems integrators, customized software</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>The Internet:</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP>Access providers, internet software, on-line service providers, Internet hardware</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>Multimedia Networking:</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP>Telecom equipment, data networking and wireless equipment</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>Computer Hardware:</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP>Personal Computers, enterprise systems, peripherals</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>Computer Software:</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP>Client/server, enterprise software, Internet software, PC and entertainment software</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P><STRONG>Answers Demonstrable Need of Investors</STRONG>

<P>Goldman Sachs Partner Mark A. Zurack, who heads the firms Global Equity 
Derivatives Research Group, said that,
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 "The GSTI<SUP>TM</SUP> will answer a demonstrable need 
for a rule-based, objective and comprehensive series of indexes.  Our hope is to grow the 
GSTI<SUP>TM</SUP> by adding more qualified companies as these markets expand, and to include every
 important technology company within the scope of these reasonable guidelines.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><STRONG>"Will Become The Preferred Benchmark"</STRONG>

<P>Goldman Sachs Partner and Software Industry Research Analyst Rick Sherlund 
added that, 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"Daily, real-time index calculations accessible through most prominent
electronic date sources will provide investors timely information to
benefit from market fluctuations, and the ability to design strategies
targeted to specific industry segments.  We believe the
GSTI<SUP>TM</SUP> and its component indexes will become the preferred
benchmarks for portfolio managers and individual investors to evaluate
the behavior of technology stocks and to develop asset allocation
strategies across different segments in the technology sector.  The
trading of the available options in the indexes will be particularly
useful in hedging portfolios with large amounts of volatility.  The
Technology Research Group intends to incorporate coverage and analysis
of these indexes in our on-going research.  We will aim to provide
investors with valuation statistics that are helpful for sectoral
analysis and decision-making.

<P>
	Good morning ladies and gentlemen.  I believe all of you know that the subject 
matter of this Symposium -- the plumbing of the financial system -- has been of interest 
and concern to me for a very long time.  My preoccupation with it dates back to the mid 
1970s when, as a young officer at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, I was given 
responsibility for the Bank's Accounting Department.  At the time, I did not look 
forward to the assignment with great anticipation, since, in my native state, I viewed the 
work of the accounting department as consisting of a large group of green eye-shaded 
clerks performing dull and routine tasks.  I quickly learned otherwise as the aftermath 
of the Herstatt collapse, and the failure of the Franklin National Bank as well as the 
New York City financial crisis all worked to sharpen my sensitivity to the importance 
of payment, clearance and settlement systems.  I might add in this regard that it was in 
those years when I first came to know Tom Labrecque, since we were both involved in 
what was to become one of several redesigns of the CHIPS system.

<P>
	The experience I gained in the trenches twenty years ago was to serve me well, 
because as we all struggled to contain the various financial disruptions of the 80s and 
early 90s, the insights I gained in those earlier years on the nuts and bolts of the system 
were to prove invaluable.  Today, as witnessed by the extraordinary group of 
individuals in attendance at this Symposium, it is widely recognized that the global 
network of payments, clearance and settlement systems is the equivalent of the central 
nervous system of the entire international financial system, which, in turn, provides the 
critical underpinning for the global economy.

<P>
	We also recognize that while the time intervals are short, the amount of credit 
extended through payments, clearance and settlement systems is probably greater than 
the amount of credit extended through any other single modality of finance.  Finally, 
we recognize that, while major strides have been made in enhancing the efficiency, 
reliability and integrity of such systems, more remains to be done in a setting in which 
the volume, value and complexity of financial transactions continue to grow at 
astonishingly rapid rates.

<P>
	Many observers -- myself included -- believe that were a truly systemic financial 
shock to occur, it is likely, if not probable, that the vehicle which would transmit the 
shock from its initial source to other parts of the financial system would be the global 
network of payments, clearance and settlement systems.  The fundamental reason for 
this, of course, is that these systems constitute an extraordinarily complex chain of 
financial flows and resulting credit interdependencies that I dare say nobody fully 
understands.

<P>
	What is clear, however, is that a major break in the chain has the potential to 
bring large parts of the system to a halt, causing the much feared "financial gridlock" in 
which market participants conclude that the safest thing to do is to do nothing -- hold 
back on payments, cling to collateral and "fail" on securities deliveries.  At the level of 
an individual institution, such a decision might be seen as appropriate, but for the 
system as a whole, it is a recipe for disaster, since the failure of one or a few institutions 
to meet their side of transactions flows and obligations will quickly compromise the 
ability of others to meet their obligations.

<P>

	As I will indicate shortly, this concern is not wholly academic, because we have 
witnessed episodes in which the threat of such gridlock was present even though all 
such episodes have been contained or resolved without systemic damage.  Looked at 
in this light, it is undeniably true that the probabilities are very low that a systemic 
financial shock induced by a breakdown in payment systems will occur.  Regrettably, 
however, were such an event to occur, it would have the potential to cause large-scale 
damage to the financial system and to the economy as a whole.  As such, we have no 
choice but to extend efforts aimed at risk reduction in these systems.  However, I firmly 
believe that risk reduction efforts -- while costly and time consuming -- are also 
compatible with greater efficiency in the system and thus work to achieve the 
overriding goal of a more effective international financial system that is better 
equipped to go about its essential task of mobilizing savings and putting those savings 
to the best possible use, thereby promoting growth, prosperity and rising standards of 
living on a broad scale.

<P>

	Against this general background, and at the risk of great oversimplification, it is 
useful to catalogue the possible sources of events that could produce a major shock to 
payments, clearance and settlement systems into five groups.  Before discussing these 
groups, let me emphasize that in a very real way the distinctions between them can be 
quite artificial in that overlaps exist.  More importantly, no such effort aimed at a 
scheme of classification can cover every contingency.  With those qualifications in 
mind, the broad categories of events that could trigger a major breakdown in payments, 
clearance or settlement systems are as follows:

<OL>

<LI>Natural disasters, including earthquakes, hurricanes, and other similar 
events which can neither be predicted nor controlled.  Obviously we have 
experienced more than a few such episodes, but none has come close to 
producing the second and third level chain reaction of events that would 
constitute a major threat to the system.  There are several reasons for this: 
first, back-up systems at sites removed from the specific location of the 
natural disasters have proven to be quite good; second, in all such cases 
that I am familiar with, public authorities and private institutions have 
done a very good job in managing these situations, including efforts 
aimed at disseminating information on a timely and effective manner; 
third, and most importantly, the occurrence of natural disasters, while 
delaying transactions flows, have not given rise to heightened concerns 
about credit.  That is, while questions about timing of payments have 
arisen, questions as to whether payments would be made have not.

<P>In short, to date, the system has shown remarkable resiliency in the face of 
natural disasters, but the track record should not give rise to 
complacency.  For one thing, we have been lucky in that we have not had 
to face the simultaneous occurrence of a natural disaster and a credit 
shock occurring at the same time and the same place.<P>

<LI>Mechanical Failures:  Mechanical failures ranging from sustained 
computer outages at a major institution to large scale power failures can 
also be very disruptive.  Here, we have had at least two close calls that I 
remember very well.  The first was the Bank of New York computer 
outage, which stretched over about 30 hours on November 21 and 22, 
1985.  This episode was contained in part because the New York Fed 
made a $23 billion overnight discount window loan to the bank and in 
part because of the literally heroic efforts aimed at damage control on the 
part of individual institutions up and down Wall Street.

<P>In retrospect, there was a huge silver lining behind the cloud of the BONY 
episode, because it served as a major catalyst to aggressive fresh thinking 
on the part of public and private institutions as to the need for back-up 
facilities and systems, expensive as they are.  But, make no mistake about 
it, this episode was dicey, especially in the late morning of the second day 
when markets began to focus on credit and financing questions as the 
weekend drew nearer.  Indeed, at that point, intra-day credit exposures -- 
including by the Federal Reserve -- were not an abstraction.

<P>The second mechanical failure of consequence was a fire in a Con Ed 
substation that occurred on August 13, 1990.  This fire left a handful of 
buildings in lower Manhattan without power for six full days.  
Unfortunately, one of those buildings was the Federal Reserve Bank of 
New York, which, as you all know, may be the single most important hub 
of financial flows in the world, in that final payments and settlements 
totaling almost $3 trillion per day occur at the NY Fed.  All of those 
transactions were processed for the entire week without a major hitch.  
But that result entailed enormous effort throughout the New York 
financial community, and it put to the severest test several levels of 
operating and systems redundancies.

<P>One important lesson, of course, is that for any institution that is a major 
participant in global markets, that institution must be prepared to devote 
huge amounts of resources to the human and physical infrastructure 
needed to support its operations.  In this regard, if an institution finds that 
such efforts are too expensive, then it should not be in the business, and 
probably will not be in the fullness of time.<P>

<LI>Political Shocks: As we all know, political shocks such as Presidential 
assassinations can cause considerable market turmoil and uncertainty.  
That is a fact of life.  However, there are particular types of political 
events that are relevant to risk issues associated with payments, clearance 
and settlement systems because they bring with them elements of so-
called "Herstatt Risk" -- namely, that one counterparty has delivered 
value on a foreign exchange transaction and a few hours later, the 
opposite counterparty cannot or will not deliver the corresponding value 
in the other direction.

<P>Two episodes that come to mind in this regard are the coup in the Soviet 
Union in August of 1991 and the Libyan asset freeze in January of 1986.  
The latter case was especially interesting because the Presidential order 
formalizing the freeze was, regrettably, signed in the middle of the 
business day, calling into question payments that were already meshed 
into the CHIPS system and scheduled for final settlement at the New York 
Fed on the close of business that afternoon.  While the CHIPS settlement 
was delayed for a couple of nerve-racking hours, it was successfully 
completed, in part because the potential exposures were relatively small.

<P>Since then, the CHIPS system has been further strengthened, but these 
political shocks provide another illustration that more than twenty years 
after the fact, we have not done all that we can do to minimize the Herstatt 
Risk phenomenon.<P>

<LI>Major Market Shocks:  It goes without saying that major market shocks 
can raise significant questions as to the ability of institutions and market 
participants to meet their obligations as they pertain to exchanges of 
value through payment, clearance and settlement systems.  The most 
vivid example of this phenomenon arose in connection with the 1987 
stock market crash, when the speed and depth of the fall in stock prices 
seriously called into question whether individual firms or market 
participants had incurred losses that were so large as to undermine their 
ability to meet their obligations, including their obligations to exchanges 
and clearing entities.

<P>While the most visible case entailed the threat to the Options Clearing 
Corporation, the fact of the matter is that for two full weeks, concerns 
about credit and a further drop in stock prices were associated with 
numerous instances in which the normal flow of transactions were 
impeded as institutions and market participants adopted very cautious 
attitudes about credit extension and about the delivery of securities until 
they were virtually certain as to the opposite side of the transaction.

<P>This defensiveness is both understandable and appropriate in 
circumstances in which the timing gaps between two or more sides of 
transactions can extend for hours, days or even weeks before the cash 
settlement is truly final.  However, taken too far, these defensive 
strategies and tactics can produce the very problem that they seek to 
avoid.  In that regard, it is important to keep in mind that the size, 
complexity and global character of markets have grown enormously since 
1987.  Partly for this reason, there is little doubt in my mind that in 1996 
and beyond, a market crash of roughly equal magnitude to what we saw 
in 1987 would be more difficult to contain -- a conclusion that is 
reinforced by the virtual certainty that institutions and market 
participants will be more defensive the next time around.  For that reason 
alone, efforts to strengthen these systems -- including minimizing timing 
gaps and moving to sooner payment finality are so essential.<P>

<LI>Impaired Financial Institutions: The greatest danger to the well-being of 
payment, clearance and settlement systems arises in the circumstances of 
an internationally active financial institution whose reputation or financial 
strength is so impaired as to render it uncreditworthy in the eyes of other 
institutions or market participants.  When this occurs, the most 
elementary reaction sets in; namely, the instant the fear of not being paid 
takes hold, other firms will slow or halt the flow of money and valuables 
to the affected institution.  The problem, of course, is that the process 
builds on itself in that if money and valuables are not delivered to the 
troubled institution, it cannot meet its obligations, and the population of 
affected institutions can increase very quickly.

<P>While there are a number of interesting case studies of this nature, in 
many ways the most interesting surrounded the Drexel episode in 1990.  
Without going into great detail, there were three particular aspects of the 
Drexel case that are noteworthy examples of the manner in which such 
problems affect payment, clearing and settlement systems.  They were:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><STRONG>First</STRONG>, following the action of Drexel in placing the holding 
company and certain unregulated subsidiaries of the holding 
company into bankruptcy, there was great reluctance on the part of 
other institutions to enter into plain vanilla overnight RP financing 
transactions involving U.S. Government securities with the 
regulated entities, notwithstanding the fact that such transactions 
were virtually risk-free delivery versus payment transactions in 
government securities on the Fed book-entry system.  Moreover, 
even though the SEC and the Fed made clear public statements in 
support of the regulated entities, many institutions simply would 
not enter into such transactions and others did so only with great 
reluctance.  While the situation was managed, this pattern of 
market behavior was a clear threat to the orderly wind-down of 
Drexel -- a strategy that ultimately worked very well indeed.

<P><STRONG>Second</STRONG>, in a number of cases, financial institutions held securities 
owned by Drexel as collateral for loans or other exposures.  
Because there were questions as to whether cash would be 
forthcoming upon the return of the collateral, or that other 
exposures to Drexel could arise, market participants were most 
reluctant to free up such collateral.  Since the collateral in question 
was, in effect, frozen, Drexel's ability to wind down its balance 
sheet and/or meet other obligations to third parties was in 
jeopardy.  In the end, this situation was sorted out through 
cooperative efforts brokered by the authorities, but that process 
took almost a full week and even then, the workout of individual 
cases was slow and tedious.

<P><STRONG>Third</STRONG>, for almost two weeks, an important segment of the 
mortgage-backed securities market was in virtual gridlock because 
market participants were fearful of ending up in possession of 
definitive mortgage-backed securities that would have to be 
delivered to Drexel for cash at a later time.

<P>This situation was resolved only when another firm entered into an 
agreement with Drexel to purchase the entire portfolio of such 
securities, but for days it was not clear whether that transaction 
could be worked out to the satisfaction of both firms.

<P>In the face of that uncertainty and the passage of almost two weeks 
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, in collaboration with major 
banks and securities firms, went so far as to set up facilities in the 
Bank's gym to physically simulate a delivery-versus-payment 
settlement and physical exchange of the securities in question.  The 
"stone age settlement system", as we affectionately called it, was 
never used because the sale of the portfolio was completed.  But, 
the fact of the matter was that this ad-hoc arrangement was the only 
remaining alternative that any of us could think of that was capable 
of ending the gridlock in the market at that time.

<P>What is especially interesting about this episode is that the segments of 
the mortgage-backed securities market that were on the Fed DVP system 
worked to perfection, as did the securities that were cleared through the 
PTC end-of-day net settlement system.  What is also interesting about the 
Drexel case is that, at the time, the firm was relatively small with small 
and relatively uncomplicated off-balance sheet and related positions, and 
with essentially all of its activities conducted here in the United States.  
The point, of course, is that a similar event with a large and highly 
complex institution with multiple operating entities around the world 
would be that much more difficult to contain.

</OL>

<P>
	In citing these various episodes involving natural disasters, mechanical 
failures, political shocks, market shocks and impaired financial institutions, I am 
mindful that at the end of the day, the damage was always contained and the 
resiliency of the system demonstrated time and again.  I am also mindful that in 
part, because of these episodes, enormous strides have been made in improving 
the safety and reliability of payments, clearance and settlement systems.  But 
these efforts involve seeking to hit a very rapidly moving target.  For example:

<UL>

<LI>When I left the NY Fed two and a half years ago, the daily average 
value of wholesale payments processed or settled at the Fed was 
about $2 to $2.25 trillion.  Today it is $2.8 trillion.<P>

<LI>The globalization of financial markets continues to grow at an 
explosive rate and in the process, the number of institutions -- 
financial and nonfinancial -- that are now major participants in the 
global network of payment, clearance and settlement system grows 
daily.<P>

<LI>Technology has made the unthinkable possible, but for many, 
incomprehensible.<P>

<LI>Technology has helped to produce new and important providers of 
payment services -- a process that is accelerating the shift of payment 
processing -- and the credit extensions inherent in such activities -- 
further away from banks and central banks.<P>

<LI>Finally, we are reminded with disturbing frequency that even with the 
marvels of technology, and perhaps also because of these marvels -- 
breakdowns in elementary controls can produce nasty and dangerous 
surprises.<P>

</UL>

<P>
	In the face of all of these developments, the challenges that lie ahead in 
striving to still further strengthen the safety, reliability, efficiency and integrity of 
these systems seem to me to point to several pressing needs and several very 
large questions.  The pressing needs include the following:

<UL>

<LI>Heightened cooperation and coordination in risk reduction efforts 
between the private sector and the public sector within and across 
countries must be at the top of the agenda.<P>

<LI>Aggressive and systematic efforts must be mounted to substantially 
reduce the timing gaps between the time transactions are initiated and 
the time at which they are settled in final and irrevocable funds.  Same 
day finality across the board should be the goal, even if it is a long 
term goal.<P>

<LI>Netting arrangements -- including multi-currency netting facilities -- 
can and must be extended and expanded.<P>

<LI>The financial and operational integrity of all major exchanges and 
clearing houses should meet certain minimum standards.<P>

<LI>The role of Central Banks in both the oversight and operation of 
payments systems must be preserved, if not expanded, even as 
technological and other forces tend to work in the other direction.<P>

<LI>Individual institutions must further strengthen internal operating and 
control systems since these systems must remain the first line of 
preventative defense against major disruptions or shocks.<P>

</UL>

<P>Even as progress is made in these and related areas of endeavor we are still left 
with several major open questions of consequence.  For example:

<UL>

<LI>Do we really understand the long term consequences of the 
technologically driven disintermediation of payment flows away from 
credit sensitive financial institutions?<P>

<LI>Do we really understand the long term consequences -- including the 
possible consequences for monetary policy -- of the truly massive 
volume and value of cross border, cross currency financial flows?<P>

<LI>Do we really know -- taking account of all things -- whether we are 
gaining or loosing ground in the effort to achieve meaningful risk 
reduction in the global network of payment, clearance and settlement 
systems?<P>

<LI>Finally, are we sufficiently realistic to recognize that dispute the 
remarkable record of managing and containing problems in the past, 
the next disruption -- when, and not if it, occurs -- might not be as easy 
to contain?<P>

</UL>

<P>None of these questions, nor none of the areas of pressing need cited earlier, 
lend themselves to neat and surgically clean answers.  Nevertheless, I am 
confident that our deliberations over the next two days will point us in the right 
directions while helping to create a collective stream of consciousness that will 
contribute materially to a safer, sounder and more efficient international 
financial system.  Like the rest of you, I look forward to the presentations of our 
distinguished speakers and I very much want to express my appreciation to 
them and to you for being with us for the symposium.

									
<P>Thank you,

</CENTER>

<P>Good evening Ladies and Gentlemen.  I am pleased and honored to have this opportunity to follow in 
the long line of distinguished speakers who have addressed the Boston Commercial Club.  The New 
England area has special significance to me in part because my roots are here, but also because of my 
long and close association with the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.  For me, the Boston Fed has 
always represented the very best of what the founding fathers of the Fed had in mind when they insisted 
upon regional representation in the policy making endeavors of this nation's central bank.  Fulfilling that 
role to maximum presupposes that the Reserve Bank will be firmly established within the community -- 
indeed, that it will be a vital part of the community. The Boston Fed that I have known for almost 30 
years has been the very essence of that ideal and its role in that regard has been maintained, if not 
enhanced, under the leadership of President Minehan.

<P>The subject matter for my remarks tonight is both complex and controversial whether viewed from a 
regional, national or international perspective.  Indeed, the heart of the issue I want to explore with you 
is the enormously vexing question as to how the legitimate economic and social needs and aspirations of 
all segments of society can be reasonably well met in the face of scarce resources and clear limits on 
how fast the national and international economy can safely grow even over the intermediate term.

<P>For starters, we can all recognize that by many historic norms, recent economic performance in the U.S. 
and around much of the world has been reasonably, if not very, good.  In fact, the performance of the 
U.S. economy over the past several years has been striking, especially taking into account the 
dramatically renewed competitive edge of large segments of U.S. industry -- including service industries.  
At the risk of overstatement, and putting aside for the minute the problem of our very low national 
savings rate, I would argue that the underlying condition of the private sector of the U.S. economy is in 
better shape today than at any time in the past thirty years.  In saying that, obviously I recognize that as 
a nation we face serious problems that I will turn to in a minute.  However, as a preface to that 
discussion, it is important to recognize that we have the rare opportunity to approach these problems 
from a position of relative strength.

<P>Looking beyond the U.S., conditions throughout much of the world are also reasonably good 
notwithstanding obvious problems in a few large countries such as Mexico and Japan, as well as 
mounting evidence of slowing growth in Europe.  Overall, however, global GDP growth is, and is likely 
to remain, broadly satisfactory in a setting in which inflation is relatively subdued almost everywhere.  In 
the midst of all of this, we often lose sight of the fact that new economic success stories are not limited 
to Asia and a few isolated cases in other parts of the world.  For example, within the past few years we 
have witnessed striking improvements in such diverse and important countries as India and South Africa, 
Brazil and Egypt, the Czech Republic and, yes, even Russia.

<P>The facts and figures are interesting, but there is something far more important than economic statistics.  
Namely, today there are relatively fewer people living under the fist and boot of military or totalitarian 
governments than at any time in the millennium, if not for much longer.  We call this the New World 
Order but in <EM>fundamental</EM> terms it is the triumph of a simple and seemingly self-evident ideal -- the 
supremacy of the individual and the genius of freedom, including the freedom of choice in economic and 
political matters.  However, triumphs are seldom, if ever, absolute, so as we celebrate this triumph of 
ideal and idea, let us remember that the New World Order is not our collective divine right, nor is it yet 
secure.

<P>That sobering thought aside, when we look at all that has occurred in economic, political and geo-
political terms over the past 5 to 7 years, we are still left with a nasty, nagging question.  That is, in the 
face of all these good things, why do so many people in so many places feel so bad?  Better said, why 
are so many people in so many places so damned angry?

<P>Here in the United States, many of the symptoms of this frustration and anger are plain to see.  Of those 
symptoms, one that I find particularly worrisome is the outcry coming from both ends of the political 
spectrum to the effect that we, as a nation, should give the rest of the world a cold shoulder -- if not a 
firm stiff-arm -- in order to better cope with our problems at home.  This frame of mind,  which I call 
"national introspection", has not yet reached the proportions of the extreme isolationism of an earlier 
day, but it could.  And if it does, we will again -- sooner or later -- confront a rude awakening in which 
the domestic agenda will not have been well served and our ability to provide leadership around the 
world in the name of freedom will have been seriously, if not irreversibly, impaired.

<P>Having said that, it is undeniably correct to say that we must better come to grips with the domestic 
agenda, but that will not be easy.  Take, as an example, balancing the budget.  I am hard-pressed to 
think of any single thing that is more essential to our long term economic and financial interests than 
getting to a balanced budget as quickly as possible.  However, given the size of the deficit and the 
current mix of expenditures and receipts, balancing the budget -- especially while reducing taxes -- 
necessarily entails sharp cuts in domestic programs which, in the eyes of many, call into question the 
very heritage of the United States as a fair and just society.

<P>While on the topic of the U.S. budgetary situation, let me digress briefly to make an important and often 
overlooked analytical point.  For starters, neither the size of government relative to GDP nor the size of 
the deficit relative to GDP in the U.S. are large in comparison with other industrial countries.  To the 
contrary:

<UL>

<LI>government outlays at all levels in the U.S. are about one-third of GDP, the lowest such 
fraction among the G-7 countries.  Even more striking is the fact that this fraction in the U.S. is 
more than 10 full percentage points below the average for the G-6<P>

<LI>the U.S. budget deficit relative to GDP is also the lowest of the G-7 and, here too, the deficit 
in the U.S. relative to GDP is well below the average for the other industrial countries.<P>

</UL>

<P>Thus, the major problem associated with the U.S. budget deficit is not its size relative to GDP, but rather 
its size relative to domestic savings.  Here it is important to keep in mind that for any country, available 
savings must finance all forms of private investment and any deficit in the government sector.  When, as 
has been chronically the case in the U.S., the combination of private investment and government deficits 
exceed domestic savings, the gap must be filled by inflows of savings from the rest of the world, which 
is reflected as the U.S. current account deficit.  In other words, a current account deficit over time 
necessarily implies a structural imbalance in the form of over-consumption and under-savings.  This, 
Ladies and Gentlemen, is the core problem in the U.S., and it is a very large problem indeed.

<P>To put it in perspective, as late as the early 1980's, the U.S. was one of the world's largest net creditor 
nations.  Today we are, by far, the largest net debtor nation in the world.  Looked at another way, the 
foreign savings inflows into the U.S. needed to finance the combined current account deficits for 1994 
and 1995 alone will likely exceed the total private savings inflows into all of the more than 30 developing 
countries throughout the world that have access to one form or another of private foreign capital flows.  
You need not be a Nobel laureate in economics to understand that this comparative pattern of behavior 
makes no sense at all.

<P>Looked at in this light, the fundamental problem with the U.S. external deficits is not to be found with 
low wages in Mexico or trade barriers in Japan, but rather with over-consumption and under-savings at 
home.  This is not to say that these other factors are unimportant, for surely they matter.  But it is to say 
that Pogo had it right: we have met the enemy and it is us.

<P>Since the only remotely fail-safe way to remedy this structural imbalance is to eliminate government dis-
savings, we literally have no choice but to get rid of the budget deficit, since maintaining anything like our 
current dependence on foreign savings over the long run is a recipe for serious problems in economic, 
financial, political and even strategic terms.

<P>While the extent and duration of the undersavings problem is more or less unique to the U.S. among the 
major industrial countries, all such nations are grappling with major budgetary problems.  More 
generally, the frustration and anger phenomenon is widespread, if not virtually universal, across countries 
in all stages of economic development.  Consider, for example, the following short list of tell-tale signs:

<UL>

<LI>Canada remained a unified country by a razor-thin margin;<P>
<LI>widespread strikes by public sector workers in France;<P>
<LI>recent election results in Poland, Russia and Turkey;<P>
<LI>the apparent increase in worker dissatisfaction even in Japan;<P>
<LI>widespread evidence of ethnic and racial tensions in many countries, including our own;<P>
<LI>widespread public mistrust of institutions in general, but especially mistrust of governmental
institutions.<P>

</UL>

<P>The venerable former Speaker of the House was fond of correctly reminding us that all politics are local.  
Consistent with that, the symptoms of frustration we see in various countries have their distinct local 
causes.  However, in looking at the United States and at so many countries around the world, there 
does seem to be a more or less common denominator that goes some distance in explaining the 
frustration and anger phenomenon.  That common denominator is the perception and the reality of 
widening disparities in income distributions within individual countries and across groups of countries.

This phenomenon takes many different forms.  For example:

<UL>

<LI>in the transition and many emerging market countries, we are witnessing the almost inevitable, 
but ultimately transitory, phenomenon of a relatively small number of people amassing vast 
fortunes even as the economic and social well-being of large segments of the society stagnates 
or declines;<P>

<LI>in much of the industrial world, especially in Europe, unemployment rates and the incidence of 
discouraged workers are at alarmingly high levels with little or no hope for material improvement 
in the near to intermediate term;<P>

<LI>in the United States, a sizable fraction of the middle class is experiencing falling real incomes 
while by some estimates, the gap between the richest and the poorest in the U.S. is now the 
widest among all OECD countries.<P>

</UL>

<P>Given these circumstances, it is not at all difficult to understand why so many people are so frustrated 
and angry, but all of that begs the question as to the reasons for the conditions described above.  Taking 
the U.S. as an example, why are so many individuals doing so poorly in the face of strong overall 
economic performance?

<P>Answering the question as to why so many people are doing so poorly is very complex, especially 
allowing for the thoroughly disadvantaged members of the society.  However, for the working middle 
class, much of the answer appears to be associated with three closely interrelated factors, all of which 
are importantly rooted in changing technology.  These factors are: first, more rigorous competition in the 
markets for goods, services and labor within and across countries; second, the cost-driven restructuring 
of business firms of all sizes and industry groups that often displace large numbers of relatively immobile 
workers; and third, the impact of technology on the demand-supply dynamics of the labor market, 
which has radically altered the relative premium for more highly-educated or technically sophisticated 
workers.  The interaction of these and other forces has produced a two-tiered economy which, for 
many, impairs current earning power and poses a major threat to job and income security in their 
working years and beyond.

<P>Starting with the most basic of human considerations, there are many reasons why we should be 
concerned about this situation.  There is, however, one particularly important reason which may be 
overlooked; namely, left unattended for too long, this situation could ultimately undermine public and 
political support for essential discipline in monetary and fiscal policies.  That outcome we surely do not 
need!

<P>All of this, in its many forms and in its many places, results in a major dilemma for economic policy in a 
setting in which finding sensible and durable answers to the plight of those being left behind in the midst 
of prosperity is not easy -- to put it mildly.  This is especially so in a setting in which many of the things 
that must be done in most countries to better secure long run prosperity -- such as reducing budgetary 
deficits and taking further strides to increase competitiveness -- cut the wrong way over the short to 
intermediate term.  That is, in the short run, these measures will tend to make things for the unemployed, 
the under-employed and the disadvantaged worse -- not better.

<P>For some -- including a number of prominent observers in the United States -- the answer to the income 
distribution problem is quite simple -- namely, stimulate faster growth in the economy, a process that 
would have to depend importantly on monetary policy, since fiscal policy is clearly on the sidelines for 
this purpose.   As things stand right now, I find such an approach deeply troubling.  For one thing, it is 
by no means clear that faster growth would narrow the gap even if overall employment growth 
accelerated.

<P>The real issue, however, is whether the economy can grow faster than 2 1/2 to 2 3/4 percent without 
unacceptable risks of rekindling inflation over the intermediate term.  Some would argue that the 
potential growth rate of the economy is higher than the 2 1/2 to 2 3/4 range or that the so-called natural 
rate of unemployment is lower than the roughly 5 1/2 rate used by many as the benchmark.  In either 
case, the argument is that (1) in part because of the international dimension, markets for goods, services 
and labor are more competitive and less inflationary; and/or (2) due to industrial restructuring, 
technology and the higher investment rates of recent years, trend productivity growth is strengthening 
and the economy is therefore less prone to inflationary pressures.

<P>Both of these lines of thinking have some appeal, especially in light of the fact that recent productivity 
growth has been stronger than the 1 1/2 percent trend implicit in the 2 1/2 percent GDP potential 
growth rate calculation.  Having said that, policy makers must approach these questions with great 
caution, since a misjudgment as to how rapidly the economy can grow will entail such serious 
consequences.  Maybe there are forces at work that will increase potential growth or reduce the natural 
unemployment rate, but if there are, they will work slowly.  In the meanwhile, and until the evidence is 
very clear, it strikes me as dangerous to frame policy on the basis of a hypothesis for which the 
supporting evidence is tenuous at best.  In other words, I do not expect that the near-term answer to the 
policy dilemma discussed earlier is to be found in any material way in faster growth in the U.S., even if 
there are some straws in the wind suggesting that the growth potential of the U.S. economy may be 
edging up a bit.

<P>Let me hasten to add in this regard that for much of Europe and Japan, there is more than ample room 
for more rapid growth in the short to intermediate term.  Indeed, more rapid growth in domestic 
demand in these countries would be good for them, good for us, and good for the world at large.

<P>Returning to the U.S. situation, if the answer to the income distribution problems is not to be found in 
more rapid growth, it surely will not be found in rolling back NAFTA, copping out on the WTO, further 
curtailing our support for the multilateral official institutions or, most importantly, depreciating our 
currency.  All of these measures have an element of seductive appeal, but over time they will work the 
wrong way in economic terms and in the process, introduce new and potentially dangerous tensions 
among nations.  To put it bluntly, greater openness in trade, finance and political relations can work to 
increase the size of the global economic pie.  A retreat from these principles will surely shrink it.

<P>Having said that the solution to our problems does not lie in faster growth in the U.S. nor in turning 
inward, what then is the remedy, recognizing that the answer here in the U.S. must be broadly 
compatible with approaches and needs in other countries?

<P>In the broadest terms, the solution must start with a careful blending of traditional macro-economic 
policies, together with a creative mix of structural or micro-economic policies.  At the macro level, the 
savings, private investment and productivity nexus must be at the center of the process because -- at the 
risk of oversimplification -- the only sure way to generate higher growth and broad-based gains in living 
standards is through higher productivity growth which can only be achieved in a setting where savings 
and investment perform in a sound and rational manner.

<P>Some elements of the appropriate macro-economic approach I have already mentioned, but allow me 
to briefly repeat myself.  These elements include (1) guarding against a renewal of inflationary pressures 
over the intermediate term; (2) eliminating the U.S. budget deficit  over the intermediate term, thereby 
putting a large dent in the U.S. under-saving problems; (3) achieving more rapid growth in the short to 
intermediate term in domestic demand in much of Europe and Japan; and (4) achieving intermediate 
term deficit reduction in most of the industrial countries.

<P>While there is nothing terribly new in any of these suggestions,  what would be new is success in getting 
them done.  And, as you can readily see, each of them is compatible with higher savings, higher 
investment and higher productivity growth over time.  Beyond that, they are also compatible with 
reduced congestion in international capital markets and a better allocation of global savings flows, with 
the U.S. and industrial nations as a group consuming relatively less of the growing pool of global 
savings.

<P>However, even the very best of effort and execution in these areas of macro-economic policy will not be 
good enough to produce broad-based gains in standards of living here and elsewhere.  In other words, 
they are necessary, but not sufficient, conditions for success.  Several other areas of endeavor will be 
needed including the following:

<P>First, here in the United States and elsewhere, major efforts are needed to muster 
broad-based public and political support for openness in trade, finance and other areas 
of economic endeavor.  One of the oldest and least appreciated tenets of basic 
economics is that the benefits of specialization accrue to all.  To be sure, greater 
specialization produces dislocations in the short term, but in the fullness of time, open 
trade and finance foster greater output, higher productivity and rising standards of living.  
Indeed, I am very hard-pressed to imagine how needs and aspirations can be met 
unless global trade continues to grow at rates well in excess of the growth of GDP.  In 
the face of creeping protectionism and national introspection here and elsewhere, this 
result is by no means assured.

<P>Promoting greater support for openness will require a major public educational effort on 
the part of leaders from government, the business community and the academic 
community.  I might add in this regard, that the Boston community, with its unique blend 
of progressive leaders in government, business and academia, seems to me especially 
well-positioned to play a leadership role in this educational effort.

<P>Second, we also need to build broader public support for the major multinational official 
financial institutions including the World Bank and IMF.  While the precise role of these 
institutions will change over time, the developmental need in places such as Africa, and 
the Mexican crises of last year leave absolutely no doubt as to the indispensable role 
these institutions must play in the period ahead.  With all countries feeling the pressures 
on budgets, maintaining -- much less increasing -- financial support for these institutions 
will not be easy, but a failure to do so will inevitably entail much greater costs over time.

<P>Third, we must take further steps to strengthen the workings and stability of the 
international financial system including, but not limited to, establishing a uniform cross-
boarder framework for capital adequacy standards for market risk that would apply to 
all internationally active banks and securities firms.  Such steps will help reduce volatility 
and further diminish the risks of a systemic financial shock -- an event which, if it were 
to occur, could inflict major damage on the global economy.

<P>In all of the areas outlined above, I am reasonably optimistic that we can achieve a large measure of 
success.  However, even if that is the case, it is by no means clear that the frustration and anger problem 
will abate materially without more targeted efforts to deal with the unemployed, the under-employed, 
and the discouraged worker.

I am not an expert in this field, but it is simply not clear to me that we have even begun to fully 
appreciate all that will be involved in addressing the skill and educational needs of literally millions of 
displaced workers and new labor force entrants in a setting in which neither government-sponsored 
training programs nor our public school systems have performed in line with needs and expectations.  It 
is, however, very clear to me that there is a need for a massive infusion of public investment and private 
creativity into education and training institutions in a setting in which the private sector must have a larger 
role in the design and execution of these efforts.

<P>To conclude, we in the United States, together with the community of nations, are faced with a rare 
opportunity to shape our future in a manner that holds out the potential for peace and prosperity on a 
scope and scale unprecedented in history.  To a very large degree our success in this venture will 
depend on how we manage our economic affairs over time and how well we cope with the especially 
daunting problem of adverse shifts in income distribution.  For the most part, we know what needs to be 
done and we know how to do it.  Thus we are faced with four critical choices:

<P><STRONG>First</STRONG>, will we have the discipline to avoid the mistakes of the past?

<P><STRONG>Second</STRONG>, will we have the vision to adopt and stick to policies that will produce the optimal 
results over the intermediate and longer term?

<P><STRONG>Third</STRONG>, will we have the patience to stay the course when the inevitable setbacks occur in the 
short run?

<P><STRONG>Fourth</STRONG>, will we have the courage to stand tall against those who would undermine openness and 
freedom in economic and political affairs?

<P>I for one am optimistic that the answer to all of these questions can be in the affirmative.  For that 
reason, I also believe that a more secure New World Order rooted in the supremacy of the individual 
and the genius of freedom is within reach.

									
<P>Thank you,

</CENTER>

<P>Members of the Fernandez family, distinguished guests, ladies and
gentlemen; I am deeply honored by your invitation to deliver the
initial lecture in the Jose B. Fernandez, Jr. Memorial Lecture Series.
As you all know, Jobo and I were friends and colleagues.  Our
relationship was forged in those dark and difficult days of the
mid-1980s when economic, financial and political turmoil here in the
Philippines had pushed your country to the very edge of outright
collapse.  While much has been written and spoken about Jobo, from my
perspective those were Jobo's finest days, because he was willing to
stand tall and firm -- at times almost alone -- in the bitter struggle
for what he knew was in the best long-term interest of his beloved
Philippines.

<P>For all his accomplishments and his mastery of economics, finance,
banking and central banking, Jobo was a simple man.  He knew the
basics and he stuck with those basics.  He was a quiet but forceful
champion of the oldest of the old time values; love of family and
friends, love of country, and, yes, love of God.  Because he held
these values so closely, he had the courage and the conviction to
pursue what he believed to be the right and proper course of action
for its own sake and to do that with the knowledge that it was often
going to prompt criticism and political attack.  But even when that
criticism crossed the line of constructive and just, Jobo handled it
with grace and dignity.  Then again, however, true patriots always do,
and Jobo, for all of his other traits, was first and foremost a true
patriot.

<P>As he looks over us today, Jobo must feel a sense of satisfaction, if
not pride, in all that has been accomplished here in the Philippines
in recent years.  Indeed, the contrast between the mid-80s and the
mid-90s could not be more stark.  But, knowing Jobo, if he were with
us in the flesh, he would remind us all that the real task lies ahead
and that task is, of course, sustaining recent patterns of performance
over the long haul.  He would also remind us that the consequences of
errors or misjudgments in economic policies are even more harsh than
in the past.

<P>All we need do is ponder the swift and costly turn of events in Mexico
earlier this year to be forcefully reminded as to the dire
consequences that can follow when a country is buffeted by adverse
political developments and misjudgments in economic policy.  The
Mexican case was striking in part because of the speed and magnitude
of the shock, and in part because, until the crisis, Mexico was seen
by many as the model case study of a successful emerging market
economy.  It was also striking because, for a time, the spillover
effects on other emerging market economies was swift and alarming.
One can only speculate, but in my view, that situation could have
turned very nasty had it not been for the willingness of the United
States, and subsequently the I.M.F., to step into the void with a
major stabilization program.

<P>While the circumstances of the Mexican case were unique, its general
market manifestations were not.  That is, what we saw in the Mexican
case -- namely, the equivalent of a cash run on a country -- is a
phenomenon we have witnessed with disturbing frequency.  Moreover,
this phenomenon has not been limited to emerging market economies with
large current account deficits.  In fact, the fracture of the European
Monetary System with its attendant devaluations in the U.K. and Italy
were, in a proximate sense, brought about by massive shifts in
investor preferences for particular currencies and investment vehicles
which interacted to produce the run -like effects that have become all
too familiar.  While the E.M.S. case and the Mexican case have little
in common, there are two interesting parallels which should not go
unnoticed.  They are:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><STRONG>First</STRONG>, in both cases, market participants,
including very sophisticated foreign investors, were reaching for high
rates of return in a context in which they believed that exchange rate
risk was nil.  This persisted over a period of time even as it became
clear that trouble was brewing with the economic and financial
fundamentals.
     
<P><STRONG>Second</STRONG>, even as the problems with the fundamentals
became more obvious, it took a political shock to produce the wake up
call that triggered the sharp and abrupt change in market psychology.
In Europe, it was the Danish referendum on the Maastricht Treaty; in
Mexico, it was Chiapas and political assassination.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>This linkage between political events and abrupt changes in market
psychology is not new, but what is new is the sheer magnitude and
speed with which the run on the country can materialize.  Indeed, once
the process begins to unfold, even robust levels of official reserves
can be depleted in a matter of days.  More importantly, in case after
case, it is apparent that efforts to stabilize the situation require
very strong domestic policy adjustments in the country in question --
policy adjustments that will almost always work in the direction of
suppressing domestic economic activity and raising either unemployment
or inflation or both.

<P>Part of the reason why the run-on-country phenomenon can be so swift
and violent is, of course, tied to technology which makes it so easy
for residents or foreign investors to move huge amounts of money out
of a particular country at almost a moment s notice.  In these
circumstances, some observers have navely suggested that the
answer to Mexican like problems is to limit or restrict, by regulation
or administrative action, the extent to which money can move out of a
country.  This is wishful thinking because such steps almost certainly
will not work and even the threat of such efforts by a particular
country would produce the very problem that the country was seeking to
avoid.

<P>For perfectly understandable reasons, authorities at the level of
individual countries, the G-7, the IMF and many informed observers
have come to the view that the features of contemporary international
finance that permit the run-on-country phenomenon are a potential
threat to the stability of the international financial system.  While
that conclusion is clear enough, what to do about the situation is by
no means clear, especially for relatively small and open economies and
financial systems such as are found here in the Philippines.  In
approaching the question of what to do, however, several things are
clear:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><STRONG>First</STRONG>, foreign investment -- including portfolio
investment -- is a necessity for every country, but especially for
those emerging market economies that are in the rapid stages of
economic growth and development.
     
<P><STRONG>Second</STRONG>, by their very nature, portfolio
investments by foreigners into a particular country, when coupled with
that country s public and private external debt obligations, yield a
situation in which domestic interest rates and the exchange rate can
be extremely vulnerable should things begin to turn sour in that
country.
     
<P><STRONG>Third</STRONG>, in an ironic twist, strong patterns of
capital inflows in the form of portfolio- type investments can put
upward pressures on the exchange rate that work in the direction of
increasing trade deficits and current account deficits even though,
for a time, the resulting deficits are financed with apparent ease
through the capital account.  This process can extend over a period of
time, but if it begins to unravel, the unraveling can occur very
rapidly.
     
<P><STRONG>Fourth</STRONG>, for all countries, but especially for
relatively small, open emerging market countries, the degrees of
freedom for domestic monetary, fiscal and exchange rate policy are
somewhat reduced in the sense that the consequences for misjudgments
in policy can, through international financial channels, be swift and
dire.  This is especially so if the country in question is also
experiencing political instabilities.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>In other words, the challenges associated with domestic macro-economic
management in the face of tightly integrated global financial markets
and instant information are formidable indeed.  This is especially
true in a setting in which adversity in one country can, as we saw in
the Mexican case, have negative consequences for other countries that
are seen, rightly or wrongly, as having similar problems or
vulnerabilities.  Thus, we are left with the vexing question of what
individual countries can do, and what the community of nations can do,
in order to reap the full range of benefits from open trading and
financial systems while providing a greater measure of stability in
the workings of the system.  In the balance of this lecture, I would
like to spell out a number of approaches which I believe can work in
the direction of greater efficiency and greater stability in the
international financial system.

<P>For any country, the key to its economic success over time can be
captured in two words: competitiveness and creditworthiness.  In turn,
a country can achieve and sustain competitiveness and creditworthiness
only to the extent that it achieves and sustains basic discipline in
its monetary and fiscal affairs.  Fortunately, there is now
broad-based recognition of the importance of that basic policy
discipline.  That is why we see so many emerging market countries,
including the Philippines, that have budgets that are in balance or
close to it -- something we cannot say for any of the G-7 countries.
That is also why we see so many countries adopting legislation to make
their central banks independent.

<P>But, as we saw in the Mexican case, a balanced budget and an
independent central bank are necessary, but by no means sufficient,
conditions for success.  That is, the twin goals of creditworthiness
and competitiveness will be achieved only if basic discipline in
monetary and fiscal policies are complemented by the full range of
structural and microeconomic policies that will promote (1) high
domestic savings rates; (2) flexibility in the markets for goods,
services, labor and capital; (3) high rates of productivity growth;
and (4) the development of the human and physical capital
infrastructure essential for sustaining growth and raising standards
of living.

<P>I have neither the time nor the expertise to comment in detail on all
of these areas of endeavor, but I do want to stress several points as
they pertain to the financial side of the equation, as follows:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><STRONG>First</STRONG>, promoting high domestic savings rates is of
special importance not only because high domestic savings reduce
dependence on foreign savings, but also because the very culture of
savings is so central to the psychology of prosperity.  Obviously, the
first and most important thing countries can do to promote high
savings is to keep inflation low.  Well-designed tax policies can also
help, but for many countries, the combination of skewed distributions
of income, demographics, and potentially large, unfunded public
pension liabilities constitute significant barriers to achieving and
maintaining high domestic savings rates.  This is the reason why I
believe that, for many countries, pension reform along the broad lines
of the Chilean or Singaporean models should be given very serious
consideration.  Indeed, pension reform -- which has merit in its own
right -- may be one of the few -- if not the only -- ways that some
countries have even a fighting chance of raising domestic savings
rates.
     
<P><STRONG>Second</STRONG>, generating domestic savings is one thing;
mobilizing those savings and putting them to the best possible use is
quite another.  That is why programs and policies aimed at the
development of efficient, effective and safe domestic banking and
financial systems are so vital.  It is sad but true that in many
transition and emerging market countries, large amounts of precious
savings have been squandered by poor or misguided decisions as to the
individuals, the businesses, or the projects that should receive
credit.  More generally, few things are more central to domestic
economic stability and the efficient use of resources than is the
development of an efficient banking and financial system including all
of the payments and settlement systems infrastructure that are
necessary to support the functioning of the financial system.

<P>As I see it, there are ten characteristics that should be associated with an
effective domestic banking and financial system.  Those characteristics are as
follows:

<OL>

<LI>The presence of a strong and appropriately independent central
bank that relies, to the fullest extent possible, on indirect monetary
policy instruments for the conduct of monetary policy;<P>
        
<LI>Broadly distributed private ownership of banks and other major financial
institutions;<P>
        
<LI>The absence of internal or external credit controls;<P>
        
<LI>Market driven interest rates for both loans and deposits;<P>
        
<LI>A unified foreign exchange rate system, whether the exchange rate
mechanism itself is fixed, floating, or something in between;<P>
        
<LI>The presence of efficient, effective and highly liquid money, equity and debt 
capital markets, starting with state of the art inter-bank and national
government securities markets;<P>
        
<LI>Efficient, safe and trusted payment, delivery, and settlement systems that
ensure the finality of transactions and payments in the shortest time frame
possible;<P>
        
<LI>Transparency in all things, especially market practices and disclosure
practices and policies;<P>
        
<LI>Equal treatment for foreign and domestic institutions and;<P>
        
<LI>A strong but flexible system of prudential supervision of markets and
institutions.<P>

</OL>
     
<P>This checklist of the desirable traits of an effective contemporary
banking and financial system belies the enormous complexities
associated with achieving all that is implied by each one -- much less
all ten -- of the traits.  Take banking supervision as an example.
Simply developing the skilled and experienced personnel to conduct
bank examinations and inspections will take years.
     
<P><STRONG>Third</STRONG>, even in circumstances in which domestic
savings are relatively high and the domestic banking and financial
system is doing a reasonably good job of mobilizing and allocating
those domestic savings, many rapidly developing countries will be net
debtors, especially taking account of foreign liabilities of private
corporations, both financial and non-financial.  In these
circumstances, governmental authorities are, in most cases, going to
have to pay more attention to the level, maturity structure, currency
mix and cash flow implications of their external liabilities.  This
effort must include the development of intermediate and longer-term
strategies for debt management and the development of systematic
approaches for managing interest rate and exchange rate risk,
including the development of appropriately conservative hedging
techniques.  The effort will also have to entail careful monitoring of
developments with regard to the structure and nature of capital
inflows and the careful monitoring of the external liabilities of
private entities.  With regard to the latter, it is important to keep
in mind that there may be circumstances in which the need for domestic
private entities to service their foreign debt can put pressure on the
exchange rate as private debtors scramble to acquire the foreign
currencies needed to meet such obligations.

</BLOCKQUOTE>
     
<P>The steps outlined above -- when combined with sound monetary and
financial policies - - will go a long way toward creating the
financial framework that is consistent with the dual goals of
competitiveness and creditworthiness.  While not the subject of this
lecture, broad-based efforts in other areas of structural policy will
also be needed.  But, even then, the community of nations has a role
to play as well, because the safety and stability of the international
financial system is obviously a collective responsibility.  Allow me,
therefore, to conclude these remarks with a few observations of areas
in which the community of nations can play a role in helping to
strengthen the workings of the international financial system.  In
this regard, I would stress three major points as follows:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>First, all of the G-7 countries must redouble their efforts aimed at
intermediate to longer term deficit reduction.  Collectively, these
deficits are in a huge drain on global savings and are ongoing sources
of congestion and pressure of global capital markets.  Deficit
reduction in the G-7 countries would not only free up large amounts of
savings, but it would also be compatible with greater stability in
financial and foreign exchange markets, thus reducing the risk of
financial shocks more generally.  In the case of the United States,
the prospects for a major breakthrough in this area are more
encouraging than has been the case for years, but we are not yet there
in a setting in which the economics and the politics of the situation
are brutally difficult.
     
<P>Second, there is a pressing need for much closer cooperation and
coordination of official oversight of financial markets and financial
institutions on a global scale.  Clearly, this is an area in which
great progress has been made, particularly through the B.I.S. and its
various committees.  In that regard, it is especially encouraging that
so many countries outside the G-10, including the Philippines, have
voluntarily adopted the B.I.S. capital standards for banks.  This
progress notwithstanding, greater efforts are needed as recent events
such as the Barings and Daiwa Bank episodes so clearly illustrate.
This is why at the Halifax Summit, the Heads of State of the G-7
countries called upon their Finance Ministers to commission studies
and analysis from the international organizations responsible for
banking and securities regulations and to report on the adequacy of
current arrangements, together with proposals for improvement where
necessary, at the next summit
     
<P>One specific area where action is urgently needed is the enactment of
minimum capital standards for market risk by the international
community of banking <EM>and</EM> securities regulators.  Closer to home, I
would suggest that consideration be given to devoting most, if not
all, of the 1996 meeting of the Asian Central Bank Governors to the
subject of strengthening bank supervisory programs and cooperation in
the region.
     
<P>Third, there is a case to be made for an enlarged role for the
I.M.F. in the arena of strengthening the workings of the international
financial system although I am not prepared to go as far as some would
in this regard.
     
<P>At the annual meeting of the Fund, the Managing Director announced a
new initiative whereby the Fund would establish standards according to
which individual countries must release a cross section of economic
and financial data in the interests of greater transparency and
disclosure to financial market participants and others.  This is an
important and highly desirable initiative which will clearly yield
greater discipline on the part of individual countries and greater
discipline on the part of the lending and investing community.  In
this regard, any country that fails to comply with these standards
will be harshly punished by financial markets.  Moreover, while each
individual country will release its own statistics, the press and
various information networks will promptly publish comparative
statistics for all countries.  All of this is to the good in that it
will help markets to more effectively sort out the more, or the less,
creditworthy countries and better allocate capital and savings
accordingly.
     
<P>Some would go further and urge that the Fund s Article IV
Consultations with individual countries be publicly disclosed.  I am
strongly opposed to this partly because it will inevitably create more
political enemies for the Fund, but also because I fear that this
practice would have the wholly counterproductive effect of watering
down the substance of such consultations when, if anything, they
should be made more rigorous.
     
<P>I am also somewhat troubled by the move toward the establishment of
the Emergency Financing Mechanism which is seen as a mechanism to
provide individual countries with faster access to large amounts of
Fund resources in the face of a Mexican- like problem in the future.
The facility contemplates strong conditionality and will be financed
by doubling, to $54 billion, the resources available to the Fund under
the GAB facility.  It is further contemplated that a number of
unspecified countries beyond the G- 10 would participate in the
financing of the facility.  In effect, the facility is a lender of
last resort for sovereign states.
     
<P>My uneasiness about such a facility arises on both practical and
philosophical grounds.  At the level of practicality, I am hard
pressed to see how the obvious need for a very fast trigger mechanism
can be reconciled with the need for strict conditionality, especially
in the face of the painful negotiations that seem to be associated
with drawings on even conventional Fund facilities.  On a more
philosophical level, I am troubled by the clear moral hazard problem
associated with such a facility.
     
<P>On the other hand, I am also deeply troubled by the extent of the
criticism in the US and elsewhere directed at the Mexican rescue
package.  While there may well be aspects of the Mexican episode that
could have been handled differently, the suggestion that the US and
the Fund should have stayed on the sidelines and permitted the chips
to fall where they may strikes me as nave and dangerous.  Be that
as it may, the fact remains that the controversy about the Mexican
rescue package is such that it will be very difficult to muster, on an
ad hoc basis, the resources necessary should a similar episode occur
at another time.  It may also mean that increasing the size of the GAB
and broadening its funding base will be very difficult.
     
<P>In any event, it will take time -- a lot of time -- to muster the
political support needed to increase the GAB to $54 billion.  In that
intervening period, a great deal of very careful thinking needs to be
devoted to exactly how this facility will work in practice.  Depending
on how those details take shape, the scope of the moral hazard problem
could be reduced and my personal comfort level with the approach could
increase.  But, under the best of conditions, this is a slippery
slope.

</BLOCKQUOTE>
     
<P>As you can readily see, the agenda for the future as it applies to
efforts to promote greater stability in the arena of international
finance is very formidable for individual nations and for the
community of nations.  We are, however, in a situation to approach
those challenges from a position of strength.  Here in the Philippines
and in most countries, current economic conditions are quite good.
The international financial system has demonstrated remarkable
resiliency in the face of stress.  Most importantly, the virtually
universal adoption of the market based approach to economics and
economic policy has unleashed fresh elements of individual initiative,
creativity and freedom that offer enormous sources of hope and
expectation for the future.  In short, as we approach the future, with
its problems and its challenges, we have the rare, if not
unprecedented, opportunity to shape our collective destiny in a manner
that can produce broad-based gains in standards of living that can
only enrich the spirit of personal initiative and freedom that has
been unleashed in most of the world.

<P>At this point, ladies and gentlemen, I think I can hear Jobo
whispering in my ear and telling me this lecture is too long.  And, as
usual, Jobo is right.  But I hope Jobo is listening when I say to you
and to him that the opportunity to deliver this lecture in memory of
Jobo is one of the great honors and privileges of my professional
life.

<P>Thank you.

</CENTER>

<P>Mr. Chairman, distinguished guests, and ladies and gentlemen, I am
pleased to have this opportunity to speak to you this morning on the
subject of How Central Banks Manage Financial Crises .  As many of you
know, over the eighties and early nineties, I had more experience in
this field, by a wide margin, than I would have preferred.  That
collective experience has left me with some deeply held views as to
what central banks should do in the face of a major financial
disruption, but also some equally strong views as to what they should
not do.

<P>The approach I will follow this morning will focus on the pragmatic,
not the theoretical, because this is an area in which theory provides
only limited guidance.  Indeed, if there is one dominant theme that
emerges from my experience, it is that each crisis is unique unto
itself and must, to a very considerable degree, be managed on a
case-by-case basis.

<P>There is no conceivable way that this enormously complex subject can
be dealt with in a single address. Thus, I will have to take some
analytical and expositional short-cuts in order to at least broadly
cover the major elements that go into the subject.  For ease of
presentation, I will organize my remarks along the lines of four sets
of observations, each consisting of seven points, and one final set of
observations consisting of ten summary points.

<H2>The First Seven</H2>
     
<P>In order for any central bank to have a measure of success in managing
a financial crisis, it is essential that a broad institutional
framework be in place that provides the tools, the authority, and the
flexibility to deal with problems should they arise.  If properly
structured, this institutional framework also plays an important role
in helping to prevent crises by helping to identify and anticipate
problems before they become serious.  The seven key elements of this
institutional framework are as follows:

<OL>

<LI>A well-defined legal framework setting forth the basic structure
of the banking and financial system that, among other things,
explicitly deals with the all-important question of ownership and
control of banking and other major financial institutions.<P>
       
<LI>A well-defined legal and administrative framework that sets forth the
role of various governmental authorities with respect to the official
supervisory oversight of financial institutions and markets.  Of
particular importance in this regard is the structure and working of
the system of banking supervision.  In my view, the central banks
should always play a major (but not necessarily exclusive) role in the
bank supervisory process, and that process should be fully independent
of any political influence or involvement.  The supervisory system
should encompass the following elements: (1) the development of core
supervisory policy in such areas as capital standards; (2) the
development of detailed procedures for licensing banks and for the
review and approval of major changes in their structure, activities
and ownership; (3) the development of an effective and efficient
system of mandatory and regular reporting of key statistical
information by banks; (4) the development of the capability within the
central bank to undertake rigorous and ongoing analysis of these
statistics in order to better anticipate problems; (5) the development
of a comprehensive program of on- site examination of banks; (6) the
development of regular processes and procedures for reporting to the
banks the results of examinations and other supervisory initiatives;
and (7) the development of procedures for remedying problem bank
situations.<P>
       
<LI>A deposit insurance system which has a suitable limit or cap on
the level of individual deposits which will be guaranteed.  The
deposit insurance fund should be financed by premiums paid by the
banks, but where such insurance funds are new or relatively new, the
initial capitalization will almost always have to come from the
central bank (as it did in the US) or from some other governmental
source.<P>
       
<P>Implicitly or explicitly, the government will stand behind the deposit
insurance fund, but as a practical and philosophical matter, it is
important that the government be as far behind the curtain as
possible.  On the other hand, central banks and/or governments must
retain the flexibility to do the right thing in the face of a truly
systemic problem while not raising the moral hazard problem to a
dangerous level.  To strike the right balance in this regard, central
banks and governments should follow the doctrine of constructive
ambiguity , which implies that the authorities will never commit in
advance as to what they will or will not do in the face of a financial
crisis.  As a general matter, for example, uninsured depositors or
other creditors should not be protected against loss.  However,
circumstances can arise when concerns about the stability of the
system are such that extending such protections may be necessary and
appropriate, but never in circumstances in which the authorities tip
their hand in advance.  However, as a matter of strict public policy,
shareholders and top management should never be protected.<P>
       
<LI>There must be clear authority -- subject to national standards of
due process -- whereby the central bank or the authorities can, if
necessary, force a problem bank to take certain steps to remedy its
problems.  Those steps might include changes in directors and
management, reductions or eliminations of dividends and the sale of
assets.  In the extreme, the authorities should also have the
authority to take over and manage a failing institution until a
permanent solution can be found.  Finally, the authorities should have
the authority to inject fresh capital into seriously troubled
institutions.<P>
       
<LI>The central bank should always have in its possession the formally
executed documents establishing the terms and conditions under which
banks will have access to its lender of the last resort facility.
These documents should be reviewed and updated periodically, and, most
important, the central bank should -- to the fullest extent possible
-- have in its possession the collateral necessary for discount window
borrowings.  In addition, if markets are sufficiently deep and liquid,
the central bank should have well thought out plans whereby it could
provide large-scale liquidity to the system as a whole using open
market operations.<P>
       
<LI>There must be an established institution -- outside the central
bank -- that has the authority and responsibility to liquidate failed
banks.  This task requires a very competent professional staff whose
integrity and fairness is beyond question.<P>
      
<LI>The central bank must have a strong, but informal, intelligence
gathering network.  Here, intelligence is distinguished from
information in that, in the face of a crisis, the central bank will
need all of the insights it can possibly muster in order to aid its
decision making.  This means that top officials of financial
institutions and other market participants must know of and trust
their counterparts in the central bank, and they must also know that
the central bank has the competence to be able to weigh and evaluate
such intelligence as a part of its decision making process.<P>

</OL>

<H2>The Second Seven</H2>

<P>Financial disturbances that can become a financial crisis come in all
shapes and sizes.  A very essential ingredient in managing financial
crises is the ability of the central bank to know, almost
instinctively, the traits in an emerging problem situation that will
complicate the task of managing the problem.  When it comes to the
traits of seriously troubled financial institutions that will make
matters more or less difficult, the following seven stand out:

<OL>

<LI>The issue of ownership of the failing bank or financial
institution and the associated contagion risk problem.  That is, to
the extent that a failing financial institution is owned and
controlled by another entity such as an industrial concern (or
vice-versa), the contagion risk phenomenon is such that the problems
with the failing bank will almost always spill over to the owner, thus
making the damage control process more difficult.  The same is even
more so as it applies to entities owned by the financial institution.<P>
       
<LI>The maturity mix, ownership mix, and currency mix of the bank's
deposits and other liabilities, with particular emphasis on
liabilities to other banks, financial institutions, exchanges,
clearing corporations and foreigners.  From a systemic point of view,
obligations to other financial institutions, which can often be very
large, are of particular concern because of the chain-like credit
linkages they entail.<P>
       
<LI>The extent of the failing institution s direct involvement in
local, national and international payments, clearance and settlement
systems.  This point hardly needs elaboration, except to say that the
central bank should always make it its business to know and understand
the nature of these arrangements for all of its banks all of the time.<P>
       
<LI>The presence, size and financial condition of foreign branches
and/or subsidiaries, with emphasis on the currency mix of the
liabilities of those foreign establishments.  Here, too, it goes
without saying that if foreign establishments of a seriously troubled
bank were to encounter large-scale deposit outflows, the complexities
of managing the situation will rise geometrically.<P>
       
<LI>The scale and complexity of the bank's activities.  The complexity
factor is relevant on several grounds.  For example, the strategy
chosen for dealing with a particular institution will depend
importantly on the central bank being able to make an informed
judgment as to how large the prospective losses are, and the extent to
which those losses are likely to exceed capital.  This is never easy,
but making that judgment in the case of an institution with far-flung
and complex activities is extraordinarily difficult in a setting in
which a major misjudgment as to the nature of those losses (in either
direction) can lead to the wrong choice of strategy at potentially
great cost.  Beyond that, the task of merging or liquidating a bank
with highly complex activities becomes much more complex simply
because the valuation process becomes so much more difficult and
lengthy.  As an example, large and complex off-balance sheet
positions, including but not limited to derivatives, can be a major
obstacle to the valuation and resolution process.<P>
       
<LI>The corporate structure of the failing or failed bank.  Corporate
structure can be a particular problem for large, internationally
active financial institutions since most will be made up of dozens of
legal entities, many of which may be subject to different regulatory
and/or bankruptcy regimes.<P>
       
<LI> The speed with which the crisis occurs.  The speed at which a
crisis occurs is of great importance.  At the risk of
oversimplification, there are two categories of financial crises.
There are the long fuse episodes in which the authorities are able to
see a problem in the making and take steps to contain and minimize its
potential consequences.  But, there are also the short fuse episodes
which, in their worst form, take the form of the telephone call at
2:00 in the morning.<P>

</OL>

<P>Clearly, the short fuse episodes are the most difficult to manage and
pose the greatest danger because, as noted below, they will always
require action in a setting in which information is in very short
supply.  Before turning to those short fuse episodes, let me briefly
outline the steps to be followed by the authorities in the long fuse
case when the authorities have the opportunity to fix the problem or
at least contain the problem before it reaches the crisis stage.  Here
again, I have seven suggestions, as to the steps the authorities
should follow in the setting of the long fuse episode involving one or
more seriously troubled institutions:

<H2>The Third Seven</H2>

<OL>

<LI>Encourage the troubled institution to raise fresh capital.<P>
     
<LI>Encourage the troubled institution to reduce or eliminate
dividends.<P>
       
<LI>Encourage the troubled institution to shrink its balance sheet
with a view toward promptly reducing the most sensitive liabilities.<P>
       
<LI>Encourage the sale of affiliates or subsidiaries and/or selective
lines of business in order to either raise capital or reduce points of
vulnerability, or both.<P>
       
<LI>Actively explore merger possibilities, even those that might
entail some interim governmental financial assistance in the form of
capital injections.<P>
       
<LI>Encourage, if not force, changes in management.<P>
       
<LI>Maintain strict confidentiality while carefully monitoring the situation on a
day-to-day basis.<P>

</OL>

<P>Efforts on the part of the central bank to engage in these early
intervention initiatives presuppose that the central bank has the
capacity to pinpoint specific trouble spots before they get out of
hand.  It also presupposes that there is some reasonable set of
criteria which, when triggered, will allow the central bank to act in
the aggressive manner implied by the early intervention strategy.
Since neither of these conditions may always be present, the
flexibility and the time associated with the long fuse episode is a
luxury which will not always be available.

<P>The short fuse crisis involving a failing financial institution is, as
noted earlier, the most difficult, and, I might add, the most
nerve-racking and demanding problem for any central bank, because the
consequences of a wrong decision can be so serious.  In the absolute
worst case, a decision may have to be made in a matter of hours as to
whether the central bank should take overt steps to contain or cushion
the situation at hand. Often, this decision will have to be made
without knowing for sure whether the institution is facing a liquidity
problem or, in fact, is insolvent.  That threshold decision will also
have to be made in the context of an informed judgment as to whether
the possible failure of one or more institutions has systemic
consequences.

<P>What makes this situation so difficult is, of course, the consequences
of the initial decision.  For example, if the decision is that no
systemic threat is present and that decision turns out to be wrong,
the consequences -- including the consequences for the future
credibility of the central bank-- will be very adverse.  On the other
hand, if the decision is that systemic risk is present, and the
authorities respond by taking extraordinary and <EM>successful</EM> actions,
the authorities may still be harshly criticized in a setting in which
no one will ever know for sure what would have occurred had the
authorities not stepped in.  In other words, that initial decision has
something of a no-win character to it.

<P>In short, faced with the short fuse crisis, the central banker must
recognize that unless he or she is very good, or very lucky, or both,
a large amount of criticism and second-guessing will follow their
actions.  But, if their decision is based on the judgment of no
systemic risk and that judgment is wrong, the consequences can be
catastrophic.  That is why any central banker --as a human being --
will tend to approach these matters very cautiously.  In so doing, I
have seven suggestions that may be helpful in the setting of the
short-fuse crisis.

<H2>The Fourth Seven</H2>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><STRONG>First</STRONG>, while it is obvious, always keep in mind
that doing nothing can be the best response, at least in the very
short run.  But make no mistake about it, doing nothing, either by
design or default, is a response.
     
<P><STRONG>Second</STRONG>, in the face of a crisis, there are no
formulas or black box approaches.  Thus, while contingency planning
has a role, a crisis, by its nature, must be approached on a
case-by-case basis with maximum flexibility, and with a steady eye on
the dangers of setting precedents that could be counterproductive over
time.
     
<P><STRONG>Third</STRONG>, every crisis will be accompanied by a
vacuum of information.  No matter how sophisticated the analytical and
intelligence-gathering capability of the central bank, there will be
important gaps and holes in the information available.  Needless to
say, at the point of a crisis, the central bank does not have the
option of commissioning a study.  The central bank must try to close
the information gaps, but more importantly, it almost certainly will
have to act with less information available to it than it would wish.
     
<P><STRONG>Fourth</STRONG>, in these circumstances, the keys to
effective crisis management will almost always be communications and
cooperation extending to the government, top officials at financial
institutions, market participants, and to fellow central bankers in
other countries.  These crucial elements of communication and
coordination are the most effective ways to gather intelligence, but
also to instill confidence.  Effective communication and coordination,
however, presupposes a very high degree of trust.  For that reason,
the credibility of the central bank and the absolute assurances of
confidentiality on the part of the central bank are vital.
     
<P><STRONG>Fifth</STRONG>, as the central bank considers approaches to
the problem at hand, it should never leave itself in a position where
it does not have a fallback position in mind.
   
<P><STRONG>Sixth</STRONG>, the central bank should be very guarded
about what it says publicly and when it says it.  Premature
pronouncements or press statements can be wholly counterproductive.
     
<P><STRONG>Seventh</STRONG>, the central bank should always leave
itself the option of the <EM>ex-post</EM> review report, which helps
protect against having to answer questions at a point in time when
there will be no such answers.

</BLOCKQUOTE>
     
<P>All of the points made in the four groupings of seven observations
outlined above relate to managing crises that center on seriously
troubled or failing institutions.  There is, of course, another form
of a financial crisis; namely, a market-driven crisis such as the
stock market crash of 1987 or the run on country phenomenon that was
witnessed in Mexico this year.  Clearly, time does not permit me to go
into these particular problems in any detail.  However, three points
seem important, as follows:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><STRONG>First</STRONG>, in a market crisis, it will almost always
be the threat or the reality of credit problems -- including credit
losses induced by the market crisis -- that will trigger the behavior
by individuals and institutions that take the systemic threat to the
point of reality.  Indeed, absent the threat or reality of credit
problems, it is unlikely that institutions will hold back on the
execution of transactions, and without that defensive holding back,
the threat of gridlock in payments, settlement and clearing systems
should be greatly reduced, even in the face of a major fall in the
price of a group or groups of financial assets.  Thus, to the extent a
market crisis has the potential to take on systemic dangers, the
danger point is likely to manifest itself in concerns about the
creditworthiness of individual financial institutions.  In this sense,
much of what has been said earlier will remain relevant in a market
crisis even if there are aspects of market crises not covered in this
address.
     
<P><STRONG>Second</STRONG>, within the category of market crises, the
Mexican-style run on country is a special case.  Except indirectly,
these episodes are not covered in this address.  They are, however,
discussed in some detail in other writings of mine, including the Jose
B. Fernandez, Jr. Memorial Lecture to be delivered in Manila on
October 30, 1995.  Suffice it to say that at this time, the most
important approach to these problems is to avoid them altogether by
having all nations follow sound and disciplined fiscal, monetary,
structural and microeconomic policies.
     
<P><STRONG>Third</STRONG>, whether a crisis has its origins in a major
market move or in failing financial institutions, the single most
important way to insure that it does not take on systemic proportions
is for all nations to aggressively redouble efforts to insure that the
goals of a well-managed, safe, sound and efficient national banking
and financial system are met.  As we have seen all too vividly, even
in the most advanced industrial countries, these goals are very
elusive.  There are, however, certain traits or characteristics of
national banking systems that should be strived for in order to meet
these goals.  The key traits are as follows:

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2>The Final Ten</H2>

<OL>

<LI>The presence of a strong and appropriately independent central bank
that relies, to the fullest extent possible, on indirect monetary
policy instruments for the conduct of monetary policy;<P>
     
<LI>Broadly distributed private ownership of banks and other major
financial institutions;<P>
     
<LI>The absence of internal or external credit controls;<P>
     
<LI>Market driven interest rates for both loans and deposits;<P>
     
<LI>A unified foreign exchange rate system, whether the exchange rate
mechanism itself is fixed, floating, or something in between;<P>
     
<LI>The presence of efficient, effective and highly liquid money,
equity and debt capital markets, starting with state of the art
inter-bank and national government securities markets;<P>
     
<LI>Efficient, safe and trusted payment, delivery, and settlement
systems that ensure the finality of transactions and payments in the
shortest time frame possible;<P>
     
<LI>Transparency in all things, especially market practices and public
disclosure;<P>
     
<LI>Equal treatment for foreign and domestic institutions;<P>
     
<LI>A strong but flexible system of prudential supervision of markets
and institutions.<P>

</OL>

<P>Achieving all that is implied by any one of these traits -- much less
all of them -- is a long and difficult process and even then,
surprises and shocks will occur.  When they occur, central banks must
provide leadership and be ready to act appropriately.  The suggestions
contained in this address -- coming as they do largely from the school
of hard knocks -- may be of some help in framing approaches to
surprises and shocks when they occur.  But, at the end of the day, it
is that great intangible of the credibility of the central bank and
its leaders that will be decisive.  That is why continuity,
competence, independence, and integrity in the ranks of the
international community of central bankers is so crucial.

<P>Thank you.

<STRONG>GOLDMAN SACHS OPENS OFFICE IN S&#195;O PAULO, BRAZIL</STRONG>

<P>NEW YORK -- Goldman, Sachs & Co., the international investment
banking and brokerage firm, has opened an office in S&#227;o Paulo,
Brazil.  It will extend to 32 the number of cities worldwide in which
Goldman Sachs has offices.

<P>Commenting on the announcement, Goldman Sachs Chairman and Senior
Partner Jon S. Corzine said, "Establishing a presence in the
commercial capital of South America's largest industrial economy and
one of the top ten world economies is another important step in our
global strategy.  Brazil has made very significant progress in
instituting economic reforms, and we are extremely pleased to be
participating at this important point in the nation's history."

<P>Eduardo Gentil will manage the firm's operations in Brazil from the
firm's new representative office, which is located at 2020 Brigadeiro
Faria Lima in S&#227;o Paulo.

<P>Mr. Corzine added, "The new S&#227;o Paulo office is part of the
firm's long-term strategy to expand Goldman Sachs' business in Brazil
by establishing a physical presence in the Brazilian marketplace.  We
expect to build on an existing base of business in both traditional
investment banking and in proprietary investment activities.  We are
particularly interested in cross-border equity and debt financing,
mergers and acquisitions, structured finance and project financing for
selected clients.  Goldman Sachs has been active in financial services
activities in Brazil for several years," he explained, "including
participation in merger advisory and capital markets activities, as
well as commodities trading and private client investment services."

<P>Mr. Gentil, who was born and raised in S&#227;o Paulo and is a
Brazilian and U.S.  citizen, added, "Brazil's future, from an
investment perspective, is bright indeed.  We see many sectors of the
economy poised for relatively rapid growth, particularly consumer
goods, food and beverages, telecommunications and infrastructure
industries."

<P>Mr. Gentil holds an M.B.A. from New York University Graduate School
of Business.  A former reporter for the Wall Street Journal in Brazil,
he spent 12 years at J.P. Morgan before joining Goldman Sachs in 1994.

<P>Goldman, Sachs & Co. is a leading international investment banking
and securities brokerage firm participating in major financial markets
on behalf of corporations, institutions, governments, and individuals
worldwide.  Goldman Sachs today has 32 offices worldwide, including 11
in the United States, in New York, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Houston,

<STRONG>
NEW GOLDMAN SACHS STUDY SEES RADICAL RESHAPING OF INVESTMENT
MANAGEMENT BUSINESS UNDERWAY; BELIEVES BY YEAR 2000 THERE WILL BE FEW
MAJORS, SOME NICHE COMPANIES -- MANY NON-SURVIVORS
</STRONG>

<P>NEW YORK -- According to a new study by Goldman, Sachs & Co., the
broad ranging but fragmented investment management business at the
heart of the nation's thriving financial services industry, will
within five years restructure itself and emerge as a handful of
dominant companies, many smaller specialty competitors - and many who
will succumb to pressures of rising costs of asset acquisition and the
inroads of new global competition.

<P>In a major industry analysis released today, Goldman Sachs, the
international investment banking and securities firm, cites both
looming problems and excellent opportunities in store for about 2,900
U.S. pension and endowment managers and mutual fund companies.

<P>Pointing to historic analogies with the once fragmented, now mature
and concentrated automobile and personal computer industries, the
study foresees that the profitable segment of the business will
increasingly be consolidated among major companies and adroit niche
competitors, and some companies may even show striking growth in the
coming consolidation as they develop capabilities to sell products
into foreign markets.  But this concentration will lead to a
significant number of today's investment management companies exiting
the business by the year 2000, the Goldman Sachs study notes.

<P>According to the study, the key characteristics of today's
investment management business are: 1.) excess product manufacturing
capacity, and 2.) the emerging single-world market for asset
management, which will lure heavily-capitalized international
financial institutions into the business with a global range of
products and distribution capability.

<P>Near term, the study notes, competing will be much more difficult
in the next five years than in the past two decades.  The cost of
gathering and retaining assets will rise substantially; managements
must invest heavily in systems and technology, in marketing
capabilities and in new product development.

<P>But opportunities exist for many.  The business will generate
substantial profits; some companies may even grow five-fold in this
consolidation, especially those who find the means to sell into
foreign markets.  This may appear cataclysmic to some, but it is the
natural evolution of any global business.

<P>The study identifies the factors driving this evolution of the
money management business, predicts their impact on participants, and
outlines potential opportunities and strategies for success, including
recommendations for mid-size company growth - or survival: 1.)
developing global investment skills; 2.) creating global distribution
capabilities; and 3.) exploring alliances with strategic partners.

<P>For established niche markets companies, the study counsels
developing products difficult to manufacture - such as private equity
investments in emerging countries or industries, or investments that
are structured to serve smaller, more specialized markets.  Such
companies, the study suggests, must focus their businesses and commit
large investments in research into their strategic planning - in
short, they need to decide which opportunities offer the longest
sustainable advantages and not waste resources on marginal busineses.
Alliances and joint ventures allow desirable pooling of resources,
although inviting problems of cultural barriers and unreasonable
expectations, the study concludes.

<P>Goldman, Sachs & Co. is a leading international investment banking
and securities brokerage firm participating in major financial markets
on behalf of corporations, institutions, governments, and individuals
worldwide.  Goldman Sachs today has 32 offices around the world:
London, New York, Beijing, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Frankfurt, George
Town, Hong Kong, Houston, Los Angeles, Madrid, Memphis, Mexico City,
Miami, Milan, Montreal, Osaka, Paris, Philadelphia, San Francisco,
S&#227;o Paulo, Seoul, Shanghai, Singapore, Sydney, Taipei, Tokyo,
Toronto, Vancouver, Washington, D.C. and Zurich.

US$1.85 trillion at the end of March 1994, is the second-largest in the world and is expected to grow at 10-
15% a year.  However, this won't be enough to match the system's liabilities, she contends.

<P>"Japan is the most rapidly aging nation in the developed world, with 24% of the population expected to 
be over 65 by the year 2015, compared with 17% in Europe and 15% in the U.S.," Matsui says.  "It will not

irrational exuberance now?  No.  The market has gone up because profits have gone up, and stocks 
started the year from undervalued levels."  She expects a 10% growth in profit for the S&P 500, as well

<P>Responding to investor fears over the sustainability of today's stock prices, this article indicates that 
many people may be pleasantly surprised by reserves buried in some corporate balance sheets.  Analysts 
at Goldman Sachs are cited as saying that many write-offs, which wiped billions in book value from 
balance sheets and crushed earnings, appear overly conservative.  Many companies could reduce or 
reverse charges in the next year or two.  Such "write-ons" could provide a cushion to profits in the next 
cyclical downturn.

<P>"And Count Your Cash:  Why Wall Street's Boom Is Still for Real" 

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In an op-ed piece in The Washington Post, Abby Joseph Cohen writes on the reasons behind her belief 
that the bull market in U.S. stocks will continue.  Following is an excerpt:

<P>"This bull market has been one of the best in U.S. history, and is likely to continue, for several good 
reasons:
<P>"First, the economic expansion that has propelled stock prices higher has been one of the most 
durable.  It has been accompanied by mild inflation, job creation and high-quality profit growth.  We've 
dubbed it the "Silly Putty," or stretched-out, cycle and expect it to continue.

<P>"Second, the current economic and market cycles have benefited from several long-term structural 
changes for the better.  These include a notable reduction in the government's budget deficit to less than 
2 percent of national income . . . . from 6 percent in 1991 and an increase in the nation's savings rate.  
Further, the shift to a more sophisticated technology-driven private sector has spurred widespread 
productivity gains and provides new opportunities for growth and jobs.

<P>"Third, this bull market began with stock prices significantly undervalued relative to how well the 
economy and individual companies were performing.  Prices have risen as this gap between favorable 
reality and skeptical investor perceptions was closed. . . . 

<P>"With the bull market entering its seventh year, stocks are no longer undervalued and prices have 
become more volatile. Our recommended portfolio for professional investors now suggests 60 percent in 
equities, compared to 70 to 75 percent in late 1994 and 1995. Yet we believe that further stock price 
gains will be soundly based on the slower-moving but more durable economic expansion that has thus far 
avoided the usual worrisome excesses such as bulging inventories, tight capacity utilization and the 
dreaded inflation that typically follows. . . ."

     clients as Knight-Ridder, Dow Jones, Times Mirror and Seagram, the firm has become
     a contender in this arena, tripling the firm's efforts in these industries.  The firm's
     international advisory role in Deutsche Telekom and France T&#233;l&#233;com's $4.2 billion

<P><IMG SRC="images/hb-sogp.gif" ALT= "Strengthening Our Global Presence" WIDTH=433 HEIGHT=30 BORDER=0> <P>

<P>During 1995, Goldman Sachs continued to strengthen our global
strategy with concrete measures, extending and deepening our
international reach. We consolidated the expertise of our
international management team, announced the establishment of
alliances with prominent local securities firms and opened a new
office in a dynamic emerging market.

<P><FONT SIZE=-1><EM>
Peter Sutherland, Chairman of Goldman Sachs International 
</EM></FONT>

<P>In late 1995, Goldman Sachs welcomed Peter Sutherland, former
Director-General of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the General
Agreement on Tariffs & Trade (GATT) as a partner and Chairman of
Goldman Sachs International. Peter, a native of Ireland, brings an
impressive background in banking, business law and international
trade.  His appointment will strengthen our European operations and
provide us with a uniquely informed perspective on our global
strategy.

<P>Peter was appointed Attorney General of Ireland at age 35 and
served from 1984 through 1989 as Commissioner of the European
Community responsible for Competition Policy. From 1989 through 1993,
he was Chairman of Allied Irish Banks, public limited company and a
director of several other firms. Peter was appointed Director-General
of GATT in 1993 and left his position at the WTO, the successor to
GATT, in May 1995. He is nonexecutive Deputy Chairman of The British
Petroleum Company p.l.c. and a member of the Board of Directors of the
Swedish holding company Investor AB.  Peter succeeded Eugene V. Fife,
who became a limited partner in December 1995.  We are most
appreciative of Gene's 25 years of service. He was a pioneer of the
firm's global strategy and was instrumental in making the firm a major
player in the European financial markets.

		
<P><IMG ALIGN=LEFT ALT="" BORDER=0 SRC="images/p-sogpb.gif" WIDTH=207 HEIGHT=293 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10>
<P><FONT SIZE=-1><EM>
Hideo Ishihara, Chairman of Goldman Sachs (Japan) Ltd.
</EM></FONT>

<P>Peter's appointment complements the 1994 selection of Hideo
Ishihara as a partner and Chairman of Goldman Sachs (Japan) Ltd. Like
Peter, Hideo has brought a wealth of experience and expertise to
Goldman Sachs' global operations. His appointment reflects the firm's
confidence in his abilities and our strategic commitment to the
Japanese market.  One of Japan's most distinguished bankers, Hideo
enjoyed a successful 30-year career with the Industrial Bank of Japan,
Limited.

<P>If the appointments of Peter and Hideo embody Goldman Sachs'
commitment to global presence, so did the 1995 admission of Jim
O'Neill as a partner and Chief Currency Economist. Jim, a native of
the United Kingdom, is one of the world's acknowledged experts in
currency forecasting and strategy. As mentioned in the previous
section, his experience and insight will help the firm and our clients
navigate today's profitable but volatile foreign exchange markets.  In
1995, Goldman Sachs entered into a number of strategic alliances with
securities firms in emerging markets. These include a collaboration
with Kotak Mahindra Capital Company and Kotak Securities, leading
financial services companies in India. We also established
relationships with PT Bahana Pembinaan Usaha Indonesia (Persero), a
major government-owned finance company, and Phatra Thanakit Public
Company Limited, leading Thai merchant bank.

<P>We opened an office in S&#227;o Paulo, Brazil, the commercial capital of
Latin America's largest industrial economy. The opening has extended
to 32 the number of cities around the globe in which Goldman Sachs has
offices.

Jon Corzine (right), Senior Partner and Chairman,<BR> and Hank Paulson, Vice
Chairman and Chief Operating Officer
</EM></FONT>
</CENTER>

<P>Moderate economic expansion joined with strong financial markets
provided excellent business conditions for many of our clients as well
as for Goldman Sachs this past year.  We were pleased that the firm
was well positioned to participate effectively in this robust
environment. We are grateful to our clients for their continued
confidence in us and in our ability to help them meet their
objectives. The strong relationships between our clients and the
people of Goldman Sachs define the essence of our firm.

<P>This year's Annual Review is full of solutions crafted and executed
by our people for the benefit of our clients. Viewed individually,
some are noteworthy for being "firsts," others for complexity and
still others for sheer magnitude. In fact, each is the result of the
intensive focus and expertise we apply to our clients' needs every
day. We look forward to deepening this focus in the months and years
ahead.

<P>In addition to our solid financial performance in 1995, we
completed the transition to a new generation of executive
leadership. We continued this process with governance changes designed
to put the firm on the strong professional and organizational basis we
need to face the competitive and complex world that lies before
us. Goldman Sachs has the most diverse and talented professionals from
around the globe. They demand an organizational structure that gives
them a chance to affect business strategy. We broadened the firm's
governing base to foster wider participation in decision making and to
develop future leaders. Specific changes implemented at the beginning
of fiscal 1996 include the establishment of a smaller Executive
Committee to succeed the Management Committee, and the creation of a
Partnership Committee and an Operating Committee designed to address
professional and business issues, respectively. We would like to thank
several of the firm's senior leaders for their selfless cooperation in
shaping this initiative.

<P>While superintending the various changes in 1995, we have
maintained the firm's focus on attracting and retaining the most
talented, serious and dedicated people from around the world. We
acknowledge the character and perseverance our people exhibited as the
firm completed the consolidation process begun in 1994. Making certain
that this unique team of people works seamlessly across time zones,
business lines and geographical borders for the benefit of our clients
is our most important managerial challenge. A one-firm culture
committed to a collaborative effort is our competitive edge.

<P>As we already said, the firm was well positioned through its
strategy of broad diversification by function, products and geography
to capture the many opportunities of 1995. High volume and activity in
global equity markets, new issue equity offerings, and global mergers
and acquisitions together with rising values in our merchant banking
portfolios contributed to the firm's good results. All of these
activities are core elements of the Goldman Sachs franchise, and this
performance reflects a commitment to excellence and leadership by the
people running these businesses. The same self-directed commitment to
excellence is a part of each of the diverse business lines of the
firm.

<P>This year's successes also reflect the firm's vision and investment
in earlier years. In 1995, we continued to invest significantly in
people and technology and to expand our global footprint. We have
established strategic alliances in India, Indonesia and Thailand.  We
opened and staffed an office in Sao Paulo. We initiated our primary
dealerships in France and Italy. We invested significantly in
corporate and economic research on a global basis. We renewed our
preeminence in foreign exchange research by admitting Jim O'Neill as a
partner to lead this crucial effort. Several other initiatives are
under way. Investing today is key to serving our clients tomorrow.

<P>In the closing months of 1995, Goldman Sachs began an in-depth
review of our capital structure and a study of various options for the
future. With our optimism about future business conditions and a wide
array of opportunities before us, we wanted to be certain of our
financial strength and capacity. At the conclusion of our study in
January 1996, the firm's partners enthusiastically reaffirmed our
desire to remain a private partnership. With nearly $5 billion in
capital, a strong liquidity position, a strengthened risk management
system, reengineered planning and budgeting processes, and a
consolidated expense structure, the partners are confident in our
capacity and strength to meet the challenges ahead. We believe Goldman
Sachs has firmly in place the foundation on which to build our future
growth.

<P>Goldman Sachs will also remember 1995 with sadness as we reflect on
the loss of our partner Fischer Black. Fischer died on August 20 after
a long struggle with cancer. One of the foremost scholars in financial
theory, he left as a lasting contribution the Black-Scholes Model,
which determined the theoretical value of an option and paved the way
for commercial options trading. He was also the co-developer of the
Black-Litterman Global Asset Allocation Model. The world of
theoretical finance has not only lost a giant but all who knew Fischer
will miss an irreplaceable friend.

<P>In closing, we are enthusiastic about leading this great firm as
this remarkable century approaches its end. Working for and with our
clients - working for and with the people of Goldman Sachs - is an
honor. We thank all of you for your loyalty and support.

<H3>Global Integration of Research</H3>

<P>We increased our emphasis on developing coordinated analysis of
economies, markets, industries and companies to keep pace with the
growing interconnection of financial markets worldwide. Our goal is to
provide clients with information that clearly and concisely
synthesizes several factors that can affect investment decisions on a
global basis.  We are particularly focused on anticipating and
tracking trends and opportunities across international markets. For
the year, we covered more than 1,700 companies and were one of the few
securities firms to have its equity research among the highest rated
in leading polls in the U.S., Europe and Japan. Our portfolio
strategists continue to be among the most highly rated in worldwide
surveys.

<H3>Expanded Industry Analysis and Merchandizing Focus</H3>

<P>Our firm is meeting increased needs among major institutions and
corporations for more in-depth industry expertise on a regional and
global basis. This effort further extends our growing ability to
provide truly global industry coverage. To facilitate research in
Southeast Asia, we are expanding our research presence from Hong Kong
and Tokyo to Singapore. We initiated analysis of Indian and Taiwanese
markets as well as regional coverage of the utility, energy and
telecommunications sectors. In Japan, we expanded our coverage in the
automotive and chemicals sectors, initiated analysis of the
semiconductor equipment industry and began publication of the <EM>Japan
MarketFlash</EM>, a daily fax product that quickly became a key tool for
investors, and the <EM>Japan ResultsFlash</EM>, a timely report on company
performance. And we introduced a wide array of portfolio strategy
reports in Japan. We also expanded coverage in Latin America to
include conglomerates, infrastructure and consumer products. In
Europe, we added several sectors to our coverage, including utilities
and automobiles. Within the U.S., we established a merchandizing
manager position to more effectively distribute our research to
clients.

<H3>Real-Time Access to Research Via the Internet</H3>

<P>Institutional and private clients worldwide will soon be able to
access Goldman Sachs' complete global investment research through the
Internet by using the firm's proprietary
<EM>ResearchXpress<SUP>SM</SUP></EM>. This new service, an enhancement
of <EM>The Research Portable Lite</EM>, delivers research to desktop
computers using Internet-browsing technology. Clients can view and
print out research publications or retrieve specific types of
information based on certain criteria.

<H2><A NAME="eco">Economic Analysis</A></H2>

<H3>Worldwide Team Delivers Coordinated Coverage</H3>

<P>Goldman Sachs economists were organized globally into a single team
to provide clients participating in international securities and
currency markets with highly integrated research on economies, credit
and foreign exchange. Our Asian coverage was broadened with the
introduction of the <EM>Asia Economic Weekly</EM> and the <EM>Asia Economic
Quarterly</EM>, which provide detailed analysis as well as our expectations
on a country and regional basis. Our coverage in Japan expanded to
include dedicated analysis of the Bank of Japan, publication of the
<EM>Japan EconomicFlash</EM> and launch of the <EM>Financial Market Weekly</EM>. The
firm's economists continued to be among the highest rated in U.K. and
international economics and bond strategies as well as worldwide
currency forecasting.

<H2><A NAME="fi">Fixed Income</A></H2>

<H3>Insight and Ideas Support Broad Range of Portfolio Objectives</H3>

<P>We significantly expanded our already strong commitment to the
development of state-of-the-art quantitative models for pricing,
hedging and valuing fixed income securities and derivative
instruments. Particular emphasis was placed on developing and refining
our next generation of yield curve models, which are a key component
of our approach to isolating relative value opportunities in
government bond and interest rate swap markets worldwide. Our research
on corporate bond credit, communicated through weekly faxes as well as
publications, was expanded to additional industries and issuers of
investment- grade and high-yield securities. Continued improvements to
our prepayment models and strategy solidified our leadership in
mortgage securities research. In the yen markets, our analytical and
strategy coverage of the Japanese government bond market was
complemented by an increased focus on corporate issues. In addition,
we continued to enhance the risk management advisory services that we
offer investing and issuing clients through our proprietary
Black-Litterman Global Asset Allocation Model and Multicurrency
Liability Management Model.

<H3>Heightened Emphasis on Managing Exposures for Clients Worldwide</H3>

<P>We drew on our expertise as a leading trader and market maker in
major currencies worldwide to expand our consultative, research-based
approach to managing risks for corporations, international equity and
debt portfolio managers, governments and private clients
worldwide. Using proprietary analytical models, we created asset and
liability risk management tools that provided an efficient means to
hedge risks across multiple currencies. We continued to be a leader in
developing customized options strategies, expanding opportunities for
clients to accomplish hedging and investment goals and providing
liquidity to counterparties. Our focus on the currency issues of local
and international companies as well as institutions was heightened in
Europe as well as in Asia, where we were increasingly active in
hedging currency risk.

<H2><A NAME="commod">Commodities</A></H2>

<H3>Specialized Hedging Vehicles Developed for Producers and Consumers</H3>

<P>Applying global market perspective, state-of-the-art modeling and
expertise in derivative products, we made a concerted effort to assist
clients in managing price risk in markets for base and precious
metals, crude oil, petroleum products, natural gas and agricultural
products. As an example of our work, we developed a series of options
transactions that enabled a major European producer to lock in an
enhanced forward price for crude oil. For a North American base metals
consumer, we helped to ensure against unusual spikes in an underlying
base metal on a multiyear basis by using a combination of swaps and
options.  We developed innovative structured transactions that enabled
oil companies to monetize the margins associated with various spreads
and cracks while providing attractive inventory financings.

<H3>Significant Growth in Commodity-Oriented Portfolio Management</H3>

<P>Open interest and trading volume on the GSCI futures contract
listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange reached record levels as
major institutions initiated commodity investment portfolios.  There
was also a dramatic increase in the use of the GSCI by investment
managers as the benchmark to diversify portfolios through
commodity-related investment. For example, Harvard Management Company,
Inc., responsible for investing Harvard University's endowment, has
invested a portion of the $7 billion fund in commodities and uses the
GSCI as a benchmark.

<H2><A NAME="eq">Global Equity Markets</A></H2>

<H3>Comprehensive Services to Meet Growing Interest in Global Investment</H3>

<P>The opening of our new trading facility in New York was but one of
many steps we took to ensure that Goldman Sachs continues as a
preeminent resource for distribution, liquidity, risk management and
support services in equity markets worldwide. We expanded our
research, distribution and trading in local markets and further
broadened opportunities for clients by combining these capabilities
with our global expertise and execution skills. As the leader in
bringing equity issues to market worldwide, including issues related
to privatizations and initial public offerings (IPOs), we provided
clients with investment opportunities in some of the world's largest
corporations as well as in dynamic growth companies. Our private
client services activities, which include a major Swiss banking arm,
served a greater number of individual and family clients worldwide
than ever before. We also broadened the scope of our financing,
securities lending and prime brokerage services for global investors.

<H2><A NAME="eqderiv">Equity Derivatives</A></H2>

<H3>Key Resource in Volatile and Uncertain Markets</H3>

<P>As equity derivatives markets reacted to currency fluctuations and
disruptive events, an increasing number of institutions and
corporations worldwide turned to Goldman Sachs to develop strategies
using listed futures and options and over-the-counter (OTC) options to
manage risk. Working with new and existing clients, we used our
strengths in research, trading and distribution to maintain a
leadership position in index futures and options. We continued to be
in the forefront of facilitating international portfolio strategies by
using derivatives. Among our transactions, we completed the largest
global portfolio restructuring to date for a U.K.  pension fund. We
assisted many large clients in protecting the gains made on their U.S.
equity portfolios. The firm was also very active in the established
markets of Japan and in the burgeoning markets of Southeast Asia.

<H2><A NAME="euro">U.K. and European Shares</A></H2>

<H3>Broad Equity Market Strengths Facilitate Major Transactions</H3>

<P>Indicative of the quality of our research, sales and trading
capabilities was our selection to play the key role in some of
Europe's largest equity offerings. We acted as global coordinator and
lead manager for the $925 million secondary offering of British Sky
Broadcasting Group plc.  For Commerzbank AG, we were joint global
coordinator and lead manager of a $728 million global equity
offering. We also acted as global coordinator, lead manager or both
for significant transactions related to privatizations or IPOs for,
among others, Repsol, S.A., SAP AG, Fila Holding S.p.A. and Nordbanken
AB.

<H2><A NAME="japan">Japanese Equity Products</A></H2>

<H3>Consistent, Value-Added Support in Turbulent Markets</H3>

<P>The Kobe earthquake, dramatic appreciation of the yen and
disruption in derivatives markets early in the year created
significantly more volatility in Japanese equity markets than in
1994. We assisted Japanese institutional investors in developing
creative ways to hedge portions of their equity portfolios using
derivatives, and we structured transactions that enabled corporations
as well as institutions to unwind crossholding
positions. Additionally, applying our global expertise in research,
trading and distribution to convertible bonds, warrants and index
derivatives, we were in the forefront of assisting investors to
achieve their goals in the yen convertible bond market and in Nikkei
225 and 300 futures and options, and in TOPIX options.

<H2><A NAME="asian">Asian Shares</A></H2>

<H3>Significant Expansion Into Regional Markets</H3>

<P>We established around-the-clock sales, trading and market making in
Asian shares and global depositary receipts. Close operating links
were formed with prominent local securities firms. We invested in and
established strategic alliances with Kotak Mahindra Capital Company
and Kotak Securities, a member of the Bombay Stock Exchange and the
National Stock Exchange. We also formed an operating alliance with
Phatra Thanakit Public Company Limited in Thailand and PT Bahana
Pembinaan Usaha Indonesia (Persero) in Indonesia, enabling much
greater research and brokerage cooperation. Also, we completed block
trades for clients in such securities as P.T. Telekomunikasi Indonesia
(Persero), P.T. Indonesian Satellite Corporation (Indosat), Pacific
Basin Bulk Shipping Limited and Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.

<H2><A NAME="latin">Latin American Equities</A></H2>

<H3>Liquidity Challenges Met Under Adverse Conditions</H3>

<P>Mexico's financial crisis reverberated in Latin America, reducing
the volume of trading and presenting serious liquidity problems for
many investors. We maintained our presence as a leading market maker,
facilitating our clients' investment needs. Notable block trades in
securities such as Cifra, S.A. de C.V., YPF Sociedad An&#243;nima,
Telecomunica&#231;oes Brasilieras S.A. - TELEBR&#193;S, Grupo Televisa, S.A.,
Cemex, S.A. de C.V. and Vitro, Sociedad An&#243;nima contributed to our top
ranking by AutEx for Latin American ADRs in 1995.

<H2><A NAME="fi">Fixed Income Securities</A></H2>

<H3>Worldwide Perspective Yields Opportunities in All Key Markets</H3>

<P>Goldman Sachs provided opportunities worldwide as one of the few
firms that is integrally involved in investment flows within and
between key markets. Our unified approach to market coverage included
economic, currency and fixed income research as well as expertise in
trading, underwriting and derivatives. As interest rates declined in
the U.S., we became active in hedging exposures for insurance
companies and in repackaging mortgage assets.  Investors benefited
from our leadership in markets for taxable government and corporate
bonds, mortgage and mortgage-related securities, asset-backed
structures, money market instruments, high-yield debt and tax-exempt
securities. Clients also capitalized on our prominence in underwriting
global bond and Eurobond offerings, our growing role in domestic
deutsche mark and yen markets, and our strength in arranging global
debt private placements and making markets for commercial and
industrial loans and real estate credits.

<H2><A NAME="fideriv">Fixed Income Derivatives</A></H2>

<H3>Facilitation of Asset Allocation and Liability Management Goals</H3>

<P>Investors and borrowers turned to Goldman Sachs for support in using
OTC derivatives as an efficient means of managing interest rate and
currency risks. With declining interest rates and an active merger
market, we assisted U.S. corporations in hedging interest rate risks
prior to tapping the capital markets. We also developed hedges
designed to help buyers and sellers of mortgages manage their
risk. Our work with U.S. and European financial institutions expanded
in the evolving area of credit derivatives, which capitalize on
different credit ratings and the spread between corporate and
U.S. Treasury bonds. We assisted European borrowers in the power,
water and other public sectors to raise capital at attractive rates
through the issuance of structured debt products. In Asia, our
activities included assisting money managers and insurance companies
to use derivatives as a means to express investment views.

<H2><A NAME="special">Special Investments</H2>

<H3>Unique Products Address Asset Allocation and Return Objectives</H3>

<P>Innovative, high- quality funds and structured products are developed
that enable clients to invest in unique opportunities with attractive
risk/return trade-offs. Two investments offered in 1995 involved
co-investing with Goldman Sachs. GS Capital Partners II, L.P. makes
privately negotiated long-term equity and equity-related investments,
including some through mezzanine financings, leveraged buyouts and
corporate recapitalizations. GS Emerging Market Real Estate Fund,
L.P. is focused on properties and companies in Latin America and
Southeast Asia. In addition, the Meadowbrook Equity Fund, L.L.C. was
created as a joint venture with Bessemer Trust Company, N.A. to allow
investors to gain diversification for large single stock positions in
a tax-efficient manner. Among the structured products offered were
Brady bull notes, which provided exposure to the Brady bonds of
Argentina, Brazil and Mexico without the volatility normally
associated with emerging market investments. U.S. dollar bull notes
were designed to allow investors to participate in the dollar's
appreciation against the yen, and Nikkei 225 Indexed Notes gave
investors leveraged participation on the Nikkei 225 while offering
protection of principal.

<H2><A NAME="swiss">Swiss Banking</A></H2>

<H3>Expertise in Serving Investors Outside the U.S.</H3>

<P>Significant growth in assets for Goldman, Sachs & Co. Bank
reflected expanded capabilities to provide investment management and
custody services for investors in Asia, Latin America and Europe. The
discretionary asset management team, which draws on Goldman Sachs'
worldwide resources, began serving institutional investors in addition
to private clients. Further, the Bank increased its presence as an
active participant in derivatives trading on the Z&#252;rcher
B&#246;rse and continued to be at the vanguard of multicurrency
investing and reporting.

<H2><A NAME="gss">Global Securities Services</A></H2>

<H3>Provided Comprehensive Services for Global Investors</H3>

<P>Securities lending, financing, operational and administrative
services were provided to major institutional and private investors
worldwide, building global portfolios of equities, bonds, currencies
and derivatives. We were a key resource for stock loan, financing,
prime brokerage and offshore fund administration services. Our
securities lending expertise allowed us to service the needs of a
growing number of investors and act as one of the largest
intermediaries between borrowers and lenders of equity securities. We
continued to roll out an innovative on-line system that enables prime
brokerage clients to better manage their portfolios and interact
electronically with the firm.

<H2><A NAME="pension">Pension Services</A></H2>

<H3>Coordinated Firmwide Expertise to Achieve Clients' Varied Objectives</H3>

<P>We coordinated the firm's global resources to assist more than 50
pension funds, endowments and foundations in applying financial
techniques to address their individual objectives. We advised the
trustee of the pension plan for a major U.S. industrial company in
connection with the largest ever contribution of stock by a
corporation to its pension plan. This nearly $6 billion contribution
substantially improved the funding status of the plan. We assisted a
U.S. medical research endowment with a portfolio heavily concentrated
in a single stock to diversify in domestic and international equity
markets. Through trades involving an international portfolio of bonds
and 560 stocks of companies in 21 countries, we enabled a major
London-based international chemical company to cost-effectively
restructure its &#163;2.4 billion global pension portfolio. Indicative
of our services to investment management companies was our publication
of the research report <EM>The Coming Evolution of the Investment
Management Industry</EM>.

<H2><A NAME="gsam">Asset Management</A></H2>

<H3>Growing Recognition as a Premier Manager of Institutional Assets</H3>

<P>Goldman Sachs Asset Management (GSAM) provided a range of services
to a growing base of sophisticated institutional clients, including a
number of the world's largest private and public pension plans,
corporations, central banks and governmental entities. As a global
asset manager, we afforded our clients opportunities that spanned the
equity, fixed income and currency markets of the Americas, Europe and
Asia. For the year, our actively managed international equity products
significantly outpaced their respective benchmarks, and the composites
of our U.S. quantitative select equity and U.S. core fixed income
portfolios continued to outperform their respective benchmarks. Among
other significant business developments, we were awarded new mandates
from The Pension Welfare Service Public Corporation (Nenpuku), the
Japanese social system pension plan, and Algemeen Burgerlik
Pensioenfunds (ABP), the largest pension plan in Holland. We continued
to make U.S. mutual funds available to individual and institutional
investors through a distribution network that includes major regional
brokerage firms and our firm's PCS professionals. GSAM completed the
year with approximately $55 billion in assets under management as
investment advisor, administrator or distributor.

<H2><A NAME="pub">Public Company Financing</A></H2>

<H3>Expansion of Capital Sources for Public Companies</H3>

<P>Numerous real estate companies that had become public in recent
years were assisted by the firm in accessing a wide range of public
markets to meet funding objectives. For the year, we lead managed 60
offerings of common stock, straight debt, medium-term notes and
preferred stock totaling $3.1 billion in proceeds. Our clients
included CBL & Associates Properties Inc., Federal Realty Investment
Trust, General Growth Properties, Inc., Meditrust, MEPC plc,
Nationwide Health Properties Inc., The Rouse Company, Security
Capital, Spieker Properties, Inc., Storage USA, Inc., Weeks
Corporation and Weingarten Realty Investors.

<H2><A NAME="strat">Strategic Advisories</A></H2>

<H3>Industry Consolidations Facilitated by Real Estate and Merger Expertise</H3>

<P>By combining our expertise in real estate public markets and in
mergers and acquisitions, we are well positioned as the real estate
industry moves toward consolidation. In 1995, we advised Sears,
Roebuck and Co. in divesting the assets of its Homart Development Co.
real estate subsidiary, which totaled $2.3 billion. We advised
Citibank, N.A. and Alexander's, Inc. on the sale of Citibank's
minority interest in Alexander's to Vornado Realty Trust.

<H2><A NAME="hosp">Hospitality, Leisure and Gaming</A></H2>

<H3>Specialized Effort Focuses Firmwide Resources</H3>

<P>We brought together specialists in our firm's real estate,
corporate finance and mergers areas to provide highly coordinated
services to the global hospitality, leisure and gaming sectors.

<H2><A NAME="rep">Tenant Representation</A></H2>

<H3>Meeting Large, Complex Occupancy Needs</H3>

<P>A significant portion of our activities continued to be in the New
York City area, and we increased our focus on major cities in
California and elsewhere in the U.S.

<H2><A NAME="pia">Principal Investments</A></H2>

<H3>A Leading Source of Real Estate Investment Capital Worldwide</H3>

<P>The Whitehall Street Real Estate Limited Partnerships, with
approximately $2 billion in committed capital, are focused on
recovery-related investments and strategic opportunities in North
America and Europe. Since 1991, we have acquired almost 3,000 assets
totaling over $13.6 billion in gross purchase price with a variety of
strategic partners, many of which are clients of the firm. In 1995,
Whitehall closed 17 investments, including 11 bulk sale portfolios
containing more than 460 assets. After providing a $225 million
participating loan to Rockefeller Center Properties, Inc. (RCPI) with
the Goldman Sachs Mortgage Company, Whitehall later agreed to
purchase, along with an investor group, the common shares of RCPI for
$8 per share. In other recent transactions, Whitehall and Westmont
Hospitality purchased Alliance H&#244;tellerie S.A., a French hotel
chain; Whitehall acquired a stake in the Westin Hotel Company; and in
the first bulk sale of distressed real estate by a major Canadian
bank, Whitehall purchased a portfolio of real estate assets with a
book value of approximately $450 million. In a recapitalization,
Whitehall acquired 22 percent of The Cadillac Fairview Corporation
Limited, a major Canadian and U.S. mall owner, for approximately $130
million. We also formed the GS Emerging Market Real Estate Fund,
L.P. with committed capital of $375 million to invest in real estate
opportunities in Asia and Latin America.

<H2><A NAME="debt">Accessing Equity and Debt Capital</A></H2>

<H3>Opportunities Presented Across the Capital Structure</H3>

<P>We provided users of capital with attractive alternatives worldwide
to meet their funding requirements. Our comprehensive, integrated
capabilities spanned the full range of securities offerings in public
and private equity and fixed income markets and included rapidly
expanding corporate loan services. For the year, Goldman Sachs lead or
co-managed 1,347 public and private equity and long-term debt
offerings totaling approximately $299 billion. The firm was agent in
198 public and private medium-term note programs totaling
approximately $451 billion in filings and had record commercial paper
outstandings of over $127 billion. As lead agent, we structured,
underwrote and syndicated 11 senior loans totaling $5.2 billion.

<H2><A NAME="eqissue">Equity Issues</A></H2>

<H3>Leadership in Managing Transactions Worldwide</H3>

<P>From large, multimarket transactions to sophisticated
privatizations, initial public offerings (IPOs), secondary offerings
and innovative convertible transactions, Goldman Sachs was in the
forefront of bringing issuers to the equity markets. In the U.S. we
assisted many companies in taking advantage of the vibrant stock
market. We lead managed 36 IPOs with a total value of $6.7 billion - 
more than any other firm. Other highlights included joint lead
managing for General Motors Corporation a $1.8 billion Class E issue
and a $577 million Class H issue.  For Commerzbank AG, we were joint
global coordinator and lead manager for a $728 million offering that
marked the first primary offering of German equity without preemptive
rights to be marketed globally through a bookbuilding process. We were
also global coordinator and lead manager of a $200 million secondary
offering for Fila Holding, S.p.A. The firm was global coordinator of a
$234 million offering for Aracruz Celulose S.A. Goldman Sachs has been
the number one lead manager of Asian common stock offerings since 1990
according to <EM>World Equity</EM>. In 1995, we lead managed global
depositary receipt offerings of $150 million for Samsung Electronics
Co., Ltd. and $80 million for GVC Corporation.

<H2><A NAME="ipo">IPOs</A></H2>

<H3>Lead Manager of Five of the Six Largest Offerings</H3>

<P>We lead managed the $1.3 billion IPO of Nabisco Holdings Corp., a
wholly owned subsidiary of RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. For the $1.2
billion offerings of The PMI Group, Inc., a mortgage insurance concern
owned by The Allstate Corporation, we developed an innovative
simultaneous IPO of PMI common stock and Allstate notes exchangeable
into PMI common stock in three years. This transaction achieved an
attractive price by appealing to distinct groups of investors. Our
other major IPOs included offerings of $838 million for Prudential
Reinsurance Holdings, Inc.; $725 million for Intimate Brands, Inc.,
which arose out of the restructuring of The Limited, Inc.; and $520
million for Borders Group, Inc., a book retailer that had been owned
by Kmart Corporation. Also in the U.S., we lead managed a $455 million
offering for The Est&#233;e Lauder Companies Inc. Highlighting our
activities in Europe, we were global lead manager and joint lead
manager in Germany for the $175 million offering of Tarkett AG,
Europe's largest resilient and hardwood flooring company.  In Asia, we
were international coordinator and lead manager of the $450 million
offering of Lihir Gold Limited, a Papua New Guinean gold mining
company. This was the largest IPO ever by a gold company and the first
IPO simultaneously registered in Australia and the U.S. We were
international coordinator and lead manager of a $178 million offering
for Pilipino Telephone Corporation (Piltel), the leading cellular
telecommunications company in the Philippines.

<H2><A NAME="hightech">High Technology</A></H2>

<H3>Leadership in Bringing Growth Companies to the Equities Markets</H3>

<P>In 1995, we lead managed 21 offerings for preeminent high
technology companies - more than half of them IPOs - with an aggregate
value in excess of $4.2 billion. Among the IPOs we lead managed were
offerings for UUNET Technologies, Inc., an Internet access company;
Tivoli Systems Inc. and Baan Company N.V., both client-server software
companies; VideoServer, Inc., a provider of networking equipment and
software used to create multimedia conferences; and General Magic,
Inc., a developer of object-oriented software platform
technologies. We also lead managed significant secondary offerings for
such technology leaders as Gateway 2000, Inc., Shiva Corporation, FORE
Systems, Inc. and General Instrument Corporation, all of which we had
previously brought public, and sole managed a $110 million private
equity placement for SAP AG, the leading German client- server
software company.

<H2><A NAME="private">Privatizations</A></H2>

<H3>Central Role in Key Transactions in Europe, the Americas and Asia</H3>

<P>We played a central role in a number of the year's most important
privatizations. We were joint global coordinator and U.S. and
international lead manager for the $1.7 billion privatization of
Canadian National Railway Company, the state-owned railroad
company. This was the largest privatization ever in Canada and the
first time a non-Canadian investment bank received the global
coordinator role. We were joint global coordinator, U.S. lead manager
and co-lead manager in other international markets for the $1.7
billion offering of Repsol, S.A. This transaction, the third
international offering in the company's privatization, was named a
deal of the year by five leading business publications. For
P&#233;chiney, the aluminum and packaging group, we were joint lead
manager globally, U.S. lead manager and advisor for a $1 billion
offering that marked the first time in a decade that the French
government had selected a non-French firm as a key advisor for a major
privatization. Also in Europe, we were lead manager of the
U.S. portion and advisor to the company on the $1 billion partial
privatization of Nordbanken AB, the Swedish bank, and joint lead
manager for the U.S. portion of the $4.5 billion offering of ENI -
Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi S.p.A. - the state-owned oil and gas
company of Italy. We entered 1996 with a mandate to be co- global
coordinator and U.S. lead manager in the privatization of Deutsche
Telekom AG.

<H2><A NAME="lbo">Leveraged Buyouts (LBOs)</A></H2>

<H3>Varied Strategies Support Liquidity Objectives of LBO Firms</H3> 

<P>Goldman Sachs was the leader in structuring and executing primary
and secondary equity issues for leveraged buyout firms. We were the
sole underwriter of two block trades totaling more than $1.3 billion
for Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. that enabled our client to complete
the sale of its ownership in RJR Nabisco. We assisted Kelso & Co.,
Inc. in liquefying a significant portion of its position in American
Standard Companies Inc. through a $681 million secondary offering,
having lead managed the company's $302 million IPO six months
earlier. For Forstmann Little & Co., we lead managed secondary
offerings of $536 million of General Instrument and $216 million of
Department 56, Inc., a maker and merchandiser of Christmas novelty
items. Other transactions included lead managing the $394 million IPO
of Lexmark International Group, Inc. for Clayton, Dubilier & Rice,
Inc. Our ability to support the objectives of LBO firms reflected the
firm's broad-based expertise and creative initiative in leveraged
finance, mergers and principal investing.

<H2><A NAME="conv">Convertible Securities</A></H2>

<H3>Innovation Drives Leadership in Issuance of Hybrid Equities</H3>

<P>For the year, we lead managed 13 U.S. issues aggregating $3.1
billion. We followed up our development of convertible MIPS<SUP>TM/SM</SUP>
(monthly income preferred shares) in 1994 by introducing automatic
common exchange securities, which package the forward sale of common
stock with U.S. Treasury securities. A $410 million offering that we
lead managed for Browning-Ferris Industries, Inc. marked the first
transaction employing this new type of mandatory convertible
security. We lead managed convertible MIPS offerings of $250 million
for American General Corporation, $207 million for St. Paul Bancorp,
Inc. and $200 million for Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corporation. We
executed five "overnight convertibles" that permitted issuers to raise
capital at attractive terms while avoiding market exposure. Offerings
included $350 million for Federated Department Stores, Inc.  and $300
million for Staples, Inc. In Europe, we were joint bookrunner and
joint lead manager of a $550 million convertible bond issue for AXA
S.A.

<H2><A NAME="euro">Eurobonds</A></H2>

<H3>Worldwide Distribution Facilitates Offerings</H3>

<P>Reflecting our leadership position in the Eurobond markets, Goldman
Sachs was named Eurodollar House of the Year by <EM>International
Financing Review</EM>. A number of clients, including major
U.S. corporations, turned to Goldman Sachs to achieve competitive
pricing in the Eurodollar sector. Of particular note was a $500
million issue lead managed for Merck & Co., Inc. that marked the
largest 10-year Eurodollar transaction to date by a
U.S. corporation. We also lead managed Eurobond offerings of $400
million for AT&T, $200 million for Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and $200
million for Eli Lilly and Company. Among our transactions for
sovereigns and supranationals, we lead managed a $500 million offering
for the Kingdom of Belgium and joint-lead managed a $500 million
offering for the Inter-American Development Bank. Other key
transactions included lead managing issues of $250 million for
Prudential Corporation plc, the largest insurance company in the U.K.,
and $200 million for International Telecommunications Satellite
Organization, the Washington- based agency. We were also joint lead
manager of a $300 million issue for The Chugoku Electric Power
Company, Incorporated of Japan.

<H2><A NAME="global">Global Bonds</A></H2>

<H3>Capital Raised Through Alternative Structures</H3>

<P>Goldman Sachs was joint lead manager for the first two subordinated
bank transactions in the global market, a $1 billion offering for ABN
AMRO Bank N.V. that was the largest global issue to date by a Dutch
entity, and a $750 million offering for Abbey National plc. We also
played a leading role in reintroducing callable global
transactions. We were lead manager of a $500 million offering and
joint lead manager of another $500 million offering for Fannie Mae as
well as two $500 million offerings for the Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Corporation.

<H2><A NAME="usdebt">U.S. Debt Financings</A></H2>

<H3>Companies Capitalize on Broadened Opportunities</H3>

<P>In an environment of economic growth, modest inflation and
declining interest rates, we assisted major corporate issuers in
returning to the U.S. bond market to obtain attractive long-term
financing and to fund mergers, acquisitions and
spin-offs. Strategic-related financings included lead managing a $2
billion issue for American Home Products Corporation in connection
with its acquisition of American Cyanamid. This was the largest
U.S. debt financing of the year.  Among our other major transactions,
we joint-lead managed a $1.7 billion bond offering for ITT
Destinations, Inc., a $1.6 billion financing program for Nabisco,
Inc., two Rule 144A issues totaling $800 million for Enterprise
Rent-A-Car Company and two issues totaling $800 million for Motorola,
Inc. We lead managed a $650 million offering for Electronic Data
Systems Corporation. Our transactions for insurance companies included
lead managing Rule 144A surplus notes offerings that totaled $700
million for The Prudential Insurance Company of America, $700 million
for Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and $600 million for The
Equitable Companies Incorporated.

<H2><A NAME="jpn">Japanese Debt Financing</A></H2>

<H3>Commitment to Yen Bond Market Recognized in Significant Transactions</H3>

<P>Reflecting our dedication to these markets, including our trading,
distribution, derivatives and research activities, Goldman Sachs
arranged a total of &#165;400 billion of primary underwritings in the
Japanese public and private debt markets. Capitalizing on our
expertise, the firm made an important breakthrough in domestic issues
for Japanese corporations. An &#165;80 billion offering for Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT) was the second domestic
issue that we joint-lead managed for this client. A &#165;50 billion issue
for Osaka Gas Co., Ltd. marked the first time a non-Japanese firm
joint-lead managed a domestic offering for a company other than NTT.

<H2><A NAME="pref">Preferred Stock</A></H2>

<H3>Innovative Leadership Generates Greater Market Efficiency</H3>

<P>We continued to build on the success of MIPS, developing more
efficient versions such as QUIPS<SUP>SM</SUP> (quarterly income preferred shares)
and QUIDS<SUP>SM</SUP> (quarterly income debt securities). MIPS and similar
securities enable issuers to obtain tax-deductible, long-dated, deeply
subordinated funding at competitive rates. Through 1995, we lead
managed 26 issues of these securities aggregating more than $5.4
billion, which represented 63 percent of total market volume.  A
highlight was a $600 million QUIDS offering for the Tennessee Valley
Authority (TVA). This debt transaction, targeted to retail investors,
represented the first TVA security listed on the New York Stock
Exchange and the establishment of a retail bond market. Another
innovation involved opening the preferred market for liability
management. In this regard, we arranged tender offers and exchange
offers comparable to MIPS for, among others, The Detroit Edison
Company, McDonald's Corporation and PacifiCorp. We were particularly
active in helping insurance companies to use MIPS, QUIPS and QUIDS,
completing transactions totaling $500 million for Farmers Group,
Inc. and $503 million for American General, among others. MIPS or
similar offerings were also completed for such clients as Cadbury
Schweppes plc, Grand Metropolitan Public Limited Company, GTE
Corporation and Pacific Gas and Electric Company. For the year, the
firm was number one in lead managing issues of fixed rate perpetual
preferred stock as well as the overall leader in the preferred stock
market.

<H2><A NAME="muni">Municipal Bonds</A></H2>

<H3>Commitment Highlighted by Problem-Solving Initiatives</H3>

<P>As part of the recovery plan for Orange County, California, we
senior managed a $278 million issue of recovery bonds that represented
the first ever financing for a U.S. municipality in bankruptcy. We
also senior managed an innovative $155 million financing that allowed
the County to securitize its delinquent property tax payments as part
of its recovery plan. We assisted the Greater Orlando Aviation
Authority in executing the first ever alternative index hedge
swap. This $384 million "synthetic" refunding achieved a significant
cost saving by locking in current interest rates. Utilizing a unique
structure, we senior managed a $236 million issue of certificates of
beneficial interest that enabled Intermountain Power Agency to take
advantage of low interest rates to refinance bonds that could not be
advance-refunded because of tax law restrictions. We structured a $325
million securitization of multifamily mortgages for the City of New
York that enabled the City to privatize related mortgage servicing
activities and provided proceeds to partially offset a projected
budget gap. In a three-week period, we sole managed three bond issues
totaling $369 million for the City of Long Beach. The proceeds were
used to prepay unfunded pension liability, refund bonds and finance
construction of an aquarium.

<H2><A NAME="struct">Structured Finance</A></H2>

<H3>Capital Raised for a Wide Range of Industries</H3>

<P>Our activities included advising RP Telekom S.A., a privately owned
Polish company, on the development and financing of a land-line
telephone business. Also, we are advising NewTel Limited, a newly
formed Bermudian company, on the development and financing of a
telecommunications manufacturing and services business in Vietnam. We
structured and marketed a $255 million taxable and sole managed an $85
million tax-exempt debt offering for Mobile Energy Services Company,
L.L.C. to purchase an energy complex. This project financing achieved
investment-grade credit ratings, and the debt was completed in the
public market with a structure and covenants less stringent than would
have been possible in the private market. Approximately $1.1 billion
of senior debt was raised by the firm for OCENSA (Oleoducto Central
S.A.), a newly formed Colombian oil pipeline venture. We also advised
Petr&#243;leos Mexicanos, the national oil company of Mexico, and Shell Oil
Company on a follow-on financing for a joint-venture refinery in
Texas. The firm continued to focus on lease financing as an effective
way to lower capital costs for clients. Significant transactions in
the U.S. included public offerings of pass-through certificates for
Federal Express Corporation, Kmart and Wal-Mart and the lease
financing of the new world headquarters of Owens-Corning Fiberglas. In
Germany, we completed a DM492 million lease for Mitteldeutsche
Braunkohlengesellschaft mbH, a coal company.

<H2><A NAME="mtg">Mortgage Securitization</A></H2>

<H3>Emphasis on Providing Enhanced Liquidity</H3>

<P> Through focused distribution, capital commitment and the
application of our structuring expertise, we brought enhanced
liquidity to various sectors of the mortgage markets. We assisted
holders of agency pass- through mortgage-backed securities to complete
large block trades. In the mortgage derivatives area, our significant
investment in state-of-the-art prepayment models gave us the tools to
analyze structures that enabled our clients to take advantage of
opportunities and analyze risks in the mortgage derivatives
markets. Additionally, we provided capital and structuring expertise
in single-family whole loans, real estate securitization and mortgage
servicing rights.

<H2><A NAME="asset">Asset Securitization</A></H2>

<H3>Innovations for Diverse Asset Types</H3>

<P> Highlighting the year was our lead management of the first
securitization of student loans for the Student Loan Marketing
Association (Sallie Mae). This $1 billion transaction  the first
securitization in which only Treasury bill- based securities were
issued  allowed Sallie Mae to better manage its capital position and
diversify its investor base. We also lead managed transactions backed
by bank credit cards for People's Bank, agricultural and industrial
equipment receivables for John Deere Capital Corporation, private
label credit cards for Sears, Roebuck and Co., automobile receivables
for Ford Motor Credit Company and home equity lines of credit for
Household International, Inc.

<H2><A NAME="shrt">Shorter Term Financings</A></H2>

<H3>Unprecedented Funding of Stock Repurchases and Mergers</H3>

<P> Major U.S. and European companies turned to Goldman Sachs for
assistance in using the commercial paper market to finance merger and
acquisition transactions and stock repurchases. For example, eight of
our Fortune 500 clients each raised over $850 million for these
purposes in the commercial paper market. Innovative structures to
finance credit card receivables and other assets played a central role
in the continuing growth of commercial paper-funded
securitization. Our securitized outstandings reached an all-time high
of nearly $26 billion in 1995. Reflecting the growth of our money
market capabilities globally, our activity in the Euro commercial
paper market was also at a record level with such new Goldman Sachs
issuers as the Republic of Portugal, Mobil Corporation and Halifax
Building Society. In addition, we enhanced the efficiency of our
U.S. commercial paper services by completing the installation of a
proprietary information system that provides clients with real-time
links to our trading data.

<H2><A NAME="hiyld">High-Yield Bonds</A></H2>

<H3>Low-Cost, Flexible Capital Raised in Buoyant Market</H3>

<P>Goldman Sachs enhanced its leadership position in the high-yield
market, raising approximately $10 billion for issuers in 27
lead-managed and 19 co-managed transactions. We assisted a diverse
group of issuers to access low-cost and flexible long-term
capital. These clients included Federated Department Stores, which
completed two financings totaling $850 million, as well as several
first-time issuers, such as a $175 million offering for TLC Beatrice
International Holdings, Inc. and a $135 million issue for Benedek
Broadcasting Corporation, among others. We were in the forefront of
financing growth in the communications industry, lead managing
transactions of $400 million for Paging Network, Inc., $300 million
for Diamond Cable Communications PLC, $250 million for Comcast
Corporation and $175 million for Granite Broadcasting Corporation. We
were a leader in bringing Canadian companies to the U.S. high-yield
market, lead managing transactions of $250 million for Trizec
Corporation Ltd., the first high-yield offering for a real estate
company, and $250 million for Tembec Inc., a Canadian forest products
company.

<H2><A NAME="sbd">Senior Bank Debt</A></H2>

<H3>Creative Use of Corporate Loans to Finance Growth</H3>

<P>Drawing on our expertise and institutional relationships as a
leading market maker for bank loans, we structured, underwrote and
syndicated senior facilities for U.S. and European corporations
experiencing changes of control or requiring refinancing. We arranged
and jointly underwrote a &#163;2.55 billion credit facility for PowerGen
plc to support the company's proposed acquisition of Midlands
Electricity plc, a $1.56 billion credit facility for Santa Fe Pacific
Corporation as a key component of its recapitalization, and an $875
million credit facility backing the purchase of Marshalls of
Roseville, Minnesota, Inc. by The TJX Companies, Inc. For the
financial sponsor community, we arranged and jointly underwrote senior
bank loans of $1.1 billion for Marcus Cable Operating Company, L.P.,
controlled by a group including affiliates of Goldman, Sachs & Co.,
Freeman Spogli & Co.  Incorporated, and Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst,
Inc., and of $525 million backing the acquisition of Caterair
International Corporation by Onex Corporation's SkyChefs, Inc.
affiliate. For Calmar Inc., we developed the Amortization Extended
Loans (AXELs<SUP>TM</SUP>) product, which fulfills borrowers' preference to defer
amortization and provides loan portfolio managers with an asset that
has call protection.

<H2><A NAME="pia">Principal Investments</A></H2>

<H3>Major New Fund Signals Growing Commitments Worldwide</H2>

<P>GS Capital Partners II, L.P. was formed in 1995 as our primary
vehicle for making substantial, long-term, privately negotiated equity
and equity-related investments. This fund has committed capital of
$1.75 billion that includes a $300 million contribution from Goldman
Sachs. It is the successor to GS Capital Partners, L.P., which
completed investments of $1 billion within three years. The limited
partners in these funds as well as in GS Capital Partners (Asia),
L.P. are institutional and individual investing clients around the
world. During the year, we made 36 investments totaling $500 million
in 12 countries. These included investments in Arisco Produtos
Alimenticios S.A., one of the largest private-branded food businesses
in Brazil; Concentric Research Corporation, an Internet access
provider; RP Telekom; Giant Manufacturing Co., Ltd. of Taiwan, one of
the world's largest bicycle producers; and PT Widya Duta Informindo,
an Indonesian telecommunications company.  A number of companies that
we have been building were taken to the public markets. Our firm lead
managed successful IPOs for, among others, ANADIGICS, INC., a radio
and microwave components supplier; GCR Holdings Limited, a reinsurance
company; Neuromedical Systems, Inc., a developer and commercializer of
technology for detecting cervical cancer; and Premisys Communications,
Inc., a developer, producer and marketer of integrated communications
services.

<P>The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts.

<P>Certain prior-year amounts have been reclassified to conform with
the presentation for the fiscal year ended November 24, 1995.

<P><EM>Financial Instruments</EM><BR>
Purchases and sales of financial instruments are generally recorded
on a settlement date basis. Recording such transactions on a trade
date basis would not result in a material difference.

<P> Financial instruments owned and financial instruments sold, but
not yet purchased, are carried at fair value.

<P>
The Firm defines cash equivalents as highly liquid overnight
deposits not held for sale in the ordinary course of business.

<P><EM>Derivative Financial Instruments</EM><BR>
Derivative contracts are financial instruments whose value is
derived from an underlying asset, index or reference rate. Derivative
financial instruments, as defined by Statement of Financial Accounting
Standard No. 119, &quot;Disclosure about Derivative Financial
Instruments and Fair Value of Financial Instruments&quot; (&quot;SFAS112&quot;),
are futures contracts, forward contracts, option contracts,
swap agreements and other financial instruments with similar characteristics,
such as caps, collars, floors and swaptions. Derivative financial
instruments are carried at fair value.

<P>Futures contracts are exchange-traded standardized contractual
commitments to buy or sell a specified quantity of a financial
instrument, currency or commodity at a specified price and future
date. Forward contracts are over-the-counter (&quot;OTC&quot;)
contracts between two parties who agree to exchange a specified
quantity of a financial instrument, currency or commodity at a
specified price and future date. Option contracts convey the right
to buy (call option) or sell (put option) a financial instrument,
currency or commodity at a pre-determined price. For written option
contracts, the writer receives a premium in exchange for bearing
the risk of unfavorable changes in the underlying financial instrument,
currency or commodity. Swaps are OTC contracts between two parties
who agree to exchange periodic cash flow streams calculated on
a pre-determined contractual (notional) amount.

<P>The SFAS 119 definition of derivative financial instruments excludes
certain financial instruments that derive their values or contractually
required cash flows from the price of some other security or index,
such as mortgage-backed securities, interest-only and principal-only
obligations, and indexed debt instruments. This definition also
excludes option-like features that are embedded within an on-balance-sheet
asset or liability: for example, the conversion feature and call
provisions embedded in convertible bonds. Commodity-settled transactions
are also excluded as these contracts involve the required or optional
future exchange or delivery of an item that is not a financial
instrument. The Firm, however, has elected to include commodity-related
contracts as derivative financial instruments in the consolidated
financial statements since they may be cash settled.

<P>Derivative financial instruments executed in connection with
the Firm's proprietary and customer activities and for risk management
purposes are included in &quot;Derivative contracts&quot; on the
consolidated statements of financial condition. 

<P>Certain derivative transactions entered into under master agreements
and other arrangements that provide the Firm, in its opinion,
with a right of setoff in the event of a bankruptcy or default
by the counterparty are presented net in the consolidated statements
of financial condition.

<P>The Firm also enters into interest rate futures contracts and
interest rate and currency swap agreements to convert a substantial
portion of its fixed-rate term debt into U.S. dollar-based floating
rate obligations. The gains and losses on such transactions, which
modify interest rate characteristics of specific non-trading liabilities,
are generally deferred and recognized over the life of the agreements.

<P><EM>Fair Value</EM><BR>
Fair value is generally based on quoted market prices. Fair value
for positions for which market quotations are not readily available
is generally estimated utilizing financial models which incorporate
market data for the relevant instruments or for instruments with
similar characteristics. 

<P>Substantially all other non-trading financial instruments and
collateralized financing arrangements are carried at fair value
or amounts that approximate fair value.

<P><EM>Principal Investments</EM><BR>
Purchases related to merchant banking transactions are carried
at their initial cost, adjusted upward only when changes in the
underlying fair values are readily ascertainable, generally as
evidenced by substantial third party transactions occurring in
the marketplace that directly affect the value of such investments,
and downward in the event that the Firm determines that the eventual
realizable value is less than the carrying value.

<P><EM>Collateralized Financing Arrangements</EM><BR>
Securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities
sold under agreements to repurchase (principally U.S. government,
federal agency and foreign sovereign obligations) represent short-term
collateralized financing transactions and are carried at their
contractual amounts, plus accrued interest. The Firm takes possession
of securities purchased under agreements to resell, monitors the
market value of the underlying securities as compared to the related
receivable, including accrued interest, on a daily basis and obtains
additional collateral as appropriate.

<P>Securities borrowed and securities loaned are carried at the
amounts of cash collateral advanced and received in connection
with the transactions. The Firm measures the market value of the
securities borrowed and loaned against the contract value of the
transactions on a daily basis and obtains additional collateral
as appropriate.

<P><EM>Translation of Foreign Currencies</EM><BR>
Assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the
U.S. dollar have been translated using exchange rates prevailing
as of the end of the fiscal periods presented. Gains or losses
resulting from converting the financial statements of subsidiaries
whose functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar are recorded
as cumulative translation adjustments.

<H3>Note 3. Short-Term Borrowings</H3>

<P>Short-term borrowings are principally uncollateralized. The Firm
maintains unencumbered securities with a market value in excess
of all uncollateralized short-term borrowings.

<P>The Firm has arranged committed stand-by credit facilities, substantially
all of which are available on an uncollateralized basis, under
agreements with domestic and international banks. At November
24, 1995 and November 25, 1994, the aggregate amount of these
facilities exceeded $1.9 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively.

<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="images/l-green.gif" ALT= "" HEIGHT= 2 WIDTH= 399 BORDER=0><P><P><P>

<H3>Note 4. Long-Term Borrowings</H3>

<P>Long-term borrowings include U.S. dollar and non-U.S. dollar obligations
issued at fixed and floating rates of interest. The Firm enters
into interest rate futures contracts and interest rate and currency
swap agreements which effectively convert a substantial portion
of the borrowings into U.S. dollar-based floating rate obligations.
The aggregate amount of long-term borrowings at November 24, 1995
mature as follows (in millions):

<H3>Note 5. Commitments and Contingencies</H3>

<P>The Firm has obligations under long-term lease agreements (principally
for office space) expiring on various dates through 2008. Certain
agreements are subject to periodic escalation charges. Minimum
rental commitments under noncancelable leases for the 1996 fiscal
year and the succeeding four fiscal years are $85 million, $71
million, $69 million, $71 million and $54 million, respectively,
and $332 million thereafter.

<P>The Firm obtains letters of credit that are used in lieu of securities
or cash to satisfy various collateral and margin deposit requirements.
Such letters of credit outstanding at November 24, 1995 and November
25, 1994 totaled $8.3 billion and $9.6 billion, respectively.

<P>At November 24, 1995 and November 25, 1994, the Firm had pledged
securities of $16.1 billion and $10.1 billion, respectively, as
collateral for securities borrowed of approximately equivalent
value.

<P>In the normal course of its business activities, the Firm has
been named in certain legal actions. In the opinion of the Firm,
such litigation should not result in any loss that would be significant
in relation to partners' capital.

<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="images/l-green.gif" ALT= "" HEIGHT= 2 WIDTH= 399 BORDER=0><P><P><P>

<H3>Note 6. Employee Benefit Plans</H3>

<P>The Firm provides pension, health care and life insurance benefits
to eligible employees and reserves the right to amend or terminate
these programs at any time. 

<P>Principally all of the Firm's eligible employees are covered
by a defined benefit plan, which is fully funded.

<P>Effective November 26, 1994, the Firm adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standard No. 112, &quot;Employers' Accounting for Postemployment
Benefits&quot; (&quot;SFAS 112&quot;). In addition, the Firm
accounts for postretirement benefits other than pensions in accordance
with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 106, &quot;Employers'
Accounting of Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions.&quot;

<P>Both standards require the expected cost of these benefits be
charged to expense during the years that the employees render
service. Prior to adoption, costs were recorded as paid.

<P>The adoption of SFAS 112 did not have a material effect on the
Firm's consolidated statement of financial condition.<BR>

<H3>Note 7. Financial Instruments</H3>

<H4>Trading Activities</H4>

<P>In the normal course of business, the Firm operates in many financial
markets and, as such, engages in various transactions in financial
instruments and commodities that have both on- and off-balance-sheet
implications. 

<P>The Firm enters into cash and derivative financial transactions
in connection with proprietary and customer activities. In many
instances, derivative financial instruments are used to hedge
cash instruments or other derivative financial instruments as
an integral part of its trading strategy. As a result, it is necessary
to view the results for any activity, including the effect of
derivative transactions, in the aggregate. 

<P>The Firm manages these activities through its Fixed Income, Equities,
and Currency and Commodities divisions, which underwrite, distribute
and trade financial instruments, including derivatives, and are
principally subject to interest rate, equity price, foreign exchange
and commodity price risk, respectively. Furthermore, each of these
divisions is subject to interest rate and foreign exchange risk.

<P><EM>Risk Management</EM><BR>
The Firm seeks to monitor and control its risk exposure through
a variety of separate but complementary financial, operational,
credit and legal reporting systems. The Firm believes that it
has effective procedures for evaluating and controlling the credit
and market risks to which it is exposed. The Executive Committee,
the Firm's primary decision-making body, determines (both directly
and through delegated authority) the types of business in which
the Firm engages, approves guidelines for accepting customers
for all product lines, outlines the terms under which customer
business is conducted and establishes the parameters for the risks
which the Firm is willing to undertake in its proprietary business.
The Risk Committee, which reports to the Executive Committee and
meets weekly, is responsible for managing and monitoring all of
the Firm's risk exposures. Substantially all of the Firm's credit
review and risk control functions are performed by groups that
are independent from revenue producing departments.

<P><EM>Financial Instruments With Off-Balance-Sheet Risk</EM><BR>
Financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk include derivative
financial instruments and financial instruments sold but not yet
purchased. 

<P>Financial instruments, including derivatives, are used to manage
market risk, facilitate customer transactions and engage in proprietary
transactions. These instruments can be executed on an exchange
or negotiated in the OTC market. Derivative financial instruments
may involve future commitments to purchase or sell financial instruments
or commodities, or to exchange currencies or interest payment
streams. The amounts exchanged are based on the specific terms
of the contract with reference to specified rates, securities,
commodities or indices.

<P>Transactions involving financial instruments sold, but not yet
purchased, entail an obligation to purchase a financial instrument
at a future date. The Firm may incur a loss if the market value
of the financial instrument subsequently increases prior to the
purchase of the instrument.

<P><EM>Market Risk</EM><BR>
Market risk arises from the potential for changes in the value
of financial instruments and commodities resulting from fluctuations
in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and prices of commodities
and debt and equity securities. Market risk is also affected by
changes in volatility and liquidity in the markets in which these
instruments are traded. The gross notional (or contractual) amounts
of derivative financial instruments are used to express the volume
of these transactions and do not represent the amounts potentially
subject to market risk. In addition, the measurement of market
risk is meaningful only when all related and offsetting transactions
are taken into consideration. 

<P>The risks inherent in derivative financial instruments used for
proprietary and customer activities and for risk management purposes
are as follows:

<UL>

<LI><STRONG>Interest Rate Risk</STRONG> - Interest rate risk arises from the
possibility that changes in interest rates will affect the value
of financial instruments. Management may utilize interest rate
swap contracts, interest rate futures contracts and option contracts,
and to a lesser degree caps, collars, floors and swaption contracts,
to manage interest rate risk. Interest rate forward settlement
contracts principally represent To-Be-Announced mortgage pools,
which are subject to interest rate risk.<P>

<LI><STRONG>Equity Price Risk</STRONG> - Equity price risk arises from the possibility
that equity prices will fluctuate, affecting the value of equity
securities and derivative financial instruments which derive their
value from a stock index, a particular stock or a defined basket
of stocks. Equity option contracts, equity swaps and futures contracts
may be utilized to manage equity price risk.<P>

<LI><STRONG>Foreign Exchange Risk</STRONG> - Foreign exchange risk arises from
the possibility that fluctuations in foreign exchange rates will
affect the value of financial instruments. Foreign exchange forward
contracts and option contracts may be utilized to manage foreign
exchange risk. Foreign exchange swaps and futures contracts may
also be utilized.<P>

<LI><STRONG>Commodity Price Risk</STRONG> - Commodity price risk arises from
the possibility that the price of the underlying commodity (primarily
metals, oil and other petroleum products, and coffee/cocoa) may
fluctuate. Commodity forward contracts, option contracts and futures
contracts may be utilized to manage commodity price risk.

<H4>Credit Risk</H4>

<P>Credit risk associated with derivative financial instruments results
from potential counterparty non-performance. The Firm utilizes
replacement cost as its measure for credit risk. With respect
to derivative financial instruments (other than purchased option
contracts) that are in gain positions, replacement cost represents
amounts receivable from various counterparties, net of any unrealized
losses owed where the Firm has a legally enforceable right of
setoff. Replacement cost for purchased option contracts is the
market value of the contract. The Firm controls its credit risk
through an established credit approval process, by monitoring
counterparty limits, obtaining collateral where appropriate, and
using legally enforceable master netting agreements.

<H4>Fair Value</H4>

<P>As described in Note 2, derivative financial instruments executed
in connection with the Firm's proprietary and customer activities
and for risk management purposes are carried at fair value. The
fair values of derivative financial instruments as of November
24, 1995 and November 25, 1994 and the average monthly fair value
of such instruments for the fiscal year ended November 24, 1995
computed in accordance with the Firm's netting policy are as follows

<H3>Note 8. Partners' Capital</H3>

<P>Partners' capital includes both general and limited partners'
capital and employee interests and is subject to certain withdrawal
restrictions. General partners who elect to retire may redeem
their capital in installments over not less than five years following
retirement, but generally reinvest their capital as limited partners
for longer periods.

<P>Sumitomo Bank Capital Markets, Inc. (&quot;SBCM&quot;), which
had capital invested of approximately $506 million at November
24, 1995, may require the Firm to redeem its capital account over
a five-year period beginning no earlier than 2002. Royal Hawaiian
Shopping Center, Inc. (&quot;RHSC&quot;), which had aggregate
capital invested of approximately $507 million at November 24,
1995, may require the Firm to redeem $255 million of its capital
account over the five-year period beginning no earlier than 2010
and $252 million of its capital account over the five-year period
beginning no earlier than 2013. 

<P>Institutional limited partners (other than SBCM and RHSC) had
aggregate capital invested of $755 million at November 24, 1995.
The Firm redeemed $276 million of institutional limited partners'
capital in March 1995 and received additional capital investments
from institutional limited partners in March 1995 and May 1995
of $237 million and $20 million, respectively. The Firm must repay
the institutional limited partners' capital as follows: $270 million
in six equal annual installments commencing in December 2001,
$257 million in March 2005, $146 million in November 2013 and
$82 million in November 2023. Partners' capital reserved for income
taxes and potential withdrawals relates primarily to general partner
activity.

<P>The Firm may defer any required redemption of capital if the
redemption would cause a subsidiary subject to regulatory authority
to be in violation of the rules of such authority or if the withdrawal
of funds to satisfy the redemption from an unregulated subsidiary
would have a material adverse effect on such subsidiary.

<P>Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. is a registered U.S. broker-dealer subsidiary,
which is subject to the Securities and Exchange Commission's &quot;Uniform
Net Capital Rule,&quot; and has elected to compute its net capital
in accordance with the &quot;Alternative Net Capital Requirement&quot;
of that rule. At November 24, 1995 and November 25, 1994, Goldman,
Sachs &amp; Co. had regulatory net capital, as defined, of approximately
$1,681 million and $1,569 million, respectively, which exceeded
the amount required by approximately $1,499 million and $1,418
million, respectively.

<P>Certain other subsidiaries of the Firm are also subject to capital
adequacy requirements promulgated by authorities of the countries
in which they operate. At November 24, 1995, these subsidiaries
were in compliance with their local capital adequacy requirements.

<P>To the Partners,

<P>The Goldman Sachs Group, L.P.:

<P>We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial
condition of The Goldman Sachs Group, L.P. and Subsidiaries as
of November 24, 1995 and November 25, 1994. These consolidated
statements of financial condition are the responsibility of the
Firm's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on these consolidated statements of financial condition based
on our audits.

<P>We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated
statements of financial condition are free of material misstatement.
An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated statements of
financial condition. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management,
as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated

<H2><A NAME="adv">Advisory Leadership Worldwide</A></H2>

<P>In a record year for merger and acquisition transactions worldwide,
Goldman Sachs represented clients in more than 190 completed
transactions totaling approximately $130 billion, including 30 over $1
billion and 145 over $100 million. Major transactions included
facilitating the $7.5 billion restructuring of ITT Corporation by
advising on the divestiture of ITT Financial Corporation and the
subsequent division of ITT into three publicly traded companies. In
the largest transaction to date in the railroad industry, we acted as
financial advisor to Santa Fe Pacific Corporation in its $5 billion
merger with Burlington Northern Inc. We advised The Seagram Company
Ltd. on exiting its $8.8 billion stake in E.I. du Pont de Nemours and
Company.

<P>The firm's expanded role in domestic and regional cross-border
transactions reflected growing recognition of our local market
expertise. Among our many cross- border transactions, we advised
Cadbury Schweppes plc of the U.K. in its $2.2 billion acquisition of
Dr Pepper/Seven-Up Companies, Inc., the U.S. soft drink company. The
firm advised ALTANA AG in divesting its subsidiary Milupa
Aktiengesellschaft, the leading infant foods company in Germany, to
the Dutch company N.V. Verenigde Bedrijven Nutricia for $585
million. In addition, we advised Ford Motor Company on the
restructuring of its AutoLatina Brasil S.A. joint venture with
Volkswagen Aktiengesellschaft, located in Argentina and Brazil.

<H2><A NAME="raid">Raids and Anti-Raid Advisory Services</A></H2>

<H3>Long-Standing Leadership in Confronting Unsolicited Offers</H3>

<P>In the past 10 years, we represented over 150 companies that were
faced with unsolicited offers. We also provided anti-raid advisory
services to hundreds of companies, analyzing their structural defenses
and preparedness as well as helping to address issues of strategy and
shareholder value.  This past year, we advised Wallace Computer
Services, Inc. in its response to a $1.3 billion unsolicited tender
offer from Moore Corporation Limited, and Teledyne, Inc. in its
response to a $1.2 billion unsolicited offer and subsequent proxy
contest by WHX Corp.  We advised Credito Romagnolo S.p.A. in its
defense strategy and subsequent sale to Credito Italiano S.p.A. for
$2.3 billion - the largest tender offer ever in Italy and the first
application of a new regulation involving competitive offers. First
Interstate Bancorp, Inc.  was represented by the firm in its response
to a takeover offer from and proposed merger with Wells Fargo &
Company for approximately $11.5 billion. We represented South Western
Electricity plc in its response to an unsolicited $1.8 billion
takeover bid from The Southern Company.

<H2><A NAME="strat">Strategic Transactions</A></H2>

    <BR>
    Whatever your long-term goals, such as providing for your children's or grandchildren's education, or a comfortable retirement for yourself, you will need investments that will help your nest egg grow.  That's why so many people put a portion of their money into stocks, also called equities, or equity mutual funds.
    <BR>
    <BR>
    Goldman Sachs offers a variety of <A HREF="#domeq"><FONT COLOR="333399"><B>domestic funds</FONT></B></A> and <A HREF="#inteq"><FONT COLOR="333399"><B>international funds</B></FONT></A> from which you can build a diversified equity portfolio.  As of December 31, 1996, the Asset Management Division managed, administered and/or distributed nearly $33 billion in a combination of equity mutual funds and equity separate accounts.
    <BR>
    <BR>
    <B>Professional Management.   </B>
    Each Goldman Sachs equity fund is professionally managed by a team of portfolio managers, supported by equity analysts, who focus on a particular type of stocks (i.e., domestic, international, small-capitalization, dividend-paying, growth-oriented, etc.) and various industry sectors included in the portfolio.

    Today, we all live and compete in a global economy. In fact, over half of
    the world's stock market capitalization now comes from outside the U.S.
    By diversifying your investment portfolio in international investments,
    you can significantly increase your investment choices and participate in
    growth potential of companies beyond our borders.

    How Goldman Sachs Asset Management Adds Value Around the World</B></FONT>
    <BR>
    <BR>
     When you decide to invest internationally, it makes sense to leave the investment decisions to professionals who can provide firsthand knowledge of local markets and foreign companies.  Our people understand the differences in how business is done in other countries and will monitor your investment daily.
    <UL>
    <LI><A NAME="local"></A><B>Our portfolio managers bring in-depth knowledge of local markets, politics and economics</B> &#150 a critical edge in identifying and monitoring investment opportunities. They function as your eyes and ears in a foreign country, gathering information, meeting company management and conducting analysis that goes far beyond the resources available to most investors.
    <P>
    <LI><A NAME="rsrch"></A><B>Our primary emphasis is on extensive fundamental research.</B> Every stock considered for our portfolios is thoroughly analyzed with regard to its competitive position in its industry, its financial strength and the quality of its management.
    <P>
    <LI><A NAME="company"></A><B>Company visits are a critical part of our analysis.</B>  There's no substitute for seeing businesses firsthand &#150 especially in some parts of the world where regulatory requirements are not as stringent as they are in more mature markets like the U.S.  We like to inspect a company's operations, visit the factory floor &#150  whatever it takes to get a clear picture of how that company runs.  The better we get to know management, the better we can evaluate current and future developments.  During a typical year, our international equity team visits more than 600 companies.
    <P>
    <LI><A NAME="risk"></A><B>Risk management is an important part of our investment process.</B>  While stock selection and diversification among companies is central to our investment approach, our portfolio managers seek to manage risk by setting target portfolio ranges for country and regional weightings.  Thus, a fund&#039s allocations can be carefully managed against a specific benchmark.
    <P>
    <LI><A NAME="currency"></A><B>Currency specialists manage foreign exchange exposure in our international funds.</B>  Currency fluctuations can have a dramatic impact on the performance of international portfolios.  As a result, we believe it is critical to have a team of currency specialists who follow foreign exchange markets and can seek to protect a portfolio&#039s value during periods of currency volatility.
    </UL>

    Many people need investments that can provide an additional source of income.  Goldman Sachs offers a range of fixed income funds, both domestic and global.  All told, as of December 31, 1996, the Asset Management Division managed, administered or distributed approximately $24 billion in fixed income assets in mutual funds and separate accounts.

Goldman Sachs offers taxable and tax-exempt money market funds suitable for individual investors.  They are managed by the same professionals who oversee approximately $26 billion in money market investments for some of the largest corporations and institutions in America.

<SMALL><I><SUP>*</SUP>Understanding the Risks.
While international investments may provide excellent opportunities, they also present certain risks that are not associated with U.S. securities. For example, foreign markets may be less liquid, more volatile and less subject to governmental regulation than U.S. markets.  
In addition, foreign investments are subject to price changes determined by currency fluctuations.  And in less developed markets, such as in Asia, political and social instability is more common than in the West.  Please refer to the fund&#039s prospectus for more details.</I></SMALL>

as of <B>12/31/96</B>
<P>
The Asian markets were weak in December due to uncertainties in the U.S. interest rate outlook. Following several months of outperformance, the Hong Kong market slowed.  Korea was the worst performer as the Won reached new lows against the U.S. dollar.  Taiwan continued to be supported by domestic liquidity, but the economy remains weak and a recovery in the property market remains unlikely in the near term.<P>
The Thai market fell sharply as the newly appointed government is having difficulties putting together a coherent economic plan to address years of over-investment, high indebtedness and inflated asset prices.  Consequently, we are maintaining our underweight position.<P>
On a more positive note, the Indian market showed signs of recovery during the month, appreciating nearly 7&#037.  We continue to remain positive on the long-term outlook for this market.<P>
The fund (Class A) returned 1.51&#037 at NAV, outperforming its benchmark by 196 basis points for the month. Stock selection accounted for most of the portfolio&#039s outperformance versus the benchmark, particularly in Hong Kong and Malaysia. Our overweight positions in Hong Kong and India also positively impacted performance.
Although we do not expect an upturn in the Asian economic cycle until later in 1997, numerous blue chip stocks are now trading at cheap multiples and may provide buying opportunities in coming months.

<SMALL><I><SUP>*</SUP>Understanding the Risks.
While international investments may provide excellent opportunities, they also present certain risks that are not associated with U.S. securities. For example, foreign markets may be less liquid, more volatile and subject to less governmental regulation than U.S. markets.  
In addition, foreign investments are subject to price changes determined by currency fluctuations.  And in less developed markets, such as in Asia, political and social instability is more common than in the West.  Please refer to the fund's prospectus for more details.</I></SMALL>

as of <B>12/31/96</B>
<P>
International equity markets experienced mixed performance in December, as all European and most Asian markets scored positive returns. The Japanese market declined 5.9&#037 due to further yen weakness and a poor performing financial sector. In Asia, the top-performing market was Indonesia, helped by the resolution of recent political concerns, while Thailand declined significantly.<P>
In Europe, Spain and the Scandinavian countries led the markets.  Utility stocks paced Spain&#039s market as the government&#039s newly adopted electricity protocol is likely to open the industry to more competition. Scandinavian markets were driven by rising oil prices, the good performance of Nokia and rises in the capital goods sector.<P>
The U.K. posted lower returns than most European markets, as the strong pound hurt exporters&#039 profitability and election and interest rate concerns fueled market uncertainty. Despite the U.K.&#039s underperformance, several of our British stocks fared extremely well this month.  Computer software services company Misys (a 2.2&#037 position) and Siebe (1.5&#037), an industrial instrumentation and controls company, rose 12.6&#037 and 14&#037, respectively.<P>
The Goldman Sachs International Equity Fund (Class A) outperformed its benchmark, the FT/S&amp;P Actuaries EuroPac Index, by 242 basis points at NAV.  This can be attributed to the positive impact of our stock selection, particularly in Europe and Japan. Our underweighting in Japan and overweighting in star performers such as Sweden and Spain contributed significantly to performance.<P>

Searching our database is as easy as entering keywords you wish to search
for. If more than one word is entered, they will both be searched for. 
If you enter the word <B>"OR"</b> between words, either
word may appear in the fields in order to match. Any matches not meeting
the search requirement will <b>not</b> be listed. For a looser search
try entering an "OR" between search words.<BR>
<BR>
<b>Examples:</b><BR>
Search for:   money stocks<BR>
<i>This will search for both <b>money AND stocks</b></i>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Search for:   401k mutual OR fund<BR>

<p>The following sites are recognized by Money$earch to provide informative and compelling content to the Internet investor.  To qualify to receive the Money$earch Sites Award the following criteria must be met:
<UL>
<P><LI>Content must be free of charge to users for at least one week.
<P><LI>Site should not have sensationalistic look and feel ("The easy money approach"). Making money in the financial market or in small business requires hard work and perseverance. We prefer not to assign the award to sites that violate normal business ethics or decency.  
<P><LI>Content can be customized by the end-user.  With the data deluge that the Internet provides, there should be a feature that allows a user to view only the information that is relevant.
<P><LI> The information contained in the web site has to be investment or small business in nature.  An example would be financial information, stock quotes, stock market timing services, software for investing, general trading, small business assistance and other categories included in our <a href="/index.html">home page</a>.
</UL>
<p>
If you feel that your site matches our criteria for selection, please <a href="mailto:review@moneysearch.com">e-mail</a> us your site and its description.

<p><a href="http://www.coned.com/">Con Edison</a><BR>There may be a perception in some circles that utility shareholders are mainly big institutions and, to some extent, wealthy individuals. But, in fact, about 70 percent of our common shares are held by individual investors, most of whom hold relatively few shares and take their dividends in cash rather than reinvest them. Many of these stockholders use their Con Edison dividends for their current needs and can ill afford capital losses. Therefore, any regulatory or legislative attempts to restructure the electric utility business in ways that unfairly affect our shareholders will primarily hurt hard-working citizens and retirees. Our site has investor relations information plus our current dividend payment schedule.

<p><a href="http://www.au.com/psm/scaling.htm">FAQ on Scale Trading Futures Contracts</a><BR>Scale Trading is a method of buying and selling commodity futures. When the fundamentals are favorable and the price of a commodity is in the lower third of its multi-year range, futures contracts are bought. They are accumulated on a scale down and sold on a scale up. There are as many variations of scale trading as there are individual scale traders, but most scalers reject the idea that one must always use stop loss orders when trading commodity futures. Scale trading, therefore, generally requires more capital than many other methods of trading. It also requires careful market selection, entry point selection, and scale construction.
