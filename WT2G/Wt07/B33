Welcome to "SUMMER IN ATLANTA: 100 YEARS OF SPORTS LAW!"<p>  

Counsel Connect has gathered a panel of experts (see the thread MEET THE
PANELISTS) to discuss a variety of amateur sports law issues in this
two-week seminar from July 22 to August 2.  What's nice about this seminar,
of course, is that it will take place during the Olympic Games themselves. 
The Games will provide a fitting, moving backdrop for our discussion of
current-day amateur sports law issues.<p>   

The range of topics for this seminar is wide-open.  Any amateur sports law
issue is up for grabs.  Whether it's the IOC's use of arbitration for
athlete disputes, the role "ambush marketing" plays during the Games, or
whether a minimum age for amateur athletes should be required, all relevant
discussion is encouraged.  In addition, interactions and comparisons
between amateur and professional athletics are also fair game, as are
discussions on excessive corporate sponsorship and relevant municipal
concerns.  As you can see, the canvas is wide and open to
interpretation.<p>  

I hope you'll join us.<p>

Let the legal games begin!<p>

<h2>Banned Drugs</h2>

A number of athletes already have been banned from the Olympic Games for reportedly testing positive for performance-enhancing drugs, such as steroids.  And the appearance at the Olympic Games of Butch Reynolds -- who previously had lost a lengthy battle with the IOC over a failed drug test -- once again has raised familiar questions.<p> 

To what extent should athletes be tested for drugs at the Olympic Games?<p> 

And to what extent should athletes at other sporting events be tested for various drugs?<p>

Subject: Drug Testing-Arbitration<p> 

The new, tougher drug testing policy supported by the USOC and implemented at these Olympic Games was a topic of great discussion at one of our Athletes' Advisory Council meetings a few months ago.  The Athletes' Advisory Council of the USOC strongly supports a new "get tough" position on drugs.  In an interview the other day, Janet Evans expressed her support for tougher drug testing of athletes.  Everyone knows the suspicions surrounding the Chinese swimmers..... So to address Ted's first question, I think you will find a majority of the athletes support a strong drug testing policy.<p>  

However, a British doctor quoted in a documentary on the BBC has said that athletes can still use performance-enhancing drugs to train and had only to stop within a certain time period before the Olympic Games so as to guard against detection.  He implied that 70% of the athletes (from Britain) had taken performance-enhancing drugs during training.   Needless to say, the British delegation is upset at this accusation, but it raises the issue of how drugs are treated in different countries.  Is there a difference in drug testing policies in different countries?  Different sports?   What is the consensus on out-of-competition testing (not just at the Games) and how many countries address this issue?<p> 

The second part of the drug-testing issue, however, is what happens if there is a "false" positive?  How is an athlete's rights protected?  How is the sport protected?   What if someone mixed up your sample and what if someone spiked your drink?<p>

Subject: Drug Testing-Arbitration<p> 

In a recent Court decision in England (Lightman, J. reported in the Times 15/7/96 delivered on 13/6/96) the Court held that following the ECJ decision in Bosman [1996] 1 CMLR 645 (relating to restrictions on soccer professionals) the rules relating to doping of the International Tennis Federation may be in breach of the European Convention (particularly Articles 48 and 59) as to appeals, testing and formal procedures.<p> 

In another case in England relating to Diane Modahl, the British athlete, an attempt by the BAAF to strike out her claim for damages on the lines of the Butch Reynolds case failed and the case will proceed to a full trial.  She is claiming £500,000 following the reversal of her ban for drugs.<p> 

The English Courts seem more prepared at the moment to look critically at the way Sports Organizations run their affairs than previously.<p>

Subject: "Strict Liability" Drug Rules<p> 

What follows is directed in part to Maris Dennis' comments of July 22, to Jack Rabinowich's of July 23 and to Quirino Mancini's of July 23. The IOC and sports federations' war on drugs and "get tough" position may be all well and good. However, the rights of the athlete must not be submerged in the process. The IOC and many international and national sports federations (sports governing bodies="SGBs") have in the last few years adopted "strict liability" drug rules. Such rules do not allow for exculpation where there is no fault: proof of lack of knowledge how the prohibited substance entered the accused athlete's body; absence of culpable intent; sabotage; accident etc. Test positive, and if the sample is that of the accused and no chain of custody or other material "technical" error can be proven, a doping violation has been committed. One then goes to the SGB's corresponding rule on penalties, and applies it. In some cases, SGB rules are not entirely clear as to whether they are of the "strict liability" variety or not. However, SGBs bent on pursuing their agenda--the war on drugs, their public image and public perception, the "best interests" of the sport, may in such situations be inclined to disregard evidence of lack of "fault" and to impose a sanction under their rules. Likewise with their internal (domestic) tribunals. Strict liability SGB drug rules are, it is submitted, incompatible with basic tenets of justice and are unenforceable. A number of arbitral and court decisions in different countries confirm this view, e.g.,<p>  

l. the recent Jessica Foschi decision of a panel of AAA arbitrators (see Summer in Atlanta Library for text);<p> 

2. the l987 Sandra Gasser decision of a Swiss court;<p> 

3. the recent series of German decisions in the Katrin   Krabbe case;<p> 

4. decisions and pronouncements of the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Switzerland.<p>

This is among the main issues presented to the London High Court in the pending litigation, Matts Wilander and Karel Novacek v. International Tennis Federation, in which the undersigned is engaged as an expert witness on behalf of the players. This entire issue is discussed in a very recent article by the undersigned, "Strict Liability" Drug Rules Of Sports Governing Bodies: Are They Legal?" contained in the "Summer in Atlanta" Library. As mentioned, the Jessica Foschi AAA panel decision is also contained in that Library.<p>

Subject: Wilander-Novacek v. ITF<p> 

Further to the July 23 comments of my London colleague, Jack Rabinowich. The European Court of Justice (the European Union's=EU) highest court, decided in December, l995, in the landmark Bosman case, that l. post-contractual transfer fees (required payment by a player's new team to his old one when a player moves to a new team, after his contract with the old one has expired), when at least 2 EU countries are involved, and 2. restrictions on the number of nationals from other EU countries a sports team can field, violate Articles 48 and 59, Rome (EC) Treaty. Those provisions deal with the freedom of movement of remunerated workers and employees within the EU. In the litigation presently pending in the London High Court, pro tennis players Mats Wilander and Karel Novacek are challenging the International Tennis Federation's (ITF) drug Rule 53 as being an illegal common law restraint of trade and/or violative of "natural justice" (an English law terms of art for something akin to violative of "due process" and "arbitrary and capricious"). Two of the arguments in this regard turn on the ITF Rule being of the "strict liability" variety; and on the burden of proof being imposed on the players. In late May-early June, l996, the players sought leave to amend their statement of claim (complaint) to launch a new line of argument. ITF Rule 53 provides a tennis player with no right to a hearing or to adduce evidence or make representations before the ITF's first instance, the "review board", upon the player's "A" and "B" urine samples both testing positive. If the review board decides a doping violation has occurred, the player can then appeal to the ITF's "appeals committee". The ITF rules do not provide for any further appeal such as to an independent arbitrator or arbitral body. The U.K., France and a number of other European countries are parties to the Council of Europe's Anti-Doping Convention of November l6, l989 ("A-D Conv"). Article 7, A-D Conv, provides that the parties (contracting States) will encourage their sports organizations to harmonize their doping disciplinary procedures, applying internationally recognized principles of natural justice and guaranteeing respect for the fundamental rights of sportsmen (and women) accused of doping, including, inter alia, the right to a fair hearing; and the right to interject an appeal. Mr. Justice Lightman of the London High Court, in his June l3, l996 decision, granted Wilander/Novacek leave to re-amend their statement of claim (complaint) to plead that ITF Rule 53 violates Articles 48 and 59 of the EC (Rome) Treaty, in that the Rule possibly denies respect for their fundamental rights to a fair, first instance hearing and to an appeal against any judgment made. Mr. Justice Lightman relied heavily on the ECJ's December, l995 Bosman decision. He noted that the modern law on Articles 48 and 59, Rome (EC) Treaty was to be found in the advisory opinion of the Advocate General in Bosman and in the ECJ's Bosman decision itself. The relevant principles are (quoting from the Times Law Report): "l. Those articles (49 and 58) were to the same substantive effect, save that activities            covered by 48 were within, and by 59 outside, the ties of a contract of employment;<p> 

2. Both prohibited any restriction on the fundamental rights to freedom of movement and freedom to provide services;<p>

3. Sport was subject to Community law in so far as it constituted an economic activity within article 2;<p>      

4. Both professional sportsmen and the rules of sports;<p>    

5. Such associations could not lawfully adopt rules which restricted individual rights conferred or protected by the Treaty;<p>

6. Articles 49 and 59 extended to such associations' rules aimed at regulating gainful employment and any limitation on the rights to gainful employment or to  provide services had to be justified on grounds of public policy, public security, or public health."<p> 
This was not a decision on the merits, but, to repeat, only allows plaintiffs Wilander and Novacek to re-amend their statement of claim to assert the above arguments.  Mr. Rabinowich tells me that the ITF has appealed this ruling to the Court of Appeal.  The trial of the main action is pending at this writing and, unless settled prior thereto, a decision on the merits is expected some time around mid l997.  Panelist Jack Rabinowich's firm is handling the case for the players (as sollitors); and Philip Engleman, Q.C., also, I believe, a panelist in this seminar, is one of the barristers arguing the case for the players.  This commentator is engaged as an expert witness for the players on certain legal issues.<p>

Subject: Background, please<p> 

For those members who may be interested in sports law as spectators only, could one of you experts give a brief summary of which substances are banned, and why.  For example, I heard a yachtsman was having trouble with the IOC because he must take testosterone supplements due to removal of cancerous testicles, and that between shots, his testosterone level drops to below that of a woman.  And we're all familiar with the problems asthmatics face due to the ephedrine (?) in their inhalers.<p> 

Is there any purpose served by such rigid enforcement of the rules?<p>

Subject: Banned drugs<p> 

As one who knows very little about this, I would like some basic information from some of our experts.   

(1) Exactly what are the "performance enhancing drugs?"  Are they just anabolic steroids, or are there more of them?  Are new ones being made all the time?<br> 

(2)  How good are the drug tests used in the Olympics?  Can they detect all performance enhancing drugs out there, or only the more common ones?<br> 

(3) How can you beat a drug test?  I understand some countries (Old East Germany & maybe China) put their national resources behind drugging athletes, so they can do sophisticated tests & those who are positive don't compete.  But, how can a single athlete, free-lancing, so to speak, beat the tests?<br> 

(4) How long does one have to be on the drugs to get an effect?  Likewise, how long can you be off & not lose the effect?  And, how long do they stay in your body?<br> 

(5) The Irish Swimmer.  Does anyone care to comment on her?  (This was a BIG debate at lunch today).  Can someone take 10 or 11 drug tests in a year (all negative) & still be on drugs?  Is it possible to shave off that much time legitimately?<br>

Subject: Re D.George's Questions<p> 

The answers to many of David George's questions depend on what experts one consults. Opinions differ on many of the points. Here is what one commentator states in a very recent article, Hoxha, T.M., "Atlanta '96 and Athletes' Rights"--An Update on Drug Testing and the International Olympic Committee", Entertainment and Sports Lawyer, vol. l4, no. l, Spring l996, pp.7-l0 at 7-8: (Referring to the Ben Johnson case) A second test given to Johnson in February l994 resulted in Johnson's life-time suspension. According to Terrence O'Sullivan, a Toronto lawyer and advocate for athletes' rights who represented Johnson during his second test, "The best evidence in his case was Athletics Canada's own tests." After a race in Hamilton, Ontario, on Friday, January l993, Johnson submitted to an unannounced random test that proved negative. Two days later at a Grand Prize meet in Montreal, Johnson again acquiesced to a second drug test that he had known would be administered. He  tested negative for any steroid metabolites, but his  testosterone-epitestosterone (T-E) ratio in the A sample was l0.3.l. For doctors at the IOC and the International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF), this  proved that Johnson was guilty of an infraction. This  ratio was slightly different in the B sample. Yet, according to Dr. Mauro Di Pasquale, author of ll books about steroids, "Testosterone offers long-term benefits with no immediate results. It's not a drug of the moment such as an amphetamine. If you took 5.000 milligrams of testosterone several days before a race, it wouldn't do a thing." In other words, steroids are used as training aids not as race accelerants. If this is  the case, what other factor or factors might have altered Johnson's T-E ratios?<p> 

The body produces two substances called testosterone  and epitestosterone, each with a different molecular configuration. The doctors at the IOC and the IAAF claim that a person's natural testosterone to epitestosterone ratio is l:l. If a person uses exogenous  steroids, that ratio will alter. To accommodate any physiological and pathological conditions that could also alter this ratio, the IOC has gauged that a ratio of 6:l to l0:l is suspect of drug use and that a ratio of l0:l or greater is certifiable proof of drug use.  The biochemists implementing this test for the IOC have an unshakable faith in the test.<p> 

Other scientists, however, do not believe these tests are sensitive and specific. "Regardless of the significant analytical advances made in the last decade," asserts Di Pasquale, "testing is far from perfect." In his view, "Little is known about epitestosterone. Individuals can have varying levels of epitestosterone and their T-E ratios can vary greatly fromthe norms es- tablished by the IOC, without any malady or steroid use. Di Pasquale believes that the 6:l ratio should not be used as a decision point. <p>

In addition, Di Pasquale argues that there can be a  false positive as a result of the analytical process  and a positive test can arise secondary to the ingestion of foods containing banned substances. Di Pasquale cites a recent study by doctors in Budapest who found that residues of anabolic steroids such as testosterone, nortestosterone, methyltestosterone and  trenbolone 2,3,4,5,6, in food created false positives. He concludes that even the consumption of meat from animals that have been treated with hormones can result in a false positive anabolic steroid doping test. Interestingly, this conclusion was corroborated by a paper offered by doctors involved in IOC testing.<p> 

Not only can the reliability of drug testing be questioned, but, according to Terrence O'Sullivan, the  whole system is faulty. "Athletics Canada's own test," O'Sullivan claims, "would strengthen Johnson's case of innocence." Four days after Johnson's alleged positive test, Athletics Canada surprised Johnson with yet another random test on January 2l, l993. Not only did they find no metabolites of steroids, they found an acceptable T-E ratio. However, it is unusual for one's T-E ratio to quickly drop to an acceptable  level. The evidence seems to suggest that Johnson was not guilty of a steroid infraction.<p> 

I have not included the footnotes in the above passages. The article contains much more and is well worth reading. While the article's author does not specifically cite "strict liability" IOC and other sports governing body drug rules, he points to a number of major obstacles to athlete's receiving a fair, impartial hearing, in particular, before the International Council of Arbitration for Sport (ICAS). That is an IOC created arbitral body headquartered in Switzerland which, inter alia, hears and decides disputes involving Olympic athletes (including drug cases). ICAS arbitrators are present in Atlanta during the Games. Regarding "strict liability" drug  rules, see my (A. Wise's) earlier appended comments.<p>

Subject: Banned drugs<p> 

Hello there Aaron.  Regrettably, I could not find the time earlier to check out any follow up messages to my remarks concerning anti-doping issues, hence I will address your queries now.<p> 

As a disclaimer, please note that rulings made by the domestic tribunals of Italian sports federations are published with notable delay in the sports law reviews.  This makes it extremely difficult for Italian sports law practitioners to maintain updated records, that is, unless they were actually involved, at a representational or expertise level, in the relevant case.<p> 

As to your first question, in obeyance with the recently-enforced exacting liability principles, a decision was published late last year, issued by the judging council of the Italian Rugby Federation (IRF), whereby it was ruled that a player's failure to report for a doping test resulted as though the player had tested positive to the test and, accordingly, the heaviest disciplinary sanctions must be levied.  In the case at hand, following the implementation in 1994 of the "surprise" anti-doping test programme by the Italian Olympic Committee's (IOC) anti-doping commission, a rugby player who had been directed by the IRF to undergo a drug test during the course of a training session (i.e. far and away from being an official test match) did not show up on the due date, it being two days since having received the notice, alleging university commitments.  He did make himself available, however, for test purposes on a date which was 7 days distant from that set by the IRF:<p> 

From the player's failure to report for the drug test on the set date and from his seeking a postponement without submitting any material evidence to the extent that the alleged commitments actually required a 7-day rescheduling of the test, the IRF found that the player could not plead any cause of force majeure and thereby found him guilty, that is, as though he had tested positive.  As a result, the player was banned from playing any official competitions for a period of 2-years and his club was fined ITL 5,000,000 (nearly USD$3,000).  Eventually, the Federal Justice Committee, the body in charge of hearing the appeal case,  reversed the IRF's decision and thereby acquitted both the player and his club, sustaining two arguments submitted by the player in defense.  The latter had in fact argue that: (I) there were no official records reflecting that the IRF had indeed adopted, by implementing the relevant secondary legislation, the IOC's surprise anti-doping test programme thereby introducing the exacting liability rules, and (ii) once implemented, the new drug test rules had not been duly and formally notified to the IRF fellow members (both clubs and players).<p> 

In conclusion, although the IRF's decision was indisputable from a significant standpoint, as it entailed the enforcement of the exacting liability principles in matters of drug tests, the fact that the player had strongly objected to their legality insofar as they had not been duly notified to all IFR members, resulted in the above acquittal.<p> 

I guess the quoted case also answers your second query concerning the burden of proof as, due to the fact that the new rules on drug tests are tougher, the prosecuting bodies are required to fully substantiate their findings and subsequent disciplinary action.<p> 

I am afraid I could find no precedents to properly address your third question.  Nonetheless, I would like to share the following with you, which is based on a case I am currently handling.  You will forgive me if I do not disclose the full details of this story as the relevant litigation is still pending and I do not want to run the risk of jeopardizing or influencing, in any way, the final outcome.<p> 

Late last year I was retained by a foreign pro-player engaged by an Italian team who was no longer acting under the terms of the engagement arrangements.  No only had the club failed to pay the player's most recent monthly salary installments, but eventually had applied strong psychological pressure by insisting, on various occasions and with no apparent reason, that he undergo drug testing. However, as the club had repeatedly defaulted the engagement agreement by not making the payments due to the player, despite him having regularly and fully performed his obligations, I put the club on notice of default regarding the outstanding payments and threatened to terminate the agreement if the breaches were not cured by a certain date.  Then, I advised my client not to report for the drug test until such time as the club had met its obligations in full.  At the same time, I also instructed by client to retain the services of an independent analyst and thereby undergo a voluntary drug test as a backup measure.  Needless to say, my client tested negative.<p> 

Eventually, the agreement was terminated by the club's failure to act as required and I served the club with an injunction of payment.  The club challenged the player's injunction and, amongst other things, counter-claimed that the agreement had initially been terminated by my client due to him having failed to report (on very short notice I might add) for the doping test.  The club also submitted that such behaviour by the player was not consistent with the national federation rules in drug matters and it therefore entailed a serious contractual breach.<p> 

To cut a long story shorter than it might  result in being, we ended up in an ordinary court (and not before a federation arbitration panel) with the club alleging, without having entered any substantiating evidence, that my client had not undergone the test as he would have doubtless proved positive.  Regrettably, the case has not as yet been heard by the court, and I dare say that when we do finally appear, it should prove diverting to learn how the club attempts to substantiate a doping claim in a situation where the allegedly drugged player holds material evidence to the contrary.<p> 

Returning to your third question, note how weird this case would appear to be: the club could virtually apply to the player (and not vice versa) to obtain a urine sample in order to conduct an independent test, in a desperate effort to assert a claim.  Is this not the most peculiar case of burden of proof in reverse?  I shall keep you posted on the final outcome of the trial.<p>

<P>What's are the rules on professionals in the Games?   </P>

<P>I love the Olympics but I miss "amateur" competition. </P>

<P>It's exciting to see the big guys in Atlanta (and Barcelona), all those
superstar multi-millionaire mega-athletes who are way too  rich and famous
to even stay in the Olympic Village with  the other competitors.    </P>

<P>And sure, our elite Dream Team will save the U.S. from the  embarrassment
of losing again to the Russians (last time they  beat us they were
*Soviets*) at our beloved basketball.  (Even Brazil has whipped our non-pro
b-ball team at the Pan Am games.) But weren't the Olympics originally an
amateur sporting exhibition?   </P>

<P>Obviously, other countries send their pros to the Games. It  would be
unfair (not to mention downright foolish-looking)  if we failed to enter
our best players too. </P>

<P>I hate to be a spoil sport, but where's that 'ol Olympic  spirit in Games
dazzled by the presence of all-stars like  Barkley, Malone, Pippen,
Olajuwon, Seles, Agassi, Lewis, Johnson?  It's not just because they can
afford first class hotels and  don't have to eat the same Village food as
everyone else. </P>

<P>What makes the Olympics the OLYMPICS, anymore?  We already have Wimbeldon
and the NBA.   </P>

<P>And if the Games are to be a pro show, then let's give gold medals to all
the major league  players on the planet.  Where are the Dream Teams in
hockey, baseball, soccer?   Let's really give Coca-Cola its money's  worth.
 We have pro sports all year 'round. What's so special about a mere two
weeks every four years?  Every day can be an Olympic day.  Ask Charles
Barkley. </P>

<P>According to Section 373 of the Amateur Sports Act of 1978: </P>

<P>"As used in this Act, the term--</P>

<P>(1) 'amateur athlete' means any athlete who meets the eligibility standards
established by the national governing body for the sport in which the
athlete competes . . . " </P>

<P>So, the common perception of what an amateur is (a non-professional
athlete) has very little to do with who is eligible to compete in the
Olympic Games. It is solely up to the NGBs of each sport. So, USA
Basketball decided that they would not exclude professional athletes from
the eligibility standards which they defined. NGBs for other countries and
other sports have declined to do the same, which is why some pros
participate in the Olympics and some don't. </P>

<P>Just to update everyone, the national governing body of ice hockey, USA
Hockey (of which I am a Board member) is sending its DREAM TEAM to the 1998
Winter Olympics due to the cooperation of the National Hockey League, which
will suspend its professional season for two weeks in order to allow the
best players in the world to compete in the Olympics. </P>

<P>While I am sad that "amateurs" (mostly college players) will not be able to
go to the Olympics for men's ice hockey, I am reminded by a fellow Board
member that our US men's team will be comprised of players who grew up
through the amateur ranks of USA Hockey.  It is not like they are some
other classification of human being--they were all amateurs at one time.   </P>

Subject: Dream Teams v. Amateurs<p> 

It is my understanding that originally amateurism was used to keep working class people out of athletics.  The less privileged had to work to support themselves, so they weren't as good as the rich.  The only way working class people could excel was by being professionals.<p> 

On McNeil/Lehrer last night they told the story of a Hungarian skier in the 1950s who lost his medal because he had previously given skiing lessons.  Likewise, in this week's New Yorker there is a story on rowing.  In the early part of the century Englishmen who had ever engaged in manual labor or the trades were prohibited from rowing in certain highly prestigious events.  In light of that background, I think allowing professionals is more egalitarian.<p>

And Jess, let's not forget  that those "amateur" Soviets that beat our boys didn't have to work full-time to support their hobby - their government made sure they could devote their time to sport.<p> 

That said, I'm far more impressed with the Olympians who *do* have day jobs.  Like the short stop on our softball team.  In her spare time she's an orthopedic surgeon.<p>

Susan, I don't think the orthopedic surgeon/softball player totally qualifies as an amateur, though.  It is my understanding that she has taken a leave of absence from her job for a year to play in the Olympics.  I imagine she is getting some type of financial support (unless she has enough independent wealth to live for a year).  And, she has a signature bat, so that's not pure amateurism.<p>

Subject: The Pro Olympics<p> 

I too miss the day when TRUE amateurs only competed in the Olympics. But remember that we are now dealing with something that is far and away out of control. The Olympics are no longer amateur sport, played only for the good of sport. Now, we are talking about major corporate sponsorship and big money. So it should really surprise no one that the Olympics now include indidivuals who earn millions of dollars a year.<p> 

But even as I write this, I am reminded of two things from the Olympics. First is that TRUE amateurs still do exist in the Games in events including shooting, fencing and similar sports. So I suppose that at least those sports still maintain the purest of Olympic spirits.<p> 

Second and conversely, I recall one international athlete once defending the use of pros in the Games by simply arguing (paraphrazing here): "I want to come where the best are competing. That's what the Olympcis are about. If that means pros will play, so be it."<p>

I agree there's no way around the class issue.  The rich can afford to buy Olympic gold.  It's clear what kind of resources go into turning kids into Olympians.  How much time and money can most people devote to competitive sports, anyway? (I mean participating in them, not watching them on ESPN.)<p> 

Amateur competitive sports are for the leisure set, or those so monstrously talented they win scholarships, sponsors, and the free services of coaches like Bela Karolyi (Comaneci, Retton, Moceanu) or Nick Boleteri (Agassi, Seles).<p> 

And when that time comes, they're amateurs no longer.<p>

The Olympics lost their amateur status decades ago. They always pretended that the athletes were amatuers but everyone knew that you can't do things like pole vault 17 to 20 feet unless you are in training full time. Tennis used to pretend that its stars at Wimbledon were amateurs but they were known as "shamateurs". The olympics might as well come out and admit they are a professional outfit designed to make as much money as possible, just like the NBA, Major League Baseball et. al. The Olympics also are over rated as an economic boost to a community. Montreal is still paying for the 1976 games.<p>

What follows relates in part to Adam Shapiro's comments of July 23 on Olympic baseball. Adam says that the 2000 Sydney Games will be held in February-- does he or anyone else know if February is definite? My information indicates late September as the tentative date for the 2000 Sydney Olympics. Here's some data on Olympic baseball, and particularly, on pro players competing therein. Baseball became a full fledged Olympic sport some time prior to the l992 Barcelona Games, and was treated as such for the first time in those Games. However, pro players did not participate. Nor are pros participating in the ongoing Atlanta Games. So far as I know, professional players' participation in future Olympics is an unresolved issue. The IOC wants to see Major League and other pro baseball players (e.g., Japanese League players) in the Games. For pros to compete in the Olympics, the approval of the international governing body, the International Baseball Association (IBA) is required. An IBA rule prohibits pros from doing so. A 2/3 vote of IBA member federations is needed to change it. In June, l994, a measure to change the rule was defeated (3 votes shy). The US federation (with MLB backing) voted in favor of the change. Since then, on several occasions, the IOC's President has threatened to expel baseball from the Olympics if the IBA does not change its rule to allow top pros to compete in the 2000 Sydney Games and subsequent Olympics. In November, l995, the IBA'S President made similar public statements. While MLB would have to work out scheduling and other problems with the MLBPA, that would seem possible. The PA seems willing. As stated initially, my reports indicate tentative late September dates for the 2000 Sydney Games. Those dates would enable MLB to permit teams out of the pennant race to send players. Future summer Olympics played in Southern Hemisphere cities could be scheduled after MLB's World Series. Until a MLB collective bargaining agreement is worked out, probably this issue will not be tackled in a definitive way as between the League and the PA. While the issue could be dealt with in a new CBA, more likely a separate agreement would be reached after a new CBA is concluded (best guess). Meanwhile, however, the question remains whether through IOC and other pressure/persuasion, enough member federation votes can be mustered to change the IBA rule to allow pros to play. If not, the possibility exists of a breakaway movement--a new international baseball federation being formed by the majority of IBA members favoring the rule change, and its recognition by the IOC. Top MLB players in the Olympics could greatly help baseball's popularity worldwide (TV coverage, more foreign government money into the sport, etc.). It could even help MLB to regain some of its lost luster and fans. It could hasten a "super World Series" or similar event between MLB and the Japanese Leagues; and might well shorten the time frame for eventual MLB overseas expansion (e.g., franchises outside of the US & Canada, MLB sponsored overseas leagues etc.). The IBA issue is likely to come to a head in the relatively short term. Does anyone have very recent information on the IBA.<p>

Someone please correct me if I am wrong, but as I recall, the international governing body for basketball approved the use of professionals over the "no" vote of USA Basketball.  It seemed that the rest of the world wanted to play against the very best.<p> 

As mentioned above re Carl Lewis or the Soviets, etc., it had simply become too difficult to distinguish who were pros or amateurs in almost any sport.  Let's let this "ideal" die and concentrate on the opportunity to watch those who are the absolute best athletes in the world.  And let's be happy for them that they do not have to beg for financial support to allow them to train as they should.<p>

Jesse,<p>

Since your piece on amateur v. professional athletes in the Olympics centered on the Dream Team, I thought you ( and perhaps others) would be interested in a notion that was floating around the airwaves in New  York today, on WFAN, the SportsRadio station. A couple of  listeners called in and opined that perhaps USA basketball could do what that United States Soccer Federation did for the mens' soccer team. That is, select  a team of  All-Stars who are under a specific age (in the case of soccer it is 23) and have 3 "wild-card" selections. In other words, you could have three NBA hoopers play with a team of  college kids.  Of course, in light of the fact that most of the best collegiate hoopers leave school when they are 19-20, you may still end up with a team of pros even if you impose an age requirement.<p> 

Furthermore, I think it bears keeping in mind that the United States was one of the few (if  not the only) countries that sent an amateur basketball team, prior to 1992. Now, in terms of status, we have an even playing field: our best pros versus the best pros from other countries. While I appreciate the empty feeling you seem to be experiencing at the "death of amateur athletics", I must  add that  the concept of amateurism has been dead for a long time. I'm sorry if  it took  you a while to notice.<p>

I don't know about the rest of you, but I have to admit that, although I have no doubt that the USA, where basketball was invented and where the best in the world play, is entitled to send its best (meaning the pros) to the Olympics, I am pretty underwhelmed by the attitude exhibited by Barkley and Co.  Playing on the Dream Team is most assuredly not THEIR dream, it's ours.  They look and act as if they could care less.  The drama, and hence the appeal, of the Olympics comes from the athletes who have sacrificed and struggled to get to the Olympics -- and who show some genuine emotion when they win or lose.  I'm thinking of the American wrestler who cried unashamedly when, having given his best, came up short against the Russian.   Barkley and Co. aren't exactly sacrificing anything to go to the Olympics -- except maybe a couple of rounds of golf.<p> 

There are journalists here who have written columns expressing the hope that the DT loses (which is, of course, their 1st Amd. right . . .).<p>

The following private reply was sent to me.  I'll post it here without attribution, since the sentiment may be shared by others:<p> 

subject:Dream Teams v. Amateurs<br>
David, I could not agree with you more!  As soon as the basketball comes on, I change the station.  It's pretty disgusting to see these athletes display such an utter lack of sportsmanship.  My fervent hope for these Olympics is for the Dream Team to lose, preferably in the medal round. =============<p> 

Now, my reply is this:  Don't misunderstand me.  Although I am generally appalled by the DT's attitude, I'm enough of a basketball maniac that I don't want to see the Barkley Boys LOSE!  Scared, maybe.  But not lose!  As I said, "we" invented the game, and nobody does it better.  Maybe if somebody gave the DT a close game (as in, 10 points or less), they'd start acting like they're not bored to death.<p>

I don't understand the anguish over the loss of  "true" amateurs in the Olympics.  As I understand it,  the athletes in the original Greek  Olympics were quite well compensated for their efforts, and the notion that only "amateurs" could compete was introduced in the 19th century to keep the working class from spoiling the aristocrats' fun.  More recently, only the United States has paid even lip service to the amateur ideal, offering up collegians to compete against the well-supported athletes from other countries.  As to Dream Team III, I understand that basketball's international governing body was all in favor of NBA participation, and the other players seem equally in support of the idea.  I think what we are lamenting is not the demise of amateur competition in the Olympics, but the demise of a peculiarly American myth.<p>

I believe Susan first pointed out way back in the deep recesses of this thread that the United States was the last major country to hold out against bringing professionals to the Olympics.  Other countries had been doing it for years.  Case in point, other than the easy Soviet and Bloc countries:  in the Scandinavian countries, athletes would "work" for a state corp., where their job was essentially to train for competition.  Their reward was a "job" that compensated them for training, while the employer received the benefits of a great p.r./marketing tool (let's play golf with the Olympic champion).<p> 

There are a number of great points made as to whether the Olympics were ever truly amateur.  In some cases, they still are:  people who have real jobs and train in their spare time, yet are the best their country has to offer in their sport.  Generally, it seems as though the sport is one that has little to no marketing attached to it.<p> 

In New York, we have a competition called the Empire State Games, akin to the Olympics but truly amateur.  Its exciting to watch these athletes compete, as one never knows what the outcome will be (isn't that part of the excitement of sports, notwithstanding our desire for "our" team to win?).  Unfortunately, that is what  amateur sport has been reduced to:  little coverage and notice as opposed to where the pros play.  So be it.  At times, I'd rather watch high school or college sports than a pro game, given the outlandish prices attached to attending as well as the equally outlandish attitude of some pro players.  Jesse, I think this is where you'll find the last bastion of true amateur sport (aside from the fencing/shooting/etc competitions).<p>

As for the upcoming pro involvement in hockey, I have this comment: I enjoyed the 1980 Miracle on Ice more than I think I would enjoy watching a pro team attempt to call itself amateurs and win a medal.   Don't get me wrong; it will be exciting to watch the best of the best play, but its not amateur sport.  There are two completely different styles of play, and consequently two completely different attitudes in watching the sport.<p>

I am really most intrigued by this discussion on Dream Teams and its implications on the various  sports.  Here is a story which concerns the Italian soccer team which has just been played out of the first round of the Olympic tournament.<p> 

Prior to being sent to Atlanta, our soccer players were generally considered to be one of the three Italian Dream Teams, along with the water-polo players and the volleyballers.  Indeed, the Italian soccer team had just won the Under 23 European Championship for the third time in a row and was bound for further glory in Atlanta.  Instead, the major flop!<p> 

The above outcome obviously triggered harsh criticism in Italy, not only from the specialized press but also from the nearly 56 million soccer "coaches" (it appears the entire population views for this post).  Prior to the Olympics, Mr. Maldini (the team's coach) was tipped to take over the leadership of the senior national team from Mr. Sacchi, brutally ousted from the Euro England series last June.  Following the Olympics. however, it appears that Mr. Maldini is destined to accompany Mr. Sacchi in his long lonesome strolls along an alpine road, while two fresh-blooded sacrificial lambs willingly step up to substitute.<p> 

So the crucial question we are now faced with is: are our young champions still to be considered a Dream Team, or should they instead be downgraded to a "Creamed" Team which readily melted under the scorching Georgian sun?<p> 

The serious side of this story is that the very sad outcome of just this small part of the Olympics has spurred a debate as to whether pros such as our Under 23 soccer players should still be allowed to compete in the Olympics.  It is a situation where it is abundantly clear that the players were quite put out at being forced to skip their summer vacation and instead, were required to spend in excess of four weeks in compliance with monasterial regulations.  In this regard, many wondered whether our boys were motivated to the degree necessary to play in the Olympic Games, also in view of the fact that the bonus granted by the national federation in the event of a medal was not outrageously high.<p> 

Obviously, there is very little rationality in this issue, yet, insofar as soccer is concerned (football for our British participants), a real problem would seem to exist:  how can we possibly and satisfactorily combine the different needs, behaviors and mostly business-driven mentalities of pro-players with the amateurish rules by which the Olympic Games are still governed?  Returning again to the Italian team's disastrous performance in Atlanta (do we have to?), is it reasonable to expect that a bunch of amateur, however well trained, soccer players could have done better than the pro Dream Team?  Many Italians are currently posing this question: is there anybody else willing to volunteer a response?<p>

Hi Quirino (there in Italy).<br>
l. Your remarks on the Italian soccer "Dream Team" are very interesting. Since, however, our Olympic soccer team got knocked out (again) in the preliminary round, we Americans must be quite humble when it comes to Olympic soccer....maybe water polo too.<p>

2. A question for you, Quirino. It properly goes under the subfile "Drugs", but you might not tune in to it so I'm putting it here.  Please take a look at my article in the Library of this seminar; and my comments under Drug Use. Question: Have there, to your knowledge, been any cases decided by the Italian courts or by arbitrators or by domestic tribunals of Italian sports federations, whereby an athlete has<p> 

	A. challenged the legality of a sports federation's "strict liability" drug rule (and/or 	the penalty imposed based thereon) under Italian or EU law?<p>

            B. raised the issue of who, the federation or the athlete, has the burden of proof 	of a drug violation and by what standard?<p> 

	C. claimed that he or she, the athlete, has a right to receive a portion of his or her 	urine sample in order to do an independent test (and, if the athlete so chooses, to 	submit the results in evidence to support his or her innocence)? Apart from the 	l987 Gasser case (Switzerland), the series of l993-96 Katrin Krabbe cases 	(Germany), and Court of Arbitration for Sport decisions, are you aware of any 	decisions in any European country apart from Italy and the UK where A., B. and/or 	C. above have come up?<p>

I sorta feel sorry about the teams whose country can't afford uniforms, like Lithuania. And the uniforms that don't fit. A good friend and former beau is the chief coach for the Russian Federation wrestling team, and the money that used to go to them and their training is down dramatically. Somehow, putting dream team professional, no holds barred, no costs spared athletes against these guys seems unfair. Computer training, aero dynamic design of equipment and uniforms...special diets...seems like we're putting our thumb too heavily on the scale.<p>

Subject: DT and Amateurs<p> 

1.  As a number of people here have pointed out, the amateur ideal was a 19th century class concept.  It had a variety of rationales: i) that the performance of strenuous manual labor gave the laboring poor an unfair physical advantage over gentlemen, ii) that the purpose of amateur sport was to encourage physical fitness and competition among upper class young men so that they would be more fit to command their social inferiors (OW Holmes Sr., for example, wrote along those lines), iii) that common folks and mercenaries were too concerned with winning and couldn't grasp the ideals of sportsmanship and chivalry that sport was supposed to promote, and iv) that sport was essentially a social event at which outsiders didn't belong.  The result was the kind of snobbery that barred from the Henley Regatta any oarsman who had ever performed manual labor for a living; the story is well known that John Kelly, Sr. (Grace Kelly's father) was not allowed to compete in the Henley single sculls because he had once been a bricklayer, and that after he made a fortune as a contractor he had the satisfaction of seeing his son win the event.  All of that is, mercifully, behind us.  While I hugely enjoy seeing athletes who compete for the love of the sport, with no hope of remuneration, I think any restriction that keeps the best from competing against one another is arbitrary and unwarranted.<p> 

2.  I have no problem with the members of the Dream Team.  As the New Yorker pointed out last week, they hardly need the money themselves and come as close as anyone to playing for the love of what they do.  The scores are lopsided, but it was the FIBA that wanted US professionals to play in order to ultimately raise the level of the game world wide.  It would be patronizing for the DT players to get out there and dog it.<p> 

3.  What does bother me is the fans' indecent zest at these one sided victories.  I sometimes think that a lot of Americans have no more stomach for a fair fight.  The desire for blowouts is to me a symptom of  insecurity; it reminds me of the public reaction to Desert Storm.

<h2>Too Young To Compete</h2>

<h3>Seminar Discussion Thread</h3><p> 

Last Append: Wed July 31 07:09:05 1996<p>

Last Sunday, 60 Minutes did a disturbing segment on American women's
gymnastics.  The segment focused on the immense psychological and physical
strain these young women have to go through in order to excel and, perhaps,
become champions.  Several gymnasts interviewed stated they were
psychologically abused, by both coaches and parents, when they couldn't
keep their weight down during training.<p>  

Adding fuel to the fire, 60 Minutes revealed that at the 1976 Games, the
average American female gymnast weighed 106 lbs., was 17 1/2 yrs. old, and
stood 5' 3".  In 1992, the average American female gymnast weighed 83 lbs.,
was 16 yrs. old, and stood 4' 9".  Quite a big difference.<p> 

Although I usually find 60 Minutes to be a somewhat credible news-program,
I must say that I felt this segment went a bit over the top.  Obviously,
forcing young girls to starve themselves in order to achieve Olympic
greatness is morally reprehensible.  The differences in age and weight
between the 1976 and 1992 team is quite alarming.  Yet, isn't it also true
that these lighter, younger, more diminutive women are superior gymnasts
because of these very attributes?  Is allowing Dominique Moceanu the
ability to represent the U.S. in these 1996 games such a bad thing?  At 13,
Moceanu became the youngest senior U.S. champion (she's now 14).  Should
someone like Moceanu be prevented from competing at the highest levels of
competition simply due to her age and weight?  Wasn't Nadia Comaneci of
similar age and stature?<p>   

The USOC has drawn at least one line here.  In the 2000 Olympic Games, the
USOC has set a minimum age for female gymnasts - 16.  Yet, should this step
be taken at all?  Will an age requirement prevent young gymnasts from
starving themselves in order to better perform?  Will it prevent their
parents from obsessing over their child-star's career?<p> 

What steps should be taken to protect these young women, without
compromising their potential to medal at higher competitions?<p>

Such has been the topic of discussion in women's gymnastics (or really

review of this topic, check out a recent book, I think called "Little Girls
in Pretty Boxes" for a discussion on this topic.<p>

On the same subject --<p> 


Did anybody besides me find it absolutely chilling that the young woman on the US gymnastics team competed despite, as I understood the reports, a severely sprained ankle.  Her pain on dismount was palpable.<p>   

The book referred to in the prior post is by Joan Ryan, a San Francisco reporter, who  was interviewed on Sunday ( a repeat, I think) on 60 Minutes, about the unbelievable abuses, both physical and psychological, to the young girls who compete in gymnastics.  One of the routine issues, she said, was that the young women are pushed to compete when injured, which, said Ryan, would NEVER happen in football.  Ryan has recently published a book on the subject.<p>  

The coach, Bella  (?) is apparently notorious for pushing the girls -- and refused to be interviewed by the 60 minutes reporter.<p>

Clearly Strug was injured when she did her last vault.  But, did she vault because she was under Bela's control, or because she had a dream of winning the gold & knew this was the only way to make that happen.  She is an 18 year old woman capable of making choices.<p> 

Also, what are the real downsides to aggravating the sprain?  Unless I'm mistaken, it wasn't going to kill her or cripple her.  Perhaps it will affect her ability to compete in the future, but this is probably her final Olympics (she'll be 22 in Sydney).  What would she be saving herself for?  This, as they say, is come to Jesus time.  If the vault would not be likely (or possible) to do her permanent physical harm that would affect her doing normal activities, then maybe she should go for it.<p> 

You must admit, for a moment she was on top of the world.  People everywhere were hailing her as a hero & inspired by her courageous act.  In one of the most dramatic sports moments I've ever seen, she came through.  I've never been anywhere near doing anything remotely like that, but, I must imagine that a sprained ankle is a small price to pay for such an experience.<p> 

One other point, if she hadn't vaulted she would not have gone to the allaround competition (Dominique M. was ahead of her).  So her only hope for best allaround was to risk injury.  A tough choice, but one that had to be made.<p> 

Finally, I'm not sure about Ryan's comment that football players would never be pushed to compete when injured.  That may be true, but it flies in the face of everything I've ever heard about football (from high school through pros).  Playing with pain is part of the game.  When men do it they're heroes.  When a similarly aged woman does it we worry she's being manipulated.  Maybe we shouldn't be so paternalistic & sexist.  (Monica, this is not a comment to your post, but rather to an attitude I've heard expressed by others, including Ms. Ryan).<p>

I've got to go with Dave on this one. I was friendly with a lot of the football players when I was in college at Duke, NOT a great football school. I remember friends of mine getting injections (of Novocain or cortisone, I think) in the middle of a game to numb the pain caused by an on the field injury, so they could keep playing. When the game ended, they were worse off than they would have been had they sat out when injured.<p>

A couple thoughts after watching last night's women's (girls'??) team finals:<p> 

It is apparent why smaller is better, especially after seeing Dominique Moceanu's mastery of the balance beam, an apparatus at which the US has met its Olympic Waterloo more than once.  Obviously, the smaller you are, the less of a challenge it is to land on a surface four inches wide.<p> 

At the same time, it is also painfully apparent that younger is not always better.  How else to explain Moceanu's sitting down two vaults in a row -- vaults which did not even carry a potential for a "10" score?  Even the NBC commentators were at a loss.<p>  

Although I did not see the 60 Minutes segment referred to above, I am in agreement with the position that the gymnasts are pushed much too hard and hounded mercilessly about their weight and appearance.  To wit, recall the case a couple of years ago of Christy Hentrich, a US gymnast who died of anorexia.<p>  


I think that as long as the US fans and TV networks milk the stories and endorse the "little pixie" image, it will continue.  To a large extent, parents will want to enjoy vicariously the glory that is Olympic Gold, and they will always find a coach willing to go along for the ride.<p>   

As far as the "playing with pain" -- what we saw Carrie Strugg do last night was definitely THE story of the Games.  I don't think anything can top that.  Obviously, she did not compete the entire night with the sprained ankle; it was only after she knew that the US would lose the gold medal that she tried the second vault.  This was an act of tremendous intestinal fortitude, IMHO.  I would also venture to guess that various other athletes in other sports would have done the same thing.  As pointed out previously, Carrie was not risking debilitation or worse, this was probably her last competition, and she was not eligible at the time for the individual all-around.<p> 

All it took was one look at her face on the medal stand to know it was well worth it!<p>

I think in this discussion it is also important to keep in mind age restrictions in other sports.  Tennis and hockey are two notable examples.  In tennis the action regarding age restriction developed more as a result of the emotional problems of the young athletes rather than any physical issues as in gymnastics.<p> 

Further, we can' t leave out early entry into the NBA.<p>

Subject: Moral Dilemma<p> 

Are their some individuals whose talent is so rare that the world is better off if their childhood is sacrificed so that we all can benefit from that talent?<p> 

Furthermore, aren't their some individuals, even young girls (Mary Lou Retton comes to mind), who are well-grounded enough to make the commitment to endure this type of training, given the potential benefit of being one of the best at the world at what you do?<p> 

It seems to me that the abuses alleged in the 60 minutes piece are standard-issue coaching manipulation techniques.  Not that they don't seem somewhat shocking when applied to little girls, but they are part of the stick and carrot approach which all top coaches employ (including the very top high school coaches of male athletes).  There is no doubt that the top students of these coaches have an incredible amount of affection and loyalty to them.<p> 

I found the most condemning part of the 60 minutes piece to be the abuse inflicted by the parents of each of the girls.  This has also been shown in tennis, with the fathers of Mary Pierce and Jennifer Capriati, for example.  Parents can either provide proper perspective, support and love, and thereby temper the worst parts of this training, or they may exacerbate the situation to a terrible extreme.<p>

what a thoughtful discussion!<p>

I do resonate to the "come to Jesus" component -- and think that's a very valid point. and I think it's a very significant point that she is a young adult, and not a pre-teen, and capable of making that choice. And finally, if in fact the ankle injury was not that severe before the event, but was aggravated by the event, then I don't find that so problematic.  

but Joan Ryan's points -- and the 60 minutes interview -- were indeed very very chilling, especially listening to the young athletes articulate how they were belittled, called cows, etc., and ultimately felt their lives were over because they hit puberty.  And yes, the point about the parents is very well taken.  I thought the one mother was very very moving who said that she would go to her grave with guilt over allowing her daughter to be manipulated and humiliated by overbearing coaches.<p>  

Did I read somewhere that with the next Olympics, there will be an age 16 limit put on the gymnasts?<p>

I understand from the commentary (I can't believe I actually learned something from that vapid commentary) that, beginning in the 2000 Olympics athletes will have to be sixteen in an Olympic year to compete.<p>  

I was surprised to find out, however, that there is already a rule saying that the athletes have to be at least 15 in an Olympic year to compete. The reason 14 year-olds (like Dominique M.) compete is that they expect to turn 15 later in the year that the Olympics are held. So this is not as big of a change as I thought when I initially heard of the rule change.<p> 

I also heard that the average age of the American women's gymnastics team is 18 this time around, up from 16.5 four years ago, despite the much-discussed youth of the youngest member of the team.<p>

Subject: Too Young To Compete?<p> 

I found myself caught up in the drama of the Strug final vault last night, watching on the edge of the sofa with my eight year old daughter who stayed up late specially to watch the US women's gymnastic team.   As lawyers we tend to be very competitive by and large and relate to risk and winning.  When I speculate whether I would have taken that last vault given the overall circumstances at her age, I think I would have made the same decision.   I found myself admiring her for her courage to move beyond pain and injury and persevere on behalf of her team.<p> 

Yet,  as I looked at the crowd reaction and the values that my own daughter was absorbing I couldn't help but wonder how healthy it is to reward our youth for persevering in pain and through injury to win a contest (albeit a major contest).  This young woman didn't struggle across a battle field to save a life, yet a reporter referred to her as a hero.<p> 

We pay our professional sports players to play well into serious permanent injury in their careers.  Is it a value we wish to instill in our youth, to ignore their pain or injuries in order to win?<p>   

The newspaper report I read indicated Strug had no feeling in her injured leg prior to the second vault and that her ankle was dislocated.  Perhaps she won't be or wasn't permanently injured.  I failed to observe much analysis given to the potential for serious injury to Strug prior to the second vault, but observed instead a coach urging her to go on, yelling "You can do it".  I can only hope that as a professional coach he was adept at assessing her physical situation and did so with her best interest at heart.  It didn't seem that way, however.<p>  

All and all, as an adult woman guiding children into the future, I seriously question  the values this event teaches our next generation.  I'm happy the US team won, but  I worry what the next generation will sacrifice in order to win again, in the Olympics and other aspects of life.  From an adult perspective, I don't think I would have  taken the second vault as tempting as it may have been.<p>

You can put many spins on this, but consider that Strug courageously overcame personal difficulties for the good of her team.  Is this a bad lesson?<p> 

As was noted earlier, there seems to be a real gender split on the perceptions involved here.  As women's sports become bigger, are we being forced to confront issues that we have ignored with young men?  How many Olympic boxers started taking their licks in the ring in their early teen years?<p>

Catherine, I have to disagree with you.  I think Strug did teach a good lesson.  Life is (often) pain.  The ability to put that behind you and concentrate on the goal is an important one.  I imagine you teach your daughter that the good & important things are difficult, that things don't come easy.  She knows that to succeed in school she has to put in many hours studying, even though it's not fun.  Strug taught us that when adversity comes you persevere through it & prevail.  That young woman gave us an object lesson.<p> 

A complaint about the current generation (of which I am a member) is that we're lazy & don't want to put in the effort to succeed.  The athletes show us what is possible if you work hard (the amount of training they go through is unreal).<p>   

I also contend that Strug is a hero.  She may not have saved a life, but she did commit a selfless act (which is a hallmark of heroism).  Faced with pain, she continued, for the greater good of the team (& country).  That is heroism.<p>

I must comment on the statement that the techniques used by Bela Karoly (sp?) are the same as those used by coaches on young male athletes, with resulting success and loyalty.  I think we as a society ought to take a hard look at what effect that sort of military, "blame-and-shame" treatment has upon a person's personality, his or her self image, and relationships later in life.  I think it's tremendously damaging, and I won't let any teacher or coach treat either my son or my daughter that way.  I hope they both have the chance to feel the satisfaction, pride and camaraderie that go along with participating in sports, but I hope they never feel that their worth as persons rides on what they do on a playing field or gym floor.<p> 

On the other hand, in our society, you are not outcast and shamed if you don't come home with a medal, which is what the NBC commentary led me to believe will happen to the poor Chinese gymnasts.<p> 

Also, the look on Kerri Strug's face didn't convince me--she looked none too sure about what was going on.  All Bela's girls seem to look at him with faces of dogs who have been beaten into submission--grateful for the current affection, but uncertain about when the next abuse will occur.<p>

I think that Catherine has a point on the Strug matter.  I was watching too, and likewise with the rest of you I was caught up in the competition, rooting for the good old US of A.  But my own daughter has competed in gymnastics, and for this reason I was particularly alerted to the circumstances immediately following Strug's first vault, the one in which she suffered a foot injury.  She obviously was in severe pain, and the eyes in her pain-expressing and frightened face were searching among her coaches as to what to do.  What a pregnant pause!  As an aside here, I should mention that Bella later said that Strug was the last one on the team whom he would have expected to have the courage to vault while in pain.  So the response from Bella to her frightened, painful look this time was "Come on, you can do it!  You can do it!  We need it one more time!"  Now not once did anyone there, not a single coach, not even Bella, run up to Strug and check out the injury.  We, on hindsight, accept that it was "only" an ankle sprain; but no one *knew* that at the time!  She was yelled at to go and vault again, without any knowledge as to the extent of her injury.  30,000 strong in the packed arena are chanting "USA!  USA!"  What was this little girl to do?  I'm sorry, but I don't see that she made a free choice.  Talk about duress!<p> 

As a matter of fact, she did not even have to make the second vault in order for the USA to win the gold medal.  There were two remaining Russian gymnasts on floor exercises.  NBC reported at the time that they would have had to have scored a 10.00 and a 9.95 in order for the USA to get silver instead of gold, two scores that those judges had given no one all night long!  And, as it turned out, they only got 9.75 apiece, which was about average.<p> 

So assume under these circumstances that Strug's foot, which has more bones in it than any other part of the body, had one or more broken bones and/or torn tendons and ligaments, all from having planted the foot wrong on her first vault landing.  Under many such circumstances she still could have walked to the second vault.  But a second vault would have caused another landing, and on that same foot, now injured!  Also a push off with that foot, and its Achilles tendon, which possibly also was injured.  No one knew!  The risk of a more severe injury to the already injured foot, by repeating the very same activity that injured the foot the first time, was patent.  The only question was how bad the more severe injury would be!  Given the circumstances in this paragraph, it was possible that Strug would cause *permanent* injury to her foot in a second vault, at least one requiring one or more surgeries.  And for what?  As if that should matter.  The gold was as good as in our pocket already!<p> 

And this gets us back to the question in this thread of abuse of a child.  If a child is involved in gymnastics of this international hype and national glory, there ought to be some sort of "Amicus" of the child ("Amicus Parvulae"), whether at the behest of the IOC or the USOC, who can step in at any point and enjoin immediately any activity s/he rules to be abusive.  The child deserves that kind of protection from any excessive glory-seekers around him/her and the chanting crowd.  If there is any kind of injury, such as Strug's, it would be the responsibility of the Amicus Parvulae at least to stop the proceedings and to check it out, including calling for a medical examination of the child.  Additionally, Strug was representing the USA, you and me.  We at least ought to set up a procedure designed to protect her from abuse, physical as well as psychological, under circumstances where she is representing us.  If no Amicus Parvulae, then at least some sort of independent on-site arbitrator skilled in such matters and whose decision would be binding.<p> 

We Olympics arbitrators already are in place for "disputes" where there is time to hear them.  Why not add Referees for Child Abuse? The cost would be minimal, and I believe worth it!<p>

Wow -- Melanie's "dog abuse" analogy is incredibly powerful and right on the money for me.  I watched more of the recaps last night, and I just can't shake this feeling that something is not right.<p>  

And with all due respect, I just don't buy the argument that this is about sexism. I would feel *exactly* the same way about coaches pushing young male ball players.  And speaking of boxing, I am utterly repelled by boxing -- I don't see any value in beating people up for sport.  It glorifies violence and destruction.<p>  

While I resonate to the arguments about the positive values of "going for the gold," and the related positive values of health, teamwork, etc., I also think there is a dangerous undercurrent  when those goals turn into obsessions.  And after watching the reports about Bella, and watching the interviews, I am not convinced that his interactions with most of these girls are, in the long run, positive.  Yes, the gal in question is 18, and that is a BIG difference. But still.  I urge anybody who finds this discussion intriguing to buy Joan Ryan's book -- or find someone with a video of her 60 Minutes video.  It puts a lot of this into perspective.<p>

After reading the various posts in this thread, several thoughts come to mind:<p> 

1.  We all tend to see what we want to see in this situation.  I, for one, didn't see the "dog fear" look in the eyes of the gymnasts, but then, I hadn't followed all the "Bela Is Bad" publicity.  In retrospect, I still don't see it.  And I certainly didn't see it in the eyes of the young women as they received their gold medals.  Kerry S. didn't look particularly overjoyed, but then, she was in pain.<p> 

2.  Was there duress on Kerry to do the last vault?  Maybe.  But I'm not sure it was as severe as was described by one of the respondents above -- that sounded to me like a closing argument to a jury (and a darn good one, too).  Remember that even though we saw it on TV, we weren't THERE and cannot possibly know everything that went on.  At any rate, Kerry made the choice to do the vault, and years from now, I suspect she'll be glad she did.  I note that it was reported today that Amanda Borden, one of the U.S. women gymnasts, has decided to postpone college and embark on an "exhibition tour" with some of the other team members.   Cashing in?  Perhaps.  And why not?<p>  

3.  You've got to admit, that moment was priceless in terms of drama.  And if we parents put the proper spin on it, it serves as a powerful lesson to our own children.  Sacrifice, deferred gratification, the value of the team -- these are values that are often noticeably absent in the children of us Baby Boomers (we weren't exactly too hot on those values ourselves in the 60s and 70s).  Seeing Kerry's heroic (yes) performance certainly seemed to inspire my 14-year old daughter!<p>

Subject: Under Bela's Control?<p> 

I disagree with the comments that Strug is cowering in fear of Bela.  I find it instructive that after the last Olympics Strug left Bela (he retired for a while from coaching elite gymnasts).  She bounced around from coach to coach for a while, but finally came back to Bela.  Perhaps she's like the abuse victim who keeps returning to the abuser, but I don't think so.  After 4 years away from Bela (especially the 14 to 18 year old years), I doubt she'd go back if he was emotionally abusing her.<p> 

I'm sure many coaches do go too far.  But, the fact that they're not all sweetness & light at all times doesn't make it abusive.  Many coaches do use strong techniques to bring out the maximum performance in their athletes.  I know in school I had professors who were quite demanding &, at the time I thought, abusive.  But, they used those techniques to show us what we could achieve.  Schools such as VMI & the Citadel use the so-called "aversive" method of instruction.  Perhaps it's just abuse, but it seems to work.   Mary Lou worked under Bela for many years & she seems to still hold affection for him 12 years later.<p>

Subject: Playing with Pain<p> 

According to the reports I've seen, Strug is a 19 year old woman, not a helpless child.  I think she was completely capable of deciding whether the gain was worth the pain.  Nor do I find her choice particularly surprising.  Both amateur and professional athletes routinely compete despite pain and injury.  For example, I've watched basketball players lace up and play despite a sprained ankle or even a separated shoulder, and I've watched football players compete despite broken bones.  Although it always amazes me, it never surprises me.   As for Strug, she toughed it out , gave it her all, and won the gold medal.  I'm impressed.<p>   

I have to wonder whether there would have been this much controversy if Strug had been a 19 year old male gymnast.  Why do we presume that a woman gymnast must have been dominated by her male coach?  Why can't we just accept that all Olympians -- both male and female -- are tough competitors?<p>

Let's not all gang up on Kerri Strug. She is not a helpless minor -- she is an adult Olympic athlete who puts up with pain as a matter of course. No one should be able to tell this 18 year old woman what she can and cannot do.<p> 

But what about 14-year old Dominique Moceanu competing with a stress fracture in her leg? I think that should be of much greater concern to us from a legal standpoint. Strugg should be able to decide whether or not to compete because she is old enough to make the decision for herself. But what about 14-year old Moceanu? Did she compete with a stress fracture because she didn't want let her family down? Or her friends? Or -- worst of all -- her coach?<p> 

The argument does not only apply to gymnastics. Consider what would happen if 15 year old swimmer Amanda Beard suffered a similar injury. Or a 15 year old tennis player.<p>  

I think it is of much greater concern when a minor is pushed towards greatness rather than an adult who is similarly pushed but who is legally held to have the ability to push back and refuse to compete.<p>

I guess one of the indicators is the young women gymnasts who have died of anorexia.  I don't remember the name(s).     And the others who have attempted suicide upon reaching puberty.  Cites supra.<p>  

And it's not just male coaches. I assume some of the coaches are female, and the parents, of both sexes, have been cited as equally demanding.  (Another example: Tanya Harding, to switch specialties)<p>    

I *really* don't think this is about sexism.  But that's just my humble opinion.<p>

Subject: Anorexia & Suicides<p> 

It is tragic that gymnasts have died of anorexia & attempted suicide, just as it is tragic when any girl (or anyone) dies of anorexia or suicide.  However, does anyone know the rates of these occurrences in gymnasts (of figure skaters) vs. the rest of the teenage girl population?  Adolescence is a difficult time for everyone & many girls become anorexic & many attempt suicide.  I don't know if we can say that the sport led them to these things.<p>  


Clearly gymnastics puts pressure on young girls.  But, a girl who attempts suicide apparently because she has hit puberty & can't compete anymore, might not have really done so for that reason.  If a girl tries to kill herself because her boyfriend breaks up with her we usually look for a deeper reason (e.g., clinical depression).<p>   

Additionally, I thought sports were a great thing for girls?  I've read many stories saying that girls involved in sports have much higher self esteem & much lower teen pregnancy rates.  All of the attention on women's gymnastics this time is good for women's sports & women in general.  I'm normally not a big fan of women's sports (don't enjoy women's basketball).  But, I was mesmerized Tuesday night.  Strugg's second vault was one of the most exciting sports moments I've seen./1/  It really lifted women's sports.<p>  


/1/  I think Strugg's vault did more for women's sports than, say, Nadia's 10 because it was not beauty & grace being demonstrated, but sheer courage & will.  So, men could really identify with this.  If you'll note the comparisons being made are between Strugg & male athletes.  So, I think many men now look at what women gymnasts (& also other athletes do) as being "real."  I'm not saying I condone an attitude that thought less of women's sports before this, but I think one must admit the attitude was there.<p>

David,<p> 

I think you raise some very strong points.<p>  

I completely agree with you that in most cases, sports -- for either boys or girls -- can be terrific ways to teach leadership, teamwork, health, etc. etc.    My nieces both excel at soccer  and I am delighted to see how their self-esteem and confidence has been built up.<p>   

A woman named Betty Harrigan wrote a pivotal book years ago, called "Games Your Mother Never Taught You."  Her premise then was that boys had a terrific advantage over girls because they learned - through organized sports -- how to interact and be a team. I read the book in my 20s and it had a profound affect on me (and a LOT of other women).   The book helped many of us compete and prosper in work environments.<p> 


The problems begin, I think, when winning -- at any cost -- becomes the primary goal. And  after  Ryan's & 60 Minutes'  reports  I remain concerned about the Bellas of the world.   A charismatic controlling adult can easily have incredible influence over a young person -- be they male or female.  Esp. when the child's parents are reinforcing that reality.  It can often be good  (I think back on an incredibly nurturing high school teacher who encouraged me to pursue my writing) or bad.<p>  

When a young girl becomes so obsessed with gymnastics that when she hits puberty she thinks  her life is OVER, then something is wrong. That's an obsession, not a healthy outlet.  And call me Californian, but in my book, it's inexcusable to call any young person a "cow"  when you are in a position of power and influence.<p> 


Maybe that's the bottom line: These coaches, like teachers, have a responsibility to treat the children with compassion, care and respect. Not like dogs. Otherwise, society pays the price.<p>

You're right on the money regarding referring to any child as a "cow" -- that is certainly abusive.  Someone up the thread, however, raised an excellent point regarding the depression/suicide rate among young female gymnasts vs. the rate among the general young female population.  For  girls reaching adolescence, the incidence of depression is enormous.  To anyone who has a teenage daughter (as I do), or is otherwise interested, I highly recommend a book called "Reviving Ophelia:  Saving the Selves of Adolescent Girls," by Mary Pipher.  It's not just the Belas of the world, it's society in general, and hormones, and everything else.  I'm not ready to say that Bela is the monster that some make him out to be -- but I just know that I wouldn't subject my daughter to that kind of regimen.<p>

As the person who made the "dog" analogy, I should point out that I think what Keri did was very gutsy and admirable in many ways.  I just find that the interaction between her and her coach is  unsettling.<p> 

Watching gymnastics again last night, I was very disturbed to see the coaches' reactions to both Shannon Miller's and Dominique Dawes' tears (after they each stepped off the mat during the floor exercise).  Shannon's coach kept saying "Stop crying!"  Both of them were left by themselves on the bench, told to quit having emotional reactions to what must have been a devastating experience.  As a parent and a wife, I have discovered that people feel a lot better, and get past negative emotions much more quickly, when you validate the feelings instead of denying them.  Why didn't anyone comfort these girls?  Why didn't anyone acknowledge their pain?  This isn't the army--it's sports!<p> 

Finally, I don't think the parents have much real ability to control decisions made during events--and I'm not sure they should.  Imagine the chaos if every time a coach made a decision, an angry parent could come down from the stands and overrule it!  No, I think that if coaches knew there was some sort of objective, organized oversight into their treatment of their team members, they would temper their behavior.<p>

 Subject: Crying<p> 

I heard Miller's coach tell her to stop crying.  I didn't find his comments as harsh as Melanie did.   First, he didn't seem to be shouting a command, but rather making a suggestion (I would exclude the exclamation mark from my transcript).  Second, it is arguable that he's looking out for Miller's interests.  He said "Stop crying, everyone's watching."  Which is true.  Her face was on the Jumbotron & millions (billions) of people were watching her.  Perhaps she will be glad that she held back the tears until later, rather than having such a (justifiably) emotional moment in front of the world.  Clearly you can validate feelings without expressing them to the world.  I don't think a person who is informed at work of a tragic event would be accused of repressing feelings by remaining composed until in private, & then crying.<p> 

OTOH, the weepiest group I've seen is the wrestlers.  (See Dick Enberg's piece on Wednesday night).  Everyone of them was bawling after their matches.  In a kind of reverse of the norm, that was considered great, while the gymnasts crying was seen as weakness.  I guess a tough wrestler has proved his manhood enough to be able to cry in public, while a gymnast crying is just proving she's a little girl.  Cf. Pat Schroeder's crying when leaving the race in '88 (?) with all the male candidates who turn on the tears like faucets (Clinton, Dole etc.).<p>

I saw compassion and trying to look out for the best interests of both Miller and Dawes.  Miller's coach hugged her, asked several times whether she was okay, and then tried to calm her down, talking her through the routine and then telling her to stop crying, that everyone was watching, that she had to pull herself together -- she still had to vault.  Dawes' coach did the same.<p>   

These women have worked most of their lives to get to this point.  What people seem to forget is that their coaches have, too.  They have sweated and worked and agonized for years as well.  I thought the coaches of all the U.S. women have been much more empathetic than I would have imagined them to be.  No screaming.  No yelling. No "how could you screw up like that?"  Nothing.  Nothing but encouraging them, telling them they did their best (Karolyi hugging Morcheau after her floor routine).<p> 

I don't know that any of us can really understand what these girls/women go through, or sit here in front of our computers and determine what's right or wrong with this picture.  Personally, I believe that Olympic athletes are driven and motivated beyond what we can imagine.  That is their personality.  There's a fire inside them.  While I suppose there can be Svengali stories or horror stories of pushy parents, I think we're more likely to find those stories in Little Leagues and high school sports than in the Olympic arena.  To get to this level, you have to have more than just talent and people pushing you.  You have to have a fire burning in your gut.  You have to really really want it.<p> 

Kerri wanted it.  I'm sure that if she had it to do over again in the same situation, i.e.  where she didn't know that she didn't have to take the second vault, she'd do the same thing.  Who knows, perhaps she'd do the same thing even if she somehow could have known the team had locked the gold, because she knew she wouldn't qualify for the all-around or for the vault finals if she didn't try.<p>   

I'm sure there are abuses in every sport.  (I'm sure there are abuses outside of sports.  What about the young children whose parents stick flash cards in their faces when they're infants and push them academically and on five different musical instruments and twelve different extracurricular activities instead of just letting them be kids?  Is there any difference?)  But I don't think that that fact alone is reason to condemn this woman, her coaches, her parents, or the Olympic Games.  The potential for serious trouble -- whether it is a dominating coach, parents who want their child to live their dreams for them, eating disorders, societal notions of what's good and beautiful -- must always be acknowledged and watched for and guarded against and dealt with when it exists.  In the meantime, let's acknowledge that it is possible that Kerri Struggs is a young woman who had the inner courage and fortitude and drive to do something that will inspire men and women alike for years to come.<p>

Subject: Too Young To Compete?<p> 

In response to Catherine Ross'  comments on Ms. Strug's Olympic performance, I must say that I too probably would have "gone for the gold" if I was in Ms. Strug's position; but now that I am older, wiser, and contain a bit less energy in my body, I would not have made that choice at my present age.  However, I believe that is just one of the great things about youth --- the willingness to take chances and live life to its fullest.  As I reflect on my adolescent years and as I watch my two young children experience daily encounters and follow through on their curiosity, I am convinced that the only way we learn is through experience and following satisfying our insatiable curiosity when we are young and willing.<p>   

Ms. Strug will always remember the 1996 Olympics and will have a story to tell her grandchildren.  At least she was willing to take a chance and not let life pass her by.  Hooray for the exuberance of youth!<p>

I don't necessarily see the responses as sexist, but it is undeniable that our reactions to 5 foot tall young female athletes is quite different than for young males.  Did anyone suggest that a 17-year-old Eric Lindross should be protected from the rigors of NHL training and games?<p> 

And what of the occasional prodigies--Mary Lou Retton perhaps--who seem to be fairly mature for their age.  Should they be denied the opportunity to seize their moment?  How do we distinguish?  Should a young Mozart have been allowed to be so obsessively involved in his work?<p>

So, now, what if there *had* been an "Amicus Puerae" or an "Arbitrator Medicalis Puerae" and the independent ruling had been that Strugg should not vault a second time due to her injury?  The chances are excellent that she would have been in position to win **2** more gold medals for the good ole US of A, in the individual vault and the individual floor competitions.  However, due to the severity of the injury aggravated by her second vault, which was *unnecessary* to win the team gold medal, she now cannot even *compete* for these two gold medals.  I say a loss to Kerri, and a loss to her country.<p> 

More importantly, I suggest, there *ought* to be someone responsible for personally *examining* all medical injuries and making the decision whether or not the competitor can continue.  They do it in *boxing*, for God's sake.  Adult or child.  Why wasn't there someone there to even *examine* Kerri?  No one here has addressed this human (and legal) issue.<p>

<BR><BR>
The Olympic Charter of the IOC states in Rule 47 that : 
<BR><BR>
"There may be no age limit for competitors in the Olympic Games other than as prescribed for health reasons in the competition rules of an IF [International Federation]." 
<BR><BR>
Has the IF of Gymnastics shown scientific evidence that proves gymnastics is not healthy for younger gymnasts?  Then why do little boys and girls start at the age of 4? 
<BR><BR>
I believe that the IF has taken over the parents' role and is dictating how a family should treat its children.  If the parent wants to put his or her child through the rigors of competitive gymnastics, then that is his or her decision along with the child's.  Who is to say that the 14-year-old does not want to put herself through such rigors?  When I was 14 years old and playing ice hockey, I played through all sorts of obstacles because I knew myself and my limits and my parents recognized my awareness for my body and my drive for perfection.  Why are we treating these gymnasts any different?  Because they are sweet little girls?  While I do recognize that there is a pervasive problem with anorexia and bulimia in gymnastics (as with many other sports), this is not an age problem, but a problem to be addressed by the sport as a whole. 
<BR><BR>
I believe that the IF has taken a patronistic role in this age issue.  They should take a scientific role and provide evidence from a scientific background.  Basically, I think this is age discrimination.

I fall somewhere between Dave G. and Monica on this issue.  On the one hand, I think that the coaching methods used in women's gymnastics at the world class level are pretty reprehensible, and I don't think it's quite fair to paint Bela Karolyi as the lone villain of the piece.  Steve Nunno et al. are probably just as bad.  The problem with using "aversive" coaching methods, as Dave suggests, is that with gymansts you're dealing with preadolescent girls who, as countless studies have shown, have very fragile self-images to begin with, and telling them things ("you're a cow," "you're too big," etc. etc.) that play off this fragility and create this almost maniacal desire to please the coach and do whatever it takes to be the best (whatever that means). 
<BR><BR>
However, I do think that once a girl reaches a certain age, she indeed has the capacity to make decisions in her own best interests (without the "help" of any sort of Amicus Parvulae or other paternalistic watchdog) and decide for herself whether, for instance, to take that second vault.  We have to give girls/women the same credit we give boys in this situation and not ask ourselves whether we need to "protect" these athletes from themselves/their parents/their coaches. 
<BR><BR>
I think that even a forty year old woman who found herself in Kerry Strug's position the other night would have done exactly the same thing, and we wouldn't even have thought twice about it, or questioned whether the impetus for the act had really been hers or had come from her Svengali, Karolyi. 
<BR><BR>
On a related topic, why isn't anyone up in arms about all these 14 and 15 year old American female swimmers who are tearing up the pool?  Why doesn't anyone question their youth and call for age restrictions on competition?

Did anyone else see the irony in the background of one of the US divers.  (Can't recall her name, but I think she's about 14, compared to 30-something Mary Ellen Clark.) 
<BR><BR>
She started out as a gymnast with Bela Karolyi, but had to retire when she developed a stress fracture in her back (!) at the age of 8 (!).  Announcers could only comment on how fortunate for all that her parents found another sport for her to compete in (!), and Cynthia Potter (who was marvelous, by the way) pointed out that persistent back pain has interfered with her training, and also with her execution at these Olympics. 
<BR><BR>
It's clear (to me at least) that their daughter's health is not of primary concern to these parents.

Story around Atlanta is that if you want a Pepsi, drive across the border
to Florida and make a left at Jacksonville. You see, Coca-Cola is an
Olympic sponsor, so only the products of the Atlanta-based company may be
found in the Olympic city. Coke paid millions for the right to be the
exclusive soda of the Games. From document reproduction machines to
automobiles to game shows, there are hundreds of official Olympic
sponsors.<p> 

Some have criticized these Games as TOO corporate. Others have justified
the deals as American capitalism at its best. Which is it? How far is too
far for Olympic sponsorship?<p>

Perhaps two examples of corporate sponsorship clouding NBC's ability to
properly do its job:<p> 

In between the telecast of the women's 400 meter freestyle (in which Janet
Evans did not compete after failing to make it through her qualifying heat)
and NBC's Jim Gray's interview with Evans (at which she told of her
disappointment in not making the finals), NBC reportedly aired a Cadillac
commercial featuring no one other than...Janet Evans.<p> 

Later, at a similarly inappropriate moment, NBC aired a commercial for AT&T
also featuring Evans.<p>

Ted, query whether the tremendous Olympic sponsorships actually  effectuate
the Olympic ideal in some perverse way.  If the Olympic ideal includes
freedom and the ability to achieve, aren't the huge Olympic sponsorships
one manifestation of that ideal?  Aren't they merely the operation of the
free market?<p>

National Public Radio reported yesterday that cans of coke were being sold
at a set price of  $4 per can, which is probably how Coke was going to make
back the dough it spent on becoming the official soft drink.   NPR reported
however that the price soon dropped to $2 per can because non-official
vendors were selling Pepsi at $1 per can.  I am delighted at this proof
that the free enterprise system can function in the face of officialdom.<p>

Subject: Reebock vs. Nike<p> 

Perhaps the Games will teach some corporate sponsors that it's better to
stay home and save some cash.<p>   

Reebock reportedly paid over $20 million for the right to proclaim itself
the "official Olympic footwear supplier," and the right to air ads during
network Olympic coverage.  A wise investment?  Perhaps not.<p> 

Nike, In response to Reebock's official Olympic status, has thrown a
stinging counter-punch by indirectly associating themselves with the Summer
Games even though they're not an official sponsor. Nike is airing several
Olympic-like ads (without saying "Olympic" of course) outside network
Olympic coverage showcasing several Olympic athletes who have endorsement
deals with Nike (e.g., Carl Lewis).  In addition, it's almost impossible
not to notice the Nike logo prominently displayed on the shoes and shirts
of hundreds, if not thousands of Olympic athletes competing in the
games.<p> 

It seems that by spending big money on athlete endorsements, Nike has
ironically saved themselves some cash.<p>

That's correct, Jay.  Although I believe Visa has done better as of late.  American Express cards still aren't accepted by Olympic ticket agents.<p> 

Interestingly, some companies who pay for Olympic sponsorship privileges aren't as concerned with the bottom line.  International Paper Co., says it's hoping their Olympic tie-in will generate "pride and excitement" among its own employees.  NationsBank, which recently went through a series of mergers, is using its Olympic status to build brand-name recognition over several states.<p>

In the lead-up to the Olympics, the ACOG  talked a tough game about its aggressive plans to punish ambushers.  I have seen some ACOG advertisements and press releases that urged the public to support the "good guys," but only one item that named the names of the "bad guys."  That one had to do with a Florida tourism board promotion.   Have I missed something, or is the ACOG taking a softer than threatened stance?  If it were to name names, what would be its risk of catching a defamation lawsuit?<p>

Anything using Olympic(s) was out, as was Atlanta '96, Summer Games, and a host of others. Living in Atlanta, I knew that enforcement was no idle threat. <P>

<P>Along with many others in Atlanta, the Georgia Legislature has been busy
preparing for the Olympics.  Among other things, they: </P>

<P>Passed an Olympic Price-Gouging Act (O.C.G.A. 43-21-16), which restricts
charges at hotels to rates in effect in 1994, plus some cost of living
increases.  The Act does not apply to private homes.  The Georgia Attorney
General has issued an Opinion (No. 95-23) finding that the State Office of
Consumer Affairs has limited authority to enforce the Act.  Private civil
action is also authorized. </P>

<P>Allowed limited exemptions from licensure and certification laws for
"credentialed persons", particularly medical personnel, for the Olympics
and the Paralympics.  O.C.G.A. 43-1-26.  This statute also provides that
the official "Chef de Mission" for the Olympic teams may give consent for
medical and surgical care given to minors on their team. </P>

<P>Authorized the creation of a commemorative license plate, available through
this year.  O.C.G.A. 40-2-46. </P>

<P>Authorized the governor to use volunteer National Guardsmen for logistic
and personnel support to Olympics activities, including public safety and
security assistance to law enforcement.  However, the Guard cannot be used
to quell riots unless a state of emergency is declared.  O.C.G.A. 38-2-6.2.</P>


<P>Extended Workers Compensation coverage to *volunteer* workers at the
Olympics.  O.C.G.A. 34-9-2.4.  This will entitle those workers to medical
care if they are injured "on the job", and protect the "employers" of those
workers.  Income benefits are not provided, since the workers are
volunteers. </P>

<P>Created the Metropolitan Atlanta Olympic Games Authority, which is a
political subdivision of the State of Georgia.  In essence, MAOGA oversees
the construction spending by ACOG.  MAOGA had the authority to issue
revenue bonds; however, its obligations are its own and not backed by the
state or the City of Atlanta.  The Georgia State Financing Commission owns
the Olympic dormitories, which will be turned over to Georgia State
University after the games.  The Centennial Olympic Park is owned by a
private entity. T he Attorney General has also issued an opinion allowing
school systems to lease school buses to ACOG.  No. 95-41. </P>

<P>Showing attention to detail, the legislature also exempted Olympic
competing boats from certain requirements to maintain flotation devices

There is much hand-wringing and cynical thrashing over the commercialization of the Games; however, there are immense costs involved in staging this affair (estimates of $1.3 billion and up for Atlanta).  Is it time for a permanent site to be selected and constructed?<p> 

Where should that site be?  Or should there be more than one?<p>

Subject: Atlanta Wins<p> 

Greg, after the Montreal '76 disaster (I think they lost about 1 billion on the Games) the IOC probably considered this very idea.  Up 'till then, the bulk of the tab for hosting the Olympics was picked up by federal, state, and local governments who looked at the Olympics as a way to showcase their local economy.  Yet, in the end, financial losses for the host city were usually staggering.<p>  

Now, however, I'm not so sure if a permanent site is the way to go.  Financially speaking, everything changed at the 1984 Games in Los Angeles (actually, LA was the only city to bid for the 1984 Games).   Peter Uberroth switched gears and actually made a profit on the Games, by thinking of them as a private enterprise.  Los Angeles' costs were almost entirely paid through corporate sponsors, the sale of broadcast rights and tickets to the games themselves.  They actually made a profit.  Since 1984, Uberroth's "private enterprise" theory has been adopted by each Olympic host and the Games have been revived.<p>  

Will Atlanta lose money on the '96 Games?  Probably not.  NBC paid the ACOG $456 million for the broadcasting rights, and ticket sales have accounted for over $400 million.  Of course, lets not forget those corporate sponsorships.  Atlanta is laying out about $300 million themselves (mostly for public improvements), and Washington is chipping in around $200 million.  Still, after the dust clears, Atlanta will most likely break even, with all the new construction paid for.  The new facilities  (e.g., the stadium, swimming facilities, athletic fields, gymnasiums, housing and parks) will all be given away after the games.  They'll go to local colleges and the city of Atlanta.  Even the Atlanta Braves will get a new home (the Olympic Stadium).<p>   

Not a bad deal.<p>

Todd, I agree that we seem to be "over the hump" on this issue.  After Montreal's disaster and Moscow's US-boycotted games, I believe that Los Angeles was the only bidder for 1984.  Now it seems that at least 3 cities realistically vie for each award.<p>

This one's for Greg and Todd.<p>

Based on the number of cities throughout the world bidding for the 2004 Olympics, and the furor surrounding this matter, it would appear that overall, the Olympics don't prove, in any way, shape or form, to be a bad deal.  Take a look at Rome's application.  The last thing many Romans would like to see is that the eternal city had secured the 2004 Olympic Games.  It's not that Romans are not sports fans, they certainly are, it's just that many of us still recall the months preceding the 1990 Soccer World Cup as being a veritable nightmare, during which the city resembled London in 1940: a city under siege.  Men at work, traffic jams around the clock , organizers of events always running behind  schedule and noise and dust pervading the commoners' daily existence.<p> 

Nonetheless, Mr. Rutelli, the Mayor of Rome, spent several days in Atlanta to lobby the IOC members, as well as to sightsee the Olympic Village and the adjoining stadiums in search of good ideas to take back to Italy.  While Mr. Rutelli was away, however, the spokesman for the Green Party (of which Mr. Rutelli himself is a prominent member) expressed heated criticism at the prospect of Rome hosting the Olympics just 4 years after the 2000 Jubilee, another epic event bound to create dramatic organizational and logistic problems for our capital.  When Mr. Rutelli learned of the above comments, he immediately reassured all and sundry that, if indeed Rome won the bidding and hosts the Olympics in 2004, there will be no negative repercussions for the environment.  Needless to say the Mayor was very disappointed at the stand taken by the Green's spokesman and now many expect the latter to be forced to step down from his post sooner than later.<p> 

The bottom line is that one would never have expected to see the Italian Greens acting as the major sponsors of a mostly business-driven event such as the modern Olympic Games, which amongst other things, will ultimately result in much environmental pollution, tons of fresh cement and tar disseminating throughout the eternal city, in an effort to refurbish the athletic competition venues and the modes of access thereto.  After all, Rome needs not the Olympics to attract tourists and I wonder whether many would  perhaps choose to put off a desired trip to our city purely due to the fact  that the Olympics  were scheduled to take place at that very same time.  There are certain places in this world that many would like to see remain as they have always been, and in the case of our eternal city, as timeless and unchanged as progress, and the years, allow.<p>

<h2>Restraint of Trade</h2>

This question comes from Joseph Galanes, esq., at Kristensen, Cummings
et. al., in Vermont.<p> 

"I am a former member of the '88 Olympic Team (Skiing) and currently an
attorney in Vermont. Query: Has anyone considered whether NGB  Amateur
rules restricting participation of so-called  professionals is an unfair
restraint of trade?  In the ski-world it is usually the case that the
amateur athletes are in fact earning more money than their professional
counterparts."<p>

Subject: NGB Rules Barring Pros Galanes<p> 

Regarding the question of Joseph Galanes, Esq. of Kristenson Cummings
(Vermont), I'm not aware any court decisions or lawsuits brought in the
USA against a NGB due to its rules or policy bar- ring pros from Olympic
competition. My general reaction is that a restraint of trade antitrust
theory (Sherman Act l) would not work because you need two or more
parties. It would probably be difficult to show a NGB contact or
conspiracy with a third party to keep out pros. It is likely that a SGB
would be viewed as a "single entity" for Sherman Act purposes, as
distinguished from pro sports leagues where nearly all recent decisions
have treated them as capable of violating Sherman l because their
respective teams compete with one another. If it could be shown that the
NGB held a monopoly over the sport for Olympic participation purposes(I
presume it could) perhaps a Sherman Act 2 claim of monopolization would
be possible.  In Europe, sports federations have on several occasions
been held to violate antitrust (competition) law based on the counter-
part to Sherman 2 monopolization, abuse of dominant position. This has
occurred under European Community law as well as the national antitrust
laws of European Union("EU") and non-EU countries. I'm not aware of any
antitrust suits or proceedings outside of the  USA involving the
particular issue Mr. Galanes raises.<p>

Subject: What is an Amateur<p> 

This questions has haunted me for the past few months.  I currently
represent the soccer players and the softball players in this year's
Olympics (women).  The soccer women have a strange situation with their
NGB.  Only 12 players are professional athletes (under contract and paid
a monthly salary) and the remaining athletes are paid per diem and/or
under NCAA rules.<p> 

The softball women are associated with the Amateur Softball Association
and their  IF defines amateur as "paid to play" and "receiving any type
of benefits from playing/fame of such sport". Well, according to the
Softball Association (ASA), the softball women have already violated the
definition of Amateur because they have endorsement contracts and
receive some small amount from the ASA.<p> 

So, this brings me to my point: What is an Amateur?  Does each IF have a
working definition that they keep changing to suit their needs?<p> 

To the general public, and Amateur means "an athlete that is not paid to
 play".  But this gets confusing with my soccer players, the softball
players, the dream teams, etc...<p> 

The ancient Olympic Games were strictly amateur...so said the IOC. But,
after great research, author David Young published in his 1984 book "the
Olympic Myth of Greek Amateur Athletes"...was that the Greek athletes
were not.<p> 

Athletes in the ancient Olympics were professions who competed for prize
money.  It was written that the Greek language did not even have a word
for Amateurism.    Now, the IOC puts the definition on the backs of the
individual International Sports Federations (ISF).    The first
professional athletes in the Olympics was the hockey players in
1984....and other IFs have followed.  In fact, the USOC charter removed
the word "amateur" and put in "finest athletes".<p> 

This new movement away from amateur restrictions allows an athlete to
train longer, be better, and dedicate his/her full time to the sport. 
It does take away some of the control the NGB's have over their
athletes.  They are no longer dependent upon thier NGB's fully.  To me,
this is better.  The NGB's seem to have a greater respect  and tend to
work better with the professional athletes...this is my opinion from my
personal experiences.<p> 

The USOC does pay each athlete for a medal won under their Olympic Gold
Award program: 20,000 for gold, $10,000 for silver, and $5,000 for
bronze to each athlete.  Then, each NGB MAY set up a bonus structure
too.  Many do...but not enough.  The NGB's that still maintain the
amateur status can save themselves money by keeping such amateur
definition.  This is not fair!<p> 

It is time for the USOC to take back the control over such a decision. 
With the Dream Team and other professionals playing...it is time to make
every sport equal...and not leave it in the hands of ISF's to
control.<p> 

We will have the best athletes...not the one's that can only afford to
stay in the game.<p>

Subject: Restraint of Trade?<p> 

I agree that a single national governing board ("NGB") may not be
considered to be separate legal entities capable of conspiring for
Sherman Act 1 purposes.   If athletes are required to sign contracts
with the NGB, however, that may be a different story.<p> 

With respect to Sherman Act 2, monopolization, the NGB may be considered
to have monopolized the relevant market for the "sport" over which it
governs.  Moreover, its exclusion of certain athletes may be considered
an unlawful refusal to deal.  But query -- what is the anticompetitive
effect, especially since there is no competitor who has been denied
access to an essential facility? Of course, the cases involving
professional athletes and sports leagues have never articulated a
traditional anticompetitive theory either.<p>

"Thank you Mr. Wise for your response to my "restraint of trade" 
inquiry.  With regard to your point that restraint of trade -  antitrust
- requires third party;  Is it possible to argue that  the international
governing body for skiing, FIS, acted in  conspiracy with the NBG to
prevent professional participation.   Ultimately, it is the FIS that is
in competition with the  professional ski tour.  The FIS sanctions all
premier skiing  events (known as World Cup events), controls the number
of  participants and the amateur qualifications of the participants.  
It seems to me the NGB merely echoes FIS amateur rules in order  to
ensure that its athletes are eligible to compete in the  international
competitions, including the Olympics."<p>

<BR><BR>
If, as you say, the FIS and the U.S. national ski federation (NGB) did
conspire or combine (or contract, if a contract could be shown) to
restrain trade, then, if the requisite anticompetitive effects could be
shown, there may well be a Sherman I claim.  If skiers try to sue not
only NGB but FIS (international federation as well for federal antitrust
violation, they may have significant jurisdictional arguments to
overcome. I assume FIS is located outside of the USA.  See, e.g.,
Karsten Mfg. Corp. v. United States Golf Assn, 728 F. Supp. l429 (D.C.
Ariz. l990). Though not an antitrust case, see also Reynolds v.
International Amateur Athletic Federation, 23 F.3d lll0, l994 WL l86594
(6th Cir. l994), cert. denied, l30 L.Ed.2d 338 (l994). That does not
necessarily mean one could not sue the US NGB alone based on a
conspiracy, combination or contract to restrain trade (Sherman l) or
monopolization (Sherman II). Pls. also note Mr. Levine's comments of
July 29 on the Sherman l issue. Aaron N. Wise Klepner & Cayea, LLP New

<h2>Islamic Women Athletes</h2>

<h3>Seminar Discussion Thread</h3><p> 

Do the Olympic rules in any way address gender discrimination by participating countries that prevent women from competing in women's events?<p> 

Unless I'm mistaken, during the opening ceremonies last Friday, as the Saudi team came into the stadium, I heard the NBC commentator note that in some Muslim countries women were barred from competing in certain sports because the athletic attire required for those events would violate Islamic law.<p> 

I don't know how fundamentalist Muslim women feel about wearing track shorts or bathing suits.  But to the extent they want to compete, are there any international protections for women seeking to freely participate in the Games?<p>

HEADLINE: Bombing Puts U.S. Team in Action<p> 

BY ANN WOOLNER<p>

Associate Editor<p>

AND EMILY HELLER<p>

Staff Reporter<p>

The bomb that exploded at Centennial Olympic Park early Saturday morning sent into action a non-sports team USAa group of prosecutors from the U.S. attorney's office here assigned to work with federal agents in the search for the culprit.<p> 

Formed in August 1995, the team is led by U.S. Attorney Kent B. Alexander. First Assistant U.S. Attorney Janet F. King is the designated team leader. It also includes Senior Litigation Counsel William L. McKinnon Jr. and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Randy S. Chartash, David C. Nutter and Janis Gordon, according to a government description of the team in April.<p> 

The lawyers in the Olympic Critical Incident Team have attended field training exercises and conferences to prepare them for a variety of crises, according to the U.S. attorney's office. They worked alongside the FBI to decide courses of action to be taken in a number of hypothetical terrorist actions, from hostage- taking at Lake Lanier to the release of toxic gas into the subway system, among those was one related to "explosions at an Olympic Venue."<p> 

In what has become a feature of major federal cases, prosecutors join at the investigative stage to try to ensure that evidence and arrests stand up in court. For the prosecutors, the training exercises raised legal questions such as those concerning electronic intercepts and proper searches and seizures.<p> 

The Olympic team of lawyers also attended conferences and briefings on "post-blast incident/crisis response training," terrorism and diplomatic issues, the government says.<p> 

In investigations such as these, prosecutors work hand in glove with investigative agents, according to Henry dePippo, who, as senior trial counsel in the Southern District of New York, helped prosecute the World Trade Center bombers. He is now a white-collar criminal-defense lawyer in Rochester, N.Y.<p> 

Neither Alexander nor Gordon will discuss details, but Alexander says, "We are working around the clock."<p> 

Government lawyers and government agents worked closely together locally in another notorious case when Louis J. Freeh, then associate U.S. attorney from the Southern District of New York, was brought to Atlanta in 1990 to run the multi-state, multi- agency investigation into the mail-bomb deaths of 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Robert S. Vance and Savannah lawyer Robert E. Robinson. That investigation, which had been mired in multi-jurisdictional issues in the months between the mail-bomb deaths and Freeh's appointment, eventually brought the conviction of Walter Leroy Moody Jr. of Rex.<p> 

Freeh now heads the Federal Bureau of Investigation. An assistant U.S. attorney he brought with him from New York to Atlanta to help in the mail- bomb case, Howard M. Shapiro, now works as the FBI's general counsel.<p> 

Moody's lead defender, Edward D. Tolley, says Freeh's experience and success in the Moody case will make the eventual prosecution of the Olympic bomber hard for defense lawyers.<p> 

Freeh "knows bombs better than most folks," says Tolley, a partner at Cook, Noell, Tolley & Wiggins in Athens. And that is "a great challenge for the defense," Tolley says.<p> 

The Moody investigation was "really comprehensive," says Atlanta lawyer Michael R. Hauptman, who represented Moody for a time. "The federal government left no stone unturned," says Hauptman. "I would expect a similar type of thoroughness."<p> 

The Atlanta-based prosecutors report to Justice Department officials normally based in Washington. Deputy Attorney General Jamie S. Gorelick has been overseeing security matters for the Justice Department, according to a spokesman, and is the person to whom Alexander reports.<p> 

The Moody case "probably gives people a good road map" for the investigation and prosecution, says Joe D. Whitley, who became U.S. attorney after the Moody case was under way.<p> 

Whitley, now in private practice at Kilpatrick & Cody, says he would not be surprised if the Justice Department appoints a special prosecutor to head the team.<p> 

Although Atlanta prosecutors are qualified to handle the case and the bomb's apparent lack of sophistication might not call for a specialized prosecutor, Whitley says, control by Washington is possible because of the "heightened degree of attention" given the Olympics- week bombing.<p>

<P>Here's a story from the Daily Report on the obscure lawyer representing the accused Centennial Park bomber. It's amazing how he fell into the case.  </P>

<P>DATE: Aug. 2, 1996</P>

<P>HEADLINE:'I Have Been Hit by Lightning'</P>

<P>DECK:Bomb Case Puts Obscure Lawyer Who Knows Suspect into Limelight  </P>

<P>BY EMILY HELLER, Staff Reporter</P>

<P>G. Watson Bryant Jr., an Atlanta lawyer with a quiet transactional practice, has been thrust into the international limelight by representing Richard Jewell, a suspect in the bombing of Centennial Olympic Park.  </P>

<P>Bryant says he and Jewell met when they worked at the Small Business Administration in the 1980s. Jewell was a clerk in a supply room. Bryant closed loans.  </P>

<P>"Jewell is a friendly, outgoing guy," Bryant says. "We laughed a lot."  </P>

<P>Even though Bryant and his client are famous to watchers of television news shows, Bryant is virtually unknown in the city's legal community.  </P>

<P>It is buzzing with talk of how Bryant, a practitioner with a business law practice, has become part of what could become one of Georgia's most high- profile criminal prosecutions.  </P>

<P>In a telephone interview Thursday, Bryant, who calls himself a private person, seemed equally stunned.  </P>

<P>"I have been hit by lightning," he says. "I cannot believe that odds are I would know someone who would be accused of bombing the park."  </P>

<P>Federal investigators have been trying to determine whether Jewell, a private agency security guard on duty at Centennial Olympic Park, played a role in the July 27 pipe-bomb explosion that killed one woman and injured more than 100.  </P>

<P>On Wednesday the Federal Bureau of Investigation searched Jewell's apartment on Buford Highway and a shed in Habersham County. The search warrant and its affidavits were sealed.  </P>

<P>Having received 500 phone calls in two days, including offers of help, Bryant says, he is assembling a defense team, should Jewell be arrested.  </P>

<P>"I got all kinds of people offering to help that are well- schooled [in criminal-defense law] and I intend to take advantage of it for Richard," Bryant says.  </P>

<P>He refuses to say whom he has contacted, but says he hopes no defense team will be needed. Bryant says he thinks the investigation is moving away from his client.  </P>

<P>"I am only involved in this to try to control the situation until such time,  until I can get a specialist to handle" the case, Bryant says. "I am not pretending to be a criminal trial lawyer. I am smarter than that."  </P>

<P>Bryant says he was appointed defense counsel in some Fulton County cases but does not recall how many or what kind of cases.  </P>

<P>Jewell does not have the financial resources to "retain some hotshot right now," Bryant says.  </P>

<P>Bryant says he has not represented Jewell in any previous legal matters, either criminal or civil.  </P>

<P>"Richard doesn't have any property that's even worthy of a will," Bryant says.  </P>

<P>Meanwhile, however, Bryant is furious at investigators' "leaking" of information about the case to the news media and says Jewell might bring a suit.  </P>

<P>"I'd sure like to know who the hell it is that's talking to the newspaper," Bryant says. "It's not a three-ring circus. It's a 100-ring circus. It's ridiculous.  </P>

<P>"We want them to be accountable for their misbehavior," Bryant says, speaking of investigators who he says divulged information improperly. "There are laws and regulations and guidelines that prohibit this. I think it's probably a criminal act to disclose information from an ongoing criminal investigation."  </P>

<P>He expresses frustration about getting no information from the FBI. He says he does not know what evidence the government used to get search warrants, because the documents are under seal.  </P>

<P>"What the hell is probable cause for busting up Jewell?" Bryant says.  </P>

<P>He said the FBI told him the search would take an hour or two, but it took 10. "To take 10 hours to search a two-bedroom apartment seems to be a little bit excessive," he says. "I don't mean a little bit. I mean a lot."  </P>

<P>He also took umbrage at the large number of investigators in "color-coded" shirts conducting the searches: "It's like I'm walking around Six Flags or something."  </P>

<P>And he fumes about the FBI's towing Jewell's truck to Washington or New York to be picked over while Jewell is still making payments on it. "I think they've legally stolen it," he says.  </P>

<P>FBI spokesman Jay Spadafore declines to comment.  </P>

<P>'A Lot of Good Clients'</P>

<P>Bryant, a 45-year-old 1977 University of South Carolina law graduate, will not say who his clients are and defines his practice only as transactional.  </P>

<P>After graduating from law school in 1977, Bryant went to work for the Small Business Administration, where he closed disaster loans. </P>


<P>He launched a private practice but had no luck obtaining clients.  </P>

<P>Bryant next worked as a prosecutor in Atlanta Municipal Court for 18 months, then returned to private practice at Freeman & Hawkins for one year.  </P>

<P>He went back out on his own and by then had obtained a master's degree in tax law at Emory University. Still unsuccessful at developing a client base, he returned to the SBA in 1982 and stayed five years.  </P>

<P>After his second stint at the SBA, during which Bryant met Jewell, Bryant returned in 1987 to a private practice, as an associate at the former Schwall, Ruff & Goodman, a small, general civil practice firm.  </P>

<P>He worked there for about two years in the late 1980s, doing mostly SBA loan closings, recalls Emory A. Schwall, whose Atlanta firm is now called Schwall & Schwall.  </P>

<P>Bryant "wasn't much into trial work," Schwall says.  </P>

<P>Bryant left voluntarily, Schwall says, to work solo from an office his father owned, then becoming of counsel to Fishman & Heaton, which ultimately dissolved.  </P>

<P>He has worked from second-floor office space in Nickolas P. Chilivis' Buckhead building the past four or five.  </P>

<P>Chilivis, a prominent trial lawyer, says he sees Bryant coming and going, using the library and meeting with clients in the conference rooms.  </P>

<P>"I do know he is a competent lawyer," says Chilivis. "He seems to be a busy lawyer with a lot of good clients. A lot of them look distinguished and prominent." But Chilivis says he does not know who they are.  </P>

<P>"I never have asked him what kind of cases" Bryant takes, he says. </P>


<P>Sued over SBA Loan</P>

<P>Court records provide a few details of Bryant's practice.  </P>

<P>His work at the Schwall firm was the subject of a suit by a former client, ITT Small Business Finance Corp.  </P>

<P>Bryant closed a $720,000 SBA- backed loan to Club Rio on Luckie Street in downtown Atlanta. SBA paid its $640,000 guarantee when the club was liquidated in bankruptcy. However, the SBA found tax liens of $113,000.  </P>

<P>The existence of the liens violated an agency rule against backing loans for borrowers who owe back taxes. When the SBA threatened to sue ITT and suspend it from lending nationwide, ITT refunded the money.  </P>

<P>ITT then turned to Bryant, who it argued concealed the liens from the lender at closing, thus committing fraud and malpractice.  </P>

<P>Bryant said he had disclosed the liens to an ITT loan officer and inquired how the matter should be handled.  </P>

<P>At the time, Bryant said 80 percent of his practice related to loan closings, a stream of business he intended to maintain (Daily Report, July 12, 1994).  </P>

<P>But the case was bad for business. In 1992, Bryant entered a consent order, not admitting guilt, that suspended him from government practice.  </P>

<P>Bryant won summary judgment on the fraud claim in 1994. He said at the time he was "backstabbed" by ITT and vowed he would not settle.  </P>

<P>Bryant has participated in some civil litigation, records in federal District Court show.  </P>

<P>He represented a co-owner of seven Little Caesar pizza franchises in the Atlanta area. The plaintiffs, a father and son and their company, sued Little Caesar to rescind franchise contracts, claiming the company defrauded them by inflating sales figures for stores, six of which were company-owned.  </P>

<P>Although Bryant represented a plaintiff, lead counsel in the case was John P. MacNaughton of Morris, Manning & Martin.  </P>

<P>After a bench trial, Judge Willis B. Hunt Jr. found for Little Caesar in the amount of $219,326, ruling that some Little Caesar's figures were unintentionally erroneous but that the plaintiffs' accountants could have discovered the miscalculations. The matter is on appeal.  </P>

<P>Neither MacNaughton nor his co- counsel, Frank W. DeBorde, could be reached for comment.  </P>

<P>Criminal-defense attorneys, buzzing about the case, say they have never heard of Bryant and express curiosity about the legal counsel Jewell is receiving.  </P>

<P>"Who the hell is Watson Bryant?" quips Atlanta attorney Donald F. Samuel, past president of the Georgia Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. Samuel was co- counsel in the notorious mail- bomb case of Walter Leroy Moody Jr., the Rex man convicted of murdering a federal appeals court judge and a Savannah lawyer.  </P>

<P>GACDL President Aimee R. Maxwell says she does not know Bryant and hopes he is consulting with a defender.  </P>

<P>"What is happening at this stage is going to be critical to the case if they actually can make a case against" Jewell, she says.  </P>

<P>Told of Bryant's background in loan closings and commercial transactions, the defense lawyer says pointedly, "I would never walk into a closing without a specialist in real estate."  r  </P>

Who is Bryant indeed.  What unbridled arrogance.  Bryant appears to be a guy who has survived in a tough market, knows how to try a law suit, and is representing Jewell.  I have successfully defended numerous people accused of crime and have yet to discover any mystical, unattainable quality required in a defense attorney. Hard work, knowledge of the rules of evidence, and a touch of panache are all thatis required.  Bryant will do just fine.

<BR><BR>
I cannot believe that this article was published by the Daily Report. I find it to be an incredible violation of Mr. Bryant's privacy.  What relevance or interest does his conflict with ITT bear to his representation of Jewell.  This, in my opinion, represents the worst kind of journalism.

"I cannot believe that this article was published by the Daily Report" 
<BR><BR>
While I agree that the Daily Report's article could be considered an unnecessary invasion, but to a certain extent, Mr. Bryant, IMHO, asked for it by appearing on every talk show, etc. that would have him, including Today, CNN and Larry King. Once you seek your 15 minutes of fame, you're like the dog who catches the bus., you get it and don't realize how difficult it is to control it. On that subject, I guess I'm from the old school where attorneys tried their cases in court, not on TV (or perhaps in my case, the radio <G>). I realize it's not necessarily unethical but why do it?

Is NBC's coverage of the Olympics--rebroadcasting previously taped
events as if they were live, without an indication that the event was
held earlier in the day, dishonest?<p> 

One broadcast of a woman's bicycle race was particularly annoying. John
Tesh was describing the event in the present tense, but it was clear the
event had been held earlier in the day. That's because during the bike
race it was raining, and the rain had stopped by the evening broadcast.
In fact, just before it showed the bike race, it showed a sunny crowd in
the bleachers of the swimming stadium. The whole think looked rather
sloppy.<p> 

NBC says people don't really care, they are watching the events for
entertainment, not for news. As a viewer, I want to know whether what I
am watching is live or taped. How about you?<p>

Yes, I agree with you!   I am insulted that NBC thinks I am an idiot
sitting in my easy chair watching TV at 9pm and believing that it is
sunny in Atlanta as I watch beach volleyball.  What I would like to know
is---when was this game?  Yesterday, today?  It is ridiculous.  Besides
the fact that NBC does it for entertainment purposes, I think that NBC
thinks if we knew the truth (and probably the outcome), then we wouldn't
watch it!!!<p> 

Since when was following the Olympics only learning the results of
events?  I want to see the action, the heartbreak, the elation involved
with the whole event...and the truth.  Moreover, I want to see the truth
even if it is boring to TV producers.  And I feel manipulated by NBC.<p>


I feel like I am watching "Hard Copy" (or shall we say, "Entertainment
Tonight"?), not the greatest sports event in the world.<p>

NBC reportedly did lots of focus groups and found that people didn't
care if they were seeing the events live. And there is a lot of need for
taped coverage in an event like the Olympics, where several competitions
are going on in different locations at one time, and some events (such
as gymnastics) have several things going on at once. You couldn't
possibly cover all that satisfactorily in real time.<p> 

In concluding that people also didn't care about being misled about it,
however, I think that NBC made a mistake.<p>

I know it's not live, but I certainly don't want to know the results.  I
tune into the games for more than the scores, but it definitely ruins it
for me to know the outcome.  Last night I made sure to avoid finding out
who won the all-around.  Part of the excitement of watching sports is
not knowing what will happen & the highs & lows as your team's fortunes
change.  The fact that the event is not taking place simultaneously is
not that relevant.<p> 

BTW, how do you expect NBC to televise all of these events, from who
knows how many venues, live.  This is not a football game they're
putting on.  With the notable exception of some announcers (although
Tesh is so sappy he's fun to watch), I think NBC has done a good job. 
Bob Costas has been great (as usual).<p>

I never said the coverage of all of the events should be live. I said
NBC should be up front about whether an event happened earlier in the
day or is happening during prime time, as I am watching it. Personally,
I don't mind knowing the results before seeing the event. I may learn
that Carl Lewis won his fourth gold medal in the long jump and still
tune in later to watch how he did it.<p>

Subject: Live - Prerecorded<p> 

On the West  Coast, it is commonplace to see "live" events like the
Oscars or the Emmys tape delayed (even when the event occurs in the same
time zone).  Almost always these shows have an announcement at the start
of, and a caption during, the program alerting viewers to the fact that
the show was "prerecorded for rebroadcast in this time zone."   Yet
people in California still manage to participate in the excitement of
seeing a winner being announced despite the fact that it actually
happened three hours earlier.  So, I can't imagine that NBC would be
doing itself much harm if it advised its viewers that the events took
place earlier in the day.<p> 

But the missing caption is only part of the deceit that NBC appears to
be engaging in and it is not, in my opinion, the worst. It is my
understanding that in addition to the events not being broadcast live,
much of the "running" commentary, at least in gymnastics, has been
dubbed in after the event in an effort to heighten the drama.  So when
John Tesh says in an ominous tone, "he needs a 9.878 to stay in the
medal hunt," Tesh and the rest of the NBC team already know whether that
score was achieved.  Thus, NBC is actually manipulating how those events
are perceived by the viewing audience.  This, to me, is a far worse
insult to the intelligence of the viewers than the mere omission of an
announcement as to whether or not the event is being broadcast live.<p>

Does anyone know for a fact whether Tesh's commentary was a
voice-over?<p> 

I know that Al Trautwig's reports on the cycling and mountain biking
events were -- they were cut and edited and turned more into a story
than a traditional sports broadcast (and, by the way, I thought they
were GREAT. A nice change of pace, making an otherwise lengthy and
potentially tedious event into something really exciting)<p> 

Anyone know for sure what is voiced-over and what is not?<p> 

And, yes, I think that NBC would be doing everyone a great service if it
just put a "LIVE-NBC" in the upper corner when an event IS live.<p>

Please advise the NBC that the Italian viewers have also, by now,
realized that the NBC is playing strange games with respect to the
"live" coverage of the Olympic Games.  The most well read Italian sports
paper today displayed an entire column, criticizing the way the NBC
purports to be broadcasting certain events as though they were live
which, instead, took place hours earlier.  In particular, the anchorman
Bob Costas was noted as promising an update on Kerri Strug's injury
"within the next thirty minutes" (as if the event had just taken place),
ignoring the fact that the issue had already been covered by CNN.<p>

I attended the Women's Individual All-Around Gymnastics Finals, and I was sitting directly across from the area in which John Tesh was seated.  Periodically,  we watched him through the binoculars, and it did not appear that he was commentating.  We concluded that he would add his commentary later.  I have not yet viewed my tape of the event, so I don't really know how it was broadcast. 
<BR><BR>
Having now seen the event live, however, I must admit that I do not see an evil in the later dubbing.  When you watch it on TV, you're aware that performances on more than one apparatus are going on at once, but you can't realize how completely impossible it is to follow each and every apparatus for each and every competitor.  Sometimes, all four performances are going on simultaneously; at other times, none.  Frankly, I don't know how they would be able to do it otherwise.  Moreover,  while attending that event was utterly thrilling, the one thing we missed was the commentary letting us know who was in contention and how many points they needed.  The voice-over  pulls it all together, adds drama and maintains the focus.  I'm in favor of doing it in whatever manner it takes to do it well.

I can understand doing voice-overs and dubbing in commentary for an event like gymnastics where many athletes are competing simultaneously.  What I think is dishonest is when NBC would show events that clearly have taken place hours previously without stating that they occurred much earlier. 
<BR><BR>
I also noticed that NBC dragged out its coverage of gymnastics, swimming, and track so that, even though these events were taking place during prime time, the NBC coverage of the events didn't end until several hours after the actual event had concluded.  As I mentioned in another thread, I had my choice in coverage between NBC and CBC (from Windsor).  CBC had to be off the air by 11 PM,  and it almost always managed to get its coverage of all the important events concluded by that time.  The fact that NBC used tape in presenting such "live" events was what I really objected to.  They should at least have had a graphic on the screen delineating the taped events from the live ones, in order to avoid misleading the public (but they probably chose not to because that would tip off people to how much videotape they were actually using).

I also found all of the time-shifting interesting because, as I recall, one reason why the Atlanta games generated huge TV money interest was the fact that it was in the US Eastern time zone and thus most sports could be shown live.

<h2>Arbitration Confidentiality</h2>

<h3>Seminar Discussion Thread</h3><p>

Last Append: Mon Jul 29 10:00:53 1996<p>

Many binding arbitrations related to these Olympic Games have been held
already, yet the world is unaware.  The reason is the confidentiality
that historically has been one of the essential features of the
arbitration process.<p>

The athletes were required, at a very late stage in their years of
preparation for these Games, to commit as a condition precedent to their
participation in these Games that all disputes would be decided through
confidential binding arbitration.  This required commitment took such
disputes out of the courts and enshrouded them in a cloak of secrecy.<p>

The Olympic Games are a public event, witnessed worldwide by upwards of
4 billion people.  While it is athletes who compete, they do so under
the flags of and as representatives for their countries, there being 197
nations represented in these Games in Atlanta.  We here are a free and
open society, and our courts provide equal and full access to all, and
in a public forum.<p>

Binding arbitration, IMHO, is by far the preferred method of dispute
resolution in the Olympic Games.  But being that the public is
integrally involved, that the disputants are representatives of the
various nations of the world who are responsible for their being here
and who must live with the glory and tragedy of their results in the
competition, there exists a valid argument that the dispute resolution
process should in these circumstances be open to public view, just as
the competitions themselves are open to public view.  And, accordingly,
that the athletes and the countries whom they represent have given up
too valuable a right in being required to waive a public forum for their
disputes, a right that we in this democracy have honored for 200 years
as integral not only to justice for the individual, but also to the
stability of the country itself.<p>

Would you agree with this argument that Olympics arbitrations should be
open instead of closed?<p>

Inasmuch as arbitration is an alternative dispute resolution process, it
seems appropriate that something less than open proceedings should be
utilized.  However, it also seems reasonable that the results should be
made public.<p>

Atlanta<br> Date: Mon Jul 29 10:00:53 1996<br> Subject: Arbitrator's
Perspective<p>

I'd like to add another perspective to the foregoing discussion:  the
nature of arbitration, and especially its confidentiality, prevents the
construction of a body of precedent that can guide both the public (here
Olympic athletes, coaches, etc.) in its behavior and also we future
arbitrators who are faced with identical, or at least similar, issues. 
This is a large issue in the philosophical debate that goes on regarding
the benefits of arbitration vis-à-vis litigation, and oftentimes the
particular benefits of arbitration override society's need for
precedent.<p>

Here in the Olympics, however, a worldwide public spectacle wherein 197
countries compete for honor and glory in a large number of events and in
a very compressed time frame of but 17 days, with all of the myriad of
disputes being resolved by private, confidential, binding arbitration,
the issue of achieving guidance for the arbitrators, in the interest at
least of consistency of result, takes on added weight.  There are those
who contend that the cloak of secrecy ought to be raised, if only for
the arbitrator panels that have been set up to hear the disputes on a
fast-track basis.  They argue that this morning's arbitrator panel ought
to be aware of how last night's arbitrator panel decided an almost
identical issue, and, for example, what penalty was exacted for a
similar Code of Conduct violation.  Those who argue to the contrary
respond that arbitration by nature is private and confidential,
important elements in making it expeditious and final.  They argue that
to allow chinks in the armor of arbitration confidentiality is to risk
waiving the cloak of secrecy entirely, thereby removing a key benefit of
arbitration and risking further that the matter will end up being tried
in the courts and in the media, making an Olympics as we know it totally
unworkable.  Inconsistency of arbitration result, they posit, is part of
the price that must be paid for the overall good accomplished by the
holding of an Olympics.<p>

Should the Olympics arbitrators have a "right to know" the details of
previous Olympics arbitrations as a guide in the performance of their
duties and in the interest of consistency of result?  Or would this
damage unacceptably the benefits brought by arbitration to the Olympic
Games?<p>

The agreement to arbitrate is enforceable on its terms.  If the athlete
agrees to compete subject to the arbitration provision, that provision
should be enforceable unless the athlete can prove overreaching, etc. 
The above posts raise the interesting question of the rights of third
parties to arbitration information.  How would someone do it?  Argue
public policy?  I'm aware of no policy requiring disclosure of
information relating to a private dispute.<p>

<P>However....isn't that sort of a contract of adhesion? and when we are speaking of the olympics ( with all sort of federal breaks for the olympic committee and so forth) doesn't the public have some interest in knowign what is going on? </P>

<h2>Atlanta -- The Wrong Choice?</h2>

<h3>Seminar Discussion Thread</h3><p> 

Last Append: Tue July 30 14:37:14 1996<BR><BR>

Did the IOC make a mistake in handing the Summer Games over to Atlanta?<p> 

The international community seems to think so.  An article in today's New York Times reports that international delegations are furious over the way Atlanta has hosted the Games.  A few examples: A Georgian weight lifter missed an event because a bus driver did not know his route.  A German swimmer appeared on the scoreboard as a citizen of Ghana.  A kayaker from Antigua was injured when a shuttle bus hit a concrete barrier.  A Ugandan boxer was listed as more than 19 feet tall.  The Italians have complained that their team has nowhere to boil water for a decent pot of pasta.  The list goes on and on (remember the lights going out on the Dream Team?).  The President of the ACOG admits that there have been problems, primarily with transportation and the IBM results system, but still professes that these would be the "greatest games ever."<p>   

Has Atlanta blown it?  One can argue that Atlanta is doing quite well, considering the scope and production of the Summer Games.  Perhaps a larger questions here is whether or not turning the games over to American private enterprise has resulted in a far too big of a production, causing Atlanta to crack at the seams.<p>

I just returned from the Summer Games.  I think the transportation glitches have been blown way out of proportion.  Sure MARTA is crowed, but so is DC's Metro.  Don't condemn the entire operation for one or two mishaps.  By and large, the crowds are hot but happy.  Southern hospitality at its best.<p>

Not only are there transportation glitches, but the Atlanta Games are not turning out to be as great as some people thought-especially some of the vendors and storeowners who were promised a big boom in their businesses.  For example, some of the stores around Savannah are extremely upset at the lack of business (isn't that where some of the water events are being held?) and some of the vendors in Centennial Park have actually packed up and gone home!<p>  

Were these people falsely misled to believe an increase in business by ACOG?  Is business so bad because of logistics?  Or bad luck?  Were the merchants privy to any of the plans for their area so that they could make an educated decision about their businesses?  I can see that if they were misled regarding logistical or geographical plans, then they have a reason to complain.  But it is probably just bad luck and I feel sorry for the unfulfilled expectations.<p> 

I know business is sometimes harsh and luck is fickle, but these storeowners and vendors are ANGRY.  Can anything be done and whose fault, if there is any, is it?<p>

Nobody was "promised" anything.  Your post indicates that you have no idea what you are talking about.  First, Savannah is host to yachting only (not exactly a big crowd pleaser, but well attended just the same).  There was never  any expected "boom" to Savannah. Moreover, there are no "vendors" in Centennial Park that are also not sponsors, and, of course, none of those have left.  The "vendors" that you speak of  were licensed by the city, not ACOG, and if they have had no business, so be it.  In business, you pay your money and you take your chances, and these "vendors" lost out.  Too bad.  They were an eyesore to begin with (coming under criticism from the IOC for ruining the ambiance of the Games, a sentiment that I share).  Good riddance to them.  They made their choices about locations they wished to lease and they did not pay off.

I realize that this discussion was initiated before last night's tragic bombing.  I also recognize that Todd probably does not know how idiotic he now sounds.    Perhaps some of you believe that the critical story here is the logistical functioning of the Games.  In that regard, there is no doubt that the bussing of the media was flawed in the initial days of the Games, and that IBM has completely screwed up the event-result system devised for the games.   By the same token, there is also no question that the foreign journalists have been eager to find any fault they could in these Games and that the snobbish New York and Los Angeles media have been readily manipulated to verify "problems" in these Games. It is perhaps most revealing that New York City has (only now) launched a major effort to obtain the Games at a future date. I hope New York is successful.  I also hope the city is successful in preventing every "crazy" from invading any public area and endangering the public.  I hope that the city can also conduct the Games without making people feel the fear that I suspect will now be inevitable.  Most of all, I hope that the rest of this great nation will rally around New York City, at that time, to help in such an endeavor. In the meantime, I am going to be at every event in Atlanta I can.  I hope, although I doubt, that everyone in this country -- unlike Todd -- can support me in that effort!

I realize that the question mark at the end of Todd's subject line doesn't show up til you open the thread, but please remember that it's there. It's legitimate to ask whether Atlanta was the wrong choice, in the context of the criticism being heaped on the city last week.<p> 

Asking the question doesn't equal taking the position, and that's not what Todd intended to do.<p> 

And for the record (admitting my bias as a native Atlantan), I think Atlanta was a great choice. I keep hearing the same incidents brought up when journalists talk about problems with transportation and technology; percentage-wise, these seem to be very small fractions of the overall operation.<p> 

The bombing is an entirely different question of course, having taken place in a public park, not an Olympic venue.

It's understandable that nerves would be frayed in Atlanta, but I don't agree that  Todd (or Maria or anyone else) sounds "idiotic." Todd correctly noted that an unflattering article had appeared in the New York Times.  Similar articles have appeared in the Indianapolis Star, on national news programs, and everywhere else in the nation.  (Like Maria, I have also heard news reports that at least some Atlanta business people have been disappointed that a hoped-for Olympic boom had not occurred.)  Todd noted that "[o]ne could argue that Atlanta is doing quite well, considering the scope and production of the Summer Games."  Todd then raised for our discussion the very questions that are being posed by every media outlet in the world.<p> 

I have no idea what the truth is.  But I think those who disagree with the media coverage would serve themselves better if they would spread more enlightenment  and cast fewer insults.  I am always skeptical of media coverage and would certainly appreciate hearing another side of the story.  But I am hardly persuaded to discount media reports by demands that we all just "shut up."

Though no excuse for the unnecessary hyperbole, nerves ARE frayed here!  (My office was evacuated for a bomb threat several hours ago).  Many of the points raised in the press are valid; there is no question that the shuttle transportation planning was inadequate and that IBM's computer system has been a dismal failure!  There is also no question that neither problem should have occurred.  On the other hand, those lapses -- which emanated from the organizing committee and IBM -- have little or nothing to do with how the city of Atlanta is doing.  Until early Saturday morning, the city itself was doing wonderfully.  Public transportation was working well (despite isolated reports to the contrary), people actually attending the games were having a wonderful time, and the streets have been one orderly and spirited party.  As numerous posts throughout CC suggest, the picture portrayed in the press is inconsistent with the experiences of the people in attendance.<p> 

I apologize for the tone and hyperbole, but not for the point.  The story of these games is NOT how the city of Atlanta is doing, or even how the organizing committee is doing.  Instead, the real story -- until Saturday a.m. -- has been the joyful Olympic experience in this city.  Now, however, the story is also of the terror wreaked by a madman.<p>

Richard's gracious post causes me to chime in on his side.  (Who wants to pick on an Atlanta lawyer who's just been chased out of his office by a bomb scare?  Not me.)  His account seems consistent with all the interviews of spectators and participants that I've seen/heard.  For what it's worth, I don't credit the armchair quarterbacking going on in the media about security.  Based on everything I've heard, it sounds like security was extraordinary.  I don't see how the organizers could be expected to seal off every public space in Atlanta.  As long as we live in a free society, we will be vulnerable to the despicable psychos who do this.  I hope we do not overreact to the terrible tragedies of the Centennial Park bombing and the TWA disaster.

Subject: Atlanta as the choice<p> 

Let us please save for another day any discussion of whether the terrorist bomb blast at Centennial Olympic Park necessarily makes Atlanta a poor choice for the Games. In the last year, I have been fortunate enough to be able to get to Jerusalem, Paris, New York and Los Angeles. Terrorism was felt in each of those cities even WHILE I was there. The fact that the Games are in Atlanta or Athens or Madrid or Detroit or Lake Placid does not necessarily make terrorism more or less likely there. Let us please remain sensitive to this tragedy and hold this delicate discussion until after the Games. Perhaps we can bring it up in the Sports Law forum after the Games are through and the evidence as to who and why this was done is released.<p> 

As for whether Atlanta was a poor choice to begin with, I think that it is natural to second guess the IOC and ask if Atlanta was the proper choice for the Games. But let us not lose sight of the fact that this is the sort of thing that we do EVERY Olympics.<p> 

Was Norway really the best choice for the Winter Games a few years ago considering that the snow and weather made travel to venues extremely difficult? Was Los Angeles the proper choice in '84 considering the heat, air quality and traffic?<p> 

Questions will always be asked of the choice of the Games site. It is not a personal attack on Atlanta and should not be taken that way. Atlanta and all of the south throughout Georgia and Florida have been very gracious and have generally run the Games well. Have there been computer glitches? Of course. Will there be more in the next week? Certainly. But it appears that there have been no more than in past Summer Games (remember that there are many more athletes in the Summer rather than Winter Games). Perhaps they are just more publicized.<p> 

Any other comments from anyone who has had the chance to attend any of the Games?<p>

Subject: Several Thoughts<p> 

Upon my return to Charlotte from a weekend at the games:<p> 

--This is a *huge* undertaking.  I can think of nothing comparable.  No one city has the resources to take this on alone.  Evidence of this included police barriers borrowed from New Orleans, and buses (and, I believe, drivers) borrowed from as far away as Long Beach, CA.  It is impossible to believe that all of the logistics involved could be handled flawlessly.  All appearances were that ACOG is doing about as well as anyone could reasonable expect.<p> 

--Atlantans are showing their legendary Southern hospitality.  Without exception, the volunteers, staffers and locals were friendly, helpful and knowledgeable.<p> 

--There can always be more security, but a certain amount of risk is inevitable.  Centennial Park is surrounded by public streets and parking areas which are filled with vendors and crowds.  If the bomber had not been able to enter the Park, he could have left the bomb in the House of Blues across the street.  My party parked in the Underground Atlanta garage on Saturday afternoon.  When we returned, we could not get to our vehicle.  The garage was closed because of a suspicious package at a retail store in Underground Atlanta.  It was a false alarm, but an example of how any downtown is vulnerable.<p> 

--The Turks who sadly lost one of their comrades to a heart attack complained that Atlanta was "too small" to host the games.  Isn't security more difficult in a situation like that at Los Angeles, where sites were sprawled over the region?<p> 

--Atlanta is getting a bad break, largely from our own (as noted earlier, NY and LA-based) media.  Surely past Olympics were not snag-free.  I have heard from someone who was involved in the Barcelona Olympics that their homeless were warehoused out of sight during the 1992 games.  Did Seoul have the "cultural sophistication" so missed by those who attended at Barcelona?<p>

Thanks, Ted.<p>

I was in Centennial Olympic Park the Saturday before last, Tuesday, Thursday and even Friday night at 11:30 p.m.  I've attended volleyball at the Omni and Basketball at the Dome, both next to the park.  My wife went to tennis at Stone Mountain, east of the city.<p>  

Samaranch reported yesterday that these are the most visited games by spectators and participants ever.   I've seen 31,000 (sellout) pack the half house Dome without a glitch.     80,000 saw track and field yesterday at Olympic stadium.  A friend reported a sellout and enthusiastic crowd at Lake Lanier yesterday for rowing.<p>   

I've driven downtown and parked for 5 dollars- no traffic getting down there at 9:00 a.m. No problem parking 5 blocks from the park. I've also taken the MARTA rail system during the peak time of 4:30 p.m. from the north line to Peachtree Center.  Sure it was as packed as physically possible, but still no one seemed annoyed from my vantage.<p> 

With each trip to the park, I saw increasingly large crowds. Not elbow to elbow, but still not suitable for say a baby carriage.   Everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves.<p>   

My wife tells me that the bathrooms at the tennis venue stopped working so they brought in port-o-potties.  Until 1:25 a.m. Saturday morning this is was the worst inconvenience I heard form anyone I talked with about how the games were going.<p> 

I recall that in Barcelona, you couldn't find a restroom and they had less people.<p> 

The biggest complaints I've heard are from local festivals and merchants saying that business is slow.  Seems no one did a good demographic study of who was coming.<p>   

My Man On the Street (and in the park) impression is visitors are mostly either young people in their 20s from around the globe or upper middle class families from the US.  The latter group are either only staying long enough to go to the events for which they have tickets and otherwise staying close to their hotel, or they are in town for an extended vacation and staying with friends or family.  Neither group has the interest to come to town to shop for anything other than Olympic stuff, let alone get in a car and drive to my or any other suburb (Roswell) for a festival.  The action is downtown.<p> 

I'll be at volleyball tomorrow.  They are re-opening the park for the first time at 9:30 a.m., though I haven't decided if I will go there.  That I have to even think twice is incredibly depressing.<p>

Subject: Whitewater!<p> 

Yes, Ted, but the waters weren't smooth there -- everything else was!  The Ocoee River event is the first time that whitewater slalom kayaking and canoeing competitions have been held on a natural river in the Olympics, and it is magnificent.  The athletes are praising it as the best that they have ever seen in competition anywhere.  And the crowds are loving it.<p> 

We drove to one of the many designated and widely separated parking lots, meeting no congestion whatsoever.  We stepped out of the car and immediately onto one of many buses, and it left right away, and quickly deposited us by the banks of the Ocoee.  The trip was much quicker and easier than ones I have taken previously for whitewater rafting on the Ocoee.  There were many lanes for the spectators, which resulted in short, quickly moving lines.  Security was evident everywhere (I even later found it on top of a dam 2 lakes upstream!).  Bags were politely and efficiently searched (and this was the day *before* the bombing).  The facilities were excellent:  more Port-A-Lets than you could shake a stick at, many vendors doing a bang-up business, bluegrass bands playing every 50 feet on the way in, "snowflake camouflage" strung over all of the public areas to keep out the direct sunlight, and bleachers right on the river bank with an absolutely perfect view of all of the action right down in front of you on the river.  It was a rip-roaring good time, including interaction between the competitors and what was reported to be the largest crowd ever to see a whitewater event in the world!  There were two public address announcers who obviously were former whitewater competitors, and their comments during the runs were excellent and guided us very well in our knowledge and appreciation of the sport and in what the competitors were facing, the strategies they were taking for the various course obstacles, and the degrees of success that they were achieving with each obstacle.<p>   

I admit that the bleachers got a little hard after almost 6 hours, so we left early wondering if we could find a bus to take us back to our parking lot.  There they were!  A quick hop on, a prompt departure, singing in various languages on the way back and much laughing, and we were dropped off right at our car, with the drive out being a breeze.<p> 

Now I ask you, what more could you have asked for?  It was a great experience, made so by an expert and most user-friendly organization and operation.  It was so smooooth!<p>

I've attended a number of events and have been very impressed with the logistics of moving huge numbers of people.  This is an incredible story which seems to be missed by much of the media but appreciated more and more by the people attending the games.<p> 


Moreover, as a Minister at a large Atlanta church, I've had a great deal of contact with visitors from around the world.  Their impressions have been most favorable, and this has been most apparent in those who have attending Olympics games in other cities.   This is a tremendous event which has not been error free but overall has been remarkable.  Sorry, got to get to another event!<p>

that, in the list of "problems" at the head of the list, only one of them was both related to organization of the events *and* amounted to anything of consequence -- that is the weight lifter who missed his event because a bus driver did not know his route.  Assuming the weight lifter didn't contribute to the problem by trying to arrive at the event only three minutes before his deadline for checking in, that really is unfortunate.<p> 

The case of kayaker who was injured in an accident is also very unfortunate, but I don't know why that should reflect on the organizers of the Games.  Some accidents are going to happen when you get so many people together in one city to participate in so many events.<p> 

But as for the other problems listed -- if a German diver appears on a scoreboard as a diver from Ghana, or a boxer is listed as 19 feet tall -- so what?  The Italians can't find a place to cook their own food?  Well, excuse me!  If they are staying in an athletes' dormitory, they're not supposed to be cooking in their rooms -- and if cooking their own food was important to them, they should have made other living arrangements.  As far as I'm concerned, that "problem" is not a problem.<p> 

I think the people who are reporting these "problems" really have to be stretching to make a point if these are the best evidence of inadequate preparation or planning on the part of the organizers or the city of Atlanta.<p> 

I spent many years living in foreign countries where nobody would even think of complaining about little glitches like these.  Anybody who thinks that it is possible to organize something as big as this and have it run without a single misstep is out of touch with reality.  I think the Games are going along very well.<p>

Subject: Atlanta -- The Wrong Choice?<p> 

I just returned from the games yesterday and join in the chorus of attendees praising the games and their organization and operation. Have you noticed that the praise has been coming primarily from those who were there and the criticism principally from those who were not?  The media deserves the criticism, not the games.  Minor problems are to be expected when anything of this enormity is planned and executed--and minor problems are all that there have been.  Without the media digging up (creating?) the complaints, there would be few, indeed.  My husband "scolded" a TV camera crew riding a (very crowded, but nonetheless good humored and cooperative) train for their negative coverage.  They demonstrated a complete indifference  to his comments.<p> 
 
The joyous and wondrous atmosphere of the games pervades everything and serves to overcome the small inconveniences that arise.  The international camaraderie that is ever present makes the bombing an even greater tragedy--before the bombing, it didn't seem as if anything could dampen the spirits of those attending.  And notwithstanding the bombing--how can you stop someone hell-bent on destruction--the security was terrific.  We actually witnessed a purse-snatching, in which the perpetrator was immediately caught in a foot chase by 7-8 policemen, and a bag being searched a few minutes after it was left unattended in Olympic stadium by its owner, both before the bombing and the even tighter security.  Applause to the security forces and their organizers!<p> 
 
Hooray to Atlanta and to ACOG for a job well done and an experience those of us who were fortunate enough to share will never forget.<p>

My eight year old daughter and I just returned this afternoon from four days in Atlanta.  We attended events; we wandered the streets during the day and at 1 and 2 in the morning after the gymnastics events ended; we shopped; we picnicked; we rode Marta; we drove downtown; we spent yesterday in the newly reopened Centennial Park. 
<BR><BR>
I think that Atlanta has done an incredible job organizing and putting on these Games.  The security is tremendous.  The transportation is fine, particularly considering that Atlanta is not a public transportation city.  The crowds are incredible, and while it is hot and difficult to wait in line, I thought they moved people through as efficiently as possible, and with good humor. 
<BR><BR>
Southern hospitality, indeed.  The volunteers were wonderful.  Even the security and law enforcement officials were warm and friendly while doing their jobs.   
<BR><BR>
I'm sure there were glitches.  So what.  It would be impossible to do this without some problems.  The fact is that I can't imagine any city doing a better job. 
<BR><BR>
I wish we could have stayed longer.
<BR><BR>
Three cheers for Atlanta!

<BR><BR>
I have just returned from Atlanta, where I was a jury member for the rowing competition at Lake Lanier.  On the whole, I think Atlanta did a very good job preparing the venues (I visited three or four, and seven different sports), but a lot of the good work was overshadowed by the transportation system for the athletes and the "Olympic family."  Unless you had a T1 credential (and thus were entitled to a private driver) the bus system (for us poor T4s) was a disaster.  The British women's coxed eight literally had to commandeer (they dislike th term hijack) a bus traveling to the field hockey venue and diverted it to the rowing venue by standing in the middle of the road until the bus stopped.  Busses scheduled for specific times showed up maybe 60% of the time.  Our drivers often got lost (so we had to direct them) and I heard that about 50 of them quit due to stress and inadequate training.  As usually happens when respources become scarce, people started engaging in side-deals and some entrepreneurship (including creative appropriation of ACOG vans and private cars).  Combined with the added security (expecially after the bomb) , it put a damper on proceedings. 
<BR><BR>
The other major glitch - with the computer results system - is quite an embarrassment for IBM.  The results system terminals at the venue was down for much of the rowing competition, which wasn't much of an inconvenience for us, but for the media in Atlanta at the MPC I am sure it was a problem.

I commend to all of you Albert R. Hunt's column in today's Wall Street Journal (p. A15) for an unbiased, positive view of the Atlanta games from a member of the media here on vacation with his family.  "No matter what you may read or hear, and notwithstanding the trauma of last weekend's terrorism, the Atlanta Olympics have been terrific."   
<BR><BR>
As an Atlanta resident (and admittedly an unabashed Olympics lover), I think the IOC made absolutely the right choice.  You couldn't pick a city with more enthusiasm for the games.  Yes, there have been a few glitches in trying to get 11,000 athletes, 15,000 media members and millions of visitors to the venues, but those occur everywhere, and most certainly would have been just as bad or worse in Athens or anywhere else.  Considering the massive scale of this undertaking, Atlanta has been superb, and ACOG has shouldered its burden admirably.

In answer to Jay Barber's earlier response to my posting, which as a moderator of this seminar was intended to spark conversation (it did!) not post my opinion, I must say that Atlanta has done a wonderful job at hosting the Olympics.  The whole point about bringing up problems is to identify the problem so that the next host countries (Nagano and Sydney) can learn from these "glitches".  I agree that the media (as always) exaggerates the issues and always makes a drama out of everything.  My friends who are working in Atlanta for ACOG and the USOC say everything, on the whole, is going well.  And let's face it - as Gail Devers said, The OLYMPIC SPIRIT WILL PREVAIL!  It is the Olympics, after all, and what an honor it would be to be in Atlanta, as a fan or an athlete!

I agree with Maria's post in all except the "as always" regarding the media approach.  Having grown up in the DC area, where "local" news is quite often really "national" news (or at least they treat it so), but having spent my career so far in smaller cities in the Midwest and the South, I perceive a definite tendency for the media from the coastal population centers to see most everyplace else as too small/unsophisticated to be taken seriously. 
<BR><BR>
The "as always" to me with the media is that, although they ostensibly operate as individuals, they tend to form a story line for major events into which the great majority tends to join.  The story line for L.A. was very "pro-American, look at how Peter Uberroth got this done," while the Barcelona line was "isn't this a charming, old, sophisticated city which is largely unknown to Americans."  I can't remember anything about the Seoul games (time difference problem, I guess). 
<BR><BR>
The story line for Atlanta (for all but NBC): the "Glitch Games."

<h2>Bromantan</h2>

The Russian swimmer who won the bronze medal in 200-meter breaststroke,
and a Russian wrestler who also won a bronze have both been stripped of
their medals after testing positive for Bromantan.  A Lithuanian cyclist
who did not medal also tested positive.<p> 

What is Bromantan?  What does it do, and why is it banned?  Also, do
these athletes intend to appeal?<p>

<BR><BR>
According to Prince Alexandre de Merode, chairman of the IOC medical
commission, bromantan is a "psychostimulant" and has the same properties
as amphetamines.  Merode claims that bromantan is manufactured by the
Russian army and has been used for years by athletes of the former
Soviet Union. 
<BR><BR>
The Russian Olympic committee has denied that bromantan is a stimulant
and has appealed the disqualifications of Andrei Korneyev (200-meter
breaststroke) and Zafar Gulyov (Greco-Roman wrestler).  Both athletes
were stripped of their bronze medals after testing positive for
bromantan.  A final verdict is expected today. 
<BR><BR>
The Russian delegation argues that the drug is not on the IOC's list of
banned substances.  Yet, Merode claims that the drug is covered under
the list of "related substances," thus disallowing its usage.

<h2>Defining a sport in the Games</h2>

<h3>Seminar Discussion Thread</h3><p>


What should define a sport in the Olympic Games? Is it a single
definition? Or is it an ever-changing definition? Is it any sport that
has to do with wartime activity (running, jumping, shooting, etc.) Does
stuff like beach volleyball and team handball belong in the Games?<p> 

What do you think?<p>

14:41:48 1996 <BR>Subject: Olympic Charter Definition <BR><BR>

Rule 52 of the Olympic Charter states that to be included as a sport in
the Olympic Games, the sport must conform with the following criteria: 
<BR><BR>
(1) only sports widely practised by men in at least 75 countries and on
4 continents, and by women in at least 40 countries and on 3 continents;

<BR><BR>
(2) only sports widely practised in at least 25 countries and on 3
continents may be included in the Winter Games; 
<BR><BR>
(3) sports are admitted to the programme of the Olympic Games at least 7
years before specific Olympic Games in respect of which no change shall
thereafter be permitted. 
<BR><BR>
In addition, to be included in the programme of the Olympic Games the
sport must not depend essentially on mechanical propulsion.  Of course,
the Charter also states that the IOC can make exceptions. Does anyone
else think that these criteria do not give us much guidance on what is
an Olympic sport?  Ballroom dancing is going to be an Olympic sport in
Sydney, I believe, which sabotages Ted's theory of war-related
activities (of course, an argument can be made that ballroom dancing was
practiced during wartime to relieve soldiers' stress!).  I really do not
have a clue as to how the IOC decides on what sports are "Olympic". 
Based on Rule 52, it seems that popularity is a huge factor! -Maria

<BR><BR>
Ballroom dancing aside, I believe Maria is right.  Popularity is quite
obviously a huge factor in the IOC's decision as to what may be included
in the Games as a "sport."  (The IOC regs define when a sport may be
included in the Olympics but do not define what is "sport")  This merely
continues the Olympic tradition of commercializing itself, discussed in
another thread.  If these "sports" are popular among recreational
"athletes," these people will more likely watch and attend more of the
Olympics and buy more Olympic merchandising.   
<BR><BR>
The more relevant question may be this:  If this is what people really
want to see, then is the trend a BAD thing?  It can be argued that the
IOC is merely giving what the consuming public demands.

Appended by: Suzanne Schiller -- Pepper Hamilton & Scheetz -
Philadelphia<BR> Date: Thu Aug  1 17:40:59 1996<BR> Subject: Is It A Bad Thing? 
<BR><BR>
I think including "recreational" and even professional (e.g. tennis,
baseball, basketball) sports benefits only two groups:  (1) the host
city/relevant Olympic organizing entities who share in the proceeds of
the ticket sales; and (2) the new sport participants who can claim to be
"Olympians."  On the other hand, I think it seriously devalues the value
of winning and the games as a whole.  On balance, I think we should
stick with some basic sports that epitomize the various aspects (e.g.
speed, strength, agility) of athletics.      
<BR><BR>
This is not to say, of course, that rhythm gymnasts or synchronized
swimmers do not necessarily display the same level of athletic ability
as sprinters or rowers; in fact, if an Olympic sport can be defined as
that which requires speed, strength, agility and grace, ballroom dancing
should be considered the perfect Olympic sport.  But just because a
"sport" exists or is a "crowd-pleaser" like beach volleyball doesn't
mean it should be included in the Olympic line-up.  Sure, it may be
arbitrary that a shot putter gets a chance at an Olympic medal while a
bocce player doesn't (bocce isn't an Olympic sport yet, is it?), but I
think a line needs to be drawn somewhere. 
<BR><BR>
And I think similar lines should be drawn within each sport.  For
example, what is the point of having 2-man, 4-man & 8-man rowing crews? 
Yes, technique, strategy and equipment are different, but it is all
rowing.  And why aren't the gymnastics individual all around and
apparatus medals based on the same routines?   For that matter, why
can't they be based on the routines done during the team competition? 
Finally, do we really need all these races at every conceivable distance
(100 m, 200 m, 400 m, etc.)   Pick one distance for sprinters, one for
middle-distance runners, and one for marathoners/cross-country runners.

Do you think NBC is alienating large segments of the viewing audience,
namely immigrants and foreign residents, by focusing so heavily on the
US led events and atheletes? NBC is apparently receiving many complaints
about this. Frank DeFord said on NPR this morning that all coverage is
skewed: Italy focuses on its athletes and Japan its favorites etc.  
<BR><BR>
For instance, during the men's team gymnastics competition when Russia 
and China were neck and neck, and NBC remained rivetted on the U.S.
team, which was posting fourth or fifth place. Viewers were robbed of
the tense competition and higher caliber gymnastics of these other
teams. 
<BR><BR>
Perhaps there should be two broadcasts, one very US oriented, with
sports that are popular in the U.S., such as swimming, gymnastics,
track, and weight lifting, and one that has more of an international
flare, focusing on the best athletes (even if they are from another
country) and highlighting sports that may be very popular throughout the
world, though not in the U.S., such as the equestrian events, rowing,
and fencing. We live in a global world and there are many
underappreciated sports in the Olympics.

Sure, the coverage is skewed toward U.S. athletes.  However, that does
not mean that the *best* athletes are being ignored if they come from
another country:  look at the coverage of -- and overall American
fascination with -- the weightlifter known as "Pocket Hercules."  Or the
Ethiopian woman who took the gold medal in the marathon.  I'm sure there
are many other examples as well. 
<BR><BR>
It seems to me that when U.S. athletes are in medal contention, they get
a lot of media attention.  When the Americans are not in contention,
other athletes get the attention.  Any why not?  Has political
correctness / diversity gotten to the point that we chastise ourselves
for being interested in our own athletes?

I've seen a good bit of coverage of other athletes.  In the heavyweight
weightlifting the other night a long story was done on the Russian who
won.  They did a piece following him to Moscow for a drug test & seeing
him at home with his pregnant wife.  A very positive piece.  And this is
an event that had a big American in it (Mark Henry).  In the actual
competition, there was lots of attention given to the Russian & the
other guy (I forget where he was from) battling it out for gold. 
<BR><BR>
Sure the Americans are featured more, but there seems to be coverage of
other athletes (even if it's not totally balanced).

Since I live in Michigan, I am lucky enough to have two viewing options:
 NBC, of course, and CBC (out of Windsor).  I absolutely agree that the
US coverage is extremely biased toward US athletes. I see sports on the
Canadian coverage of the Games which is either relegated to the nether
regions of late night on NBC or ignored altogether.  In addition, the
CBC coverage stays focused on the battles for the medals, not on
Canadian athletes, wherever they happen to be.    It certainly provides
a different perspective, and helps to show that "amateurism" is still
alive in the Olympics.

I'm not sure how CBC is doing in Canada.  I imagine they're doing pertty well there since, like NBC in the States, they're the only Canadian network broadcasting the Games.  Anecdotally, I know that everyone I know (friends, family, etc.) who has a choice is watching CBC.

I vote LOSE (I can vote on my own poll, can't I?), although I think, like many that they will win. 
<BR><BR>
A loss would bring everyone back to the pack and maybe make Olympioc basketball a bit more exciting again -- or would it just make the U.S. team even madder and we will have only THE best players -- Jordan, etc. -- on that team?

I can understand the annoyance with the emphasis the Dream Team gets in coverage, etc., but let's not carry that over automatically to the team itself.  With the exception of Barkely, this is quite a gentlemenly team, with Malone/Stockton/Robinson/Hill/Alajuwon, etc.  And they treated Desmond Tutu and Muhammad Ali quite gracefully, if you believe the NBC profile which showed those meetings. 
<BR><BR>
Also, let's not forget that these guys don't have much to gain financially from this--I believe many are playing for the medal, for their country and for love of the game.

I happen to agree with Greg--the Dream Team is made up of the best in the world who were competing for their country for a gold medal.  Remember, it was USA Basketball and the USOC and the sponsors of the Olympics who voted to have these "professionals" play.   IF YOU WERE A PROFESSIONAL ATHLETE WHO WAS ASKED TO PLAY FOR YOUR COUNTRY, what are you going to say?  NO??????  I don't think so.  Please don't begrudge these guys because they are SO GOOD!!  I would love to have their "problem"!

<h2>Seeking Asylum in Atlanta</h2>

<h3>Seminar Discussion Thread</h3><p> 

From: Todd Drucker -- CC- Law Editor - New York<BR>
Date: Thu Aug  1 12:46:29 1996<BR>
Subject: Seeking Asylum in Atlanta

<BR><BR>


Raed Ahmed, an Iraqi weight lifter, walked out of the Olympic village
yesterday and asked for political asylum in the U.S.. 
<BR><BR>
Ahmed became the first non-Cuban athlete to defect during the Games.  In
recent weeks, the Cuban team has lost two baseball players, two boxers,
and one boxing coach (who was on loan to Mexico). 
<BR><BR>
Does anyone know how the IOC, ACOG and the Immigration and
Naturalization Service is working together to handle these defections? 
Is there a special office set up?  Does the IOC have a policy (said or
unsaid), encouraging or discouraging visiting athletes from defecting?

<h2>Basics of International Law</h2>

<h3>Seminar Discussion Thread</h3><p> 


From: Christian Krahe -- Faupel, Krahe - Ueberlin<BR>
Date: Thu Aug  1 11:15:31 1996<BR>
Subject: Basics of International Law<BR><BR>



After having followed the discussion in this seminar, I have got the
impression that many problems are caused by the deficiency of a basic
sports law which is wordwidely accepted. Of course, as far as the
Olympic Games are concerned, there are the Olympic Charta and several
regulations to organize the competitions. However, athletes of 197
different countries participate in these Games  and each of these
countries has its own legal system which often does not harmonize with
the sports law at the place of the event. Summer Opympic Games in
Atlanta und Winter Olympic Games in Nagano happen in completely
different legal surroundings and traditions although it is evident that
the principles of Olympic law should be identical wherever the Games
take place. According to the common European legal opinion, Olympic law
is nothing else than general contractual conditions of a private
association (IOC) based on  private Swiss law. But with regard to the
international importance of IOC, Olympic law is much more similar to
public international law (ius gentium) than to national private law. In
order to secure the worldwide validity of Olympic law and its uniform
interpretation, we should agree on an own legal category of
international sports law covering the fundamental rights of sportsmen
and the legal status of the international federations.

What do you think about this in USA?

<BR><BR>
In reply to the August l remarks of my German colleague, Christian Kraehe, I am very skeptical about creating or recognizing an international sports law covering the fundamental rights of athletes, the legal status of international federations and similar matters. Reasons for my skepticism: l. National courts of law might thereby be (further) restricted from taking jurisdiction over and deciding disputes involving athletes' rights and their violation, and other matters where the rights of a person or entity is pitted against the establishment. For example, breakaway or new federations etc. Countries like the USA and Germany, and their courts, offer strong protection to personal and private rights, and others do not or not to the same degree. I do not wish to see that weakened, and in fact, would like to see it strengthened. 2. I am not sure I want to see a special,  "international law status" conferred upon or recognized to international (or national) sports federations. Reasons: similar to l. above. 3. I doubt very much that nations could agree on a common international sports law covering the fundamental rights of athletes and legal status of international federations and the like. Moreover, if agreement were reached, the result might be even more sports litigation. Perhaps my skepticism could be overcome after seeing specific proposals for such common "international sports law". Aaron N. Wise Klepner & Cayea, LLP New York City

COMMERCIAL LAW AND CONTRACTS

[Editor's Note: TV Globo, a Brazilian television network sued the
proprietor of The Corporate Key, which allegedly offered to arrange
housing for more than fifty TV Globo employees, as well as rental cars,
mobile phones, food service, office and secretarial services, and other
amenities, during the period of the Atlanta Olympic Games. According to
the complaint, services were provided incompletely and chaotically while
additional invoices were still submitted and paid for services which
were not provided. TV Globo charges common law fraud, breach of
contract, and state RICO violations.]

service of process for The Corporate Key Company is Meggen M. Mills.
Defendant The Corporate Key Company is subject to the jurisdiction and
venue of this Court by reason of the allegations hereinafter set forth.


FACTUAL STATEMENT

5.

Commencing in December 1994, Plaintiff TV Globo began dealing with
Defendant Meggen M. Mills and a business she called "The Corporate Key",
then located in Dallas, Texas, concerning accommodations for its
employees in Atlanta for the Centennial Olympic Games. At that time, TV
Globo, a television network in Brazil, was making arrangements for
coverage of the 1996 Games. The Defendant Meggen M. Mills, doing
business as The Corporate Key, held herself out as capable of providing
a wide array of services to TV Globo.

6.

TV Globo indicated at that time that it would need approximately fifty
(50) apartments, condominiums or hotel suites to house network employees
for varying lengths of time during and around the Olympic Games, and
Defendant Mills confirmed that she could provide such accommodations.
Additionally, Defendant Mills claimed that she could also provide rental
cars, mobile phones, food service, office and secretarial services,
concierge services, shuttle services and other amenities and
necessities. Defendant Mills promised in December 1994 to provide
specific options and prices in the near future.

7.

In the Spring of 1995, Defendant Mills, still working through the
business known as "The Corporate Key" in Dallas, Texas, identified a
number of premier Atlanta properties which she claimed were available
for rental by TV Globo, and she provided price ranges for each. In March
1995, Michele Naili, Executive Producer of the Sports Division of TV
Globo, traveled to Atlanta and met with Defendant Mills. Defendant Mills
took Ms. Naili on a tour of the various available properties, and
confirmed her previous assertions that she could provide housing of
plaintiff's choice, rental cars, mobile phones and other amenities.
Defendant Mills also provided up-dated prices for each accommodation. On
May 23, 1995, Michele Naili of TV Globo communicated by facsimile to
Defendant Mills that TV Globo would need eight (8) condominium units at
"The Grand", and ten ( 10) one-bedroom and forty (40) two-bedroom
apartments at the properties known as "The Parc Vue" and "Mayfair". Ms.
Naili also confirmed that she would get back to Defendant Mills shortly
with TV Globo's rental car needs. This communication is attached hereto
as Exhibit "A".

8.

At or about the same time, Defendant Mills sent by facsimile
transmission a "Letter of Confirmation" and "Security Deposit Statement"
attached hereto as Exhibit "B." The Letter of Confirmation states that a
reservation was being made on behalf of TV Globo for ten (10)
one-bedroom and forty (40) two-bedroom apartments at the Parc Vue or
Mayfair, and six (6) one-bedroom and two (2) two-bedroom condominiums at
The Grand. Defendant Mills's communication requested Security Deposits
for those apartments.

9.

In June 1995, TV Globo began payment of invoices to Defendant Mills and
her companies which ultimately totaled $490,398.92. On June 2, 1995, TV
Globo wired the amount of $49,290.00 to Defendant Mills via her Dallas
bank account for "Security Deposits" on the requested apartments.
Attached as Exhibit "C" hereto is Defendant Mills's June 5, 1995 "Letter
of Confirmation" specifying the number, types and specific locations of
the apartments reserved, along with her "Security Deposit Statement
Payment Receipt" acknowledging receipt of $49,290.00 as security
deposits for the specified apartments. Defendant Mills again confirmed
receipt of the security deposit in her communication of June 14, 1995,
attached as Exhibit "D", and promised Lease Agreement Forms within ten
(10) days.

10.

Representatives of TV Globo met with Defendant Mills in Atlanta twice
more following payment of the security deposits, at which time Defendant
Mills showed the representatives the properties where she had allegedly
reserved units for TV Globo with the funds paid to her and her companies
by TV Globo, and she provided options for rental cars and mobile phones
at that time.

11.

On June 5, 1995, Defendant Mills incorporated The Atlanta Corporate Key
Company, a Georgia corporation, and simultaneously incorporated The
Corporate Key Company, a Texas corporation, with herself as
incorporator, CEO, CFO and Secretary.

12.

On March 1, 1996, Defendant Mills, now operating through The Atlanta
Corporate Key Company from an office on Fourteenth Street in Atlanta,
Georgia, submitted three invoices to TV Globo;


A. Invoice #I-TVG/Rental, in the amount of $27,216.50 for the rental of
1 one- bedroom apartment and 2 two bedroom apartments for the period of
time between June 24, 1996 to August 11, 1996;

B. Invoice #II-TVG/Rental, in the amount of $91,866.50 for the rental of
10 two-bedroom apartments for the period of time between June 30, 1996
through August 11, 1996;

and

C. Invoice #III-TVG/Rental, for the rental of 9 one-bedroom and 28
two-bedroom apartments for the period July 7, 1996 through August 6,
1996. See Exhibits "E", "F" and "G" attached.


Those invoices were paid in full in the amount of $326,129.50 by wire
transfer to the Defendants' Texas corporation's bank account upon the
instructions of Mills contained in the foregoing Exhibits.

13.

Representatives of TV Globo arrived in Atlanta on or about June 24,
1996, and Defendants provided the 1 one-bedroom apartment and 2
two-bedroom apartments that had been paid for.

14.

More employees of TV Globo arrived on June 29, 1996, but on June 30th,
the Defendants could not provide the 10 two-bedroom apartments already
paid for and promised. After some chaos, the Defendants provided some
units to Plaintiff.

15.

In the meantime, at a time when Defendant Mills knew that she had not
properly applied the funds previously paid to her by TV Globo, and that
she did not have an adequate number of apartments rented to house the TV
Globo employees who were continuously arriving in Atlanta, Defendant The
Atlanta Corporate Key Company billed $62,010.00 to TV Globo for an
additional 10 premium apartment homes, along with $8,700.00 as a
"refundable mobile phone deposit". See Exhibit "H".

16.

On June 25, 1996, TV Globo paid Defendant The Atlanta Corporate Key
Company $70,180.00 by the check drawn on NationsBank attached hereto as
Exhibit "I", but Defendants co-mingled or converted those funds and
failed to apply them to the apartments and mobile phones as promised.

17.

Additional employees of TV Globo were arriving in Atlanta continuously,
but the Defendants failed to provide the apartments that the Defendants
had allegedly paid for in full and for which Defendants had been paid in
full by TV Globo. Numerous other individuals employed by other clients
of the Defendants arrived in Atlanta and found that their allegedly
prepaid apartments had never been reserved. Defendants, apparently
having commingled, converted or wasted the funds that had been given to
them to reserve and prepay for accommodations, needed additional monies
to replace the converted funds.

18.

On June 28, 1996, the Defendants billed TV Globo an additional
$44,799.92: $25,000.00 was allegedly for "Ancillary Service Deposit
Fully Refundable"; $11,269.92 was for "prepaid rental of 29 mobile
telephones", and; $8,000.00 was for "deposit" on 16 4-door mid-size
vehicles. Plaintiff paid said invoice by check on June 28, 1996. Upon
information and belief, Defendants then converted those funds to attempt
to secure apartments they had previously been paid for. See Exhibits "J"
and "K".

19.

Employees of TV Globo continued to arrive in Atlanta with no place to
stay. Representatives of TV Globo held numerous meetings with Defendant
Mills wherein she claimed that the apartments had all been properly
reserved and fully paid for, but she claimed that she was having
difficulty with furniture deliveries and other technicalities. Defendant
Mills stated that she had properly applied all funds and that all
prepaid apartments and services would be available shortly.

20.

Then, on July 8, 1996, Defendant Mills informed TV Globo by the letter
attached hereto as Exhibit "L", that "The Atlanta Corporate Key will not
be able to provide additional apartment homes for Rede Globo from this
date forward", and promised to refund any money owed. No such refund has
been made.

21.

TV Globo had paid the Defendants a total of $490,398.92. TV Globo had
contracted for, and fully paid for, 60 specific apartments at identified
locations. The Defendants provided only 24 apartments, and many of them
were inferior, one-bedroom units not equating to the comparable
apartments paid for.

22.

Additionally, even though TV Globo had fully paid for mobile phone
service for 29 phones, and had prepaid for 16 automobiles, the
Defendants had also misapplied those funds. Within days, mobile phones
were turned off, and the rental companies were calling back the
automobiles.

23.

With the Olympic Games about to begin and much work to be done, the
executives of TV Globo were forced to find alternative accommodations
for over 45 employees who had no where to stay. Also, arrangements had
to be made to restore critical mobile phone service and rental car
availability.

24.

As a result of Defendants' wrongful actions, TV Globo was forced to
enter into a lease with an unrelated condominium complex at a cost of
over $460,000.00. As a result of the wrongful actions of defendants, TV
Globo was forced to spend an additional $43,711.13 for cellular phone
deposits and service after having already fully paid Defendants to
provide such equipment and service. TV Globo will also be required to
spend additional amounts for rental vehicles in amounts not yet known.

25.

TV Globo paid to Defendants over $490,000.00 for specific accommodations
and services. The funds were not used for the specific purposes for
which they were paid. Upon information and belief, Defendants have
converted for their own personal use a substantial portion of
Plaintiff's $490,000.00.

26.

Plaintiff continues to incur and suffer irreparable harm as Defendants
continue spending, dissipating and concealing the misappropriated funds
belonging to Plaintiff.

27.

Defendants used the United States mail, telephones, telecopiers,
facsimile machines and bank wire transfers, and other instrumentalities
of interstate commerce in furtherance of their fraudulent and illegal
scheme. Such acts constitute violations of 18 U.S.C. Sections 1341, 1343
and other criminal code sections.

28.

The actions herein set forth by Defendants constitute "racketeering
activity" within the meaning of the Georgia RICO statutes.

29.

In furtherance of their fraudulent and unlawful scheme, Defendants
conducted similar transactions with other parties using the same
fraudulent promises, confirmations and commitments to defraud such
parties, including the Los Angeles Times, TV Azetca, TV Bandeirantes and
other organizations and entities.

30.

The foregoing constitutes an "enterprise", a "pattern of racketeering
activity" and prohibited activities within the meaning of the Georgia
RICO statutes.


COUNT I. Common Law Fraud

31.

Plaintiff realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations
contained in paragraphs 1 through 30 above set forth.

32.

Defendants, and each of them, defrauded Plaintiff in numerous ways:


A. Defendants contracted with Plaintiff to provide specific
accommodations and services, and billed Plaintiff for security deposits,
rental fees and other charges for specific apartments, rental homes,
mobile phones and services. Plaintiff paid Defendants in full for the
specific accommodations and services for which it contracted and was
billed. Rather than utilizing Plaintiff's funds for the stated purpose,
Defendants converted, commingled, dissipated, misappropriated, concealed
and diverted Plaintiff's money. Defendants then knowingly, with the
intent to deceive, confirmed to Plaintiff that its funds had been
properly utilized as security deposits and rental fees on specific
apartments, rental cars and mobile phones;

B. Knowing that Plaintiff's funds had been misappropriated and
misapplied, Defendants continued to knowingly misrepresent and deceive
Plaintiff by repeatedly confirming, both orally and in writing, that
specific accommodations and services had been reserved for Plaintiff's
employees in Atlanta for the Centennial Olympic Games;

C. As the employees began arriving in Atlanta to cover the Olympic
Games, Defendants billed the Plaintiff $70,180.00 on June 25th and
$44,799.92 on June 28th, allegedly for rental car deposits, mobile phone
rentals, "ancillary service deposit fully refundable" and for other
services, but at the time those amounts were billed and collected by
Defendants from Plaintiff, Defendants had a present intention to
misappropriate and misapply those funds, and did, in fact, convert,
commingle, misapply and dissipate those monies, and;

D. As the final phase of Defendants' preplanned and calculated
fraudulent scheme, Defendants waited until they assumed that Plaintiff
must have made alternative accommodations for its numerous employees who
had arrived and others who were set to arrive in the Atlanta area, and
then Defendants contacted Plaintiff again claiming that they could now
provide the accommodations for which Plaintiff had already paid
Defendants. Defendants' statements were knowingly false and fraudulent.
Defendants had no apartments or accommodations for Plaintiff's employees
because they had misappropriated the funds needed to pay the apartment
complexes.. Defendants' statements were made with the intent to create
the illusion that Defendants could preform their obligations under their
contract with Plaintiff. As late as June 11th, Defendant Mills claimed
that she had accommodations for Plaintiff's employees, but investigation
revealed that allegation to be totally false.


33.

Defendants' misrepresentations and lies were made with the purpose and
intent of defrauding and deceiving Plaintiff. Plaintiffjustifiably
relied on such misrepresentation and lies, and sustained substantial
damages as a result thereof.

34.

Plaintiff is entitled to recover of Defendants, jointly and severally,
compensatory damages well in excess of One Million Dollars
($1,000,000.00), plus interest to the date of judgment and attorneys'
fees and expenses of litigation.

35.

Plaintiff is also entitled to an award of punitive damages to be
assessed against Defendants, jointly and severally, pursuant to OCGA
Section 51-12-5.1 in that Defendants' actions showed willful misconduct,
malice, fraud, wantonness, oppression, or that entire want of care which
would raise the presumption of conscious indifference to consequence.


COUNT II. Conspiracy To Defraud

36.

Plaintiff realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations
contained in paragraphs 1 through 30, and paragraphs 31 through 35
above.

37.

Defendants, and each of them, engaged in a conspiracy to defraud
Plaintiff and committed acts in furtherance of such conspiracy,
including the acts set forth above.

38.

As a proximate result of Defendants' conspiracy to defraud, Plaintiff
has been damaged in an amount in excess of One Million Dollars
($1,000,000.00) plus interest to the date of judgment, attorneys' fees
and expenses of litigation..

39.

Plaintiff is also entitled to an award of punitive damages to be
assessed against Defendants, jointly and severally, pursuant to OCGA
Section 51-12-5.1, in that Defendants' actions showed willful
misconduct, malice, fraud, wantonness, oppression, or that entire want
of care which would raise the presumption of conscious indifference to
the consequences.


COUNT III. Constructive Trust

40.

Plaintiff realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations
contained in - paragraphs I-39 above set forth.

41.

Plaintiff remains the owner of the funds misappropriated by Defendants
and Defendants hold such funds wherever they may be traced and located,
and any properties, real or personal, purchased therewith as
constructive trustees of Plaintiff.

42.

Plaintiff is entitled to have a constructive trust and equitable lien
impressed upon the misappropriated funds, wherever they may be traced
and located, and on any and all properties purchased in whole or in part
with such funds.


COUNT IV Equitable Accounting

43.

Plaintiff realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations
contained in paragraphs 1 through 42 set forth above.

44.

Plaintiff is entitled to an equitable accounting pursuant to OCGA
Section 23-2-70, in order to account for all the misappropriated funds,
wherever they may be traced or located, and to account for all such
properties, real or personal, purchased with such funds.

45.

Plaintiff has no adequate remedy at law because without such an
accounting, Plaintiff will not be able adequately to trace, locate and
recover all misappropriated funds and other monies to Plaintiff.


COUNT V. Appointment Of A Receiver

46.

Plaintiff realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations
contained in paragraphs 1 through 42 set forth above.

47.

Pursuant to the Georgia Civil Practice Act, the common law of Georgia,
and OCGA Sections 9-8-1, 9-8-2 and 9-8-3, Plaintiff is entitled to have
a Receiver appointed to take possession of, preserve and protect the
misappropriated funds, wherever they maybe traced and located, and any
properties or other assets purchased with such funds.

48.

Without the appointment of a Receiver, Plaintiff's rights in such funds
and property cannot be fully protected, and the misappropriated funds
and properties or other assets purchased with such funds are in danger
of being secreted and divested by Defendants.


COUNT VI Common Law Conversion

49.

Plaintiff realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations
contained in paragraphs 1 through 30 above set forth.

50.

The Defendants, and each of them, have wrongfully appropriated,
embezzled and converted Plaintiff's funds to their personal use and
gain.

51.

Defendants have no right, title or interest in Plaintiff's funds
misappropriated as set forth above.

52.

Plaintiff is entitled to recover such misappropriated and converted
funds, from each and every Defendant/Co-conspirator, jointly and
severally.

53.

Plaintiff is also entitled to an award of punitive damages to be
assessed against Defendants, jointly and severally, pursuant to OCGA
Section 51-12-5. 1 in that Defendants' actions showed willful
misconduct, malice, fraud, wantonness, oppression, or that entire want
of care which would raise the presumption of conscious indifference to
consequences.


COUNT VII Breach Of Contract

54.

Plaintiff realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations
contained in paragraphs 1 through 30 above set forth.

55.

Plaintiff is entitled to compensatory and consequential damages
forseeably incurred as a result of Defendants' breach of contract, plus
interest, attorneys' fees and expenses of litigation.


COUNT VIII. Georgia RICO

56.

Plaintiff realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations
contained in paragraphs 1 through 30 above set forth.

57.

The association of the Defendants herein is a "enterprise" within the
meaning of OCGA Section 16-14-3. This enterprise was and is an ongoing
activity which has continued for over eighteen (18) months.

58.

During the relevant period, the Defendants have, in violation of OCGA
Section 16-14-4, conducted and participated in the conduct of the
affairs of this enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity
within the meaning of OCGA Section 16-14-3. Defendants devised the above
described scheme to defraud Plaintiff and others of substantial sums of
money as above set forth.

59.

In furtherance of the scheme to defraud, Defendants have committed
multiple indictable offenses constituting mail fraud and wire fraud
under 18 U.S.C. Sections 13-41 and 13-43, as set forth above in
paragraphs 1 through 32, which allegations are incorporated herein by
reference.

60.

Defendants have also committed numerous thefts by deception within the
meaning of OCGA Section 16-8-3, including, (a) by promising to perform
certain services when Defendants never intended to perform such services
or knew that such services would not be performed, and, ultimately, by
keeping Plaintiff's funds for their own use and benefit; (b) by
obtaining funds from Plaintiff by deceitful means or artful practice
with the intention of depriving it of its funds, (c) by creating or
confirming Plaintiff's impressions that specific accommodations and
services had been reserved and paid for on Plaintiff's behalf, which
existing facts were false and which Defendants knew or believed were
false, and (d) by billing Plaintiff on June 25th and June 28th for
assorted services and allegedly refundable deposits with the intention
of misappropriating and misapplying those funds to other uses.

61.

Defendants engaged in the conduct above set forth with the specific
intent of defrauding Plaintiff and in furtherance of their unlawful
schemes. Defendants participated in and conducted the affairs of the
enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity by committing
multiple incidents of racketeering activity having the same or similar
intents, results, accomplices, methods of commission, and the same
victim, which incidents are not isolated, all in violation of OCGA
Section 16-14-4. Plaintiff has been injured by reason of Defendants'
pattern of racketeering activity and other fraudulent offences, in an
amount to be proved at trial, but expected to be in excess of One
Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00). Plaintiff is entitled to recover three
times its actual damages sustained, plus punitive damages, attorneys'
fees and reasonable costs of investigation and litigation, all as
provided by OCGA Section 16-14-6.

62.

Plaintiff is also entitled to injunctive relief, including a Temporary
Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction, as provided in OCGA
Section 16-14-6.

wrongful acts;

C. Under Count III of the Complaint, that a constructive trust and
equitable lien be impressed in favor of Plaintiff on all funds

<h2>Olympic football </h2>

Does anyone have any idea as to when or if football  -- as in football, not soccer -- will be an Olympic sport?  Also, how about lacrosse?  I realize that these sports might not appeal to all audiences, but they would certainly be at least as appealing as some of the events that are passed off as sports.

<BR><BR>
I would venture a guess that American football will not be added as an Olympic sport for many years, if at all. While the sport may be the most popular sport in the United States, it is just now starting to catch on in Europe, where the World League has given the game a big boost. But since the rugby scores ALWAYS take the limelight away from the World League scores and even the NFL playoffs in the British and European sports pages, I don't think football has much of a chance as an Olympic sport in my lifetime. 
<BR><BR>
There are, however, lots of other sports that could be added. You mention lacrosse -- that may be one. Others may include golf (though this talk has been going on now for some 50 years) and, I hear, surfing. 
<BR><BR>
We'll see soon.

Aside from the fact that not many people besides Americans care about football (a fact I can't comprehend), there is also a logistical problem.  It would be difficult to have a football tournement in 17 days.  How many games could you fit in there, 3?  You'd have to have a lot of qualifying tourneys before the games to get the field down to 8 teams.

<h2>Samarach's Disdain</h2>

<h3>Seminar Discussion Thread</h3><p>

From: Suzanne Schiller -- Pepper Hamilton & Schee
<BR>Date: Mon Aug  5 13:17:00 1996
<BR>Subject: Samarach's Disdain<BR>
Last Append: Tue Aug  6 12:04:18 1996
<BR><BR>
I do not live in Atlanta, nor did I attend the games.  However, I still found it offensive that Samarach chose to criticize AOC even before the games were over, and failed to pronounce them "the best Olympics ever."  _Everyone_ I know who went to Atlanta said things were great there -- including many athletes (second and third hand, I admit).  That the biggest complaints were about IBM's computer not giving accurate stats to reporters, some athletic transportation problems, and the "commercialism" of the games seems indicative of the fact that Atlanta did a spectacular job.   
<BR><BR>
So, Samarach doesn't like the commercialism?  Bitch all you want at IBM . . . if they won't be able to get advertising milage out of it next time, there won't be *any* computers stats.   And where else does Samarach think the money will come from to fund an event that has become this large?  Certainly, smaller and poorer nations can't afford it at all; former Eastern block countries have enough problems as it is, and I can't imagine that people living in, say, Quebec (or even worse, Montreal), are going to agree to a tax increase so that games can be staged in Vancouver.  Samarach's idealism seems to be blinding him to reality on this one.

I happen to agree with you, Shosh.  Who does Samaranch think he's kidding?  The Olympic Games are a very expensive event to host--where does Samaranch expect the money to come from?  Billy Payne did such a good job for Atlanta that all of those Olympic facilities are PAID FOR.  Done deal. 
<BR><BR>
Samaranch's comment was rather an insult to Atlanta and, I believe, the United States.  Commercialism/private enterprise is how our country runs.  If Samaranch doesn't like it, he can try to persuade everyone not to keep voting for an American city to host the Games!  (Salt Lake City in 2002)

I'm with both of you. I appreciated the reference to the Munich disaster (as hidden of a reference as it was) but how can he not call the Atlanta games the best ever when he does the same thing for every other city? I seem to recall he called the Norway games the best ever and while they were fun, this was just as good.

He doesn't like commercialism? Next time he can pay for the Games himself.

Appended by: James Hirschhorn -- Sills Cummis - Newark <BR>Date: Mon Aug  5 18:32:42 1996 <BR>Subject: Where the Money Comes From 
<BR><BR>
It will have to come from governments.  The NYT reported over the weekend that the IOC will require for all future Olympics i)a government financial guarantee and ii)that the local organizing committee be subordinate to the local municipal government, as was the case in Barcelona. 
<BR><BR>
I'm not surprised.  Many people, myself included, think that the visibility of the commercial sponsors was vulgar, and one would expect that feeling to be fairly strong in the kind of stuffy old school tie types who seem to gravitate to the top of the IOC.  But more is involved than taste.  These guys own a very valuable trademark, and the value consists of the emotional associations that the Olympic movement has for the audience -- competition, purity, glory, sportsmanship, &c.  As we know from the constant fan complaints about how money has come to dominate the sports news, the appeal of sport is chivalric, aristocratic, and pre-commercial.   The appearance of those values is the reason, paradoxically, why the mass audience will pay (indirectly) to watch sports they pay no attention to for the other 3 years and 50 weeks of an Olympic cycle.  The value of the Olympic symbol has been somewhat  eroded already by the disappearance of amateurism in the big money sports, by the power of television to shape the public perception of the games, and by the need to cater to private sponsors.  The IOC doesn't want things to get to the point where the sponsors are more visible than the show, or where it looks too much like the athletes are just an excuse for the commercials, any more than Louis Vuitton (to pull a random designer brand name out of the air) would want to see its goods sold at Wal-Mart.   
<BR><BR>
They're like some late 19th century duke marrying an heiress whose father, God forbid, is in "trade":  they want the money and need it to preserve their position, they're somewhat ashamed of wanting the money,  and they have to keep the source of the money somewhat out of sight to preserve their position.  Their father in law's money is more than welcome, but the old man has to stay a decent distance away.

I have to go with the prevailing view.  Samarach's speech was the stereotypical "biting the hand that feeds you."  He likes to get as much money as he could but still lay back and complain about the vulgarity of the "Americans"?  Can't have it both ways my friend.

Appended by: Suzanne Schiller -- Pepper Hamilton & Scheetz - Philadelphia <BR>Date: Tue Aug  6 00:57:37 1996 <BR>Subject: Government Funding 
<BR><BR>
Samarach's desires are all well and good, but I can't see it happening . . . or at least, I can't see it happening and, at the same time, keeping the Olympics as a world-class, once in every four years event that will attract viewers and visitors from all over the world.   
<BR><BR>
Earlier in this seminar, there was a discussion of the Montreal financial disaster and whether it would dissuade cities from wanting to host an Olympics.  The responses were, "look at Los Angeles; with private funding there'll never be another Montreal." Well, I think the converse is also true -- take away the private funding, and any city that hosts an Olympics will be Montreal.  My guess is that the actual costs of putting on the games in Atlanta was more than the entire GNP for probably 175 of the 197 nations who participated.   Absent the sponsors, it seems to me pretty self-evident that hosting an Olympics is a fiscal losing proposition.   
<BR><BR>
Moreover, once you rely on governments to foot the entire bill, you're going to get Olympics on the cheap -- the few construction delays and safety concerns raised during the building of the new stadium in Atlanta will seem subatomic in proportion to what will happen if governments take over; you won't have to worry about bombs in Centennial Park-type places because there won't be such things, and the opening ceremonies will be reduced to the parade of nations and nothing more.  And when that happens, the tourists will stay away too; it is my impression that what brought most of the visitors to Atlanta (particularly the last minute visitors, which I think was a substantial number) was the desire to simply be "at" the site of the Oympics because everyone seemed to be having such a great time.   If Samarach has his way, then the games in Atlanta (or Sydney, depending on how they turn out) will be the last games which will truly be able to hold the distinction of the "best Olympics ever" (whether Samarach bestowed the magical words or not).

<BR><BR>
Clearly what Samaranch wants to do is get things back to the way they used to be prior to L.A.  If he can get enough competition between cities he can pull it off.  some of the recent bids have incorporated this heav y governmental largesse.  Berlin, for example, offered to make all of the tickets for events free.  I guess the best face on this is that Juan chose the wrong moment to state the longstanding IOC preserence for less commercialism.

Appended by: James Hirschhorn -- Sills Cummis - Newark <BR>Date: Tue Aug  6 12:04:18 1996 <BR>Subject: Government-Private 
<BR><BR>
Shosh, I think you are drawing too stark an antithesis between government and private funding.  The IOC objective isn't to push out private sponsors.  It is to draw as much private money is it can, consistent with the IOC image remaining in the foreground and the sponsors not, in the IOC's judgment, not overshadowing or controlling the show.   
<BR><BR>
In the short run, 4-12 years, I think this will work.  Olympic sponsorship on the IOC's terms still has commercial value.  Moreover, the big sponsors themselves would want a much more agressive policing of non-sponsor and small scale commercial activity.  (I gather that one of the objections to the Atlanta setup was the commercial clutter from the small time vendors whom the city licensed in order to pay for its expenses that ACOG didn't reimburse.)  In the long run, the glacial pressure of sponsor money will ultimately transform and take control of the event, as it has in American professional sports -- witness the tv time out and the disappearance of the daytime World Series game.  Moreover, in the long run mortality will change the membership of the IOC, and the next generation of stuffy old men may be more commercially minded than this one. 
<BR><BR>
I also think that it is a mistake to say "no more Montreals."  No North American or Western European government has the political support to spend huge sums on what is basically a prestige project, but the model of the Hitler Olympics is attractive elsewhere.  The Seoul games were a coming out party for South Korea, as were the Barcelona games for post-Franco Spain and for Catalonia.  Looking further back, the Rome, Tokyo and Munich games symbolized the rebuilding and new respectability of the former Axis powers, and the Moscow games were to have symbolized the parity of the USSR with the US.  The Chinese government would love the recognition implicit in being an Olympic host, and if all goes well the new South Africa would love to signal its successful arrival by holding the '08 games in Cape Town.   As Ken points out, the Germans seem to be willing to pay for a second Berlin games to celebrate the reunification of Germany.  After that, who knows what arriviste government will be willing and able to tax its people for this kind of display?  Political sponsorship is, I suspect, more palatable to the IOC than commercial sponsorship because more organized, more centralized, and less obtrusive, and because they're more at home with the idea of national glory than they are with the sale of goods. 
<BR><BR>
Finally, the ambiance surrounding the Olympic show is supposed to be a reflection of the local culture. Atlanta was.  The city, like much of this country, is run by its chamber of commerce types and considers nothing more important than the pursuit of the dollar as an end in itself.  It had to create Centennial Park as a place of  assembly because, like most American cities, everyone who can afford to do so has abandoned the center of the city, and no square, agora, promenade or other focus existed.  It created a good temporary approximation to the modern American place of public assembly -- the shopping mall.  Other sites will do it differently.  To me it is hypocritical for Samaranch et al to curl up their lip at Atlanta; they knew or should have known that they were coming to a place whose characteristic activity is marketing.

<BR><BR>
Samaranch is also partly responsible for the shear size of this event.  As discussed elsewhere in this seminar, sports (and categories within sports) proliferate.  Downsizing seems in order. 
<BR><BR>
At the closing ceremonies, there was an interesting preview of the Sydney games.  Seems that they are building a complex 10 miles up from the harbor--Costas said the venues will be closer together than ever before.  What do you do with this sports collossus when the games are over?  Where will the Olympic village be, and what will it be used for afterwards?

Appended by: Sanford J. Asman -- Hopkins & Thomas - Atlanta <BR>Date: Tue Aug  6 19:21:16 1996 <BR>Subject: Samarach's Disdain 
<BR><BR>
As I didn't see any replies from anyone else who actually attended the Olympics, let me be the first to say that first hand, it was fun to just be in the city during the games.  Aside from the tragic bombing, the Centennial Park was well done, and a very pleasant place to spend time with one's friends and families.  Notwithstanding the pre-games warnings about traffic, etc., Atlanta was truly a pleasure to get around in during the past few weeks, and only today did traffic return to normal levels, which are significantly higher than during the games. 
<BR><BR>
MARTA, notwithstanding the sporadic bad press, did a fabulous job of moving people all over -- and it operated for FREE, for anyone who was associated with the games, as a volunteer or ticket holder. 
<BR><BR>
The security forces, which increased significantly following the bombing did an exemplary job, and they all did what they had to do without being anything other than professional and polite. 
<BR><BR>
Commercialism??  I didn't watch much on TV, so I really can't address how that aspect looked.  On the other hand, things were available for sale, and people were buying them.  Otherwise, I guess the vendors would have packed up and gone home ... as some did.   
<BR><BR>
Samaranch??  I don't remember bumping into him on the street or in any of the venues.  If he was there, he would have seen the tens of thousands of locals who volunteered their time to assist in putting on the games, in getting people around the city, in being available for medical emergencies, assisting in parking, directing people at MARTA and the airport, in taking tickets and ushering at the venues, etc., etc., so if he thought it was too commercial and he didn't have a good time... Oh, well.... 
<BR><BR>
I could go on, but I guess you've got my opinion.

<h2>Roy Jones Jr. Goes For Gold</h2>

<h3>Seminar Discussion Thread</h3><p>



From: Todd Drucker -- CC- Law Editor - New York<BR>
Date: Tue Aug  6 14:01:36 1996<BR>
Subject: Roy Jones Jr. Goes For Gold

<BR><BR>

At a press conference last Sunday, Jerry Dusenberry, president of USA Boxing, revealed that the IOC has appointed a commission to investigate a disputed decision from the 1988 Seoul Games that resulted in American Light Heavyweight boxer Roy Jones Jr. losing the gold medal to Park Si-Hun of South Korea.  Jones lost the gold medal fight on a 3-2 decision, although most observers believed he clearly dominated Park.  
<BR><BR>
Last month, Dusenberry sent a report to the USOC, alleging that several judges were bribed in favor of South Koreans and that certain International Boxing Association officials were aware of it.  IOC Director General Francios Carrard stated that the IOC will report its findings in its next executive board meeting in October, 1996.  
<BR><BR>
I remember the fight quite well, and was stunned by the decision.  As I recall, Park raised Jones' hand after the decision was announced.  If the IOC decides there was corruption involved, will Jones finally get his much deserved gold medal?

that sport. Such an organization is exempt for a period of 2 years from the
date of enactment of this title [enacted Nov. 8, 1978] from meeting the

in which event the Corporation shall-- (A) suspend the recognition of such
national governing body; (B) revoke the recognition of such national
governing body; or (C) extend the 2-year period for not longer than 1 year,

<P>If, at the end of the extension period referred to in subparagraph (C) of
this paragraph, the national governing body has not complied with such
requirements, the Corporation shall revoke the recognition of such national
governing body. Any such national governing body aggrieved by the
Corporation's determination under this subsection may submit a demand for
arbitration in accordance with section 205 (c) of this title [36 USCS @
395]. </P>

<P>(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1), the Corporation may
suspend or revoke the recognition of a national governing body during the
2-year period if such suspension or revocation is for the same reason as
the Corporation could have revoked or suspended such national governing
body prior to the date of the enactment of this title [enacted Nov. 8,
1978]. </P>

<P>(d) Recommendation of national governing body as United States
representative to appropriate international sport federation.  Within 61
days after recognizing an amateur sports organization as a national
governing body, in accordance with subsection (a) of this section, the
Corporation shall recommend and support in any appropriate manner such
national governing body to the appropriate international sports federation
as the representative of the United States for that sport. </P>

equitable support and encouragement for participation by women where
separate programs for male and female athletes are conducted on a national

design, coaching, and performance analysis; and (9) encourage and support
research, development, and dissemination of information in the areas of

(A)Within 90 days after the filing of a complaint under paragraph (1) of
this subsection, if the Corporation determines that all such remedies have
been exhausted, it shall hold a hearing to receive testimony for the

Corporation a written application for such recognition. Such application
shall be filed (A) within the 1-year period after the final day of any
Olympic Games, in the case of a sport for which competition is held in the

case of a sport for which competition is held in the Pan-American Games and
not in the Olympic Games.  If two or more organizations file applications
for the same sport, such applications shall be considered in a single

<P>(2) Any application filed under this subsection shall be filed with the
Corporation by registered mail. The Corporation shall establish procedures
for the filing and disposition of applications received under this

governing body to continue as the national governing body for its sport;

arising under the provisions of this Act prior to making a final award, if

manner not inconsistent with the constitution and bylaws of the
Corporation.  (3) Each contesting party may be represented by counsel or by
any other duly authorized representative at the arbitration proceeding. The
parties may offer any evidence which they desire and shall produce any

upon their own motion or upon the motion of any contesting party, at any
time before a final decision is made, except that, if any contesting party
makes such a motion, all parties to the decision must agree to reopen the

<P><B>The Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games sues an Atlanta travel agency
over the Olympic name</B> </P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>by Jeffrey B. Gewirtz</B></FONT></P>

<P>In its aggressive effort to prevent ambush marketing in the Olympic Games
and the unauthorized use of the Olympic name and marks, the Atlanta
Committee for the Olympic Games -- the official organizing organization for
the Games, commonly known as ACOG -- has filed suit in federal court
against a travel agency over the company's alleged unauthorized unofficial
use of the "Olympics" name. </P>

<P>The Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games filed the suit in the federal
district court for the Northern District of Georgia on February 9, 1996
against the Event Group, an Atlanta-based travel and event planning
company.  Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games v. The Event Group,
L.C.C. (N.D. Ga., Atlanta Div., 2/9/96). </P>

<P>According to the complaint, in July 1995, The Event Group allegedly began
distributing materials that purported to offer the sale of transportation,
accommodations, and hospitality packages to the various 1996 Olympic
events.  The complaint further alleges, later that year, The Event Group
expanded its Olympic-related efforts by purporting to sell "1996 Summer
Olympic Games Ticket Packages" that allegedly included tickets to the
Olympic Opening and Closing Ceremonies and numerous Olympic sporting
events. </P>

<P>Contract Actions.  ACOG alleges The Event Group's activities were unlawful
because the Atlanta committee for the Olympic Games has been authorized to
act as the sole lawful source for the sale and distribution of all Olympic
tickets.  According to the complaint, all Olympic tickets include
provisions that tickets may not be resold or transferred, and that the
tickets particularly may not be resold to an entity that plans to offer the
tickets for resale--all activities ACOG alleged were conducted by The Event
Group.  While ACOG has licensed certain organizations to resell Olympic
tickets, it has not granted such rights to The Event Group. </P>

<P>The complaint, therefore, alleges that, upon purchasing the tickets from
ACOG, The Event Group was contractually bound not to resell the tickets to
third parties.  The Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games alleges a claim
for breach of contract against The Event Group for allegedly reselling the
tickets as part of Olympic packages.  The sports organizing committee also
alleges a claim for tortious interference with contract.  In its complaint,
ACOG alleges this second legal claim is based on the Event Group's alleged
knowing interference with ACOG's existing contractual relations with third
parties, including official Olympic sponsors and those individuals who
received Olympic tickets through ACOG's official ticket distribution
process. </P>

<P>Trademark Actions.  Pursuant to the Amateur Sports Act, 36 U.S.C. 380, the
United States Olympic Committee (USOC) has the exclusive right to use, for
the purposes of trade, certain marks such as the international Olympic
Committee's five interlocking rings, the word "Olympic," and other marks
related to the Olympic Games--all rights assigned by the USOC to the
Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games.  However, according to the
complaint, neither ACOG nor the USOC have given the authority to The Event
Group for the use of these Olympic marks.  ACOG, therefore, also alleges
The Event Group violated federal trademark law in its use of the word
"Olympic" in its promotional materials. </P>

<P>Moreover, section 15. U.S.C. 1125(a), expressly prohibits an individual
from using a symbol that is likely to deceive consumers as to the
sponsorship of the individual's product.  That law prohibits an individual
from using "any false designation of origin, false or misleading
description of fact, or false or misleading representation of fact which .
. . is likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive as to
the affiliation, connection, or association  of such person" with a
particular product. </P>

<P>In its complaint, ACOG alleges a cause of action for violation of this
section of the Lanham Act, claiming, The Event Group has violated federal
trademark law in making false and misleading representations of fact that
are likely to cause consumer confusion regarding the origin, sponsorship,
or approval of The Event Group's commercial activities.  The Olympic
organizing committee also alleges a cause of action for violation of state
law under the Georgia Uniform Descriptive Trade Practices Act, secs.
10-1-370. </P>

<P>In addition to monetary damages, the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic
Games demands a restraining order enjoining The Event Group from continuing
its sale of Olympic ticket packages. </P>

<P>ACOG also demands The Event Group disclose--to all entities to whom The
Event Group has sold unauthorized Olympic ticket packages--that its
activities violated ACOG's rights, and deliver to ACOG all letterhead,
advertising material, and other material that bear any Olympic trademarks. </P>

<B>"On Eve of Games, Team of Arbitrators Is Standing By" </B>

<B><FONT SIZE="-1">By Lolita Browning, Staff Reporter</FONT></B><BR>
<B><FONT SIZE="-1"><I>Fulton County Daily Report</I>, July 17,1996</FONT> </B>

<P>This year, for the first time, athletes in the Olympic Games must agree in
advance to take disputes with Olympic officials to binding arbitration. </P>

<P>The Games start this weekend, and arbitrators are standing by. </P>

<P>The athletes' agreement is a new section of the entry form that is
sometimes referred to as the "Butch Reynolds clause." It requires athletes
to submit any disputes with officials of the Games to a special arbitration
panel or be barred from the Olympics. </P>

<P>It was imposed after a long, costly court battle between Reynolds and the
International Amateur Athletic Federation over what the track federation
said was a positive drug test following a track meet in Monte Carlo,
Monaco. </P>

<P>The IAAF, the international body for track and field events, banned
Reynolds from competition for 28 months after the drug test in August 1990.
Reynolds will compete in the 400-meter race for the U.S. team. </P>

<P>Reynolds maintained he had not taken drugs and took the IAAF to court over
his suspension. A federal judge in Ohio awarded him $27.3 million in
damages and penalties in December 1992. But the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals threw out the award, saying U.S. courts have no jurisdiction over
the IAAF,  which is based in Monte Carlo, says Reynolds' current attorney,
James S. Albers Jr. of Albers & Albers in Columbus, Ohio. </P>

<P>Reynolds appealed the case to the U.S. Supreme Court, which refused to hear
it, Albers says. </P>

<P><H3>International Arbitration Court</H3></P>

<P>The International Olympic Committee, the International Sport Federation,
the National Olympic Committee and groups representing athletes have
created an arbitration courtthe Court of Arbitration for Sport, which is
under the supervision of the 20-member International Council of Arbitration
for Sport. </P>

<P>Reynolds says that although he signed the entry form for the Atlanta Games,
he considers arbitration clause  unconstitutional. </P>

<P>"If I want to represent my country, should I give up my rights?" Reynolds
asks. "I signed it under protest. Legally, they have no way of binding us
to that." </P>

<P>Albers, Reynolds' attorney, says the athlete had little choice. </P>

<P>"Common sense tells you that you have to be a member of this organization
if you want to participate in the Olympics," Albers says. "You have to play
by their rules." </P>

<P>Should a dispute reach arbitration, the parties are to choose from a list
of 150 arbitrators familiar with sports law, the Olympic arbitration court
says. Twelve of the 150 will be in Atlanta during the Games, says Geneva
lawyer Gabriella Kaufman, an official of the Geneva-based Court of
Arbitration and a professor of law at Geneva University. </P>

<P>In addition to the arbitrators for the IOC, the American Arbitration
Association maintains a roster of arbitrators to resolve disputes for the
U.S. Olympic Committee. </P>

<P>The latter group includes Atlanta lawyer William H. Schroder Jr., one of 16
Atlanta- area arbitrators who will be on call during the Games, says Toni
Griffin, director of public relations for the AAA in New York. </P>

<P>Schroder and the other arbitrators expect to settle disputes over such
matters as athletes' eligibility. </P>

<P>So far, 16 Olympics-related disputes have been decided by AAA arbitrators,
including four in Atlanta, Griffin says. </P>

<P>Each Atlanta case involved questions of eligibility, Griffin says. In one
case, arbitrators looked at a dispute involving the timeliness of the
filing of documents by an athlete to qualify. Another case involved the
eligibility of two coaches. The third dealt with a dispute over an
athlete's qualifying times. The fourth was over a conduct code matter,
Griffin says, declining to be more specific to protect the disputants'
confidentiality. </P>

<P>Schroder, of Schroder Partners, says switching to outside arbitration from
within the Olympics is a good idea. </P>

<P><H3>Assurance of Impartiality</H3></P>

<P>"I think that that's the way it ought to be," Schroder says. "That way you
can assure the athlete of impartiality." </P>

<P>The local arbitrators will be on call, serving in panels of three. </P>

<P>"We can be called any hour of the day or night" during the Games, Schroder
says. Notice could be as short as an hour, he says. </P>

<P>Decisions are binding, although appeals on certain grounds to the supreme
court of Switzerland are allowed, Kaufman says. </P>

<P>Meanwhile, Reynolds and Albers say they are considering filing a suit
against the attorneys who represented Reynolds in his case against the
IAAF. Lawyers with the Ohio firm Squires, Sanders and Dempsey made a
mistake, Albers says. </P>

<P>Had they filed the lawsuit in the correct court, Reynolds could have
received his award. But he did win on the facts, Albers says. </P>

<P>By press time, no one from Squires, Sanders and Dempsey had returned a
request for comment left with a secretary. </P>

<P>Reynolds, who in 1987 set the world record in the 400-meter runa record he
still ownssays mishandling caused the urine sample of a German female
athlete to be labeled as his. </P>

<P>According to the Medical Control Guide, Olympic athletes are tested for
various drugs immediately after winning an event. Tests are done for five
types of drugs: stimulants, narcotics, anabolic agents, diuretics and
peptide hormones and analogs.  </P>

<P><B>"Suit by Homeless Seems in Trouble with U.S. Judge" </B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="i1">By Emily Heller, Staff Reporter<BR>
<I>Fulton County Daily Report</I>, July 15,1996 </FONT></B></P>

<P>A federal judge says he will issue an order early this week on a federal
suit by seven homeless men trying to stop what they claim is an official
policy of sweeping them from the streets. </P>

<P>A partial bench ruling late last week by U.S. District Court Judge J. Owen
Forrester gave them little grounds to expect a victory, other than the
moral kind. </P>

<P>After a three-hour hearing on Thursday, Forrester denied the plaintiffs'
preliminary injunction of the city's aggressive-panhandling ordinance,
rejecting the claim that the law is unconstitutionally vague. </P>

<P>Forrester said he also had serious concerns about the plaintiffs' standing
in their attack on another ordinance, which outlaws behavior in parking
lots that police might perceive as a threat to people or property. </P>

<P>Forrester said he might be inclined to invalidate the ordinance. But he
said the plaintiffs had "major standing problems." The evidence showed that
the plaintiffs were arrested under numerous laws, but not that one, the
judge said. </P>

<P>Moreover, Forrester said, the plaintiffs had not showed "credible,
statistical evidence" to back their claim that the city systematically
clears its streets of beggars during major tourist events. The plaintiffs
are trying to stop the city from conducting another sweep for the Olympics.</P>


<P>Forrester did provide advocates for the homeless with what may have been
some consolation. He sharply criticized Atlanta officials for what he
called "indifference" to the problems of the homeless. The officials, he
said, ignore complaints about treatment of the homeless by the police and
give mainly lip service to the idea of teaching officers how to deal with
street people. </P>

<P>In particular, Forrester assailed Mayor Bill Campbell and Police Chief
Beverly Harvard, who gave depositions in the suit. </P>

<P>"Clearly they do nothing to investigate" complaints about police harassment
of homeless people, Forrester said. "It seems to the court that ... the
City of Atlanta is largely indifferent as to how its laws are enforced on
this group of people." </P>

<P>In response, Senior Assistant City Attorney Kendric E. Smith said the
criticism came from advocates for the homeless, not the homeless people
themselves. Thus city officials thought there was a "spin" on the
complaints and took them "with a grain of salt," Smith replied. </P>

<P>Speaking slowly and emphatically, Forrester said: "They didn't do a police
investigation. They didn't do anything. You don't have to be a rocket
scientist to see that it's an issue. Under the circumstances, it's
reasonable to do something." </P>

<P>The judge sarcastically took Harvard in particular to task for merely
asking line officers, "Is anybody violating the constitutional rights of
our citizens?" </P>

<P>Forrester also said the case contained unanswered evidence that the
plaintiffs had been arrested without probable cause. But the city's
indifference does not necessarily explain the unconstitutional arrests, he
said. </P>

<H3>What Constitutes a Crime?</H3>

<P>Forrester questioned Smith ironically about the 1996 city ordinance that
outlaws behavior in parking lots in "a manner not usual for law-abiding"
people and that would warrant a reasonable public safety concern. Last
month Forrester issued a temporary restraining order stopping the city from
enforcing the law passed in April. </P>

<P>At the hearing, he challenged Smith with a series of questions to establish
what he described as the law's vagueness. Might the following people be
arrested? he asked: </P>

<P>l Children playing marbles in a parking lot; </P>

<P>l An 18-year-old with a four-day beard, dirty hair and scruffy clothing,
holding a weapon while standing against a car waiting to meet buddies for a
hunting trip; </P>

<P>l Men playing football; or</P>

<P>l An epileptic having a seizure walking through a parking lot; </P>

<P>Smith replied that vulnerability to "clever hypotheticals" does not condemn
the law as overbroad. But how are the police supposed to enforce it?
Forrester asked, saying that he was not merely trying to think of clever
hypotheticals. </P>

<P>"The question is, what would the law allow [an officer] to do?" the judge
asked. Would the law give these people sufficient notice that what they
were doing would constitute a crime? he asked. </P>

<P>After the hearing Smith declined to comment, as did plaintiffs' attorneys
Kurt S. Kusiak and Matthew M. Burke, associates at the Boston firm of Ropes
& Gray. The attorneys said they had agreed with the judge not to discuss
the case with the media. Atchison v. City of Atlanta, No. 96-cv-1430
(N.D.Ga. filed June 10, 1996).  </P>

<P>Editor's Note: Self-styled advocates for the involuntarily homeless moved
for a TRO to prevent the city of Atlanta from enforcing certain ordinances
that reportedly are being used to reduce the homeless presence on the
streets of Atlanta before the Summer Olympics. The advocates allege that
the homeless have been targeted by three unconstitutional city ordinances
covering aggressive panhandling, interference with parked vehicles, and

ATLANTA DIVISION </P>

<P>ROBERT ATCHISON, CURTIS GATES, JOSEPH HORTON, ANTHONY JOHNSON,  DONALD J.
JOHNSON, DONALD V. PATTON, KENNETH WILSON (Plaintiffs) </P>

<P>The CITY OF ATLANTA, GEORGIA, a municipal corporation, and BEVERLY HARVARD
in her official capacity as CHIEF OF THE ATLANTA POLICE DEPARTMENT
(Defendants) </P></B>

<P>CIVIL ACTION
FILE NO. 1:96-CV-1430JOF</P>


<P>MOTION FOR A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER AND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION </P>

<P>Come now Plaintiffs and, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 57 and 65 and 28
U.S.C. Sections  2201 and 2202, file this motion for a temporary
restraining order and preliminary injunction. As grounds therefor,
Plaintiffs show the Court as follows:  </P>

<P>1.  This is an action to redress deprivations of constitutional liberties
suffered by certain homeless residents of the City of Atlanta, Georgia,
solely because of their involuntary homelessness. Plaintiffs seek
declaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief from (a) arrests made pursuant
to city ordinances which are facially unconstitutional, (b) the persistent
enforcement of these ordinances and a state statute which continue to be
unconstitutionally applied against the homeless as part of a systematic
effort to purge them from the streets and other public places, and (c) the
unconstitutional policy, practice and custom of harassing, intimidating,
detaining and arresting homeless people for engaging in harmless,
inoffensive and lawful activities they, by reason of their homelessness,
are forced to perform in public.  </P>


<P>2.  Plaintiffs' complaint is cast in six counts, which allege the
following:  </P>

<P>(a) Count I: Defendants have relied upon Chapter 3, Section 17-3006 of the
Code of Ordinances -- the Aggressive Panhandling Ordinance (the
"Panhandling Ordinance"), as a basis for harassing, intimidating and
arresting one or more of Plaintiffs. On its face, and as applied to one or
more of Plaintiffs, the Panhandling Ordinance:  </P>

<P>(i) infringes upon constitutionally protected expression and thus violates
the right to free speech under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the
United States Constitution;  </P>

<P>(ii) irrationally, arbitrarily, capriciously and without sufficient
justification distinguishes between panhandling and all other forms of
solicitation in violation of one or more of Plaintiffs' right to equal
protection of the laws as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the
United States Constitution; and  </P>

<P>(iii) prohibits conduct that is constitutionally protected and beyond the
City's police power and, thus, is unconstitutionally overbroad in violation
of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  </P>

<P>As a proximate result of Defendants' unconstitutional actions, one or more
of Plaintiffs have suffered, and continue to suffer, substantial injuries
and damage.  </P>

<P>(b) Count II: Defendants have relied upon Chapter 106, Article II, Section
106-57 -- Unauthorized Interference or Attempted Interference With Parked
Vehicles (the "Parked Vehicle Ordinance"), as a basis for harassing,
intimidating and arresting one or more of Plaintiffs. Either on its face,
as applied to one or more of Plaintiffs, or both, the Parked Vehicle
Ordinance:  </P>

<P>(i) is unconstitutionally vague in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to
the United States Constitution;  </P>

<P>(ii) violates one or more of Plaintiffs' fundamental constitutional rights
to travel and to freedom of movement; and  </P>

<P>(iii) violates one or more of Plaintiffs' right to be free from arrest
without probable cause.  </P>

<P>As a proximate result of Defendants' unconstitutional actions, one or more
of Plaintiffs have suffered, and continue to suffer, substantial injuries
and damage.  </P>

<P>(c) Count III: Defendants have relied upon O.C.G.A. Section 16-7-21 (the
"Criminal Trespass Law") as a basis for harassing, intimidating and
arresting one or more of Plaintiffs. As applied to one or more of
Plaintiffs, the Criminal Trespass Law:  </P>

<P>(i) is unconstitutionally vague in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to
the United States Constitution; and  </P>

<P>(ii) violates one or more of Plaintiffs' fundamental constitutional rights
to travel and to freedom of movement.  </P>

<P>As a proximate result of Defendants' unconstitutional actions, one or more
of Plaintiffs have suffered, and continue to suffer, substantial injuries
and damage.  </P>

<P>(d) Count IV: Defendants, acting under color of state law, have violated 42
U.S.C. Section 1983 by engaging in a policy, practice and custom of
arresting, threatening to arrest, intimidating and otherwise harassing
Plaintiffs as part of the homeless population of Atlanta. As a proximate
result of this policy, practice and custom, Defendants have deprived
Plaintiffs of rights, privileges and immunities secured by the United
States Constitution. As a proximate result of Defendants' unconstitutional
actions, Plaintiffs have suffered, and continue to suffer, substantial
injuries and damage.  </P>

<P>(e) Count V: Defendants' policy, practice and custom of arresting,
harassing and otherwise interfering with the daily lives of Plaintiffs, as
part of the general homeless population of Atlanta, violates their
fundamental constitutional rights to travel and freedom of movement. As a
proximate result of Defendants' unconstitutional actions, Plaintiffs have
suffered, and continue to suffer, substantial injuries and damage.  </P>

<P>(f) Count VI: In detaining and arresting homeless persons for engaging in
conduct which constitutes the ordinary and essential activities of daily
life, Defendants are detaining and arresting Plaintiffs on a purely
pretextual basis. Defendants' policy, practice and custom of effecting
these purely pretextual detentions and arrests violates the rights of
Plaintiffs to be free from unreasonable search and seizure as protected by
the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. As
a proximate result of Defendants' unconstitutional actions, Plaintiffs have
suffered, and continue to suffer, substantial injuries and damage.  </P>


<P>3.  In their complaint, Plaintiffs seek the following equitable and legal
relief:  </P>

<P>(a) A declaration that the Panhandling Ordinance is unconstitutional on its
face; (b) A declaration that the Panhandling Ordinance is unconstitutional
as applied to Plaintiffs;  </P>

<P>(c) A declaration that the Parked Vehicle Ordinance is unconstitutional on
its face;  </P>

<P>(d) A declaration that the Parked Vehicle Ordinance is unconstitutional as
applied to Plaintiffs;  </P>

<P>(e) A declaration that the Criminal Trespass Law is unconstitutional as
applied to Plaintiffs;  </P>

<P>(f) A declaration that Defendants' policy, practice and custom of
arresting, threatening to arrest, intimidating and otherwise harassing
Plaintiffs and the homeless population of Atlanta in general is violative
of 42 U.S.C. Section 1983;  </P>

<P>(g) The entry of a temporary and permanent injunction prohibiting
Defendants from effecting any arrests or otherwise stopping, detaining or
harassing any person under the authority of Chapter 3, Section 17-3006 of
the Code of Ordinances -- the Aggressive Panhandling Ordinance -- or
Chapter 106, Article II, Section 106-57 -- the Parked Vehicle Ordinance:  </P>

<P>(h) The entry of a temporary and permanent injunction prohibiting
Defendants from effecting arrests or otherwise stopping, detaining or
harassing any person by applying O.C.G.A. Section 16-7-21 -- the Criminal
Trespass Law -- in an unconstitutional manner;  </P>

<P>(i) The entry of a temporary and permanent injunction prohibiting
Defendants from engaging in their policy, practice and custom of arresting
or otherwise intimidating and harassing Plaintiffs as part of the general
homeless population of Atlanta for engaging in ordinary  and essential
activities of their lives on or about the public streets of Atlanta;  </P>

<P>(j) An award of compensatory damages for the pain and injury Plaintiffs
have suffered as  the proximate result of Defendants' actions;  </P>

<P>(k) An award of reasonable attorney's fees and costs pursuant to 42 U.S.C.
Section 1988; and  </P>

<P>(l) Any further relief as the Court may deem just and appropriate. </P>



<P>4.  As delineated more fully in their supporting memorandum, filed
contemporaneously herewith,  Plaintiffs show that they are entitled to the
relief requested for the following reasons:  </P>

<P>(a) Plaintiffs have established a substantial likelihood of success on the
merits of their claims that:  </P>

<P>(i) the challenged ordinances are unconstitutional on their face and as
applied;  </P>

<P>(ii) the challenged statute is unconstitutional as applied;  </P>

<P>(iii) Defendants' policy, practice and custom of arresting, threatening to
arrest,  intimidating and otherwise harassing homeless citizens such as
Plaintiffs violates 42 U.S.C. Section 1983;  </P>

<P>(iv) The policy, practice and custom of arresting, threatening to arrest,
intimidating  and otherwise harassing homeless citizens such as Plaintiffs
violates Plaintiffs' fundamental  constitutional rights to travel and
freedom of movement; and  </P>

<P>(v) The policy, practice and custom of arresting, threatening to arrest,
intimidating and otherwise harassing homeless citizens such as Plaintiffs
violates Plaintiffs' right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure
under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States
Constitution.  </P>

<P>(b) Plaintiffs have established that their continuing constitutional
deprivations are irreparable in nature, and cannot be adequately
compensated by remedies at law. Likewise, the fear and loss of dignity
incident to repeated arrests and detention for honest activities can only
be sufficiently redressed by an order by this Court invalidating the
ordinances and the application of the state law at issue and enjoining
Defendants' harassment of homeless individuals.  </P>

<P>(c) Plaintiffs have established that the injury and threat of continued
injury to Plaintiffs outweighs any potential harm to Defendants from an
injunction. Defendants' interest in preventing crime in Atlanta is amply
served by the enforcement of other, unchallenged laws that are clearly
expressed and neutrally applied. Defendants will endure no harm in abiding
by the requirements of the Constitution.  </P>

<P>(d) Plaintiffs have established that an injunction would not disserve the
public interest. Defendants have numerous ordinances and statutes that are
clearly expressed and neutrally applied to ensure the public safety.  </P>


<P>5.
Pursuant to Local Rule 220-3, Plaintiffs seek an immediate hearing on their
request for a temporary restraining order. As discussed herein, Plaintiffs
are subjected to Defendants' policy, practice, and custom of arresting,
threatening to arrest, intimidating, and otherwise harassing homeless
citizens on a daily basis. In light of this grave and continuous
deprivation of Plaintiffs' constitutional rights, and the fact that the
only plausible relief for Plaintiffs is a temporary restraining order from
this Court, an immediate hearing on Plaintiffs' motion is a necessity.  </P>


<P>6.
Plaintiffs request that the Court enter an order:  </P>

<P>(1) Temporarily enjoining Defendants from effecting any arrests or
otherwise stopping, detaining or harassing any person under the authority
of Chapter 3, Section 17-30(16 of the Code of Ordinances -- the Aggressive
Panhandling Ordinance;  </P>

<P>(2) Temporarily enjoining Defendants from effecting any arrests or
otherwise stopping, detaining or harassing any person under the authority
of Chapter 106, Article II, Section 106-57 -- the Parked Vehicle Ordinance;
</P> 

<P>(3) Temporarily enjoining Defendants from effecting arrests or otherwise
stopping, detaining or harassing any person by applying O.C.G.A. Section
16-7-21 -- the Criminal Trespass Law -- in an unconstitutional manner;  </P>

<P>(4) Temporarily enjoining Defendants from engaging in any policy, practice
and custom of arresting, threatening to arrest, intimidating and otherwise
harassing Plaintiffs and the homeless population of Atlanta in general in
violation of 42 U.S.C. Section 1983; and  </P>

<P>(5) Temporarily enjoining Defendants from arresting or otherwise
intimidating and harassing Plaintiffs as part of the general homeless
population of Atlanta for engaging in ordinary and essential activities of
their lives on or about the public streets of Atlanta.  </P>


<P>7.</P>

<P>In support of their motion, Plaintiffs rely upon all pleadings, documents
and exhibits of record, in addition to the following exhibits attached to
their Memorandum in Support of Plaintiffs' Motion for a Temporary
Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction:  </P>

<P>(1) Exhibit A -- Affidavit of Anita Beaty, discussing the number and
condition of the homeless in Atlanta;  </P>

<P>(2) Exhibit B -- Affidavits of Plaintiffs, describing their homelessness
and their treatment by the Atlanta Police;  </P>

<P>(3) Exhibit C -- Affidavit of Michael Grazio, summarizing and attaching the
declarations of 161 homeless residents of Atlanta describing their
treatment by the Atlanta Police;  </P>

Atlanta's homeless and observations of the treatment of the homeless by the
Atlanta Police;  </P>

<P>(6) Exhibit F -- Affidavit of Hollande Levinson, describing her
observations of the treatment of the homeless by the Atlanta Police;  </P>

<P>(7) Exhibit G -- Affidavit of Elizabeth Dede, describing her observations
of the treatment of the homeless by the Atlanta Police;  </P>

<P>(8) Exhibit H -- Affidavit of Ron Jackson, describing his observations of
the treatment of the homeless by the Atlanta Police;  </P>

<P>(9) Exhibit I -- Photograph of Aggressive Panhandling Ordinance Sign posted
in the City of Atlanta;  </P>

<P>Editor's Note: U.S. District Judge Owen Forrester ruled that Atlanta's
Aggressive Panhandling Ordinance was unconstitutional in part. He found
specifically that prohibiting "continuing to request, beg or solicit alms
in close proximity to [an] individual" was unconstitutional. The court
denied plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. However, the court
noted that there was strong evidence of a pattern of police harassment of
the homeless that was "disconcerting." </P>

<B><P>IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF GEORGIA
ATLANTA DIVISION </P>

<P>ROBERT ATCHISON, et al., (Plaintiffs)</P>

<P>vs</P>

<P>THE CITY OF ATLANTA, GEORGIA, et al., (Defendants) </P></B>

<P>CIVIL ACTION NO.
1:96-CV-1430-JOF</P>


<P>ORDER</P>

<P>This matter is before the court on Plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary
injunction [5-1].  </P>

<P>I. STATEMENT OF THE CASE</P>

<P>Alleging that Defendants have instituted a systematic effort to purge the
streets of the homeless,1 Plaintiffs have challenged the facial and "as
applied" constitutionality of two city ordinances: (1) Section 106-85 of
the Code of Ordinances of the City of Atlanta, (the "Aggressive Panhandling
Ordinance"), and (2) Section 106-57 of the Code of Ordinances of the City
of Atlanta (the "Parked Vehicle Ordinance"). Plaintiffs also claim that
Defendants have a custom, practice, and policy of harassing, intimidating,
detaining and arresting the homeless engaged in lawful activity in
violation of the First, Fourth, Fifth and Fourteen Amendments.  </P>

<P>At a hearing conducted on June 19, 1995, this court issued a temporary
restraining order enjoining the City of Atlanta from charging or
prosecuting anyone based upon one provision, Section 106-57(a)(3) of the
Parked Vehicle Ordinance. After the parties conducted expedited discovery,
the court entertained further oral arguments from the parties in support
and opposition to this motion for a preliminary injunction on July 11,
1996. At the close of that hearing, the court deferred ruling on the
Section 1983 claims based upon alleged Fourth Amendment violations and
verbally indicated its intention to deny the motion for preliminary
injunction as to the Aggressive Panhandling Ordinance and grant in part the
motion as to the Parked Vehicle Ordinance if Plaintiffs proved that
Plaintiffs had standing to challenge the ordinance. After further
consideration of the issues and materials that the parties have submitted
in this matter, however, the court now GRANTS the motion for preliminary
injunction IN PART as to one provision of the Aggressive Panhandling
Ordinance, and DENIES the motion for a preliminary injunction on all
remaining matters, including the Parked Vehicle Ordinance and the matters
underlying Plaintiffs' Section 1983 claims.  </P>


<P>II. STATEMENT OF FACTS</P>

<P>The record developed before the court thus far reveals a disconcerting
pattern in which Atlanta police officers have arrested and detained
individuals engaged in lawful activity upon the streets of Atlanta for
alleged criminal violations. After the homeless Plaintiffs were kept in
custody for a number of days, charges for the crimes alleged were dismissed
either on the motion of the solicitor or based upon the failure of the
officer or the failure of an accused who had been released on bond to
appear in court. An initial review of the evidence from expedited discovery
and unrefuted affidavits now before the court suggests strongly that the
Plaintiffs may at trial be able to show that in the past eight months
Plaintiffs have been subjected to arrests in which the arresting officer
lacked probable cause to effect an arrest on at least ten occasions.
Although the materials submitted make a detailed reconstruction of the
events difficult, the circumstances of those arrests follow:  </P>


<P>*  On the night of November 21, 1995, Officer A.C. Huntley observed
Plaintiff Robert Atchison on foot holding his "Homeless - Please Help" sign
soliciting from cars at the intersection of Spring and Linden Streets.
Huntley Aff. at Paragraph 10. Officer Huntley warned Atchison that he would
arrest him if he continued to approach the cars soliciting money. Id. On
the following evening, however, Officer Huntley witnessed Atchison in the
same location soliciting money in the same manner. Id. at Paragraph 11.
Atchison did not frighten, block, or act in any manner to force people to
contribute, and respected the negative responses of persons who told him
that they would not help him. Atchison Aff. at Paragraph 5. Yet, Huntley
arrested Atchison for habitual begging and sent him to the Pretrial
Detention Center, where Atchison was held for three days until the charges
were dismissed on motion of the prosecution. Atchison Aff. at Paragraph 5;
Huntley Aff. at Paragraph 11; Defendants' Ex. A to Huntley Aff.  </P>

<P>*  In January 1996, Joseph Horton was talking with another homeless man at
the intersection of Whitehall and McDaniel Streets when a police car pulled
up and the officer frisked and arrested the men for panhandling. Horton
Aff. at Paragraphs 4-5. After Horton was held at the Pretrial Detention
Center for the weekend, the charges were dismissed on the motion of the
solicitor. Id.  </P>

<P>*  On February 22, 1996, Officer R. Thomas arrested Atchison at the corner
of Ellis and Piedmont for begging in violation of Section 106-85 as well as
for disorderly conduct based solely upon Atchison's display of his
"Homeless -Please Help" sign to oncoming traffic and pedestrians. Atchison
Aff. at Paragraph 7; see also Arrest Citation at Defendants' Ex. 19 of
Defendants' Memorandum in Opposition to Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary
Injunction. After Atchison served three days in the Pretrial Detention
Center, the charges were dismissed because the officer was not in court.
Id.  </P>

<P>*  In March 1996, the police discovered Curtis Gates as he was changing the
flat tire of a woman whose car was disabled in the vicinity of Interstate
20 and Ashby Street. Gates Aff. at Paragraph 6. Despite the woman's
proffered explanation, the police officer charged Gates with vending
without a permit and held Gates overnight at the Pretrial Detention Center
until the charges were dismissed. Id.  </P>

<P>*  On April 28, 1996, Gates asked a customer at the BP gas station on Lee
Street if he could clean his windows. Gates Aff. at Paragraph 8. Upon the
customer's refusal, Gates has alleged that he never repeated his request,
nor forced his presence or help upon the customer. Id. Officer T.J. Humes
subsequently arrested Gates for begging and soliciting; Humes has indicated
that Gates continued his solicitation after the customer gave a negative
response. See Arrest Citation at Defendants' Ex. 19 of Defendants'
Memorandum in Opposition to Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction.
Yet, after Gates was kept in custody at the Pretrial Detention Center, the
charges were dismissed. Gates Aff. at Paragraph 8.  </P>

<P>*  On May 23, 1996, Officer R. A. Bettis arrested Gates for criminal
trespass near the Exxon station at 500 Ashby Street. Gates Aff. at
Paragraph 9. At the time of his arrest, Gates was not on private property,
but rather was walking down Ashby Street assisting a man in looking on the
sidewalk for a gas container. Id. Bettis has indicated that Gates
previously had been warned to remain away from the location. See Arrest
Citation at Defendants' Ex. 19 of Defendants' Memorandum in Opposition to
Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction. After a two-day detention,
however, the charges were dismissed. Gates Aff. at Paragraph 10.  </P>

<P>*  On three separate dates in May 1996, officers arrested Atchison for
illegal pedestrian solicitation of rides or business for merely displaying
his "Homeless -- Please Help" sign to oncoming cars. Atchison Aff. at
Paragraphs 10-12; Huntley Aff. at Paragraph 12; see also Defendants' Ex. B
to Huntley Aff.  </P>

<P>*  On April 22, 1996, Anthony Johnson was cutting through a parking lot to
get dinner. A. Johnson Aff. at Paragraph 8. Without providing Johnson with
an opportunity to explain, Officer Daud Sheikh, who had previously warned
Johnson to stay away from that lot, arrested Johnson for being "an
unauthorized person in a parking lot" under the former ordinance found at
Section 106-57. Id. at Paragraphs 8-9; Sheikh Aff. at Paragraphs 4-5; Ex. A
to Sheikh's Aff. Id. Although the former ordinance was repealed on April 9,
1996, Officer Sheikh was unaware of the enactment of the new Parked Vehicle
Ordinance. Sheikh Aff. at Paragraph 5. The charges were subsequently
dismissed when Officer Sheikh could not appear in court. A. Johnson Aff. at
Paragraph 8-9; Sheikh Aff. at Paragraph 7; Ex. A. to Sheikh's Aff.  </P>


<P>Even in situations where an actual arrest or institution of charges was not
involved, it appears that police officers exceeded their authority in a
manner with constitutional implications while dealing with the homeless.
For example, Plaintiff Kenneth Wilson has averred that, at the end of 1995,
a number of Atlanta police arrived in the parking lot of TempCorps where he
was assembled with a group of homeless men seeking work. Wilson Aff. at
Paragraph 6. Without explanation, the police lined up the men against a
fence and frisked them. Id.  </P>

<P>In March of 1996, another police officer approached Kenneth Wilson when he
was crossing a police parking lot near the Jefferson Place Shelter; the
officer threatened and handcuffed Wilson before another officer intervened
and clarified that Wilson was not the same individual who had received
prior warnings about crossing the police parking lot. Horton Aff. at
Paragraphs 4-5. In a similar vein, Plaintiff Donald Johnson has averred
that in May 1996, a police officer apprehended Johnson and some friends who
were merely having a discussion at St. Luke's. D. Johnson Aff. at Paragraph
11. After spending the night in custody at the Pretrial Detention Center,
the group was released without charges being pressed. Id.  </P>

<P>The facts and allegations found within a number of the sworn declarations
submitted from one hundred sixty-one homeless men in Atlanta shed further
light upon the nature of the alleged Fourth Amendment violations and the
potential evidence available to demonstrate widespread violations of the
constitutional rights of persons living on the streets. See Ex. C to
Plaintiffs' Amended Memorandum in Support of Plaintiffs' Motion for A
Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction. Although some of
the declarations appear to include valid stops and circumstances that
clearly warranted further police inquiry and action, dozens of the
declarations recount incidents in which officers randomly and without
apparent cause checked a person's identification, threatened arrest, or
ordered the men to "move along." Other declarants have described incidents
similar to those that the Plaintiffs have experienced in which officers
arrested and detained them at the Pretrial Detention Center for a number of
days before the charges were dismissed.  </P>

<P>The court recognizes that the City of Atlanta and its officials have shown
their concern for the plight of the homeless through, inter alia,
allocation of funds and social programs on behalf of the homeless. See
Campbell Dep. at 55. Yet, the limited discovery taken to date shows that
the mayor and police chief were on general notice that the homeless feared
police misconduct and sweeps, and have been largely indifferent to managing
the law enforcement response. Before the Super Bowl was held in Atlanta,
Mayor Bill Campbell met with a group of homeless who indicated that they
feared that the City would clear them from the streets. Campbell Dep. at
13-14. On another occasion, the Mayor also met with a homeless advocacy
group marching to City Hall in protest of alleged police harassment. Id. at
48. Although the Mayor still attributes the source of these allegations to
Anita Beatty, the Director of the Atlanta Task Force for the Homeless from
whom Campbell has received letters and heard complaints about the treatment
of the homeless, id. at 24, 34, 40-41, some of the homeless persons that
Campbell has met during his tenure as mayor as well as other homeless
advocacy groups have also expressed these same general concerns. Id. at
33-34. Further, it appears that at least two department heads within the
administration had some confirming data.2  Atlanta Police Department Chief
Beverly Harvard has also admitted to reading reports of alleged police
harassment and sweeps of the homeless in the newspaper. Harvard Dep. at
18-20.  </P>

<P>Little was done in response to these reports. The Mayor did meet with
Harvard and Crosslea to ensure that there was no harassment policy in place
and to issue oral instructions directing against such a policy. Campbell
Dep. at 35, 56-58; Harvard Dep. at 11-14. Aside from informal internal
inquiries among division commanders concerning policy directives, neither
the Mayor nor the Chief of Police initiated an investigation of the arrests
of the homeless. Harvard Dep. at 20-23, 27; Campbell Dep. at 18.  </P>

<P>Finally, the evidence arising from the limited discovery further reveals
that police officers responsible for patrolling the streets have not
received sufficient training in order to prepare them for regular
encounters with the homeless. New recruits to the Atlanta Police Department
receive 936 hours of classroom training and 240 hours of field training.
Johnson Dep. at 20-21. Officers appear to spend eighty hours of course work
focusing upon criminal procedure, which includes probable cause and
warrantless arrests. Nichols Aff. at Paragraphs 5, 7. Yet, only twenty
hours of the classroom training constitutes the instruction afforded for
all of the many city ordinances. Johnson Dep. at 46. As for any
subsequently enacted ordinance, the Atlanta Police Department relies
largely upon a brief discussion or a short handout summarizing the new
ordinance during roll call. Johnson Dep. at 9; McFarland Dep. at 13-14.
There is no verification procedure in place under which the Department
ensures that officers on the beat have either read the ordinance or the
summaries of the ordinance provided. McFarland Dep. at 13-14. In addition,
it does not appear that officers have received "any instruction of any kind
regarding how they should interact with homeless people." Weaver Dep. at
14, 60; McFarland Dep. at 19; Humes Dep. at 16, 45; Johnson Dep. at 24.  </P>

<P>It is apparent that officers on the beat have not been fully trained
regarding the scope and application of the Aggressive Panhandling
Ordinance, the Parked Vehicle Ordinance, or even these ordinances'
predecessors. See Johnson Dep. at 37-38. When the Aggressive Panhandling
Ordinance was originally enacted in 1991, the roll call training did not
exceed a fifteen minute lecture accompanied by a short hand-out. See Ex. N.
to Plaintiffs' Supplemental Brief in Support of Motion for Preliminary
Injunction; Johnson Dep. at 36. Although the officers deposed during
expedited discovery exhibited some common sense understanding about dealing
with the type of conduct prohibited under the ordinances at issue, they
were unable to describe or discern with any precision the legal parameters
of the laws they are charged with enforcing. See Johnson Dep. at 27-29;
Weaver Dep. at 27; McFarland Dep. at 49-53; Humes Dep. at 22-25, 35.
Furthermore, despite the fact that the current Parked Vehicle Ordinance
requires particularized conduct beyond merely loitering or prowling in a
parking lot, the evidence suggests that police officers have arrested nine
individuals for simply loitering under this ordinance in May and June 1996;
see Ex. L. Each of these nine citations, however, was subsequently
dismissed by the municipal court. Id.  </P>


<P>III. DISCUSSION</P>

<P>This matter is not before the court at this time for a final adjudication
on the merits. Neither side is yet prepared for that, and much may change
based on further investigation and because of what is said herein. The
court has only been asked to grant preliminary relief. In order to succeed
on their motion for preliminary injunction, Plaintiffs must show: (1) a
substantial likelihood of success on the merits; (2) that they will suffer
irreparable injury if the injunction is not granted; (3) that the injury
which would occur in the absence of the injunction outweighs the injury
caused to Defendants due to the injunction; and (4) that the injunction is
in the public interest. Church v. City of Huntsville, 30 F.3d 1332, 1342
(11th Cir. 1994). As to the issues for which the parties have standing, the
court believes that Plaintiffs have satisfied their burden of showing
irreparable injury in the absence of a preliminary injunction that
outweighs any burden that would be imposed upon Defendants, and that the
injunction serves the public interest. Accordingly, the court will focus
its analysis upon whether Plaintiffs have a substantial likelihood to
succeed on the merits of their claims to warrant a preliminary injunction  </P>


<P>A. THE AGGRESSIVE PANHANDLING ORDINANCE4  </P>

<P>In December 1995, the Atlanta City Council adopted and the Mayor approved
Chapter 106, Offenses and Misdemeanors, Section 106-85, which addresses
"begging and soliciting alms by accosting or forcing oneself upon the
company of another." In an attempt to prohibit aggressive panhandling, the
ordinance states:  </P>


<P>[i]t shall be unlawful for any person to ask, beg or solicit alms, which
include money or other things of value, or exhibit oneself for the purpose
of begging or soliciting alms by:  </P>

<P>(1) Accosting another; or
(2) Forcing oneself upon the company of another.  </P>

<P>Section 106-85(c). According to the definitional section of the ordinance,
"accosting" means "approaching or speaking to someone in such a manner as
would cause a reasonable person to fear imminent bodily harm or the
commission of a criminal act upon such person's person, or upon property in
such person's immediate possession." Section 106-85(a). "Forcing oneself
upon the company of another" is defined as "continuing to request, beg or
solicit alms in close proximity to the individual addressed after the
person to whom the request is directed has made a negative response,
blocking the passage of the individual addressed or otherwise engaging in
conduct which could reasonably be construed as intended to compel or force
a person to accede to demands." Section 106-85(a).  </P>

<P>Challenging the facial constitutionality of this ordinance, Plaintiffs
argue that the Aggressive Panhandling Ordinance prohibits protected speech
in a public forum in violation of the First Amendment and the Equal
Protection Clause. Defendants have asserted that the challenges are without
merit because the ordinance does not regulate protected speech, but rather
prohibits a particularized sort of conduct occurring in the context of
panhandling. Alternatively, if the court concludes that the ordinance does
regulate speech, Defendants argue that the ordinance presents a valid time,
place or manner regulation that passes constitutional muster.  </P>

<P>The parties have not contested whether begging or panhandling is a
recognized form of protected speech under the First Amendment.5 Assuming
arguendo that simple begging constitutes protected expression,6 the First
Amendment does allow reasonable regulations of the time, place, and manner
of protected speech for regulations necessary to further significant
governmental interests. See Perry Educ. Ass'n v. Perry Local Educators'
Ass'n, 460 U.S. 37, 45 (1983). Notwithstanding the possibility of untrained
or erroneous enforcement of this ordinance, the language of the Aggressive
Panhandling Ordinance does not establish an outright ban on begging.
Indeed, begging is expressly permitted under the ordinance. Rather, the
city ordinance merely prohibits begging or panhandling through two
particular means: (1) accosting another person or (2) forcing oneself upon
another's company. Accordingly, this court views the ordinance as a
means-oriented restriction aimed at the secondary effects of particular
conduct associated with overly aggressive solicitation for alms. See e.g.
City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41, 46 (1986).  </P>

<P>In Renton, 475 U.S. 41 (1986), the Supreme Court upheld a zoning ordinance
prohibiting adult movie theaters that displayed adult films within 1000
feet of residences, churches or schools. Although the ordinance made a
distinction based upon the subject matter of the films being shown, the
Court held that the ordinance was content-neutral because its purpose was
to prevent the secondary effects that adult theaters had on the community,
including retail trade, property values, and the quality of urban life,
rather than the suppression of speech found within adult films. Id. at 48
(citations omitted). See also R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, 505 U.S. 377, 389
(1992)("since words can in some circumstances violate laws directed not
against speech but against conduct ..., a particular content-based
subcategory of proscribable class of speech can be swept up incidentally
within the reach of a statute directed at conduct rather than speech.") In
a similar vein, the court finds that the Aggressive Panhandling Ordinance
does not aim to prohibit any unwanted message of panhandlers, but rather to
address other significant secondary interests stemming from unruly conduct
that might accompany panhandling. See, e.g., Young v. New York City Transit
Auth., 903 F.2d 146, 158 (2d. Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 984 (1990)
(regulation of panhandling aimed at maintaining public safety and
preventing physical contact, harassment, intimidation, and threats that
persons associate with panhandling); see also Patton v. Baltimore City,
Civil No. S 93-2389 at 62-65 (D. Md. Aug. 19, 1994) (compelling state
interests including protection of citizens and visitors, promotion of
tourism and business, and preservation of the quality of urban life
supported aggressive panhandling ordinance). Furthermore, the Aggressive
Panhandling Ordinance by its terms only regulates panhandling to the extent
that the begging individual employs threatening or assault-like conduct to
force accession to his or her demands. Like many other valid statutes, this
ordinance is primarily directed at extortionate conduct. Thus, with one
exception discussed infra, the ordinance appears narrowly tailored to
address the significant interests while affording panhandlers ample
channels with which to communicate their message.  </P>

<P>As the parties discussed during the hearing before the undersigned, the
court finds troubling the definitional clause in Section 106-85(a) that
sets forth the proscribed conduct under the phrase "forcing oneself upon
the company of another." According to the ordinance, a person has violated
this provision by " continuing to request, beg or solicit alms in close
proximity to the individual addressed after the person to whom the request
is directed has made a negative response" or other actions that one might
reasonably construe as compelling accession to the requests. See Section
106-85(a) (emphasis added). According to Plaintiffs, this definition is
overbroad because it encompasses harmless solicitation. It restricts a
beggar from presenting his request to a new person in close proximity to
another who has refused him.  </P>

<P>As far as this court can ascertain, the sole interest or secondary effect
that this definitional phrase is designed to protect is the insulation of a
person who declines to give money from the act of begging. Begging is not a
"senseless act of beauty" and its message may be disquietening. Arguably,
one might contend that the City has also a substantial interest in
protecting whatever sense of peace and solitude its citizens can find in a
bustling city. Yet, it is well established that the public expression of
ideas may not be proscribed based upon the victimization, sensitivity or
other reactions of the listener. See, e.g., R.A. V. v. City of St. Paul,
505 U.S. 377, 394 (1992); Boos v. Barry, 485 U.S. 312, 318-21 (1988);
Street v. New York, 394 U.S. 576, 590-92 (1969).  </P>

<P>In Boos v. Barry, for example, the Court invalidated an ordinance that
prohibited the display of a sign that brought a foreign government into
"public disrepute" within 500 feet of a foreign embassy. Boos, 485 U.S. at
315. The Court rejected the need to shield foreign embassy officials from
speech that was critical of their government. Id. at 321. In that instance,
the ordinance was not a content-neutral regulation focusing upon the
"secondary effects" of speech, but rather targeted particular speech with
an emotive impact based upon its content. Id. Unlike the majority of the
Aggressive Panhandling Ordinance, which seeks to address harms independent
of the content of the panhandler's message, this definition based upon
continued requests in close proximity to a person indicating a negative
response bases its proscription upon the reaction of the listener to
content. While the court has no doubt that Defendants could reconstruct a
definition that would pass constitutional muster, this phrase as it now
stands, fails to survive constitutional scrutiny.  </P>

<P>Finally, Plaintiffs also raise an Equal Protection Clause challenge to the
Aggressive Panhandling Ordinance based upon the ordinance's
underinclusivity because the ordinance only regulates conduct based upon
solicitation for alms. The court finds this to be a distinction without
significance. In Renton, the respondents raised a similar contention that
the zoning ordinance at issue had not regulated other adult businesses that
were also likely to trigger the same secondary effects as those of the
regulated adult film theaters. See Renton, 475 U.S. at 52-53. The Supreme
Court rejected that argument on two fronts: (1) the record did not contain
any evidence regarding other adult businesses in the city, and (2) the
Court was unwilling to assume that the city would not amend its ordinance
to include other businesses with the same proscribed secondary effects. Id.
(citing Williamson v. Lee Optical, 348 U.S. 483, 488-89 (1955)). The record
before the court does not suggest the existence of problems with conduct
accompanying noncharitable solicitation. Thus, the fact that Defendants
have begun to regulate aggressive solicitation only in the context of
panhandling does not by itself suggest invidious discrimination against
panhandlers in violation of the Equal Protection Clause. See Williamson,
348 U.S. at 489.  </P>

<P>Pursuant to Section 1-10 of the Code of Ordinances of the City of Atlanta,
see Ex. 2 Attached to Defendants' Memorandum in Opposition to Plaintiffs'
Motion for Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction, the
unconstitutionality of one phrase of the Code shall not affect the validity
of the remaining portion of the Code. Accordingly, the motion for a
preliminary injunction enjoining the enforcement of the Aggressive
Panhandling Ordinance is GRANTED IN PART. The court, however, limits its
ruling to find that only the definition of "forcing oneself upon the
company of another" that prohibits "continuing to request, beg or solicit
alms in close proximity to the individual addressed after the person to
whom the request is directed has made a negative response" is
unconstitutional.  </P>


<P>B. THE PARKED VEHICLE ORDINANCE</P>

<P>In December 1995, the Atlanta City Council reenacted and the Mayor approved
Chapter 106, Article II, Offenses and Misdemeanors, Section 106-57, which
addresses "unauthorized persons on [a] parking lot." That ordinance
prohibited "any person to remain on any property which is used primarily as
a parking lot for vehicles unless such person has a vehicle parked on the
property, or is employed by the owner or manager of the property, or has
other lawful business on such property ...." On April 1, 1996, however, the
Atlanta City Council adopted in its place an amended section of the same
number entitled "Unauthorized Interference or Attempted Interference with
Parked Vehicles Ordinance (hereinafter "the Parked Vehicle Ordinance"). The
mayor approved this ordinance on April 9, 1996. This newly enacted
ordinance provides as follows:  </P>

<P>(a) It shall be unlawful for any person to loiter or prowl on any property
which is used to park vehicles, including parking lots for vehicles as set
out in the City of Atlanta Code of Ordinances, Chapter 30, Article XVII,
Division 3, Section 30-1196, et seq., and public right-of-way, if said
person has been observed:  </P>

<P>(1) attempting entry into vehicles, or</P>

<P>(2) tampering with the vehicle of another, which shall mean any
unauthorized interference with a vehicle or any part or accessory thereof
or any contents therein, or  </P>

<P>(3) otherwise acting in a manner not usual for law-abiding individuals
under circumstances that warrant justifiable and reasonable alarm or
immediate concern for the safety of persons or property in the vicinity  </P>

<P>(b) Among the circumstances which may be considered in determining whether
alarm is warranted is the fact that the person opens or attempts to open
the doors, trunk windows or hood of the vehicle; takes flight upon the
appearance of a law enforcement officer; manifestly endeavors to conceal
himself or any object that may be utilized for entry into an automobile or
is otherwise prohibited by law; removes or attempts to remove anything of
value from the vehicle; or otherwise causes damage to the vehicle.  </P>

<P>(c) A law enforcement officer shall, prior to any arrest for an offense
under this code section, afford the person an opportunity to dispel any
alarm or immediate concern which would otherwise be warranted by requesting
the person to identify himself and explain his presence and conduct. No
person shall be convicted of an offense under this code section:  </P>

<P>(i) unless the law enforcement officer complies with the foregoing
procedure; and (ii) unless the trier of fact determines beyond a reasonable
doubt under all circumstances of the case that the explanation was not true
or would not, if believed by the officer at the time, have dispelled the
officer's alarm or immediate concern.  </P>

<P>(d) Upon conviction of violation of this section, a person shall be
sentenced to imprisonment or public work for six (6) months, with a minimum
of sixty (60) days to serve in the city jail or working on the public
streets or on the public works of the city, the remainder of the time to be
prohibited.  </P>

<P>Section 106-57.</P>

<P>Plaintiffs assert that the Parked Vehicle Ordinance is unconstitutionally
vague. Defendants argue that Plaintiffs do not have standing to challenge
the current embodiment of the ordinance since no Plaintiff has been
arrested under it. Plaintiffs contend, however, that the arrests they have
suffered under the older version and fear that they will endure under the
new one bestow this court with jurisdiction to entertain their claim.  </P>

<P>Article III of the Constitution provides that "[t]he judicial Power shall
extend to all Cases . . . [and] Controversies." U.S. Constit. art. III,
Section 2. The "case or controversy" requirement mandates that, "at an
irreducible minimum, . . . the party who invokes the court's jurisdiction ;
. . [must] 'show that he personally has suffered some actual or threatened
injury as a result of the putatively illegal conduct of the defendant."'
Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for Separation of Church
and State, 454 U.S. 464, 472 (1982) (quoting Gladstone, Realtors v. Village
of Bellwood, 441 U.S. 91, 99 (1979)). While standing does not require that
parties expose themselves to prosecution, Steffel v. Thompson, 415 U.S.
452, 459 (1974), there must be an announced intention to engage in
violative conduct as well as a "credible threat of prosecution." Babbitt v.
United Farm Workers Nat'l Union, 442 U.S. 289, 298 (1979); Athens Lumber
Co., Inc. v. Federal Election Comm'n, 689 F.2d 1006, 1012 (11th Cir. 1982),
vacated on other grounds, 718 F.2d 363 (11th Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 465
U.S. 1092 (1984). The court will not have jurisdiction in situations where
the threat of enforcement of the statute is only "imaginary or
speculative." Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37, 42 (1971).  </P>

<P>What constitutes a "credible threat of prosecution" has been the subject of
much analysis. In Doe v. Bolton, 410 U.S. 179, 188 (1973), the Supreme
Court held that physicians who performed abortions could challenge the
validity of the Georgia abortion statutes even though none of them had been
prosecuted or threatened with prosecution since the doctors were the ones
"against whom these criminal statutes directly operate[d]." In Graham v.
Butterworth, 5 F.3d 496, 499 (11th Cir. 1993), cert. denied, _ U.S. _, 114
S. Ct. 2136 (1994), a county court judge had standing to contest a Florida
election statute regulating payments for sponsored advertisements even
though he had not been prosecuted under it. The judge had violated the
provision in the prior election and intended to engage in the same behavior
during the coming one. Id. In Planned Parenthood Ass'n v. City of
Cincinnati, 822 F.2d 1390, 1396 (6th Cir. 1987), the Sixth Circuit held
that an abortion clinic had standing to contest a statute regulating the
disposal of fetal tissue because, even though it had not suffered
prosecution for a violation, the organization had announced its intention
to engage in the prohibited conduct. In all of these cases, the plaintiffs
were engaged in a course of established behavior that, while otherwise
legitimate, had become regulated by criminal statutes or malum prohibitum.7
</P> 

<P>In City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95 (1983), however, the Supreme
Court found that it would be improper to grant a preliminary injunction to
a plaintiff who was injured after being placed in a chokehold by a police
officer following a stop for a traffic or vehicle code violation. The Court
held that the plaintiff did not have the requisite standing because there
was no "real and immediate threat" that the plaintiff would again be
stopped for such an infraction, that the plaintiff would neither provoke
the officers nor resist, and that the police would apply the very dangerous
subduction technique. Id. at 105. It appears to this court that the Supreme
Court refused to assume that the recurrence of conduct that was malum in se
was inevitable. Accordingly, a "credible threat of prosecution" did not
exist.  </P>

<P>The illegal behavior at issue in the instant case -- attempting entry into
vehicles, tampering with vehicles, and "acting in a manner not usual for
law-abiding individuals under circumstances that warrant a justifiable and
reasonable alarm or immediate concern for the safety of persons or property
in the vicinity" -- is malum in se. Accordingly, this court finds that the
facts of the instant case are more closely analogous to those in Lyons and
will refuse to assume that future violations of the Parked Vehicle
Ordinance are inevitable. This conclusion is bolstered by the evidence in
the record that, of all of the arrests of the seven plaintiffs, none has
been for violations of the current version of the ordinance and only two
have occurred under the former embodiment. The dearth of prosecutions
demonstrates to this court that there in no great likihood[sic] that any of
the plaintiffs will be arrested for a violation of any portion of the
ordinance that, abstractly, might be troublesome.8 The court must conclude,
therefore, that Plaintiffs do not have standing to assert a constitutional
challenge to the Parked Vehicle Ordinance.9  </P>


<P>C. 42 U.S.C. Section 1983 VIOLATIONS BASED UPON THE CUSTOM, PRACTICE. OR
POLICY OF THE CITY OF ATLANTA  </P>

<P>Plaintiffs allege that Defendants are liable pursuant to 42 U.S.C. Section
1983 for depriving Plaintiffs of their constitutional rights based upon two
theories: (1) Defendants' persistent practice of violating the
constitutional rights of Plaintiffs and other homeless persons, and (2)
Defendants' inadequate training of police officers. To establish liability
under Section 1983, Plaintiffs must show that Defendants had a policy,
custom or widespread practice that is the "moving force" behind the
constitutional deprivations. Brooks v. Scheib, 813 F.2d 1191, 1193 (11th
Cir. 1987) (citing Monell v. Department of Social Servs., 436 U.S. 658,
690-94 (1978)); see also DePew v. City of St. Mary's, 787 F.2d 1496, 1499
(11th Cir. 1986). Although the official policy-makers of the municipality
need not formally approve the "custom" in order for liability to attach,
Church v. City of Huntsville, 30 F.3d 1332, 1342-43 (11th Cir. 1994),
"actual or constructive knowledge of such customs must be attributed to the
governing body of the municipality." Id. at 1345 (citing Depew, 787 F.2d at
1499).  </P>

<P>As for Plaintiffs' first theory of liability, this court is satisfied that
Plaintiffs have produced sufficient evidence at this stage of the
proceedings to demonstrate that a number of officers have effectuated
arrests of the homeless without probable cause in violation of Plaintiffs'
Fourth Amendment rights. Yet, as discussed below, this court cannot
determine that the City of Atlanta had knowledge of such a custom in order
to grant the relief now sought.  </P>

<P>In Depew v. City of St. Mary's, 787 F.2d 1496 (11th Cir. 1986), a civil
rights action based upon the use of excessive force, the plaintiffs
introduced evidence of two prior specific incidents in which citizens filed
complaints of police brutality. Id. at 1497-98. Although individual council
members admitted that they were aware of these incidents and that some
investigations had ensued, the evidence showed that the mayor and council
members largely discounted the alleged victims' complaints, denied
allegations of impropriety, and affirmed the actions of the officers
involved. Id. Thus, the Eleventh Circuit determined that the city had
knowledge of improper conduct in which police officers had used
unreasonable force, but did not take any remedial action. Id. at 1499.  </P>

<P>In contrast, the four homeless witnesses in the Church case provided
testimony concerning expulsion of the homeless from public parks, arrests
for public intoxication, and other alleged police harassment that had
occurred over several years. See Church, 30 F.3d at 1345-46. The plaintiffs
recounted few of the incidents with specific detail. Id. at 1345. The
plaintiffs also relied upon a two-year-old demographic study instituted
from within the police department that generally outlined "rousting" of the
homeless by the City of Huntsville police. Id. Amidst doubts that the
evidence supported a finding that the defendants had a custom of
constitutional violations, the Eleventh Circuit concluded that plaintiffs
had failed to present evidence that the City Council or Mayor had actual or
constructive specific knowledge of the incidents involving the homeless
witnesses. Id. at 1346.  </P>

<P>The evidence in the case at bar pales in comparison to the records
developed in Depew and Church. The limited discovery did reveal that a
number of leading city officials, including Mayor Campbell and Police Chief
Harvard, were on notice of general allegations of police harassment and
fear of the homeless regarding police misconduct and homeless sweeps. In
addition, Chief of the Department of Corrections Pocock was aware that the
arrest statistics for homeless persons had vastly increased in 1995. After
conducting his own inquiry, Pocock discussed his findings with Sue Ellen
Crosslea, the Director of the Bureau of Human Services. However, the record
is devoid of evidence that these officials had knowledge of specific
instances of present or past police misconduct that suggested police
officers were violating Fourth Amendment rights. Based upon this circuit's
authority, Plaintiffs cannot rest upon the fact that Defendants were aware
of generalized allegations of homeless sweeps or of police misconduct in
order to attribute constructive knowledge of the alleged constitutional
violations. See also Brooks v. Scheib, 813 F.2d 1191, 1193 (11th Cir. 1987)
(no evidence of knowledge of past police misconduct where plaintiff failed
to show numerous complaints lodged alleging police misconduct had merit).  </P>

<P>Plaintiffs also claim that Defendants are liable for failing to provide
adequate training to their police officers. To establish liability under
this theory, Plaintiffs must show that the City failed to train their
officers in the execution of their duties, and that this failure
constituted a city policy. Kerr v. City of West Palm Beach, 875 F.2d 1546,
1555 (11th Cir. 1989) (citing City of Canton v. Harris, 489 U.S. 378, 388
(1989)). In order to constitute a policy, the City's failure to provide
more or different training under the circumstances must demonstrate a
"deliberate indifference" to the rights of its citizens. Canton, 489 U. S.
at 388; Kerr, 875 F.2d at 1555. Although a review of the record clearly
supports a finding of negligence on the part of the City of Atlanta in the
level of training provided in regard to the treatment of the homeless and
the ordinances at issue, the court cannot determine that the City's failure
to train amounts to "deliberate indifference" based upon the record as
developed.  </P>

<P>"Deliberate indifference" exists when the need for additional or different
training becomes obvious based upon apparent unconstitutional actions or
abuses occurring in its absence. See Belcher v. City of Foley, 30 F.3d
1390, 1397 (11th Cir. 1994) (citing Canton, 489 U.S. at 390). For example,
in Kerr v. City of West Palm Beach, 875 F.2d 1546 (11th Cir. 1989), a case
involving the use of excessive force during the apprehension of suspects
with a canine unit, the evidence revealed that not only were suspects
frequently injured during apprehension, but also that officers filed
reports whenever a dog bite occurred which supervisory officials then
reviewed. Id. at 1556. Based upon this evidence, the Eleventh Circuit
vacated a judgment n.o.v. and determined that the whole of the evidence
demonstrated that "the unconstitutional character of many of the canine
unit's apprehensions was plainly obvious to City officials." Id.  </P>

<P>As indicated above, the facts and evidence in the instant case do not make
it clear that the need for training was readily apparent to City
Defendants. The essence of the allegation underlying this Section 1983
claim is that Defendants have a custom in which officers frisk, detain and
effectuate arrests of the homeless without probable cause or reasonable
suspicion in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Yet, at most, Defendants
were aware of only generalized reports of police misconduct or homeless
sweeps. There is no evidence in the record that any homeless person
including Plaintiffs or advocates on behalf of the homeless initiated a
formal or informal complaint or provided more specific information that
might have informed city officials that police officers had exceeded their
constitutional authority in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Had it been
shown that the Mayor had been faced with the Plaintiffs' affidavits or the
one hundred sixty-one declarations that were submitted to this court, the
court very likely would reach a different conclusion. In the absence of
evidence of particular allegations that officers had violated the Fourth
Amendment rights, however, the court cannot infer that the need for greater
training in this area of the law was obvious to city officials.  </P>

<P>Plaintiffs met their burden in producing uncontested evidence demonstrating
that a number of officers have effectuated arrests of the homeless without
probable cause in violation of Plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment rights. Based
upon the record developed, including over one hundred declarations of the
homeless and the unrebutted incidents outlined in Plaintiffs' affidavits,
it is clear that city officials have received sufficient notice of these
events in order to establish a custom in the future. However, because this
court cannot determine that the City of Atlanta had sufficient knowledge of
such a custom in order to grant the relief now sought, Plaintiffs' motion
for a preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin Defendants from encroaching
upon the Fourth Amendment rights of Plaintiffs is DENIED.  </P>


<P>IV. CONCLUSION</P>

<P>For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction
is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.  </P>

<P>SO ORDERED this 17th day of July, 1996.</P>

<P>/s/<BR>
J. OWEN FORRESTER<BR>
UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE</P>


<P><B>ENDNOTES</B></P>

<FONT SIZE="-1"><P>1. Throughout this order the court refers to the class of citizens as
"homeless," but the plaintiffs acknowledge that the group includes the
homeless, the poor, the shabbily dressed street person who may have
shelter, and even professional panhandlers.  </P>

<P>2. For example, the Chief of the Department of Corrections, Tom Pocock,
indicated that the reports "that an inordinate number" of homeless persons
were imprisoned caused him to track the record of homeless arrests that
occurred in 1995. Pocock Dep. at 36-37. Pocock shared the results of his
tracking with Sue Ellen Crosslea, the Director of the Bureau of Human
Services. Id. at 37; see also Memorandum to Sue Ellen Crosslea, Attached to
Pocock Dep. 10  </P>

<P>3. At the hearing on July 11, 1996, the court granted Defendants' request
to submit full copies of the original depositions, which the parties
conducted during the expedited discovery and upon which both parties relied
in their briefs in support of and opposition to this motion. Accordingly,
Defendants delivered these materials on the morning of Monday, July 15,
1996. Defendants, however, have also provided the court with other
materials that they represent as omitted from the record, discussed during
the depositions, or otherwise relevant to the matters now before the court.
As the court has indicated previously, the record was closed at the start
of the hearing on July 11, 1996. Thus, to the extent that Defendants are
seeking leave to submit additional material in opposition to this motion,
Defendants' request is DENIED.  </P>

<P>4. In their brief in support of their motion for a temporary restraining
order and preliminary injunction, Plaintiffs had cited to the Aggressive
Panhandling Ordinance as Chapter 3, Section 17-3006. See Ex. 22 to
Defendants' Memorandum in Opposition to Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary
Injunction. That ordinance also prohibited begging and soliciting alms by
accosting or forcing oneself upon the company of another. Id. During the
initial hearing on June 16, 1996, however, the parties clarified that
Section 17-3006, which the City Council and the Mayor adopted and approved
in July 1977, was the predecessor of the current ordinance. Thus, although
the substantive language of the ordinance at issue remains essentially
unaltered, the Aggressive Panhandling Ordinance currently in effect is
found at Chapter 106 Offenses and Misdemeanors, Section 106-85.  </P>

<P>5. See Young v. New York City Transit Auth., 903 F.2d 146, 153-54 (2d.
Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 984 (1990); but see, Loper v. New York City
Police Dept., 999 F.2d 699, 704 (2d Cir. 1993).  </P>

<P>6. See, e.g., Village of Schaumberg v. Citizens for a Better Environment,
444 U.S. 620, 644 (1980) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting)("I believe that a
simple request for money lies far from the core protections of the First
Amendment...."). If begging is protected, it is most likely that it is as
commercial speech.  </P>

<P>7. Courts have also applied this rationale when a police custom or
practice, rather than a criminal statute, is being challenged. In Church v.
City of Huntsville, 30 F.3d 1332, 1337-39 (11th Cir. 1994), the Eleventh
Circuit found that the plaintiffs had standing to seek injunctive relief
against the city for its alleged practice of arresting and harassing the
plaintiffs on the basis of their homeless status. The arrests were for
eating, sleeping, and bathing in public and, as such, were attempting to
regulate behavior that was, at most, malum prohibitum.  </P>

<P>8. At the hearing for the preliminary injunction, this court announced
that, if Plaintiffs were to establish standing to contest the Parked
Vehicle Ordinance, the court would hold Section 106-57(a)(3)
unconstitutionally vague due to its failure to provide adequate notice to
ordinary persons as to what behavior would result in a violation.
Additionally, the court would have followed the rationale of Fields v. City
of Omaha, 810 F.2d 830, 832-34 (8th Cir. 1987), wherein the Eighth Circuit
ruled that a statute with a provision similar to that contained in section
106-57(c) was void for vagueness due to its failure to provide standards to
guide the discretion of police officers and prevent "arbitrary and
discriminatory law enforcement."  </P>

<P>9. Plaintiffs' argument that the two arrests under the predecessor statute
confers standing does not alter this conclusion. Plaintiffs cited to
Leverett v. City of Pinellas Park, 775 F.2d 1536, 1539 (11th Cir. 1985),
wherein the Eleventh Circuit held that Plaintiffs who had been arrested and
prosecuted under the earlier versions of the criminal ordinance restricting
nude dancing in commercial establishments where food and alcohol were
served had standing to challenge the current statute. Leverett can be
distinguished from the instant case for the same reason discussed supra --
that standing exists when the parties intend to continue a course of
conduct that is malum prohibitum but not for violations that are malum in
se. In Leverett, the regulated activities were merely malum prohibitum
while those in the instant case are malum in se. Accordingly, Leverett is
inapposite to the standing inquiry before the court.  </P>

<P><B>"City Assigns Times, Places to Demonstrate" </B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1">By Lolita Browning, Staff Reporter</FONT></B><BR>

<P>Planning to stage a protest when the world visits Atlanta during the
Olympics? Please take a number. </P>

<P>As a security measure, the Atlanta Police Department is assigning sites and
times for protesters, who must submit permit applications to the police
department, says Police Chief Beverly Harvard. </P>

<P>"The city wants to accommodate the First Amendment needs of the people that
come into the city," says Robin J. Shahar, an assistant city attorney
working with law enforcement officials. </P>

<P>While people have the right to protest, says Senior Assistant City Attorney
Kendric E. Smith, the city has the right to regulate them as to the time,
manner and place. </P>

<P>"The idea was to get the sites at the places we thought people wanted to
be," he says. </P>

<P>If you want to watch a demonstration, here are the venues: </P>

<P>l Techwood Drive at 10th Street, west of Interstate 75/85, on the northeast
corner, west of the median (Olympic venue). </P>

<P>l Northside Drive and Marietta Street, on the grass where Northside and
Marietta intersect (aquatics venue site). </P>

<P>#l Rhodes Street at Northside Drive between Electric and Northside (Georgia
Dome). </P>

<P>#l Techwood Drive north of Marietta Street between Walton and International
(Centennial Park site). </P>

<P>l Greensferry and Lee Street, at the intersection away from MLK Chapel side
(Atlanta University Center). </P>

<P>l Martin Luther King Jr. Drive and Tatnell Street, on the Morris Brown
College side, away from the Phyllis Wheatley YWCA (Clark Atlanta
University). </P>

<P>l Capitol Avenue and the Interstate 20 east access road (stadium venue
sites and the pedestrian corridor). </P>

<P>So far a handful of organizations have submitted applications, says Atlanta
Police Sgt. Gerrick R. Roper, of the department's Olympic Planning Office.
In addition, the office has received five inquires about the procedures,
Roper says. </P>

<P>A similar plan was enforced during the Democratic National Convention in
1988. The city roped off a parking lot at Marietta Street and Techwood
Drive across from the CNN Center, notes Smith. A stage was set up with a
sound system, and water was provided, he recalls. </P>

<P>"The protesters had permits for specified time periods, and when their time
was up, the sound was cut off," he says, adding that the plan ran smoothly.</P>


<P>But with far more people coming, Smith says, more sites are needed. </P>

<P><H3>More People, More Problems?</H3></P>

<P>"The two events are very different," he says. "The scale of the Olympics
... is far greater than that of the Democratic Convention. The Olympics
brings huge volumes of people, making it more difficult to control." </P>

<P>In itself, the city's policy does not bother the attorney for at least one
advocacy group that defends First Amendment rights. Gerald R. Weber,
counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union of Georgia, says designating
specific sites "makes sense." </P>

<P>"Logistically, it's going to be easier for the demonstrators and the city,"
Weber says. </P>

<P>But Weber says the city has not given demonstrators enough room at the
sites. He says he is concerned that some demonstrators will not fit within
the designated boundaries. He says ACLU members will observe protests to
see that everything is done properly. And he says people should not be
prohibited from expressing opinions in parks or on streets as long as they
don't interfere with traffic. </P>

<P>The city has not indicated what it plans to do to groups protesting in
nondesignated areas. Smith says it depends on the incident. Anyone can
leaflet on the sidewalks, he says. </P>

<P>"This procedure is for someone who wants to hold a demonstration," he says.
"It's not intended to cover everything in the city of Atlanta as it relates
to the First Amendment." </P>

<P>Protesters will not be allowed to demonstrate in streets that are not
blocked off specifically for demonstrators, Smith says. </P>

<P>And whoever has the permit for a particular spot has to be there with the
permit representing the group, he adds. </P>

<P><H3>Limited Time Offer</H3></P>

<P>Officer Roper says the city will not let any group monopolize a site for
long. Interviews with the heads of two organizations provide illustrations.</P>


<P>Dr. Scott Noren of Kansas City, Mo., is one applicant. A resident in oral
and maxillofacial surgery, Noren plans to have 200 participants promoting
powerlifting as an Olympic sporting event on July 20, the first Saturday of
the Games. </P>

<P>At first he wanted the entire four hours from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. At first the
city offered him an hour. They compromised on 3 p.m. to 4 p.m. and 5 p.m.
to 6 p.m. </P>

<P>Robert P. Kunst, president of Shalom International, a Jewish organization,
asked to protest from July 18 to 21 from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. in front of the
Georgia World Congress Center. </P>

<P>But Kunst, of Miami, Fla. has been assigned to July 18 and 19 from noon to
2 p.m., he says. </P>

<P>"They seem to be limiting it to certain times and certain people," he says.
"As a First Amendment issue, I don't think there should be a limitation. If
I have the strength to stand in the hot sun and dehydrate to protest, that
is my First Amendment right. </P>

<P>"People should be allowed to be there as long a they want to be there." </P>

<P>But he says he understands the security issues involved. </P>

<P>"I don't want to make life more complicated. I would prefer to have four
days, but I am satisfied with the two," he says. </P>

<P>Kunst's group will be demonstrating against two corporate sponsors of the
Olympics: BMW/Mercedes and McDonald's. He claims BMW used people as "slave
laborers" in its shops during World War II and now refuses to compensate
the survivors. And he claims that the 1995 opening of a McDonald's
restaurant across from the Dachau concentration camp in Germany is
insensitive. </P>

<P>In response to the claims against the German manufacturer, Thomas O.
McGurin, general manager of corporate relations for BMW, says, "BMW was
nationalized during the war. So the use of slave labor wasn't a corporate
decision. It was a decision made by the German government. </P>

<P>"I think BMW should be judged on what it has done during the postwar period
rather than during the war," McGurin says, noting the corporation's
investments in the former eastern zones. </P>

<P>No one from McDonald's returned a call for comment.   </P>

<P>On May 17, 1995, the United States Senate, by a vote of 96-3, adopted
Senate Resolution 120, which established the Special Committee to Investigate
Whitewater Development Corporation and Related Matters (hereinafter the "Special
Committee"), to be administered by the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban
Affairs (the "Banking Committee").  Resolution 120 charged the Special Committee
with the responsibility to conduct an extensive investigation into and to hold
public hearings on specified matters relating to the President's and Mrs.
Clinton's investment in Whitewater Development Corporation ("Whitewater") along
with James and Susan McDougal, Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan Association
("Madison Guaranty"), and related matters.  
<P>In discharging its responsibilities under Resolution 120, the Special
Committee deposed 274 witnesses and held 60 days of public hearings, during
which 136 witnesses testified.  The Committee also reviewed approximately 1
million pages of documents produced by the President and Mrs. Clinton, the White
House, various federal agencies, and a number of individual witnesses.
<P>Resolution 120 authorized the Committee to investigate and to hold public
hearings into three general subject areas.  Section 1(b)(1) authorized
investigation into whether White House officials engaged in improper conduct in
handling papers in Deputy White House Counsel Vincent Foster's office following
his death on July 20, 1993--the so-called Foster Phase of the Special
Committee's inquiry.
<P> With respect to the Washington Phase of the inquiry, Section 1(b)(2)
authorized investigation into whether the White House improperly interfered with
any investigations or prosecutions by various federal agencies relating to,
among other things, Whitewater, Madison Guaranty related entities, and Capital
Management Services, Inc. ("CMS").
<P>Finally, in the Arkansas Phase, &#167; 1(b)(3) of Resolution 120 authorized the
Special Committee to investigate, among other things, the activities of
Whitewater, Madison Guaranty, CMS, Lasater & Co., and the work and billing
practices of the Rose Law Firm relating to Madison Guaranty.
1.<P>The Foster Phase.
<P>During the 103d Congress, the Banking Committee, pursuant to Senate
Resolution 229, conducted an inquiry into the cause of Mr. Foster's death and
the conduct of the subsequent investigation of his death by the United States
Park Police.  On July 15, 1994, Special Counsel Robert B. Fiske, Jr. advised the
Banking Committee that "public hearings on the subject of the handling of
documents in Mr. Foster's office while this investigation is continuing could
prejudice our investigation."1  Accordingly, the Banking Committee's public
hearings on July 29, 1994 into the cause of Mr. Foster's death excluded inquiry
into the handling of documents in Mr. Foster's office.
<P>At the conclusion of the Banking Committee's hearings in the summer of
1994, the  following matters, among others, were identified for future inquiry
relating to Mr. Foster's death:
<P>*<P>the White House interference into the Park Police search of Mr.
Foster's office;

<P>*<P>the presence of White House counsel staff during standard Park Police
investigatory interviews;

<P>*<P>the White House insistence that the Park Police investigation proceed
with Department of Justice involvement to the extent that DOJ was "calling the
shots" and "setting up protocol" and the Park Police were "stand[ing] and
waiting for permission to do our job"; and

<P>*<P>the late delivery of the note in Mr. Foster's office to Park Police,
discovered by White House counsel.2
<P>On April 22, 1995, Independent Counsel Kenneth W. Starr advised the
Chairman and Ranking Member of the Banking Committee that his investigation
would not be hindered or impeded by a Senate inquiry into the way in which White
House officials handled documents in Mr. Foster's office following his death.
<P>Accordingly, the Special Committee commenced its investigation and public
hearings into whether White House officials engaged in improper conduct in
handling documents in Mr. Foster's office at the time of his death.  The Special
Committee recognizes that Mr. Foster's death remains a source of much grief to
his family and friends.  In conducting its inquiry under section 1(b)(1) of
Resolution 120, the Committee sought to balance carefully the need to protect
the privacy of the Foster family and its duty to carry out fully the mandate of
the Senate.
2.<P>The Washington Phase.
<P>Resolution 120 directed the Special Committee to review the handling of
several federal investigations relating to the Whitewater real estate venture;
Madison Guaranty McDougal's S&L, the failure of which cost American taxpayers
more than $60 million; and CMS, a small business investment company owned by
David Hale, who made illegal loans to James and Susan McDougal in part to
finance the Whitewater investment.  Specifically, section 1(b)(2) of the
Resolution authorized the Special Committee to conduct an investigation and
public hearings into the following matters:
<P>(A)<P>whether any person has improperly handled confidential Resolution
Trust Corporation ("RTC") information relating to Madison Guaranty or
Whitewater, including whether any person has improperly communicated such
information to individuals referenced therein;

<P>(B)<P>whether the White House has engaged in improper contacts with any
other agency or department in the Government with regard to confidential RTC
information relating to Madison Guaranty or Whitewater;

<P>(C)<P>whether the Department of Justice has improperly handled RTC
criminal referrals relating to Madison Guaranty or Whitewater;

<P>(D)<P>whether RTC employees have been improperly importuned, prevented,
restrained, or deterred in conducting investigations or making enforcement
recommendations relating to Madison Guaranty or Whitewater; and

<P>(E)<P>whether the report issued by the Office of Government Ethics on
July 31, 1994, or related transcripts of deposition testimony --

<P><P>(i)  were improperly released to White House officials or others prior
to their testimony before the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs
pursuant to Senate Resolution 229 (103d Congress); or

<P><P>(ii)  were used to communicate to White House officials or to others
confidential RTC information relating to Madison Guaranty or Whitewater.3
<P>In conducting the inquiry mandated during this so-called "Washington Phase"
of the investigation, the Special Committee examined whether the President and
Mrs. Clinton -- or their agents -- misused the power of the presidency in
responding to a series of investigations of the Whitewater matter.  As in the
past, the Senate sought to serve as the public's watchdog, to expose abuses of
the public trust. 
<P>Of necessity, the Special Committee inquired into the investigative and
prosecutorial processes of Executive Branch agencies to determine whether the
laws were properly and faithfully executed.  Congress has a duty to investigate
allegations that the normal investigative and prosecutorial processes of the
Executive Branch have been compromised.4  More important, Congress has the
constitutional obligation to ensure that the President's private interests have
not been elevated above the public good.

3.<P>The Arkansas Phase.
<P>This is the beginning of the Whitewater matter.  In this phase of its
inquiry, the Senate charged the Special Committee with investigating the complex
web of intermingled funds, fraudulent transactions, political favors, and
conflicted relationships which comprise the "20 years of public life in
Arkansas" that Mrs. Clinton did not want an independent counsel, among others,
to look into.5
<P>Specifically, Section 1(b)(3) of Resolution 120 authorized an investigation
and public hearings into the following matters:
<P><P>(A)  the operations, solvency, and regulation of Madison Guaranty
Savings & Loan Association, and any subsidiary, affiliate, or other entity owned
or controlled by Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan Association;

<P><P>(B)  the activities, investments, and tax liability of Whitewater
Development Corporation and, as related to Whitewater Development Corporation,
of its officers, directors, and shareholders;

<P><P>(C)  the policies and practices of the RTC and the Federal banking
agencies (as that term is defined in section 3 of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Act) regarding the legal representation of such agencies with respect to Madison
Guaranty Savings and Loan Association;

<P><P>(D)  the handling by the RTC, the Office of Thrift Supervision, the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Federal Savings and Loan
Insurance Corporation of civil or administrative actions against parties
regarding Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan Association.

<P><P>(E)  the sources of funding and the lending practices of Capital
Management Services, Inc., and its supervision and regulation by the Small
Business Administration, including any alleged diversion of funds to Whitewater
Development Corporation;

<P><P>(F)  the bond underwriting contracts between Arkansas Development
Finance Authority and Lasater & Company; and 

<P><P>(G)  the lending activities of Perry County Bank, Perryville,
Arkansas, in connection with the 1990 Arkansas gubernatorial election.
<P>These various subjects, seemingly disparate, are nevertheless woven
together by common and recurring themes of abuse of power, fraud on federal
institutions and theft of public funds, and frequent neglect, if not deliberate
disregard, of professional, ethical, and, at times, legal standards.
<P>*  *  *
<P>The Special Committee completed its task under Resolution 120 in a
bipartisan manner.  With few notable exceptions, the Special Committee conducted
its investigation and public hearings by mutual consent between the Chairman and
Ranking Member, thus obviating the need for votes by the Special Committee.
<P>Because the testimony of witnesses before the Special Committee was often
contradictory, incomplete, or inaccurate as to important events and actions, the
Committee placed particular emphasis on available documentary evidence. 
Unfortunately, throughout its inquiry, the Committee was hindered by parties
unduly delaying the production of, or withholding outright, documents critical
to its investigation.  Although the White House was most often and most notably
engaged in this course of action, the pattern of noncooperation extended to
other parties, as this Report lays out more fully in the Washington Phase of the
Special Committee's inquiry.
<P>This Report of the Special Committee is divided into three separate but
interrelated parts.  Part 1 focusses on the Foster Phase of the inquiry, into
whether White House officials engaged in improper conduct in the handling of
documents in Mr. Foster's office at the time of his death.  Part 2 summarizes
the Special Committee's investigation into the Washington Phase and discusses
the handling of federal investigations into Whitewater and related matters, the
Administration's attempts to interfere with these investigations, and the White
House's attempts to interfere with Congressional inquiries into the
Administration's alleged improprieties.  Part 3 centers on the Arkansas Phase
and details the transactions and activities that comprise Governor Clinton's web
of political, personal, and business relationships--a web that includes, among
others, Whitewater, Madison, CMS, James McDougal, David Hale, and Danny Ray
Lasater.  Each Part begins with a separate, detailed outline and concludes with
respective endnotes.
<P>These three parts are interrelated because the entire story of Whitewater
is not simply the sum of its parts.  Rather, seeping through the pages that
follow are clearly identifiable patterns of motivation, conduct, and, at times,
concealment.  Beyond discrete judgments of impropriety in particular instances,
therefore, the Special Committee has examined the evidence and reached
conclusions that transcend any individual persons, actions, or events but rather
illuminate patterns of conduct behind the Whitewater affair.
<P>The Conclusions of the Special Committee are summarized at the beginning of
each Part.  They do not answer all questions and allegations that have surfaced,
but, taken together, they provide a comprehensive survey of the facts uncovered
by the Special Committee in its 13 months of investigation.  And they offer a
full, fair, and often troubling picture of the inner workings of government that
the Senate, by an overwhelming mandate, charged the Special Committee to present
to the American people.

<P>The death of White House Deputy Counsel Vincent W. Foster, Jr. on
July 20, 1993 marked the first time since the death of Secretary of Defense
James Forrestal in 1949 that a high-ranking U.S. official took his own
life.10  Now, almost three years later, the circumstances surrounding Mr.
Foster's tragic death remain the subject of much speculation and even
suspicion.  Against the backdrop of the death of a high-ranking U.S.
official, this controversy has been fueled by a series of misguided actions
taken by senior White House officials to shield the documents in Mr.
Foster's office from independent career law enforcement investigators and
to spirit the documents to the White House Residence.
<P>As Deputy Counsel to the President, Mr. Foster was the number two
lawyer in the White House.  He worked on the most important public issues
faced by the new Clinton Administration.  At the time of his death, Mr.
Foster also was one of the Clintons' key advisors on Whitewater and
Travelgate.  These matters are now the subject of criminal investigations
by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr.  In fact, by July 20, 1993, federal
investigators already were examining Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan
Association, the S&L at the center of the Whitewater affair, as well as the
controversial firing in May 1993 of seven career White House Travel Office
employees.  Mr. Foster's office contained important evidence of actions
that the Clintons and senior White House officials took with respect to
Whitewater and Travelgate.
<P> The Special Committee's investigation into the handling of Mr.
Foster's documents was among the most important matters of inquiry under
Resolution 120.  It raised the question, once again in our nation's
history, whether the power of the White House was misused to serve the
purely private ends of the President and his associates:  specifically,
whether senior officials took improper steps, in their handling of Mr.
Foster's documents, to cover up embarrassing revelations or even crimes
relating to Whitewater and Travelgate.
<P>Often, the successful prosecution of financial crimes and public
corruption depends on the documentary trail left by the perpetrators of
such wrongdoing.  For example, Independent Counsel Starr recently obtained
the convictions of Arkansas Governor Jim Guy Tucker and James and Susan
McDougal, the owners of Madison Guaranty and the Clintons' partners in the
Whitewater real estate development, in part on the basis of more than 600
documents introduced into evidence.  By the same token, the concealment or
removal of documents can seriously delay or derail investigation of
financial malfeasance.
<P>The White House undeniably mishandled the review of documents in Mr.
Foster's office following his death.  Department of Justice and Park Police
investigators told the Special Committee that their investigations were
hindered and impeded by the refusal of senior White House officials to
allow them to review Mr. Foster's documents.  The question before the
Committee, then, is whether senior White House officials simply committed
an inexplicable series of blunders and misjudgments or whether these
officials deliberately interfered with the investigations into Mr. Foster's
death and, perhaps, into the Whitewater and Travelgate affairs.<P>
<P>After careful review of all the evidence, the Special Committee
concludes that senior White House officials, particularly members of the
Office of the White House Counsel, engaged in a pattern of highly improper
conduct in their handling of the documents in Mr. Foster's office following
his death.  These senior White House officials deliberately prevented
career law enforcement officers from the Department of Justice and Park
Police from fully investigating the circumstances surrounding Mr. Foster's
death, including whether he took his own life because of troubling matters
involving the President and Mrs. Clinton.  At every turn, senior White
House officials prevented Justice Department and Park Police investigators
from examining the documents in Mr. Foster's office, particularly those
relating to the Whitewater and Travelgate affairs then under investigation.
<P>This pattern of concealment and obstruction continues even to the
present day.  The Special Committee concludes that senior White House
officials and other close Clinton associates were not candid in their
testimony before the Committee.  Specifically, the Committee concludes that
Margaret Williams, Chief of Staff to the First Lady, Susan Thomases, a New
York attorney and close advisor to Mrs. Clinton, Bernard Nussbaum,
then-White House Counsel, and Webster Hubbell, former Associate Attorney
General and now-convicted felon, all provided inaccurate and incomplete
testimony to the Committee in order to conceal Mrs. Clinton's pivotal role
in the decisions surrounding the handling of Mr. Foster's documents
following his death.
<P>Finally, the Special Committee concludes that the misconduct surrounding the handling of Mr. Foster's documents is part of a larger and more troubling pattern, that began in Arkansas in the 1980s and has continued in Washington during the Clinton Administration, in which the Clintons and their associates have sought to hinder, impede and control investigations into Madison Guaranty S&L and the Whitewater real estate investment.  Parts of this larger pattern include (i) Mrs. Clinton's decision in 1988 -- when federal investigators were examining possible misconduct leading to Madison Guaranty's failure just two years before -- to order the destruction of records relating to her representation of this S&L; (ii) Mr. Foster's and Mr. Hubbell's improper and unauthorized 1992 removal of Rose Law Firm records and files relating to Mrs. Clinton's representation of this corrupt S&L; and (iii) and the improper communication to White House officials during the fall of 1993 of confidential information relating to ongoing criminal investigations of Madison Guaranty and of Capital Management Services, Inc., a small business investment company also central to the Whitewater affair.
<P>*    *    *<BR>
1.<P>By the time of Vincent Foster's death in July 1993, the Clintons had established a pattern of concealing their involvement with Whitewater and the McDougals' Madison Guaranty S&L.
<P>The actions of senior White House officials and other close Clinton associates in the days and weeks following Mr. Foster's death cannot be viewed in a vacuum.  Their actions were but part of a pattern that began in 1988 of concealing, controlling and even destroying damaging information concerning the Whitewater real estate investment and the Clintons' ties to James and Susan McDougal and the Madison S&L.  Indeed, at the time of Mr. Foster's death, the Clintons and their associates were aware that the Clintons' involvement with Whitewater land deal, the McDougals, and the Madison S&L might subject them to civil liability and even criminal investigation. 
<P>In 1988, Mrs. Clinton ordered the destruction of records relating to her representation of Mr. McDougal's Madison S&L.11  This was not a routine destruction of records.  At the time, federal regulators were investigating the operation and solvency of Madison in anticipation of taking it over.  These Rose Law Firm records, which after Madison's failure would have belonged to the Resolution Trust Corporation ("RTC"),12 were directly relevant to that investigation.
<P>By ordering their destruction, Mrs. Clinton eliminated pertinent records and also exposed her firm to potential liability with respect to her representation.  Indeed, if such representation was proper, as Mrs. Clinton has claimed, her document destruction deprived the law firm of the records necessary to defend itself in a suit by federal investigators.  Moreover, in 1988, Seth Ward, a former associate of Mr. McDougal and Webster Hubbell's father-in-law, was actually suing Madison Guaranty over a land deal that federal regulators have described as a fraud.13  Mrs. Clinton had performed work on the project, including having numerous telephones calls and meetings with Mr. Ward, and the law firm record of her work and the transactions surrounding this land deal certainly would have been highly relevant to the conduct of that suit.
<P>Accordingly, Mrs. Clinton's destruction of documents could constitute a breach of legal ethics and, possibly, a violation of law if done with the knowledge that the documents are material to investigations or ongoing litigation.14  Professor Stephen Gillers of New York University, a noted ethics expert, has recently stated:  "I don't know how it could be that these files were destroyed. . . .  It makes it stranger that they were destroyed, not only so soon after they were created but also at a time when this lawsuit was about to go to trial. . . .  It certainly could lead to suspicion that she has something to hide because one possible inference from the destruction is that there was something in those files that she did not want to have made public."15   
<P>The pattern further continued during the 1992 presidential campaign, after questions arose about the Clintons' investment with the McDougals in Whitewater and Mrs. Clinton's representation of Madison Guaranty before a state agency.  In an effort to respond to inquiries from the press and charges from other candidates, Mrs. Clinton's then-law partner, Vincent Foster, collected all the information he could on the Madison representation.  At the conclusion of the campaign, the Madison files, which were by now the property of the RTC as conservator of Madison, as well as the files of other Rose clients for whom Mrs. Clinton had performed legal services, were secretly removed from the firm by another then-Rose Law Firm partner, Webster Hubbell.  Mr. Hubbell removed these files, at times taking the firm's only copies,16 without obtaining the consent of the firm or client.17 Given that Mr. Hubbell was about to assume a position of great public trust as Associate Attorney General, his unauthorized decision to remove these files is especially troubling.
<P>Also during the 1992 presidential campaign, Mr. Foster or Mr. Hubbell ordered the printing of billing records relating to the Rose Law Firm's representation of Madison Guaranty.  These important records revealed the extent of Mrs. Clinton's legal work for McDougal's S&L, including her telephone call to Beverly Bassett Schaffer, the Arkansas Securities Commissioner appointed by Governor Clinton, about the troubled thrift's controversial proposal to raise capital by issuing preferred stock.  The records also reflected Mrs. Clinton's work on the IDC or Castle Grande transaction, which federal regulators described as a series of fraudulent land flips.18  The records contain the handwritten questions of Mr. Foster to Mrs. Clinton and notations by Mr. Hubbell.19  Mrs. Clinton has recently stated through her lawyer that she may have reviewed them during the 1992 presidential campaign.
<P>After federal investigators began to look into matters relating to Madison Guaranty and Whitewater, a number of subpoenas were issued for these Rose Law Firm billing records.  By then, however, the records were nowhere to be found.  Despite extensive searches conducted by the law firm, neither the originals nor copies were discovered.20  They were not in the firm computers, its client files, or the firm's storage facility.21
<P>Apparently, at some point, someone removed these billing records from the Rose Law Firm.  In August 1995, Carolyn Huber, an assistant to Mrs. Clinton, discovered them in the book room of the White House Residence, next to Mrs. Clinton's office.22  At the time, Mrs. Huber did not realize the records were under subpoena, and she placed them in a box in her office.  In January 1996,23 Mrs. Huber identified these records, and personal counsel for the President and Mrs. Clinton turned them over investigators.  Mr. Hubbell testified that he last saw the records during the 1992 presidential campaign in the possession of Mr. Foster.24
<P>By July 1993, the Clintons and their associates had established a pattern of concealment with respect to the Clintons' involvement with Whitewater and the Madison S&L.  Because of the complexity of the allegations of misdeeds involving these institutions, documents and files are critical to any inquiries into the matter.  Yet, at every important turn, crucial files and documents "disappeared" or were withheld from scrutiny whenever questions were raised.
2.<P>The Clintons and their associates were aware, at the time of Mr. Foster's death, that the Clintons' involvement with Whitewater and the Madison Guaranty S&L might subject them to liability.
<P>In late fall 1992, Betsey Wright, the coordinator of "damage control" efforts during the presidential campaign and a former chief of staff to Governor Clinton, learned of a "criminal referral regarding a savings and loan official in Arkansas and . . . involv[ing] the Clintons."25  Ms. Wright testified that she learned this information from a Clinton supporter from California who had a friend who heard it at a cocktail party in Kansas City.26  At the cocktail party, an RTC official informed someone, whose friend reported it to Ms. Wright, that the RTC had just sent a "criminal referral up to the prosecutor in Little Rock."27  Upon hearing the news, Ms. Wright tried to gather more information about the referral.28  She then told Mrs. Clinton about the referral directly.  Ms. Wright testified:  "I remember I asked Hillary if she was aware of any friend of theirs who was in a savings and loan business who might be under criminal investigation, and we couldn't think of anybody."29 
<P>It is with this knowledge that the Clintons and their advisers came to Washington, taking with them the important documents relating to Whitewater and Madison.  The documents (including documents improperly taken from the law firm) were entrusted only to close associates of the Clintons, chiefly Messrs. Foster and Hubbell.
<P>By March 1993, senior Clinton Administration officials confirmed that the RTC had sent a criminal referral mentioning the Clintons to the Justice Department.30  Specifically, RTC Senior Vice President William H. Roelle testified that, after taking office, Roger Altman, then Deputy Treasury Secretary, directed the staff to inform him of all important or potentially high-visibility issues.31  According to Mr. Roelle, on or about March 23, 1993, he told Mr. Altman of an RTC referral involving the Clintons.32
<P>Powerful documentary evidence strongly indicates that Mr. Altman immediately passed this important information on to White House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum.  On March 23, Mr. Altman sent Mr. Nussbaum a facsimile with a handwritten cover sheet, forwarding an "RTC Clip Sheet" of a March 9, 1992 New York Times article with the headline, "Clinton Defends Real-Estate Deal."33  This article reported the responses of presidential candidate, Bill Clinton, to an earlier Times report on the Clintons' Whitewater investment.  The next day, Mr. Altman faxed to Mr. Nussbaum the same article that he sent the day before and portions of the earlier Times report on Whitewater, dated March 8, 1992, entitled "Clintons Joined S&L Operator in an Ozark Real-Estate Venture."34
<P>In addition, SBA Associate Administrator Wayne Foren testified that, in early May 1993, he briefed Erskine Bowles, the new SBA Administrator about the agency's ongoing investigation of David Hale's Capital Management Services because the case involved President Clinton.35  Shortly thereafter, Mr. Bowles told Mr. Foren that he had briefed White House Chief of Staff Mack McLarty about the case.36  Although Mr. Bowles did not recall being briefed by Mr. Foren about Capital Management37 or talking to Mr. McLarty about the case,38 Mr. Foren's account was corroborated by his deputy, Charles Shepperson.39  Mr. McLarty's calendar indicated that Mr. Bowles had two meetings with Mr. McLarty at the White House in early May 1993.40
<P>As of July 1993, therefore, Mrs. Clinton and others in the Administration were on notice that there was an ongoing federal investigation to which Madison-related documents could be relevant.
3.<P>At the time of his death, Mr. Foster's office contained damaging evidence about the Whitewater and Travelgate affairs.
<P>After he became Deputy White House Counsel, Mr. Foster continued to play a key role in controlling potential damage to the Clintons from Whitewater.  He was given the responsibility for overseeing the preparation of Clintons' tax returns for 1992 to reflect properly the sale of their shares in Whitewater.41  Mr. Foster worked with other White House officials in the Spring of 1993 in preparing a response to expected Whitewater questions.42  And, most interestingly, Mr. McDougal had left a message for Mr. Foster on June 16, 1993, "re tax returns of HRC, VWF and McDougal."43  The documents in Mr. Foster's office at the time of death included a file on Whitewater and his notes of conversations with the Clintons' accountant, Yoly Redden, concerning the tax treatment of the sale of Whitewater.44  The notes identified the tax problem as a "can of worms you shouldn't open"45 and further warned: "Don't want to go back into that box  Was McD trying to circumvent bank loss -- why HRC getting loan from other."46
<P>Mr. Foster also played a central role in both the firing of seven career employees of the Travel Office on May 19, 1993 and subsequent attempts to conceal Mrs. Clinton's true role in the controversial firings.  Harry Thomason, a close Clinton confidant, reportedly instigated the firings after the career employees rejected his plan to obtain the White House's charter business for a company he partly owned.47  With public criticism growing, the White House circumvented normal procedures and directly asked the FBI (not the Department of Justice) to investigate allegations of possible criminal misconduct by the career employees of the Travel Office.48  Although Mr. Foster was not formally reprimanded for his role in the firings, he felt personally responsible.49
<P>Other senior White House officials implicated in Travelgate included David Watkins and Patsy Thomasson.  The Special Committee belatedly obtained a memorandum of Mr. Watkins outlining Mr. Foster's extensive involvement as Mrs. Clinton's conduit to the firings.50  Indeed, Mr. Watkins fingered Mr. Foster as the person who directly communicated to him Mrs. Clinton's order that the Travel Office staff be fired:  "Foster regularly informed me that the First Lady was concerned and desired action -- the action desired was the firing of the Travel Office staff."51  Notwithstanding Mrs. Clinton's clear involvement in the firing of the staff, Mr. Foster and other White House officials did not disclose her true role to investigators probing the affair.
<P>Significantly, at the time of his death, Mr. Foster's briefcase contained files, a personal notebook and a torn-up note, all concerning the controversial Travel Office matter.
<P>Thus, when Mr. Foster committed suicide in July 1993, White House officials were aware that a danger existed that the law enforcement officials might discover documents concerning Whitewater or Travelgate in his office.  In fact, David Margolis, one of the Justice Department officials who attended the search of Mr. Foster's office two days after his death, was aware of an RTC criminal referral concerning Madison that mentioned the Clintons.52  This risk of discovery provides the backdrop against which the story of Mr. Foster's death and the White House's subsequent scramble must be viewed.
4.<P>White House officials engaged in highly improper conduct in handling documents in Vincent Foster's office following his death.
<P>The evidence before the Special Committee established that White House officials engaged in a pattern of deliberate obstruction of, and interference with, efforts by law enforcement authorities to conduct their several investigations into Mr. Foster's death.
<P>This White House interference began immediately following Mr. Foster's death on the night of July 20.  Senior White House officials ignored specific requests by the Park Police to seal Mr. Foster's office on the night of his death.53  Instead, White House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum, Chief of Staff to the First Lady Margaret Williams and Deputy Assistant to the President Patsy Thomasson entered Mr. Foster's office purportedly to search for a suicide note.
<P>According to career Secret Service Officer Henry O'Neill, and corroborated by Secret Service records, Ms. Williams removed file folders from Mr. Foster's office that night.  Even assuming, contrary to the testimony of Officer O'Neill, that no files were removed from the office that night, the multiple entries into Mr. Foster's office plainly compromised the integrity of evidence the Park Police considered to be valuable.54  Beyond this, Mr. Nussbaum not only ignored instructions to seal Mr. Foster's office, but also allowed Ms. Thomasson, a staffer without a security clearance who was involved in the Travel Office matter, to conduct an improper search of Mr. Foster's office. For reasons unknown -- but to a large extent illuminated by Officer O'Neill's testimony -- Margaret Williams also participated in the late night foray through Mr. Foster's office.
<P>The next morning, on July 21, Mr. Nussbaum's personal secretary, Betsy Pond, also rummaged through Mr. Foster's office -- ostensibly to straighten it up -- thereby disturbing important evidence.55  Stephen Neuwirth, Mr. Nussbaum's associate, immediately recognized the impropriety: "I didn't think it was appropriate for an assistant to Mr. Nussbaum to be in the office at that time."56  Thomas Castleton, a staff assistant, also entered Mr. Foster's office in the morning of July 21.57  Only the Park Police investigators were impeded in their attempt to enter Mr. Foster's office to search for evidence.  They waited in vain all day "for approval from Mr. Nussbaum" to conduct their investigation.58
<P>In addition, members of the White House Counsel's office participated in the Park Police interviews of White House staffers, not to protect the legal interests of the staffers but, in the words of Park Police Detective Peter Markland, to "report back to Mr. Nussbaum what was being said in the interviews."59  The White House Counsel's office coached the staffers about their testimony during a meeting on "comportment and interrogation."60  The Park Police left with the impression that their interviews had been rehearsed.61
<P>The pattern of obstruction continued with the White House dealings with the Justice Department.  Mr. Nussbaum agreed with Deputy Attorney General Heymann on the procedures for reviewing documents in Mr. Foster's office.62  The next day, when Susan Thomases, a close advisor to Mrs. Clinton and a member of the Whitewater defense team during the 1992 presidential campaign,63 complained about the review procedures after a conversation with Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Nussbaum broke the agreement and changed the procedures.64  In explaining this about-face, Mr. Nussbaum told his associate, Stephen Neuwirth, that Ms. Thomases and Mrs. Clinton were "concerned about anyone having unfettered access to Mr. Foster's office."65  Contrary to his promise to the Deputy Attorney General, Mr. Nussbaum proceeded to review the documents by himself and did not afford Mr. Heymann an opportunity to decide whether Justice Department officials should be present for the review.66
<P>The Special Committee concludes that Mr. Nussbaum engaged in highly improper conduct in braking the White House agreement with the Justice Department.  Mr. Nussbaum, in effect, interposed himself between the investigators and the matters under investigation.  Prompted by Mrs. Clinton, Susan Thomases, and senior White House officials, he made a conscious decision to interfere with a federal investigation.
<P>Beyond this, the Special Committee concludes that the "review" of documents in Mr. Foster's office on July 22 was a sham.  Law enforcement authorities did not review any documents; Mr. Nussbaum relied on their presence simply to "dress up" the review.67  Mr. Nussbaum ignored repeated complaints by Justice Department officials that they had no meaningful role in the review, and that Mr. Nussbaum was providing only a "generic description"68 of the files in the office.69  He carefully glossed over sensitive documents that he knew could embarrass the President and the Administration, including those relating to Whitewater and Travelgate.
<P>Almost immediately after law enforcement officers left Mr. Foster's office, Mr. Nussbaum went to work to conduct the real search in secret.  Michael Spafford, an attorney for the Foster family, testified that he overheard Mr. Nussbaum tell Mr. Sloan at the end of the meeting that they would look through the materials again later.70  Associate White House Counsel Clifford Sloan's notes of the meeting ended with the following: "get Maggie--go through office--get HRC, WJC stuff."71   
<P> Ms. Williams and Mr. Nussbaum collected the files, including at least one marked Whitewater.  Ms. Williams then consulted with Mrs. Clinton, and transferred one or two boxes of documents to the White House Residence for further review by the President and Mrs. Clinton.  In the case of Mr. Foster's highly sensitive Travelgate files, Mr. Nussbaum took the records to his office.72  There is also evidence that indices of files in Mr. Foster's office were altered or destroyed after his death.73  These indices were the only means of securing a chain of custody for Mr. Foster's documents.
<P>In short, senior White House officials deliberately disrupted the critical chain of custody of Mr. Foster's documents and may have lost or destroyed evidence now highly relevant to ongoing criminal investigations of Whitewater and Travelgate.
<P>During the July 22 search, Mr. Nussbaum also failed to inform law enforcement officials that scraps of paper were at the bottom of Mr. Foster's briefcase.  He was told by both Clifford Sloan74 and Deborah Gorham75 that papers remained in Mr. Foster's briefcase after his search, but did not inform law enforcement.  When Mr. Neuwirth finally "discovered" Mr. Foster's torn-up note on July 26, the White House waited a further 26 hours before notifying the authorities.  Although the ostensible reason for the delay was to permit the President and Mrs. Foster to review the note, White House officials conducted a series of meetings during this period to discuss the consequences of turning the note over to the authorities.
<P>Even without the benefit of all the facts uncovered by the Special Committee within the last year, Deputy Attorney General Philip Heymann aptly summed up the pattern of troubling behavior by the White House as it appeared to him on July 27, when he finally saw the note:
<P>    I'm trying to describe a collection of little things, each of which I'm prepared to believe is just a difference of opinion, and in my view, a clumsy and foolish way to handle the matter on the part of the White House staff and Mr. Nussbaum.

<P>    But they're starting to collect, and as they're collecting too much, and the last one's quite dramatic.

<P>    I mean, first of all, we had a sensible system for reviewing the documents, and that's changed to a system that doesn't have any law enforcement input into it at all.  It's changed without notifying me.

<P>    I'm vaguely worried about the Park Police feeling that they're not wholly able to investigate; those messages are not too clear.

<P>    And then along comes a note that should have been found on the 22nd, if they really went through all the documents.  I never looked at the briefcase but it at least worries me that perhaps it should have been found, and we learn about it 27 hours later.76
Mr. Heymann then ordered the Justice Department to investigate the discovery of the note and Mr. Foster's assertions made therein.
<P>Amazingly, the White House did not cooperate fully even with the new investigations ordered by Mr. Heymann.  During official FBI interviews, where they were under an obligation to tell the truth, senior White House officials did not tell the FBI that Mrs. Clinton saw the note, and that Susan Thomases was told about it by Mr. Nussbaum, before it was disclosed to the authorities.  At Mr. Heymann's request, the Justice Department's Office of Professional Responsibility investigated Mr. Foster's assertion that the FBI lied in their report to the Attorney General on the Travelgate controversy.  Mr. Foster's notebook on that matter, which Mr. Nussbaum found in Mr. Foster's briefcase, was critical evidence to that investigation.  Nevertheless, instead of disclosing its existence to Justice Department officials, Mr. Nussbaum tucked away in his office Mr. Foster's notebook and other Travelgate materials.77
<P>In July 1995, when he found out about Mr. Nussbaum's concealment of Mr. Foster's Travelgate notebook, the Director of the Office of Professional Responsibility at the Justice Department, Michael Shaheen, wrote an angry memorandum to Associate Attorney General David Margolis.  After outlining specific instances of noncooperation by the White House, Mr. Shaheen concluded:  "The fact that we have just now learned of the existence of obviously relevant notes written by Mr. Foster on the subject of the FBI report is yet another example of the lack of cooperation and candor we received from the White House throughout our inquiry."78
<P>Viewed in the aggregate, then, these numerous instances of White House interference with several ongoing law enforcement investigations amounted to far more than just aggressive lawyering or political naivete.  Rather, the Special Committee concludes that the actions of these senior White House officials constitute a highly improper pattern of deliberate misconduct.
5.<P>Mrs. Clinton was closely involved in the handling of documents in Mr. Foster's office following his death and directed that investigators be denied "unfettered access" to his office.
<P>From the moment that she was notified of Mr. Foster's death, Mrs. Clinton and her key agents -- Margaret Williams and Susan Thomases -- were engaged in the subsequent handling of documents in Mr. Foster's office.  Telephone records indicate that upon learning the news, Mrs. Clinton first called her Chief of Staff, Margaret Williams.79  After talking with Mrs. Clinton, Ms. Williams and her assistant, Evelyn Lieberman, drove to the White House and searched Mr. Foster's office.  The second call Mrs. Clinton made on the night of Mr. Foster's death was to the residence of Harry Thomason,80 a key player in the Travelgate scandal.  Mrs. Clinton then called Susan Thomases, who handled Whitewater damage control during the 1992 presidential campaign, and talked for 20 minutes.81
<P>This series of telephone calls in the hours immediately following Mr. Foster's death established a communications triangle among Mrs. Clinton, Ms. Thomases, and Ms. Williams that would surface frequently in the handling of documents in Mr. Foster's office.  The evidence strongly suggests that Mrs. Clinton, upon learning of Mr. Foster's death, at least realized its connection to Mr. Thomason's Travelgate scandal, and perhaps to the Whitewater matter, and dispatched her trusted lieutenants to contain any potential embarrassment or political damage.
<P>After speaking with Mrs. Clinton, Ms. Thomases paged Ms. Williams, while Ms. Williams was searching Mr. Foster's office at the White House,82 presumably to monitor the progress of the search.  After the completion of her search, Ms. Williams returned home and called Mrs. Clinton at 12:56 a.m. on the morning of July 21.83  Upon the conclusion of her eleven minute conversation with Mrs. Clinton, Ms. Williams called Ms. Thomases at 1:10 a.m. and spoke for fourteen minutes.84
<P>These telephone calls illustrated a pattern that would be repeated at each critical event in the handling of papers in Mr. Foster's office: discussions among Mrs. Clinton, Ms. Thomases, and Ms. Williams; subsequent implementation by Ms. Williams, monitored by Ms. Thomases; and, finally, reporting by Ms. Williams to Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Thomases.
<P>The operation of the Clinton-Thomases-Williams triangle was best illustrated on July 22, when White House officials and Justice Department officials were scheduled to review documents in Mr. Foster's office.  Ms. Williams called Mrs. Clinton at 6:44 a.m. Central Daylight Time.85  Mrs. Clinton then called Ms. Thomases in Washington,86 who immediately paged Bernard Nussbaum at the White House.87  When Mr. Nussbaum called back, Ms. Thomases asked him about the upcoming review of Mr. Foster's office and, by Mr. Nussbaum's own account, said that "people are concerned" about the procedures to be employed for conducting the review.88
<P>Later that morning, Mr. Nussbaum told Mr. Neuwirth that the First Lady and Ms. Thomases were concerned about law enforcement officials having "unfettered access" to documents in Mr. Foster's office.89  
<P>At 10:00 a.m., when the document review was scheduled to begin, Mr. Nussbaum told Justice Department officials that he alone would review the documents, breaking a prior agreement with the law enforcement officials.  Throughout the day, while White House officials were meeting with Mr. Nussbaum to discuss procedures for reviewing documents in Mr. Foster's office, Ms. Thomases made repeated phone calls to the White House, in an apparent effort to monitor, and perhaps to affect, the progress of those discussions.  Telephone records indicated that, between 10:48 a.m. and 11:54 a.m., Ms. Thomases called the office of the Chief of Staff, Mack McLarty, three times and the office of the Chief of Staff to the First Lady, Margaret Williams, three times.90  At 12:55 p.m., Ms. Williams called the Rodham residence in Little Rock, apparently in response to a page from Mrs. Clinton's personal assistant.91  And records indicated that, at 1:25 p.m., approximately the time when Mr. Nussbaum told law enforcement officials that he alone would review documents in Mr. Foster's office, a telephone call was placed from the White House to the Rodham residence.92
<P>After Mr. Nussbaum finished his review of documents in Mr. Foster's office, he and Ms. Williams conducted a second review to segregate and remove the Clintons' personal files.93  Ms. Williams called Mrs. Clinton from Mr. Foster's office to seek instructions concerning where to place the files, and Carolyn Huber recalled that Ms. Williams said that "Mrs. Clinton had asked her to call me"94 about transferring the files to the residence.  Ms. Williams told Thomas Castleton that she was taking the files to the residence so that the Clintons could review them before they were handed over to Williams & Connolly.95  After the documents were transferred, Ms. Williams and Ms. Thomases again talked on the telephone at 5:13 p.m.96  At 7:12 p.m., Ms. Thomases called Mrs. Clinton in Little Rock.97  
<P>The evidence leads to the inescapable conclusion that, early in the morning of July 22, Mrs. Clinton, Susan Thomases and Margaret Williams discussed the procedures for conducting the review of documents in Mr. Foster's office.  Ms. Thomases then communicated their "concern[s]"98 to Mr. Nussbaum about his prior agreement with senior Justice Department officials.  In place of that agreement, which would have permitted those officials to review jointly Mr. Foster's documents with Mr. Nussbaum,99 the White House adopted a new procedure under which he alone would review the documents.  Thus, as Mrs. Clinton wished, law enforcement would not have "unfettered access" to Mr. Foster's documents.  Ms. Williams called Mrs. Clinton from Mr. Foster's office to ask where to take the Clintons' personal documents that she had segregated with Mr. Nussbaum.  After getting instructions from Mrs. Clinton, Ms. Williams transferred the files to the White House Residence for the Clintons to review.  After the new plan was fully executed, Ms. Thomases again talked to Ms. Williams and, according to telephone records, called Mrs. Clinton.
<P>On July 27, the day after a note in Mr. Foster's hand was discovered and the day that documents from Mr. Foster's office was transferred from the White House Residence to Williams and Connolly, Mrs. Clinton summoned Susan Thomases and Webster Hubbell to the White House.100  The three were in the White House Residence alone together, and Mr. Hubbell and Ms. Thomases left at the same time.101  Ms. Thomases and Mr. Hubbell studiously avoided testifying about this meeting in early appearances before the Special Committee.  However, when eventually confronted with clear documentary evidence, in the form of Secret Service logs,102 Ms. Thomases finally admitted that she recalled the three being together at the White House in the week following Mr. Foster's death.103  Ms. Thomases maintained that they did no more than exchange condolences with Mrs. Clinton,104  and that there was no discussion of the handling of documents in Mr. Foster's office.  Mr. Hubbell stated that he went to the White House to give Mrs. Clinton an account of Mr. Foster's funeral after Mrs. Clinton left.105  He claimed that he did not see Ms. Thomases or discuss the Mr. Foster's note, which had been discovered but not disclosed to the authorities, with Mrs. Clinton.106
<P>The Special Committee concludes that this testimony of Ms. Thomases and Mr. Hubbell about their simultaneous visits to the second floor of the White House residence is highly implausible.  White House officials, investigators, and the media107 were all speculating about and searching for a note following Mr. Foster's death.  Yet both Ms. Thomases and Mr. Hubbell persist with their unbelievable story that the note was not discussed less than one day after it was discovered in Mr. Foster's briefcase. 
<P>In sum, the Special Committee concludes senior Administration officials and Ms. Thomases have sought to conceal the true involvement of Mrs. Clinton in the handling of documents in Mr. Foster's office, an involvement that is unmistakably established by Mr. Neuwirth's admission, and by documentary records, all of which shatter the wall of denial erected by close Clinton associates.
6.<P>Senior White House officials and other Clinton associates provided incomplete and inaccurate testimony to the Special Committee.
<P>The Special Committee concludes that its effort to find the truth about the events of July 20-27, 1993 was impeded by what appeared to be a disturbing pattern of incomplete and inaccurate testimony by senior White House officials and close Clinton associates.  Time and again, the testimony of career law enforcement officials and others without a motive to lie, as well as documentary evidence, told one consistent story, while senior White House officials and close Clinton associates offered a contradictory version of the facts.
<P>Three Park Police officers testified that on the night of Mr. Foster's death, July 20, they told White House officials to take steps to seal his office -- requests the White House officials denied.  A Secret Service Officer testified that later that night he observed the First Lady's Chief of Staff, Margaret Williams, remove files from Mr. Foster's office;108 Ms. Williams denied that she removed anything from the office.
<P>This pattern continued on the next day, July 21.  Justice Department officials testified that they had reached an agreement with the White House concerning the procedures for searching Mr. Foster's office.109  Even though the contemporaneous documentary evidence supported the testimony of the Deputy Attorney General and career Justice Department officials,110 White House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum and his associates denied the existence of any such agreement allowing law enforcement to examine the documents in Mr. Foster's office.111
<P>The Special Committee heard more of the same concerning the events of July 22.  Ignoring a peculiar pattern of early morning telephone calls involving the First Lady, Ms. Williams and Susan Thomases denied that Mrs. Clinton played any role whatsoever in the decision to bar law enforcement from looking at the documents in Mr. Foster's office.  Breaking ranks somewhat, Mr. Nussbaum admitted that he was told by Ms. Thomases that unspecified "people" were concerned about the upcoming search -- presumably, the First Lady, since Ms. Thomases was widely known for speaking with Mrs. Clinton's authority.  Finally, Stephen Neuwirth, a lower level counsel, admitted that Mr. Nussbaum told him that Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Thomases were concerned about giving law enforcement "unfettered access" to Mr. Foster's office.112
<P>This pattern continued later in the day on July 22, when Ms. Williams denied that she was bringing documents from Mr. Foster's office to the White House Residence for the Clintons to review.  Instead, she offered an implausible story to explain her decision to bring the documents to the Residence.113  Ms. Williams' account was contradicted by a young White House staffer, Thomas Castleton, who testified that Ms. Williams told him that "the President or the First Lady had to review the contents of the boxes to determine what was in them."114
<P>Beyond this, there is the curious discovery of Mr. Foster's note on July 26.  Thomas Spafford, a lawyer for the Foster family, testified that, on July 22, he overheard Clifford Sloan tell Mr. Nussbaum on July 22 that there were scraps at the bottom of the briefcase.  Messrs. Sloan and Nussbaum denied this.115 
<P>As set forth below in the Findings of this Report, the Committee concludes that four persons -- Margaret Williams, Susan Thomases, Bernard Nussbaum and Webster Hubbell--provided incomplete and inaccurate testimony to the Committee in an apparent effort to conceal the intimate involvement of Mrs. Clinton in the events following Mr. Foster's death.
7.<P>The Office of the White House Counsel was misused to impede ongoing investigations and to serve the purely personal legal interests of the President, Mrs. Clinton and their associates.
<P>Every citizen is entitled to mount a defense to civil and criminal charges.  The President is no different.  He is not entitled, however, to use the power of his office to gain a defense of his private legal affairs not available to other Americans.  The White House Counsel's Office is supposed to serve the President in his official executive capacity.  These lawyers are paid by the taxpayers to serve the public interest.
<P>In the matter of Mr. Foster's death, the Office of the White House Counsel served, in effect, as the Clintons' personal defense law firm.  This service extended beyond Mr. Foster's employment as the Clinton's personal attorney to the use of the White House Counsel's Office in the days following his death to interfere with and hinder several ongoing federal investigations into Mr. Foster's death and the handling of documents in Mr. Foster's office at the time of his death.  Instead of cooperating with law enforcement officials, the Office of the White House Counsel impeded the investigations of the Park Police and the Department of Justice.  The White House lawyers ignored and, in some cases, intentionally violated established procedures that would have ensured the proper handling of documents in Mr. Foster's office.
<P>The impropriety of these and other actions -- actions that prompted the Deputy Attorney General to ask Mr. Nussbaum, "Bernie, are you hiding something?" -- is compounded when one recognizes that these actions were taken by members of the Office of the White House Counsel.  These were government lawyers who were supposed to protect the public interest in proper investigations and faithful execution of the laws, not to do the private bidding of the President and First Lady.
<P>The Special Committee concludes that the White House Counsel's Office was misused in the aftermath of Mr. Foster's death to interfere with and to obstruct various federal investigations.  This pattern of abuse by the White House Counsel's Office is not limited in time or scope, but rather has recurred throughout the Special Committee's investigation into other matters authorized by Senate Resolution 120.  These include efforts to obtain improperly confidential law enforcement information from the RTC and from the Small Business Administration, all while coordinating with private attorneys representing the Clintons as subjects of investigation.
<P>The Special Committee recommends that steps be taken to insure that such misuse of the White House Counsel's Office does not recur in this, or any future, Administration.
<P>*<P>*    *
<P>Taken as a whole, the events described in this Report and summarized in this conclusion, reveal a concerted effort by senior White House officials to block career law enforcement investigators from conducting a thorough investigation of a unique and disturbing event -- the first suicide of a very senior U.S. official in almost fifty years.  Unquestionably, the Department of Justice and Park Police were authorized to conduct this investigation, and White House officials owed them a duty to cooperate.  Instead, law enforcement officials were confronted at every turn with concerted efforts to deny them access to evidence in Mr. Foster's office.  Strikingly, the Counsel to the President carried out the wishes of the First Lady by breaking his earlier agreement with the Deputy Attorney General of the United States.  And law enforcement officials were forced to sit still as White House lawyers conducted a charade of a search.  Only after the duly appointed investigators had departed, did the White House Counsel and the First Lady's Chief of Staff begin the real search, which resulted in the transfer of documents to the White House Residence; the removal of Mr. Foster's Travel Office notebook; and the disappearance of important document indices that would have reflected the full contents of his files.
<P>The actions of the White House are especially serious because the Special Committee has discovered that the files shielded from the Department of Justice contained evidence relevant to two investigations that touched on the Clintons' personal interests: the criminal referral into Madison S&L, and the anticipated investigation, by Congress and others, into the Travel Office firings.  As demonstrated in this Report, the White House, including Mrs. Clinton, were on notice that these investigations were either ongoing or imminent.  As it happens, both of these investigations were of sufficient weight to be now under the jurisdiction of an Independent Counsel.
<P>Against this background, the actions of the White House during the week after Mr. Foster's death must be judged.  These White House actions were highly improper; they were deliberate; and they adversely affected ongoing investigations by career law enforcement officials.  The American people will never be sure of the contents of Vincent Foster's office at the time of his death.  Their uncertainty and doubts, however, clearly are the direct result of the wrongful action by the White House.

  <H2>       BACKGROUND</H2>
  
<P>The death of any senior U.S. official is sure to be a matter of public concern.  But Mr. Foster's death swelled into a substantial controversy because of two additional factors.  First, Mr. Foster had a very close and long-standing personal and professional relationship with the President and Mrs. Clinton.  As a prominent lawyer in Arkansas and then as Deputy White House Counsel, he provided legal counsel to them on a number of sensitive personal matters.  Questions therefore arose as to whether concerns about any of these matters, including the Whitewater and Travelgate affairs, contributed to Mr. Foster's death.  Second, senior White House officials, particularly members of the Office of the White House Counsel, took actions in the days following Mr. Foster's death to search and to review the contents of Mr. Foster's office while preventing law enforcement officials from doing the same.  These actions raised serious questions about whether, in the wake of Mr. Foster's death, the Office of the White House Counsel was misused to serve the purely personal legal and political interests of the President, the First Lady and their associates.
<P>I.  Mr. Foster's Involvement in the Clintons' Personal Matters
<P>Vincent Foster was born on January 15, 1945 in Hope, Arkansas.  He attended kindergarten with future President William Jefferson Clinton and future White House Chief of Staff Thomas "Mack" McLarty.  Mr. Foster graduated from Hope High School in 1963 and from Davidson College in 1967.  Mr. Foster graduated first in his class from the University of Arkansas School of Law in 1971, and passed the bar exam later that year with the highest score in the state.  He then joined the Rose Law Firm in Little Rock, Arkansas, and became a full partner two years later, in 1973.  Mr. Foster's partners included future First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, future Associate Attorney General Webster Hubbell, and future Associate White House Counsel William Kennedy.
<P>Messrs. Foster and Hubbell participated in efforts during the 1992 presidential campaign to control damage arising from the Whitewater matter and, specifically, to Mrs. Clinton's representation of the Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan Association.  James and Susan McDougal, the Clinton's partners in the real estate venture at the heart of the Whitewater affair, owned and controlled Madison.  On May 28, 1996, James McDougal was convicted of eighteen federal felonies and Susan McDougal was convicted of four federal felonies.  These convictions related both to the operations of Madison and the Whitewater real estate investment.  During the 1992 campaign, Mr. Hubbell improperly removed from the Rose Law Firm its files concerning its representation of Madison.  Messrs. Hubbell and Foster also reviewed Rose Law Firm billing records relating to Rose's representation of Madison.116  These records were found in the White House Residence in August 1995 and finally turned over to investigators in January 1996, more than two years after they were first subpoenaed.  The records contain handwritten questions from Mr. Foster to Mrs. Clinton; it is not possible to date when these questions were put to Mrs. Clinton.
<P>In January 1993, President-elect Clinton asked Mr. Foster to become White House Deputy Counsel.  Mr. Foster's office on the second floor of the West Wing of the White House was in the same suite as that of White House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum.  The Counsel's suite was located right next to the West Wing office suite of the First Lady.  
<P>As Deputy Counsel, Mr. Foster worked on many sensitive legal and political matters for the Clintons.  In May 1993, Mr. Foster assigned his former law partner, Associate White House Counsel William Kennedy, to investigate allegations of mismanagement and misappropriation of funds in the White House Travel Office.  On May 19, 1993, the White House fired seven career employees of the Travel Office.  Almost immediately, the White House came under intense criticism for its handling of these firings.  According to press reports, less than a month after President Clinton's inauguration, Catherine Cornelius, the President's cousin, wrote a memorandum proposing that the White House dismiss the career employees of the Travel Office and that she run the operation.117  The memorandum cast doubts on the administration's claim that the seven career employees were fired for financial misconduct.  In addition, Harry Thomason, a close friend of the Clintons, reportedly had attempted to steer the White House's lucrative charter business to an aviation company that he partly owned.118  Rebuffed by the career employees of the Travel Office, Mr. Thomason reportedly accused them of wrongdoing.119
<P>As public criticism mounted, the White House asked a senior FBI official, John Collingwood, to attend a "political strategy session" with senior presidential advisers on how to deal with the growing scandal.120  On the same day, the White House took the highly unusual step of releasing a confidential FBI statement confirming that the bureau was investigating possible criminal misconduct in the Travel Office.121
<P>Thus, in addition to allegations of cronyism underlying the firing of the career employees, the White House came under fire for misusing the FBI, an independent investigative agency, for its own political ends, a charge that would surface time and again as the White House attempted to contain and manage embarrassing and potentially incriminating information through contacts with federal investigative agencies.  Protocols required that White House contacts with the FBI go through the Department of Justice, and "[b]y calling on the FBI to help save the Administration from embarrassment, the White House appeared to be deviating from two decades of efforts to insulate the law-enforcement agency from even the appearance of Presidential manipulation."122  The FBI conducted an internal inquiry into contacts between its agents and the White House, and the White House initiated its own investigation into the matter.  On July 2, 1993, the White House released the report of its internal review, which sharply reprimanded Mr. Kennedy and others.  Although Mr. Foster was not formally reprimanded, he felt personally responsible for the affair and insisted that Mr. Nussbaum allow him to shoulder the blame.123  Mr. Foster's secretive files on the Travel Office controversy were in his briefcase at the time of Mr. Foster's death, together with a torn-up note purportedly discovered six days later.  The note listed Mr. Foster's troubles and concerns, many of which dealt with the Travel Office controversy.
<P>The Travel Office affair apparently weighed heavily on Mr. Foster's mind at the time of his death.124  Many colleagues, confidantes, and friends of Mr. Foster stated to investigators that "the single greatest source of his distress was the criticism he and others within the Counsel's office received following the firing of seven employees from the White House Travel Office."125  However, according to a FBI report of an interview with Susan Thomases, who "got to know Vince Foster fairly well" from her work with the Clinton campaign, transition, and administration,126 "[h]is death came as a complete shock to her and she can offer no reason or speculation as to why he may have taken his life."127  According to the FBI report, Ms. Thomases last saw Mr. Foster on "Wednesday or Thursday before his death," when "they had lunch together with some people in Washington."128
<P>Ms. Thomases has made subsequent statements that contradict the FBI report of her interview.  In Blood Sport, an account of the Whitewater affair, author James Stewart reported that Ms. Thomases last saw Mr. Foster on the Wednesday evening before his death.129  Their last meeting was not a public luncheon, as the FBI report recorded, but was at the Mansion on O Street, a private hotel frequented by Ms. Thomases.  Ms. Thomases had suggested the location after Mr. Foster asked to speak to her "off the campus."130  According to Blood Sport, Mr. Foster confided in Ms. Thomases during that last meeting, telling her about his personal and professional troubles.  Mr. Foster reportedly did not want to "let the president and Hillary down" and, in particular, referred to the Travel Office affair.  Mr. Foster reportedly stated to Ms. Thomases that "he didn't trust David Watkins, who he feared might fabricate or embellish the facts to cover himself--possibly at the expense of the first lady."131
<P>When asked about the apparent discrepancy between her FBI statement and her interview with Mr. Stewart, Ms. Thomases told the Committee that she told the FBI agent about her last meeting with Mr. Foster at the Mansion on O Street.132  She offered no explanation as to why the agent failed to record this significant fact.  Ms. Thomases admitted that she spoke to Mr. Stewart in connection with Blood Sport, but claimed, "I don't believe that I said that that's what happened with [Mr. Foster] that night.  I think [Mr. Stewart] probably put together different pieces of a different conversation."133  Ms. Thomases maintains that her statement to the FBI that "she can offer no reason or speculation as to why he may have taken his life,"134 was correct, because "I still do not feel that I'm ready to speculate on why he took his life."135
<P>During his brief tenure as Deputy White House Counsel, Mr. Foster handled a number of sensitive personal matters for the President and the First Lady--continuing, even though he was now on the public payroll, his Arkansas role as personal lawyer to the Clintons.136  For example, among the files in Mr. Foster's office at the time of his death were the following:

     2.     Clinton Exploratory Committee138<BR>

<P>Perhaps the most sensitive matter that Mr. Foster handled for the Clintons concerned their investment in Whitewater.  In 1978, the Clintons and James and Susan McDougal jointly purchased 233 acres in the Arkansas Ozarks.  Neither the Clintons nor the McDougals contributed any equity into the purchase.  Instead, Jim McDougal and Bill Clinton, then Attorney General and the Governor-elect of Arkansas, borrowed $20,000 from Union National Bank.  Mr. McDougal's loan officer at Union National Bank, Harry Denton, would later become the chief lending officer at Mr. McDougal's Madison Guaranty S&L.  The rest of the purchase money was financed by a mortgage of $182,611.20 from Citizens Bank of Flippin, a loan in which Union National Bank took a 50 percent participation.
<P>In June 1979, the Clintons and McDougals formed Whitewater Development Company, Inc. ("Whitewater") and eventually transferred ownership of the land to the new corporation.  The Clintons and McDougals intended to subdivide the property into lots for sale as vacation property.  Slow sales at lower than anticipated prices, however, resulted in a cumulative loss of $193,189 for Whitewater by the end of 1986.  Although the McDougals and the Clintons purportedly were equal partners in the project, their contributions to the company to cover its losses were greatly disproportionate.  Of the $194,493 that the shareholders contributed to Whitewater, the McDougals and their companies contributed $158,523, while the Clintons advanced only $35,970.
<P>When Bill Clinton ran for President in 1992, the Whitewater investment and his relationship with James McDougal became a source of political embarrassment.  Over the years, the Clintons took a series of questionable deductions on their federal income tax returns related to their investment in Whitewater.(157)  And, in March 1989, federal regulators closed Madison Guaranty S&L.  Madison's insolvency ultimately cost federal taxpayers over $60 million.(158) 
<P>On March 8, 1992, the front page of the New York Times carried this headline: "Clintons Joined S&L Operator In An Ozark Real-Estate Venture."  The article, written by Jeff Gerth, reported the ties between the Clintons and the McDougals, focusing attention on their investment in Whitewater and the questionable tax deductions taken by the Clintons in 1984 and 1985.  The Times report suggested that Whitewater may have been used as a conduit to funnel money to the Clintons or to Bill Clinton's political campaigns.
<P>Ms. Thomases played a key role in responding to the Times inquiries about Whitewater.  She and Loretta Lynch, another attorney working for the Clinton campaign, gathered information relating to Whitewater and, specifically, to Mrs. Clinton's representation of McDougal's Madison Guaranty before state regulators.
<P>Mr. Hubbell and Mr. Foster compiled information from the Rose Law Firm to help the response effort.  According to Mr. Hubbell, "the issue then, way back when, was did Mrs. Clinton ever have any contact with the Arkansas Securities Department.  When we went back to the bills, that was the only, I believe, indication on the bills of a direct contact with the Arkansas Securities Department, so I underlined that -- probably gave that to Vince."(159)
<P>Indeed, in notes taken during the 1992 campaign, Susan Thomases recorded a February 24, 1993 conversation with Webster Hubbell about the Rose Law Firm's representation of Madison.  According to the notes, Mr. Hubbell told Ms. Thomases that Mrs. Clinton did all the billing for the Rose Law Firm to Madison, and that she had numerous conferences with Jim McDougal, Madison President John Latham, and Rick Massey, then a junior associate at the firm.(160)  The notes also indicated that Mrs. Clinton had reviewed some documents and that she had one telephone conversation with Beverly Bassett Schaffer in April 1985.(161)  Ms. Thomases recorded in the margin of her notes at this point: "Acc. to time Rec."  She testified that "[t]his is my notation for according to time records,"(162) which is what Mr. Hubbell had indicated to her.(163)  Ms. Lynch confirmed that Mr. Hubbell reviewed timesheets and billing records relating to the Rose Law Firm's representation of Madison.(164)
<P>The billing records mysteriously disappeared after the 1992 campaign.  Despite four subpoenas from separate federal investigations for over two years, the billing records were not disclosed until they were "discovered" in the third floor of the White House Residence, next to Mrs. Clinton's office in the private quarters.  
<P>Eventually, the Clinton campaign released a report on the Whitewater investment authored by James Lyons, a Colorado attorney retained by the campaign.  The Lyon's report stated that, rather than gaining an illicit profit from their association with Mr. McDougal, the Clintons actually lost $68,900 on their investment in Whitewater.  Mr. Lyons apparently prepared two versions of his report.  In a confidential letter to the Clintons on April 10, 1992, he enclosed a "complete report" on Whitewater by Patten, McCarthy & Associates, an accounting firm he had retained to study Whitewater.  Mr. Lyons wrote:
<P>Please note the enclosed complete report discusses such things as the $9,000 interest deduction taken by you in 1980 (paragraph 4, page 5), lot 13 and -borrowings associated with it (paragraph 5, page 5), and the sale of 24 lots in 1985 to Ozark Air for assumption of the mortgage and an airplane (paragraph 6, page 6).  None of these items is set out in the summary report which was released to the press.(165)
Mr. Lyons advised the Clintons that there are only three copies of the complete report, and wrote that "it is my recommendation to you that you maintain the complete report in strictest confidence and do not waive either the attorney/client or accountant/client privilege which attaches to the enclosed report."(166)  Mr. Foster assisted Mr. Lyons in preparing the report.(167)
<P>The Lyons report temporarily quelled the media interest in the Whitewater story, but Clinton advisors remained worried over legal and political implications of this investment.  Among the documents in Mr. Foster's office at the time of his death was his handwritten note: "Get out of White Water."(168)  To that end, Mr. Foster, Mr. Hubbell and others in the Clinton organization met with Mr. Lyons on November 24, 1992, two weeks after Mr. Clinton was elected President.(169)
<P>The point man for the Clinton team in this effort was James Blair, General Counsel of Tyson Foods and a longtime friend and advisor to the Clintons.  Mr. Blair had also known Mr. McDougal for over 30 years and had contacted Mr. McDougal in early 1992 when questions arose about Whitewater.(170)  Mr. Blair called Mr. McDougal's attorney, Sam Heuer, and told him that "the Clintons and the McDougals needed to be totally separated over the Whitewater thing."(171)  According to Mr. Blair, he suggested that Mr. McDougal pay a nominal amount to buy the Clintons' interest in Whitewater.(172)  "I think we settled on a thousand dollars as an appropriate nominal amount."(173)  There was one problem: "McDougal doesn't have a thousand dollars."(174)  Mr. Blair then told Mr. Heuer, "[W]ell, what the heck, I will loan him the thousand dollars.  I'll just Fed Ex you a check to your trust account.  And I believe that's what I did."(175)  Mr. McDougal has never repaid Mr. Blair.(176)
<P>On December 22, 1993, Mr. McDougal and the Clintons executed the transaction to get the Clintons out of Whitewater.  Mr. Blair then assigned Mr. Foster the task of contacting the accountants and preparing the Clintons' tax returns.(177)  The issue facing Mr. Foster in the months preceding his death was how to treat the $1000 sale on the Clintons' 1992 tax returns.  The basic dilemma stemmed from the Clintons' claim, bolstered by the publicly released Lyons report, that they had incurred significant losses on their investment in Whitewater.  The problem with declaring the loss on the Clintons' tax return was the lack of a proper basis with which to calculate the cost of the venture to the Clintons.  Despite their claim that they were 50% partners in the venture, the Clintons had contributed less than 25% of the funds used to cover Whitewater's losses.
<P>Among the documents in Mr. Foster's office at the time of death were his notes of conversations with the Clintons' accountant, Yoly Redden.(178)  The notes, in Mr. Foster's hand, identified the tax problem as a "can of worms you shouldn't open."(179)  His notes in the file outlined the basic tax issues the Clintons faced in connection with Whitewater:
<P>"1)<P>What was nature of deductions
<P><P>A.  How deduct interest/principal payments for corp.?

<P>2)<P>Can you use contribution which predated incorporation?

<P>3)<P>Contribution/advancements of $68,900 to the McD

<P>4)<P>Inability to utilize $8000 capital loss"(180)
Mr. Foster's objective was to avoid calling attention to Whitewater during the annual audit of the President and Mrs. Clinton's tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service audit.(181)  One approach was simply to report a wash, that is, to show no loss and no gain from the venture, thereby obviating the need for any tax treatment.  The problem with such treatment, however, was that it would have bolstered the allegation that the Clintons were insulated from Whitewater losses and thus the company was a vehicle for Mr. McDougal to channel funds to the Clintons.  In notes titled "Discussion Points," Mr. Foster wrote:
<P>1)<P>An argument that they were protected against loss:
<P><P>A)  wash is consistent with this theory(182)

But Mr. Foster did not a have a proper cost basis with which to calculate the Clintons' true losses or gains.  His discussion points continued:
<P>2)<P>Improper to reduce basis by improper tax benefit

<P>3)<P>Computation of economic loss was based, in part, on assumptions
<P><P>Whereas computation of tax gain or loss must be defensible in audit.(183)
<P>Therein lay the problem.  To claim a loss based on economic assumptions, as the Lyons' report did, was one thing.1   But to claim a loss on the Clintons' 1992 tax returns without proper support and documentation increased the likelihood of calling attention to Whitewater during the IRS audit--of opening the can of worms that Mr. Foster and the Clintons' accountant wished to keep sealed.(184)  Mr. Foster's notes summarized the options as follows:
<P>"10<P>Options
<P><P>$1000 basis<P>so no tax effect
<P><P>but is arbitrary & still risks audit
<P><P><P><P>    vs
<P><P>0 basis w/ $1000 gain
<P><P>avoids any audit of issue"(185)
In a letter to Mr. Foster days before the tax returns were due, Ms. Redden, the accountant the Clintons hired to handle Whitewater tax issues, wrote:  "Because of the numerous problems with Whitewater records and the commingling of funds with other companies and individuals, I believe many explanations may have to be made if we claim a loss."(186) This letter, addressed to Mr. Foster, was not among the documents in Mr. Foster's office that the White House produced to the Special Committee.  It was obtained by the Special Committee through another source.(187)  Ms. Redden testified that after the Clintons were in the White House she had a number of discussions with Mr. Foster concerning tax issues related to Whitewater.(188)  The main focus of these numerous communications was the tax basis for the Clintons' contributions to Whitewater and how to treat the $1000 payment.(189)
<P>The Clintons' final tax returns for 1992 reported a capital gain of $1000 from the sale of stock to Mr. McDougal.(190)  According to Ms. Redden, "I think we need to claim no gain or a loss."(191)  Mr. Foster did not follow her advice, however, because he was also consulting with another accountant, and "[a]t the end we compromised what we were going to put in the return in connection with Whitewater."(192)
<P>For reasons unknown, on June 16, 1993, Mr. McDougal called Mr. Foster at the White House.  Unable to reach Mr. Foster, he left a message with his secretary: "re tax returns of HRC, VWF and McDougal."(193)  It is unclear whether Mr. Foster returned Mr. McDougal's telephone call, and it is unclear why Mr. McDougal contacted Mr. Foster about Mr. Foster's tax returns.
<P>Mr. Foster also worked with Ricki Seidman, then Deputy Assistant to the President and Deputy Director of Communications, on the Whitewater  matter in the first half of 1993.  In June 1994, Ms. Seidman told the FBI the following about her relationship with Mr. Foster and her involvement in Whitewater:
<P>Seidman was asked about FOSTER's involvement with Whitewater.  She said the only Whitewater issue she could recall was in April, 1993 in connection with the CLINTONs tax returns.  The tax returns show that the CLINTONs had divested themselves of their interest in Whitewater.  SEIDMAN's involvement was from a "communications perspective".  The Whitewater issue had surfaced during the campaign, interest had then ended, and it was believed the tax returns would bring the Whitewater issue into the "public domain again".  SEIDMAN said there was discussion regarding the "soundest way" to seek closure to the issue.  The options considered were (1) declare a loss; (2) declare an even split; and (3) declare the Clintons received a $1000 gain.  SEIDMAN said she and FOSTER were discussing these options.  She remembered attending meetings at WILLIAMS and CONNOLY [sic] on the issue.(194)
<P>The Clintons' Whitewater investment created other problems that occupied Mr. Foster's time as Deputy White House Counsel.  Among the documents found in Mr. Foster's office following his death were campaign disclosure forms, required by law, accounting the personal finances of the Clintons and of their campaign organization.(195)  On January 10, 1992, the Clinton for President campaign filed a disclosure form that failed to disclose that the Clintons had personally guaranteed a loan to the Whitewater Development Corporation.(196)  Yoly Redden, the Clintons' accountant, testified that she assisted the campaign in preparing the disclosure statements.(197)  According to Ms. Redden, there were discussions about the Clintons' Whitewater investment, and a decision was made to omit it from the statements.  "We were told, it was our understanding that the Whitewater investment was worthless, they were not going to get anything out of it at that point in time."(198)
<P>On April 6, 1992, after the New York Times article detailing the Clintons' Whitewater investment, the campaign revised the statement to disclose the Clintons' personal liability for the Whitewater loan.(199)  The revision, however, did not deal with the more troublesome issue concerning disclosure:  how to treat the McDougals' disproportionate share of Whitewater losses?  By assuming more than 50 percent of Whitewater losses, the McDougals had in effect given money to the Clintons, their supposed equal partners in Whitewater.  This transfer could be treated as a gift, a loan, or income.  Although the Clintons would incur a tax liability only if the transfer was considered income, campaign laws required disclosure of all three categories, a requirement that had not been met with respect to the McDougals' contributions to Whitewater.  At one point, Mr. Foster complained to his friend and the Clintons' confidant, Susan Thomases, about the poor condition of the Clintons' Whitewater records.(200) 
<P>Mr. Foster was working on another matter involving the Clintons' financial investments in the months and days preceding his death.  On June 18, 1993, USA Today published an article on Hillary Clinton's investment in a limited partnership named Value Partners, managed by Smith Capital Management of Little Rock, Arkansas.(201)  The article noted the success of the investment for Mrs. Clinton, but erroneously reported that Mrs. Clinton's "investments are now held in a blind trust."(202)  A copy of the article was found in Mr. Foster's office following his death.  Mr. Foster personally circled two places where the article asserted that Mrs. Clinton's assets had been placed in a blind trust.  He sent copies of the article to Lisa Caputo, Mrs. Clinton's press secretary, Ricki Seidman, White House Deputy Communications Director,2  and Margaret Williams, Mrs. Clinton's Chief of Staff.  His handwritten comments identified a problem:  "The assets are not yet in a blind trust.  The document has been approved but is not signed yet, pending working out some details."(203)  The article apparently bothered Mr. Foster enough to prompt him to complain immediately to Bill Smith, the head of Smith Capital Management.  Smith replied apologetically that his company does not talk to the press about the First Lady's investment, "particularly during the recent flurry of articles and interviews regarding the holdings of health care stocks in Value Partners."(204)
<P>The "flurry of articles" concerned the strategy of Value Partners to profit by selling stocks "short."  A short-seller borrows stocks from his broker to sell at current market price, anticipating that the value of the stock will fall.  When the price does fall, the short-seller buys the lower-priced stock to return to his broker, profiting from the difference in price.  On May 31, 1993, the Wall Street Journal disclosed that Value Partners actively sold short several health care stocks.(205)  At this time, Mrs. Clinton was directing the administration's efforts to reform the nation's health care system.  The Administration's proposal depressed the value of health care stocks.3   Value Partners was structured as a limited partnership, and no evidence exists that Mrs. Clinton directed or reviewed the fund's investment decisions.  However, Mrs. Clinton's investment amounted to nearly $100,000 in a fund that dedicated 13% of its $1.3 million portfolio to short positions in health care stocks.(206)  Mrs. Clinton thus came under media criticism for personally benefiting from her high-profile public campaign. 
<P>In addition to an appearance of impropriety, the investment in Value Partner posed a potential legal problem.  Title 18, Section 208 of the United States Code exposes an executive officer or employee to felony liability for participating "personally and substantially" in a "particular matter" in which he is aware of a financial interest.  Mr. Foster apparently had advised Mrs. Clinton that she need not be concerned by this criminal statute because she was not an officer or employee of the executive branch.(207)  In reaching this conclusion, Mr. Foster apparently did not consult with the Office of Legal Counsel of the Department of Justice, and ignored a contrary opinion issued by that office 17 years earlier.(208)  
<P>Mr. Foster's conclusion that the First Lady was not covered by government ethics laws also conflicted with the position of the White House in Association of American Physicians and Surgeons v. Clinton.(209) That litigation sought to compel the White House to release the documents and deliberations of Mrs. Clinton's health care task force.  The Federal Advisory Committee Act ("FACA") compels such public disclosure if a government agency, like the health care task force, consults advisers who are not government employees.(210)  The plaintiffs alleged that Mrs. Clinton is such a nongovernmental adviser and thus the records of the task force were covered by FACA.  In order to avoid disclosure, the White House argued that Mrs. Clinton was indeed a federal official and therefore FACA did not apply to the task force.  The United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit agreed with the White House.  Recognizing the potential spillover effect of the holding, however, the court cautioned in a footnote: "We do not need to consider whether Mrs. Clinton's presence on the Task Force violates . . . any conflict of interest statutes."(211)   
<P>The matter apparently weighed heavily in Mr. Foster's mind.  The Wall Street Journal, in a series of editorials, criticized Mr. Foster for his role with respect to the Health Care Task Force.(212)  Mr. Foster complained to James Lyons, a Foster friend and former legal adviser to the Clinton campaign, that "the press had been particular vicious in their attacks on members of the Rose Law Firm."(213)  In particular, Mr. Foster complained about criticisms for his handling of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons v. Clinton litigation.(214)  Mr. Lyons told the FBI in an interview:
<P>FOSTER won a victory for the Task Force (and by association, for HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON) on that matter and the Wall Street Journal accused him of "sharp tactics".  LYONS advised that the allegation really bothered Foster.(215)
In the note apparently discovered in Mr. Foster's briefcase six days after his death, Mr. Foster wrote, "The Wall Street Journal editors lie without consequence."(216) 
<P>Just before his suicide, Mr. Foster concentrated on finalizing plans to place the First Family's investments in a blind trust, which would have remedied the ethical and legal problems posed by the Value Partners investment.  In Mr. Foster's papers was a facsimile from Brantly Buck, a partner of the Rose Law Firm, who had been retained to assist in the creation of the blind trust.  The facsimile, dated July 19, 1993, the day before Mr. Foster's suicide, forwarded draft statements of financial objectives for the blind trust.  White House phone records indicated that Mr. Buck called Mr. Foster twice on the morning of his suicide.(217)
<P>Mr. Foster's phone log also showed that he received a call from James Lyons, the author of the Whitewater report for the Clinton campaign, at 11:11 a.m. on July 20, 1993, the morning of Mr. Foster's death.(218)  When contacted by the Park Police, Mr. Lyons said that he had spoken with Mr. Foster on July 18, and they had agreed to meet for dinner on July 21.  According to a Park Police report, "Lyons had told Foster he would call him and let him know when he would leave Denver and arrive in Washington.  This is the reason for the phone message on the morning of July 20, 1993."(219)  In a later interview with the FBI, Mr. Lyons provided more detail into his scheduled dinner with Mr. Foster.  Mr. Foster was very concerned about the Travelgate affair and regarded himself and Bill Kennedy as potential witnesses in the matter.  According to the FBI report, Mr. Foster "felt strongly that White House should hire outside counsel to be handling the Travelgate matter for this reason.  He also believed that he would be needing a personal attorney to represent him in the matter."(220)  It was to seek personal representation that Mr. Foster purportedly scheduled dinner with Mr. Lyons.  Mr. Foster, however, also complained to Mr. Lyons about the extent to which he and other members of the Counsel's office were handling personal matters for the Clintons:
<P>FOSTER believed that private sector attorneys should be handling many of the matters they [White House Counsel's office] were handling, both for ethical and workload reasons.  The CLINTON administration had called for a 25 percent cut.  Under the BUSH administration the Counsel's office had 18 to 20 lawyers at its peak and when CLINTON took office there were only 6 or 7.4   There were many discussions about the composition and character of the associates in the Counsel's office and everybody was spread incredibly thin.(221)
<P>Linda Tripp, Mr. Nussbaum's executive assistant, testified that she approached Mr. Nussbaum and questioned him, based on her experience in the previous administration, about the inordinate amount of time that Mr. Foster seemed to spend on the Clintons' personal matters.  Ms. Tripp believed that Mr. Foster worked mostly on personal matters for the Clintons.  According to Ms. Tripp, "I questioned the role of the deputy counsel in the Clinton Administration as opposed to what I had perceived it to be in the Bush Administration."(222)  Indeed, C. Boyden Gray, President Bush's White House Counsel testified that, under President Bush, "[p]ersonal, what I would call personal work, taxes, blind trusts, problems involving his residence, his house in Maine, for example, those matters would be handled by his private counsel.  How to deal with the book royalties from Mrs. Bush's book, for example; they would be handled by his personal lawyer."(223)  When asked why, Gray explained that "I don't think the taxpayers should pay for personal matters, I suppose, is the short way to answer it."(224)
<P>II.  The Traditional Independence of the White House Counsel's Office
<P>The Office of the White House Counsel originated from presidential custom.  The Reorganization Act of 1939,(225) which authorized the modern White House staff, did not mention a legal adviser to the President.  The first such legal adviser came to the White House under President Franklin Delano Roosevelt.  When Roosevelt was governor of New York, he had a close personal adviser in Samuel Rosenman, who held the title of "Counsel to the Governor."(226)  Upon his election as President, Roosevelt prevailed on Mr. Rosenman, then a judge on New York's highest court, to join his staff.  President Roosevelt wanted to give Mr. Rosenman the title of "Counsel to the President," the Washington equivalent of his title in Albany.  However, Attorney General Francis Biddle objected, "`on the grounds that such a title would undercut the role of the Attorney General as the President's chief legal adviser.'"(227)  Consequently, Mr. Rosenman was given the title of "Special Counsel to the President."
<P>Despite its origins in the personal, rather than institutional, needs of the President, the Counsel's office has become firmly established within the White House.(228)  The role of this office has varied from administration to administration.  Mr. Rosenman, consistent with the practice in Albany, served not just as President Roosevelt's legal counselor, but as one of his key advisers.  He was the principal speech writer and spent most of his time drafting the President's public statements--a task for which he recruited Clark Clifford as his assistant.
<P>Mr. Clifford continued the tradition as special counsel to President Truman.  He later recounted that his job was to do "[w]hatever the President wanted."   Mr. Clifford saw his role "as an adviser or counselor, and not as an administrator or bureaucrat."(229)  His advice to President Truman was not strictly legal, but often political.  Secretary of State Marshall complained to President Truman about Mr. Clifford's participation in White House discussions on U.S policy toward Palestine: "I fear that the only reason Clifford is here is that he is pressing a political consideration with regard to this issue.  I don't think politics should play any part in this."(230)  
<P>Similarly, Theodore Sorenson, special counsel to President Kennedy, and Harry McPherson, special counsel to President Johnson, were among the principal policy and political advisers to each president.  Both participated fully in the major deliberations of their administrations.  In 1985, when organizers of a conference of presidential chiefs of staff discovered that no such position existed in the White House under Presidents Kennedy and Johnson, they invited the two advisers who most closely approximated that role, Mr. Sorenson and Mr. McPherson.(231)  Myer Feldman held the post, with the title of "Counsel to the President," for one year between Mr. Sorenson and Mr. McPherson.  For reasons unknown, Mr. McPherson retained the old title of Special Counsel.  When Richard Nixon became President, he appointed John Ehrlichman as "Counsel to the President."  A year later, however, the title was discarded again and three top advisers--Murray Chotiner, Harry Dent, and Charles Colson--held the title of "Special Counsel" simultaneously.
<P>In 1971, President Nixon appointed John Dean as White House Counsel and relied on Mr. Dean primarily for legal advice on particular matters.  While Lloyd Cutler, President Carter's White House Counsel, noted that his job primarily concerned the legal aspects of matters that came to the President's attention,(232) he also played a "Clark Clifford role" in the White House.(233)  That means that "I can dispense advice and get involved in any question that interests me."(234)  Even with Mr. Cutler, however, it was clear that the modern White House counsel was no longer the equivalent of the chief of staff, as Mr. Sorensen was under President Kennedy.  In the Reagan White House, each of the three successive counsels--Fred Fielding, Peter Wallison, and A.B. Culvahouse--reported to the President's respective chiefs of staff--James Baker, Donald Regan, and Howard Baker.  Although C. Boyden Gray reportedly enjoyed special influence in the Bush White House stemming from his long-standing relationship with the President, he generally viewed himself not as a political adviser, but as counsel on legal problems.(235)  
<P>Against this historical background, President Clinton appointed Bernard Nussbaum to head the Counsel's office.  In addition to being Counsel, Mr. Nussbaum held the honorific "Assistant to the President," a title not given to any previous holder of the office.  Mr. Nussbaum had worked with Mrs. Clinton--he as the senior lawyer, she as a young law school graduate--on the staff of the House Judiciary Committee Impeachment Inquiry, the Watergate Committee.(236)  By his own account, Mr. Nussbaum was among the President's inner circle of advisers and enjoyed free access to the President.  "I see the President any time I think it's reasonably necessary.  Unfortunately, it's been necessary too many times."(237)
<P>Mr. Nussbaum's background as a private lawyer defined where his loyalty laid as White House Counsel.  "When you're down to one client--the President--the only thing that counts is your relationship with that client."(238)5   When Mr. Nussbaum resigned from his office, he wrote to the President:
<P>As I know you know, from the day I became Counsel, my sole objective was to serve you well as effectively as I could, consistent with the rules of law, standards of ethics, and the highest traditions of the Bar. . . .  Unfortunately, as a result of controversy generated by those who do not understand, nor wish to understand the role and obligations of a lawyer, even one active as White House Counsel, I now believe I can best serve you by returning to private life.(239)
Mr. Nussbaum has explained elsewhere that "[t]he principal source of that misunderstanding, I think, is the failure to appreciate . . . that fact that the president's lawyer is a lawyer, and that every lawyer--even one representing the president in his official capacity--has an obligation to represent his client faithfully and zealously."(240)  Those who criticized his conduct in office "have it exactly backward:  The problem is not that lawyers who are in the public arena are too zealous in representing their clients; it is that they--and others in the public arena--are often not zealous enough, because of a fear of appearances, of negative publicity and, consequently, of unpopularity, of loss of position."(241)
<P>Whether or not Mr. Nussbaum is correct in his ethical vision or his assessment of the public interest, the mandate of Resolution 120 requires the Special Committee to answer a more immediate question: whether, in their zeal to serve and protect their clients, President and Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Nussbaum and other White House officials engaged in any improper conduct in handling the papers in Mr. Foster's office following his death.

 <H2>    SUMMARY OF THE EVIDENCE</H2>
<P>I.  The Contents of Vincent Foster's Office at the Time of his Death
<P>The full contents of Mr. Foster's office at the time of his death will perhaps never be known.  That is so because Mr. Nussbaum, in cleaning out the files in Mr. Foster's office following his death, did not prepare an inventory of materials reviewed or removed.  Stephen Neuwirth did prepare an inventory of certain files in Mr. Foster's office, but only after Mr. Nussbaum and Margaret Williams had removed certain files to President and Mrs. Clinton's private quarters on the third floor of the White House Residence.
<P>Deborah Gorham, Mr. Foster's secretary, testified that, in her first trip into Mr. Foster's office after his death, she opened the drawer containing the Clintons' personal documents.  "I saw Pendaflex folders and file folders, and I did not see an index that normally would have been there listing the names of the files."(242)  According to Ms. Gorham, she maintained "indexes for all file drawers, that I recall, and it listed the content, the names of each of the folders in each drawer."(243)  She did not see the index in the drawer, where she normally kept it. 
<P>The Special Committee took steps to locate this missing index.  The White House produced three indices of files in Foster's office.  A six-page index is dated July 22, 1993, on the first page.  The final page of the index contained the following listing:6 
<P><P>First Family - SF 278

<P><P>First Family - 1994 Income Tax
<P><P>Returns

<P><P>First Family - General

<P><P>HRC - CLE/Arkansas Law
<P><P>License 

<P><P>First Couple - Blind Trust
<P>
<P><P>First Family - Arkansas Home

<P><P>POTUS - Arkansas Office

<P><P>WJC - Passport

<P><P>WJC - Papers

<P><P>First Family - SF 278 pre-POTUS(244)
<P>The White House represented to the Special Committee that this index "was in a box identified by Tom Castleton as containing documents from Cabinet I of Mr. Foster's office."(245)  Ms. Gorham, however, testified that the document is not one that she would have created.  "Certainly the typeface, the font and the style and the names of the subjects are familiar, but on your first entry where it reads `First Family 1994 Income Tax,' the word `Returns,' which should be, I believe, a part of that sentence after `Tax,' has been returned to the left margin."(246)  Raising the specter that the index had been altered, Ms. Gorham testified that she would not have formatted her document in such a fashion.(247)
<P>The White House produced yet another six-page index, which was found apparently "in a box identified by Mr. Castleton as containing materials from Ms. Gorham's desk."(248)  The last page of this index contained the same list of files as in the first index described above.(249)7   However, the format of the list is different.  "First Family 1994 Income Tax Returns" and "HRC - CLE/Arkansas Law License" are each typed on one line, without left returns breaking up the entries--a format consistent with the way Ms. Gorham would have maintained the document.  Although the index "is consistent with the typeface and certainly the names of the subjects and the type font that was used," Ms. Gorham was not sure if she had prepared the document.(250)  This second index, like the first, was dated July 22, 1993, on the first page.  Ms. Gorham testified that "on the White House system, that date would have had to have been manually entered."(251)  Ms. Gorham also testified that she would not have revised the index after Mr. Foster's death,(252) and that she did not revise the index on July 22, 1993.(253)
<P>Neither index contained any reference to a file on Whitewater Development Corporation.  According to Ms. Gorham, she created her index file in the first two weeks of April, several months prior to Mr. Foster's death,(254) and the index listed all the files in the drawer containing the First Family's personal documents.(255)  She also remembered that the Whitewater file was among those in Foster's office at that time.(256)8 
<P>The third index(257) produced by the White House listed, among other things, the same ten files contained in the other two indices, but in a slightly different order and with an additional notation for certain files:
<P><P>POTUS - SF 278<BR>
<P><P>First Family - 1994 Income Tax Returns (removed)<BR>
<P><P>HRC - CLE/Arkansas Law License (removed)<BR>
<P><P>First Couple - Blind Trust (removed)<BR>
<P><P>First Family - Arkansas Home (removed)<BR>
<P><P>WJC - Papers (removed)<BR>
<P><P>First Family - SF278 pre-POTUS (removed)<BR>
<P><P>Clinton Mansion (removed)<BR>
<P><P>POTUS - Arkansas Office<BR>
<P><P>WJC - Passport(258)<BR>
<P>This index, labelled "VWF - Existing Files" on the first page, contained the following line on the last page: "Updated 10/25/93".  Like the other two indices, it did not contain any reference to a Whitewater file.  At the Special Committee's request, the White House conducted a search of the back-up disks and tapes of Ms. Gorham's files, downloaded when she left the White House in late 1993.  The third index was among the files contained in those disks and tapes, and the file directory information indicated that it was last updated on 10/25/93 at 2:14 p.m.  The first and second indices, however, were not among the files in Ms. Gorham's computer at the time it was downloaded.  An analysis of latent data on the computer's hard drive by an FBI expert yielded no additional useful information.(259)
<P>Ms. Gorham testified that she did not see the index she maintained for the Clintons' personal files in Foster's office on July 22, nor anytime thereafter.(260)  The Committee was never able to ascertain what happened to this index -- a critical piece of evidence concerning the contents of Mr. Foster's office at the time of his death.
<P>When Mr. Nussbaum reviewed documents in Mr. Foster's office on July 22 before Justice Department officials, he did not identify every document in the office, even generically, for the law enforcement officers.  His scatter-shot identification process frustrated the officers. 
<P>The following colloquy occurred at the Special Committee's August 1, 1995, hearing:
<P>Mr. Giuffra:  Do you believe that Ms. Nussbaum described every document in Mr. Foster's office?
<P>Mr. Markland:  No, sir, I don't.
<P>Mr. Giuffra:  So he only identified some of the documents that were contained in Mr. Foster's office?
<P>Mr. Markland:  Yes.  Or he would go through a file drawer and just broadly say that they were strictly White House business.(261)
Agent Salter corroborated Mr. Markland's testimony, telling the Special Committee: "No, I don't believe he had looked at everything in the office."(262)  Mr. Nussbaum maintained, however, that he described every file in the office, including the Clintons' personal files.  "I said these were Clinton personal files.  I said these involve investments, taxes, other financial matters and the like.  Included was a file on the Clintons' Whitewater real estate investment."(263)
<P>Two persons kept careful notes of the document review on July 22.  Michael Spafford took nine pages of handwritten notes apparently listing the files and documents that Mr. Nussbaum called out during the meeting.  His meticulous notes listed, for example, paper clips and scotch tape from Vince Foster's left drawers, and the contents of Mr. Foster's trash bag.(264)  Likewise, Cliff Sloan took 16 pages of notes during the meeting.(265)  The notes taken by Mr. Sloan, which he later typed up,(266) tracked Mr. Spafford's notes, but at times provided some more detail both in the number of items listed and in the description of each item.  Neither set of notes recorded the specific name of the files or any description of the documents eventually transferred to the White House residence and later to Williams & Connolly.  
<P>Senator Kerry specifically questioned Mr. Nussbaum about files located in Mr. Foster's credenza.  Mr. Nussbaum testified that he reviewed all of the files in the credenza and described them to the law enforcement officials.  "I said this is a tax file, or this is an investment file, like that.  I didn't describe every piece of paper in the file.  I would flip through the file to see if there's a suicide note or extortion note, but I would give a general description of the file and I would flip through the file."(267)  
<P>Mr. Spafford's and Mr. Sloan's notes of Mr. Nussbaum's review, however, cast doubt on Mr. Nussbaum's testimony.  Mr. Nussbaum provided detailed descriptions of a number of items in the credenza, while identifying the Clinton personal files--apparently the bulk of the files in the credenza--generally as "matters re First Family."(268)  Following are Mr. Spafford's handwritten notes of what Mr. Nussbaum described in the credenza:
<P>Credensa: on R<BR>
          matters re First Family<BR>
          mostly files re GC matters<BR>

<P>     Although Mr. Sloan's typed notes did not identify the various locations, the listing was similar to Mr. Spafford's:

     The files transferred to the White House Residence and eventually taken to Williams & Connolly included a file labelled "WHITEWATER DEVELOPMENT, Personal and Confidential VWF."  Law enforcement officials did not recall Mr. Nussbaum mentioning Whitewater during the review of documents in Mr. Foster's office on July 22,(271) and the notes taken by Mr. Sloan and Mr. Spafford contained no reference to a Whitewater file.9 
<P>Mr. Nussbaum claimed that he had no knowledge that Mr. Foster was working on any matter involving Whitewater.(272)  Mr. Nussbaum emphasized that "[t]he Whitewater matter, which subsequently became the focus of so much attention, was not on our minds or even in our consciousness in July 1993."(273)  He repeated that although Whitewater had surfaced briefly during the 1992 campaign, "in 1993, Whitewater was not on my screen, nor, as far as I know, was it the subject of discussion in the White House.  And if it was, it was something I would have known."(274)
<P>Evidence obtained by the Banking Committee during the summer of 1994 flatly contradicts Mr. Nussbaum's testimony.  Resolution Trust Corporation ("RTC") Senior Vice President William H. Roelle testified that, upon taking office, former Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Roger Altman directed the staff to inform him of all important or potentially high-visibility issues.(275)  According to Mr. Roelle, on or about March 23, 1993, he told Mr. Altman that the RTC had sent a criminal referral mentioning the Clintons to the Justice Department.(276)
<P>The White House produced files to the Banking Committee showing that Mr. Altman immediately sent Mr. Nussbaum two facsimiles about Whitewater.  The first facsimile, sent on March 23, 1993 with a handwritten cover sheet, forwarded an "RTC Clip Sheet" of a March 9, 1992 New York Times article with the headline, "Clinton Defends Real-Estate Deal."(277)  The article reported the responses that Bill Clinton, then a presidential candidate, offered to an earlier Times report detailing the Clintons' investment in Whitewater and their ties to Jim and Susan McDougal.
<P>The second facsimile from Mr. Altman to Mr. Nussbaum, sent the next day, March 24, 1993, forwarded the same article that was sent the day before and portions of the earlier Times report--an article dated March 8, 1992, by Jeff Gerth entitled "Clintons Joined S&L Operator in an Ozark Real-Estate Venture," which originally broke the story in the news media.(278)
<P>According to the report of the Banking Committee on the communications between officials of the White House and the Treasury Department:  
<P>Mr. Altman testified that he did not recall having sent either facsimile to Mr. Nussbaum.  Mr. Nussbaum testified that he did not recall having received either facsimile from Mr. Altman.  Mr. Altman and Mr. Nussbaum both testified that they had no recollection of having spoken to one another during March 1993 about the articles contained in the facsimiles or the subject of those articles.  Nevertheless, Mr. Altman and Mr. Nussbaum both testified that the facsimiles were apparently sent and received by their respective offices.(279)
<P>Before the Special Committee, Senator Bond asked Mr. Nussbaum specifically about the apparent contradiction between his assertion that he had no knowledge of Whitewater at the time of Mr. Foster's death and the existence of Mr. Altman's facsimiles.  Mr. Nussbaum maintained that he did not know of the facsimiles.(280)  He testified that he first heard of Whitewater in late September 1993.(281)  "So, in July of 1993, I had no knowledge and no memory of receiving a fax from Roger Altman, and Whitewater, as I said in my statement, was not on my mind nor, do I believe, on anyone else's mind in the White House in July of 1993."(282)
<P>There is further evidence, however, that Mr. Foster was not the only White House official working on personal matters for the Clintons involving Whitewater.  Until July of 1993, Ricki Seidman was Deputy Assistant to the President and Deputy Director of Communications.  She reported to the FBI in 1994 that she and Mr. Foster had worked together on Whitewater issues before his death:
<P>Seidman was asked about FOSTER's involvement with Whitewater.  She said the only Whitewater issue she could recall was in April, 1993 in connection with the CLINTONs tax returns.  The tax returns show that the CLINTONs had divested themselves of their interest in Whitewater.  SEIDMAN's involvement was from a "communications perspective".(283)
Ms. Seidman explained that she discussed various options with Mr. Foster for treating the transaction on the Clintons' 1992 tax returns.  Ms. Seidman confirmed notes found in Mr. Foster's office at the time of his death summarizing the three options under consideration: (1) report a loss on the Whitewater investment; (2) not report any gains or losses; or (3) declare a $1000 gain to the Clintons from their transfer of all Whitewater stock to Jim McDougal in December, 1992.(284)
<P>In addition, SBA Associate Administrator Wayne Foren testified that, in early May 1993, he briefed Erskine Bowles, the new SBA Administrator about the agency's ongoing investigation of David Hale's Capital Management Services because the case involved President Clinton.(285)  Shortly thereafter, Mr. Bowles told Mr. Foren that he had briefed White House Chief of Staff Mack McLarty about the case.(286)  Although Mr. Bowles did not recall being briefed by Mr. Foren about Capital Management(287) or talking to Mr. McLarty about the case,(288) Mr. Foren's account was corroborated by his deputy, Charles Shepperson.(289)  Mr. McLarty's calendar indicated that Mr. Bowles had two meetings with Mr. McLarty at the White House in early May 1993.(290)
<P>When asked why Mr. Nussbaum prevented law enforcement officials from looking at documents in Mr. Foster's office on July 22, Detective Markland replied: "In my mind, at this time, I believe he was afraid we would have uncovered some indication of the Whitewater situation and other things that Mr. Foster was involved with that are just now coming to light."(291)
<P>Mr. Nussbaum claimed that he did not seek to conceal damaging information about the Whitewater matter.  In his view, the groundswell of interest in the handling of documents after Mr. Foster's death resulted from "the unfair linkage of two separate, disparate events,"(292) the way he reviewed and handled documents in Mr. Foster's office and the emergence of the Whitewater investigation in late 1993.(293)
<P>Yet, as early as the spring 1993, White House officials expected the then-dormant Whitewater issue to reemerge in the media.  According to the FBI report of Ms. Seidman's interview, in April 1993, "it was believed the tax returns would bring the Whitewater issue into the `public domain again'.  SEIDMAN said there was discussion regarding the `soundest way' to seek closure to the issue."(294)10   In addition to Ms. Seidman's sworn statement, common sense casts doubt on Mr. Nussbaum's testimony that Whitewater was not on the White House's radar screen in 1993.  Whitewater was a major issue in the 1992 campaign, and the Clintons went to the extraordinary step of retaining an outside attorney to issue a report on the matter.  The "unfair linkage," in Mr. Nussbaum's words, so obvious when investigations relating to Whitewater were reported later in 1993, was never made in the weeks following Mr. Foster's death precisely because Mr. Nussbaum concealed any mention of Whitewater from law enforcement officials.  There is little doubt that Mr. Nussbaum foresaw the embarrassment and political liability of such a linkage between Mr. Foster's death and Whitewater when he examined the documents in Mr. Foster's office.  It is against this backdrop of motive that the events and actions following Mr. Foster's death must be examined.

<P>II.  July 20, 1993
A.<P>The Discovery of Mr. Foster's Body.
<P>At about 5:30 p.m. on July 20, 1993, the driver of a white utility van stopped at Fort Marcy Park off the George Washington Parkway in Virginia to relieve himself.(295)  The man parked his car next to a white two-door Honda with a blue interior and Arkansas plates.(296)  He walked about 200 yards away from the parking lot.  As he was urinating, the man noticed the body of a white male wearing a white dress shirt and grey pants.(297)  Traces of blood were visible on the man's face, and the right shoulder was stained light purple.(298)
<P>The man then returned to his van to find a telephone.(299)  He drove to nearby Turkey Run Park, where he found two uniformed Park Service employees.(300)  He told the Park Service employees that he had found a body and asked one of them to call the police.(301)  One of the Park Service employees walked to a nearby telephone and called the police.(302)  
<P>The Fairfax County Public Safety Communications Center received a 911 call at approximately 6:00 p.m. on July 20, 1993, reporting a dead body lying near a cannon in Fort Marcy Park.(303)  The dispatcher relayed this information to the Park Police and the Fairfax County Emergency Response Team.(304)  Park Police Officer Kevin Forshill responded to the call from his post in Langley, Virginia.(305)  Officer Forshill and two medical technicians searched the area near the two cannons, while another group of medical technicians searched elsewhere in the park.(306)  Near the second cannon, Officer Forshill found the body.(307)  He then notified the dispatcher and requested detectives to be at the scene.
<P>Park Police investigators Renee Apt, Cheryl Braun, and John Rolla responded to Officer Forshill's call at 6:35 p.m.(308)  Sergeant Braun, the senior investigator, assigned Detective Rolla to investigate the death scene while she examined the parking lot.  Their preliminary view was that Mr. Foster's death was a suicide.(309)  Under standard procedure, however, the Park Police treated the investigation as a possible homicide.  The Park Police continued to treat the investigation as a possible homicide until August 10, 1993, when the Park Police officially ruled Mr. Foster's death a suicide.(310) 
<P> In a death investigation, standard procedures called for investigators to define the crime scene and to prevent any unauthorized access to the area.(311)  In the case of a suspected suicide, the investigators considered relevant "the person's home, their office, their car, places where they frequent would be relevant; any place where they would leave information about them, their state of mind, a place for them to leave their note, if they leave a note." (312)  As a necessary precaution, such places should be preserved "as a matter of routine police procedure" in order to ensure the integrity of the evidence.(313)  Sergeant Braun thus immediately requested that the main gate of the fort be closed to prevent entries into the area.(314)
<P>When Detective Rolla arrived at the death scene, the area around Mr. Foster's body was taped off.(315)  The officers who first arrived on the scene briefed Detective Rolla and gave him several Polaroid photographs of the scene.(316)  Detective Rolla then made a careful visual examination of the body and conducted a thorough inventory of the physical evidence on the body.(317)  Detective Rolla then took his own Polaroid pictures of the crime scene and, when the Fairfax County Medical Examiner arrived, helped him move the body for a preliminary examination.(318)
<P>Sergeant Braun interviewed a couple whose car was parked near Mr. Foster's Honda, and another officer canvassed the area for other witnesses.(319)  All the items in Mr. Foster's car were catalogued: a wallet with $300 in cash, his White House identification, and a piece of paper with the names and telephone numbers of three doctors; two empty beer bottles, a canvas bag, a folded map of Washington D.C., and cassette tapes in the car interior; Mr. Foster's daughter's college papers and textbooks in the trunk; and sunglasses and empty cigarette boxes in the glove compartment.(320)  With the discovery of Mr. Foster's White House identification, Sergeant Braun considered the case a high priority investigation and proceeded with heightened caution.(321)  After Sergeant Braun finished examining Mr. Foster's car, it was sealed with tape and towed to the Anacostia Station of the Park Police.(322)  A Park Police officer accompanied the car to the station to ensure that its contents would not be disturbed.(323)
B.<P>The Park Police Notify the White House and the Foster Family. 
<P>After Sergeant Braun and Detective Rolla finished their investigation at the scene, the shift commander asked them to call the White House.  The investigators contacted White House Security Chief Craig Livingstone and White House Associate Counsel William Kennedy, both of whom went to the hospital to identify Mr. Foster's body.  After Mr. Kennedy confirmed Mr. Foster's identity at the hospital, he called White House Chief of Staff Mack McLarty, Counsel Bernard Nussbaum, and Associate Attorney General Webster Hubbell.(324)
<P>Sergeant Braun and Detective Rolla made plans to notify the Foster family and were requested to pick up David Watkins, Assistant to the President for Management and Administration, to assist in the notification.(325)  They arrived at the Foster residence between 10:00 p.m. and 10:30 p.m.(326)  A few minutes later, Webster Hubbell, his wife, and Mr. Foster's sisters, Sharon Foster and Sheila Anthony, arrived at the Foster home.(327)  While the friends and relatives waited on the lawn, Sergeant Braun and Detective Rolla informed Mrs. Foster and her daughter Laura of Mr. Foster's death.(328)  The friends rushed to console the visibly upset family.  
<P>Park Police investigators were still attempting to continue their investigation.  Typically, the death notification involves an attempt to determine whether there was evidence of foul play and to ask the family about the victim's finances, mental state, domestic relations, health problems, and use of medication.(329)  After a brief interview yielded no useful information,(330) Detective Rolla asked Mrs. Foster to look for a note or anything out of the ordinary and to contact the police if she found anything.(331)  At approximately 11:00 p.m., President Clinton arrived at the Foster residence.  Feeling that they would get no further information from the family, Sergeant Braun and Detective Rolla left shortly thereafter, at about 11:10 p.m.(332)
C.<P>The White House Ignores Repeated Park Police Requests to Seal Mr. Foster's Office.<P>  As Sergeant Braun was leaving the Foster residence after the President arrived on July 20, she pulled David Watkins aside and asked him to seal Mr. Foster's office.  Because the investigators did not find, at Fort Marcy or at the Foster home, a note or any other evidence indicating why Mr. Foster might have taken his own life, they considered Mr. Foster's White House office, the last known place where he was seen alive, to be a part of the overall crime scene.(333)  Sergeant Braun testified that, from the investigation of the death scene and the interviews with the Foster family, the Park Police "did not get any information that would confirm that Mr. Foster was depressed or had even discussed the possibility of committing suicide with any of his friends or relatives."(334)  Mr. Foster's office, therefore, became highly relevant to the investigation.  "So I felt that that may be a place where Mr. Foster may have left a note, would be at his office, maybe for his co-workers to find rather than for his wife."(335)  Detective Rolla agreed with Sergeant Braun:  "And then, having not been able to get any information as to his state of mind from the family, no knowledge that they had found a note or anything, his place of business becomes the next logical place to go, as I said earlier."(336)  The Park Police believed that Mr. Watkins, who had provided the officers with a White House business card indicating that he was "Assistant to the President for Management and Administration,"(337) possessed the authority to direct that Mr. Foster's office be sealed.(338)
<P>Once the Park Police determined that the focus of their investigation should shift to Mr. Foster's office, the police sought "to preserve [the office] in the condition that he left it."(339)  According to Sergeant Braun, Mr. Watkins agreed to secure Mr. Foster's office.(340)  Detective Rolla corroborated Sergeant Braun's recollection: 
<P>She asked him to secure the office because we knew the situation was that we weren't going to be able to be in there that night.  And just to have things maintained, we wanted it secured until such time as higher officials could get in there and be gone through properly.(341)
Mr. Watkins denied that the Park Police asked him to take steps to seal Mr. Foster's office.(342) 
<P>Major Robert Hines of the Park Police learned of Mr. Foster's death at approximately 9:45 p.m. on July 20.(343)  Lieutenant Gavin, the shift commander, called to request that Major Hines contact Deputy Assistant to the President William Burton.(344)  Major Hines then called Mr. Burton and requested that he seal Mr. Foster's office.  "We needed to go into the office and look for any kind of reasons or intention that Mr. Foster may have to commit suicide."(345)  To ensure that such a search would be fruitful, the office should not be contaminated.  "I would expect when we said seal the office, that the office would be closed, it would be secured and no one would be entering the office."(346)  Sylvia Mathews, a White House aide, confirmed that she overheard a conversation between Mr. Burton and the Park Police that evening.(347)  Following the conversation, Mr. Burton asked Mr. Nussbaum to seal Mr. Foster's office.(348)  Ms. Mathews' contemporaneous notes of the evening stated: "At that point, Bill said we should get Bernie and lock the office.  I am uncertain what time that was, but probably after 10:00 p.m.  I don't remember who told Bernie, but he went up and locked the office."(349)
<P>Notwithstanding the testimony of Major Hines and Ms. Mathews, Mr. Burton and Mr. Nussbaum denied that they had been asked to seal Mr. Foster's office.(350)
<P>Both Webster Hubbell's wife and Marsha Scott, a White House official and a friend of the Hubbells, remembered that Mr. Hubbell called either David Watkins or Mack McLarty on the night of Mr. Foster's death to request that his office be sealed.(351)  In a press briefing several days later, Dee Dee Myers identified Mr. McLarty as the person who directed that Mr. Foster's office be sealed.(352)
<P>David Gergen testified that, after leaving the Foster residence, he went to the White House at around midnight.(353)  In the White House kitchen, he and Mr. McLarty discussed sealing Mr. Foster's office.(354)  Mr. Gergen then spoke by telephone with Mark Gearan, the White House Communications Director.  He asked Mr. Gearan, who was in his office on the first floor of the West Wing, whether the office had been sealed.  According to Mr. Gergen, Mr. Gearan checked, and "[h]e came back to me and said, yes, the office has been sealed."(355)  Mr. Gearan testified that, when Mr. Gergen asked him whether Mr. Foster's office was locked, he asked Mr. Burton about it.  Mr. Burton told Mr. Gearan that the office was locked, and Mr. Gearan relayed this information to Mr. Gergen.(356)
<P>Mr. Burton did not recall this conversation.(357)
<P>Even though White House officials had received several requests from law enforcement and an internal White House request, Mr. Foster's office was not sealed on the evening of July 20.
D.<P>Mrs. Clinton Learns of Mr. Foster's Death and Begins to Contact Close Associates.
<P>After learning of Mr. Foster's death, Mr. McLarty called Hillary Clinton, who was travelling from Los Angeles to Arkansas that evening.  Mrs. Clinton's plane landed in Little Rock at approximately 8:30 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time.(358)  Mrs. Clinton then proceeded to her mother's home in Little Rock.  Between 9:00 p.m. and 10:00 p.m., a Secret Service agent told Lisa Caputo, Mrs. Clinton's press secretary, that Mr. McLarty was calling by telephone.(359)  Mr. McLarty then told Ms. Caputo that he needed to speak privately to Mrs. Clinton.  When Mrs. Clinton came on the line, Mr. McLarty informed her of Mr. Foster's death.(360)  Mr. McLarty confirmed that he notified Mrs. Clinton some time after 9:00 p.m., after her plane landed in Arkansas.(361)
<P>Margaret Williams, Mrs. Clinton's chief of staff, testified that she received two phone calls from Mrs. Clinton on the evening of July 20.  "The first call she was on the plane and said that -- she must have called through Signal because I thought she said are you at home.  And she said are you going to be there, and I said yes.  And she said I will call you when I land."(362)  After the plane landed, Mrs. Clinton called Ms. Williams again and informed her of Mr. Foster's death.(363)  Telephone records from the Rodham residence confirm that Mrs. Clinton called Ms. Williams on July 20 at 10:13 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time and spoke for 16 minutes.(364)  It was the first telephone call that Mrs. Clinton made after learning of Mr. Foster's death.
<P>The Rodham residence telephone records indicate that, after talking with Ms. Williams, Mrs. Clinton called the residence of Harry Thomason and Susan Bloodworth-Thomason in Carpinteria, California, for four minutes.(365)  Mr. Thomason, a long-time friend of the Clintons, was involved in the Travel Office affair that apparently weighed heavily on Mr. Foster's mind at the time of his death.  Mrs. Clinton next called Susan Thomases in New York and spoke for 20 minutes.  Ms. Thomases, who had played a key  role in Whitewater damage control during the 1992 presidential campaign, testified that she and Mrs. Clinton commiserated each other about Mr. Foster's death, and that they did not discuss the handling of papers in Mr. Foster's office.(366)
E.<P>Mrs. Clinton Calls the White House on an Unlisted Trunk Line.<P>
<P>Mrs. Clinton next called the number 202-628-7087 and spoke for 10 minutes.(367)  The Committee was forced to go to considerable lengths to identify to whom Mrs. Clinton placed this call.  Counsel for Mrs. Clinton and the White House represented to the Special Committee that, despite undertaking every effort available, they were unable to determine the identity of the person whom Mrs. Clinton called at 202-628-7087.  The telephone company also could not identify the person or entity registered to that number.11 
<P>On November 30, 1995, the Special Committee then issued a set of interrogatories to Mrs. Clinton, exploring her knowledge and recollection of the identity of the person or persons she called at 202-628-7087.12   On December 7, 1995, Mrs. Clinton submitted a sworn affidavit to the Special Committee, attesting that "I do not remember calling the number 202-628-7087 that evening.  I understand that the number is an auxiliary White House switchboard number.  It would not surprise me to learn that I had placed a call to the White House that evening."
<P>On December 7, 1995, the White House advised the Special Committee that "the telephone number (202) 628-7087 was an unlisted trunk line that rang on the White House switchboard. . . .  The number was also used as a means to get through to the White House when the switchboard was overloaded, and may have been provided to certain individuals for the purpose." 
<P>The White House further advised that "we understand that Bill Burton remembers receiving a call in the Chief of Staff's office from Mrs. Clinton on the evening of July 20 and speaking with her about Vincent Foster's death."  Tellingly, Mr. Burton had omitted this conversation when he first testified before the Committee.  In his second appearance, Mr. Burton testified with a refreshed recollection:
<P>I was in Mr. McLarty's private office most of the evening, and at some point that night I received a call from the First Lady.  I don't remember if I answered the phone or if Ms. Mathews answered the phone and transferred the call in to me or if someone else answered the phone and transferred the call into me.  I don't remember who called. 

<P>It was the First Lady, and we had a personal conversation about Mr. Foster's death, and it lasted about 10 or 15 minutes to the best of my recollection.(368)
Sylvia Mathews, who was in the Chief of Staff's office with Mr. Burton, did not recall observing Mr. Burton speaking on the telephone with Mrs. Clinton, nor did he discuss with her at any time about his conversation with Mrs. Clinton.  She testified that "I was away from the desk, as we discussed previously, several times."(369)
<P>After calling the White House, Mrs. Clinton called Carolyn Huber.(370)  Ms. Huber, Assistant to the First Lady and Director of White House Correspondence, was the former administrator of the Rose Law Firm and would later discover in the White House Residence the long-missing Rose Law Firm billing records reflecting its work for James McDougal's Madison Guaranty.  Mrs. Clinton spoke with Mrs. Huber for four minutes, and then called a family member in Washington, D.C.(371)  In her seventh and final call of the night, Mrs. Clinton called the President at 1:09 a.m. in the White House Residence and spoke to him for 13 minutes.(372)
F.<P>Helen Dickey's Telephone Call to the Arkansas Governor's Mansion.
<P>Helen Dickey worked for Governor Clinton in Arkansas as the assistant to the governor's mansion administrator.(373)  She became staff assistant to the White House Social Secretary.(374)  Between January 1993 and November 1994, Ms. Dickey lived in a suite of rooms in the northeast corner of the third floor of the White House Residence.
<P>Ms. Dickey testified that, on July 20, 1993, she returned to the White House Residence some time between 6:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m. and went to her rooms.(375)  Records maintained by the Secret Service indicate that Ms. Dickey entered the White House Residence at 7:32 p.m.(376)  She left her suite at some point to go to the solarium, also on the third floor, to watch the President's appearance on Larry King Live.  The show started at 9:00 p.m.(377)  At some point during the show, John Fanning, a White House doorman, entered the solarium and told Ms. Dickey that Mr. Foster had committed suicide.(378)  
<P>Ms. Dickey, visibly shaken, went to the second floor kitchen and called her mother from the kitchen telephone.  After talking with her mother for two to three minutes, Ms. Dickey called her father, who lived in a suburb of Atlanta, Georgia.(379)  She then went back up to the third floor and, at some point, returned to the second floor kitchen to find the President, who had finished his interview with Larry King.(380)  The President told Ms. Dickey that "Vince Foster had shot himself in a park."(381)  After her two to three minute conversation with the President, Ms. Dickey returned to the third floor.  Ms. Dickey made three calls from the telephone in the hallway of the third floor of the Residence.  One call went to Ann Stock, Ms. Dickey's former supervisor as the Arkansas Governor's Mansion administrator, and another went to Ann McCoy, her supervisor as the White House Social Secretary.(382)  She talked to each for no more than five minutes.(383)  
<P>Ms. Dickey then placed the third telephone call to the Arkansas Governor's Mansion at 501-376-6884.(384)  Roger Perry, an Arkansas State Trooper on duty at the mansion, answered the telephone.  Ms. Dickey testified that she stated to Trooper Perry:  "I called just to let you know that Vince Foster has committed suicide.  I just wanted you all to know before you heard it on the news."(385)  According to Ms. Dickey, Trooper Perry "showed signs of being shocked and being very sad."(386)  The entire conversation lasted approximately two to three minutes.(387)  Her best estimate of the time of the call to the Governor's Mansion was 10:30 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time.(388)
<P>During its investigation, the Special Committee received an affidavit from Roger Perry.  In relevant part, the affidavit stated:
<P>On the 20th day of July, 1993, I received a telephone call from a person known to me as Helen Dickey.  I was working in the security detail at the Arkansas Governor's mansion in Little Rock, Arkansas at that time.  Dickey advised me that Vincent Foster, well knew [sic] to me had gotten off work and had gone out to his car in the parking lot and had shot himself in the head.  I do not recall the exact time of this telephone call but am fairly certain it was some time from about 4:30 p.m. to no later than 7:00 p.m.  [Central Daylight Time]
The Special Committee also received affidavits from Larry Patterson and Lynn Davis, also of the Arkansas State Police.  Trooper Patterson stated that he had received a telephone call from Trooper Perry on July 20, 1993.  Trooper Perry told him that Ms. Dickey had called and said Vincent Foster "had gotten off work and had gone out to his car in the parking lot  and shot himself in the head."  Trooper Patterson did not recall the exact time of Trooper Perry's telephone call but was "fairly certain it was some time before 6:00 p.m." Central Daylight Time.  Captain Davis likewise stated in his affidavit that Trooper Perry called him on July 20, 1993, to say that Ms. Dickey had called him and said that Vincent Foster "had gone to his car on the parking lot and had shot himself in the head."  According to Captain Davis, "I estimate the time as being no later than six o'clock, Central Standard [sic] Time."
<P>To resolve the discrepancy between Ms. Dickey's testimony and the sworn affidavits of Messrs. Perry, Patterson and Davis, the Special Committee attempted to obtain records of telephone communications between the White House and the Arkansas Governor's Mansion on July 20, 1993.  The White House advised that "no such call was made from the private telephone lines in the Executive Residence."(389)  The call may have been placed, however, through the White House or Signal switchboard.  Ms. Dickey testified that she recalled placing the call through the White House operator.(390)  On October 13, 1995, White House advised that "[w]e have obtained records of long-distance calls placed through the Signal switchboard, and have confirmed that no call to the Governor's Mansion was made through the Signal switchboard on July 20, 1993."(391)  The White House also advised that Sprint, the provider of long distance service through the White House switchboard, did not retain records of individual long-distance telephone calls.(392)
<P>After additional inquiries, the Special Committee discovered that the White House was mistaken.  Sprint indeed retained some records of individual telephone calls placed through the White House switchboard.  The Special Committee thus issued a subpoena on November 20, 1995, to obtain such records and was initially advised that the records reflected the destination number to which a telephone call was placed, but not the extension in the White House from which the call originated.(393)  Sprint subsequently advised that its records only reflect the first six digits of the destination number, that is, the area code and prefix, and not the last four digits of the destination number.(394)  Because the Governor's mansion does not have an exclusive prefix, it is not possible to determine from the records produced by Sprint to the Special Committee when Ms. Dickey placed the phone call.
<P>After further inquiry by the Special Committee, however, the White House advised that "[w]e have confirmed that a call to Ms. Dickey's father's telephone number in Georgia was made at 10:06 p.m. on July 20, 1993, from one of the private lines in the Residence."(395)  Ms. Dickey testified that she called her father before calling the Arkansas Governor's mansion.(396)  Ms. Dickey also denied that she told the troopers that Vincent Foster had gone to his car in the parking lot and shot himself in the head.  According to Ms. Dickey: "That's absolutely not true. . . . I never heard that, I never would have said that because that's not the facts as I knew them at that time.  I'm absolutely positive of the timing of this."(397)
G.<P>The Handling of Trash and Burn Bags in Mr. Foster's Office.
<P>During the course of the evening, Sylvia Mathews determined that she should retrieve the trash from Mr. Foster's office in case it contained evidence relevant to his death.  According to Ms. Mathews, "I consulted with senior staff around and said should we examine the contents and was told -- I don't remember the exact words or who said what, but generally encouraged to go ahead and look through the trash."(398)  Ms. Mathews specifically recalled Bill Burton being present for this discussion.(399)  The trash had already been collected by the cleaning staff, but Ms. Mathews retrieved it.  After locating what she believed to be Mr. Foster's trash, Ms. Mathews prepared an inventory and found nothing significant.(400)  At Bill Burton's request, she placed the trash in the office of Roy Neel, the Deputy White House Chief of Staff.(401)  Mr. Nussbaum testified that Ms. Mathews asked him if she should recover the trash from Mr. Foster's office.  He then told her to go ahead and to store the trash in Roy Neel's office.(402) 
<P>Ms. Mathews also wanted to recover Mr. Foster's burn bag.  The burn bag, a receptacle used for sensitive materials to be destroyed, is collected daily by the Secret Service.  Secret Service officer Henry P. O'Neill was responsible for emptying the individual burn bags into a larger burn bag to be processed.(403)  Officer O'Neill testified that he brought this co-mingled burn bag, which contained the papers of several offices, to the Chief of Staff's suite and gave it to Ms. Mathews.  Officer O'Neill believed that this bag did not contain anything from the White House Counsel's suite or from Vincent Foster's office.(404)  When he had gone to empty the burn bags in the counsel's suite with the cleaning staff earlier that evening, he had been interrupted by Bernard Nussbaum entering the suite.(405)  Officer O'Neill never had a chance to empty the burn bags, because the suite was occupied that evening.  
<P>Bill Burton then instructed Ms. Mathews to check with Mr. Nussbaum before examining the contents of the co-mingled burn bags.(406)  Mr. Nussbaum told Ms. Mathews that Mr. Foster's office did not have a burn bag.(407)  Mr. Nussbaum instructed Ms. Mathews to return the burn bag because it contained materials co-mingled from other offices in the White House.(408)  Ms. Mathews then returned the bag to Officer O'Neill and told him to proceed as usual.(409)  Mr. Nussbaum did not recall discussing the burn bag with Ms. Mathews.(410)
H.<P>Senior White House Officials Conduct a Late-Night Search of Mr. Foster's Office.
<P>Even though the Park Police made two requests to seal Mr. Foster's office, three White House senior officials conducted a search of his office on the night of July 20.   
<P>Patsy Thomasson, David Watkins' deputy, received the following message on her pager at 10:34  p.m. on July 20: "PLEASE PAGE DAVID WATSKINS [sic] WITH YOUR LOCATION".(411)  Ms. Thomasson was at Sequoia Restaurant, minutes from the Foster residence in Georgetown.  When Ms. Thomasson reached Mr. Watkins, he told her that Mr. Foster was dead.(412)  Ms. Thomasson then asked him, "[I]s there anything I can do to help?  Do I need to be where you are?  What do I need to do?"(413)  Rather than asking Ms. Thomasson to take steps to seal Mr. Foster's office, as the Park Police had specifically requested Mr. Watkins to do, he instructed Ms. Thomasson to go into Mr. Foster's office at the White House to look for a suicide note.(414)  Ms. Thomasson arrived at the White House at 10:48  p.m.(415) 
<P>White House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum was finishing dinner at Galileo's, a restaurant several minutes from the White House, when he was paged by the White House on July 20.  When he returned the page, Mark Gearan told him that Mr. Foster was dead.(416)  Mr. Nussbaum went directly to the White House,(417) where he encountered the President and Mack McLarty on their way to the Foster residence.(418)  According to Mr. Nussbaum, he then went to his office to make telephone calls to notify his staff of Mr. Foster's death.  At about 10:45 p.m., Mr. Nussbaum reached the White House Counsel's suite, where both his office and Mr. Foster's office are located.  On his way there, "it occurred to me that perhaps Vince left a note telling us why he had taken his life."(419)
<P>Margaret Williams, Chief of Staff to the First Lady, testified that she received the news of Mr. Foster's death from Mrs. Clinton.  Telephone records indicated that this call came at 10:13 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time and lasted 16 minutes.  When she hung up with Mrs. Clinton, Ms. Williams called her mother(420) and Evelyn Lieberman, her assistant.(421)  Ms. Lieberman, who lived near Ms. Williams, went to Ms. Williams' house and drove her to the White House.  Ms. Williams did not recall why she went to the White House beyond the fact that "I just knew everybody else would be there."(422)  When the two arrived at the White House, Ms. Williams asked Ms. Lieberman to remain in the foyer of Mrs. Clinton's office to answer the phones.  Ms. Williams went to Mr. Gearan's office to review a press statement and then went to her own office, which was down the hall from Mr. Foster's office, to get a copy of Mrs. Clinton's schedule.  
<P>All evening, I had been avoiding looking in the direction of Vince's office as I entered and left the First Lady's suite.  But in a strange way, when I saw the light on in his office, I had this hope, albeit irrational, that I would walk in and I would find Vince Foster there and we would have a chat sitting on his couch, as we have done so many times before.(423)
<P>Ms. Thomasson, Mr. Nussbaum, and Ms. Williams all admitted that they entered Mr. Foster's office on the evening of July 20.  Their stories fall apart after that.  Each provided testimony that was inconsistent with the other two.  And, their testimony was contradicted the testimony of career Secret Service officer Henry P. O'Neill, the watch officer for that evening, and contemporaneous Secret Service records.
<P>Ms. Thomasson testified that, after placing her personal belongings in her office, she went to the second floor on the West Wing of the White House.(424)  There, she encountered Mr. Nussbaum in the hallway and told him that Mr. Watkins had asked her to look for a suicide note in Mr. Foster's office.(425)  She and Mr. Nussbaum then walked together into Mr. Foster's unsecured office.(426)  The cleaning lady was leaving the suite as Mr. Nussbaum and Ms. Thomasson entered.(427)  Ms. Thomasson then did a quick search for a note.  "I sat at Vince's desk, opened the drawers to the desk to see if there was anything that looked like a suicide note.  I looked in the top of his briefcase, which was sitting on the floor.  I didn't see anything."(428)  According to Ms. Thomasson, Mr. Nussbaum walked out for a moment, and Ms. Williams came in and began to cry on the couch.(429)  After a few minutes Ms. Williams left the office.  Mr. Nussbaum then came back in the office and suggested that they "probably should get out of here at that point."(430)  Ms. Thomasson and Mr. Nussbaum then left Mr. Foster's office together.(431)  She then paged Mr. Watkins, at 11:36 p.m., to report that she had found no note in Mr. Foster's office.(432)<P>
<P>Mr. Nussbaum offered a markedly different recollection.  When he reached the Counsel's suite at around 10:45 p.m., the door was open.  He did not arrive with Ms. Thomasson, as Mr. Thomasson has claimed.  Instead, Ms. Thomasson and Mr. Williams were already in Mr. Foster's office.  Ms. Williams was sitting on the sofa crying, and Ms. Thomasson was sitting behind Mr. Foster's desk.  They told Nussbaum that they had just arrived, and Ms. Thomasson told Mr. Nussbaum that she was searching for a suicide note.  According to Mr. Nussbaum, "Patsy and I checked the surfaces in Vince's office.  We opened a drawer or two looking for a note. . . . The three of us then left the office.(433)  He claimed that the search lasted no more than ten minutes,(434)13  and that the three then left Mr. Foster's office together.(435)  Mr. Nussbaum then went next door to his office to make some phone calls.14   When he left about an hour later, he locked and alarmed the Counsel's suite.(436)  
<P>Ms. Williams contradicted the testimony of both Ms. Thomasson and Mr. Nussbaum.  She testified that when she entered Mr. Foster's office, Ms. Thomasson was already sitting at Mr. Foster's desk.  Ms. Williams sat on the couch and commiserated with Ms. Thomasson.  Mr. Nussbaum entered the office later, obviously upset.(437)  After a brief time in the office, Mr. Nussbaum left, and Ms. Williams followed shortly thereafter.(438)  According to Ms. Williams, Ms. Thomasson remained in the office after both Mr. Nussbaum and Ms. Williams left.(439)
<P>Ms. Thomasson, Mr. Nussbaum, and Ms. Williams thus differed as to the critical sequence of entries into and exits from Mr. Foster's office on the evening of July 20.  Ms. Thomasson testified that she entered and exited Mr. Foster's office together with Mr. Nussbaum and suggested that at no time was she alone in the office.15   Mr. Nussbaum testified that he entered Mr. Foster's office after Ms. Thomasson and Ms. Williams; the three left the office together; and, after stopping by his office to make some phone calls, Mr. Nussbaum locked and alarmed the suite.  Ms. Williams testified that she entered after Ms. Thomasson and before Mr. Nussbaum, and that she exited shortly after Mr. Nussbaum, leaving Ms. Thomasson alone again in the office.
I.<P>Secret Service Officer Henry O'Neill Observes Margaret Williams Remove Documents from Mr. Foster's Office.
<P>Henry P. O'Neill joined the Secret Service Uniformed Division in 1977 and has been assigned to the White House since May of that year.  On the evening of July 20, 1993, he arrived at work at 6:30 p.m., several hours before his scheduled shift at 10:30 p.m., in anticipation of some voluntary overtime hours.  He made his regular rounds with the cleaning staff.(440)  He accompanied the cleaning staff to the White House Counsel's suite and disarmed the alarm at 10:42 p.m.(441)  As he reached the door of the suite, Officer O'Neill made a radio call to the uniformed division control center.  The center acknowledged the call, and Officer O'Neill unlocked the door and entered.(442)  "I flip the light switch on in the reception area.  Then I walk to the right into Mr. Foster's -- at that time, the deputy counsel's office, and behind the doorway there's an alarm switch, and you just flip the switch into access or open."(443)  He then let the cleaning crew in.
<P>Officer O'Neill proceeded into Mr. Nussbaum's office and checked the burn bag.(444)  He did not check Mr. Foster's office for a burn bag because as he walked back into the reception area, "I recognized Mr. Nussbaum as I turned to the right.  He walked into his office, and just about the same time I noticed other figures walk in behind him and I heard women's voices.  And so I directed the cleaning ladies to exit the suite, and I left the suite also."(445)16   Officer O'Neill could not identify exactly who, or how many people were accompanying Mr. Nussbaum into the suite.  He was certain, however, that he heard women's voices and that Mr. Nussbaum was not alone as he entered the suite.<P>  The Secret Service officer then left the Counsel's suite and walked to the legislative affairs office.  He was on his way back to alarm the Chief Counsel's suite when he ran into Howard Pastor, the Assistant to the President for Legislative Affairs, who informed him of Mr. Foster's death.  As Officer O'Neill approached the Counsel's suite he saw Ms. Lieberman, Ms. Williams' assistant, leaving the suite.(446)  She asked Officer O'Neill to lock up the office.  He replied that he would take care of it.(447)  Officer O'Neill then rode the elevator with Ms. Lieberman down to the ground floor to inform his supervisor of Mr. Foster's death.  While he was on the phone, he overheard Ms. Lieberman asking Officer James Shea to ensure that the Counsel's suite was locked.(448)  Officer O'Neill told Shea that he knew of the request and would secure the office.(449)
<P>When Officer O'Neill returned to secure the White House counsel's suite, he found Patsy Thomasson sitting behind Vince Foster's desk.17   He "stopped in the doorway immediately walking into the office because as I looked to the left there was a woman sitting at the desk."(450)  Officer O'Neill went back to the first floor.  He returned to the Counsel's suite for a third time and again saw Ms. Lieberman coming out of the counsel's suite.  She asked him again to lock Mr. Foster's office.  According to Officer O'Neill:
<P>And then a few seconds after I saw her [Lieberman] come out, Mr. Nussbaum walked out behind her and walked through the hallway towards the stairs, past the elevator, and within a few more seconds I saw Maggie Williams walk out of the suite and turn to the right in the direction that I was standing.(451)

As Ms. Williams walked past Officer O'Neill to her office Ms. Lieberman told him "'that's Maggie Williams; she's the First Lady's chief of staff.'"(452)  
<P>Officer O'Neill observed Ms. Williams carrying file folders out of the Counsel's suite when he saw her on the night of Mr. Foster's death:  
<P>She was carrying what I would describe in her arms and hands, as folders.  She had them down in front of her as she walked down to her - in the direction of where I was standing.

<P><P>* * *

<P>She walked past me, and she continued on down the hallway.  It's only about 20 feet at the most. And she started to enter her office, and she had to brace the folders in her arm on a cabinet, and then she entered the office and came out within a few seconds and locked the door.(453)  

The folders were of "some weight, 3 to 5 inches."(454)  Officer O'Neill was certain that he saw Ms. Williams carrying folders out of the Counsel's suite that evening.(455)  After leaving the folders in her office, Ms. Williams joined Ms. Lieberman outside of the counsel's suite.(456)  Officer O'Neill then locked and alarmed the suite and joined the two women on the elevator.(457)  
<P>Ms. Lieberman, Ms. Williams and Mr. Nussbaum each denied removing any documents, or seeing anyone removing documents, from Mr. Foster's office on the night of his death.18 
<P>Mr. Nussbaum testified that after he left Mr. Foster's office together with both Ms. Thomasson and Ms. Williams, he proceeded to his office to make some telephone calls and then locked and alarmed the Counsel's suite when he left.  This testimony was contradicted by the White House alarm logs maintained by the Secret Service for July 20, 1993, which showed that Officer O'Neill alarmed the counsel's suite at 11:41 p.m.(458)19 
<P>Curiously, after Ms. Williams left the White House, she called Mrs. Clinton in Little Rock at 12:56 a.m. on the morning of July 21, and they spoke for 11 minutes.  Ms. Williams claimed that she did not tell Mrs. Clinton about her search of Mr. Foster's office.(459)  Although Ms. Williams testified that she did not recall talking to Susan Thomases on the evening of Mr. Foster's death,(460) telephone records obtained by the Special Committee indicated that, upon ending her conversation with Mrs. Clinton, Ms. Williams called Ms. Thomases at 1:10 a.m., and they spoke for 14 minutes.(461)  Of her conversation with Ms. Williams, Ms. Thomases testified: "I don't recollect speaking with her that night.  That's not to say that she didn't call me back and I didn't speak to her, but I have no independent recollection of having spoken with her that night."(462)  

<P>III.  July 21, 1993.
A.<P>Mr. Foster's Office Is Finally Sealed.
<P>When Associate Attorney General Webster Hubbell woke up on July 21, 1993, he immediately called William Burton, Deputy Assistant to the President, and asked him to lock Mr. Foster's office.(463)  In the middle of the night, "one of the things that kept me awake is saying we ought to make sure Vince's office is locked."(464)  Mr. Hubbell wanted to make sure that the office was secured and that its contents were documented and handled in a "professional" manner.(465)  When Mr. Hubbell reached Mr. Burton at the White House, some time between 7:00 a.m. and 8:00 a.m., Mr. Burton assured Mr. Hubbell that White House Chief of Staff Mack McLarty had taken steps to seal the office on the previous night.(466)  Mr. Burton did not recall discussing sealing the office with Mr. Hubbell,(467) although his undated, handwritten notes listed "1) Secure office" near the notation "Webb" and Mr. Hubbell's home and office phone numbers.(468)
<P>Betsy Pond, Bernard Nussbaum's secretary, arrived at the White House early in the morning of July 21, at around 7:00 a.m.(469)  She then entered Mr. Foster's office, which had not been sealed.  She followed the routine procedure to disarm the alarm for the Counsel's suite.(470)  Once inside Mr. Foster's office, she looked at documents on the coffee table and the desk, turned the documents over, and "smushed them together in a pile."(471)
<P>Associate Counsel to the President Stephen Neuwirth testified that when he arrived at the White House Counsel's suite on July 21, he saw Ms. Pond in Mr. Foster's office.  Ms. Pond told him that she was straightening out the office, and Mr. Neuwirth told her that she should not be in Mr. Foster's office.(472)  Mr. Neuwirth testified that he "didn't think it was appropriate for an assistant to Mr. Nussbaum to be in the office at that time."(473)  Ms. Pond then left Mr. Foster's office and called Mr. Nussbaum at home.  According to Ms. Pond, she told Mr. Nussbaum that she had been in Mr. Foster's office, and Mr. Nussbaum told her not to let anyone in the office.(474)  Mr. Nussbaum confirmed this conversation.(475)
<P>Linda Tripp, Mr. Nussbaum's executive assistant, testified that Ms. Pond told her that she went into Mr. Foster's office to search for a note: 
<P>She said, "Well, I just went in there but just to straighten papers." And, I said, "Betsy, why would you have gone in there to straighten papers? We never go into Vince's office to straighten anything."  She then admitted that she was hysterical, and she was very, very overwrought, and that she had actually been in there looking for a note but that no one was to go in there; and, those were Bernie's strict instructions.(476)
<P>At 8:00 a.m., the White House senior staff, which included, among others, Messrs. Burton, Gergen, and Nussbaum, attended a daily meeting in Mr. McLarty's office.(477)  Although those present at the meeting were fairly certain that they discussed Mr. Foster's death,(478) none could recall the specifics of the discussion.  Nor could anyone remember a discussion of the investigation into their colleague's death,(479) other than "that the Park Police would be looking into it."(480)  And, no one recalled any discussion of sealing Mr. Foster's office and preserving its contents.(481)
<P>Instead, Mr. Nussbaum testified that, after the daily meeting of the White House Counsel's Office at 9:00 a.m., he talked with Mr. Neuwirth and Associate Counsel to the President Clifford Sloan about securing Mr. Foster's office.  Mr. Nussbaum realized that "there would be investigations obviously with respect to Vince's death.  And under those circumstances, it would be best to make sure that the office was secure in connection with those investigations."(482)  According to Mr. Nussbaum, Mr. Neuwirth and Mr. Sloan, the three lawyers concluded that Mr. Foster's office should be sealed,(483) and they proceeded to call the Secret Service.(484)
<P>While the lawyers deliberated, Linda Tripp had independently contacted the Secret Service to arrange for the office to be sealed.  "When I first came in the morning and saw that it was not secured and Betsy was reacting to her situation, I said, `Why is this not secure? Why is there no tape?  Why is there no guard?'  She said, `No one has done that yet?'"(485)  Ms. Tripp testified that her professional background led her to recognize the need to seal the office.  "I've worked on the covert side of the Department of Defense . . . .  And, instantly, to me, that made--it made little sense to do anything else but ensure that we were not violating--I mean, it was obvious a history-making situation that would come to if not this end then at least a very visible end.  It just didn't occur to me not to do that."(486)
<P>So when one of the lawyers emerged from the meeting in Mr. Nussbaum's office and said, "`Someone better arrange to have an agent posted,'" Ms. Tripp had already made such arrangements.(487)  Donald Flynn, a Secret Service supervisor, confirmed that Ms. Tripp had called the Presidential Protective Division to request that an officer be posted outside Mr. Foster's office.(488)  Mr. Flynn forwarded the request to the uniformed division of the Secret Service and, at about 10:10 a.m., took up position outside Mr. Foster's office until he was relieved by the uniformed officer.(489)
<P>Even after a uniformed officer was posted at the door, White House personnel still had access to Mr. Foster's office.  As Detective Markland testified, "I came to find out that it wasn't exactly sealed but posted, which meant that people had access to the office but their comings and goings would be recorded by a Secret Service agent."(490)  Because the White House Counsel's office did not specify that access should be limited, Secret Service Agent Flynn instructed the uniformed officers not to impede access but simply to record entries into the office.
<P>  There really was no understanding as to whether or not people could enter the office or not.  I mean, I'll offer this on my own and that was that I instructed the officer that came up there to relieve me that if anyone did enter the office, to jot down the time and the name of who it was and what the purpose was for them going in the office, and then to relay the information to me.(491)  

Thus, the log indicated that at 11:10 a.m., Mr. Nussbaum entered the office and removed a small black and white photograph.(492)  Although Thomas Castleton, an intern in the White House Counsel's office, testified that he entered Mr. Foster's office with Mr. Nussbaum, Castleton's entry was not recorded in the log book.(493)
B.<P>The White House Impedes Initial Park Police Efforts to Search Mr. Foster's Office.
<P>Based on their various requests the previous night, the Park Police assumed that Mr. Foster's office had been sealed.  Sergeant Braun was under the impression that the office had in fact been sealed.(494)  Similarly, Major Robert Hines had spoken with Mr. Burton on the night of July 20 and requested that he seal the office, following "a normal procedure that our investigators would ask the Secret Service to do."(495)  Thus, when Major Hines and Park Police Chief Robert Langston briefed White House officials on their investigation at a 10:00 a.m. meeting on July 21, both Major Hines and Chief Langston thought that Mr. Foster's office had already been sealed.(496)  In fact, Chief Langston testified that, during the 10:00 a.m. briefing, White House officials assured him that the office had been sealed the night before, even though it was not.(497)  "There was acknowledgement, somewhere in that meeting, that the office had been sealed and that investigators would be conducting interviews of the staff up there that morning."(498)
<P>The two Park Police investigators, Captain Hume and Detective Peter Markland, arrived at the White House just as Major Hines and Chief Langston finished briefing White House officials.  Detective Markland, who replaced Sergeant Cheryl Braun on the case, found out upon his arrival at the White House that a uniformed officer had not been posted at Mr. Foster's office until the morning following Mr. Foster's death, despite contrary assurances to the Park Police.  He had a brief discussion with Secret Service Inspector Dennis Martin and Mr. Nussbaum, and "even though they were different times and there was confusion as to what time somebody was posted and who ordered it posted, both of them agreed they had not been posted until that morning at some point."(499)  Given the importance of the office to his investigation, Detective Markland was upset at the news.  "I was under the impression that it was posted the night before, after Mr. Foster was identified.  So I was upset about that."(500)  Detective Markland and Captain Hume complained to Chief Langston about the White House's failure to secure the office.  "[T]hose were comments that were just made by Hume or Markland at the time that it had not been sealed or wasn't sealed properly, or people had been allowed access, or something like that; that they had great concerns at the time."(501)  Those concerns prompted Chief Langston to call Robert Bryant, the special agent in charge of the Washington field office for the FBI, to request an FBI agent to assist the Park Police investigators.(502)
<P>The Park Police investigators were not permitted to enter Mr. Foster's office to search for evidence on July 21.  According to Secret Service Agent Flynn, he understood that Captain Hume and Detective Markland "were coming over with the intent of going into Mr. Foster's office to look for a suicide note."(503)  Secret Service Inspector Martin was assigned to escort the investigators "wherever they needed to go."(504)  However, when Agent Flynn encountered the trio later in the day, Agent Martin appeared to be "baby-sitting" the Park Police investigators.(505)  "They were waiting with him for a time to determine when they could go in Mr. Foster's office."(506)  The investigators had not been allowed access to Mr. Foster's office to search for evidence because "[t]hey were waiting for approval from Mr. Nussbaum."(507)  They waited through the afternoon.(508)
C.<P>The White House Counsel and Deputy Attorney General Agree on a Search Protocol for the Documents in Mr. Foster's Office.
<P>Associate Attorney General Webster Hubbell was among those who attended the Park Police briefing at the White House in the morning of July 21.  As they were walking out of the meeting, Mr. Hubbell told Mr. Nussbaum that "he ought to think about staying out of this."(509)  Mr. Hubbell testified that he advised Mr. Nussbaum to recuse himself from the investigation because "I knew that there had been issues regarding the travel office and whether there should be an independent counsel to represent the White House with regard to the travel office investigation."(510)  Mr. Nussbaum replied that he wanted to talk to Mr. Hubbell about that later.(511)  They never talked.(512)
<P>Some time that afternoon, Mr. Nussbaum spoke with other senior officials at the Justice Department.  Shortly after the Park Police briefing, Mr. Nussbaum decided to ask the Justice Department to coordinate the investigation into Mr. Foster's death.(513)  He then called either Attorney General Janet Reno or Deputy Attorney General Philip Heymann to make the request.  According to Mr. Nussbaum, the Justice Department replied that the FBI would assist with the investigation.  For a coordinating function, however, "they may get other people involved."(514)  Other than this quick response to Mr. Nussbaum's request for assistance, Mr. Nussbaum did not recall any conversation with anyone about documents in Mr. Foster's office until officials from the Justice Department arrived at the White House later in the afternoon.(515)
<P>Mr. Heymann had a more detailed and markedly different recollection of the conversation.  Mr. Heymann did not remember who initiated this conversation, but suspected that he telephoned Mr. Nussbaum after the White House contacted Attorney General Reno and she delegated the matter to Mr. Heymann.  He was immediately aware of the sensitive nature of the investigation, based on his experience in the Justice Department.(516)
<P>According to Mr. Heymann, important legal, political and ethical considerations must be balanced in an investigation into the death of a senior administration official:  
<P>Number one is I know there's going to be a serious problem with documents because there are serious issues of executive privilege and there are serious issues of law enforcement and they aren't easily reconciled.  Number two, I know that there are going to be political attacks and political allegations of cover-up and I know that there's going to be conspiracy theorists.  I've been through that regularly and I know that they're out there. . . .  That difficulty of reconciling the three, number one and number two, leads to the third, and that is I worry a lot about the Department of Justice retaining the appearance and the reality of absolutely unbiased law enforcement.(517)
Because of these competing considerations, Mr. Heymann believed that any review of documents had to be undertaken jointly by law enforcement officials and the White House.  "So we can't make the judgment completely ourselves as to what's relevant. On the other hand, I don't think it's wise or desirable for the White House counsel to decide on his own what is executive privilege and what isn't."(518)
<P>On the afternoon of July 21, Mr. Heymann and Mr. Nussbaum agreed on an appropriate procedure to review the documents in Mr. Foster's office.  "I agreed with Mr. Nussbaum on what I think, and continue to think, is an entirely sensible plan for reconciling these competing interests."(519)  Career Department of Justice officials would review the documents jointly with Mr. Nussbaum, but the officials would be allowed to see each document to determine its relevance to the ongoing investigation:
<P>I would send over career prosecutors of unimpeachable reputation and rectitude and they would, with him, look at every document in the office.  They would look at the heading of its and maybe the first couple of lines, in order to see whether it had any likely relevance or any possible relevance, to Vince Foster's death.(520)
Although "agreed" did not mean that he and Mr. Nussbaum entered into a binding contract, Mr. Heymann was certain that he and Mr. Nussbaum had reached a meeting of minds on July 21 on the appropriate review procedure.(521)  "I understood it to be that we both thought that this was the right way to handle what would otherwise be a very difficult and sensitive problem."(522)  He described this procedure to Captain Charles Hume of the Park Police that afternoon.  According to Captain Hume:  "My first impression was that the documents would be looked at by the Justice Department attorneys."(523)
<P>Mr. Heymann selected two respected career prosecutors to go to the White House to review the documents -- Roger Adams, Counsel to the Deputy Attorney General, and David Margolis, Associate Deputy Attorney General.  Mr. Adams, who had been the principal ethics official for the criminal division, was, in Mr. Heymann's words, "unbiasable."(524)  Mr. Margolis, who had been chief of the  Department's organized crime section, "sort of epitomizes the most highly respected career prosecutor at this time.  There's no more highly respected career prosecutor at this time."(525)
<P>That afternoon, Mr. Heymann sent Mr. Adams and Mr. Margolis to the White House to begin to carry out the document review procedure to which he and Mr. Nussbaum had just agreed.  "I know we agreed and I know that because I know I sent Adams and Margolis over and I even thought the process was going to start that afternoon."(526)  Mr. Margolis corroborated Mr. Heymann's recollection:
<P>To give it the full background, he had called me up from a meeting, and he said, "I want you to go over to the White House with Roger Adams."  He said, "Vince Foster is dead.  There's an investigation of it."  I had seen the headline of that in the newspaper that morning.  He said he had reached a tentative agreement with Mr. Nussbaum that Roger and I were to go through at least the first page or two of each document in order to determine whether they were relevant to our investigation. . . .  Phil told me that he believed he'd had an agreement in principle with Bernie Nussbaum to do it that way, so I should go finalize it and then begin the search process.(527)
D.<P>The White House Finalizes the Agreement on the Search Protocol.
<P>When Messrs. Adams and Margolis arrived at the White House in the late afternoon, at around 5:00 p.m., they went to the White House Counsel's suite.  There, they met with Mr. Nussbaum, other members of the White House Counsel's office, an attorney for the Foster family, and officials of the FBI, Park Police, and Secret Service.(528)  The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the procedures for the review of documents in Mr. Foster's office.
<P>Mr. Margolis testified that, at the meeting, he and Mr. Nussbaum finalized the agreement on how to conduct the search the following morning.  "When I got there, I discussed it with Mr. Nussbaum.  And I believed then and I believe today that we finalized that agreement and that we both agreed to it."(529)  Roger Adams confirmed that Mr. Nussbaum agreed that the Justice Department officials would review the documents for relevance and, if the documents were relevant, for possible claims of privilege.(530)  Mr. Adams was certain that an agreement had been reached.  "I am not sure how the conversation went, but the procedure that I have just outlined was what was clearly agreed upon at that meeting on Wednesday the 21st."(531)
<P>The recollection of the Justice Department officials was corroborated by a contemporaneous FBI report.20   After summarizing how the FBI became involved in the investigation on July 21, the report stated: 
<P>An initial meeting was held with the White House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum at which time it was agreed that the Victim's office, which is located adjacent to Mr. Nussbaum's would continue to be sealed by the U.S. Secret Service (USSS) until 10:00 A.M. on 7/22/93, at which time Margolis and Adams would conduct a preliminary examination of documents within the office.(532)
<P>When, near the end of the meeting, Mr. Neuwirth stated that Mr. Nussbaum alone would review each document for relevance, Mr. Adams and Mr. Margolis immediately objected.  Mr. Nussbaum then intervened, correcting Mr. Neuwirth and stating that the Justice Department attorneys would review the documents.  According to Mr. Margolis: 
<P>When we finished, Mr. Neuwirth on his staff, as I recall, attempted to restate the agreement, and got it what I believe was exactly wrong, and said, "The way we're going to do it is that Bernie will go through the documents, and he'll give you what is both relevant and non-privileged to review."  I said that's exactly wrong.  We just agreed to the other procedure.  And it was my recollection then, and it's my recollection today, that Mr. Nussbaum agreed with me that Mr. Neuwirth was wrong, and that we had that other agreement.(533)
Mr. Adams recollected the same incident.(534)
<P>At Mr. Heymann's request, Roger Adams typed up notes summarizing the activities of the Justice Department in connection with the Foster investigation.  Those notes, prepared the following week, confirmed Mr. Margolis' recollection:
<P>At the Wednesday meeting there was agreement that the Justice Department attorneys would look at each document or at least each file to determine if it contained privileged material, in which case it would not be examined by the Park Police or FBI.  We would not read the documents or make notes, but merely examine them long enough to determine if they were covered by the attorney-client privilege or possibly executive privilege.  As an example of the clarity of this agreement, Mr. Neuwirth at one point, apparently trying to summarize it, said that "Bernie would look at each document and determine privilege.  If he determined no privilege, it could be shown to the law enforcement officers."  He was immediately corrected and Mr. Nussbaum agreed that the Justice Department representatives would see the documents to determine privilege.(535)
<P>The recollection of Mr. Nussbaum and his associates contradicts the testimony of the career Justice Department officials and, most importantly, the only contemporaneous document -- an FBI report -- recording what occurred at the meeting.
<P>Mr. Nussbaum conceded that the search of Mr. Foster's office was discussed,(536) but maintains that no agreement was reached as to the procedure for reviewing documents.  "In my -- to the best of my recollection, and I do have a recollection about this, there was no agreement.  I think my recollection is supported by Mr. Neuwirth of my office who was there, by Mr. Sloan of my office who was there."(537)  Mr. Nussbaum acknowledged, however, that a misunderstanding may have occurred:
<P>  If the Justice Department officials believe that we reached an agreement after our July 21 meeting, then a misunderstanding and a miscommunication occurred, and I may be responsible for that.  But I do not believe, nor, as you have heard, do my colleagues in the White House counsel's office believe, who were present at those meetings, that we reached any agreement on July 21 or that we in any way misused the Department of Justice.(538)  

Mr. Neuwirth and Mr. Sloan corroborated Mr. Nussbaum's testimony that the exact protocol for the search was not resolved at the end of the July 21 meeting.(539)
<P>When Mr. Adams and Mr. Margolis returned to the Justice Department after the meeting, Mr. Margolis reported to Mr. Heymann that Mr. Margolis had finalized Mr. Heymann's agreement with Mr. Nussbaum.  
<P>I told him along the lines that he had thought that he had reached a tentative agreement with Bernie Nussbaum; that Roger and I would review at least the first couple, first page or two of each document, to determine whether it might contain something along the lines of an extortion note or a suicide note.  So it was the agreement that he had reached.(540)  

Mr. Heymann confirmed this testimony:
<P>Mr. Heymann:  That is what they reported to me when Mr. Margolis and Mr. Adams returned that evening, the evening of Wednesday the 21st, to the Justice Department.
<P>Senator Shelby:  What do your notes reflect, I was paraphrasing them?
<P>Mr. Heymann:  It said they discussed the system that had been agreed upon, I just described to you.  BN, that stands for Mr. Nussbaum, agreed.  SN, that stands for Neuwirth, said no.  We shouldn't do it that way.  The Justice Department attorneys shouldn't have direct access to the files.  David Margolis, the Justice Department attorney, said it's a done deal and Mr, Nussbaum at that point said yes, we've agreed to that.(541)
<P>During the meeting, everyone agreed that, given the lateness of the hour, the search of Mr. Foster's office would not take place until the following day.(542)  It was then decided that the Secret Service would place a secure lock on Mr. Foster's office door, the keys to which would be kept by agent Flynn of the Secret Service.(543)  The lock was installed at approximately 8:00 p.m. on July 21.(544)

<P>   IV.  July 22, 1993
A.<P>The White House Counsel's Office Interferes with Park Police Interviews of White House Staff.
<P>The next morning, July 22, at about 9:00 a.m., Detective Markland and Captain Hume of the Park Police returned to the White House to interview White House staff.  Two Associate White House Counsels attended each of the interviews.  Deborah Gorham, Mr. Foster's secretary, testified that members of the White House staff attended a meeting on the afternoon of July 21 with Mr. Sloan, Mr. Neuwirth, and Mr. Nussbaum.  Mr. Neuwirth, according to an electronic mail message from Linda Tripp to Ms. Gorham, "briefed us on comportment and interrogation."(545)
<P>During this meeting on July 21, Ms. Gorham told Mr. Nussbaum that Mr. Foster had "placed shredded remnants of personal documents"(546) in his briefcase.  Ms. Gorham wrote to Ms. Tripp in an e-mail that "I told Bernie in front of everybody that shredded remnants were in the bag,"(547) an exchange that Ms. Tripp recalled.(548)
<P>Captain Hume and FBI special agent Dennis Condon interviewed Betsy Pond, Mr. Nussbaum's secretary, in Mr. Sloan's presence.  According to Captain Hume's report of the interview, Mr. Sloan took notes during the entire interview.  At one point, "Bernard Nussbaum burst into the room and demanded, "is everything all right?"(549)  After being reassured, Mr. Nussbaum left.  Captain Hume asked Ms. Ponds whether she had been coached:
<P>When I questioned her if she had been told how to respond to our questions, she stated that Clifford Sloan (who was present during our interview) and Steve Neuwirth, both associate counselors, had called them all together on Wednesday evening and told them they would be questioned by the police and for them to tell the truth.(550)
<P>While Captain Hume and Agent Condon interviewed Ms. Pond, Detective Markland and FBI agent Scott Salter interviewed Deborah Gorham in the presence of Mr. Neuwirth.(551)  Mr. Neuwirth interjected at the end of the interview and "took Ms. Gorham out of the room to speak to her."(552)  They returned a short time later, "and Ms. Gorham stated that there was one thing she thought may be important that she recalled."(553)  Ms. Gorham then told the investigators that in the previous week, Ms. Gorham had, at Mrs. Foster's request, asked the White House credit union to credit Mr. Foster's pay on a weekly, rather than biweekly, basis to avoid overdrawing the family account.
<P>A similar incident occurred later in the day, after the Park Police had completed their interview with Ms. Gorham:
<P>At approximately 1450 hours, immediately after the inventory of Mr. Foster's Office by White House Counsel (reference report under this case file number by Capt. Hume), Detective Markland and S/A Salter were asked to remain and were ushered into Mr. Nussbaum's office by Mr. Neuwirth.  Ms. Gorham was brought in and she stated that she had just remembered some conversations that she thought were important to our investigation.(554)
Ms. Gorham then told the investigators that Mr. Foster's son and wife had called within the last two weeks to ask about Mr. Foster's mood.(555)
<P>Detective Markland testified that he believed the attorneys from the White House counsel's office attended the interviews in order to "report back to Mr. Nussbaum what was being said in the interviews."(556)  Because the White House lawyers were present, "[t]he atmosphere of those interviews made it impossible to establish any kind of relationship with the people being interviewed."(557)  The lawyers created an "intimidating situation" and therefore the interviews were not very productive.(558)  According to Detective Markland:  "It was my belief that the staff members that we were interviewing had been briefed beforehand and would say no more than what they were told they should tell us."(559)  "Everyone I interviewed on this day up there I felt had been talked to by Mr. Nussbaum or his staff and knew exactly what they were going to say, nothing more, nothing less.  And that was it.  They all came off very rehearsed."(560)
B.<P>The First Lady, Margaret Williams, Susan Thomases and Bernard Nussbaum Conduct a Series of Early Morning Telephone Calls.
<P>At 7:44 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) on July 22, Margaret Williams, the Chief of Staff to the First Lady, called Mrs. Clinton at her mother's house in Little Rock.(561)  They talked for seven minutes.  This call set off a chain reaction of further calls.
<P>At 6:57 a.m. Central Daylight Time, or 7:57 a.m. EDT,  Mrs. Clinton called the Mansion on O Street,(562) a small hotel where Susan Thomases usually stayed in Washington, D.C.(563)  The call lasted three minutes.(564)  Ms. Thomases, a New York lawyer, is a close personal friend of President and Mrs. Clinton.  She has known the President for 25 years and Mrs. Clinton for almost 20 years.(565)  She was an adviser to the Clinton 1992 presidential campaign on the Whitewater issue, and remained in a close circle of confidants to the Clintons after the election.(566)  Susan Thomases was the third person Mrs. Clinton called after she learned of Mr. Foster's death, and they talked for 20 minutes.(567)  
<P>After her conversation with Mrs. Clinton, at 8:01 a.m. EDT, Ms. Thomases paged Bernard Nussbaum at the White House, leaving her number at the Mansion on O Street.(568)  After Mr. Nussbaum answered the page, Ms. Thomases and Mr. Nussbaum both agree that they talked about the upcoming review of documents in Mr. Foster's office.(569) 
<P>Associate White House Counsel Stephen Neuwirth, who was formerly an associate at Mr. Nussbaum's law firm in New York City, testified that Mr. Nussbaum told him that Ms. Thomases and Mrs. Clinton were concerned about investigators having "unfettered access" to Mr. Foster's office.  "Again, while I don't remember his exact words, in a very brief discussion, my understanding was that Ms. Thomases and the First Lady may have been concerned about anyone having unfettered access to Mr. Foster's office."(570)  Mr. Neuwirth thought that the conversation occurred on July 22, before the scheduled document review with law enforcement officials.(571)
<P>Ms. Williams initially did not tell the Special Committee about her early morning phone call to the Rodham residence.(572)  After obtaining her residential telephone records documenting the call, the Special Committee voted unanimously to call Ms. Williams back for further testimony.  When presented with these records, Ms. Williams testified:  "If I was calling the residence, it is likely that I was trying to reach Mrs. Clinton.  If it was 6:44 in Arkansas, there's a possibility that she was not up.  I don't remember who I talked to, but I don't find it unusual that the Chief of Staff to the First Lady might want to call her early in the morning for a number of reasons."(573)
<P>Ms. Thomases testified that she did not give instructions to anyone about the search of Mr. Foster's office:
<P>While my memory is not perfect -- I just don't remember every person that I spoke to during those days.  But I do know that I never, I say never, received from anyone or gave to anyone any instructions about how the review of Vince Foster's office was to be conducted or how the files in Vince's office were to be handled.  I want to repeat that.  I never received from anyone or gave to anyone any instructions about how the review of Vince Foster's office was to be conducted or how the files in Vince's office were to be handled.(574)
She acknowledged paging Mr. Nussbaum on the morning of July 22, but maintained that "I was not looking for Bernie to talk about the review of documents in Vince Foster's office.  I was really trying to reach him to talk to about how he was feeling and how he was doing."(575)  
<P>Ms. Thomases did offer that she talked to Mr. Nussbaum about the review of documents in Mr. Foster's office, but only because Mr. Nussbaum initiated the subject:
<P>He obviously was very focused on the documents at that time, where I was not, and he proceeded to tell me not to worry, that he had a plan, that he was going to take care of him.  He was kind of, as I said in my deposition, he was sort of venting.  He seemed to have a very clear sense that he was on top of it; he was going to handle it; he was going to give Vince's documents to the Clinton's lawyers, and that he was going to protect all the Presidential papers.(576)
She told Mr. Nussbaum that his procedure "sounds good to me."(577)  Ms. Thomases testified that she did not express any view to Mr. Nussbaum that the police should not have unfettered access to Mr. Foster's office.(578)  Ms. Thomases maintained:  "I don't remember ever having a conversation with Hillary Clinton during the period after Vince Foster's death about the documents in Vince Foster's office."(579)
<P>After Ms. Thomases' initial testimony, the Special Committee obtained telephone records documenting that she talked with Mrs. Clinton for three minutes immediately prior to paging Mr. Nussbaum on July 22.  The Special Committee voted unanimously to call Ms. Thomases back for further testimony.  When presented with the new records, Ms. Thomases testified that "I know you think there is a relationship between those two calls."(580)  She maintained, however, that the two calls were not related.  She testified that her early-morning conversation with Mrs. Clinton was about "the possibility that I didn't feel well enough to go to Little Rock" for Mr. Foster's funeral.(581)  According to Ms. Thomases, she called Mr. Nussbaum because "I was worried about my friend Bernie, and I was just about to go into a very, very busy day in my work, and I wanted to make sure that I got to talk to Bernie that day since I had not been lucky enough to speak to him the day before."(582)
<P>Mr. Nussbaum had a markedly different recollection of his conversation with Ms. Thomases on July 22.  He testified that Ms. Thomases -- not he -- initiated the discussion about the procedures that he intended to employ in reviewing documents in Mr. Foster's office.  "The conversation on the 22nd was that she asked me what was going on with respect to -- what was going on with respect to the investigation or the examination -- the examination of Mr. Foster's office."(583)
<P>Beyond this, Mr. Nussbaum testified that Ms. Thomases "said people are concerned about whether I was using the correct procedure or whether the procedure was -- people were concerned or disagreeing, something like that, whether a correct procedure was being followed, whether I was using the correct procedure, whether it was proper to give people access to the office at all something like that."(584)  According to Mr. Nussbaum, Ms. Thomases never specified who the mysterious "people" were to whom she was referring,(585) nor did Mr. Nussbaum understand who they were.(586)
<P>Mr. Nussbaum claimed that he resisted the overtures of the First Lady's close advisor:
<P>But I said Susan -- she wasn't in the White House -- at least I didn't know she was in the White House -- I said I'm having discussions with various people.  As far as the White House is concerned, I will make a decision as to how this is going to be conducted.  It's going to be done the right way.  It will balance out the various interests.  It's going to be done the way I think it should be done.(587)
<P>And, Mr. Nussbaum further testified that Mrs. Clinton did not convey to him, directly or indirectly, her views on how to conduct the search of Mr. Foster's office.(588)  Mr. Nussbaum did not recall telling Mr. Neuwirth that Ms. Thomases and Mrs. Clinton were concerned about the police having unfettered access to Mr. Foster's office.(589)
<P>Apparently, Ms. Thomases did not give up easily.  In the late morning of July 22, senior White House officials, including Mr. Nussbaum and Mr. Neuwirth, met in the office of Chief of Staff Thomas McLarty to discuss the upcoming review of Mr. Foster's office.(590)  At about the time of this meeting, between 10:48 a.m. and 11:54 a.m., Ms. Thomases called Mr. McLarty's office three times and Ms. Williams' office three times.(591)
<P>When asked about the coincidence of these telephone calls, Ms. Thomases testified that she "never actually remember[ed] speaking with Mack McLarty at his number during this period."(592)  With respect to the repeated calls to the office of the Chief of Staff to the First Lady, Ms. Thomases testified that she probably was attempting not to reach Ms. Williams but rather to be transferred to someone else in the White House.(593)  Although she testified that July 22 was "a very, very busy day in my work,"(594) Ms. Thomases suggested that she also may have been put on hold during these lengthy calls, for as long as nine minutes.(595)
<P>Ms. Williams testified that she could not recall talking with Ms. Thomases and suggested that she was at home in the morning of July 22.(596)  This explanation was contradicted by Secret Service records indicating that Ms. Williams had entered the White House at 8:10 a.m. that morning.(597)
C.<P>The White House Breaks Its Agreement with the Justice Department:  "A Terrible Mistake."
<P>By the time senior Justice Department attorneys David Margolis and Roger Adams arrived at the White House at 10:00 a.m. on July 22, 1994, Mr. Nussbaum had a change of heart.  He "announced that he had decided to change the procedure for the search or inventory of the office.  He said that he alone would look at each document to determine relevance and privilege, and that we would not be doing that."(598)  
<P>According to Roger Adams, the Justice Department officials "pointed out that that was completely inconsistent with the agreement of the day before, and we argued with Mr. Nussbaum.  We said this was not what we had agreed to, that he was making a mistake, and we were going to have to call our boss, the Deputy Attorney General."(599)  According to Mr. Margolis, Mr. Nussbaum said that there had been a change of plans, "that he would look at the materials to determine whether they were relevant, make the first cut, and determine the privilege issues and the sensitivity issues.  And then anything that met all his standards along those lines, if we still wanted to see, he would show us."(600)
<P>Upset, Mr. Margolis immediately called Mr. Heymann from Mr. Nussbaum's office phone.(601)  "I called Mr. Heymann and explained this change to him.  And we discussed it.  We were both dead set against it."(602)  Both were surprised by Mr. Nussbaum's new plan, which they thought was wrong.  According to Mr. Margolis, "We were very concerned as to how this would appear to the public in terms of law enforcement, and in terms of whether we were running a credible investigation."(603)  Mr. Heymann testified that "Mr. Margolis told me that Mr. Nussbaum had said to me that they had changed the plan, that only the White House counsel's office would see the actual documents."(604)  Mr. Heymann then asked to speak to Mr. Nussbaum.
<P>When Mr. Nussbaum got on the telephone, Mr. Heymann warned him sternly that "this was a terrible mistake":(605)  
<P>I remember very clearly sitting in the Deputy Attorney General's conference room picking up the phone in that very big room.  I remember very clearly being very angry and very adamant and saying this is a bad -- this is a bad mistake, this is not the right way to do it, and I don't think I'm going to let Margolis and Adams stay there if you are going to do it that way because they would have no useful function.  It would simply look like they were performing a useful function, and I don't want that to happen.(606)
<P>According to Mr. Heymann, Mr. Nussbaum was surprised at Mr. Heymann's reaction and wanted to check with unspecified others before making a final decision.  "[H]e was taken aback by my anger and by the idea that I might pull out the Justice Department attorneys and he said I'll have to talk to somebody else about this or other people about this, and I'll get back to you, Phil."(607)
<P>Mr. Nussbaum feared that the Justice Department officials would not attend the document review.  He specifically told Mr. Heymann: "don't call Adams and Margolis back to the Justice Department.  I'll get back to you."(608)  Notwithstanding this explicit promise, Mr. Nussbaum never called Mr. Heymann back.(609)
<P>The nearly contemporaneous notes21  of Cynthia Monaco, Special Assistant to the Deputy Attorney General, confirmed Mr. Heymann's testimony:    
<P>The next day [July 22] was a disaster.  I first realized there was a problem when I saw Phil Heymann on the phone with Bernie Nussbaum.  I walked into the conference room and sat down.  This was probably about 10:30 or 11 in the morning when he should have been in the Crime Bill pre-meeting in room 4118.  Phil was on the phone with Bernie Nussbaum and he said: "you are messing this up very badly.  I think you are making a terrible mistake."  And what I took it to mean, in the context of the general conversation was that Bernie had refused to let David and Roger take a look at the documents.(610)
Mr. Nussbaum denied having this conversation with Mr. Heymann.(611)
<P>After Mr. Heymann and Mr. Nussbaum finished their conversation, Mr. Margolis returned to Mr. Nussbaum's office and spoke with Mr. Heymann.(612)  Mr. Margolis thought that even if Mr. Nussbaum did not change his mind, the Justice Department attorneys should remain at the White House because "we really had no choice.  Walking away was not really an option, because we had no sense of when the search would be conducted by Mr. Nussbaum, and what the parameters would be, and just what would happen, although we agreed we had to push with all our might to try to change it around.  And that's what we did."(613)  Mr. Margolis thought that Mr. Heymann agreed with this course of action.(614)
<P>Mr. Heymann, however, assumed from his conversation with Mr. Nussbaum that Mr. Nussbaum, after his consultations, would call Mr. Heymann back to let him decide what to do.  "And I also thought that I had an understanding that nothing would happen without my at least being informed and having an opportunity to react."(615)  Mr. Heymann believed that the search would not go forward until Mr. Nussbaum called him back.(616)
<P>After he got off the telephone with Mr. Heymann, Mr. Margolis tried again in vain to convince Mr. Nussbaum that the new procedures were "a big mistake."
<P>I explained to Mr. Nussbaum that to do it his way would be a big mistake.  I said, "It was your mistake if you do it this way, but it is a big mistake."  I think it was at that point when I also said to him, "You know, if this were IBM that we were talking about, I would have a subpoena duces tecum returnable forthwith with these documents.  But I recognize this is not IBM."  And he made a facetious comment about, if this were IBM rather than the White House counsel's office, a smart lawyer would have removed the documents before the subpoena ever got there.  That I took as a facetious comment.  Anyway, he wasn't talking about what he would do.(617)  
<P>Mr. Margolis stressed the importance of maintaining the public perception of a credible and thorough investigation.(618)  He believed that law enforcement officials must have a substantive role in the review process and not be "excess baggage," as they would be under Mr. Nussbaum's new plan; "I might as well go back to my office, and he could mail the results of the search back to me."(619)
<P>According to Mr. Margolis, Mr. Nussbaum conceded that having the investigators attend the review was mostly out of concern for "show and appearances."(620)  Fearing that the lawyers would leave, Mr. Nussbaum insisted that they wait in the White House lobby:
<P>He made it very apparent that he would be really appreciative if we didn't leave in the interim.  I think I have said something about, "Maybe in any event I'll go back to the office while you're thinking about it, and I can always get back here in 15 minutes if I decide to and I want to and if I have to."  But he very much requested that we just wait.(621)
<P>Mr. Adams and Mr. Margolis then waited in the lobby of the White House.(622)  At one point, the Justice Department attorneys went outside.  Believing that Mr. Adams and Mr. Margolis had left the White House, the White House lawyers went out to look for them. "Bernie had said he had thought, when he couldn't find us in the lobby, that we might have left and he was concerned about that."(623)  Mr. Nussbaum did not remember Mr. Margolis threatening to leave the White House.(624)
<P>The notes of Adams of the morning's events confirmed Mr. Margolis' recollection:
<P>The next morning [July 22], however, Mr. Nussbaum had changed his mind and said he would look at the documents and decide privilege issues himself.  The Justice Department attorneys pointed out that that was inconsistent with the previous day's agreement and would cause problems.  We stated that the Counsel's Office would be better off to allow the Department attorneys to decide or at least help decide privilege issues, because that would allow the White House to say that the issue was considered independently.  Moreover, we stated that we had been asked to undertake this particular assignment in part because we had reputations of not talking to the press or "leaking."  Mr. Nussbaum did not immediately begin the search but waited for about two and one half hours -- during which time he said he was considering whether to allow us to see the documents -- before deciding that only he and Associate Counsels Neuwirth and Sloan would see the documents.(625)
<P>Mr. Nussbaum admitted that he discussed with various people how to conduct the search on July 22.(626)  But he did not recall a specific discussion with Mr. Margolis in the morning during which Mr. Margolis and Mr. Adams objected to his proposed procedure.(627)  And, he did not recall Mr. Margolis or Mr. Heymann telling him that he was making a mistake.(628)  Although Mr. Nussbaum could not remember speaking with the Justice Department officials, he did acknowledge conversations with a number of senior White House officials who were concerned about the search.(629)
<P>In particular, John Quinn, then Chief of Staff and Counselor to the Vice President and now Counsel to the President, advised Mr. Nussbaum that only White House officials should be allowed access to Mr. Foster's office.(630)  "He thought it was a terrible mistake and stressed it very firmly."(631)  According to Mr. Quinn:
<P>I wanted to be sure that somebody with the appropriate level of security clearance and who was privy to the attorney-client relationship first went through the office in order to ascertain if national security materials or privileged communications were present and, if so, to take steps to segregate them.(632)
D.<P>The Window-Dressing Review of the Documents in Mr. Foster's Office.
<P>After lunch, at about 1:15 p.m., Mr. Nussbaum summoned the law enforcement officials to attend the review of the contents of Mr. Foster's office.(633)  Mr. Nussbaum then announced that he alone -- and no law enforcement official -- would review the documents in his now deceased deputy's office.  According to Mr. Margolis:
<P>So we ate, we came back in, and that's when Bernie told us he had given due consideration to our arguments, he thought they were good arguments, but he was sticking with doing it his way, which was he would review the documents, tell us generically what they were, if there wasn't a problem with them and if they had any sense of being germane, let us look at them.(634)
<P>Mr. Nussbaum testified that the career law enforcement officials initially resisted his plan, but then "went along."(635)  After Mr. Nussbaum indicated that law enforcement officials would not be allowed to review Mr. Foster's papers, Mr. Margolis said, "`It's a  mistake. . . .  But it's your mistake.  So, okay.'"(636)  Mr. Margolis also told Mr. Nussbaum, "You know, if this were IBM that we were talking about, I would have a subpoena duces tecum returnable forthwith for these documents.  But I recognize this is not IBM."(637)
<P>The group entered Mr. Foster's office to observe Mr. Nussbaum conduct the review.  Present were Mr. Nussbaum, Mr. Burton, Mr. Sloan, and Mr. Neuwirth from the White House; Captain Hume and Detective Markland from the Park Police; Agents Salter and Condon from the FBI; Messrs. Margolis and Adams from the Justice Department; Paul Imbordino and Paul Flynn from the Secret Service; and Michael Spafford, a private attorney who represented the Foster family.(638)
<P>During the document review, according to Mr. Adams, "Mr. Nussbaum was seated at Vince Foster's desk.  Standing behind him were Steve Neuwirth and Cliff Sloan.  Mr. Margolis and myself and the law enforcement officers were seated in what I describe as a rough semicircle around the desk in sort of rough rows.  Standing off to one side was the Foster family's attorney Mr. Spafford."(639)
<P>According to Captain Hume's report of the review:  "The eight law enforcement officers were gathered on the opposite side of the desk and room in a position where we couldn't examine any documents."(640)  Detective Markland confirmed that the law enforcement officers were specifically placed where they could not see the documents as Mr. Nussbaum was reviewing them.(641)
<P>Mr. Nussbaum then reviewed the documents in Mr. Foster's office.  He briefly described the documents and placed them into three categories.  Mr. Margolis and FBI agent Adams believed that one pile consisted of personal materials that were going to the Foster family; the second pile consisted of official White House documents that were to be distributed to other White House attorneys; and the third consisted of the Clintons' personal documents, which were to be sent to the Clintons' personal lawyer.(642)  The Park Police detectives described the three categories as follows:  (1) documents of potential interest to law enforcement; (2) documents concerning White House business with no relevance to the investigation;  and (3) personal papers of either the Clintons or the Foster family.(643)  Mr. Spafford, the Foster family attorney, wrote in a contemporaneous memorandum: "The documents were separated into three groups: personal matters, documents of potential interest to the investigators, and matters of no apparent interest."(644)
<P>Mr. Nussbaum provided a brief and generic description of the documents he reviewed.(645)  Captain Hume reported that "Bernard Nussbaum did the actual review of the documents in a very hurried and casual fashion."(646)  According to Mr. Adams:
<P>As best I can recall, with most of the documents he made just sort of a generic description, something like this is personal; this is going to the family of the -- this is something that Vince has been working on; it's relevant to work of the White House counsel's office; it's going to be distributed to other lawyers in the office. 
<P>
<P><P>Another thing he would say is this is something he had been working on for the President personally.  This is going to the President's outside attorney.  Now, there were occasions where some documents he would describe a little bit more -- a little bit more definitely than that, but it's my recollection that, in general, it was just a generic description of them.(647)
<P>Mr. Margolis recalled essentially the same rushed procedure:
<P>[Nussbaum] went through the items on and in and around Mr. Foster's desk and announced what they were, generically, like, "This file is a file of nominations that Vince was working on for the President.  It's not germane.  This is a matter that Vince was working on for the first family in their nonofficial capacity.  It's not germane."  Things like that.(648)
<P>At different times during the review, Mr. Margolis renewed his objections to Mr. Nussbaum's review.  In fact, Mr. Margolis specifically objected to the fact that Mr. Nussbaum's descriptions were so generic that they were of little assistance to the investigators.(649)  He remarked that "it gave me a bit of deja vu all over again of dealing with the CIA . . . ."(650)  FBI Agent Salter had a similar view:  "At one point, I recall that Mr. Nussbaum described documents as he went through, and declared that they were not pertinent to the investigation, and I know Mr. Margolis responded by saying how do we know if they're pertinent or not if we don't get to look at the documents."(651)  Mr. Adams recalled that, at some point, "Mr. Margolis again interposed an objection to the procedure.  He said, the best I can recall, that this was a mistake and that Mr. Nussbaum might as well conduct the review himself and mail us the results or mail Mr. Margolis the results."(652)
<P>Mr. Nussbaum took what the law enforcement officials thought were "extreme" positions to shield documents from their review.  According to the Park Police report:
<P>There was some conversation between Nussbaum and Margolis as to what constituted privileged communication.  Nussbaum carried his interpretation of what was considered privileged to the extreme; one example was when he picked up a xeroxed copy of a newspaper article and declared that it was privileged communication even though it had been in the newspapers.(653)
At no time during the approximately one-and-one-half hour period of the review did Mr. Nussbaum allow the law enforcement officials to examine any documents.(654)
<P>  The White House lawyers expressed concern -- to an unreasonable degree -- that the law enforcement officials might sneak a peak at Mr. Foster's documents.  According to the Park Police report: "At one point Special Agent Scott Salter got up to stretch and Clifford Sloan challenged him and asked him if he was standing up in an attempt to get a look at the documents."(655)  Agent Salter described the incident as follows:
<P>I was seated at the end of the sofa next to detective Pete Markland from the Park Police, and I think there was a third person seated at the opposite end from me.  And I think the review of documents had been going on for about 30 minutes with the three of us seated on the couch.  There wasn't a lot of room.  After about 30 minutes, I stood up and stood at the end of the couch, and in front of me was Mr. Margolis and then the desk. 

<P><P>After standing there for just a few minutes, Mr. Cliff Sloan looked at me and said, excuse me, agent, you aren't standing there so you can see the documents on Mr. Nussbaum's desk, are you?  And at that point I merely said that -- I told Mr. Sloan that I think he's getting carried away, and then Mr. Nussbaum interjected and said of course, we're all on the same side here, words to that effect.  And that was the end of the incident.(656)
Mr. Adams indicated that "the remark was (to put it charitably) extremely offensive."(657)  Mr. Margolis testified that he may have muttered an expletive after Mr. Sloan's remark.(658)  "I was bothered by that.  So, a minute later when Cliff was looking over Bernie's shoulder at some document that Bernie was looking at, I said, `Hey, Cliff, you're not looking over Bernie's shoulder so you can read the documents that he is looking at, are you?'"(659)  Mr. Sloan acknowledged the incident and apologized before the Special Committee, stating that his comment "was the wrong thing to say to a law enforcement official, or any person trying to do his or her job."(660)
<P>Toward the end of the review, Mr. Nussbaum announced that he would give Mr. Foster's personal papers and effects to Mr. Spafford, the Fosters' personal attorney.  Mr. Margolis objected, wanting to maintain the chain of custody within the government.(661)  The Park Police officers later told Mr. Margolis:  "we feel strongly that we would rather have the files go to Mr. Spafford and Mr. Hamilton because we would rather deal with them in the future than with White House counsel's office."(662)  Agent Salter confirmed Mr. Margolis' testimony:  "I think we all agreed it would be easier for the Park Police to have access to them if the family's attorney took them and they could be reviewed outside of the west wing of the White House."(663)
<P>During the review, the law enforcement officials requested that Mr. Nussbaum turn on the computer in Mr. Foster's office and examine its contents.(664)  According to Mr. Adams, Mr. Nussbaum refused because the computer might contain privileged information.(665)  Mr. Adams' memorandum about the review described the incident as follows:
<P>We asked to have the computer in Mr. Foster's office turned on.  Mr. Nussbaum said he did not know how to do so and, in any event, he would not do so in our presence in case there were privileged documents on the computer.  He said he would have a staff member examine the contents of the computer later after we left.  (Press reports in the morning newspapers of that day had stated, without attribution, that no suicide note had been found on his computer.)(666)
Mr. Spafford's handwritten notes of the meeting confirmed that Mr. Margolis asked Mr. Nussbaum to review the computer.(667)  Mr. Sloan's notes of the meeting listed the computer with an asterisk next to it.(668)
<P>Mr. Foster's burn bag was also in the office at the time of the search.  According to Agent Salter, Mr. Nussbaum looked in the burn bag and "said that there was nothing that was pertinent to the investigation."(669)  Mr. Spafford's notes listed the burn bag and indicated that it was picked up everyday.  Its contents were described as "h/w notes re GC [General Counsel] issues/all wk related".  Mr. Sloan's notes, however, contained a more detailed inventory of the contents of the burn bag:
<P>Burn bag

     -     ists<BR>
     -     background investigations [?]<BR>
     -     references to jobs<BR>
     -     arbitration of claims<BR>
     -     nothing personal<BR>
     -     campaign stuff(670)<BR>
<P>On July 27, after Mr. Neuwirth apparently discovered a handwritten note in Mr. Foster's briefcase, Linda Tripp sent the following electronic mail message to Deborah Gorham:
<P>it seems that whatever was uncovered by [Neuwirth], who summoned our boss, who then summoned BB, who then summoned H -- and whatever it was provoked a need for notetaking -- and had to do I presume with the burn bag -- I can't imagine that anyone as meticulous as this individual was, would have left anything he did not intend to be found.(671)
Ms. Tripp testified that "this individual" referred to Mr. Foster.(672)  Ms. Gorham replied to Ms. Tripp's message with the following: "What provoked COS [Neuwirth(673)] to call BWN [Nussbaum] was the briefcase.  Once BWN arrived, I forgot who went into VWF's office to get the Burn Bag.  But they must feel like a slapstick comedy by not returning the burn bag along with the briefcase."(674)  In another message on the same day, Ms. Gorham wrote to Ms. Tripp: "On Wednesday, I told Bernie that VWF had placed shredded remnants of personal documents in the bag.  On Thursday, I told Bernie in front of everybody that shredded remnants were in the bag."(675)  Ms. Tripp replied:  "I recalled the shredded talk, because when we spoke to [Neuwirth] and he briefed us on comportment and interrogation, you mentioned that -- that was on Wednesday evening, right?  So it took until MONDAY to figure out it should be looked at?  Christ.  And we're the support staff???????????"(676)
E.<P>Mr. Nussbaum's Failure to Search Properly Mr. Foster's Briefcase.
<P>Under any view, Mr. Nussbaum's effort to search Mr. Foster's briefcase was seriously deficient.  At the time of Mr. Nussbaum's review, the briefcase was located on the floor next to Mr. Foster's desk.(677)  Mr. Adams testified that Mr. Nussbaum "picked up the briefcase, announced that this was Vince's briefcase and he would proceed to inventory the items in the briefcase in the same manner as he had inventoried the items on the desk and credenza, and he proceeded to take files and documents from the briefcase and describe them as he described the other documents in the office."(678)  Agent Salter confirmed Mr. Adams' description.(679)
<P>Although notes taken by Mr. Spafford and Mr. Sloan indicated that the briefcase contained a copy of the White House Travel Office Management Review, Mr. Nussbaum did not disclose to investigators that most of the contents of the briefcase pertained to the Travelgate controversy.(680)  Among the contents was a notebook in Mr. Foster's hand relating to the entire Travel Office matter.   According to Mr. Spafford's notes, Mr. Nussbaum described the notebook as "Notebook of notes of meetings, GC [General Counsel] issues"; Mr. Sloan's notes similarly identified the notebook simply as "Notes re: meeting".(681)  After the review, Mr. Nussbaum removed Mr. Foster's notebook and other Travelgate files from the briefcase and kept it in his office until his resignation in March 1994.(682)  The notebook and documents in Mr. Foster's briefcase were not turned over to the Independent Counsel until April 5, 1995.(683)  
<P>The notebook and documents were never disclosed to Justice Department officials and FBI agents then investigating Travelgate and the handling of documents in Mr. Foster's office.  In fact, the Justice Department official responsible for the investigation, Office of Professional Responsibility Counsel Michael E. Shaheen, Jr., found out about the existence of Mr. Foster's notebook through a press report in July 1995.  Mr. Shaheen, enraged at Mr. Nussbaum's concealment of the notebook, wrote a memo to Mr. Margolis on the subject.  It stated in part:
<P>We were stunned to learn of the existence of this document since it so obviously bears directly on the inquiry we were directed to undertake in lat July and August 1993, by then DAG Philip Heymann -- that is, to review the conduct of the FBI in connection with its contacts with the White House on the Travel Office matter and to determine what Vince Foster meant by the statement in his note that "the FBI lied in their report to the AG."

<P>In a July 13, 1993 letter, President Clinton informed then Congressman Jack Brooks that the Attorney General was in the process of reviewing matters relating to the Travel Office, "and you can be assured that [she] will have the Administration's full cooperation in investigating those matters which the Department wishes to review."  While these may have been Mr. Clintons' views, the White House personnel with whom we dealt apparently did not share his commitment to full cooperation with respect to our investigation.  The recent disclosure of the Foster notebook confirms this.(684)
Mr. Shaheen, after outlining specific instances of noncooperation by the White House, concluded, "The fact that we have just now learned of the existence of obviously relevant notes written by Mr. Foster on the subject of the FBI report is yet another example of the lack of cooperation and candor we received from the White House throughout our inquiry."(685)
<P>Mr. Nussbaum testified that he did not recall, during the course of his review on July 22, ever picking the briefcase up off the floor(686) or looking into the briefcase as he was pulling out the files.(687)  Agent Salter testified, however, that Mr. Nussbaum picked up the bag, opened it by the handles, tilted it, and looked inside.(688)  Mr. Adams,(689) Agent Condon,(690) Agent Flynn,(691) Captain Hume,(692) Detective Markland(693), and Mr. Spafford(694) all confirmed that Mr. Nussbaum picked up the bag.
<P>Detective Markland testified that Mr. Nussbaum told the law enforcement officials that the briefcase was empty:
<P>He would reach down, take papers out of the briefcase, put them on the desk, go through them, put them in the appropriate piles.  When he got done, he said that's it, it's empty.  After that he picked up the briefcase with both hands, spread it apart a little bit, tilted it, put it back down and shoved it to the back of the room. I could see the briefcase lifted off the floor by him and tilted, put it down, said it was empty two times and moved it back.(695)

Detective Markland was certain that Mr. Nussbaum had looked in the bottom of the briefcase.  "He had a clear view of the briefcase on the floor so that he had it spread open with both hands and was looking down into the briefcase."(696)
<P>Agent Salter similarly confirmed that Mr. Nussbaum "stated that it was empty and he turned and placed it behind him against the wall."  Mr. Margolis likewise testified that "he did take files out of it, a number of files out of it, and then he told us, I don't remember the exact language, but told us that that was it, that there was nothing more."(697)
<P>Mr. Nussbaum contended that he did not recall the process described by Detective Markland,(698) and his White House colleagues concurred in Mr. Nussbaum's testimony  that he did not state that the briefcase was empty.(699)  
<P>The general impression of those at the review was that the briefcase was empty when Mr. Nussbaum was finished.  Thus, when Mr. Burton found out that Mr. Neuwirth had discovered a note in the briefcase, he said, "Well, you've really got to explain this because I saw Bernie empty it.  How could it have been in that briefcase?"(700)  
<P>The law enforcement officials present at the review agreed with Mr. Burton's assessment.  After the note was discovered, Captain Hume was skeptical that Mr. Nussbaum would not have seen a note in the briefcase on July 22.  Major Hines agreed with Captain Hume that "our oldest, blindest detective would have found the note."(701)  Detective Markland likewise testified that it was impossible for Mr. Nussbaum to miss a torn up note in the briefcase because "he is looking for documents, he has a co-worker and friend who is dead.  One of the things he may be looking for could presumably be ripped up, he is not a stupid person.  And he physically picked up the briefcase at one point and tilted it and I saw it come off the floor and tilt, and then he put it down and said it is empty."(702)  Detective Markland was blunt in his testimony:
<P>Q:<P>Do you think he [Nussbaum] was lying?
<P>A:<P>Yes, I think it would have been impossible for him to miss that many torn scraps of yellow paper out of a briefcase that he was searching on the 22nd.(703)
F.<P>The Foster Family Lawyer Overhears Discussion of the Scraps of Paper in Mr. Foster's Briefcase.
<P>Michael Spafford testified that, at the end of the review, he remained in the room as the law enforcement officials were leaving.  He and Mr. Nussbaum discussed the details of the transfer of Mr. Foster's personal effects to the family.  Mr. Sloan then approached Mr. Nussbaum with the briefcase open in his hands:
<P>At some point in time I was talking to Mr. Nussbaum, and at some point in time Mr. Sloan had the briefcase in his hand.  So I didn't see him pick it up.  And he made the comment at that point in time that there appeared to be scraps in the bottom of the briefcase.

<P>* * *

<P>He was standing, and he had it by the handles.  And he had it open like this, and he was looking into the briefcase.(704)
<P>According to Mr. Spafford, Mr. Nussbaum's response was dismissive.  "Mr. Nussbaum was sitting on the couch or sofa at the time, and his comment was something to the effect that we will get to all that later; we have to look through the materials and we will look through that later."(705)  Mr. Spafford had put away his materials and was gathering up Mr. Foster's personal effects at this point, so he was no longer taking notes of the meeting.(706)  The following week, right after he found out that Mr. Neuwirth had discovered a note in the briefcase, Mr. Spafford recounted the incident in a privileged conversation.(707)
<P>Mr. Nussbaum and his associate Mr. Sloan both testified that they did not recall this incident.  According to Mr. Sloan, "I have no recollection of anything remotely like that incident, and I think that I would recall it if it had happened.  Mr. Spafford and I have an honest difference in recollection on this point."(708)
<P>Mr. Spafford's testimony casts a cloud of doubt on the White House's assertions that the note in Mr. Foster's hand was actually "discovered" on July 26.  As Mr. Margolis testified to the Special Committee:
<P>I thought I had this figured out, that the torn-up scraps of paper were not in the briefcase the day that Mr. Nussbaum did the search in our presence.  That's what -- that was the explanation I came up with, and that somebody -- that it had never been there before and somebody put it in afterward or it had been there, somebody took it out and then decided they better put it back because there was public speculation of, you know, where is the suicide note.

<P><P>So, in my own mind, I speculated that must be what happened.  But then, when I picked up the paper one day and saw that Mr. Spafford said that the note had been in there when the search was conducted, I am at a loss now.  I just have no explanation.  I don't know.(709)
The Justice Department and the FBI did not have the information Mr. Spafford provided to the Special Committee when the FBI closed its investigation into the circumstances surrounding the discovery of the note.
G.<P>The Secretive, Real Review of the Contents of Mr. Foster's Office.
<P>At the conclusion of Mr. Nussbaum's review of the contents of Mr. Foster's office, the office was again locked, and the key given to Mr. Nussbaum.(710)  Detective Markland thought that the office would remain sealed:  "It was my understanding that the office would be again posted and left undisturbed."(711)
<P>Although the law enforcement officials understood that Mr. Nussbaum would go through some of the documents again,(712) Mr. Nussbaum did not notify them that he intended to conduct a second search of the office, almost as soon as they left, with Margaret Williams, Chief of Staff to the First Lady.(713)   
<P>The circumstances surrounding this second search remained mysterious for some time.  The White House did not disclose that Ms. Williams was involved in the review and removal of documents from Foster's office.  At a press conference on April 22, 1994, Mrs. Clinton was asked whether Ms. Williams was among those who removed documents from Mr. Foster's office.  Mrs. Clinton replied, "I don't think that she did remove any documents."(714)  On August 2, 1994, Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers echoed Mrs. Clinton's statement: "I think that it is true that Maggie didn't remove any documents from Vince's office; they were removed by Bernie Nussbaum."(715)
<P>The evidence demonstrates that the foregoing White House statements were false. 
Mr. Spafford testified that Mr. Nussbaum told Mr. Sloan at the end of the meeting that they would look through the materials again later.(716)  Mr. Sloan's notes of the meeting ended with the following: "get Maggie--go through office--get HRC, WJC stuff,"(717) but he testified that "I did not have contemporaneous knowledge of anything beyond what's in my notes on this."(718)
<P>At 3:05 p.m. on July 22, William Burton called Ms. Williams and left a message for her to call back.(719)  Twenty minutes later, Stephen Neuwirth called Ms. Williams and left the same message.(720)  Ms. Williams testified that she had no independent recollection of these calls other than from the message slips produced to the Special Committee.(721)
<P>Mr. Nussbaum testified that "[s]hortly after the search of Vince's office was completed, I asked Maggie Williams the First Lady's chief of staff, to help me transfer these files to the Clintons and to their personal lawyers."(722)  When Ms. Williams got there, "Maggie and I started looking to try to select--making sure we took Clinton personal files rather than any other files."(723)  Mr. Nussbaum stated that he and Ms. Williams went through Mr. Foster's office together.  "This is Maggie walks in.  Let's do this, Maggie.  We start doing it.  I may walk out to take a call.  We complete doing it, but it was done relatively promptly."(724)  
<P>Margaret Williams, however, testified that she took no part in the review of the files, that "it seemed pretty much settled" when she entered Mr. Foster's office.(725)  Mr. Nussbaum had already selected which files were to be removed.(726)  "I can't recall if he had the files boxed that he pointed to or designated as the files that he wanted me to get to Barnett or whether or not they were just in a stack on the table.  But it seemed like whatever he was doing, it was done."(727)  She acknowledged, however, that Mr. Nussbaum asked her to "eyeball" the room and see if he had missed something.  In this cursory look, Ms. Williams saw a file marked "taxes," picked it up, and placed it among the materials to be removed from Mr. Foster's office.(728)
<P>During this second review, Mr. Nussbaum asked Mr. Foster's secretary, Deborah Gorham, to help locate certain files.  Curiously, he specifically asked Ms. Gorham about "the file drawer that contained the President's and First Lady's personal and financial documents."(729)  When Ms. Gorham entered, Ms. Williams was in the office with Mr. Nussbaum.(730)22   Ms. Gorham then opened a drawer in Mr. Foster's desk and started reading the names of the file folders.  Mr. Nussbaum interrupted her and said that he would take care of this ministerial task himself.(731)  She left the office and was called back a bit later.(732)  In her second time in the office, she sat down at Mr. Foster's desk and opened his middle desk drawer, where she found Mr. Foster's personal items, "such as checks that were written to Mr. Foster and his life insurance policy."(733)
<P>Mr. Nussbaum testified that he had no recollection of asking Ms. Gorham to point out the Clintons' personal files.(734)  Ms. Williams testified that Ms. Gorham was in and out of the office, but that Ms. Gorham did not assist in the review process.(735)
H.<P>The Transfer of Clinton Personal Files to the First Family's Residence.
<P>When Ms. Gorham went into Foster's office at Mr. Nussbaum's request, she saw boxes in the office.(736)  Mr. Nussbaum later asked her to have the boxes moved out of Foster's office, and she asked Thomas Castleton, Special Assistant to the White House Counsel, to carry them.(737)  According to Ms. Gorham, "Mr. Castleton picked them up and carried them out behind Ms. Williams.  The last that I saw of them, noticed them, was in the door just outside of our suite."(738)
<P>Linda Tripp, whose desk was in the same area as Ms. Gorham, testified that she saw Mr. Castleton carry the boxes out of the office.  She later learned from Ms. Gorham and Mr. Castleton that the boxes were delivered to the White House residence.(739)
<P>Margaret Williams testified that when Mr. Nussbaum called her earlier in the afternoon, he instructed her to deliver the files to the Clintons' personal lawyers. "[H]e asked me if I would be responsible for getting the personal documents of the President and Mrs. Clinton, which he was compiling, as I understood it, and get them to their personal lawyer, who was at the time Bob Barnett of Williams & Connolly."(740)
<P>Ms. Williams made three calls that afternoon that ultimately determined where the files were moved to.  "I called Mrs. Clinton -- well, I had three calls.  I called Bob Barnett's office.  I don't know if I spoke to Bob Barnett or if I spoke to the person who works with him in his office.  I called Mrs. Clinton, who was in Arkansas, and then I called Carolyn Huber, an assistant to the President who was working in the White House."(741)
<P>In the first call, to Williams & Connolly, Mr. Barnett told her that he would send someone over to pick up the files.  "When I had talked to Mr. Barnett after speaking to Mr. Nussbaum, I had indicated that I was going to send some files over as soon as they got together, and he said that he would send someone to get them."(742)
<P>Later in the day, however, Ms. Williams shifted course -- for, as she now claims, an innocent reason.  She was simply too tired to wait for the messenger to come from a law firm located near the White House:  
<P>And, quite frankly, I was tired.  And when I thought about the time it would take -- if anyone has tried to get into the White House complex, the time it would take, both to get a messenger, clear them in and actually have them get in and collect the box, I decided I could be at home in that time, and I decided at that point that the sending and the waiting for someone to pick up the documents would have to wait until later.(743)
She then asked Mr. Barnett not to send the messenger.(744)
<P>Claiming to be unsure where to put the Clintons' personal files, Ms. Williams made her second phone call, to Mrs. Clinton in Arkansas:
<P>I told her that there were personal files that weren't going to get to the lawyer because I was just tired, and I was going to put them in the White House, in the residence, and where did she want them. 

<P>* * *

<P>It was a very short conversation.  I know I had three points that I wanted to make.  I was tired, the files weren't going, I was going to put them in the residence, where did she want them -- four points.(745)
Ms. Williams claimed implausibly not to have previously spoken to Mrs. Clinton about the files.  She testified that she did not tell Mrs. Clinton where she was or the contents of the files.(746)  According to Ms. Williams, Mrs. Clinton did not ask any questions -- not even one, but instead merely told her to call Carolyn Huber.(747)  This may seem strange, as it clearly did to the Committee, "but let me suggest to you that I could have told Mrs. Clinton that I was going to put 44 elephants in the White House the day after Vince died and she probably would have said okay."(748)
<P>Ms. Williams then made her third and final telephone call, to Ms. Huber, in order to arrange the transfer of the files to the residence.(749)
<P>Thus, Ms. Williams testified that, because she was tired, she made the independent determination to transfer the files to the residence.  "I had determined that I was going to take the files to the residence if they weren't going to the personal lawyer.  I made that determination."(750)  She claimed to have received no instructions to move the files to the residence, and she called Mrs. Clinton only to ask where the files should be placed.(751)
<P>Mr. Nussbaum had a different -- and less convoluted and more plausible -- recollection on this key point.  He testified that he and Ms. Williams discussed moving the files to the White House residence.  "Obviously, I presumed they were going to the residence, and I think Maggie and I probably discussed that.  That's the most likely, send them to the residence, and talk to the Clintons and they will be sent from the residence on to their personal attorneys."(752)  According to Mr. Nussbaum, he told Ms. Williams to take the files to the residence:
<P>Simply take the files, give them to the Clintons, which means give them to the Clintons in their residence. . . . And when you get instructions from them as to which personal attorney, although it's probably going to be Williams & Connolly, we'll send it over to Williams & Connolly.(753)
Ms. Williams said okay.(754)
<P>Mr. Castleton had worked on the 1992 Clinton campaign and was serving as a special assistant in the White House Counsel's Office in July 1993.(755)  His best recollection is that he picked up "a box or possibly two boxes"(756) in either Margaret William's office or Mrs. Clinton's office.(757)  "I believe that the office in which I picked up the box had some dress, and my recollection is based on having seen her physically carrying them inside the office."(758)
<P>Mr. Castleton and Ms. Williams then took the elevator down to the passage way connecting the offices of the West Wing with the White House residence.(759)  They walked through the Palm Room into the residence.(760)  They "stopped off for a brief time to pick up a set of keys or a key and proceeded up to the living quarters area of the residence."(761)  When they got to the living quarters on the third floor, Mr. Castleton put the box or boxes "in a room off of a passageway" near the elevator.(762)
<P>Ms. Huber had long ties to the Clintons.  She served as office administrator for the Rose Law Firm for twelve years and administrator of the Governor's Mansion.  Since February 1993, she has been Special Assistant to the President for Correspondence, a position that also called for her to maintain records and files in the residence.(763)  She testified that, in the late afternoon on July 22, Ms. Williams "called and said that Mrs. Clinton had asked her to call me to take her to the residence to put this box in our third floor office.  We call it an office.  And we have a little closet in there where I keep their financial records, so she asked that I would take it up and put it there."(764)  Ms. Williams had not previously spoken to Ms. Huber about storing records in the residence.(765)
<P>Ms. Huber told Ms. Williams to call her when she was ready to come over to the residence:
<P>I would meet them at the elevator that goes up into the residence.  I met her and this young man -- I do not remember him -- Mr. Castleton.  We went to the third floor.  We went into the room where we have our office.  There's a little closet in there.  I got the key out of the desk drawer, unlocked the closet and he put the box in.(766) 
Ms. Huber then locked the door.  She put the key back into the drawer, went downstairs, and left for home.(767)  She did not see any dresses.(768)
<P>Although Ms. Huber testified that the boxes were transported between 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m.,(769) records maintained by the Secret Service indicate that Ms. Huber, Ms. Williams, and Mr. Castleton went up to the third floor of the Residence at 7:25 p.m. and came down at 7:32 p.m.(770)
I.<P>The Reaction of Law Enforcement Officials to Mr. Nussbaum's Search.
<P>When Mr. Adams and Mr. Margolis returned to the Justice Department after Mr. Nussbaum's search of Mr. Foster's office, they were angry.  Phil Heymann remembered that "they were hurt and felt a little bit less than degraded, but almost degraded by the way it was done. And they were angry. And I remember their telling it to me in a way that they must have known was calculated to make me angry."(771)  Mr. Margolis and Mr. Adams complained to Mr. Heymann that the law enforcement officials were not permitted to look at the documents and that they did not have "any role at all to play with regard to decisions made about the documents."(772)  Cynthia Monaco's notes confirmed Mr. Heymann's recollection:
<P>I later heard from David that in fact what had happened was that Bernie looked at the documents and told him that a privilege was asserted or not asserted.  This was in contrast to what Phil and Bernie had decided the day before.(773)
<P>Mr. Heymann recalled a specific complaint that Mr. Nussbaum had asserted executive privilege "in a fairly casual way."(774)   Because Mr. Nussbaum alone saw the documents, "nobody knows what documents it is that Executive privilege is being asserted as to."(775)  Mr. Margolis testified that Mr. Nussbaum would not show him a clipping of a newspaper article on the grounds that it would be "an invasion of the President's deliberative process."(776)
<P>In any event, Mr. Heymann questioned the validity of Mr. Nussbaum's assertion of executive privilege against the Justice Department, the executive agency supervising the Office of the Legal Counsel, which had a primary function in protecting executive privilege.  "[T]he people who were going to have access to the documents would be officials of the Department of Justice. . . .  It wasn't like this was an outside body to whom there might be more reason to assert Executive privilege."(777)23   
<P>The Justice Department officials thought that they had been used by the White House to dress up Mr. Nussbaum's search of the office,(778) and they wanted to minimize the perception that law enforcement had actually participated in the search.  According to Mr. Margolis:  "Phil was troubled by that, and I think that's part of what he was talking about, that the impression was created that the Department of Justice did play a far larger role in the search than in fact it did."(779)
<P>After the search, the press reported that Mr. Foster's office had been searched under the "supervision" of the Justice Department.  This report prompted the Justice Department to issue a correction.  According to Mr. Margolis:  "I worried about something like that, and I remember with Mr. Heymann's permission, telling our press office to correct that, that the search was conducted in the presence of the Justice Department."(780)  Mr. Heymann testified that "I directed that the Department of Justice put out a correction that we had not supervised, that we had simply been there as observers while the investigation was carried out -- while the search was carried out by the White House counsel."(781) 
<P>After talking to Mr. Margolis and Mr. Adams on the evening of July 22 about Mr. Nussbaum's search, Mr. Heymann became very angry.  He said to Mr. Margolis, "`You know, Bernie was supposed to call me back and he didn't, and I am going to talk to him.'"(782)  Mr. Heymann then went home and called Mr. Nussbaum.  "I told him that I couldn't imagine why he would have treated me that way.  How could he have told me that he was going to call back before he made any decision on how the search would be done and then not call back?"(783)  Mr. Heymann said to Mr. Nussbaum, "You misused us."(784)  "I meant that he had used Justice Department attorneys in a way that suggested that the Justice Department was playing a significant role in reviewing documents when they had come back and told me they felt like they were not playing any useful role there."(785)
<P>Exasperated with Mr. Nussbaum's handling of the search, Mr. Heymann asked him:  "`Bernie, are you hiding something?'"(786)  According to Mr. Heymann, Mr. Nussbaum assured him that "no, Phil, I promise you we're not hiding something."(787)
<P>Incredibly, Mr. Nussbaum denies recalling this heated conversation with Mr. Heymann.(788)

<P>V.  July 26, 1995.
A.<P>The Existence of the Torn-Up Note Is Finally Revealed to Law Enforcement.
<P>The President, Mrs. Clinton, and most of the senior White House staff traveled to Arkansas for Mr. Foster's funeral on Friday, July 23, 1993.  On Monday, July 26, 1993, Mr. Nussbaum asked Mr. Neuwirth to prepare an inventory of the remaining contents of Mr. Foster's office.
<P>In the course of preparing the inventory, according to Mr. Neuwirth, he made an unexpected discovery in Mr. Foster's briefcase:
<P>On Monday the 26th at Mr. Nussbaum's request I was preparing an inventory of the contents of Mr. Foster's office.  One of the things that I did in connection with that inventory was to put into a box towards the latter part of my inventory process items that belonged to Mr. Foster personally, like photographs.  And in the process of putting materials in that box I saw the brief bag leaning against the back wall of Mr. Foster's office.  I understood it to be empty.  I knew that it belonged to Mr. Foster.  I picked it up and brought it to put into the box.  I had laid two large -- one or two or maybe even three large black and white photographs of Mr. Foster and his daughter with the President on the top of the box, and in an effort to avoid damaging those photographs, I turned the briefcase to fit it or the brief bag to fit it into the box, and in the process of turning it, scraps of paper fell out of the brief bag.(789)
<P>Mr. Neuwirth testified that, after he saw the pieces of paper falling out of the briefcase, he picked them up.  At that point, he recognized that "there was handwriting on them that looked like Mr. Foster's handwriting, with which I was familiar."(790)  He then looked in the bag for more pieces of paper.  Mr. Neuwirth then went to Mr. Nussbaum's office, which was adjacent to Mr. Foster's, and attempted to reassemble the torn up note on Mr. Nussbaum's conference table.(791)
<P>Mr. Neuwirth testified that, after he assembled the note, he went out to the secretarial area of the White House Counsel's suite and asked for Mr. Nussbaum.(792)  
<P>Mr. Nussbaum testified that he came back to his office at about 3:00 p.m. and found Mr. Neuwirth sitting at the conference table putting scraps of paper together.(793)  Mr. Nussbaum said, "What are you doing?"  Mr. Neuwirth replied, "I just found these.  I was packing Vince's briefcase to send back along with his other personal effects and I turn over the briefcase and these things floated out.  And I looked down and saw handwriting on them so I picked them up to see if I could put them together, and I'm putting them together."(794)  When Mr. Neuwirth was done, he told Mr. Nussbaum to look at the assembled note.  "[W]e saw that it was in Vince's handwriting, and it was a list of things, reflecting things that were troubling Vince."(795)
<P>Mr. Neuwirth discovered 27 pieces of a single sheet of yellow lined paper, 3-hole punched, which had been torn into 28 pieces.(796)  One piece was missing from the bottom third of the page, which appeared to be blank.  On the top approximate two-third of the page were written the following:
<P><P>I made mistakes from ignorance, inexperience 
<P>and overwork
<P><P>I did not knowingly violate any law or standard 
<P>of conduct
<P><P>No one in the White House, to my knowledge,
<P>violated any law or standard of conduct, including 
<P>any action in the travel office.  There was no intent 
<P>to benefit any individual or any group.
<P><P>The FBI lied in their report to the AG
<P><P>The press is covering up the illegal benefits 
<P>they received from the travel staff
<P><P>The GOP has lied and misrepresented its 
<P>knowledge and role and covered up a prior investigation
<P><P>The Ushers Office plotted to have excessive 
<P>costs incurred, taking advantage of Kaki and HRC
<P><P>The public will never believe the innocence 
<P>of the Clintons and their loyal staff
<P><P>The WSJ editors lie without consequence
<P><P>I was not meant for the job or the spotlight 
<P>of public life in Washington.  Here ruining people 
<P>is considered sport.(797)
Although the note was not signed, the FBI determined that it was written in Mr. Foster's hand.(798)24 
<P>Mr. Nussbaum then went to White House Chief of Staff Mack McLarty's office to tell him about the note, but realized that Mr. McLarty was not there; he was in Chicago with the President.  "So I saw Burton, who was a logical person to talk to in any event because he was the one who had been dealing with me, and I said look, Steve Neuwirth found something, and you should see it and let's go up and see it.  And we walked up, and he went over to read it."(799)  According to Mr. B:  "Mr. Nussbaum came into the chief of staff's reception area asking for Mr. McLarty.  We informed him that he was out of town.  Mr. Nussbaum asked me to accompany him to his office, and I did that."(800)  Mr. Burton went to Mr. Nussbaum's office and read the note in front of Mr. Nussbaum and Mr. Neuwirth.(801)
<P>Deborah Gorham and Linda Tripp were at their desks in the secretarial area of the White House Counsel's suite, right outside Mr. Nussbaum's office, on the afternoon of July 26.  Ms. Gorham testified that Mr. Neuwirth came out of Mr. Foster's office with Mr. Foster's briefcase and went into Mr. Nussbaum's office.  After Mr. Nussbaum returned with Mr. Burton, according to Ms. Gorham, others came into Mr. Nussbaum's office.  "And then I believe Mr. Burton, Bill Burton might have appeared next going into Mr. Nussbaum's office, and then other people, I think, came in straggling, but I don't recall who they were."(802)
<P>Ms. Tripp recalled that she later saw Clifford Sloan in Mr. Nussbaum's office.  "It was later in the evening; I was in the reception area.  The door to Bernie's office was closed.  At one point in time Cliff Sloan came out of Bernie's office and asked me if it was possible to remove one of the typewriters to bring back into Bernie's office."(803)  Ms. Tripp asked him why he wanted a typewriter when there were five computers in the suite, and Mr. Sloan replied that he needed a typewriter.(804)  There were two typewriters in the office, but Ms. Tripp explained to Mr. Sloan that "the way they were configured and plugged in under all the massive furniture with the taping to the carpet and the commingling of all the myriad cable underneath, that it would be a very difficult endeavor, and then I offered to get him a typewriter -- excuse me, from elsewhere."(805)  Mr. Sloan then said that he didn't want her to do that, and walked back into Mr. Nussbaum's office.  Mr. Nussbaum did not recall wanting a typewriter in his office, although he remembered wanting to transcribe the note.(806)  Mr. Sloan testified that he was sure that Ms. Tripp was mistaken, since he did not know of the note until the next day, July 27.(807)  
<P>The next morning, on July 27, Ms. Gorham and Ms. Tripp exchanged a series of electronic mail messages about the peculiar circumstances surrounding the discovery of the note.  Ms. Gorham wrote to Ms. Tripp: "Everything from his briefcase is missing. . . .  I do not know what else was in there but the bag is totally cleaned out except for one collar stay."(808)  In another message to Ms. Tripp, Ms. Gorham wrote:  "On Wednesday, I told Bernie that VWF had placed shredded remnants of personal documents in the bag.  On Thursday, I told Bernie in front of everybody that shredded remnants were in the bag."(809)  Ms. Tripp replied that she remembered Ms. Gorham telling Mr. Nussbaum about the shredded pieces at the meeting on Wednesday, July 21, when the White House Counsel's office briefed the staff about the Park Police interviews.  Ms. Tripp's message ended on a note of exasperation:  "So it took until MONDAY to figure out it should be looked at?  Christ.  And we're the support staff???????????"(810)
<P>Ms. Gorham testified that, some time in the evening of July 26 or the morning of July 27, Mr. Nussbaum grilled her about what she had seen in Mr. Foster's briefcase in the previous week:
<P>Ms. Gorham: Mr. Nussbaum asked me to sit at the chair on the opposite side of his table and asked me if I had seen anything in the bottom of Vince's briefcase.  And I told him that I had only seen the color yellow, and I had seen the top of the Goldcraft third cut folder, and that was all I had seen.
<P>Mr. Chertoff: When you say a Goldcraft third cut folder, you mean a folder like this, a manila-type folder?
<P>Ms. Gorham: Yes, sir.
<P>Mr. Chertoff: And you told Mr. Nussbaum you had seen that in Mr. Foster's briefcase at an earlier time?
<P>Ms. Gorham: I told him I had seen the top of that cut of the folder.
<P>Mr. Chertoff: And what did Mr. Nussbaum say to you?
<P>Ms. Gorham: He asked me repeatedly what I had seen.  He asked me if the yellow could have been paper.  Could it have been lined paper?  Could it have been -- what it could have been?  And I told him repeatedly, numerous times, that all that I had seen out of the corner of my eye was the color yellow and the top of a Goldcraft third cut folder such as you have.
<P>Mr. Chertoff:  Was there anybody else in the room during this discussion with Mr. Nussbaum?
<P>Ms. Gorham: Not that I recall.
<P>Mr. Chertoff: Have you previously described this as an interrogation?
<P>Ms. Gorham: That is exactly how I have described and that is how--that is what took place.
<P>Mr. Chertoff: And would you agree that he was adamant and very forceful in putting his questions to you?
<P>Ms. Gorham: Indeed I would.
<P>Mr. Chertoff: I take it this experience is still very vivid in your mind?
<P>Ms. Gorham: Absolutely.(811)
<P>Mr. Nussbaum testified that he had "some kind of a recollection" of questioning Ms. Gorham, but he denies grilling or interrogating her.(812)  He did not recall the specifics of his conversation with Ms. Gorham.  He did not recall her mentioning that she saw file folders or yellow paper in the briefcase.(813)
B.<P>The White House's Decision Not to Disclose the Note Immediately to Law Enforcement.
<P>At one point in the afternoon, Mr. Nussbaum talked with Mr. Sloan and Mr. Neuwirth about what to do with the note.  They agreed that the note was not a suicide note, but Mr. Nussbaum knew it was the type of document in which the law enforcement officials would have a strong interest.  "So it was not clearly a suicide note and therefore, the issue was raised, is this the kind of thing that we were searching for that day.  That was -- to me it was clear it was the kind of thing."(814)  Mr. Burton suggested that the note was possibly shielded from disclosure by the attorney-client privilege, or other privacy interests.
<P>According to Mr. Nussbaum, Mr. Burton argued that they should research these issues before deciding whether to turn the note over to the authorities.(815)  Mr. Burton testified that, although he did not initiate the discussion, he recalled that "an issue of privilege came up with respect to the note in that it was my understanding that counsel's office was going to look to see if there was anything in the note that gave rise to privilege."(816)  Although Mr. Nussbaum testified that Mr. Burton wanted to know whether there would be "an obstruction of justice issue" if they did not disclose the note to the authorities,(817) Mr. Burton testified that "[i]t was never considered seriously or trivially or any other way that the note would not be turned over.  From the time the note was found, certainly from the time I knew of the existence of the note, that was never in doubt."(818)
<P>Mr. Nussbaum testified that, out of concern for the privacy of Mrs. Foster and respect for the President, he decided to wait until the next day, July 27, before advising the police of the existence of the note.  "I don't want Lisa Foster to hear about this on the radio or on TV:"(819)
<P>Now, I know I can call her up and read it to her on the phone, but I wanted her to see this thing.  I wanted her to be able to digest it.  And she's in Arkansas.  I called Jim Hamilton.  I had a concern about Lisa Foster.  That was really my primary concern.  I had a concern about Lisa Foster, so I called Hamilton, and I discovered -- I believe I called Hamilton.  I discovered shortly thereafter that Lisa was going to be in the next day.  She was coming in to Washington the next day in connection with -- she's returning to Washington after the funeral.  She's going to be in the next day on the 22nd.  The President was out of town.  He was to come in late that night.  He would be available the next day. 

<P><P>I thought it was common decency, before I turn this over to law enforcement, to let Lisa see it and digest it and let the President see it and digest it, and I didn't see any harm in letting them have that.  In the meantime, we could do the research that Burton was talking about, although I didn't expect that research was going to produce anything that would change my decision.  So I made the decision to show the note the next day to Lisa and to show it to the President if he wanted to see it when he came in the next day.(820) 
<P>Mr. Nussbaum and Mr. Burton then called Mack McLarty, who was in Chicago with the President.  Mr. McLarty told David Gergen, who recommended that Mr. McLarty tell the President and then promptly turn the note over to the authorities.(821)  Mr. McLarty decided, however, to wait until the next day, when the President returned to Washington, D.C., to take any action, including informing the President of the existence of the note.(822)
<P>Mr. Nussbaum assumed, on July 26, that Mr. McLarty would tell President Clinton about the note.(823)  Senator Grams questioned Mr. McLarty's decision to wait, even though Mr. Foster was a personal friend of the President and the "apparent suicide of the White House deputy counsel was big news at the time."(824)  Mr. McLarty replied: 
<P>When the note or scraps of paper were reported to me by telephone, I was perplexed when I heard of it.  We had just put, had the funeral for Vince and were moving forward, and I was perplexed by it.  I was in a hotel room in Chicago.  I didn't understand it.  It did not refer to suicide.  Did not have a salutation or a signature.  At that point there were issues - there were legal issues that were raised with me that I took seriously, that were raised in a serious way, that Mr. Nussbaum and others wanted to reflect on.  There was the issue of notifying the family.  And because I was perplexed by the note, I did want to see it, and I simply felt that it was not the correct course at that time to tell the President of a situation that was really not complete, that had not been reviewed and we had no plan of action.(825) 
Mr. Gergen took a commercial flight back from Chicago on July 26.  The President and Mr. McLarty flew back to Washington together, but Mr. McLarty claims that he did not tell the President about the note during the entire flight.(826)  Mr. Nussbaum did not wait at the White House on July 26 for the President's return.(827) 
C.<P>Mrs. Clinton and Susan Thomases Are Told of the "Discovery" of the Note.
<P>In the afternoon of July 26, while Mr. Burton was still in Mr. Nussbaum's office, Mr. Nussbaum left to get Mrs. Clinton.  Mr. Nussbaum recalled Mrs. Clinton's having an emotional reaction when she saw the note.  "She walked over and glanced -- looked at it.  I may have told her -- this is the thing.  I may have told her look, we found something Vince wrote. I'm not positive of it.  I don't have a specific memory of it, but it's something Vince wrote.  It's something you should read.  So my best memory is she sort of knew what she was going to look at, and she just -- [S]he looked at it, and all of a sudden she had some sort of an emotional -- she began to read it but she didn't read it.  She didn't appear to read it.  When she sat down and looked at it, she just said -- she had an emotional reaction and she said I just can't deal with this.  This is like -- I just can't deal with this.  Bernie, you deal with this.  And she walked out of my office."(828)
<P>In Mr. Burton's view, however, Mrs. Clinton had a different reaction to the note.  According to Mr. Burton, as Mr. Nussbaum was reading her the note, "she interrupted him and questioned her having been brought into the room and left the room."(829)  "She explained that she did not understand why she had been brought into the room, that the decisions to be made concerning the privilege issues, notifying the Foster family were other people's decision to make and she left the room."(830)
<P>Mr. Nussbaum testified that Mrs. Clinton did not discuss with him at all the handling of the note.(831)
<P>Susan Thomases testified that, at some point on July 26 and before even the President, the Foster family, the Park Police, or the Department of Justice were notified,(832) Mr. Nussbaum called and told her about the note.  "The substance is that a writing had been found and that he was going to wait until the President got back to show it to the President."(833)  Mr. Nussbaum denied contacting Ms. Thomases on July 26 about the note.(834)
<P>The Park Police and the FBI later interviewed, among others, Mr. Burton, Mr. Gergen, Mr. McLarty, Mr. Neuwirth, Mr. Nussbaum, and Mr. Sloan about the circumstances surrounding the discovery of the note.  None of the reports of these interviews mentioned the fact that Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Thomases were among those who saw or knew of the note before it was disclosed to the law enforcement officials.(835)
<P>Mr. Neuwirth testified that, although he was not asked about it, he told the FBI during his interviews that the Mrs. Clinton had been made aware of the note:
<P>I remember being asked questions.  I remember being conscious of the fact that when they asked me questions about what happened on that night, I had not been asked questions that would have covered the period when the First Lady was present, but I went out of my way at the conclusion of the interview to tell them -- when they asked me who else I knew had been told about the note, I went out of my way to point out that the First Lady was one of the people that I knew had been made aware of the note prior to the time that I understood it had been given to law enforcement officials.  And I'm very conscious of the fact that I made that effort precisely because I didn't think I had been asked a question earlier in which there would have been an opportunity to talk about the fact that the First Lady had come to look at it that night.(836)
<P>However, the FBI report of Mr. Neuwirth's interview, which summarized his account of the time between the discovery of the note and its disclosure to law enforcement, did not mention that Mrs. Clinton had been told of the note -- an important fact that a trained agent would almost certainly include in such a report.(837)  The handwritten notes of that interview, taken by Agent Salter, recorded a lengthy narrative by Mr. Neuwirth of the events on July 26 and July 27.  But nowhere in the narrative, according to the notes, did Mr. Neuwirth refer to either Mrs. Clinton or Ms. Thomases.(838)
<P>Mrs. Clinton's schedule for July 27, the day after the discovery of the note, indicated that Mrs. Clinton had a private meeting in her office with Mr. Nussbaum and Mr. Neuwirth from 2:30 p.m. to 3:00 p.m.--several hours before the note was turned over to the authorities.(839)  The schedule, however, did not specify the topic of the meeting.
<P>Mr. Burton testified that he does not recall any discussions in the White House about whether the law enforcement authorities should be told that Mrs. Clinton had seen the note.(840)  Curiously, Mr. Burton's notes of a staff meeting on July 28, the day after the note was disclosed to the authorities, listed "HRC" with a telling arrow pointing to an adjacent letter "n".(841)  Mr. Burton testified that he did not know what his own notes -- particularly the reference to the letter "n" -- meant.(842)

<P>VI.  July 27, 1993
A.<P>The Review and Transfer of Clinton Personal Files From the White House Residence to Williams & Connolly.
<P>On the afternoon of July 22, and after Mr. Nussbaum's real search, Thomas Castleton, an assistant in the White House Counsel's office, helped Margaret Williams remove boxes from Mr. Foster's office to the White House Residence.  As they were walking, Ms. Williams told Mr. Castleton that the boxes had to be taken to the residence for an important purpose:  the President or Mrs. Clinton needed to review their contents.(843)  According to Mr. Castleton:  "What [Ms. Williams] said was that the boxes contained personal and financial records pertaining to the First Family and that we were moving the boxes to the residence for them to be reviewed."(844)  Ms. Williams said that the files needed to be reviewed because "they did not know what was in these files and needed to determine whether there was something of a personal nature or not."(845)  "She said that the President or the First Lady had to review the contents of the boxes to determine what was in them."(846)
<P>Ms. Williams did not recall any such conversation with Mr. Castleton.  Ms. Williams testified that such a conversation would be out of character for her because "it is highly unlikely I would have this kind of discussion with an intern:"(847)
<P>Well, I would like to say affirmatively I did not say it because I can't imagine why I would have that discussion with an intern about the files going to the President and the First Lady.  I know that I told him we were going to the residence because I figured he needed to know where he was going, but I can't imagine that I said more than that.  So I do not recall having that discussion with him.(848)
<P>Mr. Castleton took exception with Ms. Williams' characterization of his role at the White House:  he was not an intern, but a special assistant to the White House Counsel.(849)
<P>Ms. Williams claimed that no one reviewed the Clintons' personal files while they were stored in the residence.  According to Ms. Williams, Carolyn Huber gave Ms. Williams the key after Ms. Huber locked the closet on Thursday, July 22.(850)  Ms. Williams put the key on her key chain and held it through the weekend, taking it with her to Mr. Foster's funeral in Arkansas.(851)
<P>Ms. Huber, however, testified that, after she locked the closet on July 22, she returned the key to its usual keeping place, in an envelope in the desk drawer of the office in the residence.(852)  The envelope was marked clearly:  "It said `key to the closet.'"(853)  The drawer was not locked, according to Ms. Huber, and therefore the key was readily available to anyone with access to the residence.(854)
<P>The plot thickens.  Although Ms. Williams testified that the files remained undisturbed until she transferred them to Williams & Connolly on July 27, Mr. Nussbaum testified that, a couple of days after the files were removed from Mr. Foster's office on July 22, Ms. Williams returned a Mr. Foster file to him because it should not have been among the Clintons' personal documents.  "I'm not quite sure Ms. Williams returned the document.  I believe Ms. Williams returned the document.  A residence file was returned.  There was a file that was returned because we were making an effort to send over solely personal documents which had been used -- yes -- which were in the White House counsel's office because there was an official purpose."(855)25 
<P>Mrs. Clinton's official schedule showed that she had two private meetings with Ms. Williams on July 27, one from 9:15 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. and another from 10:30 a.m. to 11:30 a.m.(856)  Although the schedule listed Mrs. Clinton's office as the location of the meetings, records of movements within the White House maintained by the Secret Service and the White House Usher's Office indicate that Mrs. Clinton did not leave the White House Residence at all that day.(857)  Records maintained by the Secret Service and the White House Usher's office indicated that Ms. Williams was in the White House Residence on July 27 from 10:31 a.m. to 12:05 p.m., 1:35 p.m. to 2:25 p.m., and 3:20 p.m. to 4:43 p.m.(858) 
<P>Ms. Williams testified that on July 27, Robert Barnett, a partner at the law firm Williams & Connolly and the Clintons' personal attorney, came to the White House to see Mrs. Clinton.  By chance, Ms. Williams claims that she ran into Mr. Barnett while he was on the second floor of the White House Residence talking to Mrs. Clinton.(859)  According to Ms. Williams, Mr. Barnett said, "you know what?  It would make sense to get those documents over to the office,"(860) referring to the documents that Ms. Williams had moved from Mr. Foster's office to the Residence on July 22.  Mr. Barnett then called from the residence for another person from Williams & Connolly to come for the documents.  When that person arrived, according to Ms. Williams, she accompanied him to the residence, unlocked the closet with the key on her keyring, and pointed the documents out to him.(861)
<P>Mr. Barnett had a far different and more believable recollection of Ms. Williams' role in the transfer of the files.  He testified that Ms. Williams called him specifically to arrange a transfer of the files, and "I spoke with her about picking up the documents."(862)  On July 27, he went to the White House to pick up the documents.  Capricia Marshall, Ms. Clinton's assistant, met him at the gate, signed him in with the Secret Service, and escorted him to the Second Floor to wait for Ms. Williams.(863)  Records show that Mr. Barnett arrived at the White House at 2:57 p.m.(864), registering "First Lady" as his visitee with Secret Service, and entered the White House Residence at 3:03 p.m.(865)  About 20 minutes later, Ms. Williams came and escorted Mr. Barnett up to the third floor closet where the files were kept.(866)  The box was open, and Mr. Barnett went through the files, briefly examining their contents.(867)  When he finished the review, Mr. Barnett asked Ms. Williams for tape and sealed the box.(868)
<P>Mr. Barnett then called Ingram P. Barlow, the comptroller of Williams & Connolly, to come over and pick up the box from the White House.(869)  Mr. Barnett gave Ms. Williams Mr. Barlow's name and social security number for her to clear him in with the Secret Service, and left at 4:30 p.m.(870)  Mr. Barnett denied seeing Mrs. Clinton while he was in the White House Residence.(871)
<P>Mr. Barlow of Williams & Connolly arrived at the White House Residence at 4:38 p.m.(872)  He was escorted to the third floor closet, where he took possession of the box.  Consistent with Mr. Barnett's testimony, the box was sealed in packing tape when Mr. Barlow saw it in the closet.(873)
<P>Mr. Barnett called Susan Thomases at her office on July 26, 1993 and left a message.(874)  Ms. Thomases did not recall returning Mr. Barnett's call, nor did she recall making plans to go to the White House on July 27.(875)  Secret Service records, however, indicate that Susan Thomases entered the White House at 2:50 p.m. on July 27.(876)  Because Ms. Thomases had a White House pass at that time, the Secret Service entry records did not list the purpose of her visit or her intended destination.  Records maintained at the White House Residence, however, indicated that she entered the Residence at 3:08 p.m., five minutes after Mr. Barnett.  Records maintained by the White House Residence Usher's Office further indicate that Mr. Barnett and Ms. Thomases exited the White House Residence together.(877)  Mr. Barnett testified, however, that he did not recall seeing Ms. Thomases in the White House Residence.  
<P>Although Mr. Barnett testified that he did not recall seeing Mrs. Clinton during his visit on July 27, Ms. Williams testified that she recalled seeing Mr. Barnett talking with Mrs. Clinton when she ran into him in the Residence that afternoon.  
<P>Telephone records produced by Ms. Thomases indicate that she called Patricia Solis Doyle, Mrs. Clinton's scheduler, on the evening of July 26, 1993.(878)  Ms. Thomases does not recall why she spoke with Ms. Solis, and does not recall whether she called Ms. Solis to schedule an appointment to see Mrs. Clinton.(879)
<P>On the morning of July 27, Ms. Solis called Ms. Thomases in her New York office and left a message.  The message read, "HRC wants to see you today."(880)  The message contained a check mark, which, according to Ms. Thomases, signified that she had returned the call.  Indeed, telephone records indicate that, at 11:33 a.m. on July 27, Ms. Thomases called Ms. Solis from her Washington office and spoke for 10 minutes.(881)  Her telephone records further indicate that, in the 40 minutes between 12:20 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. on July 27, Ms. Thomases called the White House four times.  Later that afternoon, at 1:30 p.m., Ms. Thomases received another message from Evelyn Lieberman in the First Lady's office.  It stated, "Please call Hillary."(882)
<P>Ms. Thomases testified that as of the end of the day on July 26, she did not have any firm plan or compelling reason to come to Washington the next day, July 27.(883)  Her normal day to be in Washington was Wednesday.  According to Ms. Solis, it was not customary for Mrs. Clinton to summon Ms. Thomases to Washington on a particular day.  "That's not normally the way it works.  If Mrs. Clinton wanted to see Susan, she'd ask is she in town, do you know what her schedule is, can she come by."(884)  
<P>Interestingly, Ms. Thomases professed that she could not explain why she went to Washington on July 27.  Ms. Thomases did not recall scheduling a meeting with or seeing the Mrs. Clinton on July 27.(885)  Indeed, Ms. Thomases testified that she did not even have a specific recollection of even being in the White House Residence that day.  Secret Service records and the White House Residence Usher's logs indicate, however, that Ms. Thomases arrived at the White House at 2:50 p.m. on July 27, and went up to the second floor of the White House Residence at 3:08 p.m.(886)  In addition, records indicate that Ms. Thomases made two telephone calls from the White House Residence on July 27, 1993, and charged them to her telephone calling card.(887)
B.<P>White House Deliberations About the Handling of the Note.
<P>In the morning of July 27th, after the regular White House staff meeting, Mr. Nussbaum met with Mr. McLarty, Mr. Burton, and Mr. Gergen to discuss how Mr. Foster's note should be handled.(888)  Mr. McLarty thought "the note would need to be provided to the authorities, and it eventually would become public knowledge; either we would disclose it or it would become public knowledge."  However, there were "issues outstanding" that he wanted to discuss with the other White House officials.(889)  According to Mr. Gergen:, the meeting was resolved in favor of disclosing the note to the authorities as soon as possible.  "[T]here was a unanimous agreement that the issues that had been raised the night before had been resolved in the minds of those who had raised them, and it was a unanimous agreement to go forward."(890)  Mr. McLarty confirmed that at the meeting the "concerns over executive privilege had been settled."(891)
<P>Jim Hamilton, an attorney representing the Foster family, joined the meeting halfway through, at about 11:00 a.m.  He introduced a concern that was new to Mr. Gergen:
<P>He took the position -- I do not know whether, I do not know whether he knew about the existence of the note prior to coming in the room, or whether he was told, but he was very strongly of the view that before anything was done with the note, Mrs. Foster needed to be informed of the contents and needed to be informed that there was a note, and he needed to sit down with her and talk about it.(892)
Mr. Hamilton told those at the meeting that Mrs. Foster was flying from Arkansas, and would arrive early in the afternoon, at about 2:30 p.m.(893)  Mr. Hamilton said that he agreed that the note should be turned over to the authorities, but he did not know what Mrs. Foster's reaction would be to the note.(894)  After consulting with Mrs. Foster, Mr. Hamilton returned to the White House and said that Mrs. Foster assented to turning the note over to the authorities.(895)
<P>White House officials also discussed how to disclose the note to the authorities.  "I think there'd been some discussion in our staff meetings about whether it ought to go to the Justice Department or the Park Police," Mr. Gergen said.  "There was some uncertainty on the part of the White House about what the appropriate channel was to make sure it got there."(896)  The officials discussed whether the Park Police could be trusted not to leak the existence or contents of the note to the press.(897)  They also feared that disclosure of Mr. Foster's note might prompt the authorities to reopen investigations into the matters spelled out in the note.  "I recall there was some speculation about whether the contents of the note might prompt legal authorities to look further in to the issues raised by the note.  In other words, to go beyond the scope of the immediate investigation over his mental state."(898)
<P>The controversy over the White House Travel Office was specifically mentioned.(899)  According to Mr. Gergen:
<P>I believe with regard to the Travelgate matter [he] said the FBI lied.  He accused the FBI of lying, I believe -- I can't -- I don't remember the exact details of this, but there was a discussion within the White House of whether upon receipt of that or once the note was turned over to the authorities -- this was discussions I recall we had on Tuesday, on the day when the note was turned over -- whether that would prompt or the Attorney General would feel forced, having received that, to launch an investigation about what he was talking about.  You know, did the FBI lie?  That was the point that I was trying to make in the deposition.  Inevitably, there were points raised in the note that were clearly going to prompt a lot of attention by the press and by others, and that particular point was on the one about the FBI lying.(900)26 
<P>The documents produced by the White House to the Special Committee included two pages of undated, handwritten notes by Bill Burton.  At the top the first page, Mr. Burton listed the names of the persons present at the meeting on July 27:  Jim Hamilton, Bernard Nussbaum, Bill Burton, David Gergen, Mack McLarty.(901)  Further down in his notes, Mr. Burton wrote "2 pts" with an arrow pointing to the following:
<P><P>far happier if disc.
<P><P>if someone other than Bernie

<P><P>if worried about usher's office
<P><P>    discuss with me.(902)
On the second page, Mr. Burton wrote the following:  "We have disc a personal writing of Mr. Foster reflecting his depressed state.  In deference to the family, no further commt."(903)  Mr. Burton testified that "disc." on the first page meant "discussed" or "disclosed", and the same notation of the second page was shorthand for "discovered".  Senator Grams noted the inconsistency in Mr. Burton's answer and pointed out further that, on the first page, when Mr. Burton meant "discussed" in the last line of the notes, he wrote out the entire word.  Mr. Burton explained that he used a variety of abbreviations.  "I use some standard Associated Press abbreviations; I use some of my own shorthand. Sometimes d-i-s-c means discussed.  Sometimes it means discovered.  Sometimes it means disclosed."(904)
C.<P>The President Is Told of the Note.
<P>Mr. McLarty called Mrs. Foster's house after the morning meeting and then learned that Mrs. Foster was traveling back from Arkansas to Washington.(905)  She arrived in Washington in the afternoon, at about 2:30 p.m.  She was then taken to the White House to view the note and agreed to disclose the note to the authorities.(906)
<P> Even though it had been agreed at the morning meeting that the President would be notified as soon as possible so that the note could be turned over to the authorities, Mr. McLarty claims that he did not notify the President until late in the afternoon because the President had a full schedule and because Mrs. Foster had not been notified.(907)  At 6:00 p.m.,(908) Mr. McLarty, Mr. Gergen, and Mr. Nussbaum went into the Oval Office to tell the President about the note.  According to Mr. McLarty, Mr. Nussbaum explained to the President the existence of the note and either "read him the note or outlined what was in the contents."  The three men explained to the President that Mrs. Foster had already been notified, or would be shortly, and that they intended to turn the note over to the authorities.  Mr. McLarty testified that the President accepted their report, and "he said do with it as you think is right, give it to the authorities; and that was about it."(909)
<P>Mr. Gergen testified that the President did not indicate that he knew about the note before the 6:00 p.m. meeting, although Mr. Gergen "couldn't tell from his reaction whether he knew."(910)  By then, Mrs. Clinton had known of the note for over 24 hours.  Senator Grams observed that "[i]t seems kind of strange knowing that this was one of his best friends and all of the speculation surrounding looking for a suicide note that night, and then finally when something was found, he didn't -- wasn't inquisitive; he didn't inquire about it; he didn't seem to want to know more information except for to say you handle it the best way you know how." (911)
D.<P>The White House Finally Turns the Note Over to Law Enforcement.
<P>Some time in the afternoon, Mr. McLarty called Attorney General Janet Reno and asked her to come to the White House that evening, at about 7:00 p.m.(912) Deputy Attorney General Heymann recalled accompanying Attorney General Reno to the White House: 
<P>I rode over with the Attorney General on the evening of Tuesday the 27th.  We had a 7:00 meeting. We had not been told what it was about, though.  I thought it was probably about the Foster matter.  We were shown into Mr. McLarty's office.  The only -- I think at first only Mr. Gergen, David Gergen was there.  Then Mr. Nussbaum came in and Mr. Burton, I believe, and certainly Mr. McLarty.  There had been some small talk before that.(913)
<P>Mr. Nussbaum began the meeting by informing Attorney General Reno and Mr. Heymann of the existence of the note, producing the note, and reading them a transcript of the note.  Mr. Nussbaum then asked the Justice Department Officials what "should be done with it."  Attorney General Reno told Mr. Nussbaum to "turn it over to the Park Police immediately."(914)
<P>Attorney General Reno questioned Mr. Nussbaum about the long delay in disclosing the note to the proper authorities:
<P>She then asked why are we just getting it now if it was found I guess it's 30 hours -- it was 30 hours before then.  The White House people, I don't know whether it was Mr. Nussbaum or who, said that there was -- they wanted first to show it to Mrs. Foster and they wanted to show it to the President who might, if he had wanted to, have asserted executive privilege, they said.  They said they were not able to get to the President until late on the 27th and as soon as they got to the President and made the President aware of the note, they had called us.(915)
Attorney General Reno, who had to leave, asked Mr. Heymann to stay and take care of the matter.  Mr. Heymann then called Mr. Margolis and asked him to call the Park Police immediately.(916)
<P>Apparently unbeknownst to Attorney General Reno and Deputy Attorney General Heymann, Webster Hubbell, the Associate Attorney General, was in the White House Residence while Ms. Reno and Mr. Heymann were in the White House to receive the note.  Mr. Hubbell's records indicate that Mrs. Clinton had called his office and left a message at 2:30 p.m. that afternoon.(917)  White House logs indicate that Mr. Hubbell arrived at the Residence at 6:29 p.m. and remained there until 8:19 p.m.(918)  Ms. Thomases, who was in the Residence at the same time as Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Hubbell, exited the White House at approximately the same time.(919)  Neither Ms. Thomases nor Mr. Hubbell recalled discussing the note with each other or with Mrs. Clinton on that day.  Ms. Thomases testified, "I don't know that Hillary Clinton and I have ever discussed that writing."(920)
<P>Ms. Thomases acknowledged that she met with Mr. Hubbell and Mrs. Clinton in the Residence following Mr. Foster's death, but she did not recall whether the gathering occurred on July 27:(921)27   She claimed that the three shared only memories of Mr. Foster:
<P>We just talked about the tragedy of Vince's death and we talked about how sad it was, and I remember that the first time the three of us were together, we talked a little bit about some of the good times that we had had together and old times before Bill Clinton was elected President, and in the days in which I used to see them.(922) 

<P>Mr. Hubbell testified that he learned about the note when he "read it in the newspaper."(923)  When asked about his trip to the White House on July 27, Mr. Hubbell testified that he went to the White House to give Mrs. Clinton an account of Mr. Foster's funeral after Mrs. Clinton left.  "I remember that I had to go to the White House to tell Hillary about what had gone on after they left the funeral, but I don't have any memory of doing it."(924)  He testified that it was part of the grieving process:  "We, as Southerners, we have large long funerals and we get together and drink and eat and talk and do it for days.  And Hillary had missed that grieving process, and I remember my wife saying, Hillary needs to talk to you.  She needs to understand who was there and things of that sort."(925)  Implausibly, he did not recall seeing Ms. Thomases or discuss the Mr. Foster's note with Mrs. Clinton.(926)  
<P>After Mr. Heymann called the Park Police, Officer Joseph Megby of the Park Police went to the White House.  Mr. Nussbaum began to assemble the note.(927)  Some of the pieces fell, and Mr. Nussbaum and others picked them up.   Mr. Heymann testified that "the note fell down, a number of the pieces of the note fell down on the floor and there was a scramble to pick them up."(928)  He noted at the time that "by the time it had been reassembled, the fingerprints of everybody in the White House were on it.  So if anybody wanted fingerprints, they had all the fingerprints in the world."(929)28 
<P>Mr. Nussbaum then gave the note to Officer Megby and concluded the meeting.  Heymann urged Officer Megby to ask any questions that he might have, but the officer declined.  It was not until later that Mr. Heymann learned that Officer Megby "was simply a duty officer.  This was probably all new to him."(930)
<P>The circumstances surrounding the discovery of the note and the delay in turning it over to the authorities disturbed Mr. Heymann and caused him to question the level of cooperation that the White House provided to the investigation into Mr. Foster's death.  The next day, July 28, 1993, Mr. Heymann met with Mr. Margolis  and instructed him to ask the FBI to conduct a thorough investigation into the discovery of the note.  Mr. Heymann specifically told them to be "very aggressive,"(931) and Mr. Margolis described the investigation as an "800-pound gorilla."(932)  Mr. Heymann and Mr. Margolis identified the jurisdictional predicate for the investigation as obstruction of justice,(933) and FBI documents confirmed that the subject matter was "possible obstruction of justice of U.S. Park Police investigation of death of Vincent Foster, Counsel to the President."(934)
<P>This sentiment was shared by the Park Police, who complained about the lack of White House cooperation to number two official of the Interior Department.  Mr. Heymann testified that, on July 29, 1993, he received a call from Thomas Collier, the Chief of Staff to the Secretary of Interior, asking for help.  Mr. Collier told Mr. Heymann that "the Park Police are very, very upset about the investigation....  He said that they really couldn't get the cooperation that they wanted, and he said that he wanted to pull the Park Police out and he'd like me to substitute the FBI for the Park Police.".(935)  Mr. Heymann did not want to pull the Park Police from the investigation, but told Mr. Collier that the FBI, at Mr. Heymann's request, were already involved in the White House investigation.  Mr. Heymann also assured Mr. Collier that he would intervene with the White House to ensure future cooperation.
<P>Mr. Heymann then called David Gergen at the White House and explained the problems that the Park Police investigators were encountering.  Mr. Gergen told Mr. Heymann that he would call back in a few minutes so that Mr. Gergen could assemble a number of White House personnel in his office.(936)  When Mr. Gergen called back, he was on a speakerphone with a number of White House officials, "eight or nine or ten people".(937)  Mr. Gergen does not have a clear memory of the conversation, but he testified that Mr. Heymann "may have conveyed to me a sense of, not a precise x, y, z, here's what you guys are doing, but a sense of watch it, you know, an alert.  Make sure the White House was doing this, to remind me in effect, these are very highly charged kinds of investigations and they can be misunderstood very easily."(938)
<P>Mr. Heymann's recollection is clearer:
<P><P>I read them the riot act in unmistakable terms, telling them that this was a disaster very near to occur, that I was sending, I had sent the FBI in to interview on the note.  That I wanted all interviews to take place without White House counsel there.   That I wanted full cooperation.  That there was a very good chance that nothing could avoid sort of a major failure of credibility and sense of biased investigation, but that only the most vigorous of steps, at this point, could do that, and I wanted a complete turnaround.(939)

According to Mr. Heymann, he deliberately delivered a "very strong message" seeking to change the White House attitude toward the investigation.(940)  He received some, but not much, argument from the White House officials involved in the conference call.  After the conversation, according to Mr. Heymann, "the cooperation with the Park Police and with the FBI turned around immediately and completely."(941)

     <H2>FINDINGS OF THE SPECIAL COMMITTEE</H2>
<P>In the course of its investigation, the Special Committee was confronted with witnesses who provided conflicting testimony about events highly relevant to the Special Committee's inquiry.  To resolve these conflicts in testimony, Senate Resolution 120 authorized the Special Committee to make factual findings based on the available evidence.  In doing so, the Special Committee placed primary emphasis on documentary or other physical evidence whenever such evidence was available and when there was no indication that such evidence had been altered or otherwise compromised.  When judgments of credibility had to be made, the Special Committee focused on the factors that, from common sense and logic, contribute to the reliability of a person's testimony--factors such as a motive to lie or embellish, the detail and vividness of memory, and the internal and external consistency of a person's overall testimony.  The Special Committee summarizes its factual findings below.
<P>Finding 1.<P>At the time of his death, Vincent Foster was intimately involved in two brewing scandals--Travelgate and Whitewater--touching on President and Mrs. Clinton.
<P>Mr. Foster played a central role in both the firing of the Travel Office staff and subsequent attempts to conceal Mrs. Clinton's true role in the firings.  Mr. Foster participated in the May 12, 1993 meeting with Harry Thomasson, Catherine Cornelius, and David Watkins where the replacement of the Travel Office staff was first discussed.(942)  Mr. Foster then assigned his former law partner, William Kennedy, to investigate alleged financial mismanagement in the Travel Office.  When the July 2, 1993 report of an internal White House review into the matter sharply reprimanded Mr. Kennedy,  Mr. Foster felt personally responsible and insisted that Mr. Nussbaum allow him to shoulder the blame.(943)
<P>Mr. Watkins' belatedly disclosed memorandum concerning the Travel Office affair clearly outlined Mr. Foster's extensive involvement as Mrs. Clinton's conduit to the firings.  Mr. Kennedy wrote, for example, "Once this made it on the First Lady's agenda, Vince Foster became involved, and he and Harry Thomason regularly informed me of her attention to the Travel Office situation -- as well as her insistence that the situation be resolved immediately by replacing the Travel Office staff."(944)  Indeed, Mr. Watkins fingered Mr. Foster as the person who directly communicated to him Mrs. Clinton's order that the Travel Office staff be fired.  "Foster regularly informed me that the First Lady was concerned and desired action -- the action desired was the firing of the Travel Office staff."(945)  Despite Mrs. Clinton's obvious and extensive involvement in the firing of the staff, Mr. Foster and other White House officials did not disclose to investigators probing the affair about her true role.  
<P>It is also undisputed that Mr. Foster played a central role in the effort to respond to and manage the brewing Whitewater scandal.  When questions first arose in the 1992 campaign about Whitewater and Mrs. Clinton's representation of Mr. McDougal's Madison Guaranty, Mr. Foster compiled the files and billing records of the Rose Law Firm relating to that representation.(946)  He and Mr. Hubbell improperly removed the files from the Rose Law Firm without authorization and transported them to Washington after the campaign.  In order to "[g]et out of White Water,"(947) Mr. Foster also perfected the sale of the Clintons' interest in Whitewater to Mr. McDougal.(948)  
<P>After becoming Deputy White House Counsel, Mr. Foster continued his role as the Clintons' personal counsel on Whitewater.  He was assigned the task of preparing the Clintons' tax returns for 1992 in order to reflect properly the sale of their shares in Whitewater,(949) a problem that his notes described as a "can of worms you shouldn't open."(950)  Mr. Foster worked with other White House officials in the Spring of 1993 in coordinating a response to questions about Whitewater.(951)  And Mr. Foster's telephone log indicated an inexplicable message from Mr. McDougal on June 16, 1993, "re tax returns of HRC, VWF and McDougal."(952)  
<P>Finding 2.<P>Senior White House officials were aware that the President and Mrs. Clinton faced potential liability over Whitewater and their relationship with the McDougals.
<P>Before the Special Committee, Mr. Nussbaum boldly announced:  "The Whitewater matter, which subsequently became the focus of so much attention, was not on our minds or even in our consciousness in July 1993."(953)  The testimonial and evidentiary record belies Mr. Nussbaum's exculpatory declaration.
<P>Questions about Whitewater and Mrs. Clinton's representation of Madison were a major campaign issue in 1992, so much so that the Clintons took the extraordinary step of retaining Jame Lyons, an "outside attorney," to issue a report on the matter.  Mr. Foster and Mr. Hubbell at that time compiled the files and billing records of the Rose Law Firm relating to Mrs. Clinton's representation of Madison,(954) and transported the files to Washington after the campaign.  And Mr. Foster was specifically tasked to prepare the Clintons' personal tax returns as they relate to Whitewater,(955) a project which consumed his time in the White House.
<P>More important, as early as 1992, the Clintons and their advisors were aware that questions about Whitewater would again resurface, this time in a criminal investigation.  In the fall of 1992, Betsey Wright heard of a "criminal referral regarding a savings and loan official in Arkansas and . . . involv[ing] the Clintons."(956)  Ms. Wright learned specifically that the RTC had just sent a "criminal referral up to the prosecutor in Little Rock."(957)  She passed this news onto Mrs. Clinton.(958)  
<P>According to RTC Senior Vice President William H. Roelle, former Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Roger Altman, upon taking office, directed the staff to inform him of all important or potentially high-visibility issues.(959)  Mr. Roelle testified that, on or about March 23, 1993, he told Mr. Altman that the RTC had sent a criminal referral mentioning the Clintons to the Justice Department.(960)  Mr. Altman immediately sent Mr. Nussbaum two facsimiles about Whitewater.  The first facsimile, sent on March 23, 1993 with a handwritten cover sheet, forwarded an "RTC Clip Sheet" of a March 9, 1992 New York Times article with the headline, "Clinton Defends Real-Estate Deal."(961)  The article reported the responses that Bill Clinton, then a presidential candidate, offered to an earlier Times report detailing the Clintons' investment in Whitewater and their ties to Jim and Susan McDougal.  The second facsimile from Mr. Altman to Mr. Nussbaum, sent the next day, March 24, 1993, forwarded the same article that was sent the day before and portions of the earlier Times report--an article dated March 8, 1992, by Jeff Gerth entitled "Clintons Joined S&L Operator in an Ozark Real-Estate Venture," which originally broke the story in the news media.(962)
<P>In addition, SBA Associate Administrator Wayne Foren testified that, in early May 1993, he briefed Erskine Bowles, the new SBA Administrator about the agency's ongoing investigation of David Hale's Capital Management Services because the case involved President Clinton.(963)  Shortly thereafter, Mr. Bowles told Mr. Foren that he had briefed White House Chief of Staff Mack McLarty about the case.(964)  Although Mr. Bowles did not recall being briefed by Mr. Foren about Capital Management(965) or talking to Mr. McLarty about the case,(966) Mr. Foren's account was corroborated by his deputy, Charles Shepperson.(967)  Mr. McLarty's calendar indicated that Mr. Bowles had two meetings with Mr. McLarty at the White House in early May 1993.(968)
<P>Mr. Foster's role in response to Whitewater was known in the White House.  Ricki Seidman, former Deputy Director of Communications in the White House, reported to the FBI that she and Mr. Foster had worked together on Whitewater issues before his death.  Specifically, she recalled that she worked with Mr. Foster in April 1993 in connection with the Clintons' tax returns.(969)  Seidman participated in the discussions from a "communications perspective,"(970) thus indicating the White House's identification of Whitewater as a potential issue in the spring of 1993.  Indeed, according to the FBI report of Ms. Seidman's interview, "it was believed the tax returns would bring the Whitewater issue into the `public domain again.'"(971)  And Ms. Seidman stated that there was discussion in the White House regarding "the `soundest way' to seek closure to the issue."(972)
<P>Given this overwhelming evidence, the Special Committee finds that White House officials knew about Mr. Foster's work for the Clintons on Whitewater, and that, at the time of his death, the Clinton White House was acutely aware that Whitewater was a potential political and criminal matter.
<P>Finding 3.<P>Senior White House officials ignored repeated requests by law enforcement officials to seal Mr. Foster's office on the night of his death.
<P>Nine different persons recalled four separate requests to White House officials to seal Vincent Foster's office on the evening of July 20.  Park Police investigator Sergeant Cheryl Braun testified that, as she left the Foster residence, she asked Assistant to the President David Watkins to seal Mr. Foster's office.(973)  Detective John Rolla expressly corroborated her testimony.(974)  Park Police Major Robert Hines testified that he called and asked another senior White House official, Bill Burton, to seal Mr. Foster's office.(975)  Another White House official, Sylvia Mathews, testified that she overheard Mr. Burton's conversation with the Park Police(976) and that right after the telephone call, Mr. Burton asked Counsel to the President Bernard Nussbaum to seal the office.(977)
<P>Counselor to the President David Gergen testified that he asked Director of Communications Mark Gearan whether Mr. Foster's office was sealed.(978)  Mr. Gearan then asked Mr. Burton, who assured Mr. Gearan that the office had been sealed.(979)  Associate Attorney General Webster Hubbell testified that both his wife and Marsha Scott remembered him calling Chief of Staff Mack McLarty on the night of Mr. Foster's death to ask that Mr. Foster's office be sealed.(980)  All the persons who received these requests to seal Mr. Foster's office denied having been asked to do so.
<P>Mr. Watkins was the critical person in the failure to seal Mr. Foster's office on the night of his death.  He received a specific request from the Park Police to seal Mr. Foster's office.  Instead of doing so, he directed his assistant, Patsy Thomasson, to search the office.  Mr. Watkins was intimately involved, along with Mr. Foster, in firing the career Travel Office staff and in the apparent subsequent cover up before investigators.  In a memorandum drafted in the Fall of 1993, Mr. Watkins described in detail Mr. Foster's and Mrs. Clinton's role in the Travelgate affair.  He wrote that "Foster regularly informed me that the First Lady was concerned and desired action -- the action desired was the firing of the Travel Office staff."(981)  The memorandum also revealed that, right before the firing of the Travel Office staff, White House Chief of Staff Mack McLarty met with Mr. Watkins and Ms. Thomasson and explained that the issue was on Mrs. Clinton's "radar screen" and that "immediate action must be taken."(982)  At all times, however, the White House had maintained that Mrs. Clinton was not involved in the Travel Office matter; Mrs. Clinton and numerous other White House officials had made public statements that she had "no role" in the firing of the staff.  Mr. Watkins' knowledge of Mrs. Clinton's true involvement in Travelgate, efforts by White House officials to conceal that involvement, and Mr. Foster's direct role in both the firing and the cover-up provides an obvious and powerful motive to violate the instructions of the Park Police to seal Mr. Foster's office.  Instead, Mr. Watkins directed his trusted assistant, Patsy Thomasson, to search Mr. Foster's office.
<P>The Special Committee finds that the overwhelming weight of the evidence established that senior White House officials received multiple requests to seal Mr. Foster's office on the night of his death.  The testimony of Sylvia Mathews, a White House official with absolutely no motivation to mislead the Special Committee, was corroborated by notes that she prepared within one week of Mr. Foster's death.(983)  And Bill Burton's undated notes listed Webster Hubbell's name and telephone numbers next to the reminder "1) Secure Office".(984)  This testimonial and documentary evidence is uncontradicted; the White House officials have testified simply that they did not recall the requests to seal Mr. Foster's office.
<P>It is undisputed that, contrary to the requests of law enforcement, Mr. Foster's office was not sealed the night of his death.
<P>Finding 4.<P>White House officials conducted an improper search of Mr. Foster's office on the night of his death.
<P>The Special Committee received testimony that David Watkins and Bernard Nussbaum both received requests to seal Mr. Foster's office.  Instead of taking steps to seal Mr. Foster's office, however, Mr. Watkins paged Patsy Thomasson and instructed her to go to into Mr. Foster's office to search for a note.(985)  Ms. Thomasson was aware of Mr. Foster's role in the Travel Office matter.(986)  Mr. Nussbaum then joined Ms. Thomasson in that search.(987)  It is unclear what motivated, or whether anyone instructed, Margaret Williams to go into Mr. Foster's office, but the Special Committee finds improbable Ms. Williams' testimony that she went to Mr. Foster's office in the hope that "I would walk in and I would find Vince Foster there and we would have a chat sitting on his couch, as we have done so many times before."(988)

Ms. Williams testified that she did not even mention to Mrs. Clinton the search of Mr. Foster's office in her telephone call at 12:56 a.m. on July 21 -- for example, that no note was found possibly explaining Mr. Foster's decision to take his own life.(989)  They had already spoken earlier in the night about the fact of Mr. Foster's death.
<P>Ms. Williams did not recall talking to Ms. Thomases on the evening of Mr. Foster's death.(990)  Of her conversation with Ms. Williams that night, Ms. Thomases testified: "I don't recollect speaking with her that night.  That's not to say that she didn't call me back and I didn't speak to her, but I have no independent recollection of having spoken with her that night."(991)
<P>In the end, the documentary evidence showing the sequence of phone calls in the early hours of July 21, after Ms. Williams had entered Mr. Foster's office, reasonably leads to the conclusion that Ms. Williams called Ms. Thomases and Mrs. Clinton to report the results of the search of Mr. Foster's office.
<P>Finding 5.<P>Margaret Williams may have removed files from the White House Counsel suite on the night of his death.
<P>Secret Service Officer Henry O'Neill testified that, on the night of Mr. Foster's death, he specifically saw Margaret Williams remove file folders, three to five inches thick, from the White House Counsel suite and placed them in her office.(992)  As Ms. Williams walked past Officer O'Neill to her office, her assistant, Evelyn Lieberman, said to Officer O'Neill: "'that's Maggie Williams; she's the First Lady's chief of staff.'"(993)  Ms. Williams denied removing any files and her attorney submitted the results of polygraph tests indicating that she was truthful in her denial.(994)
<P>The Special Committee finds the testimony of Officer O'Neill to be credible.  Officer O'Neill, a career officer with the Secret Service Uniformed Division, has no motive to lie.  He has a clear recollection of the critical events on the evening of Mr. Foster's death, and he is certain that he saw Ms. Williams remove the documents.  He was situated in an excellent position in the narrow hall between the White House Counsel suite and Ms. Williams' office, and his memory is punctuated by Evelyn Lieberman's introduction of Ms. Williams.
<P>Although the results of Ms. Williams' polygraph examinations should be given some weight, there are reasons to question the probative value of those examinations.  First, polygraph tests are generally unreliable--a recognition that in part led to the adoption of the Polygraph Protection Act of 1987.29   Second, Ms. Williams was given three and probably four examinations by her private polygrapher before submitting to a test by the Independent Counsel.(995)  A person may increase her chances of being found "truthful" by taking multiple polygraph examinations.  Subjects are approximately 25 percent more likely to pass polygraph examinations with two practice exams, according to one study.30   
<P>Finding 6.<P>Bernard Nussbaum agreed with Justice Department officials on July 21, 1993, to allow law enforcement officials to review documents in Mr. Foster's office.
<P>Philip Heymann testified that he and Mr. Nussbaum agreed on July 21, 1993, as to the procedures for reviewing the documents in Mr. Foster's office.(996)  David Margolis and Roger Adams, whom Mr. Heymann sent to the White House to conduct the review as agreed, corroborated Mr. Heymann's recollection.(997)  Mr. Nussbaum does not recall discussing procedures for reviewing Mr. Foster's office with Mr. Heymann on July 21.  Mr. Margolis and Mr. Adams testified that, in Mr. Nussbaum's office that evening, they finalized the agreement between Mr. Heymann and Mr. Nussbaum.(998)  Mr. Nussbaum and his associates in the White House counsel's office denied reaching any agreement.(999)
<P>The Special Committee finds that the evidence overwhelmingly demonstrates that Mr. Nussbaum agreed with the Justice Department on July 21 with respect to the procedures for reviewing the documents in Mr. Foster's office.  Mr. Heymann's specific and detailed recollection of his afternoon conversation with Mr. Nussbaum stands in stark contrast to Mr. Nussbaum's very hazy recollection that Mr. Heymann may "get other people involved" in the investigation.  Mr. Margolis and Mr. Adams finalized Mr. Heymann's agreement when they met with Mr. Nussbaum, Mr. Sloan and Mr. Neuwirth later in the afternoon.(1000)  The testimony of Mr. Margolis and Mr. Adams is corroborated by notes made by Mr. Adams within one week of the meeting and by Cynthia Monaco's dictated diaries(1001) and a contemporaneous FBI teletype describing the meeting.(1002)
<P>There is independent evidence confirming that Mr. Nussbaum agreed with the Justice Department on the procedures for reviewing documents in Mr. Foster's office.  Mr. Margolis and Mr. Adams testified that, during the later afternoon meeting, Mr. Nussbaum overruled and corrected Mr. Neuwirth when Mr. Neuwirth stated that Mr. Nussbaum alone would review the documents in Mr. Foster's office.(1003)  The Special Committee finds simply not credible the testimony of Mr. Nussbaum, Mr. Neuwirth, and Mr. Sloan that they do not recall any such incident, given their vivid and specific denial of any such agreement with the Justice Department.  
<P>Finding 7.<P>Margaret Williams and Susan Thomases, in consultation with Mrs. Clinton, took part in formulating the procedure for reviewing documents in Mr. Foster's office on July 22, 1993.
<P>Mr. Nussbaum agreed with Justice Department officials on July 21, 1993, to an "entirely sensible plan"(1004) to review jointly documents in Mr. Foster's office.  The next day, however, he broke the agreement, reviewed the documents himself, and permitted Margaret Williams, Mrs. Clinton's Chief of Staff, to participate in a second review and to remove documents from Mr. Foster's office.  Given this sequence of events, which fundamentally changed the manner in which documents in Mr. Foster's office were handled, the obvious question that the Special Committee faced was, why?
<P>Records obtained by the Special Committee(1005) showed the following sequence of telephone calls in the early hours of July 22:

<P>Mr. Nussbaum testified that, when he answered Ms. Thomases' page, Ms. Thomases asked him about the upcoming review of Mr. Foster's office and said that unspecified "people are concerned" about Mr. Nussbaum's plan to allow law enforcement officials to participate in the review.(1006)
<P>Later in the day, according to Associate Counsel to the President Stephen Neuwirth, Mr. Nussbaum told Mr. Neuwirth that Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Thomases were concerned about the law enforcement authorities having "unfettered access" to Mr. Foster's office.(1007)
<P>Ms. Thomases acknowledged that she talked with Mr. Nussbaum about the review, but only at his instigation, and she denied expressing any concern or reservation about the review procedures.(1008)  She testified that she had no conversations with Mrs. Clinton about the review of documents in Mr. Foster's office.(1009)
<P>Ms. Williams did not recall having any conversations about the document review.
<P>The Special Committee finds that there is substantial, indeed compelling, evidence indicating that Ms. Williams and Ms. Thomases, in consultation with Mrs. Clinton, participated in formulating the procedure for reviewing documents in Mr. Foster's office on July 22, 1993.  Although Ms. Williams and Ms. Thomases both denied speaking with Mrs. Clinton about the review of documents, the sequence of contiguous telephone calls from Ms. Williams to Mrs. Clinton, from Mrs. Clinton to Ms. Thomases, and from Ms. Thomases to Mr. Nussbaum leads to the unmistakable conclusion that these early morning phone calls precipitated Mr. Nussbaum's change of procedure.
<P>The testimony of White House lawyers directly support this <P>Finding.  According to Mr. Neuwirth's important testimony, Mr. Nussbaum understood, from a prior conversation with Ms. Thomases, that Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Thomases were concerned about the prospect of unfettered access to Mr. Foster's papers.  Although Ms. Thomases denied that she intervened in the formulation of the search procedure, Mr. Nussbaum testified that Ms. Thomases attempted to impose her views on how to conduct the review, an attempt that he claimed to have rebuffed.
<P>By breaking his agreement with law enforcement over the terms of the search of Mr. Foster's office, Mr. Nussbaum demonstrated that he clearly took the concerns of Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Thomases into account.  Mrs. Clinton, however, persists in her story that she had no involvement in the handling of documents in Mr. Foster's office.  In public statements, she maintained that "[t]here were no documents taken out of Vince Foster's office on the night he died.  And I did not direct anyone to interfere in any investigation."(1010)  Although this statement may be technically correct, that Mrs. Clinton did not "direct" anyone to "interfere" with investigations, the evidence established that she communicated concerns about the handling of documents in Mr. Foster's office.  Those concerns were passed on, in Mrs. Clinton's name and by someone known to have her authority, to White House officials.(1011)  Here, as in Travelgate, that is enough.  The invocation of Mrs. Clinton's interest in the matter commands a "clear" message: "immediate action must be taken."(1012)  And the action taken, denying investigators access to documents in Mr. Foster's office, had the effect of interfering with the investigation.  The Special Committee and the American people deserves candor, not lawyerly word games.
<P>The documentary evidence establishes that Ms. Thomases and Ms. Williams remained directly involved in the process of reviewing the documents.  Tellingly, throughout July 22, Ms. Thomases made repeated phone calls to the offices of Mack McLarty and Ms. Williams.31   Records produced to the Special Committee showed the following calls by Ms. Thomases to the White House on July 22, 1993:

Ms. Thomases thus remained in close touch with the White House while Mr. Nussbaum finalized the search procedures and announced to the law enforcement officials, at about 1:00 p.m., the decision that he alone would review the documents in the Mr. Foster's office.
<P>Contrary to certain public statements by the White House, Ms. Williams clearly was involved in the actual review and removal of documents from Mr. Foster's office on July 22.32   After Mr. Nussbaum reviewed the documents in Mr. Foster's office in front of law enforcement, he and Margaret Williams conducted a second review -- the real review.  Ms. Williams then removed the Clintons' personal documents from Mr. Foster's office and transferred them to the residence, telling Thomas Castleton that "the President or the First Lady had to review the contents of the boxes to determine what was in them."(1013)  Ms. Williams called Mrs. Clinton before putting the files in the residence, and, at 5:13 p.m., apparently after Ms. Williams had completed the transfer of files, Ms. Thomases called Ms. Williams' office and talked for nine minutes.  At 7:12 p.m., Ms. Thomases put in a final call, one-minute call to Mrs. Clinton at the Rodham residence.(1014)
<P>The sequence of documented telephone calls and their correlation to activities surrounding the review and removal of documents from Mr. Foster's office on July 22 leads to the inescapable conclusion that Ms. Thomases and Ms. Williams, in consultation with, or acting at the direction of, Mrs. Clinton, prevailed upon Mr. Nussbaum to abandon his procedure for reviewing documents in Mr. Foster's office and to replace it with one that prevented law enforcement officials from having access to Mr. Foster's papers and that permitted Ms. Williams to review and remove documents from Mr. Foster's office.
<P>Finding 8.<P>Bernard Nussbaum failed to conduct a meaningful review of Mr. Foster's office and did not describe to law enforcement officials sensitive files pertaining to the Clintons and the Administration.
<P>Mr. Nussbaum testified that he conducted a comprehensive review and described each file in Mr. Foster's office--including all the files in Mr. Foster's credenza, where a number of the Clintons' personal files were kept.  Notes taken by Mr. Spafford of the review demonstrate, however, that he provided only a very generic description, "matters re First Family"(1015); Mr. Sloan's notes are similar: "Various investment matters re: First Family."(1016)  This single general description by Mr. Nussbaum identified a number of files that Margaret Williams later transferred to the White House residence and eventually to the Clinton's personal lawyers at Williams & Connolly.  Among these files was Mr. Foster's Whitewater file; no one at the review recalled Mr. Nussbaum making any reference whatsoever to Whitewater.
<P>Although Mr. Nussbaum testified that Whitewater was not the subject of discussion in the White House at the time of Mr. Foster's death, the Special Committee finds that there was ample evidence indicating that in early 1993, the White House, and particularly Mrs. Clinton, knew that Whitewater was a potential public issue.  Whitewater had been an issue during the 1992 presidential campaign.  In late 1992, Betsey Wright, the coordinator of the Arkansas defense effort and former chief of staff to Governor Clinton, learned of a "criminal referral regarding a savings and loan official in Arkansas and ... involv[ing] the Clintons."(1017)   Upon hearing the news, she attempted to gather more information and directly told Mrs. Clinton about the referral.(1018)   And the information was circulated within the campaign.  Jim Lyons, author of the Whitewater report, testified that someone in the Clinton campaign notified him of the criminal referral.
<P>Whitewater remained a live issue when the Clintons moved into the White House.  Ricki Seidman, then Deputy Director of Communications for the White House, told the FBI that she discussed and attended meetings with Mr. Foster and the Clintons' outside counsel in April 1993 about the tax treatment of the Clinton's Whitewater investment because "it was believed the tax returns would bring the Whitewater issue into the `public domain' again."(1019)  In addition, records that the White House produced to the Special Committee after the conclusion of its public hearings indicate that James McDougal, the Clintons' Whitewater partner, called Mr. Foster at the White House just prior to his death.
<P>The Special Committee also finds that Mr. Nussbaum failed to describe adequately the contents of Mr. Foster's briefcase.  Although notes taken by Mr. Spafford and Mr. Sloan indicated that the briefcase contained a copy of the White House Travel Office Management Review, Mr. Nussbaum did not disclose that most of the contents of the briefcase pertained to the Travelgate controversy.(1020)  Specifically, Mr. Nussbaum removed Mr. Foster's notebook on the Travel Office matter from the briefcase and kept it in his office until Mr. Nussbaum's resignation in March 1994.(1021)  According to Mr. Spafford's notes, Mr. Nussbaum described the notebook as "Notebook of notes of meetings, GC [General Counsel] issues"; Mr. Sloan's notes similarly identified the notebook simply as "Notes re: meeting".(1022)  The notebook and other Travel Office documents in Mr. Foster's briefcase were not turned over to the Independent Counsel until April 5, 1995.(1023)


<P>Finding 9.<P>An index of documents in Mr. Foster's office is missing and other indices were revised following his death to conceal possible references to Whitewater.
<P>Mr. Foster's secretary, Deborah Gorham, testified that, on July 22, she entered Mr. Foster's office and opened the drawer containing the Clintons' personal documents.  "I saw Pendaflex folders and file folders, and I did not see an index that normally would have been there listing the names of the files."(1024)  Ms. Gorham maintained an index for every drawer; this one was missing.
<P>The Special Committee received three indices from the White House reflecting all the files in Mr. Foster's office.  Two are dated July 22, 1993.(1025)  One is shown to be last revised on October 25, 1993.(1026)  It is thus undisputed that the indices were compiled or revised after Mr. Foster's death.  None makes any reference to a Whitewater file known to be in Mr. Foster's office at the time of his death.
<P>The evidence before the Special Committee indicates that the indices were revised in order to remove an earlier reference to the Whitewater file.  Deborah Gorham testified that she made an index in the Spring of 1993, probably late April, and that the index reflected all the files in Mr. Foster's office at the time.(1027)  She also testified that the Whitewater file was among the files in Mr. Foster's office at the time she prepared the index.(1028)
<P>The Special Committee finds Ms. Gorham's testimony highly credible.  Ms. Gorham was careful and meticulous, identifying with certainty to the Special Committee particular characteristics of indices she maintained.  Moreover, independent evidence corroborates Ms. Gorham's recollection that Whitewater was among the files in Mr. Foster's office in April 1993.  Mr. Foster prepared the Clintons' 1992 tax returns, and one of the key issues in those returns was how to treat the Clintons' investment in Whitewater.  It is therefore highly likely that the Whitewater file was in Mr. Foster's office in April 1993, when the tax returns were due, instead of being brought into the office at a later date.
<P>Finding 10.<P>Bernard Nussbaum knew about yellow scraps of paper in Mr. Foster's briefcase prior to Stephen Neuwirth's apparent discovery on July 26, 1993.
<P>The Special Committee finds that the evidence demonstrates that Mr. Nussbaum knew about yellow scraps of paper in Mr. Foster's briefcase before Mr. Neuwirth allegedly discovered the scraps on July 26.  Mr. Spafford testified that he overheard Mr. Sloan tell Mr. Nussbaum on July 22 that there were scraps at the bottom of the briefcase.(1029)  Although neither Mr. Sloan nor Mr. Nussbaum recalled the exchange, Mr. Spafford testified that he remembered and had a privileged conversation about the incident the following week, right after he learned that Mr. Neuwirth had discovered the note in Mr. Foster's briefcase.(1030)
<P>In addition, Deborah Gorham testified that in the days after Mr. Foster's death, she told Mr. Nussbaum that she saw a file folder and something yellow, possibly "Post-it" notes in Mr. Foster's briefcase.(1031)  Ms. Gorham further testified that after Mr. Neuwirth discovered the note, Mr. Nussbaum grilled her at length about what she saw in Mr. Foster's briefcase the previous week.(1032)  Although Mr. Nussbaum testified that he did not recall grilling Ms. Gorham,(1033) the Special Committee finds her vivid recollection of Mr. Nussbaum's interrogation to be highly credible.  Mr. Nussbaum's interrogation, described by Ms. Gorham as "forceful" and "adamant",(1034) leads to the obvious inference that he was concerned about what Ms. Gorham had seen the previous week and how it would undercut his story about the discovery of the note.
<P>The Special Committee finds that Mr. Nussbaum must have known on July 22 that scraps of paper were in Mr. Foster's briefcase.  The briefcase has no flaps or inside seams that could conceal 27 pieces of yellow paper.  Captain Charles Hume remarked that the "oldest and blindest" Park Police officer would have found the note on July 22,(1035) and Sergeant Peter Markland testified that he thought Mr. Nussbaum lied when he said the note was discovered in the briefcase.(1036)  Even White House official, Bill Burton, testified that he was incredulous when he learned that Mr. Neuwirth discovered the note in Mr. Foster's briefcase.(1037)
<P>David Margolis, the career Justice Department official coordinating the investigation, offered this testimony:
<P>I thought I had this figured out, that the torn-up scraps of paper were not in the briefcase the day that Mr. Nussbaum did the search in our presence.  That's what -- that was the explanation I came up with, and that somebody -- that it had never been there before and somebody put it in afterward or it had been there, somebody took it out and then decided they better put it back because there was public speculation of, you know, where is the suicide note.

<P><P>So, in my own mind, I speculated that must be what happened.  But then, when I picked up the paper one day and saw that Mr. Spafford said that the note had been in there when the search was conducted, I am at a loss now.  I just have no explanation.  I don't know.(1038)
The Justice Department and the FBI did not have the information Mr. Spafford provided to the Special Committee when the FBI closed its investigation into the circumstances surrounding the discovery of the note.
<P>Mr. Nussbaum's conduct may be explained by the fact that law enforcement officials and Mr. Spafford were still at the White House when the existence of the scraps of paper was called to his attention by Mr. Sloan.  Rather than examining the scraps then and there, Mr. Nussbaum chose to put off such an examination until such time as he could be sure that he could do so in private.  
<P>Finding 11.<P>Margaret Williams, in consultation with Mrs. Clinton, removed files from Mr. Foster's office to the White House residence to be reviewed by the Clintons.
<P>Thomas Castleton testified that, as he helped Margaret Williams transport the Clintons' personal files to the White House residence on July 22, Ms. Williams told Mr. Castleton that she was taking the files to the residence so that the Clintons could review them.(1039)  Mr. Nussbaum testified that he discussed taking the files to the residence with Ms. Williams so that the Clintons could decide which lawyer to send them to.(1040)  Ms. Williams, however, testified that she alone made the independent determination to place the files in the residence.(1041)  Although Ms. Williams admitted calling Mrs. Clinton, Ms. Williams claimed that their discussion was limited simply to where to place the files in the residence.(1042)  
<P>The Special Committee finds that the evidence overwhelmingly demonstrates that Ms. Williams did not, as she asserted, make an independent decision to transfer the Clintons' personal files to the White House residence.
<P>Ms. Williams' story is not credible given Mr. Nussbaum's testimony that they had discussed taking the files to the residence before Ms. Williams left Mr. Foster's office.  Carolyn Huber testified that July 22 was the first time ever that Ms. Williams had placed files in the White House Residence.(1043)  Ms. Williams did not plausibly explain why she thought the residence--and not her office or somewhere else in the West Wing--was the appropriate place for the files or how personally transferring files to the residence was less taxing than having them picked up by a Williams & Connolly representative.
<P>Ms. Williams testified that, despite having never discussed the files with Ms. Williams, Mrs. Clinton did not ask any questions--even one--but simply told her to arrange the details with Ms. Huber.  Ms. Williams explained this seemingly odd response by suggesting that "I could have told Mrs. Clinton that I was going to put 44 elephants in the White House the day after Vince died and she probably would have said okay"(1044)--a suggestion that the Special Committee finds to border on the contemptuous.  Moreover, Ms. Huber testified that Ms. Williams "called and said that Mrs. Clinton had asked her to call me to take her to the residence to put this box in our third floor office."(1045)<P>  The Special Committee finds that Ms. Williams intended the files to be reviewed by the Clintons and that, in fact, someone reviewed the files before they were turned over to Williams & Connolly.  When confronted with Mr. Castleton's testimony that she said the Clintons were to review the files, Ms. Williams asked rhetorically, "Why would I tell an intern that?"(1046)  The Special Committee finds it natural that Ms. Williams would have told Mr. Castleton why the files were going to the residence--especially because, as Ms. Huber testified, Ms. Williams had never moved files to the residence.  Mr. Nussbaum testified that Ms. Williams returned a file, one dealing with White House decorations, before the Clinton personal files were transferred to Williams & Connolly.  Although, after consulting with counsel, Mr. Nussbaum stated that he was not sure that it was Ms. Williams who returned the file, he acknowledged that a file was indeed returned from the residence because it was not a Clinton personal file.(1047)  The inevitable conclusion from this testimony is that someone reviewed the files to determine which files should be returned to Mr. Nussbaum.
<P>Finding 12.<P>Senior White House officials did not provide complete and accurate information to the Park Police and FBI with respect to the handling of Mr. Foster's note.
<P>It is undisputed that Mrs. Clinton saw the note within hours of its discovery on July 26.(1048)  In addition, Susan Thomases testified that Mr. Nussbaum called and told her about the note the same afternoon.(1049)  Neither Mrs. Clinton nor Ms. Thomases were identified in the reports by the FBI or Park Police as among those who saw or knew about the note before it was turned over to the authorities.(1050)  Although Mr. Neuwirth testified that he told FBI Special Agent Salter that Mrs. Clinton was made aware of the note, his testimony is inconsistent with written records of the interview.  Neither Agent Salter's report nor his handwritten notes of the interview (later obtained by the Committee) indicated that Mr. Neuwirth told him that Mrs. Clinton was among those who saw the note.(1051)  Instead, Agent Salter's notes recorded Mr. Neuwirth's continuous narrative of the chain of events after Mr. Neuwirth discovered the note.  The narrative, however, omitted any mention of Mrs. Clinton as the second person Mr. Nussbaum brought into his office to view the note.(1052)
<P>The Special Committee finds that Mr. Neuwirth's omission of Mrs. Clinton may have been willful.  Bill Burton's handwritten record of a meeting about Mr. Foster's note on July 28, the day after the note was turned over to the authorities, listed "HRC" with an arrow pointing to an adjacent letter "n".(1053)  Because Mr. Burton testified that he did not know what his own notes meant, the Special Committee adopts the most reasonable interpretation of his notations--that those present at the meeting discussed the matter and decided not to disclose that Mrs. Clinton saw the note.
<P>Finding 13.<P>Mr. Hubbell probably knew about the discovery of Mr. Foster's note on July 27, 1993.
<P>In the hours and days following Mr. Foster's death, there was overwhelming interest in whether Mr. Foster left a note explaining the reasons for his apparent suicide.  By their own admission, Mr. Nussbaum, Ms. Thomasson, Ms. Williams, and Ms. Lieberman, testified that they conducted an improper search of Mr. Foster's office on the night of his death in order to look for a note.  Because of the seeming inexplicable nature of Mr. Foster's death and the speculations of foul play, there was a groundswell of interest in whether Mr. Foster had left a note prior to his death.  The White House released an official statement stating that "no suicide note or other document bearing on" Mr. Foster's death had been found.(1054)  And news articles in the week following Mr. Foster's death generally mentioned the anomaly that a note had not been found.(1055)
<P>On July 27, approximately 26 hours after a note in Mr. Foster's hand was discovered by White House officials, White House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum finally contacted Attorney General Reno and Deputy Attorney General Heymann to turn over the note.  Apparently unbeknownst to Ms. Reno and Mr. Heymann, Associate Attorney General Webster Hubbell was upstairs in the White House Residence with Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Thomases while they were downstairs receiving news of the note.  Mr. Hubbell's records indicate that Mrs. Clinton had called his office and left a message at 2:30 p.m. that afternoon.(1056)  White House logs indicate that Mr. Hubbell arrived at the Residence at 6:29 p.m. and remained there until 8:19 p.m.(1057)  Ms. Thomases, who was in the Residence at the same time as Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Hubbell, exited the White House at the same time.(1058)  Neither Ms. Thomases nor Mr. Hubbell recalled discussing the note with each other or with Mrs. Clinton on that day.  Ms. Thomases testified, "I don't know that Hillary Clinton and I have ever discussed that writing."(1059)
<P>When presented with the entry and exit logs, Ms. Thomases acknowledged that she met with Mr. Hubbell and Mrs. Clinton in the Residence following Mr. Foster's death.(1060)  Secret Service records indicate that July 27 was the only time in the week following Mr. Foster's death that Mrs. Clinton, Ms. Thomases, and Mr. Hubbell were together in the White House.  Ms. Thomases implausibly testified, however, that during there meeting the three only reminisced about Mr. Foster and their friendship.(1061) 
<P>For his part, Mr. Hubbell testified that he did not recall even seeing Ms. Thomases on July 27.(1062)  He testified that he came to the White House on July 27 in order to give Mrs. Clinton an account of Mr. Foster's funeral after Mrs. Clinton left.  "I remember that I had to go to the White House to tell Hillary about what had gone on after they left the funeral, but I don't have any memory of doing it."(1063)  He testified that it was part of the grieving process:  "We, as Southerners, we have large long funerals and we get together and drink and eat and talk and do it for days.  And Hillary had missed that grieving process, and I remember my wife saying, Hillary needs to talk to you.  She needs to understand who was there and things of that sort."(1064)  
<P>Mr. Hubbell testified that he learned about the note when he "read it in the newspaper,"(1065) and that he did not discuss the note with Mrs. Clinton during his post-funeral visit to the White House.(1066)  The Special Committee finds Mr. Hubbell's testimony incredible.  Whether there was a note was the topic of interest, inquiry, and speculation for all involved in the story of Mr. Foster's death.  White House officials conducted an improper search of Mr. Foster's office on the night of his death specifically, according to their own testimony, to look for a note.  The Park Police had specifically asked about the existence of a note on the night of his death, and continued to look for indications of why Mr. Foster took his life during its investigation.  Mr. Hubbell's high-ranking colleagues at the Justice Department were at the White House at the same time as Mr. Hubbell to receive the note from Mr. Nussbaum.  Mrs. Clinton had called Ms. Thomases repeatedly to summon her to Washington for a meeting on July 27, and Mrs. Clinton had called Mr. Hubbell on the afternoon of July 27.  Given all these events, there is little possibility that three of the persons closest to Mr. Foster--Mrs. Clinton, Ms. Thomases, and Mr. Hubbell--two of whom knew about the existence of the note, were in the private quarters of the White House together without for two hours without any mention of the note.
<P>The Special Committee adopts the most reasonable <P>Finding in light of the circumstances, that Mr. Hubbell most likely learned of the existence of the note either before or during his meeting with Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Thomases on July 27, 1993.
<P>Finding 14.<P>Margaret Williams provided inaccurate and incomplete testimony to the Special Committee in order to conceal Mrs. Clinton's role in the handling of documents in Mr. Foster's office following his death.
<P>The testimony of Margaret Williams, the First Lady's Chief of Staff, to the Special Committee was frequently inconsistent with her prior statements and contradicted by the testimony of other witnesses.  These numerous and varied contradictions in Ms. Williams's testimony followed one predictable pattern:  they diminished Ms. Williams' role in the events surrounding the handling of the documents in Mr. Foster's office and, more important, concealed Mrs. Clinton's involvement in this now controversial matter.  Although Ms. Williams's testimony may not necessarily be untruthful with respect to each and every contradiction, the obvious pattern of the contradictions and inconsistencies leads inexorably to the conclusion that she did not provide complete and accurate testimony to the Special Committee.
<P>Ms. Williams testified implausibly that she entered Mr. Foster's office on the night of his death in the vain hope of Finding Mr. Foster there.(1067)  She claimed that she did not remove any files from the White House Counsel's suite and that her assistant, Evelyn Lieberman, did not even enter the suite on July 20.  Officer Henry O'Neill testified, however, that he saw Ms. Williams remove files, three to five inches thick, from the suite and place them in her office.(1068)  According to Officer O'Neill, Ms. Lieberman was there and introduced Ms. Williams to Officer O'Neill.(1069)
<P>After searching Mr. Foster's office, Ms. Williams went home and called Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Thomases.  When asked about these late-night telephone calls, Ms. Williams testified to the Special Committee that she did not talk to Mrs. Clinton about the search of Mr. Foster's office.  Ms. Williams also denied talking with Susan Thomases.(1070)  After being confronted with records indicating that she called Ms. Thomases at 1:10 a.m. on July 21, Ms. Williams insisted that her earlier testimony was only that she did not recall talking to Ms. Thomases.(1071)  When reminded that she actually said, "I didn't talk to her,"(1072)  Ms. Williams replied, "I'm not going to argue with you.  I think this is exactly what I said."(1073)
<P>With respect to Mrs. Clinton's involvement in the much criticized decision to keep law enforcement from reviewing documents in Mr. Foster's office on July 22, Ms. Williams did not tell the Special Committee initially about her early morning phone call to the Rodham residence.(1074)  When presented with records documenting the telephone call made at 7:44 EDT, Ms. Williams replied, "I don't remember who I talked to."(1075)  
<P>Ms. Williams initially testified that she did not speak to Susan Thomases on the telephone on July 22.(1076)  Telephone records indicated, however, that Susan Thomases called Ms. Williams' office twice on July 21 and five times on July 22.(1077)  Ms. Thomases made these repeated telephone calls to Ms. Williams' office on July 22 at the same time that White House officials were meeting to discuss the procedures for searching Mr. Foster's office.(1078)  When questioned about these calls, Ms. Williams suggested that she was at home in the morning of July 22.(1079)  Records from the U.S. Secret Service established, however, that Ms. Williams entered the White House at 8:10 a.m. on July 22.(1080)
<P>Ms. Williams testified that she did not review files in Mr. Foster's office on the afternoon of July 22, but Mr. Nussbaum testified that Ms. Williams helped him pick out the Clintons' personal files.(1081)  Deborah Gorham also testified that Ms. Williams was in Mr. Foster's office when Mr. Nussbaum asked Ms. Gorham to point out the location of the Clintons' personal files.(1082)  Ms. Williams claimed that she made a completely independent decision to have the Clintons' personal files transferred to the White House residence en route to Williams & Connolly.(1083)  Mr. Nussbaum testified, however, that he and Ms. Williams discussed the matter and decided to remove the files to the residence, and then the Clintons would decide where the files should go.(1084)  While she was in Mr. Foster's office, Ms. Williams called Mrs. Clinton.  Although the two had not talked previously about any transfer of files, Ms. Williams testified that she, improbably, asked Mrs. Clinton simply where the files should go in the residence, and had no other discussions with Mrs. Clinton about what the files contained or where they came from.(1085)  
<P>Ms. Williams asserted that she did not intend for the Clintons to review the files after they were placed in the residence.  Thomas Castleton testified, however, that Ms. Williams expressly told him that she was taking the files to the residence so the Clintons could review them.(1086)  Ms. Williams denies saying this to Mr. Castleton.(1087)  Carolyn Huber testified that, after Ms. Williams placed the files in the residence closet, Ms. Huber returned the key to its usual place, in a marked envelope in the desk drawer.(1088)  Ms. Williams, however, testified that Ms. Huber gave her the key, which Ms. Williams kept on her key chain until she had to open the closet for a Williams & Connolly representative.(1089)  Ms. Williams testified that no one reviewed the files while they were in the residence, but Mr. Nussbaum testified that someone, probably Ms. Williams, returned a residence file because it was determined not to be a Clinton personal file.(1090)
<P>Finding 15.<P>Susan Thomases provided inaccurate and incomplete testimony to the Special Committee in order to conceal Mrs. Clinton's role in the handling of documents in Mr. Foster's office following his death.
<P>Susan Thomases, a prominent New York attorney, was Mrs. Clinton's conduit to the White House staff.  She was in close contact with Mrs. Clinton and the White House staff throughout the week following Mr. Foster's death.  Although the documentary and other evidence before the Special Committee established that Ms. Thomases was involved in every key event relating to the handling of documents in Mr. Foster's office following his death, her testimony to the Special Committee with respect to these key events was often implausible, incomplete or inaccurate.
<P>When Ms. Thomases first appeared before the Special Committee, on August 8, 1995, she was asked whether she had discussed her appearance with Mrs. Clinton.  Ms. Thomases testified, "I did not discuss my opinion--my appearance here today with Hillary Clinton."(1091)  On December 18, 1995, however, Ms. Thomases contradicted herself by admitting that she had actually talked with Mrs. Clinton about her appearance "way back when, before the first hearing."  According to Ms. Thomases, she and Mrs. Clinton discussed "that I was going to have to come down, and that I didn't think that I had very much interesting to tell you, that you were still going to ask me the questions because you felt the need to ask me the questions."(1092)
<P>On the night of Mr. Foster's death, Ms. Thomases paged Ms. Williams at 12:15 a.m., while Ms. Williams was at the White House.  When asked whether she talked to Margaret Williams after Ms. Williams searched Mr. Foster's office, Ms. Thomases claimed that she did not "recollect speaking with [Ms. Williams] that night.  That's not to say that she didn't call me back and I didn't speak to her, but I have no independent recollection of having spoken with her that night."(1093)  The Committee later obtained telephone records, however, indicating that Ms. Williams, right after speaking with Mrs. Clinton, called Ms. Thomases at 1:10 a.m. and spoke for 14 minutes.(1094)
<P>With respect to her role in changing the procedures for reviewing documents in Mr. Foster's office, Ms. Thomases acknowledged that she spoke with Bernard Nussbaum on July 22.  According to Ms. Thomases, Mr. Nussbaum brought up the subject of reviewing documents in Mr. Foster's office and described his plan of action, to which Ms. Thomases replied simply that it "sounds good to me."(1095)  Mr. Nussbaum, however, testified that Ms. Thomases initiated the discussion, said that "people were concerned" about the review, and attempted to impose her views on the proper procedures.(1096)  Even more importantly, Associate White House Counsel Stephen Neuwirth testified that Mr. Nussbaum understood from the conversation that Ms. Thomases and Mrs. Clinton were concerned about law enforcement officials having "unfettered access" to Mr. Foster's office.(1097)
<P>Ms. Thomases testified that "I don't remember ever having a conversation with Hillary Clinton during the period after Vince Foster's death about the documents in Vince Foster's office."(1098)  Telephone records, however, established that, after receiving the early morning call from Ms. Williams, Mrs. Clinton called Ms. Thomases at 6:57 a.m. CDT on July 22, and talked for three minutes.(1099)  Ms. Thomases then immediately paged Mr. Nussbaum at the White House and subsequently expressed her concerns about the search procedures.(1100)  Even after confronted with these telephone records, Ms. Thomases maintained that she called Mr. Nussbaum merely to commiserate because she was "worried about my friend Bernie."(1101)  Ms. Thomases testified that her early-morning conversation with Mrs. Clinton was about "the possibility that I didn't feel well enough to go to Little Rock" for Mr. Foster's funeral.(1102)
<P>When questioned about the repeated telephone calls she made to Ms. Williams's office on July 22 at the same time that White House officials were meeting to discuss the procedures for searching Mr. Foster's office, Ms. Thomases claimed that she probably was attempting not to reach Ms. Williams but rather to be transferred to someone else in the White House.(1103)  Ms. Thomases also implausibly suggested that she may have been put on hold during these lengthy calls, for as long as nine minutes,(1104) despite her earlier testimony that July 22 was "a very, very busy day in my work."(1105)
<P>Finally, U.S. Secret Service records established that Ms. Thomases entered the White House at 2:50 p.m. on July 27.(1106)  Within ten minutes of her entry, Robert Barnett arrived at the White House to meet with Mrs. Clinton.(1107)  During this visit, Mr. Barnett reviewed the Clintons' personal files, previously in Mr. Foster's office, and transferred them from the White House residence to Williams & Connolly.(1108)  Ms. Thomases left the White House at 8:20 p.m., after Mr. Nussbaum had turned the note apparently in Mr. Foster's handwriting over to Attorney General Janet Reno.  When asked about this unusual visit to the White House--Ms. Thomases is normally in Washington on Wednesdays(1109)--Ms. Thomases testified that she implausibly had "no specific recollection of being at the White House on the 27th."(1110)
<P>Finding 16.<P>Bernard Nussbaum provided inaccurate and incomplete testimony to the Special Committee concerning the handling of documents in Mr. Foster's office following his death. 
<P>As members of the Special Committee recognized previously, "a witness' response of `I don't recall' or `I don't remember' may also be a false statement to the Committee."(1111)
<P>Bernard Nussbaum did not recall Bill Burton asking him to seal Mr. Foster's office on the night of Mr. Foster's death.(1112)  Sylvia Mathews testified that she overheard the conversation,(1113) and her notes supported the testimony.(1114)
<P>Mr. Nussbaum did not recall talking to Philip Heymann on July 21 about the procedures for reviewing documents in Mr. Foster's office.(1115)  Mr. Heymann testified that he and Mr. Nussbaum agreed that Justice Department lawyers would review the documents;(1116) David Margolis,(1117) Roger Adams,(1118) and Charles Hume(1119) testified that Mr. Heymann so described the procedure to them on July 21.
<P>Mr. Nussbaum did not recall overruling Mr. Neuwirth when Mr. Neuwirth stated in the evening of July 21 that Mr. Nussbaum would review the documents.(1120)  Mr. Adams and Mr. Margolis described the incident in detail at the time to other Justice Department officials and later to the Special Committee.(1121)
<P>Mr. Nussbaum did not recall telling Mr. Neuwirth that Ms. Thomases and Mrs. Clinton were concerned about investigators having "unfettered access" to Mr. Foster's office.(1122)
<P>Mr. Nussbaum did not recall telling Mr. Heymann on July 22 that he would call Mr. Heymann back before conducting the search.(1123)  
<P>Mr. Nussbaum did not recall Mr. Margolis or Mr. Heymann telling him on July 22 that he was making a "terrible mistake" by changing the procedures.(1124)  
<P>Mr. Nussbaum did not recall Mr. Heymann calling him in the evening and asking him, "Bernie, are you hiding something?"(1125)  
<P>Mr. Nussbaum did not recall telling Susan Thomases about the note on July 26.(1126)
<P>The frequency of these memory lapses contrasted with Mr. Nussbaum's very definite recollection of other purported facts -- facts that put his conduct in a more favorable light.  Mr. Nussbaum was sure that no one removed any files from Mr. Foster's office on the night of his death.  He was sure that there was no agreement with the Justice Department with respect to procedures to review documents in Mr. Foster's office.  He was sure that there was no discussions in the White House about Whitewater at the time of Mr. Foster's death.
<P>Whether a product of deliberate deception or selective memory, Mr. Nussbaum's frequent and convenient assertions that he did not recall important, often damaging, events lead the Special Committee to the obvious conclusion that Mr. Nussbaum provided incomplete and inaccurate testimony to the Special Committee.
<P>*<P>*<P>*
<P>The Committee's ability to investigate fully the true facts concerning the handling of documents in Mr. Foster's office following his death has been hindered by the often incomplete and inaccurate testimony of key witnesses.  In conjunction with this report of findings, the Special Committee has voted to refer the matter, including the testimony of specific witnesses, to the Office of Independent Counsel for investigation of possible criminal violations.
<P>In sum, notwithstanding the pattern of stonewalling by the White House and other witnesses, the Special Committee uncovered evidence that clearly established a pattern of highly improper conduct by senior White House officials in the days following Mr. Foster's death.  The Committee and the American people will never know exactly what happened in Mr. Foster's office in the days after his death -- what documents were removed, whether any documents were destroyed, and whether any evidence of ethical or even criminal misconduct was covered up.  The misguided actions of senior White House officials raise not only questions of impropriety, but also raise the specter that investigations were impeded and justice thwarted

<B>CONCLUSIONS OF THE SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON THE DISCOVERY  
OF THE ROSE LAW FIRM BILLING RECORDS </B>    291<BR><BR>

     1.     The Rose billing records provide the best evidence of the legal services performed by Mrs. Clinton for Madison Guaranty.     291<BR>
     2.     The disappearance and mysterious reappearance of the Rose Law Firm billing records was part of a larger patten of removal, concealment and, at times, destruction of records concerning Mrs. Clinton's representation of Madison.     297<BR>

     7.     Only a limited number of people were definitely within the chain of custody of the billing records.     301<BR>

        <H2>  CONCLUSIONS OF THE SPECIAL COMMITTEE</H2>
     "Try to find out what's going on in Investigation"
<BR><BR>
     "Vacuum Rose Law files  WWDC docs-subpoena<BR>
      *Documents--> Never know go out
                        quietly"(1)<BR><BR>

<P>"HRC `doesn't want [an independent counsel] poking into 20 years of public life in Arkansas'"

<P><P>-- Diary of Roger Altman, former Deputy Secretary of Treasury, quoting Margaret Williams, Chief of Staff to the First Lady.


<P>"HI<P>Spcl Counsel-3 major problems: (1) HRC adamantly opposed (2) Reno has shut the door (3) if we ask looks like we ducked." 

<P><P>-- Handwritten notes of Mark Gearan, former Director of White House Communications.


<P>Our nation rests on the principle that all Americans are equal under the law.  No one, including the President, is entitled to special treatment in a civil or criminal investigation of their conduct.  The power of the presidency may not be used to obtain a legal defense for the President and his associates unavailable to other citizens.
<P>During the 1992 presidential campaign, questions surfaced about the relationship of then-Governor Clinton and Mrs. Clinton and James McDougal, the owner of Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan Association ("Madison Guaranty") and the Clintons' partner in the Whitewater Development Corporation, Inc. ("Whitewater").  Within the past month, a jury in Little Rock, Arkansas convicted Mr. McDougal, his former wife, Susan, and Arkansas Governor Jim Guy Tucker of numerous federal crimes relating to the activities of Madison Guaranty and, in part, the operation of Whitewater.
<P> McDougal-Tucker convictions grew out of an investigation begun during the 1992 presidential campaign by investigators of the Resolution Trust Corporation ("RTC").  This RTC investigation culminated in a series of criminal referrals to the United States Attorney's Office in Little Rock naming the Clintons as witnesses to suspected criminal activity.  These significant convictions also rested on a parallel inquiry begun in 1992 by the Small Business Administration ("SBA") of Capital Management Services, Inc. ("CMS"), a small business investment company.
<P>Within months of the inauguration of President Clinton, senior Administration officials began to take steps to minimize the legal and political damage to the Clintons arising from these investigations.  These officials seriously misused their public offices for the Clintons' private benefit, obtained confidential law enforcement information from the RTC and SBA relating to investigations touching on the Clintons, and they attempted to interfere in ongoing law enforcement investigations.
<P>During hearings in the summer of 1994, the Senate Banking Committee examined -- in deference to the investigation of Special Counsel Robert Fiske -- only the propriety of certain communications in late 1993 and early 1994 between senior officials of the White House and the Treasury Department concerning confidential RTC criminal referrals involving Madison and Whitewater.  The White House then claimed that its receipt of this confidential law enforcement information was appropriate to allow the President to respond to press inquiries and to protect the President from inadvertently engaging in meetings that later could prove embarrassing.  No one -- and certainly no member of the Banking Committee -- asserted that the President was entitled to use such information to further his personal legal interests.
<P>Rather than being limited to the narrow question before the Banking Committee in the 103rd Congress, and without objection by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, the Special Committee examined all aspects of the Clinton Administration's response to ongoing investigations of Whitewater and related matters.  This broader inquiry revealed that in 1993 and 1994, senior Administration officials took steps that went far beyond what was necessary to respond to press inquiries.  Indeed, when the full picture is examined, the claim that Administration officials were innocently gathering information so they could respond to press inquires collapses entirely.
<P>   After careful review of all the evidence, including evidence obtained by the Banking Committee during the summer of 1994, the Special Committee concludes that senior Administration officials -- in the White House, the Treasury and Justice Departments, the RTC and the SBA -- engaged in a pattern of highly improper conduct in responding to investigations of the Clintons' involvement in Whitewater and related matters.
<P>This pattern cannot be explained as the result of a series of lapses in judgment.  The Committee concludes that these Administration officials deliberately misused their public offices to advance the purely private interests of the President and Mrs. Clinton.  Raising the possibility of obstruction of justice, they repeatedly attempted to hinder, impede and control investigations of Whitewater and related matters by the RTC, the Justice Department, the Inspectors General of the RTC and Treasury Departments, and even the Senate.
<P>Because of misdeeds of the White House, perhaps the American people will never know  the full extent to which the highly improper actions of Administration officials prejudiced the outcome of inquiries involving Whitewater, Madison Guaranty and related matters.  But the available facts clearly demonstrate that Administration officials improperly used the power of their offices in a wrongful attempt to ensure that ongoing federal investigations resulted in the least amount of legal and political damage to the President and Mrs. Clinton.
<P>*   *   *
1.<P>By mid-1993, the Clintons and their associates had already taken steps to minimize their potential liability from investigations of Whitewater and Madison Guaranty.
<P>The pattern of concealment, interference and abuse of power surrounding the Clintons' response to federal investigations of Whitewater and Madison Guaranty began in the mid-1980s.
<P>On July 2, 1986, the Arkansas Securities Commissioner, Beverly Bassett Schaffer, warned Governor Clinton that federal regulators were about to remove James McDougal from the management of Madison Guaranty.  Specifically, she wrote to the Governor's chief counsel that the S&L was in "serious trouble."(2)  
<P>On July 14, just four days after the Federal Home Loan Bank Board removed Mr. McDougal from Madison, Mrs. Clinton terminated her law firm's relationship with Madison Guaranty and returned the unused portion of the S&L's retainer.(3)  That same day, Governor Clinton erroneously advised his Chief of Staff, Betsey Wright, that he and Mrs. Clinton were no longer partners of Mr. McDougal in the Whitewater real estate investment.(4)
<P>In 1988, after federal regulators had taken over Madison Guaranty and were investigating insider dealing that contributed to the S&L's collapse, Mrs. Clinton took the questionable step of ordering the destruction of records reflecting her and her law firm's work for Madison.(5)  At the time, Seth Ward, a former associate of Mr. McDougal, was suing Madison Guaranty over a land deal that federal regulators have described as a fraud.  The Committee has recently obtained evidence indicating that Mrs. Clinton herself may have had greater involvement in creating documents that concealed irregular loans between Mr. Ward and Madison than her own statements admit.(6)
<P>In late fall 1992, Mrs. Clinton learned of an RTC "criminal referral regarding a savings and loan official in Arkansas and . . . involv[ing] the Clintons."(7)  After the election, her law partner and Mr. Ward's son-in-law, Webster Hubbell secretly and improperly removed the firm's client files for Madison without obtaining the approval of the firm or the RTC, which at this point owned them in its capacity as conservator of Madison Guaranty.(8)  In anticipation of the possibility that the Clintons might need the Madison files (as well as other client files) to respond to an inquiry, Mr. Hubbell brought the records from Little Rock to Washington -- storing them in his basement for almost a year.  In some instances, Mr. Hubbell left the firm with no copies of the relevant files, including billing records.
<P>By March 1993, senior Clinton Administration officials confirmed that the RTC had sent a criminal referral mentioning the Clintons to the Justice Department.  Specifically, RTC Senior Vice President William Roelle advised Roger Altman, then Deputy Treasury Secretary and a close associate of the President, of the existence of the RTC referral involving the Clintons.(9)
<P>In a pattern that would be repeated, Mr. Altman signaled the White House about this confidential RTC information which was not yet the subject of any press inquiries.  On March 23 and 24, Mr. Altman sent Mr. Nussbaum, by facsimile, two news articles, written the year before, concerning the Clintons' Whitewater investment.(10)  
<P>In early May 1993, again prior to any press inquiries, the White House learned of another investigation relating to President Clinton.  Former SBA Associate Administrator Wayne Foren testified that David Hale, who was a key prosecution witness in the recently concluded McDougal-Tucker trial, told him that he had access and influence with Governor Tucker and President Clinton.(11)  On May 5, Mr. Foren briefed Erskine Bowles, the new SBA Administrator, on the agency's investigation of CMS and Mr. Hale.(12)  Mr. Foren and his deputy understood that Mr. Bowles passed this confidential information to White House Chief of Staff Mack McLarty.(13)  
2.<P>The White House concealed damaging evidence about Whitewater and Travelgate from career law enforcement officials investigating Vincent Foster's death.
<P>In July 1993, as described in Part I of this Report, senior White House officials engaged in highly improper conduct in handling the documents in the office of former White House Deputy Counsel Vincent Foster following his death.  By the time of Mr. Foster's death, the Clintons and their associates were aware that the Clintons' involvement with Whitewater and Madison Guaranty might subject them to liability, and that Mr. Foster's office might contain damaging evidence about the Whitewater and Travelgate affairs.  Over the objection of the Deputy Attorney General and at the direction of Mrs. Clinton, senior White House officials prevented law enforcement officials from examining Mr. Foster's records.  Mrs. Clinton's Chief of Staff, Margaret Williams, then transferred damaging Whitewater files to the White House Residence for review by the President and Mrs. Clinton.
3.<P>Senior White House officials improperly gathered confidential information about investigations involving Whitewater and Madison Guaranty.
<P>By the summer of 1993, the White House began to obtain information about the looming Whitewater investigation.  On August 17, Randy Coleman, David Hale's attorney, told Associate White House Counsel William Kennedy that Mr. Hale was under investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, that he expected to be indicted soon, and that the investigation could affect the President.(14)
<P>Several days later, Mr. Kennedy -- not the Clintons' private counsel -- called Mr. Coleman, who commented that if Heidi Fleiss "was madam to the stars, David Hale was the lender to the political elite in Arkansas."(15)  Mr. Coleman told Mr. Kennedy that Mr. Hale's firm had made a number of improper loans involving politicians, including Governor Clinton.(16)  Mr. Kennedy advised Counsel to the President Bernard Nussbaum of Hale's allegations against the President.(17)
<P>Sometime in September, the White House apparently obtained confidential information from the U.S. Attorney's Office in Little Rock, through Mr. McDougal's counsel, regarding the likelihood that Mr. McDougal would be indicted imminently.(18)
<P> By late September 1993, the RTC Office of Investigations in Kansas City prepared nine criminal referrals related to Madison Guaranty.  The submission of the referrals to the Justice Department was, however, delayed by a week due to a demand by lawyers in the RTC's Professional Liability Section to perform a "legal review" of the referrals.
<P>During that week, Jean Hanson, the General Counsel of the Department of Treasury, which oversaw the RTC and its investigations, informed White House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum and Associate White House Counsel Clifford Sloan that there were several RTC referrals involving Madison, Whitewater, and the Clintons.(19)  Ms. Hanson told Mr. Nussbaum that the President and Mrs. Clinton were identified as possible witnesses to the suspected crimes at issue in the referrals.(20)  Ms. Hanson also told Mr. Nussbaum that the referrals referenced possible improper campaign contributions from Madison to one of Mr. Clinton's gubernatorial campaign.(21)  Mr. Nussbaum admitted that Ms. Hanson provided him with nonpublic information about the referrals.(22)
<P>This improper transmittal of confidential RTC information was a violation of clearly established RTC procedures as criminal referrals derived from records of financial institutions are subject to the restrictions of the Right to Financial Privacy Act.(23)  
<P>The day after this private conversation, on September 30, Ms. Hanson called Mr. Sloan to amplify on the confidential information she had provided(24) and informed him that the nine referrals, among other things, referred to Governor Jim Guy Tucker,(25) named a Clinton gubernatorial campaign as a "co-conspirator,"(26) and mentioned the Clintons as potential witnesses.(27)  In accordance with instructions from Mr. Nussbaum, Mr. Sloan relayed this information to Bruce Lindsey on or about September 30.(28)  
<P>On October 4 or 5, 1993, Mr. Lindsey apprised President Clinton of the criminal referrals.(29)  It is highly likely that Mr. Lindsey told the President, a former Governor of Arkansas, that his immediate successor was mentioned in a criminal referral.  When asked about President Clinton's response, Mr. Lindsey testified that "it was certainly nothing other than just sort of, `hmmmmmmm.'"(30)
<P>Two days later, President Clinton and Mack McLarty had meetings at the White House with Governor Tucker.(31)  Although the President and Mr. McLarty have denied briefing Governor Tucker on the criminal referrals, senior White House officials undeniably put the President in the position where a legitimate question can be raised that such a briefing occurred.  This fact wholly undermines the White House's claim that it was entitled to receive confidential information about the RTC criminal referrals to protect the President from embarrassing meetings with persons named in those referrals.    
<P>On October 14, 1993, senior White House officials met again in Mr. Nussbaum's office with senior officials from the Treasury Department about the criminal referrals.(32)  The discussion included a detailed description of the referrals(33) including the fact that one of the referrals "involved four cashiers checks -- each for $3,000, two made payable to the Clinton for Governor Campaign and two made payable to Bill Clinton."(34)
4.<P>A pivotal event:  senior White House officials and private counsel for the Clintons participate in an improper Whitewater defense meeting.
<P>On November 5, 1993, armed with details of the confidential RTC criminal referrals obtained from the Treasury Department -- as well as information on Mr. Hale's allegations obtained from the SBA -- White House officials met with the Clintons' private lawyers, "to impart information to the Clinton's personal lawyers,"(35) and to arrange "a division of labor between personal and White House counsel for handling future Whitewater issues."(36)   
<P>When asked whether the gathering was a legal defense meeting, Mr. Lindsey testified that "that would accurately characterize the meeting."(37)  The meeting was not, according to Mr. Lindsey, for the official purpose of responding to press inquiries.(38)  The participants, for example, discussed either "vacuum[ing]," or a "vacuum" in, the Rose Law Firm's files on Madison.  In any event, members of the White House Counsel's office were clearly being employed in the service of the Clintons' private legal defense effort.
<P>Mr. Kennedy's contemporaneous notes of this meeting, which the Special Committee finally obtained after the full Senate voted to authorize the Senate Legal Counsel to institute a civil enforcement proceeding, indicate that a significant portion of the discussion was related to the confidential criminal referrals and the ongoing RTC investigation of Madison.  Among the principal topics of the meeting was the referral related to illegal contributions to Mr. Clinton's gubernatorial campaigns.(39)
<P>The Kennedy notes indicate that the White House officials imparted to the private lawyers much of the knowledge they possessed with respect to Whitewater, including confidential information.  As of November 5, the RTC considered the information about the referrals confidential and had not officially confirmed the accuracy of any press accounts about the referrals.(40)
<P>It was improper for White House officials to communicate confidential RTC or other law enforcement information to the Clintons' private lawyers to assist them in defending the Clintons against the RTC or any other potential civil or criminal enforcement actions.  The investigations of Madison raised the possibility that the President or Mrs. Clinton personally could be held liable, financially or otherwise, in connection with Rose Law Firm's representation or the activities of Whitewater.
<P>The Special Committee concludes that the decision, as reflected in the November 5 meeting of White House officials and the Clintons' private counsel to cooperate in their response to the Whitewater investigations facing the Clintons represented a fundamental and disturbing turning point in the investigation.  Although the Clintons faced adverse legal actions by the United States, they were relying on United States officials at the highest levels to defeat or avoid such actions.  After the November 5 meeting, senior White House officials could no longer assert that their Whitewater efforts were solely intended to serve the government's official interests.  The White House had completely obliterated the distinction between the public interest and the Clintons' private good.
5.<P>Senior White House officials did not pass the torch to the Clintons' new private counsel, but continued to take highly improper steps to advance the Clintons' private interests.
<P>Although the White House has claimed that the purpose of the November 5 meeting was to "pass the torch between White House lawyers who had been handling Whitewater to the newly hired attorney, David Kendall,"(41) that clearly proved not to be the case.  After the meeting, members of the White House Counsel's Office undeniably took affirmative steps to collect confidential information about the federal investigations into Whitewater -- information that private counsel could not obtain.
<P>For example, on November 16, 1993, Mr. Eggleston obtained confidential information in the form of a stack of documents "approximately one foot high" -- from the SBA about criminal referrals involving Mr. Hale.(42)  Mr. Eggleston reviewed these confidential documents for any references to President or Mrs. Clinton.  The Justice Department later demanded that Mr. Eggleston return the documents to the SBA.  Fraud Section Chief Gerald McDowell remarked:  "I've got to believe the WH counsel have done an incredibly stupid thing!"(43)  Contrary to Mr. Eggleston's denial, the Special Committee concludes that the evidence, particularly the documentary evidence, indicates that he shared this information with Bruce Lindsey, then the chief White House advisor on Whitewater.
6.<P>Senior White House officials held formal "Whitewater Response Team" meetings to protect the Clintons' private interests in ongoing federal investigations.
<P>In January 1994, a group of senior White House officials frequently met twice daily as a "Whitewater Response Team."(44)  These meetings must be viewed in context.  They went far beyond what was necessary to respond to press inquiries or to address other official matters.  The meetings were held after the critical November 5 defense meeting with the Clintons' personal counsel.  And, the Clintons' private defense counsel, Mr. Kendall, directly or indirectly participated in these meetings.
<P>During the initial Whitewater Response Meetings, senior White House officials debated the appointment of a special counsel to investigate Whitewater.  Normally, the decision whether to ask for the appointment of a special counsel would be an official matter.  The appropriateness of members of the Whitewater Response Team debating this matter, however, was fatally compromised by their earlier participation in the November 5 defense meeting.  Thus, in discussions over the wisdom of appointing a special counsel, the assembled group undeniably considered matters relevant to the Clintons' personally -- for example, whether the Clinton associates could be pressured into cooperating with the special counsel.
<P>    Mrs. Clinton opposed the appointment of a special counsel, and her opposition was the source of considerable concern within the White House.(45)  Notes taken by Communications Director Mark Gearan of a January 4, 1994 meeting reflect that Mrs. Clinton attended a meeting, then in progress, and said "this looks like a meeting I might be interested in."(46)  Mr. Gearan testified that Mrs. Clinton stayed for approximately 15 minutes,(47) and expressed her view that no special counsel be appointed.(48)
<P>Senior White House officials, and Mrs. Clinton in particular, feared that persons close to President Clinton might be indicted.  At a January 7, 1993 meeting, Mr. Nussbaum curiously said, "Indictments will be Betsey Wright."(49)  Ms. Wright was Governor Clinton's former Chief of Staff in the 1980s and handled Whitewater and other Arkansas-related matters for the 1992 Clinton Presidential campaign.(50)  A White House document marked "Confidential:  Second Draft, Summary of Arguments Re: Whitewater," dated January 10, 1994, listed reasons against the appointment of a prosecutor,(51)  including that a special counsel investigation "may result in focus on friends and associates of the President, begin to squeeze them and may subject some to indictment."(52)
<P>On January 8, 1994, Deputy Chief of Staff Harold Ickes expressed discontent with the manner in which career Justice Department prosecutors -- Donald MacKay and Alan Carver -- were then handling the ongoing federal investigations of the Clintons.(53)  Mr. Ickes described Mr. Carver as a "bad guy" and actually said of Messrs. MacKay and Carver:  "Those guys are f------ us blue."(54)
<P>The Whitewater Response Team assigned tasks to White House attorneys that should have been handled solely by the Clintons' private attorneys.  For example, Mr. Eggleston prepared a legal analysis on the statute of limitations applicable to claims brought by the RTC and on the potential civil liability faced by the Clintons arising from their involvement with Madison Guaranty.(55)  Another White House official was assigned the task of contacting Christopher Wade, the realtor of the Whitewater property, to gather information from him.(56)
<P>The Whitewater Response Team was particularly concerned about the potentially adverse testimony of Beverly Bassett Schaffer, the former Arkansas Securities Commissioner who oversaw the regulation of Madison Guaranty in the mid-1980s.  An RTC criminal referral expressly referenced Ms. Schaffer, and her contact with Mrs. Clinton in connection with Mrs. Clinton's representation of Madison Guaranty.  At a January 7 meeting, Mr. Ickes exclaimed, "[Beverly] Bassett [Schaffer] is so f----- important. [I]f we f--- this up, we're done."(57)
<P>Even the President worried about Ms. Schaffer.  In late December, he directed Messrs. Lindsey and McLarty:  "This is important to be on top of.  Bassett did a good job in [campaign] on this -- can she now?"(58)  In an effort to conceal the White House's involvement, the Response Team debated sending outside emissaries to speak with Ms. Schaffer.(59)  Shortly thereafter, Mr. Lindsey's former law partner, John Tisdale, and another Clinton confidant, Skip Rutherford, contacted Ms. Schaffer.  Mr. Tisdale reported back to Mr. Lindsey by memoranda,(60) and Mr. Rutherford discussed Ms. Schaffer with the White House.(61)  Ms. Schaffer further testified that although Mr. Rutherford did not specifically indicate he was calling on behalf of the White House, she was aware that Mr. Rutherford was "helping" Mr. McLarty in some capacity.(62)
7.<P>In early 1994, senior White House officials sought to manipulate the RTC investigation of Madison Guaranty and the Rose Law Firm.
<P>In early 1994, while the Whitewater Response Team was, in effect, plotting the Clintons' legal defense, there were substantial additional contacts between the Treasury Department and senior White House officials concerning RTC matters.  In view of the totality of the White House's involvement in defending the Clintons' private interests in this period, the impropriety of these contacts can no longer be seriously debated.  The Special Committee concludes that the contacts were improper, wrong and never should have occurred.  In reaching this conclusion, the Special Committee places particular weight on the fact that as of the time of these additional contacts, the White House participants were members of the Whitewater Response Team and had discussed the concern that the investigators might pressure Clinton associates into cooperating.  
<P>At a February 2 meeting, Deputy Treasury Secretary and Acting RTC CEO Roger Altman briefed key members of the Whitewater Response Team, who, by then, were in regular contact with the Clintons' private counsel on the status of the RTC's investigation into civil claims against the Clintons.  Specifically, Mr. Altman provided the critical confidential information that the RTC investigation probably would not be finished prior to the expiration of the statute of limitations.  Armed with this inside information, the Clintons could safely reject any RTC request for a tolling agreement.
<P>Also on February 2, having been told that the RTC would have to decide quickly, and with very incomplete information whether to bring civil claims against the Clintons, senior White House officials pressured Mr. Altman, a friend of the President, not to recuse himself.  The White House feared that RTC General Counsel Ellen Kulka would be too tough and unreasonable.  She could not be controlled, and the stakes were too high.  Ultimately, Mr. Altman gave in to the pressure; his so-called "de facto" recusal was no recusal at all.  
<P>The Special Committee concludes that this February 2 meeting is indefensible.  It never should have occurred.  At the time, Mr. Nussbaum had functioned as a critical part of the Whitewater Response Team.  He worked with private counsel for the Clintons.  He was no longer in a position to provide dispassionate policy advice to Mr. Altman about recusal.  Ironically, at this point, Mr. Nussbaum's conflict exceeded that of Mr. Altman.  The Special Committee notes that RTC General Counsel Ellen Kulka, when asked to provide confidential information to Mr. Kendall, strongly objected.(63)  At that time, senior White House officials failed to advise Ms. Kulka that they were already engaged in joint defense efforts with Mr. Kendall.
<P>  The importance to the White House of keeping the friendly Mr. Altman in the loop on the Madison case is illuminated by the mysterious discovery of the Rose Law Firm billing records in the Book Room of the White House Residence.  These records may explain why, as Mrs. Clinton's chief of staff, Margaret Williams, told Mr. Altman in early January 1994, "HRC was `paralyzed' by [Whitewater]."(64)  The records may also explain why Deputy White House Chief of Staff Ickes and the White House Counsel's office prepared a memorandum on the Rose Law Firm's and the Clintons' potential civil liability relating to the failure of Madison.
<P>The billing records indicate that Mrs. Clinton -- contrary to her previous statements -- represented Mr. McDougal's S&L in connection with the Castle Grande project, which federal regulators have criticized as a series of sham land sales and insider transactions.(65)  In fact, after reviewing the records, former Madison chief loan officer, Harry Don Denton, recently told the federal investigators that he warned Mrs. Clinton in 1986 that loan transactions she was handling involving the Castle Grande project could be irregular, but he said she "summarily dismissed" his concern.(66)
8.<P>Jay Stephens was removed from the investigation of possible civil claims against parties associated with Madison Guaranty, including the Clintons.
<P>Early in February 1994, the RTC retained the law firm of Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro, ("Pillsbury") including former Republican U.S. Attorney Jay Stephens, to investigate possible civil actions against parties associated with Madison Guaranty.  
<P>On February 25, 1994, George Stephanopoulos, Senior Advisor to the President, and Josh Steiner, Chief of Staff to Secretary of the Treasury Lloyd Bentsen, discussed the RTC's decision to hire Mr. Stephens.(67)  Mr. Steiner testified that Mr. Stephanopoulos was "angry" and thought that Mr. Stephens should be disqualified from handling the matter because he had been a critic of the Clinton administration.(68)
<P>Treasury Department General Counsel Jean Hanson recalled that during one conversation Mr. Steiner told her: "Do you believe those guys?  They want to see if they can get rid of Jay Stephens."  Ms. Hanson understood that "those guys" referred to various White House officials.(69)  Ms. Hanson further testified that on a separate occasion Mr. Steiner, himself, expressed the opinion that Ms. Kulka should be fired for hiring Mr. Stephens.(70)  Moreover, Mr. Steiner wrote in his diary about his conversation with Mr. Stephanopoulos:
<P>Simply outrageous that RTC had hired him [Stephens], but even more amazing when George then suggested to me that we needed to find a way to get rid of him.  Persuaded George that firing him would be incredibly stupid and improper.(71)

<P>In hearings before the Senate Banking Committee, Mr. Steiner implausibly claimed that he lied in his diary.(72)  In the weeks following this contact, Mr. Stephens' role in the civil investigation of Madison Guaranty came to a halt.  The White House succeeded in what Mr. Steiner described as being "incredibly stupid and improper."(73)
<P>Mr. Stephens' name was included in Pillsbury's initial proposal to the RTC as one of the three partners in charge of the matter.(74)  And during the early stages of the investigation in February 1994, Mr. Stephens attended meetings and was in daily contact with the RTC.(75) After press reports about Mr. Steiner's conversation with Mr. Stephanopoulos appeared in the third week of March 1994, however, Mr. Stephens' role "diminished substantially," and by the summer of 1994, he was "virtually disengaged from the matter."(76)  Mr. Stephens had no involvement in drafting the Pillsbury reports.(77)  He declined the RTC's request that he place his imprimatur on the final reports.  Curiously, the RTC subsequently refused to authorize Pillsbury to correct the public misconception that Mr. Stephens authored these reports.
<P>Although the RTC ultimately concluded that it would not be cost effective to bring civil claims against the Clintons or Mrs. Clinton's law firm, the RTC was left to rely upon Pillsbury's incomplete analyses.  In fact, Mr. Stephens himself was critical of the initial draft of the Pillsbury's report on Whitewater, and his criticisms were ignored.
9.<P>Senior RTC officials sought to impede the criminal investigation of Madison.
<P>In March 1992, RTC criminal investigators based in Kansas City commenced an investigation into the failed Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan.  The RTC subsequently produced 10 criminal referrals related to Madison, one in 1992 and nine in 1993.  The lead criminal investigator on the case was Jean Lewis.  Ms. Lewis and her two supervisors, Richard Iorio and Lee Ausen, signed all 10 referrals.
<P>The Special Committee concludes that the Kansas City RTC investigators were obstructed in their investigation and were forced to contend with an environment hostile to their inquiry.  Ms. Lewis, testified that she "believe[d] there was a concerted effort to obstruct, hamper and manipulate the results of our investigation of Madison."(78)  The evidence suggests that Ms. Lewis' belief was well founded.
<P>The submission of the nine 1993 referrals to the Justice Department was delayed when attorneys in the RTC Professional Liability Section ("PLS") demanded time to perform a "legal review of them."  During the week long delay that ensued, the White House learned about the referrals and some of the confidential information they contained.  Shortly after this event, Ms. Lewis was removed as the lead criminal investigator on the Madison Guaranty case at the urging of PLS.   
<P>On August 15, 1994, the three Madison investigators were placed on "administrative leave" by RTC upper management.(79)  The three were provided with no warning or explanation whatsoever for this action.  Two weeks later, the three investigators were told to return to work.
<P>The Special Committee concludes that the most plausible explanation for this action is that it was taken in retaliation for the investigators' work on the Madison Guaranty case.  An internal investigation by the Inspector General of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") (the successor to the RTC) is ongoing.
<P>The Special Committee also concludes that April Breslaw improperly intervened in, and attempted to affect, the outcome of investigations into Madison Guaranty.
<P>In 1989, Ms. Breslaw while an attorney with the FDIC hired the Rose Law Firm to handle a malpractice suit against Madison Guaranty's former accountants.  Her decision came under fire when it was reported that Rose's representation of the government was fraught with conflicts of interest.  By 1994, both the FDIC and the RTC had commenced investigations into the Rose conflicts issue.  That year, Ms. Breslaw sought to discourage RTC employees from investigating issues related to Madison Guaranty and informed RTC investigators that senior RTC officials would prefer a certain outcome to any such investigation. 
<P>In January 1994, Ms. Breslaw warned RTC civil fraud investigator Gary Davidson that certain RTC managers would take "dim view" of him investigation Madison.  Then, in February 1994, Ms. Breslaw told Ms. Lewis in a tape recorded conversation that the "head people" at the RTC "would like to be able to say Whitewater did not cause a loss to Madison."(80)  
<P>Ms. Breslaw's testimony before the Special Committee regarding her statement to Ms. Lewis was wholly incredible.  Ms. Breslaw refused to admit that she had said the comment attributed to her and implausibly claimed that she could not recognize her own voice on the tape.
<P>It is unclear who, if anyone, instructed Ms. Breslaw to "send these messages" to the RTC investigators working on the Madison Guaranty and Rose Law Firm matters, although the telephone message pads of Webster Hubbell indicate that Ms. Breslaw and Mr. Hubbell were in contact on or about September 29, 1993.  Both Mr. Hubbell and Ms. Breslaw admit that they spoke about the investigation into the Rose Law Firm conflicts of interest relating to Madison.  They deny, however, that they discussed the "substance" of the RTC investigations.
<P>Viewed cumulatively, the Special Committee concludes that Ms. Breslaw's actions, coupled with the improper actions taken toward the RTC investigators, illustrate a concerted effort to improperly obstruct the investigations relating to Madison Guaranty and Whitewater.
10.<P>U.S. Attorney Paula Casey mishandled the RTC criminal referral referencing the President and Mrs. Clinton.
<P>The first criminal referral, Referral No. C0004, was made to Charles Banks, then U.S. Attorney, in September 1992.  Mr. Banks did not take action on the referral, but on January 27, 1993, he sent a recusal letter to the Executive Office of U.S. Attorneys, to which he never received a response.(81)  Although a decision on a criminal referral is usually issued within 60-90 days after submission, the U.S. Attorney's Office did not render a prosecutorial opinion on Referral C0004 until October 27, 1993 -- over one year after its submission.(82)
<P>Senior Justice Department officials believed that Paula Casey, Mr. Banks' successor and a former student of President Clinton, should have recused herself because of her ties to the Clintons and to Governor Jim Guy Tucker.  They communicated this view to her on several occasions.  The director and agents of the FBI similarly expressed concern that U.S. Attorney Casey should recuse herself from Madison-related matters.
<P>Moreover, contrary to Justice Department policy, Ms. Casey did not notify Main Justice with an Urgent Memorandum when she learned that the case against David Hale might involve allegations against Governor Tucker and President Clinton.  Senior officials were "surprised" that Ms. Casey had not alerted Main Justice to Mr. Hale's allegations about the President, and believed that Main Justice should have been involved in the case sooner.(83)
<P>Even after agreeing to recuse herself, Ms. Casey continued to participate actively in the Hale and Madison investigations.  She attended FBI briefings involving the investigation of Madison Guaranty and Mr. Hale.(84)  She continued to correspond with Mr. Hale's attorney about a possible plea agreement and reject the efforts of Mr. Hale to negotiate with the government.  Sometime between the middle and the end of October, she reviewed the nine new RTC criminal referrals relating to Madison Guaranty.(85)
<P>Finally, for reasons unknown, Ms. Casey formally declined prosecution on Referral C0004, even though she claimed that she already knew that she was going to recuse herself.  Justice Department officials testified that this declination was a "substantive decision" that someone who supposedly had recused herself from the matter should not have made.(86)
<P>No one in charge of handling Referral C0004 in the U.S. Attorney's office in Little Rock ever reviewed or analyzed the hundreds of pages of documentary exhibits attached to it.  Indeed, neither Ms. Casey nor her First Assistant ever reviewed the exhibits to the referral prior to declining prosecution.(87)  Senior Justice Department officials testified that Ms. Casey should have conducted an independent review of the evidence prior to declining Referral C0004.
<P>Even after his recusal from the case in November 1993,(88) Associate Attorney General Webster Hubbell, a close associate of the Clintons and now a convicted felon, possessed -- in his basement -- the Clintons' personal and campaign files on Whitewater, as well as Rose Law Firm client files on Madison that he improperly took from the firm.  He was involved in the review and transfer of those files to the Clintons' personal attorney in November and December 1993.(89)  Although Mr. Hubbell was in virtually daily contact with senior White House officials, he implausibly claimed that he was kept out of the loop on the Whitewater defense effort.
<P>The Special Counsel and then Office of the Independent Counsel took over responsibility for the investigations in 1994.  The work of the Independent Counsel is ongoing, and therefore, it is unknown whether the actions of the U.S. Attorney's Office or Ms. Casey ultimately tainted the investigations in any way.  The Special Committee concludes, however, that the U.S. Attorney's Office mishandled the RTC criminal referrals and the Hale plea negotiations.
11.<P>Senior Administration officials improperly sought to manipulate the investigation of the RTC and Treasury Inspectors General into the propriety of White House-Treasury contacts.
<P>During its hearings in the summer of 1994, the Banking Committee learned that the Treasury Inspector General ("IG") furnished to the White House -- at the White House's request and a full week before the Office of Government Ethics ("OGE") opinion was publicly released -- transcripts of all depositions conducted by the RTC and Treasury IGs in the course of their investigation into the propriety of White House-Treasury contacts.
<P>The Special Committee concludes that senior Administration officials improperly sought to manipulate this investigation of the Treasury and RTC IGs.  This interference is particularly troubling given that the Treasury and RTC IGs were investigating the Administration's efforts to interfere in the underlying Whitewater/Madison investigation.
<P>Despite the fact that Department of Treasury General Counsel Jean Hanson was a subject of investigation, Francine Kerner, a member of the General Counsel's office, provided advance copies of the investigation transcripts to Ms. Hanson's staff.  The transcripts were then disseminated to other senior Treasury Department officials.(90)  The transcripts contained confidential information about RTC criminal investigations and referrals that even Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen should not have been permitted to review.  RTC IG John Adair testified that the transcripts contained 90% of the substance of the criminal referrals.(91)  
<P>Ms. Kerner also provided Ms. Hanson's staff with draft copies of the RTC-IG's conclusions and asked Ms. Hanson's staff to edit the proposed OGE report.(92)  The Treasury IG's chief investigator, James Cottos, objected to Ms. Kerner's attempts to alter the draft investigative report.  He told Ms. Kerner "we were not the Jean Hanson defense team."  In addition, according to Mr. Cottos, "I felt they were slanting the facts or attempting to slant the facts."(93)  Clark Blight, the chief investigator for the RTC IG, similarly testified that he was under the impression that Ms. Kerner was "an advocate for the White House."(94)  
<P>The Special Committee is deeply concerned that Treasury Department officials caused the transfer of confidential transcripts of investigative depositions to the White House.  This disturbing action was taken without the knowledge or consent of the RTC IG.  In fact, members of the RTC IG's office had voiced their opposition to such a transfer when the idea was raised.  When they learned of the transfer, after the fact, they were "shocked" by the communication of this confidential information to the White House.(95)
<P>During the Banking Committee's hearings, senior White House officials relied repeatedly on the OGE opinion as evidence that White House personnel had not engaged in improper conduct.(96)  The Special Committee discovered that this reliance was entirely misplaced.
<P>In particular, Stephen Potts, Director of OGE, testified that, contrary to statements made by White House Special Counsel Lloyd Cutler to the Banking Committee in August 1994, the OGE did not "informally concur" in Mr. Cutler's conclusion that White House officials did not violate ethical standards with regard to the communication of confidential RTC information from the Treasury Department to the White House.(97)
<P>Mr. Cutler admitted to the Special Committee that he may have "transgressed" and "may have gone too far when he testified" before the Banking Committee in August 1994. (98)   12.<P>The White House delayed in producing documents to the Special Committee.
<P>The Special Committee confronted a number of obstacles that hindered the progress of its investigation.  Among the most notable, certainly the most time-consuming, of these obstacles were (1) the withholding and delay in the production of documents directly relevant to the Committee's investigation and the noncooperation and resistance of a number of witnesses.
<P>Because the testimony of witnesses before the Special Committee was often contradictory as to important events and actions, the Special Committee placed particular emphasis on available documentary evidence.  Unfortunately, throughout the course of its inquiry, the Special Committee had been hindered by parties unduly delaying the production of, or withholding outright, documents critical to its investigation.
<P>The White House did not live up to its repeated promise to cooperate with the Special Committee's investigation into Whitewater, Madison Guaranty and related matters.  The White House and various individuals associated with the White House engaged in a pattern of activity designed to hinder the Special Committee's investigation.   
<P>The White House withheld documents from the Special Committee or produced highly relevant documents very late in the Committee's investigation.  For example, the White House failed to produce until January and February 1996 various notes taken by high level White House officials relating to the January 1994 Whitewater Response Team meetings.
<P>On January 29, 1996 the White House produced the notes of former White House Director of Communications Mark Gearan,(99) and claimed that the notes "were inadvertently moved to the Peace Corps with other personal effects in boxes."(100)  On February 13, 1996, the White House produced the documents from the files of Mr. Waldman, Special Assistant to the President that Mr. Waldman discovered these documents in his office in a file marked "WWDC", Whitewater Development Corporation, in the course of an office move.(101)  Then, on February 20, 1996 the Special Committee received memoranda from the White House which were prepared by Harold Ickes, White House Deputy Chief of Staff and the leader of the Whitewater Response Team meetings.  The White House represented that some were "mistakenly overlooked."(102)  Finally, on March 1, 1996, lawyers for Deputy White House Counsel Bruce Lindsey "which inadvertently were not produced" previously.(103)
<P>The White House withheld notes of the November 5, 1993 meeting of White House officials and the Clintons' private attorneys relating to Whitewater taken by Associate Counsel William Kennedy.  Although President Clinton had made numerous statements that he would not claim executive privilege for matters relating to Whitewater, the White House withheld these notes based on an assertion of "the attorney-client component of executive privilege."  On December 20, 1995, the full Senate adopted Senate Resolution 199, directing the Senate Legal Counsel to initiate a civil action in federal District Court under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1365 (1994).  On December 22, 1995, before the Senate Legal Counsel initiated such action, the White House reversed its position, and Mr. Kennedy produced his notes to the Special Committee.  The notes turned out to be highly relevant to the Special Committee's investigation.  They provided evidence that the White House Counsel's office and the Clintons' private attorneys had joined forces and clearly were working as agents of the private counsel in a joint and wholly improper  effort to serve the private interests of the Clintons.
13.<P>Senior Administration officials provided inaccurate and incomplete testimony to the Senate.
<P>The Special Committee concludes that senior Administration officials provided inaccurate and incomplete testimony to the Senate on a number of occasions.
<P>Most notably, Roger Altman, former Deputy Treasury Secretary and Acting CEO of the RTC, intentionally misled the Senate when he testified before the Banking Committee on February 24, 1994.  Mr. Altman was specifically asked about contacts with the White House and whether the RTC briefed the White House about the criminal referrals.  Mr. Altman's response was that there was only one substantive contact, and that it dealt with the procedure relating to the expiring statute of limitations.  As detailed in the Banking Committee's report on Treasury-White House contacts, he failed to mention his other communications with the White House.(104)
<P>In addition, as set forth in the discussion of Foster Phase of its inquiry, the Special Committee believes that other senior Administration officials provided inaccurate and incomplete testimony to the Senate.
<P>With respect to matters bearing upon the Washington Phase of the Committee's inquiry, the Special Committee believes that Deputy White House Chief of Staff Harold Ickes repeatedly provided inaccurate and incomplete testimony. 
<P>Mr. Ickes testified under oath to the Senate and to the Inspectors General of the Treasury Department and the RTC that he and other White House officials had no discussions about, or knowledge of, the statute of limitations for Madison-related civil claims prior to February 2, 1994.  In light of newly discovered evidence, the Special Committee believes that this testimony was inaccurate.
<P>In January 1994, considerable public interest existed in issues relating to Whitewater and Madison.  The statute of limitations for Madison-related civil claims involving fraud or intentional misconduct was scheduled to expire on February 28, 1994.  There was considerable congressional attention focused on the approaching expiration date.  Prior to enactment of the law extending the statute of limitations, however, the RTC had to decide by February 28, 1994, whether to bring suit, to seek tolling agreements, or to allow the statute to expire without action.  Because President and Mrs. Clinton faced potential liability relating to the failure of Madison, inside information regarding the status of the RTC investigation and its deliberations with respect to the statute of limitations was valuable to the White House and the Clintons in coordinating a defense strategy.
<P>During its 1994 investigation, counsel to the Banking Committee asked Mr. Ickes about his knowledge of issues surrounding the statute of limitations prior to its extension.(105)  Specifically, Mr. Ickes testified about a meeting on February 2, 1994, between senior White House officials and Roger Altman, then Deputy Secretary of the Treasury and Acting Chief Executive Officer of the RTC, and Jean Hanson, General Counsel to the Department of the Treasury.  With respect to discussions about the statute of limitations at that meeting, Mr. Ickes testified, "I, for one, had little knowledge, if any knowledge, about the situation,"(106)  and that "all this was new to me."(107)33  
<P>Evidence newly uncovered by the Special Committee, however, strongly suggests that these statements were untrue when Mr. Ickes made them under oath.  The evidence indicates that Mr. Ickes specifically assigned a subordinate to prepare, and later received, a memorandum on the statute of limitations for Madison-related civil claims and that he discussed the issue with other White House officials in January 1994, prior to the February 2 meeting with Mr. Altman and Ms. Hanson.
<P>On November 2, 1995, for example, the White House produced to the Special Committee a memorandum to Mr. Ickes from Associate Counsel to the President Neil Eggleston entitled "Statute of Limitations in Actions Brought by the Conservators of a Financial Institution."(108)  The memorandum, which was dated January 17, 1994, discussed the statute of limitations generally applicable to claims filed by the RTC on behalf of failed thrift institutions.  More important, Mr. Eggleston's memorandum discussed the statute of limitations as applied specifically to Madison and identified March 2, 1994, as the final date for the RTC to file civil tort claims on behalf of Madison, the type of action usually brought against outsiders in financial institution cases.(109)  
<P>Beyond this, the Special Committee believes that Mr. Ickes provided inaccurate testimony under oath about Mrs. Clinton's knowledge in 1994 of her potential liability to the RTC arising from her representation of Madison.  Mr. Ickes testified under oath to the Senate Banking Committee in July and August 1994 that he did not know whether two memoranda detailing the potential liability of the President and Mrs. Clinton to the RTC had been sent to Mrs. Clinton.  However, the Special Committee has discovered evidence indicating that, at about the same time of Mr. Ickes' testimony, his attorney transmitted information to the White House Counsel's Office that Mr. Ickes had specifically remembered sending the memoranda to Mrs. Clinton in response to repeated questions from the Clintons about their possible exposure in the RTC investigation.  The foregoing, to be sure, do not exhaust the instances in which the Committee believes that Mr. Ickes was less than candid, but it amply demonstrates that Mr. Ickes provided inaccurate and incomplete testimony to the Senate.
14.<P>The Office of the White House Counsel was frequently and improperly put in the service of the personal legal interests of the President and Mrs. Clinton.

<P>The Special Committee concludes that the use of the White House Counsel's Office to serve the private legal interests of the President and Mrs. Clinton was highly improper.  As government lawyers, the attorneys in the White House Counsel's Office have a duty to represent the public interest.  That duty is incompatible with the representation of any private parties -- even the President or First Lady.  Here, the interest of the United States with respect to these investigations in establishing civil and/or criminal liability was potentially adverse to the private interests of the Clintons in avoiding any such liability.
<P>The provision of legal services by government lawyers relating to the President's personal matters is contrary to the "Standards of Ethical Conduct" promulgated by the Office of Government Ethics ("OGE").  The Standards of Ethical Conduct, which were issued pursuant to Executive Order 12674 and apply to all Executive Branch employees, establish that it is a misuse of government position to make "[u]se of public office for private gain."(110)   More specifically, a government employee "shall not use his public office for his own private gain, . . . or for the private gain of friends, relatives, or persons with whom the employee is affiliated in a nongovernmental capacity."(111)
<P>The underlying issues related to Whitewater and Madison arose prior to the inauguration of President Clinton.  The only Whitewater issues arising after the inauguration of the President involve the improper contacts between the White House and various other government agencies that were investigating Madison and Whitewater, including the Treasury Department, the RTC, and the SBA.  If such contacts had not taken place, there would be no investigation into events occurring after the President's inauguration.  The Office of the White House Counsel cannot bootstrap its improper handling of information about Whitewater and Madison into a justification for its participation in underlying Whitewater matters.
<P>When he was appointed Special Counsel to the President by President Clinton, Lloyd Cutler explained the proper sphere of the White House Counsel's representation of the President:  "When it comes to a President's private affairs, particularly private affairs that occurred before he took office, those should be handled by his own personal private counsel, and in my view not by the White House Counsel."(112)  
<P>The attempt of White House lawyers to obtain information and to communicate with witnesses is inconsistent with the need to maintain both the perceived or actual integrity of the ongoing federal investigations into Whitewater.  It is also contrary to the OGE's Standards of Ethical Conduct for a public employee to misuse nonpublic information.(113)  Finally, it contravenes a regulation promulgated by the Executive Office of the President, which provides:  "For the purpose of furthering a private interest, an employee shall not . . . directly or indirectly, use, or allow the use of, official information obtained through or in connection with his Government employment which has not been made available to the general public."(114)
<P>In sum, the Special Committee concludes that White House officials, in particular the Office of the White House Counsel, violated ethical standards and abused their official positions of public trust to assist in the Clintons' private legal defense effort.  The Special Committee recommends that steps be taken to prevent such future abuses.

   <H3>  CONCLUSIONS OF THE SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON THE
     DISCOVERY OF THE ROSE LAW FIRM BILLING RECORDS</H3>
     On January 5, 1996, the Special Committee received computer printouts of the Rose Law Firm's billings to Madison Guaranty.  These records were discovered under mysterious circumstances in the Book Room of the White House Residence. 
<P>The billing records constitute the best, and therefore most important, evidence concerning Mrs. Clinton's representation of Mr. McDougal's S&L in the mid-1980s--a relationship that was being investigated by at least three separate federal agencies. The records had been subject to several different federal subpoenas, besides that of the Special Committee, for nearly two years.  When federal investigators served their subpoenas, some more than two years ago, the billing records were nowhere to be found.  Despite extensive searches conducted by the Rose Law Firm, neither the originals nor copies were discovered.(115)  They were not in the firm's computers, its client files, or its storage facility.(116)
1.<P>The Rose billing records provide the best evidence of the legal services performed by Mrs. Clinton for Madison Guaranty.
<P>The billing records provide the best evidence of the legal services performed by Mrs. Clinton for Madison Guaranty and, as a result of the failed memories of many Rose Law Firm attorneys, are the only source of detailed information about the services that the Rose Law Firm provided to Madison Guaranty.  The computerized billing records are thus an invaluable asset in reconstructing Mrs. Clinton's actual involvement in the matter.  In total, Mrs. Clinton billed Madison Guaranty for 89 tasks, including 33 conferences with Madison Guaranty officials, on 53 separate days.(117)
<P>Among the significant facts established by the billing records are the following, the significance of which are discussed more fully in the Special Committee's conclusions regarding the Arkansas Phase of its investigation:
<P>*<P>Mrs. Clinton, and others on her behalf, repeatedly made statements that Richard Massey brought in Madison Guaranty as a client and, even though she was the billing partner on the matter, she was merely a "backstop" because the firm did not permit associates to bill clients directly.(118)  Mr. Massey, however, directly contradicted Mrs. Clinton's account in sworn testimony before the Special Committee.  The president of the S&L, John Latham, and a partner at the Rose law firm, David Knight, also contradicted Mrs. Clinton's account.
<P>The billing records substantially resolve this dispute in favor of the testimony of Messrs. Massey, Latham and Knight.
<P>*<P>During the 1992 campaign, allegations surfaced that Beverly Bassett Schaffer, who Governor Clinton appointed as Arkansas Securities Commissioner, gave preferential treatment to Madison Guaranty because of her relationship with the Governor and Mrs. Clinton.  The Clinton campaign denied that Mrs. Clinton attempted to influence Commissioner Bassett.  
<P>The billing records show that Mrs. Clinton called Ms. Schaffer the day before the Rose Law Firm submitted Madison's proposal for its preferred stock offering to the Arkansas Securities Department.(119)  The records reflect that Mrs. Clinton billed as much as one hour to the call.(120)  Ms. Schaffer notified Mrs. Clinton of the approval of the proposal two weeks later in a letter addressed, "Dear Hillary."(121)
<P>In testimony before the Special Committee, former Commissioner Schaffer directly contradicted Mrs. Clinton and stated that the proposal was discussed during the telephone call.  Mr. Massey similarly disputed Mrs. Clinton's account for the telephone call to Ms. Schaffer.(122)
<P>*<P>Mrs. Clinton has minimized her role in the Rose Law Firm's representation of Madison before the Arkansas Securities Department in connection with Madison's proposed stock offering.  The billing records and Mr. Massey's testimony directly contradict Mrs. Clinton's claim that her role on the matter was merely to serve as a "backstop."  
<P>The billing records show that Mrs. Clinton billed Madison for a total of approximately 60 hours of work.  Mrs. Clinton billed 6.2 hours on the preferred stock deal for conferences alone that she had with Mr. McDougal, with Mr. Latham and Davis Fitzhugh, two other Madison S&L officers involved in the stock offering.(123)  
<P>Mrs. Clinton had at least six conferences with Mr. Massey, the young Rose Law Firm attorney responsible for performing the associate type tasks on the matter.(124)  Mrs. Clinton also reviewed the amendments to the application submitted to the Arkansas Securities Department.(125)  Mr. Massey testified that he did his work under the supervision of Mrs. Clinton.(126)  According to Mr. Massey: "Mrs. Clinton was the billing attorney and had a relationship with me such that she needed to know what I was doing so she could be prepared to update the client at any time."(127)  When asked whether Mrs. Clinton's work on the stock proposal deal was "minimal," Mr. Massey responded, "In my own mind it's a significant amount of time."(128)
<P>*<P>The billing records indicate that Mrs. Clinton's involvement in Castle Grande was much more extensive than she has thus far owned up to.  Before the billing records were discovered, little was known about the nature of the Rose Law Firm's representation of Madison Guaranty in connection with the Castle Grande land transaction.  Perhaps because Mrs. Clinton had ordered the destruction of Madison-related records in 1988, the Rose Law Firm no longer possessed any file related to the Castle Grande deal.
<P>Federal investigators described the Castle Grande transactions as a series of land flips and transactions that cost the American taxpayers $4 million.(129)  In 1995, when the RTC asked about her knowledge of Castle Grande, Mrs. Clinton stated "I do not believe I knew anything about any of these real estate parcels and projects." (130)
<P>The billing records identify Mrs. Clinton as the billing partner on the matter--even though Mrs. Clinton claimed that she has no idea how the Rose Law Firm became involved in the matter.(131)  These records indicate that Mrs. Clinton billed more time on the Castle Grande matter--29.5 hours, or 54 percent of total billings on the matter--than any other lawyer at the Rose Law Firm.  Indeed, nearly half of Mrs. Clinton's total billings to Madison were for work on Castle Grande.  In the months following the initial transaction, Mrs. Clinton had at least 12 conferences with Mr. Ward and numerous meetings with Madison officials in connection with the subsequent sales that she billed to the IDC/Castle Grande matter.
<P>*<P>More important, the billing records were perhaps most illuminating with respect to the nature of Mrs. Clinton's work on Castle Grande.  For his role as the "straw man" and other related services to the project, Mr. Ward was owed a commission.  On March 31, 1986, Madison Guaranty loaned Mr. Ward $400,000.(132)  One week later, on April 7, 1986, Madison Financial executed two promissory notes, for $300,000 and $70,943, purporting to reflect loans from Mr. Ward to Madison Financial Corporation, Madison Guaranty's subsidiary service corporation.(133)  At about this time, bank examiners were scrutinizing Madison Guaranty's books.  Mr. James Clark, the chief examiner, asked whether the three notes were related.(134)  He was assured by a Madison Guaranty official, probably Don Denton, that the notes were not related.(135)  In fact, according to Madison official John Latham, the three notes were related, and the $400,000 March 31 loan from Madison Guaranty was intended to pay Mr. Ward's commissions.(136)
<P>The Rose Law Firm billing records revealed that on April 7, 1986, the day the Madison Financial notes were executed, Mrs. Clinton billed 12 minutes to the IDC/Castle Grande matter for "Telephone conference with Don Denton."(137)  A message slip produced by Mr. Denton reflects that Mrs. Clinton called him from the Rose Law Firm on April 7, 1986.(138) On a June 11, 1996 interview with FDIC investigators, Mr. Denton stated that Mrs. Clinton called seeking copies of the notes between Mr. Ward, Madison Financial, and Madison Guaranty.(139)  Mr. Denton told investigators that during the conversation he cautioned Mrs. Clinton that a problem might exist with respect to the April 7 notes to Mr. Ward because "they constituted in effect a parent entity fulfilling the obligation of a subsidiary,"(140) a violation of the so-called direct investment rule.  Mrs. Clinton, however, "summarily dismissed" that concern in a way that he took to mean that "he would take care of savings and loan matters, and she would take care of legal matters."(141)
<P>And she did.  The billing records showed that on May 1, 1986, Mrs. Clinton billed Madison Guaranty for two hours of time for the following work: "Conference with Seth Ward; telephone conference with Seth Ward regarding option; telephone conference with Mike Shauffler; prepare option."(142)  Indeed, a May 1 option agreement between Mr. Ward and Madison Financial bore a word processing code ("0190g") that, according to the Rose Law Firm's counsel, indicates the document was created at the Rose Law Firm by or for Mrs. Clinton.(143)  
<P>Mr. Clark, the bank examiner told investigators that, after reviewing the records and in light of Mr. Denton' testimony, he believed that the May 1 option prepared by Mrs. Clinton "was created `in order to conceal the connection--whatever it was--between'" the March 31 and April 7 notes.(144)
<P>On June 13, 1996, the Special Committee requested that the First Lady attempt to refresh her recollection regarding the matters discussed by Mr. Denton and to inform the Committee of what she recalls about them.(145)  On June 17, 1996 the Special Committee received an affidavit from Mrs. Clinton accompanied by a letter from Mr. Kendall.  In the affidavit, Mrs. Clinton gave no answer to the question posed by the Special Committee; instead, she simply referred to Mr. Kendall's letter "addressing certain allegations recently made by Mr. Don Denton."(146)  In his letter, Mr. Kendall maintained that Mr. Denton's recollection is "wholly unreliable"34  but gave no indication as to the recollection of the First Lady.(147)  The First Lady therefore has neither confirmed nor denied Mr. Denton's testimony.  
<P>The significance of the billing records as they relate to Castle Grande is perhaps best illustrated by the activities of Mrs. Clinton's legal defense team immediately after the discovery of the records.  A message slip from John Tisdale, the Clintons' Arkansas lawyer to Alston Jennings, Seth Ward's former attorney on Castle Grande, indicate that, on June 5, 1996, the day after Ms. Huber discovered the records in her White House office, Mr. Kendall called Mr. Tisdale and Mr. Jennings to arrange a meeting.(148)  One week after the records were discovered, on January 11, 1996, Mr. Kendall flew to Little Rock and met first with Mr. Jennings and then with Mr. Ward.(149)  The meeting with Mr. Ward lasted 30-40 minutes.(150)  Curiously, Mr. Kendall had also contacted Mr. Jennings in August 1995.  Subsequent to that contact, Mrs. Clinton summoned Mr. Jennings to the White House for a personal meeting on August 10, 1995, around the time that the billing records were placed in the Book Room of the White House residence.
2.<P>The disappearance and mysterious reappearance of the Rose Law Firm billing records was part of a larger pattern of removal, concealment and, at times, destruction of records concerning Mrs. Clinton's representation of Madison.
<P>The mysterious discovery of the Rose billing records must be viewed in the context of the destruction and mishandling of other Rose Law Firm files concerning Madison between 1988 and 1992.  In 1988, Mrs. Clinton ordered the Rose Law Firm to destroy records relating to her representation of Mr. McDougal's Madison S&L.(151)  As described above, this was not a routine destruction of records because there was pending litigation relating to Castle Grande and federal regulators were investigating the operation and solvency of Madison in anticipation of taking over the troubled S&L. 
<P>The mishandling of Madison documents continued after the 1992 presidential campaign, when the firm's files on Madison, which were by now the property of the RTC as conservator of Madison, and files of other Rose clients for whom Mrs. Clinton had performed legal services, were secretly removed from the firm by another then-Rose Law Firm partner, Webster Hubbell.  Mr. Hubbell removed these files, at times taking the firm's only copies,(152) without obtaining the consent of the firm or the client.(153)
3.<P>Vincent Foster is the last person known to have the billing records in his possession.
<P>During the 1992 presidential campaign, on February 12, 1992, an unknown person printed out a set of the Rose Law Firm's computerized records of billings to Madison Guaranty.(154)  Mr. Hubbell asserted that either he or former Deputy White House Counsel Vincent Foster, also a Rose partner, directed the Rose accounting department to print the billing records for Madison.(155)  In addition to obtaining the computerized billing records, Mr. Hubbell also retrieved other files and documents relating to Mrs. Clinton's work for Madison.
<P>According to Mr. Hubbell, Mr. Foster was the last person he saw handling the billing records.(156)  Mr. Hubbell did not know who removed the records from the Rose Law Firm,(157) or how they came to be left in the White House Residence.(158)  He claimed not to have spoken with anyone about the billing records since the 1992 presidential campaign.(159)
4.<P>The billing records mysteriously reappear in the Book Room of the White House Residence in August 1995.
<P>During the first two weeks of August 1995, Carolyn Huber, Special Assistant to the President and Special Director of Correspondence for the White House, saw the Rose Law Firm billing records for the first time.(160)  The billing records were in the Book Room, a small room on the third floor of the First Family's private quarters in the White House Residence.(161)
<P>In early August 1995, Ms. Huber was gathering newspaper and magazine clippings in the Book Room when she noticed the records in clear view on the edge of a table.(162)  The records were folded in half, and Ms. Huber recognized the records, from her experience at the Rose Law Firm, to be billing records.(163)
<P>For several months, Ms. Huber gave little thought to the records, which were moved in a box to her office.  On the morning of January 4, 1996, Ms. Huber discovered the records when the table was removed that had concealed the box with the billing records for five months.(164)
<P>Immediately, Ms. Huber realized the billing records were related to Madison Guaranty.(165)  She was horrified because she understood their significance; she had seen several subpoenas calling for the production of Madison Guaranty records, including these very records.(166)
5.<P>Only a limited number of people had access to Book Room of the White House Residence.
<P>The Special Committee's inquiry discovered that only a limited number of people had access to the Book Room, and no one admitted to placing the billing records in the Book Room of the White House Residence.  Only a limited number of people had access.  Moreover, it is highly unlikely that those with access would be leaving or disturbing documents in that private area of the White House.
<P>  The Special Committee rejects as fanciful the suggestion that construction workers or residence staff were somehow responsible for leaving the records in the Book Room.  Similarly, the denials by overnight guests are highly credible because none of them would have been likely to be carrying records into the Book Room or to disturb materials in the Book Room.
<P>Accordingly, the Special Committee concludes that most persons with access to the Book Room during the relevant period truthfully denied leaving the Rose billing records in the Book Room.  They had neither the opportunity to possess the billing records nor the motive to conceal them from investigators for nearly two years.
6.<P>Very few people had motive to be handling or reading the Rose billing records in August 1995.
<P>Few lay people would have understood the significance or content of the Rose billing records in August 1995.  In fact, based on the evidence received by the Special Committee, only three people had previously shown an interest in and handled the billing records -- Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Foster and Mr. Hubbell.  Of these, Mr. Foster passed away on July 20, 1993, and Mr. Hubbell reported to federal prison on August 7, 1995.(167)
<P>Moreover, as discussed earlier in these Conclusions, the principal relevance of the billing records was to disclose the nature and extent of the legal work performed by Rose Law Firm partners for Madison Guaranty.  As noted above, these records were particularly significant in evaluating work done by Mrs. Clinton.  Again, this is an important factor in evaluating who would have had an interest in reviewing the records in August 1995.  Finally, the Committee is impressed by the fact that these records appeared on the table of the Book Room within days after the RTC-IG issued its report critical of the Rose Law Firm and its conflict of interest over Madison.  As evidenced by the memorandum of March 1, 1994 from Mr. Ickes to Mrs. Clinton, this particular issue was of concern to Mrs. Clinton in connection with her possible exposure to personal liability.
7.<P>Only a limited number of people were definitely within the chain of custody of the billing records.<P>
<P>Although the absence of fingerprints does not rule out that a person handled documents, the presence of fingerprints positively establishes that someone was in the chain of custody.  Of individuals positively within the chain of custody on these documents, only Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Foster are likely to have been interested in reading the billing records.  Indeed, in an affidavit submitted to the Special Committee on June 17, 1996, Mrs. Clinton stated:  "I recall discussing some of this legal work in 1992 with Mr. Vincent Foster and Mr. Webster Hubbell, as I sought to answer press questions about the Madison Guaranty representation during the Presidential Campaign.  Prior to the recent release of FBI fingerprint information, I had stated that I might have been shown billing records in 1992."(168)
8.<P>Mrs. Clinton is more likely than any other known individual to have placed the billing records in the Book Room in August 1995.
<P>The Special Committee is mindful that the question of possession of the long lost and much sought Rose billing records has grave legal implications.  Not surprisingly, no one has admitted to putting the documents in the Book Room.  On the current state of the record, the Special Committee cannot state with certainty who put the records in the Book Room.
<P>Nevertheless, the pattern of past behavior in handling documents, the limited number of persons with access to the Book Room, the question of motive, and the chain of custody evidence, taken together, suggest that very few people were likely to have placed the Rose billing records in the Book Room in August 1995.  With these factors in mind, the Special Committee concludes that Mrs. Clinton is more likely than any other known individual to have placed the records in the Book Room.  Certainly, Mrs. Clinton fits the above criteria most closely.35

<P><P><P><P>    <H2>  BACKGROUND</H2>
I.<P>Whitewater Development Corporation and Madison Guaranty S&L
<P>In August 1978, the Clintons and the McDougals purchased 230 acres of land in Marion County, Arkansas for $202,000 with the intention of dividing the land into lots and selling them for a profit.(169)  At the time, Mr. Clinton was the Attorney General of Arkansas, and Mrs. Clinton was a young associate with the Rose Law Firm of Little Rock.(170)  In June 1979, the Clintons and the McDougals formed Whitewater Development Corporation and subsequently transferred the land to the company.(171)  
<P>In October 1980, the year after Whitewater was formed, Mr. McDougal and others purchased a controlling interest in the Bank of Kingston, a small commercial bank located in Kingston, Arkansas,(172) and changed its name to Madison Bank and Trust.(173)  In January 1982, the McDougals purchased an interest in Woodruff County Savings and Loan, which they renamed Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan Association.(174)  Madison Guaranty thereafter formed a service corporation, Madison Financial Corporation, to facilitate Madison Guaranty's investment in real estate development projects.(175)  In November 1983, the McDougals obtained a controlling interest in Madison Guaranty.(176)
<P>Madison Guaranty's financial condition was poor when the McDougals purchased it and only became worse in later years.  In January 1984, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board ("FHLBB") commenced a special examination of Madison Guaranty that culminated in a supervisory agreement to which Madison's Board of Directors consented in July 1984.(177)  In October 1984, Mr. and Mrs. McDougal resigned as directors and officers of Madison Guaranty, but Mr. McDougal remained as Chairman and President of Madison Financial.(178)  Mr. McDougal, however, retained control of Madison Guaranty and maintained his office there.(179)
<P>In March 1986, the FHLBB began another examination of Madison Guaranty which revealed that the thrift's problems had grown worse.(180)  At a meeting in Dallas, Texas on July 11, 1986, the FHLBB instructed Madison Guaranty's Board of Directors to remove John Latham, the Chairman of Madison Guaranty, and Mr. McDougal from their positions at Madison Financial.(181)  The next month, the FHLBB entered a cease and desist order against the S&L.(182)  The FHLBB took over Madison Guaranty in February 1989 and, in November of that year, the RTC was appointed receiver.(183) 
<P>The failure of Madison Guaranty cost American taxpayers in excess of $60 million.  While Mr. McDougal was running Madison Guaranty between 1982-86, the Clintons made no payments toward the Whitewater debt.(184) 
<P>In 1992, the RTC began to investigate improper activities at Madison Guaranty and, on September 1, 1992, sent a criminal referral to the U.S. Attorney's office highlighting possible criminal violations.  The referral described "numerous questionable cash flow and 'loan' transactions" between Madison and a dozen companies owned or controlled by the McDougals, including Whitewater.(185)  The referral named, among others, the Clintons and future Arkansas Governor Jim Guy Tucker as persons who stood to benefit from, and as potential witnesses to, the suspected criminal activity.(186)
<P>The Clintons, in a pattern that would recur, received advance notice of the confidential RTC referral.  In late fall 1992, Betsey Wright, former chief of staff to Governor Clinton, learned of a "criminal referral regarding a savings and loan official in Arkansas and . . . involv[ing] the Clintons"(187) which had been sent "to the prosecutor in Little Rock."(188)  Upon learning the news, Ms. Wright told Mrs. Clinton about the referral.(189) It is with this knowledge of the confidential referral that the Clintons and their advisors came to Washington.
<P>By March 1993, senior Clinton Administration officials confirmed that the RTC had sent a criminal referral mentioning the Clintons to the Justice Department.(190)  Specifically, RTC Senior Vice President William H. Roelle, on or about March 23, 1993, told Roger Altman, then Deputy Treasury Secretary, of the RTC referral involving the Clintons.(191)  Mr. Altman immediately passed this important information on to White House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum.  On March 23, Mr. Altman sent Mr. Nussbaum a facsimile with a handwritten cover sheet, forwarding an "RTC Clip Sheet" of a March 9, 1992 New York Times article with the headline, "Clinton Defends Real-Estate Deal."(192)  The next day, Mr. Altman faxed to Mr. Nussbaum the same article and another Times report on Whitewater, dated March 8, 1992, entitled "Clintons Joined S&L Operator in an Ozark Real-Estate Venture."(193)  The link thus had been made been between the RTC criminal referral and the Clintons' investment in Whitewater and their relationship with Mr. McDougal.  This knowledge of the link between Whitewater and possible criminal investigations provides the subtext for a pattern of misconduct in the White House and elsewhere in the Clinton administration in an effort to contain potential damage from Whitewater and Madison.
II.<P>Capital Management Services and David Hale
<P>Whitewater was not the Clintons' only link to criminal investigations.  In September 1978, David Hale, a former prosecutor and municipal court judge, formed Capital Management Services Inc., ("CMS").(194)  In March 1979, the SBA licensed CMS as a Specialized Small Business Investment Company ("SSBIC").(195)  On September 15, 1993, the SBA placed CMS into receivership after "the company's accumulated losses exceeded its private capital by 171 percent."(196)
<P>A SSBIC is a company that the SBA licenses to lend money to disadvantaged small businesses.(197)  SSBICs may not provide assistance to businesses that are not at least 50 percent owned, controlled, and managed by "disadvantaged individuals."(198)  To ensure that SSBICs comply with these requirements, the SBA requires firms to document that they qualify for SBA assistance.(199)  
<P>Mr. Hale and his associates perpetrated a fraud on the SBA by using CMS to make loans to political insiders rather than "disadvantaged" individuals.(200)  After the SBA would advance federal funds to CMS, Mr. Hale and his business associates would falsify loan applications in order to receive funds for their personal needs.(201)  Mr. McDougal and Jim Guy Tucker were among associates of Mr. Hale who participated in and benefitted from this fraud.(202)<P>
<P>On April 3, 1986, Mr. Hale loaned $300,000 to Susan McDougal for the stated purpose of capitalizing Mrs. McDougal's new advertising firm, Master Marketing.(203)  
<P>  Wayne Foren, then Associate Administrator for Investment at the SBA and the program director for the SSBIC program, learned of the $300,000 loan.(204)  Mr. Foren also learned that some of the proceeds of the loan to Mrs. McDougal's Master Marketing benefitted Whitewater.(205)  Mr. Foren stated that records suggest that of the original $300,000 loan, $111,500 was diverted to make payments on the Flowerwood Farms account and another $25,000 was used to replace money, either directly or indirectly, that went into Whitewater.(206)  
<P>At the McDougal and Tucker trial, Mr. Hale testified that he made these loans to Mr. McDougal as a favor to then-Governor Clinton and Mr. McDougal.(207)  After Mr. Hale's allegations implicating the President became public in September 1993, this $300,000 loan quickly became the center of the controversy surrounding CMS and its connections to Mr. McDougal and Whitewater.  Although the accounts of Mr. McDougal and Mr. Hale differ regarding why the loan was made and the use of the proceeds, records clearly indicate that the money was used for purposes other than those stated on the loan application filed with the SBA.(208)  Mr. Hale's allegations concerning President Clinton have been refuted by Mr. McDougal's version of the events and President Clinton's own testimony at Mr. McDougal's trial, but neither has been verified by any outside source.(209)  
<P>Mr. Foren testified that he became concerned about CMS when Mr. Hale attempted to obtain matching government funds for what Mr. Hale claimed was an increase in his capital resulting from a gift.(210)   Mr. Hale told Mr. Foren that people would give him money for his SSBIC because they knew he had ties to Jim Guy Tucker and then-Governor Clinton.(211)  These statements aroused Mr. Foren's suspicion and, after a discussion with Mr. Hale, he sent a referral to investigate Mr. Hale's SSBIC to the Inspector General's office.(212) 
<P>In early 1993, the SBA began an internal inquiry into Mr. Hale and questionable activities at CMS, an inquiry which touched upon Mr. Hale's relationship with the Clintons.(213)  Again, by the time the inquiry ripened into a referral for further investigative action, the White House received word.  SBA Associate Administrator Wayne Foren testified that, in early May 1993, he briefed Erskine Bowles, the new SBA Administrator, about the agency's investigation of Mr. Hale and CMS because the case involved President Clinton.(214)  Shortly thereafter, Mr. Bowles told Mr. Foren that he had briefed White House Chief of Staff Thomas ("Mack") McLarty about the case.(215)
<P>On March 22, 1994, Mr. Hale pleaded guilty to two felony counts in connection to the granting of illegal loans.(216)  In 1996, James McDougal, Susan McDougal, and Governor Jim Guy Tucker were indicted on charges stemming from dealings associated with Madison Guaranty and Capital Management Services.(217)  On May 28, 1996 all three were convicted;  Mr. and Mrs.  McDougal were both convicted of eight charges directly related to the illegal $300,000 loan from Mr. Hale.(218)

 <H2>   SUMMARY OF THE EVIDENCE
     PART I: THE HANDLING OF FEDERAL INVESTIGATIONS</H2>
     
     
I. Mrs. Clinton Learns of the RTC Criminal Referral on Madison Guaranty.
<P>Before its charter expired at the end of 1995, the RTC was charged with investigating the cause of the failure of savings and loans under its control and to determine what civil claims, if any, should be pursued.  The RTC, however, lacked the authority to initiate criminal prosecution of the failed S&Ls.  Thus, it was the RTC's practice to notify the Justice Department -- typically, the U.S. Attorney's office and the FBI Bureau for the jurisdiction in which the failed thrift was located -- of any suspected crimes discovered by the agency.  A "criminal referral" is the formal document that the RTC and other federal agencies use to report suspected criminal activity to the Justice Department.(219)    
<P>In 1992 and 1993, RTC investigators in Kansas City submitted to the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas ten criminal referrals concerning the activities of Madison Guaranty.  Several of the referrals identified Mr. and Mrs. McDougal, the Clintons' Whitewater partners, and Mr. Tucker, who succeeded Mr. Clinton as Governor of Arkansas, as targets.  Two of the referrals specifically involved Whitewater Development Corporation, which maintained a checking account at Madison Guaranty.  One of the referrals alleged that Madison Guaranty funds were used to make illegal contributions to then-Governor Clinton's gubernatorial campaigns in the mid-1980s.  Finally, the Clintons were named in three of the referrals as possible witnesses to suspected criminal activities. 
<P>A.<P>The RTC begins its criminal investigation of Madison Guaranty. 
<P>The RTC began its investigation of criminal activities related to Madison Guaranty after the publication of an article on the front page of the New York Times on March 8, 1992.(220)  The article, written by investigative reporter Jeff Gerth, reported that Governor Clinton, then a leading Democratic candidate for president, and his wife were partners with Mr. McDougal in the Whitewater real estate venture.<P>  
<P>Mr. Gerth's article caused several RTC officials to question whether Whitewater had caused any of the financial losses suffered by the failed Madison Guaranty S&L.  Mr. Gerth had written that "at times money from Mr. McDougal's savings and loan was used to subsidize" Whitewater.  Mr. Gerth also wrote:

<P><P>"It was during the period that Whitewater was making the Clintons' loan payments that Madison Guaranty was putting money into Whitewater.

<P><P>For example, Whitewater's check ledger shows that Whitewater's account at Madison was overdrawn in 1984, when the corporation was making payments on the Clintons' loan.  Money was deposited to make up the shortage from Madison Marketing, an affiliate of the savings and loan that derived its revenue from the institution, records also show."(221)
    
<P>After publication of the article, the criminal investigations unit in the RTC's office in Tulsa, Oklahoma -- the office responsible for investigating possible crimes involving failed savings and loans in Arkansas -- received requests to investigate Madison Guaranty and Whitewater from both the Office of Investigations in the RTC Washington, D.C. office and from the director of the Tulsa office.(222)  In any event, a criminal examination of Madison Guaranty had already been slated to commence in December, 1992.(223) 
<P>In March 1992, Mike Van Valkenberg, the head of investigations in the Tulsa office, assigned Laura Jean Lewis to be the lead RTC criminal investigator on the case.(224)  At the time, Ms. Lewis was the RTC's only criminal investigator with responsibility for savings and loans in Arkansas.(225)
<P>From March through August 1992, Ms. Lewis examined Madison Guaranty records stored in a warehouse in Little Rock.(226)  She retraced and analyzed the flow of funds between several checking accounts at Madison Guaranty, including the Whitewater account, the McDougals' personal account, and the accounts of several other McDougal-related companies.(227)  
<P>Ms. Lewis testified that the investigation uncovered "substantial evidence of bank fraud."(228)  Specifically, Ms. Lewis found numerous instances in which the McDougals would write a check on the Madison Guaranty account of one their various enterprises with insufficient funds to satisfy the draft and then deposit another check in that account, also written on insufficient funds, from another Madison Guaranty account.(229)  Ms. Lewis observed that although many of checks had the word "loan" written on them, they were written on accounts lacking sufficient funds.(230)  Ms. Lewis testified that through this "elaborate check kiting scheme" the McDougals "float[ed] worthless checks among specific accounts [so as] to create the appearance of legitimate balances."(231) 
<P>B.<P>The first RTC criminal referral: C0004.
<P>In July 1992, the investigation was interrupted briefly when the RTC office in Tulsa was closed and its investigations unit merged with the Kansas City office.(232)  Ms. Lewis accepted an offer to transfer to the Kansas City office.(233)
<P>By early August 1992, Ms. Lewis had begun to draft a criminal referral based upon her investigation of Madison Guaranty.(234)  On August 31, 1992, the referral was completed and assigned the number C0004.(235)  The referral was signed by Ms. Lewis, and her two immediate supervisors in the Kansas City office:  Lee O. Ausen, the head of the Criminal Investigations Department, and L. Richard Iorio, the Director of Investigations.(236) 
<P>On September 1, 1992, Mr. Iorio sent Criminal Referral C0004 to Charles Banks, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas,(237) and to Steven Irons, Supervisory Special Agent ("SSA") of the FBI Little Rock Field Office.(238).  In the accompanying transmittal letter to Mr. Banks, Mr. Iorio wrote that "[c]ertain matters have come to our attention which may constitute criminal offenses under Federal law.  Enclosed is a report of Apparent Criminal Irregularity."(239)  The referral was accompanied by several hundred pages of documentary exhibits consisting of copies of checks, account statements, and other bank records.  
<P>Prior to its submission to the Justice Department, Criminal Referral C0004 was reviewed not only by Mr. Iorio and Mr. Ausen, but also by James Thompson, the Deputy Regional Director of the RTC's Kansas City office.(240)  James Dudine, the Director of the Office of Investigations in the RTC's Washington, D.C. office, also reviewed the referral after it was submitted to the Justice Department.(241)  Both Thompson and Dudine testified that they thought C0004 met the standard for issuance of a criminal referral -- i.e., that there was a reasonable basis for believing that a crime has been committed or attempted.(242)  Mr. Iorio, who signed the referral, testified that he thought the referral met and exceeded the prescribed standard.(243) 
<P>Criminal Referral C0004 was a 20-page, single-spaced description of "numerous questionable cash flow and 'loan' transactions" occurring in 1984 and 1985 among a dozen companies controlled by the McDougals, including Whitewater Development Corporation.(244)  The referral alleged that crimes may have been committed in the course of these transactions; that some of the McDougal's business associates may have been aware of the criminal activity; and that the suspected criminal activity may have cumulatively contributed to the failure of Madison Guaranty:
<P>The transactions reviewed and discussed herein will allege excessive overdrafts resulting in unauthorized loans, check kiting, possible forgery (or at the very least, extensive use of unauthorized signatures), potential misappropriation of funds, possible illicit campaign contributions, diversion of loan proceeds, and potential bank fraud; each of these actions, compounded by the extended time frame during which they occurred, lends [credence] to the probability that some or all of the McDougal's business associates and partners, the collective principals of these combined companies, had knowledge of these activities.  The extensive nature of these activities could allegedly constitute ongoing criminal and regulatory violations which lasted for a period of three or more years, and could have ultimately contributed to the failure of the Association.(245)

<P>The referral alleged that the McDougals and Lisa Aunspaugh (an employee of Susan McDougal's), had committed, among other crimes, bank fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. 1344, and conspiracy, in violation of 18 U.S.C. 371.(246)  The referral named the President and Mrs. Clinton, Governor Jim Guy Tucker, former U.S. Senator J.W. Fulbright, Stephen Smith, and Greg Young, as potential witnesses to suspected criminal activity.(247)  The referral also identified the Clintons, Mr. Tucker, and Mr. Smith as persons who had stood to benefit from the suspected criminal activity.(248)
<P>Ms. Lewis identified the Clintons as possible witnesses because they "were business associates and involved in the Whitewater Corporation with Mr. McDougal, and as such, I think I would have been imprudent in my job had I not listed them as witnesses because they were part of Whitewater and could have easily had knowledge of what Mr. McDougal was doing with those funds."(249)  Mr. Iorio agreed with Ms. Lewis' decision to list the Clintons as possible witnesses.(250)    
<P>The referral indicated that, during the mid-1980s, at least 10 checks were written on the Whitewater's account at Madison Guarantyand that five of the checks totalling over $60,000 were written on insufficient funds.(251)  The referral also noted that these overdrafts were cured by funds supplied by other McDougal entities, and that Madison Guaranty did not impose any service charges or fees in connection with the overdrafts.(252)
<P>C.<P>Betsey Wright informs Mrs. Clinton of the RTC criminal referral.
<P>At about the time when Ms. Lewis was preparing Criminal Referral C0004, Mrs. Clinton learned of its existence.  Betsey Wright, the former Chief of Staff to Governor Clinton, testified that in the fall of 1992, while she was working on the Clinton presidential campaign, she was informed, from a person she could not remember, of an RTC Criminal "Referral about an S&L officer which would implicate the Clintons in Arkansas."(253)  Ms. Wright testified that "she went scrambling trying to find out what on earth they were talking about."(254)  Ms. Wright called Bob Wilson, a criminal defense attorney in Little Rock, to determine whether she could obtain information about the referral but was told that such information would be confidential.(255)
<P>Ms. Wright testified that she spoke with Mrs. Clinton and asked "if she was aware of any friend of theirs in the savings and loan business who might be under criminal investigation, and we couldn't think of anybody."(256)  Although national media attention was focused on the McDougals, Madison Guaranty, and Whitewater during the 1992 campaign, Ms. Wright claimed that Mr. McDougal's name was not discussed during her conversation with Mrs. Clinton.(257)
<P>
II. Criminal Referral C0004 Languishes at the Justice Department<P>
<P>After a criminal referral is submitted to the U.S. Attorney, he or she must determine whether it warrants further investigation or the initiation of criminal proceedings.(258)  When the U.S. Attorney declines to proceed with a criminal referral, a "declination letter" is sent to the RTC.(259)  
<P>Although RTC Criminal Referral C0004 was submitted to the U.S. Attorney's Office in Little Rock on September 1, 1992,(260) no action was taken on the referral for more than one year.  Finally, in October 1993, the new U.S Attorney in Little Rock, Paula Casey, a former student and campaign worker for President Clinton, declined this referral.(261)  The referral was also reviewed by Justice Department officials in Washington, D.C., where the President's close friend, Webster Hubbell, was the Associate Attorney General, the third-highest position in the Justice Department.
<P>A.<P>The U.S. Attorney sends Criminal Referral C0004 to the main Justice Department. 

<P>On September 2, 1992, the U.S. Attorney's Office in Little Rock received Criminal Referral C0004.(262)  The U.S. Attorney's Manual directs that a U.S. Attorney send an "Urgent Memorandum" to the attention of the Attorney General whenever a sensitive matter arises.(263)  Although Criminal Referral C0004 identified Governor Clinton, then the Democratic nominee for President, his wife, and Jim Guy Tucker, then the Lieutenant Governor, as potential witnesses, Mr. Banks did not send an "Urgent Memorandum" or even report the receipt of the referral to the Justice Department in Washington, D.C. ("Main Justice").(264)  Mr. Banks claimed that he did not notify Main Justice of the referral immediately because he lacked "confidence" in the referral and wanted more evidence before notifying persons outside of Little Rock.(265)
<P>At about the same time, on September 17, 1992, White House Cabinet Secretary Edie Holliday asked Attorney General William Barr whether he was aware of any matter involving one of the presidential candidates.(266)  Ms. Holiday later told Mr. Barr that the matter she had heard about involved a failed savings and loan and the Clintons.  Mr. Barr asked Ira Raphaelson, then-Special Counsel for Financial Institutions Crimes(267), to ascertain whether the Justice Department was handling such an investigation.(268)  Mr. Raphaelson initially informed the Attorney General that no such case existed within the Department.(269) 
<P>After Mr. Barr made a second request, however, Mr. Raphaelson discovered that "there had been a referral down in Arkansas, but it had not been reported.  In fact, it appeared that the office had withheld it from [Justice Department] headquarters."(270)  Mr. Barr testified that he was angry that the U.S. Attorney's Office in Little Rock had deliberately failed to inform him of the matter:
<P>I basically said I was very angry that a matter which I viewed as a sensitive matter, that should have been reported to the Attorney General, was deliberately withheld from the Attorney General.  So I was angry, and expressed my displeasure, and said that I'd be interested in knowing why an urgent report was not prepared for me and why I was not advised of this case, and why it had been deliberately withheld.(271)
<P> 
<P>Mr. Barr testified that Criminal Referral C0004 definitely met the criteria for the issuance of an Urgent Report:
<P>The criteria is really anything which involves -- well, includes anything that involves a public personage, a celebrity or any kind of sensitive case that can involve, for example, public officials in the state, those kinds of things.  It's inconceivable to me that any U.S. Attorney would not immediately understand that this case would require an Urgent Report.(272)
<P><P>    
Mr. Barr instructed Mr. Raphaelson to ensure that the matter was kept in the strictest confidence to prevent any leaks and was handled solely based on its merits.(273)<P>    
<P>On October 7, 1992, Floyd Mac Dodson, First Assistant to Mr. Banks, informed Lawrence McWhorter, Director of the Executive Office of United States Attorneys, that the U.S. Attorney's Office had been "sitting on the referral for six weeks," and that he "thought some further investigation was needed."(274)  The next day, Mr. McWhorter transmitted an Urgent Memorandum, along with a copy of Criminal Referral C0004, to Attorney General Barr, stating that "[i]t is the belief of the U.S. Attorney's Office that further investigation into this matter is warranted."(275)
<P>On the same day, SSA Irons also sent a teletype to SSA Kevin Kendrick at FBI headquarters in Washington informing him about Crminal Referral C0004.(276)  The FBI teletype listed then-Governor and Mrs. Clinton and then-Lieutenant Governor Jim Guy Tucker among the possible witnesses.(277)  The teletype explained the reason for identifying the Clintons as potential witnesses:
<P>The activities of McDougal as they may have involved Bill or Hillary Clinton are related to Whitewater Development Corporation, Inc.  (WWD)  James and Susan McDougal and Bill and Hillary Clinton were partners in WWD. . . [Pages of the referral]  discuss the check kiting activity involving the WWD account at MGSL.(278)
 
According to the teletype, Mr. Banks had informed the FBI that he intended to research the referral and analyze the 300 documentary exhibits submitted by the RTC.(279)<P><P><P> On October 8, 1992, officials from FBI Headquarters and Main Justice met to discuss Crminal Referral C0004.(280)  Present at the meeting were Mr. Raphaelson; Robert Mueller, Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division; (281) Fred Verinder, Deputy Assistant Director, Criminal Division, at FBI Headquarters;(282) Mr. Kendrick; and Thomas Kubic, Section Chief, Banking Crimes Unit.  Mr. Mueller indicated that even though the referral on its face did not contain enough information for the Justice Department to render an opinion, the FBI should investigate the matter to determine whether the case had merit.(283)  As a result of the meeting, FBI Headquarters instructed its Little Rock Field Office to conduct a limited investigation into the matters described in the Criminal Referral C0004 and specifically directed the office to review the exhibits.(284)
<P>Although Mr. Bank assured the FBI that he would review the 300 exhibits, neither he nor Mr. Dodson ever reviewed them.(285)  On October 16, 1992, Mr. Banks wrote to Donald Pettus, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Little Rock Field Office, to inform him that the U.S. Attorney's Office would not participate in any investigation regarding Criminal Referral C0004 until after the 1992 presidential election.(286)  Mr. Banks indicated that he believed no prosecutable case existed against any of the witnesses, and that "the only allegations having any credibility are against the McDougals and Anspaugh." (287)<P>
<P>On the same day, the FBI Little Rock Field Office also notified Mr. Kendrick at FBI Headquarters by teletype that the limited data "may indicate criminal activity on the part of the captioned subjects, James and Susan McDougal, and Lisa Anspaugh.  However, USA is holding opinion of prosecutive opinion regarding these subjects in abeyance."(288)  
<P>Based on the decision of the U.S. Attorney's Office to defer any prosecutorial consideration, the Field Office also adopted a non-investigative posture on Crminal Referral C0004.(289)
<P>B.<P> Criminal Referral C0004 gets lost at the Justice Department.
<P>Criminal referral C0004 remained in the U.S. Attorney's Office until January 27, 1993, when Mr. Banks requested, in a letter to Donna Henneman, Ethics Program Manager at the Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys, that Main Justice assume responsibility for any further action.(290)  Mr. Banks believed that his office had a conflict of interest because of its unsuccessful criminal prosecution of Mr. McDougal in 1990.(291)  Mr. Banks concluded that "[a] limited preliminary investigation of allegations pertinent to Mr. and Mrs. McDougal and Ms. Anspaugh should be considered," and that interviews of these individuals should determine whether there is merit to further investigation.(292)  
<P>On February 9, 1993, Anthony Moscato, Director of the Executive Office of United States Attorneys, forwarded Mr. Banks' request to Stuart Gerson, then Acting Attorney General, through Douglas Frazier, Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General.(293)  Mr. Frazier prepared a recusal package and sent it to the Criminal Division for its recommendation.(294)
<P>On February 22, 1993, Gerald McDowell, Chief of the Frauds Section at Main Justice, directed a young trial attorney, Mark MacDougall, to analyze the criminal referral.(295)  Just one day later, on February 23, 1993, without even reviewing the 300 exhibits, Mr. MacDougal prepared a memorandum in which he concluded that Crminal Referral C0004 did not appear to warrant any criminal investigation.(296) 
<P> Main Justice officials decided against rendering an opinion on the merits of the referral.  Instead, Main Justice rejected Mr. Banks' request for recusal and returned the referral to Mr. Banks to let his office decide whether to investigate further or to decline prosecution.(297)
<P>On March 19, 1993, Acting Assistant Attorney General John Keeney prepared a memorandum for Mr. Frazier rejecting recusal:
<P>We have reviewed the material in the package and have concluded that there is no identifiable basis for recusal by the United States Attorney.  Further, we would not question a decision by the United States Attorney to decline further substantive action on the referral.(298) 

Main Justice wanted Mr. Banks to make the ultimate decision on the referral.  Allen Carver, Deputy Chief of the Fraud Section, Criminal Division, testified that the memorandum prepared by Mr. MacDougall did not constitute a conclusion by Main Justice not to prosecute the case,(299)  and that the matter was sent to the U.S. Attorney's Office for a determinative opinion.(300)
<P>Although Mr. Frazier believed that he should have received Mr. Keeney's memorandum in March, he did not receive it until the end of May or June, when it suddenly "appeared out of nowhere."(301)  Thus, for more than two months, Mr. Banks was not advised of Main Justice's decision to reject his request for recusal.(302)    
<P>By May 1993, the U.S. Attorney's Office still had not sent a response to Ms. Lewis on whether a decision had been made to decline or prosecute Criminal Referral C0004.  After Mr. Banks' resignation in March 1993,(303)  Ms. Lewis wrote to Acting U.S. Attorney Richard Pence in Little Rock to inquire about the status of the referral.  Mr. Pence notified Ms. Lewis that the matter had been referred to Main Justice.(304)
<P>Ms. Lewis then contacted Ms. Henneman of the Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys to ask about the status of Crminal Referral C0004.  After a number of inquiries, Ms. Henneman located, within the Fraud Section at Main Justice, the March 19 memorandum declining Mr. Banks' request for recusal.  Ms. Henneman then forwarded a copy of the memorandum to Mr. Frazier.(305)  Finally, in July 1993, Main Justice sent a package of materials, including the March 19 memorandum, to the U.S. Attorney's Office in Little Rock.(306)
<P>Mr. Pence discussed Criminal Referral C0004 with Assistant United States Attorney Fletcher Jackson.(307)  He took no other action.  Mr. Jackson advised Mr. Pence that he wanted to review the referral exhibits to determine whether any of the Madison Guaranty transactions were related to his ongoing investigation of David Hale and Capital Management Services, Inc.(308)  
<P>Although a decision on a criminal referral is usually issued within 60-90 days after submission, the U.S. Attorney's Office did not render a prosecutorial opinion on Criminal Referral C0004 until October 27, 1993 -- over one year after its submission -- when Ms. Casey formally declined the referral.(309)  The length of time that it took for the referral to be acted upon was unusually long in the experience of Mr. Iorio and Ms. Lewis.  Mr. Iorio testified that the normal time period for a United States Attorney to act on an RTC criminal referral was around 60 days;(310)  Ms. Lewis testified that she generally received responses within 30 to 45 days.(311)
<P>The final decision to decline prosecution was made without anyone having reviewed the exhibits.  Indeed, no one at the U.S. Attorney's office in charge of handling Crminal Referral C0004 ever reviewed or analyzed the 300 exhibits.(312)
<P>
III.Interference with the RTC's Ongoing Investigation of Madison. 
<P>
<P>From May through August 1993, while Crminal Referral C0004 was in the hands of the Justice Department, Ms. Lewis, at the express direction of her supervisors -- Mr. Ausen and Mr. Iorio -- continued to investigate Madison Guaranty.(313)  RTC Kansas City investigators Mike Caron, Ed Noyes, and Randy Knight joined Ms. Lewis in this effort.(314)  
<P>According to Ms. Lewis, this phase of the RTC's investigation uncovered:
<P>several transactions involving insider abuse, self-dealing, money laundering, embezzlement, diversion of loan proceeds, payments of excessive commissions, misappropriation of funds, land flips, inflated appraisals, falsification of loan records and board minutes, chronic overdraft status of various subsidiaries, joint ventures and real estate investments, regulatory violations of investments in subsidiaries, wire fraud, and illegal campaign contributions.(315)   
<P>
As a result, the RTC prepared nine new criminal referrals concerning Madison Guaranty.(316)  These referrals were completed on September 24, 1993.(317)  
<P>The 1993 referrals alleged the commission of crimes involving, among other things, bank fraud, conspiracy, false statements, false documents, wire fraud, aiding and abetting, and misuse of position.(318)  The nine referrals identified multiple suspects of criminal wrongdoing -- including Mr. and Mrs. McDougal, several former Madison Guaranty officers and borrowers, Mr. Tucker, and the Bill Clinton Political Committee Fund.(319)  President and Mrs. Clinton were listed as witnesses in three referrals,(320); Beverly Bassett Schaffer, the former Commissioner of the Arkansas Securities Department, was listed in one referral.(321)
<P>Criminal Referral #730CR0192 alleged that Mr. McDougal embezzled money from Madison Guaranty, by channelling it through the Whitewater account.(322)  In April 1985, Mr. McDougal transferred $30,000 from the Whitewater account at Madison Guaranty to former Senator J.W. Fulbright.(323)  As the balance of the Whitewater account was $270, this transfer caused the account to be overdrawn.(324)  Later that month, the overdraft was cured when Madison Financial deposited $30,000 into the Whitewater account.(325)  According to minutes of a Madison Financial Board of Directors' meeting, the $30,000 was supposedly a prepayment of Mr. McDougal's annual bonus.(326)
<P>The referral stated that "the unauthorized prepayment of McDougal's annual bonus was simply a method to allow McDougal to embezzle funds through manipulation of the accounts which he controlled.  He clearly used the White Water account to pay his unknown obligation to J.W. Fulbright and schemed to deprive Madison Financial Corporation of funds to reimburse the White Water account."(327)  
<P>President and Mrs. Clinton were listed as potential witness to suspected criminal activity.(328)  Ms. Lewis testified that the Clintons were included as potential witnesses because, as owners of the closely-held Whitewater corporation, they might "have had knowledge of what was going on with the finances of their corporation."(329)
<P>A second referral, number 730CR0196, alleged that "James B. McDougal, and MGS&L shareholder and former Director, Charles Peacock III, . . . conspired to misappropriate thrift funds for the purpose of making illegal campaign contributions to the benefit of Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton."(330)  The referral named Mr. McDougal, Mr. Peacock, and the Bill Clinton Political Committee Fund as criminal suspects.(331)
<P>The referral identified four $3,000 checks, all of which were dated April 4, 1985, drawn on Madison Guaranty accounts, and deposited in the Bill Clinton Political Committee account at the Bank of Cherry Valley.(332)  The first check was written by Mrs. McDougal on the McDougals' personal checking account at Madison Guaranty and made payable to the "Bill Clinton Political Committee."(333)  The second check, a Madison Guaranty cashier's check purchased in the name of J.W. Fulbright, was also made payable to the "Bill Clinton Political Committee."(334)  The referral alleged that this check was funded by a check issued by Flowerwood Farms, one of the McDougals' companies.(335)
<P>The third and fourth checks were each $3,000 cashier's checks drawn on Madison Guaranty.  The checks were purchased in the names of Ken Peacock and Dean Landrum, respectively, and made payable to Bill Clinton.(336)  The referral alleged that former Madison Guaranty director Charles Peacock III, the father of Ken Peacock and the business partner of Mr. Landrum, purchased these checks by diverting part of the proceeds of a $50,000 Madison Guaranty loan.(337)  The three cashier's checks were numbered sequentially -- Q2496, Q2497 and Q2498 --(338), and Mr. Landrum's first name, Dene, was misspelled on the check.(339)<P>  
<P>The referral further suggested that Mr. McDougal may have received benefits from then-Governor Clinton in exchange for $6,000 in campaign contributions.  The referral observed that during the month the $3,000 checks were written, Mrs. Clinton, then a partner in the Rose Law Firm, had sent a letter to the Arkansas Securities Department seeking approval of Madison Guaranty's plan to issue a class of preferred stock.(340)  The referral noted that the plan was approved the next month by the Arkansas Securities Commissioner, Beverly Bassett Schaffer, who had been appointed to her post by then-Governor Clinton.(341)  The referral also remarked that Madison Guaranty's request for approval to issue preferred stock came at a time when Madison Guaranty was badly in need of additional capital.(342)<P><P>
<P>The referral named both Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Schaffer as possible witnesses.(343)<P>
<P>Ms. Lewis believed that "there was a very strong possibility of a quid pro quo in the selection of Ms. Bassett into [her] position"(344) and that "there was a possibility of a quid pro quo situation" with respect to "Mrs. Clinton and the Rose firm representing Madison."(345)
<P>The nine referrals were submitted to the Justice Department on October 8, 1993.(346)
<P>The verdicts in the McDougal and Tucker trial prove that actual criminal activity was identified in the RTC referrals.  On August 17, 1995, a federal grand jury convened in the Eastern District of Arkansas returned a twenty-one count indictment against Mr. and Mrs. McDougal, and Governor Tucker alleging conspiracy, bank fraud, mail fraud, wire fraud, misapplication of funds, and the making of false statements and false entries.(347)  The Office of the Independent Counsel ("OIC") prosecuted the three defendants and, on May 28, 1996, after a lengthy trial, a jury in Little Rock convicted Mr. McDougal on 18 of 19 counts in the indictment, Mrs. McDougal on four counts, and Governor Tucker on two counts.(348)
<P>Many of the felony counts on which the defendants were convicted were based on suspected criminal activity identified in the RTC referrals.  Count one of the indictment, a criminal conspiracy charge on which both Mr. McDougal and Governor Tucker were convicted, involved a $260,000 loan obtained by Mr. Tucker from Madison Guaranty and the "flip" of property at 1308 Main Street in Little Rock.  This count closely tracked allegations made in RTC Criminal Referrals #730CR0190 and #730CR0198.(349)  The jury also convicted Mr. McDougal on charges of misapplication of funds (counts 17 and 18) and making false record entries (count 19) related to the land flip at 1308 Main Street -- the suspected crime described in Criminal Referral #730CR0198.(350)
<P>Three additional charges on which Mr. McDougal was convicted -- count 5 (mail fraud), count 6 (fraud), and count 7 (false statement), tracked the suspected criminal activity identified in Criminal Referral #730CR0199.  That referral outlined suspected crimes committed by Mr. McDougal in connection with his development of resort property on Campobello Island, off the coast of New Brunswick, Canada.36 
<P>Finally, five of the counts on which the jury returned guilty verdicts -- counts 1, 13, 14, 15, and 16 -- related to a fraudulent $300,000 loan made to Mrs. McDougal's company, Master Marketing, from Capital Management Services.(351)  The proceeds of that loan were tracked in the first Madison Guaranty referral, Criminal Referral C0004.
<P>Despite the proven success of the Kansas City investigators' efforts, they encountered a concerted effort to hamper their investigative efforts.  Both Ms. Lewis and Mr. Iorio testified that obstacles were placed in the way of the RTC's investigation into Madison Guaranty and Whitewater.  Ms. Lewis "believe[d] there was a concerted effort to obstruct, hamper and manipulate the results of our investigation of Madison."(352)
<P>Mr. Iorio shared that view.(353)  He also described as "unprecedented" the "scrutiny that had been focused on the efforts of preparing the referrals and the subsequent review of the referrals."(354)  He explained:
<P><P>Through this arduous process, the Kansas City office of investigations has been subjected to an alteration of the work environment that included instigation of special procedures, a new review critique mechanism, a slow down of information flow, information leaks, and for us, Jean Lewis, Lee Ausen, and myself, the uncertainty of being placed on administrative leave, without prior notification to RTC investigations management in Washington, D.C.  At that point, the review of our work appeared to be more than an effort to confirm or deny our findings.  Instead, it appeared that three of us had become the messengers of unwanted news, and if history serves as a guide, are often the targets of attack meant to deflect attention from the information the messengers bring.(355)
<P>Part of the pattern of intimidation, interference, and outright obstruction was the subjecting of the second set of criminal referrals to an unprecedented written "legal review" by the Professional Liability Section ("PLS") of the RTC.  The second set of nine criminal referrals related to Madison Guaranty were completed and signed by September 24, 1993, and the Kansas City RTC investigators had planned to send the referrals to the Justice Department on October 1, 1993.(356)
<P>On September 30, 1993, however, Julie Yanda, the Chief of the Professional Liability Section37  in the RTC Kansas City office, demanded that her staff be given the opportunity to conduct a "legal review" of the referrals.(357)  Ms. Lewis was concerned that the review was "a delay tactic,"(358) and, on October 4, 1993, she shared her concerns with RTC Regional Inspector General Dan Sherry.(359)
<P>Two senior RTC PLS attorneys, Karen Carmichael and Philip Adams, prepared this so-called "legal review" -- a 13-page memorandum, dated October 7, 1993, and addressed to Ms. Yanda.(360)  For each referral, the memorandum posed between six and 12 brief questions stemming from the authors' "concerns" about the referrals.(361)  The memorandum did not  answer or analyze the questions it raised.  And, it offered no suggestions for revising the referrals, gave no conclusions about the referrals, and contained no recommendations with respect to what action the RTC should take.(362)
<P>On October 8, 1993, PLS provided its legal review to the criminal investigators,(363) and the nine referrals were submitted to the United States Attorney's Office.(364)  Thus, the only effect of this legal review was to delay the submission of the referrals by one week.  The referrals were submitted exactly as they had been written prior to the PLS review.(365)
<P>Ms. Lewis and Mr. Iorio both described PLS's request to delay the submission of criminal referrals for a legal review as "unprecedented."(366)  According to Ms. Lewis, PLS had never before reviewed any other criminal referrals prepared by the Kansas City criminal investigations unit.(367)  Mr. Iorio similarly testified that "[t]he request to do a critique of the referrals, that was the first time this had happened and it was with regard to the nine Madison criminal referrals."(368)  He also stated that subsequent referrals were not reviewed prior to their submission in all cases.(369)
<P>Ms. Yanda claimed that her request for a legal review of the Madison Guaranty referrals was based on a June 17, 1993 RTC memorandum on the handling of criminal referrals.(370)  That memorandum stated: "[e]xcept in rare circumstances, criminal referrals shall be reviewed by RTC Investigations and Legal Division Criminal Coordinators before they are delivered to the U.S. Attorney and the FBI or any other investigative agency."(371)  
<P>Other RTC officials had a different view of the June 17, 1993 memorandum than Ms. Yanda.  Mr. Iorio did not read the memorandum to require that the submission of criminal referrals be delayed pending PLS's review.  According to Mr. Iorio, under the June 17 memorandum,  PLS was "to be provided with a copy of any outgoing criminal referrals for their review as a means to exchange information, but you are not dependent upon them critiquing your referrals and telling you it's all right to send them."(372)  Mr. Iorio's understanding was based on conversations with Mr. Dudine and Carl Gamble, the criminal coordinator in the RTC Washington, D.C. office, who he understood to have authored the memorandum.(373)  Also, Kenneth Donahue of the RTC Office of Investigations in Washington, D.C., told Ms. Yanda that he helped draft the June 17, 1993 memorandum, and that it had not been intended that PLS would prepare legal reviews of all referrals prior to their submission to the Justice Department.(374)
<P>Soon after the nine new criminal referrals were sent to the U.S. Attorney's Office, Ms. Lewis began to encounter more difficulties in conducting the Madison Guaranty investigation.  In October 1993, Ms. Lewis was removed from the Madison Guaranty "communications loop" by the PLS criminal coordinator.(375)  That same month, Mr. Iorio advised Ms. Lewis that PLS personnel had complained that she communicated directly with the U.S. Attorney's Office and the FBI in Little Rock, concerning Madison Guaranty.(376)
<P>On November 9, 1993, at the direction of Ms. Yanda, Ms. Lewis was removed from the position as lead investigator on the Madison Guaranty criminal case.(377)  According to Mr. Iorio, "[t]here was some friction between Jean and Julie's criminal coordinator, Karen Carmichael, and Julie came to me and asked me to remove Jean."(378)  When asked about this meeting,  Ms. Yanda claimed that she "laid out for Mr. Iorio a series of events that had troubled me greatly concerning Ms. Lewis and her failure to act as a team member and work with the legal division in concert to try to move matters along successfully to the benefit of the RTC."(379)  
<P>Mr. Iorio and Mr. Ausen told Ms. Lewis that she was being removed from the Madison Guaranty investigation "to avoid me taking a bullet I didn't deserve."(380)  On November 10, 1993, Ms. Lewis wrote in an e-mail, "[j]ust a heads up to let you know that Mike Caron, Senior Criminal Investigator, is now the lead investigator on Madison . . . The Powers that Be have decided that I'm better off out of the line of fire (and I ain't arguing)."(381)  
<P>The removal of Ms. Lewis from the Madison Guaranty investigation was only part of a larger pattern of interference by senior officials in the RTC's investigation.  April Breslaw, a PLS attorney, was at the center of this effort.  Throughout 1994, Ms. Breslaw sought to discourage RTC employees from investigating Madison Guaranty and informed RTC investigators that senior RTC officials preferred that any such investigation reach a certain outcome.  
<P>Ms. Breslaw's first contact with Madison Guaranty was in 1989.  In March 1989, Ms. Breslaw -- then an attorney in the FDIC Directors and Officers Liability Section -- retained the Rose Law Firm to handle a malpractice suit against Madison Guaranty's former independent accountants, Frost & Company.(382)  In January 1990, Ms. Breslaw was detailed to the RTC's Professional Liability Section.(383)  In April 1991, the Frost case was settled.(384)  In January 1994, Ms. Breslaw was put on a team of RTC attorneys reviewing Madison civil claims.(385)  In March 1994, Ms. Breslaw recused herself from the Madison case.(386)
<P>In late 1993 and early 1994, after public allegations arose that the Rose Law Firm had a conflict of interest, Ms. Breslaw's decision to hire the Rose Law Firm to represent the FDIC (and later the RTC) came under considerable scrutiny.(387)  In September 1993, Sue Schmidt, a Washington Post reporter, contacted Ms. Breslaw about Rose's representation of the RTC.(388)  Later that fall, the FDIC Legal Division commenced a review of the hiring of the Rose Law Firm for the Frost case.(389)  The Office of Investigations in the Kansas City RTC office also began that fall to examine Madison civil issues, including Rose Law Firm conflicts issues.(390)  In January 1994, the RTC Office of Contractor Oversight and Surveillance also started to investigate Rose conflicts issues.(391) 
<P>On January 12, 1994, Ms. Breslaw sent an e-mail message to Mr. Iorio and James Thompson, the Vice President of the Kansas City RTC office responsible for investigations.(392)  In the e-mail, Ms. Breslaw stated that "[i]t's my understanding that Kansas Investigations has attempted to evaluate the decision to hire the Rose Law Firm to represent the government against Frost & Co."(393)  She then attempted to persuade Mr. Thompson and Mr. Iorio to call off the investigation:
<P>[Y]ou should be aware that the FDIC is conducting its own investigation of this matter.  Trial attorneys from their Special Litigation unit are in the process of both evaluating relevant documents and interviewing witnesses.  By all indications, this project is being handled in a professional manner. . . . In light of all of this, I suggest that Investigations discontinue its inquiry into this matter.(394)
  
<P>Within days of sending this e-mail, Ms. Breslaw warned RTC investigator Gary Davidson against pursuing an investigation of Madison, saying that certain RTC managers would take a "dim view" of such an investigation.(395)  In a February 18, 1994 memorandum addressed to Mr. Iorio, Mr. Davidson recounted his conversation with Ms. Breslaw:
<P>On January 11, 1994, you requested that I conduct a preliminary investigation into Madison Guaranty, for possible Civil Fraud claims. . . . On January 13th or 14th, I called the assigned PLS attorney, April Breslaw, for the purpose of asking whether she knew of any fraudulent activity that was not addressed in the Criminal Referrals.
<P>
<P>Before I could ask my intended question, April asked if I was conducting an investigation into Madison Guaranty.  After acknowledging that I was, she indicated that what she was about to tell me was being stated as politely as she could.  April felt that I should know there are some RTC people in management positions that would take a "dim view" of me investigating Madison Guaranty.  She also advised that I should be very careful of who I talk to and what I say, because of the people associated with Madison Guaranty.(396)

<P>Mr. Davidson came to Mr. Iorio within a few days after he had received Ms. Breslaw's warning that RTC management "would take a `dim view' of [him] investigating Madison Guaranty."(397)  Mr. Iorio told Mr. Davidson to memorialize what Ms. Breslaw had said because he "thought it was very unusual."(398)  Mr. Davidson interpreted Ms. Breslaw's comments as "definitely a threat."(399)
<P>Ms. Breslaw recalled a conversation with Mr. Davidson but denied telling him that some RTC managers would take a "dim view" of him investigating Madison.(400)  She remembered only cautioning Mr. Davidson about speaking to the press.(401)  But Ms. Breslaw's testimony is contradicted by a July 12, 1994 memorandum she wrote to RTC Deputy General Counsel Andrew Tomback.  In that memorandum, Ms. Breslaw admitted that she had told Mr. Davidson that some people "would take a dim view" of an investigation in Rose Law Firm conflicts issues:
<P>Gary called me in 1994 to quiz me about the Rose Law Firm.  In response, I reminded Gary that the FDIC had taken responsibility for evaluating Rose Firm conflicts and that it was not appropriate for RTC Kansas investigations to go further into that matter.  I believe I told Gary that the senior people would take a dim view of further Kansas inquiry into Rose Law Firm conflicts issues.(402)
<P>On February 2, 1994, at the direction of Mark Gabrellian, Counsel for the Legal Division of the RTC, Ms. Breslaw traveled to the Kansas City RTC Office of Investigations to review Madison documents in connection with the RTC's recently reopened Madison civil investigation.(403)  That afternoon, Ms. Breslaw and Ms. Lewis spoke for approximately 40 minutes.(404)  Ms. Lewis recorded their conversation.38   On the tape, a speaker who Ms. Lewis identified as Ms. Breslaw stated:
<P><P><P>I think if they can say it honestly, the head people -- Jack Ryan and Ellen Kulka, would like to be able to say "Whitewater did not cause a loss to Madison."  We don't know, you know, what Fiske is going to find and we don't offer any opinion on it.  But the problem is nobody has been able to say to Ryan and Kulka, "Sure say that, that's fine."(405)  

At the time, Mr. Ryan was the RTC's CEO and Ms. Kulka was its General Counsel.
<P>Ms. Breslaw also was recorded saying:
<P><P><P>Well, you know, as I say -- I feel self-conscious asking that, because in some ways it is kind of a silly question.  But it's the kind of thing, they're looking for what they can say, and I do believe they want to say something honest, but I don't believe at all, and I don't want to suggest at all, that they want us to move to certain conclusions.  I really don't get that feeling.
<P><P>But there are answers they would be happier about, you know, because it would<P> get them, you know, off the hook, you know, and that would be it about<P> Whitewater.  So that is why we keep getting asked the same things.(406)

In Ms. Lewis's view, "it is clear that Ms. Breslaw was there to deliver a message that 'the people at the top would like to be able to say Whitewater did not cause a loss to Madison.'"(407)
<P>Ms. Breslaw initially denied having made this statement to Ms. Lewis.  On March 24, 1994, Representative James A Leach stated on the floor of the House of Representatives that "[o]n February 2, 1994, the day Roger Altman briefed the White House on Madison Guaranty, April Breslaw, RTC Senior Attorney, visited the Kansas City office and said that Washington would like to say that Whitewater caused no losses to Madison."(408)39   That same day, Ms. Breslaw sent an e-mail to several persons within the RTC, saying "[a]s you may know, Congressman Leach made a statement regarding the so-called 'Whitewater' affair on the floor of the Congress today.  At one point he made specific reference to me.  I want you to know that I categorically deny making the statement which he attributed to me. . . . I did not say that anyone from Washington 'would like to say' anything."(409)
<P>On March 25, 1994, the day after Representative Leach made his statement, Ms. Breslaw met with Ms. Kulka and Assistant General Counsel Thomas Hindes to discuss Representative Leach's statement.  The notes of Ms. Kulka's secretary, Wilma Lekan,(410) reflect that at the meeting Ms. Breslaw stated that she had discussed Whitewater with Ms. Lewis and mentioned both Ms. Kulka and Mr. Ryan but denied saying that the two wanted a particular outcome: 
<P>April said that she told Jean that we had been getting inquiri[es] in Washington about Whitewater.  She said she told her that Ellen and Jack Ryan had been getting inquiries (she said that she was thinking of the tolling agreements and the D'Amato letter.)  April said that this was the only point where she mentioned Ellen Kulka and Jack Ryan.

<P>April says that she denies saying that Ellen Kulka or Jack Ryan wanted a particular outcome or wanted the loss numbers to be anything.(411)
<P>Before the Special Committee, Ms. Breslaw recalled speaking to Ms. Lewis on February 2, 1994,(412) but she claimed that she did not recall making the statement that "if they can say it honestly, the head people, Jack Ryan and Ellen Kulka, would like to be able to say Whitewater did not cause a loss to Madison."(413)40 
<P>Ms. Breslaw claimed that she was "not sure" whether it was her the voice on the tape recording.(414)  She implausibly testified that "I don't know what my voice sounds like on the tape, or on a tape,"(415) and that "I guess all I can say is that I don't know what I sound like on tape."(416)  She finally admitted "I have no reason to think that this is not my voice."(417) 
<P>In an e-mail dated June 28, 1994, Ms. Breslaw expressed concern about any production of documents to the Senate related to her conversation with Ms. Lewis:
<P>I have the impression that we're in the midst of producing doc's to the Senate banking committee in anticipation of the hearing scheduled for the end of July.  If anybody is considering producing anything that has anything to do with my conversation with Jean Lewis, I'd like to talk about whether its responsive to the committee's request.  It's my understanding that the senate rejected amendments which might have brought this incident into the scope of the hearings.(418) 
<P>On August 15, 1994, the three Madison investigators were placed on administrative leave for two weeks.(419)  The RTC took this action without any warning or explanation.  On that fateful day, after Mr. Ausen and Mr. Iorio arrived at work, they were summoned to an office and told that they had been placed on administrative leave.(420)  The three investigators then were escorted to their offices and finally out of the building.(421)  They were told to stay off RTC property.(422)  Their offices were locked and sealed.
<P>On the night of August 15, Ms. Lewis, then in the hospital, received a call from Edward Noyes, a member of the Madison investigative team, who advised her Mr. Iorio and Mr. Ausen had been placed on administrative leave.(423)  Mr. Noyes told her that "the purge has begun."(424)  He telephoned later to let Ms. Lewis know that she had also been placed on leave.(425)
<P>The three Madison investigators each received an identical one-page memorandum, dated August 12, 1994, from Mr. Hindes.(426)  The memorandum stated "[y]ou are hereby placed on Administrative Leave to be effective immediately upon receipt on August 15, 1994" but offered no explanation for the adverse employment action.(427)  Although the August 12th memorandum indicated that "[i]f you have any questions you may contact Randi L. Mendelsohn, Chief, Employee Relations, OHRM [Office of Human Resource Management],"  Ms. Mendelsohn refused to advise Mr. Iorio's counsel why he had been placed on administrative leave.(428)  Ms. Mendelsohn refused offers to have Mr. Iorio answer questions, provide documents, answer charges, or otherwise provide assistance.(429)  According to Ms. Lewis, the three were not contacted for interviews or information.(430)
<P>On August 29, 1994, Mr. Iorio, Mr. Ausen, and Ms. Lewis were told to return to work.(431)  The three still did not receive any explanation for why they were put on administrative leave.(432)<P>
<P>The RTC never provided an explanation to Ms. Lewis, Mr. Ausen and Mr. Iorio, although Mr. Iorio believed the action was related to the Madison investigation.(433) 
<P>In August 1994, Mr. Iorio and Ms. Lewis through counsel requested that the RTC OIG investigate the matter.(434)  John J. Adair, the Inspector General of the RTC, testified that in August 1994 his office received requests from attorneys for two or three of the Madison investigators and from Mr. Ryan to investigate the matter.(435)
<P>On the Friday before the administrative leave of the three Madison investigators was to end, Mr. Adair, received a telephone call from Andrew Tomback, Assistant General Counsel, and RTC attorney Erica Cooper,(436) who "indicated to me that perhaps my office would want to, my agents would want to search the offices of the three individuals."(437)  Mr. Adair told Mr. Tomback and Ms. Cooper that such a search "didn't seem to be an appropriate thing for us to do absent any really good reason to do that."41 (438)
<P>  Before the RTC OIG could proceed with the investigation, the OIC advised that inquiry by the RTC IG into the administrative leave matter would interfere with the his work.(439)  Accordingly, the RTC OIG suspended its investigation.

IV.Paula Casey Delays her Recusal from Madison, Handles the Hale Pleas Negotiations, and Declines to Prosecute Criminal Referral C0004.
<P>
<P>A.<P>Investigations of Capital Management and David Hale.

<P>During the summer of 1993, even before the RTC submitted its second set of criminal referrals relating to Madison Guaranty, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Arkansas began investigating David Hale, a Little Rock municipal judge who owned a Small Business Investment Corporation ("SBIC") called Capital Management Services, Inc. ("CMS").  Mr. Hale was accused of fraudulently obtaining SBA loans.
<P>On July 20, 1993, the date of Vincent Foster's death, the FBI obtained a search warrant and seized loan documents from Mr. Hale's CMS offices.  Some of the documents contained references to Mr. Tucker, as well as a $300,000 loan to Mrs. McDougal d/b/a Master Marketing.(440)  As a result of information obtained in its investigation of Mr. Hale, by August 20, 1993, the Little Rock FBI had opened a separate fraud investigation of Mr. Hale and Mr. McDougal.(441)
<P>The SBA certified CMS as a Specialized SBIC on March 14, 1979.(442)  Over the next 14 years, the SBA examined CMS eleven times.(443)  Although five examinations found no improprieties, six identified various areas of regulatory concern.  Specifically, the SBA raised concerns about CMS's financing of businesses that did not qualify as socially or economically disadvantaged.(444)  The SBA also faulted CMS for lending to businesses that were controlled by Mr. Hale's associates.(445)
<P>In late 1992, despite its spotty compliance record, CMS and Mr. Hale applied for $6 million in additional leverage from the SBA.(446)  Mr. Hale represented to the SBA that he had a $13.8 million increase in CMS assets(447) in the form of non-cash assets that investors had provided to CMS.(448)  On October 28, 1992, the SBA rejected Mr. Hale's application for financing, and requested additional information relating to donated assets.  Mr. Hale then informed the SBA that the donated assets consisted of $11.5 million in medical receivables of an investment pool and $2.3 million in stock of a company named National Building Supply.(449)  On December 8, 1992, the SBA gave Mr. Hale conditional approval for the capital increase -- that is, to accept the donated assets.(450)  The SBA, however, informed Mr. Hale that the assets could only be used for regulatory purposes -- i.e, to support the $6 million in additional financing -- until the assets were converted to cash and their value had been validated.(451)
<P>On February 19, 1993, at Mr. Hale's request, Wayne Foren, then the SBA's Associate Administrator for Investment, met with Mr. Hale in Washington, D.C. to withdraw his application for additional SBA financing for CMS.(452)  According to Mr. Foren: "In other words, he wanted the problem to go away.  He didn't want to answer the questions of where did the assets come from."(453)  But Mr. Foren persisted in questioning Mr. Hale about the donated assets: "And I said David, why would anybody give you tens of millions of dollars worth of assets?  Doesn't make sense. . . . Either these assets are not worth the represented value, in which case you are perpetrating a fraud on SBA, or you are being bribed."(454)
<P>Mr. Hale told Mr. Foren that he was close to the current governor of Arkansas, Jim Guy Tucker, and to President Clinton,(455) and "[t]hat he had access to both."(456)  "His answer was people gave him the money, would give him the money because he could do things for them in Arkansas."(457)  Mr. Hale elaborated that an individual, who was interested in starting an insurance company in Arkansas, had put money into CMS by routing the funds through the Central Arkansas Community Development Corporation, a non-profit corporation.(458)  The money was given to Mr. Hale for "[g]etting things done in Arkansas" and to "solve problems."(459)  When Mr. Foren expressed concern over the arrangement, Mr. Hale replied, "well, Wayne, you have to understand this is the way we do business in Arkansas."(460)
<P>Mr. Foren found Mr. Hale's statements regarding his relationship with Governor Tucker and President Clinton to be credible.(461)  Indeed, in May 1993, after Mr. Foren had referred the case to the SBA Inspector General ("SBA IG") for further investigation, Mr. Hale called Mr. Foren and requested that he attend a meeting with Governor Tucker and a representative of the Arkansas Development Finance Authority.(462)  Mr. Foren declined to attend the meeting because "[i]t is inappropriate for me to attend a meeting on this kind of a subject called by David Hale while we're -- we have made a referral for investigation of his company."(463)
<P>On March 11, 1993, the SBA issued a regulatory compliance report on CMS that "raised questions relative to the donated assets and the values" on those assets.(464)  Specifically, the report identified the source of the $11.5 million investment pool certificate as an offshore company incorporated in the Grand Cayman Islands.(465)  According to Mr. Foren, the mysterious source of the assets raised "another red flag" for regulators.(466)  In addition, the SBA determined from documents that National Building Supply filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission that the stock donated to CMS was worthless; National Building Supply was bankrupt.(467)  On March 26, 1993, as a result of the examination report, the SBA sent Mr. Hale an examination letter(468) disclosing the results of the examination and requiring Mr. Hale to provide additional information and/or take corrective action.(469)  On April 20, 1993, Mr. Hale responded that he disagreed with the conclusions and findings of the examination.
<P>On May 5, 1993, Mr. Foren referred the matter to the SBA IG for investigation.(470)  Arnold Hawkins, the SBA's Regional Inspector General,(471) determined that the case would require considerable investigative resources.(472)  Because the SBA IG did not have an office in Little Rock, Mr. Hawkins and other SBA officials decided to refer the matter directly to the FBI on May 20, 1993.(473)
<P>The FBI then proceeded to investigate CMS and Mr. Hale.  On June 14, 1993, the FBI requested that the SBA provide documents concerning CMS and Mr. Hale.(474)  On July 20, 1993, the FBI obtained a search warrant for CMS records.(475)  The next day, the subpoena was served and loan documents were seized from the CMS offices.(476)   Some of the documents contained references to Mr. Tucker, while others referred to the $300,000 CMS loan to Susan McDougal d/b/a Master Marketing.(477)
<P>On September 23, 1993, a grand jury indicted Mr. Hale on various federal charges relating to the operation of CMS.  Mr. Hale has since pleaded guilty to two federal charges and he cooperated with the investigation by the OIC into alleged criminal conduct arising from the operation of CMS, Whitewater, and Madison.(478)
<P>B.<P>Plea Negotiations with David Hale.
<P>In May 1993, while the SBA and FBI were investigating Mr. Hale, President Clinton nominated Ms. Casey to be the new U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas.  Ms. Casey had no prior prosecutorial experience,(479) but she had close ties to the President and Mrs. Clinton.  She worked on Clinton gubernatorial campaigns(480), attended a law school class taught by President Clinton, and participated in a law clinic with Mrs. Clinton.(481)  Governor Clinton also had appointed Ms. Casey to a special commission along with Mrs. Clinton, for the development of a new court system and a new juvenile law code,  and to a separate juvenile advisory group.(482)
<P>In addition, Ms. Casey was a longtime personal friend of Mr. and Mrs. Tucker.  She had lobbied Governor Tucker's office in 1993 on behalf of the Arkansas Bar Association.(483)  Ms. Casey's husband also had worked on Governor Tucker's political campaigns and had donated money to him.(484)    
<P>A short time before Ms. Casey took office on August 16, 1993,(485) Randy Coleman, a Little Rock attorney representing Mr. Hale, met with Assistant U.S. Attorney Fletcher Jackson.(486)  Mr. Coleman testified that he met with Mr. Jackson "to try to determine what was happening since I didn't know at that point in time.  I'd had very little opportunity to visit with my client to educate myself at that point."(487)
<P>Several days later, Mr. Coleman met with Mr. Jackson again.(488)  Mr. Coleman expressed concern about the timing of the indictment of Mr. Hale and whether there would be any time for negotiations.(489)  At this second meeting, Mr. Coleman told Mr. Jackson that Mr. Hale could offer the government information that might lead the U.S. Attorney's Office to Mr. McDougal and possibly to Governor Tucker and President Clinton.(490)  Mr. Coleman recalled that he specifically identified potential areas for cooperation: Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan, James McDougal, Susan McDougal, Master Marketing, President Clinton, Governor Tucker, Castle Water & Sewer, Southloop Construction Company and Campobello Realty.(491)  Mr. Coleman was also certain that he mentioned Whitewater to Mr. Jackson.(492)
<P>Mr. Jackson recalled that Mr. Coleman told him that Mr. Hale could help him "get Tucker," and that President Clinton might have some involvement in the Hale transactions.(493)  Based on his investigation of the CMS loan files, Mr. Jackson was aware that the Hale investigation might lead to Governor Tucker and President Clinton: 
<P>[I]f I recall the correct words were -- that I used were that, from Hale, the path would lead to Mr. McDougal, and then the road would divide, one branch would possibly go over to Mr. Tucker, and the other branch would go over possibly to Whitewater and the Clintons.(494)
Mr. Jackson refused, however, to enter into any plea negotiations until Ms. Casey took office.(495)
<P>After Ms. Casey was confirmed, Mr. Jackson briefed her on the Hale investigation.(496)  He advised her that he planned to continue his investigation of other matters involving Mr. Hale that might ultimately lead to Madison Guaranty, the subject of the first RTC criminal referral.  Mr. Jackson also informed Ms. Casey that Mr. Tucker might be a target or a witness in that investigation,(497) and that the RTC expected to make additional criminal referrals relating to Madison Guaranty.(498)
<P>Ms. Casey admitted that "Fletcher told me that his continued investigation of the David Hale matter could possibly involve Governor Tucker.  I don't know that he told me specifically what that involvement might be."(499)  But, Ms. Casey denied that Mr. Jackson advised her of the specific list of persons about whom Mr. Hale might offer evidence.(500) 
<P>On September 7, 1993, Mr. Coleman met with Ms. Casey to discuss a possible plea negotiation for Mr. Hale.(501)  In exchange for his cooperation, Mr. Coleman initially requested that Mr. Hale be granted immunity or charged with a misdemeanor.(502)  Ms. Casey insisted that Mr. Hale enter a plea to an unspecified felony in exchange for a possible sentence reduction depending on the nature of the information offered.(503)  
<P>Mr. Coleman testified that he informed Ms. Casey that Mr. Hale had information regarding important Arkansas political figures.(504)  According to Mr. Coleman, he specifically provided Ms. Casey with the names of President Clinton, Governor Tucker, Madison Guaranty, James McDougal, Susan McDougal, Castle Sewer & Water, Southloop Construction Company, Campobello Realty and Whitewater.(505)  Mr. Coleman understood that Ms. Casey and Mr. Johnson "had already talked with Fletcher and they were aware of some of these things [names of areas of possible cooperation] before I got there. . . ."(506) 
<P>Mr. Coleman further testified that he also offered to make an informal or an "attorney" proffer.(507)  In an "attorney proffer," Mr. Coleman would essentially provide a more detailed summary of evidence Mr. Hale might offer.(508)  Mr. Coleman testified that the government could have accepted his informal proffer without granting immunity to Mr. Hale: "If I make an informal proffer to you through counsel and give you an idea of what is available, the negotiation can carry forward in some form from this point.  I'm trying to get a dialogue started with these people, and I'm not getting anywhere."(509)  Ms. Casey nonetheless gave no response to Mr. Coleman's offer for an informal proffer at the meeting or during the following week.(510)  
<P>Ms. Casey had a markedly different recollection of the September 7 conversation.  She claimed that Mr. Coleman provided no names or concrete information,42  but merely "insinuated that Mr. Hale could give information about people who were too big for me to prosecute."(511)  She did not inquire further about the "big people" because "[i]t may have piqued my interest but my understanding of the way the process works is that his client should proffer his testimony to an agent for evaluation." (512)  Ms. Casey claimed that even though she met with Mr. Jackson several times after her meeting with Mr. Coleman, she still never inquired about the "big people."(513)  
<P>On September 15, 1993, after not hearing from Ms. Casey for a week, Mr. Coleman wrote to her to confirm that he had received no response to his offer of an informal proffer.(514)  The letter stated:
<P>I have offered an informal proffer of Mr. Hale's information for evaluation of its quality and content, but have reached absolutely no interest in the process.(515)
Ms. Casey sent back a letter stating that plea negotiations were at "an impasse" -- reiterating the government's insistence that Mr. Hale plead guilty to a felony.(516) 
<P>On September 20, 1993, Mr. Coleman sent another letter to Ms. Casey, in which he reiterated that he had provided a list of names to Mr. Jackson.(517)  When asked about this letter, Ms. Casey denied again that she ever received any specific names from Mr. Coleman, and claimed that the letter did not prompt her to discuss the matter with Mr. Jackson.(518)  Mr. Johnson similarly claimed that Mr. Coleman never offered any specific information during plea negotiations.(519)
<P>Thus, according to Mr. Coleman, he (1) provided specific names to Mr. Jackson and Ms. Casey --including the President and Governor Tucker -- as areas of cooperation; (2) offered Ms. Casey an informal or attorney proffer; and (3) reiterated in writing that he had offered an informal proffer and given specific areas of cooperation.  Yet, Ms. Casey did not notify Main Justice of, or express any interest in Mr. Coleman's overtures.
<P>Because of Ms. Casey's unwillingness to enter into plea negotiations, Mr. Coleman suggested in his September 15th letter that Ms. Casey recuse herself from the case:(520)
<P>I cannot help but sense the reluctance in the U.S. Attorney's office to enter into plea negotiations in this case. . . .  I cannot help but believe that this reluctance is borne out of the potential political sensitivity and fallout regarding the information which Mr. Hale would provide to your office, but at the same time it is information which would be of substantial assistance in investigating the banking and borrowing practices of some individuals in the elite political circles of the State of Arkansas, past and present. . .

<P>Would it not be appropriate at this point for your office to consider terminating participation in this investigation and to bring in an independent prosecutorial staff, who are not so involved with the histories and personalities and circumstances of this case?(521)
Mr. Coleman believed that Ms. Casey's recusal was appropriate because of her extensive involvement in Arkansas politics:
<P>I knew Paula had been active in the political arena over the years.  I knew her husband had.  I think, at least it was my impression, that all of us were fairly aware at that point in time that there were some substantially prominent folks involved here.  

<P>You could look at the receipt on the search warrant and the nature of the records that the FBI seized from Mr. Hale's office and certainly gather at least that Mr. Tucker's name was prominently displayed.(522)  
However, according to Ms. Casey, she did not need to recuse herself because Mr. Coleman did not proffer any specific information.(523)  Mr. Johnson seconded Ms. Casey's position.(524)
<P>By this time, Ms. Casey knew that Governor Tucker was referenced in both the Hale investigation and the ongoing Madison investigation.(525)  In addition, as early as August, Ms. Casey told Mr. Jackson that if the U.S. Attorney's Office prosecuted Governor Tucker or if the anticipated set of RTC referrals named Governor Tucker, she would have to recuse herself.(526)
<P>Ms. Casey never discussed Mr. Coleman's request for plea negotiations or immunity with Main Justice or notified Main Justice of information that Mr. Coleman said Mr. Hale could proffer.(527)  Even though Mr. Jackson told her that "there was the potential that [Hale] could lead to some people," Ms. Casey claimed that "for that matter I suppose every loan file at SBIC was a potential defendant."(528)
<P>On September 17, 1993, New York Times reporter Jeff Gerth contacted a high ranking Justice Department official, Irv Nathan, Associate Deputy Attorney General,(529) and an FBI Little Rock Field Agent, Robert M. Satowski, to inform them of his interview with Mr. Hale.(530)  Mr. Gerth told them that Mr. Hale was prepared to furnish specific information about sensitive matters, possibly involving the Clintons, including information about a $300,000 loan to Mrs. McDougal that was funneled to Whitewater Development Corporation.(531) 
<P>On the same day, FBI Little Rock sent a teletype to FBI Director Louis Freeh about Mr. Hale's allegations.  The teletype indicated that "Gerth alluded that this was why the United States Attorney Casey would not deal with Coleman when he was attempting to work out a suitable deal for his client."(532)  In a separate memorandum, dated September 21, 1993, to FBI Director Freeh, Mr. Keeney outlined the substance of Mr. Hale's allegations that Mr. McDougal and then-Governor Clinton "encouraged Hale to provide funds to Madison Guaranty, prior to the audit, to bring the Whitewater loans acceptably up to date.  Thereafter Hale, through his Small Business Investment Corporation, lent $300,000 to Susan McDougal, dba Madison Marketing."(533)
<P>Meanwhile, on September 20, 1993, after learning of Mr. Hale's allegations about President Clinton, Mr. Keeney met with other high ranking officials at Main Justice to discuss the need for Ms. Casey to recuse herself from both the SBA fraud case against Mr. Hale and the investigation into Mr. Hale's allegations about Governor Tucker, the McDougals and President Clinton, as well as Criminal Referral C0004 relating to Madison Guaranty.(534)  Mr. Keeney, Principal Deputy Attorney General, Gerald McDowell, Chief of Frauds Section, and Joseph Gangloff, Chief of the Public Integrity Section, all agreed that Ms. Casey should recuse herself from the matter.(535)  
<P>According to Mr. Gangloff, the criteria for recusal include past personal, political or financial relationships between the United States Attorney and the subject of an investigation.  In fact, the mere appearance of a conflict justifies recusal.(536)  According to Mr. Gangloff, Main Justice officials knew Ms. Casey was close to President Clinton and, thus, she "obviously" should recuse herself under the circumstances.(537)  Mr. Gangloff was "surprised" that Ms. Casey had not advised Main Justice of Mr. Hale's allegations about the President, and believed that Main Justice should have been involved in the case sooner.(538)  
<P>Mr. Keeney also believed Ms. Casey "certainly should not be involved in the matter" because "she was the U.S. Attorney in Little Rock, Arkansas.  She was appointed by the Clinton Administration.  And we had a situation where somebody who was under investigation was suggesting . . . that he had information which would implicate the President who appointed her."(539)  Mr. Keeney testified that it was important to him that "she would in fact recuse herself, and that she would not be involved in taking any sort of proffer from David Hale" or make any more substantive decisions on the case.(540)   Mr. Carver and Mr. McDowell also agreed.(541)
<P>At the time, Mr. Keeney based his opinion solely on the fact that Ms. Casey was appointed by President Clinton.(542)  Mr. Keeney testified that although Ms. Casey may have "said something" about her relationship with Governor Tucker, she did not disclose the nature of her relationship with President Clinton.(543)  Ms. Casey did not disclose her August conversation with Mr. Jackson about the expected set of new referrals that might involve Governor Tucker or the fact that the Hale investigation would likely involve Madison Guaranty.(544)
<P>Mr. Keeney called Ms. Casey and told her that she should recuse herself from the Hale and Madison matters.(545)  Mr. Keeney expressed his opinion in "strong terms."(546)  Even though Mr. Keeney was Acting Assistant Attorney General and Ms. Casey was a newly appointed U.S. Attorney with no prior prosecutorial experience, she refused his advice to recuse herself.(547)  Mr. Keeney recalled that Ms. Casey told him: "Well, she said, in essence, I'm a fair person, I'm a person of integrity, I can handle this, this matter as my oath of office requires me to do so."(548)   
<P>According to Mr. Keeney, Ms. Casey told him that she "would have to think about" recusal.(549)  Ms. Casey did not recall that she was considering recusing herself at the end of the conversation.(550)  Mr. Johnson opposed recusal by the office.(551)  Ms. Casey never contacted Mr. Keeney again to discuss the recusal matter.(552)
<P>  During the same September 20th conversation with Mr. Keeney, Ms. Casey "indicated that Coleman refused to make a proffer to the office in Little Rock because he didn't trust them."(553)  Accordingly, Mr. Keeney thus advised Ms. Casey to convey to Mr. Coleman that he could make the proffer to Main Justice.(554)  Mr. Gangloff similarly testified that he understood that Ms. Casey would send a letter to Mr. Coleman to inform him that he had "recourse to Washington" and could make a proffer to Main Justice; he recalled "detailed discussions" about ensuring that Mr. Coleman knew about this option.(555) 
<P>Ms. Casey did not recall any such request by Mr. Keeney.  Although Ms. Casey did not dispute Mr. Keeney's recollection, she claimed that Mr. Keeney may have directed Mr. Johnson, not her, to relay this information to Mr. Coleman.(556)  Mr. Johnson also believed that Mr. Keeney may have suggested that he advise Mr. Coleman of Mr. Hale's recourse to Main Justice.
<P>Neither Ms. Casey nor Mr. Johnson followed Mr. Keeney's direction to inform Mr. Coleman that he had the option of dealing with Main Justice.  None of the letters that Ms. Casey or Mr. Johnson sent to Mr. Coleman on September 20 or 21, 1993 advised Mr. Coleman that he could contact directly Main Justice if he did not trust the U.S. Attorney's Office.(557)
<P>Ms. Casey and Mr. Johnson both admitted that they did not convey Mr. Keeney's message to Mr. Coleman.(558)  Mr. Coleman similarly testified that no one from the U.S. Attorney's Office ever informed him that he could speak to someone at Main Justice.(559)
<P>On September 23, 1993, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette published Hale's allegations involving President Clinton, Mr. McDougal and Governor Tucker.(560)  That same day, the grand jury indicted Mr. Hale on two counts of conspiracy and two counts relating to the submission of false statements to the SBA.(561)
<P>C.<P>Ms. Casey's declination of Criminal Referral C0004. 

<P>Even after her September 20, 1993 discussion with Mr. Keeney, Ms. Casey continued to participate actively in the Hale and Madison Guaranty investigations.  By August 20, 1993, the FBI Little Rock Field Office had opened an investigation of Mr. McDougal and Mr. Hale as a result of information developed during the investigation of Mr. Hale.(562)  In July or August of 1993, an investigation was launched involving Dean Paul, Ltd. and Castle Grande and touching on Madison Guaranty and Mr. McDougal.(563)
<P>On September 24, 1993, only four days after Mr. Keeney advised Ms. Casey to recuse herself, FBI agents met with Ms. Casey to discuss the investigation of Madison Guaranty and Mr. Hale, as well as whether Ms. Casey should recuse herself from these matters because of her close ties to Governor Tucker, Seth Ward and Stephen Smith.(564)   According to SSA Irons, he and Mr. Jackson told Ms. Casey that her "good friends" were either subjects or material witnesses of the ongoing investigations.(565)  Ms. Casey admitted that they discussed allegations involving President Clinton and the McDougals.(566)  SSA Irons indicated in a memorandum, memorializing the meeting, that Ms. Casey stated that she would need to recuse herself from the matter because of her close friendship with Governor Tucker, Mr. Ward and Mr. Smith.(567)
<P>Ms. Casey agreed with SSA Irons' account except with respect to Mr. Ward.  She testified, "I told them that if the investigations led to Governor Tucker, that I would recuse.  I don't know Seth Ward.  I am an acquaintance of Steve Smith's."(568)
<P>Yet, once again, Ms. Casey did not provide the Special Committee with any real reason for her sudden change of mind regarding her recusal.  Ms. Casey claimed that at the time of this meeting, she "realized" that the investigation had progressed to a point that "there was a real" possibility that Governor Tucker would become a subject of the investigation.(569)  Ms. Casey claimed that even though she knew that she had to recuse herself, she still had to decide the "best time" to do so.(570)  Mr. Johnson continued to urge Ms. Casey against recusal.(571)
<P>For some unknown reason, despite her conversation with Mr. Keeney only four days before, Ms. Casey did not advise officials at Main Justice that she had changed her position on recusal.(572) 
<P>In addition, on October 5, 1993, after a briefing on the Hale investigation, the Director of the FBI indicated to senior FBI officials that he wanted Ms. Casey to recuse herself.(573)
<P>For the balance of September and October, Ms. Casey took no steps to recuse herself from the Hale or Madison investigations or her office.(574)  Rather, Ms. Casey continued to participate in the investigation and, amazingly, even attended a plea negotiation meeting with Mr. Coleman on October 21, 1993.(575)  Mr. Keeney testified that once Ms. Casey had decided to recuse herself, "she should not be making any decisions with respect to the matter." (576)   Thus, as of September 24, 1993, Ms. Casey should not have participated in any way in the Hale and Madison investigations.  
<P>When pressed about her continued involvement in such matters, Ms. Casey claimed that even though she "knew I was going to recuse myself," she still wanted to wait for the receipt of the new referrals.  She explained: "If there was a case against -- if there was a case against Tucker or Steve Smith, that's what I was going to do.  And I expected those referrals to give me that."(577)
<P>On October 8, 1993, the RTC forwarded nine new criminal referrals concerning Madison Guaranty to the U.S. Attorney's Office in Little Rock.(578)  Ms. Casey reviewed the second set of referrals.(579)  According to Ms. Casey, "when the referrals came in, I probably talked with Michael again about the fact that they were there, that the names were there and I needed to recuse."(580)  Mr. Johnson still advised Ms. Casey not to recuse herself from the case.(581)
<P>Again, Ms. Casey did not contact any official at Main Justice either to notify them that Governor Tucker was a target of an investigation or to inform them of her "recusal."(582)  Ms. Casey offered no coherent reason for not advising Main Justice immediately, claiming only, "I was waiting to talk--I was going to the orientation in November.  I wanted to talk to someone at the Department of Justice whose opinion I could also trust."(583)  
<P>In September and October 1993, while Main Justice and FBI were urging Ms. Casey to recuse herself, the Little Rock U.S. Attorney's Office took no action on the first RTC Referral, number C0004.  Ms. Casey testified that when she first read Criminal Referral C0004 in late August or September of 1993, she probably noticed Governor Tucker, Mr. McDougal and President Clinton were mentioned.  But, the only action she took was to place the referral back into "the vault."(584)
<P>On October 27, 1993 -- over a year after the RTC had sent the referral to the U.S. Attorney's Office and at least two months after she first read it -- Ms. Casey formally declined prosecution on Criminal Referral C0004.(585)  It is unclear why Ms. Casey believed that it was appropriate for her to make a substantive decision on the referral when she knew that she was going to recuse herself.  Mr. Keeney testified that issuing the declination letter was a "substantive decision" that someone who supposedly had recused herself from the case should not have made.(586)
<P>Ms. Casey could not explain why she did not defer action on the first referral until after she had recused herself from the new set of referrals -- which either had already arrived at the U.S. Attorney's Office or would arrive shortly thereafter: "It was just a question of closing the books on the particular referral.  Because, in my opinion, the books had already been closed on it.  It was just a matter of relating that decision to the RTC."(587)  
<P>Even more peculiar, Ms. Casey's declination letter gave the impression that Main Justice had decided to decline the referral: "I concur with the opinion of the Department attorneys (emphasis added) that there is insufficient information in the referral to sustain many of the allegations made by the investigators or to warrant the initiation of a criminal investigation." (588)  In fact, Main Justice had not made any decision on the referral, but had returned it to the Little Rock office.  
<P>When confronted with the fact that she reviewed the March 19, 1993 memorandum from Mr. Keeney to Mr. Frazier prior to sending the declination letter, Ms. Casey admitted that she made the "decision" to decline prosecution on the referral.(589)43   Mr. Carver, Principal Deputy Chief of Fraud Section, Criminal Division, was "amazed" when he read a press article stating "Paula Casey didn't participate in the decision making with regard to C0004" because he knew she had been involved in the decision to decline the referral.(590)  Moreover, Justice Department officials testified that the referral was returned to the U.S. Attorney's Office earlier in 1993 for a decision, (591) and that Main Justice never reviewed the declination letter before Ms. Casey sent it.(592)
<P>Neither Ms. Casey nor Mr. Johnson, her First Assistant, ever reviewed the exhibits to the referral prior to declining prosecution.(593)  Mr. Carver believed that Ms. Casey should have conducted an independent review of the evidence prior to declining Criminal Referral C0004. 
<P>As of early November 1993, as Main Justice was "vigorously" pursuing allegations about Mr. Hale, the McDougals and Mr. Ward(594), Ms. Casey still had not contacted Main Justice about her recusal.  
<P>On November 3, 1993, Philip Heymann, Deputy Attorney General, called Ms. Casey to a meeting with other high ranking DOJ officials for the purpose of persuading Ms. Casey that she should recuse herself.(595)  Mr. Heymann told Ms. Casey that she should recuse herself.  This view was expressed by all Justice Department officials in attendance.(596)
<P>Even though Ms. Casey earlier explained that her reason for not recusing herself immediately after reviewing the second set of referrals was that she needed to receive advice from a Justice Department official whom she could trust, Ms. Casey told Mr. Heymann that she would "think it over" and get back to them.(597)  As of the end of the meeting, Ms. Casey still had not committed to recusal.(598)
<P>Thus, notwithstanding the advice of the Deputy Attorney General and other high-ranking Justice Department officials, Ms. Casey still waited another two days before she finally recused herself on November 5, 1993.(599)  
<P>On November 9, 1993, the day after Ms. Casey's formal recusal, Mr. Keeney announced that Donald Mackay, a career prosecutor for the Justice Department, would lead the investigation of Mr. Hale and Madison Guaranty.(600)  Mr. Mackay subsequently entered into plea negotiations with David Hale.(601)  On January 3, 1993, Mr. Mackay sent a letter to Mr. Coleman outlining what the Justice Department would require as the terms of a proffer agreement.(602)  After Special Counsel Fiske was appointed in January 1994, he entered into negotiations with Mr. Hale, and Mr. Hale entered a plea agreement on March 19, 1994.(603)

    <H2> PART II: WHITE HOUSE INTERVENTION IN FEDERAL INVESTIGATIONS</H2>
<P>Throughout the conduct of the various inquiries relating to Whitewater, Madison, and other matters relating to the Clintons, the White House engaged in a clearly discernible pattern of improper contacts, undue interference and, at times, outright obstruction with respect to the federal investigations. 
<P>The pattern of abuse began with attempts to use the resources of the White House, especially the White House Counsel's Office, to gather as much information as possible on the pending investigations.  The Office of the White House Counsel, in effect, served as Clintons' private law firm defending their personal interests.  Beyond the impropriety of such diversion of public resources, attempts by White House lawyers to obtain information compromised the integrity of the federal investigations.  
<P>The interests of the United States with respect to these investigations were potentially adverse to the private interests of the Clintons as witnesses or potential targets.  Yet, whenever possible, White House lawyers obtained confidential information relating to the progress of the investigations and prospects for prosecution.  The White House lawyers not only used the information to defend the private interests of the Clintons, but also shared the improperly obtained confidential information with the Clintons' private lawyers directly to assist in the coordinated defense effort.
I.<P>White House Contacts Relating to Investigations of Madison and David Hale.

<P>A.<P>The White House receives information on the ongoing SBA investigation of Mr. Hale.
<P>In early May 1993, SBA Associate Administrator Wayne Foren, a career SBA employee, contacted Erskine Bowles, President Clinton's nominee for SBA Administrator, to discuss the agency's ongoing investigation of Capital Management Services and David Hale.(604)  According to Mr. Foren, he called Mr. Bowles on May 3, 4 or 5 -- right before Mr. Bowles' confirmation.(605)  Mr. Foren contacted Mr. Bowles because Mr. Hale, the president of CMS, had claimed to have access to President Clinton, Governor Jim Guy Tucker, and Arkansas Senator Dale Bumpers, then the chairman of the Senate Small Business Committee.(606)
<P>Mr. Foren realized the sensitivity of the matter and, accordingly, concluded that the only means to answer questions he had about the operations of CMS was to make "a referral to the Office of the Inspector General so that they could proceed on an investigation and in an attempt to obtain the information."(607)  According to Mr. Foren, "[k]nowing that Erskine's confirmation hearing was imminent, I felt it was appropriate that he be briefed on this issue."(608)  After Mr. Foren told Mr. Bowles about the case, Mr. Bowles "agreed that the transfer [of the case to the Inspector General] should occur prior to the confirmation and that he wanted a briefing paper."(609)  Mr. Foren referred the matter to the Inspector General on May 5, 1993.(610)
<P>At Mr. Bowles' instruction, Mr. Foren then prepared a briefing paper entitled "Capital Management Services, Inc, Little Rock, Arkansas, License No. 06/06-5207."(611)  The document outlined David Hale's 1992 application for additional funds from the SBA and stated that the value of the donated assets Mr. Hale used to justify additional funds from the SBA was "questionable."(612)  The briefing paper noted that "the matter has been referred to the Inspector General for investigation."(613)  Mr. Foren provided the briefing paper to Kris Swedin, the SBA's Assistant Administrator for Congressional Relations.(614)  In Mr. Foren's view, the Hale investigation was "very sensitive" and "very important."(615)
<P>On May 7, 1993, Mr. Bowles was confirmed as SBA Administrator.(616)  After Mr. Bowles' confirmation, Mr. Bowles advised Mr. Foren that he had briefed White House Chief of Staff, Thomas "Mack" McLarty, a longtime friend of the President, on the status of the CMS case.(617)  Mr. Foren advised his deputy, Charles Shepperson, of Mr. Bowles' communication of information to Mr. McLarty.(618)  Mr. Shepperson confirmed this account:
<P>My recollection was that Wayne had come back from a meeting with Mr. Bowles on a subject I can't remember, he had come back and said that Erskine had taken him aside and indicated that he had spoken to Mr. McLarty, and that Mr. McLarty had indicated that we should just do what you normally do in situations like this.(619)
<P>Mr. Bowles testified that he could not specifically deny Mr. Foren's and Mr. Shepperson's account, although Mr. Bowles could not recall Mr. Foren briefing him on CMS in May 1993.(620)  He recalled that Mr. Foren and others briefed him at the Old Executive Office Building on SBA programs; he was not certain of the date, but believed that the briefing did not occur between May 4 and May 7.(621)  He remembered at some point being told that the Hale/CMS matter had been referred to the Inspector General or the Justice Department.(622)  He did not recall seeing the briefing paper that Mr. Foren used to brief him in May 1993.(623)
<P>In addition, Mr. Bowles did not recall advising Mr. Foren that he had spoken with Mr. McLarty about the CMS referral.(624)  Mr. Bowles recalled, however, that he saw Mr. McLarty on the morning of his confirmation hearing, when he visited the White House.(625)  Indeed, Mr. McLarty's schedule for May 6, 1993, contained the following entry:  "Erskine Bowles & his family will be touring the West Wing and will be stopping in very briefly to say hello some time around 8:45-9:00 a.m."(626)
<P>More important, Mr. Bowles saw Mr. McLarty on May 7, 1993, the date of his confirmation.  According to Mr. Bowles, "I saw Mack again, I believe on the 7th, the day I was actually confirmed by the Senate.  And at that time, I went over there to get my marching orders, how should I go forward, how should I report, what do I do."(627)  Mr. McLarty's schedule for May 7, 1993 confirmed that, at 1:00 p.m., he had a meeting with Mr. Bowles.(628)  Yet, Mr. Bowles denied that he discussed not discuss CMS with Mr. McLarty.  "I don't believe I've ever discussed Capital Management with Mack McLarty."(629)
<P>On May 19, 1993, Mr. Foren again briefed Mr. Bowles on CMS, when the SBA initiated foreclosure and liquidation proceedings against Capital Management.(630)  According to Mr. Foren, "[t]he event that occurred between the 5th and the 19th was an event where Capital Management defaulted on debentures, and we were then going to proceed to foreclose collateral and throw the company into liquidation."(631)  Mr. Foren provided Mr. Bowles with a revised version of his earlier briefing paper, entitled "Capital Management Services, Inc, Little Rock, Arkansas, License No. 06/06-5207, May 19, 1993."(632)
<P>On August 5, 1993, Mr. Shepperson received a copy of a draft indictment of Mr. Hale from the U.S. Attorney's Office in Little Rock.(633)  He sent the draft indictment to Mr. Foren.(634)  On August 9, Mr. Foren sent yet another memorandum to Mr. Bowles on the progress of the investigation and attached a copy of the draft indictment to the memorandum.(635)  The memorandum, designated "Privileged and Confidential," was signed by Mr. Foren and Deputy General Counsel Martin D. Teckler and addressed to Erskine Bowles.(636)
<P>Mr. Bowles did not recall receiving Mr. Foren's August 9 memorandum,(637) although "Wayne very well could have sent it to me."(638)
<P>In September 1993, Mr. Foren provided another briefing to Mr. Bowles about the Hale/CMS investigation, this time to advise him that Mr. Hale's indictment was imminent.(639)  Mr. Foren also provided Mr. Bowles with a memorandum,(640) dated September 21, 1993, advising that on September 20, 1993, the SBA had closed CMS's bank accounts and seized its assets.(641)  The memorandum further advised that the U.S. Attorney's office is "scheduled to make a presentation to the Grand Jury on Tuesday, September 21, 1993, at 3:00 p.m. and [is] expecting indictments to be returned on Tuesday or Wednesday, September 21 or September 22, 1993 against Judge Hale and two other individuals."(642)
<P>Mr. Bowles did not recall receiving multiple briefings or memoranda from Mr. Foren on the Hale/CMS investigation, although he admitted to receiving the May 1993 briefing and a later briefing by Martin Teckler, the Deputy General Counsel of the SBA.(643)  According to Mr. Bowles, in September 1993, Mr. Teckler "told me that we were getting ready to indict Judge Hale down in Arkansas for defrauding the SBA, and said that I might want to call the White House and give them a heads-up."(644)  Mr. Bowles asked Mr. Teckler to describe a "heads-up,"(645)  and Mr. Teckler told him "it was simply notification in case they got some inquiries."(646)  Mr. Bowles claimed that he questioned the propriety of such notification, and Mr. Teckler replied that "it was standard."(647)  Although Mr. Bowles told Mr. Teckler he would give a "heads up" to the White House, Mr. Bowles maintained that he never called the "White House" about the case.  He explained:
<P>I was often asked to take things to the White House.  I often said I'll take care of it.  Sometimes I felt the right way to take care of it was to throw it in the trash can.  Sometimes it was to call somebody lower down.  Sometimes it was to call somebody higher up.  Sometimes I did it, sometimes I didn't.  I just made a judgment.(648)

<P>In November 1993, Mr. Bowles claimed that he learned from news accounts that Mr. Hale alleged that, in 1986, then-Governor Clinton had pressured Mr. Hale into making an illegal SBA loan to Susan McDougal.(649)  After hearing of this allegation, Mr. Bowles decided to recuse himself from the case.  He communicated this decision orally to General Counsel John Spotila, but did not memorialize his recusal in writing until months later, on March 3, 1994.(650)  In fact, Mr. Spotila continued to provide Mr. Bowles with information concerning the Hale/CMS investigation in the weekly SBA Administrator's report through June 27, 1994, more than six months after Mr. Bowles purportedly decided to recuse himself from the CMS/Hale matter.(651)
<P>On April 11, 1994, Mr. Bowles responded to an inquiry by Congresswoman Jan Meyers, then the Ranking Member of the House Committee on Small Business, about his recusal from the CMS investigation.(652)  Mr. Bowles advised that he had verbally recused himself from the matter in late fall 1993, and had memorialized this decision in writing on March 4, 1994.(653)  Mr. Bowles specifically claimed: "I have never reviewed the Capital Management file."(654)  The assertion was contradicted by Mr. Bowles' own admission that he was occasionally briefed on the CMS/Hale investigation.(655)  Mr. Foren believed that Mr. Bowles, as a practical matter, was knowledgeable about what was in the file.(656)  When asked about the seeming discrepancy between his letter to Congresswoman Meyers and his testimony, Mr. Bowles maintained that his statement to Congresswoman Meyers was accurate: "I hadn't reviewed the file.  I hadn't studied the file.  I hadn't spent a long time going over it."(657)
<P>B.<P>Mr. Hale's lawyers contact the White House about Mr. Hale's "mutual interest" with President Clinton.
<P>On August 20, 1993, the Little Rock Field Office notified FBI Headquarters that the RTC planned to submit new referrals on Madison Guaranty.(658)  Special Agent Steven Irons advised Headquarters that "Assistant United States Attorney assigned to the matter reported being told a Little Rock Attorney had traveled to Washington instant date to meet with unknown officials to attempt to have the investigation quashed." (659)  Mr. Irons testified that Fletcher Jackson told him that Richard Mayes, a Little Rock attorney had traveled to Washington to get the Hale investigation quashed.(660)  Mr. Irons advised FBI Headquarters to "be alert if someone within the Department asked some questions about the Hale case or the upcoming Madison referrals," and in particular a close associate of President Clinton, Webster Hubbell, now the third highest official in the Department.(661)   
<P>Mr. Hubbell had lunch or dinner with Mr. Mayes once or twice between January and September 1993.(662)  Mr. Mayes denied that he talked to Mr. Hubbell about the David Hale investigation or indictment.(663)
<P>On August 17, 1993, in the middle of the SBA's and the Justice Department's investigations into Capital Management and David Hale, Randy Coleman, Mr. Hale's attorney, called Associate Counsel to the President William Kennedy to advise the White House that the ongoing federal investigations might pose problems for President Clinton.(664)  Mr. Coleman told Mr. Kennedy that he wanted to talk about "the mutual interests of our clients."(665)
<P>  The conversation was brief.(666)  Mr. Coleman told Mr. Kennedy that the FBI had raided Mr. Hale's CMS office and confiscated records containing information on the Clintons, Governor Tucker, the McDougals, Whitewater and Madison.(667)  Mr. Coleman told Mr. Kennedy that if Heidi Fleiss was the "madam to the stars, David Hale was the lender to the political elite in Arkansas."(668) 
<P>Mr. Kennedy's notes indicate that Mr. Coleman mentioned President Clinton and Governor Tucker.44  
<P>Mr. Kennedy was familiar with Madison and Whitewater from his work at Rose Law Firm and from his understanding of the Clintons' circle of friends.(669)
<P>Mr. Coleman and Mr. Kennedy had different recollections of the conclusion of the conversation.  Mr. Coleman testified that after outlining some of the names contained in Mr. Hale's files,(670) he informed Mr. Kennedy that he would be meeting with SBA officials in Washington, D.C., the next week and could also meet with Mr. Kennedy to discuss the matter further.(671)  According to Mr. Coleman, Mr. Kennedy then asked him whether there was anything that he wanted him to do.(672)  Mr. Coleman responded, "I said I'm just trying to figure out where everybody is on this matter, and he said that he would visit with his clients and get back to me.(673)
<P>Mr. Coleman did not expect Mr. Kennedy to do anything "helpful" for Mr. Hale.(674)  Instead, Mr. Coleman contacted Mr. Kennedy because the investigation might involve "folks other than just my client, and where that was the case it was always my habit to start making contact with attorneys for other people who might be involved to see where everybody stood and what the landscape looked like."(675)  Mr. Coleman also believed that he might be able to confirm Mr. Hale's suspicion that "there were some folks in the executive branch that wouldn't be, oh, looking out for his best interests."(676)  Mr. Coleman wanted to make a "provocative phone" call because White House officials "had shown a propensity to make an ill-advised phone call or two in times past." (677)
<P>Mr. Kennedy had a different recollection of key elements of the phone call.  First, he denied offering to do anything for Mr. Coleman.(678)  Instead, he claimed that he was "uncomfortable" talking to Mr. Coleman because he thought that Mr. Coleman might be seeking improper involvement on the part of the White House.(679)  Mr. Kennedy said that "I told him I wasn't sure I could talk to him, but I would inquire and get back to him."(680)
<P>The last entry in Mr. Kennedy's notes of the telephone call, however, appears to corroborate Mr. Coleman's testimony: "*Ask for anything."(681)  Mr. Kennedy claimed that he did not know what he meant by this entry.(682)  Mr. Kennedy's notes do not indicate that Mr. Coleman was "looking" for something or expected Mr. Kennedy to do something "helpful" for Mr. Hale.(683)
<P>Second, Mr. Kennedy denied saying that he had to get back to his "clients" -- presumably President and Mrs. Clinton.(684)  But Mr. Coleman vividly remembered that Mr. Kennedy said "clients" in the plural because the reference struck him as odd since the entire discussion up to that point had been in terms of their respective individual clients.(685)
<P>After the telephone call, Mr. Kennedy spoke to Mr. Nussbaum.(686)  Mr. Kennedy claimed that he was concerned that it would be inappropriate for him to engage in any substantive discussion with Mr. Coleman.(687)  Mr. Nussbaum agreed,(688) and instructed Mr. Kennedy to tell Mr. Coleman that the White House could not help him -- but, somewhat inconsistently, also to find out "a little more about what was going on."(689)
<P>Two days later, on August 19, 1993, Mr. Kennedy contacted Mr. Coleman.(690)  Mr. Kennedy asked Associate White House Counsel Beth Nolan to listen to the conversation.(691)  According to Mr. Coleman, this conversation lasted five or ten minutes.(692)  Mr. Coleman testified that Mr. Kennedy wanted to know more specific information about the investigation.(693)  Mr. Coleman recalled that Mr. Kennedy particularly wanted to know whether Mr. Hale was trying to "negotiate" with the U.S. Attorney's Office(694) and would allege any "face-to-face meetings" with the President.(695)
<P>Mr. Kennedy claimed that he essentially told Mr. Coleman at the beginning of the call that he could not assist him.(696)<P>
<P>But Mr. Kennedy's and Ms. Nolan's respective notes of the conversation clearly indicate that Mr. Kennedy was "engaged in a discussion during which [Kennedy] asked [Coleman] a series of questions including, among other things, what was the anticipation of what David Hale would be charged with, where was this going to go, a conversation in which among other names mentioned were Whitewater Development and Jim Guy Tucker with which were familiar."(697)  Mr. Kennedy also admitted that he sought to obtain information about the extent to which Mr. Hale was connected to Madison.(698)
<P>The notes of Ms. Nolan and Mr. Kennedy both indicate that Madison and Whitewater were discussed in detail.(699)  Mr. Kennedy's notes appear as the following: 
<P>"Nature of Investigation - propriety of loans made 
<P><P><P><P>  past few years 

<P>     Informed that are loan transactions that relate <BR>
     to Madison Guaranty<BR></P>

<P>     All records liquidation of SBIC<BR>
          Both of them's names cropped up <BR></P>

<P>     Whitewater Development Corp.: not stopping <BR>
                         w/ David Hale <BR></P>

<P>     Xactions:   Southloop<BR>
              Castle Grande Water."(700) <BR></P>

Mr. Kennedy claimed that he did not know at the time that Southloop and Castle Grande were Tucker real estate projects financed by Madison.(701)  Ms. Nolan's notes also indicate that Mr. Kennedy asked Mr. Coleman whether bad loans were "parked" at Madison:
<P>BK: You mean Madison have parked bad loans w/ David?
<P>RC: Yep. You bet .... The Madison deal is coming back to life.(702)

Ms. Nolan's notes indicate that Mr. Coleman told Mr. Kennedy that "they're not stopping at Whitewater, I can guarantee you that." (703)
<P>Mr. Kennedy offered no explanation for his returned call to Mr. Coleman other than to admit that he sought "to know a little bit more before" he definitively could decide the propriety of other discussions.(704)  Mr. Kennedy explained, "I didn't think we would be able to help him, but I couldn't respond sort of fully until I knew a little bit more about what he was talking about, and he opened up a little bit."(705)
<P>Although Mr. Kennedy claimed that he did not ask Mr. Coleman about plea negotiations or whether Mr. Hale would allege any "face-to-face meetings" with President Clinton,(706)  Ms. Nolan's notes indicate that the U.S. Attorney's office is "going to know about mtgs. taking place."(707)  
<P>Mr. Kennedy's notes indicate that he discussed the President and Mrs. Clinton with Mr. Coleman: "All records liquidation w/SBIC [arrow] both of them's names cropped up Whitewater Development Corp.: Not stopping w/David Hale."(708)  Ms. Nolan's notes also contain the following entry: "your C's name has cropped up [arrow] both of 'em, Whitewater Develop. Corp."(709)  Mr. Kennedy denied that "both" refers to the President and Mrs. Clinton.(710)
<P>Ms. Nolan's notes specifically indicate that at the end of the conversation Mr. Kennedy thanked Mr. Coleman for the "head's up."(711)
<P>After the second telephone conversation, Mr. Kennedy again briefed Mr. Nussbaum.(712)  Mr. Kennedy claimed that he told Mr. Nussbaum that he had never heard of "the stuff" in connection with Whitewater during the campaign and that, as a result, Hale's allegations were not credible.(713)  Mr. Kennedy claimed that he did nothing other than to report Mr. Coleman's information to Mr. Nussbaum.(714)  Mr. Kennedy maintained that Mr. Nussbaum took no further action.(715)  Mr. Kennedy denied that he ever told President Clinton or Mrs. Clinton or anyone else at the White House.(716) 
<P>Bruce Lindsey, then Director of Presidential Personnel, claimed that he first learned of Mr. Kennedy's conversations with Mr. Coleman from New York Times reporter Jeff Gerth.(717)  Mr. Lindsey then sought confirmation,(718) and Mr. Kennedy told Mr. Lindsey that Mr. Coleman had told him that he "had a client who had mutual interests" and suggested that they discuss the matter.(719)  Mr. Lindsey understood the "client" to be President Clinton.(720)
<P>C.<P>The White House obtains more information about the Hale investigation.
<P>In late August or early September, Mr. Kennedy advised then-Associate Attorney General Webster Hubbell of the Coleman phone call.(721)  Mr. Hubbell's phone log indicates he had a ten-minute conversation with Mr. Kennedy on August 18th.(722)  According to Mr. Hubbell, Mr. Kennedy wanted to know whether he had learned of any connection between Mr. Hale and Madison and James McDougal.(723)  Mr. Hubbell mistakenly told Mr. Kennedy there was no connection; Mr. Hubbell later remembered that he had become aware of such a connection in the course of representing the RTC in litigation against Madison's former accountants.(724)
<P>Mr. Kennedy claimed that in the course of a conversation with Mr. Hubbell about another matter, "I simply asked him had he heard the name David Hale in connection with Whitewater, and he said no, and that was the sum and source of it."(725)  Mr. Kennedy claimed that he asked Mr. Hubbell about the Hale matter because he knew that Mr. Hubbell was familiar with the Whitewater issue from the 1992 presidential campaign.(726)45 
<P>On September 20, 1993, Jeff Gerth met with Senior White House officials Bruce Lindsey and Mark Gearan, and conveyed the same information.(727)  Mr. Gerth told Mr. Lindsey and Mr. Gearan that Mr. Hale alleged that he had three meetings with then-Governor Clinton in 1985 and 1986.  According to Mr. Gerth, prior to meeting with Governor Clinton, Mr. Hale had several meetings with Mr. Tucker and Mr. McDougal.(728)  Mr. McDougal told Mr. Hale that Madison Guaranty was strapped for cash and scheduled to be audited, and that "friends in the political family needed help."(729)
<P>At the first meeting, on the steps of the Arkansas Capitol, Governor Clinton allegedly approached Mr. Hale and said something like "are you going to be able to help Jim and I out? . . . I would really appreciate it."(730) 
<P>The second meeting allegedly took place at Mr. McDougal's trailer office at the Castle Grande land development.(731)  Governor Clinton, who was dressed in a jogging outfit, and Mr. McDougal asked Mr. Hale to make a loan from CMS to "clean up the books" at Madison Guaranty.(732)  Governor Clinton warned Mr. Hale that his name could not "show up anywhere," but that he might be able to provide security for the loan with some property in Marion County -- the county where Whitewater was located.(733)
<P>Mr. Gerth then explained that Mr. Hale subsequently made a $300,000 SBA loan to Susan McDougal d/b/a Master Marketing on April 3, 1986.(734)  Mr. Hale understood that some of the money would be advanced to Whitewater.  Indeed, records show that a portion of the proceeds from the loan was used by Whitewater to purchase land from International Paper Corporation in 1986.(735)  
<P>At the third meeting, then-Governor Clinton allegedly saw Mr. Hale at a Little Rock shopping mall and asked him "Have you heard what that f------ w---- Susan has done with the money?"(736)  Mr. Gearan and Mr. Lindsey both claimed that Mr. Gerth was the first to tell them of Mr. Hale's allegations against President Clinton.(737)  Both senior White House officials further asserted that they learned for the first time of Mr. Kennedy's telephone calls with Mr. Coleman a month earlier.(738)
<P>After the meeting with Mr. Gerth, Mr. Lindsey asked President Clinton about Mr. Hale's allegations.  The President denied that any of the meetings occurred.(739)
<P>On the same day, Mr. Lindsey called James Blair, the General Counsel of Tyson Food and a close associate of the President, twice to discuss Whitewater.(740)  Mr. Lindsey's contemporaneous notes of the first conversation indicate that Mr. Blair had previously contacted  Mr. Heuer, Mr. McDougal's attorney, to discuss whether Mr. McDougal would be implicated in any case against Mr. Hale.  Specifically, the notes indicate that Mr. Heuer "asked Brent Bumpers [Assistant United States Attorney for EDAR] ...whether indictment against Hale, not McDougal."(741)  Mr. Lindsey's notes of the second conversation shows: "Fletcher Jackson-in charge of case-immunity leaked. McDougal might become target. Blair Heard that $300,000 had been deposited in McDougal's account, jumped pretty high."(742)  Mr. Lindsey could not interpret these entries in his notes, and particularly the notation "jumped pretty high."(743)<P>    
<P>Mr. Blair had no recollection of speaking with Mr. Lindsey, but admitted that they may have discussed David Hale.(744)46   He also could not recall any conversation with Mr. Heuer about whether Mr. McDougal would be indicted along with Mr. Hale, but admitted "[t]hat's certainly a possibility.  I have discussed with Heuer at times whether McDougal was actually going to be reindicted after his first acquittal."(745)  When asked whether he relayed the results of any conversation with Mr. Heuer back to the White House or elsewhere, Mr. Blair carefully claimed, "I don't have any recollection of that.  I'm not saying if I didn't hear something interesting, I might not have passed it on to Bruce Lindsey, but I have no specific recollection of that."(746) 
<P>When asked about any conversation between Mr. Heuer and Assistant U.S. Attorney Bumpers about the indictment of Hale, Mr. Blair professed that he did not "know anything about any conversations between Mr. Heuer and Mr. Bumpers."(747)  Mr. Blair claimed that Mr. Lindsey's notes did not refresh his recollection.(748)
<P>Although Mr. Bumpers did not recall Mr. Heuer asking whether Mr. McDougal would be indicted with Mr. Hale,(749)  Mr. Bumpers may have had a brief conversation with another Assistant U.S. Attorney, Fletcher Jackson about Mr. Hale investigation prior to Mr. Hale's indictment.(750)  Mr. Bumpers also may have learned of the imminent indictment at a staff meeting.(751)<P> 
<P>The Special Committee was not able to depose Mr. Heuer because he was preparing for Mr. McDougal's criminal trial.  Messrs. Blair and Bumpers could neither confirm nor deny that any of these conversations occurred.  Mr. Lindsey's contemporaneous notes of his conversation with Mr. Blair immediately following Mr. Lindsey's conversation with Mr. Gerth about Mr. Hale's allegations against President Clinton indicate that Mr. Heuer received confidential information about the ongoing federal investigation of Mr. Hale, and that this confidential information was passed on to Mr. Blair and Mr. Lindsey.(752) 

After Treasury and RTC Officials improperly advised the White House about RTC Referrals mentioning President Clinton and Governor Tucker, President Clinton meets with Governor Tucker at the White House.
<P>Attempts by senior White House officials to gather information about investigations touching on the Clintons went beyond contacts with potentially adverse counsel (Mr. Coleman) or with close associates (Mr. Blair).  Senior White House officials undertook a concerted and highly improper effort to contact investigative agencies about the ongoing investigations into Madison and Whitewater.
<P>During the period when the submission of the additional RTC referrals on Madison prepared by Ms. Lewis was being held up by the "legal review" by the RTC's Professional Liability Section, the White House received advance information on these referrals.  At about the same time that the White House learned of Mr. Hale's allegations against President Clinton, on September 29, 1993, Jean Hanson, the General Counsel of the Department of Treasury, which oversaw the RTC and its investigations, informed White House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum and Associate White House Counsel Clifford Sloan of the existence of several RTC referrals involving Madison, Whitewater, and the Clintons.(753)
<P>This improper transmittal of confidential RTC information to the White House violated clearly established RTC procedures.  In a June 17, 1993 memorandum to all RTC attorneys and investigative staff on the handling of criminal referrals, RTC Director of Investigations James Dudine wrote: "All criminal referrals are sensitive and must be handled with appropriate confidentiality and care."(754)  Mr. Dudine advised that criminal referrals derived from records of financial institutions are also subject to the restrictions of the Right to Financial Privacy Act, 12 U.S.C &#167;3412.(755)  William H. Roelle, the RTC Senior Vice President in charge of the Investigations Division,(756) testified that, based on his 25-years of experience with the FDIC and RTC, both the substance and the fact of a criminal referral are confidential.(757)  There is no exception for press inquiries.(758)
<P>The Treasury General Counsel, Jean Hanson, improperly conveyed the confidential RTC information about the Madison criminal referrals to the White House.(759)  Specifically, Ms. Hanson advised Mr. Nussbaum that the President and Mrs. Clinton were identified as possible witnesses to the suspected criminal activities described in the referrals.(760)  She further told Mr. Nussbaum that the referrals referenced possible improper campaign contributions from Madison to one of Mr. Clinton's gubernatorial campaigns.(761)  Mr. Nussbaum admitted that Ms. Hanson provided him with nonpublic information about the referrals.(762)
<P>The next day, on September 30, Ms. Hanson called Mr. Sloan to amplify on the confidential information she had provided to Mr. Nussbaum.(763)  Mr. Sloan's notes of this conversation recorded the following: 
<P><P>"9 referrals--allegations re: Fulbright--

               *  Jim Guy Tucker <BR>
               *  attempt to divert funds."(764)<BR>
Mr. Sloan's notes further stated that the charges of conspiracy to divert funds were the "most serious allegation[s],"(765) that the referrals named the Clinton 1985 campaign as "co-conspirators,"(766) and, most important, that the "Clintons [were] mentioned in other charges as potential witnesses."(767)
<P>Mr. Nussbaum instructed Mr. Sloan to relay Ms. Hanson's information to then-Director of Presidential Personnel Bruce Lindsey, who was not a member of the press office, but rather a "damage control" specialist.(768)  Mr. Sloan did so on the same day, September 30, or shortly thereafter.(769)  Inexplicably, Mr. Lindsey claimed that Mr. Sloan did not advise him that Governor Tucker was named in the referrals as a target.(770)  Instead, Mr. Lindsey asserted that he did not learn that Governor Tucker was mentioned in the referrals until October 7 or 8, 1993.(771)
<P>On October 4 or 5, 1993, Mr. Lindsey passed the confidential RTC information directly to the President.(772)  When asked about the President's response, Mr. Lindsey claimed implausibly that "it was certainly nothing other than just sort of, `hmmmmmmm.'"(773)
<P>Curiously, on October 6, 1993, President Clinton had a meeting at the White House with Governor Jim Guy Tucker.(774)  Former Deputy Assistant to the President Keith Mason testified that he attended this meeting,(775) which was held late in the afternoon and lasted 30 to 45 minutes.(776)  Mr. Mason asserted that no discussions occurred at the meeting about Whitewater, Madison or RTC criminal referrals.(777)  Prior to the meeting, Mr. Mason escorted Governor Tucker to the office of White House Chief of Staff Mack McLarty.(778)  Mr. Mason was present during part, but not all, of a meeting between Governor Tucker and Mr. McLarty.(779)  Mr. Mason claimed that at least while he was present Governor Tucker and Mr. McLarty did not discuss Madison Guaranty, the RTC criminal referrals or Whitewater.(780)
<P>Although Mr. Lindsey testified that he did not know that the criminal referrals mentioned Governor Tucker as of October 6 and therefore did not pass this information onto the President, such information hardly would have been necessary.  Notes taken by Susan Thomases during the 1992 campaign indicate that President Clinton had clear knowledge of the link between Whitewater and Governor Tucker.  In notes taken of a February 22, 1992 conversation relating to Whitewater, Ms. Thomases wrote: 
<P><P>"Have Gerth call Tucker
<P><P>BC tell me to call Tucker"(781)
On March 9, 1992, Jeff Gerth of the New York Times wrote to Ms. Thomases seeking additional information for his article on Whitewater and Madison.  In the margin of the letter, Ms. Thomases had taken notes, apparently of a conversation with Bill Clinton.47   In one such note, next to Mr. Gerth's allegation that Mr. McDougal was subsidizing the Clintons' interest in the Whitewater investment, Ms. Thomases wrote: "Call Jim Guy Tucker."(782)  Tellingly, as of the date of Ms. Thomases' notes, there had been no public allegation suggesting any link between Mr. Tucker and Whitewater, Madison, or Mr. McDougal.
<P>The Special Committee did not obtain testimony from Governor Tucker because he, along with James and Susan McDougal, was a defendant in a federal criminal proceeding.  The Whitewater-related charges prosecuted by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr in the Tucker-McDougal trial stemmed directly from the RTC criminal referrals prepared by Ms. Lewis--the substance of which was conveyed from Ms. Hanson, through Mr. Sloan and Mr. Lindsey, to President Clinton.  On May 28, 1996, an Arkansas jury convicted Governor Tucker of conspiracy and mail fraud in connection with transactions involving Mr. McDougal and Mr. Hale; President Clinton testified as a defense witness in the trial.(783)
<P>On October 8, 1993, the RTC Professional Liability Section completed its legal review of the criminal referrals.(784)  On the same day, the criminal referrals were transmitted to the U.S. Attorney's Office in Little Rock without any change from their original versions prepared by Ms. Lewis.(785)<P>
<P>On October 14, 1993, senior White House officials met again in Mr. Nussbaum's office with senior officials from the Department of Treasury to discuss the criminal referrals.(786)  Mr. Lindsey, Mr. Nussbaum, Mr. Sloan, Associate White House Counsel Neil Eggleston and White House Director of Communications Mark Gearan met with Ms. Hanson, Department of Treasury Chief of Staff Joshua Steiner and Assistant Secretary of Treasury for Public Affairs Jack DeVore.(787)  Mr. Devore testified that it "appear[ed] that someone in either Nussbaum's or Hanson's office called my secretary and asked her to schedule this meeting."(788)  During the meeting, Mr. DeVore explained to the group that he had received press inquiries about the criminal referrals, and a detailed description of the criminal referrals ensued.  In a memorandum to file, entitled "Whitewater Development Corporation,"(789) Mr. Lindsey indicated that one of the referrals "involved four cashiers checks -- each for $3,000, two made payable to the Clinton for Governor Campaign and two made payable to Bill Clinton."(790)  Mr. Lindsey further wrote that "DeVore confirmed with the RTC that the referrals had been received in the Washington office, but had already forwarded on to the Little Rock U.S. Attorney's office."(791)

III.<P>A Pivotal Event: The November 5, 1993 Meeting Between White House Officials and the Clintons' Private Lawyers.
<P>November 5, 1993, armed with details of the confidential RTC criminal referrals and Mr. Hale's allegations against President Clinton, senior White House officials met with the Clintons' private lawyers.  The stated purpose of this meeting was "to impart information to the Clinton's personal lawyers."(792)  The White House officials in attendance were Mr. Eggleston, Mr. Lindsey, Mr. Nussbaum, and Associate White House Counsel William Kennedy.(793)  The private lawyers were David Kendall of Williams & Connolly, Little Rock attorney Steven Engstrom, and James Lyons, the author of the Clinton campaign's 1992 Whitewater report.(794)  According to Mr. Lindsey, who characterized the gathering as a legal defense meeting, "[t]he purpose of the meeting was Whitewater Development Corporation."(795)  
<P>Mr. Kennedy's notes of the meeting, which the Committee obtained after a protracted dispute with the White House,(796) indicated that the White House officials provided the Clintons' private lawyers with much of the information they possessed concerning Whitewater, including confidential information relating to ongoing investigations by the SBA, RTC, and Justice Department.(797)  In essence, the White House officials used confidential information they gained by virtue of their positions of public trust to further the Clintons' private legal defense.
<P>A significant part of the discussion related to the ongoing RTC investigation of Madison.(798)  Among the principal topics of the meeting was the referral related to illegal contributions to Mr. Clinton's gubernatorial campaign.(799)48   Coincidentally, Mr. Lindsey, in his October 20 memorandum, appeared to be particularly concerned about one of the referrals, which "involved four cashier checks -- each for $3,000, two made payable to the Clinton for Governor Campaign and two made to Bill Clinton."  Mr. Kennedy claimed, however, that Mr. Lindsey indicated during the meeting that the source of the information was press accounts: "Basically, that Bruce is outlining, sort of the allegations, that the press was reporting wherein the referrals."(800)
<P>White House officials also discussed the fact that Governor Tucker was a target of the referrals.  In two separate entries, Mr. Kennedy wrote "Could be that JGT is target of RTC referral"(801) and "RTC-people trying to get BC and JGT."(802)  Mr. Lindsey testified that he first learned that Mr. Tucker was a target in the RTC investigation during the October 14 meeting with RTC officials: "I believe in the October 14th meeting that we had with certain people from the Treasury Department, that they indicated that Jeff Gerth had indicated that to them."(803)  Notes taken by Susan Thomases indicate, however, that at least President Clinton identified Mr. Tucker with Whitewater in February and March 1992.  In notes taken from a February 22, 1992 conversation relating to Whitewater, Ms. Thomases wrote: 
<P><P>"Have Gerth call Tucker
<P><P>BC tell me to call Tucker"(804)
Likewise, Ms. Thomases' notes, apparently of a conversation with then-Governor Clinton, taken on a March 9, 1992 letter from Mr. Gerth seeking information on Whitewater recorded: "Call Jim Guy Tucker."(805)  Mr. Tucker's ties to the McDougal and to Madison had not been publicized at the time.
<P>Another principal topic of discussion raised by Mr. Lindsey was Madison's retention of the Rose Law Firm and Mrs. Clinton's representation of Madison in connection with Madison's proposal for a preferred stock offering.(806)49   Mr. Kennedy testified that Mr. Lindsey "[i]s giving history, and it's basically that she has given authority for Madison to do both things, and Bruce is talking about, you know, the perception about Beverly Bassett."(807)  Under "Beverly Basset," Mr. Kennedy wrote: "too much coziness."(808) 
<P>Although senior White House officials' claimed that they communicated only general background information concerning Whitewater and Madison during the November 5th meeting, Mr. Kennedy's notes detail the financing of the Clintons' investment in Whitewater.  Almost four pages of Mr. Kennedy's notes relate to the reconstruction of the Whitewater loans and transactions.(809)  The attendees were particularly interested, according to Mr. Kennedy's notes, in James Blair's involvement in the sale of the Clintons' interest in Whitewater in 1992,50  as well as Mr. Blair's possible involvement in Christopher Wade's payment of the outstanding bank loan on which the Clintons were guarantors.51   Mr. Blair had provided James McDougal with the $1000 to purchase the Clintons' Whitewater stock on December 22, 1992.(810)  The senior White House officials and the Clintons' private lawyers also discussed tax issues related to the Clintons' investment in Whitewater,52  and the chain of custody of certain Whitewater records that were used during the 1992 campaign to piece together specifics of the Clintons' investment.53 
<P>Curiously, a notation at the bottom of the first page of Mr. Kennedy's notes suggested a possible link between the FBI's investigation of CMS, which allegedly made an illegal loan to James and Susan McDougal in 1986 at the request of then-Governor Clinton, and the death of President Clinton's friend and counsel, Vincent Foster.  Mr. Kennedy wrote:
<P>"July 20th:<P>FBI issued subpena & took records of 
<P><P><P>municipal judge named Hale

<P><P><P>Also the day that VF killed himself 
<P><P><P>Factor"(811)
Mr. Kennedy claimed that "by factor" he meant: "Simply that the coincidence had become a factor in all of the intense speculation surrounding Vince's suicide."(812)
<P>The November 5th meeting also concerned "a division of labor between personal and White House counsel for handling future Whitewater issues."(813)
<P>In the middle of Mr. Kennedy's notes appears a cryptic reference to a remark by Mr. Kennedy that suggests the possibility of an effort to suppress critical evidence concerning Whitewater.(814)  Mr. Kennedy wrote: 
<P><P>"Vacuum    Rose law Files<P>WWDC Docs - subpoena<BR>
                 *Documents - never know go out  <BR>
                         Quietly(?)"(815) <BR><BR>
     Mr. Kennedy claimed to the Special Committee that "vacuum" was used in this meeting as a noun, not a verb:
<P>We were referring to at the meeting that there was an information vacuum, that when you tried [to] get your arms around Whitewater, in this case referring to the real estate investment, it is impossible to do.  The records were a shambles.  I had personal knowledge of that.  You are dealing with an information vacuum.  The Rose Law files, as they related to Whitewater documents, would--if you had gotten you hands on them, they would not have meant anything to you because of the condition of the records."(816)
<P>Mr. Kennedy denied that the entry "WWDC Docs - subpoena" reflected the concern of senior White House officials over the possibility that Whitewater records might be subpoenaed.(817)  Instead, Mr. Kennedy claimed:"The discussion was that if a subpoena were issued, files that had once been at the Rose Law Firm would no longer be there, with regard to Whitewater."(818)  Mr. Kennedy asserted that "*Documents - never go out/Quietly(?)" actually referred to the handling of Rose Law Firm files during the campaign: "It relates to the fact that there is--as far as I know, still is--a mystery about how the Whitewater documents--again I wish to stress these are the corporate records and real estate records relating to Whitewater as an investment--got from the Rose Law Firm to the campaign in 1992."(819)
<P>Regardless of whether "vacuum" is a verb or noun, records relating to Whitewater and Madison had been systematically removed from the Rose Law Firm during and after the 1992 campaign.  After questions arose about the Clintons' investment with the McDougals in Whitewater and Mrs. Clinton's representation of Madison Guaranty before a state agency, Vincent Foster collected all the information he could on the Madison representation.  At the conclusion of the campaign, the Madison files, which were by now the property of the RTC as conservator of Madison, as well as the files of other Rose clients for whom Mrs. Clinton had performed legal services, were secretly removed from the firm by Webster Hubbell.  Mr. Hubbell removed these files, at times taking the firm's only copies,(820) without obtaining the consent of the firm or client.(821) 
<P>Also during the 1992 presidential campaign, Mr. Foster or Mr. Hubbell ordered the printing of billing records relating to the Rose Law Firm's representation of Madison Guaranty.  These important records revealed the extent of Mrs. Clinton's legal work for Mr. McDougal's S&L, including her telephone call to Beverly Bassett Schaffer, the Arkansas Securities Commissioner appointed by Governor Clinton, about the troubled thrift's controversial proposal to raise capital by issuing preferred stock.  The records also reflected Mrs. Clinton's work on the IDC or Castle Grande transaction, which federal regulators described as a series of fraudulent land flips.(822)  The records contained the handwritten questions of Mr. Foster to Mrs. Clinton and notations by Mr. Hubbell.(823)  Mrs. Clinton has recently stated through her lawyer that she may have reviewed the records during the 1992 presidential campaign.
<P>After federal investigators began to look into matters relating to Madison Guaranty and Whitewater, a number of subpoenas were issued for these Rose Law Firm billing records.  By then, however, the records were nowhere to be found.  Despite extensive searches conducted by the law firm, neither the originals nor copies were discovered.(824)  They were not in the firm computers, its client files, or the firm's storage facility.(825)  The billing records, long lost, finally turned up in August 1995 in the Book Room of the White House Residence. 
<P>When asked about Mr. Foster's removal of documents from the Rose Law Firm, Mr. Kennedy admitted that he knew Mr. Foster had searched for Madison files during the 1992 campaign,(826) but claimed that he was not aware of whether Mr. Foster had removed the files from the Rose Law Firm.(827)  
<P>Mr. Kennedy also claimed that he wrote "quality," not "Quietly," in his notes, and was talking about the condition of "the Whitewater records that I once had in my possession, received from Ms. Clinton."(828)  Mr. Kennedy admitted that the Rose Law Firm did not have custody of any Whitewater documents, but claimed that, "The Whitewater files were Rose files when they were in my possession when I was performing legal work for Ms. Clinton."(829)
<P>Finally, Mr. Kennedy's notes recorded the following command: "Try to find out what's going on in Investigation,"(830) a directive that would inform the actions of White House officials throughout the Whitewater defense effort.

IV.<P>The White House Obtains Confidential SBA Documents Relating to Mr. Hale and Capital Management.
<P>At the November 5 meeting, senior White House officials and the Clintons' private lawyers discussed David Hale and his allegations against President Clinton.  For example, under the heading "David Hale," Mr. Kennedy's notes reflect the following notations: 
<P><P>"Tunnel at Capitol--Clinton says McD will call you--DH--hope 
<P><P>you'll help em

<P><P>145 Street Trailer - Jogging Shorts

<P><P>Shopping Malls - Clinton says do you know what bitch Susan 
<P><P>did with money-sed."(831)  
The notations reflect Mr. Hale's allegation that he saw then-Governor Clinton three times in 1986.  At the first meeting, on the steps of the Arkansas Capitol, Governor Clinton allegedly approached Mr. Hale and said that James McDougal would call Mr. Hale; Governor Clinton allegedly hoped that Mr. Hale would help Mr. McDougal.(832)  The second meeting allegedly took place at Mr. McDougal's trailer office on 145th Street in Little Rock.(833)  Governor Clinton, wearing a jogging outfit, asked Mr. Hale to make a loan to Mr. McDougal.  Finally, in the third meeting, at a Little Rock shopping mall, Governor Clinton, agitated, allegedly asked Mr. Hale: "Do you know what that bitch Susan did with the money?"(834)  Mr. Kennedy's notes recorded that: 
<P><P>"David Hale did make a $300,000 loan to Susan McD.  
<P><P>Jim McD says purchase land in Pulaski Co from IP 
<P><P>purchased in name of WW in 10/86."(835)  
<P>Three days after the November 5 Whitewater defense meeting, on November 8, Mr. Nussbaum directed Mr. Eggleston to a November 6 Washington Post story about a request from John LaFalce, Chairman of the House Committee on Small Business, to Mr. Bowles for information relating to CMS.54 (836)  The report, according to Mr. Eggleston, noted that Chairman LaFalce asked for the requested information by November 15, 1995.(837)
<P>Mr. Bowles responded to Chairman LaFalce's inquiry on November 15, 1993 in a four-page letter that provided a detailed summary of the investigation into CMS and responded to the specific questions set forth in Chairman LaFalce's November 4, 1993 letter.(838)  More importantly, Mr. Bowles' letter was accompanied by twelve sets of attachments, which included, among other things, lists of all loans provided by CMS, all portfolio financing reports submitted by CMS in connection with its SBA loans, all eleven reports of SBA audits of Capital Management, Mr. Foren's May 5, 1993 referral of the case to the Inspector General, and the September 23, 1993 criminal indictment against David Hale.(839)  In short, the attachments, "approximately a foot high,"(840) essentially comprised the entire SBA file on the operation, regulation, and investigation of CMS and David Hale.
<P>On the morning of November 16, 1993, the day after Mr. Bowles replied to Chairman LaFalce, Mr. Eggleston called the SBA and spoke with the Office of Legislative Affairs.(841)  The SBA directed Mr. Eggleston's inquiry to John Spotila, the SBA General Counsel.  Mr. Spotila advised that the SBA had responded to Chairman LaFalce's request late the night before.(842)  According to Mr. Eggleston, Mr. Spotila sent Mr. Eggleston via facsimile a copy of Mr. Bowles' letter to Chairman LaFalce at 11:20 a.m.(843)  Mr. Spotila followed up with another facsimile at 3:20 p.m., enclosing an SBA press release about Mr. Bowles' response.(844)  According to Mr. Eggleston, he then asked Mr. Spotila "whether it would be appropriate for the White House to have whatever had been provided to Congress."(845) 
<P>John Spotila was a classmate of President Clinton at Georgetown.  According to Mr. Spotila, "I have known the President for quite a while.  I was a classmate of his at Georgetown, and briefly at Yale, although my third year was his first year at the [law] school."(846)  He also knew Mrs. Clinton.(847)  Mr. Bowles testified that he selected Mr. Spotila as general counsel partly on Mrs. Clinton's recommendation.(848)
<P>On November 16, 1993, Mr. Spotila testified that he "faxed a copy of the press release that had been done and then the cover letter."(849)  After receiving the facsimiles, Mr. Eggleston asked Mr. Spotila whether he could have the attachments that accompanied Mr. Bowles' letter.(850)  Mr. Spotila testified that he consulted with Mark Stephens of his staff, who erroneously told Mr. Spotila that "all of the documents were entirely routine and nonsensitive."(851)
<P>In fact, at the top of the first page, Mr. Bowles' letter to Chairman LaFalce in bold type, contained the following notice:
<P>The information contained herein has been determined to be confidential in nature and therefore not releasable to unauthorized parties.  Disclosure of this information may violate Federal law (e.g., Privacy Act of 1974, the Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978, and 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1905). Utmost discretion should be exercised.(852)
Beyond this, Mr. Spotila's one sentence transmittal letter to Mr. Eggleston also specified that the information was confidential: "Enclosed is a copy of Erskine's letter yesterday to Chairman LaFalce (with confidential attachments)."(853)  
<P>While Mr. Eggleston was seeking this confidential SBA information, he was also speaking with other senior White House officials.  He left a message for Bruce Lindsey advising him of the confidential documents attached to the LaFalce letter:
<P>Neil Eggleston said the additional information is at SBA and is approximately a foot high.  He has a call in to SBA to find out if it contains reference to either the President or Hillary.  He can obtain a copy of the documents if it appears necessary but does not believe it is problematic.(854)
Mr. Eggleston did not recall talking with Mr. Lindsey on November 16 about the SBA documents.  Indeed, Mr. Eggleston implausibly claimed the message he left for Mr. Lindsey message led him to believe that he did not talk to Mr. Lindsey: "I don't remember actually doing it, and this document leads me to conclude that I probably didn't, and that I communicated with Mr. Lindsey through his secretary, which happened fairly frequently because Mr. Lindsey is extremely difficult to get in touch with."(855)  This testimony leaves open the obvious question of how Mr. Lindsey would have known what "additional documents" Mr. Eggleston was referring to in his message, if the two had not communicated previously about obtaining documents from the SBA.
<P>That afternoon, November 16, Associate White House Counsel Eggleston personally went over to the SBA offices and picked up the "approximately a foot high"(856) set of attachments from Mr. Spotila.  When he returned to the White House, he curiously left another message for Mr. Lindsey, at 4:58 p.m.  The message -- captioned "important" by Mr. Lindsey's secretary -- stated:  "Has some Whitewater documents to go over with you.  Will come by about 6:00 p.m."(857)
<P>Mr. Eggleston did not recall talking with Mr. Lindsey.  "As I've said repeatedly, I don't actually remember that happening.  This would certainly make it seem as if I had two communications with his secretary on that day with regard to these documents, and that makes a lot of sense.  I mean, that's the reason I was getting these."(858)  Mr. Eggleston claimed that he did not show documents to Mr. Lindsey:
<P>I did not, as I recall, I never got to him with these documents.  I don't remember whether he got back to me himself or through his secretary, but I recollect -- and again I don't know what Mr. Lindsey's recollection is -- but I recollect that I never showed him these documents.(859)
Mr. Lindsey did not believe that he saw the records.(860)  
<P>Back at the SBA, Mr. Spotila met with Mr. Bowles and told him that he had provided the confidential documents to the White House.(861)  Immediately, Mr. Bowles said, "I don't know if this is right or wrong, good or bad, up or down, but you better check with somebody with the Justice Department to see if it's okay."(862)  Mr. Spotila instructed Mark Stephens to contact the Justice Department.(863)
<P>The next day, November 17, 1993, Allen Carver, Principal Deputy Chief of the Justice Department's Fraud Section, called Mr. Stephens to obtain a copy of Mr. Bowles' November 15 response to Chairman LaFalce.(864)  Mr. Stephens advised Mr. Carver of the transfer of the confidential SBA documents.(865)  Mr. Carver and Mr. Stephens agreed to meet on November 18 at Mr. Carver's office with another attorney from the Fraud Section and an FBI agent working on the matter to discuss both Mr. Bowles report to Chairman LaFalce and the SBA's transfer of documents to the White House.(866)  
<P>At that time, the Justice Department instructed the SBA to retrieve from the White House the confidential documents and any White House materials analyzing those documents:  "Carver said get docs back + get their notations as well as all copies + list of people w/ access to docs."(867)  The notes also explained the reason for the Justice Department's objection: "Due to scope, they -- part of investigative body of material related to allegedly naming Pres.  WH should not get docs or apprised of investigation."(868)
<P>The next day, November 19, Mr. Carver talked with Mr. Stephens to ascertain the progress of the document retrieval.  According to Mr. Carver's contemporaneous memorandum about the call, Mr. Stephens said that "he called and spoke with Neal Eggleston earlier in the day, about 1:55 p.m., and Mr. Eggleston said that he would discuss the matter with the Deputy Attorney General and would discuss the matter further with Mr. Stephens early the next week."(869)
<P>Immediately, Mr. Carver called his supervisor, Fraud Section Chief Gerry McDowell, to advise him of Mr. Eggleston's conversation with Mr. Stephens.  According to contemporaneous notes of the conversation, Mr. McDowell said, "I've got to believe the WH counsel have done an incredibly stupid thing!"(870)  Mr. McDowell immediately notified the Associate Deputy Attorney General David Margolis.(871)  Mr. McDowell also talked directly with the Deputy Attorney General Phillip Heymann, who agreed with Mr. McDowell that this "could be an influence type situation."(872)
<P>According to contemporaneous notes, Mr. Eggleston called Mr. Heymann that day and talked to Mr. Nathan, Mr. Heymann's deputy.  Mr. Nathan apparently conveyed Mr. Heymann's strong sentiment to Mr. Eggleston, who, after the conversation, "wanted to get the documents back to the SBA as soon as possible."(873)  Curiously, White House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum, Mr. Eggleston's supervisor, called Associate Attorney General Webster Hubbell at 10:29 a.m. on November 19.(874)
<P>Although Mr. Eggleston was instructed specifically by the Justice Department to return the confidential documents immediately, he inexplicably waited for several days.(875)  Mr. Eggleston claimed that "[b]y that time, it was obvious that we would return the documents, but I had to talk to my supervisor before agreeing to do so."(876)  After speaking with the Justice  Department, Mr. Eggleston stated that he became "quite concerned, and spoke fairly quickly thereafter to Mr. Nussbaum and then worked hard to get the documents back as soon as I could."(877)
<P>On May 21, Mr. Eggleston finally reached Mr. Stephens, and arranged for the return of the documents.(878)  Mr. Stephens met Mr. Eggleston at the street corner in front of the SBA, where Stephens took back the box of SBA documents.(879)
<P>Mr. Eggleston reviewed the SBA documents.  He did not, however, "see any documents that I thought were particularly sensitive or that would have alerted me to the notion that Department of Justice might have had a problem."(880)  The career Justice Department prosecutors, however, had a different view of the matter.  Because the documents concerned a case involving allegations against the President, Mr. Carver believed that the White House had no right to any confidential documents or to be apprised of facts relating to the ongoing investigation.(881)
<P>The Justice Department immediately commenced an investigation into the transfer of confidential information to the White House.  On November 19, Mr. Carver discussed the investigation with the FBI.  The FBI Chief of the Governmental Fraud Unit, Richard Wade, "expressed concern over the possibility that the White House-SBA action, however, well-intended, could look like White House intervention."(882)  Mr. Carver recommended that the FBI interview Mr. Eggleston,(883) and also interview Mr. Kennedy concerning his conversations and contacts with Mr. Hale's attorney, Mr. Coleman, about the case.(884)
<P>This matter is still under investigation by the Office of the Independent Counsel.

V.<P>The White House Begins to Hold Whitewater Defense Meetings.<P>
<P>By late 1993, in the wake of new revelations, members of Congress and the national press began to call for the appointment of a special counsel to investigate Whitewater and Madison Guaranty.  At that time, although the statute governing a judicial appointment of an Independent Counsel had lapsed, the Attorney General could appoint a special counsel to investigate the matter.
<P>During the first weeks of January 1994, senior officials of the White House met twice daily in Whitewater Response Team meetings.(885)  Present were Deputy Chief of Staff Harold Ickes, who was hired in part to coordinate the Whitewater defense effort; Chief of Staff Thomas Mack McLarty; White House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum; Deputy White House Counsel Joel Klein; Senior Advisor to the President George Stephanopoulos; Counselor to the President David Gergen; Associate White House Counsel Neil Eggleston; and Director of White House Communications Mark Gearan.(886)  Significantly, Mrs. Clinton and her Chief of Staff, Margaret Williams, attended some of the meetings.(887)
<P>During the Banking Committee hearings in the summer of 1994, senior White House officials provided evasive answers when asked to describe the purpose of the meetings.(888)  Mr. Lindsey and Mr. Nussbaum both failed to mention any specific subject discussed other than the handling of press inquiries related to Whitewater.(889)
<P>The Special Committee, however, obtained evidence this year that White House officials discussed far more than press inquiries at these twice daily meetings.(890)  Contemporaneous and detailed notes of these meetings, prepared by Mr. Gearan reflect an extensive debate over whether an independent or special prosecutor should be appointed, and, if so, the scope and duration of such an independent investigation.(891)  The notes also reflect the willingness of senior White House officials to attempt to interfere in ongoing investigations, particularly regarding former Arkansas Securities Commissioner Beverly Bassett Schaffer's regulation of Madison.(892)  Finally, the notes indicate yet another instance of government lawyers providing private legal services to the President and Mrs. Clinton.
<P>A.<P>Senior White House officials debated the appointment of a Special Counsel.

<P>Mr. Gearan's notes reflect considerable debate within the White House on the appointment of a special counsel versus independent counsel.  At a January 4, 1993 meeting, Mr. Gergen observed that the difference between independent counsels, appointed by a panel of federal judges, and special  prosecutors, appointed by the Attorney General, is that independent counsels "take on a life of their own."(893)
<P>The next day, January 5, 1993, the debate continued.   Mr. Nussbaum argued strenuously that no substantive difference existed between an independent counsel and a special prosecutor.(894)  In Mr. Nussbaum's view, both an independent counsel and a prosecutor are "subject to no control [and] come [with the] desire to get someone."(895)  Mr. Nussbaum expressed his "adamant" opposition to the appointment of any independent prosecutor.(896)
<P>Mr. Gearan recalled that Mr. Nussbaum, again continuing to exhibit his concern about control, compared an independent or special prosecutor to "somewhat of an unguided missile."(897)  To illustrate his point, Mr. Nussbaum envisioned two scenarios--the "good-hearted" prosecutor and the "bad-hearted prosecutor."(898)  The "good hearted" prosecutor would conduct an investigation and simply document his findings.(899)  In contrast, the "bad-hearted" prosecutor "goes in & decides a smell of corruption & can show some things of those people close around the principal."(900)  According to Mr. Gearan, the "principal" was President Clinton.(901)
<P>A significant, if not dominating, concern of the White House officials during the Whitewater defense meetings was Mrs. Clinton's opposition to the appointment of either an independent or a special prosecutor.  Mr. Gearan's notes of January 4, 1994 show that Mrs. Clinton joined the meeting -- already in progress -- and said "this looks like a meeting I might be interested in."(902)  Mrs. Clinton stayed for approximately 15 minutes,(903) and opposed the appointment of a special counsel.(904)  After she left several officials expressed the view that it was pointless to debate the merits of an independent counsel versus a special counsel given Mrs. Clinton's steadfast opposition to the appointment of either type of prosecutor.(905)
<P>On January 5, Mr. McLarty and Mr. Ickes both supported Mrs. Clinton's position.(906)  Mr. McLarty advised that the group move off the discussion of a special prosecutor or counsel because "HRC and BC don't want it."(907)  Harold Ickes stated that the discussion "was the biggest f------ waste of time."(908)  Before the Special Committee, Mr. Ickes testified that, although he could not recall the specific meeting, "it was well known that Mrs. Clinton had very, very grave reservations" about the appointment of any type of prosecutor.(909)
<P>On January 7, senior White House officials discussed attempting to persuade Mrs. Clinton to reverse her position on the appointment of a special counsel.(910)  Mr. Ickes advised that Secretary of State Warren Christopher or attorney Robert Barnett might attempt to convince Mrs. Clinton that a prosecutor should be appointed.(911)
<P>Ultimately, however, Mr. Ickes thought that it was "impossible" to "reopen" the discussion with Mrs. Clinton.(912)  Mr. Gearan recalled that everyone in attendance at the meeting agreed that it would be "impossible" for anyone, including the President, to change Mrs. Clinton's mind.(913)
<P>Later that day, Mr. Ickes again stated Mrs. Clinton's strong opposition to the appointment of any prosecutor.(914)  Mr. Gearan's notes of this second meeting indicate that Mr. Ickes regarded Mrs. Clinton's "adamant[] oppos[ition]" as one of the major problems with calling for a special counsel.(915)
<P>Senior White House officials and Mrs. Clinton feared that a special counsel might indict persons close to President Clinton.  According to Mr. Gearan's notes of a January 7, 1993 meeting, Mr. Nussbaum said, "Indictments will be Betsy Wright."(916)  Ms. Wright was Governor Clinton's former Chief of Staff in the 1980s and handled damage control for Whitewater and other Arkansas-related matters during the 1992 Clinton presidential campaign.(917)  Mr. Gearan implausibly denied that any concern was expressed that Ms. Wright would be indicted: "[A]t no time was I present in any conversation where Mr. Nussbaum suggested that there is any basis for Ms. Wright to be charged with anything like this."(918)  Mr. Gearan claimed that Mr. Nussbaum identified Ms. Wright as an extreme example of someone who might face prosecution by a special counsel investigating Madison Guaranty and Whitewater.(919)
<P>In any event, senior White House officials were concerned about possible indictments.  A White House document, entitled "Confidential:  Second Draft, Summary of Arguments Re: Whitewater," dated January 10, 1994, lists reasons against the appointment of a prosecutor.(920)  The memorandum specifically states that a special counsel investigation "may result in focus on friends and associates of the President, begin to squeeze them and may subject some to indictment."(921)  Mr. Ickes admitted that there "may well have been" concern among White House officials over possible indictments,(922) and "a lot of names came up" in the discussion of persons who might be "squeezed" or "hurt" by an investigation.(923)
<P>Evidently Mr. Nussbaum, too, believed that associates of the Clintons might be vulnerable to criminal prosecution.(924)  Mr. Gearan's notes of a January 5, 1993 meeting indicate that Mr. Nussbaum believed it would be possible for a criminal prosecutor to detect "a smell of corruption and can show some things of those people close around the principal."(925)  Mr. Gearan recalled this statement and admitted that "principal" referred to President Clinton.(926)
<P>During the debate over the appointment of a special counsel, senior White House officials apparently attempted both to influence Attorney General Reno's decision on the matter and to negotiate the scope of an impending investigation.  As early as the January 4 meeting, White House officials feared that Attorney General Reno would appoint an independent prosecutor without the White House's input on the matter.(927)  Mr. Gearan's notes of the January 7 meeting indicate discussion about Attorney General Reno's decision,(928) and preference for  "fewer [questions] to lessen the exposure."(929)
<P>Later, that day, Mr. Gearan noted that all meeting participants agreed, except for Bernard Nussbaum, that "Reno is boxed once Ind[ependent] C[ounsel] starts."(930)  Mr. Gearan confirmed that senior White House officials feared that after the Attorney General appointed an independent counsel, the matter would be "out of her hands" with regard to the duration and scope of the investigation.(931)  The notes suggest that a problem with calling for a special counsel is that "Reno has shut the door."(932)  Mr. Gearan denied that this entry referred to any rejection by Ms. Reno of attempts by the White House to influence her decision on the support of a special counsel.(933)
<P>On January 8, 1994, Mr. Ickes expressed displeasure with regard to how career Justice Department prosecutors--Donald Mackay and Alan Carver--were handling the ongoing federal investigations of Madison Guaranty and Whitewater.(934)  Mr. Ickes described Mr. Carver as a "bad guy" because he put the Clintons' private counsel, Mr. Kendall, on a speaker phone with two FBI agents and another prosecutor, Jim Nixon, on the other end.(935)  Mr. Ickes believed that the career Justice Department prosecutors "are f----- us blue."(936)
<P>Mr. Gearan claimed that Mr. Ickes' strong remarks were actually complimentary.  Mr. Gearan asserted that his reference to "Those guys are f------ us blue" meant that the Justice Department officials were "tough" on the White House and had acted "independent[ly]."(937)
<P>Mr. Ickes similarly claimed that "Those guys are f------- us blue" meant that "they were probably doing an effective job."(938)  Mr. Ickes denied that his remarks reflected White House irritation with Justice Department officials for spurning White House attempts to influence their investigation.(939)
<P>This testimony is contradicted, however, by handwritten notes of Roger Altman, Deputy Treasury Secretary and Interim CEO of the RTC.  In fact, Mr. Altman's support the inference that certain White House officials sought to negotiate the scope of any investigation of Madison Guaranty and Whitewater, but that Attorney General Reno rebuffed their efforts.(940)
<P>Mr. Altman's notes record two conversations that he had with Mrs. Clinton's Chief of Staff Margaret Williams during the same period in which the Whitewater Response Team meetings were taking place.  According to Mr. Altman's notes, dated January 6, 1994, at or about that time, "Maggie's strong inference was that the White House was trying to negotiate scope of an independent counsel with Reno and having enormous difficulty."(941)  Indeed, Ms. Williams told Mr. Altman that Mrs. Clinton herself did not want investigators "poking into 20 years of public life in Arkansas."(942)  According to notes of January 11, 1994, Ms. Williams told Mr. Altman:  "On Whitewater, HRC was paralyzed by it.  If we don't solve this matter within the next two days, we don't have to worry about her schedule on Health Care."(943)
<P>David Kendall, the Clintons' personal attorney, also participated in the White House discussions over the appointment of a special counsel, including whether the desirability of "attempting to impose limitations" on the investigation.(944)  In fact, Mr. Kendall drafted the very letter that Mr. Nussbaum ultimately sent to the Attorney General Reno requesting the appointment of a special counsel.(945)
<P>On January 12, 1994, after the President called for a special counsel, Attorney General Reno appointed Robert B. Fiske, Jr., to conduct the investigation into "whether any individuals or entities [had] committed a violation of any federal criminal or civil law relating to [the Clintons'] relationship with Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan Association, the Whitewater Development Corporation, or Capital Management Services, Inc."(946)
<P>B.<P>White House contacts with former Arkansas Securities Commissioner Beverly Bassett Schaffer. 

<P>Senior White House officials feared that Beverly Bassett Schaffer, the Arkansas Securities Commissioner who regulated Madison Guaranty in the mid-1980s, would contradict Mrs. Clinton's statements concerning the nature and extent of Mrs. Clinton's representation of Madison Guaranty before the state regulator -- as Ms. Schaffer did in testimony before the Special Committee.  During the January 1994 Whitewater Response Team meetings, for example, senior White House officials recognized the importance of Ms. Schaffer's "story" and considered measures to ensure that she would continue to do a "good job" telling it.(947)
<P>During the 1992 presidential campaign, Ms. Schaffer's regulation of Madison became an issue.(948)  Ms. Schaffer allegedly ignored evidence of the S&L's insolvency and failed to close down Madison Guaranty.(949)  News reports also claimed that Ms. Schaffer approved a novel proposal submitted by Mrs. Clinton and her law firm on behalf of Madison Guaranty to raise needed capital by issuing preferred stock.(950)
<P>Questions also arose about whether Mrs. Clinton improperly benefitted from her representation of Madison.(951)  Mrs. Clinton wrote to Ms. Schaffer on behalf of Madison Guaranty on the novel preferred stock issue.(952)  Only two weeks later, in a letter to Mrs. Clinton addressed, "Dear Hillary," Ms. Schaffer approved the proposal.(953)  Mrs. Clinton forwarded Ms. Schaffers' letter of approval to James McDougal, the Clintons' Whitewater business partner and the owner and operator of Madison Guaranty.(954)
<P>These contacts between Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Schaffer, and Mrs. Clinton and Mr. McDougal, raised the issue of the propriety of the Governor's spouse attempting to influence a state regulator appointed by her husband on behalf of a client and business partner.
<P>Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Schaffer both denied allegations that Madison Guaranty had received any special treatment.  The Clinton campaign issued statements, attributed to Mrs. Clinton, expressly claiming that "she had done legal work for Madison Guaranty, but that it was not related to the Savings & Loan's dealings with state regulators."(955)  Ms. Schaffer, with the assistance of the Clinton campaign, composed statements, including two memoranda to the New York Times, denying any special treatment for Madison Guaranty.(956)
<P>In October 1993, the RTC sent a criminal referral to the U.S. Attorney's Office in Little Rock suggesting a connection between the preferred stock issue and campaign contributions to Governor Clinton.(957)  The referral noted that during the same month that Mrs. Clinton wrote to Ms. Schaffer, several questionable $3,000 Madison Guaranty cashier checks were written to the Bill Clinton Campaign.(958)  The referral stressed that Madison's preferred stock plan was approved quickly, and that Madison Guaranty's request to issue preferred stock occurred when Madison badly needed additional capital.(959)  The referral identified both Hillary Rodham Clinton and Beverly Bassett Schaffer as possible witnesses to criminal misconduct.(960)
<P>On September 29, 1993, the White House received a "heads up" about the substance of these referrals.(961) At the November 5, 1993 meeting at Williams & Connolly, senior White House officials and private attorneys for the Clintons discussed Mrs. Clinton's representation of Madison Guaranty before the Arkansas Securities Department,(962) particularly the "coziness" of the relationship.(963)
<P>On December 20, 1993, the New York Times published an editorial, entitled "Open up on Madison Guaranty."(964)  The editorial described the close relationship between the McDougals and the Clintons and stated: "Others, however, are mildly troubled by the fact that Mr. Clinton did not order his regulators to crack down on Mr. McDougal even after he was advised by his own banking commissioner in 1983 that the savings & loan operator was engaged in imprudent banking practices.(965)  In the margin of the editorial, the President wrote: "This is important to be on top of.  Bassett did a good job in [campaign] on this--can she now?"(966)  The President then forwarded copies of the editorial containing his handwritten marginalia to Messrs. Lindsey and McLarty.(967)
<P>One week later, President Clinton and Mr. Lindsey attended a basketball game at the University of Arkansas with Ms. Schaffer and her husband.(968)  At the game, Mr. Lindsey asked Mr. Schaffer if she would be willing to answer press inquiries "with respect to her role and what she did and get that story out."(969)  Mr. Lindsey could not recall whether the President participated in the conversation.(970)
<P>On January 6, 1994, senior White House officials discussed Ms. Schaffer's role in connection with Madison's issuance of preferred stock.(971)  Associate White House Counsel Neil Eggleston recalled discussions about the importance to the President and Mrs. Clinton of Ms. Schaffer's statements "about her role" during the mid-1980s in regulating Madison Guaranty.(972)
<P>The next day, January 7, senior White House officials again discussed Ms. Schaffer.  This time, White House officials considered sending Mr. Lindsey, Washington lawyer Michael Waldman, and Paul Berry, a former roommate of President Clinton, "to [Arkansas] to meet [with] Beverly Bassett."(973)  Mr. Waldman recalled that the officials discussed "sending people down to talk to" Ms. Schaffer.(974)  Mr. Berry, a lobbyist for Union National Bank of Little Rock, had instructed Harry Don Denton, the Bank's loan officer, to make a $20,000 Whitewater loan to Bill Clinton in 1978 because he was "an up and coming political star;"(975)  Mr. Denton testified that he would not have made the loan absent Mr. Berry's urging.(976) 
<P>At a second January 7 meeting, senior White House officials expressed a sense of urgency about Ms. Schaffer's story beyond simple concern over a misperception in the press.(977)  According to Mr. Gearan's notes, Mr. Ickes exclaimed: "[Beverly] Bassett is so f---- important. [I]f we f--- this up, we're done."(978)  Mr. Ickes added, "[L]et's not talk it to death-let's just get it done."(979)  
<P>Mr. Ickes and Mr. Gearan both claimed that Ms. Schaffer's story "was so f------ important" because the White House did not want "to misstate anything."(980)  Neither could recall the meaning of Mr. Ickes' comment "let's get it done."(981)  Mr. Eggelston recalled, however, that "people recognize[d] that if [Ms. Schaffer] were suddenly to change what she had said publicly . . . and change her story about it, that would be a bad development."(982)  Mr. Eggleston confirmed that senior White House officials were concerned that Ms. Schaffer would "change" her "story."(983)
<P>After the discussion of Ms. Schaffer's importance, the senior White House officials again discussed sending an emissary to Ms. Schaffer.(984)  Although Mr. Ickes rejected the earlier idea to send Messrs. Berry, Waldman, and Lindsey because "it will come out,"(985) he still wanted someone to go over her statement "item by item" to "make sure her story is [okay]."55 (986)
<P>The senior White House officials feared that the press might discover that the White House had dispatched operatives to contact Ms. Schaffer and the appearance of impropriety.(987)  Mr. Ickes was concerned that such a contact could "create an appearance that there was an effort to influence her."(988)
<P>Both Mr. Ickes and Mr. Gearan denied that a decision was made to send someone to see Ms. Schaffer to "make sure her story is ok."56 (989)  In the end, the White House decided not to "send people who were connected with the White House to talk to Ms. Schaffer."(990)  Mr. Ickes claimed: "As far as I know, no one was sent from the White House to talk to Ms. Schaffer."(991)
<P>Within a week of the January 9, 1994 meeting, however, at least two attendees reached out to Ms. Schaffer.57   According to an Associated Press article, Ms. Schaffer resisted pressure from Messrs. Lindsey, Begala, and Rutherford to hold a press conference in 1994 concerning her contacts on Madison's preferred stock offering.(992) 
<P>In January 1994, Ms. Schaffer spoke to John Tisdale, the Clintons' attorney in Little Rock, and he suggested that she help prepare a chronology for the White House.(993)  In the second week of January 1994, Mr. Tisdale forwarded a series of memoranda to Mr. Lindsey.(994)  It is unclear whether Mr. Lindsey had requested that these memoranda be prepared.  A January 13, 1994 memorandum reflects communications between Mr. Tisdale's firm and Ms. Schaffer.(995)  It includes the background of Ms. Schaffer's dealings with Mrs. Clinton and "is based on our discussions with [Ms.] Schaffer."(996)
<P>Also in January 1994, Skip Rutherford, a public relations advisor to the White House on Whitewater-related matters, contacted Ms. Schaffer and her husband, Archie, to discuss the possibility that Ms. Schaffer might hold a press conference.(997)  Ms. Schaffer stated that while Mr. Rutherford did not specifically indicate he was calling on behalf of the White House, she was aware that Mr. Rutherford was "helping" Chief of Staff McLarty in some capacity.(998)  Deputy Chief of Staff Ickes denied knowledge of Mr. Tisdale's or Mr. Rutherford's contacts with Ms. Schaffer.(999)
<P>At the same time that White House officials were meeting twice daily to coordinate the Whitewater defense effort, Betsey Wright, the 1992 Deputy Campaign Director and longtime associate of the President, travelled to Little Rock from Washington, D.C.  Although Ms. Wright testified that she went to Little Rock to collect documents, she claimed that she was not asked by anyone at the White House to travel to Little Rock.  Rather, Ms. Wright testified that she took it upon herself to collect these documents.  
<P>Ms. Wright contacted Mr. Lindsey, Mr. Podesta, and Mr. Kendall and informed them of her intention to travel to Little Rock,(1000) and that the purpose of her trip was to collect campaign finance records.(1001)
<P>When asked why she went to Little Rock, Ms. Wright said, "I was trying to pull together - we kept getting the - the White House and I kept getting press questions about some campaign finance questions."(1002)  Ms. Wright testified that the documents would be a "handy reference" and could be used in Washington to ensure that she was speaking with a higher degree of factual understanding.(1003)  
<P>While in Arkansas searching through the documents, which were under the control of the Democratic National Committee, she "located a box that when I opened it up it was Whitewater documents, and I brought it back to DC and gave it to Mr. Kendall."(1004) Ms. Wright also retrieved and made copies of the appointment files for Ms. Schaffer and gave those files to Mr. Kendall.(1005)  In total, Ms. Wright testified that she had thirteen or fourteen boxes of documents shipped to her from Little Rock.(1006)
<P>On January 6, after locating the documents at the storage facility, Ms. Wright called Mr. Lindsey.(1007)  On January 6 or 7, Ms. Wright spoke with Mrs. Clinton.(1008)  The First Lady said to Ms. Wright, "there is going to be an independent or special counsel.  You need to get a lawyer. And that's how you should handle these documents." (1009)  
<P>C.<P>The Whitewater Response Team assigns defense tasks to White House officials.
<P>Records of the January Whitewater Response Team meetings reflected specific tasks assigned to the various members of the team.(1010)
<P>Many of these assignments focused on the possible appointment of a special counsel, including the legal, historical, and practical aspects of appointing a special counsel.  For example, a memorandum to the "Whitewater Group" from Mr. Ickes, dated January 10, 1994, assigned "2-3 page argument why no special counsel" to the White House Counsel's Office and Michael Waldman.(1011)  In addition, however, there were a number of assignments related to the factual and legal issues involving Whitewater.  Mr. Ickes claimed that this was all part of the White House effort to respond to press inquiries, but many of the tasks involved the Clintons' private legal defense issues.  For example, "synopsis of Whitewater/Madison Guaranty matter" was assigned to the White House Counsel's office, Bruce Lindsey and Mr. Waldman, and  "Memo re failure to take deduction on tax return for Whitewater losses" was assigned to Mr. Waldman.(1012)  Mr. Ickes also tasked Mr. Waldman to contact Chris Wade, the Whitewater real estate agent, to obtain Whitewater documents.58 
<P>Finally, Mr. Ickes assigned to the White House Counsel's Office a legal memorandum on the statute of limitation for civil actions to be brought against Mrs. Clinton or the Rose Law Firm in relation to the legal representation of Madison Guaranty.  Obviously, this legal memorandum did not relate to press inquiries nor did it relate to the White House Counsel's appropriate role in representing the United States Government.  Rather, it was legal analysis to assist President and Mrs. Clinton.  After Mr. Eggelston drafted the memorandum, Mr. Ickes forwarded it to Mrs. Clinton. 

VI:<P>The Retention and Investigation of Pillsbury Madison & Sutro.

<P>In November 1993, Congress enacted the RTC Completion Act of 1993,(1013) which extended the statute of limitations period for the RTC to initiate civil suits against failed savings and loans to February 1994.  The statute extended the limitations period only for claims arising from fraud, or from intentional misconduct resulting in unjust enrichment or in substantial losses to the institution.(1014)  
<P>On February 4, 1994, the RTC issued an Order of Investigation into potential civil claims against Madison Guaranty.  This investigation was intended to determine whether the RTC could bring civil claims against "former officers, directors or others who provided services to, or otherwise dealt with, Madison Guaranty."(1015)   
<P> In January 1994, the RTC's General Counsel, Ellen Kulka, decided that the RTC should retain outside counsel to investigate any potential civil claims against Madison Guaranty,(1016) and she selected the law firm of Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro (the "Pillsbury Firm") as outside counsel.(1017)  RTC Counsel told Ms. Kulka that Charles E. Patterson and Jay Stephens, former United States Attorney for the District of Columbia, were two of the three partners at the Pillsbury Firm whom they anticipated would handle the investigation.(1018)
<P> A.<P> The White House expresses concern over the retention of Jay Stephens. 
<P>By February 1994, senior White House learned that the RTC had hired the Pillsbury Firm and Mr. Stephens to investigate Madison Guaranty.  On February 25, 1994, George Stephanopoulos, Senior Advisor to the President, and Joshua Steiner, Chief of Staff to Treasury Lloyd Bentsen, discussed the RTC's decision to hire Mr. Stephens.(1019)  According to Mr. Steiner, Mr. Stephanopoulos was "angry" and raised his voice during the conversation.(1020)  Mr. Stephanopolous told Mr. Steiner that Mr. Stephens should be disqualified from handling the matter because Mr. Stephens had been a critic of the Clinton Administration.(1021)
<P>Jean Hanson, General Counsel to the Department of Treasury, testified that Mr. Steiner subsequently told her: "[D]o you believe those guys, they want to see if they can get rid of Jay Stephens."(1022)  Ms. Hanson understood that "those guys" referred to various senior White House officials.(1023)  Ms. Hanson further testified that on a separate occasion Mr. Steiner expressed the view that Ms. Kulka should be fired for hiring Mr. Stephens.(1024)
<P>In his diary, Mr. Steiner described his conversation with Mr. Stephanopolous:
<P>Simply outrageous that RTC had hired him [Stephens], but even more amazing when George then suggested to me that we needed to find a way to get rid of him.  Persuaded George that firing him would be incredibly stupid and improper.(1025)

Subsequently, Mr. Steiner disavowed his diary entry, claiming that he merged two conversations in one entry.(1026)  
<P>B.<P>Mr. Stephens is removed from the RTC investigation.
<P>Mr. Stephens was included in Pillsbury's initial proposal to the RTC as one of the three partners in charge of the matter.(1027)  During the early stages of the investigation in February 1994, Mr. Stephens attended meetings and was in daily contact with the RTC.(1028) 
<P>However, after numerous press reports describing Mr. Steiner's conversation with Mr. Stephanopolous appeared in the third week of March 1994, Mr. Stephens' role "diminished substantially and probably by the summer of '94, [he] was virtually disengaged from the matter."(1029)  Billing records of the Pillsbury Firm confirm that Mr. Stephens' work on the matter dropped off significantly.
<P>After March 1994, Mr. Stephens was told that it was no longer necessary for him to attend meetings with the RTC in Washington, D.C.(1030)  In addition, the documents relating to the investigation were moved from the Pillsbury Firm's Washington D.C. office, where Mr. Stephens resided, to its West Coast offices in Los Angeles and San Francisco.(1031)
<P> After March 1994, Mr. Patterson, the partner in charge of managing the Madison Guaranty investigation, did not assign any further work to Mr. Stephens.(1032)  Mr. Stephens did not draft the reports eventually submitted to the RTC and has no basis for either agreeing or disagreeing with any of the conclusions of the reports.(1033)  Mr. Stephens did not attend any presentations to the RTC about the findings in the reports.(1034)  Mr. Stephens conducted no depositions and no witness interviews, except for one interview relating to a request for documents.(1035) 
<P>Mr. Patterson spoke to Mark Gabrellian, Counsel to the RTC Legal Division, about Mr. Stephens' diminished role, but denied that anyone at the RTC asked him to remove Mr. Stephens from the case.(1036)  He did, however, advise Bruce Ericson, the billing partner on the Madison investigation, that Ms. Kulka had disliked something that Mr. Stephens had said during a meeting.  Mr. Patterson had the impression that "there was a personality conflict" between Mr. Stephens and Ms. Kulka.(1037)  Mr. Gabrellian similarly testified that Ms. Kulka and Mr. Stephens "were not getting along all that well."(1038)  Ms. Kulka admitted that she discussed Mr. Stephens with Mr. Patterson, but claimed that her only concern was with the quality of Mr. Stephens' work.(1039)
<P>  C.<P>The White House makes inaccurate claims about the Pillsbury report.
<P>Although Mr. Stephens was removed from the Madison Guaranty investigation, the RTC still wanted Mr. Stephens to review and approve the final version of the reports in December 1995.  Mr. Stephens, however, refused to do so: 
<P>Well in fact the RTC asked me to read the reports when the reports were filed in December, I declined to do that because I had not been involved in the engagement, I thought it was improper and inappropriate for me to review those reports simply so the RTC could have my imprimatur on those reports.(1040)
Mr. Ericson confirmed that Mr. Stephens had no involvement in the handling of the matter after the summer or at the latest fall 1994--over one year prior to the completion of the final reports.(1041)
<P>Moreover, on May 17, 1996, in a hearing before the Special Committee, Mr. Patterson and Mr. Ericson both admitted that Mr. Stephens did not "head the inquiry." (1042)  Both partners also agreed that statements indicating that the report was "written by Republican Jay Stephens" are entirely baseless and inaccurate.(1043)  The following exchange occurred at the Special Committee's hearings with lawyers from the Pillsbury firm:
<P>Senator D'Amato:  Let me read to you from the Chicago Sun Times. . . . Dated January 21st [1996] . . . Headline: Facts Fight Fiction Over Whitewater.

<P>Mr. Patterson:  Yes.

<P>Senator D'Amato:  What's the byline?

<P>Mr. Patterson:  Hillary Clinton.

<P>Senator D'Amato:  Let me take you down to the last sentence in the first page.  You want to start reading that?

<P>Mr. Patterson:  Would you like me to read it Senator?

<P>Senator D'Amato:  Yes, please.

<P>Mr. Patterson:  Since most Americans never heard about this report, let me fill you in.

<P>Senator D'Amato: This is referring to the report that your, this is the Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro report.  Go ahead.

<P>Mr. Patterson:  It was conducted by the RTC by one of the nation's leading law firms, Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro.  It took more than two years to complete and cost nearly $4 million.  A prominent republican, former U.S. Attorney, Jay Stephens, headed the inquiry.

<P>Senator D'Amato:  Mr. Stephens, did you head this inquiry?

<P>Mr. Stephens:  No, I did not.

<P>Senator D'Amato:  Mr. Patterson, did he head the inquiry?

<P>Mr. Patterson:  No, he did not Senator.

<P>Senator D'Amato:  Mr. Ericson, did he head the inquiry?

<P>Mr. Ericson:  No.(1044)<BR>
Indeed, after Mr. Stephens was identified in public statements as the author of the reports, he raised the following concern:
<P>On one or two occasions, I probably raised I believe most likely with Mr. Ericson, some concern that I had that the factual record wasn't clear or that I felt it was a little inappropriate that somehow or other either I was getting the credit or the blame for the reports, since I hadn't written the reports.(1045)

However, "the sense was the client [the RTC] did not want to get involved in making public statements about the firm's involvement."(1046)
<P>Contrary to White House claims, the final report of the Pillsbury firm did not exonerate the Clintons.  The Pillsbury investigation focused only on the narrow question whether it would be cost-effective for the RTC to bring any civil lawsuits against Madison to recover damages arising from the S&L's failure.(1047)  The authors of the Pillsbury report--Mr. Patterson and Mr. Ericson--testified that the reports do not exonerate anyone.(1048)  As Mr. Ericson put it, "I don't think our reports exonerated anybody of anything."(1049)
<P>After reviewing a draft of the supplemental Whitewater Report in November 1994,(1050) Mr. Stephens told Mr. Ericson that the report did not consider the "totality of the issues related to Madison because it was looking at Whitewater in isolation rather than looking at sort of the mosaic of real estate transactions that Madison was involved in and how Whitewater might tie in or relate to that."(1051)
<P>I believe I made some general comment that in my reading through the report that it either didn't highlight or didn't focus on the potential liability that might arise from a difference of equity participation by the partners in the Whitewater venture. . ..  And in doing that, the partners still maintain the same general equitable interest in the, or legal interest in the partnership, and as a consequence, one partner was benefitting substantially by the financial contributions of the other, and that there may be some issue that really raised a question about liability.(1052)

Mr. Stephens further told Mr. Ericson the Pillsbury Firm should interview more witnesses who "might have added perspective or input in trying to understand those transactions."(1053)  According to Mr. Stephens, the report was essentially "an accounting analysis."(1054)
<P>Pillsbury never examined many witness.  Some asserted their Fifth Amendment right not to testify: James and Susan McDougal, the Clintons' Whitewater business partners, Jim Guy Tucker, Chris and Rosalee Wade, Whitewater real estate agents.(1055)  The OIC asked Pillsbury not to interview John Latham, President and CEO of Madison Guaranty, or David Hale, President of Capital Management Services, Inc.(1056)
<P>Other witnesses who provided important testimony to the Special Committee, however, were simply not contacted by the Pillsbury firm.(1057)  Because of the limited scope of Pillsbury's representation, there were a number of areas that they did not explore, and therefore a number of witnesses that the Pillsbury Firm did not interview.  For example, the Pillsbury Firm did not interview many of the bankers involved in making or extending the Whitewater loans.59

<H2>  PART III.  WHITE HOUSE INTERFERENCE WITH CONGRESSIONAL INQUIRIES</H2>

I.<P>Mr. Ickes Provided Incomplete and Inaccurate Testimony to the Senate Banking Committee.

<P>Before the Senate Banking Committee in summer 1994, Mr. Ickes testified that he and other senior White House officials did not discuss the statute of limitations for Madison-related civil claims prior to February 2, 1994.  Documentary evidence obtained by the Special Committee indicates, however, that, in January 1994, Mr. Ickes and other White House officials were concerned about and discussioned when the statute of limitations would run on possible civil claims the RTC might bring against the Mrs. Clinton and the Rose Law Firm.(1058)
<P>In January 1994, considerable public interest existed in issues relating to Whitewater and Madison.  The RTC was investigating possible civil claims arising from the $60 million failure of Madison, and on January 20, 1994, a Special Counsel was appointed to investigate possible criminal conduct relating to Whitewater and Madison.  The statute of limitations for Madison-related civil claims involving fraud or intentional misconduct was scheduled to expire on February 28, 1994.  On February 12, 1994, Congress enacted Public Law 103-211, which extended the statute of limitations to December 31, 1995.
<P>Prior to the extension of the statute of limitations, the RTC had to decide by February 28, 1994, whether to bring suit, to seek tolling agreements, or to allow the statute to expire without action.  Because President and Mrs. Clinton faced potential liability relating to the failure of Madison, information regarding the status of the RTC investigation and its deliberations with respect to the statute of limitations was valuable to the Clintons in their defense effort.(1059)
<P>During its 1994 investigation, the Senate Banking Committee examined the state of knowledge of White House officials in January 1994 with respect to the statute of limitations for Madison-related civil claims.(1060)  Mr. Ickes testified about a meeting on February 2, 1994, between senior White House officials and Roger Altman, then Deputy Secretary of the Treasury and Acting Chief Executive Officer of the RTC, and Jean Hanson, General Counsel to the Department of the Treasury.(1061)  With respect to discussions about the statute of limitations at that meeting, Mr. Ickes testified: "I, for one, had little knowledge, if any knowledge, about the situation."(1062)
<P>Similarly, when asked by the Inspectors General of the Treasury Department and the RTC about this same February 2, 1994, meeting, Mr. Ickes testified: "Mr. Altman, as I recall, raised the issue of the upcoming--the possible--well, not the possible, but the fact that the statute of limitations, which I knew nothing about at the time, of the RTC in connection with an investigation that was apparently being conducted by the RTC on Madison Whitewater was about to expire."(1063)  Mr. Ickes emphasized that White House officials had no knowledge of the statute of limitations issue:  "There were questions about the statute of limitations, when it expired, under what conditions it expired.  I don't think anybody in the room other than Mr. Altman and Ms. Hanson had a clear picture of what the statute of limitations situation was."(1064)
<P>Evidence uncovered by the Special Committee shows, however, that in January 1994, Mr. Ickes assigned and received a memorandum on the statute of limitations for Madison-related civil claims.  Moreover, he discussed the issue with other senior White House officials prior to the February 2 meeting with Mr. Altman and Ms. Hanson.
<P>Among the evidence newly uncovered by the Special Committee is a memorandum to Mr. Ickes from W. Neil Eggleston, Associate Counsel to the President, entitled "Statute of Limitations in Actions Brought by the Conservators of a Financial Institution."(1065)  The memorandum, dated January 17, 1994, discussed the statute of limitations generally applicable to claims filed by the RTC on behalf of failed thrift institutions.<P>  More important, Mr. Eggleston's memorandum discussed the statute of limitations as applied specifically to Madison and identified March 2, 1994,60  as the final date for the RTC to file civil tort claims on behalf of Madison, the type of action usually brought against outsiders in financial institution cases.(1066)
<P>On February 20, 1996, the White House produced to the Special Committee memoranda from Mr. Ickes to the "Whitewater group," dated January 9 and January 10, 1994.  Both memoranda, which recorded assignments for various White House officials on matters related to Whitewater, listed the following item:
<P>"11.<P>Memo re statute of limitations for civil actions
<P><P>(counsel - assigned 1/8)"(1067)  
These documents thus indicate that Mr. Ickes assigned Mr. Eggleston to research and write a memorandum on the statute of limitations issue, which Mr. Eggleston completed and submitted to Mr. Ickes on January 17, 1994.
<P>Also on February 20, 1996, the White House produced to the Special Committee notes taken by Mr. Ickes of a Whitewater meeting at the home of Vernon Jordan.(1068)  This meeting took place on January 16, 1994, proximate to Mr. Eggleston's memorandum to Mr. Ickes and before the February 2, 1994, meeting with Mr. Altman and Ms. Hanson.
<P>Although Mr. Ickes testified that "I can only recall what I have on my notes,"(1069) the notes indicate that the statute of limitations was one of three topics of discussion at the meeting.  Those notes read in relevant part:
     "(2)     Statute of limitations<BR>
               - no allegation that Clintons have broken any<BR>
                    law & therefore<BR>
               - we don't know what civil refers to<BR>
                    - always exception for fraud"(1070) <BR>
The documentary evidence thus contradicts Mr. Ickes' prior testimony that he did not discuss the statute of limitations issue prior to February 2, 1994.
<P>In addition, Mr. Ickes testified to Senate Banking Committee in July and August 1994 that he did not know whether two memoranda detailing the potential liability of the President and Mrs. Clinton to the RTC had been sent to Mrs. Clinton.  The Special Committee has discovered, however, evidence indicating that, at about the same time of Mr. Ickes' testimony, his attorney, presumably based on information from Mr. Ickes, informed the White House Counsel's office that Mr. Ickes had indeed sent the memoranda to Mrs. Clinton and that Mrs. Clinton had asked him questions about the memoranda.(1071)
II.<P>The White House Interfered with Treasury IG and RTC IG Investigations into White House-Treasury Contacts.
<P>On March 3, 1994, in response to the public disclosure of possible improper contacts between Treasury and White House officials concerning the RTC criminal referrals, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen publicly announced that he would seek an opinion from the Office of Government Ethics ("OGE") about the propriety of those contacts.(1072)  When Secretary Bentsen contacted the OGE about conducting an investigation, the OGE informed him that the agency had no investigation capability, but could opine on the propriety of certain conduct if provided with the factual background.(1073)  The OGE suggested that an investigation into the relevant facts be conducted by the RTC's Office of Inspector General ("RTC-IG") and the Treasury Department's Office of Inspector General ("Treasury IG") (collectively "IGs").(1074)  Secretary Bentsen then requested that the IGs conduct an "independent" investigation of contacts.
<P>Thus, on July 1, 1994, the RTC-IG and the Treasury IG commenced a joint investigation of the White House-Treasury contacts.(1075)  The joint IG investigation included examining White House, Treasury Department and RTC officials to determine "what the purpose of these contacts between the Treasury officials was, whether or not the purpose of the contact was to further some public interest or some private interest."(1076)  
<P>A.<P>Independence of IG investigation is compromised
<P>On June 22, 1994, prior to the commencement of the joint IG investigation, James Cottos, the Assistant Treasury IG in charge of the investigation, expressed concerns to the Acting Treasury IG Robert Cesca about involvement in the investigation by Francine Kerner, the Treasury IG Counsel.(1077)  Specifically, Mr. Cottos indicated that there might be a conflict because Ms. Kerner, a member of the Treasury's Office General Counsel ("Treasury OGC"), reported to Deputy Treasury General Counsel Dennis Foreman and to Treasury General Counsel Jean Hanson -- the persons whose actions were at issue in the investigation.(1078)  Mr. Cottos believed that because Ms. Kerner's overall evaluation would be performed by the Treasury OGC's -- the very office being investigated -- she might have divided loyalties.(1079)  
<P>Others involved in the investigation shared Mr. Cottos' concerns about Ms. Kerner's independence.  Clark Blight, the chief investigator for the RTC-IG, testified that, "[e]arly on it seemed like she was an advocate for the White House."(1080)  Patricia Black, Counsel to the RTC-IG, testified that she "had concerns because she [Kerner] was located organizationally within the Office of General Counsel, and this was an investigation of the highest ranking members of that office.(1081)  And John Adair, the RTC Inspector General, was sufficiently concerned about Ms. Kerner's involvement in the investigation that on or around June 2, 1995, he called Acting Treasury IG Robert Cesca,  to suggest that Ms. Kerner be removed from the case.  Mr. Adair suggested that Ms. Black act as counsel for both offices.(1082)   Because, unlike Ms. Kerner, Ms. Black had no potential conflicts of interests since she was not in a reporting chain with anyone whose conduct was a subject of the investigation.
<P> Although Mr. Cesca refused to remove Ms. Kerner from the investigation, he recognized the need to insulate the investigation from the influence of the Treasury OGC.  On June 27, 1994, Mr. Cesca sent a memorandum to Ms. Hanson stating that Ms. Kerner and her staff would "report solely to the Inspector General on any matters relating to the investigation."(1083)  In addition, neither Ms. Kerner nor her staff were to "communicate any information about the substance of this inquiry without specific authorization from the Inspector General."(1084)<P>  Assistant Treasury IG James Cottos was not satisfied, however, that the terms of the June 27, 1994 memorandum would protect against actual or perceived conflicts of interest related to Ms. Kerner's participation in the investigation, because her overall evaluation "would still be done by the general counsel's office."(1085) 
<P>Mr. Cottos became even more concerned about Ms. Kerner's participation in the investigation when he learned that during the course of "three or four" witness interviews, attorneys for witnesses told the IG investigators that they had reached agreements with Ms. Kerner limiting the scope of interviews.(1086)
<P>Ms. Kerner's interaction with witnesses' attorneys raised questions.  For example, on July 11, 1994, at 10:44 p.m. the night before the deposition of Treasury Chief of Staff Joshua Steiner, a central figure in the investigation, Ms. Kerner sent an e-mail to Mr. Cottos with proposed questions for the interview.(1087)  Ms. Kerner was scheduled to meet with Mr. Steiner's attorney, Reid Weingarten, 15 minutes later, at 11:00 p.m. that same night.(1088)  Ms. Kerner did not specifically recall meeting with Mr. Weingarten on the night of July 11th, but she testified that she did have two meetings with him.(1089)  Ms. Kerner could not explain why she met with Mr. Weingarten at 11:00 p.m. the night before Mr. Steiner's deposition.
<P>Mr. Cottos knew that Ms. Kerner had met with Mr. Steiner's attorney but he was not aware that she had met with him after she had suggested deposition questions to him by e-mail.  When he was informed about the timing of the meeting, Mr. Cesca admitted that if she had met with Mr. Weingarten shortly after sending the e-mail, "there is a perception that there could be a compromise."(1090)
<P>Meanwhile, on June 30, 1994, the Assistant Treasury IG James Cottos, Chief Investigator for RTC-IG Clark Blight and their respective investigative staffs learned that Treasury OGC officials wanted to obtain copies of witness interview transcripts to assist in preparing Treasury witnesses prepare for upcoming congressional hearings.  According to Mr. Blight, there was "a general agreement on the investigative side that the transcripts would be kept with the investigators, would not be released.  And that it is my recollection that Cottos was supportive of that."(1091) 
<P>Despite this agreement the Treasury OGC began to receive deposition transcripts form Ms. Kerner in early July.  According to Assistant General Counsel Kenneth Schmalzbach, Ms. Kerner provided deposition transcripts to him sometime between July 8, 1994 and July 13, 1994.(1092)  
<P>This exchange took place even though Mr. Schmalzbach and Ms. Kerner both knew that the June 27, 1994 memorandum had erected a "wall" with respect to Ms. Kerner's communication to the Treasury OGC.(1093) According to Mr. Cottos, Ms. Kerner was not supposed to communicate with members of the Treasury OGC about the transcripts.(1094).<P>
<P>Because the transcripts contained information about the "substance" of the investigation, this transfer of information from Ms. Kerner to Treasury OGC directly violated the terms of the June 27 memorandum.  According to RTC-IG John Adair, the transcripts contained 90% of the substance of the investigation(1095), including sensitive information about the ongoing investigation.(1096)  
<P>Ms. Kerner made this prohibited exchange of confidential RTC information without asking any of the other investigators, including Acting Treasury Inspector General Cesca, who only learned that the transcripts were forwarded to the Treasury OGC on July 18, 1994, when Ms. Kerner transferred the transcripts to Mr. Schmalzbach.(1097)  Mr. Cottos similarly was not informed about the transfer until July 18.(1098)  Neither Mr. Cottos nor Mr. Cesca recalled any conversation with Ms. Kerner about transferring transcripts to the Treasury OGC prior to July 18,(1099) and Mr. Cottos testified that he had objected to providing any transcripts to the Treasury OGC.(1100)  This transfer violated the terms of the June 27th memorandum.
<P>Members of the RTC-IG's office working on this "joint" and "independent" investigation were not consulted about Ms. Kerner's surrender of the confidential deposition transcripts to Ms. Hanson's staff.(1101)  The RTC-IG was not told about the transfer of the transcripts to the Treasury OGC until they were delivered.(1102)  In fact, RTC-IG John Adair had a conversation with Ms. Kerner on July 19, 1994 and she failed to mention the previous day's release of the transcripts to the Treasury OGC.(1103)  Mr. Blight, Chief Investigator for the RTC-IG, was surprised that the Treasury OGC had received copies of the transcripts, because he thought that the investigative staffs had agreed during the June 30, 1994 meeting that "nothing would be released until we had a final report."(1104)  According to Ms. Black, transferring transcripts to the office that was under investigation violated standard investigatory procedures(1105): "One the investigation was not complete and as everybody has said, was still open, and the second concern that I had was that the transcripts had privileged information in them . . . information concerning the underlying RTC criminal investigation."(1106)
<P>Mr. Schmalzbach and other members of the Treasury OGC prepared Treasury Secretary Bentsen and other Treasury witnesses, including Mr. Altman and Ms. Hanson, for Congressional testimony.(1107)  Mr. Schmalzbach first gained access to Ms. Hanson's deposition transcript "sometime after July 8 but before July 13."(1108)  The Senate Banking Committee deposed Ms. Hanson on July 14, 16 and 17, 1994.  
<P>Mr. Schmalzbach admitted that he attempted to obtain information from the IGs' investigation and fact finding, and to provide that information to the Treasury witnesses so they could prepare for Congressional testimony.(1109)  He further admitted that he knew Mr. Foreman and Ms. Hanson were to be "walled off," but believed he could use the transcripts to prepare Mr. Foreman and Ms. Hanson without advising them of the source of his information.(1110)  Mr. Altman's testimony as to whether he was told that President Clinton was upset about the manner of his recusal changed between the time of his deposition and his hearing testimony.(1111)
<P>The supposedly "independent report" submitted by the IGs to the OGE was edited by Treasury OGC.  On July 22, 1995, Acting Treasury Inspector General Cesca sent an initial draft of the joint IG report -- the report that would provide the factual basis for the OGE opinion -- to Treasury Secretary Bentsen.(1112) 
<P>During the drafting process, Mr. Cottos identified signs of bias on the part of Ms. Kerner toward the investigation of Ms. Hanson and others in the Treasury OGC. (1113)  Ms. Kerner edited the draft IGs report.(1114)   Mr. Cottos felt that Ms. Kerner's proposed edits "were slanting the facts or attempting to slant the facts that we had gathered in the initial draft."(1115)  Mr. Cottos explained to Ms. Kerner "that we were not the Jean Hanson defense team."(1116)  After the OGC obtained a draft of the IGs report, Stephen McHale, Deputy Assistant General Counsel, and two other OGC members sent suggested changes to Ms. Kerner,(1117) and she then sent them to the IGs.(1118)
<P>The suggested edits of the Treasury OGC were offered at a drafting session held by the IGs on July 28, 1995.(1119)  Ms. Kerner claimed that at the meeting she identified these as "some suggested edits from Mr. Schmalzbach's office."(1120)  According to Mr. Cottos, Ms. Kerner did not state that the suggestions were made by the OGC, but rather that the suggested changes were her own.(1121) 
<P>Counsel to the RTC-IG Black was disturbed when she learned what had happened because, "again information had gone outside the investigation."  Ms. Black stated that the IGs do not normally give a report to a general counsel's office for commentary.(1122)
<P>Treasury Secretary Bentsen was not aware that members of the Treasury OGC took advance copies of the transcripts or the draft report, or made substantive changes to the draft report that the IGs sent to the OGE.(1123) 
<P>At the July 28 meeting, the IGs also agreed that, although the transcripts would be appended to the final report submitted to the OGE, all confidential information concerning the RTC criminal referrals would be redacted.(1124)  During the meeting, Ms. Kerner left twice to call Mr. Schmalzbach to inform him that the RTC-IG was insisting that the transcripts be redacted before any public release.<P>  
<P>Ms. Kerner also called Mr. Schmalzbach to warn him that Ms. Kulka, General Counsel to the RTC, was threatening to testify that the investigation had come under the sway of the Treasury Secretary's office.  In an e-mail to Edward Knight, Secretary Bentsen's Executive Secretary, at 10:44 a.m. on July 28, Mr. Schmalzbach reported: 
<P>I just heard from IG Counsel Francine Kerner, who is meeting with RTC IG people to determine final changes in the IG's chronology.  At 11:30, that group will meet with Ellen Kulka, who is expected to argue that the transcripts of the IG's interviews should not be released at all with the IG's report. . . Accordingly you need to place the call to Jack Ryan, the deputy CEO at RTC, and not to Jack Adair. . . You also need to be aware of a piece of background.  Counsel to RTC's IG, Pat Black, is telling the morning's gathering of the IG people working on the report that if Kulka fails to win on the issue of not making the transcripts public, she is prepared to testify at the hearings that the IGs group has been under the sway of the Secretary in performing their investigation.(1125)
<P>Ms. Kerner admitted that Ms. Black advised her of Ms. Kulka's threat to reveal that the joint IG investigation was under the Treasury Secretary's sway, but she claimed that she did not recall contacting Mr. Schmalzbach to warn him.(1126)  
<P>B.  Confidential information is provided to the White House.
<P>Meanwhile, President Clinton named Lloyd Cutler as Special Counsel to the President to replace Bernard Nussbaum, who had resigned from the position of White House Counsel.  The President and White House Chief of Staff Mack McLarty instructed Mr. Cutler to conduct an internal investigation of the propriety of the conduct of White House personnel in connection with the White House-Treasury contacts.(1127)
<P>On June 21, 1994, Secretary Bentsen met with Mr. Cutler and agreed to share information gathered during the joint IG investigation with the White House.(1128)  Mr. Cutler indicated to Treasury Secretary Bentsen that the White House would like to obtain all of the IGs' interview transcripts, not just the transcripts of witnesses that the White House did not interview.(1129)  Mr. Cutler would coordinate the exchange of transcripts through Mr. Knight or by other members of Mr. Cutler's staff with Treasury Secretary Bentsen's staff.(1130)  Although Secretary Bentsen admitted that he had ordered the investigation to be under the control of the IGs, he had two or three meetings with Mr. Cutler about providing transcripts, and he "assured" Mr. Cutler that the Treasury would provide the transcripts to the White House in an expedited manner.(1131)  
<P>Mr. Knight testified that he was not aware that Mr. Cutler made a request to Secretary Bentsen to receive copies of the transcripts.(1132)  Mr. Knight specifically stated that "as far as requests [for transcripts] coming to me or the Secretary, I am aware of none."(1133)  Mr. Knight also denied that he had any discussions with anyone in the White House Counsel's Office about the transcripts in July of 1994.(1134)  He went as far to say that, "I think I have a fairly good recollection of when I talked to the counsel to the President of the United States.  I have no recollection of talking to him during the month of July.  Absolutely none."(1135)  
<P>Mr. Knight's testimony, however, was contradicted both by the documentary evidence and the testimony of Mr. Cutler.61   When asked about a July 5, 1994 meeting between the White House Counsel's Office, OGE, RTC-IG and Treasury IG -- a meeting at which White House Special Associate Counsel Jane Sherburne asked to receive copies of the transcripts and was rebuffed -- Mr. Cutler stated: "I remember calling Mr. Knight on a number of occasions in this time period on the issue of when we were going to receive the transcripts."(1136)  Mr. Cutler's calendar indicated that on July 6, 1994 he met with Mr. Knight and Treasury Assistant General Counsel Robert McNamara.  Mr. Cutler recalled that the meeting involved a discussion of the White House's "need to get transcripts and the fact that we had an understanding to that effect."(1137)  Mr. Cutler stated that the meeting resulted from a previous conversation he had with Mr. Knight about the RTC's objection to providing transcripts to the White House.(1138)
<P>Mr. Cutler stated that his plan in conducting the White House investigation rested on the Treasury's stated willingness to provide its deposition transcripts.  Indeed, by early July, officials in the White House Counsel's Office decided not to interview certain witnesses because they would obtain transcripts of those witnesses' depositions from Treasury.(1139)  
<P>When asked about any restrictions that may have been put on the use of the transcripts at the beginning of the investigation, Mr. Cutler once again referred to substantive conversations he had with Mr. Knight: "My recollection is I had discussions with Mr. Knight about the timing of when we would receive the transcripts in which he indicated to me that there were some objections from within the Treasury at lower levels as to delivering us the transcripts on a seriatim basis.(1140)  Mr. Cutler testified that at the time he began the White House internal investigation in early July, he understood that there was an agreement that the White House would be getting all the transcripts of the all the IGs depositions.(1141)  
<P>Secretary Bentsen did not recall whether he consulted either the RTC-IG Adair or the Acting Treasury IG Cesca about his decision to release the transcripts.(1142)  Mr. Cesca testified that he was not aware that Secretary Bentsen had agreed to provide the White House with the confidential transcripts.(1143) 
<P>During the July 5, 1994, Ms. Black told Ms. Sherburne that the White House could not have the transcripts.62 (1144)  Ms. Black explained that "we were adamantly opposed to the transcripts going outside of the investigatory circle."(1145)  Ms. Black testified that handing over the transcripts to either the Treasury OGC or the White House would have "violated our processes, it was not a normal investigative technique and of course, it can affect other witnesses' testimonies if they know what other witnesses have said."(1146)  
<P>Mr. Cottos expressed similar concerns stating, "I objected from the beginning about transcripts being given to anyone."(1147)  He worried about "other witnesses being able to read someone's testimony and possibly tailoring their own" testimony before the Senate Banking Committee.(1148) 
<P>Ms. Black informed RTC Inspector General Jack Adair that the White House made a request for transcripts, and that Ms. Sherburne's request had been rebuffed.  Mr. Adair believed that the issue had been settled.(1149)  Neither Mr. Adair nor Ms. Black were consulted prior to the surrender of the transcripts to the White House.(1150) 
<P>On July 18, 1994, Ms. Kerner sent Mr. Cottos an e-mail informing him that Ms. Sherburne had requested again to see IGs' transcripts to determine "whether there are inconsistencies with White House interviews."(1151)  On July 19, Mr. Cottos stated his opposition to Ms. Sherburne's request, and noted that, if anything, the IGs should be given copies of the White House's interviews.(1152)  Thus, as of at least July 19, 1995, Ms. Kerner was on notice that Mr. Cottos opposed providing the White House with deposition transcripts.
<P>Nevertheless, on July 23, 1994, Treasury OGC delivered copies of IG transcripts to members of the White House Counsel's Office.(1153)  On July 23, 1994, Mr. McHale of Treasury OGC sent a transmittal letter to Ms. Sherburne that documented that the Treasury OGC provided the White House copies of transcripts of depositions taken by the IGs' investigators. pursuant to certain restrictions placed on the use of the transcripts.(1154)  These transcripts contained confidential information related to the RTC criminal investigation of Madison Guaranty.(1155)  
<P>Secretary Bentsen testified that he "made the final judgement" to send the transcripts to the White House.(1156)  
<P>Acting Treasury IG Cesca, testified that on July 23, 1994, he learned that Mr. Cutler had requested the transcripts, and that this request came to him via the Treasury Secretary's office.(1157)  Mr. Cesca decided that it was not appropriate to release the transcripts to the White House.  As he put it, "[m]y concern centered around the fact that that was the essence of what we were investigating"(1158) and would raise the "same issue that we were investigating in terms of contacts between the Treasury and the White House."(1159)  
<P>Shortly thereafter, Mr. Cesca had a conference call with Ms. Kerner and Mr. McHale, who told him that Mr. Knight had called to inform him of "the [Treasury] Secretary's desire to release the transcripts to Lloyd Cutler."(1160)  Following this conversation, Mr. Cesca agreed to release the transcripts with certain restrictions.(1161)
<P>Whether or not the Acting Treasury IG's approval was needed is unclear in light of the testimony given by Mr. Cutler and Treasury Secretary Bentsen that they had already reached an agreement that the White House would receive the transcripts.  According to Mr. Knight, he did not know about the agreement to provide the transcripts until November 7, 1995,(1162) the day before his testimony before the Special Committee.  Mr. Knight claimed that he was approached by the Acting Treasury IG to ask Secretary Bentsen's opinion as to whether the transcripts should be released,(1163) and that the Secretary then told him that he thought it would be reasonable to cooperate with Mr. Cutler.(1164)   
<P>Although Mr. Cottos was the Treasury IG investigator responsible for investigation, and despite his previous objections to releasing the transcripts, he was not told about the transfer until two days after it occurred.(1165)  Mr. Cottos was "not very happy about" the transfer, and asked why he had not been consulted.(1166)  Mr. Cottos was still of the opinion that the transcripts should not have been released to anyone outside the investigation, "whether it be the White House, the Secretary, anyone else."(1167) 
<P>The RTC-IG officials testified that they were "shocked" when they learned that the transcripts had been turned over to the White House.(1168)  Ms. Black was "astounded" and "angry" when she was told of the transfer.(1169)   According to Ms. Black:
<P>We had vehemently objected to that, and it was done over our expressed objections without any consultation.  And this was -- again, to go back to the fundamentals, this was an investigation that we were doing into Treasury's leak of information to the White House, and they had done it again.(1170)
Similarly, Mr. Blight was "shocked that it happened . . . It is not something you do . . . The investigation was still open.  I mean the investigation was about the Treasury giving information to the White House, and here it goes again, the same thing."(1171)  Mr. Adair emphasized that it was not appropriate for the White House to seek access to unredacted transcripts because the "unredacted transcripts contained information about the criminal referrals, which basically was the reason we were conducting the investigation in the first place, to see whether any of that information had been provided by Treasury to the White House."(1172)
<P>The transmittal letter accompanying the transcripts contained the stipulation that the transcripts "are being provided solely to assist you in the preparation for Mr. Cutler's testimony before the House and Senate Banking Committees."(1173)  But, according to a May 8, 1995 Associated Press story, Mr. Cutler used the confidential transcripts to brief witnesses at the White House prior to their testimony before the House and Senate Banking Committees.(1174)  The article revealed that Mr Cutler stated that he would "confront" witnesses about discrepancies in their testimony, but denied that he would tell witnesses where he got his information; Mr. Cutler was quoted as saying, "I think it was perfectly appropriate to say that 'this is your testimony to us.  There is conflicting testimony.  Are you sure that's what you said?"'(1175).  
<P>Before the Special Committee, Mr. Cutler initially tried to distance himself from the comments attributed to him in the Associated Press story.  He stated that despite the suggestion in the May 8 article that the White House used the information they learned from the transcripts to prepare witnesses before they appeared before the Senate Banking Committee, they "did not do so."(1176)  But Mr. Cutler ultimately admitted that, "[w]e had the information from the transcripts in our heads and all we did was to say there may be some conflicting testimony, are you sure of what you've told us?"(1177)  In addition, the transcripts were used in preparing a report that was shown during a July 24, 1994 meeting at the White House for the private lawyers for the White House witnesses.  The report contained a White House "version" of the events.(1178)
<P>The Treasury OGC also transmitted summaries of deposition transcripts63  to the White House.(1179)  Inexplicably, these summaries were sent without a transmittal letter.(1180)  Mr. McHale, who supervised the preparation of the summaries,(1181) did not know how the summaries were sent to the White House.(1182)  Four other Treasury witnesses -- Mr. Knight, Mr. Schmalzbach, Mr. McHale and Mr. Dougherty -- also did not know.(1183)  Mr. Dougherty, an OGC attorney, denied that he delivered the summaries to the White House, stating, "I have no recollection of ever providing any summaries to anyone."(1184)
<P>In a July 27, 1994 memo to Ms. Sherburne, Sharon Conaway, an attorney in the White House Counsel's Office, described a conversation she had with Mr. Dougherty.  Ms. Conaway wrote that Mr. Dougherty "gave me summaries of the transcripts he did not realize we did not have and told me that the transcripts could be given to witnesses and their counsel."(1185)  Mr. Dougherty did not recall saying that to Ms. Conaway.(1186)  Ms. Sherburne testified that:
<P>On July 27th, 1994, I asked Sharon Conaway, a lawyer on our team, to ask Treasury whether it had lifted its condition on our use of the IG transcripts so that we could send the transcripts of Mr. Katsanos's IG testimony to counsel for Ms. Caputo (Mrs. Clinton's press secretary).  I recall that Ms. Conaway informed me that she spoke with David Dougherty, a lawyer in the general counsel's office at Treasury.  He advised her that Treasury had not lifted the restrictions on the transcripts themselves, but she told me that Treasury had a form of summary that it evidently believed did not raise the same concerns that caused it to restrict the use of the underlying transcripts.  And that there accordingly were no restrictions on the dissemination of these summaries.  Ms. Conaway told me that Dougherty offered to give these summaries to our review team, and that he did so.  She also told me based on Mr. Dougherty's advice, she sent the summary of Katsanos's IG deposition to Ms. Caputo's lawyer.(1187)
<P>Ms. Sherburne claimed that the White House received the summaries with the understanding that they were unrestricted.(1188)  Secretary Bentsen testified, however, that the summaries should have been subject to the same restrictions that applied to the transcripts.(1189)  That is, they could "be used only by his [Mr. Cutler's] staff and only for his testimony before the committee."(1190)  
<P>At least one deposition summary was sent directly to William Taylor, an attorney for a White House witness, Lisa Caputo, the Press Secretary to the First Lady.(1191)  The transfer of transcripts to the lawyers for one of the White House officials directly violated the restrictions contained in the July 23 transmittal letter, which prohibited the White House from disclosing the transcripts "to individuals (other than Mr. Cutler) who may be called as witnesses by either Committee.  Similarly, you have agreed not to disclose these transcripts to counsel for any such individuals."(1192)  
<P>During the 1994 Congressional hearings, held on the propriety of White House-Treasury contacts, Mr. Cutler also relied on the OGE opinion as evidence that no White House personnel had engaged in improper conduct.(1193)  Mr. Cutler represented to the Senate Banking Committee on August 4, 1994 that he had found no evidence of wrongdoing, and he said that the OGE had "informally concurred" with his conclusion that "no violation of any ethical standard . . . occurred."(1194)
<P>According to Stephen Potts, the Director of OGE, the OGE "did not do an analysis of the conduct of White House officials as to whether or not they violated the code of conduct."(1195)  In a November 8, 1995 letter, Mr. Potts confirmed that the "OGE did not `informally concur' in Mr. Cutler's conclusion that no violation of ethical standards occurred by any White House official."(1196)  Another OGE official, Jane Ley also testified that, "we didn't make any conclusions about the conduct of individuals in the White House."(1197)
<P>When confronted with Mr. Potts' statements that the OGE had not "informally concurred" with Mr. Cutler's findings that no White House officials had violated any ethical standards, Mr. Cutler admitted:
<P>Now, I may have gone too far when I testified before this Committee on August the 5th . . . . When I said that the Office of Government Ethics has informally concurred that they don't think any White House official has violated these ethical standards.(1198)64 
<P>When he was directly questioned about the inconsistencies between his August statements, and the assertions made by the OGE in November 8, 1995, letter, Mr. Cutler again admitted he may have "transgressed.65 "

III.<P>White House Interfered with the Special Committee's 1995-96 Investigation
<P>On January 5, 1994, in the midst of White House discussions over the appointment of a special counsel, James Hamilton advised President Clinton:

<P>The White House should say as little and produce as few documents as possible to the Press.  Statements and documents likely will be incomplete or inconclusive, and could just fuel the fires.(1199)  

Clearly, senior White House officials followed Mr. Hamilton's advice in producing documents to the Special Committee. 
<P>On June 2, 1995, the Special Committee sent its first request for documents to the White House.  Documents continued to trickle in from the White House until as late as May 11, 1996.  Some agencies, notably the RTC and the Justice Department, should be applauded for their efforts to produce documents.  The RTC produced more documents than any agency and did so in a timely manner.  Unfortunately, the White House and various persons associated with the White House were not nearly as forthcoming in producing their documents.  The Special Committee was forced to engage in protracted efforts to obtain documents.  Even worse, documents often were produced months after they were first requested or subpoenaed.
<P>A.<P>The refusal of William Kennedy to comply with the Special Committee's subpoena for his notes of the November 5, 1993 White House defense meeting.
<P>In response to a subpoena from the Special Committee on October 26, 1995, commanding the production of all documents in the White House's custody or control related to Whitewater, Madison Guaranty, CMS and related matters, the White House advised the Special Committee on November 2, 1995, that it would not produce a number of responsive documents on the grounds of privilege.  The withheld documents included notes taken by former Associate Counsel to the President William Kennedy at an important November 5, 1993 meeting of White House officials and the Clintons' private attorneys concerning Whitewater and Madison Guaranty.
<P>On December 5, 1995, Mr. Kennedy, citing the attorney-client privilege, refused to answer the Special Committee's questions about the substance of meetings.(1200)
<P>On December 8, 1995, the Special Committee issued a subpoena duces tecum to Mr. Kennedy directing him to "[p]roduce any and all documents, including but not limited to, notes, transcripts, memoranda, or recordings, reflecting, referring or relating to a November 5, 1993 meeting attended by William Kennedy at the offices of Williams & Connolly."  Mr. Kennedy refused to comply with the Special Committee's subpoena.  On December 14, 1995, after careful consideration, the Chairman overruled the objections to the subpoena, and the Special Committee voted to order Mr. Kennedy to produce the responsive documents by 9:00 a.m. on December 15, 1995.  After Mr. Kennedy failed to comply with this order and after unsuccessful efforts to reach agreement with the White House, the Special Committee voted on December 15, 1995, to report the matter to the Senate.(1201)
<P>On December 20, 1995, the full Senate adopted Senate Resolution 199, directing the Senate Legal Counsel to initiate a civil action in federal District Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1365 (1994), for an order requiring the witness to produce the subpoenaed documents.  If the district court determines that the witness has no valid reason to withhold the subpoenaed documents, the court would direct the witness to produce them.  If a witness disobeys that order, the witness could be found in contempt of court.  The district court, in its discretion, could order sanctions against the witness to induce compliance with its order to produce the documents.
<P>  On December 22, 1995, before the Senate Legal Counsel commenced a civil contempt proceeding, the White House reversed course, and Mr. Kennedy produced his notes to the Committee.  The notes were highly relevant to the Committee's investigation.  They provided evidence that confidential information, which the White House had inappropriately gathered from various agencies investigating Whitewater and Madison, was passed to the private lawyers representing President and Mrs. Clinton to assist their personal legal defense.  Although the White House claimed that certain confidential RTC information contained in the notes had also been reproduced in the press, the White House had information from Treasury officials with which to judge whether those press accounts were, in fact, accurate.  Beyond this, the notes contained details that identified additional investigative avenues for the Committee.
<P>B.<P>White House delays in producing highly relevant documents to the Special Committee. 
<P>On January 29, 1996 the White House produced the notes of White House Director of Communications Mark Gearan from meetings of the Whitewater defense team in January 1994.(1202)  These notes were relevant to inquiries by the Banking Committee during its hearings in 1994 as well as the inquiries of the Inspectors General from the Department of Treasury and the RTC.  When asked to explain the sudden appearance of these notes, Mr. Gearan stated that the notes "were inadvertently moved to the Peace Corps with other personal effects in boxes."(1203)  The White House Counsel's Office had told Mr. Gearan that they would take responsibility for document production from his White House files.(1204)  
<P>In October 1993, Mr. Gearan learned that the notes were removed from the White House and instructed an assistant to return these notes to the White House.(1205)  For reasons unknown, the notes were not returned:  
<P>The next point in time where this came to my attention was at the end of January, January 31st, I believe, where there was - in conversations with my counsel, who had been talking to the White House counsel, they had indicated to my counsel that they were having difficulty finding my files at the White House, which of course we found surprising, at which point I went back to the area where they were stored and found that the had not been returned as I had thought.  So, I called counsel and we immediately returned them to the White House counsel.(1206)
<P> 
Mr. Gearan came across the notes while going through his personal effects looking for pictures and other materials to put on his walls at the Peace Corps.(1207)  The White House eventually produced the notes to the Special Committee on January 29, 1996 and February 7, 1996.
<P>As a result of reviewing Mr. Gearan's notes, the Special Committee questioned several witnesses.  At least two of the witnesses, Mr. Lindsey and Mrs. Schaffer, had appeared before the Special Committee just weeks prior to the production of Mr. Gearan's notes.
<P>On February 13, 1996, the White House produced important documents from the files of Mr. Waldman, Special Assistant to the President.  Mr. Waldman claimed that he discovered these documents in his office  in a file marked "WWDC"--Whitewater Development Corporation--in the course of an office move.(1208) It is unclear why, if Mr. Waldman or the White House had conducted a proper search for documents, documents from a file marked "WWDC" were overlooked.
<P>Then, on February 20, 1996, the White House produced documents prepared by Mr. Ickes in January 1994.  In an explanatory letter for this production, the White House wrote that "two of the documents among this material had been provided by Mr. Ickes to the Counsel's Office in March of 1994.  Unfortunately, in the course of our review, we mistakenly overlooked them . . . As to the remainder of the material produced today, all from the early 1994 period, Mr. Ickes was under the mistaken belief that this material had been provided to the Counsel's Office and his private counsel in March of 1994."(1209)  
<P>Finally, on March 1, 1996, the day after funding for the Special Committee expired under S. Res. 120, Bruce Lindsey, Deputy Counsel to the President, produced notes concerning the November 5, 1993 Whitewater defense team meeting and other responsive documents.  The transmittal for Mr. Lindsey's notes stated cryptically that the documents "inadvertantly were not produced to you or the White House Counsel's office."(1210)

    <H2>THE ROSE LAW FIRM BILLING RECORDS</H2>
     Late in the afternoon on Friday, January 5, 1996, a messenger delivered a large, yellow manila envelope to the Special Committee.  Inside were 114 pages of documents, most measuring 11 by 17 inches, accompanied by a letter from David Kendall, lawyer for the Clintons.  Mr. Kendall wrote: "I enclose documents which we have stamped DKSN028928 to DKSN029043.  These documents were discovered yesterday by Ms. Carolyn Huber, Special Assistant to the President/Special Director of Correspondence."(1211)  The matter-of-fact tone of Mr. Kendall's prose belied the significance of this production.  The 114 enclosed pages, computer printouts of the Rose Law Firm's billings to Madison Guaranty, constitute the best, and therefore most important, evidence concerning Mrs. Clinton's representation of James McDougal's S&L in the mid-1980s--a relationship that was under investigation by at least three separate federal agencies.
<P>The records had been subject to several different federal subpoenas, besides that of the Special Committee, for nearly two years.  When federal investigators served their subpoenas, the billing records were nowhere to be found.  Despite extensive searches conducted by the Rose Law Firm, neither the originals nor copies were discovered.(1212)  The billing records were not in the firm's computers, its client files, or its storage facility.(1213)  The disappearance was not isolated, but rather occurred in the context of a larger pattern of removal, concealment and, at times, destruction of records concerning Mrs. Clinton's representation of Madison.
I.<P>The Destruction and Mishandling of Rose Law Firm Files.
<P>In 1988, Mrs. Clinton ordered the Rose Law Firm to destroy records relating to her representation of Madison.(1214)  This was not a routine destruction of records.  At the time, federal regulators were investigating the operations and solvency of Madison, in anticipation of taking over the institution.  These Rose Law Firm records, which, after Madison's failure would belong to the RTC,(1215) would have been directly relevant to that investigation.
<P>By ordering their destruction, Mrs. Clinton eliminated pertinent records and also exposed her firm to potential liability with respect to her representation.  If such representation was proper, as Mrs. Clinton has claimed, her document destruction deprived the law firm of the records necessary to defend itself in a suit by federal investigators.  Moreover, in 1988, Seth Ward, a former associate of Mr. McDougal and Webster Hubbell's father-in-law, was suing Mr. McDougal over the Castle Grande land deal that federal regulators have described as a fraud.(1216)  Mrs. Clinton had performed work on the project, including numerous telephones calls and meetings with Mr. Ward, and the law firm's records of her work and the transactions surrounding this land deal certainly would have been highly relevant to the conduct of that suit.
<P>The pattern recurred only a few years later.  According to the Rose Law Firm, Mr. Hubbell obtained some billing records reflecting Rose's representation of Madison in 1989 or 1990.  The Rose Law Firm represented to the Special Committee that a firm partner, then representing the RTC in litigation concerning Madison Guaranty, provided all billing records for Madison to Mr. Hubbell to ascertain whether the firm had a potential conflict of interest.(1217)  According to the Rose Law Firm: "The Rose partner was assured by Mr. Hubbell a few days later that the prior representation had been disclosed to the RTC.  Rose does not know what Mr. Hubbell did with the records."(1218)
<P>The mishandling of Madison documents continued during the 1992 presidential campaign.  After questions arose about the Clintons' investment with the McDougals in Whitewater and Mrs. Clinton's representation of Madison Guaranty before a state agency, Mrs. Clinton's then-law partner, Vincent Foster, collected all the information he could on the Madison representation from the Rose Law Firm's files.  At the conclusion of the campaign, the firm's files on Madison, which were by now the property of the RTC as conservator of Madison, as well as certain files of other Rose clients for whom Mrs. Clinton had performed legal services, were secretly removed from the firm by another then-Rose Law Firm partner, Webster Hubbell.  Mr. Hubbell removed these files, some of which were the firm's only copies,(1219) without obtaining the consent of the firm or client.(1220) 
II.<P>The "Disappearance" and "Discovery" of the Rose Law Firm Billing Records. 
<P>During the 1992 presidential campaign, on February 12, 1992, an unknown person printed out a set of the Rose Law Firm's computerized records of billings to Madison Guaranty.(1221)  These computerized records were the only source of detailed information about the services that the Rose Law Firm provided and billed to Madison Guaranty.  The records provide information well beyond that reflected in bills sent to Madison--such as the date services were performed, the amount of time expended by particular lawyers, and precise services performed, including the identity of persons with whom Rose lawyers spoke or met in the course of representing Madison.(1222)  
<P>Mr. Hubbell asserted that either he or former Deputy White House Counsel Vincent Foster, also a Rose partner, directed the Rose accounting department to print the billing records for Madison.(1223)  In addition to obtaining the computerized billing records, Mr. Hubbell also retrieved other files and documents relating to Mrs. Clinton's work for Madison:
<P>I recall in 1992 that the issue regarding our representation of Madison and specifically our work before the Arkansas Securities Department was of interest to Mr. Gerth of The New York Times, and that our firm was being questioned by people within the campaign about her work in that regard.  We did some work in trying to organize and pull up the files.  And in connection with that, bills were pulled and reviewed by myself and Mr. Foster and Mr. Massey, I believe.(1224) 
Because of allegations that Mrs. Clinton had a conflict of interest in appearing before her husband's appointee, Beverly Bassett Schaffer, Arkansas Securities Commissioner, Mr. Hubbell reviewed the records in 1992.  During his review, Mr. Hubbell made notations next to entries in the bills related to the firm's work in connection with Madison's novel proposed preferred stock offering before the Arkansas Securities Department.  According to Mr. Hubbell, "the issue then, way back when, was did Mrs. Clinton ever have any contact with the Arkansas Securities Department.  When we went back to the bills, that was the only, I believe, indication on the bills of a direct contact with the Arkansas Securities Department, so I underlined that -- probably gave that to Vince."(1225)
<P>Indeed, in notes taken during the 1992 campaign concerning Whitewater, Susan Thomases recorded a February 24, 1993 conversation with Mr. Hubbell about the Rose Law Firm's representation of Madison.  According to her notes, Mr. Hubbell told Ms. Thomases that Mrs. Clinton did all the billing for the Rose Law Firm to Madison, and that she had numerous conferences with Mr. McDougal, Madison President John Latham, and Rick Massey, then a junior associate at the firm.(1226)  Ms. Thomases' also indicated that Mrs. Clinton had reviewed some documents and that she had at least one telephone conversation with Ms. Schaffer in April 1985.(1227)  Ms. Thomases recorded in the margin of her notes next to this entry: "Acc. to time Rec."  She testified that "[t]his is my notation for according to time records,"(1228) and that the notation reflected what Mr. Hubbell had indicated to her.(1229)
<P>Ms. Thomases asserted, however, that she herself did not see the billing records,(1230) nor did she ever ask to see the time records.(1231)  Ms. Thomases further claimed that, other than her conversations with Mr. Hubbell in 1992, she never had any discussions with anyone about the billing records.(1232)  She contended that she had no knowledge concerning the handling of billing records and how records were transported from Little Rock to the White House Residence.(1233)
<P>In addition to Ms. Thomases, Mr. Hubbell discussed the contents of the records in 1992 with Loretta Lynch, an attorney working on Whitewater issues for the Clinton campaign.(1234)  Ms. Lynch testified that, in response to press inquiries, she talked to Ms. Schaffer and reviewed the files of the Arkansas Securities Department in an attempt to reconstruct Mrs. Clinton's role in representing Madison before state regulators.(1235)  During the course of this investigation, she and Ms. Thomases agreed that they should ask members of the Rose Law Firm about billing records.(1236)  Ms. Lynch talked to Mr. Hubbell about Mrs. Clinton's work for and billings to Madison Guaranty,(1237) who advised her that he had reviewed the Rose Law Firm's billing records concerning Madison Guaranty.(1238)  Ms. Lynch also knew that Mr. Foster had reviewed the billing records,(1239) but she does not recall speaking with anyone else at the Rose Law Firm regarding the billing records.(1240)  Ms. Lynch testified that she did not handle any records reflecting billings by the Rose Law Firm to Madison Guaranty, and that she had no knowledge regarding how those records came to be deposited in the White House Residence.(1241)
<P>When Mr. Hubbell and Mr. Foster reviewed the billing records in 1993, they spoke with each other about the Rose Law Firm's representation of Madison.  Mr. Hubbell identified the notes written by Mr. Foster in red ink on the billing records found in the White House Residence--e.g., "HRC--this suggests 1st matter"(1242) or "HRC I believe there was a subsequent bill"(1243).  These notes suggested to Mr. Hubbell that "[w]e were both working on it, and this is what he did to ultimately give it to somebody to indicate what was going on, what the records showed highlighted."(1244)  As of the time Mr. Hubbell handled the records, Mr. Foster had not written or made any notations on the records.(1245)  
<P>According to Mr. Hubbell, Mr. Foster was the last person he saw handling the billing records.(1246)  Mr. Hubbell did not know who removed the records from the Rose Law Firm,(1247) or how they came to be left in the White House Residence.(1248)  He claimed not to have spoken with anyone about the billing records since the 1992 presidential campaign.(1249)
<P>Mr. Hubbell stated that he may have spoken with Carolyn Huber, Special Assistant to the President and Special Director of Correspondence for the White House, about the records when she was the administrator of the Rose Law Firm, but not when she was at the White House.(1250)  When Mr. Hubbell learned that Ms. Huber had discovered the billing records in her office, "I kind of smiled."(1251)  According to Mr. Hubbell, "I know Ms. Huber, and it just didn't surprise me that all of a sudden she discovered them."(1252)  He explained, somewhat cryptically:  "First of all, I felt sorry for her, but just that all of a sudden, oh, you're looking for the billing records, here they are.  You know, it just wouldn't surprise me that something like that happened.  I read about it, but I just smiled about it."(1253)
<P>During the first two weeks of August 1995, while the Special Committee was holding hearings into the handling of documents in Mr. Foster's office at the time of his death, Ms. Huber testified that she saw the Rose Law Firm billing records for the first time.(1254)
<P>The billing records, which were subject to several different federal subpoenas, were in the Book Room, a small room on the third floor of the First Family's private quarters in the White House Residence.(1255)  The room is adjacent to Mrs. Clinton's private office and is accessible only to a limited number of private guests and staff.(1256)  Gifts, book, and memorabilia are stored in the Book Room until they can be catalogued and put away.(1257)  In the center of the room sits a large table where such memorabilia are piled.(1258)
<P>In early August 1995, Ms. Huber was gathering newspaper and magazine clippings in the Book Room when she noticed the records in clear view on the edge of the table.(1259)  The records were folded in half, and Ms. Huber recognized the records, from her experience at the Rose Law Firm, to be billing records.(1260)  Ms. Huber recalled that, specifically, the records were not on the table a week or two earlier when Ms. Huber was last in the Book Room.(1261)  Because Ms. Huber thought that the billing records were left in the Book Room for her to file,(1262) she placed the records in a box to be taken to her office without studying them.(1263)  White House ushers carried this box, along with several others, and placed them on the floor of Ms. Huber's office.(1264)  Later, a table was placed over these boxes.(1265)
<P>For several months, Ms. Huber forgot about the records.  Meanwhile, the Special Committee, continuing its investigation into activities and transactions relating to Whitewater and Madison, held several hearings in December 1995 on the extent of Mrs. Clinton's role in the Madison representation.  The billing records figured prominently in these hearings.  On December 1, 1995, Mr. Hubbell was unable to provide complete answers about the Mrs. Clinton's role in the Rose Law Firm's representation of Madison because he did not have the billing records to refresh his memory.(1266)  Likewise, Ms. Thomases testified on December 18, 1995, about her work during the campaign and her notes about billing records relating to Mrs. Clinton's work for Madison.
<P>On the morning of January 4, 1996, Ms. Huber was having new furniture placed in her office in the East Wing of the White House.(1267)  In the process, the table that had concealed the box containing the billing records for five months was removed.(1268)  Once the boxes were uncovered, Ms. Huber began to file the contents of the boxes.(1269)  As she was filing, Ms. Huber pulled the billing records out of their box and examined them more closely.(1270) 
<P>Immediately, Ms. Huber realized the billing records were related to Madison Guaranty.(1271)  She was horrified because she understood their significance; she had seen several subpoenas calling for the production of Madison Guaranty records, including these very records.(1272)  She had also assisted the President and Mrs. Clintons' personal counsel, David Kendall in searching and reviewing documents in the White House responsive to those subpoenas.(1273)  Ms. Huber contacted Mr. Kendall and asked him to meet her in her office as soon as possible because she had found some documents.(1274)  After calling Mr. Kendall, Ms. Huber called her attorney, Henry Shuelke.(1275)
<P>Early in the afternoon on January 4, Ms. Huber met with Mr. Kendall.(1276)  She gave him the records and explained her discovery.(1277) Worried, Ms. Huber asked Mr. Kendall whether she had done the right thing in contacting him.(1278)  Mr. Kendall assured Ms. Huber that she had made the correct decision.(1279)  Mr. Kendall examined the billing records and asked Ms. Huber whether she could identify the handwriting in red ink.(1280)  Ms. Huber identified some of the notations as Mr. Foster's handwriting.(1281)  Mr. Kendall then told Ms. Huber to maintain custody of the records,(1282) and that he would contact White House counsel and meet with her later in the day.(1283)
<P>Mr. Kendall then contacted Special Counsel to the President Jane Sherburne and Mr. Shuelke, who agreed to meet around 5:00 p.m. in Ms. Huber's office.(1284)  Ms. Sherburne informed her supervisor, Deputy Chief of Staff Harold Ickes, and her staff of the discovery of the billing records.(1285)  No one contacted the Independent Counsel or any other investigative agency, including the Special Committee.  Mr. Kendall and Ms. Sherburne claimed that they did not inform Mrs. Clinton on January 4 about the discovery of the billing records.(1286)
<P>Ms. Huber, Mr. Kendall, Ms. Sherburne and Mr. Shuelke met that evening.(1287)  Ms. Huber once again explained her discovery of the records.(1288)  Ms. Huber told the assembled attorneys -- as she also had testified to before the Special Committee -- that she clearly recalled seeing the records in early August 1995.  Ms. Huber and the lawyers together examined the billing records page by page.(1289)  Ms. Huber identified for them some of the handwriting on the billing records as Mr. Foster's and some as the Rose Law Firm bookkeeper.(1290)  In view of Mr. Foster's notes in red ink, the billing records were obviously a copy of the original records.(1291)  Other handwritten notes appear to have been made on the original and then copied.(1292)
<P> At one point in the meeting, Ms. Sherburne asked to speak with Mr. Kendall and Mr. Shuelke in the hallway.(1293)  Ms. Sherburne raised the issue of how the documents should be reproduced and whether the integrity of the documents should be preserved in case the records would later be examined for fingerprints.(1294)  The attorneys never considered contacting the Independent Counsel for advice on how best to proceed.(1295)
<P>Mr. Kendall and Mr. Shuelke returned to Ms. Huber's office and photographed the box in which Ms. Huber found the records earlier in the day.(1296)  Ms. Sherburne and Ms. Huber searched for a color copier in the White House offices.(1297)  After finding a copier, Ms. Huber made copies, while Ms. Sherburne collated and checked for completeness.(1298)    Two color copies of the billing records were made.(1299)  Mr. Kendall took the original set of the billing records and one copy with him that evening.  Ms. Sherburne took the other copy of the billing records to examine and to keep for White House records.(1300)
<P>The next morning, January 5, 1996, Mr. Kendall and Ms. Sherburne notified the Independent Counsel of the discovery of the billing records.(1301)  That same morning, Ms. Sherburne informed President Clinton of their discovery.(1302)  Later that afternoon, Mr. Kendall produced a copy of the billing records to the Special Committee.(1303)  Copies of the billing records were also produced to the other investigative agencies.(1304)
III.<P>Mrs. Clinton's Statements in Light of the Rose Law Firm Billing Records. 
<P>The billing records provide the best evidence of the legal services performed by Mrs. Clinton for Madison Guaranty and, as a result of the failed memories of many Rose Law Firm attorneys, are the only source of detailed information about the legal services rendered to Madison.  Whereas the bills and statements sent to clients indicate only the total amount due and the general services performed, these computerized billing records provide detailed information on the specific task performed, the date that it was performed, the person who performed the task, and the amount of time expended on the task.(1305)  The computerized billing records are thus an invaluable asset in reconstructing Mrs. Clinton's actual involvement in the matter.  This is especially so with respect to Mrs. Clinton's billings to Madison, because her timesheets were apparently destroyed in 1988.(1306) 
<P>In total, Mrs. Clinton billed Madison Guaranty for 89 tasks, including 33 conferences with Madison Guaranty officials, on 53 separate days.(1307)   
<P>A.   Madison's retention of the Rose Law Firm
<P>During the 1992 campaign, the Clinton campaign sought the facts surrounding the Rose Law Firm's retainer with Madison Guaranty in 1985 and 1986.  In a March 18, 1992 memorandum to senior campaign officials Bruce Lindsey and David Wilhelm, Loretta Lynch noted that the campaign had conducted an exhaustive review of available documents, but certain questions regarding the retainer remain that "simply must be answered by Hillary and Bill themselves."  Among these questions were:
<P>1.  Did Bill Clinton solicit a retainer agreement for the Rose Law Firm from Jim McDougal?  If so, when did that happen and what were its terms?  Who, other than Jim and Susan were privy to that discussion? 

<P><P><P><P><P>* * *

<P>7.  When was the Rose Law Firm put on retainer by McD and for what business (LL has asked Webb Hubbell this question numerous times.  The answer continues to change, despite the repeated press inquiries on this exact point).(1308)
<P>This memorandum was prepared after the Clinton campaign had already released a fact sheet stating that Richard Massey, a young associate in the Rose Law Firm in 1985, was responsible for the retainer--not Mrs. Clinton:
<P>The Rose Law Firm was retained to represent Madison Guaranty.  The business was brought to the firm not by Hillary Clinton but by Richard Massey, long time friend of John Latham, Madison's CEO.(1309)
 
<P> The circumstances surrounding the Rose Law Firm's retainer with Madison were not resolved during the 1992 campaign.  Mrs. Clinton, and others on her behalf, have repeatedly made statements that Mr. Massey brought in Madison Guaranty as a client and that, even though she was the billing partner on the matter, she was merely a "backstop" because the firm did not permit associates to bill clients directly.(1310)
<P>During a press conference on April 22, 1994, Mrs. Clinton stated that Mr. Latham, the President of Madison Guaranty, asked Mr. Massey whether he would be interested in representing Madison in connection with a proposed stock offering.  Mrs. Clinton claimed that she became involved in the matter only because Mr. Massey "needed a partner to serve as his backstop, and that was one of the rules of our firm."(1311)  Mrs. Clinton further explained that Mr. Massey was aware that she knew Mr. McDougal, so "he came to me and asked if I would talk with Jim to see whether or not Jim would let the lawyer and the officer go forward on this project.  I did that, and I arranged that the firm would be paid $2,000 retainer."(1312)  
<P>In an unsworn statement to the RTC in November 1994, Mrs. Clinton similarly told investigators that "she recalled Massey came to her and asked her to be the billing attorney which was a normal practice when an associate was handling the matter. . . .Mrs. Clinton recalled that a Madison official (individual unknown) approached Rick Massey regarding a preferred stock offering in an effort to raise capital."
<P> In a sworn response to an RTC interrogatory in May 1995, Mrs. Clinton elaborated on her story.  Mrs. Clinton stated that Mr. Massey approached her because "certain lawyers" in the Rose Law Firm were "opposed" to representing Mr. McDougal until Mr. McDougal paid an outstanding bill, and he was aware that Mrs. Clinton knew Mr. McDougal.  Mrs. Clinton wrote:
<P>In the spring of 1985, Massey came to see me because he had learned that certain lawyers at the firm were opposed to doing any more work for Jim McDougal or any of his companies until he paid his bill and then only if Madison Guaranty agreed to prepay a certain sum. . . I believe Massey approached me about presenting this proposal to Jim McDougal because  he was aware that I knew him.
<P>Mr. Massey, however, directly contradicted Mrs. Clinton's account in sworn testimony before the Special Committee.  According to Mr. Massey, he was not responsible for bringing in Madison as a client.(1313)  Mr. Massey testified specifically that Mr. Latham never offered him Madison's business,(1314) and that he did not recall approaching Mrs. Clinton with a proposal to represent Madison.(1315)  Mr. Massey also indicated that he did not ask Mrs. Clinton, as she claimed, to be the billing attorney.(1316)
<P>David Knight, a former Rose partner specializing in securities law, testified that he attended the lunch meeting during which, according to Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Latham allegedly retained Mr. Massey and the Rose Law Firm.(1317)  Mr. Knight confirmed Mr. Massey's testimony that Mr. Latham did not ask Mr. Massey to represent Madison on the preferred stock offering.  Quite to the contrary, according to Mr. Knight, the subject of that stock offering never arose.(1318)  In fact, Mr. Latham informed Messrs. Knight and Massey at the lunch that Mr. McDougal made all hiring decisions and that Madison already had outside counsel.(1319)
<P>Mr. Latham testified that Mr. McDougal, not he, made the decision to retain the Rose Law Firm.(1320)  In an interview with RTC investigators, Mr. Latham similarly stated that "McDougal had friends over there and he suggested we use them.  When asked who the friends were Latham said that they were Hillary Rodham Clinton and others."(1321) 
<P>Mr. McDougal has also contradicted Mrs. Clinton's account about the retainer.  Mr. McDougal has stated that he put Mrs. Clinton on retainer as a favor to then-Governor Clinton.  In 1992, Mr. McDougal told Jim Blair and Loretta Lynch that Governor Clinton, wearing jogging pants, visited his office and told him that he and Mrs. Clinton were pressed for money and asked Mr. McDougal to give some work to Mrs. Clinton.(1322)  Two hours later, Mrs. Clinton visited Mr. McDougal to set up the retainer.(1323)  According to notes taken by Mr. Blair, Mr. McDougal said that he remembered the encounter "explicitly" because Governor Clinton, in his exercise clothes, left a permanent stain on Mr. McDougal's "new leather contour chair."(1324)
<P>In 1993, Mr. McDougal repeated this account of the so-called "jogging" incident to the Los Angeles Times.  Governor Clinton reportedly dropped by Mr. McDougal's trailer office, told Mr. McDougal that the Clintons were financially strapped, and asked Mr. McDougal to throw some work to Mrs. Clinton.(1325)  Mr. McDougal also repeated to the newspaper what he had told Mr. Blair: "I hired Hillary because Bill came in whimpering they needed help." Mr. McDougal said he had no specific legal work in mind when he hired Mrs. Clinton.(1326)  That same day, Mrs. Clinton visited Mr. McDougal's office, and Mr. McDougal put her on retainer for $2000 a month.
<P>On May 8, 1996, during the Tucker-McDougal trial in Little Rock, Mr. McDougal revised his story somewhat.  He testified that President Clinton came by one morning and, "I said to Bill something to the effect of, `We're needing more legal work.  Would it help Hillary if we gave some of the work to the Rose Firm?' And he said yes."(1327)  Mr. McDougal did not recall telling Mr. Blair that Bill Clinton specifically said he "needed" money.(1328)  Although Mr. McDougal denied stating in an FBI interview that "Clinton came in claiming he had financial problems,"(1329) he did recall that Mrs. Clinton "came by the same day" to set up the retainer.(1330)  
<P>At the Tucker-McDougal trial, President Clinton testified that he recalled visiting Mr. McDougal, but did not recall asking Mr. McDougal to place Mrs. Clinton on retainer.(1331)
<P>Mrs. Clinton's account of her role in connection with the Madison retainer turns on the alleged existence of a debt that Mr. McDougal's Madison Bank & Trust owed to the Rose Law Firm in 1985.  According to Mrs. Clinton, she insisted on the $2000 per month retainer to assure her partners that Mr. McDougal would pay the firm's fees--an issue that, she claims, arose because of Mr. McDougal's failure to pay fees owed to the Rose Law Firm in connection with its representation of Madison Bank & Trust.
<P>Documentary evidence and testimony provided to the Special Committee, however, indicate that the outstanding balance of Rose's bill to Madison Bank & Trust was paid in late October 1984, many months prior to Mrs. Clinton's retainer in April 1985.
<P>Gary Bunch, President of Madison Bank & Trust since 1970, provided the Special Committee with documents showing that the legal fees owed to the Rose Law Firm were paid in late October 1984.  The Minutes of Madison Bank & Trust for October of 1984 indicate that $5,000 in legal fees were owed to the Rose Law Firm for work on the "Huntsville move appeal,"(1332) a matter concerning the relocation of the bank, and that "Mr. McDougal seconded that Mr. Bunch will negotiate settlement with the firm."(1333)  Mr. Bunch confirmed that Mr. McDougal directed him to pay the outstanding Rose Law Firm bill for the Madison Bank & Trust matter in full in October 1984.(1334) 
<P>A receipt from Madison Bank & Trust's debit ledger show $5,000 in legal fees were paid on October 23, 1984.(1335)  In addition, the bank's minutes for November 27, 1984 confirm this payment: "The reduction in earnings was attributed to heavy accounting fees for the audit and a payment of legal fees from 1983 lawsuit."(1336) 
<P>Among the billing records discovered in the Book Room of the White House Residence was a 1981 bill from the Rose Law Firm to Madison Bank & Trust.  This bill, for over $13,000, was marked "Paid."  A note in Mr. Foster's hand, however, stated: "HRC I believe there was a subsequent bill."(1337)
<P>Following the discovery of the billing records and the testimony of Mr. Massey before the Special Committee, Mrs. Clinton changed her story in a February 1996 interview with RTC investigators.  According to Mrs. Clinton, the late Vincent Foster, not Mr. Massey, first informed her that Mr. Massey wanted to do work for Madison: "I believe it was Vince Foster who came to me, who said that Mr. Massey wanted to do this work, but the partners didn't want him to do it."(1338)  When asked who suggested that she approach Mr. McDougal, Mrs. Clinton answered:  "I don't have a specific recollection.  I believe it was Vince Foster, but I'm not positive."(1339)
<P>B.<P>Mrs. Clinton's contacts with regulator Beverly Bassett Schaffer.

<P>In 1985, the Rose Law Firm represented Madison in connection with a proposal for a preferred stock offering before the Arkansas Securities Department.  During the 1992 campaign, allegations surfaced that Beverly Bassett Schaffer, who Governor Clinton appointed as Arkansas Securities Commissioner, gave preferential treatment to Madison Guaranty because of her relationship with the Governor and Mrs. Clinton.  The Clinton campaign denied that Mrs. Clinton attempted to influence Commissioner Bassett.  
<P>The billing records show that Mrs. Clinton called Ms. Schaffer the day before the Rose Law Firm submitted Madison's proposal for its preferred stock offering to the Arkansas Securities Department.(1340)  The records reflect that Mrs. Clinton billed as much as one hour to the call.(1341)  Ms. Schaffer notified Mrs. Clinton of the approval of the proposal two weeks later in a letter addressed to "Dear Hillary."(1342)
<P>Prior to the discovery of the billing records, Mrs. Clinton claimed in her sworn responses to RTC interrogatories in May 1995 that she called the Arkansas Securities Department to find out "to whom Mr. Massey should direct any inquiries."(1343)  She did not recall to whom she spoke.(1344)
<P>In testimony before the Special Committee, former Commissioner Schaffer directly contradicted Mrs. Clinton and stated that the proposal was discussed during the phone call.  According to Ms. Schaffer:
<P>  [Mrs. Clinton] called and said they had a proposal, and what it was about; and I said I'm familiar with that; I've already looked at that.  You know, I agree with the-basically I have no problem with that position, and you'll be getting a letter soon to that effect. . . .  I think in substance I said, basically,I agree with the position-I mean, that preferred stock can be issued pursuant to the Business Corporation Code.(1345) 

<P>Mr. Massey similarly disputed Mrs. Clinton's account of the phone call to Ms. Schaffer.  Mr. Massey testified that he drafted the proposal and knew exactly to whom the proposal should be sent.(1346)  Mr. Massey further testified that Mrs. Clinton never instructed him about whom to address the transmission letter.(1347)  Mr. Massey did not recall asking Mrs. Clinton to make such an inquiry and was not aware that she had.(1348)

<P>C.<P>Mrs. Clinton's role in Madison's proposed preferred stock deal. 

<P>Mrs. Clinton has minimized her role in the Rose Law Firm's representation of Madison before the Arkansas Securities Department in connection with Madison's proposed stock offering.  Although she was the billing partner, Mrs. Clinton has denied that she handled much of the workload on the matter. When asked about the subject during a press conference on April 22, 1994, Mrs. Clinton told reporters that "the young attorney, the young bank officer did all the work. . . . It was not an area that I practiced in it was not an area that I really know anything to speak of about."(1349)
<P>In a 1994 sworn statement to the FDIC, Mrs. Clinton similarly stated: 
<P>While I was the billing partner on the matter, the great bulk of the work was done by Mr. Richard Massey, who was then an associate at the Rose Law Firm and whose specialty was securities law.  I was not involved in the day to day work on that project. . . Mr. Massey primarily handled the matter. . . I was not involved in any meetings with state regulators. . . .(1350)

Mrs. Clinton likewise told RTC investigators in 1994 that Mr. Massey was the lead attorney on the matter.(1351)  And, in sworn interrogatories to the RTC in May 1995, Mrs. Clinton stated, "While I was the billing partner on the matter, the great bulk of the work was done by Mr. Richard Massey, who was then an associate at the Rose Law Firm and whose specialty was securities law."  Mrs. Clinton added that "I was not in charge of the Rose Law Firm's work for Madison Guaranty in 1985-86, although I was the billing partner."(1352)  
<P>The billing records and Mr. Massey's testimony directly contradict Mrs. Clinton's claim that her role on the matter was merely to serve only as a "backstop."  Mrs. Clinton billed 6.2 hours on the preferred stock deal for conferences alone that she had with Mr. McDougal, with Mr. Latham and Davis Fitzhugh, two other Madison S&L officers involved in the stock offering.(1353)  In addition, Mrs. Clinton had at least six conferences with Mr. Massey, the young Rose Law Firm associate on the matter.(1354)  Mrs. Clinton also reviewed the amendments to the application submitted to the Arkansas Securities Department.(1355)
<P>Mr. Massey testified that he did his work under the supervision of Mrs. Clinton.(1356)  According to Mr. Massey, "Mrs. Clinton was the billing attorney and had a relationship with me such that she needed to know what I was doing so she could be prepared to update the client at any time."(1357)  When asked whether Mrs. Clinton's work on the stock proposal deal was "minimal," Mr. Massey responded, "In my own mind it's a significant amount of time."(1358) 
<P>D.<P> Mrs. Clinton's role in the Castle Grande transaction.

<P>Before the billing records were discovered, little was known about the nature of the Rose Law Firm's representation of Madison Guaranty in connection with the Castle Grande land transaction.  Perhaps because Mrs. Clinton had ordered the destruction of Madison-related records in 1988, the Rose Law Firm no longer possessed any file related to the Castle Grande deal.
<P>Federal investigators described the Castle Grande transactions as a series of land flips and transactions that cost the American taxpayers $4 million.(1359)  The land deal was designed to conceal Madison Guaranty's investment in Castle Grande through its subsidiary, Madison Financial Corporation.  Mr. Ward was the "straw man" purchaser in the project--one who lends his name to the title, but does not actually have an ownership interest.(1360)  Arkansas regulations limited an S&L's direct investment in its subsidiaries or affiliates to 6 percent of total assets.(1361)   Mr. Ward was needed as the straw man because "had MGSL purchased Castle Grande directly, they would have exceeded their direct investment limit."(1362)  Madison, in effect, paid for Mr. Ward's share in the venture, and was promised $300,000 in commissions for lending his name. 
<P>In 1995, when the RTC asked about her knowledge of Castle Grande, Mrs. Clinton stated "I do not believe I knew anything about any of these real estate parcels and projects." (1363)  The billing records suggest otherwise.
<P>The billing records identify Mrs. Clinton as the billing partner on the matter--even though Mrs. Clinton claimed that she had no idea how the Rose Law Firm became involved in the matter.(1364)  These records indicate that Mrs. Clinton billed more time on the Castle Grande matter--29.5 hours, or 54 percent of total billings on the matter--than any other lawyer at the Rose Law Firm.  Indeed, nearly half of Mrs. Clinton's total billings to Madison were for work on Castle Grande.  In the months following the initial transaction, Mrs. Clinton had at least 12 conferences with Mr. Ward and numerous meetings with Madison officials in connection with the subsequent sales that she billed to the IDC/Castle Grande matter.  One of the conferences with Mr. Ward even related to "the purchase from Brick Lile," the seller of the IDC/Castle Grande property.  Mrs. Clinton also had conferences with two attorneys who were involved in the initial transaction -- Thomas Thrash, the associate at the Rose Law Firm who attended the closing, and Daryl Dover, the attorney for the seller.
<P>In January 1986, Mrs. Clinton tripled Rose's bill to Madison for her work on the Castle Grande/IDC matter without providing any supporting information.  Mrs. Clinton has claimed that this fee, representing 14.5 hours, was for work that she did between January 15 and January 30, 1986, which she forgot to enter on her time sheets as "work in progress."(1365) 
<P>After the discovery of the billing records, Mrs. Clinton attempted to explain the apparent contradiction between her statements about her minimal involvement in the Castle Grande transaction and the billing records.  In a television interview, Mrs. Clinton explained that she did not know the Castle Grande property by this name, and that the matter she worked on was known by the name of the seller, IDC.  She explained that it was a "separate deal" entirely: 
<P>Again, there's not a contradiction.  Castle Grande was a trailer park on a piece of property that was about 1,000 acres big.  I never did work for Castle Grande.  Never at all.  And so, when I was asked about it last year, I didn't recognize it, I didn't remember it.  The billing records show I did not do work for Castle Grande.  I did work for something called IDC, which was not related to Castle Grande. . . . Separate deal completely.(1366)  
When asked by the Pillsbury Firm what she meant by "separate deal," Mrs. Clinton gave a similar answer:
<P>Well, my understanding is that the work for Madison concerned property that was referred to then at the time and continually by the Rose Firm as IDC or Industrial Development Corporation property.  I know that work as IDC.  That's how it was billed.  And I did not know that there was something called Castle Grande, to the best of my recollection, until it came to my attention through these investigations, the entire thousand acres that we referred to as IDC was being called Castle Grande . . . .

<P>I was informed sometime within the last year or two that there was a trailer park on the IDC property called Castle Grande Estates.  To the best of my recollection, that was the first I had ever heard of Castle Grande Estates.(1367) 

<P>Substantial evidence, however, contradicts Mrs. Clinton's statements concerning the name of this project.  Madison Guaranty officials and federal regulators all commonly referred to the entire parcel of land as "Castle Grande."  Television advertisements in Little Rock promoting the land development referred to the land as "Castle Grande."  Susan McDougal told ABC news that the entire development was considered "Castle Grande."  Internal Madison Board Minutes dated September 12, 1985, referred to  "Castle Grande Estates."  Harry Don Denton, a Madison officer, testified at the Tucker-McDougal trial that the entire property was named Castle Grande immediately after its purchase from IDC.(1368)  Finally, records reflecting a meeting between Alston Jennings, former attorney for Mr. Ward, and Mr. Kendall, the Clintons' attorney, on January 11, 1996--the week after the billing records were discovered--referred to "Castle Grande."(1369)  No mention was made of IDC.(1370)
<P>More important than the mere extent of her services related to the Castle Grande, however, is the nature of her work.  For his role as the "straw man" and other related services to the project, Mr. Ward was owed a commission.  On March 31, 1986, Madison Guaranty loaned $400,000 to Mr. Ward.(1371)  One week later, on April 7, 1986, Madison Financial Corporation, a subsidiary of Madison Guaranty, executed two promissory notes, for $300,000 and $70,943, purporting to reflect loans from Mr. Ward to Madison Financial.(1372)  Thus, except approximately $30,000 for administrative expenses, the two Madison Financial notes offset Mr. Ward's debt to Madison Guaranty.  At the end of the day, Mr. Ward kept the bulk of the $400,000 as his commission for the Castle Grande fraud.
<P>At about this time, bank examiners were auditing Madison Guaranty's books, and James Clark, the chief examiner, asked whether the three notes were related.(1373)  Madison official, Mr. Denton, assured him that these notes were not related.(1374)  According to Madison official John Latham, however, the three notes were related, and the $400,000 March 31 loan from Madison Guaranty was intended to pay Mr. Ward's commissions.(1375)
<P>The Rose Law Firm billing records revealed for the first time that on April 7, 1986, the day the Madison Financial notes were executed, Mrs. Clinton billed 10 minutes to the IDC/Castle Grande matter for "Telephone conference with Don Denton."(1376)  A message slip produced by Mr. Denton reflects that Mrs. Clinton called him from the Rose Law Firm on April 7, 1986.(1377) In a June 11, 1996 interview with FDIC investigators, Mr. Denton stated that Mrs. Clinton called seeking copies of the notes between Mr. Ward, Madison Financial, and Madison Guaranty.(1378)  Mr. Denton told investigators that during the conversation he cautioned Mrs. Clinton that a problem might exist with respect to the April 7th notes to Mr. Ward because "they constituted in effect a parent entity fulfilling the obligation of a subsidiary,"(1379) a violation of the so-called direct investment rule.  Mrs. Clinton, however, "summarily dismissed" that concern in a way that he took to mean that "he would take care of savings and loan matters, and she would take care of legal matters."(1380)
<P>The billing records showed that on May 1, 1986, Mrs. Clinton billed Madison Guaranty for two hours for the following work: "Conference with Seth Ward; telephone conference with Seth Ward regarding option; telephone conference with Mike Shauffler; prepare option."(1381)  Indeed, a May 1 option agreement between Mr. Ward and Madison Financial bore a word processing code ("0190g") that, according to the Rose Law Firm's counsel, indicates the document was created at the Rose Law Firm by or for Mrs. Clinton.(1382)<P>  The May 1st agreement gave Madison an option from Mr. Ward to convey his portion of the Castle Grande property back to Madison.  Mr. Clark, the bank examiner, told investigators that, after reviewing the records and in light of Mr. Denton' testimony, he believed that the May 1st option prepared by Mrs. Clinton "was created `in order to conceal the connection--whatever it was--between'" the March 31st and April 7th notes.(1383)
<P>On June 13, 1996, in light of the significant new evidence offered by Mr. Denton and Mr. Clark relating to the extent and nature of Mrs. Clinton's role in Castle Grande, the Special Committee requested that Mrs. Clinton "refresh her memory about these transactions, and to inform the Special Committee of what she recalls about them" in writing, under oath."(1384)  In her response affidavit, Mrs. Clinton did not answer the question, but simply referred to her attorney's transmittal letter "addressing certain allegations recently made by Mr. Don Denton."(1385)  In his letter, Mr. Kendall maintained that Mr. Denton's recollection is "wholly unreliable"66  but gave no indication as to the recollection of the First Lady.(1386)  Mrs. Clinton, therefore, has neither denied nor confirmed Mr. Denton's account.  
IV.<P>The Federal Investigations into the Rose Law Firm's Representation of Madison.
<P>When the FDIC assumed control of Madison in 1989, Madison had a pending lawsuit against its former independent accountants, Frost & Company ("Frost").(1387)  The suit was filed in 1988 by the Memphis law firm of Gerrish & McCreary and alleged malpractice on the part of Frost in connection with its audits of Madison performed in 1984 and 1985.(1388)  The Frost litigation was assigned to FDIC attorney April Breslaw, who removed Gerrish & McCreary from the case and hired the Rose Law Firm to handle the matter.(1389)  Rose partner Webster Hubbell was the billing partner and lead trial counsel on the case.(1390)  Although the original claim was for $10 million, Rose settled the case in late February 1991 for $1.025 million.(1391)  The firm was paid $375,380 for its work.(1392)
<P>In 1994, the FDIC Office of the Inspector General ("FDIC-IG") and the RTC-IG began investigations into possible conflicts of interests related to the Rose's representation of those agencies in the Frost litigation.
<P>During a February 24, 1994 hearing before the Senate Banking Committee, Ranking Member Alfonse D'Amato raised questions about a February 17, 1994 report of the FDIC Legal Division regarding the FDIC's hiring of Rose as counsel with respect to Madison.(1393)  This report was prompted by stories appearing in the media in late 1993 and early 1994 alleging that Rose had failed to disclose conflicts related to its representation of Madison before the Arkansas Securities Department and the litigation against Madison brought by Mr. Hubbell's father-in-law, Seth Ward.(1394)  The FDIC Legal Division concluded that neither Rose's representation of Madison before the Arkansas Securities Department nor Mr. Ward's suit against Madison constituted a conflict.(1395)  At Senator D'Amato's urging,(1396) then FDIC Acting Chairman Andrew C. Hove agreed to ask the FDIC-IG to conduct an investigation.(1397)
<P>On February 8, 1994, the RTC's Office of Contractor Oversight and Surveillance ("OCOS") issued a report dismissing allegations of conflicts of interest related to Rose's representation of the RTC in the Frost case.(1398)  On February 24, 1994, RTC Interim Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") Roger Altman agreed to ask the RTC-IG to review the OCOS Report.(1399)  On March 2, 1994, RTC Deputy and Acting CEO John Ryan requested that the RTC-IG investigate the matters raised in the OCOS Report.(1400)
<P>The FDIC-IG issued its report on July 28, 1995, days before Ms. Huber discovered the billing records in the Book Room of the White House Residence.  In the course of its investigation, the IG reviewed (1) the alleged conflicts of interest related to the FDIC's retention of Rose; (2) the FDIC Legal Division's conflicts report; (3) and certain legal fee payments made by the FDIC to Rose.(1401)  
<P>With respect to the conflicts related to the FDIC's retention of Rose, the IG concluded that the Rose Law Firm and, specifically, that Mr. Hubbell had failed, as required by ethical rules, to disclose the firm's prior representation of Madison.  The FDIC-IG reported:
<P>The results of our investigation evidenced conflicting relationships among the Rose Law Firm, Rose partner Webster L. Hubbell, and Mr. Hubbell's father-in-law since 1971, Seth Ward.  During the time that Mr. Hubbell represented the Madison Conservatorship on behalf of the FDIC, Mr. Hubbell's father-in-law was engaged in litigation adverse to the Madison Conservatorship.  We found that neither the Firm nor Mr. Hubbell had informed FDIC of these relationships when the Firm was hired in March 1989 to handle the lawsuit against Frost or while the Firm was acting as litigator for the Madison Conservatorship.(1402)
The report further found that Mr. Hubbell's representation of the FDIC was improper in light of Rose's prior representation of Mr. McDougal's S&L:  
<P>The results of our investigation also evidenced conflicting representations on the part of the Rose Law Firm with respect to its representation of FDIC regarding the Madison Conservatorship.  Specifically, we found that the Firm had represented Madison and its wholly owned subsidiary, Madison Financial Corporation, in 1985 and 1986 on various legal matters, including representation of Madison in 1985 before the Arkansas Securities Department (ASD).  During its 1985 representation of Madison the Firm submitted materials to the ASD which were prepared by Frost, the firm that was later sued by Rose on behalf of FDIC for the Madison Conservatorship.  We further found that for many years the Rose Law Firm represented Mr. Hubbell's father-in-law, Seth Ward, or Mr. Ward's companies regarding various legal matters.  However, there was no evidence to show that Mr. Hubbell or the Rose Law Firm disclosed these representations to FDIC when the Firm was hired or during its representation of the Madison Conservatorship in the Frost lawsuit.(1403)

<P>In its review of the FDIC Legal Division's February 17, 1994 Report, the FDIC-IG determined that the Legal Division failed to consider certain conflicts criteria and additional evidence obtained by the IG.(1404) 
<P>The RTC-IG, after a separate investigation, issued its report on August 3, 1995--again days before someone placed the billing records in the Book Room.67   The RTC-IG found that "Rose Law Firm did not disclose actual or potential conflicts relating to Madison and another six of the 17 institutions for which the firm represented FDIC and RTC."(1405)  
<P>Among the "undisclosed" matters identified by the RTC-IG Report related to Rose's involvement in the Castle Grande land deal:
<P>At the time it assisted MADISON GUARANTY with the CASTLE GRANDE deal, ROSE LAW FIRM was aware of regulatory concerns about the soundness of the institution, particularly its net worth, through its representation of MADISON GUARANTY on applications with the ARKANSAS SECURITIES DEPARTMENT to issue preferred stock and to commence broker/dealer operations.  Although FROST & COMPANY's defense called the conduct of MADISON GUARANTY management into question and ROSE LAW FIRM had represented MADISON GUARANTY/MADISON FINANCIAL/SETH WARD in an acquisition of property orchestrated by that management and subsequently heavily criticized by the regulators, ROSE LAW FIRM did not disclose fully its relationship with MADISON GUARANTY in the purchase and development of the IDC property to FDIC or RTC when it was retained in the suit against FROST & COMPANY.(1406)
 
<P>Mr. Adair, Inspector General of the RTC, provided further explanation of the conflicts problem posed by Rose's involvement in Castle Grande in his testimony before the House Banking Committee in August 1995:
<P><P>Arkansas State Regulations had prohibited Madison Guaranty from acquiring a tract of property that became known as Castle Grande, and as an entity the Rose Law Firm was aware of this restriction because it had previously represented Madison Guaranty in other work involving the Arkansas Securities Department.

<P><P>According to a subsequent Home Loan Bank Board examination that was done, to avoid this restriction, Madison Guaranty assigned the right to purchase part of the property to an employee of the institution who was the father-in-law of a Rose partner.

<P><P>Madison Guaranty financed 100 percent of that employee's purchase, providing over $1 million in non-recourse financing and obtained an option from the employee to convey the property back to Madison Guaranty.

<P><P>Essentially, the purchase appears to have been structured to avoid violation of state law by Madison Guaranty.  Madison Guaranty paid the Rose Law Firm for legal services in connection with the transaction.

<P><P>In a report of examination of March 1986, Federal Home Loan Bank Board examiners identified this transaction as one of a series of fictitious transactions causing losses to Madison Guaranty.

<P><P>When Madison Guaranty's independent public accountant was sued by FDIC for its part in the failure of the institution, the accounting firm's defense called the conduct of Madison Guaranty's management into question for several transactions including Castle Grande.

<P><P>Although the Rose Law Firm had earlier assisted Madison Guaranty management in the original Castle Grande transaction, the Rose Law Firm did not disclose its role in that transaction when later retained by the FDIC in the malpractice suit against Madison Guaranty's independent public accountant.(1407)

<P>On December 29, 1995, RTC General Counsel William Collishaw informed the Arkansas Supreme Court Committee on Professional Conduct that the RTC-IG Report "provides a sufficient indication of the existence of possible undisclosed conflicts of interest by the Rose Law Firm such that it raises concerns about the Rose Law Firm's compliance with the Arkansas Rules of Professional Conduct."(1408)  The matter is still pending before the Committee on Professional Conduct.(1409)
<P>Relying primarily on the report of the RTC-IG, the Pillsbury Firm reviewed Rose's representation of the FDIC and the RTC.(1410)  Pillsbury determined that "[b]etween the time the Rose Law Firm was substituted in and the time the Frost case settled, the Rose Law Firm developed an impermissible conflict of interest, which it neither fully disclosed to its client, the RTC, nor had waived."(1411)  Pillsbury concluded that "[a] claim could be asserted against the Rose Law Firm with respect to the conflict of interest."(1412)  Specifically, Pillsbury identified Seth Ward and the Castle Grande transaction as among the factors leading to its conclusion that Rose had a conflict of interest.(1413)
<P>Ms. Black, counsel to the RTC-IG, stressed the significance of the billing records found in the Book Room of the White House to her investigation.  She explained that the records related to the key transactions at issue in the allegations of conflicts of interest:
<P><P>The investigation which we were performing in 1994 and completed in the summer of 1995 was an investigation of actual or potential conflicts that the Rose Law Firm might have had with regard to its work for initially the FDIC and then the RTC.  As a part of that investigation, we looked at the firm's work for Madison Guaranty.  We also looked at the firm's work, if any, for Seth Ward.

<P><P>We looked at various transactions, including Castle Grande, IDC, the Frost litigation, the representation before the Arkansas Security Department and general work that they did for Madison Guaranty.  These records -- the records that were available to us at the time we were doing our investigation were very sparse.  It was very difficult for us to understand what the Rose Law Firm had in fact done.  We had no more than a handful of invoices, five or six.(1414)

Ms. Black stated that the billing records were the best available evidence of the work Rose performed for Madison and that those records were "considerably more detailed than what was available to us before."(1415)  
<P>Ms. Black testified that if the RTC-IG had the billing records during its investigation, "certainly there would have been questions that we asked witnesses that we did not ask.  There would have been lines of inquiry that we would have pursued that we did not pursue.  There might have been witnesses that we would have asked to interview that we did not ask to interview."(1416)
<P>In particular, the Rose billing records increased the RTC-IG's knowledge of Mrs. Clinton's role in Rose's representation of Madison.  When Ms. Black testified before the House Banking Committee in August 1995 about her report, all that she could say was that Mrs. Clinton worked for Madison.  "We don't know what it was.  The bills that were submitted by Rose had the names of attorneys who did the work at the top, and then they had a block discussion of the activities that occurred, and we don't know who did what."(1417)  Ms. Black further testified in 1995 that "[w]e have no evidence that she [Hillary Clinton] worked on Castle Grande."(1418)
<P><P>After the billing records were discovered, Ms. Black testified that the RTC-IG learned, for the first time, of the following relevant matters:
<P>*<P>Mrs. Clinton's role in drafting the May 1, 1986 option agreement between Madison and Seth Ward;

<P>*<P>Mrs. Clinton's telephone conference with Beverly Bassett Schaffer the day before the Rose Law Firm sent a letter to Ms. Schaffer requesting approval of Madison's plan to issue a series of preferred stock;

<P>*<P>Mrs. Clinton's review of a letter discussing the Arkansas banking regulation which limited direct investments by an S&L in an affiliate or subsidiary; and
 
<P>*<P>Mrs. Clinton 15 conferences, either in person or on the telephone, with Seth Ward, the key player in the Castle Grande deal.(1419)

Ms. Black stated that the RTC-IG would have interviewed Mrs. Clinton if it had the billing records during its investigation.(1420)
V.<P>The Special Committee's Investigation into the Circumstances Surrounding the Discovery of the Billing Records.
<P>The FDIC-IG issued its report on the Rose Law Firm's conflicts of interest stemming from its representation of Madison on July 28, 1995.  The RTC-IG issued its report on the same matter on August 3, 1995.  During the two week period following the publication of these reports, Ms. Huber first saw the billing records in the Book Room of the White House Residence, next to Mrs. Clinton's office.
<P>The Special Committee conducted hearings in December 1995 into matters relating to the Rose Law Firm and Mrs. Clinton's representation of Madison.  Specific questions were raised regarding the existence of the billing records.  Mr. Hubbell claimed that he could not provide complete answers about the Mrs. Clinton's representation of Madison because he did not have the billing records to refresh his memory.(1421)  Ms. Thomases similarly testified about her campaign notes relating to billing records reflecting Mrs. Clinton's work for Madison.(1422)  About two weeks later, on January 4, 1996, Ms. Huber examined the records she recovered from the Book Room and realized that they were the missing billing records.(1423)
<P>Because of the importance of the records and the mysterious circumstances of their disappearance and discovery, the Special Committee conducted an exhaustive investigation to identify the person or persons who removed them from the Rose Law Firm in 1992 and who placed them in the Book Room of the White House Residence in August 1995.
<P>The White House produced to the Special Committee records reflecting all persons who entered the White House Residence from July 20 through August 14, 1995.(1424)  The White House provided lists of construction workers who were on the payroll of contractors performing renovations in the White House Residence during this period.(1425)  Finally, the White House produced lists of overnight guests of President and Mrs. Clinton during this period.(1426)
<P>The White House informed the Special Committee that approximately 206 persons had access to the Book Room during the relevant period from July 20 to August 14, 1995, when Ms. Huber testified she found the billing records.(1427)
<P>Of the 206 persons with access to the Bookroom during the relevant period, 28 were White House Residence Staff.(1428)  The Chief Usher, Gary Walters, testified that the Residence staff may not place documents in, or move documents around, the White House Residence without authorization.(1429)  According to Mr. Walters, it is highly unlikely that a member of the Residence staff placed the records in the Book Room.(1430)  Because the White House Residence employees would have had little opportunity to gain access to the billing records and no reason to place them in the Book Room, the Special Committee concluded that no residence employee placed the billing records in the Book Room.
<P>After eliminating the 28 members of the Residence Staff, 178 persons remained.  Of those, approximately 30 construction workers, who were involved in ongoing work in the Book Room or in the adjacent Exercise Room, were given access to the Book Room.  Dennis Freemyer, the Deputy Head Usher in charge of construction projects, testified that the construction workers and outside contractors were all instructed not to touch or move anything in the White House Residence.(1431)  According to Mr. Freemyer: "They are asked not to touch anything.  If they need something moved, they're to ask either the National Park Service or a member of our staff, if they are present."(1432)  All construction workers and outside contractors were escorted by either Secret Service or White House Ushers at all times while they were in the Residence.(1433)  For security reasons, the escorts specifically check at the completion of each day's work to ascertain whether the workers had left anything behind.(1434)  According to Mr. Freemyer, it is highly unlikely that a construction worker or outside contractor placed the records in the Book Room.(1435)  Because the outside contractors had no opportunity to gain access to the billing records or reason for placing them in the Book Room, the Special Committee concluded that no outside contractor placed the records in the Book Room.
<P>After eliminating the construction workers, 148 persons remained, including 55 public officials.(1436)  These public officials included 24 U.S. mayors, President and Mrs. Kim of South Korea, and various Cabinet officials and National Security Staff.(1437)  Given their official positions and their lack of access to the billing records or motive to place them in the Book Room, the Special Committee concluded that none of these individuals placed the Rose Law Firm billing records in the Book Room.
<P>Of the remaining 93 persons who had access to the White House residence during the period from July 20 through August 14, 1995, records of the Secret Service and the White House Usher's Office identified 60 Residence guests.(1438)  The Special Committee sent interrogatories to these guests.  Each guest responded that he or she did not handle the records, have any discussions about the records, or have any knowledge of how they came to appear in the Book Room of the White House Residence.
<P>Apart from the Residence guests, construction workers, and staff, the remaining 33 individuals who had access to the Book Room during the relevant period had a past or present working relationship with the President and the First Lady. Of these 33 persons, the Special Committee received evidence from all except the President and the First Lady.  Ten were sent interrogatories, and the others gave testimony directly to the Special Committee.  All denied having handled the records, having any discussions about the records,68  or having any knowledge about how the records appeared in the Book Room of the White House Residence.
<P>The President and Mrs. Clinton are the only persons on the list of 206 persons having access to the White House Residence from whom the Special Committee has not received evidence.  On June 13, 1996, the Special Committee requested that Mrs. Clinton respond in writing, under oath, about "any knowledge she may have concerning the Rose Law Firm billing records bearing Bates Stamp numbers DKSN028928 through DKSN029043, including whether she has reviewed, handled, or discussed (other than with counsel) these records, and her knowledge relating to the disappearance or discovery of these records."(1439)  
<P>On June 17, 1996, Mrs. Clinton responded: "I do not know how the billing records (DKSN028928 through DKSN029043) came to be identified by Mrs. Huber at the White House on January 4, 1996, although I have read various media accounts."  In light of the Special Committee's request for detailed and specific information relating to any knowledge she had concerning the disappearance or discovery of these records, Mrs. Clinton's answer is incomplete.  For example, she does not state whether she has any knowledge as to how the billing records were removed from the Rose Law Firm; who possessed the billing records between February 1992 and August 1995; where they were stored between February 1992 and August 1995; and, most importantly, who placed them in the Book Room of the White House in August 1995.  There is no mystery as to how Ms. Huber came to identify the records on January 4, 1996.  These other, more important questions, however, remain to be answered.
<P>On June 4, 1996, the FBI informed the Special Committee that the fingerprints of six persons were found on the Rose billing records discovered in the Book Room.(1440)  In addition to fingerprints of Ms. Huber and Marc Rolfe, a Williams & Connolly legal assistant who stamped numbers on the records to prepare them for production,(1441) the FBI also identified the fingerprint of Sandra Hatch, a Rose Law Firm file clerk assigned to Mr. Foster in 1992,(1442) and a palm print of Mildred Alston, Mrs. Clinton's Rose Law Firm secretary and currently Special Assistant for White House Personal Correspondence.(1443)  
<P>Ms. Hatch testified that, as Mr. Foster's file clerk, she was often asked by Mr. Foster or his secretary to photocopy documents and files--which, on occasions, included timesheets and billing records of the size and description similar to those found in the White House Book Room.(1444)  She did not, however, recall a specific instance when Mr. Foster asked her to photocopy or handle such records.(1445)  She did not recall handling, discussing, or overhearing any discussions about records specifically relating to the Rose Law Firm's work for Madison.(1446)  Ms. Hatch testified that although she packed some of Mr. Foster's personal files from the Rose Law Firm for shipment to the White House in January 1993, she did not, see any records resembling the billing records discovered in the Book Room.(1447)  She had no knowledge of how the billing records got to the White House Residence.(1448)  When asked to speculate how her fingerprint got onto the billing records, Ms. Hatch replied, "It's very possible I could have been asked to pick them up.  I don't know.  It would just be a guess."(1449)  
<P>Mildred Alston testified that, although she had been to Mrs. Clinton's office on the third floor of the White House Residence, she had never been to the adjacent Book Room.(1450)  Prior to her appearance before the Grand Jury in 1996, Ms. Alston had never seen the billing records discovered in the Book Room since she came to Washington.(1451)  She did see and handle records resembling those found in the Book Room while she worked at the Rose Law Firm,(1452) and speculated that "I'm sure if the tests indicate that my palm print is wherever on this piece of paper, or on the original of this piece of paper, then I handled them, or touched them or leaned on them" while she was at the Rose Law Firm.(1453)  Ms. Alston testified that, in January 1992, she helped pack Mrs. Clinton's documents and left some of them in the custody of Amy Stewart, a Rose lawyer, to be shipped to the White House.(1454)  Ms. Alston did not know whether the billing records found in the Book Room were among the files shipped to the White House from Mrs. Clinton's officeat the Rose Law Firm.(1455)
<P>The FBI also identified the fingerprints of Mrs. Clinton and Vincent Foster on the billing records.(1456)  Mr. Foster received the billing records in during the 1992 Presidential campaign, and was the last known person to have handled the records.(1457)  Lawyers for the Clintons, both from the White House and from Williams & Connolly, have stated that Mrs. Clinton "may have handled the billing records in 1992."(1458)  What is left unanswered by this statement, however, are the critical questions concerning the mystery of the billing records: when did Mrs. Clinton handle them?  Why did she handle them?  And specifically, what information was she attempting to glean from them?
<P>A close analysis of the billing records, Mr. Foster's notations, and the location of Mrs. Clinton's and Mr. Foster's fingerprints reveal at least some answers to these questions.  The records disclose Mrs. Clinton's role in advising Mr. McDougal's Castle Grande transaction and they indicate Mrs. Clinton's and Mr. Foster's concern over Mrs. Clintons' involvement in the transactions.
<P>Mrs. Clinton left her fingerprints at two places on the billing records.  The FBI identified "[o]ne fingerprint located on the front bottom near the left edge of the page DEK 014950."(1459)  At approximately this location on the page,69  is an entry reflecting that Mrs. Clinton participated in a "teleconference with B. Bassett, Securities Commissioner."(1460)  The entry is underlined in an unidentified hand, but the presence of Mrs. Clinton's fingerprint at this approximate location, and the absence of any other identifiable finger print on the page,(1461) strongly suggest that Mrs. Clinton made the markings.
<P>This entry on the billing records, for upwards of one hour on the day before Rose submitted Madison's novel preferred stock proposal to Ms. Schaffer,(1462) contradicts Mrs. Clinton's response to RTC interrogatories that in May 1995, when she called the Arkansas Securities Department to find out "to whom Mr. Massey should direct any inquiries," she did not recall to whom she spoke.(1463)  Mrs. Clinton's sworn statement is contrary to the testimony of the other two participants in the telephone conference, Ms. Schaffer and Mr. Massey.(1464)  Ms. Schaffer, in particular, testified that she substantively discussed the legality of the preferred stock proposal.(1465)
<P>Mrs. Clinton's fingerprints and the markings on the billing records at this entry indicate that Mrs. Clinton was aware of the nature of her contact with Ms. Schaffer as recently as February 1992, three years before her sworn answer to the RTC interrogatories.  Ms. Schaffer recalled the substance of the conversation from over ten years ago, and it is unclear why Mrs. Clinton provided inaccurate information to the RTC on the conversations about which she had substantive knowledge as recently as 1992.
<P>Mr. Foster's fingerprints on the billing records indicate his attention to Mrs. Clinton's role with respect to the Castle Grande transaction, a "land flip" deal that federal regulators have described as a fraud costing the taxpayers $4 million.(1466)  The transaction was fraudulently structured to evade Arkansas' "direct investment" rule, which limits an S&L's investment in its subsidiaries and service corporations.(1467)
<P>The FBI identified "[o]ne fingerprint on the front lower right corner of page DEK 014969" belonging to Mr. Foster.(1468)  At approximately this location on the page,70  is an entry reflecting that Mr. Massey participated in a conference with Sarah Hawkins, a Madison official, and the Federal Home Loan Bank "regarding brokerage activities and direct investment rule."(1469)  The entire entry is circled, most probably by Mr. Foster, given the presence of his fingerprint proximate to the entry.  The markings suggest that Mr. Foster recognized the significance of the direct investment rule as it related to the activities of Madison.
<P>The importance of Mr. Foster's recognition as it related to Mrs. Clinton's representation of Madison becomes clear with the FBI's identification of "[o]ne fingerprint on the front upper right corner of page DEK 015030" belonging to Mr. Foster.(1470)  At approximately this location on the page71  is an entry reflecting that Mrs. Clinton had a telephone conference with Donald Denton, a Madison official, for approximately 12 minutes on April 7, 1986.(1471)  Someone, apparently Mr. Foster, circled the name of the attorney on the entry: "HRC."(1472)
<P>This telephone call is among the critical events in illuminating the nature of Mrs. Clinton's work in connection with the fraudulent Castle Grande transaction.  The land deal, as noted above, was a sham transaction designed to conceal Madison Guaranty's investment in Castle Grande through its subsidiary, Madison Financial.  Mr. Ward was the "straw man" purchaser in the project--one who lends his name to the title, but does not actually have an ownership interest.(1473)  In order to conceal the commissions owed to Mr. Ward for his services, Madison Guaranty, Madison Financial, and Mr. Ward executed a three promissory notes purporting to evidence loans but, in fact, were a means to pay Mr. Ward for his commissions.  Two of these notes were executed on April 7, 1986.  
<P>That same day, Mr. Denton, Madison's loan officer, received a message from Mrs. Clinton.(1474)  According to Mr. Denton, Mrs. Clinton called seeking copies of the April 7th notes between Mr. Ward and Madison Financial.(1475)  When Mr. Denton cautioned Mrs. Clinton that the April 7th notes from Madison to Mr. Ward may pose a problem because "they constituted in effect a parent entity fulfilling the obligation of a subsidiary,"(1476) Mrs. Clinton "summarily dismissed" Mr. Denton's warning.(1477)  She replied in a manner he took to mean that "he would take care of savings and loan matters, and she would take care of legal matters."(1478)
<P>She indeed took care of matters.  The Rose Law Firm billing records indicate that, three weeks later, on May 1, 1986, Mrs. Clinton prepared an option agreement between Mr. Ward and Madison Financial.(1479)  The word "HRC" in the entry was, as in the April 7th entry, circled apparently by the same hand.(1480)  Based on the new evidence derived from Mr. Denton and the billing records, the federal regulator who examined Madison in 1986 believed that Mrs. Clinton's May 1 option "was created `in order to conceal the connection--whatever it was--between'" the March 31 and April 7 notes.(1481)
<P>On June 13, 1996, the Special Committee requested that the First Lady attempt to refresh her recollection regarding the matters discussed by Mr. Denton and to inform the Committee of what she recalls about them.(1482)  On June 17, 1996 the Special Committee received an affidavit from Mrs. Clinton accompanied by a letter from Mr. Kendall.  In the affidavit, Mrs. Clinton gave no answer to the question posed by the Special Committee; instead, she simply referred to Mr. Kendall's letter "addressing certain allegations recently made by Mr. Don Denton."(1483)  In his letter, Mr. Kendall maintained that Mr. Denton's recollection is "wholly unreliable"72  but gave no indication as to the recollection of the First Lady.(1484)  The First Lady thus has neither confirmed nor denied Mr. Denton's testimony.  
<P>The significance of the billing records as they relate to Castle Grande is perhaps best illustrated by the activities of Mrs. Clinton's legal defense team immediately after the discovery of the records.  A message slip from John Tisdale, the Clintons' Arkansas lawyer to Alston Jennings, Seth Ward's former attorney on Castle Grande, indicate that, on June 5, 1996, the day after Ms. Huber discovered the records in her White House office, Mr. Kendall called Mr. Tisdale and Mr. Jennings to arrange a meeting.(1485)  One week after the records were discovered, on January 11, 1996, Mr. Kendall flew to Little Rock and met first with Mr. Jennings and then with Mr. Ward.(1486)  The meeting with Mr. Ward lasted 30-40 minutes.(1487)  Curiously, Mr. Kendall had also contacted Mr. Jennings in August 1995.  Subsequent to that contact, Mrs. Clinton summoned Mr. Jennings to the White House for a personal meeting on August 10, 1995, around the time that the billing records were placed in the Book Room of the White House residence.
<P>Mrs. Clinton, as the billing partner and lead attorney for Rose on the matter, most likely would have appreciated the importance of the billing records and the information they impart on Castle Grande.  What remains unanswered is how Mr. Foster gained knowledge of the significance of these transaction--sufficient knowledge apparently to highlight the entry on the billing records for Mrs. Clinton's April 7th telephone call with Mr. Denton and for her preparation of the May 1 option.  Given that Mr. Foster's directed his handwritten notes on the billing records to Mrs. Clinton, the most reasonable inference is that Mrs. Clinton shared her recollection of the transactions with Mr. Foster, and the two collaborated in reviewing the billing records some time after February 1992.  If that is so, then the question arises as to why Mrs. Clinton stated to investigators in 1995 that "I do not believe I knew anything about any of these real estate parcels and projects."(1488)
<P>The billing records, and the evidence from Mr. Denton which the entries on the billing records elicited, indicate that Mrs. Clinton either had knowledge of or consciously avoided the fact that the Castle Grande transactions potentially violated bank regulations.  That knowledge provides a powerful motive to protect the billing records from careful scrutiny by investigators.  Because Mrs. Clinton had ordered the destruction of other documents relating to Mrs. Clinton's representation of Madison--including her timesheets and other work files directly relating to Castle Grande--the billing records were the only documentary evidence available which reflected the true extent and nature of Mrs. Clinton's role with respect to the fraudulent scheme.
<P>The evidence strongly suggests that Mr. Foster and Mrs. Clinton, at some time after February 1992, worked together to reconstruct Mrs. Clinton's role in Castle Grande.  The evidence also indicates that Mr. Foster and Mrs. Clinton appreciated the significance of Mrs. Clinton's April 7 telephone call to Mr. Denton and her preparation of the May 1 option, in the words of a federal regulator, "to conceal" the true nature of the transaction.(1489)  Both had a powerful motive to protect the billing records from scrutiny.  Mr. Foster is now deceased.<P>

<P><P><P>-- Notes taken by attorney Lance Miller.


<P>The Special Committee's Arkansas Phase focused on the core allegations of improprieties and criminal misconduct concerning the activities of Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan Association ("Madison Guaranty"), Whitewater Development Corporation ("Whitewater"), Capital Management Services, Inc. ("CMS") and Lasater & Co.  The Arkansas Phase was the last phase of the Committee's inquiry, and, in deference to the Independent Counsel's ongoing investigation, the Committee did not investigate thoroughly certain matters specified in Resolution 120, particularly the lending activities of the Perry County Bank in connection with 1990 Arkansas gubernatorial election.
<P>The convictions of three of the President and Mrs. Clinton's close Arkansas business and political associates in the recently concluded Tucker-McDougal trial in Little Rock marked a key turning point in the ongoing Whitewater affair.  The jury's guilty findings against Governor Jim Guy Tucker and James and Susan McDougal, the Clintons' Whitewater business partners, demonstrate the seriousness of the matters under investigation in the Committee's Arkansas Phase.  Simply put, Whitewater can longer be responsibly dismissed as "a cover-up without a crime."
<P> The Arkansas jury unanimously concluded that James McDougal operated Madison Guaranty as, in effect, a criminal enterprise.  The failure of Madison Guaranty cost American taxpayers more than $60 million.  It is now clear that Madison and CMS, a small business investment company run by David Hale, were piggy banks for the Arkansas political elite.
<P>Eight of the 24 counts of conviction relate directly to the Clintons' investment in Whitewater.  The jury convicted on all of the counts concerning a loan from CMS to Susan McDougal's firm, Master Marketing.  According to the testimony of an FBI agent at the Tucker-McDougal trial, approximately $50,000 of the loan was used to pay the expenses of Whitewater.  Moreover, Mr. Hale testified at the trial that he discussed this fraudulent loan with then-Governor Clinton.  Unfortunately, the Committee never heard the important testimony of Mr. Hale, who asserted his constitutional right not to testify.  The Committee was unable to secure sufficient votes to grant Mr. Hale limited use immunity.
<P>The recently-discovered Rose Law Firm billing records provide important new evidence relating to the Arkansas Phase.  The records reveal Mrs. Clinton's previously undisclosed personal representation of Mr. McDougal's S&L before state regulators, seeking permission to raise additional money through the sale of stock.  The records also show that Mrs. Clinton was repeatedly called on to do work related to the Madison land deal, known as Castle Grande, which federal S&L regulators found involved a series of fraudulent transactions.  The Special Committee concludes that Mrs. Clinton's work on Castle Grande related to an effort to conceal the true nature of activities at Madison Guaranty.
<P>The Special Committee also uncovered evidence that Mr. Clinton himself took an active role in obtaining one of the original Whitewater loans -- one apparently approved as a favor after the bank's political lobbyist intervened.  And Mr. Clinton's accountant testified that when he raised objections to early parts of Mr. McDougal's Whitewater proposal, Mr. Clinton pulled him aside and told him to "back off."
<P>During the 1980s, Mr. McDougal and his allies obtained favorable results from their dealings with the Arkansas state government under Governor Clinton.  At a time when Mr. McDougal was carrying the Clintons on their Whitewater loans, Mr. McDougal had a say in the making of state appointments, enjoyed personal access to the Governor and won valuable state leases for Madison.  The Special Committee concludes that Governor Clinton's official and personal dealings with Mr. McDougal raised an apparent, if not an actual, improper conflict of interest. 
<P>Finally, the Clinton were not "passive" investors in the Whitewater real estate venture, as they have claimed.  Indeed, the Clintons participated in important meetings concerning the Whitewater investment.  The Special Committee concludes that the Clintons took an active role in obtaining and extending Whitewater-related loans.<P><P> 
<P>*   *   *
1.<P>Mrs. Clinton's legal work on Castle Grande related to an effort to conceal the true nature of the activities at Madison Guaranty.

<P>The Castle Grande land development consisted of more than 1,000 acres of property near Little Rock purchased by Seth Ward, Webster Hubbell's father-in-law, and Madison Financial Corp. ("MFC") -- Madison Guaranty's wholly-owned subsidiary.7  The land was sold in a series of transactions that caused nearly $4 million in losses to Madison Guaranty -- losses ultimately borne by U.S. taxpayers.8
<P>Federal regulators have determined that Seth Ward acted as a "straw" man in the fraudulent Castle Grande transaction who simply held property in his name until MFC could find a buyer.9  In this way, Madison Guaranty was able to circumvent an Arkansas regulation that limited investment in real estate by a savings and loan.10  For his part in this sham deal, Mr. Ward earned over $300,000 in commissions on the sale of property.11 
<P>Prior to the discovery of the Rose Law Firm billing records in the White House Residence, the nature and extent of Mrs. Clinton's work on Castle Grande was virtually unknown.  The evidence obtained in the course of the Special Committee's investigation now establishes that Mrs. Clinton had direct and substantial involvement in Castle Grande.
<P>The Rose billing records reflect that on April 7, 1986, Mrs. Clinton had a telephone conference with Madison Guaranty's chief loan officer, Don Denton.12  The records also reflect that on May 1, 1986, Mrs. Clinton prepared an option agreement under which MFC obtained the right to buy from Mr. Ward a small piece of property called Holman Acres for $400,000.13    
<P>The background to the questionable transaction is as follows.  In spring 1986, Mr. Ward approached John Latham, the President of Madison Guaranty, about collecting his commissions from the sham sales of real estate at Castle Grande.  At the time, however, Madison Guaranty had come under scrutiny from federal banking regulators, who were examining the thrift and would have questioned the payment of such commissions.14
<P>Therefore, Seth Ward, Madison Guaranty, and Madison Financial executed a series of crossing loan transactions and promissory notes designed to pay Mr. Ward his commissions and fool the S&L's regulators.  On March 31, 1986, Madison Guaranty loaned $400,000 to Mr. Ward.15  On April 7, 1986, MFC gave two promissory notes to Mr. Ward -- one for $300,000 and the other for $70,943.16  Thus, Mr. Ward received his commissions from the $400,000 loan from Madison Guaranty, and MFC's notes effectively canceled his obligation to repay the loan and was the means by which he was able to keep his commissions. 
<P>The chief federal S&L examiner, James Clark, discovered the March 31 loan and April 7 notes during a 1986 the examination and became concerned that there might be a connection between the crossing notes.17  Specifically, he suspected that the notes might represent a payment to Mr. Ward and thus a possibly improper investment by Madison Guaranty in MFC.18  Such investments by Madison Guaranty in its service corporation, MFC, were subject to a regulation limiting Madison's ability to invest in real estate.  
<P>When Mr. Clark inquired about the March 31 and April 7 notes, however, he was told that these notes were completely unrelated.19  He was told that the April 7 notes were related to MFC's plan to purchase Holman Acres from Mr. Ward.  This transaction was to be accomplished through an as yet undrafted option agreement that would replace the notes, which existed simply to guarantee MFC's performance.20  In effect, the option agreement was a fictitious transaction designed to conceal the relationship between the March 31 loan and the April 7 notes.
<P>According to Mr. Clark, the May 1, 1986 option prepared by Mrs. Clinton was used to disguise the fact that the crossing notes between Seth Ward, MFC, and Madison Guaranty were devised to pay commissions to Mr. Ward.  In Mr. Clark's view, "the option was created 'in order to conceal the connection'" between the notes.21
<P>On April 7, 1986, Don Denton received a message that Mrs. Clinton had called.22  He returned the call and they discussed about the notes between Mr. Ward, MFC, and Madison Guaranty.23  Mr. Denton believed that Mrs. Clinton was preparing a $400,000 note between MFC and Mr. Ward, and he told her that such a note had already been prepared and executed.24  Mrs. Clinton asked him to send her whatever notes the S&L had executed with Mr. Ward.25  Mr. Denton did so, sending copies to Mrs. Clinton of the notes by courier.26
<P>Mr. Denton recalled that during this April 7 conversation he expressed concern to Mrs. Clinton with respect to the March 31 and April 1 notes because the note appeared to represent the payment by Madison Guaranty of an MFC obligation.27  Mrs. Clinton, however, "summarily dismissed" that Mr. Denton's concern in a manner that Mr. Denton took to mean that he ought to "take care of savings and loan matters, and she would take care of legal matters." 28
<P>In sum, the Special Committee concludes that Mrs. Clinton's own work product -- the May 1 option -- was used to conceal the very transactions about which Mr. Denton expressed concern.  This fact raises serious questions with respect to Mrs. Clinton's state of knowledge of the deceptive aspects of the transaction.  
<P>First, the billing records indicates that Mrs. Clinton was aware of the Arkansas regulation limiting the extent of Madison's investment in MFC.  Indeed, the records reflect that on June 17, 1985, she reviewed a memorandum prepared by a Rose associate, Richard Massey, touching upon this regulation.  More important, her conversation with Don Denton put her on notice -- prior to the drafting of the critical May 1 option -- that the notes exchanged by Mr. Ward, MFC, and Madison Guaranty were questionable.  Thus, it appears that Mrs. Clinton was apprised of both the relevant law and facts that made the Castle Grande transaction irregular.  Accordingly, an inference can be drawn that Mrs. Clinton might well have known that these documents were designed to conceal the true nature of the Madison-Ward transactions or that she consciously avoided the knowledge.  At the very least, she was on notice to inquire further. 
<P>On June 13, 1996, the same day that the Special Committee received Mr. Denton's testimony, the Committee in a letter addressed to Mr. Kendall, Mrs. Clinton's counsel, requested that the First Lady attempt to refresh her recollection regarding the matters discussed by Mr. Denton and inform the Committee of what she recalls about them.29  The Special Committee's request was made in response to an earlier offer by Mrs. Clinton through a White House spokesman to answer in writing questions regarding the subject of the Special Committee's work.
<P>On June 17, 1996 the Special Committee received an affidavit from Mrs. Clinton accompanied by a letter from Mr. Kendall.  In the affidavit, Mrs. Clinton gave no indication as to her recollection regarding the subject matter of Mr. Denton's testimony.  Instead, she simply requested that Special Committee refer to Mr. Kendall's letter "addressing certain allegations recently made by Mr. Don Denton."30  In his letter, Mr. Kendall maintained that Mr. Denton's recollection is "wholly unreliable" but gave no indication as to the recollection of the First Lady.31  In sum, the First Lady has neither confirmed nor denied Mr. Denton's testimony.
<P>Examination of Mrs. Clinton's involvement in Castle Grande cannot be viewed in isolation.  The Special Committee also takes into account Mrs. Clinton's apparent failure to be more forthcoming about her role in Mr. McDougal's Castle Grande deal.  When asked in 1995 about her knowledge of Castle Grande and some other land deals, Mrs. Clinton swore, under oath, "I do not believe I knew anything about any of these real estate parcels and projects."32  In light of the billing records, that statement appears incorrect on its face.
<P>The Rose billing records reflect that Mrs. Clinton billed almost 30 hours to Castle Grande matters during the course of her representation of Madison Guaranty -- more time than any other Rose attorney.33  And, in addition to the May 1 option and the phone call with Mr. Denton, Mrs. Clinton had 15 face-to-face or telephone conferences with Seth Ward, including one "regarding purchase from Brick Lile," the chairman of the company that sold the property to Mr. Ward and MFC.34
<P>In a sworn statement in 1996, Mrs. Clinton sought to explain her prior categorical denial of knowledge about Castle Grande by saying that she knew of the 1,000+ acre tract as "IDC" -- the name of the company that sold the property and the matter to which she charged her billings.  She further stated that she knew a small portion of the Castle Grande property, a trailer part, as Castle Grande Estates.35  The Committee finds it implausible that Mrs. Clinton would fail to recognize the name "Castle Grande" as the referring to the larger development, given the testimony of Madison Guaranty insiders and federal regulators that the entire development was commonly known as Castle Grande.36 
<P>The secreting of the Rose Law Firm billing records could have been motivated by a desire to conceal Mrs. Clinton's involvement in Castle Grande and, in particular, her involvement in work on the questionable April 7 notes and May 1 option, could have motivated the secreting of the Rose Law Firm billing records.  The jury in the recently concluded Tucker-McDougal trial convicted the defendants for crimes relating to the Castle Grande project.  Prior to the discovery of the Rose billing records, Mrs. Clinton's role in Castle Grande was unknown.  The desire to keep her role secret might have been the cause of the long absence of the billing records.
2.<P>Webster Hubbell was significantly more involved in Castle Grande than he admitted in his Senate testimony.

<P>Former Associate Attorney General and former Rose Law Firm partner Webster Hubbell has testified before the Special Committee and in other fora on several occasions.  With respect to his testimony regarding his involvement in Castle Grande, Mr. Hubbell altered his story when he learned that Seth Ward was a nominee purchaser for MFC.  In a December 1995 with the RTC, Mr. Hubbell stated that he understood as of September 1985, from Mr. Ward, that "Madison had limits on what it could own in its own name, and so Mr. Ward was going to own part of it until it could be sold."37
<P>And, in an interview with the RTC Office of Inspector General, Mr. Hubbell "said that Ward told him that he was negotiating on behalf of Madison to buy the IDC property, which would then be split up between Madison and Ward."38  In testimony before the Special Committee, however, Mr. Hubbell repeatedly testified that he was not aware of the deal between Madison and Ward until after the closing in early October 1985.39
<P>Mr. Hubbell was reluctant to answer questions regarding his own view of the legality of his father-in-law's role in the purchase of the IDC property.  When asked if Mr. McDougal used Mr. Ward to evade a regulatory restriction, Mr. Hubbell answered, "I have never represented an S&L.  I don't know whether it's illegal or not."40  When he was asked if he considered this transaction as a classic parking or warehousing transaction, Mr. Hubbell answered, "I think of parking and warehousing a little bit differently."41  When asked if he thought Mr. Ward could be considered a "straw man," Mr. Hubbell testified, "I didn't give it any consideration, you know.  'Straw man' means, to me, somebody who you clear title through."42
<P>Mr. Hubbell has denied advising Mr. Ward on the Castle Grande transaction.43  Specifically, he denied preparing a backdated September 24, 1985 letter or advising Mr. Ward on its preparation.44  There is evidence, however, that Mr. Hubbell may have prepared the backdated September 24, 1985 letter, which was found in his files at the Rose Law Firm.45  Martha Patton, Mr. Hubbell's secretary at Rose, has stated that although she does not recall typing the letter she believes that she did because the type is similar to that of the IBM typewriter that she used then, and the second page of the document is formatted in the style she used while a Rose secretary.46  She added that the letter appears to be "her style of typing."47<P>  
<P>There is also some indication that Mr. Hubbell was supposed to prepare the May 1, 1986 option agreement.  Handwritten notes taken by James Clark, the chief FHLBB examiner during the 1986 examination of Madison Guaranty, reflect the following:
<P>MFC Commitment to buy land at corner of Route 145 . . .
<P>Option will be prepared,  atty out of town (Hubbell)
<P>to replace note.48

This note strongly suggests a previously unknown involvement in Castle Grande by Mr. Hubbell.
<P>Former Madison chief loan officer Don Denton has indicated that Mr. Hubbell advised Mr. Ward on the Castle Grande matter.498
  For example, Mr. Denton believed that the wording on the note, dated October 15, 1985, stating that Mr. Ward was not personally responsible for the note was prepared by Mr. Hubbell.50  Also, Mr. Denton believed that he had some conversations with Mr. Hubbell about the February 28, 1996 transaction.51
<P>Furthermore, Mr. Denton indicated in a recent interview that Mr. Hubbell was involved in the March 31 and April 7, 1986 notes between Mr. Ward, Madison Guaranty, and Madison Financial.  He stated that he was "reasonably confident" that when Mrs. Clinton called him regarding these notes she was acting on Mr. Hubbell's behalf.52  Mr. Denton refused to say whether he ever dealt with Mr. Hubbell on the matter of the notes.53  He also declined to answer whether he had visited Mr. Hubbell's office at Rose regarding Mr. Ward or Madison Guaranty.54
<P>Mr. Hubbell may have provided inaccurate statements about his legal work on other occasions.  In 1989 when the Rose Law Firm was retained to represent the FDIC in an action against Madison Guaranty's former accountants,55 Mr. Hubbell failed to disclose to regulators Rose's prior work for Madison.  And in 1993 when he failed to disclose information he had learned the previous year from reading the Rose Law Firm billing records to FDIC investigators looking into the 1989 retention of Rose.56<P>  The Special Committee questions Mr. Hubbell's implausible claim that he did not advise Mr. Ward with respect to Castle Grande.
3.<P>In 1985, Mr. McDougal retained Hillary Clinton to represent Madison Guaranty; the work was not brought in by a young associate.
<P>The Special Committee concludes, based upon the substantial weight of the evidence, that Mr. McDougal hired Mrs. Clinton to represent Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan.  Mrs. Clinton's statements that Richard Massey, then a young Rose Law Firm associate at the time, brought the client into the firm are not supported by the documentary or testimonial evidence received by the Committee. 
<P>Mr. McDougal made statements during the 1992 Clinton presidential campaign, as well as to the Los Angeles Times in 1993, that he put Mrs. Clinton on retainer as a favor to Bill Clinton.  These McDougal statements are supported by others and by documentary evidence.  Former Madison CEO John Latham confirmed that Mr. McDougal made the decision to retain the Rose Law Firm.57  Moreover, although President Clinton does not recall asking Mr. McDougal to place Mrs. Clinton on retainer,58 Mr. McDougal performed other favors for President Clinton when he was Governor by, among other things, substantial contributions, on behalf of the Clintons, on Whitewater loans. 
<P> Mrs. Clinton's markedly different account of how the business came to the Rose Law Firm, is not confirmed by any attorney at the  Rose Law Firm, including Mr. Massey.   For example, Mrs. Clinton, has repeatedly stated that Mr. Massey, then a first year associate at the Rose Law Firm, brought in Madison Guaranty as a client.59  She claims that Mr. Latham asked Mr. Massey whether he would be interested in representing Madison in connection with a proposed stock offering.  Mrs. Clinton further explained that Mr. Massey was aware that she knew Mr. McDougal, so "he came to me and asked if I would talk with Jim to see whether or not Jim would let the lawyer and the officer go forward on this project.  I did that, and I arranged that the firm would be paid $2,000 retainer."60  
<P>Both Mr. Massey and Mr. Latham contradict Mrs. Clinton's version of events. Moreover, David Knight61, a former partner of the Rose Law Firm, testified that he was involved in this meeting between Mr. Latham and Mr. Massey, and Mr. Latham did not hire Mr. Massey.62
<P>In a statement to the FDIC OIG in November 1994, Mrs. Clinton similarly told investigators that "she recalled Massey came to her and asked her to be the billing attorney which was a normal practice when an associate was handling the matter. . . Mrs. Clinton recalled that a Madison official (individual unknown) approached Rick Massey regarding a preferred stock offering in an effort to raise capital."63  In a sworn response to an RTC interrogatory in May 1995, Mrs. Clinton elaborated on her story.  Mrs. Clinton stated that Mr. Massey approached her because "certain lawyers" in the Rose Law Firm were "opposed" to representing Mr. McDougal until Mr. McDougal paid an outstanding bill, and he was aware that Mrs. Clinton knew Mr. McDougal.  
<P>Mr. Massey, however, directly contradicted Mrs. Clinton's account stating that he was not responsible for bringing in Madison as a client.64  Specifically, Mr. Massey testified that Mr. Latham never offered him Madison's business65 and that he did not recall approaching Mrs. Clinton with a proposal to represent Madison.66  Contrary to Mrs. Clinton's unsworn statement of November 1994 to the RTC, Mr. Massey also testified that he did not ask Mrs. Clinton to be the billing attorney.67  Mr. Knight agrees that Mr. Massey did not secure an offer of business, and he -- Mr. Knight -- further testified that he would have expected to know about such an offer if it had happened.
<P>Mrs. Clinton claimed that she became involved in discussions about the Madison retainer because of an outstanding debt Mr. McDougal, through his Madison Bank & Trust, owed to the Rose Law Firm in 1985.    
<P>Documentary evidence and testimony provided to the Special Committee, however, indicated that the outstanding balance of Rose's bill to Madison Bank & Trust was paid in November 1984, months prior to Rose's retainer in April 1985.  Furthermore, Gary Bunch, President of Madison Bank & Trust provided the Special Committee with documents showing that the legal fees owed to the Rose Law Firm were paid in late October 1984.68  Mr. Bunch further testified that Mr. McDougal directed him in October 1984 to pay the outstanding Rose Law Firm bill for the Madison Bank & Trust matter in full.69
<P>Following the discovery of the Rose billing records and the testimony of Mr. Massey before the Special Committee, Mrs. Clinton's story changed in a February 1996 interview with RTC investigators.  She claimed, for the first time, that the late Vincent Foster initially informed her that Mr. Massey wanted to do legal work for Madison.70  
<P>Mrs. Clinton's statements conflict internally and with the testimony of others involved in the events surrounding Rose's Madison retainer.  Over the next several months, it was Mrs. Clinton -- not Mr. Massey -- that officials at Madison Guaranty, including Seth Ward and Jim McDougal, sought out for representation.  Finally, Mr. Massey, Mr. Knight, Mr. Latham and Mr. Bunch, all unrelated and with no apparent reason to mislead the Special Committee, contradict Mrs. Clinton's assertion that she did not bring Madison Guaranty to the Rose Law Firm as a client. 
4.<P>  Mrs. Clinton had a substantive contact with Beverly Bassett Schaffer about Madison Guaranty's proposal to issue preferred stock.

<P>The Rose billing records and Beverly Bassett Schaffer contradict Mrs. Clinton's statements that she did not speak directly to Beverly Bassett Schaffer, the Arkansas Securities Commissioner in charge of state regulation of Madison Guaranty, about Madison Guaranty's proposed preferred stock transaction.  
<P>Prior to the discovery of the billing records, Mrs. Clinton claimed in her sworn responses to RTC interrogatories in May 1995 that she called the Arkansas Securities Department to find out "to whom Mr. Massey should direct any inquiries" on the proposed stock deal, but she did not recall to whom she spoke.71
<P>The Rose billing records reflect that Mrs. Clinton called Ms. Schaffer the day before the Rose Law Firm submitted Madison's proposal to do preferred stock offering to the Arkansas Securities Department.72  In testimony before the Special Committee, Ms. Schaffer directly contradicted Mrs. Clinton and stated that the substance of the proposal was discussed during the phone call, and that Ms. Schaffer told Mrs. Clinton that her agency would approve the proposal.73 
<P>Mr. Massey likewise contradicted Mrs. Clinton's account of this important telephone call.  Mr. Massey testified that he drafted the proposal and knew exactly to whom the proposal should be sent.74  Mr. Massey also testified that Mrs. Clinton never gave any instructions to him about whom he should address the transmission letter.75
<P>This conversation has at least the appearance of an attempt by the then-Governor's wife to lobby to influence the activities of state regulators on behalf of private clients.  Thus, both Ms. Schaffer and Mrs. Clinton may have motive to hide this event from public scrutiny.  The fact that Ms. Schaffer recalls that the phone call included a discussion of the substance of Madison Guaranty's stock proposal, which she approved two weeks later, supports the Special Committee's conclusion that a substantive call occurred.  
5.<P>  Governor Clinton's official and personal dealings with James McDougal raised an apparent, if not an actual, improper conflict of interest.<P>   
<P>Governor Clinton's official and personal dealings with Jim McDougal, beyond appearances, raised an apparent, if not actual, conflict of interest.  Although Mr. McDougal was carrying the Clintons on the Whitewater loans, then Governor Clinton -- using the power of his high political office -- consistently acted favorably on Mr. McDougal's other business ventures and accepted many of the recommendations Mr. McDougal made regarding proposed state action.  These favors took the form of influence in appointments76, the awarding of lucrative state leases77, and beneficial decisions relating to state regulators.78  This favoritism was critical to Mr. McDougal, whose savings & loan was experiencing serious financial trouble. 
<P>Of course, from the standpoint of Governor Clinton, if Madison Guaranty failed or Mr. McDougal experienced financial troubles, the Clintons could be liable for the full Whitewater debt.  Thus, Governor Clinton had reason to act in a way to ensure the viability of Mr. McDougal's savings & loan, even if such action was adverse to the interests of the state.  For example, documents indicate that Governor Clinton played a role in the award of contracts for state leases to Madison.79 
<P>Perhaps the most blatant example of the problems created by this conflict of interest related to certain legislation.  In 1987, Governor Clinton vetoed a water bill that favored a utility, Castle Sewer & Water, owned by R.D. Randolph and Jim Guy Tucker, two business associates of Mr. McDougal.80  Mr. Randolph and Mr. Tucker threatened Governor Clinton by reminding him of a questionable 1985 Madison fundraiser,81 and the possibility of litigation related to Rose's representation of Madison on the utility issue.82  Shortly thereafter, Governor Clinton called the legislature into a special session and the signed the bill, as Mr. McDougal's associates desired.   
6.<P>The Clintons took an active role in obtaining and extending Whitewater-related loans; they were not "passive" investors in Whitewater.
<P>
<P>The Clintons were not "passive investors" in the Whitewater real estate venture.  Indeed, they actively sought and obtained Whitewater loans and extensions.  Based largely on Mr. Clinton's official position, state bankers routinely gave the Clintons beneficial treatment on Whitewater-related loans, often disregarding banking regulations and sound lending practices. 
<P>Whitewater was a "no cash" deal.  Mr. Clinton actively participated in obtaining the initial down payment loan the Whitewater investment.  He enlisted bank lobbyist Paul Berry to grant him and James McDougal an unsecured loan for the down payment.83  This loan was just one of the Whitewater loans that would not have been made under what the lending officer characterized as "ordinary circumstances."84<P>  
<P>Moreover, the Clintons actively participated in key meetings concerning the Whitewater real estate investment.  At the outset of the investment, Mr. Clinton met with Mr. McDougal about the structure of the financing.85  When Mr. Clinton's personal accountant, Gaines Norton, raised serious questions about the lawfulness of Mr. McDougal's plans, Mr. Clinton told him to "back off."86  This indicates a conscious avoidance of learning the facts about the Whitewater transactions.
<P>Also early in the investment, Mrs. Clinton had at least two meetings with bank officials to renew Whitewater loans.87  Although few payments of principal were being made, and the Clintons often refused to provide the required loan documents and financial statements, Mrs. Clinton's continued meetings and conversations with reluctant bank officials helped to secure the extension of Whitewater loans.88  Again and again, bankers looked the other way when the Clintons failed to make principal payments on the Whitewater loan or failed to submit the required financial statements, many times due to Governor Clinton's public office.89  Finally, after 1986, Mrs. Clinton essentially took control of the Whitewater investment.90  Mrs. Clinton sought power of attorney over the investment, paid back taxes and attempted to collect all the Whitewater documents.<P> 
<P>In fact, it appears that in many instances where the Clintons got involved with the Whitewater loans, the banking regulations were either "bent" or broken.  For example, federal and state regulators cited Mrs. Clinton's irregular out of territory and often past due loan in connection with Whitewater Lot 13 and prohibited the bank from renewing the loan.91  Governor Clinton's Bank Commissioner Marlin Jackson may have assisted the Clintons in obtaining a new loan at a bank he then regulated.92  Later, Mr. Jackson improperly used government stationary in connection with securing loan renewals for the Clintons.93  Mr. Jackson used his government position to act as a go-between for the Clintons in their dealings with a state-regulated bank was clearly inappropriate.94  This action raises serious questions of whether Mr. Jackson misused his official position to influence improperly bank action to benefit the wholly private interests of the Clintons.<P> 
7.<P>Governor Clinton's office steered state bond work to Dan Lasater. 

<P>The Special Committee was very concerned about Governor Clinton's troubling relationship with Arkansas businessman, Dan Lasater.  In 1980, Mr. Lasater entered the securities business with the firm of Collins, Locke & Lasater.  In January 1985, a Little Rock paper reported that a federal bankruptcy judge found, in open court, that Mr. Lasater lied under oath during the bankruptcy trial of his former business partner, George Locke, and also found that Mr. Lasater was involved in a conspiracy to defraud Mr. Locke's creditors.  In February 1985, widely-reported accounts of sworn testimony of federal court put Governor Clinton on notice that Mr. Lasater was a cocaine user and the subject of a drug investigation.  On October 23, 1986, Mr. Lasater was indicted on drug charges for possession and distribution of cocaine.
<P>Mr. Lasater contributed substantial sums of money to Governor Clinton,95 "loaned" $8,000 to the Governor's brother, Roger, to pay a drug debt,96 and, at the Governor's request, gave Roger a job.97
<P>The Special Committee identified three instances in which Governor Clinton or his aides inappropriately sought to take actions to intended to benefit Mr. Lasater.  First, in February 1983, Senior Economic Adviser to the Governor, Bob Nash, while acting in his official capacity, improperly directed Charles Stout, the Chairman of the Arkansas Housing Development Board ("AHDA"), to grant lucrative state bond underwriting contracts to Mr. Lasater's firm, Collins, Locke & Lasater.98  Mr. Nash directed AHDA Chairman Stout to award 15% of AHDA's bond-business to Mr. Lasater's firm.  This order represented an unprecedented interference by the Governor's office into the otherwise independent and competitive underwriting selection process of the agency99.  Mr. Nash did not suggest that the AHDA should include other Arkansas firms.  Rather, Mr. Nash's order specifically directed that Mr. Lasater's firm be included.  Mr. Nash's directive had the weight and influence of the Governor's office behind it,100 and, as a result, the AHDA Board bowed to the Governor's order awarded a substantial amount of state bond business to Mr. Lasater's firm.101  Prior to Mr. Stout's order, Mr. Lasater's firm had not received AHDA bond business.  In addition, the Stephens firm, the largest bond firm in Little Rock, questioned whether Mr. Lasater's firm was qualified to participate in these offerings.
<P>Second, in late 1983, Governor Clinton sought to use the power of his office to benefit Mr. Lasater when the Governor  personally called and asked Linda Garner, the State Insurance Commissioner, to include Collins, Locke and Lasater as a manager for the multi-billion dollar securities portfolio for which she was acting as receiver in connection with her responsibilities as Insurance Commissioner.102  Governor Clinton did not attempt to intervene on behalf of any other financial firms.103  The Committee has concluded that this contact represents another instance where Governor Clinton inappropriately tried to influence an appointed state official to direct business opportunities to Mr. Lasater.
<P>Third, the Governor's office extended itself to monitor and to facilitate Mr. Lasater's company's efforts to secure the underwriting contract for a $29 million dollar bond financing for a police radio system in 1985.104
<P>In each of these three instances, the Special Committee concludes that Mr. Lasater received inappropriate assistance from the Governor and his office.  Given Mr. Lasater's past problems, it is far from clear why Mr. Lasater would be entitled to preferential treatment.  
8.<P>The Clintons took a series of erroneous tax deductions related to Whitewater.

<P>The Special Committee concludes that the Clintons took a series of erroneous Whitewater deductions, often in error, on their personal federal income tax returns.  From 1978 to the early 1990s, the Clintons invested a total of $42,192 in Whitewater.105  During this same period, the Clintons deducted $42,656 of their Whitewater related expenses on their federal income tax returns -- almost $500 more than their total investment in the corporation.  From 1992 to this date, the Clintons have admitted taking improper deductions of $7,928 and omitting income of $8,171 on their federal income tax returns during the period of their Whitewater investment.  Based on its analysis of the available evidence, the Special Committee concludes that the Clintons could have understated their income on Whitewater-related items by as much as an additional $33,771, for a total increase in taxable income of $49,870.

<H2>SUMMARY OF THE EVIDENCE</H2>
PART I:  WHITEWATER DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION
<P>While running Senator Fulbright's election campaign in 1968, Jim McDougal was introduced to William Jefferson Clinton who, at the time, was a young student at Georgetown University and was working for Senator Fulbright on the staff of the Foreign Relations Committee.106  Several years later, in 1973, after Clinton had graduated from Yale Law School, he returned to Arkansas and took a university teaching position.107  In 1974, Mr. Clinton ran unsuccessfully for a congressional seat in Arkansas and, in 1976 he ran for, and won, the office of  Attorney General for Arkansas.108  During the campaign for Attorney General, Mr. Clinton re-established his relationship with Mr. McDougal, who was then a professor at Ouachita Baptist University.    
<P>During 1977, Mr. Clinton entered into his first real estate investment with Mr. McDougal.  This was a profitable investment.  Specifically, on January 25, 1977, Mr. Clinton purchased 20 acres of land from Rolling Manor, Inc., a company owned and controlled by Mr. McDougal for a price of $11,400.  In 1978, Mr. Clinton sold that land for $19,985, netting a profit of $ 8,585 in just over one year--a 75% return on his initial investment.109  This transaction convinced Mr. Clinton that investing with Mr. McDougal could bring quick profits.  At the time, Mr. Clinton, in the midst of his campaign for Attorney General, was still paying off educational loans and debt he had acquired in his congressional election loss.  Shortly afterward, Mr. Clinton was elected Attorney General.110
<P>  Near the end of Mr. Clinton's term as Attorney General, in 1978, the Clintons, impressed by their profit from Mr. Clinton's first investment with Mr. McDougal, joined Mr. McDougal in the Whitewater investment.  Mr. Clinton and Mr. McDougal borrowed $20,000 and used the money as a down payment on the purchase of 230 acres of land along the White River.111  The rest of the $203,000 purchase price was financed by another loan taken out by the Clintons and the McDougals.112  At the time of the origination of the loans, the McDougals' financial statements showed a net worth of $551,000, with total assets of $975,000.113  The Clintons, on the other hand, did not submit a financial statement, but their tax return for 1978 indicates earned income of $54,593.114
<P>The following year, on June 18, 1979, the McDougals and Clintons incorporated Whitewater Development Corporation and transferred the land that they had purchased along the White River to this company, subject to the mortgages.115  Stock in Whitewater was to be evenly distributed between the Clintons and the McDougals, but because of conflicting documentation it is difficult to determine the exact distribution of ownership.116  One thing that is certain, however, is that the Clintons and the McDougals believed they would share equally in any profits.117 
<P>Sales at the Whitewater real estate project did not meet the Clintons' and the McDougals' expectations.  Not only was there no profit, but from the early days onward, the investment did not take in enough money to service the debt.  As a result, the Clintons were forced to attend several meetings with bank officials in order to extend the loans.
<P>Between June 1979 and October 1985, the Clintons signed at least 10 renewals on various Whitewater loans at Union National Bank, Citizens Bank of Flippin, and Security Bank.  On December 16, 1980, Mrs. Clinton took out a $30,000 loan from Mr. McDougal's Madison Bank and Trust to finance the purchase of a model home for Whitewater lot 13.  It was hoped that the model home would spur lot sales.
<P>The Clintons did not put any funds into Whitewater Corporation during the period that Mr. McDougal was running Madison Guaranty.  Instead, the Clintons allowed Mr. McDougal to make the payments.  Mr. McDougal made substantial payments.  He often used funds from Madison Guaranty to service the Whitewater debt.  Whitewater did not generate sufficient cash flow because of lagging lot sales.  Thus, if Mr. McDougal was unable to cover the debt personally, the Clintons' would have been liable for the total amount of the mortgage if the bank refused to renew the notes.  Thus, the Clintons had an interest in the economic well-being of the McDougals.<P>
<P>Since questions surrounding the Clintons' investment in Whitewater first arose, the Clintons have stated they were "passive investors" in this investment.118  In May 1995, in a sworn response to interrogatories propounded by the RTC, Mrs. Clinton testified that the Clintons "the McDougals exercised control over the management and operation of WDC for the period of its existence. . . .As was contemplated from the inception of the venture, we were passive investors and relied upon the McDougals to manage and operate it."119  (emphasis added).  
<P>Since the 1992 campaign, the Clintons have continued to attempt to distance themselves from Mr. McDougal.  The Clintons have repeatedly maintained that they were passive investors in Whitewater.  Similarly, Mrs. Clinton sought to minimize the extent of her involvement in the representation of Madison Guaranty while a partner of the Rose Law Firm.   
I.<P>Whitewater: The Early Years 
<P>A.<P>The Clinton's Previously Undisclosed Land Deal with James McDougal

<P>In 1977, President Clinton made his first real estate investment with Mr. McDougal.  The Clintons' 1978 federal income tax return reported two real estate sales: a cash sale of a five-acre parcel of land purchased by the Clintons on January 25, 1977, and an installment sale of 15 acres of land also purchased that same day.120  
<P>President Clinton testified, however, that while he had no recollection of the particular investment, he recalled that he was involved in a five-acre land deal with Mr. McDougal that was sold for $5000 and resulted in a capital gain of $2150. In his May 24, 1995 sworn interrogatory responses to the RTC, President Clinton stated:
<P>I believe I made a real estate investment or investments in 1977, which are reported in our 1978 income tax return.  I can recall nothing specific about this investment or investments, except that at least one involved the purchase of land near Jacksonville. . . .  As reported in our 1978 tax return, a five acre parcel of land was sold on May 17, 1978, for $5000, resulting in a capital gain of $2150.  To the best of my recollection, this was a real estate investment I had with Jim McDougal, and, while small, it was a profitable one.  This confirmed my impression that he was capable of putting together successful real estate transactions.121
<P>This 1977 transaction was President Clinton's first real estate investment venture, and his success was a factor in his decision to purchase the real estate in Marion County, Arkansas that came to be known as Whitewater.  
<P>Documentary evidence, including the Clinton's 1978 federal income tax return, indicates that the 1977 transaction between then-Attorney General Clinton and Mr. McDougal was significantly larger, longer and more profitable than previously described by the Clintons.  According to President Clinton, a five-acre parcel purchased on January 25, 1977 was sold for $5,000 on May 17, 1978, netting the Clintons a gain of $2,150 in just under 16 months.122   The schedules to the Clintons' 1978 tax returns also report, however, an installment sale of 15 acres of unimproved land.  This 15-acre parcel was purchased on the same date as the five-acre parcel, January 25, 1977, and was sold for $14,985 on July 23, 1978, netting the Clintons a gain of $6,435 in just under 18 months.123  Thus, according to their 1978 federal income tax return, the Clintons purchased 20 acres of land on January 25, 1977, with a reported cost of $11,400 and sold all 20 acres of the land by July 23, 1978 for $19,985, netting them a profit of $8,585 -- a 75 percent return on their total investment -- in just under a year and a half.  
<P>The land was purchased from Rolling Manor Inc., a company owned by Mr. McDougal and Senator Fulbright.124  A January 25, 1977 Purchaser's Agreement between Rolling Manor Inc., the seller, and Mr. Clinton, the buyer, states that Rolling Manor Inc. agreed to sell Tract Number 74 to Mr. Clinton for $11,400.125  This $11,400 equals the adjusted cost for the 5-acre parcel ($2,850) and the 15-acre parcel ($8,550) reported on the Clintons' 1978 personal income tax return.126 The terms of the purchase agreement called for Mr. Clinton to pay $400 in cash and execute an $11,000 note to finance the balance of the purchase price.  A  January 25, 1977 installment note between Rolling Manor, Inc. and Mr. Clinton in the face amount of $11,000 was prepared by Rolling Manor, Inc.127  Mr. Clinton was obligated to pay 96 monthly installments of $155.51 beginning on April 1, 1977 at an annual percentage rate of eight percent and continuing until May 1985.1 
<P>Mr. McDougal wrote to then-Attorney General Clinton on February 4, 1977 requesting the down payment of $400 "if you have it to spare"2  and giving notice that the first monthly payment on the note was coming due on April 1, 1977.128 
<P>A First Jacksonville Bank deposit slip that was marked "paid by" Bill Clinton indicates that the $11,000 note was fully paid off by November 9, 1977 -- less than ten months after Mr. Clinton purchased the 20-acre parcel from Rolling Manor Inc. and more than eight months prior to the sale of the 15-acre parcel on July 23, 1978.129   Because the property was not sold until 1978, the source of the $9000 payment to Rolling Manor Inc. in 1977 to completely pay off the $11,0003  Rolling Manor note is not known.4<P>   In sworn testimony, Gaines Norton, the Clintons' personal accountant who prepared their 1978 tax return, admitted that "the tax return which the President makes mention of in his interrogatories . . . makes it quite clear that there was a second investment or a second part of this investment with Mr. McDougal that involved a larger piece of property and a larger profit."130  Mr. Norton also admitted that the President's answer in the interrogatory is "incomplete."131
<P>B.<P>Whitewater: A "No Cash" Deal 
<P>In 1978, the Clintons and the McDougals purchased the Whitewater land development in an entirely leveraged transaction.  The Clintons and McDougals invested no money in the original mortgage.  As a result of Mr. Clinton's political position, it appears that bank officers routinely gave preferential treatment to Whitewater loans, often violating sound banking practices concerning timely payments and proper loan documentation. 
<P>Early on, then-Attorney General Clinton was made aware of the problems with the Mr. McDougal's Whitewater tax scheme by his personal accountant, Gaines Norton.132   Mr. Clinton asked Mr. Norton to sit in on a meeting with Mr. McDougal133 to "look at an investment he was making."134  During the meeting, Mr. McDougal explained how the transaction would be arranged so that even though no money was invested in the deal -- they would use "a hundred percent borrowed money"135 -- the McDougals and the Clintons "would immediately be able to take personal tax deductions."136  
<P>Mr. Norton, a certified public accountant, immediately advised both men that the proposed tax deduction would be illegal.137  Mr. McDougal would not listen,138 however.  Curiously, after the meeting, Mr. Clinton told Mr. Norton that he "had to rely on his partner to structure [the deal] tax-wise properly" and "to back off and leave the issue alone."139
<P>Thus, against the advice of his personal accountant, the Clintons joined with the McDougals in investing in the Whitewater land venture.  The deal was financed by two banks: Citizen's Bank of Flippin ("Citizen's Bank"), a small bank located near by the Whitewater property, and Union National Bank, a larger bank in Little Rock.140  Because the Whitewater mortgage exceeded the legal lending limit of Citizen's Bank, the transaction was structured as a loan participation with the larger Little Rock Union National Bank.  Thus, Citizen's Bank and Union National Bank each financed half of the $182,611 loan that was closed on August 2, 1978.141  
<P>Frank Burge, a Vice President and loan officer at Citizen's Bank, who handled the Whitewater loan, testified that the Whitewater loan was not a typical loan for the small bank, whose portfolio was composed of residential and consumer loans.142
<P>In addition, the Clintons and McDougals never notified Citizen's Bank that Union National Bank also extended a $20,000 unsecured loan for the down payment on the Whitewater mortgage. Citizen's Bank was not aware that the Clintons and McDougals invested no money into the original mortgage.143  This loan violated Citizen's Bank's practice of not making real estate loans without an equity contribution by the borrower.144   Mr. Burge explained that "(s)ound banking tenets said you should have equity on all real estate lending."145  Similarly, Don Denton, the loan officer at Union National Bank responsible for the Whitewater loans, thought that this transaction was a potential regulatory problem.146 
<P>In fact, the Union National loan was made only as an "accommodation" to Mr. Clinton, who had actively sought to obtain it.147  According to Mr. Denton, he was instructed by a Union Bank lobbyist to make this loan -- against Mr. Denton's judgment -- to Mr. Clinton, because Mr. Clinton was an "up and coming political ... rising star in the State of Arkansas."148  Paul Berry, a Union Bank lobbyist and Mr. Clinton's former college roommate admitted that Mr. Clinton had approached him about obtaining the money for the down payment on the Whitewater deal, but claimed that he made the loan because it was "good business."149  Mr. Denton testified, however, that he would not have made the loan, given the Clintons' and the McDougals' financial condition, "had it been an arms' length loan by a client walking off the street."150  According to Mr. Burge, Mr. Clinton's political position also influenced his decision to make the loan at Citizen's Bank.151
<P>Despite the fact that Mr. McDougal and Governor Clinton ignored repeated requests for payments of principal, Union National Bank renewed the Clintons' Whitewater loan a number of times.152  Rather quickly, Citizen's Bank became concerned over the Whitewater loan.  Robert Ritter, who became the President of Citizen's Bank in September 1979, was concerned early on that the Whitewater loan would become "an item either on an examination or it became a reportable item to the Board at a particular time."153  His apprehension was compounded by problems that Citizen's Bank faced obtaining personal financial statements for the Clintons and the McDougals.154   
<P>During the early 1980s, Mr. Ritter recalled meeting twice with Mrs. Clinton and twice with Mr. Clinton.155  Mr. Ritter met once with Mrs. Clinton and Mrs. McDougal to obtain signatures on loan renewal documents.156   Mr. Ritter testified that he believes they discussed loan repayment plans.157  Mr. Ritter also recalled a second meeting5  at the bank with Mrs. Clinton and Mrs. McDougal -- probably occasioned by a loan renewal.158  He testified that Mrs. Clinton appeared knowledgeable about the Whitewater real estate development and the Whitewater loan, and, in fact, she remarked on the sharp rise in the interest rate on the loan.159  Mr. Ritter also recalled contacting Mr. Clinton twice concerning loan documentation.160  
<P>The Clintons have stated that they have no recollection of meeting with officers of Citizen's Bank to discuss their troubled Whitewater loan.161
<P>In June 1980, the Clintons were released from their personal obligation on the Union National Bank loan when Mr. McDougal retired the loan with proceeds borrowed from the Bank of Cherry Valley.162 
<P>C.<P> Lot 13: Irregularities in Madison Bank's loan to Mrs. Clinton

<P>In December 1980, the Clintons and the McDougals sought to boost lagging Whitewater lot sales by building a model home on lot 13.  Mrs. Clinton borrowed $30,000 from Madison Bank and Trust in Kingston, Arkansas ("Madison Bank"), which was controlled by Mr. McDougal, to finance the construction of the model home.163  As with the earlier loans, this loan also was obtained under unusual circumstances.
<P>Madison Bank approved the loan even though Mrs. Clinton was not a pre-existing customer, and she lived outside the bank's lending area.164  According to Mr. Bunch, the loan was underwritten in a manner that was contrary to sound banking practices: "we probably didn't have anything in the file but a signed note.  I'm sure there wasn't a financial statement.  No documentation at all."165  
<P>Although Mrs. Clinton's Madison Bank loan was scheduled to mature on December 16, 1981, the loan apparently was extended for six-months to June 1, 1982.  From the origination of the loan to its maturity, Madison Bank received only $285 in monthly interest payments.  This amount was far less than the $373 in interest owed per month.166
<P>On August 5, 1982, two months after the June extension had expired, Theresa Pockrus, executive vice-president of Madison Bank, who was responsible for monitoring delinquent loans, wrote to Mrs. Clinton notifying her of the loan's past due status, and that a "satisfactory agreement needs to be worked out."167  Ms. Pockrus was concerned about the upcoming Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") audit.168  On August 11, Mrs. Clinton told Ms. Pockrus to speak with Mr. McDougal because he would personally take care of the situation.  According to Mrs. Clinton, Mr. McDougal had been handling the payments the entire time.169  Coincidentally, after Ms. Pockrus spoke to Mr. McDougal, Madison Bank shortly thereafter received a $699 payment from an unknown payor.170 
<P>No principal payments were made, however, on the loan.171  Ms. Pockrus believed that "the loan should have been taken out of the bank all together" because it was too risky, and would have recommended that the Board "not extend it...because a $5 million bank has no business loaning money to people in Little Rock."172
<P>On April 7, 1983, Madison Bank consented to a cease and desist order with the FDIC that, among other things, restricted Madison Bank's out-of-territory lending.173  The order effectively prohibited Madison Bank from extending Mrs. Clinton's Lot 13 loan.174  In January 1983, Mr. Clinton was sworn in as the Governor of Arkansas, and, in February, he appointed Marlin Jackson, former president of Security Bank of Paragould, to be the Commissioner of the Arkansas State Bank Department ("ASBD").175  
<P>On June 27, 1983, the ASBD released the results of its examination of Madison Bank, identifying Mrs. Clinton's loan as a problem.176  The ASBD later joined the FDIC in ordering Madison Bank to close out its out-of-territory loans.177  Thus, Madison Bank was forced to remove Mrs. Clinton's out-of-territory loan from its portfolio.178  Afterward, Mr. Jackson saw Governor Clinton in the State Capitol and told him about Madison Bank's  deteriorating condition.179  Mr. Jackson did not normally advise the Governor of the results of bank examinations.180
<P>Meanwhile, the Whitewater debt remained outstanding and sales were slow.  Mr. Jackson admitted that he directed Governor Clinton to seek a loan with Security Bank of Paragould ("Security Bank").181  Indeed, on September 30, 1983, Governor Clinton obtained an unsecured $20,800 loan from Security Bank and used the proceeds to pay off Mrs. Clinton's Madison Bank loan.6 
<P>When Mrs. Clinton asked for a loan extension, Security Bank offered a one-year extension to September 30, 1985.182  On October 11, 1985, after Mrs. Clinton failed to meet her payments, Security Bank extended the note again to September 30, 1986.183<P>  On November 1, 1985, Mr. Jackson wrote to Charles Campbell, vice-president of Security Bank, on the official letterhead of the State Banking Commissioner, enclosing the extension agreement.184  When asked about the propriety of Mr. Jackson's communicating to a bank on official stationary about the Governor's loan, William Lyon, a friend of Mr. Jackson's, a bank owner, and former member of the ASBD testified: "[i]t was not right for him to do that.  He should never have done this."185
<P>On November 20, 1986, Security Bank again sent Mrs. Clinton a notice that payment was past due on the loan, now in the amount of $15,435.51.186  On March 2, 1987, Mr. Jackson telephoned Mrs. Clinton to give her William Fisher's telephone number.187  Three days later, Mr. Fisher, the president of Security Bank, sent a new note to Mrs. Clinton for $14,117.59, due on March 5, 1988, and requested financial statements.188  On March 31, Mr. Jackson sent another letter to Mrs. Clinton, enclosing the extension agreement and telling her not to hesitate to contact Mr. Fisher.189  
<P>The Special Committee finds that it was clearly inappropriate for someone in Mr. Jackson's position to act as a go-between for the Clintons in their dealings with Security Bank, and, Mr. Jackson's involvement, at the very least, raises questions of whether improper influence was used to benefit the Clintons.  The letters sent and received by Mr. Jackson reveal a continuing pattern of activity by him on behalf of the Clintons while he was a Clinton-appointed state employee (who happened to own controlling interest in a bank that he was charged with regulating which, coincidentally, took over a loan that had been a problem for the Clintons).  
<P>Governor Clinton's loan at Security Bank of Paragould was frequently delinquent, and the bank constantly sought to either collect or extend the loan.  The loan officers experienced some difficulty in obtaining documents needed from the Clintons to complete the extension agreements.  
II.<P>The Clintons' Continued Involvement in Whitewater: 1987 - 1992

<P>A.<P>The Clintons' Active Involvement in the Management of Whitewater After 1986

<P>By early 1982, both the Governor and Mrs. Clinton had attended meetings with bankers on the Whitewater loan renewals. Therefore, the Clintons should have been aware that the cash flow from Whitewater was not covering the debt, and that lot sales were not going well (hence, the need for the December 1980 lot 13 prefab home in Mrs. Clinton's name to try to attract purchasers).190 
<P>Indeed, by May 1985, only 20 of the Whitewater 44 lots were under contract for deed.191  Whitewater realtor Christopher Wade and Dr. E. Russell Webb, through Ozark Air Services, Inc. ("Ozark Air"), acquired the remaining twenty-four lots in Whitewater.192  In exchange for the twenty-four lots, Ozark Air agreed to repay $35,000 of the remaining Whitewater loan to 1st Ozark (the Clintons and McDougals remained personally obligated on the note),193 and transferred title to a 1979 Piper Seminole airplane to James McDougal.194  Mrs. Clinton admitted in RTC interrogatories that McDougal informed her in 1986 that the remaining Whitewater lots had been sold to Chris Wade in 1985.195   
<P>Between 1982 and 1986, while Mr. McDougal was running Madison Guaranty, the Clintons made no cash payments toward the Whitewater loans.196  After Mr. McDougal was removed from Madison Guaranty in July 1986, Mrs. Clinton took a more active role in Whitewater.  
<P>Wesley Strange, who became President of 1st Ozark National Bank in 1986, testified that Mrs. Clinton, rather than Susan or James McDougal, was his primary contact person on the Whitewater loan,197 beginning sometime in the fall of 1986.198   Thereafter, Mr. Strange and Mrs. Clinton had numerous contacts relating to taxable income from Whitewater, loan documentation and the corporate records of Whitewater.199  
<P>Yet, the Clintons continued their pattern of failing to provide requested financial statements.  Obtaining relevant information for the credit file, particularly financial statements, regarding the Clintons and McDougals was a recurring problem for Citizen's Bank and its successor, 1st Ozark National Bank.200   1st Ozark loan officers hesitated, however, to press the Clintons for missing or delinquent information and "walked softly" with regard to this loan so as not to irritate Governor Clinton or the board of directors at the bank.201
<P>By 1987, 1st Ozark loan officers Ronald Proctor and Vernon Dewey both realized that the bank should not renew the Clintons' original Whitewater mortgage without first receiving current financial statements for the Clintons and establishing an escrow account to reduce the principal balance of the loan.202   Nevertheless, the bank continued to exercise forbearance, granting waivers on the provision of financial information to both the Clintons and the McDougals.  The bank also failed to undertake minimal efforts to ensure that the Clintons and the McDougals had sufficient collateral for the loan; for instance, there was no evidence of an appraisal or inspection of the Whitewater property (the primary source of collateral for the bank) between the summer of 1978 and December 1986.203
<P>On November 28, 1988, Mrs. Clinton wrote to Mr. McDougal seeking power of attorney for matters concerning the Whitewater investment.  The letter said: "I am enclosing a Power of Attorney for you to sign, authorizing me to act on your behalf with respect to matters concerning Whitewater Development Corp."  Mrs. Clinton's letter also indicated that the Clintons at the time were actively involved in attempts to dispose of the remaining Whitewater property:  "We are trying to sell off the property that is left and get out from under the obligations at both Flippin and Paragould."204  
<P>On June 21, 1990, Mrs. Clinton signed the legal forms indicating that, as of December 31, 1987, and December 31, 1988, she was the President of Whitewater Development Corp.205  
<P>B.<P>Governor Clinton's Approval of Special Legislation Benefitting his Whitewater Banker 

<P>On February 15, 1984, Citizen's Bank, which continued to hold the original Whitewater mortgage, was sold to TC Bancshares.206  This acquisition was significant for several reasons.  First, on January 1, 1986, Citizen's Bank's charter was converted into a national bank chartered and subject to examination by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the "OCC") and became known as 1st Ozark National Bank.207  This conversion significantly changed the regulatory environment for the bank holding the Whitewater mortgage.  OCC examinations were precise and demanding; loan management and credit file maintenance were subject to greater scrutiny.208    
<P>Second, TC Bancshares' flagship bank was Twin City Bank ("TCB") of North Little Rock, one of the largest state-chartered banks in Arkansas.209  TCB's President, Edward Penick, and its Chairman, Terry Renaud, became members of 1st Ozark's board of directors,210 and Susan Sisk, a senior lending officer at TCB, was assigned to review the decisions of the 1st Ozark officer's loan committee and, because of the loan committee's requirement for unanimous action, could exercise virtual veto power.211  
<P>In the mid-1980's, TCB sought to amend Arkansas' restrictive bank branching laws.212   TCB's growth was limited because of the restrictions that Arkansas law placed on branching; TCB, which was headquartered in North Little Rock, could not branch into Little Rock.  As early as May 26, 1986, Mr. Penick began to look for solutions to this problem.  After meeting with State Banking Commissioner Marlin Jackson, it became apparent to Mr. Penick that TCB's desire for expanded branching powers could not be realized without legislation.213  During the 1987 Arkansas Legislative session, legislation was introduced that would permit TCB to enter the lucrative Little Rock market.
<P>On April 1, 1987, this legislation, Act 539, was approved.214  Act 539 amended Arkansas bank branching law to allow banks located in counties with populations of greater than 200,000 people to branch anywhere in that county.  Because Pulaski County (which includes Little Rock and North Little Rock) was the only county in Arkansas with a population over 200,000, this law implicated the Arkansas Constitution's prohibition against local legislation.215
<P>Act 539 was passed without widespread support from the Arkansas banking industry.  Mr. Penick recalled that a majority of the state's banks opposed this bill, and that both Arkansas Bankers Association and Independent Bankers Association opposed this legislation.216  Nevertheless, Act 539 did enjoy support from two major banks with connections to the financing of Whitewater  -- TCB and Union National Bank (the bank that loaned the Clintons and McDougals the down payment for Whitewater, and financed half of the mortgage loan for the Whitewater property).  Mr. Penick testified that he was "proactive" in his lobbying on behalf of Act 539.217  Mr. Penick worked closely with Paul Berry -- Governor Clinton's former roommate who had helped secure the Whitewater down payment loan -- on passage of this bill.  Mr. Berry admitted that he contacted Governor Clinton to encourage him not to veto this legislation.218  
<P>This same time period -- from the middle of 1986 through the spring of 1987 -- was an important time for Whitewater Development Corp.  The Dallas Federal Home Loan Bank had forced James McDougal out of Madison in July 1986219, and Whitewater Development Corp. had accrued $90,000 in unrecoverable losses.  In a November 14, 1986 letter, Mr. McDougal apprised the Clintons of these losses and cash flow problems.  In this letter, Mr. McDougal suggested that the Clintons transfer their Whitewater shares to him, and that he would assume the losses.220   The Clintons refused the offer, and the Whitewater loan at 1st Ozark matured on December 3, 1986.221 
<P>Thus, in December 1986, in light of past criticism from federal regulators about the quality of loan documentation, Ronald Proctor, the 1st Ozark lending officer primarily responsible for the Whitewater loan, drove to the Whitewater property to conduct an inspection.  Mr. Proctor testified that collateral inspections were "very common" when a real estate development loan came up for renewal.222  Mr. Proctor's supervisor, Mr. Strange, agreed, testifying that such inspections would have been "prudent."223  Nevertheless, this was the first time that Mr. Proctor inspected the property.224   In fact, there is no evidence in the Whitewater credit file of any other independent appraisal of the property between 1978 and December 1986, and Mr. Proctor's 1984 work sheet employs the $1,100 per acre value from the 1978 appraisal.225 
<P>Mr. Proctor's inspection showed that the value of Whitewater had declined precipitously, from $1,100 per acre to no more than $750 per acre.226  Thus, since the Whitewater loan had two primary sources of security -- the property that collateralized the loan, and the guarantees of the Clintons and McDougals -- the value of the guarantees of the Clintons and McDougals was now of greater importance to 1st Ozark in considering whether to renew the loan.  In order to make a decision on loan renewal, financial statements are necessary; indeed, sound banking policy dictates annual submission of updated financial statements to ensure a borrower's financial condition is not deteriorating.227  
Nevertheless, 1st Ozark did not possess current financial statements for the Clintons.  Because there was real concern about renewing the Whitewater loan without receiving current financial statements, 1st Ozark conditioned the loan extension on, among other things, the provision of financial statements by the Clintons and McDougals.228  Vernon Dewey believed that 1st Ozark should have required repayment of the loan and shared his concern with Ron Proctor.  Nevertheless, Mr. Dewey voted to approve the renewal because it was for the Governor.229 
<P>Despite the fact that the Whitewater loan's renewal was conditioned on the provision of financial statements, 1st Ozark once again experienced difficulty obtaining them.  Mr. Strange, 1st Ozark's president, mentioned this problem to Governor Clinton but still no financial statements were forthcoming.230   At some point in early 1987, the absence of financial statements for the Clintons was brought to the attention of 1st Ozark's chairman, and TCB's president, Mr. Penick.  Mr. Penick agreed to help in securing the necessary financial information from the Clintons.231  Mr. Penick decided to take steps to obtain the financial information from the Clintons.  He testified that he mailed the to Mrs. Clinton Twin City Bank financial statement form, although no such correspondence was produced to the Special Committee.232
<P>Ronald Proctor and Vernon Dewey, who were both members of the loan committee that required the financial statement as a condition for renewal, recalled that Mr. Penick offered to have Margaret Davenport, who was a friend of Mrs. Clinton's, contact Ms. Clinton to obtain the financial statement.233  Mr. Penick claimed he did not recall soliciting Ms. Davenport's assistance to obtain the financial statement.234
<P>Mrs. Clinton' handwritten notes indicate, however, that she discussed the Whitewater loan with Ms. Davenport in 1987.  The information regarding the status of the loan makes it clear that the notes relate to the 1987 extension. 235  Ms. (Davenport) Eldridge claimed that she did not recall this conversation, even after reviewing these notes.236  1st Ozark finally obtained the Clinton's financial statement237, on a TCB form, and the Clinton's guaranty agreement, both dated March 26, 1987.238<P>   Curiously, four days after the loan was renewed, Governor Clinton signed Act 539 into law.
<P>The next year, banking legislation affecting TCB came before the Arkansas legislature.  Although the Legislature was not scheduled to meet in 1988, the Banking industry was pressing for a special session to consider an "omnibus banking bill."  The catalyst for this push was the United States Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit's decision in Department of Banking v. Clarke.  In effect, the Clarke decision authorized Mississippi national banks to branch based on the more liberal branching laws that applied to Mississippi savings associations (rather than the branching laws that applied to Mississippi-chartered commercial banks).239  The Arkansas banking industry was concerned that the OCC would employ the Clarke decision to grant national banks expansive branching powers, and thereby give national banks in Arkansas a competitive advantage over state banks.240
<P>Governor Clinton was not eager to call a special session; both his Chief of Staff, Betsey Wright and a close associate, Bruce Lindsey advised against it.241  Governor Clinton and his staff were apprised that TCB was among a small group of banks that opposed the special session and the omnibus banking bill.242   TCB's concern was that the 1988 bill might be used to close the loophole that Act 539 had created in the so-called "300 feet rule."  Act 539 had removed restrictions on branching in Pulaski County, including a restriction on opening a branch within 300 feet of another bank.  This provision allowed TCB to open a branch in downtown Little Rock, within 300 feet of the offices of First Commercial Bank.243  First Commercial had sought an Attorney General's opinion regarding Act 539's constitutionality and had initiated a lawsuit, claiming that Act 539 was unconstitutional local legislation.244  The Governor's office was apprised of both these actions.245 
<P>In early 1988, draft legislation was circulated and Hartsfield and the Arkansas Bankers Association began working on building support for the special session.246  TCB's concern that the 1988 bill might be used to reimpose the 300 foot rule on TCB was well-founded.  While the initial draft of this legislation probably did not contain language closing this loophole, Bill Bowen of First Commercial continued his efforts to close the loophole.247   At some point in the process, he was able to obtain language in draft legislation to close the loophole.  TCB maintained its opposition to the special session throughout spring 1988.   Mr. Bowen told the Governor's assistant, Samuel Bratton, that TCB was "attempting `to be a spoiler'."248  Clearly, there was a conflict between TCB and First Commercial with respect to the 300 feet rule, or, more aptly, the presence of TCB's downtown Little Rock branch.
<P>While the disputes regarding the Special Session ensued, the Whitewater loan was coming up for renewal.  Under the March 1987 extension, the loan matured on April 3, 1988.249   In February 1988, Mr. Proctor began to seek financial statements needed for the renewal from the Clintons and McDougals.  During telephone conversation with Mrs. McDougal, Mr. Proctor "implied" that the loan would not be renewed without updated  financials.250  A loan extension agreement was prepared for signature on April 3, 1988, but was not signed.  Apparently, the McDougals, who were the officers of Whitewater Development Corp. and the only persons authorized to sign the renewal documents, could not be located to sign them.  1st Ozark enlisted Mrs. Clinton in an attempt to locate the McDougals and to obtain the necessary signatures for renewing the loan.251 
<P>On July 3, 1988 Governor Clinton called a special session of the Arkansas Legislature to consider the banking bill.252   The TCB/First Commercial conflict over the 300 feet issue remained unresolved; however, documentary evidence in the Committee's possession indicates that this issue was shortly resolved when Governor Clinton intervened on TCB's behalf.  There are notes of a July 5, 1988 meeting (that appear to be in Mr. Bratton's handwriting) regarding revisions to the Banking Bill.  These notes includes the following notation:  "p 16 - `300 feet' provision -- BC will call Bowen."253   That same day, Betsey Wright sent a memorandum to Governor Clinton and Mr. Bratton regarding the "300 foot" issue.  Suggesting that the Governor had intervened, Wright wrote that:
<P> "(n)either Sam nor I understands what your next step/followup with Bill Bowen is on the 300' issue.  The bill which is being delivered to this office in the morning by the Bankers Association/Bill Ford does not contain the 300' provision based on their conversation with you this morning."254 
A July 5th draft delivered to the Governor's office contains the same "grandfather clause" that Ed Penick had suggested to Marlin Jackson in a May 23, 1988 letter.255  Also on July 5, 1988, Mr. Penick sent a note to "Bill" thanking him for his assistance on the 300 feet provision.256   When questioned regarding this note, Mr. Penick suggested that it was not a note to Governor Clinton, but rather Banking Commissioner Bill Ford.  The available documentary evidence undermines Mr. Penick's recollection.  First, this handwritten note was discovered among the Governor's papers.  The Banking Department's records were subpoenaed and this note was not produced (despite the fact that Bill Ford is still Commissioner).  Second, this note contains the notation "GOV," as well as the check mark that Governor Clinton frequently used to indicate that he had reviewed an item.  Mr.  Penick testified that he was more likely to address Governor Clinton as "Governor" than "Bill."257   Mr. Penick's recollection on this count also is called into question by the documentary evidence; notably, the Committee obtained a June 6, 1988 note from Mr. Penick to Governor Clinton in which the salutation is also to "Bill."258
<P>On July 7, 1988, Bill Bowen responded to Governor Clinton's proposal to remove "300 feet language" from the proposed bill.  While Mr. Bowen committed himself to support the total package, he indicated in his letter that the package as proposed (including the 300 feet provision) enjoyed the support of 80% of bank CEO's in attendance at a March 1988 industry meeting, and that the "300-feet" specific provision enjoyed overwhelming support among the leadership of the Arkansas Bankers Association.259
<P>Nevertheless, TCB carried the day.  On July 15, 1988, the banking bill became law.  As enacted, the bill did not contain Mr. Penick's suggested grandfather provision, but it did contain language that protected TCB's presence in Little Rock's downtown business area.260 
<P>Again curiously, that same day, the Clintons received a loan extension from 1st Ozark for their Whitewater loan for three years, through November 3, 1991.  This renewal occurred three months after the loan term had matured.261 Mrs. Clinton, who had been unable to contact either of the McDougals, signed for Whitewater Development Corp.  1st Ozark waived the financial statement requirement for both the McDougals and the Clintons.  The waiver for the Clintons would appear to be unusual -- with the McDougals out of the picture, the Clintons were the sole guarantors of the loan's repayment.  
<P>Granting this waiver to the McDougals and Clintons represented a change in policy for 1st Ozark.  Mr. Proctor, who wrote to Mrs. McDougal for financial statements in February 1988 (nearly two months before the loan came due), was unable to explain why this same information was not necessary in July 1988.262
III.<P>The Clintons' Handling of Whitewater During the 1992 Presidential Campaign

<P>A.<P>The Focus on Whitewater During the 1992 Campaign 
<P>During the 1992 presidential campaign, questions arose about Whitewater, Madison, and the Clintons' relationship with the McDougals.  On March 8, 1992, the front page of the New York Times carried the headline: "Clintons Joined S&L Operator In An Ozark Real-Estate Venture."  The article, written by Jeff Gerth, reported the ties between the Clintons and the McDougals, focusing attention on their investment in Whitewater and the questionable tax deductions taken by the Clintons in 1984 and 1985.  The Times report suggested that Whitewater may have been used as a conduit to funnel money to the Clintons or to Bill Clinton's political campaigns.263
<P>In anticipation of the Gerth article and in response to the subsequent media interest in the story, the Clinton campaign organized a team of senior advisors to gather facts about from other candidates.  Susan Thomases, the New York lawyer and confidant of Mrs. Clinton, involved in matters surrounding the handling of documents in Vincent Foster's office following his death, and Loretta Lynch, a campaign official, reconstructed Whitewater-related records and coordinated the response effort.264  Webster Hubbell and Vincent Foster, both then partners at the Rose Law Firm, were responsible for collecting materials from Rose relating to Mrs. Clinton's work for Mr. McDougal and his S&L.265
<P>The campaign's effort to contact the McDougal and other principals associated with Whitewater-related transaction was headed by James Blair, General Counsel of Tyson Foods, and a close friend of the Clintons.  Mr. Blair had also known Mr. McDougal for over 30 years.266  After Whitewater surfaced in the campaign, Mr. Blair contacted Mr. McDougal's lawyer, Sam Heuer, and arranged a meeting for Mr. Blair, Ms. Lynch, Mr. McDougal, and Mr. Heuer.267
<P>Several days after the first New York Times article was published, on March 11, Mr. Blair and Ms. Lynch went to Mr. Heuer's office.268  When they arrived, Mr. Heuer met the pair outside and escorted them upstairs into his office.269  After some pleasantries, Mr. Blair asked Mr. McDougal why he talked to Mr. Gerth from the New York Times."270  Mr. McDougal replied that, based on his experience an assistant to former Senator Fulbright, "when the press had something it was better to talk and simply give it all to them."271
<P>When Mr. Blair asked whether Mr. McDougal would stop talking to the press, Mr. McDougal stated that he would "but indicated he didn't want to be bashed in the press."272
<P>Mr. Blair then travelled to Flippin to interview Christopher Wade, the Whitewater real estate agent, and to obtain some records.  It is not clear exactly what documents Mr. Blair collected from the Wades or whether Mr. Blair took notes of his conversations with Mr. Wade.  The campaign file containing the notation -- "WWDC Jim Blair Flippin Trip"273 -- was empty.274  When asked about his interview of Mr. Wade, Blair testified that he discussed the fact that Mr. Wade had not discharged his obligation on the $35,000.275
<P>Mr. Blair also accused Mr. Wade of taking advantage of Mr. McDougal's situation in the 1985 transfer of the 24 Whitewater lots,276 and Mr. Blair questioned Mr. Wade about why he had not paid off the Whitewater mortgage.  On May 11, 1992, shortly after the visit from Mr. Blair, Ozark Air obtained a loan from River Valley Bank & Trust ("River Valley"), formerly Citizens Bank of Lavaca, for $10,500.277  As collateral for this loan, Ozark Air relied on the escrow contracts on lots 2, 9, 23, 30, 37, 43, and 44 of Whitewater Estates.278  On May 12, 1992, Ozark Air wrote a check to 1st Ozark for $9,628.67 to close out the remaining Whitewater mortgage.279  
<P>By paying off the Whitewater loan with another bank loan, Mr. Wade merely exchanged one liability (his contractual obligation to assume $35,000 of the outstanding debt on the mortgage) for another (his obligation to River Valley Bank to repay a loan that was secured by the same collateral securing the Whitewater mortgage loan).  However, this transaction accomplished one significant goal -- it released the Clintons, who were guarantors of the Whitewater loan, from personal liability.280   Mr. Wade asserted his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, so the Committee was unable to examine him regarding this loan.281  
<P>Mr. Wade obtained the loan that he used to pay-off the Whitewater loan through former Citizen's Bank President James Patterson who was then the President of River Valley.282  After Mr. Wade called Mr. Patterson, he was granted this loan over the phone.283   Mr. Patterson, who admitted he did not even like Mr. Wade284, claimed that he did not recall the purpose of the loan or whether the bank received collateral.285  Mr. Patterson admitted that the loan to Mr. Wade was outside of River Valley's lending territory.286   
<P>It is unclear why Mr. Patterson would make this loan to Mr. Wade when Mr. Wade was in bankruptcy.7   Mr. Patterson initially testified that Wade had emerged from bankruptcy by the time this loan was made.287   When asked whether he understood that a person in bankruptcy is not supposed to engage in financial transactions without court supervision, Patterson claimed that he "didn't understand that if somebody had filed bankruptcy that they couldn't go make a new deal."288  In fact, Mr. Patterson continued to assert that he made this loan to Mr. Wade, a man who was in involuntary bankruptcy, because "(h)e was worth the loan."289
<P>B.<P>The Lyons Report
<P>In February or early March 1992, James Lyons, a senior partner at the Denver, Colorado law firm of Rothgerber, Appel, Powers & Johnson, was asked by the Clinton campaign to investigate the Clintons' investment in Whitewater.290  Mr. Lyons specialized in complex civil litigation.291  He was also a friend and political supporter of the Clintons since the late 1970s292 and was the ad hoc chair of a group of lawyers from around the country who provided support and volunteer legal advice and services to the Clinton campaign.293
<P>Mr. Lyons reviewed the available Whitewater "documents and information...that had been assembled by campaign staff after the issue had been raised by Mr. Jeff Gerth of the New York Times."294  Based on his preliminary analysis of the documents, Mr. Lyons determined that the campaign "needed accounting help to assist in a financial reconstruction."  He "made a recommendation to campaign staff and to Governor and Mrs. Clinton . . . to engage Patten, McCarthy & Associates,"295 a Denver financial consulting firm.
<P>In early March 1992, Mr. Lyons contacted Leslie Patten, a certified public accountant and president of Patten, McCarthy & Associates,296 and engaged his firm, on behalf of the Clintons, to conduct "a financial reconstruction of Whitewater Development Corporation from the then available books and records."297  Mr. Lyons and Mr. Patten were "friends" and "had a professional relationship for a number of years."298  Mr. Patten's firm provided "consultation on banking, financial, accounting and tax matters arising from business litigation and expert witness testimony on such issues."299  On March 10, 1992 the Patten firm began working on its analysis of Whitewater.300  Mr. Patten and Norris Weese, another certified public accountant and the firm's vice president, were the only professionals who performed work on the document that became the final report.301  Mr. Weese went to Arkansas to gather documents and began the financial analyses, and Mr. Patten reviewed the financial analyses and drafted the document that became the final report.302 
<P>Work on the so-called Lyons report proceeded rapidly, with the involvement of Mrs. Clinton.  On March 18, 1992, just eight days after the Mr. Patten and Mr. Weese began work on the project, a draft of the final report was completed,303 and was faxed the next day to Mr. Lyons, Mrs. Clinton, Loretta Lynch and James Hamilton, a lawyer working with Mr. Lyons on the Clinton campaign.304  The fax to Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Lynch was 55 pages long and contained over 30 pages of work papers prepared by the Patten firm.  On March 20, a revised draft was faxed to Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Hamilton, and John Klusaritz, another Clinton campaign lawyer.305  Later that day, Mr. Patten faxed to Mrs Clinton a revised report, dated March 20, 1992 and addressed to Governor Bill Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton, that contained six type-written pages.  The report was signed by Mr. Patten and Mr. Weese.306  According to Mr. Patten, "the substance of the report was pretty much final at that point," but "I think we were premature in signing it because we had not obtained everybody's comments."307  During this period, Mr. Patten testified that he "was in fairly regular communication with Mr. Lyons," who "was anxious to get this project completed and was seeking periodic updates as to where we were in the process."308
<P>Then, on March 20 or March 21, 1992, Mr. Lyons contacted Mr. Patten and told him that he wanted two versions of the report prepared, a summary version that only addressed specific questions raised by the press and a full report addressed to him.  According to Mr. Patten's testimony:
<P>It's at this approximate point [in] time when Mr. Lyons advised me that he wanted a summary report prepared. . . .  The essence of it was that Mr. Lyons indicated that he [would] like to have a summary report in addition to the full report which would be addressed to him. . . .  My understanding was that the purpose of the summary report was to address two or three specific questions that had been raised by the press.309  
<P>Mr. Lyons testified that the Patten firm "prepared a single report and a summary of it"310 and that "[o]ne is simply shorter and in my opinion was more responsive to the issues that were then being put forward by the press."311  On March 21, 1992, Mr. Patten faxed a shorter version of the report to Mrs Clinton.312  As with the version of the report faxed to Mrs. Clinton the day before, this version of the report, dated March 21, 1992, was addressed to the Clintons and was signed by Mr. Patten and Mr. Weese, but it was almost three pages shorter than the previous day's version.313  On March 22, 1992, Mr. Patten faxed even shorter versions of the report, dated March 23, 1992 and signed by Mr. Weese and Mr. Patten, to Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Lynch.314  
<P>On March 23, 1992, Mr. Patten faxed Mrs. Clinton the final summary version of the Patten firm's report, which contained three type-written pages and two pages of charts.315 A one page cover letter from Mr. Patten to the Clintons states: "Pursuant to the request of James Lyons, Esq., enclosed please find Patten McCarthy & Associates, Inc's report pursuant to our recent engagement."
<P>In a March 23, 1992 letter to the Clintons, Mr. Lyons notified the Clintons that his review of Whitewater had been completed.  He noted the findings of the summary report, including that the Clintons' had "invested approximately $70,000 in the corporation."316  The Clinton campaign only released the final summary version of the Patten firm's report to the press,317 and Mr. Patten testified that Mr. Lyons "is the only individual that received both versions of the report."318
<P>On April 10, 1992, Mr. Lyons sent the Clintons the final complete version319 of the Patten firm's report, which contained seven type-written pages and three pages of charts.320  In his cover letter, Mr. Lyons states:
<P>Enclosed please find the complete report prepared by Patten, McCarthy & Associates concerning Whitewater Development.  A summary of this report was previously sent to you and released to the press along with a cover letter from me on March 23, 1992.  I have deferred sending this complete report until now to avoid any confusion or possible inadvertent production.  The only copies of this report which exist (other than the enclosed original) are in my file and the confidential files of Les Patten.321

<P>He then explained that the summary report omitted several items:

<P>Please note the enclosed report discusses such things as the $9,000 interest deduction taken by you in 1980, lot 13 and borrowings associated with it, and the sale of 24 lots in 1985 to Ozark Air for assumption of the mortgage and an airplane.  None of these items is set out in the summary report which was released to the press.  Similarly, the summary report released to the press did not contain Schedule 1, which details loans and advances by the McDougals and the Clintons from 1980- 1991.322

<P>Mr. Lyons concluded his letter by noting: "Accordingly, it is my recommendation to you that you maintain the complete report in strictest confidence and do not waive either the attorney/client or accountant/client privilege which attaches to the enclosed report."(emphasis added)323
<P>Mr. Lindsey testified that the complete report was not released to the press as of late 1993.324 According to his testimony, "it turned out later [after late 1993] at least one reporter, through other sources, probably Independent Counsel, who knows, reported on the longer version of the Lyons report, but at that time I don't think anyone had reported on it."325
<P>In March 1994, almost two years to the date after the Patten firm issued its report, it was discovered that the report had overstated the Clintons investment in Whitewater by $22,244.65.326  The $68,900 investment in Whitewater by the Clintons reported by the Patten firm included a check paid by Mr. Clinton to Madison Bank and Trust in 1982 on a loan used to purchase a house for his mother in Hot Springs, Arkansas.327  Thus, the Patten firm overstated the Clinton's Whitewater investment by more than 30 percent.
<P>Less than two weeks after this error was first acknowledged, Mr. Patten, in a November 4, 1993 memorandum to Mr. Lyons, explained the problems that his firm had encountered in its analysis.  Mr. Patten noted that his firm's work "did not and could not constitute an audit, review, compilation or the application of agreed upon procedures as those terms are understood within the accounting profession."  He further wrote that "source documentation was not available in many instances and we had to utilize the next best available documentation," and that "[t]he financial statements that we reconstructed took into consideration monies paid by the Clintons, the McDougals and others that had not been reflected in the accountant's workpapers or tax returns."328
<P>C.<P>The Clintons Finally Get Out of Whitewater 
<P>Among the documents in Mr. Foster's office at the time of his death was his handwritten note: "Get out of White Water."329  To that end, Mr. Foster, Mr. Hubbell and others in the Clinton organization met with Mr. Lyons on November 24, 1992, two weeks after Mr. Clinton was elected President.330
<P>Mr. Blair called Mr. McDougal's attorney, Sam Heuer, and told him that "the Clintons and the McDougals needed to be totally separated over the Whitewater thing."331  According to Mr. Blair, he suggested that Mr. McDougal pay a nominal amount to buy the Clintons' interest in Whitewater:332  "I think we settled on a thousand dollars as an appropriate nominal amount."333  There was one problem: "McDougal doesn't have a thousand dollars."334  Mr. Blair then told Mr. Heuer, "[W]ell, what the heck, I will loan him the thousand dollars.  I'll just Fed Ex you a check to your trust account.  And I believe that's what I did."335  The loan was made without interest,336 and Mr. McDougal has never repaid Mr. Blair.337  
<P>On December 22, 1993, Mr. McDougal and the Clintons executed the transaction to get the Clintons out of Whitewater.338  Mr. Foster obtained the Clintons' signature for the documents executing the sale.339  It is unclear whether Mr. Foster, Mr. McDougal, or the Clintons knew that Mr. Blair gave Mr. McDougal the $1000 to buy the Whitewater shares from the Clintons.340
<P>Mr. Blair then assigned Mr. Foster the task of contacting the accountants and preparing the Clintons' tax returns.341  The issue facing Mr. Foster in the months preceding his death was how to treat the $1000 sale on the Clintons' 1992 tax returns.  The basic dilemma stemmed from the Clintons' claim, bolstered by the publicly released Lyons report, that they had incurred significant losses on their investment in Whitewater.  The problem with declaring the loss on the Clintons's tax return was the lack of a proper basis with which to calculate the cost of the venture to the Clintons.  Despite their claim that they were 50% partners in the venture, the Clintons had contributed less than 25% of the funds used to cover Whitewater's losses.
<P>Also among the documents in Mr. Foster's office at the time of death were his notes of conversations with the Clintons' accountant, Yoly Redden.342  The notes, in Mr. Foster's hand, identified the tax problem as a "can of worms you shouldn't open."343  His notes in the file outlined the basic tax issues the Clintons faced in connection with Whitewater:
<P>"1)<P>What was nature of deductions
<P><P>A.  How deduct interest/principal payments for corp.?

<P>2)<P>Can you use contribution which predated incorporation?

<P>3)<P>Contribution/advancements of $68,900 to the McD

<P>4)<P>Inability to utilize $8000 capital loss"344
<P>Mr. Foster's objective was to avoid calling attention to Whitewater during the annual audit of the President and Mrs. Clinton's tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service audit.345  One approach was simply to report a wash, that is, to show no loss and no gain from the venture, thereby obviating the need for any tax treatment.  The problem with such treatment, however, was that it would have bolstered the allegation that the Clintons were insulated from Whitewater losses and thus the company was a vehicle for Mr. McDougal to channel funds to the Clintons.
<P>In notes titled "Discussion Points," Mr. Foster wrote:
<P>1)<P>An argument that they were protected against loss:
<P><P>A)  wash is consistent with this theory346

But Mr. Foster did not a have a proper cost basis with which to calculate the Clintons' true losses or gains.  His discussion points continued:
<P>2)<P>Improper to reduce basis by improper tax benefit

<P>3)<P>Computation of economic loss was based, in part, on assumptions
<P><P>Whereas computation of tax gain or loss must be defensible in audit.347
<P>Therein lay the problem.  To claim a loss based on economic assumptions, as the Lyons report did, was one thing.8   But to claim a loss on the Clintons' 1992 tax returns without proper support and documentation increased the likelihood of calling attention to Whitewater during the IRS audit--of opening the can of worms that Mr. Foster and the Clintons' accountant wished to keep sealed.348
<P>Mr. Foster's notes summarized the options as follows:
<P>"10<P>Options
<P><P>$1000 basis<P>so no tax effect
<P><P>but is arbitrary & still risks audit
<P><P><P><P>    vs
<P><P>0 basis w/ $1000 gain
<P><P>avoids any audit of issue"349
<P>In a letter to Mr. Foster days before the tax returns were due, Ms. Redden, the accountant the Clintons hired to handle Whitewater tax issues, wrote:  "Because of the numerous problems with Whitewater records and the commingling of funds with other companies and individuals, I believe many explanations may have to be made if we claim a loss."350 This letter, addressed to Mr. Foster, was not among the documents in Mr. Foster's office that the White House produced to the Special Committee.  It was obtained by the Special Committee through another source.351  Ms. Redden testified that after the Clintons were in the White House she had a number of discussions with Mr. Foster concerning tax issues related to Whitewater.352  The main focus of these numerous communications was the tax basis for the Clintons' contributions to Whitewater and how to treat the $1000 payment.353
<P>The Clintons' final tax returns for 1992 reported a capital gain of $1000 from the sale of stock to Mr. McDougal.354  According to Ms. Redden, "I think we need to claim no gain or a loss."355  Mr. Foster did not follow her advice, however, because he was also consulting with another accountant, and "[a]t the end we compromised what we were going to put in the return in connection with Whitewater."356
IV.<P>The Clintons' Questionable Tax Treatment of Whitewater: A History of Unreportable Income and Improper Deductions

<P>During the years that the Clintons owned an interest in Whitewater, the Clintons adopted an aggressive approach to the tax treatment of their investment.  This approach sometimes resulted in errors on their federal income tax returns.  From 1978 to the early 1990s, the Clintons invested a total of $42,192 in Whitewater.357  During this same period, the Clintons deducted $42,656 of their Whitewater related expenses on their federal income tax returns -- almost $500 more than their total investment in the corporation.
<P>The Special Committee's analysis of the Clintons' treatment of individual Whitewater-related items on their federal income tax returns reveals that the Clintons took a number of questionable tax positions relating to Whitewater.  From 1992 to the present, the Clintons have admitted taking improper deductions of $7,928 and omitting income of $8,171 on their federal income tax returns during the period of their Whitewater investment.  Therefore, the Clintons have admitted understating their income by $16,099 during this period.  Based on its analysis of the available evidence, the Special Committee concluded that the Clintons could have understated their income on Whitewater related items by an additional $33,771, for a total increase in taxable income of $49,870.
<P>The Clintons have explained that errors on their tax returns relating to Whitewater were due to mistakes made by their accountants.  The Clintons did not fully disclose, however, all of their financial information to their accountants,358 did not discuss the details of important financial transactions with them,359 and sometimes simply ignored their accountant's advice.360
<P>Gaines Norton, the Clintons' personal accountant from 1978 to 1984, stated that the Clintons provided him with the information used to prepare their tax returns.361  According to Mr. Norton, a former IRS revenue agent and a certified public accountant, the Clintons did not provide him with underlying documents, but instead provided him with summaries,362 such as handwritten lists on notepads.363  In one case, Mr. Norton raised specific tax concerns about the structure of Whitewater and Mr. Clinton told him "to back off and leave the issue alone."364  The errors and questions discussed in this section, therefore, cannot be dismissed as merely mistakes by the Clintons' personal accountants.<P>  
<P>A.<P>1978: The Clintons' Unreported Income of $5,405 from 15-Acre Installment Sale

<P>The Clintons may have unreported income of $5,405 from their 1978 installment sale of 15 acres of land originally purchased from Rolling Manor Inc., a company owned and controlled by Mr. McDougal.  On January 25, 1977, then-Attorney General Clinton purchased 20 acres of land from Rolling Manor Inc. for $11,400.365  The Clintons' 1978 federal income tax return reports that they sold 20 acres of land in 1978 in two separate transactions, a cash sale of five acres and an installment sale of 15 acres.  On May 17, 1978, the Clintons sold five acres on a cash basis for $5,000, resulting in a gain of $2,150, which was properly reported on Schedule D (Capital Gains or Losses) of their 1978 return.366  On July 23, 1978, the Clintons sold 15 acres of unimproved land on the installment method for $14,985, resulting in a gain of $6,435.367  Since the Clintons elected to report this $6,435 gain on the installment method, only $886 of the gain was taxable in 1978 and was reported by the Clintons on their return.368  The $5,549 balance of the gain ($6,435 - $886) from this 15-acre land sale was to be reported in future years as the Clintons received the payments from the buyer.  
<P>$5,405 of the $5,549 deferred gain reported on the Clintons' 1978 return does not appear, however, in their subsequent federal income tax returns.  The Clintons did not report any income from the 15-acre installment sale on their 1979 tax return.369  The Clintons did report $144 in capital gains from an installment sale on Schedule D (Capital Gains and Losses) of their 1980 tax return.370  The Clintons did not report any income from the 15-acre installment sale on any of their tax returns after 1980.9   How the Clintons collected a total of $2,066 in 1978 on the sale of this 15 acre tract of land, collected no funds in 1979, collected a total of $335 in 1980, of which $144 was reported as a gain on their 1980 tax return, and then collected no other funds from the buyer remains unexplained.
<P>If the Clintons collected the funds due from the buyer of the 15-acre parcel, they were required to report a portion of each payment as a gain on their tax returns, just as they reported a $144 gain on their 1980 return.10   As described above, the Clintons reported no other gains on any of their subsequent returns.  Of course, if the Clintons did not receive payments from the buyer, they would not have been required to report gains on their income tax returns.  If the buyer of the property defaulted, however, the Clintons could have foreclosed on the property and then resold the property to another buyer, but there is no evidence on any of their subsequent tax returns that such action was taken by the Clintons.  In addition, if the buyer defaulted, the Clintons could have taken a $7,194 deduction for their remaining basis in the 15 acres, but there is no evidence of such a deduction on any of the Clintons subsequent tax returns.11   Moreover, if the property was foreclosed upon and not sold, then the Clintons would still own it, but this property is not shown on the Clintons 1991 Federal Election Disclosure form.371
<P>B.<P>1979: The Clintons' Improper Interest Deduction of $2,400 
<P>The $2,400 interest deduction claimed by the Clintons on their 1979 tax return may have been improper under federal income tax law.  On December 7, 1979, Whitewater deposited in its account a check from the Clintons in the amount of $2,900.372  On the books of Whitewater, this check was recorded as $500 for capital and $2,400 as "Loan - Bill Clinton".373  According to its books, Whitewater's first interest payment in the amount of $4,352.63 was made to Citizen's Bank of Flippin on May 5.374  On their 1979 federal income tax return, the Clintons claimed an interest deduction of $11,749 for payments to "Bank and Loan Companies."375  This amount included the Clintons' $2,400 payment to Whitewater.376
<P>Federal income tax law allows a deduction for "all interest paid or accrued within the taxable year on indebtedness,"377 but the burden of proof for establishing the propriety of an interest deduction is on the taxpayer.12   In this case, there is no evidence that the Clintons' $2,400 payment to Whitewater was for interest on indebtedness.  Indeed, the only available evidence, the $2,900 deposit slip and the entries on Whitewater's books, indicates that the $2,400 payment was a loan to the corporation, which the corporation had an obligation to repay, and not an interest payment.  Moreover, Whitewater did not make its first interest payment to a bank until May 5, 1980, almost five months after the Clintons' payment of $2,400 was deposited, and there is no evidence that Whitewater's first interest payment of $4,352.63 included the Clintons $2,400.378
<P>An IRS audit of the Clintons' 1979 income tax return resulted in no changes.  However, there is no evidence that the revenue agent reviewed all of the relevant documents regarding this interest deduction.379  Absent proof that Whitewater's books and records were made available to the revenue agent by the Clintons, the result of the 1979 audit is inconclusive on this issue.  Indeed, it is possible that the revenue agent would have reviewed only a canceled check or bank records, determined that less than the full payment was deducted, and accepted this as sufficient evidence to verify the deduction.
<P>C.<P>1980: The Clintons' Improper Interest Deduction of $9,000
<P>The $9,000 interest deduction claimed by the Clintons on their 1980 tax return may have been improper under federal income tax law.  On August, 23, 1980, Mrs. Clinton wrote a personal check in the amount of $9,000.380  The Clintons' deducted this $9,000 payment on their 1980 federal income tax return as interest paid to "James McDougal."381  A third-party endorsement by Citizens Bank of Flippin, dated September 5, 1980, is on the reverse side of the Clintons' check.382 
<P>Federal income tax law allows a deduction for "all interest paid or accrued within the taxable year on indebtedness,"383 but the burden of proof for establishing the propriety of an interest deduction is on the taxpayer.  In this case, there is no evidence that the Clintons' $9,000 payment was used to pay interest on indebtedness.  Nor is there evidence on the face of this check that it was intended to be used to pay interest.  The payee on the check was left blank, and there is no designation or notation on the check that it was intended to be used to pay interest.384<P>  In addition, the absence of a notation on the check that it was for interest is particularly probative, since Mrs. Clinton made such a notation on the other checks that she wrote to pay interest on the Whitewater debt.  Mrs. Clinton wrote at least four other personal checks to pay interest on Whitewater related debt -- three before and one after the $9,000 check, and, on each of these checks, Mrs. Clinton wrote a notation that the checks were for interest.13   Moreover, the Clintons' checkbook entry designates this check as a "land payment," not an interest payment.385  "Land payment" could refer either to a principal or interest payment.  Since Mrs. Clinton generally noted when a payment was for interest, however, her notation that this check was for a "land payment" would tend to confirm that this payment was for principal, not interest.   
<P>Analyses of the available bank records also indicate that the $9,000 check was used to pay principal, not interest.  A report prepared by Patten, McCarthy & Associates, a Denver accounting firm hired by the 1992 Clinton Presidential Campaign, states:
<P>In our telephone conversation with her [Mrs. Clinton] and you [James Lyons] on March 18, 1992, she reaffirmed that she believed that it was an interest payment. Based on our reconstruction of the probable amortization of the mortgage loan at Citizens Bank & Trust, we believe the $9,000 went to reduce principal.386
The report of Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro is even more conclusive on this point.  It states:
<P>On August 23, 1980, the Clintons paid $9,000 to an unknown payee.  Through a reconstruction of the Citizens Bank mortgage, it has been determined that this payment was applied as principal to the outstanding balance of the Citizens Bank loan.387
Thus, the available evidence indicates that the bank applied the $9,000 to reduce principal, not interest.
<P>According to the report prepared by the President and Mrs. Clinton's counsel, David Kendall, since the Clintons "owed interest to Citizens Bank of Flippin, WDC [Whitewater] or the McDougals, if they intended that their $9,000 check represents the interest, then Mr. and Mrs. Clinton accurately deducted the $9,000 payment as interest."388  However, there is no evidence of any unconditional and legally enforceable indebtedness between the Clintons and Whitewater or Mr. McDougal at the time of this payment.  While an indebtedness did exist between the Clintons and Citizens Bank, Mrs. Clinton's intent that a payment on the note was for interest is not sufficient to support an interest deduction under federal income tax law.
<P>Courts generally will give effect to an arrangement between a creditor and a debtor allocating payments on an indebtedness to principal and/or interest where that arrangement is bona fide and done at arm's length.389  There is no evidence of that such an arrangement existed between Mrs. Clinton and Citizen's Bank.  Nor is there evidence that Mrs. Clinton communicated to the bank or any other party that the payment was for interest.  Absent such an arrangement, payments by a debtor are first allocated to accrued but unpaid interest and then to principal.390
<P>The available evidence indicates that no accrued but unpaid interest was due on the Citizens Bank loan when the Clintons' $9,000 check was endorsed by Citizens Bank on September 5, 1980.  One month earlier, on August 5, 1980, the Citizens Bank note was extended and modified and, at the same time, the Clintons paid Citizens Bank the quarterly interest owing and due of $4,350, which they properly deducted on their 1978 return.391  No principal payment had been made on the loan as of the date of its renewal.392  Just 18 days later, Mrs. Clinton wrote the $9,000 check for "land payment."  The next quarterly interest payment on the note would not have been due until November 5, 1980, two months after Citizens Bank endorsed the Clintons' $9,000 check.
<P>D.<P>1980: The Clintons' Unreported Income of $10,000 from Whitewater payment of the $20,000 Union Bank Note
<P>Whitewater's 1980 payment of a 1978 $20,000 unsecured, personal note of Mr. McDougal and Mr. Clinton may have resulted in $10,000 of income to the Clintons that was not reported on their 1980 federal income tax return.  On June 19, 1978, Mr. McDougal and Mr. Clinton obtained a $20,000 unsecured, personal loan (Loan # 0004197) from Union National Bank of Little Rock.393  The proceeds of this loan were used to make the down payment on the 230 acres of land in Marion County, Arkansas that became Whitewater.394  On December 17, 1979, the Union National Bank note was renewed for 6 months, with a new maturity date of June 16, 1980.395  As of the date of that renewal, the principal of the note remained $20,000.396  On June 10, 1980, Mr. McDougal borrowed $20,000 from the Bank of Cherry Valley in Cherry Valley, Arkansas,397 and deposited those funds in Whitewater's account at the Union National Bank.398  On June 23, 1980, Whitewater disbursed $21,346.29 to Union National Bank, using a corporate check with the notation "For Note # 0004197 Plus interest thru 6/23/80," to pay off the accrued interest and principal owed personally by Mr. McDougal and Mr. Clinton to Union National Bank.399
<P>Section 61 of the Internal Revenue Code states that "gross income means all income from whatever source derived, including . . . income from discharge of indebtedness."400  Courts have ruled that amounts expended by a corporation for an individual taxpayer's benefit would constitute income to the taxpayer.401  Section 108(e)(4)(A) of the Code states that income is realized if debt is discharged or acquired by a related entity.402
<P>The central issue is whether Whitewater's payment to Union National Bank discharged any debt owed by Mr. Clinton.  Mr. McDougal and Mr. Clinton were jointly and severally liable on the Union National Bank note.403  Whitewater's incorporation did not change this, since the Union National Bank note was not transferred to Whitewater.404  Therefore, Whitewater's payment to Union National Bank eliminated Mr. Clinton's obligation to that bank.
<P>However, if Mr. Clinton was an obligor on the Bank of Cherry Valley note, from which Whitewater received the funds to pay Union National Bank, then Whitewater's debt would not have discharged any debt owed by Mr. Clinton.  In this case, the debt simply would have shifted from Union National Bank to the Bank of Cherry Valley.405 14   On the other hand, if Mr. Clinton was not an obligor on the Bank of Cherry Valley note, then Whitewater's payment would have discharged debt owed by Mr. Clinton.  In this case, the Union National Bank debt, on which Mr. Clinton was jointly and severally liable, would have been replaced by the Bank of Cherry Valley debt, on which Mr. Clinton was not liable.  In the latter case, Mr. Clinton would owe the IRS additional taxes on the $10,000 of discharged debt, his share of the Union Bank debt.
<P>Was Mr. Clinton an obligor on the Bank of Cherry Valley note?  Mr. Clinton has stated that "any shift of this $20,000 loan from Union Bank did not affect its character as an acquisition loan, for which my wife and I considered ourselves equally responsible with the McDougals for repayment."406  However, testimony by the Bank of Cherry Valley's former President, Maurice Smith, indicates that the loan was made to Mr. McDougal individually, and most of the bank documents support his testimony.  Indeed, Mr. Smith testified that the bank "just loaned it to Jim McDougal" and that Mr. Clinton did not make payments on the loan.407
<P>Most of the available loan documents indicate that Mr. McDougal was the sole obligor on the Bank of Cherry Valley note.408   Mr. McDougal's name, and not Mr. Clinton's, is typed on each of the documents, and Mr. McDougal signed each of the documents.409  Only one loan document appears to have Mr. Clinton's signature on it, and Mr. Clinton's name is not typed on that document.410  Moreover, that document is dated more than two years after the note was originated.411
<P>E.<P>1982: The Clintons' Unreported Income of $5,691 for Whitewater Payment of Citizens Bank of Jonesboro Note
<P>A 1982 payment by Whitewater of the principal and interest on a $5,000 note between the Citizens Bank of Jonesboro and Mr. Clinton may have resulted in $5,691.20 of income to the Clintons that was not reported on their 1982 federal income tax return.  A May 21, 1981 personal financial statement of the Clintons lists a $5,000 note payable to Citizens Bank of Jonesboro as a liability under the heading "general debt."412  On February 17, 1981, Mr. Clinton wrote a personal check in the amount of $243.82 to Citizens Bank, which had a notation "Interest on Note #585-270."413  On February 22, 1982, Whitewater disbursed a check in the amount of $5,691.20 to Citizens Bank.414  The notation on the check states "Note 585-270,"415 and the Whitewater checkbook entry designates this check as payment of "Note #585-270 - Bill Clinton."416
<P>Section 61 of the Internal Revenue Code states that "gross income means all income from whatever source derived, including . . . [i]ncome from discharge of indebtedness."417  Courts have ruled that amounts expended by a corporation for an individual taxpayer's benefit would constitute income to the taxpayer.418  Whitewater paid Mr. Clinton's note at Citizens Bank of Jonesboro, but Mr. Clinton has stated that "[i]t is possible that it was a WDC-related loan."419  If Mr. Clinton invested the proceeds of this loan in Whitewater and Whitewater then repaid the loan, Mr. Clinton would have received no personal benefit from Whitewater's payment of the note, and, therefore, would not have been required to recognize income from discharge of indebtedness.
<P>The evidence is inconclusive on whether this Citizens Bank of Jonesboro loan was related to Whitewater.  A March 1, 1982 letter from Jim McDougal to Bill Clinton states:
<P>I have paid from the Whitewater Development Corporation the note you owed Citizens Bank of Jonesboro.  You are correct in your belief that the sum of money borrowed was part of your investment in Whitewater. 420   
<P><P>
Yet, there is no evidence on Whitewater's books that it received $5,000 from either the Clintons or Citizens Bank of Jonesboro.421 15   Indeed, when Whitewater disbursed $5,691 to Citizens Bank of Jonesboro, it recorded the full amount as "interest" paid, which indicates that the corporation had never recorded a liability that could be reduced upon payment of the note.422
<P>Although the evidence is inconclusive on whether these funds were invested in Whitewater, under federal income tax law the Clintons would bear the burden of proof that this payment did not result in any benefit to them personally.  It is unclear whether the March 1, 1982 McDougal letter would be considered sufficient proof that the Clintons invested the funds received from the Citizens Bank of Jonesboro in Whitewater.  If found insufficient, the Clintons would have unreported income of $5,691.20, excluding any interest and penalties.
<P>F.<P>1984: The Clintons' Improper Deduction of $144 for Real Estate Taxes
<P>On their 1984 federal income tax return, the Clintons improperly deducted $144 for real estate tax payments for which they were reimbursed by Whitewater.  On October 10, 1984, the Clintons paid $144 to Marion County for the payment of real estate taxes on Whitewater lot 13.  On November 4, 1984, Whitewater reimbursed the Clintons for this amount.423  Since the Clintons were reimbursement for the taxes paid, this deduction was improper.  On May 24, 1996, the Clintons acknowledged this error and repaid the federal taxes owed to the Bureau of Public Debt and the state taxes owed to an Arkansas charity.424
<P>G.<P>1984 and 1985: The Clintons' Improper Interest Deductions of $2,811 and $2,322

<P>On their 1984 and 1985 federal income tax returns, the Clintons improperly deducted $5,133 for interest payments made paid by Whitewater, not the Clintons.425  In 1984 and 1985, Whitewater made interest payments to the Security Bank of Paragould in the amounts of $2,811 and $2,322, respectively, that the corporation deducted on its corporate tax returns.426  The Clintons also claimed these same interest deductions on their 1984 and 1985 federal income tax returns.427  Since Whitewater made the interest payments to the bank, it, and not the Clintons, was entitled to those deductions.  On December 28, 1993, almost two years after the errors were first reported, the Clintons repaid the taxes owed due to these errors.428  The Clintons did not explain the delay.429  
<P>H.<P>1987: The Clintons' Improper Interest Deduction of $2,561
<P>On their 1987 federal income tax return, the Clintons improperly deducted $1,636 for interest which they also deducted on their 1986 federal income tax return.  On December 30, 1986, Mrs. Clinton wrote a check in the amount of $1,635.51 to Security Bank of Paragould.430  On their 1986 federal income tax return, the Clintons deducted $1,636 for interest paid to "Security Bank."431  In 1987, Security Bank of Paragould sent the Clintons a statement of interest paid on their loan during 1987, which listed interest paid of $2,561.33.432 On their 1987 federal income tax return, the Clintons deducted $2,561 in interest paid to "Security Bank.433
<P>The $2,561 of interest deducted on the Clintons' 1987 tax return improperly included the $1,635.51 payment made by the Clintons in 1986 and deducted on their 1986 tax return.  The $925 balance of this amount ($2,561 - $1,636) was also improperly deducted by the Clintons on their 1987 tax return.  This interest was paid by Hillman Logan, the owner of Whitewater lot 13.  On May 24, 1996, the Clintons acknowledged these errors and repaid the federal taxes owed to the Bureau of Public Debt and state taxes owed to an Arkansas charity.434
<P>Documents show that the Mrs Clinton may have discussed this error with her personal accountant, Yoly Redden, and Loretta Lynch on March 23, 1992 -- almost four years before the Clintons acknowledged the error. Notes taken by Ms. Redden of a March 23, 1992 telephone conversation between herself, Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Lynch state:
<P>Clinton Campaign - Issue discussed with HC & Loretta Lynch
<P>1987<P>$2,651 deducted per return to Security Bank of Paragould. [found canceled check from Clintons dated 12/30/86 check # 1623 for 1635.51.]
<P>1986<P>1,636 paid [an arrow in Ms. Redden's notes points from this entry to the 1987 entry]435
Ms. Redden testified that in this conversation she had discussed with Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Lynch whether or not certain deductions had been "double-counted" on the Clintons' 1986 and 1987 federal income tax returns and that this issue had been discussed even prior to this conversation.436
<P>I.<P>1988: The Clintons' Improper Deduction of $1,275 for Real Estate Taxes

<P>The $1,275 real estate tax deduction claimed by the Clintons on their 1988 tax return may have been improper under federal income tax law.  On October 28, 1988, Mrs. Clinton reimbursed Ozark Realty $1,275.15 for real estate taxes due on several Whitewater lots.437  On their 1988 federal income tax return the Clintons deducted $1,275 as real estate taxes.438  Generally, only the owner of real property is entitled to deduct real property taxes on the property, since those taxes are the liability of the owner under federal income tax law.439  Since the Clintons did not own the property on which the taxes were assessed, they were not entitled to a deduction for the payment of those real estate taxes.  A taxpayer who owns a beneficial interest in property and who pays taxes thereon to protect that interest may deduct the taxes, even though legal title is in another.440  Beneficial interest is narrowly defined, however, and does not appear to the Clintons interest, if any, in the lots on which these real estate property taxes were assessed.  Therefore, the Clintons' $1,275 payment to Ozark Realty for real estate taxes may not be an allowable deduction.
<P>J.<P>1988: The Clintons' Unreported Income of $1,673 from the Sale of Lot 13

<P>On May 24, 1996, the Clintons acknowledged that they under-reported the capital gain from the sale of a Whitewater lot owned by Mrs. Clinton by $1,673 on their 1988 federal income tax return.441  On that return, the Clintons reported a $1,640 long-term capital gain from the sale of lot 13.442  In computing the capital gain from this sale, the Clintons included in their basis calculation payments made by the previous owner of the lot.443  As a result, the cost of the property was artificially inflated by $1,673, reducing the gain reported by the Clintons by this same amount on their 1988 tax return.  The have repaid the federal taxes owed to the Bureau of Public Debt and the state taxes owed to an Arkansas charity.444

<H3>Part II. GOVERNOR CLINTON'S QUESTIONABLE RELATIONSHIP WITH JAMES MCDOUGAL</H3>

<P>While Mr. McDougal was carrying the Clintons share on the Whitewater loans, Governor Clinton, using the power of his political office, acted favorably on Mr. McDougal's other business ventures and accepted Mr. McDougal's recommendations regarding state action.  These favors took the form of granting Mr. McDougal influence in appointments to state positions445, steering lucrative state leases to Madison Guaranty446, and making decisions for Mr. McDougal concerning state regulators.447  This pattern of favoritism was important to Mr. McDougal, whose thrift was experiencing serious financial trouble. 
<P>The motive for this favoritism is clear.  From the standpoint of Governor Clinton, if Madison Guaranty failed or Mr. McDougal experienced financial troubles, the Clintons could be liable for the full Whitewater debt.  Thus, Governor Clinton had a reason to act to ensure the viability of Mr. McDougal's savings & loan, even if such action was adverse to the interests of the state.
I.<P>James McDougal's Madison Guaranty: A Corrupt Savings & Loan
<P>In January 1982, James and Susan McDougal, along with several others, purchased 90% of the stock of the Woodruff County Savings & Loan Association for $246,500, which they renamed Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan Association ("Madison Guaranty").448  To finance the purchase of Madison Guaranty, the McDougals borrowed $70,000 from Worthen Bank. Mr. McDougal inaccurately indicated on the change of control applications that he had obtained the money through "funds received from closely held corporations." 449 In June 1983, the McDougals borrowed another $142,186 from Worthen Bank to acquire stock belonging to other investors in Madison Guaranty in order to acquire exclusive control over the S&L.450
<P>Mr. McDougal's true interest was always real estate investments, and his control of Madison Guaranty allowed him to pursue such investments.  On the other hand, Madison Bank & Trust, Mr. McDougal's other federal institution, was prohibited from such investments.451  In early 1982, Mr. McDougal incorporated Madison Financial Corporation as a subsidiary of Madison Guaranty for the sole purpose of real estate investment.452
<P>From the beginning, Mr. McDougal viewed Madison Guaranty as a personal "candy store."453  Soon after its purchase Mr. McDougal began to borrow personally from Madison Guaranty to pay down other loans including financing Whitewater.454  
<P> In 1984, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board ("FHLBB") examined Madison Guaranty and concluded that "[t]he viability of the institution is jeopardized through the institution's current investment and lending practices in real estate development projects."  The FHLBB attempted to force Madison, through a cease and desist order and a supervisory agreement, to stop lending money to the McDougals or any McDougal-controlled entity, and require Madison Guaranty to raise additional capital.
<P>Shortly thereafter, Mr. McDougal hired Mrs. Clinton and the Rose Law Firm to represent Madison Guaranty and then-Governor Clinton appointed Beverly Bassett Schaffer to the position of Arkansas Securities Commissioner, based possibly on Mr. McDougal's recommendation.  Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Schaffer discussed -- and Ms. Schaffer approved -- a novel proposal for Madison Guaranty to raise capital through the issuance of preferred stock.  Ms. Clinton and the Rose Law Firm also represented Madison Guaranty in connection with land transactions and real estate investments, notably Castle Grande.
<P>  Beginning in March 1986, the FHLBB again examined Madison Guaranty.455  James Clark, the examiner-in-charge, testified that the examiner discovered "a group of insiders was obtaining cash in what amounted to a pyramid scheme" led by the principal insider, James McDougal.456
<P>Mr. Clark testified that in his 20 years as a bank examiner, Madison Guaranty was on of the top five worst financial institutions that he examined in terms of self dealing by insiders.457  The 1986 examination report concluded that "management blatantly disregarded numerous regulations," "ignored" parts of the Supervisory Agreement.458  Moreover the report stated that Mr. McDougal's effective control of Madison Guaranty "enabled [him] to use corporate resources to develop large land developments [and] to divert substantial amounts of funds from the projects to himself and others."459  The examiners cited Campobello, Maple Creek, and Castle Grande as problematic projects.460  Although Madison Guaranty's financial statements indicated that the institution was in the black, the FHLBB report noted that improper accounting appeared to be the source of the profit, not successful investing. The report stated that, "[i]f profits [of the real estate projects] were booked properly, the Institution would be, in fact, insolvent."461
<P>A.<P>Madison's Fraudulent Land Deals<P>
<P>Examiner Clark testified that Mr. McDougal "had total control of Madison Guaranty funds" and that Mr. McDougal could "dispense those funds at any time he wished, and he did so through the land development projects."462  The 1986 federal examination uncovered several instances where Madison Guaranty insiders engaged in "sham transactions" or acted as a "straw man," an arrangement whereby the "purchaser of the property would obtain legal title to a property without having any actual financial interest in the property simply as a means to hide true ownership of the property."463   The sham transactions were used as a means to place phony profit on the books in attempt to falsely inflate net worth.464
<P>  
<P>For example, the 1986 examination found that the Castle Grande project was "purchased and sold in a series of fictitious transactions" to straw buyers.465  At the recently concluded McDougal-Tucker trial, Don Denton, chief lending officer of Madison, testified that Seth Ward was a "nominee" buyer in the purchase of part of the land.466  These transactions were structured in this way to enable Madison Guaranty to violate the Arkansas state regulation prohibiting Madison Guaranty from investing more than 6% of its assets into Madison Financial Corporation.467
<P>Bank examiners also found that Madison Guaranty insiders obtained financing for real estate projects that were fully funded by Madison Guaranty.468  In addition, insiders received real estate commissions that they did not earn.469   
<P>B.<P>Madison's Phony Books and Records  
<P>The 1984 examination of Madison Guaranty had concluded that the books and records were "inadequate."470  The books and records at Madison Guaranty were "poor, missing, and in some cases, intentionally misleading."471  The loan files did not sufficiently document the disbursements of the loan proceeds.472<P>  Mr. Denton testified that prior to the arrival of the examiners in March 1986, the staff of Madison Guaranty went through the loan files to find out what was missing, back dated documents, and had phony appraisals prepared.473  Robert Palmer, a Madison appraiser, confirmed that he prepared several inflated appraisals for Madison Guaranty and backdated several appraisals.474  Moreover, Mr. Clark testified that the appraisals were "wholly inadequate" and "the reports seemed to us to be essentially shams, some documents to put into the loan file."475
<P>The 1986 FHLBB examination of Madison Guaranty lasted from March through September of 1986, as opposed to the three to four weeks that it would normally take for an S&L that size, because "Madison Guaranty's problems were so severe and its records were so poor."476  Moreover, Madison Guaranty's management actively obstructed the examination by retaining needed loan files or withholding information.477  
<P>  C.<P>Federal Regulators Oust Mr. McDougal from Madison 
<P>On June 19, 1986, Walter Faulk, the FHLBB's Supervisory Agent responsible for Madison Guaranty, issued the preliminary report of the examination.478  This report was so devastating that the Arkansas Securities Commissioner Beverly Bassett Schaffer believed it "effectively put Madison out of business."479<P>  
<P>Curiously, on July 2, 1986, Ms. Schaffer forwarded a letter which Mr. Faulk had sent to Madison Guaranty, to Samuel Bratton, then Counsel to Governor Clinton, with a personal note attached.  The note stated, "Madison Guaranty is in pretty serious trouble.  Because of Bill's relationship with McDougal we probably ought to talk about it."480  Mr. Bratton, who had already spoken with Governor Clinton several times about Madison Guaranty's financial difficulties, was well aware of the Governor's personal ties to Mr. McDougal.481  After Mr. Bratton received the note, he spoke with Ms. Schaffer about the possible closure of Madison Guaranty by the FHLBB,482 and the upcoming FHLBB meeting in Dallas on July 24 where Madison's financial problems would be discussed.483  After Mr. Bratton received Ms. Schaffer's memorandum he contacted Governor Clinton, telling him of the FHLBB's plans.484  Mr. Bratton also went to see Betsey Wright, the Governor's Chief of Staff, and they "together carried this to the Governor rather than my sending it in his normal mail."485  
<P>Although the exact date of Governor Clinton's receipt of the copy of the FHLBB's letter is unknown, he certainly received it before July 14, 1986.486  It is clear that Governor Clinton knew that Mr. McDougal -- his business partner, friend, and client of his wife's law firm -- was in serious financial trouble before it was ever made public.
<P>Results of an examination by the FHLBB are to be kept confidential, and "[t]he law requires that release of an exam report be restricted."487  Bank regulators should not share the results of exams with anyone outside of the regulatory agency.   James Clark, the FHLBB examiner, could not think of one reason why it would be appropriate for a state bank regulator to tip off the governor's office with regard to an ongoing bank examination.488  Moreover, Mr. Clark testified that, given Governor Clinton's business relationship with Mr. McDougal, the "tip off" from Ms. Schaffer certainly "had the appearance of a conflict."489 
<P>On July 11, 1986 the Federal Home Loan Bank Board met to discuss Madison.  Ms. Schaffer, her associate Charles Handley, nine persons from the FHLBB, and the Madison Board of Directors were all present.490   Mr. and Mrs. McDougal were not present.491  Mr. Clark expressed some concerns about Ms. Schaffer's presence at the FHLBB meeting because she had performed legal work for Madison Guaranty when she was in private practice, and he viewed that as a conflict with her oversight capacity as the Arkansas Securities Commissioner.492
<P>During the meeting, Dawn Pulcer of the FHLBB mentioned that she thought Ms. Schaffer's conduct during the meeting was peculiar.  Ms. Pulcer's contemporaneous notes of the meeting reflect that during the course of discussion at the FHLBB meeting Ms. Schaffer appeared to be frowning, and asked only one question: "[w]ho is representing the McDougals?"493  Ms. Pulcer stated that she "[t]hought it was a little odd.  I, too, would have expected her to say something in support of the actions that the Federal Home Loan Bank Board supervisory authorities were taking."494
<P>At this meeting, FHLBB determined that Mr. McDougal and Mr. Latham should be removed from Madison.  On July 14, 1986, just three days after this meeting, Ms. Wright wrote a telling message to Governor Clinton that reads:
<P>          White Water stock<BR>
          (McDougal's company)<BR></P>

<P>          Do you still have? (pursuant<BR>
          to Jim's current problems<BR>
                             </P> 
<P>          If so, I'm worried about<BR>
          it.495<BR></P>


Governor Clinton responded by writing "No-Do not have any more---B."496  Ms. Wright claimed it was then well known that Mr. McDougal had been removed from the bank.  But the local newspaper did not report the event until July 25, 1996, eleven days later.497  
<P>Curiously, on the very same day that Ms. Wright inquired about Governor Clinton's relationship with Mr. McDougal, Mrs. Clinton wrote a letter to Mr. McDougal and Mr. Latham terminating the Rose Law Firm's retainer agreement with Madison Guaranty.498  Along with the letter, Mrs. Clinton sent a check from the Rose Law Firm refunding Madison Guaranty's outstanding retainer balance.499    
<P>Mrs. Clinton has given at least two different accounts regarding why she terminated the Rose Law Firm's representation of Madison Guaranty.500  In a press conference on April 22, 1994, Mrs. Clinton said that the Rose Law Firm's relationship with Madison Guaranty was terminated because Madison Guaranty could not meet the requirements imposed by Ms. Schaffer for the issuance of preferred stock.501  However, in response to interrogatories on February 4, 1994, Mrs. Clinton said that the representation of Madison Guaranty was terminated due to "the increasing work the Rose Law Firm was doing for FSLIC ... the firm had decided in early July, 1986, generally to avoid taking on any new or expanded representations of S&L's."502  In Mrs. Clinton's February 14, 1996 interview with the FDIC, Mrs. Clinton stated that the letter to Madison Guaranty was written in direct response to a memorandum written by Herb Rule, then the managing partner of the Rose Law Firm, to all attorneys.503  
II.<P>Governor Clinton Provides Benefits to James McDougal and Madison S&L

<P>During the time when Mr. McDougal was running Madison Guaranty and carrying the Clintons on the Whitewater investment, Governor Clinton acted favorably on Mr. McDougal's various proposals before the state.  Indeed, substantial evidence supports Mr. McDougal's claims that he had "clout" with the Governor.504   
<P>A.<P>Governor Clinton Steers Valuable State Leases to Madison

<P>Governor Clinton exercised the power of his office to steer two lucrative lease contracts to Madison Guaranty.505  Helen Herr, the former Leasing Administrator for Arkansas State Building Services ("ASBS"), testified that she first learned in January or February 1984 that Madison Guaranty was interested in leasing space to Arkansas Housing Development Agency ("AHDA") during a meeting in the office of Paul Mallard.506  Mr. Mallard, the Director of ASBS called Ms. Herr into his office to meet Susan McDougal. Mr. Mallard told Ms. Herr that the McDougals were developing a building on South Main Street in Little Rock, in Quapaw Quarter, and that they had additional office space that they wanted to rent.507  This office space was difficult to lease because it was located in an unsafe part of Little Rock and the real estate market in Little Rock was soft. Many commercial landlords were eager to fill their office space with long term tenants.508
<P>In fall 1983, AHDA developed a need for additional office space.  ASBS was considering office space on Brookwood Drive that the Director of AHDA, Wooten Epes, felt would be suitable.509  After meeting with Mrs. McDougal, Mr. Mallard instructed Ms. Herr to examine the Madison office space.510  
<P>When Mr. Epes, AHSA's Director, complained to Ms. Herr about the Madison space, she recommended that he state his complaints in writing.  On March 5, 1984, Mr. Epes wrote a letter to Ms. Herr rejecting the proposal that AHDA lease the office space from Madison.511  Mr. Epes was concerned that the Madison space was not sufficiently large and was not located in a safe part of Little Rock.512  When Ms. Herr brought Mr. Epes' letter to Mr. Mallard's attention, Mr. Mallard told her that the leasing contract was going to Madison Guaranty because the McDougals were "friends" of the Governor.513  Ms. Herr specifically testified: "When I presented the objections from Mr. Epes about the Madison space, [Mallard] said that the governor's office wants us to lease that space ... and that the McDougals were friends" of Governor and Mrs. Clinton.514  Mr. Mallard also told her that "they weren't going to consider other proposals" because the "governor's office wants us to lease this space and that's the way it's going to be."515  Mr. Epes took his concerns to the Governor.516  Mr. Epes testified that Governor Clinton refused to overrule Mr. Mallard's decision, and that was the Governor's final word.517
<P>On April 1, 1984, the AHDA entered into a lease with Madison Guaranty.518  The lease was for a 60-month term at $4,800 per month.519  The contract realized nearly $300,000 in payments to Madison.520 
<P>In 1985 AHDA became the Arkansas Development Finance Authority ("ADFA").521  ADFA subsequently sought to lease additional office space for their new employees.522  As a result of this change, ADFA entered into another contract with Madison.523  In August 1987, however, ADFA canceled its lease with Madison because it needed still more space, which was the concern that Mr. Epes had from the beginning.524
<P>Moreover, the State of Arkansas, through ASBS, leased space in an additional building from Mr. McDougal, in Quapaw Quarter, to house the Arkansas Revenue Department.525  Other than the three leases entered into with McDougal-owned entities, Ms. Herr could not recall any other leases the state entered for office space in the lease in Quapaw Quarter.526
<P>Don Denton, a Madison loan officer, believed that the state leases were a political payback by Governor Clinton to the McDougals.  Mr. Denton testified that the connection "[s]tood out like a beacon at night."527<P>
<P>B.<P>McDougal Holds a Questionable 1985 Fundraiser for Clinton
 
<P>On April 4, 1985, James McDougal hosted a fundraiser for Governor Clinton at Madison Guaranty to raise money to pay off the Governor's outstanding personal debt from his 1984 gubernatorial campaign.528  In the closing days of that race, Governor Clinton had obtained an unsecured personal loan in the amount of $50,000 from the Bank of Cherry Valley. 529  
<P>The exact amount of money raised at the event is not known.  The campaign finance report listing the contributions received at the fundraiser is missing from the Pulaski County Clerk's office and has never been located.  By all accounts, however, the fundraiser netted more than $30,000 to pay off Governor Clinton's personal debt.16 
<P>Four $3,000 checks were collected at the fundraiser.530  The names on the checks were James B. and Susan McDougal, J.W. Fulbright, Ken Peacock, and Dean Landrum.531  J.W. Fulbright is the late former Senator.  Ken Peacock is the son of former Madison director and borrower Charles Peacock.532  Dene Landrum, who is now deceased, was Mr Peacock's business associate.533   His first name was misspelled on the check as "Dean."534
<P>All four checks were dated April 4, 1985.535  The James McDougal check was written on the McDougal's personal checking account at Madison Guaranty and was signed by Susan McDougal.536  The Fulbright, Peacock, and Landrum checks were Madison Guaranty cashier's checks bearing numbers 2496, 2497, and 2498, respectively.537  
<P>There is strong evidence suggesting that the $3,000 check in Senator Fulbright's name was purchased by Mr. McDougal out of funds from his Flowerwood Farms account.  Senator Fulbright did not attend the fundraiser, although he was expected to.538  In 1994, Kent Goss, an RTC investigator, questioned Senator Fulbright's lawyer, a former aide to the Senator, about the $3,000 check.539 17   Mr. Goss wrote that although it was "evident" that Senator Fulbright was "a meticulous record-keeper," there was no record of any charitable donation in the amount of $3,000 between 1984 and 1991.540  Nor did Senator Fulbright's bank statements reflect a $3,000 debit during the relevant time.541  Senator Fulbright's lawyer added that he believed that the Senator had "no knowledge" of a $3,000 contribution to Governor Clinton.542 
<P>The Pillsbury Madison & Sutro Report on Madison Guaranty and Whitewater commissioned by the Resolution Trust Corporation attempted to trace the source of funds of the Fulbright check.543  According to this report, on April 4, 1985, the same day that the Fulbright check was issued, a $3,000 check payable to Madison Guaranty was written on Flowerwood Farms' account at Madison Guaranty.544  The Flowerwood Farms check was apparently deposited in the Madison cashier's check account, as it was encoded with "7001312" -- the number of that account.545  A $3,000 deposit was posted in the account 7001312 on April 4, 1985.546
<P>Despite this evidence, the Pillsbury Report erroneously concluded that the link between the Flowerwood Farms check and the Fulbright check "has not been conclusively confirmed" because Madison Guaranty issued two other cashier's checks for $3,000 on April 4, 1985, i.e., those in the names of Ken Peacock and Dean Landrum.547  However, Charles Peacock, an attendee and donor at the fundraiser, has admitted to purchasing those two checks.548  The Pillsbury report recognized: "[I]f the Ken Peacock and Dene Landrum cashier's checks were funded by Charles Peacock III, the Flowerwood Farms check could have funded the remaining $3,000 cashier's check, the one from Fulbright."549
<P>Mr. Peacock's testimony establishes, and the documentary evidence confirms, that he caused the checks to be issued.  Mr. Peacock admitted that he purchased the $3,000 checks in the names of his son and Dene Landrum.550  Mr. Peacock said he bought the check in his son's name because he thought it might help his son secure a job with Governor Clinton.551  He testified that he bought the check in Mr. Landrum's name because Mr. Landrum wanted to help the child of a friend receive a scholarship awarded by Governor Clinton.552  
<P>The documentary evidence is consistent with Mr. Peacock's admission that he procured the checks.  On April 4, 1985, Mr. Peacock wrote a $6,000 counter check payable to Madison Guaranty, apparently on his account #15253.553  The check was encoded with "7001312" -- the number of the Madison cashier's checking account.  That same day, Mr. Peacock purchased a cashier's check for $4.554  Madison Guaranty charged a $2 fee for cashier's checks.555  When asked whether he bought this cashier's check to pay the $4 fee on the two $3,000 checks, Mr. Peacock said, "I'm sure that's what happened."556  It seems clear that since Mr. Peacock purchased two of the $3,000 cashiers checks, the third $3,000 check was purchased with proceeds from Flowerwood Farms.
<P>There is evidence that Mr. Peacock purchased the Ken Peacock and Dean Landrum checks with proceeds diverted from loans made by Madison Guaranty.  
<P>On the day of the fundraiser, April 4, 1985, Dixie Continental Leasing, a company owned by Mr. Peacock, purchased 29.77 acres of land on Woodson Lateral Road for $335,000.557  Most of the sale was financed by Madison Guaranty with a $297,000 mortgage.558  Mr. Peacock borrowed an additional $50,000 from Madison Guaranty in his own name to fund the down payment on the property.559  The loan was executed on April 5, 1985, but was funded on April 4, 1985, with a $50,000 Madison Guaranty check payable to Mr. Peacock.560  The loan was secured by commercial air conditioning equipment appraised at $273,000 but ultimately sold as scrap by Madison Guaranty for $1,500.561
<P>On April 5, 1985, Mr. Peacock wrote a check for $38,940 to Quapaw Title Co. to pay the down payment on the Woodson Lateral Road property.562  The check was deposited in Madison Guaranty.563  There is no documentary evidence indicating what happened to the remaining $11,060.  Mr. Peacock does not remember how the remaining $11,060, a sum sufficient to fund the checks to Governor Clinton, was spent.564  Moreover, he does not recall what funds he used to pay for the cashier's checks:  "I don't remember how I paid for them, whether I paid for them with a check or whether I paid for them out of funds or what I did."565
<P>The Pillsbury Report concludes that the source of funds for Mr. Ken Peacock's and Mr. Landrum's checks "cannot be established from the available documentation,"566 because Mr. Peacock's April 1985 Madison Guaranty bank statement is missing.567  Thus, it is not possible to ascertain what Mr. Peacock's balance was when he wrote the $6,000 check to Madison Guaranty, or what it would have been absent the infusion of an extra $11,060.568  Nevertheless, the Pillsbury Report does indicate that "it is possible that a portion of this $11,060 could have been used to reimburse Charles Peacock III for the campaign contributions he funded that were made in the names of Ken Peacock and Dene Landrum."569
<P>In spring 1987, after Mr. McDougal was ousted from Madison Guaranty, the S&L filed several suits against Mr. Peacock, other members of his family, and related entities to recover on unpaid loans.570  On March 12, 1987, Madison Guaranty filed suit against Dixie Continental Leasing to recover on the loan executed on the day of the fundraiser.571  On April 1, 1987, Madison Guaranty filed four additional suits against the Peacocks and their companies.572  In all, Madison Guaranty sought to recover approximately $500,000 from the Peacocks with these suits.573
<P>Madison Guaranty was represented in these actions by Lance Miller of the law firm of Mitchell, Williams, Selig & Tucker ("Tucker Firm").574  Patricia Heritage, a Madison Guaranty collections officer, was the Madison Guaranty liaison to the Mitchell Williams attorneys with respect to these cases.575
<P>On April 21, 1987, Greg Hopkins, Mr. Peacock's attorney, visited Ms. Heritage in her office.576  Ms. Heritage testified that Mr. Hopkins was obviously angry and made certain allegations to her involving, the Dixie Continental loan, Mr. McDougal, and the Clinton campaign.577  Immediately after Mr. Hopkins left, Ms. Heritage called Mr. Miller to relate Mr. Hopkins' allegations.578  
<P>Mr. Miller took contemporaneous notes of his conversation with Ms. Heritage,579 which he then memorialized in a three-page memorandum, addressed to John Selig, the partner on the matter.580  Ms. Heritage confirmed that Mr. Miller's memorandum accurately reflects what Mr. Hopkins said to her.581
<P>Mr. Miller's memorandum reflects that Mr. Hopkins claimed that there had been "substantial wrongdoing" at Madison Guaranty as a result of which people were "going to go to prison."582  Mr. Hopkins also made the serious allegation that "a portion of the loan proceeds made to Dixie Continental Leasing went to Bill Clinton's campaign and that in return for the substantial campaign contribution, Bill Clinton assured Jim McDougal that a state agency would lease space from Madison Guaranty at its headquarters on Main Street in Little Rock."583  
<P>There is every reason to believe that Mr. Hopkins actually made the serious and troubling allegations attributed to him, and that Mr. Miller's memo accurately reflects what Mr. Hopkins.   Ms. Heritage's memory of the conversation is vivid.584  Indeed, Ms. Heritage testified that Mr. Hopkins "was angry and shouting" at her, and that "that's the sort of thing that would stick out" in her mind.585 
<P>It appears that Mr. Hopkins did not make these allegations out of whole cloth.  Ms. Heritage testified that, with respect to the allegations about campaign contributions to Governor Clinton, she "thought it was entirely possible that it was true."586  She thought Mr. Hopkins may have been "posturing," but not lying.587
<P>Although Mr. Hopkins did not recall speaking with Ms. Heritage in April 1987 or making allegations, he did not dispute that he may have done so and has no reason to doubt Ms. Heritage's recollection.588  
<P>Mr. Hopkins testified that he could not think of a "conceivable reason for making up an allegation about the Governor and Jim McDougal exchanging money for favors."589  He also testified that "it was not [his] habit to lie or make up baseless allegations."590  He acknowledged that the allegations about Governor Clinton are serious and not the sort of thing that he would say without a basis for doing so.591  Mr. Hopkins admitted that he "probably had suspicions."592
<P>Moreover, Mr. Hopkins was likely in a position to learn about the diversion of loan proceeds to Governor Clinton and Madison Guaranty's award of a lease contract through his representation of Mr. Peacock, who owned Dixie Continental and was a Madison director.  However, Mr. Hopkins, invoked the attorney-client privilege and refused to answer questions about what Mr. Peacock has told him.593  
<P>If Mr. Hopkins did make the statements attributed to him, and they were false, he would be in violation of an Arkansas ethical rule.594  The Rule states: "In the course of representing a client a lawyer shall not knowingly . . . make a false statement of material fact or law to a third person."
<P>The memorandum written by Mr. Miller reflects that Mr. Hopkins said that "in return for the substantial campaign contribution, Bill Clinton assured McDougal that a state agency would lease space from Madison Guaranty at its headquarters on Main Street in Little Rock."595  Indeed, on August 13, 1985, the State of Arkansas awarded a contract to expand the Madison lease office space in its Main Street office to the Arkansas Development Finance Authority (ADFA).596  Governor Clinton had previously used his influence to steer an ADFA lease contract to Madison Guaranty.597 
<P>C.<P>Governor Clinton Vetoes Legislation For McDougal Business Partners
<P>The 1985 McDougal fundraiser appears to have been used as leverage to secure action by Governor Clinton on proposed state legislation. On February 14, 1986, Castle Sewer & Water Company -- an entity owned by Jim Guy Tucker and R.D. Randolph -- entered an agreement to purchase the sewer and water system at Castle Grande for $1.2 million.598  On July 15, 1986, following Mr. McDougal's removal from the Madison Guaranty, there was a special meeting of its Board of Directors.599  At the meeting, Mr. Tucker explained to the board that he had an old agreement with Mr. McDougal for 110 utility hook-ups per year and that, although the utility company was not a registered public utility under Arkansas Law, it was not a problem.  
<P>Mr. Tucker raised a number of issues in the July 15, 1986 meeting.  Some of the concerns voiced by Mr. Tucker brought into question the validity of legal work performed by Hillary Clinton and the Rose Law Firm.<P>  
<P>Mrs. Clinton supervised Rose Law Firm associate Rick Donovan's analysis on the need for Castle Sewer and Water to register as a public utility with the Arkansas Public Service Commission.600  The memorandum concluded that the cost of becoming a "public utility" -- and thus being regulated by the Public Service Commission -- would be greater than the risk of being reported by a resident to the Public Service Commission.601  Such a citizen report would simply require the payment of a civil fine.602  Mrs. Clinton, after reviewing various memoranda and billing records, recalled that she supervised Mr. Donovan on certain "questions relating to the provisions of water and sewer service by a utility which was located within IDC property."603  
<P>It is not clear exactly what work was performed by the Rose Law Firm on the utility issues related to Castle Grande because Mrs. Clinton ordered those client records destroyed in July 1988.604  But, the work performed by Mrs. Clinton clearly became an issue when Mr. Tucker threatened to sue Madison Guaranty, which was under then the "close scrutiny of FSLIC"605, for recision.606  
<P>The sale of the sewer and water system occurred on February 28, 1986.607  Yet, the Rose Law Firm continued to do work on utility related issues and continued to bill Madison Guaranty.608  Six days after the final transfer of the Industrial Service Corporation stock to Castle Sewer, Mr. Donovan wrote a memorandum on whether "Madison Guaranty/IDC" can provide services to customers inside Little Rock's city limits.609  Mr. Donovan could not explain why he was preparing a legal memorandum for a client who had sold the utility a week earlier.610  
<P>The Rose Law Firm charged Madison Guaranty thousands of dollars for work on utility issues.611  There may have been work performed on utility issues in January 1986, the bill which reflected 14.5 hours of unaccounted billing by Mrs. Clinton for Madison.612  
<P>Two years later, the utility work performed by the Rose Law Firm became an issue when Mr. Tucker threatened to sue Madison Guaranty for recision of contract, based on the fact that "a utility, subject to regulation by the Public Service Commission, is prohibited from mortgaging utility property without permission of the Public Service Commission."613  This threat would have directly called into question the legal work performed by the First Lady and the Rose Law Firm.
<P>Mr. Tucker refused to rescind his purchase contract for Industrial Services Corporation unless legislation was enacted barring the Public Service Commission from regulating Castle Sewer and Water's rates.614  On February 24, 1987, Mr. Tucker wrote a memorandum to Representative Mike Wilson outlining a proposed bill, a copy of which was attached to the memorandum.615  This proposal, House Bill 1780, passed both houses of the State legislature without a single dissenting vote.616  
<P>Governor Clinton, however, vetoed the bill. According to the Governor's Chief Counsel, Samuel Bratton, Governor Clinton vetoed the bill because it was local and specific and this violated the Arkansas constitution.617  Prior to the veto, the Governor was not aware that the legislation was designed to help Madison Financial, Mr. Tucker, Mr. Randolph, and tangentially The Rose Law Firm and Mrs. Clinton.618
<P>In early April 1987, Mr. Randolph spoke with Mr. Bratton about a way to reverse the Governor's the veto of House Bill 1780.619  Unable to resolve the matter, Mr. Randolph went to see the Governor.620  
<P>On April 14, 1987, because the Governor was unavailable, Mr. Randolph left a message with621 Nancy Hernreich, the Governor's scheduler.622  The message indicated that Mr. Randolph had spoken with the Governor the previous Sunday, and that he wanted to know if the water bill veto was going to stand.623  Mr. Randolph advised Ms. Hernreich that the Governor should call Mr. Tucker about the legislation.  Ms. Hernreich's message indicates that Mr. Randolph "mentioned a meeting between you [Governor Clinton], Tucker, and Jim McDougal a couple of years ago which involved $33,000."624  
<P> The evidence indicates that Mr. Randolph was referring to the April 4, 1985 fundraiser at Madison Guaranty.  This "meeting" involving $33,000 appears to be the 1985 fundraiser.  Mr. Randolph, Mr. Tucker and Mr. McDougal contributed at the April 5, 1985 fundraiser,625 which was almost exactly "a couple of years" before Mr. Randolph's visit to the mansion.  Also, $33,000 is approximately what was raised at the event.  
<P>Ms. Wright, Governor Clinton's Chief of Staff, read the memorandum, and wrote, "see if Sam Bratton will call him."626  The Governor wrote "ugh" in response.
<P>Mr. Tucker wrote a letter to Governor Clinton requesting that he or the representatives who sponsored the legislation be given the opportunity to speak with the staff person who recommended the veto.627  Mr. Tucker met with or had conversations over the telephone with Mr. Bratton to discuss Castle Sewer's need for a legislative remedy.628  On May 13, 1987, Representative Walker called the Governor's office and left a message "Rep Walker want and appt with BC ASAP.  He wants to bring Jim Guy Tucker and R.D. Randolph."629  Underneath the typed message Governor Clinton wrote "This is B.S. I thought Sam, called J. Guy, did he?  I thought PSC not regulating this project, right?"630  There is no doubt that the Governor was aware of the problems his veto created for Castle Sewer.
<P>On May 19, 1987, Mr. Bratton prepared a memorandum to Governor Clinton related to "Sewer District legislation/Jim Guy Tucker-R.D.Randolph, Mike Wilson, Bill Walker."631  The memorandum is revealing about the true nature of the discussions between Mr. Bratton and Mr. Tucker.  The first paragraph contains a discussion of the fact that Madison Guaranty could not legally own and operate a utility, and this limitation was the reason the S&L sold it.632  In addition, the first paragraph mentions that the problem stems from the fact that a utility regulated by the Public Service Commission was barred from mortgaging utility property without permission of the Public Service Commission.  Therefore, in Mr. Tucker's opinion, the mortgage was invalid because the utility had not obtained approval of the mortgage.633  The entire first paragraph mentions nothing about legislation remedying the cost of the Public Service Commission regulation or the burdens that such regulation places on small utilities.
<P>It was Mr. Bratton's position that Representative Walker was interested in seeing the legislation passed because it could save money for the citizens of the City of Wrightsville.634  Mr. Tucker informed Mr. Bratton that if the legislation were not passed that litigation "would result because of the question of the validity of the mortgage and the fact that the S&L is now being operated under the close scrutiny of FSLIC and is no longer controlled by McDougal, et. al."635  Thus, there was a threat of a lawsuit involving Madison Guaranty calling into question the legal work performed by the Rose Law Firm because the mortgage was invalid.636  In none of these subsequent paragraphs is there any mention of the merit of the legislation.
<P>In the last paragraph, Mr. Bratton indicated that he spoke with Robert Johnston, at the Public Service Commission and asked Mr. Johnston to review options available to solve the "Tucker/Randolph problem short of the deregulation proposed by H.B. 1780."637  
<P>On June 12, 1987, Act 37 of 1987 was enacted into law.638  Act 37 of 1987 divests the Public Service Commission of regulatory authority over small sewer and water companies.639  Interestingly, six days after the legislation was signed, Castle Sewer indicated to Madison Guaranty that they were prepared to enter into a new contract.640  
<P>D.<P>Clinton Promises to McDougal on Brewery Legislation
<P>Mr. McDougal consistently turned to Governor Clinton and Mrs. Clinton when he faced state regulatory obstacles involving his land development projects. 
<P>McDougal had many creative ideas for developing real estate.  At Castle Grande, he proposed to build a brewery with a tasting room641 that he hoped would become a profitable local tourist attraction.642  Mr. McDougal spoke with William Lyon, an Arkansas developer, who had borrowed $300,000 from Madison Guaranty.643  Mr. Lyon had already invested the money he borrowed from Madison Guaranty in a brewery in Little Rock.644  At that time, Mr. Lyon was interested in expanding his existing brewery so he could serve and sell alcohol on the same premises.645  However, existing Arkansas state law prohibited the sale of alcohol at a manufacturing facility. 
<P>Mr. Lyon and Mr. McDougal discussed the potential for success of a "brew pub" and the need to change the current state law in order to implement this plan.  Mr. Lyon testified that he discussed the change in the law with Mr. McDougal because he knew Mr. McDougal had "clout" with then-Governor Clinton.646  Mr. Lyon believed that "Jim McDougal thought that he owned Bill Clinton."647  
<P>Indeed, Mr. McDougal assured Mr. Lyon that he would be able to take care of the regulatory problems that prevented Mr. Lyon from building a brew-pub. Mr. McDougal intended to rely on his contacts in the state government, and particularly his friendship with Bill Clinton.648
<P>On December 12, 1984, Mr. McDougal wrote a letter to Betsey Wright, Governor Clinton's chief of staff, about a bill that had been pre-filed with the Arkansas State Senate.  The letter states: "Governor Clinton has made a commitment concerning this bill which I need to discuss with you at your convenience."649  The bill provided exactly the type of legislative relief necessary for Mr. Lyon to successfully build his brew-pub.650<P><P>  On February 18, 1985, the state senator sponsoring the bill withdrew it due to lack of support from the ABC Board.651 Mr. McDougal assured Mr. Lyon, however, that he could have the alcohol regulation changed instead through the ABC Board.652  
<P>Two days later, on February 20, 1985, the ABC Board enacted a regulation that permitted the tasting of alcohol on the premises of a manufacturing facility.653  As promised, Mr. McDougal was able to provide the necessary changes in the state regulations. 
<P>Later that year, Mr. Lyon and Mr. McDougal discussed the prospect of moving Mr. Lyon's brewery to Castle Grande and placing it in a building that was already on the Castle Grande property.654  Unfortunately, Castle Grande was located in a "dry" township and another change in the Arkansas state law or regulations was needed in order to open a brew-pub on the property.  Mr. McDougal again told Mr. Lyon know that he would "take care" of the necessary regulatory changes.655  In a letter dated November 20, 1985, Mr. McDougal informed Seth Ward, who was involved in Mr. McDougal's Castle Grande development, that Governor Clinton would help obtain approval for the brewery.  Mr. McDougal wrote: "I have spoken with the Governor [Clinton] on this matter and expect it will be approved."656
<P> Shortly thereafter, Mr. McDougal enlisted Mrs. Clinton's assistance in performing some legal analysis on the "wet/dry" issue.  In a January 3, 1986 memorandum from Rick Donovan, a Rose Law Firm associate, to Mrs. Clinton,657 Mr. Donovan confirmed that Castle Grande was in a "dry" township.  The memorandum reported that the only way to change the "dry" status was to pass a referendum in the township, or to seek a regulatory change through the ABC Board.  This memorandum was followed by an undated handwritten note from Hillary Clinton.  The note states:
<P>          "Rick -<BR>
               I visited with Seth Ward and gave him a copy of your memo and with Ken Shemin.  Please see Ken about a strategy to approach the ABC to argue the "dissolved township" theory.<BR></P>

<P>                                   Thanks,<BR>
                                   Hillary658<BR></P>
<P>Mr. Ward passed the January 3 memorandum on to Mr. McDougal. The Rose Law Firm billing records mysteriously discovered in the White House Residence indicate that Hillary Clinton billed for a "conference with Mr. Ward and Mr. Shemin" on January 7, 1996, and charged it to the Madison/IDC matter number.659  Mr. Donovan continued to research the wet/dry issue, writing a second memorandum to Mrs. Clinton January 23, 1986.  In his second memo, Mr. Donovan again concluded that without a regulatory change or a vote, the Castle Grande property would still be considered "dry."660   On February 7, 1986, Mr. McDougal wrote a memo to Jim Guy Tucker, "It looks like our township is dry.  Attached is a legal opinion Seth got from his attorney."  The legal opinion attached is Mr. Donovan's January 3rd memorandum.
<P>  At the end of February, the federal S&L examiners arrived at Madison Guaranty, and Mr. McDougal was removed from the S&L before his plans for the brewery could be successfully completed.  
<P>E.<P>McDougal Asks Governor Clinton to Fire Tough State Regulators  

<P>Mr. McDougal asked Governor Clinton for assistance related to Madison and his real estate projects.  For example, after Mr. McDougal received unfavorable treatment from Health Department officials monitoring Maple Creek Farms Land Development,  Governor Clinton's assistance directly resulted in the removal of the state employees regulating the project.    
<P>Maple Creek Farms was one of Mr. McDougal's real estate projects that he intended to subdivide into single-family lots.  On June 23, 1983, however, shortly after McDougal had purchased Maple Creek Farms, Lex Dobbins, a Saline County Health Unit Sanitarian, wrote to Mr. McDougal warning about the instability of the soils and the inadequate absorption fields.661  Mr. Dobbins suggested that "individual sewage disposal permit[s] be obtained prior to any construction," in order to ensure the safety of the sewage system.662  As a result, Mr. McDougal signed a "Memorandum of Agreement"  pledging that each lot would be individually evaluated and approved for a septic tank system and that the lots would not be less than 3 acres in size.663<P>  Without obtaining the permits required by the Memorandum of Agreement, Mr. McDougal began construction on Maple Creek Farms in February of 1984.  Mr. Dobbins reminded him of the need for the proper permits and maintaining lots of at least 3 acres in size664 and again urged Mr. McDougal to consider installing a community sewer system instead of septic tanks.665 
<P>Mr. McDougal wrote to Mr. Dobbins on March 6, 1984, assuring him that the customers would contact the Health Department before beginning construction and that the community sewer system would be available to any lot where a septic system failed.666   On April 26, 1984, Mr. McDougal signed another agreement with the Health Department, which stated, "The Department of Health agrees to issue temporary permits with a condition that property owner shall connect to the sewerage system when said system is available."667
<P>After seeing no significant improvement in the situation at Maple Creek Farms, Mr. Dobbins wrote to his supervisor, William Teer, Director of Sanitarian Services, of the problems.668  In response to Mr. Dobbins' memorandum, Mr. Teer wrote to Mr. McDougal on July 3, 1984, instructing him to correct the problems.669  Two weeks later, Mr. McDougal wrote back stating: "We are in agreement on your recommendations as to site protection and site drainage and are in the process of the continued implementation of these recommendations."670   
<P>Despite Mr. McDougal's assurances that the problems at Maple Creek would be alleviated, the situation was not.  On July 2, 1985, one year later, Mr. Teer informed Mr. McDougal that, absent corrective action, the Department of Health would not issue additional temporary individual sewage disposal permits in the poorly drained areas.671  Contrary to the agreements he had signed and letters he had written promising to correct the sewage problems on Maple Creek Farms, Mr. McDougal continued to ignore the warnings of the Health Department.
<P>By January 1986, Mr. McDougal was so frustrated by the persistent reprimands from the Health Department that he met with Governor Clinton.  Mr. McDougal provided Governor Clinton with a list of detailed grievances that he had with health regulators.672  Governor Clinton granted a meeting with Mr. McDougal and called Mr. Butler in order to summon the state workers as well.673  Mr. Butler recalled Governor Clinton telling him during the call: "the reason I think some of your staff is messing with this development is because this gentlemen [McDougal] has been a supporter of mine since I ran for Congress and has never asked me for anything."674  
<P>On March 4, 1986, Dr. Saltzman, Director of the Health Department, Jerry Hill, Environmental Chief of the Health Department, Janice Choate, an aide to Governor Clinton, Mr. Butler, Mr. McDougal and the Governor met in Governor Clinton's office.675  As a result of this meeting, Mr. Butler removed the three sanitation workers from their positions regulating Maple Creek.  A memorandum from Ms. Choate informed the Governor of this action and noted: "I believe they took their cue from you when you told them that Jim was your friend of 20 years who had never asked for a favor."676
<P>No witnesses denied that Governor Clinton "ordered" the firing of the sanitation workers,677 and the documentary evidence indicates that the termination decisions were made in response to the Governor's wishes.
<P>F.<P>McDougal Helps Select S&L Regulators
<P>In addition to obtaining the removal of state health regulators, Mr. McDougal was able to select some of the state regulators charged with overseeing Madison Guaranty.  The evidence indicates that Governor Clinton looked to Mr. McDougal to provide him with the names of appointees for banking board positions.  A handwritten memo about appointments on Governor's Office stationary reads, "Banking Board - ask McDougal."678
<P>In fact, the Governor's staff contacted Mr. McDougal for his recommendations for the State Savings and Loan Board.679  On February 7, 1985, Mr. McDougal wrote a memorandum to Governor Clinton recommending that John Latham, Chairman of Madison Guaranty, and Jerry Kendall be appointed to the Savings and Loan Board.680  A memorandum announcing Governor Clinton's appointments on March 4, 1985 reflected that Mr. Latham and Dr. Kendall were named to the Savings and Loan Board.681   Mr. McDougal had an obvious interest in having his own employee, Mr. Latham, appointed to a board that would have direct regulatory control over Madison Guaranty.  
<P>Indeed, the evidence indicates that, with then-Governor Clinton's assistance, Mr. McDougal consistently pushed through the appointments of persons who would be favorable to him and Madison Guaranty.  This pattern is demonstrated by the troubling case of William Lyon, an Arkansas developer and business associate of Mr. McDougal.  Mr. Lyon testified that: "Mr. McDougal called me, literally out of the blue, and asked if I would be on the Arkansas State Bank Board."682   Mr. McDougal informed Mr. Lyon that he could get then-Governor Clinton to appoint Mr. Lyon, "and he did."683
<P>During Mr. Lyon's term, however, Mr. McDougal informed him that it "would be more beneficial" if he sat on a different board - the Savings and Loan Board - which would be voting on whether Madison Guaranty could issue preferred stock in order to raise capital.684   Mr. McDougal made it clear to Mr. Lyon that the Governor would support Mr. McDougal in his effort to have the preferred stock issue passed.685  
<P>Mr. McDougal told Mr. Lyon that if he did not agree to serve on the Savings and Loan Board he would be asked to resign from the Bank Board.686  Mr. Lyon believed the preferred stock deal was "a rip-off of the stockholders" and told Mr. McDougal the he would not go over to the Savings and Loan Board.687  Ultimately, Mr. Lyon rejected Mr. McDougal's offer to move to the Savings and Loan Board because he did not want anyone controlling his vote.688
<P>Mr. McDougal asked Mr. Lyon to resign but Mr. Lyon "told him that he no longer had anything to do with the State of Arkansas" and therefore only the Governor could ask him to resign.689  Mr. McDougal then informed Mr. Lyon that he would ask Governor Clinton to ask Mr. Lyon to resign.  Perhaps not coincidentally, Governor Clinton called Mr. Lyon a month or so later and told Mr. Lyon that he had spoken with Mr. McDougal, and that the Governor wanted Mr. Lyon to resign.690  Mr. Lyon resigned from the State Bank Board in February 1984.691 
<P>Documents indicate that later that year, Mr. McDougal played a role in the appointment of the Arkansas Securities Commissioner, Beverly Bassett Schaffer, who ultimately did approve Mr. McDougal's proposal for preferred stock.   Woody Bassett, Ms. Schaffer's brother, wrote to the Governor several times recommending her for the position of Securities Commissioner, however, on a letter dated November 26, 1984, Governor Clinton wrote: "she'd be good but may need to do something else - B."692  After a December 22, 1984, message for the Governor from Mr. McDougal, however, in which he recommended Ms. Schaffer for the position of Securities Commissioner,693  Governor Clinton appointed Ms. Schaffer to the position of directly overseeing Madison Guaranty. 
<P>G.<P>McDougal Hires Mrs. Clinton and Her Law Firm
<P><P>1.<P>The Questionable Retention of the Rose Law Firm
<P>Perhaps as a favor to then-Governor Clinton and Mrs. Clinton, and in an effort to obtain a favorable state regulatory ruling from Ms. Schaffer, in April 1985, Mr. McDougal retained Mrs. Clinton and the Rose Law Firm to represent Madison Guaranty in its proposal for the issuance of preferred stock.  
<P>Mrs. Clinton has provided several versions of how the Rose Law Firm came to be retained by Madison Guaranty contradicted both her own statements and those of others.  Mr. McDougal made statements during the 1992 Clinton Presidential campaign and to the press in 1993 that he put Mrs. Clinton on retainer as a favor to Bill Clinton.  In 1992, Mr. McDougal told James Blair, a longtime Clinton friend and legal advisor to the campaign, and Loretta Lynch, a campaign lawyer who worked on the Whitewater-Madison matters, that Governor Clinton, in jogging pants, visited Mr. McDougal's office and told him that he and Mrs. Clinton were pressed for money and asked Mr. McDougal to give some work to Mrs. Clinton.694  According to Mr. McDougal, two hours later, Mrs. Clinton came by to set up the retainer.695 According to notes taken by Mr. Blair, Mr. McDougal said that he remembered the encounter "explicitly" because Governor Clinton, in his exercise clothes, left a permanent stain on Mr. McDougal's "new leather contour chair."696  In 1993, Mr. McDougal gave a similar account of the incident to the Los Angeles Times.  President Clinton does not recall asking Mr. McDougal to place Mrs. Clinton on retainer.697
<P>Mrs. Clinton has given a markedly different account of the circumstances surrounding Madison Guaranty's retention of the Rose Law Firm.  According to Mrs. Clinton, Richard Massey, then a first year associate at the Rose Law Firm, brought in Madison Guaranty as a client.  Mrs. Clinton claims that although she was the Madison Guaranty billing partner on the matter, she was merely acting as a "backstop" because the firm did not permit associates to bill clients directly.698
<P>During a press conference on April 22, 1994, Mrs. Clinton stated that Mr. Latham, Chief Executive Officer of Madison Guaranty, asked Mr. Massey whether he would be interested in representing Madison in connection with a proposed stock offering.  Mrs. Clinton further explained that Mr. Massey was aware that she knew Mr. McDougal, so "he came to me and asked if I would talk with Jim to see whether or not Jim would let the lawyer and the officer go forward on this project.  I did that, and I arranged that the firm would be paid $2,000 retainer."699  In a statement to the RTC in November 1994, Mrs. Clinton similarly told investigators that "she recalled Massey came to her and asked her to be the billing attorney which was a normal practice when an associate was handling the matter. . . Mrs. Clinton recalled that a Madison official (individual unknown) approached Rick Massey regarding a preferred stock offering in an effort to raise capital."
<P> In a sworn response to an RTC interrogatory in May 1995, Mrs. Clinton elaborated on her story.  Mrs. Clinton stated that Mr. Massey approached her because "certain lawyers" in the Rose Law Firm were "opposed" to representing Mr. McDougal until Mr. McDougal paid an outstanding bill, and he was aware that Mrs. Clinton knew Mr. McDougal.  Mrs. Clinton wrote:
<P>In the spring of 1985, Massey came to see me because he had learned that certain lawyers at the firm were opposed to doing any more work for Jim McDougal or any of his companies until he paid his bill and then only if Madison Guaranty agreed to prepay a certain sum. . . I believe Massey approached me about presenting this proposal to Jim McDougal because he was aware that I knew him.700
<P>Mr. Massey, however, contradicts Mrs. Clinton's account in sworn testimony before the Special Committee.  According to Mr. Massey, he was not responsible for bringing in Madison as a client.701  Mr. Massey stated specifically18  that Mr. Latham never offered him Madison's business,702 and that he did not recall approaching Mrs. Clinton with a proposal to represent Madison.703  Contrary to Mrs. Clinton's unsworn statement of November 1994 to the RTC, Mr. Massey also indicated that he did not ask Mrs. Clinton to be the billing attorney.704
<P>David Knight, a former Rose partner specializing in securities law, testified that he attended the lunch meeting during which, according to Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Latham allegedly hired Mr. Massey.705  Mr. Knight confirmed Mr. Massey's testimony that Mr. Latham did not ask Mr. Massey to represent Madison on the preferred stock offering.  Quite to the contrary, according to Mr. Knight, the subject of the stock offering never arose.706  Indeed, according to Mr. Knight, Mr. Latham informed him and Mr. Massey at the lunch that Mr. McDougal made all hiring decisions and that Madison Guaranty already had outside counsel.707
<P>Mr. Latham confirmed that Mr. McDougal made the decision19  to retain the Rose Law Firm.708  
<P>The essence of Mrs. Clinton's account of the Madison retainer was that she became involved due to an alleged outstanding debt that Mr. McDougal's Madison Bank & Trust owed to the Rose Law Firm in 1985.  Mrs. Clinton claimed that it was to relieve the concerns of her partners that she insisted on the $2000 per month retainer.  
<P>Documentary evidence and testimony provided to the Special Committee, however, indicate that the outstanding balance of Rose's bill to Madison Bank & Trust was paid in November 1984, months prior to Mrs. Clinton's retainer in April 1985. 
<P>Gary Bunch, President of Madison Bank & Trust, produced documents evidencing the bank's payment of the Rose legal fees in late October of 1984.  Minutes of Madison Bank for October 1984 indicate that $5,000 in legal fees are owed to the Rose Law Firm for work on the "Huntsville move appeal,"709 litigation relating to the relocation of the bank.  The minutes state: "Mr. McDougal seconded that Mr. Bunch will negotiate settlement with the firm."710  Mr. Bunch testified that Mr. McDougal directed him to pay the outstanding Rose Law Firm bill for the Madison Bank & Trust matter in full in October 1984.711 
<P>Following the discovery of the Rose billing records and the testimony of Mr. Massey before the Special Committee, Mrs. Clinton's story changed in a February 1996 interview with RTC investigators.20   Mrs. Clinton claimed the late Vincent Foster first informed her that Mr. Massey wanted to do work for Madison: "I believe it was Vince Foster who came to me, who said that Mr. Massey wanted to do this work, but the partners didn't want him to do it."712  When asked who suggested that she approach Mr. McDougal, Mrs. Clinton replied, "I don't have a specific recollection.  I believe it was Vince Foster, but I'm not positive."713
<P><P>2.<P>Mrs. Clinton Asks the Arkansas S&L Regulator to Approve a Novel Stock Issue
<P><P>The Rose Law Firm billing records belatedly discovered in the White House Residence show that Mrs. Clinton called Ms. Schaffer the day before the Rose Law Firm submitted to the Arkansas Securities Department Madison's proposal to offer preferred stock in order to raise badly need capital.714  Ms. Schaffer notified Mrs. Clinton of the approval of the proposal two weeks later in a letter addressed to "Dear Hillary."  Ms. Schaffer and Mrs. Clinton both denied that Madison was given any preferential treatment.715
<P>Prior to the discovery of the billing records, Mrs. Clinton claimed in her sworn responses to RTC interrogatories in May 1995 that she called the Arkansas Securities Department to find out "to whom Mr. Massey should direct any inquiries" but she did not recall to whom she spoke.716
<P>In testimony before the Special Committee, Ms. Schaffer directly contradicted Mrs. Clinton and stated that the proposal was discussed during the phone call.  According to Ms. Schaffer,  She called and said they had a proposal, and what it was about; and I said I'm familiar with that; I've already looked at that.  You know, I agree with the-basically I have no problem with that position, and you'll be getting a letter soon to that effect.. . I think in substance I said, basically,I agree with the position-I mean, that preferred stock can be issued pursuant to the Business Corporation Code.717 

<P>Mr. Massey likewise contradicted Mrs. Clinton's account of the phone call.  Mr. Massey testified that he drafted the proposal and knew exactly to whom the proposal should be sent.718  Mr. Massey also said that Mrs. Clinton never gave any instructions about addressing the transmittal letter.719  Mr. Massey did not recall asking Mrs. Clinton to make such an inquiry and was not aware that she had.720

<P>Prior to the Rose Law Firm's engagement of Madison, the law firm, Mitchell, Williams, Selig, Jackson & Tucker started to perform research related to a preferred stock proposal.721  The firm even opened a file labelled "Madison Guaranty - Sale of Stock" on February 6, 1985.722  For some reason, then, Mr. McDougal decided to send the work to the Rose Law Firm.
<P>On April 30, 1985, The Rose Law Firm wrote a letter to Charles Handley, Assistant to the Arkansas Securities Commissioner.21  to request an opinion as to whether Madison Guaranty was authorized to issue nonvoting preferred stock.723   Mr. Massey drafted the letter.724  This was the first time the Arkansas Securities Department was asked to make a determination on the ability of a savings and loan to issue preferred stock.725  After receiving the letter from the Rose Law Firm, Mr. Handley, an accountant, wrote, in a routing memorandum on May 6, 1985, that "perhaps one of our attorneys should review the matter and issue a legal opinion."726  Ms. Schaffer forwarded a copy to William Brady, who was the only staff attorney at the Arkansas Securities Department.727  Attached to the letter was a memorandum from Ms. Schaffer which said "Brady: Please review and draft reply to Hillary 6 May 1985."728  It was Mr. Brady's understanding that this was to be an approval letter.729  Therefore, any review was merely to get an understanding of the issues, because he believed it had already been determined that the proposal would be approved.  
<P>Mr. Brady did not draft a reply. Instead he drafted a memorandum to Ms. Schaffer explaining his objection to the plan.730  "The more I looked into the Rose Law Firm request concerning the issuance of preferred stock ... the less I supported the position presented in the Rose Law Firm."731   Because the plan had never been done in Arkansas before, Mr. Brady disagreed with the Rose Law Firm analysis: "I was not sure it was permissible."732  Mr. Brady believed the Arkansas Securities Commission should seek an opinion from the Arkansas Attorney General.733  
<P>Mr. Handley was also concerned about the right of Arkansas savings and loan associations to issue preferred stock.  Mr. Handley testified that after receiving the Rose Law Firm's letter his "initial belief was that Madison guaranty could not issue preferred stock because under the Arkansas State Savings and Loan Act, state institutions could only issue common stock."734  Mr. Handley relented after his supervisor, Ms. Jones, disagreed.735 
<P>On May 14, 1985, just two weeks after receiving this unique proposal, and despite the objections of her staff attorney, Ms. Schaffer approved the Rose Law Firm's position that Madison Guaranty could issue preferred stock.736   
<P>Over the course of the next seven months, the Rose Law Firm continued to prepare the documents for a preferred stock offering.737   Madison Guaranty, however, had lost interest in issuing preferred stock.  Instead, Madison tried to and raise capital through property syndication and a proposed offering22  of subordinated debt.    
III.<P>The Castle Grande Land Deal: A Series of Fraudulent Loans
<P>The land development commonly known as "Castle Grande" consisted of about 1,050 acres of property near Little Rock.  Madison Guaranty's wholly-owned subsidiary, Madison Financial Corporation, and Seth Ward, Webster Hubbell's father-in-law, jointly purchased the property for $1.7 million and then sold the land in parcels to various Madison insiders.738  Almost all of the sales were financed by loans from Madison Guaranty, and most of the loans were not repaid.  As a consequence, the Castle Grande deal caused nearly $4 million in losses to Madison Guaranty.739  These losses were borne ultimately by U.S. taxpayers.
<P>Numerous transactions related to Castle Grande were fraudulent, criminal, or both.  Indeed, the recent convictions of Mr. McDougal, Mrs. McDougal, and Governor Jim Guy Tucker on criminal fraud and conspiracy charges stemmed in part from certain aspects of the Castle Grande deal.  
<P>Under this sham transaction, Mr. Ward purchased 60% of the available land -- with 100% nonrecourse financing by Madison Guaranty -- and Madison Financial had the right to buy the property from him once it had found other buyers.  The inclusion of Mr. Ward in the deal was intended to, and had the effect of, circumventing an Arkansas regulation that limited investment in a service corporation such as MFC by a savings and loan.  In essence, Mr. Ward was nothing more than as "straw man" who held the property in his name for Madison Financial because Madison could not own it all.  As compensation for his role, Mr. Ward earned hundreds of thousands of dollars in commissions on the sale of the Castle Grande property.<P><P>
<P>New evidence indicates that Mrs. Clinton played a direct role in transactions involving Castle Grande and has never admitted the extent of her role.  The billing records discovered in the White House Residence in January 1996 indicate that between late 1985 and early 1986 Mrs. Clinton had numerous conferences with Mr. Ward about the matter and billed Madison for approximately 30 hours of work related to Castle Grande.740  Of importance, the billing records indicate that Mrs. Clinton drafted an option agreement dated May 1, 1986, between Mr. Ward and Madison.  Mrs. Clinton drafted this option at a time when Madison Guaranty was intense scrutiny from federal regulators.  According to James Clark, the chief examiner of the 1986 Federal Home Loan Bank Board examination of Madison Guaranty, the May 1 option "was created in order to conceal" the true purpose of questionable notes executed between Seth Ward, Madison Guaranty, and Madison Financial.741  
<P>The use to which Mrs. Clinton's work product was put raises questions about the state of her knowledge concerning what was going on at Madison Guaranty.  The Special Committee has identified one occasion where Mrs. Clinton was apparently put on notice of suspect loans related to Castle Grande.  When Madison Guaranty's top lending official, Don Denton, expressed concerns to Mrs. Clinton about questionable notes involving Seth Ward, she "summarily dismissed" his concerns.742  Mr. Denton gathered from her response that she was saying he should "take care of savings and loan matters and she would take care of legal matters."743
<P>Furthermore, the Rose Law Firm billing records indicate that Mrs. Clinton had spent time studying a letter prepared by the Rose Law Firm explaining why the Ward notes were questionable -- i.e., the rule limiting direct investment by a savings and loan in real estate ventures.  Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that Mrs. Clinton was apprised of both the law and the facts that made Castle Grande an illegal transaction.
<P>In the view of the Special Committee, Mrs. Clinton's role in the Castle Grande deal cannot be assessed in isolation from her reluctance to be forthcoming about the extent of that role.  Mrs. Clinton's role in the Castle Grande transactions was all but unknown prior to the discovery of her billing records in the White House residence in January 1996.  Indeed, in a sworn interrogatory given to the RTC in May 1995, Mrs. Clinton represented that she knew nothing about Castle Grande.744  In light of the billing records and other evidence, the Committee finds that Mrs. Clinton's representation is difficult to credit.
<P>A.<P>Structuring of the Acquisition of the Castle Grande Property to Evade State Regulations
<P> Mr. Ward and Madison Financial purchased the Castle Grande together in fall 1985 from Industrial Development Company of Little Rock ("IDC") for $1.75 million.745  Mr. Ward, who was working as a part-time consultant for Madison Financial, brought the possible purchase of this property to Mr. McDougal's attention.746  On September 13, 1985, Madison Financial and IDC entered into a purchase agreement, which Mr. Ward signed on behalf of Madison Guaranty.747  The closing was held on October 4, 1985.748  
<P>At an early stage, Rose Law Firm attorneys were involved in the deal.  Rose partner Thomas Thrash was involved in the acquisition of the IDC property for Madison Financial and attended the closing, although he has no recollection of it.749  In addition, the Rose Law Firm billing records reflect that, on November 14, 1985, Mrs. Clinton had a "conference with Seth Ward regarding purchase from [IDC Chairman] Brick Lile."750 
<P>Although some aspects of the deal struck by Mr. Ward and Madison Financial are disputed, the following is not in doubt.  Madison Financial purchased the property south of 145th Street -- about 40% of the total land area -- plus some other parcels for $600,000.751  Mr. Ward purchased most of the land north of 145th Street, plus the property's sewer and water utility, for $1.15 million.752  The entire purchase was financed by Madison Guaranty, which loaned Mr. Ward the $1.15 million on a nonrecourse basis.753
<P>  Madison Financial and Mr. Ward agreed that the property would be parceled, developed, and sold as quickly as possible; that proceeds from sales would be applied toward the mortgage on the property; and that Mr. Ward would receive a commission on any sale, whether the land belonged to him or Madison Financial.754  Finally, Madison Financial had the right to purchase all or some of Mr. Ward's property from him.755

<P>B.<P>The Fraudulent Nature of the Castle Grande Purchase
<P>The purchase of the Castle Grande property by Madison Financial and Seth Ward has been described by federal regulators as a fraudulent transaction.  In essence, Mr. Ward warehoused the property to allow Madison Guaranty to evade regulatory limitations upon its investment in real estate.
<P>Under Section V of the Rules and Regulations of the Arkansas Savings and Loan Association Board, Arkansas thrifts may establish service corporations to pursue real estate development ventures.756  Madison Financial Corporation, Madison Guaranty's wholly-owned subsidiary, was such a service corporation.
<P>Section V(C), however, limits a savings and loan's investment in its service corporation to 6% of the thrift's assets.  This rule is known as the 6% rule or the direct investment rule.  Section V(C) provides:
<P>An association may make any investment under this section if its aggregate outstanding investment in the capital stock, obligations, or other securities of service corporations and subsidiaries thereof . . . would not exceed thereupon six (6%) percent of the association's assets.757

<P>According to James Clark, the Examiner-in-Charge of the 1986 Federal Home Loan Bank Board ("FHLBB") examination of Madison Guaranty,758 the purpose of the direct investment rule was "[t]o limit the amount of risk that Madison Guaranty or any Arkansas thrift could take.  Direct investments in service corporations or in property are considered to be more risky than just lending on property."759
<P>The FHLBB's May 8, 1986 examination report on Madison Guaranty sharply criticized the purchase of Castle Grande as having been structured to circumvent the direct investment rule:
<P>Ward apparently warehoused this land to reduce Madison Financial's investment and the attendant borrowing from Madison Guaranty.  In this way, limitations on Madison Guaranty's investment in its Service Corporation are avoided. . . . By using this circuitous route, additional Madison Guaranty investment in Madison Financial was disguised as a loan to Ward.760

<P>In a recent interview with the FDIC's Office of Inspector General, Mr. Clark stressed that "had MGSL purchased Castle Grande directly, they would have exceeded their direct investment limit."761  In hearings before the Special Committee, Mr. Clark expressed the view that Mr. Ward was a "straw purchaser,"762 or someone "who obtains legal title to a property without having any actual financial interest in the property simply as a means to hide the true ownership of the property."763  Mr. Clark also explained that as a federal examiner he was concerned about the state direct investment rule because "internal FHLBB procedures called on an institution to be in compliance with state regulations" and "violating the state regulation would mean that the institution was not operating safely and soundly."764
<P> Others have confirmed that the purchase of Castle Grande was structured to evade the direct investment rule.  Don Denton, Madison Guaranty's Chief Lending Officer, testified in the McDougal trial that "[t]here was a limitation on the amount of investment that Madison Financial Corp. could make, so Madison took the amount it could legally take and the balance of the acquisition was taken by Seth Ward."765  And in a recent interview, Mr. Denton "said that it was his understanding that Ward was acting as a 'nominee' purchaser in the acquisition of the IDC property, acting on behalf of the institution and carrying the property at no risk."766  In a deposition taken in connection with the Ward v. Madison case, Madison Guaranty's CEO, John Latham testified that the purchase was divided between Madison Financial and Mr. Ward to escape the direct investment rule.767

<P>  In sum, the Special Committee finds that substantial evidence demonstrates that the purchase of the Castle Grande property was a fraudulent transaction that violated the direct investment rule and involved the use of Mr. Ward as straw man.23<P>   Mr. Ward testified to the Special Committee that he had no knowledge of the limitation on direct investment at the time of the Castle Grande purchase or that limitation dictated the structure of the transaction.768  That testimony, however, is contrary to a statement that Mr. Ward made to investigators working for the Pillsbury law firm.  An April 29, 1994 interview reflects that "Ward indicated with respect to Castle Grand [sic] that he understood when he purchased the property that the money was being loaned to him and the property purchased in his name because of a limitation on Madison Financial Corporation's investments."769 
<P>Moreover, Webster Hubbell, Mr. Ward's son-in-law -- with whom Mr. Ward talked about business constantly770 -- has stated that he was aware in September 1985 "based on what Mr. Ward told me" was that "Madison had limits on what it could own in its own name, and so Mr. Ward was going to own part of it until it could be sold."771  In another interview, Mr. Hubbell indicated that Mr. Ward may have told him that there was a regulatory limit on what Madison could purchase.772   
<P>Finally, in a December 1986 interview of James McDougal conducted by the Memphis, Tennessee law firm Borod & Huggins (which had been retained as special counsel by Madison Guaranty's Board of Directors), McDougal indicated that "Madison Financial took the property south of 145th Street and Ward took the property north of 145th Street.  This split was done because the entire project would have been beyond the capacity of Madison Financial due to bank board regulations."773  It seems likely that if Mr. McDougal knew about the limiting regulation he communicated this to Mr. Ward.
<P>The sham perpetrated in connection with Castle Grande did not end with the purchase of the property in the fall of 1985.  In subsequent months, the property was sold in a series of transactions.774  In most cases, the property was sold to Madison insiders and friends of the McDougals with 100% Madison financing.  Because many of these loans were not repaid, Madison Guaranty suffered large financial losses.  These losses were passed on to the American taxpayer after the institution's failure.  The RTC estimated that Castle Grande caused losses in excess of $3.8 million.775 
<P>Under his agreement with Madison Financial, Seth Ward reaped sizable commissions on all Castle Grande sales, which ultimately totalled over $300,000.776.  The last of these sales took place in late February 1986, when 486 acres was sold to former Senator J.W. Fulbright for $77,600, and the Castle Grande sewer and water utility was sold to a company owned by Jim Guy Tucker and R.D. Randolph for $1.2 million.777  After these sales, there remained only two parcels, both owned by Mr. Ward.  One of these was tracts 27 and 28 of Holman Acres.778  
<P>According to Don Denton, after February 28, 1986, Ward began to demand his commissions for Castle Grande sales but Madison Guaranty lacked ready funds to pay him.779  It seems likely that an even greater obstacle to the payment of the commissions was the presence of federal savings & loan regulators, who commenced their examination of Madison Guaranty and moved into its offices on or around March 4, 1986.780  Indeed, Mr. Latham testified in the Ward v. Madison trial that the presence of the examiners was a concern in this regard.781
<P>As a result of these difficulties, Madison Guaranty, Madison Financial, and Seth Ward executed a series of notes and loan transactions.  On March 31, 1986, Madison Guaranty loaned $400,000 to Mr. Ward.782  Notably, the loan was secured by the mortgage on the Holman Acres property.  Mr. Ward returned $100,000 within a week or so, leaving him with $300,000.783  Then, on April 7, 1986, MFC gave -- but did not fund -- two promissory notes to Seth Ward, one for $300,000, the other for $70,943.784  
<P>According to Mr. Denton, the exchange of these offsetting notes was intended to pay Mr. Ward his commissions.785  That is, the $400,000 loan (less the $100,000 that was returned) satisfied the commissions and the notes from Madison Financial offset any obligation by Mr. Ward to repay that loan.  Similarly, in the Ward trial, Mr. Ward testified that the $370,943 in notes was intended to document for the regulators his entitlement to commissions.786 24 
<P>In September 1987, after he had a falling out with Mr. McDougal, Mr. Ward filed suit against Madison Guaranty claiming that he was entitled to collect unpaid commissions on the sale of Castle Grande property.787  He was represented in that action by Alston Jennings, a prominent local attorney in the Little Rock law firm of Wright, Lindsey & Jennings.788  
<P>The Ward v. Madison case is significant because the meaning of several documents bearing upon the Castle Grande transaction, including the May 1 option drafted by Mrs. Clinton, was disputed at the trial.  Specifically, Mr. Latham, testifying for the defense, took the position that the option was related to Mr. Ward's unpaid commissions.789  Mr. Ward maintained at the trial that the option had nothing to do with his commissions and claimed that Madison Financial had simply wanted the right to purchase Holman Acres from him.790<P><P> 
<P>The jury returned a verdict in Mr. Ward's favor and awarded him over $391,000.791  In 1993, however, Mr. Ward and the RTC as the successor to Madison Guaranty reached a settlement under which Mr. Ward agreed to pay $325,000 to the RTC in exchange for a release from all liability.792
<P>Prior to the trial, Madison Guaranty had suggested in a document filed with the court that the underlying transactions as to which Mr. Ward claimed an entitlement to commissions were questionable.  Specifically, Madison Guaranty indicated that it might argue that it did not owe any commissions to Mr. Ward because of his own "unclean hands."  By way of explanation, Madison Guaranty stated in its court filing: "With knowledge, the Plaintiff [Mr. Ward] agreed to purchase a section of the Undeveloped Property in his name so that Madison Financial Corporation would not exceed its investment limitation, imposed by the FHLBB, of 6% of the assets of the corporation.  In effect, Plaintiff acted as a straw man for the real estate purchase for the mutual benefit of himself, Jim McDougal and other individuals."  No witness at the trial, however, suggested that Mr. Ward's commissions were ill-gotten and Madison Guaranty's lawyers made no such argument.
 
<P>C.<P>The September 24, 1985 Letters
<P>The essential terms of the initial agreement between Mr. McDougal and Mr. Ward as described above were set forth in a letter dated September 24, 1985 from Seth Ward to Jim McDougal.793  Two versions of this document exist.  According to Seth Ward, one of the letters was typed on September 24, 1985, by Susan Strayhorn, James McDougal's secretary, and the other version was prepared sometime thereafter and then backdated.794  Ms. Strayhorn agreed that she typed the first letter at Mr. Ward's direction.795  Mr. Ward has testified that he had the backdated letter prepared or prepared it himself.796
<P>The major difference between the two versions of the September 24 letter concerns Madison Financial's right to purchase Seth Ward's property.  While the original letter gave Madison Financial the right to purchase all of Mr. Ward's property, the backdated letter excluded from Madison's reach a 22 1/2 acre parcel known as Holman Acres.  A detailed legal description of the 22 1/2 acre parcel -- identified as "Part of Tracts 27 & 28, Holman Acres, Pulaski County, Arkansas" -- was attached as an addendum to the letter.
<P>Although Seth Ward testified that the backdated version of the September 24, 1985 letter was prepared within several weeks or a month of that date,797 there is substantial evidence that it was created much later than that.  Former Madison President John Latham has testified that he had never seen the letter until Mr. Ward brought it to his attention in May or June of 1986.798  Ms. Strayhorn testified that the document was not in the S & L's files, and that she had never seen it before 1987.799  Don Denton, who initially refused to state whether he had any knowledge about the backdating of the letter for fear of "digging a hole for myself," later said that "I'll go so far as to say [it was] drawn after July, 1986."800  And James Clark, lead investigator for the 1986 examination of Madison Guaranty, has stated that he does not recall ever seeing the document during the time he was at the savings and loan.801
<P>D.<P>The May 1 Option Disguises the Questionable Payments to Seth Ward

<P>While Mr. Clark examining Madison Guaranty, Madison insiders did not disclose to him that commissions might be owed to Seth Ward, and Mr. Clark was not aware of this issue until he discovered by chance the original September 24, 1985 letter in a desk drawer.802  The letter was the first indication Mr. Clark had that Seth Ward might be owed commissions.803  
<P>Mr. Clark also saw the March 31 and April 7 notes during the examination and became concerned that there might be a connection between the notes.804  Specifically, his suspicion was that the crossing notes might represent a payment to Mr. Ward and thus constitute "independent financing of MFC by Madison Guaranty"805 Such "independent financing" would raise the concerns underlying the direct investment limitation.806  
<P>When Mr. Clark inquired about the March 31 and April 7 notes, however, he was told that they were unrelated, "completely separate deals."807  Instead, the April 7 notes -- evidencing the $373,000 debt from Madison Financial to Mr. Ward -- were said to be related to a plan by Madison Financial to purchase Holman Acres from Mr. Ward.  The transaction was to be accomplished through an as yet undrafted option agreement which would replace the notes.  The notes, Mr. Clark was told, existed simply to guarantee that Madison Financial would go through with the deal pending preparation of the option and would be canceled after the exercise of the option.808  
<P>According to Mr. Clark, if he had known that the exchange of notes was a device to pay Mr. Ward's commissions -- and thereby transfer money from the savings and loan to its the service corporation -- it would have effected his examination in several respects.  Mr. Clark said "that if he and known about the commissions, at the very least he would have called it a direct investment by Madison Guaranty into MFC because MGSL would be funding MFC's obligations, and he would have been asking what Ward did to earn the commissions."809  He also expressed the view that "the commissions would [have] been a further indication that Ward was a 'straw' buyer in the IDC purchase" and that "if the loan had been made to pay commissions, he would have considered the loan 'deceptive on its face.'"810
<P>An option was prepared on May 1, 1986, and entitled "Option To Purchase Real Estate."25 811  Under the May 1 option -- which was executed by Mr. Ward and Mr. Latham -- Madison Financial had the right to purchase tracts 27 and 28 of Holman Acres from Mr. Ward for $400,000 and Mr. Ward was to be paid $35,000 for extending this option to Madison Financial.812
<P>That Mrs. Clinton was involved in the creation of this option is indisputable.  The Rose Law Firm billing records reflect that on May 1, 1986, Mrs. Clinton billed Madison Guaranty for two hours of time for the following work: "Conference with Seth Ward; telephone conference with Seth Ward regarding option; telephone conference with Mike Shauffle; prepare option."813  Furthermore, there appears in the lower left hand corner of the option a word processing code ("0190g") that, according to the Rose Law Firm's counsel, indicates the document was created at the Rose Law Firm by or for Mrs. Clinton.814  Mrs. Clinton, however, has sworn that she has no recollection of the option agreement or the transaction it reflects.815
<P>According to Mr. Clark, the May 1, 1986 option prepared by Mrs. Clinton was used to disguise the fact that the crossing notes between Seth Ward, Madison Guaranty, and Madison Financial were designed to funnel commissions to Mr. Ward.  He stated that "based upon what he has now learned the option was created 'in order to conceal the connection -- whatever it was-- between'" the notes.816 
<P>When Mrs. Clinton prepared the May 1 option, she may have known about the relationship involving the May 1 option and its use to disguise the fact that Madison Guaranty had paid Mr. Ward's commissions.  A message slip produced by Mr. Denton reflects that Mrs. Clinton called him from the Rose Law Firm on April 7, 1986.817  Mr. Denton returned the call and spoke to Mrs. Clinton.818  The subject of the conversation was the notes between Mr. Ward, Madison Financial, and Madison Guaranty.819  Mr. Denton had the sense that Mrs. Clinton was preparing a $400,000 note involving Madison Financial and Mr. Ward and he told her that such a note had already been prepared and executed.820  Mrs. Clinton asked him to send whatever notes there were to her and Mr. Denton did so, sending copies of the notes by courier.821
<P>Mr. Denton recalled that during the conversation he indicated to Mrs. Clinton that a problem might exist with respect to the Ward notes because "they constituted in effect a parent entity fulfilling the obligation of a subsidiary."822  Mrs. Clinton, however, "summarily dismissed" that concern in a way that he took to mean that "he would take care of savings and loan matters, and she would take care of legal matters." 823
<P>On June 13, 1996, the same day that the Special Committee received Mr. Denton's testimony, the Committee in a letter addressed to Mr. Kendall, Mrs. Clinton's counsel, requested that the First Lady attempt to refresh her recollection regarding the matters discussed by Mr. Denton and inform the Committee of what she recalls about them.824  The Special Committee's request was made in response to an earlier offer by Mrs. Clinton through a White House spokesman to answer in writing questions regarding the subject of the Special Committee's work.
<P>On June 17, 1996 the Special Committee received an affidavit from Mrs. Clinton accompanied by a letter from Mr. Kendall.  In the affidavit, Mrs. Clinton gave no indication as to her recollection regarding the subject matter of Mr. Denton's testimony.  Instead, she simply requested that Special Committee refer to Mr. Kendall's letter "addressing certain allegations recently made by Mr. Don Denton."825  In his letter, Mr. Kendall maintained that Mr. Denton's recollection is "wholly unreliable" but gave no indication as to the recollection of the First Lady.826  In sum, the First Lady has neither confirmed nor denied Mr. Denton's testimony.
<P>E.<P>Mrs. Clinton's Previously Unknown Legal Work for Questionable Castle Grande Transactions

<P>Prior to the discovery of the Rose Law Firm billing records in the White House Residence, the nature and extent of Mrs. Clinton's work on Castle Grande matters was virtually unknown.  Indeed, Patricia Black, former Counsel to the RTC Office of Inspector General, testified in 1995 that "[w]e have no evidence that she [Hillary Clinton] worked on Castle Grande."827  The evidence obtained in the course of the Special Committee's investigation now establishes that Mrs. Clinton had substantial direct involvement in Castle Grande.
<P>From the billing records, the Special Committee learned that, over a seven month period from late 1984 to mid 1985, Mrs. Clinton billed almost 30 hours of time to Castle Grande related matters while representing Madison Guaranty -- more than any other Rose Law Firm attorney;828 that she he had 15 conferences with Seth Ward, the central figure in the transaction -- seven of them occurring within 18 days in December, 1985;829 that she had a telephone conference with Don Denton on April 7, 1986;830 and that she drafted an option agreement between Seth Ward and Madison Financial Corporation on May 1, 1986.831  Because Mrs. Clinton has no recollection of any of these events, however, the Special Committee's understanding was limited.  But just days before the conclusion of its investigation, the Special Committee obtained new evidence illuminating Mrs. Clinton's Castle Grande-related work on April 7 and May 1, 1986.  
<P>From Jim Clark, the FHLBB examiner in charge of the 1986 examination of Madison Guaranty, the Special Committee now knows that the option drafted by Mrs. Clinton, in his view, "was created in order to conceal" a direct investment in Madison Financial through the payment of questionable commissions to Seth Ward.   
<P>From Don Denton, Madison's former chief lending officer, the Special Committee has learned that apparently on April 7 Mrs. Clinton "summarily dismissed" concerns he expressed to her by Mr. Denton about questionable notes involving Seth Ward -- notes she apparently was set to prepare had they not already been drafted.  Mr. Denton understood from Mrs. Clinton's response that she was saying he should "take care of savings and loan matters and she would take care of legal matters."  
<P>The Rose billing records also suggest that Mrs. Clinton learned of the direct investment rule by June 1985.  In a letter dated June 17, 1985, Richard Massey, then a Rose associate working with Mrs. Clinton, wrote a letter to officials of the Arkansas Securities Commission ("ASC") regarding Madison Guaranty's application to engage in brokerage activities.832  The letter was a response to a May 22, 1985 ASC memorandum about the same matter in which the ASC discusses the 6% "assets limitation which is set forth in Rule V(C),"833 i.e., the direct investment rule found in Rule V(C) of the Rules and Regulations of the Arkansas Savings and Loan Association Board ("ASLAB").  Mr. Massey's June 17 letter likewise refers to "the limitation set forth in Rule V(C)."834  It concludes by saying, "[w]ith this response, Madison hereby amends the Application."835  The billing records indicate that on June 17, 1985, Mr. Massey billed time to "draft/revise response to ASLAB application,"836 and Mrs. Clinton billed time to "review applications amendments."837  Mrs. Clinton would have become aware of the direct investment rule through this review of Mr. Massey's letter. 
<P>The use to which Mrs. Clinton's work product was put raises questions about her knowledge of the state of affairs at Madison Guaranty.  The billing records suggest that Mrs. Clinton should have been aware of the rule against excessive direct investments.  Furthermore, from her conversation with Don Denton, Mrs. Clinton apparently was put on notice -- prior to the drafting of the option -- that Mr. Ward was taking part at Madison in transactions that were at least questionable if not fraudulent.  Unless she was engaged in conscious avoidance, Mrs. Clinton should have known these facts when she drafted the May 1 option, which concealed from the regulators the very transactions Mr. Denton warned her about.<P>
<P>In 1995, when asked about her knowledge of Castle Grande and several other land developments, Mrs. Clinton stated, under oath, "I do not believe I knew anything about any of these real estate parcels and projects."838
<P>The billing records, however, revealed that Mrs. Clinton performed a substantial amount of legal work for Madison Guaranty related the Castle Grande property and billed this time to a matter called "I.D.C."  The records indicated, for example, that Mrs. Clinton had more than a dozen conferences with Seth Ward.  Mrs. Clinton's claim that she did not know anything about Castle Grande appears contrary to the billing records.
<P>In response to a set of supplemental interrogatories propounded by the RTC in 1996, Mrs. Clinton sought to explain her prior blanket denial of knowledge of Castle Grande by saying that she thought of the larger property as "IDC" and a small portion of the property as Castle Grande Estates. 
<P>In the RTC's interrogatories which I answer on May 24, 1995, the term "Castle Grande" was not defined, and we construed this reference to be to Castle Grande Estates, a mobile home development which I now understand to be a portion of the 1050-acre tract.  In these responses to the Supplemental Interrogatories, I will refer to the entire tract not as Castle Grande but as the "IDC property", because "IDC" was the billing name for work involving that property at the Rose Law Firm.839
   
<P>Mrs. Clinton's attempt to claim she had misunderstood the name of the project appears contrary to a wealth of evidence to the effect that the entire 1000+ acre tract was known as "Castle Grande."  That is the term by which Madison Guaranty officials and federal regulators commonly referred to the parcel.  
<P>The minutes of a MFC Board of Directors meeting dated September 12, 1985, reflect that the Board discussed the purchase of 400 acres of land on 145th Street for $600,000 and that "[a]fter a lengthy discussion, the Board unanimously approved the purchase of this development to be known as Castle Grande Estates."840  Consistent with these minutes, Don Denton testified at the McDougal trial that the property "was renamed Castle Grande shortly after the acquisition" from IDC.841  At the same trial, Mr. McDougal said that Castle Grande was the name of "about a thousand acres" of property.842  And Susan McDougal, denying any distinction between Castle Grande and IDC, has stated that "[i]t was always the same thing.  As far as I know, IDC and Castle Grande were one and the same."843<P> 
<P>Two former FHLBB examiners who participated in the 1986 examination of Madison and scrutinized the Castle Grande transaction, James Clark and Dawn Pulcer, testified that Madison insiders referred to the whole project as Castle Grande.844
<P>Finally, Davis Fitzhugh, a former Madison Financial Vice President, testified that he understood all of property south of 145th Street to be Castle Grande.845  But Mr. Fitzhugh agreed that the $50,000 check he used to make the down payment on his purchase of the Levi Strauss building -- which is located north of 145th Street -- carried the notation, "For: sale of bldg C Castle Grande."846 
<P>In the summer of 1988, Mrs. Clinton ordered the destruction of her files related to Castle Grande.  A July 21, 1988 memorandum from Mary Russell to Mrs. Clinton reflects that the Rose Law Firm was in the process of making retention decisions with respect to the files of closed cases.847  The memorandum gave Mrs. Clinton three options with regard to any file: keep it intact, microfilm and then destroy it, or destroy it without microfilming.  The memorandum asked for a response by August 9, 1988.  
<P>Mrs. Clinton requested destruction, without microfilming, of four Madison Guaranty files, including two related specifically to the "I.D.C." matter and the "Ward Option."  The Special Committee finds it troubling that in July or August of 1988 Mrs. Clinton would order the destruction of these files.  Because the Ward v. Madison case was ongoing at the time, Mrs. Clinton might well have destroyed evidence relevant to the case.  Indeed, the May 1 option drafted by Mrs. Clinton was an important piece of evidence in the trial.  It seems reasonable to assume, moreover, that Mrs. Clinton was aware of the Ward v. Madison litigation, involving as it did her former clients.  Moreover, Webster Hubbell, her law partner and close friend, attended at least some of the trial.848  
<P>F.<P>Webster Hubbell's Mysterious Role in Structuring Questionable Castle Grande Transactions
<P>It is unclear the extent of the involvement Webster Hubbell, Seth Ward's son-in-law, with respect to providing legal advice to Mr. Ward relating to the Castle Grande transaction.  Mr. Hubbell's statements on this matter are contradictory to each other, contradictory to the testimony of other witnesses and contradictory to documentary evidence.  His statements also defy common sense.  Even Mr. McDougal's secretary, Ms. Strayhorn, expressed surprise when told that Mr. Hubbell did not prepare the May 1 option for his father-in-law.849  In a hearing before the Special Committee she asked, "Why wouldn't he [Ward] have his son-in-law prepare the document?"850
<P>Mr. Hubbell was in frequent contact with Mr. Ward.  Mr. Hubbell said that Mr. Ward and he talked about business constantly.851  Mr. Hubbell testified that Mr. Ward "talked to [Hubbell] a lot about deals," and "you couldn't stop him basically" from talking about business.852
<P>With respect to the Castle Grande transaction, Mr. Hubbell altered his story with respect to when he learned that Mr. Ward was a nominee purchaser for Madison Financial.  First, Mr. Hubbell testified that he understood in September 1985 based on what Mr. Ward told him that "Madison had limits on what it could own in its own name, and so Mr. Ward was going to own part of it until it could be sold."853  Also, in an interview with the RTC Inspector General, Mr. Hubbell "said that Ward told him that he was negotiating on behalf of Madison to buy the IDC property, which would then be split up between Madison and Ward."854  In testimony before the Special Committee, however, Mr. Hubbell repeatedly testified that he was not aware of the deal between Madison and Ward until after the closing in early October 1985.855
<P>Mr. Hubbell was reluctant to answer questions regarding his own view of the legality of Mr. Ward's role in the purchase of the IDC property.  When asked if he viewed it as a way to evade a regulatory restriction, Mr. Hubbell answered, "I have never represented an S&L.  I don't know whether it's illegal or not."856  When he was asked if he considered this transaction as a classic parking or warehousing transaction, Mr. Hubbell answered, "I think of parking and warehousing a little bit differently."857  When asked if he thought Mr. Ward could be considered a "straw man," Mr. Hubbell testified, "I didn't give it any consideration, you know.  'Straw man' means, to me, somebody who you clear title through."858
<P>Mr. Hubbell has denied advising Mr. Ward with respect to the transaction.859  He specifically denied preparing the backdated September 24, 1985 letter or advising Mr. Ward with respect to its preparation.860  Mr. Hubbell claimed that although he was aware of his father-in-law's deal with Mr. McDougal and discussed it with Mr. Ward, he does not recall discussing the September 24th letter.861  Mr. Hubbell claimed, "I recall discussing the nature of his deal with Madison, but not the letter, no."862
<P>There is evidence, however, that Mr. Hubbell may have prepared a backdated September 24, 1985 letter, which was found in his files at the Rose Law Firm.863  Martha Patton, Mr. Hubbell's secretary at the Rose Law Firm, has stated that although she does not recall typing the letter she believes she did because the type is similar to that of the IBM typewriter she used and the second page of the document is formatted in the style she used while a Rose secretary.864  She added that the letter appears to be "her style of typing."865  Mr. Hubbell testified that "it's certainly possible" that his secretary typed the agreement.866 26   And Alston Jennings testified that Mr. Ward told him that Mr. Hubbell's secretary had typed the letter.867  
<P>There is also some indication that Mr. Hubbell was supposed to prepare the May 1, 1986 option agreement.  Handwritten notes taken by James Clark, the examiner in charge of the 1986 examination of Madison Guaranty, reflect the following:
<P>MFC Commitment to buy land at corner of Route 145 . . .
<P>Option will be prepared,  atty out of town (Hubbell)
<P>  to replace note.868

The note strongly suggests a hitherto unknown involvement in Castle Grande by Mr. Hubbell.
<P>Mr. Clark has stated that he believes that the information reflected in the above note came from former Madison chief loan officer Don Denton.869  Although Mr. Denton does not believe that he was the source of information recorded by Mr. Clark, Mr. Denton has implied at other times that Mr. Hubbell advised Mr. Ward on the Castle Grande matter.870  For example, Mr. Denton believed that the wording on the note dated October 15, 1985 stating that Mr. Ward was not personally responsible for the note was prepared by Mr. Hubbell.871  Also, Mr. Denton believed that he had some conversations with Mr. Hubbell about the February 28, 1996 transaction.872
<P>Furthermore, Mr. Denton implied in his recent interview that Mr. Hubbell was involved in the March 31 and April 7 notes between Mr. Ward, Madison Guaranty, and Madison Financial.  He stated that he was "reasonably confident" that when Mrs. Clinton called him regarding these notes she was acting on Mr. Hubbell's behalf.873  Mr. Denton would not testify as to whether he ever dealt with Mr. Hubbell on the matter of the notes.874  He also declined to answer whether he had visited Mr. Hubbell's office at Rose regarding Mr. Ward or Madison Guaranty.875
<P>  Mr. Hubbell has not provided complete and accurate statements about his legal representation on other occasions.  He did so in 1989 when the Rose Law Firm was retained to represent the FDIC in the case against Madison Guaranty's former accountants.876  April Breslaw, the RTC attorney who hired the Rose Law Firm for the Frost litigation, testified that when she asked Mr. Hubbell about Mr. Ward, Mr. Hubbell informed her that he did not represent Mr. Ward.  He also told her "that his relationship with his father-in-law was not close."877  Ms. Breslaw was asked whether she believed Mr. Hubbell lied to her when she hired him, and she replied, "Yes, sir. I do."878  Even Mr. Hubbell admitted that he did not disclose to Ms. Breslaw his knowledge of the IDC transactions.879
<P>Mr. Hubbell did not provide complete and accurate statements about his legal representation again in 1993 when he failed to disclose information he had learned the previous year from reading the Rose Law Firm billing records to FDIC investigators looking into the 1989 retention of Rose.880  In 1993, FDIC investigators reported that in 1985, the Rose Law Firm represented Madison Guaranty before the Arkansas Securities Department on two matters.881  Mr. Hubbell admitted, however, that he was aware of additional matters on which the Rose firm had worked, including the IDC closing and the option agreement, on behalf of Madison, and that he did not disclose it to investigators.882
<P>In view of the foregoing, the Special Committee has no confidence in Mr. Hubbell's claim that he did not advise Mr. Ward with respect to Castle Grande.

<H3>PART III.     GOVERNOR CLINTON'S QUESTIONABLE RELATIONSHIP WITH DAN LASATER</H3>
     
I.<P>Governor Clinton's Close Personal Relationship With Dan Lasater

<P>After Governor Clinton was defeated for re-election in 1980, he met with Dan Lasater, George Locke and David Collins, Mr. Lasater's partners27  in Collins, Locke & Lasater,28  later changed to Lasater & Co., a newly formed investment bank.883<P>  According to Mr. Locke: "[I]t was a short time after the election, in fact I want to think maybe the next day . . . .  [H]e didn't take a day off."884  Mr. Clinton wanted to see "if Dan would support him in his efforts to regain the governor's seat."885   
<P>The meeting lasted a "couple" of hours, and the main topic of conversation was Mr. Clinton's plan to run for governor.886  Mr. Locke believed that Mr. Clinton approached Mr. Lasater because Stephens, Inc., Little Rock's largest financial firm, had supported Mr. Clinton's opponent, Frank White.887  Mr. Lasater claimed that he did not recall the meeting.888  
<P>In 1983, Roger Clinton, the Governor's brother, went to work for Mr. Lasater at his horse racing farm in Ocala, Florida.889  Mr. Lasater first met Roger Clinton when Roger was working as a musician in Hot Springs,890 sometime in the late 1970's or early 1980's,891 and that either Governor Clinton or his mother, Virginia Kelly, asked Mr. Lasater to hire Roger.892  In a 1986 FBI interview, however, Mr. Lasater stated that Governor Clinton, as opposed to Mrs. Kelly, asked him to hire Roger.893  Similarly, White House Deputy Director of Personnel Patsy Thomasson, Mr. Lasater's long-time friend and associate,894 testified that sometime in 1982 or 1983 Governor Clinton asked Mr. Lasater to give Roger Clinton a job.895
<P>Mr. Lasater supported Roger Clinton when he had trouble paying a drug-related debt.  In late February 1985, Roger Clinton was a witness at a friend's cocaine distribution trial in which he testified that Mr. Lasater, after learning of Roger Clinton's drug debts, loaned him $8,000 to retire them.896  Ms. Thomasson confirmed that Mr. Lasater provided Roger Clinton with a check for an amount "between $5,000 and $10,0000,"897 and Mr. Lasater admitted that he loaned Roger Clinton $8,000 to pay a debt to drug dealers.898  According to Mr. Lasater:
<P>Roger came to me and said that he owed a drug dealer $8,000, and that the drug dealer had threatened him, his mother and his brother [Governor Clinton] if they didn't pay and wanted to know if I would loan him the money, and I did.899
<P>Mr. Drake testified that Mr. Lasater provided him with cocaine while he was an employee of Lasater & Company, and that he believed that Mr. Lasater used cocaine as a tool to manipulate people.900  Mr. Lasater admitted before the Special Committee that he did give drugs to his employees.901  
<P>  On December 12, 1986, Mr. Lasater entered a guilty plea to the felony of "knowingly and intentionally conspiring to possess and to distribute cocaine."902  He served a 30-month sentence in prison.903
<P>Mr. Lasater claimed "that it has never been alleged that I committed any fraudulent act or lied in the course of any investigation."904  A federal bankruptcy judge, however, found, in open court, that Mr. Lasater lied under oath during the bankruptcy trial of his former business partner, George Locke, and also found that Mr. Lasater was involved in a conspiracy to defraud Mr. Locke's creditors.905  In January 1985, a Little Rock paper reported the judge's findings.906  During the same period of time, Mr. Lasater was attempting to secure the bond underwriting for the Arkansas State Police Radio bond financing.907  When asked about these findings, Mr. Lasater told the Special Committee, "I had forgotten about that."908  Mr. Lasater also admitted that he did not disclose to the state police his involvement in the conspiracy.909
<P> In 1984, Mr. Lasater sponsored a fundraiser for Governor Clinton in 1984.910  This fundraiser, held for over 100 people in Little Rock, raised approximately $50,000.911  Mr. Lasater testified that he and his family contributed a total of $8,000 to Governor Clinton in 1984, and that he also bought a table at a fundraiser for the Governor that cost between $6,000 and $12,000.912  Mr. Lasater believed that in 1982 he only contributed between $4,000 and $5,000 to Mr. Clinton.913  An affidavit that was supplied to the FDIC by Mrs. Clinton's attorney, David Kendall, identified at least $8,000 in contributions that were made by Mr. Lasater and Lasater controlled entities in 1982.914   Mr. Kendall's affidavit also listed $4,000 in contributions that Mr. Lasater and Lasater controlled entities gave to Governor Clinton in 1985.915  In addition, according to Mr. Lasater, Mr. Lasater provided Governor Clinton free use of Lasater owned aircraft.916 
<P>Mr. Lasater testified that he saw Governor Clinton only infrequently, and that he was "not a close friend" of Governor Clinton.917  Mr. Lasater claimed that he only visited Governor Clinton at the Mansion on two occasions, and that they "were both social events.  They weren't one-on-one meetings."918  There is evidence to the contrary.  Arkansas State trooper Barry Spivey has testified that while he was assigned to Governor's security unit from 1982-1984,919 he observed Mr. Lasater visiting Mr. Clinton at the Governor's Mansion, and that920 the Governor went "to Dan's a lot.  We went down there more than Dan came down there I would say."921  Mr. Spivey has testified that he normally did not enter Mr. Lasater into the Mansion's security logs "because I knew that he and Bill were friends, that they visited socially.  I had flown on his plane.  I knew that Bill spent a lot of time at Dan's office, and that Dan spent time at the Mansion."922  According to Trooper Spivey, "I probably saw Dan [at the Mansion] half a dozen times at least.  And I'm going to say that I took him by his office even more than that, just me personally."923  Mr. Spivey has testified that he took the Governor to visit Mr. Lasater's offices:
<P>I remember a lot of times taking Bill down to Dan's office and he would jump out and I'd circle and wait until he came back and, or I would go inside and stay in the lobby.924
Mr. Lasater did not recall Governor Clinton visiting the Lasater & Co. offices.925 
II.<P>Governor Clinton Provides Favors to Dan Lasater

<P>A.<P>Dan Lasater's Special Access to Governor Clinton

<P>Mr. Lasater further claimed that he felt he "never received any special treatment from Governor Clinton or anyone on his staff."926  Governor Clinton's staff, however, paid attention to recommendations to state board appointment by Mr. Lasater.927  For example, the Governor received a list of persons928 recommended by Mr. Lasater and his firm, Lasater & Co., for appointment or re-appointment to the Arkansas Housing Development Agency ("AHDA") Board, the agency to which Lasater & Co. submitted proposals to participate as underwriters in state bond issues.929    
<P>Documentary evidence indicates Mr. Lasater met with Governor Clinton.  On February 15, 1985, for example, Mr. Lasater wrote to Governor Clinton in part to thank him "for the opportunity to sit down and visit with you."930  Mr. Lasater admitted that the meeting referred to in the letter is "more than likely" a one-on-one meeting in January or February 1985 that he had with the Governor in his office in the State Capitol.931  One of the subjects raised in the letter deals with discussions held between the Governor and Mr. Lasater about the appointment of one of Mr. Lasater's AHDA Board candidates, Donald Spears.932
<P>Mr. Lasater also requested that Lasater & Company be advised "of all financing proposals effecting the state," prior to public announcement and stated that:
<P> we would be more comfortable if you would take the opportunity or ask someone on your staff to take the opportunity to appraise me or my staff of any actions by you or your staff prior to any public announcements so that we will not be surprised or in some instances embarrassed because of the announcement."933  
<P>On at least one occasion, Governor Clinton wrote a note to Chief of Staff Betsey Wright, Maurice Smith and "CG," on a piece of Lasater & Company stationary that appears to state, "need to fill their [Lasater & Co.] recs for SEC [Securities Commissioner] / AHDA."934  The Lasater & Co. stationary was attached to a written presentation that was prepared by Lasater & Co. and EF Hutton for a meeting that they had with the Governor on January 10, 1985 at the Legacy Hotel in Little Rock.935  An agenda for the meeting listed appointments for the Arkansas Securities Commissioner and the Arkansas Housing Development Agency as the first two orders of business.936   
<P>B.<P>The Governor's Office Steers Valuable State Bond Business to Dan Lasater

<P>The Special Committee is troubled by documentary and testimonial evidence indicating that Governor Clinton's office directed board members of the AHDA to award bond underwriting contracts to Mr. Lasater's firm, and that the Governor's office monitored and assisted Lasater & Co.'s efforts to secure the underwriting contract for the $29.2 million bond financing of a state police radio system.
<P>Prior to 1983, Collins, Locke & Lasater did not participate as an underwriter for any AHDA bond offerings.937  On February 17, 1983, the AHDA Housing Subcommittee selected Collins, Locke & Lasater to serve as an underwriter for one of the agency's housing bond financing.938  Charles Stout, who was Chairman of the agency's board at the time, described the circumstances surrounding the inclusion of Collins, Locke & Lasater as a member of the AHDA's Single Family Housing underwriting team.
<P>According to Mr. Stout, thirty minutes before an AHDA Board meeting, he received a telephone call from Bob Nash, who was Governor Clinton's assistant for economic issues:29 
<P>He was on the governor's staff over there.  We had selected underwriters for an issue, and he called over and asked me to cut in Lasater for 15 percent.  I said Bob that's not right, the governor's office is not to interfere with this agency.  And he said, well, that's the way we want it anyway.939 
<P>The Governor's office directive to award Collins, Locke and Lasater fifteen percent of the underwriting contract concerned Mr. Stout for a number of reasons.  He stated that "he [Lasater] was a local underwriter and rather inexperienced, that was what I didn't like about it."940  The AHDA had also already selected the group of underwriters that it wanted to cover the offering in question.941  Mr. Stout had difficulty recalling with specificity that the phone call was received on February 17, but he did know that Collins, Locke & Lasater had not participated as an underwriter for any AHDA offerings prior to Mr. Nash's call.942  
<P>Linda Chandler, formerly Linda Trent, then acting executive director of AHDA and a Lasater-recommended appointee, testified that the Lasater firm had never been a member of an underwriting team prior to February 17, and that she had never even heard of the firm prior to the firm's inclusion in the single family underwriting.943 
<P>Mr. Stout was upset by the instructions from the Governor's office to choose the Lasater firm, and he told his fellow Board member Mort Hardwicke:30  "I thought it was wrong for the governor's office to tell us how to run our business over there."944  Mr. Stout further testified: "[w]ell the governor's office doesn't interfere with the directors of the Arkansas Housing Development Agency and tell them what underwriter to use.  That business is the director's business, nobody else's."945  
<P>Mr. Nash's directive had surprised Mr. Stout, and he believed that the request threatened the independence of the AHDA.946  Mr. Stout was not aware of any previous instances where the governor's office had ever inserted itself into the underwriting selection process--particularly to tell the board "what underwriter to use."947  The request threatened the independence of the agency in fulfilling its responsibilities.948
<P>Mr. Stout recognized the significance of Mr. Nash's directive, and he asked Mr. Hardwicke to pick up another telephone receiver to listen to the call.949  Mr. Hardwicke claimed in his deposition that he had no knowledge that the Governor's office identified an individual firm that it wanted to receive AHDA business.950  When Mr. Hardwicke was confronted with Mr. Stout's testimony that he had actually listened to the phone conversation that took place between Mr. Stout and Mr. Nash, he said that he did not "recall the incident," but he did not doubt Mr. Stout's testimony.951  After Mr. Stout and Mr. Hardwicke got off the phone with Mr. Nash, they discussed what Mr. Nash had told Mr. Stout to do and decided that they would have to approach each of the board members individually and tell them that Mr. Nash had given the directive to include the Lasater firm in the underwriting.952
<P>After Mr. Nash told Mr. Stout to "cut in" Lasater for 15 percent of the underwriting for the 1983 Series A $26,365,000 Single Family issue that was discussed during the February 17 Housing Sub-Committee meeting, Mr. Stout informed him that the board would comply with the governor's office's request.953  In fact, the minutes of the Subcommittee show that Collins, Locke & Lasater received 13 1/3 percent of the bond underwriting contract.954 
<P>Mr. Stout also explained that Mr. Nash's request to include the Lasater firm as an underwriter was not limited to the one issue that was considered on February 17.  Mr. Nash's directive required that Collins, Locke & Lasater be included as an underwriter in "any future issues for 15 percent."955  Mr. Stout confirmed that Mr. Lasater's firm was included in subsequent issues in compliance with Mr. Nash's directive.956  Mr. Lasater's company participated as an underwriter in $637 million dollars worth of AHDA/ADFA bond offerings between 1983 and 1986.957
<P>According to the minutes of the AHDA Executive Board minutes for April 12, 1983, the Board unanimously approved the recommendation of the Multi-family Housing Sub-Committee to retain Merrill Lynch as the lead underwriter and to include Stephens Inc. and TJ Raney & Sons as the local underwriters for the agency's Multi Family Housing issue.95831   The AHDA Special Executive Board minutes from April 19, 1983, show that Collins, Locke & Lasater was added to the "underwriting team for the agency's proposed 1983 Multi-Family Issue."959
<P>Linda Chandler, AHDA's Executive Director, agreed that before Collins, Locke and Lasater was added to the Multi-Family Housing issue, that the board had already "carefully considered and discussed" which local firms would participate in the offering.960  The last-minute inclusion of Mr. Lasater's firm into this bond underwriting syndicate was a circumvention of the normal process of careful debate that was part of the AHDA's underwriter selection process.961  In fact, Ms. Chandler agreed that during her four years at the agency, she is not aware of any other "circumstance where, at the last minute, after the recommending committee had made up its lists of participants," another firm was added to the syndicate.962  
<P>After Collins, Locke & Lasater's unprecedented inclusion on the underwriting team, Stephens, Inc., one of the firms that had been chosen during the April 12 Executive Board meeting, withdrew from the deal in protest.963  Ms. Chandler said that no financial firms had ever withdrawn from an AHDA underwriting because they were upset that the normal process of selection had been violated.964  Mr. Nash denied that he ever directed Mr. Stout to award business to the Lasater firm.965
<P>In 1984, an Arkansas state trooper was shot and killed during a traffic stop in a section of Arkansas that was not covered by the state's antiquated communications system.966  Although the state police had recognized the need to acquire a new communications system as early as two years before the trooper's death, this event served as a catalyst for the police to plan for the acquisition of a new system.967  On the way to the trooper's funeral with Governor Clinton, Colonel Tommy Goodwin, the Director of the Arkansas State Police ("ASP"), approached the Governor about the need for the state to acquire a new communications system.968  Colonel Goodwin informed the Governor that a new system would cost the state an estimated $17-$18 million dollars and the Governor indicated he would support the acquisition of a new system.969 
<P>On April 4, 1985, Governor Clinton signed into law Act 817, "An act authorizing the leasing of communications equipment for the Department of the Arkansas State Police; providing for the payment and security of the costs of the equipment; and for other purposes."970  This legislation established, among other things, the methods of financing that could be used in connection with providing the state with a new police communications system.
<P>Flight logs maintained for Mr. Lasater's aircrafts show that Governor Clinton received a free flight on a Lasater-owned plane shortly after he signed the enabling legislation.971  On May 10, 1985 the Arkansas State Police Commission ("Commission") voted to award the underwriting contract for the financing of the new system to a syndicate of financial firms that included Lasater & Company.972  Lasater & Co.'s share of the fees for this project was $115,040.00.973  
<P>The Special Committee has obtained information indicating that the Lasater syndicate obtained an unfair advantage over the other firms competing for this lucrative underwriting contract.  The Lasater group worked closely with the law firm that advised the Governor's office on this matter and drafted the actual legislation.974  Moreover, once the legislation was passed, the governor's office monitored the Lasater firm's progress in the bidding process.975  Later, the same law firm that had represented Lasater and drafted the legislation, was retained to write an opinion on the meaning of the law; the opinion would, in large measure, determine which firm won the underwriting contract.976  Not surprisingly, the statement the firm favored the Lasater firm, which was awarded a portion of the lucrative contract.977
<P>Michael Drake, an executive vice president at the Lasater firm testified that Lasater, T.J. Raney, and E.F. Hutton formed a syndicate to compete for the financing contract for the police radio project "right after Bill [Clinton] was elected to his second term [of office]."978  Bob Snider of T.J. Raney testified that he first discussed this offering with Mr. Drake in November 1984, and that Mr. Drake indicated to him that the Lasater firm had already been working on "the state police deal."979   Mr. Snider was under the impression that Mr. Drake had been engaged in discussions with Samuel Bratton, Governor Clinton's Counsel, about the police radio project prior to a meeting that Mr. Snider had with Mr. Bratton in November.980
<P>According to Mr. Drake, Lasater & Co. was approached by T.J. Raney because of Mr. Lasater's relationship with Governor Clinton:
<P>One, they knew that while Bill was [out of] office, that there were two firms in Little Rock that - two investment firms that helped him with a variety of different things.  One was Lasater & Company - one was Dan Lasater, and the other was Doobie Sullivan.981
Mr. Snider testified that Mr. Lasater's strong political connections was one of the reasons that his firm decided to include them in the syndicate.982   
<P>After Mr. Drake was contacted by T.J. Raney, he told Mr. Lasater that T.J. Raney had approached Lasater & Co. "because of your relationship with Bill, to try to get this legislation passed."983  Mr. Drake said he then identified for Mr. Lasater the steps that he thought were necessary in order to secure the underwriting contract for the police radio financing.  The three steps he identified included finding a law firm to draft the legislation, working with the Governor's office, and explaining to the state police "what we are trying to do."984
<P>Betsey Wright, the Governor's Chief of Staff testified that she was under the impression that the Mitchell, Williams firm was working on the legislation for the Governor's office, and that they were not working for the Lasater syndicate.985  Ms. Wright further stated that she was not aware that the Lasater firm had retained Mitchell, Williams to represent them in connection with their efforts to secure the underwriting contract.986   
<P>Billing records from Mitchell, Williams, however, indicate that the law firm had numerous meetings and conferences with members of the Governor's staff on behalf of the Lasater group, and that the Governor's office likely knew that Mr. Lasater had engaged the Mitchell firm.987  In fact, in a letter dated January 23, 1985 that Mr. Lasater sent to the Governor, Mr. Lasater informed the Governor that he was working with Bill Woodyard, a Mitchell, Williams attorney, "to help workout financing details."988  Mr. Young testified that Mr. Lasater engaged Mitchell, Williams to "develop the legislation and other things to implement the transaction."98932  
<P>During the May 10, 1985 ASP Commission meeting where the Lasater group was chosen to perform the underwriting for the financing of the project,990 "some" of the firms that had given presentations to the Commission, "requested permission to revise their proposals as they felt there had been some misunderstanding of the Act."991  This dispute centered around the fact that the Lasater group's proposal called for annual and semi-annual lease payments, and First Capital's proposal called for monthly lease payments.992  A proposal that incorporated deferred payments, "allowed for more arbitrage to be credited against that present value cost."993  
<P>In an apparent effort to quiet the controversy surrounding the different interpretations of the law, the Mitchell -- Mr. Lasater's firm -- was retained by the Arkansas Office of State Purchasing to render a legal opinion as to "whether Section Five of the Act requires Lease Payments, as defined in Section Three of the Act, are required to be made on a monthly basis to investors who purchase an interest in a Lease Agreement authorized by the Act."994  This issue had been raised by the First Capital firm and was the basis for their request for a chance to revise their proposal.995  
<P>Mr. Mitchum, the Police Commissioner who was asked to review the different proposals for the Commission, testified that First Capital and the Lasater group were "neck and neck," but that the delayed payments called for in the Lasater proposal made their bid more attractive.996  As a result, the opinion given by Mitchell Williams33  favored the interpretation of the law that their client Lasater & Co. had relied on. 
<P>Section Five does not state to whom the monthly transfers out of the Lease Fund are to be made.  Therefore there is no requirement that the transfers be made to the ultimate payee or lessor under the Lease Agreement.997 
Mr. Mitchum agreed with First Capital's analysis that the Act called for the state to make these payments on a monthly basis.998
<P>On May 1, 1985 nine days before the ASP Commission awarded the bond underwriting contract to the Lasater syndicate, Michael Gaines of the Governor's staff,34  sent a memorandum directly to Governor that contained a head count as to which ASP Commissioner's favored or disfavored giving the police radio underwriting contract to Mr. Lasater.999  Lasater & Co. is the only firm that is referenced in Mr. Gaines' report to the Governor.  In addition, the memorandum contains hand written notes from Betsey Wright that are directed to the Governor, which read in part, "[w]e have a real problem here since 'street talk' is that Lasater (sic) put in unreasonably low bid knowing that he can raise it once he gets it."1000  Ms. Wright's note implies that the governor's office had an interest in Mr. Lasater's participation in the project, and that if Mr. Lasater was involved in submitting a low bid it could cause the Governor's office a "real problem."  The Governor replied: "Lasater should be told bid must price."1001
<P>Ms. Wright sent Governor Clinton sent another memorandum on the subject of Mr. Lasater's activities related to the state police radio financing on May 13, 1985.1002  The memorandum informed Governor Clinton that the Lasater group faced potential threat from a member the Legislature that was threatening to go to the Telecommunications Study Committee to insist on an alternative form of financing that would eliminate the deal Lasater had made with the ASP Commission.1003  Ms. Wright also informed the Governor that she alerted "Drake," suggesting that the Governor was familiar with Mr. Lasater's executive vice president.1004
<P>On May 15, 1985, Mr. Gaines drafted yet another memorandum on the subject of Lasater's ability to participate as an underwriter on the police radio project.1005  The May 15 memorandum was addressed to Ms. Wright and dealt specifically with the controversy surrounding the First Capital group's protest.  Mr. Gaines' memorandum reads in part: 
<P>The Capital Resources group [First Capital], which did not get the ASP Commission's nod, intend to contest the award to Hutton, Lasater, Raney on the following points: 1) Capital offers a fixed rate rather than a floating rate, and 2) Capital's proposal  was based on monthly payments by the state to repay the debt while H,R,L based their proposal on payments every 6 months.  Capital points out that the legislation (written by H,R,L) requires monthly payments.1006
<P>These communications between the Governor and his staff clearly indicate that the Governor's office had a keen interest in not only Mr. Lasater's participation in the police radio underwriting contest, but in helping ensure that Mr. Lasater's firm was able to secure the contract.
<P> During February 1985, two months before the ASP sent out requests for proposals for the state police radio financing, news accounts likely put Governor Clinton and members of the ASP Commission on notice that Mr. Lasater used cocaine, and that he was the possible target of a drug investigation.
<P>On February 27, 1985, The Arkansas Gazette reported that a witness in the drug trial of Hot Springs lawyer, Sam Anderson, Gina Canada, said in her sworn testimony that Dan Lasater had given Roger Clinton $8,000 to pay off drug debts, and that Mr. Lasater "also used cocaine."1007  The next day, another article appeared in The Arkansas Gazette that reported on the sworn testimony given by Mr. Anderson:
<P>"In the summer of 1984, Anderson said Roger Clinton had told him that he had to see him.  They arranged to meet in a boat on Lake Hamilton because [Roger] Clinton said he didn't want to be seen in a public place with Anderson. . .  Anderson said [Roger] Clinton told him that he had been approached by State Police investigators and that he was very, very frightened, totally frightened to death.  He said [Roger] Clinton informed him that the investigators wanted to set up three people:[Roger] Clinton's drug supplier, Anderson and Lasater."1008 
<P>Although this trial occurred in Little Rock, Colonel Goodwin claimed that he was not aware of this testimony about Mr. Lasater even though it was printed in one of the state's two largest papers.1009  Colonel Goodwin also asserted that he did not believe that an investigation of Mr. Lasater's drug activity had been initiated by the "summer of 1984."1010
<P>In any event, Colonel Goodwin testified that he had at least one conversation with Governor Clinton, during which Mr. Lasater's drug use was discussed.  Mr. Goodwin stated: 
<P>I remember at least one of those meetings was after the legislation had passed.  Governor Clinton, myself and a lot of other people knew that Dan Lasater was a user of cocaine.  The conversation with the Governor, Clinton . . . was we sure don't want any firm involved in financing this that is about to be arrested for selling cocaine.  I think he directed that statement to me in particular.1011
<P>Colonel Goodwin believed that he implied to Governor Clinton that Mr. Lasater should not be have been involved in the financing for the police radio system, and that he was concerned about Mr. Lasater's participation in the deal.1012  Mr. Goodwin said that he recognized that it would have been problematic to have a financial adviser with a drug problem doing work for the state.1013
<P>   The fact that it was well known or understood that Mr. Lasater was a cocaine user, gave Colonel Goodwin reason enough to disqualify Mr. Lasater from getting this police radio financing contract, and he believes that he made the Governor aware of his sentiments.1014  At this point, the Governor asked Colonel Goodwin to ascertain if Lasater was in danger of being caught for using cocaine.1015  Colonel Goodwin agreed that Governor Clinton's focus was not on Mr. Lasater's use of cocaine, rather it was directed toward determining whether he was going to be arrested for such use while his company was handling the police radio transaction.1016
<P>Colonel Goodwin then asked a captain in the ASP's Criminal Investigation Department to "quietly find out if there was a major investigation or any investigation going on Dan Lasater at the time."1017   Betsey Wright testified that she also asked Colonel Goodwin to inquire as to whether there were any ongoing criminal investigations of Mr. Lasater.  She testified that he reported back to her that there were no investigations outstanding.1018 
<P>On December 14, 1983, Mr. Lasater sent Governor Clinton a letter discussing a forthcoming bond liquidation.1019  At the top of the letter is a note written by Mr. Clinton.  The part of the note that is discernable addresses Linda Garner,1020 who, at the time, was Insurance Commissioner for the State of Arkansas.1021  The note, presumably written in reaction to the information in the letter, reads, "MS [...] after Garner [...] you talk to her-- we must give him [...] B."1022  Although the note is not precise as to what Governor Clinton wanted to give to Mr. Lasater, he apparently wanted to give him something involving Ms. Garner.  That the letter discusses a liquidation of bonds by insurance companies, and suggests that Mr. Clinton wanted to provide liquidation business to Mr. Lasater.  
<P>In the summer of 1983, during her tenure as Insurance Commissioner, Ms. Garner placed Mount Hood Pension Fund, National Investors Life Insurance, and National Investors Pension Fund into receivership and became the receiver.1023  Near the end of 1983, Mr. Lasater's company contacted Ms. Garner and expressed a desire to help with the administration of the firm's insurance portfolios.1024  Sometime later, according to Ms. Garner, Governor Clinton "[e]xpressed concern that an Arkansas firm that had been handling might be losing the business...."1025  The Governor also suggested "[a]pointing a broker from E.F. Hutton to select who the portfolio manager would be."1026  Ms. Garner deemed Governor Clinton's suggestion to be inappropriate and told him so.1027  Mr. Lasater's firm had close ties with E.F. Hutton.

<H2>PART IV.  DAVID HALE AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT SERVICES, INC.</H2>
I. The Special Committee's Attempts To Obtain Hale Testimony
<P>The Special Committee unsuccessfully sought to obtain the testimony of David Hale, former president of Capital Management Services, Inc., who was a critical witness in the recently concluded Tucker-McDougal trial.  
<P>In October and December 1995, the Committee was informed by the Office of the Independent Counsel that the OIC's "investigations and prosecutions would be seriously hindered or impeded if the Committee examined in any forum," David Hale,1028 and that hearings "prior to the trial of United States v. James B. McDougal, et al., regarding ....Capital Management Services" would hinder or impede their investigations and prosecutions.1029  As a result, the Special Committee postponed examination of Mr. Hale and hearings into Capital Management Services until after the Tucker-McDougal trial.
<P>On May 17, 1996, after the conclusion of the trial, the Special Committee requested that Mr. Hale make himself available to provide deposition and hearing testimony.1030  Mr. Hale's attorney, Theodore B. Olson, responded that "based on the rights guaranteed to him [Mr. Hale] by the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, Mr. Hale respectfully" declines to appear before the Special Committee.1031  Mr. Olson stated that "Mr. Hale has been explicitly threatened, in writing, with prosecution in Arkansas by Arkansas state authorities."1032  Mr. Olson further stated that Mr. Hale "has been advised that any testimony that he may give before the Special Committee may be used against him by Arkansas prosecutors in any such future proceeding in Arkansas."1033  
<P>On June 5, 1996, the Committee subpoenaed Mr. Hale to make himself available for deposition and public hearing.  Mr. Hale again asserted his Fifth Amendment privilege.1034  John A. Mintz, an attorney for Mr. Hale, wrote: "In absence of a court order to testify and a grant of immunity as provided by Federal law," any testimony Mr. Hale may give before the Special Committee "may be used against" Mr. Hale.1035
<P>On June 11, 1996, the Special Committee was not able to secure the 12 votes required to grant Mr. Hale limited use immunity for his testimony to the Special Committee.  Therefore, the Committee will not have Mr. Hale's testimony to evaluate matters related to Capital Management Services as set forth in Senate Resolution 120.
II. Mr. Hale's Testimony in the McDougal Trial: What was Governor Clinton's Role in the Making of the $300,000 Master Marketing Loan?
<P>Mr. Hale testified as a prosecution witness for nine days at the Tucker-McDougal.  Specifically, Mr. Hale testified that he has known James McDougal, Jim Guy Tucker, and President Clinton for over 20 years.  He met Mr. McDougal in 1959, when he and Mr. McDougal were members of the same fraternity at University of Arkansas.1036  Mr. Hale met Jim Guy Tucker in the mid-1960s and hired Mr. Tucker as his lawyer in 1980.1037  Mr. Hale met President Clinton in the early 1970s.1038  Mr. Hale continued his relationship with these three men throughout the 1980s.<P>  In 1979, Mr. Hale obtained a license for an Small Business Investment Corporation ("SBIC"), Capital Management Services, Inc.1039  This SBIC was required to loan money to those who were economically or socially disadvantaged.1040
<P>Mr. Hale testified that in the fall 1985, Mr. Tucker asked him to attend a meeting with Mr. McDougal and Mr. Tucker.1041  The three drove to Mr. McDougal's newly purchased Castle Grande development to view the site.1042  Mr. McDougal said to Mr. Hale, "I'm going to need some funds, and we're going to have to clean up some members of the political family."1043  Mr. Hale testified that when Mr. McDougal said "political family," he understood that Mr. McDougal meant "Bill Clinton, and some of his aides, Jim Guy Tucker and some of McDougal's associates."1044
<P>Mr. Hale testified that later that evening, he and Messrs. McDougal and Tucker went to Mr. Tucker's house and reached an agreement related to a scheme to defraud the Small Business Administration by fraudulently obtaining money from CMS.1045  The agreement consisted of a plan to have Mr. Tucker "get my purchase of the property completed as fast as possible."1046  After the sale, Mr. Hale would look for a buyer of the property, "someone we could put the property's name in."1047  Madison Guaranty would finance the purchase, and according to Mr. Hale, "Jim would see to it that Madison Guaranty would make the loan on the purchase enough so that we would have $500,000 put in the SBIC."1048  Mr. Hale explained, "[I]n order for Jim Guy and Jim and others to have the funds they needed, we had to take the money from Madison, put it into the SBIC, and then loan it back out."1049
<P>Messrs. Tucker, McDougal and Hale decided on $500,000 to enable CMS to increase its SBIC loan limit from $150,000 to $300,000.1050  Mr. McDougal told Mr. Hale that the urgency of the loan stemmed from the fact that federal regulators were coming in to examine Madison Guaranty.1051
<P>In either January or February 1986, Mr. McDougal asked Mr. Hale to meet with Mr. McDougal and then-Governor Clinton "to talk about getting the loan ready and consummated."1052  Mr. Hale went to Mr. McDougal's office at Castle Grande (where McDougal had moved when the examiners came into the S&L), and the three allegedly discussed the loan Mr. Hale was going to make.1053
<P>Mr. McDougal proposed that the loan be made to Susan McDougal.1054  Governor Clinton allegedly offered to provide as security for the loan property in Marion County (where Whitewater is located).1055  Mr. McDougal also offered to put up as security his stock in Madison Guaranty.1056  Governor Clinton then allegedly told Mr. Hale "be sure -- my name cannot show up on this."1057
<P>The transactions were consummated in February-April of 1986.  On February 28, 1986, Madison Guaranty lent Dean Paul, Ltd. $1.2 million.  According to the plan, Mr. Hale used $502,000 to put capital in CMS and applied for an additional $500,000 of matching funds from the SBA.1058   This capital infusion raised CMS's lending limit to $300,000.1059
<P>On April 3, 1986, Mr. Hale, through CMS, made a $300,000 loan to Susan McDougal d/b/a Master Marketing.1060  Mrs. McDougal's application for the loan stated that Master Marketing was an advertising company.35   Mr. Hale knew that the statement was untruthful.1061
<P>Mr. Hale testified that he looked to then-Governor Clinton and Mr. McDougal to repay the loan because he believed that they were receiving the proceeds.1062  In May 1986, Mr. McDougal contacted Mr. Hale in an attempt to alter the original loan documents because things were going bad at Madison.1063
<P>In 1991, auditors questioned Mr. Hale about repayment of the loan.1064  Mr. Hale arranged with Mr. McDougal's attorney to obtain a judgement, which would satisfy the auditors.1065  Suit was filed, and Mrs. McDougal agreed to the judgement, although it was not collectable and only affected how much money Mr. Hale could have in CMS and how much money Mr. Hale could draw. 1066  Mr. Hale persuaded a friend to buy the loan and give CMS a note for it.  The purpose of the note was to give the appearance to the auditors that the loan had been paid.  Mr. Hale sent a letter to the SBA indicating that the Master Marketing loan had been paid in full, thereby hiding the loss.1067
<P>The district court judge in the Tucker-McDougal trial refused to allow Mr. Hale to testify to the other two meetings that Mr. Hale has asserted he had with President Clinton.  Mr. Hale has stated that shortly after the initial meeting with Mr. McDougal and Mr. Clinton, he ran into Mr. Clinton on the steps of the Arkansas Capitol.  Governor Clinton allegedly approached Mr. Hale and said that Mr. McDougal would call Mr. Hale.  Governor Clinton allegedly hoped that Mr. Hale would help Mr. McDougal.
<P>Mr. Hale has further alleged that a third meeting took place at a Little Rock shopping mall.  Governor Clinton, agitated, allegedly asked Mr. Hale:  "Do you know what that ---- Susan did with the money?"1068  
<P>William Watt, Mr. Hale's business associate also recalled the involvement of Governor Clinton in the Dean Paul loan.1069  Mr. Watt recalled going to Mr. Hale's office, and Mr. Hale was anxious about getting the appraisals done quickly.1070  Mr. Hale told Mr. Watt: "I've got to have this done."1071  Mr. Hale said he had been "to a meeting out at the Capitol ....or the Governor's mansion."1072  Mr. Hale also said, "And Governor Clinton is interested.  He wants me to try to get it to him to help his friends."1073  During a subsequent telephone conversation with Mr. Watt, Mr. Hale raised the Governor's name again.1074  According to Mr. Watt, Governor Clinton asked Mr. Hale, "Did you get my friends"--- "Did you get my deal done?  Did you help my friends?"1075
<P>Robert Palmer, a real estate appraiser who worked on the appraisal of the property, provided testimony at the Tucker-McDougal trial concerning the involvement of politicians.  Mr. Palmer testified that Mr. Watt, called told Mr. Palmer that the appraisals of the property had to be increased.1076  Mr. Watt told Mr. Palmer that "they really needed a higher figure on the property" and that "David Hale was doing a favor for Jim McDougal."1077  Mr. Palmer testified that Mr. Watt instructed him to "do whatever [he has] to do" even if that meant they "use an inflated value."1078  Mr. Watt told Mr. Palmer not to "worry about any repercussions.1079  Everybody knows about the deal ....this goes all the way, you know, to the top."1080  Mr. Palmer asked if it was "McDougal" and Watt said "higher."1081  Mr. Palmer said "politically" and Watt said "yes."1082
<P>Special Agent Michael Patkus of the FBI testified at the trial that of the $300,000 loan from CMS to Master Marketing, $111,500 went to Flowerwood Farms to be used for loan payments.1083  One of the checks drawn on the Flowerwood Farms account was written to Whitewater Development Corporation in the amount of $24,455.06.1084  The memo section of the check reflected that the funds were for a loan.1085  Agent Patkus testified that the funds were deposited in Whitewater's account at Madison Guaranty were used to cover a check, dated March 22, 1985.1086  According to Agent Patkus, this March 22 check was made payable to Ozark Realty for $25,000.1087
<P>President Clinton admitted that he went to Mr. McDougal's office at Castle Grande one time, but denied that Mr. Hale was present during the meeting.1088  Mr. McDougal admitted, however, that he told an FBI agent on July 17, 1995, that Mr. Clinton had visited him at his Castle Grande offices on several occasions. The President claimed he was never present at any meeting between Mr. McDougal and Mr. Hale.1089  Moreover, he denied telling Mr. Hale that his name could not appear on any loan or financial documents or that Mr. Hale could use President Clinton's property in Marion County as security for a loan.1090  The President denied that he ever asked or pressured Mr. Hale to make a loan to him, Mr. McDougal, Mrs. McDougal or Mr. Tucker.  The President alleged that Mr. Hale "has told two or three different stories" but they are "simply not true."1091  The President denied having knowledge of or receiving the proceeds from the $300,000 loan from Capital Management Services to Master Marketing.1092 
<P>The Independent Counsel presented other evidence  corroborating Mr. Hale's testimony about the meetings with President Clinton.  A message slip from President Clinton indicates that he wants to meet with McDougal on a Saturday in January.  Mr. McDougal claimed he does not know if he told Hale about that meeting, but he believes he did not.1093  Another message slip indicates that Mr. McDougal called President Clinton on the Friday following the Saturday meeting.  Mr. McDougal claimed that he does not know why he called the Governor on that day.1094  Mr. McDougal also did not recall why the Governor called him on February 3, 1986.1095

<H3>PART VI.     THE LENDING ACTIVITIES OF PERRY COUNTY BANK IN THE 1990 CLINTON GUBERNATORIAL CAMPAIGN  </H3>   

<P>S. Res 120 &#167; 1 (b)(3)(G) authorized the Special Committee to Investigate Whitewater Development Corporation and Related Matters to investigate the "lending activities of Perry County Bank, Perryville, Arkansas, in connection with the 1990 Arkansas gubernatorial election."
<P>The Committee began its investigation into these lending activities by subpoenaing documents from a number of agencies and individuals.   Although the Committee did receive relevant records, it did not complete a comprehensive examination of this matter.  The Committee deferred to the Office of the Independent Counsel's concerns and has decided to not hold public hearings, or compile a public record on this matter.  
<P>The Office of the Independent counsel stated in letters dated April 30, 1996 and May 13, 1996, in response to the Special Committee inquiries of March 28, 1996 and April 18, 1996, that its investigation would be hindered if the Committee examined a number of witnesses regarding Perry County Bank.  Also, as requested in a June 12, 1996 letter from the Independent Counsel, the Committee has not included matters relating to the Perry County Bank in its report.   
<P>In the interest of ensuring the ability of the Independent Counsel to pursue its investigation the Committee deferred to the request of the Independent Counsel and did not pursue matters relating to the Perry County Bank.  It is unfortunate that the Committee could not fully complete its mandate under S. Res. 120.  Nevertheless the Committee does not wish to impede or hinder the efforts of the Independent Counsel, or create a situation that may impinge on the rights of any individual to receive a fair trial.

<H3>ENDNOTES FOR PART 1:  THE FOSTER PHASE</H3>

    1 Elsewhere in his notes, Mr. Foster wrote:<BR>
<P>A.<P>Colo analysis was of economic loss
<P><P>(1)  did not take into account interest deductions
<P><P>(2)  calculation included some items for which there were no canceled cks.
Williams & Connolly Document DKSN000517.  "Colo analysis" was an apparent reference to the Lyons report.
    2 In a later interview with the FBI, Ms. Seidman acknowledged that she worked with Foster on "accusations concerning shorted health positions taken by HILLARY CLINTON in connection with Value Partners."  II Hearings, p. 1794. 
    3 See, e.g., Stefan Fatsis, Stocks Sink on Clinton Economic Plan, Associated Press, Feb. 16, 1993 ("Pharmaceutical stocks led yesterday's decline.  Clinton week accused drug companies of price gouging and made them a prime target of health care reform efforts").  A detailed University of Michigan study concluded that the public pronouncements of the Clintons criticizing pharmaceutical firms depressed stock prices of those firms by as much as 27 percent.  S. Craig Pirrong, Political Rhetoric and Stock Price Volatility:  A Case Study, Catalyst Institute Research Project, University of Michigan, November 1993.
    4 In reality, the number of lawyers in the Bush administration was about 14, the same as under President Reagan.  Jeremy Rabkin, "At the President's Side: The Role of the White House Counsel in Constitutional Policy," Law and Contemporary Problems, Volume 56, Autumn 1993, at 63, 71 n. 39.  Although the official directory of the Clinton White House lists, in addition to the Counsel and his deputy, only several Associate Counsels, the staff actually includes about 13 lawyers.  Id. at 71, n. 39.  According to one commentator, "Official listings of the White House staff never give the full number of lawyers because extra lawyers are usually `detailed' from departments to circumvent congressional restrictions or concerns about excessive size of the full time staff."  Ibid.
    5 It is illustrative to compare Mr. Nussbaum's vision of the White House Counsel with that of his successor, Lloyd Cutler, who said upon his appointment:

<P>The Counsel is supposed to be counsel for the President in office and for the Office of the Presidency. . . .  When it comes to a President's private affairs, particularly private affairs that occurred before he took office, those should be handled by his own personal private counsel and, in my view, not by the White House Counsel.

Remarks Announcing the Appointment of Lloyd Cutler as Special Counsel to the President and an Exchange with Reporter, 30 Wkly Comp. Pres. Document 462, 465 (Mar. 8, 1994).
    6 The remainder of the index was redacted.
    7 All the other materials on the index, as in the first index, had been redacted.
    8 A file labelled "WHITEWATER DEVELOPMENT, Personal and Confidential   VWF" was transferred from Foster's office to the Clintons' personal lawyers.
    9 Likewise, neither Mr. Spafford's nor Mr. Sloan's notes listed Mr. Foster's personal diary during the transition period--which Park Police investigator John Rolla later reviewed, Rolla, 6/20/95 Dep. p. 96--or Foster's notebook on the Travelgate scandal, White House Documents F000002-F000162, which Mr. Nussbaum apparently removed from Mr. Foster's briefcase on July 22, 1993, and kept in a safe until March, 1994.  Letter from Abner J. Mikva, Counsel to the President, to Hon. William F. Clinger, Chairman, House Committee on Government Reform & Oversight, August 30, 1995, p. 1.
    10 Like Mr. Nussbaum, the President and Mrs. Clinton have denied knowledge of Foster's work involving Whitewater.  Following are excerpts from a deposition of President Clinton by former Special Counsel Robert Fiske:

<P>Q:  Was he [Foster] during this period of time working on any matters for you personally?
<P>A:  Yes, I believe that he was trying to handle the transition of our assets into a blind trust.  I think that's all he was doing.
<P>Q:  Were you aware that he was also doing some work in connection with the preparation and filing of the tax returns for Whitewater for '90, '91, and '92?
<P>A:  I don't recall that I was aware of that, no.
Fiske received the same testimony from the First Lady:
<P>Q:  Was he [Foster] doing any personal work for you or the President other than the blind trust?
<P>A:  Not that I'm aware of, no.  Oh, wait.  The only thing I would add to that is I think he also did some personal advising, or at least was in some way involved in the tax returns when they were being finalized for '93, but that was part of the blind trust work, as I recall.
<P>Q:  Your own tax returns?
<P>A:  Yes.
<P>Q:  Was he doing work, to your knowledge, with respect to the filing of the Whitewater tax returns?
<P>A:  Not that I know of, no.

It is unclear whether Mrs. Clinton's answer to Mr. Fiske's question encompassed Mr. Foster's work on the Clintons' personal returns relating to their tax liability for Whitewater.  In her interview with the FBI, Ms. Seidman reported that she attended meetings with the Clintons' personal lawyers at Williams & Connolly on the treatment of the 1992 sale of Whitewater on the Clintons' 1993 tax returns.
    11 The Special Committee on September 15, 1995, issued a subpoena to Bell Atlantic requesting identification of the person or entity registered to that number.  On September 27, 1995, the phone company replied with records indicating that the number was not registered as in service on July 20, 1993.  After additional review, Bell Atlantic advised the Special Committee on November 28, 1995, that it was unable to determine to whom 202-628-7087 was registered in July 1993.  Representatives of the telephone company speculated that the number may have been an auxiliary number for which it did not maintain separate billing records, or that the number may have been confidentially assigned to the White House for secured use.  Similarly, the White House advised the Special Committee on November 15 and November 28, 1995, that it was unable to identify the person whom Mrs. Clinton called on July 20, 1993.

    12 On December 5, 1995, Chairman D'Amato wrote to the White House that "[t]he Special Committee now has reason to believe that the number may have been used by the White House Communications Agency as a secure telephone line."  
    13 However, a Park Police report of an interview with Mr. Nussbaum on July 22, 1993, noted that Mr. Nussbaum stated the search for a suicide note with Patsy Thomasson lasted from 2200 hours to 2400 hours.  Park Police Document 29.
    14 Mr. Nussbaum testified that although he does not remember, he "might have gotten up and walked out and come back."  Nussbaum, 7/12/95 Dep. p. 38.
    15 The only possible exception may be the brief moment when, according to Ms. Thomasson, Ms. Williams left and Mr. Nussbaum entered the office for the second time.
    16 The standard procedure for the cleaning staff was to exit whenever a White House staff member enters his or her office.  S. Hrg. 7/26/95 p. 13.
    17 Officer O'Neill initially did not know who Ms. Thomasson was, but later identified her.  O'Neill, 7/26/95 Hrg. p. 19.
    18  Ms. Williams' attorney submitted an affidavit stating that he "arranged to have Ms. Williams polygraphed" by a private polygrapher.  Anderson, 7/31/95 Dep. Exh. 1.  The affidavit represented that this private "examination confirmed that Ms. Williams was truthful in her assertion that she did not remove any documents from Mr. Foster's office on the night of his death."  Anderson, 7/31/95 Dep. Exh. 1.  After receiving the favorable results from her private polygrapher, Ms. Williams then offered to submit to a polygraph examination on the same subject by the Office of the Independent Counsel.  According to Ms. Williams' attorney, the Independent Counsel's polygrapher advised him at the conclusion of the test that "Ms. Williams was truthful in her assertion that she did not remove any documents from Mr. Foster's office on the night of his death."  Anderson, 7/31/95 Dep. Exh. 1.

    19 Mr. Nussbaum explained that, although he locked and alarmed the suite, he did not remember calling the Secret Service to report that he had done so.  Thus, "you can lock the office and turn on the alarm without making that call.  And if you do it without making that call, they may get, the Secret Service log may get the wrong name."  Nussbaum, 8/10/95 Hrg. p. 125.  This explanation is unpersuasive.  It fails to explain why Officer O'Neill was identified on Secret Service logs as the person who set the alarm in the Counsel's suite -- a position consistent with Officer O'Neill's testimony.
    20 The report was written and submitted to the Director of the FBI on July 22, 1993.  Although it is not possible from the time stamp on the document to determine whether the report was received at around 9:00 in the morning or in the evening of July 22, the text of the report makes clear that it was written prior to any FBI activity at the White House on July 22.
    21 The notes were dictated in July 1993 and typed up later.  Monaco, 7/6/95 Dep. pp. 26-27.
<P>22 Ms. Gorham actually testified that, to the best of her recollection, this incident occurred the week after Mr. Foster's funeral.  Gorham, 8/1/95 Hrg. p. 16.  
<P>23 Mr. Heymann's view finds support from independent commentators.  See, e.g., Jeffrey K. Shapiro, Bernard Nussbaum's Novel View of Privilege, Washington Times, August 30, 1995, p. A15; Lester Brickman, Foster's Paper: What Executive Privilege? New York Times, August 2, 1995, p. A19. 
<P>24 It has been reported, however, that a panel of experts--including a forensics authority from Oxford University--concluded that the note was not in Mr. Foster's hand.  See, e.g., Christopher Ruddy, "Experts Say Foster `Suicide' Note Forged," Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, Oct. 25, 1995.  Because the White House and the Foster family's attorney did not provide the Special Committee with obtain original samples of Mr. Foster's handwriting, the Special Committee was not able to conduct an investigation into this matter.
<P>25 After providing this testimony, Mr. Nussbaum consulted with counsel.  When the deposition resumed, Mr. Nussbaum revised his testimony:  "As I indicated in my testimony, look back at the record, I'm not certain I even had this discussion with Ms. Williams.  I'm not positive.  It's either Ms. Williams or Mr. Neuwirth I had a discussion with."  Nussbaum, 7/13/95 Dep. p. 409.
After the note was turned over to law enforcement authorities, Mr. Heymann referred it to the Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) and the Criminal Division of the Justice Department with the following directive: 

<P>I would like OPR to review the assertion in the notes dealing with he FBI and to give me its recommendation as to what, if any, further inquiry is necessary and appropriate.  I would like the Criminal Division to review the other assertions in the notes and to give me its recommendation as to what, if any, further inquiry is necessary and appropriate. 

Justice Department Document D 000057.
<P>27 Entry and exit records for the White House and the Residence indicate that July 27 was the only day in the week following Mr. Foster's death when Mrs. Clinton, Ms. Thomases, and Mr. Hubbell were in the White House or the Residence together.
<P>28 A later FBI analysis of the pieces of the note concluded:  "The specimens were examined and one latent palm print of value was developed on one piece of paper, part of Q1."  Justice Department Document FBI-00000079.  The latent palm print is unidentified.  
<P>29 During debates on the bill, sponsored by Senators Hatch, Simon, and Dodd, one senator noted that polygraph tests are "not much better than a toss of the coin in many instances." (134 Cong. Rec. S1794, S1800 (March 3, 1988)).  Others observed that "[l]ie detectors are inherently unreliable," (134 Cong. Rec. S1713, S1737 (March 2, 1988)) and that "polygraph tests cannot accurately distinguish truthful statement from lies." (134 Cong. Rec. S1638, S1647 (March 1, 1988)).  
<P>30 Louis I. Rovner, "The Accuracy of Physiological Detection of Deception for Subjects with Prior Knowledge," 15 Polygraph p. 1 (1986).
<P>31 The White House identified the telephone extension which Thomases called as that of Margaret Williams and her assistant, Evelyn Lieberman.  Ms. Williams, however, testified that the extension is the general number for her office, to which a number of other individuals had access.  Williams, 7/26/95 Hrg. p. 233.  The White House later advised the Special Committee that all individuals who had access to that extension did not recall talking to Thomases on July 22, 1993.  Letter from Jane Sherburne to Michael Chertoff and Richard Ben-Veniste, August 4, 1995; Letter from Jane Sherburne to Robert Giuffra, August 6, 1995; Letter from Jane Sherburne to Robert Giuffra, August 8, 1995.  Both Ms. Lieberman and Ms. Williams testified that they likewise did not recall talking with Ms. Thomases.  Williams, 7/7/95 Dep. p. 58.  Ms. Thomases, however, testified that she recalled having conversations with Ms. Williams on July 21 and 22.  Thomases, 7/17/95 Dep. p. 109.
<P>32 At a press conference on April 22, 1994, Mrs. Clinton was asked whether Margaret Williams was among those who removed documents from Foster's office.  She replied: "I don't think that she did remove any documents."  White House Document Z 000107.  On August 2, 1994, Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers affirmed Mrs. Clintons's statement: "I think that it is true that Maggie didn't remove any documents from Vince's office; they were removed by Bernie Nussbaum."  White House Document Z 000578.  
<P>33<P> Similarly, when asked by the RTC-IG about this same February 2, 1994, meeting, Mr. Ickes testified: "Mr. Altman, as I recall, raised the issue of the upcoming--the possible--well, not the possible, but the fact that the statute of limitations, which I knew nothing about at the time, of the RTC in connection with an investigation that was apparently being conducted by the RTC on Madison Whitewater was about to expire."  (Ickes, 7/15/94 RTC Dep. p. 7).  Mr. Ickes emphasized that White House officials had no knowledge of the statute of limitations issue:  "There were questions about the statute of limitations, when it expired, under what conditions it expired.  I don't think anybody in the room other than Mr. Altman and Ms. Hanson had a clear picture of what the statute of limitations situation was."  (Ickes, 7/15/94 RTC Dep. p. 8).

<P>34<P> Mr. Kendall based this assertion on the fact that Mr. Denton testified at two trials, Ward v. Madison Guaranty, and United States v. McDougal et al., yet did not mention his April 7, 1986 telephone conversation with Mrs. Clinton.  Mr. Kendall, however, offered no indication whether Mr. Denton was asked questions about his conversations with Mrs. Clinton or, for that matter, whether such conversations and Mrs. Clinton's work for Madison were within the scope of the trials. (Letter from David Kendall to Senator Alfonse D'Amato, 6/17/96 p. 2)

<P>What is clear, however, is that Mr. Denton recalled the conversation only after being shown Mrs. Clinton's billing records refelcting the 12 minute telephone call on April 7.  When he was shown this record, on June 3, 1996, he did not recall the conversation.  However, after the interview, he reviewed his files and discovered the April 7 message slip from Mrs. Clinton.  His memory thus refreshed, he provided additional testimony to the FDIC-IG, all under a legal obligation of truthfulness, 18 U.S.C.  1001.  (Denton, FDIC-IG Report of Interview, June 11, 1996.)  Mr. Denton has no reason to mislead investigators, much less to go out of his way to give inaccurate testimony.
<P>35<P> On June 13, 1996, the Special Committee requested that Mrs. Clinton respond in writing, under oath, about "any knowledge she may have concerning the Rose Law Firm billing records bearing Bates Stamp numbers DKSN028928 through DKSN029043, including whether she has reviewed, handled, or discussed (other than with counsel) these records, and her knowledge relating to the disappearance or discovery of the records."

<P>On June 17, 1996, Mrs. Clinton responded: "I do not know how the billing records (DKSN028928 through DKSN029043) came to be identified by Mrs. Huber at the White House on January 4, 1996, although I have read various media accounts."  In light of the Special Committee's request for detailed and specific information relating to any knowledge she had concerning their disappearance or discovery, Mrs. Clinton's answer is incomplete.  For example, she does not state whether she has any knowledge as to how the billing records were removed from the Rose Law Firm; who possessed the billing records between February 1992 and August 1995; where they were stored between February 1992 and August 1995; and, most importantly, who placed them in the Book Room of the White House in August 1995.  There is no mystery as to how Ms. Huber came to identify the records on January 4, 1996.  These other, more important questions, however, remain to be answered.

<P>Mrs. Clinton's incomplete response, therefore, does not alter the Special Committee's conclusion.
<P>36<P> Another suspect identified in the referral, Larry Kuca, pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of conspiracy to misapply funds.
<P>37<P> The RTC's Professional Liability Section was responsible for handling civil claims relating to the legal liability of professionals, such as accountants, appraisers, and attorneys.  (Lewis, 10/30/95 Dep. p. 125.) 
<P>38<P> Ms. Lewis testified that she did not intend to record the conversation initially.  She testified that the tape recorder turned itself on, and that at some point during the conversation she noticed that it was on but chose to continue the recording.  (Lewis, 10/30/95 Dep. pp. 157-158, 196-197.)  

<P>Ms. Breslaw was unaware that the conversation was being recorded.  (Breslaw, 11/30/95 Hrg. p. 69.)

<P>Ms. Lewis turned the original tape over to the Office of the Independent Counsel ("OIC") on March 31, 1994.  (Lewis, 10/30/95 Dep. p. 241.)  The OIC produced a copy of the tape to the Special Committee on November 20, 1995.   
<P>39<P> Ms. Lewis testified that because she believed "there was an effort underway to control, manipulate and even obstruct the Madison investigation," she met with Rep. Leach on February 18, 1994, and played the tape for him.  (Lewis, 11/29/95 Hrg. p. 23); (Lewis, 10/30/95 Dep. p. 236.)

<P>40<P> In prior testimony, Mr. Ryan has stated that he has no recollection of indicating to anyone at the RTC that he would prefer to be able to say that Whitewater did not cause losses to Madison.  (Ryan, 6/21/95 Dep. p. 42.)  Ms. Kulka has also testified that she never indicated to Ms. Breslaw that she would prefer to be able to say that Whitewater did not cause a loss to Madison.  (Kulka, 6/23/95 Dep. p. 31.)
<P>41<P> Patrick I. Noble, the former Deputy Assistant Inspector General for the RTC, testified that Mr. Adair advised him of this conversation.  (Noble, 10/20/95 Dep. pp. 33-34.)  Mr. Noble recalled that Mr. Adair had said that "it was not appropriate for the Inspector General's office to search those offices, and I believe he said he didn't believe there was any basis for that."  (Noble, 10/20/95 Dep. p. 28.)  Mr. Noble added that Mr. Adair's response was that a search would have been "[i]nappropriate in the sense [that] there was no legal basis for it."  (Noble, 10/20/95 p.28).
<P>42<P> On August 17 and 19, 1993, approximately two weeks before his meeting with Ms. Casey, Mr. Coleman discussed with Associate White House Counsel William Kennedy the federal investigation of Mr. Hale.  (Coleman, 11/9/95 Dep. pp. 63-65; Coleman, 12/1/95 Hrg. pp. 10-16; Kennedy, 12/05/95 Hrg. pp. 11-16).  

<P>Mr. Kennedy's contemporaneous notes of the two conversations clearly indicate that Mr. Coleman mentioned President Clinton, Mr. Tucker, Madison Guaranty, Whitewater, Southloop and Castle Grande.  This documentary evidence adds further credibility to Mr. Coleman's version of the September 7, 1993 meeting.
<P>43<P> Q: Well, when you pulled the referral, you saw that the referral, in fact, had not been acted upon in Washington but had been returned to Little Rock for purposes of a final decision; correct?

<P>A: No, that's not the way I look at it--my view of that at the time was that it had been acted upon in the sense that it had been reviewed and that the opinion of the Department was it was not a good referral and should not be prosecuted.  But that decision had never been relayed to RTC.

<P>Q: Didn't the memo actually indicate that although there would be no objection if the Little Rock office declined prosecution, it was to be a decision left in the hands of the Little Rock U.S. Attorney's office?

<P>A: That's what--that was--after I pulled Keeney's memo back out that was what I saw in his memo.

<P>Q: So you understood?
<P>
<P>A: Would not question the decision to decline, but there was no reason for the office to be recused.
<P>
<P>Q: So it became your decision; right?
<P>
<P>A: Yes.(Casey, 11/01/95 Dep. p. 183).

<P>45<P> Mr. Kennedy claimed that Mr. Nussbaum did not instruct him to speak with Mr. Hubbell, and that he did not report back to Mr. Nussbaum his conversation with Mr. Hubbell.  (Kennedy, 12/5/95 Hrg. p. 104.)
<P>46<P> Mr. Blair's memory lapse, however, appeared to be selective because he did recall other portions of his alleged conversation with Mr. Heuer.  (Blair, 11/20/95 Dep. 11-14.)  Mr. Blair also recalled another conversation with Mr. Heuer, most likely prior to Mr. Hale's indictment, in which Mr. Heuer informed him that "Hale had supposedly been to see McDougal and tried to get McDougal to lie about various things that Hale wanted to claim was reality."  (Blair, 11/20/95 Dep. p. 13)  This other conversation between Mr. Blair and Mr. Heuer corresponds to a separate entry in the same page of Mr. Lindsey's notes. (Hogan & Hartson Document BL011718-011722.)
<P>47<P> One margin note stated: "BC has no recollection."  Willkie, Farr & Gallagher Document ST000047.
<P>48   The notes appear as follows in the White House's typed version of Mr. Kennedy's notes: 

"III.<P>RTC referral w/r/t McDougal 

<P>Included a reference to 4 campaign checks 
<P>4/85 BC personally 

<P>Campaign Committee 

<P>3 checks written on Madison--all $3,000 
<P>4th check on McDougal personally--signed by Susan 
<P>McDougal." (White House Document S12530). 

Later, his notes reflect the following entry: 

"Charles Peacock - proceeds went from Charles 
<P><P>for Clinton campaign - 85 

<P><P>made a donation (?)  

$3,000 - $12,000 * Could all come from Charles Peacock

<P><P>Charles Peacock (Ken Peacock?) 

$1500 per election - $3,000 

<P><P>Primary and general." (White House Document S12534).
<P>49   At the very beginning of Mr. Kennedy's notes appears the following entry: 

"HRC representation of Madison - not much activity representing 
people before agencies   
2 RLF letters Beverly Bassett

Later, in his notes, there is an entry related to the Rose Law Firm's retainer: 

"+ RLF - Madison Guaranty - Retainer at $2,000 per month  

<P>ANN + Check drawn on WWDC - payable to HRC  

<P>Bernie + Believe that it believes prob. represents

<P>[15 months for $2,000 per month - Retainer] 
Webb Hubbell."  (White House Document S12533)
<P>50  Mr. Kennedy's notes show: 

"Blair could have knowledge  
  Could be source of money 
  to allow McD to purchase stock." (White House Document S12531.)  

On the same page, the following entry appears: 
"3/4 Times<P> Heuer<P> Blair contact 
<P><P><P>Heuer 
<P><P>2/3, 1992<P>Have 1
<P><P><P>Involved w/VF

<P>51<P> Mr. Kennedy's notes read: 

"Not Reconstruction - 
<P>$11,000 -

Clinton not released until Fall of 1992 

Blair up - Chris Wade." (White House Document S12537).  

Although Mr. Wade assumed the McDougal's interest in Whitewater in 1985, the Clintons were not released from their obligation until the balance of the debt was paid off.
<P>52<P> The following entry appears in Mr. Kennedy's notes: 

"Report:<P> Clinton had taken the deductions that WWDC had not 
<P><P>taken  
<P><P>Tax advantage of $2500  
<P><P>Not repay government yet promise." (White House Document S12529).
<P>53<P> Mr. Kennedy's notes indicate the following discussion: 

"End of '86 - asked for records

     54      After Mr. Hale's allegations against the President was made public, the Capital Management investigation predictably attracted considerable attention.  On November 4, 1993, Congressman John LaFalce, the Chairman of the House Committee on Small Business, wrote to Mr. Bowles and requested "a full written report on Capital Management Services, Inc., including its licensing, private capital, ownership, SBA leverage, and individual financings made, including profit and loss statements." (SBA Document Not numbered).  In addition, Chairman LaFalce asked that the SBA provide, under section 10(e) of the Small Business Act, the staff director and counsel of the Committee on Small Business with copies of the SBA's files on Capital Management. (SBA Document Not numbered).<BR>
     55      Instead of sending someone connected with the White House, the defense team discussed sending John Tisdale, Mr. Lindsey's former law partner; Skip Rutherford, a 1992 Clinton presidential official who continued to informally assist the White House regarding public relations aspects of Whitewater; a New York lawyer friend of Paul Begala; and Jack Quinn, Chief of Staff to Vice President Gore.  (Rutherford, 2/29/96 Dep., pp. 5-10, 21-23; White House Document S020577.)<BR>
     56      Mr. Ickes notes of the Whitewater Response Team tasking memorandum included the task of researching whether the President used pressure to aid Madison Guaranty--one of the issues involving Ms. Schaffer's actions. (Ickes, 2/22/96, Hrg. pp. 86-87.)<BR>
     57   In addition to contacts with persons from Arkansas, the Schaffers attended a movie at the White House on January 28, 1994 at 8:30 p.m.  Attendees included, among others, the President, the First Lady, Mr. Lindsey, and Paul Berry, a close friend and confidant of the President.  Mr. Berry was also a close friend of the Schaffers and has known the Bassett family since the early 1950s.  (Berry, 5/10/96, Dep. p. 59.)<BR>
     58      Mr. Wade produced documents to the Special Committee, but exercised his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination when the Special Committee sent him a subpoena ad testificandum.<BR>
     59      Meanwhile, Frank Burge, James Patterson, and Robert Ritter, all of whom were Presidents of Citizen's Bank of Flippin ("Citizen's Bank") at one time during the existence of the Whitewater loan, provided substantial testimony to the Special Committee on the initial Whitewater loan made by Citizen's Bank.  Mr. Burge testified that the Clintons and the McDougals never notified Citizen's Bank that the $20,000 down payment on the Whitewater loan was borrowed from another bank, Union National Bank, and, thus, Citizen's Bank was not aware that the Clintons and McDougals invested no money into the original mortgage. (Burge, 5/8/96 Hrg. pp. 19-20.)<BR></P>

<P>     Mr. Ritter testified that he had two meetings with Mrs. Clinton between 1979 and 1982 about the Whitewater mortgage.  Mr. Ritter testified that Mrs. Clinton asked several questions about the loans and interest rates and seemed quite knowledgeable about the transaction. (Ritter, 5/8/96 Hrg. pp. 34-35.)<BR></P>

<P>     Paul Berry and Donald Denton, Senior Vice Presidents of Union National Bank, also provided illuminating testimony to the Special Committee.  Mr. Berry testified that President Clinton approached him about making the $20,000 loan for the down payment on the Whitewater property.  Mr. Denton testified that either Mr. Berry, or another bank official, instructed him to make the $20,000 unsecured loan--against his better judgment. (Denton, 5/8/96 Hrg. p. 66.)<BR></P>

<P>     After the discovery of the Rose Law Firm billing records in the White House Residence in January 1996, the FDIC Inspector General reexamined Mr. Denton.  His memory refreshed, Mr. Denton specifically recalled an April 7, 1986 telephone conversation with Mrs. Clinton relating to Castle Grande, a sham transaction.  During the conversation, Mr. Denton cautioned Mrs. Clinton that the transaction may pose a problem because they could violate an Arkansas banking regulation.  According to Mr. Denton, Mrs. Clinton "summarily dismissed" Mr. Denton's warning.  She replied in a manner he took to mean that "he would take care of savings and loan matters, and she would take care of legal matters." (Denton, 6/11/96 FDIC-OIG Interview, p. 3.)<BR>
     60      Mr. Eggleston incorrectly identified March 2, 1989, as the date on which the statute of limitations began to run for Madison-related civil claims.  The RTC was appointed conservator of Madison on February 28, 1989, and actual intervention occurred on March 2, 1989.  The statute of limitations began to run on "the date of the appointment of the Corporation as conservator or receiver."  12 U.S.C. 1821(d)(14)(B)(i) (1995).<BR>
     61   Phone logs kept by Mr. Cutler's office indicate that Mr. Knight called Mr. Cutler on July 15, 1994 and that Mr. Cutler spoke with Mr. Knight on July 18, July 20, July 21 and July 22.  (White House Documents S007922, S007923, S007924, S007928 and S007929.)<BR>
     62 In addition, Ms. Sherburne first requested that White House attorneys be able to sit in on OIG depositions.  Ms. Black strongly opposed this suggestion, because she wanted to keep the investigation independent, and she stated, "if we agreed to have them (the White House Counsel) sitting in on the interviews, that would be contrary to our standard method of conducting investigations."  (Black, 10/12/95 Dep. 77.)  Ms. Black stated that "although we conduct all investigations by the book, this one, above all other investigations, had to be conducted by the book in order to give any validity to whatever we found.  (Black, 10/12/95 Dep. p. 62.)  <BR>
     63 The summaries were prepared when the OGC knew that the IG objected to the transfer of transcripts. (Dougherty, 11/8/95 Hrg/. p. 156.)  Mr. Cottos testified that he had not been consulted about the propriety of the summaries.(Cottos, 11/8/95 Hrg. p. 29.)  Not surprisingly, Ms. Kerner was aware that Mr. McHale and others in the OGC, were working on the summaries, and was actually given a copy of them. (Kerner, 11/8/95 Hrg. p. 29.)  Sarah Jones, a Tres. OGC attorney who worked on the team that summarized the transcripts, reported directly to John Bowman, Jean Hanson's Assistant General Counsel for Banking and Finance. (Dougherty, 11/6/95 Dep. p. 27.)  Mr. Bowman was also a fact witness in the investigation.<BR>
     64      On May 20, 1996, more than six months after he testified before the Special Committee, Mr. Cutler provided the Special Committee with a letter in which he sought to recast the sworn testimony that he gave on both August 5, 1995, before the Senate Banking Committee, and on November 9, 1995, before the Special Committee.<BR>
     65      Chairman D'Amato:  "I suggest to you that, when you come as the White House counsel and you say that informally that we have been -- we being the White House -- White House officials have the blessing of the Office of Government Ethics as it relates to no violations of any ethical standards occurred, and thereafter every -- just about every White House official comes in and waves it, that was just not accurate.<BR></P>

<P>     Mr. Cutler:  What I said in my testimony before you on August the 5th was that the OGE had reviewed the factual findings of the Treasury Inspector General and issued its formal opinion concurring that no violation of any ethical standard -- these are the so-called standards of ethical conduct for the executive branch -- occurred by any current Treasury or RTC official.  Then I said, I have reached the same conclusions as to White House officials, and based on the facts as I reported to them to this nonpartisan Office of Government Ethics, that office has informally concurred.  Now that may have been where I transgressed. (Cutler, 11/9/95 Hrg. pp. 33-34.)<BR>
     66      Mr. Kendall based this assertion on the fact that Mr. Denton testified at two trials, Ward v. Madison Guaranty, and United States v. McDougal et al., yet did not mention his April 7, 1986 telephone conversation with Mrs. Clinton.  Mr. Kendall, however, offered no indication whether Mr. Denton was asked questions about his conversations with Mrs. Clinton or, for that matter, whether such conversations and Mrs. Clinton's work for Madison were within the scope of the trials.<BR></P>

<P>     What is clear, however, is that Mr. Denton recalled the conversation only after being shown Mrs. Clinton's billing records refelcting the 12 minute telephone call on April 7.  When he was shown this record, on June 3, 1996, he did not recall the conversation.  However, after the interview, he reviewed his files and discovered the April 7 message slip from Mrs. Clinton.  His memory thus refreshed, he provided additional testimony to the FDIC-IG, all under a legal obligation of truthfulness, 18 U.S.C.  1001.  (Denton, FDIC-IG Report of Interview, June 11, 1996.)  Mr. Denton has no reason to mislead investigators, much less to go out of his way to give inaccurate testimony.<BR>
     67      The Rose Law Firm resisted the RTC OIG's investigation.  After Rose declined a request to provide client identity information, the OIG issued a subpoena calling for the production of documents that would establish the identities of Rose's clients between 1985 and 1994.  In April 1994, Rose filed suit against the RTC and the OIG, seeking to enjoin the OIG's conflicts investigation and bar enforcement of the subpoena.  The suit was dismissed in August 1994.  In November 1994, a federal district court ordered Rose to comply with the subpoena.  See Adair v. Rose Law Firm, 867 F. Supp. 1111 (D.D.C. 1994); (RTC OIG Report p. I-1 - I-2; Black, 8/10/95 Hrg. pp. 119-121.)<BR>
     68      Susan Thomases testified that she talked with Mr. Hubbell in 1992 about Mrs. Clinton's work for Madison, and he indicated to her that he had reviewed time records.  With respect to reviewing the records herself, however, Ms. Thomases testified, "I never saw them....I never heard what happened to them."  (Thomases, 12/18/95 Hrg. pp. 54-55.)<BR>

<H3>ENDNOTES FOR PART 3:  THE ARKANSAS PHASE</H3><BR>


<P>1 Although the documents are signed by Mr. and Mrs. McDougal, but are not signed by President Clinton, the information reported by the Clintons on their 1978 federal income tax return corresponds exactly with the cost and date information on the purchase agreement and installment note, indicating that the transaction was consummated on January 25, 1977. (See Williams & Connolly Prod. DKSN022069; Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document LP01547.) <BR>
<P>2 There is no independent documentary evidence that the $400 down payment was made, but a deposit ticket from 1st Jacksonville Bank of Jacksonville, Arkansas indicates that Rolling Manor Inc. deposited a $155.51 payment by then-Attorney General Clinton into its bank account on April 22, 1977. (Williams & Connolly Document DKSN022068; Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document LP01546).<BR>
<P>3 The deposit ticket, which was stamped by the bank, indicates that the outstanding balance on the note was $10,917.82, consistent with what the balance of the note would be after the first monthly payment of $155.51 is applied to interest and principal. Williams & Connolly Prod. DKSN022068; Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document LP01546.<BR>
<P>4 Based on information reported in their 1977 federal income tax return, the Clintons' adjusted gross income in 1977 was just $41,731.  After accounting for adjusted itemized deductions ($9,688) and other adjustments, e.g., federal taxes withheld, ($8,835), the Clintons' disposable income in 1977 was $23,208, before any expenditures for such items as principal payments on their mortgage, food, and clothing.  Thus, a $9,500 payment would have equaled more than 40 percent of their total disposable income in 1977. <BR>
<P>5   Mr. Ritter's recollection of these meeting is vague, and if these meeting were held to execute loan renewals, the dates of these meetings do not comport with the available documentary evidence.  If both of these meetings were convened to execute loan renewal documents it is possible that they occurred one or two years later than Mr. Ritter recollects (for instance the interest rate first increased in 1980, but did not increase significantly until 1981).  Mr. Ritter left Citizen's Bank at the end of 1983.<BR>
<P>6 The remaining $6,052 balance of Mrs. Clinton's loan was paid off in two payments-- one in the amount of $285 from the man who had purchased the property from Mrs. Clinton, and the other, $5,797, from an unknown payor.<BR>
<P>7 On November 1, 1989, Mr. Wade filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.  On August 27, 1990, Mr. Wade's bankruptcy was converted to an involuntary bankruptcy under Chapter 7.   Wade's involuntary bankruptcy remained open as late as 1995. ( 4/24/95 Pillsbury Report p. 124).<BR>
<P>8 Elsewhere in his notes, Mr. Foster wrote:<BR>
<P>A.<P>Colo analysis was of economic loss<BR>
<P><P>(1)  did not take into account interest deductions<BR>
<P><P>(2)  calculation included some items for which there were no canceled cks.<BR>

<P>14<P> There is also no evidence that the Clintons had an obligation to repay, or did repay, Whitewater.  Whitewater's books for the year ending May 31, 1981 do not show that the corporation reduced the Clintons' notes payable that was established when the land was transferred into the corporation.  Nor do they show that the corporations recorded a receivable from the Clintons.  Haddon Morgan & Foreman Documents LP 01957-69.<BR>

<P>16<P> Betsey Wright, who ran Governor Clinton's 1984 campaign, testified that $30,500 was raised at the event.  (Wright, 1/26/96 Dep. p. 278.)  Ms. Wright, the custodian of records for that campaign, she based that figure on checks from 17 persons or entities that she said had been collected in connection with the fundraiser.  (O'Melveny & Myers Production CCBW-0017-24.)  Mr. McDougal has stated in various interviews that the fundraiser raised about $35,000.  (E.g. New York Times, 12/15/93 p. B8.)  Notes taken by Susan Thomases in 1992 of a conversation she had with Sherry Curry reflect that "MacD FR raised $39,150."  (Willkie Farr & Gallagher Production ST 45.)<BR>
<P>17<P> Senator Fulbright himself could not be interviewed because he had a stroke several years ago and died in February 1995.<BR>
<P>18<P> Mr. Chertoff.  Did Mr. Latham come to you and offer you work for the Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan?<BR>

<P>Mr. Massey.  I don't believe so. <BR>

<P>Mr. Chertoff.  Did Mr. Latham come to you and ask you to help him -- come to you directly, that is to say, before you'd been assigned to the matter, and ask you to help him with an effort by the savings and loan to issue preferred  stock? <BR>

<P>Mr. Massey.  Sir, I don't remember that.  It could have happened, but I don't remember that.<BR>
<P>19   In an interview with RTC investigators, Mr. Latham stated that "McDougal had friends over there and he suggested we use them.  When asked who the friends were Latham said that they were Hillary Rodham Clinton and others."  <BR>
<P>20  Well as I have said consistently since 1992. . . my recollection is that Mr. Massey wanted to do the work he had discussed with Mr. Latham, that some partners, I believe in the securities section, had advised Mr. Massey that they were not enthusiastic about undertaking the representation on behalf of Jim McDougal and Madison because of some problems in having work paid for in the past, and that there were discussions among partners.<BR>

<P>I believe it was Vince Foster who came to me, who said that Mr. Massey wanted to do this work, but the partners didn't want him to do it . . .  And I was asked, as someone who knew McDougal, if I could intervene and perhaps set up an opportunity for Mr. Massey to do this work.<P><BR>

<P>So I talked with Mr. Massey about the work.  Mr. Massey told me, as his testimony relates, that he had a talk with Mr. Latham, but it wasn't up to Mr. Latham, and he wasn't getting any support from others within the firm, and I told him I would talk to Mr. McDougal, which I did.  (1996 Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro Interview of Hillary Rodham Clinton, pp. 27-31, Resolution Trust Corporation Document S-INTV000628-632.)  <BR>

<P>21<P> The Rose Law Firm letter had misspelled Mr. Handley's name; they wrote "Hanley".<BR>
<P>22 In addition, starting on May 14, 1985 and until the end of 1985, the Rose Law Firm attempted to secure approval for a broker-dealer subsidiary for Madison. (Massey, 6/15/95 RTC Statement p. 3).  The proposal was submitted to the Arkansas Savings and Loan Board Association.<BR>
<P>23 The Pillsbury law firm reached the conclusion that "a court might hold that the acquisition, as structured, was fraudulent," and noted that "the use of Seth Ward as a straw has some of the earmarks of a fraudulent or intentional attempt to violate the law."  2/6/96 Pillsbury Report pp. 142, 146.<BR>
<P>24 At trial, Mr. Ward took the position that the notes worth $370,943 was evidence of his entitlement to unpaid commissions, but he denied that the $400,000 loan was related to any commissions.  That loan, he maintained, was separate and fully discharged when he quitclaimed the property securing the mortgage -- Holman Acres -- back to Madison.  12/28/95 Pillsbury Report pp. 31-32.  When the jury returned a verdict for Mr. Ward, it <BR>
<P>25 As with the September 24, 1985 letter, there is a second version of the May 1 option.(RTC Document SW1-070 - SW1-074).  The only substantive difference between the two is that the property at issue in the second option is not Holman Acres, but a 6.67 acre parcel of land containing the Levi Strauss Building.(RTC Document SW1-070 - SW1-074).<BR>
<P>26 Mr. Hubbell stated that "I remember that Mr. Ward would come to my office and on occasion, ask my secretary to type letters that he had handwritten or had been drafted somewhere else."  Hubbell, 2/7/96 Hrg. p. 11.<BR>
<P>27<P> All three were subsequently arrested and convicted for felonies involving drug use and distribution.<BR>
<P>28<P> Mr. Lasater testified that he was first introduced to President Clinton by the President's mother Virginia Kelly at Oaklawn Racing Park in Hot Springs Arkansas in the 1970's.  Lasater, 5/1/96 Hrg. p. 10.<BR>
<P>29<P> Mr. Nash is currently the Director of the White House Personnel Office.<BR>
<P>30<P> Mr. Hardwicke was appointed by Governor Clinton to the AHDA board, and served from 1980 - 1986 or 1987.  Hardwicke, 2/15/96 Dep. p.6.  Mr. Hardwicke testified that he has been a "pretty close" personal friend of Bill Clinton since 1974.  Hardwicke, 2/15/96 Dep. p. 11.<BR>
<P>31<P> The Multi-Family Sub-Committee made this recommendation after considering both oral and written proposals from eight financial firms.  ADFA Document 10/19/95 (Not Numbered).<BR>
<P>32<P> Mitchell Williams billed Lasater & Co. $32,150.93 for legal services performed related to "legislative advice" and the "leasing proposal."  TJ Raney Production 72.<BR>
<P>33<P> The Mitchell Williams attorney who signed the May 16 opinion letter, was Anne Ritchey, one of the lawyers who had performed work for the Lasater group.<BR>
<P>34<P> Mr. Gaines was the governor's office liaison with state public safety agencies.<BR>
<P>35 In May, 1986, Mr. McDougal asked Mr. Hale to substitute another application for the file.  According to Mr. Hale, Mr. McDougal was "real frightened and he was--he said he had to see my file, he had to get the file.  I asked him what the problem was.  He said he was going to have to change the purpose out.  He had prepared another loan application showing the loan for a different purpose and he had to exchange that out, and he had things that were going bad at Madison.  (McDougal trial, p. 3308).  The other application states that "real estate brokerage and land development was Master Marketing's business.  (McDougal trial, p. 3347).  <BR>

Lyons, 11/2/95 Dep. p. 19.<BR>
     Mr. Lyons reviewed the available Whitewater "documents and information...that had been assembled by campaign staff after the issue had been raised by Mr. Jeff Gerth of the New York Times."294294.     Lyons, 6/5/96 Dep. p. 11.  Based on his preliminary analysis of the documents, Mr. Lyons determined that the campaign "needed accounting help to assist in a financial reconstruction."  He "made a recommendation to campaign staff and to Governor and Mrs. Clinton . . . to engage Patten, McCarthy & Associates,"295295.     Lyons, 6/5/96 Dep. p. 10. a Denver financial consulting firm.<BR>
     In early March 1992, Mr. Lyons contacted Leslie Patten, a certified public accountant and president of Patten, McCarthy & Associates,296296.     Patten, 5/31/96 Dep. p. 9. and engaged his firm, on behalf of the Clintons, to conduct "a financial reconstruction of Whitewater Development Corporation from the then available books and records."297297.     Lyons, 11/2/95 Dep. p. 47.  Mr. Lyons and Mr. Patten were "friends" and "had a professional relationship for a number of years."298298.     Lyons, 11/2/95 Dep. p. 47.  Mr. Patten's firm provided "consultation on banking, financial, accounting and tax matters arising from business litigation and expert witness testimony on such issues."299299.     Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document LP01155.  On March 10, 1992 the Patten firm began working on its analysis of Whitewater.300300.     Patten, 5/31/96 Dep. pp. 69-71.  Mr. Patten and Norris Weese, another certified public accountant and the firm's vice president, were the only professionals who performed work on the document that became the final report.301301.     Patten, 5/31/96 Dep. pp. 12-13.  Mr. Weese went to Arkansas to gather documents and began the financial analyses, and Mr. Patten reviewed the financial analyses and drafted the document that became the final report.302302.     Patten, 5/31/96 Dep. pp. 12-13. <BR>
     Work on the so-called Lyons report proceeded rapidly, with the involvement of Mrs. Clinton.  On March 18, 1992, just eight days after the Mr. Patten and Mr. Weese began work on the project, a draft of the final report was completed,303303.     Patten, 5/31/96 Dep. pp. 69-71. and was faxed the next day to Mr. Lyons, Mrs. Clinton, Loretta Lynch and James Hamilton, a lawyer working with Mr. Lyons on the Clinton campaign.304304.     Haddon Morgan & Foreman Documents LP01108-114, LP01115-169 and LP01170-176.  The fax to Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Lynch was 55 pages long and contained over 30 pages of work papers prepared by the Patten firm.  On March 20, a revised draft was faxed to Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Hamilton, and John Klusaritz, another Clinton campaign lawyer.305305.     Haddon Morgan & Foreman Documents LP01177-90.  Later that day, Mr. Patten faxed to Mrs Clinton a revised report, dated March 20, 1992 and addressed to Governor Bill Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton, that contained six type-written pages.  The report was signed by Mr. Patten and Mr. Weese.306306.     Haddon Morgan & Foreman Documents LP01101-107.  According to Mr. Patten, "the substance of the report was pretty much final at that point," but "I think we were premature in signing it because we had not obtained everybody's comments."307307.     Patten, 5/31/96 Dep. p. 75.  During this period, Mr. Patten testified that he "was in fairly regular communication with Mr. Lyons," who "was anxious to get this project completed and was seeking periodic updates as to where we were in the process."308308.     Patten, 5/31/96 Dep. pp. 19-20.<BR>
     Then, on March 20 or March 21, 1992, Mr. Lyons contacted Mr. Patten and told him that he wanted two versions of the report prepared, a summary version that only addressed specific questions raised by the press and a full report addressed to him.  According to Mr. Patten's testimony:<BR>
     It's at this approximate point [in] time when Mr. Lyons advised me that he wanted a summary report prepared. . . .  The essence of it was that Mr. Lyons indicated that he [would] like to have a summary report in addition to the full report which would be addressed to him. . . .  My understanding was that the purpose of the summary report was to address two or three specific questions that had been raised by the press.309309.     Patten, 5/31/96 Dep. pp. 75-77.  <BR>
     Mr. Lyons testified that the Patten firm "prepared a single report and a summary of it"310310.     Lyons, 11/2/95 Dep. p. 103. and that "[o]ne is simply shorter and in my opinion was more responsive to the issues that were then being put forward by the press."311311.     Lyons, 11/2/95 Dep. p. 112.  On March 21, 1992, Mr. Patten faxed a shorter version of the report to Mrs Clinton.312312.     Haddon Morgan & Foreman Documents LP01086-92.  As with the version of the report faxed to Mrs. Clinton the day before, this version of the report, dated March 21, 1992, was addressed to the Clintons and was signed by Mr. Patten and Mr. Weese, but it was almost three pages shorter than the previous day's version.313313.     Haddon Morgan & Foreman Documents LP01086-92.  On March 22, 1992, Mr. Patten faxed even shorter versions of the report, dated March 23, 1992 and signed by Mr. Weese and Mr. Patten, to Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Lynch.314314.     Haddon Morgan & Foreman Documents LP01058-69.  <BR>
     On March 23, 1992, Mr. Patten faxed Mrs. Clinton the final summary version of the Patten firm's report, which contained three type-written pages and two pages of charts.315315.     Haddon Morgan & Foreman Documents LP01115-119. A one page cover letter from Mr. Patten to the Clintons states: "Pursuant to the request of James Lyons, Esq., enclosed please find Patten McCarthy & Associates, Inc's report pursuant to our recent engagement."<BR>
     In a March 23, 1992 letter to the Clintons, Mr. Lyons notified the Clintons that his review of Whitewater had been completed.  He noted the findings of the summary report, including that the Clintons' had "invested approximately $70,000 in the corporation."316316.     Lyons Documents JML 077-78.  The Clinton campaign only released the final summary version of the Patten firm's report to the press,317317.     Lyons, 11/2/95 Dep. p. 112. and Mr. Patten testified that Mr. Lyons "is the only individual that received both versions of the report."318318.     Patten, 5/31/96 Dep. p. 68.<BR>
     On April 10, 1992, Mr. Lyons sent the Clintons the final complete version319319.     Haddon Morgan & Foreman Documents LP01105-14. of the Patten firm's report, which contained seven type-written pages and three pages of charts.320320.     Lyons Documents JML 140.  In his cover letter, Mr. Lyons states:<BR>
     Enclosed please find the complete report prepared by Patten, McCarthy & Associates concerning Whitewater Development.  A summary of this report was previously sent to you and released to the press along with a cover letter from me on March 23, 1992.  I have deferred sending this complete report until now to avoid any confusion or possible inadvertent production.  The only copies of this report which exist (other than the enclosed original) are in my file and the confidential files of Les Patten.321321.     Lyons Documents JML 140.<BR></P>

<P>     He then explained that the summary report omitted several items:<BR></P>

<P>     Please note the enclosed report discusses such things as the $9,000 interest deduction taken by you in 1980, lot 13 and borrowings associated with it, and the sale of 24 lots in 1985 to Ozark Air for assumption of the mortgage and an airplane.  None of these items is set out in the summary report which was released to the press.  Similarly, the summary report released to the press did not contain Schedule 1, which details loans and advances by the McDougals and the Clintons from 1980- 1991.322322.     Lyons Documents JML 140.<BR></P>

<P>     Mr. Lyons concluded his letter by noting: "Accordingly, it is my recommendation to you that you maintain the complete report in strictest confidence and do not waive either the attorney/client or accountant/client privilege which attaches to the enclosed report."(emphasis added)323323.     Lyons Documents JML 140.<BR>
     Mr. Lindsey testified that the complete report was not released to the press as of late 1993.324324.     Lindsey, 6/12/95 Dep. pp. 79-80. According to his testimony, "it turned out later [after late 1993] at least one reporter, through other sources, probably Independent Counsel, who knows, reported on the longer version of the Lyons report, but at that time I don't think anyone had reported on it."325325.     Lindsey, 6/12/95 Dep. pp. 79-80.<BR>
     In March 1994, almost two years to the date after the Patten firm issued its report, it was discovered that the report had overstated the Clintons investment in Whitewater by $22,244.65.326326.     Lyons Documents JML 2584-85.  The $68,900 investment in Whitewater by the Clintons reported by the Patten firm included a check paid by Mr. Clinton to Madison Bank and Trust in 1982 on a loan used to purchase a house for his mother in Hot Springs, Arkansas.327327.     Lyons Documents JML 2584-85.  Thus, the Patten firm overstated the Clinton's Whitewater investment by more than 30 percent.<BR>
     Less than two weeks after this error was first acknowledged, Mr. Patten, in a November 4, 1993 memorandum to Mr. Lyons, explained the problems that his firm had encountered in its analysis.  Mr. Patten noted that his firm's work "did not and could not constitute an audit, review, compilation or the application of agreed upon procedures as those terms are understood within the accounting profession."  He further wrote that "source documentation was not available in many instances and we had to utilize the next best available documentation," and that "[t]he financial statements that we reconstructed took into consideration monies paid by the Clintons, the McDougals and others that had not been reflected in the accountant's workpapers or tax returns."328328.

     C.     The Clintons Finally Get Out of Whitewater <BR>
     Among the documents in Mr. Foster's office at the time of his death was his handwritten note: "Get out of White Water."329329.     Williams & Connolly Document DKSN000481.    To that end, Mr. Foster, Mr. Hubbell and others in the Clinton organization met with Mr. Lyons on November 24, 1992, two weeks after Mr. Clinton was elected President.330330.     Hearings before the Special Committee to Investigate Whitewater Development Corporation and Related Matters, administered by the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, on the Inquiry into whether Improper Conduct Occurred Regarding the Way in which White House Officials Handled Documents in the Office of White House Deputy Counsel Vincent W. Foster, Jr., 104th Cong., 1st Sess., July 18, 1995 - August 10, 1995 [hereinafter "S. Hrg."], 8/8/95 p. 28; Williams & Connolly Document DKSN000482.    <BR>
     Mr. Blair called Mr. McDougal's attorney, Sam Heuer, and told him that "the Clintons and the McDougals needed to be totally separated over the Whitewater thing."331331.     Blair, 2/19/96 Dep. p. 62.    According to Mr. Blair, he suggested that Mr. McDougal pay a nominal amount to buy the Clintons' interest in Whitewater:332332.     Blair, 2/19/96 Dep. p. 67.    "I think we settled on a thousand dollars as an appropriate nominal amount."333333.     Blair, 2/19/96 Dep. p. 67.    There was one problem: "McDougal doesn't have a thousand dollars."334334.     Blair, 2/19/96 Dep. p. 69.    Mr. Blair then told Mr. Heuer, "[W]ell, what the heck, I will loan him the thousand dollars.  I'll just Fed Ex you a check to your trust account.  And I believe that's what I did."335335.     Blair, 2/19/96 Dep. p. 70.    The loan was made without interest,336336.     Blair, 2/19/96 Dep. p. 72.   and Mr. McDougal has never repaid Mr. Blair.337337.     Blair, 2/19/96 Dep. p. 72.    <BR>
     On December 22, 1993, Mr. McDougal and the Clintons executed the transaction to get the Clintons out of Whitewater.338338.     Blair, 2/19/96 Dep. p. 84.    Mr. Foster obtained the Clintons' signature for the documents executing the sale.339339.     Blair, 2/19/96 Dep. p. 63.    It is unclear whether Mr. Foster, Mr. McDougal, or the Clintons knew that Mr. Blair gave Mr. McDougal the $1000 to buy the Whitewater shares from the Clintons.340340.     Blair, 2/19/96 Dep. p. 73.  <BR>
     Mr. Blair then assigned Mr. Foster the task of contacting the accountants and preparing the Clintons' tax returns.341341.     Blair, 2/19/96 Dep. p. 79.  The issue facing Mr. Foster in the months preceding his death was how to treat the $1000 sale on the Clintons' 1992 tax returns.  The basic dilemma stemmed from the Clintons' claim, bolstered by the publicly released Lyons report, that they had incurred significant losses on their investment in Whitewater.  The problem with declaring the loss on the Clintons's tax return was the lack of a proper basis with which to calculate the cost of the venture to the Clintons.  Despite their claim that they were 50% partners in the venture, the Clintons had contributed less than 25% of the funds used to cover Whitewater's losses.<BR>
     Also among the documents in Mr. Foster's office at the time of death were his notes of conversations with the Clintons' accountant, Yoly Redden.342342.     Redden, 5/30/96 Dep. p. 237.  The notes, in Mr. Foster's hand, identified the tax problem as a "can of worms you shouldn't open."343343.     Williams & Connolly Document DKSN000518.  His notes in the file outlined the basic tax issues the Clintons faced in connection with Whitewater:<BR>
     "1)     What was nature of deductions<BR>
          A.  How deduct interest/principal payments for corp.?<BR></P>

<P>     2)     Can you use contribution which predated incorporation?<BR></P>

<P>     3)     Contribution/advancements of $68,900 to the McD<BR></P>

<P>     4)     Inability to utilize $8000 capital loss"344344.     Williams & Connolly Document DKSN000514.<BR>
     Mr. Foster's objective was to avoid calling attention to Whitewater during the annual audit of the President and Mrs. Clinton's tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service audit.345345.     Jeff Gerth and Stephen Engleberg, "Documents Show Clintons Enjoyed Far Vaster Protection from Whitewater Losses," New York Times, July 15 1995, at A18.  One approach was simply to report a wash, that is, to show no loss and no gain from the venture, thereby obviating the need for any tax treatment.  The problem with such treatment, however, was that it would have bolstered the allegation that the Clintons were insulated from Whitewater losses and thus the company was a vehicle for Mr. McDougal to channel funds to the Clintons.<BR>
     In notes titled "Discussion Points," Mr. Foster wrote:<BR>
     1)     An argument that they were protected against loss:<BR>
          A)  wash is consistent with this theory346346.     Williams & Connolly Document DKSN000515.<BR></P>

<P>But Mr. Foster did not a have a proper cost basis with which to calculate the Clintons' true losses or gains.  His discussion points continued:<BR>
     2)     Improper to reduce basis by improper tax benefit<BR></P>

<P>     3)     Computation of economic loss was based, in part, on assumptions<BR>
          Whereas computation of tax gain or loss must be defensible in audit.347347.     Williams & Connolly Document DKSN000515.<BR>
     Therein lay the problem.  To claim a loss based on economic assumptions, as the Lyons report did, was one thing.1      1 Elsewhere in his notes, Mr. Foster wrote:<BR>
     A.     Colo analysis was of economic loss<BR>
          (1)  did not take into account interest deductions<BR>
          (2)  calculation included some items for which there were no canceled cks.<BR>
Williams & Connolly Document DKSN000517.  "Colo analysis" was an apparent reference to the Lyons report.  But to claim a loss on the Clintons' 1992 tax returns without proper support and documentation increased the likelihood of calling attention to Whitewater during the IRS audit--of opening the can of worms that Mr. Foster and the Clintons' accountant wished to keep sealed.348348.     Williams & Connolly Document DKSN000518.<BR>
     Mr. Foster's notes summarized the options as follows:<BR>
     "10     Options<BR>
          $1000 basis     so no tax effect<BR>
          but is arbitrary & still risks audit<BR>
                        vs<BR>
          0 basis w/ $1000 gain<BR>
          avoids any audit of issue"349349.     Williams & Connolly Document DKSN000519.<BR>
     In a letter to Mr. Foster days before the tax returns were due, Ms. Redden, the accountant the Clintons hired to handle Whitewater tax issues, wrote:  "Because of the numerous problems with Whitewater records and the commingling of funds with other companies and individuals, I believe many explanations may have to be made if we claim a loss."350350.     Sidley & Austin Document 0000185. This letter, addressed to Mr. Foster, was not among the documents in Mr. Foster's office that the White House produced to the Special Committee.  It was obtained by the Special Committee through another source.351351.     Sidley & Austin Document 0000185.  Ms. Redden testified that after the Clintons were in the White House she had a number of discussions with Mr. Foster concerning tax issues related to Whitewater.352352.     Redden, 5/30/96 Dep. p. 228.  The main focus of these numerous communications was the tax basis for the Clintons' contributions to Whitewater and how to treat the $1000 payment.353353.     Redden, 5/30/96 Dep. pp. 230-231.<BR>
     The Clintons' final tax returns for 1992 reported a capital gain of $1000 from the sale of stock to Mr. McDougal.354354.     Jeff Gerth and Stephen Engleberg, "Documents Show Clintons Enjoyed Far Vaster Protection from Whitewater Losses," New York Times, July 15, 1995, at A18.  According to Ms. Redden, "I think we need to claim no gain or a loss."355355.     Redden, 5/30/96 Dep. p. 234.  Mr. Foster did not follow her advice, however, because he was also consulting with another accountant, and "[a]t the end we compromised what we were going to put in the return in connection with Whitewater."356356.     Redden, 5/30/96 Dep. p. 234.<BR>
IV.     The Clintons' Questionable Tax Treatment of Whitewater: A History of Unreportable Income and Improper Deductions<BR></P>

<P>     During the years that the Clintons owned an interest in Whitewater, the Clintons adopted an aggressive approach to the tax treatment of their investment.  This approach sometimes resulted in errors on their federal income tax returns.  From 1978 to the early 1990s, the Clintons invested a total of $42,192 in Whitewater.357357.     4/24/95 Pillsbury Report, pp. 130-31.  During this same period, the Clintons deducted $42,656 of their Whitewater related expenses on their federal income tax returns -- almost $500 more than their total investment in the corporation.<BR>
     The Special Committee's analysis of the Clintons' treatment of individual Whitewater-related items on their federal income tax returns reveals that the Clintons took a number of questionable tax positions relating to Whitewater.  From 1992 to the present, the Clintons have admitted taking improper deductions of $7,928 and omitting income of $8,171 on their federal income tax returns during the period of their Whitewater investment.  Therefore, the Clintons have admitted understating their income by $16,099 during this period.  Based on its analysis of the available evidence, the Special Committee concluded that the Clintons could have understated their income on Whitewater related items by an additional $33,771, for a total increase in taxable income of $49,870.<BR>
     The Clintons have explained that errors on their tax returns relating to Whitewater were due to mistakes made by their accountants.  The Clintons did not fully disclose, however, all of their financial information to their accountants,358358.     Norton, 5/15/96 Hrg. pp. 3-4; Norton, 5/6/96 Dep. pp. 83-84.  did not discuss the details of important financial transactions with them,359359.     Norton, 5/6/96 Dep. pp. 92-93, 100-101. and sometimes simply ignored their accountant's advice.360360.     Norton, 5/15/96 Hrg. pp. 8-9. <BR>
     Gaines Norton, the Clintons' personal accountant from 1978 to 1984, stated that the Clintons provided him with the information used to prepare their tax returns.361361.     Norton, 5/15/96 Hrg. pp. 3-4.  According to Mr. Norton, a former IRS revenue agent and a certified public accountant, the Clintons did not provide him with underlying documents, but instead provided him with summaries,362362.     Norton, 5/15/96 Hrg. pp. 3-4. such as handwritten lists on notepads.363363.     Norton, 5/6/96 Dep. pp. 20 and 83-84.   In one case, Mr. Norton raised specific tax concerns about the structure of Whitewater and Mr. Clinton told him "to back off and leave the issue alone."364364.     Norton, 5/15/96 Hrg. pp. 8-9.  The errors and questions discussed in this section, therefore, cannot be dismissed as merely mistakes by the Clintons' personal accountants.       <BR>
     A.     1978: The Clintons' Unreported Income of $5,405 from 15-Acre Installment Sale<BR></P>

<P>     The Clintons may have unreported income of $5,405 from their 1978 installment sale of 15 acres of land originally purchased from Rolling Manor Inc., a company owned and controlled by Mr. McDougal.  On January 25, 1977, then-Attorney General Clinton purchased 20 acres of land from Rolling Manor Inc. for $11,400.365365.     Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document LP01547.  The Clintons' 1978 federal income tax return reports that they sold 20 acres of land in 1978 in two separate transactions, a cash sale of five acres and an installment sale of 15 acres.  On May 17, 1978, the Clintons sold five acres on a cash basis for $5,000, resulting in a gain of $2,150, which was properly reported on Schedule D (Capital Gains or Losses) of their 1978 return.366366.     Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document LP0663.  On July 23, 1978, the Clintons sold 15 acres of unimproved land on the installment method for $14,985, resulting in a gain of $6,435.367367.     Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document LP00672.  Since the Clintons elected to report this $6,435 gain on the installment method, only $886 of the gain was taxable in 1978 and was reported by the Clintons on their return.368368.     Haddon Morgan & Foreman Documents LP00663, LP00672.  The $5,549 balance of the gain ($6,435 - $886) from this 15-acre land sale was to be reported in future years as the Clintons received the payments from the buyer.  <BR>
     $5,405 of the $5,549 deferred gain reported on the Clintons' 1978 return does not appear, however, in their subsequent federal income tax returns.  The Clintons did not report any income from the 15-acre installment sale on their 1979 tax return.369369.     RTC Document DKRT800001-20.  The Clintons did report $144 in capital gains from an installment sale on Schedule D (Capital Gains and Losses) of their 1980 tax return.370370.     Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document LP00682.  The Clintons did not report any income from the 15-acre installment sale on any of their tax returns after 1980.1      1      Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document LP 00690-95 (Clinton 1981 income tax return); Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document LP 00696-719 (Clinton 1982 income tax return); Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document LP 00720-739 (Clinton 1983 income tax return); Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document LP 00740-762 (Clinton 1984 income tax return); Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document LP 00763-786 (Clinton 1985 income tax return); Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document LP 00787-815 (Clinton 1986 income tax return); Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document LP 00816-860 (Clinton 1987 income tax return). Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document LP 00861-894 (Clinton 1988 income tax return); Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document LP 00895-942 (Clinton 1989 income tax return); Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document 133-00005495-5503 (Clinton 1990 amended income tax return); Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document 133-00005520-5583 (Clinton 1990 income tax return); Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document 133-00005827-5904 (Clinton 1991 income tax return); Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document 133-00006319-6346 (Clinton 1992 income tax return).  How the Clintons collected a total of $2,066 in 1978 on the sale of this 15 acre tract of land, collected no funds in 1979, collected a total of $335 in 1980, of which $144 was reported as a gain on their 1980 tax return, and then collected no other funds from the buyer remains unexplained.<BR>
     If the Clintons collected the funds due from the buyer of the 15-acre parcel, they were required to report a portion of each payment as a gain on their tax returns, just as they reported a $144 gain on their 1980 return.1      1      Internal Revenue Code Section  453 allows, under certain conditions, taxpayers to pay gains on the sale of property on the installment method.   As described above, the Clintons reported no other gains on any of their subsequent returns.  Of course, if the Clintons did not receive payments from the buyer, they would not have been required to report gains on their income tax returns.  If the buyer of the property defaulted, however, the Clintons could have foreclosed on the property and then resold the property to another buyer, but there is no evidence on any of their subsequent tax returns that such action was taken by the Clintons.  In addition, if the buyer defaulted, the Clintons could have taken a $7,194 deduction for their remaining basis in the 15 acres, but there is no evidence of such a deduction on any of the Clintons subsequent tax returns.1      1      The gross profit percentage on this transaction was 42.9%.  Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document LP 00672 (Installment Gain on Sale Schedule - attachment to Clinton 1978 income tax return). Since the remaining gain was $5,405, the basis would be $7,194.  Moreover, if the property was foreclosed upon and not sold, then the Clintons would still own it, but this property is not shown on the Clintons 1991 Federal Election Disclosure form.371371.     Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document 133-00000518-531.<BR>
     B.     1979: The Clintons' Improper Interest Deduction of $2,400 <BR>
     The $2,400 interest deduction claimed by the Clintons on their 1979 tax return may have been improper under federal income tax law.  On December 7, 1979, Whitewater deposited in its account a check from the Clintons in the amount of $2,900.372372.     RTC Document DKRT900994.  On the books of Whitewater, this check was recorded as $500 for capital and $2,400 as "Loan - Bill Clinton".373373.     RTC Document DKRT800044-68.  According to its books, Whitewater's first interest payment in the amount of $4,352.63 was made to Citizen's Bank of Flippin on May 5.374374.     RTC Document DKRT800053.  On their 1979 federal income tax return, the Clintons claimed an interest deduction of $11,749 for payments to "Bank and Loan Companies."375375.     RTC Document DKRT800009.  This amount included the Clintons' $2,400 payment to Whitewater.376376.     RTC Document DKRT800001-20. <BR>
     Federal income tax law allows a deduction for "all interest paid or accrued within the taxable year on indebtedness,"377377.     Internal Revenue Code Section  163(a). but the burden of proof for establishing the propriety of an interest deduction is on the taxpayer.1      1      Treas. Regs. Section 1.6001-1(a) states that taxpayers shall keep records which "are sufficient to establish the amount of gross income, deductions, credits..." on the taxpayer's return.  In this case, there is no evidence that the Clintons' $2,400 payment to Whitewater was for interest on indebtedness.  Indeed, the only available evidence, the $2,900 deposit slip and the entries on Whitewater's books, indicates that the $2,400 payment was a loan to the corporation, which the corporation had an obligation to repay, and not an interest payment.  Moreover, Whitewater did not make its first interest payment to a bank until May 5, 1980, almost five months after the Clintons' payment of $2,400 was deposited, and there is no evidence that Whitewater's first interest payment of $4,352.63 included the Clintons $2,400.378378.     RTC Document DKRT8000533.<BR>
     An IRS audit of the Clintons' 1979 income tax return resulted in no changes.  However, there is no evidence that the revenue agent reviewed all of the relevant documents regarding this interest deduction.379379.     RTC Document DKRT11000804-808.  Absent proof that Whitewater's books and records were made available to the revenue agent by the Clintons, the result of the 1979 audit is inconclusive on this issue.  Indeed, it is possible that the revenue agent would have reviewed only a canceled check or bank records, determined that less than the full payment was deducted, and accepted this as sufficient evidence to verify the deduction.<BR>
     C.     1980: The Clintons' Improper Interest Deduction of $9,000<BR>
     The $9,000 interest deduction claimed by the Clintons on their 1980 tax return may have been improper under federal income tax law.  On August, 23, 1980, Mrs. Clinton wrote a personal check in the amount of $9,000.380380.     RTC Document DKRT800533.  The Clintons' deducted this $9,000 payment on their 1980 federal income tax return as interest paid to "James McDougal."381381.     Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document LP00673-89.  A third-party endorsement by Citizens Bank of Flippin, dated September 5, 1980, is on the reverse side of the Clintons' check.382382.     RTC Production DKRT800533. <BR>
     Federal income tax law allows a deduction for "all interest paid or accrued within the taxable year on indebtedness,"383383.     RTC Document DKRT800533.  but the burden of proof for establishing the propriety of an interest deduction is on the taxpayer.  In this case, there is no evidence that the Clintons' $9,000 payment was used to pay interest on indebtedness.  Nor is there evidence on the face of this check that it was intended to be used to pay interest.  The payee on the check was left blank, and there is no designation or notation on the check that it was intended to be used to pay interest.384384.     RTC Document DKRT800533.       In addition, the absence of a notation on the check that it was for interest is particularly probative, since Mrs. Clinton made such a notation on the other checks that she wrote to pay interest on the Whitewater debt.  Mrs. Clinton wrote at least four other personal checks to pay interest on Whitewater related debt -- three before and one after the $9,000 check, and, on each of these checks, Mrs. Clinton wrote a notation that the checks were for interest.1      1      Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document LP 00523 (check 697, dated December 28, 1978, issued to Great Southern Land Company, Inc. in the amount of $10,130.58 states "Reimbursement for six months interest"; check 396, dated December 29, 1979, issued to Citizens Bank & Trust in the amount of $4,752.88 states "Interest Payment"; check 395, dated December 29, 1979, issued to James B. McDougal in the amount of $237.50 states "Reimbursement of Interest pd.").  Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document 00528 (check 1623, dated December 30, 1986, issued to Security Bank in the amount of $1,635.51 states "Int on note 957585.").  Moreover, the Clintons' checkbook entry designates this check as a "land payment," not an interest payment.385385.     Letter from David Kendall to the Honorable James A. Leach, May 24, 1996, forwarding a report entitled "Review of Clinton Tax Adjustments Proposed by the House Committee on Banking and Financial Services," p.8 (hereinafter the "Kendall Report").  "Land payment" could refer either to a principal or interest payment.  Since Mrs. Clinton generally noted when a payment was for interest, however, her notation that this check was for a "land payment" would tend to confirm that this payment was for principal, not interest.   <BR>
     Analyses of the available bank records also indicate that the $9,000 check was used to pay principal, not interest.  A report prepared by Patten, McCarthy & Associates, a Denver accounting firm hired by the 1992 Clinton Presidential Campaign, states:<BR>
     In our telephone conversation with her [Mrs. Clinton] and you [James Lyons] on March 18, 1992, she reaffirmed that she believed that it was an interest payment. Based on our reconstruction of the probable amortization of the mortgage loan at Citizens Bank & Trust, we believe the $9,000 went to reduce principal.386386.     Lyons Document JLM 088.<BR>
The report of Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro is even more conclusive on this point.  It states:<BR>
     On August 23, 1980, the Clintons paid $9,000 to an unknown payee.  Through a reconstruction of the Citizens Bank mortgage, it has been determined that this payment was applied as principal to the outstanding balance of the Citizens Bank loan.387387.     4/24/95 Pillsbury Report, p. 31.<BR>
Thus, the available evidence indicates that the bank applied the $9,000 to reduce principal, not interest.<BR>
     According to the report prepared by the President and Mrs. Clinton's counsel, David Kendall, since the Clintons "owed interest to Citizens Bank of Flippin, WDC [Whitewater] or the McDougals, if they intended that their $9,000 check represents the interest, then Mr. and Mrs. Clinton accurately deducted the $9,000 payment as interest."388388.     Kendall Report, pp. 10-11.  However, there is no evidence of any unconditional and legally enforceable indebtedness between the Clintons and Whitewater or Mr. McDougal at the time of this payment.  While an indebtedness did exist between the Clintons and Citizens Bank, Mrs. Clinton's intent that a payment on the note was for interest is not sufficient to support an interest deduction under federal income tax law.<BR>
     Courts generally will give effect to an arrangement between a creditor and a debtor allocating payments on an indebtedness to principal and/or interest where that arrangement is bona fide and done at arm's length.389389.     Bayou Verret Land Co. v. Commissioner, 52 T.C. 971, 985-986 (1969), affd. on this issue 450 F.2d 850 (5th Cir. 1971).  However, a taxpayer cannot deduct prepaid interest, regardless of her intent.  <BR>
  There is no evidence of that such an arrangement existed between Mrs. Clinton and Citizen's Bank.  Nor is there evidence that Mrs. Clinton communicated to the bank or any other party that the payment was for interest.  Absent such an arrangement, payments by a debtor are first allocated to accrued but unpaid interest and then to principal.390390.     Bayou Verret Land Co. v. Commissioner, 52 T.C. 971, 985-986 (1969), affd. on this issue 450 F.2d 850 (5th Cir. 1971).  <BR></P>

<P>     The available evidence indicates that no accrued but unpaid interest was due on the Citizens Bank loan when the Clintons' $9,000 check was endorsed by Citizens Bank on September 5, 1980.  One month earlier, on August 5, 1980, the Citizens Bank note was extended and modified and, at the same time, the Clintons paid Citizens Bank the quarterly interest owing and due of $4,350, which they properly deducted on their 1978 return.391391.     4/24/95 Pillsbury Report, p. 31.  No principal payment had been made on the loan as of the date of its renewal.392392.     4/24/95 Pillsbury Report, p. 31.   Just 18 days later, Mrs. Clinton wrote the $9,000 check for "land payment."  The next quarterly interest payment on the note would not have been due until November 5, 1980, two months after Citizens Bank endorsed the Clintons' $9,000 check.<BR>
     D.     1980: The Clintons' Unreported Income of $10,000 from Whitewater payment of the $20,000 Union Bank Note<BR>
     Whitewater's 1980 payment of a 1978 $20,000 unsecured, personal note of Mr. McDougal and Mr. Clinton may have resulted in $10,000 of income to the Clintons that was not reported on their 1980 federal income tax return.  On June 19, 1978, Mr. McDougal and Mr. Clinton obtained a $20,000 unsecured, personal loan (Loan # 0004197) from Union National Bank of Little Rock.393393.     RTC Document DKRT900145.  The proceeds of this loan were used to make the down payment on the 230 acres of land in Marion County, Arkansas that became Whitewater.394394.     4/24/95 Pillsbury Report pp. 15-16.  On December 17, 1979, the Union National Bank note was renewed for 6 months, with a new maturity date of June 16, 1980.395395.     RTC Document DKRT900155.  As of the date of that renewal, the principal of the note remained $20,000.396396.     RTC Document DKRT900155.  On June 10, 1980, Mr. McDougal borrowed $20,000 from the Bank of Cherry Valley in Cherry Valley, Arkansas,397397.     RTC Document BCV0004. and deposited those funds in Whitewater's account at the Union National Bank.398398.     RTC Document DKRT900968.  On June 23, 1980, Whitewater disbursed $21,346.29 to Union National Bank, using a corporate check with the notation "For Note # 0004197 Plus interest thru 6/23/80," to pay off the accrued interest and principal owed personally by Mr. McDougal and Mr. Clinton to Union National Bank.399399.     RTC Document DKRT901077.<BR>
     Section 61 of the Internal Revenue Code states that "gross income means all income from whatever source derived, including . . . income from discharge of indebtedness."400400.     Internal Revenue Code Section 61(a)(12).  Courts have ruled that amounts expended by a corporation for an individual taxpayer's benefit would constitute income to the taxpayer.401401.     Lash v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo 1956-87 ("amounts expended by Bristol for petitioner's benefit would constitute income to him. . . .").    Section 108(e)(4)(A) of the Code states that income is realized if debt is discharged or acquired by a related entity.402402.     Internal Revenue Code Section 108(e)(4)(A).<BR>
     The central issue is whether Whitewater's payment to Union National Bank discharged any debt owed by Mr. Clinton.  Mr. McDougal and Mr. Clinton were jointly and severally liable on the Union National Bank note.403403.     Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document LP00106.  Whitewater's incorporation did not change this, since the Union National Bank note was not transferred to Whitewater.404404.     Haddon Morgan & Foreman LP00106.  Therefore, Whitewater's payment to Union National Bank eliminated Mr. Clinton's obligation to that bank.<BR>
     However, if Mr. Clinton was an obligor on the Bank of Cherry Valley note, from which Whitewater received the funds to pay Union National Bank, then Whitewater's debt would not have discharged any debt owed by Mr. Clinton.  In this case, the debt simply would have shifted from Union National Bank to the Bank of Cherry Valley.405405.     Haddon Morgan & Foreman Documents LP01957-69. 1      1      There is also no evidence that the Clintons had an obligation to repay, or did repay, Whitewater.  Whitewater's books for the year ending May 31, 1981 do not show that the corporation reduced the Clintons' notes payable that was established when the land was transferred into the corporation.  Nor do they show that the corporations recorded a receivable from the Clintons.  Haddon Morgan & Foreman Documents LP 01957-69.  On the other hand, if Mr. Clinton was not an obligor on the Bank of Cherry Valley note, then Whitewater's payment would have discharged debt owed by Mr. Clinton.  In this case, the Union National Bank debt, on which Mr. Clinton was jointly and severally liable, would have been replaced by the Bank of Cherry Valley debt, on which Mr. Clinton was not liable.  In the latter case, Mr. Clinton would owe the IRS additional taxes on the $10,000 of discharged debt, his share of the Union Bank debt.<BR>
     Was Mr. Clinton an obligor on the Bank of Cherry Valley note?  Mr. Clinton has stated that "any shift of this $20,000 loan from Union Bank did not affect its character as an acquisition loan, for which my wife and I considered ourselves equally responsible with the McDougals for repayment."406406.     W.Clinton, Interrogatory Answers to RTC, 5/24/95 pp. 12-13.  However, testimony by the Bank of Cherry Valley's former President, Maurice Smith, indicates that the loan was made to Mr. McDougal individually, and most of the bank documents support his testimony.  Indeed, Mr. Smith testified that the bank "just loaned it to Jim McDougal" and that Mr. Clinton did not make payments on the loan.407407.     Smith, 4/23/96 Dep. p. 25.<BR>
     Most of the available loan documents indicate that Mr. McDougal was the sole obligor on the Bank of Cherry Valley note.408408.     Williams & Connolly Document DKSN 021879 (Bank of Cherry Valley note, dated 4/13/81); RTC Document (Not Numbered) Bank of Cherry Valley note, dated 12/9/82, with James McDougal as maker, signed only by James McDougal; Bank of Cherry Valley note, dated 6/9/84, with James McDougal as maker, signed only by James McDougal; Bank of Cherry Valley note, dated 12/3/84, with James McDougal as maker, signed only by James McDougal.        Mr. McDougal's name, and not Mr. Clinton's, is typed on each of the documents, and Mr. McDougal signed each of the documents.409409.     Williams & Connolly Document DKSN 021879 (Bank of Cherry Valley note, dated 4/13/81); RTC Production (Not Numbered) Bank of Cherry Valley note, dated 12/9/82, with James McDougal as maker, signed only by James McDougal; Bank of Cherry Valley note, dated 6/9/84, with James McDougal as maker, signed only by James McDougal; Bank of Cherry Valley note, dated 12/3/84, with James McDougal as maker, signed only by James McDougal.  Only one loan document appears to have Mr. Clinton's signature on it, and Mr. Clinton's name is not typed on that document.410410.     RTC Document DKRT100500.  Moreover, that document is dated more than two years after the note was originated.411411.     RTC Document DKRT100500.<BR>
     E.     1982: The Clintons' Unreported Income of $5,691 for Whitewater Payment of Citizens Bank of Jonesboro Note<BR>
     A 1982 payment by Whitewater of the principal and interest on a $5,000 note between the Citizens Bank of Jonesboro and Mr. Clinton may have resulted in $5,691.20 of income to the Clintons that was not reported on their 1982 federal income tax return.  A May 21, 1981 personal financial statement of the Clintons lists a $5,000 note payable to Citizens Bank of Jonesboro as a liability under the heading "general debt."412412.     RTC Document CBF0280.  On February 17, 1981, Mr. Clinton wrote a personal check in the amount of $243.82 to Citizens Bank, which had a notation "Interest on Note #585-270."413413.     Hogan & Hartson Document BL011114.  On February 22, 1982, Whitewater disbursed a check in the amount of $5,691.20 to Citizens Bank.414414.     RTC Document DKRT500067.  The notation on the check states "Note 585-270,"415415.     RTC Document DKRT500067. and the Whitewater checkbook entry designates this check as payment of "Note #585-270 - Bill Clinton."416416.     Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document LP02928.<BR>
     Section 61 of the Internal Revenue Code states that "gross income means all income from whatever source derived, including . . . [i]ncome from discharge of indebtedness."417417.     Internal Revenue Code Section  61(a)(12)  Courts have ruled that amounts expended by a corporation for an individual taxpayer's benefit would constitute income to the taxpayer.418418.     Lash v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo 1956-87 ("amounts expended by Bristol for petitioner's benefit would constitute income to him. . . .").    Whitewater paid Mr. Clinton's note at Citizens Bank of Jonesboro, but Mr. Clinton has stated that "[i]t is possible that it was a WDC-related loan."419419.     W. Clinton, Interrogatory Answers to RTC, 5/24/95 pp. 23-24.  If Mr. Clinton invested the proceeds of this loan in Whitewater and Whitewater then repaid the loan, Mr. Clinton would have received no personal benefit from Whitewater's payment of the note, and, therefore, would not have been required to recognize income from discharge of indebtedness.<BR>
     The evidence is inconclusive on whether this Citizens Bank of Jonesboro loan was related to Whitewater.  A March 1, 1982 letter from Jim McDougal to Bill Clinton states:<BR>
     I have paid from the Whitewater Development Corporation the note you owed Citizens Bank of Jonesboro.  You are correct in your belief that the sum of money borrowed was part of your investment in Whitewater. 420420.     RTC Document DKRT400989.   <BR>
         </P> 
<P>Yet, there is no evidence on Whitewater's books that it received $5,000 from either the Clintons or Citizens Bank of Jonesboro.421421.     RTC Document DKRT800044-68; Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document LP01957-88.   1      1      There is also no evidence that the Clintons had an obligation to repay, or did repay, Whitewater.  Whitewater's books for the year ending May 31, 1982 do not show that the corporation reduced the Clintons' notes payable that was established when the land was transferred into the corporation.  Nor do they show that the corporations recorded a receivable from the Clintons.  Haddon Morgan & Foreman Documents LP 01957-88.  Indeed, when Whitewater disbursed $5,691 to Citizens Bank of Jonesboro, it recorded the full amount as "interest" paid, which indicates that the corporation had never recorded a liability that could be reduced upon payment of the note.422422.     Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document LP01981-2.<BR>
     Although the evidence is inconclusive on whether these funds were invested in Whitewater, under federal income tax law the Clintons would bear the burden of proof that this payment did not result in any benefit to them personally.  It is unclear whether the March 1, 1982 McDougal letter would be considered sufficient proof that the Clintons invested the funds received from the Citizens Bank of Jonesboro in Whitewater.  If found insufficient, the Clintons would have unreported income of $5,691.20, excluding any interest and penalties.<BR>
     F.     1984: The Clintons' Improper Deduction of $144 for Real Estate Taxes<BR>
     On their 1984 federal income tax return, the Clintons improperly deducted $144 for real estate tax payments for which they were reimbursed by Whitewater.  On October 10, 1984, the Clintons paid $144 to Marion County for the payment of real estate taxes on Whitewater lot 13.  On November 4, 1984, Whitewater reimbursed the Clintons for this amount.423423.     Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document LP02018.  Since the Clintons were reimbursement for the taxes paid, this deduction was improper.  On May 24, 1996, the Clintons acknowledged this error and repaid the federal taxes owed to the Bureau of Public Debt and the state taxes owed to an Arkansas charity.424424.     Kendall Report, p. 11.     <BR>
     G.     1984 and 1985: The Clintons' Improper Interest Deductions of $2,811 and $2,322<BR></P>

<P>	On their 1984 and 1985 federal income tax returns, the Clintons improperly deducted $5,133 for interest payments made paid by Whitewater, not the Clintons.425425.	Gerth and Labaton, "Whitewater Papers Cast Doubt on Clinton Account of a Tax Underpayment," The New York Times, August 6, 1995, p. 20.  In 1984 and 1985, Whitewater made interest payments to the Security Bank of Paragould in the amounts of $2,811 and $2,322, respectively, that the corporation deducted on its corporate tax returns.426426.	Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document LP00109.  The Clintons also claimed these same interest deductions on their 1984 and 1985 federal income tax returns.427427.	Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document LP00109.  Since Whitewater made the interest payments to the bank, it, and not the Clintons, was entitled to those deductions.  On December 28, 1993, almost two years after the errors were first reported, the Clintons repaid the taxes owed due to these errors.428428.	Gerth and Labaton, "Whitewater Papers Cast Doubt on Clinton Account of a Tax Underpayment," The New York Times, August 6, 1995, p. 20.  The Clintons did not explain the delay.429429.	Gerth and Labaton, "Whitewater Papers Cast Doubt on Clinton Account of a Tax Underpayment," The New York Times, August 6, 1995, p. 20.  <BR>
	H.	1987: The Clintons' Improper Interest Deduction of $2,561<BR>
	On their 1987 federal income tax return, the Clintons improperly deducted $1,636 for interest which they also deducted on their 1986 federal income tax return.  On December 30, 1986, Mrs. Clinton wrote a check in the amount of $1,635.51 to Security Bank of Paragould.430430.	Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document LP00528.  On their 1986 federal income tax return, the Clintons deducted $1,636 for interest paid to "Security Bank."431431.	Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document LP00790.  In 1987, Security Bank of Paragould sent the Clintons a statement of interest paid on their loan during 1987, which listed interest paid of $2,561.33.432432.	Hogan & Hartson Document BL011121. On their 1987 federal income tax return, the Clintons deducted $2,561 in interest paid to "Security Bank.433433.	Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document LP00858.<BR>
	The $2,561 of interest deducted on the Clintons' 1987 tax return improperly included the $1,635.51 payment made by the Clintons in 1986 and deducted on their 1986 tax return.  The $925 balance of this amount ($2,561 - $1,636) was also improperly deducted by the Clintons on their 1987 tax return.  This interest was paid by Hillman Logan, the owner of Whitewater lot 13.  On May 24, 1996, the Clintons acknowledged these errors and repaid the federal taxes owed to the Bureau of Public Debt and state taxes owed to an Arkansas charity.434434.	Kendall Report, p. 11.	<BR>
	Documents show that the Mrs Clinton may have discussed this error with her personal accountant, Yoly Redden, and Loretta Lynch on March 23, 1992 -- almost four years before the Clintons acknowledged the error. Notes taken by Ms. Redden of a March 23, 1992 telephone conversation between herself, Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Lynch state:<BR>
	Clinton Campaign - Issue discussed with HC & Loretta Lynch<BR>
	1987	$2,651 deducted per return to Security Bank of Paragould. [found canceled check from Clintons dated 12/30/86 check # 1623 for 1635.51.]<BR>
	1986	1,636 paid [an arrow in Ms. Redden's notes points from this entry to the 1987 entry]435435.	Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document 133-00001008.<BR>
Ms. Redden testified that in this conversation she had discussed with Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Lynch whether or not certain deductions had been "double-counted" on the Clintons' 1986 and 1987 federal income tax returns and that this issue had been discussed even prior to this conversation.436436.	Redden, 5/30/96 Dep. pp. 184-187.<BR>
	I.	1988: The Clintons' Improper Deduction of $1,275 for Real Estate Taxes<BR></P>

<P>	The $1,275 real estate tax deduction claimed by the Clintons on their 1988 tax return may have been improper under federal income tax law.  On October 28, 1988, Mrs. Clinton reimbursed Ozark Realty $1,275.15 for real estate taxes due on several Whitewater lots.437437.	RTC Document DKRT101031-35 and DKRT101043-44.  On their 1988 federal income tax return the Clintons deducted $1,275 as real estate taxes.438438.	Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document LP00866.  Generally, only the owner of real property is entitled to deduct real property taxes on the property, since those taxes are the liability of the owner under federal income tax law.439439.	See DeVere v. Commissioner, 35 T.C.M. 28 (1976); Anderson v. Commissioner, 33 T.C.M. 234 (1974), aff'd. per curiam, 527 F.2d 198 (9th Cir., 1975).  Since the Clintons did not own the property on which the taxes were assessed, they were not entitled to a deduction for the payment of those real estate taxes.  A taxpayer who owns a beneficial interest in property and who pays taxes thereon to protect that interest may deduct the taxes, even though legal title is in another.440440.	Cornelia C.F. Horsford v. Commissioner, 2 T.C. 826 (1943); Estate of Movius, 22 T.C. 391 (1954); Steinert v. Commissioner, 33 T.C. 447 (1959).   Beneficial interest is narrowly defined, however, and does not appear to the Clintons interest, if any, in the lots on which these real estate property taxes were assessed.  Therefore, the Clintons' $1,275 payment to Ozark Realty for real estate taxes may not be an allowable deduction.<BR>
	J.	1988: The Clintons' Unreported Income of $1,673 from the Sale of Lot 13<BR></P>

<P>	On May 24, 1996, the Clintons acknowledged that they under-reported the capital gain from the sale of a Whitewater lot owned by Mrs. Clinton by $1,673 on their 1988 federal income tax return.441441.	Kendall Report, pp. 12-13.  On that return, the Clintons reported a $1,640 long-term capital gain from the sale of lot 13.442442.	Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document LP00861-94.  In computing the capital gain from this sale, the Clintons included in their basis calculation payments made by the previous owner of the lot.443443.	Haddon Morgan & Foreman Document LP00861 - LP00894; Kendall Report, pp. 12-13.  As a result, the cost of the property was artificially inflated by $1,673, reducing the gain reported by the Clintons by this same amount on their 1988 tax return.  The have repaid the federal taxes owed to the Bureau of Public Debt and the state taxes owed to an Arkansas charity.444444.	Kendall Report, pp. 11.<BR></P>

<P>Part II. GOVERNOR CLINTON'S QUESTIONABLE RELATIONSHIP WITH JAMES MCDOUGAL<BR></P>

<P>	While Mr. McDougal was carrying the Clintons share on the Whitewater loans, Governor Clinton, using the power of his political office, acted favorably on Mr. McDougal's other business ventures and accepted Mr. McDougal's recommendations regarding state action.  These favors took the form of granting Mr. McDougal influence in appointments to state positions445445.	RTC Document MG0000759; Williams & Connolly Document DKSN025966; Lyon, 12/14/95 Dep. p. 55., steering lucrative state leases to Madison Guaranty446446.	Herr, 4/24/96 Hrg. pp. 18-19., and making decisions for Mr. McDougal concerning state regulators.447447.	RTC Document DKRT800606A.  This pattern of favoritism was important to Mr. McDougal, whose thrift was experiencing serious financial trouble. <BR>
	The motive for this favoritism is clear.  From the standpoint of Governor Clinton, if Madison Guaranty failed or Mr. McDougal experienced financial troubles, the Clintons could be liable for the full Whitewater debt.  Thus, Governor Clinton had a reason to act to ensure the viability of Mr. McDougal's savings & loan, even if such action was adverse to the interests of the state.<BR>
I.	James McDougal's Madison Guaranty: A Corrupt Savings & Loan<BR>
	In January 1982, James and Susan McDougal, along with several others, purchased 90% of the stock of the Woodruff County Savings & Loan Association for $246,500, which they renamed Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan Association ("Madison Guaranty").448448.	4/24/95, Pillsbury Report p. 43.  To finance the purchase of Madison Guaranty, the McDougals borrowed $70,000 from Worthen Bank. Mr. McDougal inaccurately indicated on the change of control applications that he had obtained the money through "funds received from closely held corporations." 449449.	4/24/95, Pillsbury Report p. 43.   In June 1983, the McDougals borrowed another $142,186 from Worthen Bank to acquire stock belonging to other investors in Madison Guaranty in order to acquire exclusive control over the S&L.450450.	4/24/95, Pillsbury Report p. 43.  <BR>
	Mr. McDougal's true interest was always real estate investments, and his control of Madison Guaranty allowed him to pursue such investments.  On the other hand, Madison Bank & Trust, Mr. McDougal's other federal institution, was prohibited from such investments.451451.	4/24/95, Pillsbury Report p. 43.    In early 1982, Mr. McDougal incorporated Madison Financial Corporation as a subsidiary of Madison Guaranty for the sole purpose of real estate investment.452452.	4/24/95, Pillsbury Report p. 45.  <BR>
     From the beginning, Mr. McDougal viewed Madison Guaranty as a personal "candy store."453453.	4/24/95, Pillsbury Report p. 43.    Soon after its purchase Mr. McDougal began to borrow personally from Madison Guaranty to pay down other loans including financing Whitewater.454454.	4/24/95, Pillsbury Report pp. 44-45.    <BR>
 	In 1984, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board ("FHLBB") examined Madison Guaranty and concluded that "[t]he viability of the institution is jeopardized through the institution's current investment and lending practices in real estate development projects."  The FHLBB attempted to force Madison, through a cease and desist order and a supervisory agreement, to stop lending money to the McDougals or any McDougal-controlled entity, and require Madison Guaranty to raise additional capital.<BR>
	Shortly thereafter, Mr. McDougal hired Mrs. Clinton and the Rose Law Firm to represent Madison Guaranty and then-Governor Clinton appointed Beverly Bassett Schaffer to the position of Arkansas Securities Commissioner, based possibly on Mr. McDougal's recommendation.  Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Schaffer discussed -- and Ms. Schaffer approved -- a novel proposal for Madison Guaranty to raise capital through the issuance of preferred stock.  Ms. Clinton and the Rose Law Firm also represented Madison Guaranty in connection with land transactions and real estate investments, notably Castle Grande.<BR>
  	Beginning in March 1986, the FHLBB again examined Madison Guaranty.455455.	Clark, 1/30/96 Hrg. p. 9.    James Clark, the examiner-in-charge, testified that the examiner discovered "a group of insiders was obtaining cash in what amounted to a pyramid scheme" led by the principal insider, James McDougal.456456.	Clark, 1/30/96 Hrg. p. 9.  <BR>
	Mr. Clark testified that in his 20 years as a bank examiner, Madison Guaranty was on of the top five worst financial institutions that he examined in terms of self dealing by insiders.457457.	Clark, 1/30/96 Hrg. p. 15.    The 1986 examination report concluded that "management blatantly disregarded numerous regulations," "ignored" parts of the Supervisory Agreement.458458.	Hogan & Hartson Document BL010705.  Moreover the report stated that Mr. McDougal's effective control of Madison Guaranty "enabled [him] to use corporate resources to develop large land developments [and] to divert substantial amounts of funds from the projects to himself and others."459459.	Hogan & Hartson Document BL010705.  The examiners cited Campobello, Maple Creek, and Castle Grande as problematic projects.460460.	Hogan & Hartson Document BL010705.    Although Madison Guaranty's financial statements indicated that the institution was in the black, the FHLBB report noted that improper accounting appeared to be the source of the profit, not successful investing. The report stated that, "[i]f profits [of the real estate projects] were booked properly, the Institution would be, in fact, insolvent."461461.	Hogan & Hartson Document BL010705.  <BR>
	A.	Madison's Fraudulent Land Deals	<BR>
	Examiner Clark testified that Mr. McDougal "had total control of Madison Guaranty funds" and that Mr. McDougal could "dispense those funds at any time he wished, and he did so through the land development projects."462462.	Clark, 1/30/96 Hrg. p. 17.    The 1986 federal examination uncovered several instances where Madison Guaranty insiders engaged in "sham transactions" or acted as a "straw man," an arrangement whereby the "purchaser of the property would obtain legal title to a property without having any actual financial interest in the property simply as a means to hide true ownership of the property."463463.	Clark, 1/30/96 Hrg. p. 18.     The sham transactions were used as a means to place phony profit on the books in attempt to falsely inflate net worth.464464.	Clark, 1/30/96 Hrg. p. 19.  <BR>
      </P> 
<P>	For example, the 1986 examination found that the Castle Grande project was "purchased and sold in a series of fictitious transactions" to straw buyers.465465.	Clark, 1/30/96 Hrg. p. 21.    At the recently concluded McDougal-Tucker trial, Don Denton, chief lending officer of Madison, testified that Seth Ward was a "nominee" buyer in the purchase of part of the land.466466.	Denton, 3/18/96 McDougal Trial Testimony p. 1025.    These transactions were structured in this way to enable Madison Guaranty to violate the Arkansas state regulation prohibiting Madison Guaranty from investing more than 6% of its assets into Madison Financial Corporation.467467.	Clark, 1/30/96 Hrg. p. 146.  <BR>
	Bank examiners also found that Madison Guaranty insiders obtained financing for real estate projects that were fully funded by Madison Guaranty.468468.	Clark, 1/30/96 Hrg. p. 155.    In addition, insiders received real estate commissions that they did not earn.469469.	Clark, 1/30/96 Hrg. pp. 155-56.     <BR>
	B.	Madison's Phony Books and Records  <BR>
	The 1984 examination of Madison Guaranty had concluded that the books and records were "inadequate."470470.	Clark, 1/30/96 Hrg. p. 92.    The books and records at Madison Guaranty were "poor, missing, and in some cases, intentionally misleading."471471.	Clark, 1/30/96 Hrg. p. 10.    The loan files did not sufficiently document the disbursements of the loan proceeds.472472.	Clark, 1/30/96 Hrg. p. 32.    	Mr. Denton testified that prior to the arrival of the examiners in March 1986, the staff of Madison Guaranty went through the loan files to find out what was missing, back dated documents, and had phony appraisals prepared.473473.	Denton, 3/18/96 McDougal Trial Testimony p. 1125.    Robert Palmer, a Madison appraiser, confirmed that he prepared several inflated appraisals for Madison Guaranty and backdated several appraisals.474474.	Palmer, 3/26/96 McDougal Trial Testimony pp. 2152, 2178, 2193.    Moreover, Mr. Clark testified that the appraisals were "wholly inadequate" and "the reports seemed to us to be essentially shams, some documents to put into the loan file."475475.	Clark, 1/30/96 Hrg. p. 142.  <BR>
	The 1986 FHLBB examination of Madison Guaranty lasted from March through September of 1986, as opposed to the three to four weeks that it would normally take for an S&L that size, because "Madison Guaranty's problems were so severe and its records were so poor."476476.	Clark, 1/30/96 Hrg. p. 14.    Moreover, Madison Guaranty's management actively obstructed the examination by retaining needed loan files or withholding information.477477.	Clark, 1/30/96 Hrg. p. 15.    <BR>
  	C.	Federal Regulators Oust Mr. McDougal from Madison <BR>
	On June 19, 1986, Walter Faulk, the FHLBB's Supervisory Agent responsible for Madison Guaranty, issued the preliminary report of the examination.478478.	O'Melveny & Meyers Document CCBW885-887.    This report was so devastating that the Arkansas Securities Commissioner Beverly Bassett Schaffer believed it "effectively put Madison out of business."479479.	O'Melveny & Meyers, Document CCBW884    	<BR>
	Curiously, on July 2, 1986, Ms. Schaffer forwarded a letter which Mr. Faulk had sent to Madison Guaranty, to Samuel Bratton, then Counsel to Governor Clinton, with a personal note attached.  The note stated, "Madison Guaranty is in pretty serious trouble.  Because of Bill's relationship with McDougal we probably ought to talk about it."480480.	O'Melveny & Meyers Document CCBW884.    Mr. Bratton, who had already spoken with Governor Clinton several times about Madison Guaranty's financial difficulties, was well aware of the Governor's personal ties to Mr. McDougal.481481.	Bratton, 2/13/96 Hrg. pp. 6,9.     After Mr. Bratton received the note, he spoke with Ms. Schaffer about the possible closure of Madison Guaranty by the FHLBB,482482.	Bratton, 2/13/96 Hrg. p. 7.   and the upcoming FHLBB meeting in Dallas on July 24 where Madison's financial problems would be discussed.483483.483.	O'Melveny & Meyers Document CCBW885.    After Mr. Bratton received Ms. Schaffer's memorandum he contacted Governor Clinton, telling him of the FHLBB's plans.484484.	Bratton, 2/13/96 Hrg. p. 7.    Mr. Bratton also went to see Betsey Wright, the Governor's Chief of Staff, and they "together carried this to the Governor rather than my sending it in his normal mail."485485.	Wright, 1/26/96 Dep. p. 229.    <BR>
	Although the exact date of Governor Clinton's receipt of the copy of the FHLBB's letter is unknown, he certainly received it before July 14, 1986.486486.	Wright, 1/26/96 Dep. p. 230.    It is clear that Governor Clinton knew that Mr. McDougal -- his business partner, friend, and client of his wife's law firm -- was in serious financial trouble before it was ever made public.<BR>
	Results of an examination by the FHLBB are to be kept confidential, and "[t]he law requires that release of an exam report be restricted."487487.	Clark, 1/30/96 Hrg. p. 115.    Bank regulators should not share the results of exams with anyone outside of the regulatory agency.   James Clark, the FHLBB examiner, could not think of one reason why it would be appropriate for a state bank regulator to tip off the governor's office with regard to an ongoing bank examination.488488.	Clark, 1/30/96 Hrg. pp. 116-17.    Moreover, Mr. Clark testified that, given Governor Clinton's business relationship with Mr. McDougal, the "tip off" from Ms. Schaffer certainly "had the appearance of a conflict."489489.	Clark, 1/30/96 Hrg. p. 120.   <BR>
	On July 11, 1986 the Federal Home Loan Bank Board met to discuss Madison.  Ms. Schaffer, her associate Charles Handley, nine persons from the FHLBB, and the Madison Board of Directors were all present.490490.	RTC Document 001395.     Mr. and Mrs. McDougal were not present.491491.	RTC Document 001395.    Mr. Clark expressed some concerns about Ms. Schaffer's presence at the FHLBB meeting because she had performed legal work for Madison Guaranty when she was in private practice, and he viewed that as a conflict with her oversight capacity as the Arkansas Securities Commissioner.492492.	Clark, 1/30/96 Hrg. p. 36.  <BR>
	During the meeting, Dawn Pulcer of the FHLBB mentioned that she thought Ms. Schaffer's conduct during the meeting was peculiar.  Ms. Pulcer's contemporaneous notes of the meeting reflect that during the course of discussion at the FHLBB meeting Ms. Schaffer appeared to be frowning, and asked only one question: "[w]ho is representing the McDougals?"493493.	RTC Document 1403, 7432.    Ms. Pulcer stated that she "[t]hought it was a little odd.  I, too, would have expected her to say something in support of the actions that the Federal Home Loan Bank Board supervisory authorities were taking."494494.	Pulcer, 1/30/96 Hrg. pp. 122-123.  <BR>
	At this meeting, FHLBB determined that Mr. McDougal and Mr. Latham should be removed from Madison.  On July 14, 1986, just three days after this meeting, Ms. Wright wrote a telling message to Governor Clinton that reads:<BR>
		White Water stock<BR>
		(McDougal's company)<BR></P>

<P>		Do you still have? (pursuant<BR>
		to Jim's current problems<BR>
					</P>	
<P>		If so, I'm worried about<BR>
		it.495495.	Williams & Connolly Document DKSN013309. <BR></P>


<P>Governor Clinton responded by writing "No-Do not have any more---B."496496.	Williams & Connolly Document DKSN013309.    Ms. Wright claimed it was then well known that Mr. McDougal had been removed from the bank.  But the local newspaper did not report the event until July 25, 1996, eleven days later.497497.	Wright, 1/26/96 Dep. p. 232.    <BR>
	Curiously, on the very same day that Ms. Wright inquired about Governor Clinton's relationship with Mr. McDougal, Mrs. Clinton wrote a letter to Mr. McDougal and Mr. Latham terminating the Rose Law Firm's retainer agreement with Madison Guaranty.498498.	Williams & Connolly Documents DKSN001168-9.    Along with the letter, Mrs. Clinton sent a check from the Rose Law Firm refunding Madison Guaranty's outstanding retainer balance.499499.	Williams & Connolly Documents DKSN001168-9.      <BR>
	Mrs. Clinton has given at least two different accounts regarding why she terminated the Rose Law Firm's representation of Madison Guaranty.500500.	Associated Press, 4/22/94, "Text of First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton's News Conference in the State Dining Room of the White House."; H. Clinton, Interrogatory Answers to RTC 2/4/94 pp.36-37; H. Clinton, 2/14/96 FDIC Interview pp. 91-96.    In a press conference on April 22, 1994, Mrs. Clinton said that the Rose Law Firm's relationship with Madison Guaranty was terminated because Madison Guaranty could not meet the requirements imposed by Ms. Schaffer for the issuance of preferred stock.501501.	Associated Press, 4/22/94, "Text of First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton's News Conference in the State Dining Room of the White House." p. 15.    However, in response to interrogatories on February 4, 1994, Mrs. Clinton said that the representation of Madison Guaranty was terminated due to "the increasing work the Rose Law Firm was doing for FSLIC ... the firm had decided in early July, 1986, generally to avoid taking on any new or expanded representations of S&L's."502502.	H. Clinton Interrogatory Answers to RTC, 5/24/95 pp.36-37.   In Mrs. Clinton's February 14, 1996 interview with the FDIC, Mrs. Clinton stated that the letter to Madison Guaranty was written in direct response to a memorandum written by Herb Rule, then the managing partner of the Rose Law Firm, to all attorneys.503503.	H. Clinton, 2/14/96 FDIC Interview p. 92.    <BR>
II.	Governor Clinton Provides Benefits to James McDougal and Madison S&L<BR></P>

<P>	During the time when Mr. McDougal was running Madison Guaranty and carrying the Clintons on the Whitewater investment, Governor Clinton acted favorably on Mr. McDougal's various proposals before the state.  Indeed, substantial evidence supports Mr. McDougal's claims that he had "clout" with the Governor.504504.	Lyon, 12/14/95 Dep. pp. 28-29.     <BR>
	A.	Governor Clinton Steers Valuable State Leases to Madison<BR></P>

<P>	Governor Clinton exercised the power of his office to steer two lucrative lease contracts to Madison Guaranty.505505.	Herr, 4/24/96 Hrg. pp. 18-19.    Helen Herr, the former Leasing Administrator for Arkansas State Building Services ("ASBS"), testified that she first learned in January or February 1984 that Madison Guaranty was interested in leasing space to Arkansas Housing Development Agency ("AHDA") during a meeting in the office of Paul Mallard.506506.	Herr, 2/13/96 Dep. pp. 15-16.    Mr. Mallard, the Director of ASBS called Ms. Herr into his office to meet Susan McDougal. Mr. Mallard told Ms. Herr that the McDougals were developing a building on South Main Street in Little Rock, in Quapaw Quarter, and that they had additional office space that they wanted to rent.507507.	Herr, 2/13/96 Dep. pp. 16-17.    This office space was difficult to lease because it was located in an unsafe part of Little Rock and the real estate market in Little Rock was soft. Many commercial landlords were eager to fill their office space with long term tenants.508508.	Herr, 4/24/96 Hrg. p. 10.<BR>
	In fall 1983, AHDA developed a need for additional office space.  ASBS was considering office space on Brookwood Drive that the Director of AHDA, Wooten Epes, felt would be suitable.509509.	Herr, 4/24/96 Hrg. p. 12.   After meeting with Mrs. McDougal, Mr. Mallard instructed Ms. Herr to examine the Madison office space.510510.	Herr, 4/24/96 Hrg. p. 13.    <BR>
	When Mr. Epes, AHSA's Director, complained to Ms. Herr about the Madison space, she recommended that he state his complaints in writing.  On March 5, 1984, Mr. Epes wrote a letter to Ms. Herr rejecting the proposal that AHDA lease the office space from Madison.511511.	Herr, 4/24/96 Hrg. p. 16.    Mr. Epes was concerned that the Madison space was not sufficiently large and was not located in a safe part of Little Rock.512512.	Herr, 4/24/96 Hrg. p. 15.    When Ms. Herr brought Mr. Epes' letter to Mr. Mallard's attention, Mr. Mallard told her that the leasing contract was going to Madison Guaranty because the McDougals were "friends" of the Governor.513513.	Herr, 2/13/96 Dep. p. 34-35.    Ms. Herr specifically testified: "When I presented the objections from Mr. Epes about the Madison space, [Mallard] said that the governor's office wants us to lease that space ... and that the McDougals were friends" of Governor and Mrs. Clinton.514514.	Herr, 2/13/96 Dep. p. 34-35.    Mr. Mallard also told her that "they weren't going to consider other proposals" because the "governor's office wants us to lease this space and that's the way it's going to be."515515.	Herr, 4/24/96 Hrg. p. 19.    Mr. Epes took his concerns to the Governor.516516.	Herr, 4/24/96 Hrg. p. 24.    Mr. Epes testified that Governor Clinton refused to overrule Mr. Mallard's decision, and that was the Governor's final word.517517.	Herr, 4/24/96 Hrg. p. 24.  <BR>
	On April 1, 1984, the AHDA entered into a lease with Madison Guaranty.518518.	Arkansas State Building Services Document, 2/13/96 (Not numbered.)    The lease was for a 60-month term at $4,800 per month.519519.	Arkansas State Building Services Document, 2/13/96 (Not numbered.)    The contract realized nearly $300,000 in payments to Madison.520520.	Arkansas State Building Services Document, 2/13/96 (Not numbered.)   <BR>
	In 1985 AHDA became the Arkansas Development Finance Authority ("ADFA").521521.	Arkansas State Building Services Document, 2/13/96 (Not numbered.)    ADFA subsequently sought to lease additional office space for their new employees.522522.	Arkansas State Building Services Document, 2/13/96 (Not numbered.)    As a result of this change, ADFA entered into another contract with Madison.523523.	Arkansas State Building Services Document, 2/13/96 (Not numbered.)    In August 1987, however, ADFA canceled its lease with Madison because it needed still more space, which was the concern that Mr. Epes had from the beginning.524524.	Arkansas State Building Services Document, 2/13/96 (Not Numbered.)  <BR>
	Moreover, the State of Arkansas, through ASBS, leased space in an additional building from Mr. McDougal, in Quapaw Quarter, to house the Arkansas Revenue Department.525525.	Arkansas State Building Services Document, 2/13/96 (Not numbered.)    Other than the three leases entered into with McDougal-owned entities, Ms. Herr could not recall any other leases the state entered for office space in the lease in Quapaw Quarter.526526.	Arkansas State Building Services Document, 2/13/96 (Not numbered.)  <BR>
	Don Denton, a Madison loan officer, believed that the state leases were a political payback by Governor Clinton to the McDougals.  Mr. Denton testified that the connection "[s]tood out like a beacon at night."527527.	Denton, 5/7/96 Dep. p. 81.  	<BR>
	B.	McDougal Holds a Questionable 1985 Fundraiser for Clinton<BR>
</P> 
<P>	On April 4, 1985, James McDougal hosted a fundraiser for Governor Clinton at Madison Guaranty to raise money to pay off the Governor's outstanding personal debt from his 1984 gubernatorial campaign.528528.	Williams & Connolly Document DKSN001259; 4/24/95 Pillsbury Report p. 102.    In the closing days of that race, Governor Clinton had obtained an unsecured personal loan in the amount of $50,000 from the Bank of Cherry Valley. 529529.	Smith, 4/23/96 Dep. p. 33, 35.    <BR>
	The exact amount of money raised at the event is not known.  The campaign finance report listing the contributions received at the fundraiser is missing from the Pulaski County Clerk's office and has never been located.  By all accounts, however, the fundraiser netted more than $30,000 to pay off Governor Clinton's personal debt.1      1 	Betsey Wright, who ran Governor Clinton's 1984 campaign, testified that $30,500 was raised at the event.  (Wright, 1/26/96 Dep. p. 278.)  Ms. Wright, the custodian of records for that campaign, she based that figure on checks from 17 persons or entities that she said had been collected in connection with the fundraiser.  (O'Melveny & Myers Production CCBW-0017-24.)  Mr. McDougal has stated in various interviews that the fundraiser raised about $35,000.  (E.g. New York Times, 12/15/93 p. B8.)  Notes taken by Susan Thomases in 1992 of a conversation she had with Sherry Curry reflect that "MacD FR raised $39,150."  (Willkie Farr & Gallagher Production ST 45.)<BR>
	Four $3,000 checks were collected at the fundraiser.530530.	RTC Document B-1, C-1, D-3, D-5.    The names on the checks were James B. and Susan McDougal, J.W. Fulbright, Ken Peacock, and Dean Landrum.531531.	RTC Document B-1, C-1, D-3, D-5.    J.W. Fulbright is the late former Senator.  Ken Peacock is the son of former Madison director and borrower Charles Peacock.532532.	Peacock, 4/24/96 Hrg. p. 169.    Dene Landrum, who is now deceased, was Mr Peacock's business associate.533533.	Peacock, 4/24/96 Hrg. p. 169-170.     His first name was misspelled on the check as "Dean."534534.	RTC Document D-5.  <BR>
	All four checks were dated April 4, 1985.535535.	RTC Document B-1, C-1, D-3, D-5.    The James McDougal check was written on the McDougal's personal checking account at Madison Guaranty and was signed by Susan McDougal.536536.	O'Melveny & Myers Document CCBW-0017.    The Fulbright, Peacock, and Landrum checks were Madison Guaranty cashier's checks bearing numbers 2496, 2497, and 2498, respectively.537537.	RTC Document B-1, D-3, D-5.    <BR>
	There is strong evidence suggesting that the $3,000 check in Senator Fulbright's name was purchased by Mr. McDougal out of funds from his Flowerwood Farms account.  Senator Fulbright did not attend the fundraiser, although he was expected to.538538.	Wright, 1/26/96 Dep. p. 280; W. Clinton, Interrogatory Answers to RTC, 5/24/95 p. 40.   In 1994, Kent Goss, an RTC investigator, questioned Senator Fulbright's lawyer, a former aide to the Senator, about the $3,000 check.539539.	House Document House W/W RPT. 2953-2954.   1      1 	Senator Fulbright himself could not be interviewed because he had a stroke several years ago and died in February 1995.  Mr. Goss wrote that although it was "evident" that Senator Fulbright was "a meticulous record-keeper," there was no record of any charitable donation in the amount of $3,000 between 1984 and 1991.540540.	House Document House W/W RPT. 2953-2954.    Nor did Senator Fulbright's bank statements reflect a $3,000 debit during the relevant time.541541.	House Document House W/W RPT. 2953-2954.    Senator Fulbright's lawyer added that he believed that the Senator had "no knowledge" of a $3,000 contribution to Governor Clinton.542542.	House Document House W/W RPT. 2953-2954.   <BR>
	The Pillsbury Madison & Sutro Report on Madison Guaranty and Whitewater commissioned by the Resolution Trust Corporation attempted to trace the source of funds of the Fulbright check.543543.	4/24/95 Pillsbury Report pp.108-110.     According to this report, on April 4, 1985, the same day that the Fulbright check was issued, a $3,000 check payable to Madison Guaranty was written on Flowerwood Farms' account at Madison Guaranty.544544.	4/24/95 Pillsbury Report pp.108-110.     The Flowerwood Farms check was apparently deposited in the Madison cashier's check account, as it was encoded with "7001312" -- the number of that account.545545.	4/24/95 Pillsbury Report p.109.    A $3,000 deposit was posted in the account 7001312 on April 4, 1985.546546.	4/24/95 Pillsbury Report p.109.  <BR>
	Despite this evidence, the Pillsbury Report erroneously concluded that the link between the Flowerwood Farms check and the Fulbright check "has not been conclusively confirmed" because Madison Guaranty issued two other cashier's checks for $3,000 on April 4, 1985, i.e., those in the names of Ken Peacock and Dean Landrum.547547.	4/24/95 Pillsbury Report p. 109.     However, Charles Peacock, an attendee and donor at the fundraiser, has admitted to purchasing those two checks.548548.	Peacock, 4/24/96 Hrg. p. 169-170.    The Pillsbury report recognized: "[I]f the Ken Peacock and Dene Landrum cashier's checks were funded by Charles Peacock III, the Flowerwood Farms check could have funded the remaining $3,000 cashier's check, the one from Fulbright."549549.	4/24/95 Pillsbury Report p. 109.  <BR>
	Mr. Peacock's testimony establishes, and the documentary evidence confirms, that he caused the checks to be issued.  Mr. Peacock admitted that he purchased the $3,000 checks in the names of his son and Dene Landrum.550550.	Peacock, 1/16/96 Dep. pp. 22-23.    Mr. Peacock said he bought the check in his son's name because he thought it might help his son secure a job with Governor Clinton.551551.	Peacock, 1/16/96 Dep. pp. 22-23.    He testified that he bought the check in Mr. Landrum's name because Mr. Landrum wanted to help the child of a friend receive a scholarship awarded by Governor Clinton.552552.	Peacock, 1/16/96 Dep. p. 23.   <BR>
	The documentary evidence is consistent with Mr. Peacock's admission that he procured the checks.  On April 4, 1985, Mr. Peacock wrote a $6,000 counter check payable to Madison Guaranty, apparently on his account #15253.553553.	RTC Document D-2.    The check was encoded with "7001312" -- the number of the Madison cashier's checking account.  That same day, Mr. Peacock purchased a cashier's check for $4.554554.	RTC Document D-5.    Madison Guaranty charged a $2 fee for cashier's checks.555555.	4/24/95 Pillsbury Report p. 106.    When asked whether he bought this cashier's check to pay the $4 fee on the two $3,000 checks, Mr. Peacock said, "I'm sure that's what happened."556556.	Peacock, 1/16/96 Dep. pp. 27-28.    It seems clear that since Mr. Peacock purchased two of the $3,000 cashiers checks, the third $3,000 check was purchased with proceeds from Flowerwood Farms.<BR>
	There is evidence that Mr. Peacock purchased the Ken Peacock and Dean Landrum checks with proceeds diverted from loans made by Madison Guaranty.  <BR>
	On the day of the fundraiser, April 4, 1985, Dixie Continental Leasing, a company owned by Mr. Peacock, purchased 29.77 acres of land on Woodson Lateral Road for $335,000.557557.	Peacock, 12/10/86 Borod & Huggins Interview p. 5.    Most of the sale was financed by Madison Guaranty with a $297,000 mortgage.558558.	RTC Document A-3, A-8; Peacock, 12/20/86 Borod & Huggins Interview p. 107; RTC Production A-6.  <BR>
  Mr. Peacock borrowed an additional $50,000 from Madison Guaranty in his own name to fund the down payment on the property.559559.	RTC Document E-1.      The loan was executed on April 5, 1985, but was funded on April 4, 1985, with a $50,000 Madison Guaranty check payable to Mr. Peacock.560560.	RTC Document E-1, D-1.    The loan was secured by commercial air conditioning equipment appraised at $273,000 but ultimately sold as scrap by Madison Guaranty for $1,500.561561.	Peacock, 4/24/96 Hrg. p. 173.  <BR>
	On April 5, 1985, Mr. Peacock wrote a check for $38,940 to Quapaw Title Co. to pay the down payment on the Woodson Lateral Road property.562562.	RTC Document E-8.    The check was deposited in Madison Guaranty.563563.	RTC Document E-9.    There is no documentary evidence indicating what happened to the remaining $11,060.  Mr. Peacock does not remember how the remaining $11,060, a sum sufficient to fund the checks to Governor Clinton, was spent.564564.	Peacock, 1/16/96 Dep. p. 43.    Moreover, he does not recall what funds he used to pay for the cashier's checks:  "I don't remember how I paid for them, whether I paid for them with a check or whether I paid for them out of funds or what I did."565565.	Peacock, 1/16/96 Dep. p. 26.  <BR>
	The Pillsbury Report concludes that the source of funds for Mr. Ken Peacock's and Mr. Landrum's checks "cannot be established from the available documentation,"566566.	4/24/95 Pillsbury Report p. 107.     because Mr. Peacock's April 1985 Madison Guaranty bank statement is missing.567567.	4/24/95 Pillsbury Report p. 107.

<P><H2>PREFACE</H2>

<P>The central question that faced the Special Committee is:  Did Bill Clinton misuse the powers of the Presidency?  The answer is a clear and unequivocal "no."
<P>A secondary question is whether, prior to his election as President, Mr. Clinton used his official position in the State of Arkansas improperly to provide favored treatment to business associates or others.  In its exhaustive review of various allegations extending back to the 1970s in some instances, the Committee examined in excruciating detail a number of matters in Arkansas ranging from the handling of water and sewer legislation to state regulation of the sale of alcoholic beverages.  Again, the clear conclusion is that then-Governor Clinton did not abuse his office.
<P>Having failed to tarnish the President, the Majority turned its attention to Mrs. Clinton's private law practice in Arkansas more than ten years ago.  The Majority launched a massive hunt for some way in which to contradict statements made by Mrs. Clinton during the last four years.  Again, no credible evidence has been put forward to show that Mrs. Clinton engaged in any improper, much less illegal, conduct.
<P>The public deserves an objective report that separates the facts developed in the Senate Whitewater inquiry from the superheated and untenable conclusions that pervade the Majority's report.  Unfortunately, the extension of these hearings directly into the presidential campaign season has provoked a high degree of partisanship, which has undermined the objectivity of this investigation.  Partisanship has colored the Majority's decisions in conducting the inquiry and in reaching conclusions that clearly are intended for political impact.  It is now evident that this Committee's business easily could have been concluded within the original February 29, 1996 deadline.  When a parallel situation presented itself as the Iran-Contra hearings threatened to spill over into the political season, Democrats concurred in bringing the hearings to a prompt close.  That was the right decision and one that future Senate committees should follow as a more worthy precedent than the Whitewater example.
<P>The Majority's pattern throughout these hearings has been to construct conclusions first and then to discard the facts as they become inconvenient.  One after another, the partisan conspiracy theories about Whitewater -- from the alleged shredding of documents at the Rose Law Firm, to the so-called "mystery phone call," to the "all-important" White House e-mails -- have turned into dry holes.
<P>Lacking any credible case against the President, the Majority is now engaging in a blatantly political game of "tag" by tarring several witnesses with unsupportable suggestions of perjury in a bid to grab media attention.  The political grandstanding of these "perjury referrals" is a tactic also used after the 1994 hearings.  Margaret Williams, for instance -- a favorite target of the Majority -- has passed two lie detector tests, which corroborate her testimony that she did not remove documents from Foster's office on the night of his death.  Yet, the Majority seeks to discount Williams's lie detector tests -- performed first by a retired FBI polygraph instructor and confirmed by a present FBI expert under the supervision of the Independent Counsel.  In the bargain, the Majority report takes on the reliability of polygraph testing, which the FBI has depended on for decades in investigations involving the highest levels of national security.
<P>Taken as a whole, the Majority's approach to its report has been to hammer evidence -- no matter how ill-fitting -- into the precast mold of its conclusions.  A perfect example of this refusal to modify its preordained conclusion by reference to the facts is revealed by the Majority's treatment of the April 5, 1985 fundraiser hosted by James McDougal for Governor Clinton at Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan.  The Majority began the inquiry with the conclusion that there was a quid pro quo involving the fundraiser and the decision of an Arkansas state agency -- ADFA -- to lease office space from Madison Guaranty.  To a fair-minded investigator, two obstacles to reading such a conclusion would be presented:  1) the fact that the lease for office space was entered into more than a full year before McDougal's fundraiser, and 2) the evidence showed that Governor Clinton played no role in selecting the office site or negotiating the terms of the lease.  When the evidence at the public hearing demonstrated the circumstances under which the Madison space was chosen, a Member of the Majority registered his consternation at this departure from the Republican game plan:
<P>Mr. Chairman, isn't the point here simply to draw a conclusion that [then-Governor Clinton] played a major role in the selection of this building?
  Inconveniently, the evidence once again rebutted the preconceived conclusion, yet that conclusion is the one relied upon by the Majority in its final report.
<P>More than finding no abuse of office by Bill Clinton, the evidence gathered by the Committee shows that then-Governor Clinton demonstrated independence from political supporters doing business with State government.  Three examples from the Committee's exhaustive review of Governor Clinton's twelve-year tenure as governor of Arkansas are representative of our findings in this area.  In 1983, Marlin Jackson, the Arkansas State Banking Commissioner, informed Governor Clinton of bank regulatory problems at the Bank of Kingston, a small bank in northern Arkansas that James McDougal purchased after leaving a senior post in Governor Clinton's first administration. Jackson testified that he mentioned the Bank of Kingston problem as a "litmus test" to see if the young governor would seek to influence Jackson and obtain favorable treatment for a political supporter.  Clinton passed Jackson's test: Jackson testified that Governor Clinton told him:

<P>You do whatever you need to do to be a good, no, to be a great Bank Commissioner and don't worry about the political consequences.  It doesn't matter who is involved.  I'll take the political heat.  You just do whatever you need to do to be a great Bank Commissioner.
<P>Four years later, in another situation involving James McDougal, Governor Clinton showed the same good judgment and respect for the independence of state regulatory officials.  McDougal requested a meeting with Governor Clinton and State Health Department officials to present a grievance about unfair treatment by state sanitarians inspecting sewage disposal systems at one of the Madison Guaranty real estate developments.  McDougal behaved badly at the meeting, attacking the Health Department officials and accusing them of misconduct.  Governor Clinton supported the state officials at the meeting.  He reprimanded McDougal for his conduct in front of Health Department officials.  Most important, after the meeting, Governor Clinton pulled aside Tom Butler, the Deputy Director of the State Health Department, and told him to "do what you have to do, and you will not hear another word from me."  Once again, Governor Clinton made it perfectly clear to a state regulator that James McDougal should not receive any special treatment.
<P>One final example of Governor Clinton's actions in Arkansas is worth noting.  About 1984, Dan Lasater, a strong political supporter of Governor Clinton who had helped Clinton regain the Governor's office in 1982 after an upset loss in 1980, requested a meeting to complain to the Governor that his investment firm was not getting its fair share of the state bond business.  Governor Clinton met with Lasater, listened to his complaint, then told him that he should make his case to the appropriate State officials.  Although it would have been easy for him to do so, Governor Clinton did not tell Lasater that he would intervene in the matter.  Lasater left the meeting "disappointed" that he had not obtained the result he had hoped to obtain.  Again, Governor Clinton did not intervene on behalf of a political supporter.
<P>These examples lead a fair-minded reader to the same conclusion that will follow from a review of the entire, lengthy report:  Governor Clinton did not misuse his office, as Governor of Arkansas, or as President.
<P>These examples also underscore another important point.  Governor Clinton, of course, was an elected public official when these events took place.  As an elected official he was answerable to his constituents, and it was his responsibility to listen to their complaints.  All elected public officials, at the state, local, and even the national level, must do this -- it is part of the job.  To do this job properly, however, a public official must exercise good judgment, so as to be responsive to constituents without going too far and interfering with the actions of career government officials who also are discharging their responsibilities.  Governor Clinton's actions some ten years ago in Arkansas, as illustrated, met the test then of proper conduct by an elected official, and they meet that test now.
<P>The venom with which the Majority focuses its attack on Hillary Rodham Clinton is surprising, even in the context of the investigation.  No attempt is made to place into perspective the relative importance to the American people of whether Mrs. Clinton has a specific recollection today of every memorandum, phone call, and detail of every case she handled in her private law practice in Little Rock over a decade ago.
<P>Every act is portrayed in its most sinister light, every failure of recollection is treated as though the standard for human experience is total recall and photographic memory.
<P>Perhaps the most sensationalized conclusions of the Majority involved the handling of Vincent Foster's papers.  The crux of the disagreement between White House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum and Deputy Attorney General Philip Heymann was whether Nussbaum's insistence on being the one to review Foster's files in the presence of Justice Department lawyers and law enforcement officials would create an unfortunate appearance problem for the White House.  Heymann agreed that, legally, the Park Police investigators had no right to enter the office and search the files, nor could Justice Department lawyers obtain a search warrant or subpoena.  While Heymann was clearly prescient about the public and political fallout from Nussbaum's decision, who is to say that Nussbaum wasn't right also in believing that even if the Justice Department lawyers had taken part in the search, critics of the Administration would simply charge a broader conspiracy?
<P>Irresponsible claims of possible obstruction of justice simply ignore the testimony of law enforcement officials who came before the Committee:  that the investigation into Vincent Foster's death -- the only investigation involving the review of the office files -- was not obstructed; that the investigators were provided every document or file they requested; that the investigators had absolutely no interest in reviewing financial records or files involving personal investments of the Clintons such as Whitewater; and that the investigators' interest was limited to reviewing a suicide note or other information bearing on the cause for Foster's suicide.
<P>The Majority's pursuit of White House officials involved in searching for a suicide note in the aftermath of Foster's death is equally irresponsible.  Senator Dodd captured the spirit of the Majority's onslaught during a hearing in November, 1995:
<P><P>Senator Dodd.  Mr. Chairman, just on this point, and I think it is very important, this gets to the reality.  But what I was getting at earlier and what we're doing here in a sense is there are sort of three fact situations.  You get a witness that says well, I don't recall.  The immediate accusation is you're being disingenuous.
<P><P><P>If you have witnesses with conflicting testimony, the allegation is someone's lying.  And if you have witnesses that have consistent statements, it's a conspiracy.
<P><P><P>This is getting ridiculous. So you're trapped no matter what you say ... You're either disingenuous, lying or conspiring, and that's just foolishness.
<P>The game of leaking information has marred the Committee's credibility throughout these proceedings.  Often, distorted or even baseless charges have been disseminated through faceless leaks.  The recent, well-orchestrated leak of the Majority report is but part of a pattern.
<P>The supposed short-term benefits of leaking will be offset by the longer-term diminution of credibility that the Majority must suffer for these blatantly political and unfair tactics.
<P>The Minority report was not leaked.  It was released according to the rules.  In it, the subjects set forth in Senate Resolution 120 are analyzed according to the testimony and documents presented.  We look forward to the opportunity to present the facts to the American public in contrast to the overheated assertions by the Majority, which have characterized its approach to this investigation.
<P>Not including the Senate Banking Committee's hearings in 1994, the Senate Whitewater Committee in 1995 and 1996 met for more than 300 hours in open sessions, taking 10,729 pages of hearing testimony in 51 hearings and 8 public meetings.  The Committee received hearing testimony from 159 witnesses and took more than 35,000 pages of deposition testimony from 245 persons.  Hundreds of thousands of pages of documents have been provided to the Committee by various government departments, agencies, and individuals.
<P>The White House has produced more than 15,000 pages of documents, and the Clintons' attorney has produced nearly 30,000 pages more.
<P>Direct costs of the various Whitewater inquiries now exceed $31,849,795 (as of May, 1996), including:  $400,000 from the Senate Banking Committee's 1994 hearings (Senate Resolution 229), $950,000 through the initial charter of the D'Amato hearings (Senate Resolution 120), approved May 17, 1995), and another $450,000 for an extension this year approved by the Senate (Senate Resolution 246, approved April 17, 1996); $3,800,000 for the Resolution Trust Corporation's contract with the Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro law firm, for the production of its report; and $26,249,795 by the Office of the Independent Counsel (through May, 1996).  Costs of the various Whitewater inquiries in the House of Representatives and agency work to comply with inquiries while not separately accounted for amount to significant additional sums.
<P>This has been the longest-running congressional investigation of any sitting president, far longer than Watergate or Iran-Contra -- both of which involved actual abuse of government power.  The facts gathered by the Committee are more than enough to close this chapter.  The American people deserve to know, and now can take comfort in knowing, that this year-long investigation shows no misconduct or abuse of power by their President or First Lady.


<H2><P>SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS:<BR>
<P>WASHINGTON MATTERS</H2>

<P>A.<P>Jean Lewis's 1992 RTC Criminal Referral

<P>On September 2, 1992, two months before the presidential election, an investigator in the Kansas City field office of the Resolution Trust Corporation submitted a criminal referral to the Department of Justice relating to the failure of Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan Association.  The handling of the referral, which named the Clintons as possible witnesses to an alleged check kiting scheme at Madison Guaranty, was the subject of extensive investigation and public hearings by the Special Committee.
<P>The evidence showed that the 1992 referral was prepared by a politically motivated investigator who pressed the investigation with the hope of damaging Bill Clinton's chances in the 1992 presidential election.  The referral failed to allege any evidence of a crime and gratuitously named the Clintons as witnesses despite the absence of any reasonable basis to believe that the Clintons knew about the matters alleged in the referral.
<P>The allegations contained in the 1992 referral have been repeatedly rejected by federal prosecutors and other investigators.  Career officials of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, and the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Arkansas all reviewed the allegations and properly rejected the 1992 referral as a basis for prosecution.  The Office of the Independent Counsel, which subsequently assumed responsibility for the investigation of the 1992 referral, has brought no criminal charges arising from the referral's allegations.  The law firm of Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro, which the RTC retained to investigate civil claims arising from the failure of Madison, found no evidence to support the allegations contained in the 1992 referral and concluded that those allegations were insufficient to support even a civil cause of action based on fraud.
<P>The evidence showed that the Clinton Administration made no effort to interfere with the proper handling of the 1992 referral following its submission.  If anything, the evidence indicated that it was senior officials of the Bush Administration -- at both the White House and the Department of Justice -- who exhibited an unusually high level of interest in the referral prior to the 1992 presidential election.  The United States Attorney in Little Rock, however, steadfastly refused to respond to political pressures and properly declined to take any action on the referral until after the election.
<P>B.<P>The Investigations of David Hale
<P>The Special Committee conducted an extensive review of the federal government's handling of its various investigations of David Hale's fraudulent operation of Capital Management Services, Inc., Hale's small business investment company.  The Committee viewed those federal investigations as particularly sensitive because once Hale came under criminal investigation he alleged publicly that as Governor of Arkansas, Bill Clinton participated in discussions relating to an illegal loan Hale made to Susan McDougal back in 1986.  The Committee considered allegations that the Clinton Administration sought to silence Hale by interfering in the federal investigations of Hale's criminal activities.
<P>The Special Committee's investigation and public hearings established that the Clinton Administration made no effort to delay or obstruct the investigations and prosecution of Hale by the Small Business Administration and the Department of Justice.  To the contrary, the evidence showed that the Small Business Administration promptly submitted a criminal referral describing Hale's fraudulent conduct and that the United States Attorney's Office in Little Rock quickly obtained a federal grand jury indictment against Hale.  The evidence showed further that despite his extraordinary efforts to manipulate the criminal justice system in his favor, Hale received no preferential treatment from any federal government official.
<P>In late 1993, White House officials obtained from the Small Business Administration a report that the agency had provided to an oversight committee of the House of Representatives.  The evidence established that no sensitive information was contained in this report or any of its attachments and that the motives of the White House officials who obtained the report were totally innocent.  More important, the evidence established that White House officials made no efforts to affect the way the federal investigations of Hale were handled.
<P>C.<P> The RTC's Handling of the 1993 Criminal Referrals
<P>Jean Lewis submitted nine additional criminal referrals relating to Madison Guaranty in October 1993.  The Special Committee held several days of public hearings on allegations by Lewis that senior officials at the RTC interfered with her investigation.  Lewis's principal allegation concerned a "legal review" of the referrals conducted by lawyers in the Kansas City field office of the RTC prior to the referrals' submission to the Department of Justice.  Lewis claimed that the review was "unprecedented" and that it was a blatant attempt to derail her referrals.
<P>The evidence established that the legal review was mandated by a nationwide RTC policy that had been instituted four months earlier without regard to Madison Guaranty.  Contrary to Lewis's claim of interference, the legal review was conducted by career government lawyers and was intended simply to improve the quality of the referrals by making sure that allegations of possible criminal wrongdoing contained therein were supported by documents and other evidence.<P>  Lewis also claimed that in early 1994, as the RTC was conducting a follow-up civil investigation of Madison Guaranty, senior RTC officials in Washington sent RTC attorney April Breslaw to Kansas City in an attempt to influence the outcome of the investigation so as to avoid the filing of any civil lawsuits against the Clintons.  This claim, like all of Lewis' claims of interference, was shown by the Committee's investigation to be without any evidentiary basis.  The Special Committee's hearings showed that Lewis provided misleading testimony about her surreptitiously tape-recorded conversation with Breslaw.  The Committee heard no credible evidence that any senior RTC official interfered with any RTC investigation of Madison Guaranty.
<P>D.<P>The Justice Department's Handling of the Criminal Referrals
<P>The Special Committee also considered the Department of Justice's handling of the RTC criminal referrals.  Prior to the Special Committee's creation, there had been rampant speculation that Associate Attorney General Webster Hubbell had interfered with the Justice Department's investigation of the referrals and had acted to block their use as bases for criminal prosecutions.  This speculation found no evidentiary support.
<P>The Special Committee conducted an exhaustive inquiry into the Justice Department's handling of the RTC criminal referrals and came up with nothing to suggest that Hubbell or anyone else at the Justice Department interfered with the proper handling of the referrals.  To the contrary, the evidence established that Hubbell, who had no supervisory authority over the Justice Department's criminal division, never made any effort to affect the handling of the referrals and did not even know about their existence until many months after their submission.
<P>The evidence also showed that Paula Casey, the United States Attorney in Little Rock, properly handled her office's plea negotiations with Hale and later properly recused herself from further consideration of criminal referrals concerning Madison Guaranty and Capital Management Services, Inc.  Hale sought immunity from prosecution from Casey in exchange for what he claimed was incriminating information about high-ranking Arkansas politicians, but he refused to provide any factual details.  As required by Justice Department practice, Casey invited Hale to proffer his information to the government but declined to reach a plea bargain with him unless he first provided his information.  The Office of the Independent Counsel later followed the same approach.
<P>E.<P>White House Discussions of Beverly Bassett Schaffer in 1993-94
<P>It was alleged during the 1992 presidential campaign that Hillary Rodham Clinton obtained favored treatment for Madison Guaranty from the Arkansas Securities Department back in 1985 in a legal matter concerning a contemplated offering of preferred stock.  When the allegation arose in 1992, Beverly Bassett Schaffer, the Securities Commissioner in 1985, publicly refuted it.  Schaffer stated that Mrs. Clinton had neither sought nor received favored treatment for her client and that, contrary to the accusation, there was nothing either inappropriate or unique about Mrs. Clinton's inquiry into whether it was permissible for a state-chartered savings and loan institution to issue preferred stock for the purpose of increasing its capitalization.
<P>When allegations concerning the preferred stock issue surfaced again in late December 1993 and early January 1994, several White House officials recalled Schaffer's credible statements during the campaign.  White House officials thought it was important to determine whether Schaffer had made a correct legal judgment back in 1985 and, if so, whether she would be willing to speak out publicly again.  Although they correctly determined that it would not be at all improper for the White House to contact Schaffer for this purpose, White House officials chose not to contact her because of concerns that any such contacts would be mischaracterized as attempts to influence Schaffer's views on the propriety of Mrs. Clinton's 1985 conduct.
<P>The Special Committee held several days of public hearings on the activities of the so-called Whitewater Response Team at the White House in late 1993 and early 1994.  The Committee's hearings were full of testy exchanges and colorful language.  But at their conclusion, the hearings established that no White House official made any effort to influence the substance of Schaffer's statements about the preferred stock issue.  The evidence showed that the White House properly determined that Schaffer had made a correct legal judgment back in 1985 and then encouraged Schaffer to speak out publicly, as she had in 1992, to refute the false allegations of favoritism.
<P>F.<P>Use by the White House of Materials Related to the Office of Government Ethics' July 1994 Report on White House-Treasury Contacts
<P>The Special Committee held several days of public hearings to determine whether the White House Counsel's Office improperly received investigative materials underlying the Office of Government Ethics' July 1994 report on White House-Treasury contacts and, if so, whether the White House made any improper use of the materials in preparation for Congressional hearings.  The evidence showed that no improprieties occurred.
<P>The White House made no effort to interfere in any way with the investigation conducted by the Office of Government Ethics and the Inspectors General of the RTC and the FDIC.  That investigation was thorough and complete and resulted in a fully independent determination on the merits.
<P>The evidence showed that the White House Counsel had two entirely proper purposes in obtaining investigative materials -- to conduct a thorough internal White House review of the White House-Treasury contacts, and to prepare complete and accurate testimony to be provided to Congress.  The evidence established that the White House obtained no sensitive RTC information and that none of the deposition transcripts received were used improperly to affect the Congressional testimony of any White House witness.  The transmission of investigative materials to the White House had no effect whatsoever on any of the investigations conducted by the Office of Government Ethics, the Congress or the Independent Counsel.

<P>SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS:  ARKANSAS MATTERS
<P>The Special Committee devoted enormous resources to investigating a variety of allegations concerning matters taking place in Arkansas since 1978.  The allegations fell into three broad categories:  (1) allegations concerning the Clintons' personal finances; (2) allegations concerning Governor Clinton's conduct as Governor of Arkansas; and (3) allegations concerning Mrs. Clinton's work as a Rose Law Firm attorney.  After months of exhaustive investigation into Arkansas-related matters -- including more than 100 sworn depositions and 20 days of public hearings -- the allegations of improprieties remain unsupported by the evidence.  On the contrary, the evidence shows that neither the President nor Mrs. Clinton engaged in any improper, much less illegal, conduct in connection with any of the events in Arkansas that were examined in minute detail by the Special Committee over the past thirteen months.
<P>A.<P>WHITEWATER
<P><P>1.<P>THE INITIAL INVESTMENT
<P>On August 2, 1978, the McDougals and the Clintons purchased approximately 230 acres of undeveloped land in Flippin, Arkansas from a group of local investors known as the 101 River Development Corporation.  The property was bounded on one side by Arkansas Route 101 and on the other side by the White River.  Because the White River area was popular with sportsmen, James McDougal envisioned the property as a retirement and vacation development.  He named it Whitewater Estates.
<P>The McDougals and the Clintons paid $202,611 for the Whitewater property, slightly less than $900 per acre.  They financed this purchase with two bank loans.  The Special Committee investigated whether the McDougals and the Clintons received special treatment from the banks in obtaining these loans because Mr. Clinton was Arkansas Attorney General and a candidate for Governor when the loans were made.  The evidence, however, demonstrated that the McDougals and the Clintons did not receive any special treatment in connection with the making of the loans.  The loans were made on the same terms and at the same interest rates as similiar loans to other borrowers.  The bank that provided the first mortgage loan financed other real estate developments in the same area.  In addition, the testimony of the bank officials who made the Whitewater loans demonstrated that the Clintons were passive investors in the Whitewater project.  The banking officials who made the loans were pleased to have the oppotunity to make a loan to the McDougals and the Clintons, and one bank official actively solicited the loan business from Mr. Clinton.  Overall, the testimony of the bank officials who authorized and managed the loans established that the Clintons had little, if any, involvement in the financing of the investment.
<P><P>2.<P>MANAGEMENT OF THE WHITEWATER INVESTMENT
<P>From 1978 until 1986 the business affairs of the Whitewater development were managed by James and Susan McDougal, assisted by Charles James, the accountant who kept the books for Whitewater and other real estate developments managed by the McDougals.  The Special Committee's investigation of the Whitewater investment has confirmed what other investigations of Whitewater have found:  Records for the Whitewater investment were not properly maintained by the McDougals during the years that they managed the investment, and the Clintons did not receive regular and complete information about the investment from the McDougals.
<P>In 1986, after the McDougals left Arkansas and stopped attending to the affairs of Whitewater, Mrs. Clinton attempted to obtain information about the investment.  She contacted James to obtain corporate records, and she asked Yoly Redden, who then was the Clintons' personal tax preparer, to review the records and try to determine how much money the Clintons had put into Whitewater and what was the financial condition of the enterprise at that time.  The testimony that Redden and James provided to the Special Committee confirms that the Clintons were never well-informed about Whitewater.
<P><P>3.<P>THE RENEWALS OF THE WHITEWATER LOANS
<P>After the Clintons and McDougals incorporated Whitewater Development Company, Inc. in 1979, they transferred the land to the corporation, subject to the bank loan that was secured by the property, which was not assumed by corporation.  That loan was subsequently renewed or extended nine times before it was paid off on May 12, 1992.  The Committee devoted considerable attention to those loan renewals.  In particular, the Committee explored: (1) whether the loan received special treatment; and (2) whether the loan renewals were connected in any way to banking legislation enacted by the State of Arkansas in 1987 and 1988 that may have benefitted the bank that made the Whitewater loan.
<P>The evidence collected by the Special Committee demonstrated conclusively that the Whitewater loan renewal requests did not receive any special treatment.  The loan was fully collateralized and was personally guaranteed by the Clintons and the McDougals.  In addition, beginning in 1985, the bank received all income from lot sales.  Also, although two loan renewals (out of the total of nine renewals) coincidentally occurred at about the same time as the approval of state bank legislation, the evidence demonstrated that there was no connection between the loan renewal and the banking legislation.  The only connection between the Whitewater loan renewals and the branch banking legislation was a coincidence of timing.
<P><P>4.<P>THE WHITEWATER LOT 13 TRANSACTION
<P>The Committee also reviewed a loan to Mrs. Clinton from Madison Bank & Trust Company (previously known as the Bank of Kingston and not to be confused with Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan Association).  Mrs. Clinton borrowed $30,000 from that bank to finance a model home on Whitewater Estates lot 13.  The Committee looked into allegations that this loan violated banking regulations restricting loans outside a bank's designated loan territory.  The Committee found no evidence of any improprieties involving the Clintons with respect to this loan.
<P><P>5.<P>WHITEWATER TAX ISSUES
<P>The Special Committee conducted a limited review of matters pertaining to the Clintons' treatment of the Whitewater investment on their personal income tax returns and to the corporate tax filings of Whitewater Development Company, Inc.  The Committee's review of these matters, while not exhaustive, was sufficient to establish that (1) the Clintons' tax treatment of the Whitewater investment on their personal tax returns was appropriate based upon the limited information about the investment that they received and (2) the information about the investment they received was, in many instances, incomplete or incorrect, which resulted in some unintentional errors in the Clintons' personal tax returns.  These conclusions are consistent with the findings of other investigations of the Whitewater investment, particularly the Pillsbury Madison & Sutro 1994-96 investigation and the review of Whitewater accounting and tax matters conducted for the Clintons by Denver attorney James M. Lyons in March 1992.
<P>The evidence collected by the Special Committee shows that unlike many real estate investors during the time period of the Whitewater investment, the Clintons did not claim personal tax deductions for corporate losses incurred by Whitewater.  The Clintons' tax treatment of the Whitewater investment was conservative and reflected the economic substance of the transaction -- they only claimed tax deductions when they made legally deductible payments with their own funds.  The Special Committee found no evidence that the Clintons ever sought to obtain any improper tax benefits from their investment in Whitewater.
<P>As noted above, the Special Committee also found that records for the Whitewater investment were not properly maintained by the McDougals during the years they managed the investment, and the Clintons did not receive regular and complete information about the investment from the McDougals.  This poor recordkeeping and reporting resulted in some unintentional errors on the Clintons' personal tax filings.  Where the existence of an error has been established, the Clintons have, at their own initiative, paid additional taxes and interest to correct the errors.
<P>The Special Committee also reviewed whether or not the Clintons received actual or imputed income from the Whitewater investment that they had a legal obligation to report on their personal income tax returns.  As has been the case with all other investigations of Whitewater, the Special Committee found that the Clintons received no return on their Whitewater investment.  Although some esoteric tax theories have been advanced for the proposition that the Clintons should have recognized income on their personal tax returns in connection with payments on the land acquisition loans that were made with Whitewater corporate funds or funds contributed by the McDougals, those theories are not supported by the evidence obtained by the Special Committee.   All of the witnesses examined by the Special Committee rejected these theories.  The Special Committee confirmed that the Clintons put money into Whitewater, but never took any money out of the investment.  Moreover, the proceeds of the Whitewater land acquisition loans were invested in the business, through the land purchase, and the Clintons did not use any portion of the proceeds of those loans for their personal benefit.  Both logic and legal analysis support the conclusion that the Whitewater investment did not result in any taxable income to the Clintons.
<P>In short, the Special Committee found no evidence that the Clintons entered into the Whitewater investment as a tax shelter or ever sought to use the investment as a means to avoid paying their personal income taxes, even when they legally might have done so.
<P>B.<P>ARKANSAS REGULATORS' OVERSIGHT OF THE MCDOUGALS

<P>The McDougals operated several business enterprises in Arkansas during the 1980s, including Madison Guaranty, Madison Bank & Trust Company, and various real estate developments.  The activities of these businesses were subject to regulation by various Arkansas government agencies.
The Majority has asserted that the McDougals and their business enterprises obtained favored treatment from state regulators due to the McDougals' relationship with Governor Clinton.  In particular, it has been alleged that Governor Clinton influenced government actions to benefit the McDougals.  It also has been suggested that the McDougals provided financial benefits to the Clintons in return for the allegedly favorable treatment.<P>The record developed by the Special Committee, however, is at odds with these allegations.
<P>The evidence collected by the Special Committee demonstrated that the McDougals did not receive favored treatment from state agencies and that Arkansas state officials treated the McDougals and their business enterprises properly and appropriately.  The evidence further demonstrated that Governor Clinton did not intervene with state officials or take any improper action in the McDougals' behalf.  Finally, the record simply does not support the allegation that the McDougals provided improper financial benefits to the Clintons.
<P><P>a.<P>The Arkansas State Agency Leases of Offices from Madison Guaranty Were Proper, Appropriate and in the Normal Course of Business
<P>The Special Committee investigated whether certain leases were awarded to Madison Guaranty because of Governor Clinton's relationship with James McDougal.  In particular, the Committee reviewed whether the leases were related to a fundraiser that McDougal held for Governor Clinton at Madison Guaranty on April 5, 1985.  The evidence collected by the Committee establishes that the leases were entirely proper and appropriate, and were entered into in the normal course of business.  There is no evidence that Governor Clinton or anyone acting on his behalf caused or directed the leases to be signed, or that Madison Guaranty received any special consideration.  Moreover, the State first leased space at Madison Guaranty at least a year before the fundraiser took place.  Thus, there is no basis to connect the fundraiser with the leases, and no reason to believe that the leases entailed a quid pro quo of any kind.

<P><P>b.<P>McDougal received no special treatment from the Arkansas Alcoholic Beverage Commission

<P>The Committee reviewed whether Governor Clinton took any action to influence the Arkansas Alcoholic Beverage Control Division ("ABC") to provide favored treatment to James McDougal.  The Special Committee investigated whether Governor Clinton interceded with the ABC in support of McDougal's efforts to develop a microbrewery and brew pub on the IDC property.  The Committee also investigated whether Governor Clinton caused the ABC to promulgate a regulation permitting breweries to operate "tasting rooms."  The evidence, however, demonstrated that Governor Clinton never contacted the ABC with respect to the IDC brewery proposal.  The evidence further demonstrated that Governor Clinton played no part in the approval of the tasting room regulation.
<P><P>c.<P>The Sewer Legislation
<P>In 1987 Governor Clinton signed legislation to deregulate small sewer and water utilities.  The Majority has alleged that the legislation was designed to provide special treatment to the Castle Sewer and Water Company and to protect the Rose Law Firm from exposure to civil liability.  The Committee found that the Arkansas Public Service Commission and the entire Arkansas legislature supported the legislation.  Furthermore, passage of the legislation was fully justified on the merits.
<P><P>d.<P>McDougal's Maple Creek Farms Development and the Reassignment of the Arkansas Health Department Sanitarians

<P>The Special Committee reviewed whether Governor Clinton interfered with the regulation of the Maple Creek Farms project by Arkansas Health Department officials.  In March 1986 Governor Clinton arranged a meeting at which McDougal could communicate to Health Department officials the concerns he had about unfair treatment at the Maple Creek project.
Beyond arranging the meeting, which was appropriate, Governor Clinton did not take any action on McDougal's behalf, either at the meeting or thereafter.  To the contrary, Governor Clinton reprimanded McDougal (who behaved badly at the meeting) for his behavior, defended the Health Department's professional staff, and told McDougal to work with the Health Department to resolve the problems.  Most important, immediately after the meeting Governor Clinton made a special effort to let the Health Department know that McDougal was not to receive any special treatment and that Clinton would support whatever action the Health Department decided to take.
<P><P>e.<P>Regulation of Madison Bank and Trust by the Arkansas State Banking Department

<P>The Special Committee reviewed the regulation of a small Madison Bank & Trust Company, that James McDougal operated after he left a position on Governor Clinton's staff in 1980.  In October 1980 McDougal and a group of investors purchased a controlling interest in the Bank of Kingston, a small bank in Kingston, Arkansas.  McDougal then changed the bank's name to Madison Bank & Trust Company.  As a state chartered institution, Madison Bank was regulated by both the Arkansas State Banking Department and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.  In 1983 Marlin Jackson was the State Bank Commissioner.
<P>In 1983 Jackson informed Governor Clinton of regulatory problems at Madison Bank.  Jackson testified that he told the Governor about Madison Bank's problems as "a litmus test" to see if Governor Clinton would seek to influence Jackson and obtain favorable treatment for a political supporter.  (Jackson was aware that McDougal had been a member of Governor Clinton's staff during Clinton's first term in office, 1979-80.)  Governor Clinton passed Jackson's litmus test.  Jackson testified that Governor Clinton responded:
<P>You do whatever you need to do to be a good . . . no, to be a great Bank Commissioner and don't worry about the political consequences.  It doesn't matter who is involved.  I'll take the political heat.  You just do whatever you need to be a great Bank Commissioner.

<P>The evidence collected by the Special Committee confirms that Governor Clinton never interfered with Jackson or the State Banking Commission in their regulation of Madison Bank.  After his discussion with Governor Clinton, Jackson and the State Banking Commission joined with the Federal Deposit Inusurance Corporation in a cease-and-desist order against Madison Bank that curtailed the bank's ability to make out-of-territory loans and, among other things, required the bank to increase its operating capital.  Governor Clinton never attempted to intercede on James McDougal's behalf.  In fact, other than the one conversation described above -- which was initiated by Jackson -- Governor Clinton never discussed Madison Bank or James McDougal with Jackson.
C.  LASATER & COMPANY
<P>The Special Committee reviewed State bond underwriting contracts awarded to Lasater & Company.  The Committee's inquiry focused on allegations that Lasater & Company's selection as bond underwriter for State agencies resulted from improper political pressure.  The extensive evidentiary record developed by the Committee does not support the charge that Governor Clinton improperly steered state bond business to Lasater & Company.  The record shows that in 1983 Governor Clinton put in place a new policy of spreading state bond business among qualified firms (his Republican predecessor had given all the business to two local firms) and that Lasater & Company was only one of the firms that benefitted from this new policy.
<P>Witnesses from the State agencies that awarded underwriting business to Lasater & Company, from Governor Clinton's office, and from the Lasater firm uniformly testified that no political pressure was applied to include Lasater & Company in State bond underwritings.
Instead, under the new policy, all Arkansas underwriting firms participated in State business regardless of their political identification.  All local underwriting firms participated equally, sharing the portion of the bond issues that was not allocated to one of several large national underwriters.  The Lasater firm received only a small share of State bond underwriting business, and received a share similar to that of other local firms.  The participation of the Lasater firm was supported by both Democratic and Republican State officials.  Thus, the allegation that Lasater & Co.'s participation in State bond issues was due to political favoritism is not supported.
<P>1.<P>Clinton Administration Expands Number of Underwriters Participating in State Bond Business

<P>Under Governor Clinton, the number of firms doing underwriting business with the State of Arkansas expanded.  From 1980-82, under Republican Governor Frank White, Arkansas State bond underwriting business had been the preserve of a small number of firms.  During that time, State agencies used underwriters E.F. Hutton, Stephens, Inc. and T.J. Raney almost exclusively.  After 1983, the Clinton Administration promoted participation in State bond underwriting by all qualified Arkansas firms, regardless of which political candidates they supported.  Betsey Wright, former Chief of Staff to Governor Clinton, added that Governor Clinton's goal was to make the State bond underwriting business "as open and available to all companies in the State as possible."
<P>2.<P>Lasater & Company's Participation in Bond Underwriting for AHDA/ADFA

<P>These policies were adopted by the Arkansas Housing Development Agency, a State agency that issued bonds to provide home mortgages to Arkansas residents.  In keeping with the views of Governor Clinton and the AHDA Board Members, the agency used a greater number of underwriters after 1983.  Pursuant to these policies, Lasater & Company began underwriting AHDA single family bonds in 1983.  That year the Lasater firm received a 13.33% share of the bond issue -- smaller than one local firm and equal to the share of two other local firms.  Two of the three AHDA Subcommittee Members who voted to include Lasater & Company were appointed by Governor Frank White; the third was appointed by Governor Bill Clinton.  Lasater & Company received an even smaller share of AHDA's next bond offering.  All local firms, including the Lasater firm, received the same share of the bond issue -- 10%.
<P>The Lasater firm was treated the same as other local firms.  The Lasater firm always was part of a team of underwriters, including other local firms, that underwrote bond issues for AHDA and its successor agency, ADFA.  The Lasater firm never served as the sole underwriter of an AHDA/ADFA bond issue.  Other local firms underwrote as many state bonds as did the Lasater firm.
<P>It has been alleged that Governor Clinton directed AHDA and ADFA to award bond underwriting business to Lasater & Company.  The evidence, however, did not demonstrate that Governor Clinton pressured anyone to include the Lasater firm in bond underwritings.  Members of the Governor's staff have said it did not happen, members of the AHDA Board have said it did not happen, members of the AHDA staff have said it did not happen, and employees of both Lasater & Company and a competitor have said it did not happen.
<P>One witness recalled that a member of the staff of the Governor's Office suggested that the Lasater firm be included as an AHDA underwriter.  Charles Stout, an appointee of Republican Governor Frank White who was serving out his term as Chairman of the AHDA Board in 1983, recalled receiving a telephone call from Bob Nash, an assistant to Governor Clinton for economic development matters.  According to Stout, Nash "called [him] and recommended that we [AHDA] start using the Lasater firm."
<P>No other witness recalled this incident.  Nash testified that while he may have spoken with Stout regarding bond underwriting contracts, he never instructed Stout to include the Lasater firm in AHDA bond issues.  Even if this telephone conversation occurred -- which is hardly clear -- it is likely that other witnesses do not recall it because it was innocuous in nature.  Stout himself characterized the conversation as a suggestion from Nash, rather than a directive.
<P>3.<P>Lasater & Company's Bond Underwriting for the Arkansas State Police
<P>The Committee also examined a 1985 bond issue for the Arkansas State Police shared by T.J. Raney & Sons, E.F. Hutton & Company and Lasater & Company.  It has been alleged that Governor Clinton influenced the underwriter selection process to benefit Lasater.  The evidence, however, does not establish that Governor Clinton or his staff pressured the Arkansas State Police to include the Lasater firm in the bond underwriting or to award the contract to the group including the Lasater firm.
<P>On April 4, 1985, Governor Clinton signed legislation authorizing the State Police Commission to acquire a new communications system, financed by bonds. That same day, the State Police Commission began a competitive process to select the bond underwriters.  The State Police solicited proposals from all interested financial firms.
<P>Police Commissioner Johnny Mitchum, an appointee of Republican Governor Frank White, was a certified public accountant and the only member of the Police Commission with a background in finance.  Mitchum reviewed the underwriting proposals and concluded that a proposal submitted jointly by investment firms T.J. Raney, E.F. Hutton & Company, and Lasater & Company was the most attractive for the State.  An actuary hired by Mitchum concurred at the time that the Raney/Hutton/Lasater bid was the best for the State of Arkansas.  After the Police Commission heard oral presentations from the four finalists, the Raney/Hutton/Lasater team was awarded the contract by a vote of 4 to 2.
<P>The record does not establish that the Raney/Hutton/Lasater group won the bond underwriting for the Arkansas State Police as a result of special treatment, rather than submitting the best proposal.  Members of the Governor's staff testified that no influence was exerted.  Lasater and his employees testified that no influence was exerted on his behalf. Finally, the State Police witnesses themselves testified that they acted unilaterally and without influence from the Governor's office.
<P>The breakdown of the vote by the State Police Commission to award the contract to the Raney/Hutton/Lasater team demonstrates that it was not a politically motivated decision.  Both Republican appointees to the Police Commission voted in favor of awarding the contract to the Lasater team; the two members who voted against the Raney/Hutton/Lasater team were both Clinton appointees.
<P>The Majority argues that it was improper for the State Police Commission to award this contract to a group including Lasater & Company because of rumors at the time that Lasater used cocaine.  In fact, it is clear that the Clinton Administration was concerned about awarding State bond business to anyone under investigation for drug offenses.  The Governor and members of his staff raised the issue with law enforcement authorities, who reported that no investigations of Lasater were underway at that time.
D.  THE ROSE LAW FIRM'S REPRESENTATION OF MADISON GUARANTY
<P>1.<P>Background
<P>In April 1985 Madison Guaranty retained the Rose Law Firm to provide legal advice on a securities law matter, a proposed sale of preferred stock.  The following year, on July 14, 1986, the firm ceased its representation of Madison Guaranty so the firm could qualify to represent federal regulatory agencies in litigation involving failed savings and loan associations.  The Rose Law Firm was paid approximately $21,000 for its work in 1985 and 1986 on behalf of Madison Guaranty.
<P>The Committee devoted considerable attention to the circumstances of the Rose Law Firm's retention by Madison Guaranty.  In particular, the Committee examined allegations that James McDougal directed a portion of Madison Guaranty's legal business to Mrs. Clinton for improper reasons.  The evidence, however, demonstrated that nothing improper occurred in connection with Madison Guaranty's retention of the Rose Law Firm.
<P>The Committee also examined the substance of the work the Rose Law Firm and Mrs. Clinton performed for Madison Guaranty.  The evidence demonstrated that the Rose Law Firm's work for Madison Guaranty was legitimate, well-documented, and appropriately billed.  There is no credible evidence that any of the legal services provided by Mrs. Clinton and the Rose Law Firm were improper or contributed to the failure of the institution.
<P>Finally, the Committee reviewed Mrs. Clinton's prior statements concerning the Rose Law Firm's retention by and work for Madison Guaranty.  In this regard, the Committee carefully examined the documentary evidence, including the Rose Law Firm's billing records for the Madison Guaranty engagement, and took testimony from Rose Law Firm lawyers who participated in the representation.  The Committee also examined the documents prepared by the Rose Law Firm for Madison Guaranty.  This evidence demonstrated that Mrs. Clinton has accurately characterized her representation of Madison Guaranty as limited and insubstantial.
<P>2.<P>The Retention of the Rose Law Firm by Madison Guaranty

<P>On February 25, 1996, Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro, the law firm retained by the Resolution Trust Corporation to investigate possible civil claims relating to Madison
Guaranty, concluded that a "finder of fact is highly unlikely to find that there was anything untoward, let alone fraudulent or intentionally wrongful, in the circumstances of the Rose Law Firm's retention by Madison Guaranty."  The Special Committee's investigation has confirmed that conclusion.
<P>The Special Committee devoted a great deal of attention to investigating how the Rose Law Firm came to be retained by Madison Guaranty and the role Mrs. Clinton played in the retention.  Although it is impossible now, over eleven years later, to reconstruct exactly how the Rose Law Firm was retained, it appears that Rick Massey or Vincent Foster may have spoken with Mrs. Clinton about the possible retention of the firm and a prior billing problem with James McDougal.  Mrs. Clinton then spoke with McDougal.  She recalls that she told McDougal the Rose Law Firm would do the work if Madison Guaranty would enter into a retainer agreement which would ensure that the Rose Law Firm was paid for its work.  Mrs. Clinton remembers that McDougal agreed to a $2,000 monthly retainer payment.
<P>Mrs. Clinton did nothing improper in connection with the retainer agreement, and there is no evidence that there was any illicit motive underlying the retention.  Madison Guaranty needed legal counsel after legal issues arose out of McDougal's plan to sell preferred stock.  The Rose Law Firm, because of the firm's expertise in securities law, was a logical choice to provide that counsel.  The Special Committee found no evidence that Madison Guaranty's retention of the Rose Law Firm was a scheme for McDougal to confer a financial benefit on the Clintons.
<P>3.<P>Regulation of Madison Guaranty by the Arkansas Securities Department
<P> As discussed above, the Special Committee's investigation confirmed that Mrs. Clinton's role in the representation of Madison Guaranty in the preferred stock matter was very limited.  A related issue is whether, notwithstanding the limited nature of her work on the securities matters, Mrs. Clinton sought to use her position as the Governor's wife to seek special treatment for Madison Guaranty.  The Special Committee's investigation has established that there was no effort to obtain preferential treatment, and that, in fact, no preferential treatment was given.  To the contrary, the Arkansas Securities Department under the direction of Beverly Bassett Schaffer performed its duties in an entirely appropriate manner and took no action that either improperly benefitted Madison Guaranty or that was in any way inconsistent with the public interest.
<P>Mrs. Clinton had one brief telephone discussion with Schaffer at the outset of the representation.  Schaffer testified that she did not attach any particular significance to her one telephone conversation with Mrs. Clinton.  Nor did anyone in the Governor's office put any political pressure on Schaffer or her staff to give Madison Guaranty special treatment.  The record demonstrates that Schaffer behaved exactly as an appointed regulatory official should in relying upon the expertise of her professional staff to identify applicable regulatory requirements and then insisting that all such requirements be met before her department approved Madison Guaranty's proposals.  Because those requirements were never satisfied, the proposals were never approved.
<P>The Special Committee found that ultimately it was Schaffer who recommended in 1987that Madison Guaranty be closed by the federal regulators.  The federal regulators did not close Madison Guaranty until 1989.  This delay was the result of the failure of the federal authorities to act on Schaffer's December 1987 recommendation and was in no way caused by Schaffer or other Arkansas officials.  Although the Special Committee did not investigate the effect this delay had on the losses associated with Madison Guaranty, it is likely that those losses would have been reduced if the federal authorities had heeded Schaffer's recommendation and closed the institution in 1987.
<P>4.<P>The IDC Real Estate Transactions
<P>In the late summer and fall of 1985, the Rose Law Firm provided some legal services to Madison Guaranty in connection with the purchase of a large tract of land south of Little Rock from the Industrial Development Corporation  or "IDC."  The work done by the Rose Law Firm, and especially Mrs. Clinton, on IDC matters was the subject of considerable attention by the Special Committee.  The focus of that attention has been on whether Mrs. Clinton or other Rose Law Firm lawyers had any involvement in aspects of the IDC transaction that may have been unlawful.  In particular, the Committee reviewed the initial purchase of a portion of the IDC property by Seth Ward, a transactions that has been characterized as a sham, "straw man" purchase (although Ward vehemently denies that charge), and the subsequent resales of parcels of that property to Madison Guaranty insiders.  The Special Committee's investigation confirmed the conclusion of Pillsbury Madison & Sutro that the evidence does not support the assertion that the Rose Law Firm or Mrs. Clinton was aware of any unlawful conduct involving the IDC property.
<P>Although the Rose Law Firm did not do any legal work on the aspects of the IDC transaction that raised bank regulatory issues, the firm did provide legal services to Madison Guaranty on other matters relating to the development of the IDC property, and the Rose Law Firm provided that service.  The bulk of that work, which was supervised by Mrs. Clinton, involved analysis of issues relating to utility regulations and laws regulating the sale of alcoholic beverages.  The evidence collected by the Special Committee indicates that Madison Guaranty needed legal counsel on these two relatively routine legal issues that related to the development of the IDC property.  Mrs. Clinton, recalls that she "conducted research and explored possible issues pertaining to [the brewery and utility matters], both on my own and in partnership with Mr. Donovan [the Rose Law Firm associate who assisted her]."  The Rose Law Firm billing records confirm Mrs. Clinton's recollection of her involvement in these matters.
<P>Another matter relating to the IDC transaction that was reviewed by the Special Committee involved Mrs. Clinton's prior public statements that she did not work on the "Castle Grande" matter for Madison Guaranty.  The Committee's review demonstrated that confusion has arisen as to whether the entire property purchased from IDC was known as "Castle Grande" at the time Mrs. Clinton performed the legal work described above.  The documents and testimony provided to the Special Committee clearly indicate that within the Rose Law Firm, the work was known as the IDC matter.  Although with the passage of time the entire property has sometimes been referred to as Castle Grande, the evidence collected by the Special Committee established that during the relevant time period -- in 1985 and 1986 when the Rose Law Firm was providing legal services to Madison Guaranty -- only the portion of the IDC property south of 145th Street was called Castle Grande.  That was the name James McDougal gave to the residential development he started on that portion of the IDC property.  John Latham testified that the residential area which was named Castle Grande was "really a small part of" the IDC property.  The projects Mrs. Clinton worked on were related to the other, commercial, portions of the IDC tract, and did not involve the Castle Grande residential development.  Thus Mrs. Clinton's prior statement that she did not work on Castle Grande is consistent with the evidence obtained by the Special Committee.
E.  DAVID HALE
<P> David Hale is the only witness who has claimed that Governor Clinton participated in discussions of financial transactions concerning Madison Guaranty and Capital Management Services, Inc.  Hale, a twice convicted felon and an admitted liar and perjurer, has claimed that on three occasions in late 1985 and early 1986 Governor Clinton spoke with him about an illegal $300,000 loan Hale was considering making to Susan McDougal.  President Clinton has denied ever speaking with Hale about a loan to Susan McDougal.  No document or witness brought before the Special Committee has corroborated Hale's assertion in any way.
<P>The jurors in the Tucker/McDougal trial, at which Hale and President Clinton both testified, made clear after the trial that they rejected Hale's unsubstantiated claim about Governor Clinton.  One juror, Colin Capp, stated that the jurors considered Hale "an unmitigated liar ... [who] perjured himself. ... David Hale invoked the President's name for one reason: to save his butt.  We all thought that way."  Another juror, Earnest Williams, agreed, adding, "I didn't believe a thing Hale said."
<P>In stark contrast, the jurors stated after the trial that they believed President Clinton when he denied having spoken with Hale about the loan to Susan McDougal.  Sandra Wood, the jury foreperson, told the press, "The President's credibility was never an issue.  I just felt like he was telling us to the best of his knowledge what he knew."  Juror Tracy Pleasants added, "I just felt as though he [President Clinton] was telling the truth, and I wasn't so sure about David Hale."
<P>Even Ray Jahn, the lead prosecutor who presented Hale's plea-bargained testimony at the trial on behalf of the Office of the Independent Counsel, backed away from Hale's unsupported assertion about Governor Clinton.  In his closing argument, Jahn told the jury that no one, including Hale, had alleged wrongdoing by Governor Clinton.  The lead prosecutor told the jury what anyone who had taken the trouble to review the actual testimony (rather than the hype) already knew -- that there was no evidence presented at the trial, including Hale's testimony, that anyone pressured Hale to make the loan to Susan McDougal or her company, Master Marketing.
<P>The Special Committee has in its record an abundance of evidence, including 1,600 pages of official transcripts reporting nine days of Hale's testimony at the Tucker/McDougal trial, that sheds considerable light on Hale's veracity.  Consistent with the view expressed by the jurors in the Tucker/McDougal trial, the evidence in the Committee's record compels the conclusion that Hale's unsupported allegation regarding Governor Clinton is false.




<P>SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS: FOSTER PAPER MATTERS
<P>The Special Committee conducted an exhaustive investigation into the handling of documents in the office of Vincent Foster following his death.  The investigation focused on the brief entry of Foster's office by three senior White House officials on the night of Foster's death for the purpose of looking for a suicide note, on the review of the contents of Foster's office conducted two days later by White House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum in the presence of law enforcement officials, and on the subsequent disposition of those contents, including personal and financial papers belonging to President and Mrs. Clinton.
<P>Although some voiced the opinion that the White House exercised questionable political judgment, particularly with regard to method used during the July 22, 1993 search of Foster's office in the presence of law enforcement officials, the evidence did not establish any unethical or unlawful conduct by any White House official.
<P>A.<P>The Night of July 20, 1993
<P>The evidence showed that Nussbaum, Margaret Williams and Patsy Thomasson entered Foster's office on the night of Foster's death to look for a suicide note and to grieve for their friend and colleague.  All three testified that they were in Foster's office only briefly, that they reviewed no documents, and that they removed nothing.
<P>Officer Henry O'Neill testified that he observed Williams remove materials from Foster's office on the night of July 20, 1993.  O'Neill's testimony, however, was confused and inconsistent as to what it was he remembered Williams carrying.  Williams, by contrast, was quite clear in her testimony that she did not remove anything from Foster's office that night.  Williams' testimony was corroborated by the results of two polygraph examinations, including one conducted by the Office of the Independent Counsel.
<P>B.<P>The Review of the Contents of Foster's Office
<P>The unanimous opinion of the law enforcement witnesses who appeared before the Committee was that neither the Park Police nor the Justice Department had the authority to enter or review documents in Foster's office.  Deputy Attorney General Philip Heymann testified that the Justice Department could not have obtained a search warrant or a subpoena for items in Foster's office because no crime had been committed.  Consistent with their limited authority, the Park Police never expressed a desire to review all of the documents in Foster's office.  To the contrary, their focus was much narrower -- the Park Police sought to examine Foster's office only for a suicide note or other personal documents capable of shedding light on Foster's state of mind.
<P>The Committee heard divergent testimony about whether Nussbaum and Heymann reached an agreement on July 21, 1993 concerning the procedures for the review of the documents in Foster's office.  Department of Justice officials testified that Nussbaum agreed on July 21 that they, too, would be permitted to review Foster's documents.  Nussbaum and other White House lawyers testified that there was no such agreement.
<P>The Majority has concluded that Nussbaum reneged on an agreement with Heymann under instructions from Mrs. Clinton passed through Williams and Susan Thomases.  The Majority bases its conclusion on telephone records indicating that certain telephone calls were made on the morning of July 22.
<P>The Majority's conclusion is inconsistent with the testimony the Committee received.  Nussbaum, Williams and Thomases all testified that they did not speak with Mrs. Clinton about the review of Foster's office, and Nussbaum and Thomases testified that Thomases did not act as an intermediary between Mrs. Clinton and Nussbaum.
<P>Most important, the Department of Justice attorneys told the Committee that although they thought Nussbaum's decision not to allow them to review the materials in Foster's office was a mistake politically -- because Nussbaum's decision could create an appearance of a lack of impartiality -- they made clear that Nussbaum's actions constituted no violation of any law or ethics rule.  Indeed, Heymann testified that Nussbaum went "beyond what could be legally required of the White House Counsel" by permitting law enforcement officials to be present during the search.
<P>Nussbaum went through the documents in Foster's office in the presence of investigators from the Park Police and career attorneys from the Justice Department.  Nussbaum described the documents as he went through them, and he put to one side all of the documents the law enforcement officials expressed an interest in seeing.  The White House promptly made all of these documents available to law enforcement for copying and review.  No Park Police or Justice Department official ever asked permission to review any of the Clintons' personal financial files in Foster's office.  As one of the senior Justice Department officials present during the search testified, "things like tax returns and personal financial information of the Clintons ... didn't have much to do with a suicide investigation."
<P>C.<P> The Disposition of the Clintons' Personal Files in Foster's Office
<P>Following the review of documents in Foster's office on July 22, 1993, Nussbaum decided to give the Clintons' personal files to their personal attorneys, Williams & Connolly.  Neither the Justice Department attorneys nor the Park Police investigators present during the document review objected to Nussbaum's stated intention to send the Clintons' personal files to their private attorneys.
<P>Nussbaum asked Williams to deliver certain personal documents of the Clintons' from Foster's office to the Clintons' personal attorneys.  Williams testified that later that afternoon, having attended to other matters in the meantime, she decided not to deliver the files to the Clintons' lawyer that day.  Rather than leave the files in Foster's office or in her own office, Williams decided to put them in the White House residence.
<P>Bob Barnett, the Clintons' personal lawyer at Williams & Connolly, retrieved the personal files on July 27, 1993.  Barnett does not recall seeing or speaking with Mrs. Clinton that day.  He was certain that Mrs. Clinton was not present while he reviewed the contents of the box.
<P>There is no evidence that any of the personal files were removed or tampered with before they were transferred to Williams & Connolly.  Nor is there any credible evidence that any document that was in Foster's office at the time of Foster's death has been withheld from the Committee.
<P>D.<P>The Discovery of Foster's Torn-Up Note
<P>White House officials discovered a torn-up note in Foster's briefcase on July 26, 1993.  The White House provided the note to law enforcement officials as soon as they were able to notify Mrs. Foster and the President.  Law enforcement officials testified that their investigations were not affected by the timing of the discovery and production of the note.


<P>ROSE LAW FIRM BILLING RECORDS
<P>In January 1996, Carolyn Huber had some furniture removed from her White House East Wing office.  She used the occasion to review the contents of a box of photographs and other materials to be catalogued that had been under a table, and discovered the Rose Law Firm billing records.  Ms. Huber believed that these records had been requested by investigating authorities, and she immediately called David Kendall, the personal attorney for President and Mrs. Clinton.  Later that afternoon, Kendall, Huber, Special Counsel to the President Jane Sherburne and Huber's personal attorney reviewed the documents together.  At the end of this review, the lawyers concluded that the billing records were called for by various requests for documents from government agencies.  They copied the documents that night and produced to them the next day to the Independent Counsel, the Special Committee, the House Banking Committee, and the FDIC.
<P>The documents found by Huber are copies of Rose Law Firm billing records for the firm's representation of Madison Guaranty in the mid-1980's.  While these records provide more detail than was previously available, they do not contradict what Mrs. Clinton and Rose Law Firm lawyers have said about the representation of Madison Guaranty.  The Rose Law Firm was not Madison Guaranty's regular outside counsel, and it handled only certain discrete assignments for the institution.  Within the firm, Mrs. Clinton's work for Madison Guaranty was limited in time and scope.  Work performed for Madison Guaranty comprised only a small fraction of the firm's total billings and of Mrs. Clinton's total billings.
<P>The Special Committee sought to establish the chain of custody of the Rose Law Firm billing records prior to their discovery by Huber in January 1996.  It is not possible on the existing record to ascertain when and by what means the billing records were brought into the White House, or in whose custody they remained once they were there.  Huber testified that she first encountered the billing records during the first or second week of August 1995.  She first saw them in the "Book Room," a room on the third floor of the White House residence used at that time to store gifts, photographs, newspaper and magazine articles, and other items to be catalogued.  Huber testified that the documents had not been on the table in the Book Room when she last had occasion to be in that room, a week or two before.  Huber retrieved four or five boxes of materials to be catalogued from the Book Room that day.  She testified that the documents remained undisturbed in a box on the floor of her office from August 1995 to January 4, 1996, when the table was removed from her the office and she examined the contents of the box.
<P>It appears that the billing records were in Foster's possession Foster in February 1992.  Webster Hubbell testified that during the Presidential campaign early in 1992, an issue arose regarding contacts Mrs. Clinton may have had with the Arkansas Securities Department on behalf of Madison Guaranty.  Either Hubbell or Foster requested that the billing records be printed by the Rose Law Firm accounting department.
<P>The testimony and the FBI fingerprint analysis of the records leave open the possibility that Foster brought the billing records to the White House.  If so, they may have passed out of his possession before his death.
<P>Contrary to the Majority's insinuations, Kendall issued a statement on January 5, 1996 making clear that Mrs. Clinton did not put the billing records in the Book Room: "the First Lady was not aware until today that these records were located in the White House."  On January 26, 1996, Mrs. Clinton herself told the press, "I do not know how the billing records came to be found where they were found, but I am pleased that they were found, because they confirm what I have been saying."

<H3>II.  WASHINGTON PHASE<BR>

  A.  JEAN LEWIS'S 1992 RTC CRIMINAL REFERRAL</H3>

<P> 1.  Introduction
<P>The evidence showed that the Resolution Trust Corporation's 1992 criminal referral regarding the Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan Association was prepared by a politically motivated investigator who pressed the investigation hoping to affect the outcome of the 1992 Presidential election.  The referral, which the RTC investigator submitted to the Department of Justice just two months before Election Day, failed to allege any evidence of a crime and named the Clintons as witnesses despite the absence of any reasonable basis to believe that they knew about the matters alleged in the referral.  
<P>The allegations contained in the 1992 referral have been repeatedly rejected by federal prosecutors and other investigators.  Career officials of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, and the United States Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Arkansas all properly rejected the 1992 referral as a basis for prosecution.  The Office of the Independent Counsel, which subsequently took over responsibility for the investigation of the 1992 referral, has brought no criminal charges arising from the referral's allegations.  And the law firm of Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro, which the RTC hired to investigate civil claims arising from the failure of Madison Guaranty, found no evidence to support the allegations contained in the 1992 referral and concluded that those allegations were insufficient to support even a civil cause of action based on fraud.

<P> 2.  RTC Criminal Investigator L. Jean Lewis Set Aside Higher Priority
<P><P> Investigations to Focus on Madison Guaranty Following the Publication of Jeff Gerth's March 8, 1992 Article in The New York Times

<P>On December 11, 1991, RTC criminal investigator L. Jean Lewis sent a memorandum to her supervisor setting forth the RTC's 1992 schedule for conducting criminal investigations of failed savings and loan institutions in Arkansas.1  Lewis, who had been delegated responsibility for the RTC's criminal investigations of all failed S&Ls in Arkansas,2 set the 1992 schedule in consultation with senior officials in the Little Rock field office of the FBI.3  Lewis and senior FBI officials agreed that investigations of institutions most likely to lead to meritorious criminal prosecutions should be conducted first and should be made the top priorities for the RTC's limited investigative resources.4
<P>Consistent with this approach, Lewis listed Savers Savings Association ("Savers Savings") of Little Rock and First Federal of Little Rock ("First Federal") first and third, respectively, on her December 11, 1991 priority list of failed Arkansas institutions to be investigated in 1992.5  Lewis and senior FBI officials viewed these two institutions as highly likely to yield meritorious prosecutions; both institutions had failed in the recent past at enormous cost to taxpayers -- Savers Savings at a cost of $650 million, First Federal at a cost of $900 million -- and both had failed amid strong indications of criminal fraud.6  Neither institution had been the subject of a previous criminal investigation or prosecution.7  In light of these factors, Lewis scheduled the RTC's criminal investigations of Savers Savings and First Federal for the first quarter of 1992.8
<P>In the same December 11, 1991 memorandum, Lewis placed Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan Association near the bottom of her priority list -- tenth out of the twelve failed Arkansas institutions to be investigated in 1992.9  Madison Guaranty had failed several years earlier at a far lower cost to the taxpayers -- approximately $60 million -- than Savers Savings, First Federal and the other top priority institutions.  Moreover, Madison Guaranty had been the subject of an extensive federal criminal investigation in 1989-90 that had resulted in the 1990 trial and acquittal of James McDougal, the investigation's principal target.10  As of December 1991, the RTC and the FBI had no information indicating that any criminal activity had occurred at Madison Guaranty other than that already alleged and rejected by the jury in the 1990 McDougal trial.11  In light of these factors, Lewis and the FBI agreed that further investigation of Madison Guaranty should be made a low priority,12 and Lewis scheduled the RTC's investigation of Madison for the final quarter of 1992.13
<P>Lewis followed the agreed-upon schedule for several months.  She shifted her priorities, however, following the March 8, 1992 publication of Jeff Gerth's article on the Clintons' Whitewater investment in The New York Times.
<P>The Tulsa field office of the RTC, where Lewis was assigned at the time, received inquiries about the Gerth article from two senior RTC officials shortly after the article's publication.14  Lewis' supervisor, Richard Iorio, testified that the scope of both inquiries was strictly limited to the simple question whether there was "any truth" to Gerth's allegations;15 neither inquiry sought a significant investigation of Madison Guaranty or suggested that Lewis should advance the investigation of Madison Guaranty from its place near the bottom of her agreed upon 1992 list.16  
<P>Nevertheless, Lewis -- who was neither a trained criminal investigator nor a career civil servant -- set aside the higher priority investigations she was conducting and traveled to Little Rock to look through Madison-related documents in a warehouse.17  In April 1992, Iorio granted Lewis' request that the RTC's criminal investigation of Madison Guaranty be advanced and placed ahead of the other failed Arkansas thrifts on Lewis' priority list.18
<P> 3.  Lewis Rushed to Complete a Criminal Referral Prior to a Self-Imposed
<P><P>Pre-Election Deadline

<P>Lewis worked intensively to prepare a criminal referral in the Madison Guaranty case by what she described as a "self-imposed deadline" of August 31, 1992.19  Lewis set this deadline -- a date approximately 60 days before the Presidential election -- even though there was no compelling law enforcement interest, such as an imminent statute of limitations deadline, in completing the referral so quickly.20  
<P>Lewis acknowledged that she understood in 1992 that her work on the Madison Guaranty referral could affect the outcome of the upcoming Presidential election if it became known that the Clintons were involved, even as mere witnesses, in a criminal investigation.21  But Lewis testified that her "own conservative [political] views" caused her to hold herself to an even higher standard of professionalism in her work on the Madison Guaranty case than the standard to which she held herself in other cases.22  Lewis denied any intention of creating an "October Surprise" through the submission of a pre-election criminal referral naming the Clintons.23
<P>The Committee's record belied Lewis' testimony.  Documentary and testimonial evidence established that Lewis did in fact intend her 1992 referral in the Madison Guaranty case to harm Bill Clinton's election chances.
<P>Lewis informed FBI Special Agent Steve Irons in August 1992 that she would soon be submitting a criminal referral in the Madison Guaranty case.24  Irons' contemporaneous notes of the conversation indicate that Lewis told him she had "g[iven] up a job opportunity in D.C." so that she could "alter history" by completing the Madison referral prior to the election.25  
<P>Initially, Lewis told the Committee that she had no memory of having made this comment to Irons.26  Then, after being confronted with Irons' contemporaneous notes, Lewis testified that if she did tell Irons that she planned to alter history through the pre-election submission of her referral, she probably did so sarcastically.27  
<P>Irons flatly contradicted Lewis' testimony on this point.  Fully supported by his contemporaneous notes of the conversation, Irons testified that Lewis' comments about her desire to "alter history" were "very dramatic" and that, in his mind, the comments clearly related to Lewis' identification of the Clintons as witnesses in the referral.28  As discussed below, Lewis' conduct in the period immediately following her September 1, 1992 submission of the criminal referral compels the conclusion that Lewis sought to use the referral as a vehicle to alter the course of history by affecting the outcome of the 1992 Presidential election.   
<P>The Committee's hearings established that Lewis was motivated by more than just her political interest in affecting the outcome of the 1992 Presidential election.  Specifically, the evidence showed that Lewis held a strong personal animus toward Bill Clinton -- an animus that was reflected in a letter Lewis wrote to a friend in February 1992, one month before Lewis dropped her work on higher priority institutions to focus on Madison Guaranty, in which Lewis referred to Clinton as a "lying bastard."29

<P> 4.  Lewis' 1992 Referral Failed to Allege Evidence of a Federal Crime and Gratuitously Named the Clintons as Witnesses

<P>With the approval of her supervisor in the field, Lewis transmitted a criminal referral to the United States Attorneys Office and the FBI in Little Rock on September 1, 1992.30  The referral alleged a check kiting scheme at Madison Guaranty and named the Clintons as possible witnesses.31
<P>Career prosecutors at the Department of Justice who reviewed Lewis' 1992 referral uniformly criticized both its completeness and its quality.  Mark MacDougal, a trial attorney in the Fraud Section who conducted a thorough written analysis of the merits of the referral, wrote that the referral "does not provide ... factual allegations sufficient to establish the elements of any of the criminal statutes used in the prosecution of [federal] bank fraud cases."32  Gerald McDowell, the chief of the Fraud Section and a former chief of the Public Integrity Section, testified that the referral was "junky," that it had "come in half-baked," and that "it could have used more investigation before it came in."33  Michael Johnson, an Assistant United States Attorney in Little Rock, called the referral's allegations "reckless," "irresponsible" and "odd."34  Special Counsel Fiske and Independent Counsel Starr have had responsibility for investigating the 1992 referral since January 1994.  Consistent with the opinions of the referral expressed by the career investigators and prosecutors, neither Fiske nor Starr has brought any criminal charges based on allegations contained in the referral.  Indeed, Charles Patterson, one of the senior lawyers at the law firm of Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro, which investigated possible civil claims arising from the failure of Madison Guaranty for the RTC, testified that the firm found no evidence of the type of "over-arching check kiting scheme" alleged in the 1992 referral; Patterson testified that Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro found no evidence to support a civil fraud claim based on the information contained in the 1992 referral, even though such a civil action would require a lower evidentiary showing than would any of the criminal charges contemplated in the referral.35
<P>Career prosecutors and investigators also have taken the view consistently that Lewis lacked an evidentiary basis on which to name the Clintons as witnesses to the alleged criminal conduct described in the referral.  Mark MacDougal wrote that "[n]o factual claims can be found in the referral to support the designation of Mr. and Mrs. Clinton as witnesses."36  FBI Special Agent Steve Irons testified that he "didn't think there was anything in [the referral] to support" the allegation that the Clintons were witnesses to the check-kiting scheme alleged.37  Donald Pettus, the Special Agent in Charge of the FBI's Little Rock field office, wrote in an October 7, 1992 teletype to FBI Headquarters that "there is indeed insufficient evidence to suggest the Clintons had knowledge of the check-kiting activity conducted by McDougal or Aunspaugh.  The earlier mention of a campaign contribution to the gubernatorial campaign also drew no nexus suggesting knowledge or involvement by the Clintons."38  
<P>On behalf of the RTC, the law firm of Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro later reached the same conclusion as the career prosecutors and investigators -- that Lewis lacked an evidentiary basis on which to describe the Clintons as witnesses.  The firm's report stated that "there is no basis to assert that the Clintons knew anything of substance about the McDougals' advances to Whitewater, the source of the funds used to make those advances or the source of funds used to make payments on bank debt."39  
<P>Even Lewis conceded at the Committee's public hearings that "there was no evidence that Mr. Clinton or Mrs. Clinton knew that Mr. McDougal was involved in this check kiting among his different companies."40 
<P>In sum, the Committee's record indicated that Lewis' 1992 referral failed to allege evidence of a federal crime and that its identification of the Clintons as witnesses was without basis. 
<P> 5.  Lewis Pressured the United States Attorneys Office and the FBI to Open a Formal Investigation Before the Presidential Election

<P>Lewis' supervisor, Richard Iorio, told the Committee that the RTC typically "hears something" back from the FBI or the United States Attorneys Office within approximately 90 days of the submission of a criminal referral.41  As a general rule, therefore, an RTC investigator has no reason to contact the FBI or the United States Attorneys Office to follow up on a criminal referral, or to inquire about its status, until approximately 90 days have passed since the referral's submission.42  Even then, Iorio testified, the only reason an RTC investigator would contact the FBI or the United States Attorneys Office would be to find out if either law enforcement agency was going to need the RTC investigator to assist in any continuing investigation; the RTC sometimes needs this information for its own scheduling purposes.43
<P>In the case of Lewis' 1992 referral in the Madison Guaranty case, Iorio and others at the RTC expected that it would take at least 90 days for the FBI or the United States Attorneys Office to contact the RTC about the referral.  Iorio and others at the RTC understood that the upcoming change in Administrations -- and the resulting automatic replacement of the United States Attorney in Little Rock -- likely would cause a delay in the work of these federal law enforcement agencies.44  Thus, there was no reason for Lewis or anyone else at the RTC to contact the FBI or the United States Attorneys Office for a status report on the Madison Guaranty referral until at least 90 days, and probably a longer period of time, had passed since the referral's submission.
<P>  Lewis testified that she did not contact the FBI or the United States Attorneys Office about the 1992 Madison referral until December 1992, one month after the Presidential election.45  Lewis told the Committee under oath that she "would have had no reason" to contact the FBI or the United States Attorneys Office in September, October and November 1992 to ask whether the referral would be pursued, whether subpoenas would be issued, or whether a grand jury investigation would be opened.46  
<P>As before, Lewis' sworn statements before the Committee were directly contradicted by the testimony and contemporaneous notes of FBI Special Agent Steve Irons.  Irons' testimony, along with that of several other career federal law enforcement officials, established that Lewis repeatedly contacted the FBI and the United States Attorneys Office between the referral's submission on September 1, 1992 and the Presidential election two months later.  The evidence showed that Lewis tried during this critical time period to determine the status of the referral and to encourage the opening of a formal FBI or grand jury investigation.
<P>Lewis' efforts to press the FBI began almost immediately following her submission of the referral on September 1, 1992.  In the course of the next "few days," Lewis tried on several occasions to contact Irons "to ask what the FBI was doing with [the] referral."47  Apparently frustrated by her inability to reach Irons, Lewis called again on September 9, 1992 and spoke with Irons' secretary, who left the following written message for Irons:
<P>Jean [Lewis] requested I take a verbatim message & make sure you got it.  It is as follows ... (and don't ask me what a pariah [sic] is!)

<P>Have I turned into a local pariah [sic], just because I wrote one referral with high profile names or do you plan on calling me back before Christmas, Steven?????  (816) 968-7237.48

<P>Irons returned Lewis' call on September 10, 1992.  In response to an inquiry from Lewis, Irons stated that the FBI and the United States Attorneys Office had not made a decision about the Madison Guaranty referral and that they were not going to be in a position to provide status reports in the future.49  
<P>Nevertheless, Lewis travelled to Little Rock on September 18, 1992 and, without calling ahead, dropped in on Irons at the FBI's Little Rock field office.50  Irons, who was away from his office, returned to find Lewis there waiting for him.51  Lewis apologized for her repeated contacts but explained that "her boss, Richard Iorio, kept asking her to try to find out what it was [the FBI was] doing."52  
<P>Richard Iorio's testimony directly contradicted Lewis on this point.  Iorio testified that he never asked Lewis to contact the FBI or anyone else in September or October 1992 to try to determine the status of the Madison referral.53
<P>Lewis soon began contacting the United States Attorneys Office in Little Rock about the Madison referral.  United States Attorney Charles Banks testified that he was aware of four or five calls that Lewis made to the office between early September and October 16, 1992.54  Assistant United States Attorney Mac Dodson testified that Lewis called him "fairly often" between September and November 1992 and that Lewis gave him the impression that she thought prosecutors were not acting on the referral fast enough: 
<P>All the calls would have been between the 1st of September and probably November, around election time.  It was my recollection she called me every week or every other week.  She called me fairly often. ... I got the impression she thought I was not moving fast enough.55  

Lewis explained to Dodson that it was "standard" RTC practice to make a follow-up contact six weeks after the submission of a referral to make sure the referral had been received and to find out if any clarification or assistance was needed.56  Like the explanation Lewis had given to Special Agent Irons for her repeated attempts to contact the FBI, Lewis' statement to Dodson was contradicted by the sworn testimony of Lewis' supervisor, Richard Iorio; as set forth in greater detail above, Iorio testified that the RTC's general practice was to wait 90 days before contacting the FBI or the United States Attorneys Office to follow up on a referral.57
<P>Lewis' contacts with the FBI and the United States Attorneys Office prior to the Presidential election caused several high-level officials in those agencies to be suspicious of Lewis' motives.  United States Attorney Charles Banks, for example, testified that the sense of urgency he noted in Lewis' contacts with his office made him "circumspect" about the referral:
<P>The series of calls that [Lewis] made over a period of two to three weeks struck me as being unusual.  There was -- I saw no need for the sense of urgency, saving except for who the witnesses were in the referral [the Clintons].  If it hadn't been for the witnesses, Senator, I don't think that there would have been anything like that in the sense of urgency by Ms. Lewis, so it caused me to be very circumspect about it.58

Donald Pettus, the Special Agent in Charge of the FBI's Little Rock field office, testified that the timing of Lewis' referral and Lewis' comment about altering the course of history caused him and others at the FBI to be concerned about Lewis' objectivity and overall professionalism.59<P>

<P> 6.  United States Attorney Charles Banks Resisted Lewis' Pressure and Declined to Commence a Grand Jury Investigation Before the 1992 Presidential Election

<P>The argument has been made in Lewis' defense that Lewis would have leaked the existence of the Madison Guaranty referral had she truly wanted to affect the outcome of the 1992 Presidential election.60  Lewis herself argued in her testimony before the Committee that "the existence of the criminal referral and the information it contained had no effect on the election because it was not revealed."61*
<P>In fact, the opening of a formal inquiry by the FBI or the commencement of a grand jury investigation by the United States Attorneys Office -- even in the absence of an actual leak from the RTC -- would have made information about the referral, including the identities of the Clintons and other witnesses named therein, available to numerous law enforcement sources.  That process very likely could have resulted in actual leaks about the referral and its famous witnesses occurring before the 1992 Presidential election.  As Charles Banks, the Republican-appointed United States Attorney in Little Rock, wrote in an October 16, 1992 letter to Pettus:
<P>You and I know in investigations of this type, the first steps, such as [the] issuance of grand jury subpoena[s] for records, will lead to media and public inquiries of matters that are subject to absolute privacy.  Even media questions about such an investigation in today's modern political climate all too often publicly purports to "legitimize what can't be proven."62

<P>The evidence established that it was Banks' steadfast refusal to capitulate to Lewis' pressure that kept the referral out of the public domain prior to the election.  Banks' October 16, 1992 letter to Pettus concluded: 
<P>While I do not intend to denigrate the work of [the] RTC, I must opine that after such a lapse of time the insistence for urgency in this case appears to suggest an intentional or unintentional attempt to intervene into the political process of the upcoming presidential election. ...

<P>For me personally to participate in an investigation that I know will or could easily lead to the above scenario and to the possible denial of rights due to the targets, subjects, witnesses or defendants is inappropriate.  I believe it amounts to prosecutorial misconduct and violates the most basic fundamental rule of Department of Justice policy.  I cannot be a party to such actions and believe that such would be detrimental to the Department of Justice, FBI, this office and to the President of the United States [George Bush].63

<P>Chairman D'Amato praised Banks for resisting Lewis' pressure:
<P>[I]n terms of the action that you took in September, or wherever, or in October, you did absolutely the right thing. ... You don't start a grand jury investigation as it relates to the then-Governor, presidential candidate, three weeks before [an election].  I mean, that's ridiculous.  And I think what you did was absolutely correct.64

<P>Senator Sarbanes was equally strong in his commendation of Banks:

<P>I simply want to say that I think [your October 16, 1992 letter to Pettus], and the positions you took, reflected a determined effort to sustain the integrity of the criminal justice system.  I think that ought to be recognized, and I think it's this kind of courage that makes the system work, and I commend you for it.65

<P>  7.  The Bush White House and Justice Department Showed an Interest in Lewis' Referral Before the 1992 Presidential Election

<P>The evidence showed that while Banks was declining to commence a grand jury investigation prior to the 1992 Presidential election, several high level Bush Administration officials at both the White House and the Department of Justice learned of the existence of the confidential criminal referral and made inquiries about it.  The Committee's record did not conclusively establish how information about the existence of a confidential criminal referral spread to these senior Bush Administration officials, who made their inquiries after Lewis submitted the referral but before any report of it appeared in the press.
<P><P>a.  The White House
<P>Albert Casey, the Chief Executive Officer of the RTC in 1992, testified that in late September or early October 1992 he received a telephone call from President Bush's White House Counsel, C. Boyden Gray.  Casey testified that Gray asked him if he knew anything about an RTC matter involving the Clintons.  Casey told Gray that he did not know of such a matter but that he would look into it and call Gray back.66
<P>Casey immediately called RTC Vice President William Roelle, who told Casey that there was an RTC criminal referral involving the Clintons.67  Casey's best recollection was that Roelle told him that the Clintons were not subjects of the referral but that they might be called as witnesses.68
<P>Roelle corroborated Casey's testimony.  He stated that Casey told him in September 1992 that Gray had contacted him about an RTC criminal referral involving the Clintons.  Roelle testified that he confirmed the existence of the referral and showed Casey a copy.69  Roelle testified further that he told Casey that he should not provide the White House with any information about the referral.70
<P>Gray called Casey a second time before Casey was able to call Gray back with the information he had learned from Roelle.  Casey testified that Gray told him, "Al, forget my request.  I don't want you to tell me a thing."71  Casey testified that all three conversations occurred on the same day, within a one-hour period.72
<P>Gray denied any memory of ever having spoken with Casey about an RTC criminal referral.73  
<P><P>b.  The Department of Justice
<P>William Barr, President Bush's Attorney General in 1992, testified that White House Cabinet Secretary Edith Holiday asked him on September 17, 1992, during a flight on Air Force One, whether he was aware of an "S&L matter[]" involving Bill Clinton pending before the Justice Department.74  At the time, Holiday was serving as the "chief liaison" between the Bush White House and the 1992 Bush-Quayle Reelection Campaign.75  Holiday had served previously as Chief Counsel and National Financial and Operations Director of the 1988 Bush-Quayle Presidential Campaign and as Counselor to the Secretary and General Counsel of the Department of the Treasury under Secretary Nicholas Brady.76  
<P>Barr testified that when he returned to the Justice Department he asked Ira Raphaelson, his Special Counsel for Financial Crimes, to check whether there was an S&L case involving the Clintons pending before the Justice Department.77  Raphaelson told Barr that he would contact the FBI.78  Raphaelson got back to Barr shortly thereafter and told him that the FBI had no record of such a case.79
<P>Barr testified that he reported to Holiday that there was no record of an S&L matter involving the Clintons pending before the Justice Department.80  Barr thought that Holiday seemed surprised to hear this, and Holiday's reaction made Barr wonder "if she had better information" than he.81
<P>Barr went back to Raphaelson and asked him to check again for a record of a pending S&L matter involving the Clintons.82  Raphaelson contacted the FBI again and the Executive Office of United States Attorneys and soon learned that an RTC criminal referral mentioning the Clintons did exist.83  When Raphaelson reported this information to Barr, Barr was angry because he felt that the United States Attorney in Little Rock had "deliberately withheld" information about the referral from him.84
<P>Raphaelson testified that he learned of the Madison referral near the time that the United States Attorney in Little Rock forwarded it to the Department of Justice in Washington in an "Urgent Report" dated October 7, 1992.85  On October 8, 1992, one day after the Department of Justice in Washington received the referral, Raphaelson discussed the referral at a meeting attended by Robert Mueller, the head of the Justice Department's Criminal Division, and by FBI Assistant Director Larry Potts and other senior FBI officials.86
<P>The next day, October 9, 1992, FBI Headquarters sent a teletype to the FBI's Little Rock field office directing them to review the Madison referral and to report back by October 16, 1992.87  The Little Rock field office reported back on October 16, 1992, concurring in the view of United States Attorney Banks that no action should be taken on the referral at that time.88
<P>Holiday denied any recollection of having asked Barr in September 1992 whether he was aware of an S&L matter involving the Clintons pending before the Department of Justice.89  Holiday also denied any recollection of having had a subsequent conversation with Barr about the S&L matter prior to the 1992 election.90
<P><P>c.  The Passport Controversy
<P>On October 5, 1992, during the same time period in which Boyden Gray, Edith Holiday and William Barr were making inquiries about the existence of an RTC criminal referral involving the Clintons, The Washington Post reported that the FBI was investigating whether Bush Administration officials at the State Department had improperly tried to gain access to Bill Clinton's confidential passport file.91  Efforts of Bush Administration officials to learn more about the 1992 Madison referral and to accelerate its investigation appear to have ceased shortly thereafter.
<P> 8.  The Clinton Justice Department Properly Handled Lewis' 1992 Referral

<P>Despite the consensus view among career prosecutors in the Department of Justice that the 1992 referral failed to cite evidence of any federal criminal offense, the United States Attorneys Office in Little Rock did not send the RTC a letter formally declining to prosecute the matters described in the referral until Paula Casey, the Clinton Administration's newly appointed United States Attorney, did so on October 27, 1993.  It has been suggested that this delay was the result of interference by officials of the Clinton Administration.  The evidence proved otherwise.
<P>As described above, Charles Banks, the Republican-appointed United States Attorney in Little Rock, courageously decided not to act on the referral prior to the 1992 Presidential election.  After the election, Banks wrote a letter to the Department of Justice in Washington seeking advice on whether his office should be recused from the investigation.92  A several-month delay ensued at Main Justice as Banks' recusal inquiry became an unintended casualty of the transition period at the end of the Bush Administration and the beginning of the Clinton Administration.  Douglas Frazier, a career prosecutor who worked in the Office of the Deputy Attorney General during this period, explained the problem as follows: "[T]he entire hierarchy of the Department ceased to exist on one day [January 20, 1993], and it took until May to get it semi reestablished.93  
<P>The referral then was analyzed by the Fraud Section, was found wanting, and was returned by career officials to the United States Attorneys Office in Little Rock with a strong indication that it should not be pursued.94  Specifically, John Keeney, the acting head of the Criminal Division and the senior career prosecutor in the entire Department of Justice, wrote that due to the referral's shortcomings "we would not question a decision by the United States Attorney to decline further substantive action on the referral."95  
<P>Paula Casey subsequently based her formal declination of the referral on the uniform recommendations and analyses of the referral provided by career officials at the Department of Justice, the United States Attorneys Office and the FBI.96  
<P> 9.   Webster Hubbell Had No Involvement in the Handling of Lewis' 1992
<P><P>  Referral

<P>The evidence showed that Webster Hubbell had no involvement in the appointment of Casey as United States Attorney in Little Rock or in any aspect of the Justice Department's handling of the RTC criminal referrals relating to Madison Guaranty.  The Committee's exhaustive examination showed that Hubbell did not influence or seek to influence the Justice Department's disposition of the referrals.  Hubbell himself testified that he did not even hear about the 1992 referral until late summer or early fall 1993.97  No evidence contradicted Hubbell's testimony.
<P> 10.  Other Failed S&Ls in Arkansas Went Uninvestigated Due to Lewis' Focus on Madison Guaranty

<P>As discussed above, Jean Lewis and Special Agent Steve Irons agreed in late 1991, a few months before Jeff Gerth's article appeared in The New York Times -- that Savers Savings Association and First Federal were their top priorities for prompt criminal investigations and that Lewis would fully investigate these two failed Arkansas institutions during the first quarter of 1992.98  Over the course of the next several years, as Lewis instead focused her efforts nearly exclusively on Madison Guaranty, Irons and others at the FBI -- including officials at FBI Headquarters -- repeatedly reminded Lewis and the RTC of their strong interest in receiving timely referrals on Savers Savings and First Federal, which had failed at a cost to taxpayers of $650 million and $900 million, respectively.99  
<P>The efforts of Irons and others at the FBI to get Lewis to work on Savers Savings and First Federal were unavailing.  Despite the FBI's view that Savers Savings and First Federal were "believed to have much greater prosecutive potential than Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan,"100 Lewis did not submit a referral on either institution after putting them at the top of her December 11, 1991 priority list.101
<P>In the spring of 1995, based on the work of an investigator other than Lewis, the RTC finally submitted a criminal referral arising from the failure of First Federal of Little Rock.102  So much time had passed, however, that the FBI and the United States Attorneys Office were unable to act on the referral.  The statute of limitations had expired on most of the allegations contained in the referral, and the documents necessary to the investigation of the few remaining claims had been dispersed throughout the country when the RTC sold off the institution's assets.103

<H3>  B.  The Investigations of David Hale</H3>

<P>The Special Committee's investigation established that the White House did not delay or obstruct the investigation and liquidation of Capital Management Services ("CMS") or the prosecution of David Hale.  Specifically, the evidence showed that Hale was indicted quickly after the Small Business Administration ("SBA") uncovered evidence of Hale's numerous fraudulent activities, and that he received no preferential treatment either by the SBA or the Justice Department.  White House officials knew of developments regarding Hale and CMS, but made no effort to affect the way in which the SBA or the Justice Department handled their investigations.
<P> 1.  The SBA uncovers Hale's fraudulent activity
<P>The SBA began to investigate Hale and CMS in September 1992, when Hale falsely represented to the SBA that CMS had received $13.8 million in donated non-cash assets, and sought SBA matching funds.104   Several aspects of the transaction raised concerns at the SBA about the legitimacy of this financial activity, including the transfer of assets from bank accounts in the Cayman Islands.  Consequently, Wayne Foren, then-Associate Administrator for the program which regulated CMS, ordered an independent examination of the deal.  
<P>The examination report, dated March 11, 1993, raised "questions relative to the donated assets and . . . other transactions."105  Specifically, the examination concluded* that CMS: "transferred assets to an associate without SBA approval;" "did not properly safeguard its assets during the exchange [of portfolio assets];" and "misclassified and misrepresented the sale of assets as financings to small concerns."106  The examination report led Foren to tell Hale that "these assets are not worth the represented value, in which case you are perpetrating a fraud against the SBA, or you are being bribed."107  By this point, Foren was "concerned that [the SBA] was not dealing with an entity that was dealing in good faith and trust with us."108  Later, Foren realized that CMS "was attempting to defraud SBA with its 1992 $13.8 million noncash capital increase and related requests for $6 million of [SBA matching funds], and that its 1988 capital increase and related leverage was in fact fraudulent."109  Foren testified that Hale's activities at CMS constituted "one of the most blatant cases of fraud" he had ever witnessed.110
<P>On May 5, 1993, Foren referred CMS to the SBA's Inspector General for further investigation and sent Hale a letter notifying him of the referral.111  Foren discussed the timing of the referral with Erskine Bowles, who had been nominated to head the SBA.  According to Foren, Bowles told Foren to issue the referral that day.112  On May 20, 1993, the SBA Inspector General referred the case to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), which had superior resources to investigate Hale's complicated fraudulent transactions.  In addition, the U.S. Attorney's Office and the FBI field office in Little Rock had already been investigating Hale's involvement in other fraudulent transactions in 1986 and 1988, which confirmed Foren's concerns about Hale and CMS.113  
<P>On July 21, 1993, the FBI executed a search warrant at CMS' offices and seized documents and records relevant to its investigation.  Shortly after the U.S. Attorney's office received access to relevant records stored in the RTC's Kansas City office, Hale was indicted on September 23, 1993, for defrauding the SBA and making false statements to the SBA.114  What Foren described as the "rather swift" action to indict Hale demonstrated the absence of any improper considerations to Hale.115  
<P>Hale pleaded guilty to two counts of fraud on March 22, 1994.  At the time of his plea, Hale admitted that in 1988 and 1989, $1 million had been temporarily transferred to CMS permitting Hale to mislead the SBA to believe that some non-performing loans had been repaid, thus enabling Hale to receive an additional $900,000 in SBA funds.  Hale also admitted at the time of his guilty plea, that he submitted numerous false statements to the SBA.116  The General Accounting Office has estimated that Hale's fraudulent activity alone cost the SBA $3.4 million.117
<P> 2.  The White House does not interfere with the investigation
<P>It has been alleged that the White House interfered with the SBA's investigation of Hale.  The evidence, however, refutes these allegations.  Foren testified that he briefed SBA Administrator Erskine Bowles on May 5, 1993 about his decision to refer CMS to the SBA Inspector General.  Foren testified that Bowles told Foren to send the referral immediately, that Bowles briefed former White House Chief of Staff Thomas "Mack" McLarty on the CMS referral at dinner that night, and that on May 6 Bowles told Foren about briefing McLarty the night before.  
<P>Bowles and McLarty testified that they did not have dinner on May 5 and that they never discussed CMS.  But even if Bowles did tell McLarty about the referral, Foren testified that there would have been nothing illegal or unethical about Bowles briefing McLarty on CMS, that there were no attempts by McLarty, Bowles or the White House to delay or impede SBA's investigation of CMS, and that Hale was indicted in record time.118  Bowles instructed Foren and the career SBA staff to proceed with the CMS investigation with the same vigor as they would any other investigation and to take all appropriate steps to prosecute any individuals who had committed any fraud or abuse.119  Moreover, Foren's understanding was that he was to "proceed with this case as you do any other case;"120  there was never any suggestion that anyone should "go easy" on Hale.121  
<P>Similarly, there were no instructions from or pressure by the White House to provide Hale with any favored treatment.122  Associate General Counsel Mark Stephens, who handled the liquidation of CMS and served as the SBA's liaison with the FBI, testified that neither White House officials nor SBA political appointees ever tried to influence his investigation of CMS or Hale.123
<P>It should also be noted that on May 5 -- the date when the SBA referred CMS to the Inspector General -- the SBA informed Hale by letter that his company had been referred to the Inspector General.  It was standard procedure at that time to inform a target of an investigation of a referral to the Inspector General.124  Thus, there is no valid claim that the White House gave Hale a "heads up" and thus undermined or compromised the subsequent investigation of CMS.
<P> 3.  The SBA provides the White House with copies of documents already sent to Congress

<P>The SBA did not undermine the Justice Department's investigation of Hale and CMS merely by providing the White House with copies of documents that had already been sent to Congress.  On November 4, 1993, House Small Business Committee Chairman John LaFalce asked the SBA to produce a report on CMS by November 15.  Associate White House Counsel Neil Eggleston read news stories about LaFalce's request.125  Eggleston called the SBA, and later received a return call from SBA General Counsel John Spotila.  Spotila confirmed that the SBA had sent a report to Congress regarding CMS.126  Eggleston asked if it would be appropriate for the SBA to provide the White House with a copy of the report that had been submitted to Congress.127  Spotila later agreed to produce the report, and faxed a copy of the four-page report to Eggleston on November 16.128   When Eggleston realized that attachments to the report had not been provided, he requested those as well.  Spotila determined that the SBA could appropriately provide to the White House copies of the attachments that the SBA had submitted to Congress.129  Thus, the SBA did not provide the White House with any documents that the SBA had not already provided to Congress at the request of the House Small Business Committee Chairman John LaFalce.130  
<P>According to Spotila, SBA ethics officer Martin Teckler said it would be appropriate to give the documents to the White House.  SBA Associate General Counsel Mark Stephens testified that most of the documents that were attached to the report were either public documents (such as the court pleadings filed in a federal court in Arkansas), or contained information that was not confidential.131  Spotila testified that he did not believe sending the documents to the White House constituted a public release of documents.  Importantly, Teckler and Spotila testified that the documents had been screened prior to being sent to Congress.
<P>A few days later, Stephens called Eggleston and told him that the SBA had decided to discuss the issue with officials at the Department of Justice.132  Allen Carver and other Justice Department officials informed Stephens that the SBA should have the White House return the documents for the sake of appearances.  Eggleston returned the documents to Stephens on November 21, just four days after he had received them.133
<P>The document transfer did not undermine the CMS investigation.  Hale was indicted on September 23, 1993 -- nearly two months before the White House received the November 15 report.  Moreover, the evidence showed that the documents were not used inappropriately.  The Deputy Chief of the Justice Department's Fraud Section, Allen Carver, testified that he thought the request for the documents was "totally innocent," and that the White House wanted to track Congressional inquiries.134  Irv Nathan, an aide to Deputy Attorney General Phil Heymann, believed Eggleston's explanation for why he sought the SBA documents was "reasonable and sensible."135   Mark Stephens believed the whole matter was "much ado about nothing" and did not believe that the document transfer undermined or compromised the CMS investigation.136  Teckler, Eggleston, and Spotila did not believe that SBA provided any "sensitive documents" to the White House.137  As Teckler testified, "I think we satisfied ourselves, and I think Mr. Spotila satisfied himself, prior to having sent the documents forward that there were no sensitive documents.  We certainly are satisfied to that effect afterwards."138   Actually, the SBA's report to Congressman LaFalce was converted into an information sheet that was made available to the public at the time the documents were sent to Congress.139  The attachments were merely "background" materials about CMS.140

<H3>C.  The RTC's Handling of the 1993 Referrals</H3>
<P>Jean Lewis has claimed that RTC attorney Julie Yanda "obstructed" the RTC investigation of Madison Guaranty "with her unprecedented demand that her staff first conduct a 'legal review' of the referrals."141  The Committee's investigation demonstrates that the legal review of the 1993 referrals was not an attempt to obstruct the Madison investigation.  The evidence showed that the legal review was appropriate because RTC policy required such a review, because Lewis's 1992 referral was poorly drafted, and because the poor quality of other referrals prepared by the Kansas City RTC criminal investigators had prompted complaints from the FBI and federal prosecutors.
<P>After Lewis and Yanda had testified before the Committee, Chairman D'Amato informed Yanda that "I certainly want publicly to put on the record there is no one on this Committee who impugns you or your integrity, or your undertaking your job."  Chairman D'Amato added that:
<P>I can certainly understand that if actions that you have undertaken in good faith are characterized in that manner, and certainly the fact that on June 17 there was a procedure that then implemented this and the fact that I think you took something like nine days . . . in the review, that certainly does not appear to this Senator to be any actions that should be characterized as obstruction.142

For the reasons stated below, we share this view of the matter.
<P> 1.  The legal review was consistent with RTC policy
<P>RTC policy required a legal review of the referrals before they were sent to the U.S. Attorney's Office in Little Rock.  As Yanda testified, the "unambiguous language" of the June 17, 1993 RTC Policy Directive required her to conduct a legal review of the referrals.  The Policy Directive stated: 
<P>Except in rare circumstances, criminal referrals shall be reviewed by RTC Investigations and Legal Division Criminal Coordinators before they are delivered to the U.S. Attorney and the FBI or other investigative agencies.  RTC criminal coordinators shall make certain that all required and support documents are provided.143

James Thompson, a senior RTC official who served as deputy regional director in Kansas City in 1993, testified that this language certainly supported Yanda's view that the legal division should review referrals before they were sent to prosecutors or the FBI.144   Similarly, RTC criminal coordinator Karen Carmichael interpreted this language as requiring her "to review the referral before it went out, make sure all the attached documents state the same thing as the referral and . . . do a legal review of the referral."145
<P>The legal review was also consistent with the internal policy of the RTC's Kansas City office, which had organized a 1993 blue ribbon task force to facilitate cooperation between the office's attorneys and investigators.146  Thompson, Yanda, and investigations chief Richard Iorio all supported the task force, which Thompson believed helped avoid conflicts "between the investigators and the attorneys on how we were going to get to a decision and who was going to do what."147   Thompson testified that if "you're working on referrals or working on legal cases or working on anything involving the law, somewhere in the process appropriate legal counsel should be sought."148  The goal of the review was simply to improve the quality of the referrals, not to obstruct them.149   Thompson concluded, "if you're afraid of your own attorney's opinion, you have a fundamental problem."150   
<P>The evidence indicates that the legal review was objective and useful.  Yanda assigned Carmichael -- a former aide to Republican Senator Don Nickels151 -- and former Justice Department prosecutor Philip Adams to conduct the legal review.  Yanda, Carmichael, and Adams had no apparent motive to obstruct the RTC's investigation.  Rather, they reviewed the referrals and submitted 13 pages of concerns and recommendations within ten days of receiving the referrals and exhibits.152  Even in that limited amount of time, they were able to flag important issues, such as whether Lorene McDougal, one of the targets of the RTC investigation, had died before Lewis drafted the referral.  As Yanda testified, "I honestly do not believe . . . that it is in the interest of the RTC for its investigators to recommend to the U.S. Attorney and the FBI that they conduct a criminal investigation of a dead person."153   The attorneys also sought to review the referrals regarding double jeopardy, the statute of limitations and other legal issues.154   Randy Knight, one of Lewis's colleagues in the criminal investigations office, believed that it was reasonable and useful for the attorneys to review the referrals and provide their recommendations to the FBI and to the U.S. Attorney.155
<P> 2.  The poor quality of previous referrals made legal review essential
<P>As discussed earlier, career prosecutors at the Justice Department harshly criticized Lewis's 1992 referral.*  The poor quality of the 1992 RTC referral was not unique.  Carmichael testified that in June 1993, an Assistant U.S. Attorney in Oklahoma who handled bank fraud investigations, complained about the "problems he had with the RTC's referrals and how they had all been unfounded, none of them were supported by any facts, that they had spent exceptional amounts of money and time and special authority to travel from their district up to Kansas City to review documentation which was not provided to them, that they had to find documents themselves."156   This federal prosecutor did not "trust" referrals written by Lewis and her colleague Ed Noyes, and "he would not accept the referral" from them that RTC attorneys "had not absolutely put their blessing on and agreed that this was in fact a legitimate referral."157   Other U.S. Attorney's Offices had expressed concerns about the quality of criminal referrals being submitted by Lewis and other investigators in Kansas City.
<P>Another federal prosecutor had complained that Lewis had made a mistake that led to a significantly diminished civil recovery from a financial institution in Paragould, Arkansas.158  In 1992, Lewis had refused to cooperate with the senior RTC attorney who had been assigned to handle a fidelity bond claim.  Lewis failed to inform RTC attorneys about a criminal referral she had sent to the U.S. Attorney's Office.159   Lewis and an Assistant U.S. Attorney arranged a plea agreement with a "target defendant" that did not incorporate any requirement of restitution or cooperation by the defendant.  Consequently, "the interests of the RTC were wholly unprotected"160 and resulted in a loss to the RTC of approximately $200,000.161
<P>Similarly, the U.S. Attorney and the FBI in Little Rock had complained about the failure of the RTC to provide them with subpoenaed documents relevant to the Madison investigation in the fall of 1993.  In late August or early September 1993, the RTC's Kansas City office received a grand jury subpoena for documents related to Madison Guaranty.162   After several months of trying to locate these documents, Yanda and Carmichael eventually discovered Lewis and Ausen "had 100 boxes worth of documents responsive to subpoenas that the FBI and AUSA knew about but which nobody had bothered to tell [RTC lawyers] about, despite our repeated requests."163   Consequently, Yanda concluded that "we had a team member, Ms. Lewis, who had a demonstrated failure to perform as part of that team" and asked that Lewis be removed from the Madison investigation.164
<P>Given these facts, it is obvious that a legal review of Lewis's criminal referrals was reasonable and appropriate.  The review allowed RTC lawyers to be aware of all facts related to their cases and allowed the RTC to maximize the recovery of taxpayer dollars lost due to fraudulent activity.  Moreover, the legal review may have been useful to federal prosecutors and to the FBI in assessing and pursuing matters that were referred to them.

<P> 3.  The legal review was not an attempt to impede the Madison investigation
<P>There exists no evidence that the legal review was an attempt to impede the RTC investigation of Madison Guaranty.  Randy Knight, an RTC criminal investigator who prepared two of the 1993 criminal referrals, did not believe that the legal review of the referrals was intended to undermine or impede the investigation of Madison Guaranty or was politically motivated.165  Richard Iorio, Lewis's supervisor, noted that the legal review of the referrals took no more than nine days, and that all referrals drafted since the issuance of the June 17 policy directive have been subjected to the same legal review for a comparable length of time as the 1993 Madison referrals.166
<P>Similarly, Lewis's claim that the legal review of the 1993 referrals was "unprecedented" is extremely misleading.  As Yanda testified, 
<P>the review of the Madison referrals was unprecedented only in the unremarkable sense that they were the first ones made available to my lawyers and me in order for such a review to occur.  I assure you that if previous referrals had been provided for review, they would have received the same professional analysis that Ms. Carmichael and Mr. Adams applied to the Madison referrals, and that attorneys in my section have applied to every referral that we have received since September 1993.167

Carmichael's testimony corroborated Yanda's recollection that these were simply the first referrals that the investigators had presented for legal review after the nationwide issuance of the June 17, 1993 Policy Directive.168   Carmichael testified that there was nothing "novel" about the review of the Madison referrals, noting that she has reviewed four other referrals in addition to the Madison referrals.169  

<P> 4.  Lewis was not a credible witness and her allegations are therefore suspect
<P>
<P>Lewis's testimony contained numerous inconsistencies and implausible statements.  Lewis testified, for example, that the recorder that taped her entire conversation with April Breslaw on February 2, 1994, turned on by itself.170   In explaining this unlikely phenomenon, Lewis admitted that the tape recorder was not a voice-activated machine171 but testified that the tape recorder was "eight years old at that point, it didn't always function as it was expected to."172  The Committee issued a subpoena for that tape recorder, but Lewis testified that after the recorder "died" in mid-February 1994, she purchased a new tape recorder and discarded the old one, which had supposedly taped conversation with Breslaw.173   In response to the Committee's request for documentation of the purchase of the "new" recorder, Lewis's attorney sent a November 7, 1995 letter to the Committee indicating that "Ms. Lewis has reviewed her bank statements . . . and determined that the following entry . . . reflects the purchase of the tape recorder:
     <PRE>
     "Date               Description                              Checks/Debits
     "02-17          #Purchase                              64.94
                         "Merchant Purchase Terminal 440140
                         "Office Depot #176 Shawnee KS"
</PRE>
     The evidence, however, contradicts Lewis's assertion.  Office Depot, the store that sold the new tape recorder to Lewis, subsequently provided records that proved that Lewis purchased other office supplies, not the new recorder, on February 17, 1994.  The Office Depot records incontrovertibly established that Lewis had actually purchased the new tape recorder on January 17, 1994, over two weeks prior to the taping of the conversation with Breslaw.174  Thus, Lewis's explanation of the tape recorder turning on by itself -- which strained credulity in the first place -- is refuted by the fact that she had already purchased the new tape recorder and, by her own admission, had discarded the old recorder when she purchased the new one.    
<P>In addition, it was improper for Lewis to have taped this conversation without first obtaining Breslaw's consent.  Lewis denied deliberately setting out to surreptitiously record her conversation with Breslaw.  Nevertheless, Lewis admitted that she was aware from the beginning that the conversation was being recorded and that she consciously decided to continue taping the conversation.175  To insure that Breslaw remained unaware that the conversation was being taped, Lewis sat on the same side of her desk as Breslaw so that Breslaw "would not see the tape recorder."176  Former RTC General Counsel Ellen Kulka testified that this clandestine taping of Breslaw was one of the justifications for placing Lewis on administrative leave.177 *
<P>Another example of Lewis's implausible testimony before the Special Committee occurred when Lewis stated that she never attempted to profit from the Madison investigation.178   Lewis later conceded she attempted to market versions of copyrighted shirts and products containing the acronym "B.I.T.C.H.," which stood for "Boys I'm Taking Charge, Hillary" or "Bubba, I've taken charge. Hillary."179  Lewis provided her RTC office telephone number to potential investors so that she could pursue her business interests while at work.180   Lewis testified that the use of the word "bitch" was "in no way intended to denigrate the First Lady."181  Lewis refused to acknowledge the impropriety in conducting personal business affairs in her governmental office, or in marketing a product that disparaged people she had identified as witnesses in the course of her investigation.
<P>Finally, Lewis leaked confidential RTC information during her February 18, 1994 meeting with Republican Congressman Jim Leach.  The release of this confidential information directly violated RTC policy.  The RTC's Director of the Office of Investigations and several members of the RTC's Office of the General Counsel issued a June 17, 1993 Memorandum that stated, "All referrals are sensitive and must be handled with appropriate confidentiality and care."182  James Thompson, an RTC vice president in the Kansas City region in 1993, testified that criminal referrals and their exhibits are confidential material, and that such materials "would not be disclosed to Congress" from "the regional level."183  Nevertheless, Lewis provided Congressman Leach with material she knew to be confidential, such as internal RTC memoranda and correspondence regarding the Madison referrals, as well as documents from Madison Guaranty, Madison Bank and Madison Financial Corporation gathered by the RTC during the course of its investigation.  Lewis also provided Congressman Leach with a summary of her conversation with Breslaw after playing the tape recording for Congressman Leach, even though she recognized that the conversation contained confidential information.184   Predictably, Congressman Leach then released all of these documents to the public on March 24, 1994.   Thus, Lewis's unilateral decision to leak RTC documents to Congressman Leach directly resulted in the public dissemination of confidential information in the middle of the Special Prosecutor's investigation of Madison-related matters.
<P>Lewis fully understood the impropriety in releasing these materials.  She recognized that "there are fairly stringent regulations with regard to documents that are released from government agencies for public access"185  including the June 17 RTC Memorandum discussed above.   As Lewis recognized, these restrictions exist because disclosing confidential information to third parties "[m]ight create a problem" for an ongoing investigation.186   However, Lewis chose not to notify her supervisors in advance of her meeting with Congressman Leach because she feared they would not have concurred with her decision to provide Congressman Leach with confidential RTC documents.187   
<P>The facts refute Lewis's claim that she was acting as a "whistle blower" by disclosing this confidential information to Congressman Leach.  As Knight observed, none of the people listed in the referral "are our supervisors or government employees . . . so that would not be whistle-blowing; that would be criminal."188  Knight correctly believed that leaking confidential information to Congressman Leach  was no different than providing the information to the press because "the outcome is the same."189  Most significantly, Special Prosecutor Robert Fiske, a Republican and a former federal prosecutor, was conducting an ongoing investigation regarding transactions that directly related to the confidential information that Lewis leaked to Congressman Leach.  Instead of providing relevant information to the prosecutor, Lewis chose to politicize the investigation by disclosing the information to a Republican congressman who promptly released the confidential information to the public.
<P>The leaking of this information constituted a serious breach of RTC policies.  Knight noted that some of Lewis's colleagues felt that "`if I would have done that, I'd have been fired'" and that RTC employees had been fired for more minor infractions -- like misusing postage stamps -- than leaking confidential documents.190   Thompson agreed, testifying that the leak of confidential information connected to a criminal referral "would be cause for disciplinary action" and "very likely could include termination of the employee."191

<H3> D.  The Justice Department's Handling of the 1993 Referrals</H3>

     It has been alleged that U.S. Attorney Paula Casey treated David Hale unfairly by requiring him to explain what information he could provide to the prosecution before entering a plea agreement with Hale.  The evidence showed, however, that Casey followed standard Justice Department procedures in the negotiations with Hale and his attorney, Randy Coleman.  Actually, Casey offered Hale a more lenient plea than Hale ultimately accepted from the Independent Counsel.
<P> 1.  The U.S. Attorney's office handled the 1993 referrals properly
<P>The FBI in Little Rock received the SBA referral regarding Hale and CMS in June 1993.192  Assistant U.S. Attorney Fletcher Jackson reviewed the referral and then reviewed the documents that the FBI had seized while executing a search warrant at CMS's offices on July 21, 1993.   Interestingly, the RTC office in Kansas City had not been cooperating with the FBI's attempts to obtain information relevant to their investigation.  The FBI contacted Michael Johnson, First Assistant U.S. Attorney in Little Rock, for assistance in resolving the matter.  As Johnson testified, "The agents indicated to me that they were seeking records in the possession of the RTC essential for the initial phase of the FBI's criminal investigation.  They indicated to me that the RTC had continually represented to them that the records needed to be retained in Kansas City so that the RTC personnel could prepare criminal referrals.  They indicated to me that the criminal referrals had been promised in July 1993, but the RTC kept delaying the date.  The agents further indicated to me that they believed the referrals would concern the same matters that the FBI had outline to me and already wanted to investigate."193  Johnson interceded on the agents' behalf,* but ultimately the agents "simply had to wait until the RTC sent the referrals in mid-October before we could actually begin what we had been already attempting to do."194 
<P>Paula Casey, the U.S. Attorney in Little Rock, recalled receiving the criminal referrals from the RTC's Kansas City office in October 1993.  After reviewing these referrals, Casey believed she had to recuse herself from the investigation.195  Her top assistant, career prosecutor Michael Johnson, however, asked her to delay making a recusal request until he and the FBI had had a chance to assess the referrals more carefully.196   Johnson, who had no connection with individuals named in the referrals, wanted to make a "preliminary assessment" of the referrals because his "past experience with the RTC" caused him to "not have the confidence in the RTC that [he] had in the FBI."197  By then Johnson had read Jean Lewis's 1992 referral, and "[t]he nature of the referral and the manner in which it was set forth made me cautious about relying on allegations by the RTC as the sole basis to make the important decision of recusal."198 Johnson therefore discussed the referrals with the FBI, drafted subpoenas for relevant documents, and arranged to travel to Kansas City to review RTC documents.  
<P>On November 3, 1995, Casey met with senior Justice Department officials in Washington, where the 1993 referrals were discussed.  The general consensus of the group was that Casey should recuse.  On November 5, 1993, Casey sent a written recusal letter to Deputy Attorney General Phil Heymann, in which she formally recused herself and the U.S. Attorney's office in Little Rock from the investigation of Hale and the 1993 referrals.199  Heymann accepted her recusal request, and a team of prosecutors from the Justice Department, led by former Nixon appointee Donald MacKay, assumed control of the investigation.  
<P>Before Johnson's departure for Kansas City, which had been planned for November 8, Casey informed him that she had recused the office from the matter, therefore eliminating the need for Johnson to travel to Kansas City. Mackay went to Kansas City instead.200  Johnson then facilitated the transition of the Hale matter and the 1993 criminal referrals to the Justice Department and ultimately to the Independent Counsel's office.201 
<P>Casey testified that no one in her office attempted "to obstruct the investigation of any of the RTC referrals during the few weeks that they were in my office." 202   Johnson testified that "no one associated with the Department of Justice, the White House, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, or any other federal agency, ever attempted to delay, control or obstruct the investigation being conducted by our office."203  Similarly, the Little Rock prosecutor who handled the Hale investigation and the criminal referrals testified that prior to Casey's decision to recuse herself, Casey "didn't interfere in any way with what I was doing."204
<P> 2.  Plea negotiations with Hale were handled appropriately
<P>Hale demanded that U.S. Attorney Paula Casey grant him an unusually lenient plea agreement -- without first requiring him to proffer any facts relevant to the criminal investigation.205  Coleman wanted a misdemeanor plea for Hale that would have allowed Hale to retain his license to practice law and to remain a judge.206  Casey and numerous career Justice Department officials uniformly testified that, in the absence of such a proffer, the U.S. Attorney would have risked "buying a pig in a poke" -- that is, giving the benefit of a lenient plea without knowing whether they would receive the benefit of information that would be useful to the prosecution.207  Michael Johnson, a career prosecutor with 22 years of experience, testified that it is "a common occurrence, when dealing with potential defendants who seek leniency in exchange for information, to demand and obtain from them a proffer, that is, a preview of the evidence they have to offer before agreeing to the arrangement."208   According to Johnson, the proffer would have allowed the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's office "to assess and corroborate the information, and to make the determination whether to enter into a plea arrangement whereby Mr. Hale would receive leniency in exchange for the information and testimony.  It was standard Department of Justice operating procedure."209  The high-ranking career Justice Department prosecutors who reviewed the actions of the U.S. Attorney's office in Little Rock agreed that the office acted appropriately in rejecting Hale's attempt to push them into a blind agreement.
<P>Rather than make a proffer to the prosecutors, Hale chose to contact Clinton's most vociferous opponents,210 and to provide lengthy interviews to reporters while Coleman contacted the White House Counsel's Office in a futile attempt to get the White House to do something "foolish" with respect to the investigation.211  Johnson believed that Coleman "was manipulating public perception, in part through the news media, in an effort to scare [the U.S. Attorney's office] into capitulating regarding the potential indictment of his client."212 Nevertheless, no one in the White House tried to influence Casey's or the Justice Department's handling the Hale case.213  
<P>On November 8, 1993, Donald Mackay, a prosecutor in the Department of Justice's Fraud Section assumed the investigation of the Hale matter and the nine criminal referrals.214  The Department of Justice's position regarding Hale's plea demands was the same as Casey's position.  Like Casey, Mackay informed Coleman that the prosecution would not plea bargain with Hale until Hale informed them directly of the information he could provide in exchange for the agreement.215 According to Acting Assistant Attorney General John Keeney, the Justice Department position was "that no deal would be made with Hale until we had a lawyer's proffer and were able to evaluate it".216  Yet, Hale still refused to make a proffer in absence of a promise of immunity or the dismissal of the charges.217 
<P>Johnson noted that Hale eventually began to negotiate "in earnest" with the U.S. Attorney's office on October 21, 1993:  "As a result of that negotiation, Mr. Hale agreed to accept a felony plea and make himself available for interview.  However, by [the] time he did so, on November 8th, 1993, our office had recused from the case."218  The Justice Department and then the Office of the Independent Counsel assumed the negotiations.  Ultimately, the Independent Counsel required Hale to plead guilty to two felony counts, while Casey had insisted on a plea to a single count -- a dramatic contrast to the grant of immunity or misdemeanor plea Hale originally had sought.219  Michael Johnson, who supervised the plea negotiations with Hale, summarized the matter:
<P>The United State's Attorney's office offered Mr. Hale a plea agreement which would have required him to plead guilty to a single felony.  He rejected that and insisted on receiving immunity, or at most, pleading to a misdemeanor offense.  This issue was ultimately resolved between Mr. Hale and the Independent Counsel's office when Mr. Hale pled guilty to two felony offenses, not one.220

The prosecutors handled negotiations with Hale and Coleman properly.  Given the plea offer Hale ultimately accepted from the Independent Counsel, it is clear that the U.S. Attorney would have acted unwisely if she had accepted Hale's requests for lenient treatment.
<P> 3.  Casey's recusal was handled properly
<P>As discussed above, Hale and Coleman refused to make a proffer during the plea negotiations with the U.S. Attorney's office.  As a result, prosecutors were left with nothing beyond unsubstantiated rumors circulating in media accounts regarding Hale's allegations about President Clinton.  Michael Johnson, a career prosecutor and the top Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Little Rock office, advised Casey not to recuse herself on the basis of unsupported rumors that Hale had circulated in the media:
<P>I advised Ms. Casey of the same things that I had told Mr. Keeney, and urged her for the same reasons not to consider recusal unless and until we had obtained information on which a recusal might be warranted, and until we had an opportunity to assess the reliability of that information.  It was my professional view then, and it is my professional view now, that to do otherwise was irresponsible and would abdicate our duty as prosecutors.221

Johnson was concerned that a recusal under these circumstances would set a precedent that could result in defendants routinely forcing the U.S. Attorney's office out of cases simply by making unsupported allegations against Governor Tucker or the Clintons.222  
<P>Nevertheless, Casey recused herself on November 5, 1993, to avoid the appearance of any conflict of interest.  After MacKay assumed control of the investigation, he handled plea negotiations in essentially the same manner as Casey had previously.223  Most significantly, officials in the Justice Department and the U.S. Attorney's office in Little Rock agreed that the timing of Casey's recusal did not affect the investigation in any way.  As Fletcher Jackson testified, 
<P>[Casey] didn't interfere in any way with what I was doing.  So I don't really think it made any difference whether she recused one week or the next week or whenever, and when she eventually did.  I don't see any harm that occurred from, you know, from when . . . it occurred.224

<P> 4.  The White House did not influence the investigation

<P>Casey testified that her office was not subjected to any attempt by the White House or Justice Department to improperly influence the investigation of Hale.  She testified that she did not speak with Webster Hubbell in 1993.225   Neither Casey nor anyone in her office was in contact with the White House on this matter.226  Johnson also was not aware of anyone in his office speaking to Hubbell about Hale, Madison Guaranty or the criminal referrals.227  Lastly, Hubbell testified that although a September 1993 internal Justice Department memorandum routinely routed to him informed him of the referral, he took no action regarding the memorandum.228
<P>In sum, the best evidence proving the lack of White House interference was the prompt indictment of Hale and the refusal of the White House to be drawn into Hale's scheme to involve the White House in the matter.  Casey's handling of the matter in conjunction with career prosecutors in the Little Rock U.S. Attorney's office was entirely consistent with Justice Department procedures and was in all respects proper.

<H3>  E.  The Clinton Administration's Contacts with Beverly Bassett Schaffer in 1993
       and 1994 Were Proper and Appropriate
</H3>
<P>On April 29, 1985, Mrs. Clinton had a brief telephone conversation with Arkansas Securities Commissioner Beverly Bassett [Schaffer].  Mrs. Clinton informed Schaffer that Madison Guaranty planned to submit a proposal to issue preferred stock, and asked Schaffer to whom the application should be directed.229  Schaffer advised Mrs. Clinton that she was familiar with the issue of preferred stock offerings by savings and loan associations, and considered it "very simple, very basic, very straightforward."230  Although the conversation lasted only five minutes, and was not substantive,231 it has been alleged that as a consequence of the conversation Madison Guaranty received preferential treatment from the Arkansas Securities Department.232  As discussed in Section III.E, below, the allegation of favored treatment lacks merit.  
<P>It also has been suggested that the Clinton Administration interfered with possible investigations into Mrs. Clinton's conversation with Schaffer.  In particular, it has been alleged that in late 1993 and early 1994 representatives of the Clinton Administration improperly importuned Schaffer to defend Mrs. Clinton against allegations of impropriety arising out of their conversation.  The evidence does not support the allegation that the Clinton Administration sought to influence the content of Schaffer's statements on the issue.  All the Administration sought to do was to have Schaffer speak publicly, as she had done in 1992, to rebut false allegations raised in the press.  It was proper and appropriate for Administration representatives to ask Schaffer to speak out publicly regarding the regulation of Madison Guaranty during the 1980s.  Indeed, there was no reason for the Administration to want to influence what Schaffer would say; her past public statements fully supported the conclusion that Mrs. Clinton obtained no special treatment for Madison Guaranty with the Arkansas Securities Department.  
<P> 1.  Background
<P>During the 1992 presidential campaign, regulatory treatment of Madison Guaranty -- including Mrs. Clinton's conversation with Schaffer -- became a political issue.  In this regard, allegations were raised that the conversation resulted in special treatment for Madison Guaranty.  Schaffer, however, publicly denied that Madison Guaranty received favored treatment from the Arkansas Securities Department while she was Commissioner.233  Schaffer also made herself available to the press to refute the allegations of special treatment.
<P>By late 1993, press interest in the regulatory treatment of Madison Guaranty had revived.  For example, during the first week of November 1993, The Washington Post, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal published articles on the subject.234  Also, on December 20, 1993, The New York Times published an editorial urging the Administration to provide the press with additional information regarding the regulation of Madison Guaranty.235  President Clinton read the article and forwarded it to Mack McLarty and Bruce Lindsey.  The President noted in the margin:  "This is important to be on top of.  Bassett did a good job in [campaign] on this -- can she now."236
<P>Approximately a week later, President Clinton and Bruce Lindsey attended a University of Arkansas basketball game.237  Ms. Schaffer's husband, Archie Schaffer, also attended the game, but with others.*  During halftime, the President and Lindsey visited the corporate box owned by Tyson's Chicken.  By coincidence, Schaffer also visited the Tyson's box.238  Lindsey took the opportunity to ask Archie Schaffer whether Ms. Schaffer would restate publicly the views she expressed in 1992 on the Securities Department's handling of Madison Guaranty.239   Mr. Schaffer was noncommittal -- not because Ms. Schaffer's views had changed, but because by this time, Ms. Schaffer was the subject of so much media attention that her life had been disrupted.240  Thus, Ms. Schaffer was reluctant to get involved again with the press.  At no time during this conversation -- or any other conversation -- did Lindsey seek to influence the substance of Ms. Schaffer's story.241
<P>During the first two weeks of January 1994, senior White House officials met regularly to coordinate the Administration's response to press inquiries concerning Whitewater.242  At one such meeting, on January 7, 1994, the discussion included possible responses to the renewed allegations that Madison Guaranty received special treatment from the Arkansas Securities Department.243  
<P>According to Mark Gearan's notes of the meeting, Deputy White House Chief of Staff Harold Ickes considered Ms. Schaffer's statements an important part of the Administration's response.  Before relying on her statements, however, Ickes wanted to "make sure her story is OK."244  This note has been mischaracterized as indicating an interest in manipulating Ms. Schaffer's statements.  The evidence showed, however, that Ickes had no interest in manipulating the content of Ms. Schaffer's statements.  To the contrary, Ickes testified that he had two goals concerning Ms. Schaffer:  first, to ensure that Ms. Schaffer made the correct legal judgment regarding the preferred stock issue back in 1985, i.e., that Madison Guaranty received no favored treatment; and second, assuming that Ms. Schaffer acted properly in 1985, to persuade her to speak out publicly again.245  Gearan confirmed Ickes's explanation.246 
<P>Documentary evidence also confirmed Ickes' testimony.  The White House did, in fact, conduct research into whether Ms. Schaffer reached the correct judgment on the preferred stock issue.  A January 11, 1994 memo by Jake Siewert collected numerous authorities in support of Schaffer's opinion that a state chartered S&L in Arkansas could issue preferred stock.247  The Majority has characterized Madison Guaranty's inquiry as "novel" and "controversial."  However, the research conducted by the White House demonstrated that it was neither.  Federally insured savings and loan associations had authority to issue preferred stock as early as 1975.248  By 1984, Federal Home Loan Bank Board ("FHLBB") regulations expressly recognized that the issuance of preferred stock by savings and loan associations was common.249  In fact, the FHLBB actively encouraged thrifts to raise capital by issuing preferred shares under appropriate circumstances.250
<P>During the January 7 meeting, consideration was also given to contacting Schaffer to determine whether she would be willing to speak to the press.251  Several possible emissaries were considered to visit Ms. Schaffer in Arkansas, including Paul Begala, Bruce Lindsey, and Michael Waldman.252  There was also a discussion about the possibility that James L. (Skip) Rutherford or John Tisdale could contact Ms. Schaffer.253
<P>  There was no legal or ethical reason not to contact Schaffer.  It would have been appropriate and proper to confirm Schaffer's recollection of events that had taken place nearly a decade earlier, and to ask her to state her recollection publicly, as she had in 1992.  In the end, however, the group concluded that it would not be politically prudent to contact Schaffer.  According to Gearan's notes, Ickes expressed concern that an attempt to contact Schaffer would be misinterpreted as an attempt to alter her recollection.254  This, in turn, would simply create another news story.255  As such, the decision was made not to contact Schaffer, even though doing so would have been proper.256
<P>Finally, the implication has been raised that the White House sought to influence the substance of Schaffer's statements regarding the regulatory treatment of Madison Guaranty.  This allegation is groundless.  There was no discussion of influencing Schaffer's statements regarding Madison Guaranty at the January 7 meeting -- or any other meeting.257  Moreover, during the 1992 presidential campaign, Schaffer made numerous public statements regarding the regulation of Madison Guaranty.  In every instance, Schaffer described the regulatory treatment of Madison Guaranty as proper and appropriate.  As such, there was no reason for the White House to influence her testimony.
<P> 2.  There were no improper contacts between the Clinton Administration
<P><P> and Beverly Bassett Schaffer

<P>Despite Ickes's determination that it would be politically imprudent to send an emissary to speak with Schaffer, the press continued to make inquiries regarding the regulatory treatment of Madison Guaranty.  As such, the Administration still had to communicate with Schaffer to determine whether she would respond to press inquiries.  Several people did, in fact, reach out to Schaffer.  The implication has been raised that these individuals sought to influence Schaffer's recollection of events.  The evidence, however, showed that there were no improper contacts between the Clinton Administration and Schaffer.  
<P>Rutherford -- an Arkansan who worked on the Clinton presidential campaign -- testified that he had a telephone conversation with Mr. Schaffer, which was possibly joined by Ms. Schaffer, in December 1993 or January 1994.  During that conversation they discussed the Schaffers' concern that Ms. Schaffer was being stalked by the news media.258  Mr. Schaffer and Rutherford also had a subsequent telephone conversation, in December or January, in which they discussed the concern about a stalker, the large number of press calls Ms. Schaffer was receiving, and the possibility that Ms. Schaffer might hold a press conference to respond to the press inquiries.259  There was nothing improper about these conversations.  In any event, the conversations did not result from White House efforts to contact Ms. Schaffer.  Rutherford testified that:  "no one at the White House ever asked me to contact Beverly Bassett Schaffer."260<P>  Schaffer also spoke with John Tisdale, a lawyer at her firm, who asked her to assist him in compiling a chronology and a list of documents concerning Whitewater.261  There is no evidence that Tisdale sought to influence Schaffer.*<P>  
<P>Finally, when Schaffer testified before the Special Committee, she was asked whether she spoke with anyone from the Clinton Administration regarding the regulatory treatment of Madison Guaranty after the 1992 presidential campaign.  Initially, Schaffer did not recall any such conversations.262  She later agreed that she "may" have spoken with Lindsey, but was not sure.  Moreover, even if she did speak with Lindsey, "[the conversation] wasn't of any
consequence.. ."263   In the end, Schaffer could not recall any conversation in which the White House attempted to influence her actions relating to Madison Guaranty and no one tried to influence the substance of Schaffer's statements that Madison Guaranty received no special treatment.
<P><P> 3.  Conclusion
<P>The evidence demonstrated that the Clinton Administration's dealings with Beverly Bassett Schaffer during 1993 and 1994 were proper and appropriate.  No efforts were made to influence or alter her recollections regarding the regulatory treatment of Madison Guaranty (or any other subject).  On the contrary, the Clinton Administration sought only to confirm that Schaffer's actions as Arkansas Securities Commissioner were proper -- which they were -- and to encourage her to speak publicly about them.

<H3>F.  The OGE Report and the Transmission of Investigative Materials to
 Transmission of Investigative Materials to the White House and Secretary Bentsen</H3>

<P>On March 4, 1994, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen asked the Office of Government Ethics ("OGE") to review a series of contacts among officials of the Treasury Department ("Treasury"), the Resolution Trust Corporation ("RTC") and the White House between September 1993 and February 1994 ("the White House/Treasury contacts").  Specifically, Secretary Bentsen asked OGE to determine whether the Treasury officials who participated in the White House/Treasury contacts had violated federal ethics standards.  
<P>At OGE's request, the Inspectors General of the Treasury ("Treasury-IG") and the RTC ("RTC-IG") conducted a comprehensive factual investigation of the White House/Treasury contacts.  Based on the IGs' fact-finding, OGE concluded on July 31, 1994 that no current Treasury officials violated the ethics rules and regulations set forth in the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch.264
<P>Section (b)(2)(E) of Senate Resolution 120 authorized the Special Committee to investigate whether improprieties occurred in connection with the OGE investigation.  In particular, the Committee was authorized to investigate whether the OGE report or related transcripts of depositions taken Treasury-IG and RTC-IG investigators:  
<P>(i) were improperly released to White House officials or others prior to their testimony before the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs pursuant to Senate Resolution 229 (103d Congress); or
<P>(ii) were used to communicate to White House officials or to others confidential RTC information relating to Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan Association or Whitewater Development Corporation.
The evidence demonstrates that no improprieties occurred in connection with the IGs' investigation or OGE's analysis.   
<P> 1.  OGE'S Investigation Was Thorough and Complete, and Received the Full
<P><P> Cooperation of the Administration

<P>It has been suggested that OGE's conclusions should be discounted because the Inspectors Generals' investigation was incomplete and did not have the Administration's full cooperation.  In fact, the record is clear that the investigation was thorough and complete, and received full cooperation from the Administration.  Every witness the investigators sought to depose voluntarily agreed to testify, and every document the investigators requested was made available to them.  Moreover, the IGs' investigators and OGE officials uniformly testified that no one -- from within the Administration or outside it -- tried to influence their inquiry in any way.    
<P><P>a.  The Inspectors Generals' investigation was thorough and complete
<P>  The IG investigators uniformly testified that their inquiry was thorough and complete.  At least 8 professional investigators worked virtually full-time for a month and conducted 27 depositions and reviewed thousands of pages of documents.  The record is clear that the investigators received testimony from every witness they sought.265  James Cottos, the lead Treasury-IG investigator, stated clearly that:  
<P>We had access to all the witnesses that we deemed necessary.  No one restricted us on witnesses, whether it be the White House, Treasury, RTC.  Everyone we felt we had to interview was made available to us.266
<P>
Moreover, the witnesses all appeared voluntarily.  This is particularly significant because the investigators had no authority to compel testimony.267  
<P>Similarly, the record is clear that the investigators had access to every document they sought.268  The documents were provided to them without material conditions or limitations.269  Here, too, the Administration's cooperation was largely voluntary.  The IGs had no legal authority to compel production of documents from outside their own agencies.  Yet the investigators were denied nothing.  In this regard, Patricia Black, Counsel to the Inspector General of the RTC, stated succinctly:  "I know of no relevant materials that we were denied."270  
<P>Finally, the investigators uniformly testified that they were free to follow whatever leads they developed.  No one in the Administration tried to limit the scope of their inquiry or to restrict the investigation.271  In this regard, OGE Director Stephen Potts stated plainly that "[t]here were no limits placed on our role" and no subjects that OGE could not address.272  OGE's Deputy General Counsel Jane Ley agreed:  "To my knowledge . . . no limits were placed on the investigation."273
<P><P>b.  The IGs had sufficient time to conduct the investigation
<P>The majority also has questioned the investigation on the grounds that the IGs worked under time constraints.  There is no question that the investigators completed the investigation expeditiously, but this does not diminish the value of the investigation.  The investigators uniformly testified that they had sufficient time to conduct a thorough investigation.
<P>As a preliminary matter, it should be emphasized that the Administration did not impose any time limits on the investigators.  Any time concerns were caused by the Special Counsel and congressional investigators.  
<P>In March 1994, while planning the investigation, OGE became concerned that its investigation might affect Special Counsel Fiske's inquiry into the White House/Treasury contacts.274  Accordingly, OGE consulted with Fiske, and at his request, agreed to postpone its investigation until Fiske advised otherwise.  OGE and the IGs continued to plan their inquiry and to perform background research, but did not contact witnesses.275  On June 30, 1994, Fiske advised OGE that it could begin its investigation.  
<P>By the time Fiske approved the OGE investigation, the Senate Banking Committee and House Banking Committee also had begun investigations into the White House/Treasury contacts.  In addition, the White House had initiated an internal review under the direction of Special Counsel Lloyd Cutler.  Thus, when OGE began its investigation on June 30, 1994, its investigation was one of five overlapping inquiries.  
<P>In general, the other investigations had little bearing on OGE's efforts.  However, the congressional investigations did have one concrete effect.  By June 30, 1994, it was clear that Congress would call Secretary Bentsen to testify regarding the White House/Treasury contacts.  In order to avoid interference with OGE's investigation, Secretary Bentsen had forbidden any other internal Treasury Department inquiries into the White House/Treasury contacts.276  Therefore, as a practical matter, OGE was the only source for the information Secretary Bentsen needed to provide Congress with complete and accurate testimony.
<P>Although the investigators knew that Secretary Bentsen was dependent upon their efforts -- and they wanted to accommodate his needs -- this concern did not materially affect the investigation.  The investigators uniformly testified that no one instructed them to complete their work by a specific date.277  They further testified that irrespective of Secretary Bentsen's congressional testimony, they would not have concluded the investigation if it remained incomplete.278  Finally, the investigators testified that there were no other witnesses they would have deposed and no other documents they would have reviewed if they had had more time.279  RTC-IG Counsel Black stated:
<P>I am aware of no evidence we didn't collect or any witnesses we did not speak to that I would say we needed to.280

Therefore, the evidence established that the time concerns arising out of the Administration's efforts to cooperate with congressional investigations had no substantive impact on the IGs' inquiry.  The investigators had sufficient time to conduct a thorough and complete investigation.
<P><P>c.  The Administration cooperated fully with the investigation
<P>In reviewing the IGs' investigation, it cannot be forgotten that Secretary Bentsen initiated the inquiry.  As such, the investigation only took place because the Administration requested it.  Moreover, the Administration went to great lengths to ensure that the investigation would be vigorous and credible.  OGE Director Potts explained that:
<P>[Secretary Bentsen] wanted to have as independent and authoritative analysis of the situation as he could get, so that's why he was calling on us.281

<P>Further, as discussed above, the record shows that the Administration cooperated fully with the investigation.  The investigators testified that they had access to all the witnesses and documents they sought.  These facts alone belie the Majority's criticism.
<P>Finally, the investigators themselves rejected any suggestion that their investigation was impeded, or that the Administration somehow failed to cooperate.  For instance, Assistant Treasury IG James Cottos stated that the Administration cooperated completely with the investigation.  He explained:
<P>I think that everyone interviewed cooperated, Treasury people, RTC people and the White House people.  There was not anything that came back about people not cooperating.282
<P>
RTC-IG Counsel Patricia Black concurred; she described the Administrative as "cooperative in full."283
<P>In the end, the investigators concluded that the cooperation of witnesses must have reflected the attitude of high level Administration officials.284  Witnesses rightly believed that their superiors expected them to cooperate fully, and they did so.  
<P><P>d.  No one in the Administration tried to influence the IGs' investigation or OGE's conclusions

<P>The evidence demonstrates that the Administration did not seek to influence the IGs' investigation or OGE's analysis in any way.  On the contrary, the testimony clearly establishes that the IGs and OGE were permitted to do their jobs as they deemed appropriate.  OGE Director Stephen Potts and Deputy General Counsel Jane Ley both testified that no one in the Administration tried to influence OGE's analysis.285   Similarly, the RTC-IG investigators and the Treasury-IG investigators uniformly testified that no one from the Administration tried to pressure them.286 
<P><P>e.  Conclusion
<P>In light of the foregoing, it is clear that the IGs' investigation was thorough and complete.  Moreover, the Administration made no effort to influence the investigation and, in fact, sought to facilitate the inquiry.  The lead Treasury-IG investigator, James Cottos, stated that he was "proud" of the investigation.287  According to OGE Deputy General Counsel Jane Ley, subsequent events confirm that the investigation was deserving of Cottos' confidence.  She stated:
<P>With the benefit of what's gone on since . . . there has been no other document, no other information that has shown up through anybody else's investigation, through any news people, through anything else that's indicated we missed -- there was something missed that would have changed that analysis.288

<P> 2. It Was Proper for the White House Counsel's Office to Receive Transcripts of the Depositions Taken by the Inspectors General

<P>On July 23, 1994, Acting Treasury Inspector General Bob Cesca authorized the release of the IGs' deposition transcripts to the White House Counsel's Office.  It has been asserted that the transcripts were improperly disseminated to the White House.  In fact, the release of the transcripts to the White House was entirely proper and appropriate, and it caused no harm to the IGs' investigation or any other inquiry.  
<P><P>a.  The White House had a legitimate and pressing need for the deposition transcripts

<P>As noted previously, OGE's investigation was one of five concurrent inquiries regarding the White House/Treasury contacts.  In particular, while the IGs were investigating the conduct of Treasury and RTC officials, White House Special Counsel Lloyd Cutler was conducting an internal inquiry into the conduct of White House officials at the request of Chief of Staff Mack McLarty.  Like Secretary Bentsen, Cutler needed the information contained in the IGs' deposition transcripts to complete his investigation.  Also, Cutler was scheduled to testify before the House Banking Committee on July 26, 1994 and the Senate Banking Committee shortly thereafter.  Cutler had an obligation to ensure that his testimony was based on complete and accurate information.
<P>Cutler's need for complete and accurate information created a conundrum.  Plainly, he could not complete his investigation without taking steps to determine what the Treasury officials who engaged in the White House/Treasury contacts had to say about them.  But Cutler was concerned that a White House effort to interview non-White House officials could be construed as an attempt to influence their testimony.289  Steven Switzer, the RTC's Deputy Inspector General, characterized Cutler's concern as "reasonable" and noted that Cutler was in a "tough situation."290  Assistant RTC Inspector General Clark Blight agreed that Cutler was in "a difficult situation" due to the time pressures imposed by Congress.291
<P>To resolve this dilemma, Cutler agreed with Secretary Bentsen that his investigators would not interview Treasury or RTC employees, but would receive their deposition transcripts for review.292  Although Cutler considered this an imperfect solution -- he would have preferred to conduct his own interviews -- he agreed to it to protect the integrity of OGE's investigation.  The arrangement between Secretary Bentsen and Special Counsel Cutler was no secret.  On June 30, 1994, before OGE's investigation even began, Cutler stated in a White House briefing that "we will be coordinating with the Treasury inspector general with respect to interviews and exchanges of factual information on the Treasury side and the White House side."293  On July 26, 1994, when Cutler testified before the House Banking Committee, he stated plainly that he had seen the IG deposition transcripts.  Cutler made no effort to conceal that fact; on the contrary, he volunteered the information.294  Cutler's openness refutes any implication that the transcripts were procured or used wrongfully.  
<P>Nearly two years ago, during Cutler's testimony to the Senate Banking Committee, Chairman D'Amato concluded that it was appropriate for the White House to receive the deposition transcripts for use in Cutler's investigation.  Senator D'Amato stated:  
<P>Mr. Chairman, if I might make a point.  I have to tell you, I understand sending the depositions over to Mr. Cutler.  I think that is a closed question.  But I think reasonable people could say, well you know he is conducting an investigation of his own, et cetera, so should he not have that information?295
<P>
Nothing the Committee has learned in the intervening period conflicts with Senator D'Amato's conclusion.  On the contrary, the evidence confirms the propriety of the White House's receiving the transcripts.  
<P>The Committee learned, for example, that OGE encouraged Cutler to review the transcripts.  Jane Ley, OGE's Deputy General Counsel, advised White House Associate Special Counsel Jane Sherburne that the White House had a "responsibility" to investigate the White House/Treasury contacts, and should read the transcripts in order to do a proper job in the White House's internal investigation.296  Ley recounted that:
<P>I simply said to them that if they were conducting their own investigation of their own employees' conduct, they ought to at least read their own employees' transcripts.
<P>
Moreover, Ley stated that Cutler "certainly" should have obtained unredacted deposition transcripts, at least for White House employees.297  She explained that the transcripts are "a source of information of statements made by their own employees about their own actions, and they ought to know that."298  
<P>Nor was OGE alone in its view that the White House acted properly in seeking the deposition transcripts.  Acting Treasury IG Robert Cesca -- who approved the release of the transcripts -- testified that he continued to believe that the release was appropriate.299  So did Francine Kerner, Counsel to the Treasury IG.300  
<P>Even Inspector General personnel who objected to the release of the depositions acknowledged that the White House acted properly in seeking the transcripts.  For example, RTC IG Jack Adair testified that "I didn't think it was inappropriate [that] they were asking [for the deposition transcripts] . . . ."301  Treasury Assistant Inspector General Cottos stated: "I understood why the White House would ask [for the deposition transcripts], that's never been a question."302  Cottos added that it was reasonable for the White House to assume that the decision to release the transcripts had been approved by the Inspectors General.303
<P>Finally, the Treasury Department's most senior career lawyers testified that the Department had an obligation to cooperate with the White House investigation by providing the deposition transcripts.  In fact, according to Assistant General Counsel Robert McNamara, Treasury Department lawyers believed they had an affirmative obligation to provide Cutler with the transcripts, and were concerned that refusing to release the depositions could be construed as obstructing the White House investigation.304  Ed Knight, the Executive Secretary to Secretary Bentsen, similarly testified that the Department had "no choice" but to provide the transcripts to Cutler in connection with his investigation.305
<P>In sum, the evidence has shown that Secretary Bentsen acted properly in providing the deposition transcripts to Special Counsel Cutler for use in the internal White House review of the White House/Treasury contacts.  
<P><P>b.  There is no evidence that OGE's investigation was affected by the release of the deposition transcripts to the White House

<P>It has been suggested that the release of the transcripts to the White House permitted witnesses to conform their testimony, thus undermining the integrity of the investigation.  However, the assertion that witnesses conformed their testimony is unsupported by evidence.  On the contrary, the evidence demonstrated that witnesses were not permitted to review the testimony of other witnesses, and that no improper use was made of the transcripts.  Moreover, by the time the White House received the transcripts from Treasury on July 23, 1994, all White House witnesses already had been deposed by the IGs.* 
<P>The OGE and IG personnel who conducted the investigation confirmed that the release of the transcripts to the White House had no effect on the inquiry.  First, OGE Director Stephen Potts testified that the release of the transcripts to the White House had no effect on OGE's analysis.
<P>As far as our analysis that we provided to the Secretary, I am positive that it didn't impact on that.  . . .  [I]t wasn't a factor at all in the analysis.306  

Second, the IGs' confirmed that the release of the transcripts had no effect on their investigation.  For example, Clark Blight, the supervisory RTC-IG investigator, testified that the IGs' report was not affected by the release of the transcripts to the White House.307  Similarly, Steven Switzer, the RTC's Deputy Inspector General, testified that the release of the transcripts to the White House on July 23 had no bearing on the IGs' investigation or report.308  Treasury-IG's Cottos testified that he had no reason to believe the transcripts were used to prepare witnesses.  He stated:
<P>[O]ur interviews were already done at that point, so no, that did not affect our interviews.309
<P>
Finally, Pat Black, Counsel to the RTC Inspector General, testified that the results of the IGs' investigation were not affected by the provision of the transcripts to the White House.310  

<P><P>c.  There is no evidence that the White House Counsel's Office used the deposition transcripts or the information contained in the transcripts to influence the congressional testimony of White House officials

<P>When the Treasury Department provided the White House with the deposition transcripts, the White House agreed they would be used to help White House Special Counsel Lloyd Cutler complete his investigation and prepare for his upcoming congressional testimony.311  Questions have been raised whether the White House complied with the terms of this agreement.  In particular, concerns have been raised that the White House Counsel's Office used the deposition transcripts or the information contained in them to influence the congressional testimony of White House officials.  
<P>The evidence has demonstrated that the White House did not make improper use of the transcripts.  The White House used the transcripts solely for the purposes agreed upon -- to help Cutler complete his investigation and prepare accurate and complete testimony for the Congress.  No transcripts were provided to anyone outside Cutler's office.  
<P>As a preliminary matter, OGE began its investigation after Special Counsel Fiske completed his investigation into the White House/Treasury contacts.  Therefore, the witnesses deposed by the IGs already had been questioned on the same subject by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Independent Counsel.  Many of the witnesses also had been deposed by congressional investigators.  As such, witnesses had given two or three sworn statements on the White House/Treasury contacts before they spoke with the IGs' investigators.  This makes it highly unlikely they could have altered their testimony based on a review of the IG depositions, even if they had received them -- which they did not.
<P>  When first asked what use he made of the transcripts, Cutler was clear and concise.  In an August 3, 1994 letter to then-Chairman Riegle, Cutler stated that the transcripts were not shown to any witnesses and were not used to prepare any witnesses for their congressional testimony.  He wrote:  "These transcripts were used by me and my staff to complete my review of these matters and prepare for my congressional testimony.  We did not provide copies to anyone."312  Thus, Cutler's contemporaneous testimony was unequivocal; the agreement was complied with meticulously.
<P>Cutler later created some confusion regarding the use of the transcripts.  The Associated Press reported on May 8, 1995 that "White House attorneys used the depositions to identify contradictory accounts and confront aides just before witnesses were to testify before Congress."313  The report quoted Cutler as saying the following:<P>  
<P>If we found inconsistencies, we would go back to White House officials, and go back over testimony they gave us . . . .  And then we would say we have heard other reports.  I think it was perfectly appropriate to say that this is your testimony to us.  There is conflicting testimony.  Are you sure that's what you said?314

<P>Understandably, the apparent conflict between Cutler's contemporaneous letter and his subsequent interview raised questions regarding the use to which the transcripts were put.  In his testimony to this Committee, Cutler resolved the confusion.  He acknowledged making the statement attributed to him by the Associated Press, but denied using the transcripts as he had stated.  Cutler testified that at the time of the interview -- nine months after the fact -- he had a mistaken recollection as to when the White House received the transcripts and the use made of them.315 
<P>Other White House witnesses supported Cutler's testimony.  Associate Special Counsel Jane Sherburne, Cutler's assistant at the time, confirmed that the transcripts were not shown to any potential witnesses or their counsel.316  So did Sharon Conaway of the White House Counsel's Office, who had physical custody of the transcripts.317
<P>Moreover, the investigators themselves debunked the notion that Cutler made improper use of the deposition transcripts.  Assistant Treasury Inspector General Cottos -- who objected to releasing the transcripts before the IGs rendered their final report -- put this whole issue in perspective.  He testified that:
<P>Nothing has ever been disclosed to me that individuals took advantage of the fact that we released those transcripts.318

Clark Blight, the lead RTC-IG investigator, offered similar testimony.319   And RTC Inspector General Jack Adair stated simply that he had "no reason to believe" that anyone in the White House made improper use of the information contained in the deposition transcripts.320
<P><P>d.<P>The deposition transcripts did not contain material, confidential RTC information

<P>Although the transcripts provided to the White House were later redacted to remove certain information regarding the RTC's underlying investigation, virtually all the information in the transcripts had become public long before the depositions were conveyed to the White House.  The limited information that had not been made public was inconsequential.  
<P>As a preliminary matter, only a tiny fraction of the information contained in the transcripts could possibly be characterized as confidential.  Just 12 of the 27 deposition transcripts were redacted at all.  Those redactions often involved a single word or phrase.  Even the investigators agreed that the redactions involved only a modicum of the total contents of the depositions.  For example, Patricia Black, Counsel to the RTC-IG, testified that the purportedly confidential information represented a "very small amount" of the total information contained in the transcripts, and that "the unredacted material . . . was the vast majority.321  Assistant RTC Inspector General Clark Blight similarly testified that "[n]ot very much" information was redacted.322
<P>Moreover, even the small amount of information that was redacted cannot seriously be characterized as confidential.  All the redacted information concerned the RTC's investigation into Madison Guaranty, in particular the 1992 and 1993 referrals.  For example, the RTC redacted the exact number of referrals, which can hardly be characterized as a matter of consequence.
<P>Moreover, the contents of the referrals were public long before OGE began its investigation.  In fact, press coverage of the referrals and the RTC's investigation preceded the OGE depositions by at least eight months.  On October 31, 1993, for example, the Washington Post published a front-page article on the RTC's investigation and the contents of the 1992 and 1993 criminal referrals.323  In the ensuing weeks, The Washington Post reported at length on those same subjects.324  The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal also devoted substantial coverage to the RTC's investigation and the referrals.325  Accordingly, by the time the IG depositions were taken, it was common knowledge that the RTC had made criminal referrals against James McDougal and others with respect to Madison Guaranty, and that President and Mrs. Clinton had been named as possible witnesses.
<P>Thus, despite the fact that certain limited information about the referrals had not been formally released by the RTC, Treasury-IG officials testified that the transcripts did not contain information that was truly confidential.  For example, Francine Kerner, Counsel to the Treasury Inspector General, characterized the redactions as "ludicrous," because all the information in the transcripts already had been reported in the press.326  Acting Treasury Inspector General Bob Cesca similarly stated that the transcripts did not contain any non-public information because everything in the transcripts already had been reported in the press.327  
<P>Even RTC-IG officials -- who opposed the release of unredacted transcripts -- confirmed that the information later redacted was widely known.  For example, Patricia Black testified that the subsequent redactions involved information which had been widely reported in the press -- such as the total number of referrals -- but had not been officially confirmed by the RTC.328  The redactions also included information that had been the subject of substantial "public speculation."329  Finally, Black acknowledged that the widespread dissemination of information prevents an agency from asserting confidentiality:
<P>there comes a point at which, even if a release has not been authorized or confirmed by the agency, that something comes to be so far in the public domain that you will not -- one will not be able to withhold it any longer under FOIA, even as a discretionary matter.330

<P>In light of the foregoing, it is plain that the deposition transcripts did not contain material confidential information.
<P><P>e.  Conclusion
<P>The record is clear that OGE's investigation and the inquiries conducted by the House and Senate Banking Committees were unaffected by the release of the IG deposition transcripts to the White House on July 23, 1994.  Nor was the RTC's underlying investigation into Madison Guaranty affected.  Former RTC General Counsel Ellen Kulka -- who subsequently caused the transcripts to be redacted -- testified that the transmittal of unredacted transcripts to the White House Counsel's Office did no harm.  In particular, Kulka stated that the release of the unredacted transcripts to the White House had no "significant practical effect" on the RTC's investigation.331
y  In the end, then, there is no evidence that any harm resulted from the release of the deposition transcripts.  On the contrary, the record showed that the White House had a legitimate and pressing need for the transcripts and that it was entirely proper and appropriate for the White House to receive them.
<P> 3.  The Treasury Department Did Not Exert Undue Influence On OGE's investigation  
 
<P><P>a.  It was proper for Secretary Bentsen and his representatives to receive a draft version of the IGs' report and the deposition transcripts

<P>Questions have been raised regarding the provision of the deposition transcripts and the draft IG report to Treasury Department officials.  The record demonstrates that Secretary Bentsen had a legitimate and pressing need for the information contained in the depositions and report, and that the officials who received the report were acting on behalf of Secretary Bentsen.  Thus, it was appropriate for Secretary Bentsen's representatives to receive the transcripts and the draft IG report.
<P>As a preliminary matter, the premise that the deposition transcripts and draft report were provided to Treasury's Office of General Counsel ("OGC") is misleading.  Although Assistant General Counsel Ken Schmalzbach and Deputy Assistant General Counsel Stephen McHale formally were employed by OGC, they did not function as OGC lawyers in connection with the OGE investigation.  Rather, they acted as the personal representatives of Secretary Bentsen.332  Secretary Bentsen plainly had the right and responsibility to seek legal assistance in such a complicated and serious matter.  However, he could not turn to Treasury's General Counsel Jean Hanson or Deputy General Counsel Dennis Foreman because they were involved in the White House/Treasury contacts.  Schmalzbach and McHale were the Treasury's most senior career ethics officers, and were completely removed from the events under investigation.333  Thus, it was entirely logical and appropriate for them to assist Secretary Bentsen.*
<P>The substance of the concern is equally spurious.  It is undisputed that the OGE investigation was undertaken at Secretary Bentsen's request.334  The investigators clearly understood that Secretary Bentsen was "the end user" of their investigative product; there was never any question that Secretary Bentsen would receive the deposition transcripts and the IGs' report.335  Moreover, Secretary Bentsen made it clear from the outset that he needed the IGs' report before he testified at congressional hearings on the White House/Treasury contacts.336  Those hearings commenced on July 26, 1994.
<P>Secretary Bentsen had an obligation to provide complete and accurate testimony to Congress.  He also needed the information contained in the transcripts and draft report to make personnel decisions and to determine whether Treasury's policies or practices should be modified.337  As discussed previously, OGE and the Inspectors General were the only possible source of information concerning the White House/Treasury contacts.338  Moreover, for reasons entirely outside his control, OGE had postponed its efforts for four months after Secretary Bentsen's request for their assistance.  Thus, Secretary Bentsen could not countenance any further delay; he had no choice but to seek the information in the transcripts and draft report.
<P>Finally, both Inspectors General considered it was appropriate for Secretary Bentsen to receive the deposition transcripts and the draft IGs' report.  In this regard, Acting Treasury Inspector General Robert Cesca testified that it was "important" and "proper" to provide Secretary Bentsen with the draft report.339  Jack Adair, the RTC Inspector General agreed that it was appropriate for Secretary Bentsen to receive the transcripts and draft report.  In particular, Adair noted that the CEO of the RTC receives all draft and final reports prepared by the IG's Office, and may be briefed regarding ongoing investigations.  Adair agreed that the transmittal of the draft report to Bentsen was analogous to the procedures that were routinely followed by his office.340  
<P><P>b.  No harm resulted from the release of the deposition transcripts and draft report to the Treasury Department 

<P>As a preliminary matter, there is no evidence that any improper use was made of the draft IGs' report or the deposition transcripts.  On the contrary, Ken Schmalzbach, Robert McNamara, Stephen McHale and Ed Knight -- the Treasury officials who reviewed the deposition transcripts and draft IGs' report for Secretary Bentsen -- uniformly testified that they did not share the deposition transcripts with other witnesses.341  
<P>Nor is there any evidence that the release of the transcripts and the draft report to Secretary Bentsen affected the IGs' report or OGE's analysis.  First, with respect to the IGs' report, James Cottos noted that the IGs completed their investigation before Secretary Bentsen received the draft report.  Cottos added that the report "substantively" was finished when Secretary Bentsen received the draft and that the only changes thereafter were "wordsmithing" and "minor."342  Similarly, RTC-IG Counsel Patricia Black concluded that: "I do not believe that the way things worked out, that the provision of the draft to Mr. Bentsen had any impact."343  Second, with respect to OGE's analysis, OGE Director Potts was even more definitive that conveyance of the draft report to Secretary Bentsen had no importance.  He stated:  "As far as our analysis that we provided to the Secretary, I'm positive that it didn't impact on that."344
<P>Therefore, the record is clear that no harm resulted from the release of the deposition transcripts and draft report to the Treasury Department. 
<P><P>c.  Francine Kerner's participation in the investigation was proper and appropriate

<P>The majority has suggested that the IGs' investigation was tainted by the participation of Francine Kerner, Counsel to the Treasury Inspector General.345  As a general proposition, the majority complains that Kerner had a conflict of interest because she was formally employed by Treasury's Office of General Counsel, and General Counsel Jean Hanson was involved in the White House/Treasury contacts.346  The charge also has been made that Kerner sought to protect her superiors from a probing inquiry.  Neither charge is supported by the evidence.  On the contrary, the evidence shows that Kerner's participation in the investigation was entirely proper and appropriate.  
<P>The criticism of Treasury's arrangement -- wherein the IG Counsel is formally employed by OGC -- is specious.  As a preliminary matter, the arrangement is a common one.  The Departments of Defense and Health and Human Services and the Environmental Protection Agency employ similar structures.347  Pat Black, who criticized the arrangement, served under an analogous arrangement at the Department of Housing and Urban Development before joining the RTC.  Moreover, Kerner took extraordinary steps to prevent any problems that might arise out of her dual reporting relationship.  From the time she arrived at the Treasury, Kerner sought a memorandum of understanding guaranteeing her independence.348  In addition, on June 27, 1994 -- before the OGE investigation began -- Kerner procured a memorandum from General Counsel Hanson removing her from OGC's chain of command for the purposes of the OGE investigation.349  
<P>Moreover, the majority's criticisms are old hat, and were resolved long ago.  From the outset of the investigation, Acting Treasury IG Cesca -- Kerner's supervisor and client -- was aware of her employment situation.  Yet he had no concerns about her loyalty, professionalism or performance.350  OGE reached the same conclusion shortly after the investigation when Congressman Charles Canady raised the issue in a July 1994 letter to OGE Director Stephen Potts.  Potts responded in an August 4, 1994 letter that OGE had no problem with Kerner's participation in the investigation.351  More recently, Potts added that OGE's views had not changed; OGE "had no reason to have a problem" with Kerner's role.352
<P> 4.  Roger Altman Did Not Receive a Transcript of Harold Ickes' Deposition Prior to his Senate Banking Committee Testimony on August 2, 1994

<P>In a Senate Banking Committee deposition taken on July 24, 1994, Harold Ickes discussed a White House-Treasury meeting on February 2, 1994 attended by Roger Altman and Jean Hanson from Treasury and Ickes, Bernard Nussbaum, Neil Eggleston and Margaret Williams from the White House.  The meeting concerned the RTC's inquiry "as to whether there was a basis for a civil claim against persons or parties involved in Whitewater/Madison."353  According to Ickes, Altman indicated that the statute of limitations on such claims was about to expire, and said "at least in so many words, that it was his understanding that the investigation probably would not be concluded and that a determination could not be made by the RTC's general counsel as to whether there was a basis for a civil claim until after the expiration of the statute of limitations had applied to that particular investigation."354  
<P>At the time Ickes made the foregoing statements, he was not permitted to consult his contemporaneous notes from the meeting.  Instead, he was urged to "guess" what Altman may have said.355  Significantly, no one else who attended the February 2, 1994 meeting recalled Altman indicating that the RTC would not be able to act before the statute of limitations expired on February 28, 1994.  Moreover, Altman's talking points from the meeting are inconsistent with Ickes' testimony.356
<P>On August 2, 1994, Altman told the Committee that he believed Ickes had provided an inaccurate recollection of the February 2, 1994 meeting.  "I believe, and you can ask Mr. Ickes yourself when he appears before you, that he did not intend to say I had told the White House the investigation could not be concluded by February 28."357  Altman further testified that he had not seen a copy of Ickes' deposition.358  
<P>The following day, on August 3, 1994, during Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen's testimony before the Senate Banking Committee, Senator D'Amato stated that Deputy Secretary Roger Altman had testified that he read White House Deputy Chief of Staff Harold Ickes' Senate Banking Committee deposition prior to his own congressional testimony.  In particular, Senator D'Amato stated:  "We are asking Mr. -- and we only found out about this because we are asking Mr. Altman questions, and the next thing you know he says, oh, that is not what Mr. Ickes said.  How do you know that?  Oh, I read his deposition.  He's got his deposition there."359   
<P>Senator D'Amato was mistaken.  As noted above, Altman clearly testified that he did not review Ickes' deposition.  Moreover, the testimony of the other witnesses who appeared before the Committee is uniform; witnesses -- including Altman -- were not shown the transcripts of other witnesses.
<P>Ironically, Senator D'Amato may have been the source of the information that he inaccurately asserted Altman learned from Ickes' deposition transcript.  On July 30 1994, -- before Altman testified before the Senate Banking Committee -- the Los Angeles Times reported that:  
<P>"Citing a deposition by White House Deputy Chief of Staff Harold M. Ickes as his source [Senator] D'Amato said that Altman had told a White House meeting that the RTC would not be able to complete its Madison Guaranty inquiry before the expiration of a deadline for filing civil claims at the end of February."360  
<P>
It is not clear whether Altman read the Los Angeles Times article; however, it is clear that the substance of Ickes's deposition testimony was public several days before Altman testified.  Thus, there is no reason to believe that Altman saw Ickes' deposition transcript before his congressional appearance.
