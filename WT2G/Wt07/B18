<b>1.  PROJECT SUMMARY:</b><br>

<br>The <i><b>Utah State Hospital</i></b> is seeking proposals from interested energy services companies
that are capable of completing energy-related capital improvement services.  The <i><b>Utah State
Hospital</i> </b>has retained the services of Heath Engineering, Inc. to complete the following: initial
technical energy audits, define the scope of work under this request for proposal, evaluate
proposals submitted, approve changes in scope of work and substitutions, inspect work
completed and independently evaluate savings achievements.<br>

<br><i><b>Utah State Hospital</i></b> is interested in contracting for installation of the energy conservation
measures listed in Attachment A (including any annual maintenance and monitoring fees for the
duration of the contract term) to be financed through the energy service company on a
performance-based contract where a level of annual energy cost savings is guaranteed over a
repayment period.  The amount to be financed will be bought-down using any funds awarded to
the <i><b>Utah State Hospital</i></b> through the U.S. Department of Energy's Institutional Conservation
Program.  <br>

<br>Services to be provided by the energy service company may include but are not limited to:
acquisition, installation, and modification of equipment per the scope of work outlined in
Attachment A.  The energy service company may also recommend additional measures, practices
and changes of scope of work to Heath Engineering to further reduce energy consumption
associated with the heating, ventilation and air conditioning system, the lighting system, building
envelope, the domestic hot water system, and other energy using devices.  The company shall also
provide training to Utah State Hospital staff in maintenance and operation of the equipment for
optimum energy efficiency.  The energy service company is also encouraged to provide
recommendations that may not reduce consumption per se but are aimed at cost savings, such as
fuel switching or demand reductions.  <br>

<br>The terms of the contract shall be at least _____ years and not more than ______ years in
duration and is subject to board approval and review by the Project Evaluation Team: <i><b>Utah State
Hospital</i></b>, Heath Engineering, Utah Division of State Purchasing, Utah Division of Facilities
Construction and Management, and the Utah Division of Energy.  <br>
<br>

<b><center>Energy Service Company's Qualifications and Approach to Project</b></center>
<br>
<center>(To be completed by Energy Service Company)</center>
<br>
<dd>Please provide answers to each category listed below.  Provide your responses on 8-1/2" x 11" sheets of paper and
number and title each answer to the corresponding category.  All pages in your response to this attachment should be
sequentially numbered. <br>

<dd>1.<b> Project Summary (not to exceed 5 pages)</b>:  Please summarize the scope of
services (additional engineering study, design, financial, operations, maintenance,
training, etc.) that would be offered by your firm for this project.  Please include a
brief description of your firm's approach to project management and the specific
benefits to <i><b>Utah State Hospital</b></i>.<br>

<dd>2.<b> Training Provisions for Equipment Installed</b>:  Please describe your firm's
capabilities and experience in providing technical training for facility personnel on
past projects.<br>

<dd>3.<b> Design</b>:  Please describe your firm's design approach to the project scope of work
for this project as prepared by Heath Engineering. <br>

<dd>4.<b> Calculation Methodology</b>:  Please describe in detail the methodology used to
compute baseline energy use.  Where an independent technical energy audit has
recently been completed, ESCOs are encouraged to use the baseline contained in
the technical audit.<br>

<dd>5.<b> Adjustment in Baseline Methodology</b>:  Please describe the method or methods
used to adjust the baseline due to such factors as weather and facility use changes.<br>

<dd>6.<b> Procedure for Measuring Energy Savings</b>:  Please list all procedures, formulas
and methodologies including any special metering or equipment, your firm will use
on an ongoing basis to measuring energy savings.  Proposers are encouraged to
use the "North American Energy Measurement and Verification Protocol" to verify
baseline conditions and verify savings from energy saving equipment (as
developed by the National Association of Energy Service Companies).<br>

<dd>7.<b> Methodology to Assign Dollar Value to Savings</b>:  Please describe the procedure
to assign dollar values to the measured energy savings.  Utilize appropriate rate
schedules and marginal costs.<br>

<dd>8.<b> Savings Guarantee Provisions</b>:  The guarantee must extend during the complete
term of the contract. Please describe your schedule for measuring the project's
financial performance and how the guarantee provisions work in the event that
project results vary from the projections (i.e.: where no savings occurs, the firm
shall provide a cash refund to the institution equal to the difference between actual
and projected savings and/or the payback period of the contract will be extended
to allow for full payback from savings).  <br>

<dd>9.<b> Project Billing and Invoice</b>:  Please describe your firm's standard billing
procedures and attach a sample project invoice.<br>

<dd>10.<b> Provision of Financing</b>:  Please briefly describe the types of "innovative"
financing arrangements provided through your firm for past retrofit projects.<br>

<dd>11.<b> Equipment Ownership and Service Responsibility</b>:  Please describe the status
of equipment ownership and service responsibility during the contract period and
at contract expiration.  Describe who will warranty workmanship and equipment
installed and the terms, conditions, and period of warranty.  List how far your
closest service representative is to the project sites.<br>

<dd>12.<b> Sample Contract</b>:  Please attach a sample contract offered by your firm.<br>

<dd>13.<b> General Operations and Maintenance</b>:  Describe your firm's operations and
maintenance training program for building operators and any maintenance to be
provided by your firm to guarantee energy savings.  Please describe any major
changes in operation or maintenance for the facility that your company foresees
based on the information provided.<br>

<dd>14.<b> Technical Site Analysis</b>:  Based on your preliminary assessment of the
information and scope of work prepared by Heath Engineering, please describe any
additional equipment modifications, installations or replacements that your
company would recommend as a part of this project.<br>

<dd>15.<b> Project Financing</b>:  Please describe your firm's preferred approach to providing
or arranging financing for this project and any special conditions associated with
this method.  Provide a schedule of the amount and frequency of repayments by
the <i><b>Utah State Hospital</i></b> compared to the net savings guaranteed. <br>

<dd>16.<b> Economics of Financing</b>:  Provide the net present value to the <i><b>Utah State
Hospital</i></b> for all energy conservation measures to be installed over the term of this
contract.  For the net present value include a description of all assumptions, costs,
and methodologies utilized in the calculation.  Include any buy-down of initial
project costs utilizing other funding sources such as the Institutional Conservation
Program.  (See attached Financial Spreadsheet.)<br>

<dd>17.<b> Arbitration</b>:  Describe the method and procedures of arbitration for negotiating
problems once the contract between the energy service company and <i><b>Utah State
Hospital</b></i> has been executed.<br>

<br>

<center><b>Financial Spreadsheet</b>
</center>
<center>(To be completed by Energy Service Company)</center>
<br>

<dd>For calculating the net present value (NPV) of your proposal, the following formula and assumptions will be used:<br>
<dd>NPV = [(Sum of YEARLY CASH FLOW for Years 1 to i) x (discount factors for 	each year)] - (total installed project costs) - (total financing charges for years 1 to i) 
where i = last year of contract term (not to be less than ___ years or more than ____ years)<br>

<br>
<b>ASSUMPTIONS</b>:<br>

<dd>Yearly cash flow is calculated by determining annual energy savings for years 1 to 10
(utilizing an annual energy price escalation figure of 5 percent) less the annual costs for
repayment to the ESCO, any maintenance and all general replacement costs (filters, lamps,
etc.) provided by the ESCO, and any annual maintenance and replacement costs to be
performed or incurred directly by the institution.<br>

<dd>Based upon a discount rate of 6 percent per year, please use the following discount factors:<br>
<center>
<table border width=50% cellpadding=5>
<tr><td>Year  1  =  .9434<td>Year  6  =  .7050
<tr><td>Year  2  =  .8900<td>Year  7  =  .6651
<tr><td>Year  3  =  .8396<td>Year  8  =  .6274
<tr><td>Year  4  =  .7921<td>Year  9  =  .5919
<tr><td>Year  5  =  .7473<td>Year 10  =  .5584
</table></center>
<br>
<dd>Assume no salvage value at the end of the contract.<br>

<dd>The total installed project costs should include all equipment, parts, labor, transportation and
overhead costs incurred by the vendor.  Project costs should be broken out separately for
each building and for each energy conservation measure.  This should be included as an
attachment to the Financial Spreadsheet.  Other funding from outside sources (such as grants,
rebates, etc.) should be applied to cover certain initial project costs.  For performance-based
financing of the remaining costs over the terms of the contract, these payments to the ESCO
shall be included in the yearly cash flow.<br>

<center><b>Final Ranking and Evaluation Form</b></center>
<center>(to be used by <b>Utah State Hospital's</b> Project Evaluation Team</center>
<center>in evaluating projects submitted under this Request for Proposal)</center>
<br>

<dd>The establishment, application and interpretation of the evaluation criteria shall be solely within the discretion of <b>Utah State Hospital</b> which reserves
the right to reject any and all submissions.  Scoring for the listed criteria will be determined during the evaluation of the following: written submissions of energy
service company qualifications, interviews with previous energy service company clients, and the responses of energy service companies during selection interviews. 
A total of 300 points will be used in evaluating each energy service company.<br>

<dd>Refer to the ESCOs Profile Form (Attachment D), Qualifications and Approach to Project (Attachment E), the oral interview, and client references. 
First, score each firm based upon the written responses and total all points to select three firms for the oral interview.  After, this initial ranking, use this form during
the oral interview.  During the oral interview, scores from the written responses can be changed as the written responses are confirmed and clarified.  After the oral
interview, re-total the scores for the three firms interviewed, and make a final selection.<br>

<br>

Dear XXXX.<br>

<dd>Your firm has been selected as a finalist in the procurement process being conducted by
the <b><i>Utah State Hospital</i></b> for an energy service company.<br>

<dd>The oral format has been chosen to preserve the integrity of each energy service
company's proposal.  It is anticipated that this competitive format will encourage energy service
companies to fully disclose their unique solutions for the facility.  You should be prepared to
discuss your estimate of the range of energy and demand savings available in the facility and the
basis for your estimates.  Proposing companies are also asked to discuss the range of gross annual
utility cost savings available in the facility and the basis for your estimates.<br>

<dd>Oral presentations/interviews will be held on _______________, 199___ in the
_____________________ conference room at ________________________________ (the exact
time of your presentation).  If you still have questions about the time of your session, please
contact ________________________________ at (___)_________________.  Please
inform__________________________________by _______________________, 199__, if you
will have any special requirements regarding presentation media such as slide projector, overhead
projector, screen, video tape machine, easel, etc.  Also, please let us know the expected number
of people in your party.<br>

<dd>Companies will be limited to no more than a 15-minute presentation of their qualifications
and approach to the proposed project which should include:  design considerations, construction,
financing, training, O&amp;M services, performance monitoring, and performance enhancement.  A
detailed description of the responsibilities assigned to each member of your project team over the
life of the project is requested.  <br>

<dd>The remaining one hour of this interview will be used to ask specific questions which will
include but not be limited to the topics outlined below.  You will be asked to respond to questions
posed by the project evaluation team during this portion of the interview process.  You will not be
required to prepare formal response in advance:<br>

<ul>
1. Accuracy of predicted performance on past projects installed or managed by your firm.  Ability to complete
construction on schedule. <br>
<br>
2. Methodology you use to measure project savings, measure performance, and assign dollar values to savings
over the term of the contract.  Method of project invoicing.<br>
<br>
3. Proposed arrangements for equipment service and maintenance provisions over the contract term.<br>
<br>
4. Terms of the guarantee offered to insure the project's financial performance.<br>
<br>
5. Your firm's preferred approach to project financing.<br>
<br>
6. Key provisions and flexibility of legal agreement submitted.<br>
<br>
7. Technical measures from the scope of work identified by Heath Engineering likely to be included in a
contract, other measures that merit more study and alternates to measures proposed in the scope of work.<br>
<br>
8. Site specific operational and maintenance changes proposed.<br>
<br>
9. Estimated range of energy and demand savings available and the basis for those estimates.<br>
<br>
10. Estimated range of gross annual utility cost savings available and the basis for those estimates.<br>
<br>
11. Specific methods of equipment and performance monitoring.<br>
<br>
</ul>
Thank you for your interest.<br>
<br>

<br>

<dd>Sincerely,<br>

<br>
<h2>SELECTION PROCEDURE</h2><br>

In 1979 the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America established a procedure for selecting illuminance, based
upon factors important to visual performance.  This illuminance selection procedure is flexible in that it provides the
designer with an opportunity to tailor the illuminance to a specific set of conditions.  Such flexibility requires the
designer to assess the following factors:<br>

<br><center>
<table border width=85% cellpadding=5>
<tr><td>1.
<td><i>Type of activity within a space.  </i>Activities are considered in the illuminance selection procedure as
having varying degrees of emphasis on visual performance.<tr><td>2.
<td><i>Characteristics of the visual task.</i>  Target contrast and size as well as the time allowed to perform the
visual task are important.<tr><td>3.
<td><i>Age of the occupant.</i>  As one ages, it is more difficult to see.<tr><td>4.
<td><i>Importance of visual performance in terms of speed and accuracy.</i>  How quickly and accurately one
can see are the main visual performance criteria in the procedure.<tr><td>5.
<td><i>Reflectance.</i>  People see brightness, which is affected by room and task surface reflectance as well as
the illuminance.  Therefore, the reflectance of the task surface is important.</table>
</center>
<br>

Consideration of these factors has been systematized into the following four steps, which can be executed by using
figures 11-1 and 11-2.<br>

<h3>Step 1: Define the Visual Task</h3>

Determine the type of activity for which the illuminance is being selected (for example, reading typed originals).  At the
same time, establish the plane in which the visual task will be performed (work plane).  Document the visual task and
the work plane as part of the illuminance selection procedure.<br>

<h3>Step 2: Select the Illuminance Category</h3>

Nine Illuminance categories have been established by the IESNA, which are patterned after those in CIE Report No. 29.(2) They are designated A through I and cover illuminance from 20 to 20,000 1x (2 to 2000 fc).  Each of
these nine categories is associated with a range of three target illuminance; the categories and the target illuminance are
shown in part I of figure 11-1.  The application committees of the IESNA have either adopted these categories by listing different types of areas
and activities as intended in parts II and III of figure 11-1, or have provided a different set of illuminance
recommendations, which may be found in the appropriate chapters of this Handbook.<br>

<dd>Following step 1, where the visual task has been defined, refer to parts II and III of figure 11-1 for the closest
corresponding description of the "area/activity."  If no satisfactory description can be found in parts II or III, refer to the
first column labeled "Type of Activity" in part I of figure 11-1 for a generic description of the visual task.<br>

<h3>Step 3: Determine the Illuminance Range</h3>

Every illuminance category has a corresponding range of three target illuminance , listed in lux and in foot-candles.

<dd>Due to the nature of the activities listed in categories A through C, general lighting is required over the entire
area of the interior space considered.  For instance, in a lobby area one visual task is walking through the lobby.  The
visual task is to circulate through a space containing large, high-contrast objects; therefore, a low level of general
illumination should be selected for the entire lobby.

<dd>Categories D through F, however, are for tasks which remain fixed at one location, and where visual performance
is a more critical consideration.  From location to location, tasks may also vary considerably.  For example, and
accounting office may have a secretarial pool were reading notes handwritten in felt-tipped pen and proofreading typed
originals are prominent tasks, while at the same time accountants in another location may be reading low-contrast
computer printouts.  Each task calls for a particular illuminance for satisfactory visual performance, and so each task
should be lighted accordingly.  Therefore, categories D through F should be applied only to the appropriate task
area.<br>

<br><b>Fig. 11-1.  </b>Currently Recommended Illuminance Categories and Illuminance Values for Lighting Design 
Targeted Maintained Levels</center>
<br>

<dd>The following table is a consolidated listing of the IESNA's current illuminance recommendations.  This listing is intended to guide
the designer in selecting an appropriate illuminance.

<dd>Guidance is provided in two forms: (1), in Parts I, II and III as an Illuminance Category, representing a range of illuminance;
and (2), in Parts IV, V and VI as an Illuminance Value.  Illuminance categories are represented by letter designations A through I. 
Illuminance Values are given in lux with equivalents in foot candles and as such are intended as target values also represent
maintained values.

<dd>This table has been divided into six parts for ease of use.  Part I lists both Illuminance Categories and Illuminance Values for
generic types of interior activities and normally is to be used when Illuminance Categories for a specific Area/Activity cannot be found
in Parts II and III.  Parts IV, V and VI provide target maintained Illuminance Values for outdoor facilities, sports and recreational
areas, and transportation vehicles where special considerations apply as discussed.

<dd>In all cases the recommendations in this table are based on the assumption that the lighting will be properly designed to take
into account the visual characteristics of the task.

<dd>Categories G through I are for extremely difficult visual tasks, and may be difficult to illuminate.  For practical
and economic reasons, lighting systems for these tasks will visually require a combination of general overall illumination
and higher task illuminance.  Because of the unusual conditions associated with tasks in these categories, very careful
analysis is recommended.<br>

<dd>Step 4: Establish Target Illuminance<br>

<dd>Target illuminance are established somewhat differently for categories A through C than for categories D through I,
based upon the series of weighting factors shown in figure 11-2.<br>

<dd>Categories A Through C.  To establish an appropriate target illuminance the designer should be familiar with the
interior design and with the characteristics of the intended occupants to the extent that room surface reflectance, form 0
to 1, and occupant ages, in years, can be correctly specified.  From this information, the designer can determine the
appropriate weighting factors for the application form figure 11-2a and the following three steps:<br>

<dd><i>Step 4.A.1.  </i>From the occupants' ages and the room surface reflectance, determine both of the weighting factors
(-1, ), +1).<br>

<dd><i>Step 4.A.2.  </i>Add the two weighting factors together.<br>

<dd><i>Step 4.A.3.  </i>If the sum of the two weighting factors is -2, use the lowest of the three illuminance in the range; if
+2, use the highest; if -1, 0 or +1, use the middle illuminance.<br>

<dd>Categories D Through I.  To establish an appropriate target illuminance, the designer should be familiar with some
further characteristics of the task than those considered in step 1.  The background reflectance of the task, form 0 to
100%, is important in illuminance selection.  In addition, the designer should be able to specify the workers' ages and ,
with the client, the importance of speed and accuracy for the performance of the task.  From this information the designer
can determine the appropriate weighting factors for the application from figure 11-2b.<br>

<dd><i>Step 4.B.1.  </i>Given that the appropriate illuminance category has been selected, determine each of the three
weighting factors (-1, 0, +1), one each for the workers' ages, the importance of speed and accuracy, and the reflectance
of the task background.<br>

<dd><i>Step 4.B.2.</i>  Add the three weighting factors together.<br>

<dd><i>Step 4.B.3.  </i>If the sum of the three weighting factors is -2 or -3, use the lowest of the three illuminance in the
range; if +2 or +3, use the highest; if -1, 0 or +1, use the middle illuminance.<br>

<dd>A simpler version of steps 3 and 4 is given in figure 11.2.  This figure should be used only if the bases for steps 3 and 4
are clearly understood.<br>

surround.  For instance, in an elevator lobby, where the ceiling height is 7.6 meters [25 feet ], neither the task nor the visual surround encompass
the ceiling, so only the floor and wall reflectance would be considered<br>

1In determining whether speed and/or accuracy is not important, important or critical, the following questions need to be answered: What are the
time limitations?  How important is it to perform the task rapidly?  Will errors produce an unsafe condition or product?  Will errors reduce
productivity and be costly?  For example, in reading for leisure there are no time limitations and it is not important to read rapidly.  Errors will not
be costly and will not be related to safety.  Thus, speed and/or accuracy is not important.  If however, a worker is involved in exacting work,
accuracy is critical because of the close tolerances, and time is important because of production demands.<br>

2The task background is that portion of the task upon which the meaningful visual display is exhibited.  For example, on this page the meaningful
visual display includes each letter which combines with other letters to form words and phrases.  The display medium, or task background, is the
paper, which has a reflectance of approximately 85 percent.</table>
</center>

<b>Example</b><br>

A classroom in a high school is to be relighted.  The designer, in consultation with the teacher and school administrators,
has determined the following:
<ul>
	1.	The task is reading photocopied material with a reflectance of about 80% on a horizontal desk
surface.<br>

	2.	The students are teenagers.<br>

	3.	The students practice typing to improve speed and accuracy; thus speed and accuracy are considered
to be important, but not critical.<br>
</ul>
Using the above step-by-step procedure:

<ul>

	<i>Step1.  </i>The visual task and the work plane are defined above.<br>

	<i>Step2.</i> Referring to figure 11-1, the illuminance category D is found under "Reading, Photocopies" in the table.<br>

	<i>Step3.  </i>Referring to part I of figure 11-1, the illuminance range is found to be 200-300-500 1x (20-30-50 fc).<br>

	<i>Step4.  </i>Referring to figure 11-2b and the above information, the weighting factors selected are -1 for age; 0 for
speed and accuracy; -1 for reflectance of task background.  The sum of the weighting factors is -2.  Therefore,
the illuminance to be selected is the lowest value, 200 1x (20fc).
</ul>

<dd>If the task were reading no. 3 pencil handwriting on 80% reflectance paper and the students were older (as in an adult
education course), the illuminance category would change to E, and the illuminance range would become 500-750-1000
1x (50-75-100 fc).  The weighting factor for age would be 0; the importance of speed and accuracy and the background
reflectance would remain as before.  The new sum of the weighting factors would be -1.  Therefore, the illuminance to
be selected would be the middle value in the new range, that is, 750 1x (75 fc).<br>

<br><b>APPLICATION OF THE PROCEDURE</b>

<br>

Before the selected illuminance is applied, the following issues should be understood by the designer:
<ul>
	1.	The IESNA is recommending a procedure for selecting illuminance rather than an illuminance per
sec.  It is incumbent upon the designer to use the procedure properly and to determine the factors in
each of the four steps accurately.  The ranges of illuminance provided in figure 11-1 should enable the
designer to have the flexibility to work with the client for the best results.<br><br>

	2.	This procedure is intended for use in interior environments where visual performance,1 base upon
speed and accuracy of visual response, is an important consideration.  It is a consensus procedure
which includes illuminance deemed appropriate for given task activities and areas.<br><br>

	3.	The selected illuminance is to be maintained in service, either as the average maintained illuminance
for categories A through C or as the local maintained illuminance for categories D through I.  It is not
the initial illuminance; appropriate light loss factors should be used in calculating the maintained
value.<br><br>

	4.	The selected illuminance, for categories D through I, are specific to a given task.  Where multiple
tasks are performed, either at the same location or at other locations in the same space, different
illuminance may be required.  The designer must work with the client to establish priorities in
selecting a final illuminance.  Where deemed appropriate, multiple illuminance, that is, task tuning,
may be employed in a space.<br><br>

	5.
<ul>	a.	Implicit in the illuminance selection procedure is that the quality of the lighting system has
been considered.  In this context, quality refers to an absence of direct glare and veiling
reflections which will impair visual performance.  For example, the same horizontal
illuminance may be incident on a matte and on a glossy surface, with very different visual
effects.  In the latter case the correct illuminance may have been selected using this
procedure, but veiling reflections may completely obscure the visual task.  In this case,
illuminance is not a reliable indicator of visual performance.<br><br>

		b.	More sophisticated procedures are available which will enable the designer to evaluate the
impact of lighting geometry, polarization and distribution on visual performance.  Equivalent
sphere illuminance (ESI)3,4,5 and relative visual performance (RVP)6,7 take into account the
same visual factors important in the illuminance selection procedure.  To use these
procedures successfully, contrast, size, background reflectance and the age of the worker
must be specified precisely.  Measurement tools and computer and computer programs are
available to the designer to determine values of the ESI and RVP.  Currently, However,
experience with the use of ESI and RVP is insufficient to justify their inclusion in the
IESNA's recommendations.<br><br>
</ul>
6.	Illuminance selections, based upon visual performance, is only one lighting design criterion to be considered. 
There are many applications where other design criteria, such as glare or color rendering, are more important
to a successful lighting design.<br><br>
<ul>
	a.	In Merchandizing, for example, the luminance ratios in the space are more important than absolute
illuminance values; higher relative brightness is more attractive to customers.  Similarly, architectural
details should be highlighted only if the relative brightness of these features is greater than their
surround.<br><br>

	b.	Often light can create artistic effects, as with holiday decorations.  For these applications the
illuminance selection procedure is not relevant.<br><br>

	c.	Minimum illuminance are recommended for safe egress from buildings.  These are not based upon the
speed and accuracy of visual response per sec., but rather upon the need to see obstructions and exit
ways in the space.<br><br>

	d.	In some spaces, such as theater lobbies, occupants must move from bright area to dark areas and vice
versa.  For these spaces speed and accuracy are less important than the transition in brightness
between the two extremes for occupant safety and comfort.<br><br>

	e.	Sometimes photo sensors other than the human eye are important.  animals, plants and even television
cameras have different spectral sensitivities than those of the human eye.  In such cases illuminance,
based upon human spectral sensitivity, is an inappropriate design criterion.<br><br>

	f.	Some materials degrade with exposure to light.  In museums, for example strict exposure criteria are
established to preserve archival specimens.  Here, too, the illuminance selection procedure is an
inappropriate design criterion.<br><br>
</ul>
	The illuminance selection procedure, which is based upon the speed and accuracy of visual response, may often
be less important than the other criteria for a successful lighting design.  For a complete discussion of design criteria, see
chapter 10, Design Process.<br><br>

<dd>Past and present Utah Division f Energy staff made valuable contributions to this project.  Kevin Gillars, Glen Hansen, Britt Reed, oliver Schreiber, Tom Turner and Dana Wilson contributed to the data collection and preparation of this document.  Questions or comments about this publicaiton or wind energy production in Utah should be directed to Tom Turner at the Utah Division of Energy.
<dd>The Utah Division of Energy extends its appreciation to the Western Area Power Administration for supporting this project and providing the wind monitoring equipment.  Special thanks goes to the many government agencies, corporations, municipalities and private land-owners for their cooperation in providing land for installation of equipment and access to monitoring sites.
<hr noshade>
<font size=7><b>I</b></font><font size=5><B>ntroduction</B></font>
<dd>	Wind energy is gaining acceptance worldwide as an important source of electrical power.  Technological advances during the past decade have dramatically increased the wind turbine's efficiency and cost effectiveness.  As a result, today's utility-scale electric generation plants powered by wind produce significant amounts of energy.  The United States now has 1,600 MW of wind-generated power capacity on line.  In 1991, California alone produced 2.7 billion KWH of wind-generated electricity, enough to meet the residential needs of approximately 300,000 people.
	<dd>Wind energy is a promising renewable energy that offers utilities and independent power producers a pollution-free source of electricity that is cost competitive in areas where electricity rates are above average and winds are good.  For years, the wind industry's goal has been to generate power at costs close to those of coal and oil - about six cents per KWH.  Ten years ago, the cost of wind-generated power was four times that price.  Today, wind turbines produce power at about seven cents per KWH.  Current technology could lower that cost to five cents by 1 995, and further technological advances could reduce it to three and a half cents
by 2005.
	<dd>Technological advances have perfected the wind turbine's ability to harness the wind.  Improvements such as aerodynamically efficient blade design and special wind direction sensors that align the machine toward the wind path have increased power output.
	<dd>Other improvements, such as those used in U.S. Windpower, lnc.'s variable-speed wind turbine, correct serious problems that have plagued wind turbines for decades.  Strong gusts of wind frequently damaged earlier wind turbines, placing enormous stress on the drivetrain transmission and blades causing mechanical failures and increasing operating costs.  The variable-speed wind turbine, which increases and decreases speed with wind strength, converts the additional energy produced by gusts into electricity without increasing torque on the drivetrain.  The variable-speed wind turbine, currently being field tested, is scheduled to go into production in early 1993.
 	<dd>Advanced technology is not the only factor driving increased use of wind power.  The removal of institutional barriers and implementation of tax incentives are also nurturing this growing market.  In 1978, Congress passed the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act, which directs utilities to interconnect with independent power producers and purchase their excess electricity at fair market price.
	<dd>To promote wind energy development in Utah, the Utah Division of Energy administers a program that offers state income tax credits of up to $1,500 for residences using alternative energy systems and up to $25,000 for commercial installations.  The tax credits are scheduled to expire in December 1995.
	<dd>While California, with its nearly 18,000 wind turbines, is the world leader in wind energy production, other areas of the nation have favorable wind regimes as well - including Utah.  Throughout the state are numerous locations where wind resources could generate electricity.  The Utah Wind Survey Report serves as a prospector's guide to these areas.  It provides a starting point for further detailed site-specific wind monitoring in order to develop the full potential of this valuable resource.  
	<dd>Research and development during the past decade has pushed back the frontiers of wind energy technology, making it more efficient and cost effective.  Further technological advances will ensure that this reliable, non-polluting energy source will be cost competitive before the end of the century.  With most of the institutional, technological and economic barriers removed, the only obstacle remaining to the widespread use of wind power for electricity generation is our nation's commitment to this important energy source.  Wind power has come of age.

<font size=7><b>W</b></font><font size=5><B>ind Source and Measurement</B></font>
<dd>	The primary cause of wind is solar energy.  Heat from the sun warms the Earth's water and land masses, which in turn warms the air above it.  Warm air from the tropics rises, creating a region of low pressure.  Colder air from the polar regions flows in to replace the warm air, creating dynamic streams of wind.  The Earth's rotation, combined with local weather and landscape conditions shape the wind into a powerful source of energy.
	<dd>The main instrument used in modern wind measurement is the rotating cup anemometer.  In 1930, the three-cup anemometer was adopted as the standard by the National Weather Service.  All data in the Utah Wind Survey Report was recorded with standard three-cup anemometers.  Anyone recording wind velocity data using cup-style anemometers should be aware of the limitations of this method of measuring wind potential.  First, four-cup anemometers typically over-measure the actual wind speed by approximately 24 percent at 100 mph, while modern three-cup anemometers over-measure up to 9 percent.  Secondly, during brief periods of decreasing wind speed, all anemometers continue to rotate at a higher speed than the actual wind velocity.
	<dd>Finally, poorly maintained anemometers require higher starting velocities that adversely affect data collection when wind speeds are less than 10 mph.  Some of the instruments used in this study could respond to speeds as low as 0.5 mph, others required up to a 4.0-mph starting speed.  Some of the data collection sites in this report were in remote locations, making it difficult to ensure the anemometers were maintained in peak operating condition.
<hr noshade>
<font size=7><b>W</b></font><font size=5><B>ind Power Units</B></font>
<dd>	A Wind Power Unit is a theorefical measure of wind energy potential.  A wind power unit is expressed in wafts per meter squared (W/M2) and is a function of air density and wind speed.
	<dd>Theoretical wind power units are calculated by using the equation:
	<CENTER>
<img src="/images/pu.gif" border=0>
</CENTER>
Where:
<ul>	
<b>Pu</b>= Power per unit area (W/M^2) <br>
<b>d</b>= Air density in kilograms per cubic meter (kg/m^3) <br>
<b>v</b>= Wind speed in meters per second<br>
</ul>

	<dd>Values obtained estimatng wind power represent theoretical maximums.  In practice, the maximum power that can be obtained from harnessing a wind source is approximately 16/27 of the theoretical amount.
	<dd>Under normal circumstances, measured wind power for a given wind velocity decreases at higher altitudes.  For every 2,700-foot increase in elevation, the density and energy potential of air decreases about 1 0 percent, in turn decreasing the estimated energy potential.  The standard sea level density of air is 1.29 kg/m^3.
	<dd>Estmates of wind power can be calculated from velocities averaged over time periods greater than one hour, but this method tends to underestimate the actual power that could be produced.  For example, wind power calculated from a constant daily wind speed of 20 mph would produce a value of 461 W/m2.  However, if the wind speed were 10 mph half the time and 30 mph the other half, the mean would still be 20 mph, but the calculated wind power resulting from this profile of wind velocity would be 807 W/m^2

<font size=7><b>T</b></font><font size=5><B>echnical Background</B></font>
<dd>	During this wind survey project, 35 anemometer sites were monitored throughout the state between November 1984 and June 1991.  State-of-the-art wind resource assessment tools and techniques were used to quantify wind rose, wind speed and diurnal distribution characteristics over a wide range of territory and terrain.
	<dd>Second Wind AL-2000 data loggers, Maximum #40 anemometers and Downeastern TRX-WP wind vanes were used for data collection.  At most locations, equipment was installed on a NRG Systems 20-meter Talltower.  In some locations, existing wooden power poles or other tall-standing structures were used for the anemometer and data logger.
	<dd>Wind data was recorded and stored on Second Wind Inc. data chips, then loaded into the Utah Division of Energy Data Information System (EDIS).
<hr noshade>
<font size=7><b>D</b></font><font size=5><B>ata Format</B></font>
<dd>	Geographic information, environmental conditions and other descriptive parameters are identified for each site studied.  The Terrain Classifications in Each of the Principal Directions are eight standard generic classes for categorizing the predominant land characteristics to the north, south, east and west of the wind measurement sites.  The standard categories are:<ul>
A= Lake<br>
B= Low grass, fallow ground<br>
C= High grass, low row crops<br>
D= Tall row crops, low woods<br>
E= High woods with many trees<br>
F= Buildings and structures<br>
G= Relatively flat terrain<br>
H= Rolling terrain</ul>
	<dd>The AL-2000 data loggers used in this study report wind data in three different formats: Wind Velocity Distribution Data, Wind Dismal Data and Wind Rose Data for each location.
	<dd>The AL-2000 data loggers record hourly data from zero to a maximum of 255 hours in any single format.  The 255-hour maximum had a minor effect on Wind Velocity Distribution Data and Wind Rose Data compiled in this document.  The Wind Rose Data was corrected, but the Wind Velocity Distribution Data was left unchanged because all 255-hour maximum errors occurred at speeds under 1 0 mph, the realistic minimum wind speed needed for power generation.
	<dd>Wind Velocity Distribution Data is divided into 18 different wind speed regimes.  A wind speed regime is a segment of partitioned wind velocities.  Within these wind speed regimes, the cumulative hours per month are listed for the particular wind velocity.  This type of data presentation provides detailed information for use in technical analysis using wind velocities.
	<dd>Diurnal information is averaged wind velocity data divided into 12 daily two-hour time slots, then each time slot is averaged for the month.  The Wind Diurnal Data tables incorporate two rows of information for each month.  The upper row represents the monthly averaged wind speed for the particular time slot and the lower row contains the standard deviation for the monthly velocity averages.  The Wind Diurnal Data gives peak wind power availability for comparison with local grid demand cycles.
	<dd>The third type of data presentation, Wind Rose Data tables, provides prevailing wind direction.  These tables contain eight major wind directions on one axis and four different wind speed regimes on the other axis.  Monthly hours of wind speed in a particular direction are accumulated for use in optimizing the position of a turbine in relation to the predominant wind direction.  This data also shows seasonal changes in wind characteristics.
	<dd>Each site location also contains a graphic illustration based on the recorded value of Wind Velocity Distribution Data titled Accumulated Hours of Wind Speed Equal To or Higher Than 10 MPH.  Each graph illustrates the potential operating time in hours for a wind turbine with a cut-in speed of 10 mph.
<hr noshade>
<font size=7><b>P</b></font><font size=5><B>ower Law Analysis</B></font>
<dd>	Wind speed generally increases with height from the ground and is a function. of ground surface roughness and vertical temperature distribution.  The change in wind speed is greatest closest to the earth's surface in open flat areas.  Urban and forested areas cause near-surface turbulence that mixes air, decreases nearsurface wind speeds and increases wind speed a few hundred feet above the ground.  Power law analysis is a method of estimating wind velocity at varying heights for a specific location.
	<dd>For most anemometer sites in this report, wind velocity data was collected at the fixed anemometer height of 20 meters, the hub height of most standard wind-generated electricity systems.  Power law analysis is a simple method of predicting wind velocity above or below this 20-meter height.
	<dd>The power law equation is expressed as:
<center><img src="/images/vh.gif" border=0></center>
Where:<ul>

	<b>Vh</b>= Upper anemometer wind velocity<br>
	<b>VL</b>= Lower anemometer wind velocity<br>
	<b>Hh</b>= Elevation of the upper anemometer<br>
	<b>HL</b>= Elevation of the lower anemometer</ul>

	<dd>The () exponent in the power law equation is functionally dependent on surface roughness and wind stability.  Empirical studies define an (x value of 0.14 as appropriate for most sites.
	<dd>Power law analysis was performed with data collected at the Spanish Fork Canyon C and D locations in Utah County.  The C anemometer operated at a height of 29 meters (95 feet) and the D anemometer operated from a height of 19.8 meters (65 feet) on the same tower.
	<dd>The purpose of this analysis was to determine the validity of the 0.14 power law exponent for conditions at Spanish Fork Canyon, and to calculate a power law exponent specifically for the area.  The exponent was then used to estimate wind velocities at varying heights for the remaining Spanish Fork Canyon sites.

	<dd>To determine a power law exponent for Spanish Fork Canyon the equation was transformed to:
<center><img src="/images/aa.gif" border=0></center>
	<dd>The () exponent value was calculated using the average of the 12 monthly Wind Diurnal Data values for each time period.  A power law exponent was then calculated for each month in each individual time period.  The mean of the 12 monthly power law exponent averages is the correct adjusted power law exponent for use in other equations.

	<dd>Results of the computation are shown in Table 1.  The table indicates an approximate 35 percent change in the () value over a 24-hour period.  Appropriately, the monthly average () values vary less than the individual monthly values.  The importance of the variation between lowest and highest values of the diurnal averages increases directly with the value of the ratio Hh/HL.  A value of 0.294 can be used as an estimate of () for the Spanish Fork Canyon C and D locations, projecting velocities to turbine hub heights of up to 30 meters above or below where the actual data was recorded.
	<dd>Similar wind patterns, wind stability and surface roughness conditions exist at the other canyon locations.  Therefore, assigning () the value of 0.3 should be reasonably valid for the remaining Spanish Fork Canyon locations and other similar canyon wind sites such as Weber and Ogden canyons in Weber County.
	<dd>However, wind speeds do not always increase with height from the ground as the power law suggests.  Frequently, the power law () exponent varies too greatly to be explained by terrain alone.  Many poorly understood factors exist that affect the vertical variation of wind speeds.  Serious wind energy prospectors should always accurately measure potential wind power sites to determine true conditions, rather than rely on data from other locations or elevations.

With the Environment,</i> a computer-aided program, shows students how their home
energy use impacts the environment and how lifestyle changes can mitigate those impacts.  The
energy debate develops students' research, analytical and speaking skills.  <i>Energy patrol</i> shows
students how they can cut energy use in their own schools.  Using science and physics-based 
curriculum, <i>Solar Sprint</i> teaches students how to design and build model-scale, solar-
operated cars as application of solar energy.<br>

<font size=3><B>Recycling saves energy, thus reducing acid rain, global warming and air pollution.</B></font>
<font size=2><li> Recycling aluminum uses 95 percent less energy than producing aluminum products from raw materials.
<li> Recycling paper uses 60 percent less energy than manufacturing paper from virgin fiber.
<li> Recycling a glass jar saves enough energy to light a 100-watt light bulb for four hours.<br><br></font>
<font size=3><B>Recycling conserves valuable natural resources.</B></font><font size=2>
<li> 75,000 trees are used for the Sunday edition of the New York Times each week, yet only 30 percent of the newspaper is recycled in the United States.
<li> Recycling metals minimizes the need for mining new minerals and decreases damage to wilderness.<br><br>
</font><font size=3><B>Recycling cuts down on landfill.</B></font><font size=2>
<li> The average American throws away four pounds of garbage per day.
<li> By 1999, half the cities in the U.S. will run out of landfill space.
<li> By recycling it is possible to cut our waste stream by 80 percent.
</ul>
<font size=4><i><b>What You Can Do</b></i></font>
<ul>
<font size=3><B>Purchase and consume according to the 3 "R's": Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle.<br><br>

Reduce the amount of garbage you generated by purchasing products with minimal packaging (about half of all waste is in packaging).</B></font><font size=2>
<li> Purchase foods in bulk.
<li> "Recycle" by purchasing products in recyclable containers, such as disposable diapers, lighters, razors, and plastic utensils.
<li> Use white paper - it is easier to recycle than colored paper.
<li> Bring your own paper bags, or better yet, cloth bags, to the supermarket.
<li> Use a coffee mug rather than Styrofoam cups.</font></ul>
</td><td width=300><ul>
<font size=3><B>Reuse is the most efficient form of recycling, requiring no new natural resources or energy.</B></font><font size=2>
<li> Use products that are made to be used many times, such as cloth diapers, cloth napkins, towels and rags, sponges, dishes and silverware, rechargeable batteries, etc.
<li> Use the blank sides of paper to take notes and do scratch work.
<li> Mend clothes and repair broken appliances.
<li> Take care of belongings to help them last longer.
<li> Look into purchasing used goods at second hand stores and junk yards to eliminate unnecessary production.
<br><br></font>
<font size=3><B>Recycle as many materials as possible.  Many communities have established programs to recycle aluminum, steel, glass, newspaper, and cardboard.  It is also possible to recycle magazines, colored paper, wood, oil, solvents, and some plastics.</b></font><font size=2>
<li> Support a bottle bill (including plastics) that establishes a deposit on beverage containers.
<li> Help establish and promote a curbside recycling program.
<li> Organize a recycling program at your school, office, apartment building, churches, etc.
<li> Recycle food scraps and yard trimmings by creating a compost pile. (Food wastes and yard debris make up about One-third of the waste stream.)</font>
</ul>
<font size=4><b><i>How To Recycle</i></b></font><ul><font size=2>
<li>Separate cans, bottles, newspapers, and white paper.
<I>Glass:</I> Remove lids and labels from bottles and jars and rinse out well. (Some recycling centers ask that you separate glass by color.)
<I>Cans:</I> Remove labels and rinse well.  (Most recycling centers ask that you separate aluminum from other metals.)
<I>Newspaper:</I> Tie newspapers into bundles or put them in a paper bag.  White paper should go into a separate container.

<li>Contact your local or state recycling division to find out if your community has a curbside recycling program.  If so, put out your recyclables the night before the scheduled pickup.  If no curbside pickup exists, take your cans, bottles, and papers to the nearest drop-off site.
<li> Used motor oil and car batteries can often be recycled at service stations.<br><br></td><tr><td colspan=2>
</font><font size=3><B>Recycling does not work unless there are markets for the new products.  Part of being a recycler is purchasing products made from recycled materials, such as recycled white office paper.  When shopping, look for the recycling symbol (three arrows forming a triangle), indicating that the packaging was made from recycled materials, Check with companies you do business with to see if they use recycled products.  If not, encourage them to do so.</B></font></td></tr></table><hr noshade>

<H2>INNOVATIVE HABITATS:  UTAHNS SEEK OUT FRESH IDEAS IN ENERGY-EFFICIENT HOMES AND NEW CONCEPTS OF COMMUNITY HOUSING.  </H2><P>
<HR><B>By Susan Whitney, Staff Writer  </B><P>
    WE ALL WANT to do the right thing: to live lightly on the land. But most of us don't know where to begin.<P>
   At least that's how architect Kenton Peters sees the current state of sustainability. Peters is chairman of the design and environment committee of the Utah chapter of the American Institute of Architects. He sees his committee as being a clearinghouse for information - both for the public and for public officials who determine building codes and other rules.<P>
   ``A lot of education needs to be done. Changes need to be driven by builders and architects and knowledgable homeowners who want to make a difference,'' Peter says.<P>
   In his own practice, Peters is introducing some new design concepts to Utahns. He also likes to check out what other innovators are doing. That's why he went to Fruitland, Duchesne County, last week. Peters heard about an Earthship being built there by contractor Todd Kleinfelder.<P>
   People have been living in Earthship homes, whole neighborhoods of them, for years in New Mexico. The homes are designed to be not just energy-efficient but energy self-sufficient. They face south, with their north walls nestled into the sides of hills. Using solar panels, they generate their own electricity. They recycle water and waste.<P>
   And they are constructed of recycled materials - old tires and tin cans. In pictures he's seen of Earthships in New Mexico, Peters says, the old tires are quite visible. He is pleased to report that in the newest generation of Earthships, the tire substructure is concealed underneath an adobe exterior.<P>
   The Fruitland builder modified the design in one respect. Not knowing what a potential buyer might want, Kleinfelder connected the Earthship to electrical and water lines.<P>
   ``I was pleasantly surprised with the Earthship,'' Peters said. ``The feeling inside is very enclosing and warm and nice.'' (Kleinfelder's wife says she feels like she is being hugged when she is inside the home.)<P>
   Peters would wish for larger skylights over the earth-sheltered portion of the house. ``It's a simple house, and the way you live within it wouldn't be suited to everyone,'' he says.<P>
   Perhaps co-housing wouldn't be suited to everyone, either. But that's another new concept in housing that is coming to Utah.<P>
   Co-housing groups are small communities, planned and managed by residents who want to live in affordable, energy-efficient homes and who want to know their neighbors and share common areas and even some meals. At least two such groups of Utahns have been planning for several years.<P>
  The Rocky Mountain Cohousing Association reports that a Circle Op Springs group has purchased 124 acres near Moab on which it plans to locate 12 homes. Seven households are committed.<P>
   Meanwhile, in Salt Lake City's Glendale area, the Wasatch CoHousing group has 10 committed households and has found property and hired an attorney to draw up a development contract.<P>
   Scott Cowley, a member of the Wasatch group, explains that in order to qualify for a construction loan, his group will form an association much like a condominium homeowners' association.<P>
   Meanwhile, they are meeting with people who already live in their new neighborhood, trying to assure them that the housing project will be a nice addition to the community.<P>
   Peters is positive it will be. He thinks co-housing associations are a good way to restore a sense of community and safety to city neighborhoods, as well as a way to preserve open land in rural areas.<P>
   Peters is one of several architects interested in working for the Wasatch group. He plans to present his ideas for straw-bale construction. By way of illustration, he'll talk about the straw-bale home he is building for a client on a Pack Creek ranch near Moab.<P>
   From the outside, the house will look like a modern stucco home. It will actually be built of bales of straw, framed with timbers recycled from train trestles from the Great Salt Lake. Energy-efficient light fixtures, nontoxic paints and finishes and recycled building materials are specified.<P>
   The design incorporates passive and active solar gain. ``Our passive space is a 75-foot-long lap swimming pool along the south,'' Peters said. ``We will use the deck and the water to be our thermal mass for    passive solar heating.''<P>
   Peters says clients will probably be fortunate enough to be able to finance the house without going through a bank. The lack of a construction loan is what ultimately stopped the last straw-bale building Peters attempted to construct.<P>
   ``Changing building codes and educating officials are an amazing part of the challenge,'' says Peters. They have to be helped to understand that these are viable structures.<P>
   His Moab client has been able to insure her new home through an agent in Arizona, where straw-bale construction is more common. She first tried to go through a Utah insurance agency, and Peters was invited to explain the concept to the insurance company managers.<P>
   Laughing, he describes their reaction to his presentation. ``They said, `Thanks, but now we definitely aren't interested.' ''<P>
   <P>
   The Rocky Mountain CoHousing Association is holding its second annual conference in Boulder, Colo., Sept 28-Oct. 1. For information, call 303-492-5151.<P>

<font size = 5><center><b>P</b>ool Tips For Energy Savings</center></font>

<p><dd><font size = 4></b>Swimming pools can be big energy hogs.  In fact, the energy costs to heat the nation's 5.7 million pools and spas run in th billions of dollars annually.  Outdoor pools use high amounts of energy to heat water, which loses heat during the evening and through evaporation.  Indoor pools use a lot of energy for systems that remove evaporation-caused humidity.<br>
<hr noshade>
<dd><font size=5><b>T</b></font>he following tips can help you save energy and money by reducing heat loss and evaporation in swimming pools.
</font></P>

<OL><font size = 5><b>1.</b></font>  Use a pool cover.  In both indoor and outdoor pools, nearly 7 percent of the heat is lost through evaporation.  A pool cover can cut evaporation by 90 percent and heat loss by 70 percent, according to the National Spa & Pool Institute.  It also saves on refill water and chemicals.  A pool covered just half the time can save up to 50 percent in annual energy costs.<br><br>Pool covers do not need to be insulated to be effective; nylon reinforced pool covers reduce evaporation just as well.<br><br>New pool covers are being used with impressive results at the following indoor and outdoor pools; Gunnison City Pool, Brigham City Pool, Cedar City Pool, Box Elder Jr. High Pool, Castledale City Pool and Olympus High School Pool.<br><br>

<font size = 5><b>2.</b></font>  Keep pool water at 78 degrees F., the most healthy swimming temperature, according to the Institute.  The higher the water temperate, the greater the evaporation, and for indoor pools the greater the humidity.  Reducing the water temperate just four degrees, from 82 to 78 degrees, can cut your pool's natural gas costs by as much as 40 percent.<br><br>When measuring pool temperature, make sure the thermometer is accurate.<br><br>

<font size = 5><b>3.</b></font>  For indoor swimming pools, install a humidistat.  If you already have one, make sure it is properly synchronized with the air-handling controls.  A properly functioning humidistat combined with a pool cover will significantly increase your energy savings.  If you suspect control problems, contact a control specialist.<br><br>

<font size = 5><b>4.</b></font>  For showers, install low-flow shower heads and keep water temperature between 110 to 120 degrees.</ul><hr noshade></OL>

<CENTER><font size=6><b>ASHRAE 90.1 Energy Code<br>Highlights<br></b></font></CENTER>
</td></tr></table>
<hr noshade>
<b>Energy Code for Commercial and High-Rise Residential Buildings (ASHRAE 90.1)</b><br><br>

New commercially-sized Utah buildings meeting ASHRAE 90.1 should utilize 18 percent less
energy compared with a similarly sized building built under the old standard.<br><br>

The energy code allows three compliance paths:  The simplest and least flexible references several
tables of prescriptive measures and requires just a few calculations.  Examples are shown below. 
The performance path is more flexible and is simplified by using computer software available
through the Utah Office of Energy Services.  The third path, titled Energy Cost Budget Method,
involves extensive calculations but is the most flexible.  Below are a few examples of the
prescriptive approach for a building in Salt Lake County or locations with similar climate:<br><br>

<b>Electrical</b><p>

<p>	Subdivided feeders are required to allow portable or permanent check metering.<p>

<p>  	An Exterior Lighting Power Allowance (ELPA) typically includes 30 watts per linear foot of door
opening for an entrance without a canopy; .25 watts per square foot for the surface area to be
illuminated; and .18 watts per square foot for a public parking area.<p>

<p>	An Interior Lighting Power Allowance (ILPA) is specified at 1.72 watts per linear foot for an
office building between 10,001 sq. ft. and 25,000 sq. ft.<p>

<p>	The ILPA can be increased if luminaries are automatically controlled for occupancy, daylight,
lumen maintenance, or by some type of programmable timing.<p>

<p>	All rooms require two controls, one for task and one for ambient lighting.  An occupancy sensor
can replace these switches.<p>

<b>Envelope</b><p>

<p>	Thermal transmittance of each component shall consider all major series and parallel heat-flow
paths (thermal bridges) including metal framing members.  This can result in discounted values for
wall insulation of 40 percent to 60 percent.<p>

<p>	Thermal transmittance of fenestration assemblies will be corrected for sash, frame, spacers, and
edge effects.  (New National Fenestration Rating Council ratings include these effects.  Center-of-glass U-values are not acceptable.)<p>

<p>	Air leakage rates of doors may not exceed .32 cubic feet per minute/square foot (cfm/sq. ft) for
residential wood; .24 and .10 cfm/sq. ft. for light and heavy commercial doors, respectively; or
1.25 cfm/sq. ft. for commercial entrance doors.<p>

<p>	Roof U-value may not exceed .054. <p>

<p>	For a wall with heat capacity of less than five BTU/sq.ft. per degree Fahrenheit, the U-value may
not exceed .087.  For heat capacity ranging from five to 15, the U-value may not exceed .94 to
.031, respectively, depending on internal heat gain, location of insulation and other factors.<p>

<p>	The ratio between window and wall area can vary from 16 percent to 50 percent depending on
internal heat gain, shading coefficient and U-value of fenestration and use of permanent exterior
window shading devices.<p>

<p>

<b>Mechanical</b><p>

<p>        Heating and cooling equipment will be sized to provide no more than the loads calculated using
ASHRAE procedures.<p>

<p>	Equipment will meet or exceed values given in six tables of minimum efficiency
requirements (see pages 51-59 of code).   Typically these are values fall within
the Federal Appliance Efficiency Standards.  Gas-fired boilers and hot-water
heaters will have a minimum AFUE of 80 percent.<p>

<p>	Other examples:<p>

<p>	-	An air-cooled split system air conditioning unit, less than 65,000 Btu
capacity split system, shall have a Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio
(SEER) of 10.0 or greater.<p>

<p>	-	An air-cooled heat pump (heating mode) of 65,000 to 135,000 BTU cooling
capacity have a Coefficient of Performance (COP) of 3.0 or greater with
47F outdoor air.<p>

<p>	-	A water-cooled chiller under 150 tons capacity shall have a COP of 3.8 or
greater. <p>

<p>	-	A packaged terminal air conditioner with 95F dry bulb outdoor air shall
have an energy-efficiency ratio (EER) of 10.0 or greater.<p>

<p>

	-	A warm-air gas-fired furnace under 225,000 BTU capacity, shall have an
AFUE of 78 percent or greater.<p>

<p>

	-	Zone thermostats, where used to control both heating and cooling, shall
have a 5F dead band.<p>

<p>

	-	Duct work in unconditioned spaces shall have minimum insulation of R-5.0. <p>

<p>

	-	Gas-fired storage water heaters not equipped with a flue damper that use
indoor air for combustion or draft hood dilution when installed in a
conditioned space shall be equipped with a vent damper.<p>

<p>

	-	Vertical risers to storage water heaters, not having an integral heat trap
and serving a non-circulating system, shall have heat traps on both inlet
and outlet.<b></b>

<P>Psychologist
<A HREF="http://www.ed.psu.edu/dept/ae-insys-wfed/INSYS/ESD/Gardner/MItheory.html">Howard
Gardner</A> in his book "Frames of Mind" describes seven
intelligences and argues that we each possess all seven. The degree
to which each intelligence is developed is dependent on the learning
environment. As individuals we may have strengths in one or more of
the intelligences but none of the seven intelligences exists on its
own but rather in unity with others. The question is NOT "how smart
are you?" but <A HREF="http://www.bena.com/ewinters/styles.html">"How
are you Smart?"</A>. This theory goes beyond the traditional view of
I.Q. as a number which describes how smart people are, instead
Gardner describes the following categories:</P>

<P>It is with the Multiple Intelligence Theory that classroom
activities in the junior high classes at Highbury School are based,
meeting student needs in both areas of intelligence strengths and
weaknesses. Within the structure of center-based activities, high
interest groups, PODs, have been established to meet student needs in
providing enrichment in the area of their intelligence strengths.

<H3>Modern Egypt</H3>

<A HREF="http://auc-amer.eun.eg/egypt.html">Modern Egypt</A> is a land with a
proud past having been the birthplace or a great ancient river valley
civilazation. The land of <A
HREF="http://www.ic.gov/94fact/country/71.html">Egypt</A> occupies the
northeastern corner of the African continent. Surrounded on both sides by
deserts, Egypt would not exist if it were not for the waters of the River Nile
that bring life to a virtually rainless region. Egypt proper, from the
Mediterranean coast in the north to the traditional southern boundary at Aswan,
is some 650 miles long. The strip of fertile land or Delta on either side of the
<A HREF="w.bank.nile.gif">Nile</A> is never more than 12 miles wide.


<H3>Music</H3>

The River Valley Egyptians enjoyed <A HREF="sax1.au">music</A>. Dancing, poetry
and story-telling were also pleasures to these people. Some of the <A
HREF="players.gif">instruments</A> commonly used during this period were: bells,
lute, oboes, tambourine, lyre, harp, sistrum and castenets.

The harps that were played could have been as tall as the musicians. Some
ceremoniall trumpets have been found in an Egyptian Kings's tomb. Most of the
information on music from that era comes from paintings.

<H3>ART</H3>

Art is one of the biggest accomplishments of the River Valley society. They built
many pyramids using jewish slaves commanded by pharaohs. The Great Pyramid was
built using arches , the first ever in architecture. Hand stamps imprinted with
different pictures were used for dipicting laws and contracts. Art of Ancient
River Valley Egypt has been found in burial tombs.

<H3>Literature and Writing</H3>

Hieroglyphics is the name for Egyptian picture writing which was founded in 3300
B.C. Hieroglyphics stood for objects but in later years the form of pictures were
redesigned to make sounds that people combined to make words. Over a progression
of years the number of hieroglyphic writing styles decreased.

Hieroglyphics were first designed to keep different types of records. The River
Valley people started using it to write letters and books. The River Valley
People also developed a form of paper manufacturing on a material called <A
HREF="http://www.lib.umich.edu/pap/HomePage.html">papurus</A> Hieroglyphics were
imbedded on solid rock walls which were placed inside burial chambers of
pyramids. Hieroglphics were also used on <A
HREF="http://www-oi.uchicago.edu/OI/MUS/HIGH/OIM_1347.html">walls</A> of Egyptian
temples.

<H3>Education</H3>

Schooling was for the rich in Ancient River Valley Egypt. Children of poor
families would work with their parents in the fields or raising animals. For
those who could attend schooling was from  sunrise to sunset and began at the age
of 5 and continued to the age of 17 for both boys and girls. The teachers were
priests and the schooling was done in temples. Children leared to read,
arithmetic and hieroglyphic writing. Children who misbehaved or did not do as
expected were physically punished.

<H3>Entertainment</H3>

The River Valley Egyptians worked very hard and used their time wisely. They had
a variety of forms of entertainment, music, dancing, poetry, story-telling,
wrestling and games. The wealthy people of River Valley Egypt held parties and
entertained their guests with acrobats and musicians. Senet was a popular board
game in ancient Egypt. Senet was played with a board and counters. The board was
parted into three rows of ten squares. The object of the game was to get all your
pieces to the off of the board. Senet was illustrated on tomb walls to represent
the game of life and death with eternal life granted to the winner.  Children
played with tops, wooden balls, dolls and wooden animals.

<H3>Religion</H3>

The Egyptian religion was based on the  "natural world".  They strongly believed
in truth, justice and order. The River Valley people beleived in <A
HREF="http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu:8001/usr/sk4p/occult/misc/egy">many
gods</A> of which some of were only believed in specific towns and villages, such
as the god Amon. Other gods were worshiped in the entire country of Egypt. The
god Ra was believed to bring sunlight to Egypt as he took flight across the
skies. Osiris was the <A
HREF="http://www-oi.uchicago.edu/OI/MUS/HIGH/OIM_10486.html">underworld</A> god,
this was a place believed to be cool and full of trees. This is where Egyptians
went when they died. Osiris, the nice god was urdered by his brother Seth. Isis
the sife of Osiris collected her husband, Osiris's remains and brought him back
to life. Isis is the the protector of children. Anubis was the god who was
caretaker of all the dead and their tombs. Egyptians also thought that when
people died they were sent to Anubis who then decided whether that person would
have eternal happiness.

<H3>Roles of Men and Women In Ancient Egypt </H3> Men basically ran the Egyptian
society. Pharaohs were mostly men but there were a few female rulers and
pharaohs. One of the most famous of these was <A HREF="hunting.gif">Queen
Hatshepsut</A>. The unique and most interesting quality about her was that she
dressed like a man.

Women married very young and began having families while still in their teens.
They would take care of the house and children. Egyptian laws dictated similar
rights for men and women but men were the head of their families.  It was common
for marriages to occur within a family between cousins or uncles and nieces.

Wealthy Egyptian men often worked in the business of government, while the women
took care of the home and family needs. The wives  were responsible for party
arrangements for entertaining friends and business  associates.  In comparison to
the rich, the poor of Egypt had similar role expectations. The poor people worked
very long hours, day in and day out, in the fields or making food and clothing.

Egyptians were very  intelligent architects and surveyors. They used "the royal
cubit" as a unit of measurement. They developed tools to a plub level and a right
angle to make sure surfaces were straight and level.











<H3>Contributions Made by River Valley Egypt</H3>

Many contributions have been made to us by the River Valley society. One of the
most intriguing is the pyramids. Pyramids were built of stone or brick and were
tombs of Pharaohs.  Two of the most famous were the Great Pyramid and the Great
Step Pyramid which was built in 2760 BC. The Great Pyramid is made of over two
million, 21/2 ton blocks of stone. Archeologists have ventured into many
pyramids. Almost everything in the tombs was made of gold but all pyramids were
robbed in ancient times.

The great <A HREF="sphinx.gif">Sphinx</A> is another monumental contribution from
these people. It was carved of rock. 4,500 years ago. The Sphinx had the body of
a lion and the face of a man. It is believed to be the portrait of King Khafre.

<A HREF="http://www-oi.uchicago.edu/OI/MUS/HIGH/OIM_7177.html">Mummies</A> have
also been a helpful contribution to science. Through the preservation of
mummification, we have learned valuable information about the ancient Egypt
lifestyle.

<H2><CENTER>Nuclear Reactors</CENTER></H2>
<H3>Definiton:</H3>

<P>A nuclear or atomic reactor is a device that uses a small amount of fuel to produce a large amount of energy.  A nuclear reactor uses a process known as "nuclear fission" to create energy, usually in the dorm of heat.  Nuclear fission is the splitting of the nuclei of atoms of uranium or plutonium, causing a release of energy.  Nuclear reactors vary in design and size.  However, most nuclear reactors have five main parts: the core, the moderator, the control rods, the coolant and the pressure vessel.  Nuclear reactors can produce electric power without burning fuel sources such as coal or oil.</P>

<H3>History</H3>

<P>Until 1900, scientists weren't even aware that nuclear energy existed.  At this time, it was known that all existing things were made up of atoms.  The next step was to find out what held the atom together.  It was believed to be an extremely strong force.  The next challenge was to find out how to extract this energy from the centre of nuclei of the atom.  With this discovery, scientists were well on their way to mastering nuclear energy.</P>

<P>During World War II, a team of Canadian and British scientists gathered secretly in Montreal to design a nuclear reactor.  This first, small experimental reactor was called Zeep (Zero Energy Experimental Pile).  In September 1945, Zeep was switched on at the new Chalk River laboratories and became only the second nuclear reactor in the world to be put into operation.  Canada's nuclear scientists hoped to use the nuclear reactor to produce electricity.</P>

<P>Many years later, in 1967, Ontario Hydro completed the first CANDU reactor.  Using the CANDU reactor, a fuel bundle weighing only 22kg was able to produce as much energy as burning 2000 barrels of oil.  Today, about half of Ontario's electricity is generated from nuclear fission.</P>

<P>Many scientists working together have designed nuclear reactors like the one now located at Pinawa, Manitoba.  However, most of the earlier reactors have been shut down since they were built without adherence to safety standards or became too controversial to remain open.  If nuclear energy was fully developed, it would have the power to give the world electricity for millions of years.</P>

<H3>How a Nuclear Reactor Works:</H3>

<P>A nuclear reactor is a piece of equipment that extracts energy from the nuclei of uranium atoms.  A reactor may be thought of as a kettle in which nuclear fission heats water.  The steam which results spins turbines which spin generators to make electricity.  The water cools down the fuel and slows down the neutrons, making them more efficient at producing nuclear fission.</P>

<P>In order to produce energy, a nuclear reactor needs fuel.  In the past, expensive, enriched uranium was used to fuel reactors.  Today, natural and less expensive uranium is used(Plutonium can also be used to fuel reactors).
To make fuel for the reactor, the natural uranium oxide is baked into pellets.  Eight pellets have the power to provide electricity for the average home for one year.  These uranium pellets are sealed into long steel tubes and then stored as fuel bundles. The bundles are then placed in pressure tubes at the centre of the reactor thus providing the fuel for the reactor and creating a fission chain</P>

<P>The fission chain is made when the atoms inside the uranium split.  This creates a chain reaction.  One atom splits into two.  These two atoms split and then there are four.  The resulting heat, changes the water to steam, which turns the turbines, and eventually creates the electricity we all depend on.</P>

<P>After many months, the fuel bundle is removed and is kept in something resembling a swimming pool.  Once the fuel bundle has been used, it is considered radioactive waste and has no further use.</P>

<H2><CENTER>Advantages of Nuclear Energy</CENTER></H2>

<H3>Introduction:</H3>

<P>The advantages and disadvantages of nuclear energy continue to be a matter of debate and controversy. Despite the criticisms of nuclear energy,there are many advantages in respect to the environment, the economy and our future generation.</P>

<H3>Environment:</H3>

<P>An important advantage of using nuclear energy is that nuclear reactors produce electric power without burning fossil-fuels such as coal or oil.  The use of nuclear power helps to conserve the world's supply of these fuels.  The world's known reserves of uranium contain as much energy as the world's know deposits of oil.  As well, the uranium that has been used could be recycled in the future to make more energy.</P>

<P>Nuclear reactors do not give off smoke or gases that pollute the air.  Therefore, power can be generated without causing negative effects to the environment.  In fact, nuclear energy produces small amounts of waste when compared with traditional energy sources.  As well, nuclear energy does not contribute to two of the major environmental threats of concern today, the Greenhouse Effect and Acid Rain.</P>

<H3>Economy:</H3>



<P>In addition to the environmental advantages of nuclear power, the economy benefits because less money is spent on feul. In comparison, nuclear power plants cost less to operate than fossil-feul plants.</P>

<P>Nuclear ebergy has important medical and industrial applications. Nuclear physicists use Candu reactors to produce radioactive isotopes used in medicine to kill cancer cells. Even though radiation can cause cancer, it can also be used to cure it. In fact, lives can be saved through radiation therapy. A Canadian, Harold John, developed the world's first radiotherapy units for treating cancer. He used radioactive cobalt that feuls them has also become a successful business for Canada's nuclear industry.</P>

<P>Nuclear energy supplies more than one-thrid of the electrical energy in eleven countries. In fact, nuclear power produces more electricity than does hydroelectriity in the Western industrial world. AECL (Atomic Energy of Canada, Ltd.) provides 75% of electricity in Ontario and one-third of the electric power in New Brunswick. AECL also provides electrical power to Quebec, South Korea, Argentina, India and Pakistan.</P>

<P>It takes approximately six to eight years to build a nuclear reactor.  The construction of a nuclear reactor near the city it will be serving supports the economy by providing employment.  Several hundred people are required to operate all the jobs in a nuclear power plant.  Considering a 30-40 year lifespan for a CANDU reactor, steady employment is an economical advantage for such communities.</P>

<H3>Future Generations:</H3>



<P>Nuclear plants are potentially hazardous sites.  However, to make them as safe as possible for our future generations, nuclear power plants must meet strict government regulations that are not required of fossil-fuel plants.  For example, a nuclear power plant must satisfy government authorities that it can quickly deal with any kind of emergency.

Canada has been actively involved in nuclear energy for over 30 years and AECL employees are proud of the role they have played in the development of the CANDU reactor.  AECL continues to improve their company by developing new and improved reactors.  At AECL, they operate a safety and waste management service in both public and private interests.  For more than 40 years, waste management has been implemented effectively.</P>





<P>Even though, radiation laeks seldom ever happen, AECL's concern for future generations povides environmental protection for both health and scientific reasons. AECL tries to help and find ways to reduce nuclear and radiation waste. Some waste can actually be reused which reused which reduces the overall volume. As to the reminder, AECL believes that burying nuclear waste in the ground is safe disposal method. After 10 years, 90% of the radioactiveness is lost and after 100 years, 99% is no longer evident. Used nuclear fuel bundles are burried in thick, concrete canisters up to 100 feet deep. When buried, the most important barrier to protect radiation from leaking out. Safety precaution are fore most in ensuring that nuclear waste is not harmful to our future generation.
</P>

<H2><CENTER>Disadvantages of Nuclear Energy</CENTER></H2>
<H3>Introduction:</H3>



<P>The advantages and disadvantages of nuclear energy continue to be a matter of debate and controversy. In the aftermath of the accidents at the Three Mile Island nuclear plantin Pennsylvania and the disaster at the Chernobyl reactor in the Ukraine, nuclear energy has been criticized as having negative effects on the environment, the economy and our future generation.</P>

<H3>Environment:</H3>

<P>The disposal of radioactive wastes produced by nuclear reactors is a prime environmental concern. The uranium used in nuclear reactor continues to produce dangerous radiation long after it has been used up as a feul for nuclear energy. Thesewastes remain highly radioactive for thousands of years and can cause serious damage. For example, nuclear radition has a harmful effect on humans, wildlife, and plants alike. In fact, it makes conditions unlivable for most living things and does not contribute to a healthy environment. As scientists hane not yet found a permanent method of safely disposing toxic waste, the only temporary solution is to bury the waste under sand, rock and clay.
</P>

<P>Nuclear power plants also generate more heat than power plants that burn coal or oil, Therefore, they need more water to cool their systems. As a result, more hot waste water is dumped into lakes and streams. This hot water or <B>thermal pollution</B> can harm animals and plants that live at lower temperatures. As well, the pollution that results from nuclear testing is also hazardous to the environment.</P>

<H3>Economy:</H3>

<P>There are at least two main problems with nuclear power plants that make them less economical to operate. Firstly, nuclear energy power plants are costly to build. Secondly, there is the danger of equipment failure. Sometimes these plants are forced to shut down for months at a time. A loss in operating time means an increase in the cost of electrical power. the financing of nuclear testing also puts strains on the economy.</P>

<H3>Future Generations:</H3>

<P>Nuclear energy raises importants safety concerns for future generations.  The possibility of another major nuclear reactor accident has increased opposition to the building of nuclear power plants.  In fact, there are fewer new nuclear reactors being built due to safety concerns.  A leak or a break in a reactor water pipe could have severe consequences if there is a large loss of coolant.  The term melt down is used when leftover radioactive materials become so hot, due to insufficient coolant, that eventually the core of the reactor melts.  All this may result in the release of large amounts of radiation.</P>

<P>Perhaps the cheif harzard from making nuclear power, results from the radioactive material that a reactor produces.  Exposure to radiation can cause cancer to the human body.  It can also be destructive in other ways, causing cells to mutate and causing physical, genetic defects in the future.  Nuclear radiation can be extremely dangerous.  If skin has been exposed to a large amount of radiation, the result may end in the contraction of radiation sickness or even death.</P>

<P>Decisions regarding nuclear energy made today will have a definite impact on future generations.  However, there is no guarantee that the safety precautions taken today will be effective tomorrow.  It is entirely possible that it will be up to our future generations to find a way to decontaminate radioactive nuclear waste.  In one sense, we are implicating our future generations in problems that we have created and may not be around to solve.</P>

<H2><CENTER>Nuclear Plant Disasters of the 20th Century</CENTER></H2>



<H3>Introduction:</H3>


<P>Despite the installation of safety systems in nuclear energy plants, the 20th century has witnessed several tragic accidents. Nuclear accidents have resulted due to human error, to equipment failure and to distructine weather condition such as tornadoes. </P>

<H3>Great Britain (1957)</H3>

<P>The frist serious nuclear accidents took place in Graet Britain. In 1957, a Windscale 1 graphite reactor, located in a British weapons production plant, burst into flames. Dangerous emissions of iodine and cesium were released into the surrounding area. As a result, both the windscale plant and a similar unit were shut down.
</P>

<H3>Harrisburg, Pennsylvania (1979)</H3>

<P>The nuclear tragedy at Harrisburg, Pennsylvania has become better known as the Three Mile Island Disaster. The accident occurred on March 28, 1979 and is considered to be the most serious accident in the United States involving a commercail nuclear reactor.</P>

<P>The accident began with the escape of coolant caused by a small break, resulting from a valve being stuck at the open position. It was revealed that human error was responsable for not allowing adequate cooling and the melting of approximately one-half to one-third of the reactor core. Even though the reactor's temperature soared above 1100 degrees, it remained intact and debris from the accident was contained. A large amount of gaseous, fission product escaped from a container into the containment building which prevented its release into the environment. Those noble gases which did escape, such as xenon, proved to have few negitive effects. </P>

<P>The reactor eventually are cooled down and a total meltdown was avoided. There were no fatalities, but the incident terrified many and brought the dangers of radiation to the forefront of public awareness. 
</P>

<H3>Chernobyl, Ukraine (1986)</H3>

<P>At 1:23 am, on April 26th, 1988, a steam explosion occurred at the nuclear reactor at Chernobyl's power station, in the Soviet Union, now known as the Ukraine. The accident was not revealed to the rest of the world until April 28th, when reserchers discovered radiation over a nuclear power station in Sweden. The explosion at Chernobyl is acknowledged as the worst nuclear reactor accident in history. </P>

<P>The accident occurred when plant workers were testing an electric generator that ran on steam supplied by the reactor. A sudden increased in the reactor's power lead to the hydrogen explosion. Both the reactor and a large amount of the building were destroyed by the explosion. There radioactive materials accumulated in the reactor core escaped into the environment and the atomesphere because the plant did not have a reactor vessel which contained such materials in the event of an accident.</P>

<P>At least thirty-one people, primarily fire fighters and plant workers, have died as a result of radiation and burns. As well, there were more than 200 people seriously injured. The Chernobyl disaster resulted in a reevaluation of nuclear reactor safety and questioned even the need for nuclear power.</P>


<CENTER><H3>What is the Nuclear Controversy in Manitoba</H3></CENTER>
<H3>Introduction:</H3>


<P>In a statement published in the August 14, 1980 issue of the Winnipeg Free Press, it was reported that some countries seem to have the idea that Canada would be an ideal dumping ground for nuclear and toxic waste.  The reason being, the Canadian Shield would be an ideal receptacle because of the solid rock.  Since Manitoba is located on the Canadian Shield, a site near Lac du Bonnet was proposed.</P>

<H3>The Manitoba Controversy:</H3>
	<P>	A group called the Concerned Citizens of Manitoba have expressed concern over possible future hazards in the area.  The group questions what would happen if the toxic and nuclear waste was accidently leaked?  Perhaps it may not be hazardous to us, but we must think of our children and our future generations.  Residents in the region of the Canadian Shield have to decide on whether of not this area should be used as a radioactive waste dump or look for other alternatives.  If Manitoba goes along with this deal, then the province stands to make billions.

</P>

<P>In 1988, a statement issued by the Federal Standing Committee on environment and forestry is quoted as saying,</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> "A moritorium on the construction of nuclear power plants in Canada should be imposed until the people of Canada have agreed on an acceptable solution for the disposal of high level radioactive waste."  </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Manitoba's Bill 28 absolutely forbids the dumping of high level radioactive waste.  There was a billion dollar windfall for the Federal government providing they had approved the plans to build an underground waste disposal site in the Canadian Shield.</P>
<P>		AECL (Atomic Energy of Canada, Ltd.) believes that this waste disposal site will cost more than 13 billion dollars.  Some of this money will be used to pay 3000 workers and about 10 billion dollars will be invested into the economy.  This waste dump would be able to hold 10 million used fuel bundles.  If the site is approved, it will take 25 years to complete the digging.</P>

</P>

<P><TT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#6F206F">From year to years, scientist
don't know if the theory of Continental Drift is true or not. Most
scientists disagree this theory. They think that the continents were
fixed and always been in the same spot as they are today.</FONT></TT>
</P>

<P><TT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#6F206F">Alfred.L.Wegener is a scientist
who believed in the theory of Continental Drift. He was one of the
scientists who realized that the coast line of South America and
Africa looks like it would fit together.He hypothesized that
continents was once a large land mass. He named this supercontinent
Pangaea.He made a map that showed how the continents fitted together.
Later on, he read a paper and found geological and biological
evidencs which supported his theory. The geological evidence was
similar rocks were found on mainly southern part of Pangaea. The
biological evidence was similar fossils of plants and animals were
found on southern part of Pangaea. Wegener's arguement to the fixed
continent was why there are geological and biological evidence found
in the continents.</FONT></TT></P>

<P><TT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#6F206F">Scientists thought Wegener's
evidences was really strong. But then, some scientists proposed that
there might be a land bridge for the animals to cross. Later, the
bridge sinked. Scientists who are supporting the fixed continents
argued why the continents were drifting. WHat kind of force could it
be? These forces must be really strong to move the continents. Where
did such huge force come from?</FONT></TT></P>

<P><TT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#6F206F">Wegener argued how could animals
cross such a huge bridge. Also, there wasn't any evidence for the
land bridge. But Wegener didn't have a good explanation for what
caused the continents to move. Wegener didn't know the information he
needed to answer that question couldn't been found on the continents.
Instead of on the continents, it was down in the ocean.</FONT></TT>
</P>

<P><TT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#6F206F">As technology was more advance, a
ship called Sonar was invented. It was a ship which sends transmitted
waves to the ocean floor and then it reflects back up to the ship.
Sonar at first didn,t work that well. The ocean floor was still left
unclear. Later on, an American geologist, Harry Hess was using a more
advanced Sonar equipment. This time, Hess found something like a worn
down volcanoe in the ocean floor. It has a flat top to it. Hess named
the worn down volcanoe "guyot". Later, more guyots were found. There
was also more things that was really interesting. There was a ridge
called "Mid-Atlantic Ridge". Those ridges were placed where
earthquakes occurred. The next question for the scientists was where
could such huge force to form ridges came from. The next technology
that was used was Seismic Waves. It was used to send explosion on the
end of a ship and a scientist found out what kind of rocks are on the
ocean floor and how deep. A scientist named Ewing found out that it
was sediment on the ocean floor and the deepest was only 1 km deep.
Samples of rocks were taken. It was lava they found out, and
volcanoes tha are still forming. Trenches were found close to the
continent. It was placed where eathquake occurred too. Later,
scientist found that some ridges are connected together. The next
technology was used was Magnetometers. Scientist found out that ther
was magnetic strips on the ridges by using magnetometers. THey don,t
know what caused it. It wa in a set of pattern. It was called
Magnetic Reversal. Later, Radioactive Dating was invented. It was
used to find out how old the rocks are. They found out that the
continents were older than the ocean floors. They also found out for
the ridges, the older rocks are pushed aside and the newer ones were
in the middle. Deep sea drlling was the next technology used in the
ocean floor to find more samples.</FONT></TT></P>

<P><TT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#6F206F">Hess was the geologist who was
the first one to discover guyots. He proposed a theory on sea floor
spreading. His theory was called "Geopoetry". He agrees with
Wegener's theory of Continental Drift. At that time, Tuzo Wilson, a
geophsyst proposed a theory on plates on the earth that can move.
Their theories were rejected because they couldn't find the huge
forces which caused the plates to move and the sea floor to
spread.</FONT></TT></P>

<P><TT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#6F206F">As technology became even more
advance, a small submarine that has eletronic arms which can pick up
samples from the bottom of the ocean was invent. This device was
called "Submersible". It went down to the ocean floor and took 10000
pictures. That was it. It was proved that the sea floor was
spreading. Hess's and Wilson's theory combine which became a new
theory called "The Theory of Tectonic Plate". </FONT></TT></P>

<P><TT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#6F206F">After that, there was something
called direct and indirect evidence. Direct evidence were true.
Indirect evidence were not sure.</FONT></TT></P>

<P><TT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#6F206F">Scientists thinks that there is
three layers of rocks under the crust. It is the mantle, outer core
and inner core. The mantle was divded into three. The lithospere is
the top layer of the mantle. The lithosphere rests on the
asthenosphere, which is partly molten.</FONT></TT></P>

<P><TT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#6F206F">Back in the 1930s, some
scientists proposed that thee might be something called Convection
currents. These currents travel through the partly molten part of the
asthenosphere. This might be the cause to make the plates move. This
might be a reason that the continents were moving.</FONT></TT></P>

<P><TT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#6F206F">So, this was the development of
"The Theory of Tectonic Plate". It is proved today that this theory
is true. </FONT></TT></P>

<P><TT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#4D2563"><HR></FONT></TT></P>

<P><TT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#4D2563">For many years, scientists have
been trying to find a theory to explain the mountain buildings,
earthquakes, volcanoes, and movements of the continents. A theory for
this was de1veloped called Plate Tectonic or Tectonic Plate. Hard
shell of a nut was what the earth's surface was thought to be like.
This nut shell had been cracked in many places. The broken pieces are
really the plates about 40 miles (64 km) thick. The plates are always
moving.</FONT></TT></P>

<P><TT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#4D2563">There are about 13 major tectonic
plates in the world. There names are North American Plate, Carribean
Plate, South American Plate, Arabian Plate, African Plate, Eurasian
Plate, Antartic Plate, China Plate, Philippine Plate, Indo-Australlia
Plate, Pacific Plate, Cocos Plate and Nazca Plate.</FONT></TT></P>

ALIGN=bottom>This is Alfred L. Wegner, he developed the theory called
"Continental Drift" or "Drifting Continents". A map was created by
him to explain continents fitting together. He dicovered that there
might be evidence for the idea that the continents had once been a
single land mass. This big piece of land was called Pangaea. He read
a scientific paper that gave the examples of identical plants and
animals on both sides of the Atlantic ocean. He tried to find more
evidence to support his theory of Continental Drift after and
published a book on that.</FONT></TT></P>

<P><TT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#431748">This is the map that Alfred L.
Wegener created to explain his theory of Continental Drift. He named
this large land mass Pangaea which means "all land" in greek because
he believed this supercontinent once exist. Wegener think that, South
America and Africa began to seperate about 100 million years ago,
during the Cretaceous Period, so did North America and Europe. It
seperated which created Atlantic ocean. The Indian ocean began to
open up during the Jurasic Period. India, which was a subcontinent,
moved north and attached to Asia and Australia seperated from
Antartica. Then, the continents kept moving to where they are
today.</FONT></TT></P>

<B>Intranets</B><BR>
<P>



<P>A Intranet is a new term being used for the application of Internet
technologies, (World Wide Web, E-Mail, F.T.P.,Gopher, etc.), within an organization, rather than for external connection to the global component of the Internet. </P>


<P>Many of the benefits of using the internet can be achieved using an 'intranet'.  This document will explain the technology behind setting up and using a classroom intranet using Macintosh computers.  Many of the concepts outlined would also work on other computer platforms.</P>

<!-- Horizontal Line Tag --><HR>
<B>World Wide Web</B>
<P>The core of today's internet is the World Wide Web and so the core both the internet and an intranet is the Web Server.  The World Wide Web is proving to be a wonderful addtion to the information revolution since the web provides;
	     <!-- List Tag --><UL TYPE=disc>
<LI>			 ease of use and management 
<LI>       easily updatable data or information
<LI>       an easy way to deliver information 
<LI>       basic information security 
<LI>       multi-media applications 
<LI>       reduced printing and distribution costs 
<LI>       multiple computer platforms. 
</UL></P>


<P>Schools can set up an intranets for;
    
<!-- List Tag --><UL TYPE=disc>
<LI>Publishing documents - essays, stories, assignments, newsletters,school policies, etc. 
<LI>Access to searchable directories - timetables, information resources, calendars, schedules, etc. 
<LI>Access to databases. 
<LI>District/School/Classroom/Individual Information pages. 
<LI>Simple groupware applications. 
<LI>Software distribution. 
<LI>E-mail - normal e-mail along with multi-media attachments.
</uL></P>
<!-- Horizontal Line Tag --><HR>

<B>E-Mail Gateway</B>


<P>An intranet can also include an e-mail gateway to the internet allowing a classroom or school lab with a single internet connection to give users access to world wide e-mail.</P>

<B><H1>Requirements for Macintosh Intranets</H1></B>


<P>The following page will show how to configure a lab of networked Macintosh computers to operate as an 'intranet'.  This pages owes much to many other Mac WebMasters and writers, especically, Steven E. Collins and his great <!-- Link Tag --><A HREF="http://web66.coled.umn.edu/Cookbook/contents.html">Classroom Internet Server Cookbook</A> page on Web66, and Grant Neufeld for mantaining the <!-- Link Tag --><A HREF="http://arpp.carleton.ca/mac/">Macintosh WWW FAQ</A> page.</P>
Before you begin you must insure you have the following equipment, software and hardware in place;
<!-- List Tag --><DL>
<DT><!-- Graphic Tag --><IMG SRC="gifs/blbullet.gif">&nbsp;<B>Macintosh Computers</B> (68020 or above, and System 7.0.x or above)
<DD>     	

<P>Although this concept will work on older System 6.0.x Mac's, especially gopher and e-mail, you will not be able to operate or access a Web Server.  Any Macintosh newer than the original LC will work in an intranet using all applications including a Web Server.</P>

  

<P>If you are unsure about whether some computers in your lab will work and you have at least one modem connection to the internet you might want to download Macintosh Catalog Database.  The Macintosh Catalog is available in two forms: as a FileMaker Pro 2.0 database file, (Macintosh Catalog Database v.45x), or as a stand alone database file, (Macintosh Catalog Runtime v.45x)  bundled with FileMaker Pro User, the runtime version of Claris' FileMaker Pro application. You can get the latest version of either file from the following source: <!-- Link Tag --><A HREF="http://www.zdnet.com/macuser/software/macbrows.html">http://www.zdnet.com/macuser/software/macbrows.html</A></P>


<DT><!-- Graphic Tag --><IMG SRC="gifs/blbullet.gif">&nbsp;<B>A Working LAN</B> (Local Area Network)
<DD>

<P>Since all Macintosh computers come with builtin network features this requirement should be straight forward.  Any type of Macintosh networking will do, local talk, or ethernet.  Remember that ethernet will be faster, but since this is an intranet you won't be accessing files from 'Guam' so even slow networks schemes like local talk should work fairly well.</P>

  <p>If your computers are not presently networked you will have to connect them into some sort of LAN.  Local talk networking is fairly easy to do and is the least expensive network to run.  Connecting the Macintosh computers in your lab with <!-- Link Tag --><A HREF="http://www.farallon.com/www/catalog/catpn.html">PhoneNET</A> connectors is one easy solution but there are others, check with a local Macintosh Users Group for help.</P>  <p>If you share a printer with other users you have some sort of network running.  An easy test of a Macintosh network is to use the chooser to locate shared devices.  <!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="seehow"><!-- Link Tag --><A HREF="seehow.html">Click here to see how</A></A>.</p>

<DD>Either of these system additions add the internet socket layer to the system software on your Macintosh.  Both Mac TCP and Open Transport are Apple products and can be purchased from all the usual Apple Outlets.  Recently (the last year or so) Macintosh computers have all shipped with one or the other of these system files already loaded.  Open Transport is now apart of <!-- Link Tag --><A HREF="http://product.info.apple.com/productinfo/datasheets/ss/iconnkit.html">Apple's Internet Connection Kit</A>  </dl>

 StarNine recommends a Macintosh with 8 or more
       MB of RAM, running 7.0.1 or greater, and MacTCP. It is possible to run
       WebSTAR on a Macintosh with 4MB of RAM, however the System Software
       will need to be stripped down of inits and extensions so it requires no more than
       1.4 MB of RAM. In a low memory configuration, WebSTAR should be the only
       application running and running CGI's is not advised.

<B>Transparency</B> </a><p>
Transparency is a nifty little utility which allows you to change the
transparent color index in GIF images.  This is, of course, a useful
utility to have for those who want cool-looking icons in their WWW pages
(like this one!)<p>
<!-- Link Tag --><A HREF="http://www.intellinet.com/CoolTools/CalendarMaker/"><B>WWW Calendar Generator</B></A><P>

<!-- Link Tag --><A HREF="http://198.85.68.67:8000/downloads/yak.sit.hqx"><B>Yak!</B></A> <P>
This is a simple, fast Web "chat" program which allows an unlimitted number of people to carry on real time conversations.  There are a few limitations, and it hasn't been extensively tested, but its free and probably worth a look if you want to do "chatting".<P>
<B><!-- Link Tag --><A HREF="http://salk.edu/~preston/as/thumbnailer.html">Thumbnailer</A></B><P>


This applescript droplet will batch process PICT, JPEG, or GIF files into thumbnails and full size images for use in HTML pages. It uses the great program clip2gif (For best results use the latest version: 0.7) by Yves Piguet (piguet@ia.epfl.ch) as its conversion engine. Thumbnailer also writes an HTML index that can be used in cutting
and pasting the HTML directly into your HTML documents.

<B><!-- Link Tag --><A HREF="tcp.html#test">Click here to return to Macintosh TCP for Intranets</A></B>
<BR><!-- Horizontal Line Tag --><HR> 
Go to the <B>Chooser</B> on any Macintosh you wish to confirm a network connection.  

<P>Make sure that appletalk is <B>Active</B>, see the bottom right hand corner of the chooser.  If appletalk is not active, click on the radio button to start appletalk and restart your Macintosh (Every computer in your intranet must have appletalk on). If apple talk is active then click on a shared printer resource, (laser pinter, or appletalk imagewriter), network devices connected to your network will appear in the window on the right.  In the example below you see four visible printer.  If you can see them then they can see you, ergo you are connected to the network!!!   </P>


<!-- Graphic Tag --><IMG WIDTH=465 HEIGHT=312  SRC="gifs/chooser.GIF"><BR>

If you don't have any network devices (shared printers)  you canconduct a similar  test using AppleShare, Apples built in file sharing protocal. See your Macintosh manual for the steps to have a Mac share files over a network.  Once you have configured a Macintosh to share files or folders user your Chooser to check other Macs can 'see' the computer sharing files.  Open the Chooser and select Appleshare from the top left hand window.  With Appleshare turned on on a computer somewhere on your LAN you should be able to see the sahring computer appear in the Chooser's right hand window.  In the example below two Macs are sharing on this network, ICE and Snowflake.  Once again you are successfully connected or networked to the other computer.  Don't forget to turn off sharing after the test if you don't have a reason to have it on.<BR>

<P>IP addresses are 32-bit numbers, usually written out as four numbers separated by periods, for instance 192.0.0.0. There are three sizes of networks: A, B, and C. A number below 128 indicates a Class A network, a Class A network, is a large address space
capable of holding millions of computers.  A Class B address starts with numbers between 128 and 191, and can hold tens of thousands of machines. Class C addresses start with numbers from 192
to 223, and can hold about 250 machines.  So for your intranet you will use a Class C address.  </P>



<P>Each computer in your intranet must have a unique number in your 'fictional' Class C set of numbers.  Almost any set of numbers will work, however there is a standard set of sorts to use -  Private Class C addresses are all addresses from 192.168.0.0 to
192.168.255.0.  This standard is used to avoid really confusion should your network every really get connected to the internet.</p><p>
Pick a number for your private Class C from 0 to 255 and make your network IP address 192.168.your number.0. (In our example 192.168.<B>2</B>.0-255). 
<P>The computers in your network would run in a series as follows;<BR>
192.168.2.1<BR>
192.168.2.2<BR>
192.168.2.3<BR>
etc.</P>
<p> The private network's subnet mask, will be 255.255.255.0. </P>





<P>


<P>To access a machine on your network you must use the computer's IP address.  For example if you set up a Web Server on the computer that had IP address 192.168.2.1 you would type http://192.168.2.1 in your Web Browser to connect to the server.</P><!-- Link Tag --><A HREF="hosts.html">See Setting up a HOSTS file</A> if you wish to use 'names' rather than numbers to access computers on your intranet.</P>

<B><H1>Setting Up a Hosts File</H1></B>


<P>A Hosts file can replace some services provided by accessing the real internet such as DNS (Domain Name Service). DNS provides the convenience of using Internet names instead of IP numbers.  This concept is especially inviting for intranets with young children, releasing you from having to have students type in obscure IP numbers to access servers on your intranet.</P>



<P>To achieve this you must edit a test file found in your Macintosh System folder called <B>Hosts</B>.  This is a file comes from Apple with all sorts of networking 'voodoo' in it.  Upon a closer reading you will see that all this 'voodoo' is commented out, in other words, it isn't a functioning <B>Hosts</B> file but is an explaination of what sort of information you must add to make your own <B>Hosts</B> listing.</P>

The format for this file is very straight forward, the most basic entry would be host name, (tab space), an A, (tab space), and then the IP address or;<BR><BR>


<B>puzzle.stvital.winnipeg.mb.ca&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	A	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;192.168.2.1</B><BR><BR>
The Web Server at 198.168.2.1 would answer to either of the following addresses or names;
<BR>
<BR>
<B>http://198.168.2.1<BR>
<BR>
 http://puzzle.stvital.winnipeg.mb.ca</b><BR>
<BR>
<P>Once you have a working Hosts file copy it into every computer's System Folder in your intranet.  If you don't have an original Hosts file create your own using TeachText or SimpleText.  To create the file add the listing of machine names and alias names you want for your network and save the file in the Mac's System folder, call the file Hosts and restart the Mac for the file to take effect.</P>

<TITLE>Smokescreen Introduction</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="ffffff">
<CENTER><H1>Smokescreen Introduction</H1></CENTER>

Smokescreen was established to be a network of people who are
doing something to about the horrors of tobacco use and nicotine addiction.
These people are activists.


<H3>Definition of an "Activist"</H3>

Within the Smokescreen framework, anyone who does <I>anything</i>, anthing
at all, that helps curb tobacco use is an activist.  You don't have
to
<A HREF="http://www.gateway-va.com/pages/news/tobac/0426pm1.htm">
dress up as a cigarette</a> and protest outside of Philip Morris to
be an activist.  Voting, asking a restaurant
to provide a smoke-free environment, avoiding a mutual fund because
it owns tobacco stocks, not eating Oreos because they profit a
tobacco company, writing to your child's principal
to demand tobacco-free schools, all of these are activist activities.<P>

<h3>How does this site work?</h3>

There are two types of visitors to this site.  The first type are those who are angry with
the tobacco industry and want to do something about it.  That "something"
is usually write a letter or attend an event.<P>

The second type of visitor is the tobacco control professional that
prepares the events and proposes the letters.  By filling in the basic
information of a letter-writing campaign (what the problem is, who the
letter should be written to, their address and fax), all that's left
is for the activist/visitor to do is write the body of the letter.<p>

<h3>Why do you need my e-mail address, and what happens when I log in?</h3>

Your e-mail address is your id -- it's the one thing that's guaranteed
to be unique (other than your social security number).  It's also
a way for you to receive information from Smokescreen, but only if
you request to receive that information.  We offer distribution
of daily news summaries and a weekly summary of upcoming national
and local events and legislation.<p>

The first time you log in, you'll be asked for some basic information
(address, etc.)  The only thing that's required is your state and zip code,
which is used to suggest the most appropriate letters for you to write.  For example,
if you live in Washington state, you might be presented with a suggestion to
write a thank-you letter to Washington's attorney general for suing the tobacco
companies.  Visitors from North Carolina would see a different item.

<H3>Does letter-writing really change anything?</H3>
Writing a letter or fax is one of the most powerful ways citizens
can actually <i>do</i> something about this terrible epidemic.<p>

Letters to Bill Clinton are nice, but are admittedly of limited value.
What's <b>much</b> more powerful is writing to state or local officials,
many of whom actually read each letter that's sent.  Letters to companies
are definitely read.  Which companies?  What should the letter say?
Tobacco control organizations post this information, so creating the
letter is very easy.  It is then faxed or sent, so you don't even have
to deal with printing out the letter if you don't want to.
<p>


<H3>But I'm not interested in changing anything, I just want information.</H3>

Then go someplace else.  Lots of information is here, but it's only here
to support the goal of radical, real change in tobacco use.  90% of smokers
start smoking before they're 18, yet many states have never once issued a
citation for selling tobacco to minors.  Vending machine checks produce
near identical results -- the only time a 14 year old can't get cigarettes
from a vending machine is when the machine is broken.
<P>
If you just want information, go somewhere else.  When you're ready to
help things change, please come back.

<H3>But I'm a government worker, I'm not allowed to change things.</H3>
Of course you are.  You have a first amendment right to lobby, and
you can do quite a bit on your own time.  And you can do a tremendous
about by leverage your work and getting information out to the right
people.<p>

If you're using your employer as a excuse why you've never written a letter
as an individual, now you have an opportunity to participate.

<h3>I work for a tobacco control organization.  Won't I lose my job if we
substantially reduce tobacco use?</H3>
It will be a good day when the tobacco control movement joins the
women's sufferage movement and the abolitionish movement in the
history books.

<h3>Who pays for all this, the faxes and equipment?</h3>
Private citizens who passionately believe that the tobacco industry
is a drug-pusher and one of the most evil institutions of the modern era.<p>

If you'd like to contribute to this cause, please contact me at <a href=
"mailto:tac@smokescreen.org">tac@smokescreen.org</a>.
(By the way, contributions are not tax-deductible.)  There are no
financial requests for contributions in the Smokescreen site, only the
request that you contribe of your time and energy to act.

<h3>Okay, I'm ready.  Now what?</h3>
<a href="/index.htm">Return to the login page</a>, type in your e-mail address,
fill out the registration form, and within 5 minutes you'll be
writing an anti-tobacco letter.

<H3>How do we get started?</H3>
First, you need to register yourself as an regular activist.  This will
also give you the opportunity to navigate the site as a regular visitor,
to see how the events and EZ-Letters (letter-writing campaign) work.<p>

You will then see a link titled <i>New Organization</I> in the Administration
menu. You can add your organization there.  When you are finished, click
on <i>Edit Organization</i>.  This will allow you to add events and
EZ-Letters.

<h3>What are EZ-Letters and events?</h3>

EZ-Letters are prepared letters that further our goals.  Because so much
of the mechanical work is done, it is very easy for site visitors to
personalize a letter and send it.  When you create an EZ-Letter, you
fill in the details of the problem, who the letter should go to, and
what it should say.  You should provide a sample letter for people
who don't want to personalize it.
<p>

The event calendar is an important way to share what your organization
is doing with other people from around the state.  It's very simple to
fill out the form, and the event automatically disappears after the
date has passed.

<h3>How do I get tobacco news summaries by e-mail?</h3>
Type in your e-mail address.  During the registration, there is a
question about the e-mail news and events service.  Choose the frequency
and content that you want.

<h1>Beware of funds holding Tobacco</h1>
Frustrated by discovering that many of the mutual funds I owned contained
tobacco stocks, I began to research a list of tobacco-free mutual funds.
After spending a few dozen hours pouring over N-30s (annual reports filed
with the SEC), the <A HREF="http://www.ama-assn.org">American
Medical Association</A> released a list of funds holding tobacco stocks, which
is used here.
<P>
Some of the funds have a link to a phone number where you can get more
information.
<P>
Unfortunately, mutual funds do not have a standard naming or reporting
convention, which mades certain database work difficult.  I have a
project that needs about 12-15 hours worth of work, ideal for an
intern or college student looking for a project.  Write me <A HREF=
"mailto:tac@smokescreen.org">tac@smokescreen.org</A> if you have
the interest.

<A NAME="1"></A><H2>UST's Stock Price Falls, New Product To Be Introduced</H2>

UST Inc.'s stock price dropped nearly 8 percent after the company announced that earnings for the fourth quarter would be lower than expected.  Financial analysts are growing more doubtful about the company's long-term future, according to the WALL STREET JOURNAL. In March, UST plans to introduce a new product, Copenhagen Long Cut, to compete with Conwood Co., which has attracted younger buyers with its Kodiak brand of smokeless tobacco.  UST's new brand will be easier to handle by inexperienced users. <P>

<A NAME="1"></A><H2>New Campaign For Tobacco-free Kids Ad Runs</H2>

     The Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids ran a new advertisement in the WASHINGTON POST today, carrying the headline, "Tobacco Companies Flooded Congress with Cash. What Did It Buy?"  The ad says, "In 1996, tobacco companies gave more money to politicians and their parties than any other industry in history.  Why?  They want Congress to block or compromise the FDA regulation protecting kids from tobacco marketing and sales."  It encourages citizens to ask their elected officials how much money they took and "whether they stand with tobacco lobbyists or America's children." <P>

     A federal judge ruled that former Brown & Williamson export manager Jerry Lui will not be extradited to Hong Kong to face smuggling charges.  Lui allegedly accepted $3 million in bribes related to smuggling Japanese cigarettes into China.  The judge ruled that Lui would not be extradited because his case may not be tried in Hong Kong by July 1st, when Hong Kong returns to Chinese rule.  The U.S. government may appeal the decision. <P>

<A NAME="1"></A><H2>CA Schools Frustrated By Delay In Accessing Prop 99 Funds</H2>

     California school districts are finding it difficult to access the $21.3 million in state funds available to them for tobacco control programs for high school students.  Through state measure Proposition 99, cigarette tax revenues are intended to fund tobacco control programs in schools, in addition to other tobacco control programs.  School districts, however, must file grants to receive the money for programs for grades 9 through 12, resulting in substantial delays in receiving funds.  Gayle Siebke of the Hemet Unified School District said, "It's frustrating.  The money is there, but with the paperwork, things aren't getting done." <P>

<A NAME="1"></A><H2>Wisconsin Rep Wants To Restrict Tobacco Billboards</H2>

     Wisconsin state Representative Spencer Black announced that he plans to introduce legislation this month which would ban all outdoor advertising of tobacco products throughout the state.  The representative said that he was partly inspired by a Madison, Wisconsin billboard for Camel cigarettes which featured a giant Christmas tree.  Black said, "The more immediate impetus was when I saw the billboard on one of the most prominent spots in my district which is trying to take advantage of children's love for Christmas to advertise this addictive habit."  The legislation will be similar to a Baltimore, Maryland law which was upheld in the U.S. Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia. <P>

<A NAME="1"></A><H2>Advocacy Institute Morning Briefing, 1/8/97</H2>

     TOBACCO MONEY & CONGRESS - A new ad from the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids draws attention to the tobacco industry's record-setting campaign contributions in 1996 (see News Summary).  The ad is headlined, "Tobacco Companies Flooded Congress With Cash.  What Did It Buy?" Just as this ad does, tobacco control advocates need to do all that we can to maintain interest in and stoke public outrage about special interest money and politics.  As the 105th Congress is just getting underway, this is a perfect time for tobacco control advocates to remind local political reporters about the role tobacco money played in electing these lawmakers and thus, in shaping the priorities and positions of the current Congress. Reporters are likely reporting about the overall character of the new Congress, new local representatives getting settled in Washington, and the new Congress'  legislative agenda - all stories in which information about tobacco money should be included. <P>
     Advocates should continue to keep the spotlight on tobacco money throughout this legislative session.  Be sure to provide reporters with the latest totals (including post-election filings) of your lawmakers' and their political party's acceptance of tobacco industry campaign contributions from the last election.  Tobacco money in politics is a critical issue, and one that really resonates with the public.  As a community, we cannot afford to let this be an issue that's raised only during elections. <P>
     48 HOURS COVERS TEENS AND SMOKING -- The news show 48 HOURS will air a program on teens, smoking, and tobacco industry marketing of cigarettes this Thursday, Jan. 9th, at 10pm ET, 11pm PT on CBS.  Set your VCRs! <P>

<A NAME="1"></A><H2>Swede Criticizes Smoking Danish Queen</H2>

     A Swedish columnist has angered the citizens of Denmark by criticizing their cigarette-smoking queen, Margrethe II, according to USA TODAY.  "She has a special lackey who follows after her with an ashtray," said Hagge Geigert, the columnist.  A Copenhagen, Denmark newspaper responded with a headline reading, "Mind your own business, Swedes." <P>

<A NAME="1"></A><H2>Tobacco Law Firms Complain About High School Seminar</H2>

     Three Boston law firms representing the tobacco industry complained that a seminar designed to educate public school students about the political and legal issues of tobacco control efforts was biased.  The seminar, sponsored by the Boston Bar Association, was called "Tobacco Wars."  The Association postponed the seminar in response to the law firms' complaints, and is considering a revised version.  Under consideration is removing a tobacco control activist from the presentation.  Lawyers from the firms Goodwin Procter & Hoar, Hill & Barlow, and Foley Hoag & Eliot said in a letter to the Association that presenters of the seminar are involved in lawsuits against the industry, and would not convey how the state benefits from cigarette sales as "a regulator, taxing authority, purveyor, and investor in tobacco." <P>
     Dr. Greg Connolly, director of the Massachusetts tobacco control program and a member of the panel presenting the seminar, criticized the lawyers' complaints, saying, "It's like having a lawyer for the Flat Earth Society tell English High School students they can't have a NASA representative speak.  This group of students is the very group that the tobacco industry is targeting with their $100 million campaign.  To silence us when we are trying to bring the truth to these kids is just unconscionable." <P>

<A NAME="1"></A><H2>Article Explores Possibility Of Anti-health Trend</H2>

     An article in the WASHINGTON POST examines the current trend against health recommendations to stop smoking, drink less alcohol and reduce dietary fat. Apart from the recent increase in cigar use, surveys show an increase in consumption of hard liquor and high- fat foods among the general population since about 1995. Some observers believe the trend signals a backlash against the move towards more healthy living.  Others disagree, saying liquor and cigar marketers are playing up the trend as a ploy to boost sagging sales. <P>
     Applied health science professor Ruth Engs of Indiana University believes American attitudes toward health follow cyclical paths.  Engs notes that the third major health movement in the nation's history started with the surgeon general's report against smoking, with the tobacco control movement gathering momentum over the 70s and 80s.  Engs believes that behaviors such as smoking cigars is a reaction against that trend, saying, "Pipes will come back after cigars - moderate smoking and drinking," and that this indicates "we are aiming for a balance" in personal health behaviors. <P>

<A NAME="1"></A><H2>Smokefree Law In Boulder Doesn't Hurt Bars And Restaurants</H2>

     A Boulder, Colorado law which banned smoking in all public places hasn't hurt bar and restaurant business since it was approved by voters in November of 1995. Sales tax receipts from "eating places," which include bars and restaurants, were up almost four percent between January and October of 1996.  The rate of growth for restaurants and bars was slower in 1996 than it was in 1995, but eating places fared better than other businesses during the same period. <P>

<A NAME="1"></A><H2>Advocacy Institute Morning Briefing, 1/7/97</H2>

RESPONDING TO THE "BACKLASH" -- The lead story in today's WASHINGTON POST HEALTH SECTION covers a familiar topic: the "backlash" against healthy living.  Stories like this one (and they are increasingly common), tend to categorize people into two groups: those who want to dictate other peoples' personal behavior and those who rebel against the first group.  This framing creates a challenge for health advocates to re-define the sides of the debate in a way that shifts the focus to include environmental factors and away from personal behavior choices. <P>
The cigar smoking fad is a perfect example.  Are more people smoking cigars simply because they're tired of being told what they can and can't do by others? Or, is there another explanation? Although it's always hard to pinpoint why people behave the way they do, Norman Sharp, the President of the Cigar Association of America, offers a hint.  In a letter discussing statistics on cigar sales, Sharp cited several reasons for the increased interest in cigars, among them: <P>
"CIGAR AFICIONADO magazine.  . This quarterly publication first came out in 1992 and has given cigar smokers a rallying point.  There is no overstating the importance which this glossy upscale publication has had on fostering the growth in cigar sales." <P>
So, instead of dividing people into those who dictate others' behavior and those who rebel, perhaps we should be defining the sides as `those who create marketing tactics to influence the behavior of others' and `those who don't think they should be allowed to do so with no restrictions.' <P>
[Note: The above quote was taken from a letter from Norman Sharp, President of the Cigar Association of America, Inc., addressed to Bettina Lanyi of the Advocacy Institute, sent via fax on December 23, 1996.] <P>

     Hostages being held by guerrillas in the Japanese Ambassador's residence in Lima, Peru requested establishing smoking and nonsmoking areas after the International Red Cross handed out cigarettes in addition to food, water and clothing.

     NEW PASSWORDS AND IDs FOR SCARCNET - We've heard from a few people who haven't received their new passwords and user IDs for the Web-based SCARCNet and are concerned that they're going to be left behind.  Not to worry!  We're not handing out passwords and IDs quite yet; we're still working on getting the new SCARCNet up and running.  Once the new network is up, we'll let SCARCNetters know and we'll make sure you have your password and ID so you can access the system! <P>
     SMOKEFREE SPACE -- Think that access to smokefree space isn't an important issue?  A news report from Peru quotes one of the freed hostages as saying that the nonsmoking hostages insisted on setting up separate smoking and nonsmoking areas in the compound in which they were being held (see News Summary). Kind of makes establishing smokefree restaurants seem like the least we could do, doesn't it? <P>

<A NAME="1"></A><H2>RJR Says Plaintiffs' Lawyers Are Misleading The Media</H2>

     RJR accused plaintiffs' lawyers representing the state of Minnesota in its Medicaid lawsuit against tobacco companies of leaking internal tobacco industry documents to the press and misleading the press about the nature of the documents. <P>
     In a memo to the news media, RJR spokesperson Peggy Carter said, "When put in the context of issues and debates about smoking raised in the scientific, public health and government communities, RJR documents clearly indicate that the company has been responsive to these groups' concerns. . . .  We should be applauded for this history of responsiveness, not berated for documents that reflect it." <P>
     The company produced examples of memos that have been leaked that were "taken out of their historical and corporate context" and "made to sound inflammatory." For example, a 1973 document suggesting the company reconsider its position on youth smoking leaked to the press had the word "DRAFT" at top of the first page, which the company said was omitted in copies provided to reporters.  In addition, there is no indication that the document was circulated or forwarded to management, according to RJR. <P>
     The company also produced internal documents that it believes plaintiffs' lawyers might leak to the press in the future, and provided background information on the materials.  For example, a 1973 memorandum, "Effects of Ammonia and Its Salts on Smoke Quality," discussed ammonia's effect of "freeing" nicotine in cigarette smoke. <P>
To explain the document, RJR counsel Daniel Donahue said, "Nicotine research has been conducted for literally centuries in medical and public health labs on virtually every continent.  There has been no mystery - or denial - by the scientific or the tobacco community that nicotine plays a role in what makes smoking enjoyable. . . .  The tobacco industry should be expected to want to understand nicotine in its products, just as the egg industry should want to understand cholesterol, and the coffee and soft-drink manufacturers, caffeine.  We should be expected to follow the scientific literature, and explore related research - not berated for documents that indicate we did so." <P>
     Minnesota Attorney General Hubert Humphrey said, "The tobacco industry's allegations of leaking and modifying documents are completely false and truly bizarre.  We have only cited public documents that were filed as evidence in court." <P>

<A NAME="1"></A><H2>"natural" Cigs Do Not Provide Healthier Choice</H2>

     An article about additive-free cigarettes questions whether the so-called "natural" cigarettes are genuinely less damaging to smokers' health than conventional cigarettes.  While additives found in major cigarette brands may be harmful, their absence does not produce a risk-free product.  According to spokesperson Diane Maple of the American Lung Association, smoking any cigarettes is unhealthy by definition, since smokers inhale foreign substances into their lungs. <P>

     Nicotine and cocaine appear to stimulate the brain in the same way, according to a new study by Swiss drug company Glaxo-Wellcome, published in the January 3rd issue of SCIENCE magazine.  While previous studies have found that the two drugs act on the same parts of the brain, new research performed on rats found that nicotine and cocaine stimulate those areas in nearly identical patterns.  Neal Benowitz, a nicotine researcher at the University of California at San Francisco, said the research supports the idea that although nicotine and cocaine have different effects, they are very similar drugs. <P>

<A NAME="1"></A><H2>Hemp May Supplant Farmers' Tobacco Crops</H2>

     A coalition of scientists, farmers, and business people advocate legalizing the hemp plant, which can be used to produce paper, cloth, food, and other products. Currently, hemp is illegal because the non-industrial variety of the plant produces marijuana.  Tobacco farmers are also interested in hemp, as an alternative to tobacco. Kentucky farmer Andy Graves, who believes hemp could supplant or replace tobacco as a major crop for the state, noted, "We'd like not to be so dependent on one crop, which may as well have a skull and crossbones on it. We're willing to try something new to save livelihoods." <P>

<A NAME="1"></A><H2>Advocacy Institute Morning Briefing, 1/3/97</H2>

DEFENDING SMOKING BANS -- Two stories about restaurant smoking bans are in today's news summary.  The first is a typical story about how the Michigan Restaurant Association fears that a ban on smoking will hurt their business.  The second is a letter-to-the-editor responding to similar fears in Massachusetts. <P>
The two stories raise an issue that frequently comes up when restaurant smoking bans are enacted: how can you accurately determine what the effect has been on business?  Opponents to smoking bans (such as the Michigan Restaurant Association) tend to compile subjective evidence that can be manipulated to reach a desired outcome.  Frequently, for example, restaurant managers are surveyed to determine whether or not they "think" business has gone up or down. <P>
Fortunately, proponents of clean indoor air regulations have more reliable data to support their case.  For example, as the Massachusetts letter cites, most states keep track of sales tax data that empirically show how business has been affected.  Congratulations to Ed Sweda for a well-written letter that not only refutes bad arguments from the Massachusetts Restaurant Association but also serves as a good model for advocates in other states who need to refute similar evidence. <P>

<A NAME="1"></A><H2>Canadian Ad Agency Calls Tobacco Ads A "moral Issue"</H2>

     Murad Communications, a Canadian outdoor advertising company, has announced that it will no longer accept tobacco ads on its outdoor spaces throughout Canada.  Murad President Michael Chesney said, "Quite simply as a moral issue, tobacco is far too addictive and harmful to promote just for the sake of profit."  The agency's decision comes in anticipation of a bill that could ban all forms of tobacco advertising in Canada except in adult magazines. The bill is expected to pass in early February. <P>

<A NAME="1"></A><H2>European Parliament To Consider Broad Tobacco Controls</H2>

     The European Commission has drafted a broad tobacco control plan for the European Parliament to consider in 1997, according to FDA WEEK.  The plan includes measures to declare nicotine addiction a "dependency" that could be addressed in public health programs, reduce the maximum tar content of cigarettes, change cigarette labeling and encourage European Union members to increase cigarette taxes.  While the outline calls for limits on tobacco advertising and sponsorship, it does not include a total ban.  Like the FDA's regulations, the outline emphasizes preventing children from starting to smoke. <P>

<A NAME="1"></A><H2>Editorial</H2>

     In his column in the WALL STREET JOURNAL, Albert Hunt endorses a congressional investigation of campaign financing abuses in the 1996 election.  Regarding soft money, he argues that the investigation needs to focus on more than foreign contributions: "Legislation cracking down on [foreign contributions] could be passed by the end of this month, and it would barely make a dent in the corruption of the system.  Most of the soft- money contributions come from the tobacco interests, the communications industry and trial lawyers, not from shady Indonesians." <P>

<A NAME="1"></A><H2>Editorial</H2>

     In a letter to the editor in the BOSTON BUSINESS JOURNAL, Ed Sweda of the Tobacco Control Resource Center refutes a recent report by the Massachusetts Restaurant Association (MRA) that showed a decline in restaurant and bar jobs as a result of mandatory smokefree restaurant ordinances.  Sweda points out several major flaws in the report, noting that certain categories of restaurants that had significant job increases were excluded from the study. The MRA study also excluded restaurants' recorded sales tax data, which increased by 13 percent in the time period studied.  Sweda responds to a JOURNAL editorial on the MRA study which stated, "If you tell a certain percentage of the population that they're no longer welcome at your establishment, don't be surprised if business correspondingly drops by about the same percentage."  In his letter, Sweda wrote, "You seem to forget, however, that smoke-free laws do not bar smokers from restaurants or bars; they are perfectly welcome to come to eat and drink there, as long as they refrain from the voluntary act of smoking during the time they are there.  On the other hand, people with asthma or other breathing disorders are effectively barred from eating and drinking in smoke-filled establishments." <P>

Nicotine, according to the Clinton administration, is a mean and nasty drug that, it says, is more addictive than heroin and cocaine.  And now this allegedly lecherous substance is referred to as medicine and endorsed by the American Cancer Society, no less!  It's all in the spin, isn't it?  It all depends on your perspective," Blackard writes. <P>

AMERICAN HEALTH magazine has put out a list of the healthiest cities for women (see News Summary). Interestingly, one of the criteria used by the magazine in compiling the list was whether or not each city restricted smoking in public.  This list confirms that smokefree public places are more and more mainstream and gives all cities yet another reason to adopt smokefree policies.  If your city is not on this list, perhaps a letter to the editor of your local paper could point out one thing the city could do to be included next time: create more smokefree air space! <P>

<A NAME="1"></A><H2>Tobacco Stocks Did Well In 96; Forecast Not As Bright For 97</H2>

     A WALL STREET JOURNAL analysis of stocks discusses tobacco stocks' past and future performance.  Stocks rose significantly after the November 5th election that kept Republicans in control of Congress, with Philip Morris gaining 26 percent in the fourth quarter of the year and tobacco processor Standard Commercial rising by 64 percent in the same time period.  The rise in tobacco stocks made tobacco the third top-performing industry group in the fourth quarter of the year.  "After the election, there's not a lot of value in bashing the industry . . . .  you're clearly not going to have a federal excise-tax increase," commented David Adelman, tobacco analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds. <P>
     Adelman cautioned, however, that tobacco stocks may not continue to perform as well in the coming year: "There's a lot on the plate next year in terms of litigation and in all likelihood, it's not all going to go the industry's way." <P>

<A NAME="1"></A><H2>Report Cites Clean Indoor Air In "healthy" Cities</H2>

     A report in AMERICAN HEALTH magazine considered restrictions on smoking when compiling its list of the ten healthiest cities for women.  Honolulu, Hawaii; Columbia, Missouri; and Rochester, Minnesota were noted for their restrictions on public smoking.  In addition to cleanliness of a city's air and water, the report considered the number of doctors, psychologists and dietitians; the quality of hospital gynecology departments; the number of working moms, the rate of violent crimes; and the quality of parks and schools. <P>

<A NAME="1"></A><H2>Article Profiles Center For Tobacco-free Kids</H2>

     An article in the LOUISVILLE COURIER-JOURNAL profiled the Center for Tobacco-Free Kids.  "Somebody did call it a Tobacco Institute for the good guys," said the Center's President, William Novelli. The group is focused on kids and tobacco, although it also works on excise taxes, secondhand smoke, and international tobacco control issues.  The Tobacco Institute's Walker Merryman said his group is taking the new organization, with its budget of $32 million over the next five years, seriously:  "There's not been any effort like this. "You come to the table with a stack of chips that big, you're going to get some respect." <P>
     Novelli, who comes to the Center from his own public relations firm, Porter/Novelli and from a stint as executive vice president of the international relief organization CARE, cites two major reasons for taking on tobacco.  One, he said, is that the tobacco issue offers a big payoff in improved public health:  "If you want to work on something big, this is it. . . .  The other reason is the tobacco industry is an inviting target. . . . They're the last of the evil empire." <P>

<I>The travels and trials of Kath (aka Tac) and Paul in Peru</I>
</CENTER>
<p>
Now that we're back from our adventures, we can reflect on the journey and our experiences there.  We also want to add a guest book for others with an interest in Peru to say "hola"!
<p>
We now have most of our journal on line, but it's somewhat long and we weren't quite sure how to break it down.  Currently it is all in 
<a href="/jungle/t.htm">one big file</a>.  The <a href="photos.htm">photos</a> of our trip are posted, but somewhat disorganized as well.  We hope to re-do the photos so that the files are smaller, but this is what we've got for the first round.
<H2>Introduction</H2>
For those of you visiting the site who don't know us -- thanks!  My name is Kathleen Tacelosky (aka "Tac").  From August through December of 1996 my husband Paul and I went to Peru to gather data for my doctoral dissertation.  I am studying the effectiveness of second language education in Peru among indiginous peoples.  In Peru, Spanish is a second language to the Shipibo and other cultures there.  
<h2>Contacting us</H2>
I can be reached via e-mail at <a href="mailto:kat@uta.edu">kat@uta.edu</A>.  Paul can also be reached at that same address.
<P>
<h2>Common Questions</h2>

<h3>Did you like it?  Are you glad you went?</H3>
Yes.  Yes.

<h3>Favorite and least favorite parts of the trip?</H3>
Turtle hunting.  Mosquito bites.

<h3>Advice for other travellers</H3>

<H2>Brief Personal History</H2>
<P>I grew up as an Army brat, moving frequently and changing schools every
2 years or so.  I was a good kid -- altar boy, Eagle Scout, good student.
Which translates to a fairly unexciting childhood in a loving family.
<P>
I went to <A HREF="http://www.vill.edu">Villanova University</A> to study
computer science in 1980.  Alas, Villanova did not have a computer science
program back then <I>[Historical note: The IBM PC didn't even exist then]</I>,
so I studied Electrical Engineering with a computer concentration.  My
first projects were done on punch cards.
<P>
My claim to fame at Villanova was writing a computer dating program (DateGame),
which ended up being so popular it used more resources than the entire
mechanical engineering department.
<P>
After graduating from Villanova in
1984, I moved from the Philadelphia area to San Diego, where I founded
MicroTac Software, originally doing freelance programming and then
developing and marketing language translation tools.  MicroTac grew from
<A HREF="tacgaret.htm">2 guys</A> in 1988 to 24 people by 1994, when we
merged with <A HREF="http://www.globalink.com">Globalink</A>.   I moved
to the DC area, and after one year of being president of a 100+ person
public company, I decided to hand the reins over to someone who would
enjoy Globalink's challenges a little more.</P>
<P>
So now I'm back at square one, waking  up in the morning, brewing
coffee, and working on my computer in my sweats until lunchtime.
Although I don't mind working alone, being relatively new to the city, it
would be nice to work in an environment where I meet more people
for social opportunities.  If the straight women in Dupont Circle were
as friendly as the gay men, I'd have a great social life! <P>

</B><P>
Hello all,
<P>
        We are currently in Yarinacocha, Peru at the Summer 
Institute of Linguistics (SIL) compound.  For those of you 
who failed to receive our letter before we left, Yarinacocha 
is halfway between Iquitos and Cuzco along the Ucayali 
river.  There is an oxbow lake here that we can see from 
just outside our house.  There is a map in the May issue of 
National Geographic magazine.  We are currently living on 
the compound of the Summer Institute of Linguistics in a two 
bedroom/two bath <A HREF="/jungle/pics/house.jpg">house</A> of wood and elevated a few feet 
on stilts.  It is much nicer than our pad back in Arlington 
and the scenery is much more interesting.  We have been 
spending the past week preparing to make our first jungle 
trip to visit two tribes near the Brazilian border.  The two 
tribes are the Amahuaca and the Yaminahua.  Both groups have 
a few villages near the Peruvian air force base at Puerto 
Breu.  We will take a jungle flight to a village on the 
upper reaches of the Ucayali River near where the Inuya 
River joins the Ucayali.  Tac and Pat will survey that 
village then we will fly to the area near Puerto Breu after 
which we will travel along the river visiting villages until 
we call for a plane to pick us back up at Breu. 
<P>
This should all take about 2 weeks so we have been trying to 
get logistics worked out (camping gear, mosquito nets, pots 
and pans, etc.).  After we return from that trip, we will be 
at Yarinacocha to regroup/recover/take a shower/eat some 
M&Ms before setting out on a series of trips by boat up and 
down the Ucayali River to survey the Shipibo villages.  That 
should occupy the remainder of our time in Peru.
<P>
        The people here are very hospitable.  We have been the 
toast of Yarinacocha largely on the basis of Pat's fame in 
this region.  Pat worked for about 20 years with the 
Machigenga people who live upriver (south) of here and has a 
great deal of experience here in Peru. Everything takes 
about thirty times as long to do in Peru as it does in the 
States.  For example, the one hour foto place in Pucallpa 
(the nearest city) took three days because the power was 
out.  Not really a surprise actually.  Pat has really been 
great in terms of helping us work through things and making 
preparations.  We have had some difficulties.  The first day 
we were in Lima, I dropped my camera in a fit of 
carelessness and knocked out my light meter.  We tried to 
get it fixed but couldn't  (big surprise).  After we arrived 
in Yarinacocha, Tac's camera stopped forwarding film.  We 
have borrowed a spare Cannon AE-1 from Willie Gesch who 
bought it for $70 from a missionary who was going home.  It 
was the steal of the century (camera body, and four very 
nice lenses including a couple of different macros).  He 
told us to take and use it as much as we like.  
<P>
        There are ants everywhere here.  In the tree outside 
our house, on the counter inside our house, and even in 
Tac's backpack.  There is also a healthy dose of other 
wildlife.  Frogs, lizards and birds in abundance just on the 
grounds of the SIL compound.    
<P>

<B>12 September 1996
</B><P>
Hello world,
<P>
We are still here in Yarinacocha making the final preparations for 
our first river trip to the Yaminahua groups along the Rio Yurua.  
We will be leaving as early next week as we can.  We are trying to 
share a flight with a Korean missionary going to the same area in 
an effort to stay under budget.  Overall, it is a logistical 
nightmare.  We have been helped immensely by Wade ten Bensel, the 
SIL flight coordinator, with scheduling jungle flights and 
gathering gear.  Our trip to the Yaminahua has been scaled back 
and we won't be going to visit the Amahuaca.  Thereore, the trip
will only be about a week long.  Things are beginning to really 
come together.  We spent this morning buying gas and kerosene to 
send upriver (south) for our trip to the Shipibo along the Rio 
Ucayali that we will hopefully embark upon on the first or second 
of October.  A man (Herman) from the village in which we will land
is going home today and has agreed to take some heavy gear so as 
to cut down on the weight in the plane (the plane can only carry 
about 430 kilos and the three of us weigh 186 kilos).  Pray that 
we see our $120 worth of food and $90 worth of gas and kerosene in 
Caco when we arrive on 1 October.  
<P>
We have acquired jungle hammocks where we will sleep while we are 
out and have bought Primus stoves which are the South American 
answer to the Coleman stove.  Primus operate on kerosene which is 
why we will be carrying kerosene.  We plan to eat tuna, rice, 
pasta and some canned fruits and veggies we sent in the package 
that went out today.  We dont know why fruits and vegetables 
aren't available in the areas where we are going, but thats what
Pat told us.  A lot will become clear to us as we go.  Around here 
bananas, mangos, and lemons are in large supply.  We also found 
out that crushing up Papaya seeds and swallowing them makes a very 
unpleasant environment for amoeba to live it.  Since we're not
looking to host any, we're planning to try it.  They are said to
taste disgusting, but with a Hershy kiss chaser (we're rationing
the small bag we brought from the States) we think we can manage.
<P>
<P>
<P>
 <B>9/30/1996
</B><P>
Hi Everybody!
<P>
I write to you with my feet plunged in a bucket full of
ice water.  It's the only relief we can find from our
30-40 mosquito bites on each leg.  Yes, we're back from
our first jungle trip.
<P>
We visited San Pablo and Dorado, two communities where
Yaminahua is spoken.  Less than twenty years ago the
Yaminahua were not living in communites, but spread out
in the jungle, living in fear and being feared, killing
and being killed.  Pat Davis reported that the
Machiguenga, who she lived and worked with for twenty
years in the 60s and 70s were very much afraid of being
killed by the Yaminahua.  In 1996 we found friendly,
open-hearted people, most of whom spoke enough Spanish
to communicate with us, living in communities and going
to school.   One village leader even took Paul on a <A HREF="mono.html">monkey hunt</A>.  In San Pablo we stayed in the house of a
linguist who is in the United States being treated for cancer.
Pat called it the "Hilton on the Yurua" (the river)
because she didn't want us to think every place would
be that nice.  They had chairs with backs, tables, and
even a 15 gallon drum that when flipped upside down and
hooked up with a spiggot made a refreshing shower.
They also had two other things in the village that we
would find out later in Dorado made all the difference
in the world in their quality of life - wells for water
and latrines.  The people in San Pablo were pretty
healthy.  In Dorado, using the river for everything
from bathroom to laundry room made the conditions in
their community deplorable.  It was very sad,almost
everyone was sick.  (We boiled and strained the water
and it was still very gross.  I drank only enough to
stay alive and when we got home last night drank a few
liters to make up for it.)  We surveyed teachers,
leaders and villagers about education, health and
language attitudes.  I feel pretty good about what we
accomplished.  Some of the people had limited Spanish
and we had a hard time getting inexperienced
interpreters to tell us what the person being
interviewed was saying and not adding their own
opinion. The most straight forward questions we can be
pretty sure about though.
<P>
We found ourselves finishing up our surveys rather
quickly in Dorado so we visited the school on Tuesday.
After we realized that no real teaching was going on
(the teacher was not finished his training and hadn't
yet learned that you're supposed to explain stuff to
students not just get them to copy into their
notebooks) and our butts could take no more of sitting
on tree trunks (the students had chairs which were all
taken up even though several people were absent, but we
won't go there), we decided to leave.  Pat, who had
arrived late because she was running a medical clinic
from our porch, hung in until the bitter end of math
class.  Paul and I on the other hand, took a nice walk
into the jungle.  The real primary, virgin, uncut
jungle.  It was wonderful.  Teaming with life.  So much
activity.  And so dense.  We got stung by a colony of
reddish ants and I got stung by one of the ones that
really burns and stings and then it goes away after
about  5 minutes (Paul had gotten it on his jungle hunt
with Juan days before.  See below for a lengthy
description.)  We took pictures of many species of
lizards and some spiders, a big buttress tree, and even
some community spiders who all live together in a
barrio.  Paul brought back some armored millipedes that
excrete a toxin that smells like almond extract.
Unfortunately they died on the plane ride back to
Yarinacocha.  Bummer.  Paul wanted to observe their
behavior.
<P>
One afternoon a guy brought us a papaya.  He wanted to
sell/exchange it for a pen.  I felt bad exchanging a
pen, especially a pen I had gotten free, for a papaya.
But we enjoyed the Papaya and the guy was thrilled to
have a pen.  We also paid the children who collected
water for us with pens, laundry soap and salt.  It's
hard to evaluate how many trips to the river with a
bucket of water on your head constitute a pen and how
many constitute all the salt we had left in our shaker,
but we determined four buckets was a pen and one bucket
was a little salt.  We gave pictures from an old
calendar to people who participated in the interviews.
Wednesday, the day we were scheduled to leave, was the
only day we woke up to rain.  I was so scared we
weren't going to get to fly because of the weather.  I
was so ready for a shower and we didn't have anything
else to do in Dorado.  Lots of people, especially women
came and sat around to chat with us. A lot of  their
babies were sick and Pat had distributed a lot of
medicine in the village.  One sick baby with no
underwear of any kind had diarrhea right on his mother
right on our porch.  It was disgusting, but no one was
phased by it.  Anyway, that morning, it just rained and
rained.  Pat radioed Yarina every hour starting at
7:00 am.  They kept saying call back in an hour.  We
prayed a lot during that time.  Finally at 11:00 they
said the plane was leaving at 11:30 to come and get us
in Breu (a military base near the border of Brazil), a
"two hour" canoe trip from Dorado.  We moved into
action.  Well, the river between Dorado and Breu was
very shallow in some parts, had lots of fallen logs,
and it took over three hours.  Once we had to get out
and push to get out over a log; once we had to get and
out and walk on the bank while the others pushed, and
several times we had to duck under branches.  We
finally got to Breu (after the plane, which we had seen
overhead.)  We docked the canoe and looked at the bank
- it was a steep and muddy incline which we and our
stuff had to get up.  It was a joke.  We tried carrying
stuff - we had to stop mid-way.  The mud was actually
more like clay and we were just slipping all over the
place.  What a hilarious sight  - these three gringos
slipping up the bank.  The military guard was telling
us to take our shoes off, but too late, we were in mud
boots by then (the first time our Nike sandals failed
us!)  The soldiers had to first take our stuff up the
incline for us, then pull and even push us so we could
make it.  The SIL pilot stood on the top laughing and
wishing for a video camera.  We were all laughing.  We
used our drinking water (if you call it that) to wash
off our hands and feet.  We wrapped our sandals up in
our rain ponchos (oh, did  I mentioned it rained about
half the way in the boat?) and flew home barefoot.  I
always have to sit in the back because I'm the lightest
and this time it was cargo next to me.  When I sat down
in the plane I was so relieved and relaxed that it hit
me like a ton of bricks how tired I was.  It was a
wonderful ride home and our house was like a palace to
us.  A shower never felt so good!  Some nice folks, Kay
and Willie Gesch, invited us for dinner (good thing,
too because we had no food here.) Except for a middle
of the night itching fest from our mosquito bites, we
slept very well.
<P>
<P>
<B>Friday, 4 October 1996 - Sempaya, on the Rio Ucayali</B>
<P>
	We finally made it to Sempaya yesterday morning after one failed attempt to come on Wednesday.  On Wednesday, we got down to the hangar and weighed in at 140 kilos but could only carry 66 kilos because we had 5 passengers (the three of us and two Shipibo interpreters).  Float planes land on the rivers surface and thus have to fly lighter than planes designed for grass strips.  Artemio Pacaya and Fernando Munoz have been given a paid leave from their jobs at the Bilingual Print Shop (run by the Ministry of Education) in order to serve as our interpreters.  Artemio used to be a bilingual school teacher in the region we are in and Fernando is from one of the communities we will visit. 
<P>
	Anyway, in order to get all of our gear and ourselves to Sempaya, we sent 91 kilos of our cargo to Iparia, downriver from Sempaya (see map), on a plane being chartered by some people from the village of Iparia.  Wade Ten Bensel, the flight coordinator and miracle worker, could put our cargo on their plne because there is a grass strip in Iparia and the people were carrying very little cargo.  Our plan was to fly to Caco and drop off Fernando (72 Kilos) and his and Artemio's luggage, thus making room for the rest of our gear.  Then, Artemio, Pat, Tac and myself would fly to Iparia where we would pick up the gear from the previous days flight and we would all fly to Sempaya.  Artemio would make introductions to the villagers in Sempaya after we had unloaded all our gear.  After having completed that, Artemio would then fly back to Caco where they and our boat driver (Arturo) would leave to travel back up to Sempaya (an 8 hour boat trip)with our gear which we had sent up from Pucallpa back in September with a villager from Caco named Herman.  In this way, we could have all our gear in Sempaya and be surveying Sempaya while the boat with the remainder of the gear spent two days travelling upriver and we would not have to blow two days in travel.  It sounds like a typically Tacelosky type of plan, but it is what you have to do in the jungle. [All those years of Tac-type planning prepared me like I could have never guessed.  The amazing thing is that it all worked and we and our gear made it to the right places at the right time. -kt]
<P>
	At Sempaya, the village came down and hauled all our stuff up to the Inicial (Peru's answer to Kindergarten) where we would be staying.  Artemio introduced us and what we wanted to do  and a meeting was scheduled for later that evening where Pat and Tac would present their intentions.  During the day we found someone to cook chicken and platanos (cooking bananas) for us since we had had to leave some of our food behind because of weight restrictions.  We had decided tat it would be necessary to interview 20 comuneros (villagers):  5 young men, 5 young women, 5 older men, and 5 older women.  In addition, Pat and Tac have to interview the villager leader, the school director and the health promotor.  During lunch, Pat questioned the logic of interviewing so many comuneros.  Tac and I were surprised because we thought this issue had been laid to rest back in Yarinacocha.  I reasserted my reasoning from a statistical point of view and Pat countered that what was more desireable was to capture the diversity within the language group (Shipibo).  I then countered by saying that without good samples from each community, it would be impossible to know what that diversity was.  Our empty soup bowls were on the table and we had placed all the chicken bones in one, the leftover platanos in another, and the third was left with nothing but broth.  I told Pat that sampling only 8 comuneros in each village would be like drawing an eighth of an ounce out of each bowl.  We can see that they are different - one has bones and broth, one has platanos and broth and the third has only broth - but such a small sample would probably yield only broth.[I'm not sure that Paul's object lesson , however poignant, was appreciated by Pat. -kt]  I then strssed the importance of choosing the communities carefully that we will visit to make sure that they differ in some obvious and interesting ways.  Pat and Tac had done this with the help of Artemio and Fernando before we ever left.  This would prove to be a recurring issue throughout the rest of the trip.
<P>
	Prior to lunch I had explored a trail behind the school and found that it went to the village cemetery.  I took Tac back there after lunch because some of the crosses had writing and part of what she is looking for are examples of print in the environment.  On the way back we found some small frogs (probably in the genus Eleutherodactylus) in a platano chacra (agricultural field).  Pretty cool!
<P>
	Sempaya is a large, well established village.  It recently moved nearer the river as the river continues to retreat to the West (the bend of the river chops away at the far bank, laying down new bank from silt on the near bank).  They have a generator wich runs sound systems televisions (no stations anywhere near) and street lights.  One woman came by to sell pottery (very nice) the most expensive of which was 10 soles (about $4.03) for who knows how many hours of work.  The meeting Thursday night went off without a hitch.  The way this works is that someone in the village draws a croquis (map) of the village complete with the names of the head of each household.  We then number these and place numbers in a plastic container.  The village leader then draws out the numbers and we choose people from the numbered houses.  In this way we achieve as close to a random sample as we can (some people refuse at the meeting and we must draw again).  I took pictures of Tac and Pat and the village leader (Moises) and the entire crowd was enthralled by the electronic flash.
<P>
<B>Saturday, 5 October 1996 - Sempaya</B>
<P>
	Yesterday was excellent.  A sunny day, very hot.  I boiled some water (a critical duty) since we had to leave our water at the hangar (an unfortunate reality).  I went to the woods after boiling the water and saw agoutis (small rodents) and some major lizards (mainly teiids and iguanids) and pretty much tired myself out and turned myself around (it is real easy to get lost in the jungle).  We had leftover chicken and yuca (manioc) stew for lunch and Tac and Pat went out to do their afternoon surveys.  The morning surveys went well but people were not where they said they would be in the afternoon.  Tac is conducting surveys twice as fast as Pat.  One old woman ran away from Pat.  Evidently people are afraid that we are going to take them away.  Away to where I do not know, but away at any rate.  Moises, the village leader, came by last night and was interviewed.  A very gracious and intelligent man.  He seems very committed to his village and to his people.  He also sees education as the way out from under the yoke of the patrones (people who give the indians things in return for work.  Of course, they never tell the indians when they have worked it off and then just keep giving them things so that the indians never get out from under the debt.  South American answer to slavery).  The village owns three boats with peques (small engines named for the sound that they make) and wants to purchase a diesel powered barge so that they can ship their goods to Pucallpa and better control prices.  
<P>
	The young people were supposed to come around this morning to be interviewed but none showed.  Miguel, the guy who gets our water from the river (20 minute walk away, if you do not stop to rest, which I do), came by and offered to go around with Pat and Tac and make a way for them and this seemed to improve things.  Also, at 4:30 this morning, the village loudspeaker came on urging the people to be sure and meet with the visiting delegation from ILV (Instituto Linguistico de Verano) if they were supposed to.  This would not have been so bad if it had not been followed by loud music until 6:00 a.m.
<P>
	Last night it rained a lot.  We went out and took a shower as the rain fell off the eaves of the Inicial.  It was wonderful, but cold.  The morning was nice and cloudy and cool.  The clouds look as if they are going to break.  Too much to hope for a full day of cool weather.  Tac wants me to take a picture of Jose Campos (at his request) and he also has some bows and arrows he wants to sell.  Some women want us to buy a skirt.  It supposedly takes a month to make one.  The skirts are embroidered with intricate geometric designs.  
<P>
	Later in the day - I went to the cocha (lake) nearest the village.  I noosed a lizard on the way.  The lake was pretty ugly but full of fish.  The area around here is in a number of successional stages depending on how long ago it was that the river moved through.  Artemio and Fernando arrived today and we had lunch with them.  Tac returned from a survey with bad news.  She had gotten to the health portion of the survey (how many children do you have, how many died, do you boil water, etc) and the woman asked her why she was asking all these questions.  The woman said she had heard that 2 white people had killed some Shipibo in Caco.  She supposedly heard it on the radio and thought we had come under the guise of doing a study so that we could find out where they live and come back later and kill them.  Tac told her it was preposterous and that it was hurtful to perpetuate such untruths about innocent visitors.  When Artemio and Fernando heard about this, they said that they would look into it.  Fernando radioed Caco (most villages have radios) and found out that nobody in Caco had been killed (big shock).  Fernando then went down to the house where she had run into trouble and found out that the woman who we had been paying to cook for us had been spreading the rumor.  Pretty ungrateful to take our money and then make our lives miserable with lies.  
<P>
<B>Sunday, 6 October 1996 - Sempaya (still)</B>
<P>
	What little charm this place ever had for me has evaporated.  As it turns out, a big problem is that we do not walk around in a group.  I go off by myself looking for frogs and lizards and Pat and Tac go off interviewing different comuneros.  The fact that I go into the forest by myself was on of the precipating factors in the reception we have received.  After hearing this, we all went out into the village and walked around.  Tac and I went to Jose Campos' house and looked over his bows and arrows.  The bows are made of shungos (ironwood).  They are very beautiful.  He let me shoot a fishing arrow at a palm tree stump.  I only missed by a few inches.  Things got better in the afternoon for the interviewing after Fernando started going along.  Pat got frustrated, gave up interviewing altogether and handed her surveys to Artemio to finish.  As a result, Artemio interviewed Jose Campos' son, again. 
<P>
<B>Sunday, 6 October 1996 - Fatima</B>
<P>
	It rained in the afternoon and put off our departure from Sempaya.  It only took about 45 minutes to travel downriver from Sempaya to Fatima.  Fatima is much closer to the water and the mosquitos are much worse.  When we arrived the bilingual teacher and the village jefe spoke to us.  As it turns out, people here are more afraid than those in Sempaya.  A meeting of the village was scheduled for 7:00 p.m.  It was disastrous.  All we wanted to do was to determine whether they would participate and, if they were willing, conduct the lottery.  One guy said that if we came in the name of education we should be welcomed by the village.  He then went on to say that it is important for children to learn to speak Spanish well because they cannot interact with mestizos (all nonindigenous Peruvians) without knowing Spanish.  This was not good for the purposes of the study, but it was not disatrous.  What followed was.  Pat got up and explained the theory behind the effectiveness of mother-tongue bilingual education and a number of the reasons why his thinking was flawed.  Now people know exactly what our philosophical bias is and Tac and I hope that it has not biased the replies of the vilagers.  After 1.5 hours, we finally had permission to conduct interviews, but not without conditions.  The people ellected not to participate in the lottery.  Instead, anyone willing to be interviewed would come to the school and wait while everyone is interviewed.  They think we are pelacaras (literally "face peelers) and that is why they are afraid.  
<P>
<B>Monday, 7 October 1996 - Fatima</B>
<P>
	Everything is as bad as I feared.  Six men showed up at 8:00 a.m.  One is the jefe, one is the health promotor and there are four communeros.  Pat set out bags on the floor on which they could sit which placed them within a few feet of the people being interviewed.  She said it was a Machiguega custom and that it was all she knew.  Obviously, the Machiguenga had never conducted objective surveys of villagers.  Tac is curretly interviewing the jefe and a man in a striped shirt (I later found out it was his son) is throwing his two cents in whenever he feels compelled.  Things could only be worse if the village held a meeting and voted on what the answers to the survey questions should be.
<P>
Later in the day - I went to the cocha with the jefe, his son and Arturo.  We were supposed to be going to the monte (forest) but went instead to a bunch of chacra and a cocha full of pirana.  Pat and Tac got more interviews with the help of Artemio and Fernando but probably not enough.
<P>
<B>Wednesday, 9 October 1996</B>
<P>
	Yesterday, we woke up at about 5:30 and packed up to leave Fatima.  As we packed, a gecko fell out of the rafters and I caught him and photographed him.  It rained until 11:00 and Tac used the time to get a few more interviews.  We left for Curiaca del Caco after the rain stopped.
<P>
	On the way to Curiaca, we saw our first river dolphins.  Pretty neat.  We were worried that we would not make it to Curiaca before dark but it was only about a 6 hour boat trip.  We turned up Quebrada Caco (Caco Creek; actually, more of a good sized river) and about 45 minutes later were in Curiaca.  The Quebrada Caco is about the nicest piece of river we have travelled.  It is not too wide, runs slowly but not stagnant and has a good variety of primary floodplain forest along both banks.  Overall a pretty nice trip except that I got a sunburned lip in the canoe while on the Rio Ucayali.  We have passed two mountain ranges on our trip to the west of the Ucayali.  One was across the river from Sempaya and the other can be seen to the North of us.  Fernando says that when we reach Amaquiria we will be closer to the northern range. 
<P>
[I really enjoyed the river travel days. The guys set up the seats in the boat such that we could lean back on the cargo and really relax. I actually fell asleep at one point.  We usually take lunch in the boat to make the best use of time, and the scenery is so tranquil.  The work days are just a flurry of activity, so travel days are a break for me. -kt]
<P>
	Curiaca is the nicest place we have been.  It is cool, has fewer insects drawing blood from you, has a nice breeze, the forest seems close and the quebrada is beautiful.  The people are also more open, although I am still not allowed to go out unaccompanied by a Shipibo.  These people are not very trusting but have yet to label us pelacara or pishtaco (another name for the same brand of white person).  The group Doctors Without Borders (Medicos Sin Fronteras; a philanthropic organization of doctors who give their time and money to go abroad and offer free health care to third world countries) had evidently come here and given the children medicine that made them sleepy and the people thought it was a failed attempt to kill the children.
<P>
	Last night at 7:40 (actually it was supposed to be at 8:00) we held the requisite 2 hour town meeting.  It lasted until 9:45. And the mistrust of the people was once again aired.  Fernando's relatives live here so we have a better entry to the community.  Most of the people here are supportive but a few would rather have us head downriver.  One guy asked if we spoke Shipibo and, if we did, where did we learn it.  Another fairly young guy came into the meeting wearing a white cushma, the traditional dress of Shipibo and Campa men.  Cushmas are basically big flowing sacks with long flowing arms that allow good air circulation and also protect you from bugs because they almost reach the ground.  During a frio (cold wind), you just wrap it more closely around your body.  This cushma was made of tightly woven cotton grown on trees around here and was covered in typical Shipibo geometric designs.  It supposedly takes three months to make one, assuming you already have all the cotton processed and they are very expensive to buy.  It was very cool.
<P>
	We are staying in the school offices at the Primaria (primary school) in Curiaca.  Small and cramped with all of our mosquiteros (mosquito netting) in a storage room and our kitchen set up on the school director's desk (a table with only three legs; we propped it up against the wall).  The place is full of large giant crab spiders.  I caught and preserved most of them so that Pat would sleep better.  
<P>
<B>Friday, 11 october 1996 - Curiaca del Caco</B>
<P>
At the end of the day on Wednesday, I went along with Tac and Fernando to interview the son of the best tinaja (pottery) maker in the village.  Before Tac conducted the interview, she got the woman to explain how the pots are made and recorded it as well as taking a few pictures.  The pots are not made on a wheel but are made by placing long rolls of clay on the edge of the ever growing pot and then pinching them into the clay already in place.  The pinching makes the developing pot uneven in thickness and she evens it out by scraping the excess clay off with a dried banana skin scraper.  The pots she was working on were very big.  While there, Tac arranged for me to go to the forest with Manuel, the woman's husband, who is regarded as the man most familiar with the trails around Curiaca.  Little did I know then that our trip would take me to the neighboring village of Pueblo Nuevo where we would run into more trouble in the wake of rumors of pishtacos.

<P>
<P>
<B>Friday, 11 October 1996 - Curiaca.
</B><P>
        Thursday morning at 7:30, Manuel came by and picked me 
(Paul) up and we headed out hiking in the general direction that I 
knew Pueblo Nuevo lay (upstream on the quebrada from Curiaca).  I 
asked Manuel if we were on the trail to Pueblo Nuevo and he said 
yes and that we were going to his house.  His son attends school 
in Curiaca and that is why he was in Curiaca the previous evening.  
It was about a 1 hour and fifteen minute hike stopping along the 
way to look for frogs.  The habitat was primary, lowland, 
floodplain forest and had a good diversity of frog and other 
critters.  When we got to Pueblo Nuevo, Manuel began stopping at 
all the houses of his friends, explaining who I was, what was 
going on in Curiaca with the educational research and basically 
hanging around until someone in each house offered him a bowl of 
masato.  Masato is a drink made by fermenting yuca gruel.[The way 
you get the yuca to ferment is by chewing it up and spitting it 
back in the pot.  Pat said the cooking kills just about 
everything, "although I'm not sure about TB" consoling, huh? It is 
said to be made with sugar now to ferment it rather than saliva; 
we know some people who have their doubts -kt]  It is pretty 
disgusting (not to mention, not very safe) and all the Shipibo 
make it.  At any rate, I met Jose Cervantes, a very nice man who 
made me feel right at home, as well as another relative of 
Manuel's who was busy making tinajas.  
<P>
        About halfway through the village (the village is about 3 km 
long), a young tough looking guy and his hood friend came up to me 
and told me that extranjeros were not permitted in Pueblo Nuevo 
without written permission and that I had better leave the village 
immediately.  I acted like I did not understand what he was saying 
(not a difficult part for me) and called to Manuel who motioned 
for me to follow him.  Manuel and I went to his house and I hung 
out while he visited with his family as they butchered a cow that 
had died giving birth the previous night.  The remainder of the 
trip to Pueblo Nuevo was uneventful and Manuel really got into 
catching frogs on the way back to Curiaca,  Later in the day, Tac 
and Pat went to Pueblo Nuevo to hold the community meeting and 
conduct the lottery.  As they arrived, the sky opened up and it 
rained until close to dark.  The meeting was rescheduled for the 
following morning at 8:00.  
<P>
        We woke up this morning and were in Pueblo Nuevo by shortly 
after 8:00.  It did not matter because the meeting did not start 
until about 9:15.  By 10:45 we had permission to conduct the study 
in Pueblo Nuevo, but things are not going very smoothly.  The 
village leader who had given me a hard time had no time to be 
interviewed.  A man named Dilver Tangoas refused to be 
interviewed.  Fernando asked him why and Dilver said that a number 
of years ago some white researchers had come through asking 
questions and three days after they left, his son was attacked by 
a white person who tried to kill his son.  Fernando asked if it 
was the same people or if it was just a coincidence.  Dilver said 
it was just a coincidence but he still wouldn't participate.  We 
moved on to the house of Miguel Vasquez Barbaran, the former 
Teniente Gobernador, to find a replacement for Dilver.  We told 
him that Dilver had denied us and why and Miguel replied that 
people who would not participate were ignorant and simple and that 
the son of Dilver had actually been attacked by a mad bull.  As a 
white person from the U.S., it feels strange to be the object of 
fear, hatred and prejudice.  It is an uncomfortable, stifling and 
oppressive feeling.
<P>
<B>Saturday, 12 October 1996</B>
<P>
A bumper day for frogs.  It rained all 
last night.  Tac and Pat went to Pueblo Nuevo and I stayed back to 
organize our life (boiling water, inventorying food, etc.).  At 
about 9:30 a guy named Gustavo came by and asked me if I wanted to 
go to Pueblo Nuevo with him.  I said sure.  Then he asked if I was 
willing to pay him (I had been forbidden to move around Curiaca 
without the escort of a Shipibo).  I asked him how much.  He threw 
it back to me and I threw it back at him.  He said 10 soles and I 
laughed.  I just let him sit there until he was about tired and 
ready to leave and I suggested 5 soles and he took it.  He was 
dressed in soccer gear (a game was scheduled in Pueblo Nuevo), so 
I told him that I did not want to go to the soccer game that what 
I wanted to do was look for frogs along the trail between Curiaca 
and Pueblo Nuevo.  He said that was fine and we started off.  As 
we neared Pueblo Nuevo, a family of 6 passed us on the trail and 
asked us what we were doing.  They joined in the frog hunt and 
then moved on down the road.  
<P>
        When we reached the edge of Pueblo Nuevo, I told Gustavo 
that we needed to return as I had a lot of work to do back in 
Curiaca.  He said we could return in the afternoon in the boat and 
I told him that our agreement had been to go to Pueblo Nuevo and 
return immediately.  [As you can see Paul's Spanish is coming 
right along.  Like I try to tell my students, funny what you can 
say when you have to.--kt]  We went and found Tac conducting an 
interview and she clarified my position and I agreed to let him go 
to the football game for a half hour.  After that time I found him 
playing soccer and called him off the field.  He did not come so I 
yelled at him that if he did not come now he would not be paid.  
He came.  When we hit the trail home, he was blazing, I assume 
intending to ditch me in Curiaca and return to the soccer game.  I 
just took my time, maybe even moving slower than I might otherwise 
have.  Such is the cost of forcing people to pay for accompaniment 
around the villages.
<P>
        Pat and Tac returned at about 5:00 with grim news from 
Pueblo Nuevo.  As the day wore on, more and more people refused to 
be interviewed.  Evidently the village leader never really wanted 
us there anyway.  There were a bunch of Madereros (lumbermen) 
running around town who looked pretty rough and Artemio and 
Fernando thought that they may have been narcotraficantes and that 
the village leader (a very young man not from Pueblo Nuevo) 
probably did not want us snooping around his back yard.  In 
addition, rumors were being circulated that we were pishtacos and 
that we had forced all the women wearing traditional dress in 
Curiaca into a dungeon overnight (we do not even know where the 
dungeon in Curiaca is located; although if we did, you can bet 
that Tac would have wanted to get a picture for the home page).  
Anyway, Artemio and Fernando became more and more uncomfortable as 
the soccer fiesta progressed and people had more masato and became 
more drunk and paranoid.  Overall, everyone was glad to say good-
bye to Pueblo Nuevo.
<P>
<B>Tuesday, 15 October 1996 - Curiaca.
</B><P>
        On Sunday night (7:00) we headed to Caco Macaya for the town 
meeting.  It went very well.  We returned Monday morning to 
conduct interviews in the large community house where they wished 
to be interviewed, not out of fear but because this was the type 
of purpose that the community house had been constructed.  As we 
left Curiaca on Monday morning, the Primaria class presented each 
of us with a necklace that they had made for us.  We were very 
touched after so many bad experiences in Sempaya, Fatima and 
Pueblo Nuevo.  I processed data during the day while Pat and Tac 
interviewed comuneros.  It rained very hard all day long.  We 
returned in the dugout canoe after dark, Fernando lighting the way 
with a flashlight and pointing out the reflections from the eyes 
of caimans as we went.
<P>
        Today, I stayed behind in Curiaca to pack up in preparation 
of our trip to Amaquiria tomorrow.  This morning, we were informed 
by radio that Artemio is being required to return to the Bilingual 
Print Shop.  We have authorization for him to be gone the entire 
three weeks but something has evidently changed.  David Archibald, 
the director of ILV at Yarinacocha thinks we should just ignore it 
because we have the authorization papers in our possession.  If 
Artemio has to go back we will all pack up as the interpretation 
skills of Artemio and Fernando have proven to be invaluable.  [We 
found out later that a possible reason that Artemio was being 
asked to come back was because there is talk that he is being 
considered as the new director of the bilingual teacher training 
program here in Yarinacocha; but do not tell anyone because he 
does not yet know that he is being considered.]  Not only that, 
but they have worked beyond what most people would have 
contributed to the research.  Our plan for tomorrow is to have 
Artemio and Fernando go to Caco Macaya to gather stories that will 
be published in Shipibo while we pack up so that we can all head 
to Amaquiria (or Yarinacocha) as soon as they return.
<P>
<B>Saturday, 19 October 1996 - Colonia del Caco.
</B><P>
        A lot has happened since I last wrote.  The trip to 
Amaquiria was without incident.  Arturo's boat was beginning to 
take on water but, other than that, everything was fine.  We 
stopped in Colonia del Caco where Fernando picked up some sedas 
(eating bananas) from his family's chacra.  Amaquiria turned out 
to be up a large quebrada that went toward the mountains that I 
had been yearning for and it even turned out to be on the right 
side of the river.  I was finally within walking range of the 
mountains.  We were given the use of a run-down, abandoned house 
(complete with many mosquitoes and the meeting was scheduled for 
8:00pm).  
<P>
        The meeting was interesting.  Artemio used to teach here and 
was aware that the Shipibo here were on the way toward becoming 
mestizado (mestizoized Indians).  Twelve of 51 households are 
mestizo.  For the first time, the meeting was conducted primarily 
in Spanish with interpretation provided for those Shipibo who were 
Spanish challenged.  In all other communities, the meetings were 
primarily in Shipibo with translation into Spanish being provided 
mainly for the mestizo teachers.  Thursday morning, I was invited 
to go to a chacra farmed by three guys:  Alfredo (father), Abel 
and Jaime (sons).  It was pretty uninteresting but they took me to 
a quebrada that flows out of the mountains.  It was clear and cool 
and I had a nice swim.  Afterward, they allowed me to pick some 
papayas for myself (they do not eat them) and we loaded up bananas 
and headed back to Amaquiria.  Along the way, I learned that there 
was a Campa village named La Selva about 45 minutes away, at the 
base of the mountains.  I also learned that it was a 3 hour hike 
to the first ridge and six hours to the higher, central highlands.  
I resolved to walk to La Selva and find they trail to the 
mountains in the afternoon.  I made it to La Selva and found the 
trail to the mountains but did not have the time to explore it.  
Tac and Pat finished 12 comuneros surveys and the health promotor.
[Do you get the idea that if I were writing this everyday it would 
be "interview X number of people today, ate dinner, went to 
bed...? The work is pretty tedious and Paul does have most of the 
fun (he also does a lot of the grunt work, housework), but I can 
not think of a more fun way to do the data gathering for my 
dissertation.  Hearing people's opinions and ideas is really quite 
interesting and it sure beats running spiders down racetracks 15 
hours a day.  The hard part is when the "work" (interviews) is 
over, it is a ton of work just to get dinner and get safely under 
mosquito netting before getting eaten alive.--kt]
<P> 
       Friday morning, I went to Abel's house to ask if he was 
willing to walk to the mountains with me.  The previous day he had 
offered to take me canoeing up the quebrada but it would take too 
long in a canoe.  He said he would so I went and told Tac the 
plan.  When I returned, Abel told me that he needed to go and work 
his chacra but that a mestizo named Salvador would go with me.  We 
set out for La Selva at 7:51 and arrived at 8:25.  La Selva is a 
pleasant community located right on the banks of the swift flowing 
quebrada and does not seem to be a plagued with biting insects.  
From La Selva, we turned almost due west and began to climb up a 
road that was built so that a "tractor" could be brought into the 
mountains for a large lumber operation.  It was very overgrown and 
the path had been cleared for the road, but the area to each side 
had not been logged.  About 15 minutes outside of La Selva, I saw 
my first poison arrow frog in the wild.  Pretty cool.  Over the 
next 5 hours I would see 5 species of toads, one species of poison 
arrow frog (one of which was carrying tadpoles on its back) and a 
number of foam nests made by leptodatylids.  Salvador told me 
about a large species of frog which must be among the largest in 
the world based on his description and the burrows that he 
attributed to it.  We also saw a variety of monkeys, toucans and 
heard calls from tapirs in the forest as well as saw jaguar 
tracks.  At times, I was glad that Salvador was armed.  We covered 
elevation which I estimate at between 1500 (La Selva)-3500 (the 
highest point in the first range)feet (elevation on air charts are 
not reliable in this part of the jungle).  
<P>
        This morning we were up at 5:20.  We had the boat packed and 
were on the river by 10:30.  Before we left, a woman brought me to 
see a 2 meter long shushupe (bushmaster, a large pit viper) skin.  
I asked her where she got it and she said the mountains (where I 
had been the previous day.)  We traveled first to the village of 
Nazaret where we have been asked to speak to the village leaders 
and teachers about bilingual education since we were unable to 
conduct the study in their village.  We are currently in the 
Inicial, Tac and Pat have already spoken and Artemio is going off 
in Shipibo about Pedagogy.  I will soon be bored as we also have 
to listen to Fernando and that will all be in Shipibo as well.
<P>
<B>Sunday, 20 October 1996 - Colonia del Caco.
</B><P>
        Too hot even to write!! [It was hot, but we remembered you 
on your birthday, Mike.  I prayed for you at breakfast and wished 
for a piece of birthday cake.  There was none, but Pat made 
bisquits which considering the conditions might as well have been 
chocolate birthday cake. --kt]
<P>
<B>Monday, 21 October 1996 - Colonia del Caco.
</B><P>
        We arrived in Caco at about 4:00 in the afternoon on 
Saturday.  It was really hot.  We were given the old health clinic 
to stay in (they recently built a new one) and it is about 600 
meters from the river.  The good thing about government funded 
buildings in the jungle is that they have waterproof roofs and 
good solid walls.  The bad thing about government funded buildings 
in the jungle is that they have waterproof roofs and good solid 
walls.  The roofs are made of tin and the walls do not have enough 
windows so that they become solar ovens on days like yesterday.  
By the time we got our gear to the clinic, we were all soaked with 
sweat and the building was so hot that it was difficult to stay 
inside long enough to set up.  
<P>
        The structure of government funded buildings is a strange 
irony.  The people build their houses sensibly:  palm leaf roofs 
that breathe well, large breezy porches, many open spaces in the 
walls when walls are present.  With the exception of the times of 
day when the biting insects are bad, they are amazingly pleasant 
places to live.  Yet, when it comes to building a school, health 
clinic or library, they use flanged lumber and tin roofing and 
make solid walls that make the places so uncomfortable that I 
could understand people wanting to stay home.  Pat says that it is 
a status symbol to build things the Peruvian way but I think there 
is no status is being miserable in an environment where you 
obviously know how to stay comfortable.  The meeting with the 
community went well (Fernando said that the decision had already 
been made but that did not shorten the required 2 hour minimum 
meeting time).  This seems to be the most open community we have 
been in (on par with Caco Macaya and Amaquiria).  
<P>
        Sunday morning we slept in (6:30).  Pat made some biscuits 
and we tarried.  Church was supposed to start at 9:15 but people 
trickled in until 9:40 at which time it actually began in earnest.  
Pat was preoccupied with radio duty.  The previous night at about 
midnight, one of the villagers was mistaken for a capybara (a 
large rodent and very good eating (so we hear)) and was 
subsequently shot in the leg.  At about 2:00 a.m. a woman gave 
birth and the nurse who lives next door was called to cut the 
umbilical cord.  The villagers do not deal with gunshot wounds 
very often and are overreacting, wanting to fly the victim to 
Pucallpa for treatment at the "hospital".  According to the nurse, 
she was able to remove most of the shot and he is not running a 
fever so he will probably be fine.  Some people came by before and 
fever so he will probably be fine.  Some people came by before and 
after church to make appointments for interviews.  At 4:00 in the 
afternoon, Fernando held a meeting of the church at which we were 
presented with a vast array of gifts including necklaces, pottery 
and fabrics.  Then the young people presented us with the 
performance of a native Shipibo song.  [We were so touched, 
especially given the not so warm reception we received in other 
areas.]
<P>
        During the day, Artemio mentioned that we would probably 
finish interviewing by Tuesday morning and that we could probably 
be back in Yarinacocha by noon.  Tac asked Pat about the plan and 
Pat went off again about how she thought we were moving through 
communities too fast and not getting "good answers".  Tension and 
frustration levels seem to increase with each passing day.  
<P>
<B>Monday, 21 October 1996 - Colonia del Caco.
</B><P>
        Caco is big: 846 people.  They have all levels of school as 
well as a vocational school, beyond Colegio (high school).  It is 
so big that I am not even going to attempt to find any unspoiled 
forest.  We are going to try to leave tomorrow.  Our pace has been 
blistering and we are all tired.  Tac and Pat have surveyed 7 
communities in 19 days, including travel.
<P>
<B>Tuesday, 22 October 1996 - Caco.
</B><P>
        We are mostly packed to return to Yarinacocha.  We radioed 
in about the possibility of a plane for today and were told that 
today would be better than tomorrow.  Pat is still reluctant to 
finish and leave in spite of the fact that she says we have a ton 
to do back in Yarinacocha to prepare for our downriver Shipibo 
trip.  We radioed this morning and were told that they had a 
medical emergency in Huanuco and that the pilot would not be back 
until 3:30.  I have everything packed except bedding and pots and 
pans.  We have leftovers from last night for lunch.  Pat will not 
take down her mosquiteros until she is absolutely sure we will be 
leaving.  Pat mentioned yesterday how exhausted she was.  I think 
that this mode of travel and the pace of surveying so many 
communities is really beginning to take a toll on her.  She has 
nearly fallen asleep the last 2 nights as Tac and I have prepared 
dinner.
<P>
        This morning Pat expressed doubts about the reality of a 
downriver Shipibo trip.  She said she was not sure if Filiberto 
and Alejandro (two guys from the ministry of education)would find 
this type of work "below their station".  She also does not know 
if we will have enough money and is concerned about the rumors of 
pishtacos.  If we do not have enough money for the downriver trip 
we also do not have enough money for any other trip and Tac and I 
might as well go home.  If we do have the money, we should get 
back to Yarinacocha and start planning.  I also think that if it 
is below Alejandro and Filiberto to work hard for something that 
will ultimately benefit the ministry of education, then we should 
leave their lazy butts at home and find a few Shipibos who are 
willing and go get the job done. [I sure hope they do not learn 
English and log on to our home page. --kt]
<P>
        Last night it rained very hard and the wind was very strong.  
Some people who live across the playing fields from us had a fire 
on a raised platform in their house and the coals blew onto the 
floor and burned their house to the ground.  Tac and I gave them 
some of our clothes and the rest of our food in a small effort to 
help them out.  
<P>
<B>Tuesday, 22 October 1996 - Yarinacocha.
</B><P>
        The plane finally arrived and we got back to Yarinacocha at 
5:31.  ILV lanes are not supposed to be out after 5:30.  Wade 
pushed things along to get us in on that day.  The plane had taken 
off and the air speed indicator did not work.  It returned, was 
repaired and took off again which is why we were so late getting 
back.  Willie and Kay Gesch had us over for barbecue on homemade 
rolls complete with fresh mangos (nice chico ricos without all the 
stringiness).  It is now mango season and the air is filled with 
the sounds of mangos falling on tin roofs and parrots wheeling in 
the skies, lighting in trees and enjoying the harvest.  [Yes, the 
mood changes after you have had a shower and some chocolate.  We 
are glad to be back to the comforts of clean water and indoor 
plumbing.  The downriver trip, complete with two willing Shipibo 
translators, is scheduled for Nov 4-19 or so.  We are praying for 
enough sunshine to do laundry every three days or so, and good 
graces when we arrive at new communities.  Apparently these "bad 
white people" stories are running rampant downriver as well. If we 
could figure out a way to got our airplane to run on human fat...]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<B>Thursday, 7 November 1996
</B><P>
It has been a few weeks since I last wrote.  
We finally made it home on the 22nd of October.  There was a medical 
emergency in Huaraz and Wade kept putting us off until about 3:30 when 
he told us via radio that he was sending a plane out to get us.  What he 
did not tell us was that he was calling a reserve pilot from his desk 
job to make a special flight for us.  Jim, the pilot, took off but the 
airspeed indicator was not working so he had to return and have it fixed 
and then take off again.  He landed in Caco at about 4:30 and we 
proceeded to load the plane.  I noticed that he was not leaving all five 
seats intact so I informed him that we had five passengers.  Because we 
were tight on space, we left the galoneras (gas drums) to be brought 
back to Yarinacocha with a villager coming from Caco a few days later.  
We took off at 4:57 an landed at 5:31, one minute past the time set for 
the curfew of all ILV planes.  The following day, it rained all day and 
we found out that if they had not come and gotten us that day, we would 
not have come back the following day.  Kay and Willie Gesch were once 
again waiting for us at the water and invited us for dinner which was, 
once again excellent.  
<P>
        During our time in Yarinacocha, I have begun gathering legends 
about the native wildlife in this part of Peru.  They are mainly Shipibo 
in origin.  Here are a few samples.  There is a species of blind snake 
(Typhlopidae) that lives down in leaf-cutter ant mounds that the Shipibo 
believe is the "ant mother".  They hold that these snakes are the 
organisms that produce the ants and that if you remove the snake from 
the mound, the mound will die.  Of course, the snake is probably feeding 
on the larvae and, if you have dug that far into the mound, you have 
probably disturbed the mound to the point that you have effectively 
destroyed it or prompted it to move elsewhere.  They also believe that 
these and caecilians are two headed venomous snakes (a common belief in 
other parts of the world).  The river dolphins are greatly feared by the 
people along the river.  Supposedly, the dolphins come out of the water 
at night, transform into people, steal young women and return to the 
water taking the young women with them as they turn back into dolphins.  
This legend may stem from the fact that the dolphins hunt near the shore 
when the fish are spawning and trap the fish between themselves and the 
shore.  We have seen fish literally jumping out of the water as the 
dolphins move in toward shore.  It is pretty impressive to see.
<P>
        We have spent the past few weeks preparing for the downriver 
Shipibo trip.  Tom Hough, a missionary with South American Missions 
(SAM), offered us the use of his boat and interpreter/motorista 
(Marcial) and has gotten in touch with a pastor in Calleria, our first 
stop, who will also serve as an interpreter.  We were slated to leave on 
Monday the 4th but Pat got bronchitis and we had to put off departure 
until yesterday (Wednesday).  It rained all day on Tuesday, literally.  
Tom picked us up at 7:45 in the morning and we loaded all our gear into 
his Nissan pick-up (no small task).  We went to the Centro Nativo where 
Tom dropped us and our gear while he went to get the Ford F-250 four-
wheel-drive, full-sized pick-up which we would need to make it to the 
port.  Because of all the rain, the road (dirt turned mud) was in 
terrible and we were grateful for the vehicle change.  Rainy season has 
definitely arrived.  When we got to the port, we found a beautiful blue, 
collectivo-style boat about 10 meters in length, complete with a roof 
and a 40-hp Mariner outboard motor.  It was sooooo sweet.  After a few 
hours of cleaning the boat, finding the missing floor boards, etc. we 
headed to the floating gas station for gas, stopped off at the port 
spark plug supplier and headed downriver.  We left the port at 11:00 and 
arrived at Calleria at 2:30.  We went via a canyo which can only be used 
when the water is high enough that shaved some time off the trip.  The 
canyo was nice with many monkeys and birds to see as we went along.  We 
came out on the Rio Calleria about a mile upstream of Calleria.  
<P>
        We met the village pastor, Laureano, and he set us up in one of 
the spare houses in his complex of buildings that he calls home.  We set 
up and had a dinner of rice and beans.  As it turns out, the village 
leaders can not (or will not) meet with us until 2:00 this afternoon.  
That is where I am writing from.  We arrived at 2:00 and the meeting 
started at 3:15 (BIG SHOCK!!!).  The village leader, Jose, is explaining 
what we are doing here.  Tac and Pat had a preliminary meeting last 
night with the village leaders so they are clued in.  This delay has 
already cost us a day and we will probably have to cut Roaboya and only 
complete 4 communities on this trip.  It is already going less well, in 
terms of time, than the last trip but the community seems open.  The 
time has enabled Pat and Tac to go to school this morning and observe 
the teachers teaching which is something that John Paolillo (Tac's major 
professor) told her that she should be doing more of.
<P>
Thursday, 7 Nov., 4:34 PM - The lottery has once again gone awry.  The 
people decided that we should only chose from among the people (20 at 
most) who showed up at the meeting.  Not exactly what I would consider a 
random sample of the community but what do you expect when you do not 
work with spiders.  At any rate, they are ready to begin and Pat and Tac 
are interviewing.  
<P>
        Calleria is close to Pucallpa.  So close, in fact, that you can 
not see stars in the southern sky because of the lights from Pucallpa 
(the first time that has happened on our trips).  This is also the first 
community in which we have been warned by a member of the community that 
people might steal our stuff.  This village seems very acculturated - 
many people have radios, I have seen sewing machines and even a metal 
bed frame.  Some guys across the playing fields from where we are 
staying are building a collectivo style boat, probably to facilitate 
moving goods to and from Pucallpa.
<P>
        Last night the village jefe went caiman hunting and brought us a 
hind leg and portion of the body.  Pat fried it up and it was excellent.  
We got to have caiman after all and avoided a rash of pishtaco stories 
cropping up around us.  Currently, a group of kids have gathered around 
and are watching me write.  A young girl behind me has noticed that my 
arms are hairy.  She reached out tentatively and touched the hair on my 
arms and now all the kids are tentatively reaching out and touching the 
hair on my arms and the hair on my head.  They do not have hairy arms or 
facial hair and I probably have lighter hair than they have ever seen 
before.
<P>
<B>Friday, 8 November 1996 -
</B><P>
It rained on and off all morning.  Yesterday, 
Laureano brought around some yuca and, after a short nap, I peeled it an 
boiled it to go with a tuna sauce that Pat is currently preparing.  Last 
night Tac caught a toad for me on her way home from interviewing.  
During one of Tac's interviews, a woman was painting on a brown 
pampanilla while her two sons were on the porch nearby reading out of 
school books.  Just before she finished the interview everyone got up 
and left.  She asked the son being interviewed if she could come back 
and stage the scene after lunch.  The woman went and changed into a 
better blouse and the picture looked very staged but they were all 
pretty cute.  While interviewing the father in the same house, Tac had a 
chicken jump on her head for the first time in her life (she did not 
know what she had been missing).  The chicken had a roost up on the 
upper level of the house (where people live during the three months of 
high water when they can't leave their house except in a canoe) and was 
trying to get to it by flying up on to Tac's head from which she could 
fly the rest of the way.  Tac shook the chicken off her head [like what 
else would I do? --kt].  The family waited tentatively to see what Tac's 
reaction would be and, when she laughed, the whole family busted up 
laughing.  
<P>
<B>Sunday, 10 November 1996 -
</B><P>
We traveled from Calleria to Nuevo Loreto 
yesterday.  Tac and Pat had a few more surveys to finish up in the 
morning while I packed our gear.  There was a wedding scheduled to begin 
at noon but we were not invited (imagine that). [I went around to where 
they were setting up for the wedding and asked about wedding customs and 
tried to look like I was fishing for an invite, but nobody took the 
hint. I do not guess we missed anything though because the marriage was 
not between two Shipibo people (the man was Brazilian). --Kt] We heard 
on the radio in the morning that Artemio Pacaya, director of the 
bilingual print shop and one of the interpreters on our first Shipibo 
trip, had been appointed as the new director of the Instituto Superior 
Pedagogio Bilingue, where all the bilingual school teachers in the 
Department of Ucayali are trained.
<P>
        We have not kept you totally informed on the situation here in the 
weeks between the upriver and downriver trips, so please be patient with 
the following digression.  All bilingual school teachers in this area 
are trained at the ISPB here in Yarinacocha which was initially set up 
jointly with the Instituto Linguistico de Verano and the Ministry of 
Education.  People come here from all over the jungle to be trained as 
bilingual school teachers since the methods of teaching are unique from 
monolingual programs.  The director of the school has always been an 
indigena and some have been better than others.  The most recent one, 
Alejandro Ruiz, stunk pretty bad and it shows in the quality of the 
teachers that are being produced.  Among the things he has been involved 
in was supporting drunken parties as fund-raisers for the different 
classes.  The Friday before we left, Ruiz was at one of these parties 
when some guys from the FAP (Fuerza Aereo del Peru, the Peruvian Air 
Force based near here) evidently had some rough business to discuss with 
him.  We do not know what it was about but it tuned ugly and one of the 
Aguaruna (a tribe from upper Maranon River, west of Iquitos) students 
stepped in and was knifed through the heart by one of the FAP guys and 
died shortly thereafter.  The FAP claimed that the guy with the knife 
had no connection with FAP as he had deserted two days before the 
incident (yeah, right!!).
<P>
        A number of people have been trying to remove Ruiz from the 
director's position for months and this gave them the ammunition  they 
needed.  The family of the Aguaruna asked the ILV if they would fly the 
young man's body up to the Maranon to be buried and his father and three 
village leaders from the Aguaruna came back demanding that Ruiz be 
relieved of his duties.  It finally came about and Artemio, who is the 
total dude, was appointed the new director.  He had just gotten back 
from our first survey trip and was struck by the fact that people are 
not maintaining their mother tongue and that the bilingual school 
teachers are not teaching in such a way that would allow maintenance to 
occur.  Our hope is that the experience will prompt him to make changes 
in the curriculum that will make the bilingual teachers more effective.  
<P>
        Well, anyway.  Back to the story at hand.  We were packed and in 
the boat by 10:15.  It was a nice 2 hour and 15 minute ride to Nuevo 
Loreto.  When we reached the main river, it was striking how much the 
river had risen in the 3 weeks since we were last on it.  Many playa and 
the temporary homes built on them were under water.  There were also a 
great many dead trees floating in the river.  This makes river travel 
more dangerous, especially in a speed boat, because hitting one of these 
too fast can split the hull of the boat and the river is from 1/2 mile 
to 1 mile wide in this area.  Calleria is under water 3 months out of 
every year.  On my way to the banana chacra/bathroom, I saw water marks 
on trees 4 meters above the ground.  Calleria has been in existence for 
50 years.  How do they do it?!?
<P>
        We got set up in the health clinic/Inicial in Nuevo Loreto.  The 
roof has holes in it but it is solid and has a table and chairs with 
which to work.  We are currently in the 7:00 am meeting which began at 
7:45.  Pat has just complimented the community on all the examples of 
the results of bilingual education like the health clinic, school, etc.  
Unfortunately, the survey asks people what changes have been made in the 
community that are the result, directly or indirectly, of bilingual 
education.  There are only 27 houses in Nuevo Loreto.  Everyone seems 
enthusiastic and willing to participate.  The director of the school 
made a speech about how important we were and how Peru could be an 
example for other countries (Chile, Bolivia, Venezuela, etc.).  This may 
have as much to do with people's willingness as anything that any of us 
or the interpreters have said.  The jovenes are always difficult.  It 
seems like many households either do not have kids, the kids are to 
young or have already moved away.  Two jovenes mujeres to go and it is 
9:00.  By 9:15 everything seemed set but there was still a lot of 
discussion going on in Shipibo.  As it turned out they had voted to give 
us a duck (for eating, not as a pet) and were straightening out the 
details.  Two guys earlier in the morning had brought by a large supply 
of maduros (cooking bananas) and yuca, actually more than we could 
possibly eat in our remaining time in Peru [in our lifetime --kt].  
<P>
        This village moves away from the water in a straight line, similar 
to Caco, with houses on either side of a wide avenue.  The clinic where 
we are staying is a long way from the river which is difficult from the 
standpoint of getting water but good from the bug perspective.  This 
community has fewer biting flies and mosquitoes than Calleria and that 
is a big plus.  [They did have these nifty little biting gnats that left 
my hands bloody after carrying stuff from the river.  The good news is 
that the bites do not itch/ --kt]  Last night I caught 2 species of 
toads in the main avenue.  
<P>
<B>Monday, 11 November 1996 -
</B><P>
Yesterday went pretty well as far as the 
project is concerned.  Tac and Pat got 11 interviews completed with 
people hanging out after the meeting waiting their turn.  We ended up 
getting a chicken instead of a duck and I am slowly discovering that the 
food in this part of the world is basically bland and that what makes it 
at all bearable is what you add to it.
<P>
        On another note, these larger communities downriver that get 
flooded a lot are not much good for biology.  They have to plant so much 
chacra to support themselves during the high water season that there is 
not much forest around within a reasonable distance from the village.  
This place is surrounded by chacras as far as the eye can see.  The area 
downriver of Pucallpa along the main Rio Ucayali is pretty well 
populated and pretty heavily disturbed.  The area upriver and the Gran 
Pajonal region are much more interesting.
<P>
<B>Tuesday, 12 November 1996 - Roaboya -
</B><P>
Up this morning at 5:58 to pack 
and leave for Roaboya.  We talked to Marcial yesterday evening about the 
remainder of the trip.  Things are a little confused.  Laureano brought 
his wife and 3 of 4 kids with him to Nuevo Loreto.  He left two of his 
kids in Nuevo Loreto with his mother-in-law and brought the two youngest 
girls with us to Roaboya.  We skipped Alfonso Ugarte instead of Roaboya 
after hearing that the river is not high enough yet to prevent the 1 
hour hike from the river to the village, an impossibility with all our 
gear.  So, we went to Roaboya with the intention of coming back upriver 
to Paoyhan as our last stop to shorten the trip home.  On the way back 
to Pucallpa, we must stop at Nuevo Loreto and pick up the rest of 
Laureano's family and some empty gas cans.  Then we have the choice of 
taking the whole family back to Pucallpa and paying their passage back 
to Calleria from Pucallpa or going back through Calleria to drop them 
off.  In the latter case, the trip would extend to two days and we would 
still have to pay Laureano's passage from Pucallpa to Calleria because 
he would have to go along on the return trip through the canyo to watch 
for logs, etc.  Pat suggested staying overnight in Calleria, an option 
to which Tac and I are not very open.  We have a great many things to 
accomplish when we get back and our turn-around time between this trip 
and the lakes trip is tight.  
<P>
        Anyway, Roaboya is pretty nice.  It is located on a small quebrada 
on the east side of the Ucayali.  We are once again in a health clinic 
which doubles as an Inicial school.  This one is nice and breezy with 
more windows and a higher roof than is usual in a government sponsored 
building (see my previous diatribe about government buildings in the 
jungle).  Roaboya has a church, generator, street lights, an Inicial, 
Primaria and Colegio.  Of course, the Colegio students were playing 
volleyball when we arrived (11:30)and looked as if they had been there 
for a while (school is supposed to last until 12:30).  Pat and Tac have 
a meeting with the village leaders at 3:00.  The quebrada does not flow 
very much and we have to decide whether to bathe in the quebrada or 
bring the water up the bank.  When I went down to the water, a small 
tremor was felt that really stirred up the quebrada (we later found out 
that it was an earthquake in Nazca).  
<P>
5:08 PM.  The meeting with the village leaders went well.  Afterwards, a 
man named Pedro Tangoa Lopez stayed around talking to Pat and Tac.  He 
is with Parliamento Indigena de America based in Brazilia, Brazil.  He 
was educated in law at the Catholic University in Lima but quit his 
studies to take care of his mother after his father died.  He supposedly 
goes around to Shipibo communities teaching them to institute 
sustainable agricultural practices with the hope of teaching them to be 
self-sufficient and get them away from begging the government for 
assistance (hand-outs).
<P>
<B>Wednesday, 13 November 1996 - Roaboya -
</B><P>
Last night's meeting went well 
and was definitely the quickest (for one thing, it started on time).  
Once again the electronic flash was all the rage.  Many of the older 
women did not want to be interviewed.  This morning I was up by 5:45 
and, after a quick granola breakfast, did some laundry.  I was on a 
trail out of town by 9:00.  I walked a full hour out of town and could 
not escape chacra.  After an hour, I turned back at a huge corn chacra 
in which the people had left some taller trees still standing which had 
since died from lack of water and scorched earth.  There was very little 
of interest but it made a sad and interesting photo.  
<P>
<B>Thursday, 14 November 1996 -
</B><P>
Roaboya.  Tac and I are sitting in on
school now.  First and second grade and the first hour is supposed to be 
Shipibo reading and writing with the second hour being Spanish.  It is 
pretty horrible.  The teacher apparently has no plan.  He recites 
sentences one word at a time while pointing to the words.  They are not 
learning to read; they are just turning into little parrots.  Then he 
drew some pictures on the board - moon, sun, clay pot, paddle, canoe, a 
shotgun and a yuca plant.  After he drew them, he wrote the names of the 
pictures in Spanish and Shipibo - luna/oshe, sol/bari tinaja/chomo, 
remo/huinti, canoa/nonti, escopeta/toati, yuca/ashah.  He misspelled 
chomo and ashah and has gone back to correct the spelling.  He has 
written the Spanish above the picture with the Shipibo below for some 
pictures and just the opposite for others.  Whenever he says nonti, he 
points to the word canoa and when he says the word canoa, he points to 
the word nonti.  I wonder to myself if he knows how to read.  He has now 
added platano/paranta and pampanilla (the traditional Shipibo 
skirt)/chitonti.  He misspelled pampanilla "panpanilla".  Pretty sadly 
hurting!!  Tac thinks that the normal teacher is in Pucallpa and this 
guy is from the Colegio (high school) just filling in.  I weep for the 
high schoolers.  Two girls and a boy have sat down on the floor and are 
playing, totally ignoring what is going on at the board - lucky them.  
He has finally erased the Shipibo word for yuca.  He probably does not 
know how to spell it.  
<P>
        Every time things slow down a little bit, he gets the kids 
involved in a group sing-a-long.  There are not enough chairs for all 
the kids to sit down and some of them are sitting across the top of a 
long table.  He has now drawn a picture of a boat and all the kids are 
shouting "lancha".  He then wrote the words bote/ani bote, pointed to 
the word bote and said "colectivo"!!  He is now telling them about the 
boat we came in and telling them that some boats have peques and some 
boats have outboards (Johnson, Suzuki, Mariner, etc.).  Tac thinks he's 
killing time until recess which begins at 10:00.  We leave at 9:34.
<P>
        We are now in the 3rd and 4th grade language class.  The teacher 
has written the following on the board:
<P>
A_a_a, anonra bimi piai
E_e_e, epanra piti piai
I_i_i, inonra piti piai
O_o_o, ocanra shiqui piai
<P>
As we came in he was in the process of writing the following:
<P>
 n   t   p
pa  pe  pi
 a   e   i
na  ne  ni
ta  te  ti
<P>
He now has everyone reciting the things on the board, followed by some 
individual recitation followed by copying the board 10 times in their 
notebooks.  This room is a traditional palm roofed hut with palm bark 
floors.  It is infinitely more comfortable than the room we were just 
in.  Now he has written the following on the board:
<P>
1)  Ami me gusta cantar - dice Tota [sic]
2)  A Beto le gusta cantar
3)  A Jose y Tota les gustan cantar - dice Beto [sic]
4)  A todos nos gusta cantar - dice Jose [sic]
<P>
He wrote "A mi" as one word.  Tac tells me he is also misusing the verb 
"gustar" in the last two sentences.  She says it is a classic non-native 
speaker mistake.  The teacher repeats the first two words of each 
sentence and the class chants the remainder.  A guy named Emerson has a 
Kirika and is reading out loud while all this is going on.  The home 
work for the day is the last four sentences with "me, le, les, and nos" 
omitted.  Tough assignment!!.  The 1st and 2nd graders were let out at 
9:39.  Pretty sadly hurting.
<P>
<B>Saturday, 16 November 1996 - Paoyhan (pronounced pow-yan).
</B><P>
We arrived 
in Paoyhan yesterday morning.  We left Roaboya at about 9:15 and arrived 
at about 10:30.  When we got to the main river, the wind was up and the 
water was really choppy.  We probably should have stayed closer to the 
shore than we did but I think Marcial was trying to make a bee line for 
Paoyhan.  Pat was looking kind of white-knuckled all through the trip.  
We made it all right.  When we arrived, the town leaders were in a 
meeting and Pat and Tac once again went through why they were here to 
do.  Everyone seemed positive and in favor of us staying.  The teacher 
then commissioned a battalion of primary students to help us bring our 
gear up from the river.  They took us to the house of a comunero who is 
out of town.  It is very nice - lumber floors and walls and a nice palm 
roof.  Very comfortable especially since the sun has not shone in the 
past 2 days.  I am glad we did laundry just before leaving Roaboya.
<P>
        When we got to the house, Tac and I set up everything while Pat 
sat and talked with the Primaria teacher (no comment).  Afterward, we 
went to the presidente's house for what had to be the worse chicken and 
yuca I have had since we landed in Peru.  Tac and returned and rigged a 
shower for ourselves and then tried to get a little bit of a nap.  
<P>
        The town meeting was scheduled for 7:00.  There are 719 people in 
Paoyhan.  Tac and I got a hold of the census and conducted  preliminary 
lottery in which we chose 20 comuneros of each class (hombres adultos, 
hombres jovenes, mujeres adultos, etc.).  The plan was to choose from 
this subsample at the meeting.  I stayed home from the meeting but Tac 
filled me in.  Amazingly enough, our plan worked.  One man stood up and 
said how important it was to be honest.  If the teachers are bad, then 
say so.  If the students are not learning, then say so.  If there are 
good things, then say that also.  Another man, from Paococha (right next 
door to Paoyhan), asked if Pat and Tac could come there and conduct the 
study there as well.  They told him that they did not have the time but 
that they would be willing to meet with the community if they desired.  
It is set for Monday afternoon.  
<P>
        Things here have been going pretty well.  The same types of 
incongruity in people's responses elsewhere persist here.  When one guy 
was asked to name a custom he thought was being maintained, he could 
think of nothing other than that they still speak Shipibo, still wear 
traditional clothing and still live in traditional houses.  Tac asked 
him if he owned a <A HREF="/jungle/pics/cushma.jpg">cushma </A>
 (the traditional men's clothing) and he said 
"No."  She then asked him if the houses in Paoyhan were the way they 
used to be built.  Of course he had to say "No" because many of them are 
made from lumber and have tin roofs.  His wife chimed in that she still 
wears a pampanilla, but she went into the bedroom and changed out of her 
western-style clothing into her pampanilla during the course of the 
interview.  
<P>
        Another man, 70 + years old, when asked if there were any negative 
changes in the community either directly or indirectly the result of 
education said everything was "bueno."  Later in the interview, when 
asked if customs were being maintained, he replied that the government 
is trying to build one single Peruvian culture, which he viewed as 
negative, and the means by which they are trying to accomplish this is 
through the school system.  Tac then reminded him that he could think of 
no negative effects of education a few pages back in the interview.  
This form of (il)logic persists among the Shipibo (and probably just 
about anywhere you would care to look in the world).  [In that guy's 
defense I will add that sometimes it is hard to think of an answer to 
the question "Has education had any negative results?" because people 
generally think of education as good.  I just pointed out to the guy 
that that was the kind of thing I was looking for in the previous 
question. --kt]
<P>
<B>Sunday, 17 November 1996 - Paoyhan.
</B><P>
A pretty slow day today.  Church 
this morning at 8:00.  It rained most of the morning and Tac and I 
gathered two buckets of rain water.  I am currently boiling it for 
drinking.  There were many people decked out in Shipibo garb in church.  
Only women; no men in cushmas (bummer).  This afternoon, as predicted, 
no one wanted to be interviewed because of the futbol game.  Marcial 
went with the pastor and has lined up an joven hombre and is looking for 
a joven mujer.  That and the leader/health promotor are all that are 
left.  If we did not have to got to Paococha tomorrow, we could have 
pushed and finished and be heading back tomorrow.  Tac will still go to 
school and observe things tomorrow and so it is good that we are staying 
over one more day.
<P>
        Pat wanted to schedule the downriver trip because she says that 
the downriver communities represent a "different reality" from the 
upriver communities, or the communities around Lago Yarinacocha or 
around the Tamaya lakes.  Tac and I have seen no evidence that the 
communities are any different, in positive or negative ways, from the 
upriver communities.  The communities around Pucallpa may very well be 
different because of their proximity to Pucallpa but only time will 
tell.  
<P>
<B>Monday, 18 November 1996 - Paoyhan.
</B><P>
Tac and I went to school and you 
have already seen the types of things we write down when we are there so 
I won't bore you with a repeat.  This place had the highest quality 
teaching we have yet observed in a river community and it was still 
pretty sadly hurting, but not as bad as in Roaboya.  One new twist is 
that, during school, I ran out of film and on my way back to the house 
to get another roll of film, I counted 23 school-aged children running 
around, playing with friends, helping their parents around the house, 
etc.  In the afternoon, I went to the forest, about a 45 minute hike 
from the edge of town, but the mosquitoes were so bad I did not stay 
long.
<P>
        Monday afternoon and evening we prepared for the return trip to 
Yarinacocha.  It should take between 8 and 10 hours so we are planning 
to leave at 6:00 AM.  Pat has repeatedly expressed reservations about 
the trip.  Marcial would like to make the trip in one day.  Pat would 
like to make the trip in two days, staying over one night in Calleria to 
drop Laureano's wife and children off.  This of course involves 
unloading the boat, setting up the kitchen and mosquito netting and 
hiding the boat.  If we go straight to Yarinacocha, we can just pay for 
passage back to Calleria on a colective for Laureano and his family (12 
soles (about $5.00)).  Pat says she wants to avoid being on the river 
after dark but if it takes 10 hours [and everyone is saying 8 --kt] and 
we leave by 6:00, we should be in Yarinacocha by 4:00.  Our plan was to 
pack boxes the night before and only have to pack up bedding in the 
morning and begin hauling stuff down to the boat by about 5:00.  I made 
up 8 cups of rice and mixed in 5 cans of tuna (our standard travel food; 
we would later learn that people back in Yarinacocha mix this up to feed 
to their dogs.  We ended up feeding leftovers to the Ten Bensel's black 
lab who had just given birth).  We had everything but our bedding packed 
by the time we went to bed and even had time for a Shipibo musical group 
to come to our house and give us a little show. [This was kinda cool - a 
church group who had written their own choruses.  The sound was 
distinctly Quechua, but the words were Shipibo.  I taped it. --kt] 
<P>
<B>Wednesday, 20 November 1996 - Yarinacocha.
</B><P>
We are back.  Everything 
went as planned.  We started hauling stuff down to the river by about 
5:15 and pulled away from the "port" at 6:08.  Pretty good for a bunch 
of slackers.  We began with 9 adults and 2 children so we were riding a 
little low.  This all came about because we have been carrying around 
the teniente gobernador from Raoboya and we picked up a few more 
passengers in Paoyhan.  Evidently, Marcial was orphaned as a child and 
the brother of the man who raised him lives in Paoyhan.  This man's son 
was evidently knifed in the back of the head in Pucallpa and he wants to 
go and be with him.  He, of course, cannot afford passage and so asked 
Marcial if we could take him back with us.  What were we going to say?  
Also, the Alcalde/health promotor from Paoyhan is going to a training 
session in Tiruntan and asked for a lift.  With the three of us, 
Laureano, his wife and two kids we had a pretty full boat.  We dropped 
the Alcalde in Tiruntan (between Paoyhan and Nuevo Loreto) and picked up 
Laureano's other two kids in Nuevo Loreto and made it to Yarinacocha by 
3:00 in the afternoon.  At the north end of the lake, there is a canyo 
that can be used as a short-cut into the lake when the water is high 
enough.  This saved us a lot of time because we did not have to go back 
to the port.  Marcial dropped us at the hangar and then headed back out 
to the river to return the boat to its caretakers and be picked up by 
Tom Hough and taken into Pucallpa.  It rained all day and we were 
grateful for the roof on the boat.  Had we been in a no-frills dugout, 
we would have been pretty miserable. [Paul made us a little mat bed and 
I was actually able to sleep when the rain was not coming in from the 
sides.  The rocking motion of the boat and the white noise of the engine 
were perfect for lulling me to sleep.  Paul says maybe I can get a 40 
horse power cradle when we get home! --kt] 
<P>
        When we got back, we found three guys living in our house. [It was 
not exactly the three bears scene; we knew they were coming.  Well, we 
knew two were coming and thought they were staying one day after our 
return and they stayed 4.  But it was fun getting to know them. --kt] 
Their names are Doug, John and Rhett.  Doug was the child of 
missionaries here in Peru and lived in Yarinacocha until he was 11.  
John's parents were missionaries in Brazil where he was born and lived 
until he left to attend college in the USA.  Rhett is a friend of a 
friend who invited himself along.  John and Doug have been traveling for 
7 months, first through Africa and now through South America via Brazil 
up the Amazon and Ucayali to here.  They stopped off here for a few 
weeks on their way to Cuzco and Macchu Picchu.  They have been taking 
video of their journey as well as sending summaries of their trip back 
to their computers.  They have a home page of their journey complete 
with pictures and they hope to have video clips put on shortly after 
they return (around Dec. 15).  If you want to check it out, their 
address is:  http://www.infoplane.com/~doug
<P>
        When we returned we also learned that one of the Shipibo ladies 
(who sells fruit and artesania here on the center) and her husband were 
knifed in a most gruesome way on Monday night.  Rumors say that he used 
to be involved in the drug trade (maybe still?) and that it was a 
revenge killing.  We had been warned about narcotraficantes prior to our 
downriver trip and were told that they kill people in exactly the way 
this couple was killed.  I will not go into details, but, it was pretty 
gruesome. [I will. They sliced their throats and rearranged some of 
their internal organs.  The man's head cranium was smashed with a rifle.  
I know this because one of the other women who sells stuff here felt 
compelled to tell me.  She is the same one who warned me before we left 
that this could happen.  Of course, it does not just happen to anyone; 
like Paul said it was some kind of revenge killing.  I heard that the 
guy was into witch craft and someone had recently died and they were 
blaming him.  It is impossible to know what is true. I am very grateful 
that we were kept safe though.  --kt] Pat is now afraid to go out after 
dark. [I think she was afraid before. --kt]  Pat and Tac have two more 
communities to do and the plan was to commute to them since they are 
near Pucallpa.  Pat wants to go and stay in the communities so we will 
not be out on the lake after dark.  Tac is not in favor of this.  
<P>
<B>Monday, 25 November 1996 -
</B><P>
Tac had set up an appointment at San 
Francisco (45 minutes by peque down the lake) to have the town meeting 
this past Thursday at 2:00.  Guess what?  They did not want to have it 
then so we went over to San Francisco only to wait around for about 45 
minutes and be told that the meeting would be at 7:00 PM on Friday.  
Making the most of a bad situation, Tac arranged to meet with the 
community leaders in Santa Martha on Friday morning to plan the course 
of work there.  That worked out OK and Pat and Tac made both meetings on 
Friday and began interviewing in San Francisco on Saturday.  Sunday was 
a wash and she did not even try because there were 5 futbol games 
scheduled in San Francisco.  [It turned out that it rained most of the 
day Sunday; it would have been hideous to be travelling on the river and 
slopping around the "streets" (=mud) in San Francisco.  We heard that 
Hillary Clinton is supposed to be in San Francisco on Wed. At 10:00.  
This is extremely difficult to believe, but you never know. We will be 
in Santa Martha.  Did any of you hear anything about it? --kt] Today, 
they finished San Francisco and tomorrow they go to Santa Martha.  They 
must finish Santa Martha by Wednesday evening because they lose their 
interpreters at the end of the day on Wednesday.  On Thursday, the 
Bilingual Teacher Training Course (ISPBY) is celebrating 43 years of 
bilingual education in the jungle and we are planning to go and see the 
spectacle.
<P>
        Conference is going on at the center.  All the missionaries from 
all over Peru come here an plan the activities for the following year.  
There are a ton of people here and I am glad to be here in the house 
getting our stuff packed and ready for our departure.  We will be 
spending 4 days in Lima so we can see some of the sights that we did not 
get to see on our lightning fast trip through the first time.  No 
Macchu Picchu; it's just too expensive (bummer).
<P>
[It is Wednesday and we are finished! Finished! We have asked over 250 
villagers the same questions over the course of the past 3 months and I 
am tired.  We still have to pack up and I have to plan what I will say 
to the director of the Bilingual Education unit in the Ministry of 
Education in Lima, but the hardest part is over.  So I still have stuff 
to do, but I am anxious to relax a little, clean my toenails, have my 
mosquito bites heal and see all of you in mid December. --kt]

9/30/96 <P>
Hi Everybody! <P>
I write to you with my feet plunged in a bucket full of ice water.  It's the only relief we can find from our 30-40 mosquito bites on each leg.  Yes, we're back from our first jungle trip. <P>
We visited San Pablo and Dorado, two communities where Yaminahua is spoken.  Less than twenty years ago the Yaminahua were not living in communites, but spread out in the jungle, living in fear and being feared, killing and being killed.  Pat Davis reported that the Machiguenga, who she lived and worked with for twenty years in the 60s and 70s were very much afraid of being killed by the Yaminahua.  In 1996 we found friendly, open-hearted people, most of whom spoke enough Spanish to communicate with us, living in communities and going to school.   In San Pablo we stayed in the house of a linguist who is in the States being treated for cancer. Pat called it the Hilton on the Yurua (the river) because she didn't want us to think every place would be that nice.  They had chairs with backs, tables, and even a 15 gallon drum that when flipped upside down and hooked up with a spiggot made a refreshing shower. They also had two other things in the village that we would find out later in Dorado made all the difference in the world in their quality of life - wells for water and latrines.  The people in San Pablo were pretty healthy.  In Dorado, using the river for everything from bathroom to laundry room made the conditions in their community deplorable.  It was very sad,almost everyone was sick.  (We boiled and strained the water and it was still very gross.  I drank only enough to stay alive and when we got home last night drank a few liters to make up for it.)  We surveyed teachers, leaders and villagers about education, health and language attitudes.  I feel pretty good about what we accomplished.  Some of the people had limited Spanish and we had a hard time getting inexperienced interpreters to tell us what the person being interviewed was saying and not adding their own opinion. The most straight forward questions we can be pretty sure about though. <P>
We found ourselves finishing up our surveys rather quickly in Dorado so we visited the school on Tuesday. After we realized that no real teaching was going on (the teacher was not finished his training and hadn't yet learned that you're supposed to explain stuff to students not just get them to copy into their notebooks) and our butts could take no more of sitting on tree trunks (the students had chairs which were all taken up even though several people were absent, but we won't go there), we decided to leave.  Pat, who had arrived late because she was running a medical clinic from our porch, hung in until the bitter end of math class.  Paul and I on the other hand, took a nice walk into the jungle.  The real primary, virgin, uncut jungle.  It was wonderful.  Teaming with life.  So much activity.  And so dense.  We got stung by a colony of reddish ants and I got stung by one of the ones that really burns and stings and then it goes away after about  5 minutes (Paul had gotten it on his jungle hunt with Juan days before.  See below for a lengthy description.)  We took pictures of many species of lizards and some spiders, a big buttress tree, and even some community spiders who all live together in a barrio.  Paul brought back some armored millipedes that excrete a toxin that smells like almond extract. Unfortunately they died on the plane ride back to Yarinacocha.  Bummer.  Paul wanted to observe their behavior. <P>
One afternoon a guy brought us a papaya.  He wanted to sell/exchange it for a pen.  I felt bad exchanging a pen, especially a pen I had gotten free, for a papaya. But we enjoyed the Papaya and the guy was thrilled to have a pen.  We also paid the children who collected water for us with pens, laundry soap and salt.  It's hard to evaluate how many trips to the river with a bucket of water on your head constitute a pen and how many constitute all the salt we had left in our shaker, but we determined four buckets was a pen and one bucket was a little salt.  We gave pictures from an old calendar to people who participated in the interviews. Wednesday, the day we were scheduled to leave, was the only day we woke up to rain.  I was so scared we weren't going to get to fly because of the weather.  I was so ready for a shower and we didn't have anything else to do in Dorado.  Lots of people, especially women came and sat around to chat with us. A lot of  their babies were sick and Pat had distributed a lot of medicine in the village.  One sick baby with no underwear of any kind had diarrhea right on his mother right on our porch.  It was disgusting, but no one was phased by it.  Anyway, that morning, it just rained and rained.  Pat radioed Yarina every hour starting at 7:00 am.  They kept saying call back in an hour.  We prayed a lot during that time.  Finally at 11:00 they said the plane was leaving at 11:30 to come and get us in Breu (a military base near the border of Brazil), a "two hour" canoe trip from Dorado.  We moved into action.  Well, the river between Dorado and Breu was very shallow in some parts, had lots of fallen logs, and it took over three hours.  Once we had to get out and push to get out over a log; once we had to get and out and walk on the bank while the others pushed, and several times we had to duck under branches.  We finally got to Breu (after the plane, which we had seen overhead.)  We docked the canoe and looked at the bank - it was a steep and muddy incline which we and our stuff had to get up.  It was a joke.  We tried carrying stuff - we had to stop mid-way.  The mud was actually more like clay and we were just slipping all over the place.  What a hilarious sight  - these three gringos slipping up the bank.  The military guard was telling us to take our shoes off, but too late, we were in mud boots by then (the first time our Nike sandals failed us!)  The soldiers had to first take our stuff up the incline for us, then pull and even push us so we could make it.  The SIL pilot stood on the top laughing and wishing for a video camera.  We were all laughing.  We used our drinking water (if you call it that) to wash off our hands and feet.  We wrapped our sandals up in our rain ponchos (oh, did  I mentioned it rained about half the way in the boat?) and flew home barefoot.  I always have to sit in the back because I'm the lightest and this time it was cargo next to me.  When I sat down in the plane I was so relieved and relaxed that it hit me like a ton of bricks how tired I was.  It was a wonderful ride home and our house was like a palace to us.  A shower never felt so good!  Some nice folks, Kay and Willie Gesch, invited us for dinner (good thing, too because we had no food here.) Except for a middle of the night itching fest from our mosquito bites, we slept very well. <P>
Paul's Mono Hunt. <P>
The Saturday we were in San Juan, Juan Perez, the president of the village comes by and says he is going to the "monte" to hunt for monkeys (monos), an important source of leathery protein.  We headed out at about 9:00 and I figured that we shouldn't be gone too long because I could see great habitat not far away. This was my first big mistake.  We walked about two hours before we saw mnkeys and the first troup eluded us.  Then we came across a tapir wallow and tracked it through the jungle until we heard it in a reek bed off the main trail.  We chased it and I swung around downstream to head it off when I heard Juan shoot.  But I could still hear the tapir coming down the creek. Juan then called for me and it turned out that while chasing he tapir he had stumbled upon a Sickle-winged guan (Chamaepetes goudotii-they have a guide to South American birds here at the center) and killed it as the tapir was getting away.  As we walked along Juan told me Yaminahua names to about 50 different trees al of which I can't remember.  I saw a large spider web and asked him if it was made by a large spider or a small spider.  He said a small spider and I said with incredulity that this must be an extraordinary spider and then he explained that it was a barrio of spiders, a communal species which I also saw at Dorado. <P>
We continued on and eventually turned off the main trail as Juan hacked his way through the jungle with his machete.  Juan"s dogs dug up a red-footed tortoise which Juan strapped onto his daughters head (actually the tortoise was on the back with the weight of the tortoise being supported by means of a sling around the top of the head--it weighed probably half her weight). By about 11:30, Juan was asking his wife for directions back to the trail and I started asking which way the casa was.  He had asked me just before we turned off the trail if I wanted to return to the village and, not wanting to hold up his family with having to take me home, I said no.  Second big mistake.  Somewhere during this time, I brushed up against a tree that ad some small, dark red ants.  Before I knew what I had gotten into, my hand was on fire.  I brushed away the ants and a few seconds later all the muscles of my left hand began to cramp.  I obviously was on the verge of panic when Juan said that I had been stung be an ant called the tacanara and not to worry the effects would wear off in about five minutes, which they did. <P>
We walked until 1:45 before we finally found the trail and Juan looked at me as if to say, "What were you worried about you stupid gringo," but he looked as relieved as I felt.  Shortly after finding the trail. we encoutered another troup of monkeys.  The strategy in monkey hunting is to chase the monkeys from the ground so that they don't stop and hide.  So we all took off running after the monkeys while Juan tried to get off a shot (he hunted with a sixteen guage shotgun).  The terrain was very hilly and we occassionally went quite a ways from the trail.  Juan ended up shooting 4 monkeys (in about 40 minute of running around after them) but only three fell to the ground.  He climbed one tree looking for the monkey only to discover that it was in the adjacent tree.  The tree containing the monkey was infested with some arboreal ants so Juan took his machete and proceeded to chop the tree down.  It was about two feet in diameter!!  Twenty minutes later the tree fell, Juan extracted the monkey, made a basket out of palm leaves, strapped it to his wife's head and we headed home.  By this time I was on the verge of passing out, from lack of water and I said that I must get some water.  He said that clean water was only a few streams away so I took the tortoise (now strapped from my head, the little girl took the guan, the wife strapped the monkeys from her head, placed the one year old baby on her shoulders and headed out at an unbelievable pace. We finally got water (who knows how many amoebae-thank God for papaya seeds) and finally made it home.  Our little house of palm bark and palm leaves never looked so good.  Juan offered us one of the monkeys but we declined as we already had leftover chicken and yuca stew.  Thus ended our monos adventure. ------------------- Robb and Beck- We got your letter today! It was a treat. Keep `em coming! We did get your email and are happy for any kind of news.  You mentioned that Beth finally got her dress.  I'm glad to hear it.  What's it like? What about ours? Any hope for long sleeves? (See if you can talk her into flannel, that'd be warm and comfortable.) Thanks for the pictures too.  You guys are so cute. Send more if  you have any; I want to see your new hair, Beck. If we came home now we'd have enough stories to keep you up several nights in a row.  By December, we'll have enough news for a month!  So sleep now:)  Beck, they have a box here for emails that are received but they don't know who they're for and in it was one from the Penners in Japan.  Weird, huh?  We love you. <P>
Robin- If you could have seen me this past week, you'd be changing your Amazon princess image.  I look like I have chicken pox from the mosquito bites, and of course I can't shave or they'll  become infected.  I sort of washed my hair once or twice.  But the good part was there was no mirror, so only everyone else knew how bad I looked.  Now that I think about it, maybe compared to the Yaminahua people I did look like a princess.  In spite of it all, we *are* having a great time.  I heard from Carole.  One more person over the comps hurdle, that's a relief.  How's the dissertation coming along? And is anything else new? Write when you can; I miss our Saturday lunches in the lounge.  No baby carrots here. Could you try to unsubscribe me from the Infoling list.  I'm somehow still on.  I might have saved a file from them on how to do it in my directory. Also, I ended up without Laurel's email address.  Can you forward messages to her and give me her address so we can get her on the Peru listserv? Thanks a ton. <P>
[editor's note:  she can join the listserv herself, see footer] <P>
Stephanie- It's been so nice to hear from you.  I'm glad you're enjoying our jungle saga.  If it gets dull, let us know.  However, if you really are interested you can probably catch the slide show at New Year's or so when we're at my Mom's. Will you guys be in NJ for the holidays? How's your jungle (NY)?  How are plans going for Nairobi? <P>
Carole- Congrats on the comps!!!! I know how you feel. How's the TA and RA going? Any changes in the 217 situation or are you still there temporarily?! Greetings to David. <P>
Irene- It's a far cry from Sendai, but always an adventure. I'd love to see you when you're in TX in the Spring. Let me know in advance if you can.  Paul and I can use it as an excuse to visit Austin. I'll be writing up the results of this study in the form of a dissertation, but I'm sure I'll be ready for a break. <P>
Mike Harvey- Killer herps in the jungle.  We were near the border of Brazil and Peru on the Yurua River.  The nearest town that you could find on a map would be Puerto Breu (we were upriver at places that will never make a map).  I saw a black dendrobatid (or maybe mimic) with three longitudinal neon green stripes on the dorsum and longitudinal green stripes on the legs (sorry, no picture.  I was fighting for survival at that point). Lots of tortoises.  I got pictures of some river turtle at Juan's brothers village.  At Dorado (primary forest a mere 5 minute walk away), I photographed a bunch of herps-a single colubrid, some teiids, anoles, toads, and leptodactylids.  Back at Yarinacocha, I caught the largest treefrog that I have ever seen.  It is 3.5 inches long, has a grayish green dorsum with warty skin, most prominently on the sides, horizontal pupils of course and gold flecks in the iris.  When I caught him, he excreted the stickiest substance that I have ever seen come from a frog.  Even worse than Christine's Discoglossus.  Any ideas what it might be? They live in a drain pipe here on the center.  I am slowly building a photographic file of things in this part of Peru.  I'll be interested in getting with you when we return. <P>
Dan Formanowicz- I guess you read about the millipedes.  They are really cool.  I am going to attempt to find more of them as I will be in more primary jungle as time goes on.  As it turns out, it is not illegal to take invertebrates out of Peru into the States but I unfortunately didn't bring any alcohol with me.  All I can get here is isopropyl.  I put the millipedes in it.  If you could send me some vials of ethanol with stoppered lids I may be able to come back with some nifty stuff.  (Get snail mail address from Amaya. Send it to the Pucallpa address.)  Also, I have need for some of those little capsules that we found when we moved to the basement. They are like Contact capsules.  I think Brodie used them to feed noxious substances to animals  when they wouldn't eat it without covering it.  About a hundred should do.  I saw a colony of social spiders about 30 or so feet high in the forest near Dorado and a smaller one of the same species near San Pablo.  The ones in Dorado were nailing a pretty good sized assassin bug. We leave again for upriver Ucayali next Tuesday and I'll be packing vials of isopropyl.  There is evidently a frog living on the center that is capable of killing a dog if the dog is stupid enough to eat it.  I'll keep you posted as things develop.  Let me know what Keck decided to do about the Janzen manuscript.  Did we ever hear about the NSF proposal? <P>
Chris Amaya- How's the job search going?  I hope it's not bogging you down too much.  Words cannot describe this place.  I may not have a job but I have already had a once in a lifetime experience.  I assume that you are forwarding these messages to any interested parties (Brown, O'Connell et al.).  How's Barbara's job?  <P>

     We are about to head out to the Yaminahua and only have time for a short note.  We have spent the past few days feverishly preparing for the trip and the plane is due to leave shortly after 9:00 this morning.  Yesterday we spent returning one Primus that was supposed to be new and obviously had already had a previous life.  A very long day.  THis a.m. when we woke up it was raining, but nowlooksgood for a clear flight. <P>
We are thrilled to get em, and appreciate any word from home - so keep it coming. Well, we're off. Forward this message or the idea to our list. Thanks. <P>
Love, <P>
Kath and Paul <P>
PS Pray for our safe return about this time next week. More then! <P>

12 September 1996 <P>
Hello world, <P>
(As we mentioned in our previous letter, due to the fee for  sending email [$.50] we are sending a general letter with messages  for individuals following.) We are still here in Yarinacocha making the final preparations for  our first river trip to the Yaminahua groups along the Rio Yurua.   We will be leaving as early next week as we can.  We are trying to  share a flight with a Korean missionary going to the same area in  an effort to stay under budget.  Overall, it is a logistical  nightmare.  We have been helped immensely by Wade ten Bensel, the  SIL flight coordinator, with scheduling jungle flights and  gathering gear.  Our trip to the Yaminahua has been scaled back  and we won't be going to visit the Amahuaca.  Thereore, the trip will only be about a week long.  Things are beginning to really  come together.  We spent this morning buying gas and kerosene to  send upriver (south) for our trip to the Shipibo along the Rio  Ucayali that we will hopefully embark upon on the first or second  of October.  A man (Herman) from the village in which we will land is going home today and has agreed to take some heavy gear so as  to cut down on the weight in the plane (the plane can only carry  about 430 kilos and the three of us weigh 186 kilos).  Pray that  we see our $120 worth of food and $90 worth of gas and kerosene in  Caco when we arrive on 1 October.   <P>
We have acquired jungle hammocks where we will sleep while we are  out and have bought Primus stoves which are the South American  answer to the Coleman stove.  Primus operate on kerosene which is  why we will be carrying kerosene.  We plan to eat tuna, rice,  pasta and some canned fruits and veggies we sent in the package  that went out today.  We dont know why fruits and vegetables  aren't available in the areas where we are going, but thats what Pat told us.  A lot will become clear to us as we go.  Around here  bananas, mangos, and lemons are in large supply.  We also found  out that crushing up Papaya seeds and swallowing them makes a very  unpleasant environment for amoeba to live it.  Since we're not looking to host any, we're planning to try it.  They are said to taste disgusting, but with a Hershy kiss chaser (we're rationing the small bag we brought from the States) we think we can manage. <P>
Individual messages follow: <P>
John Paolillo: We've been gathering loads of information since we got here.  In particular, two guys who work at the government sponsored  bilingual print shop near here have been extremely informative  about the Shipibo.  There seems to be lots of potential for  contrast within the Shipibo group (some have had BE for along  time, some have rejected it until recently, one community is  rumored to have a discoteque, another is said to still be wearing  traditional garb.)  It may prove fruitful to do a within group  comparison since the ethnolinguistic one is arbitrary anyway. That  is, the language itself isn't expected to be a variable in the impact of or factors affecting BE. I'm keeping my options open and at the same time trying to develop a good study.  Our surveys have  improved greatly since you last saw them, and we are planning to  test them on some Machiguenga people who are in the area studying.   We're not going to go to any Machiguenga areas, but since Pat speaks that language that may help us determine if the questions  are understandable, if people prefer their native language etc.   I'll keep you posted as things progress. Say hi to people in the Ling Dept. from me. Tac <P>
Tree and Eric, How's it going? As you can see we're busy as ever, but in a different way than in Arlington.  Now we have to think about  preparations for our time in the villages - like how we can get  enough clean water to drink, and what to do to prevent illness,  etc.  And that's just maintenance, the project itself requires a load of logistics.  We're getting antsy to get going on our first trip, but it'll be a few more days.  Before we go though, we wanted to try to get this message to you so you can add us to the  memory book you're making for Granny.  By the way, how's Rose? We miss her, but we know she's in good hands. <P>
Dearest Granny, On this occassion of your 85th birthday we want to express our  love and fondness for you and share with you how much we  appreciate your participation in our wedding.  That you were  willing to take your first (but hopefully not last) air flight to  be with us on such a joyous day was very special to us.  And what  made it extra special was that you gave us your wedding band for  Tac to wear and always remember you by.  We wish we could be there  to share your special day.  We will be thinking of you and wish  you many more. Happy Birthday.  Love, Paul and Tac <P>
 <P>

9/10/96 <P>
Hello all, <P>
        We are currently in Yarinacocha, Peru at the Summer  Institute of Linguistics (SIL) compound.  For those of you  who failed to receive our letter before we left, Yarinacocha  is halfway between Iquitos and Cuzco along the Ucayali  river.  There is an oxbow lake here that we can see from  just outside our house.  There is a map in the May issue of  National Geographic magazine.  We are currently living on  the compound of the Summer Institute of Linguistics in a two  bedroom/two bath house made of wood and elevated a few feet  on stilts.  It is much nicer than our pad back in Arlington  and the scenery is much more interesting.  We have been  spending the past week preparing to make our first jungle  trip to visit two tribes near the Brazilian border.  The two  tribes are the Amahuaca and the Yaminahua.  Both groups have  a few villages near the Peruvian air force base at Puerto  Breu.  We will take a jungle flight to a village on the  upper reaches of the Ucayali River near where the Inuya  River joins the Ucayali.  Tac and Pat will survey that  village then we will fly to the area near Puerto Breu after  which we will travel along the river visiting villages until  we call for a plane to pick us back up at Breu.  <P>
This should all take about 2 weeks so we have been trying to  get logistics worked out (camping gear, mosquito nets, pots  and pans, etc.).  After we return from that trip, we will be  at Yarinacocha to regroup/recover/take a shower/eat some  M&Ms before setting out on a series of trips by boat up and  down the Ucayali River to survey the Shipibo villages.  That  should occupy the remainder of our time in Peru. <P>
        The people here are very hospitable.  We have been the  toast of Yarinacocha largely on the basis of Pat's fame in  this region.  Pat worked for about 20 years with the  Machigenga people who live upriver (south) of here and has a  great deal of experience here in Peru. Everything takes  about thirty times as long to do in Peru as it does in the  States.  For example, the one hour foto place in Pucallpa  (the nearest city) took three days because the power was  out.  Not really a surprise actually.  Pat has really been  great in terms of helping us work through things and making  preparations.  We have had some difficulties.  The first day  we were in Lima, I dropped my camera in a fit of  carelessness and knocked out my light meter.  We tried to  get it fixed but couldn't  (big surprise).  After we arrived  in Yarinacocha, Tac's camera stopped forwarding film.  We  have borrowed a spare Cannon AE-1 from Willie Gesch who  bought it for $70 from a missionary who was going home.  It  was the steal of the century (camera body, and four very  nice lenses including a couple of different macros).  He  told us to take and use it as much as we like.   <P>
        There are ants everywhere here.  In the tree outside  our house, on the counter inside our house, and even in  Tac's backpack.  There is also a healthy dose of other  wildlife.  Frogs, lizards and birds in abundance just on the  grounds of the SIL compound.     <P>
        About e-mail.  You should be sure to put "message for  TACELOSKY" in the subject line.  The e-mail system is very  much like a general delivery post office box and it must  have Tac's name clearly and obviously displayed in order  for it to find its way to us.  In addition, it costs us more  money to send e-mails than snail mail but it is faster. It  costs us nothing to receive e-mail, so please write back.   Therefore, we have decided that we will  write general  updates to all our friends and then address specific details  to individuals after the main message (these are the things  you do under these types of circumstances).  If it's anything personal, don't worry we'll use good judgment and send individual messages.  Well, that's about all from this end.  We will keep you apprised of our progress as we do more things and get back to e-mail to report them. <P>
Love, Tac and Paul <P>
Notes to individuals:  (If yours isn't  here, it may be on its way as we are pushing the envelope of what Peruvian phone lines are capable) <P>
UTA Biology Department,         Things here are going well.  About a billion wolf  spiders and one tarantula (destined for the insect  collection of one of the students here) but no research  being done yet.  The area around the SIL compound is pretty  messed up and I haven't had a chance to take some walks  scoping things out.  Someone please copy the note to Keck  (below) and see that he gets it. <P>
Mike Harvey,         The book you gave me is useless here.  I have seen 7  species of frogs/toads and none of them match up to the  descriptions in Duellman's guide.  We must be too far south  of Iquitos.  I will be taking pictures of everything I  catch.  This place is very cool.  SIL is scaling back its  operations in preparation to move out of Peru.  Their  complex is very nice (you can drink water from the faucet,  etc.) and they are slowly selling pieces of it off.  It  would be a pity for such a nice set-up to fall into the  disrepair that seems inevitable at the hands of the  Peruvians.  A four bedroom, two story house was bought for  $3000 by Willie Gesch (one of the missionaries here, see  above).  I'll send more details later as I find out what the  fate of this place will be. <P>
Mike Keck,         I received an e-mail from Shyrill O'Steen.  She seems  to agree with both us and Jim Bull.  She thinks that our  point is well taken and that Jim was merely making a  theoretical point.  Of importance is that Jim has the  results of her research wrong.  She has four temperature  treatments, two single sex treatments and two mixed sex  treatments.  She found reduced survivorship from the two  mixed sex treatments with the "more extreme" mixed sex  treatment having the lowest survivorship.  You can write her  at sosteen@uci.edu for more detailed info.  As far as I am  concerned, revise the manuscript as we had discussed and  resubmit it to Evolution.  I think we are still on solid  ground and Fred is still in trouble.  I suggest that when  you submit it that you recommend Shyrill O'Steen as a  reviewer.  Copies of the manuscript are in the ms directory  in AmiPro on my hard drive which is in the basement.   Good Luck. <P>
Robb and Beck, Thanks a lot for your email.  It's great to hear from you. As you can probably tell, Paul wrote most of the above (and  does virtually everything to keep us going - shopping,  cooking etc.) because I'm super busy with the project.  Im amazed at how literally from one day to the next our focus  shifted from all the things we were concerned about in  Arlington to putting sulfur in our socks to avoid chiggers  and warning signs for amoebae.  By the time you get this  (email takes about two days) we'll be off on our first trip. It's far from the base here (2 weeks if we were going in a canoe with a small motor, and hour and a half by the plane  that will take us.)  Pray for clean water, sufficient  nutrition, avoidance of disease ridden insects, and success  of the project.  We will be trying to accomplish a lot in a  short period. We love you guys. Keep writing. You'll hear from us in a couple weeks when we get back.  Pass on info to  mom (edit as you see fit.) I'm planning to call her before we head out. <P>
Beth & Al, Have you heard of Leischmaniasis (a guess at spelling.)?   You get it from a biting fly that comes out at dusk around  water. It's not a problem here at the center (because we have running water in our sinks) but out in the villages  it's kind of scary.  If you get bitten you get sores that don't heal in the area of the bite and then some kind of spirochete that works it's way into the membrane of your nose, destroys it until finally you can't eat and die of starvation.  You can treat it before it gets to that.  Of  course we plan to get our water in the daytime and boil it  early and get under our mosquitero (netting), but don't tell mom about it.  (I don't want her to worry.)  Also, Al's external disk drive is working fine. <P>
Robin Lombard         Tac is working on the Amazon Princess Home Page!!  More  Later. <P>

We left off our story with Tac making arrangements for Paul to go  to the forest with Manuel.   <P>
Friday, 11 October 1996 - Curiaca. <P>
        Thursday morning at 7:30, Manuel came by and picked me  (Paul) up and we headed out hiking in the general direction that I  knew Pueblo Nuevo lay (upstream on the quebrada from Curiaca).  I  asked Manuel if we were on the trail to Pueblo Nuevo and he said  yes and that we were going to his house.  His son attends school  in Curiaca and that is why he was in Curiaca the previous evening.   It was about a 1 hour and fifteen minute hike stopping along the  way to look for frogs.  The habitat was primary, lowland,  floodplain forest and had a good diversity of frog and other  critters.  When we got to Pueblo Nuevo, Manuel began stopping at  all the houses of his friends, explaining who I was, what was  going on in Curiaca with the educational research and basically  hanging around until someone in each house offered him a bowl of  masato.  Masato is a drink made by fermenting yuca gruel.[The way  you get the yuca to ferment is by chewing it up and spitting it  back in the pot.  Pat said the cooking kills just about  everything, "although I'm not sure about TB" consoling, huh? It is  said to be made with sugar now to ferment it rather than saliva;  we know some people who have their doubts -kt]  It is pretty  disgusting (not to mention, not very safe) and all the Shipibo  make it.  At any rate, I met Jose Cervantes, a very nice man who  made me feel right at home, as well as another relative of  Manuel's who was busy making tinajas.   <P>
        About halfway through the village (the village is about 3 km  long), a young tough looking guy and his hood friend came up to me  and told me that extranjeros were not permitted in Pueblo Nuevo  without written permission and that I had better leave the village  immediately.  I acted like I did not understand what he was saying  (not a difficult part for me) and called to Manuel who motioned  for me to follow him.  Manuel and I went to his house and I hung  out while he visited with his family as they butchered a cow that  had died giving birth the previous night.  The remainder of the  trip to Pueblo Nuevo was uneventful and Manuel really got into  catching frogs on the way back to Curiaca,  Later in the day, Tac  and Pat went to Pueblo Nuevo to hold the community meeting and  conduct the lottery.  As they arrived, the sky opened up and it  rained until close to dark.  The meeting was rescheduled for the  following morning at 8:00.   <P>
        We woke up this morning and were in Pueblo Nuevo by shortly  after 8:00.  It did not matter because the meeting did not start  until about 9:15.  By 10:45 we had permission to conduct the study  in Pueblo Nuevo, but things are not going very smoothly.  The  village leader who had given me a hard time had no time to be  interviewed.  A man named Dilver Tangoas refused to be  interviewed.  Fernando asked him why and Dilver said that a number  of years ago some white researchers had come through asking  questions and three days after they left, his son was attacked by  a white person who tried to kill his son.  Fernando asked if it  was the same people or if it was just a coincidence.  Dilver said  it was just a coincidence but he still wouldn't participate.  We  moved on to the house of Miguel Vasquez Barbaran, the former  Teniente Gobernador, to find a replacement for Dilver.  We told  him that Dilver had denied us and why and Miguel replied that  people who would not participate were ignorant and simple and that  the son of Dilver had actually been attacked by a mad bull.  As a  white person from the U.S., it feels strange to be the object of  fear, hatred and prejudice.  It is an uncomfortable, stifling and  oppressive feeling. <P>
Saturday, 12 October 1996 - A bumper day for frogs.  It rained all  last night.  Tac and Pat went to Pueblo Nuevo and I stayed back to  organize our life (boiling water, inventorying food, etc.).  At  about 9:30 a guy named Gustavo came by and asked me if I wanted to  go to Pueblo Nuevo with him.  I said sure.  Then he asked if I was  willing to pay him (I had been forbidden to move around Curiaca  without the escort of a Shipibo).  I asked him how much.  He threw  it back to me and I threw it back at him.  He said 10 soles and I  laughed.  I just let him sit there until he was about tired and  ready to leave and I suggested 5 soles and he took it.  He was  dressed in soccer gear (a game was scheduled in Pueblo Nuevo), so  I told him that I did not want to go to the soccer game that what  I wanted to do was look for frogs along the trail between Curiaca  and Pueblo Nuevo.  He said that was fine and we started off.  As  we neared Pueblo Nuevo, a family of 6 passed us on the trail and  asked us what we were doing.  They joined in the frog hunt and  then moved on down the road.   <P>
        When we reached the edge of Pueblo Nuevo, I told Gustavo  that we needed to return as I had a lot of work to do back in  Curiaca.  He said we could return in the afternoon in the boat and  I told him that our agreement had been to go to Pueblo Nuevo and  return immediately.  [As you can see Paul's Spanish is coming  right along.  Like I try to tell my students, funny what you can  say when you have to.--kt]  We went and found Tac conducting an  interview and she clarified my position and I agreed to let him go  to the football game for a half hour.  After that time I found him  playing soccer and called him off the field.  He did not come so I  yelled at him that if he did not come now he would not be paid.   He came.  When we hit the trail home, he was blazing, I assume  intending to ditch me in Curiaca and return to the soccer game.  I  just took my time, maybe even moving slower than I might otherwise  have.  Such is the cost of forcing people to pay for accompaniment  around the villages. <P>
        Pat and Tac returned at about 5:00 with grim news from  Pueblo Nuevo.  As the day wore on, more and more people refused to  be interviewed.  Evidently the village leader never really wanted  us there anyway.  There were a bunch of Madereros (lumbermen)  running around town who looked pretty rough and Artemio and  Fernando thought that they may have been narcotraficantes and that  the village leader (a very young man not from Pueblo Nuevo)  probably did not want us snooping around his back yard.  In  addition, rumors were being circulated that we were pishtacos and  that we had forced all the women wearing traditional dress in  Curiaca into a dungeon overnight (we do not even know where the  dungeon in Curiaca is located; although if we did, you can bet  that Tac would have wanted to get a picture for the home page).   Anyway, Artemio and Fernando became more and more uncomfortable as  the soccer fiesta progressed and people had more masato and became  more drunk and paranoid.  Overall, everyone was glad to say good- bye to Pueblo Nuevo. <P>
Tuesday, 15 October 1996 - Curiaca. <P>
        On Sunday night (7:00) we headed to Caco Macaya for the town  meeting.  It went very well.  We returned Monday morning to  conduct interviews in the large community house where they wished  to be interviewed, not out of fear but because this was the type  of purpose that the community house had been constructed.  As we  left Curiaca on Monday morning, the Primaria class presented each  of us with a necklace that they had made for us.  We were very  touched after so many bad experiences in Sempaya, Fatima and  Pueblo Nuevo.  I processed data during the day while Pat and Tac  interviewed comuneros.  It rained very hard all day long.  We  returned in the dugout canoe after dark, Fernando lighting the way  with a flashlight and pointing out the reflections from the eyes  of caimans as we went. <P>
        Today, I stayed behind in Curiaca to pack up in preparation  of our trip to Amaquiria tomorrow.  This morning, we were informed  by radio that Artemio is being required to return to the Bilingual  Print Shop.  We have authorization for him to be gone the entire  three weeks but something has evidently changed.  David Archibald,  the director of ILV at Yarinacocha thinks we should just ignore it  because we have the authorization papers in our possession.  If  Artemio has to go back we will all pack up as the interpretation  skills of Artemio and Fernando have proven to be invaluable.  [We  found out later that a possible reason that Artemio was being  asked to come back was because there is talk that he is being  considered as the new director of the bilingual teacher training  program here in Yarinacocha; but do not tell anyone because he  does not yet know that he is being considered.]  Not only that,  but they have worked beyond what most people would have  contributed to the research.  Our plan for tomorrow is to have  Artemio and Fernando go to Caco Macaya to gather stories that will  be published in Shipibo while we pack up so that we can all head  to Amaquiria (or Yarinacocha) as soon as they return. <P>
Saturday, 19 October 1996 - Colonia del Caco. <P>
        A lot has happened since I last wrote.  The trip to  Amaquiria was without incident.  Arturo's boat was beginning to  take on water but, other than that, everything was fine.  We  stopped in Colonia del Caco where Fernando picked up some sedas  (eating bananas) from his family's chacra.  Amaquiria turned out  to be up a large quebrada that went toward the mountains that I  had been yearning for and it even turned out to be on the right  side of the river.  I was finally within walking range of the  mountains.  We were given the use of a run-down, abandoned house  (complete with many mosquitoes and the meeting was scheduled for  8:00pm).   <P>
        The meeting was interesting.  Artemio used to teach here and  was aware that the Shipibo here were on the way toward becoming  mestizado (mestizoized Indians).  Twelve of 51 households are  mestizo.  For the first time, the meeting was conducted primarily  in Spanish with interpretation provided for those Shipibo who were  Spanish challenged.  In all other communities, the meetings were  primarily in Shipibo with translation into Spanish being provided  mainly for the mestizo teachers.  Thursday morning, I was invited  to go to a chacra farmed by three guys:  Alfredo (father), Abel  and Jaime (sons).  It was pretty uninteresting but they took me to  a quebrada that flows out of the mountains.  It was clear and cool  and I had a nice swim.  Afterward, they allowed me to pick some  papayas for myself (they do not eat them) and we loaded up bananas  and headed back to Amaquiria.  Along the way, I learned that there  was a Campa village named La Selva about 45 minutes away, at the  base of the mountains.  I also learned that it was a 3 hour hike  to the first ridge and six hours to the higher, central highlands.   I resolved to walk to La Selva and find they trail to the  mountains in the afternoon.  I made it to La Selva and found the  trail to the mountains but did not have the time to explore it.   Tac and Pat finished 12 comuneros surveys and the health promotor. [Do you get the idea that if I were writing this everyday it would  be "interview X number of people today, ate dinner, went to  bed...? The work is pretty tedious and Paul does have most of the  fun (he also does a lot of the grunt work, housework), but I can  not think of a more fun way to do the data gathering for my  dissertation.  Hearing people's opinions and ideas is really quite  interesting and it sure beats running spiders down racetracks 15  hours a day.  The hard part is when the "work" (interviews) is  over, it is a ton of work just to get dinner and get safely under  mosquito netting before getting eaten alive.--kt]         Friday morning, I went to Abel's house to ask if he was  willing to walk to the mountains with me.  The previous day he had  offered to take me canoeing up the quebrada but it would take too  long in a canoe.  He said he would so I went and told Tac the  plan.  When I returned, Abel told me that he needed to go and work  his chacra but that a mestizo named Salvador would go with me.  We  set out for La Selva at 7:51 and arrived at 8:25.  La Selva is a  pleasant community located right on the banks of the swift flowing  quebrada and does not seem to be a plagued with biting insects.   From La Selva, we turned almost due west and began to climb up a  road that was built so that a "tractor" could be brought into the  mountains for a large lumber operation.  It was very overgrown and  the path had been cleared for the road, but the area to each side  had not been logged.  About 15 minutes outside of La Selva, I saw  my first poison arrow frog in the wild.  Pretty cool.  Over the  next 5 hours I would see 5 species of toads, one species of poison  arrow frog (one of which was carrying tadpoles on its back) and a  number of foam nests made by leptodatylids.  Salvador told me  about a large species of frog which must be among the largest in  the world based on his description and the burrows that he  attributed to it.  We also saw a variety of monkeys, toucans and  heard calls from tapirs in the forest as well as saw jaguar  tracks.  At times, I was glad that Salvador was armed.  We covered  elevation which I estimate at between 1500 (La Selva)-3500 (the  highest point in the first range)feet (elevation on air charts are  not reliable in this part of the jungle).   <P>
        This morning we were up at 5:20.  We had the boat packed and  were on the river by 10:30.  Before we left, a woman brought me to  see a 2 meter long shushupe (bushmaster, a large pit viper) skin.   I asked her where she got it and she said the mountains (where I  had been the previous day.)  We traveled first to the village of  Nazaret where we have been asked to speak to the village leaders  and teachers about bilingual education since we were unable to  conduct the study in their village.  We are currently in the  Inicial, Tac and Pat have already spoken and Artemio is going off  in Shipibo about Pedagogy.  I will soon be bored as we also have  to listen to Fernando and that will all be in Shipibo as well. <P>
Sunday, 20 October 1996 - Colonia del Caco. <P>
        Too hot even to write!! [It was hot, but we remembered you  on your birthday, Mike.  I prayed for you at breakfast and wished  for a piece of birthday cake.  There was none, but Pat made  bisquits which considering the conditions might as well have been  chocolate birthday cake. --kt] <P>
Monday, 21 October 1996 - Colonia del Caco. <P>
        We arrived in Caco at about 4:00 in the afternoon on  Saturday.  It was really hot.  We were given the old health clinic  to stay in (they recently built a new one) and it is about 600  meters from the river.  The good thing about government funded  buildings in the jungle is that they have waterproof roofs and  good solid walls.  The bad thing about government funded buildings  in the jungle is that they have waterproof roofs and good solid  walls.  The roofs are made of tin and the walls do not have enough  windows so that they become solar ovens on days like yesterday.   By the time we got our gear to the clinic, we were all soaked with  sweat and the building was so hot that it was difficult to stay  inside long enough to set up.   <P>
        The structure of government funded buildings is a strange  irony.  The people build their houses sensibly:  palm leaf roofs  that breathe well, large breezy porches, many open spaces in the  walls when walls are present.  With the exception of the times of  day when the biting insects are bad, they are amazingly pleasant  places to live.  Yet, when it comes to building a school, health  clinic or library, they use flanged lumber and tin roofing and  make solid walls that make the places so uncomfortable that I  could understand people wanting to stay home.  Pat says that it is  a status symbol to build things the Peruvian way but I think there  is no status is being miserable in an environment where you  obviously know how to stay comfortable.  The meeting with the  community went well (Fernando said that the decision had already  been made but that did not shorten the required 2 hour minimum  meeting time).  This seems to be the most open community we have  been in (on par with Caco Macaya and Amaquiria).   <P>
        Sunday morning we slept in (6:30).  Pat made some biscuits  and we tarried.  Church was supposed to start at 9:15 but people  trickled in until 9:40 at which time it actually began in earnest.   Pat was preoccupied with radio duty.  The previous night at about  midnight, one of the villagers was mistaken for a capybara (a  large rodent and very good eating (so we hear)) and was  subsequently shot in the leg.  At about 2:00 a.m. a woman gave  birth and the nurse who lives next door was called to cut the  umbilical cord.  The villagers do not deal with gunshot wounds  very often and are overreacting, wanting to fly the victim to  Pucallpa for treatment at the "hospital".  According to the nurse,  she was able to remove most of the shot and he is not running a  fever so he will probably be fine.  Some people came by before and  <P>

fever so he will probably be fine.  Some people came by before and  after church to make appointments for interviews.  At 4:00 in the  afternoon, Fernando held a meeting of the church at which we were  presented with a vast array of gifts including necklaces, pottery  and fabrics.  Then the young people presented us with the  performance of a native Shipibo song.  [We were so touched,  especially given the not so warm reception we received in other  areas.] <P>
        During the day, Artemio mentioned that we would probably  finish interviewing by Tuesday morning and that we could probably  be back in Yarinacocha by noon.  Tac asked Pat about the plan and  Pat went off again about how she thought we were moving through  communities too fast and not getting "good answers".  Tension and  frustration levels seem to increase with each passing day.   <P>
Monday, 21 October 1996 - Colonia del Caco. <P>
        Caco is big: 846 people.  They have all levels of school as  well as a vocational school, beyond Colegio (high school).  It is  so big that I am not even going to attempt to find any unspoiled  forest.  We are going to try to leave tomorrow.  Our pace has been  blistering and we are all tired.  Tac and Pat have surveyed 7  communities in 19 days, including travel. <P>
Tuesday, 22 October 1996 - Caco. <P>
        We are mostly packed to return to Yarinacocha.  We radioed  in about the possibility of a plane for today and were told that  today would be better than tomorrow.  Pat is still reluctant to  finish and leave in spite of the fact that she says we have a ton  to do back in Yarinacocha to prepare for our downriver Shipibo  trip.  We radioed this morning and were told that they had a  medical emergency in Huanuco and that the pilot would not be back  until 3:30.  I have everything packed except bedding and pots and  pans.  We have leftovers from last night for lunch.  Pat will not  take down her mosquiteros until she is absolutely sure we will be  leaving.  Pat mentioned yesterday how exhausted she was.  I think  that this mode of travel and the pace of surveying so many  communities is really beginning to take a toll on her.  She has  nearly fallen asleep the last 2 nights as Tac and I have prepared  dinner. <P>
        This morning Pat expressed doubts about the reality of a  downriver Shipibo trip.  She said she was not sure if Filiberto  and Alejandro (two guys from the ministry of education)would find  this type of work "below their station".  She also does not know  if we will have enough money and is concerned about the rumors of  pishtacos.  If we do not have enough money for the downriver trip  we also do not have enough money for any other trip and Tac and I  might as well go home.  If we do have the money, we should get  back to Yarinacocha and start planning.  I also think that if it  is below Alejandro and Filiberto to work hard for something that  will ultimately benefit the ministry of education, then we should  leave their lazy butts at home and find a few Shipibos who are  willing and go get the job done. [I sure hope they do not learn  English and log on to our home page. --kt] <P>
        Last night it rained very hard and the wind was very strong.   Some people who live across the playing fields from us had a fire  on a raised platform in their house and the coals blew onto the  floor and burned their house to the ground.  Tac and I gave them  some of our clothes and the rest of our food in a small effort to  help them out.   <P>
Tuesday, 22 October 1996 - Yarinacocha. <P>
        The plane finally arrived and we got back to Yarinacocha at  5:31.  ILV lanes are not supposed to be out after 5:30.  Wade  pushed things along to get us in on that day.  The plane had taken  off and the air speed indicator did not work.  It returned, was  repaired and took off again which is why we were so late getting  back.  Willie and Kay Gesch had us over for barbecue on homemade  rolls complete with fresh mangos (nice chico ricos without all the  stringiness).  It is now mango season and the air is filled with  the sounds of mangos falling on tin roofs and parrots wheeling in  the skies, lighting in trees and enjoying the harvest.  [Yes, the  mood changes after you have had a shower and some chocolate.  We  are glad to be back to the comforts of clean water and indoor  plumbing.  The downriver trip, complete with two willing Shipibo  translators, is scheduled for Nov 4-19 or so.  We are praying for  enough sunshine to do laundry every three days or so, and good  graces when we arrive at new communities.  Apparently these "bad  white people" stories are running rampant downriver as well. If we  could figure out a way to got our airplane to run on human fat...] <P>
Shirley Eaton, I hope the semester is going well for you.  Are you having a Dia  de los Muertos celebration?  It is said to be a big holiday here  (Todos Santos) which is why we are not travelling until after the  weekend.  We do not want our results to be skewed by hangovers.   Apparently it is one big party. We sent pictures to Mike with some  people going to the US on Sunday (11/3). Watch for them on the  homepage in about 2 weeks.  Feel free to use whatever you like for  the ML newsletter.  I intend to write something for the young  alumni bulletin if I can get a minute.  Have I told you about  Pucallpa?  It is one of the most, maybe the most, hideous cities I  have ever seen; and I like cities.  Maybe we have not seen the right part of it, but it makes Mexico City seem charming.  We ate  at what was supposed to be a pretty nice restaurant the other  night and although the food was decent, it smelled like a sewer.   The jungle villages are a lot more pleasant in spite of lack of  modern amenities. <P>
Robb and Beck, I just wrote a letter to you that you should get next week.  We  will be in the jungle somewhere by the time, but we will be  thinking of you and looking forward to being together soon. <P>
Robin, So great to hear your voice for one second today!  Thanks for  handling things. I wish we could have chatted longer.  I realized  that I do not even have your home phone number or address.  You  should give them to me so I can call you when I get home.  We will  be neighbors in Duncanville. When does the semester end? Do you  know if they got anyone yet to teach Ling3311 in the Spring?  I  have got to write to Ray and remind him that I need a job.  If  Laurel's not connected, can you get her on the jungle-l? Thanks. <P>
Laurel Mayo, Are you logged on?  How is Klaws? How is life?  <P>
 <P>

<BODY bgcolor="ffffff"><Center><H1>Paul's Mono Hunt</H1></Center>
<P>
The Saturday we were in San Juan, Juan Perez, the
president of the village comes by and says he is going
to the "monte" to hunt for monkeys (monos), an
important source of leathery protein.  We headed out at
about 9:00 and I figured that we shouldn't be gone too
long because I could see great habitat not far away.
This was my first big mistake.  We walked about two
hours before we saw mnkeys and the first troup eluded
us.  Then we came across a tapir wallow and tracked it
through the jungle until we heard it in a reek bed off
the main trail.  We chased it and I swung around
downstream to head it off when I heard Juan shoot.  But
I could still hear the tapir coming down the creek.
Juan then called for me and it turned out that while
chasing he tapir he had stumbled upon a Sickle-winged
guan (<I>Chamaepetes goudotii</I>-they have a guide to South
American birds here at the center) and killed it as the
tapir was getting away.  As we walked along Juan told
me Yaminahua names to about 50 different trees all of
which I can't remember.  I saw a large spider web and
asked him if it was made by a large spider or a small
spider.  He said a small spider and I said with
incredulity that this must be an extraordinary spider
and then he explained that it was a barrio of spiders,
a communal species which I also saw at Dorado.
<P>
We continued on and eventually turned off the main
trail as Juan hacked his way through the jungle with
his machete.  Juan"s dogs dug up a red-footed tortoise
which Juan strapped onto his daughters head (actually
the tortoise was on the back with the weight of the
tortoise being supported by means of a sling around the
top of the head--it weighed probably half her weight).
By about 11:30, Juan was asking his wife for directions
back to the trail and I started asking which way the
casa was.  He had asked me just before we turned off
the trail if I wanted to return to the village and, not
wanting to hold up his family with having to take me
home, I said no.  Second big mistake.  Somewhere during
this time, I brushed up against a tree that ad some
small, dark red ants.  Before I knew what I had gotten
into, my hand was on fire.  I brushed away the ants and
a few seconds later all the muscles of my left hand
began to cramp.  I obviously was on the verge of panic
when Juan said that I had been stung be an ant called
the tacanara and not to worry the effects would wear
off in about five minutes, which they did.
<P>
We walked until 1:45 before we finally found the trail
and Juan looked at me as if to say, "What were you
worried about you stupid gringo," but he looked as
relieved as I felt.  Shortly after finding the trail.
we encoutered another troup of monkeys.  The strategy
in monkey hunting is to chase the monkeys from the
ground so that they don't stop and hide.  So we all
took off running after the monkeys while Juan tried to
get off a shot (he hunted with a sixteen guage
shotgun).  The terrain was very hilly and we
occassionally went quite a ways from the trail.  Juan
ended up shooting 4 monkeys (in about 40 minute of
running around after them) but only three fell to the
ground.  He climbed one tree looking for the monkey
only to discover that it was in the adjacent tree.  The
tree containing the monkey was infested with some
arboreal ants so Juan took his machete and proceeded to
chop the tree down.  It was about two feet in
diameter!!  Twenty minutes later the tree fell, Juan
extracted the monkey, made a basket out of palm leaves,
strapped it to his wife's head and we headed home.  By
this time I was on the verge of passing out, from lack
of water and I said that I must get some water.  He
said that clean water was only a few streams away so I
took the tortoise (now strapped from my head, the
little girl took the guan, the wife strapped the
monkeys from her head, placed the one year old baby on
her shoulders and headed out at an unbelievable pace.
We finally got water (who knows how many amoebae-thank
God for papaya seeds) and finally made it home.  Our
little house of palm bark and palm leaves never looked
so good.  Juan offered us one of the monkeys but we
declined as we already had leftover chicken and yuca
stew.  Thus ended our monos adventure.

This competition was sponsored by the AustralianScience Techers' Association and the Australian Antarctic Division.The competition was open to students in Years 10, 11 and 12 andinvolved the students devising a scientific experiment which theycould carry out either in Antarctica or on the ship on the way to andfrom Antarctica. The prize was to be a trip to Antarctica for 2students and their science teachers.</P><P>In 1986 one of the winning students was Kylie Paish, a Year 11student from PLC Perth, I was fortunate to be her Chemistry teacher.The prize that year was a three week return trip aboard the MVIcebird from Hobart to Casey Base in Antarctca.In 1989 thecompetition was again won by a PLC Chemistry student, Sally Murray inYear 12. The prize that year involved a six week round trip aboardthe MV Polar Queen to Heard Island then to Mawson, Davies and CaseyBases in Antarctica</P><P>The reason for the competition was to draw attention toAustralia's involvement with Antarctica. Since the Antarctic Treatyof 1959 Australia has claimed 42% of Antarctica and maintains 3 baseson the mainland for the purpose of scientific research. Australia'sAntarcticic Territory is administered by the Antarctic Division ofthe Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment,Tourism andTerritories.</P><P>The Antarctic Division organises about 8 voyages to Antarcticabetween October and March while the Antarctic ice cap is negoatiableby ships. The purpose of these visits is to supply the bases and alsoto take scientists and other workers to and from the bases. There areusually a number of 'Round-trippers' like us who go and return on thesame voyage. The Australian Government now has it's own ship theAurora Australis but up to 1990 ships were chartered form othernations.On both trips to Antarctica we flew to Hobart where wevisited the Antarctic Division for the purpose of being supplied withclothing and attending briefing sessions.</P><P>The 1990 voyage took place in January on the MV Polar Queen, asmall Norwegian ship (74m in length). The ship had a crew of 13 andcould accomodate up to 50 passengers. We travelled 4100 km across thesouthern Ocean to Heard Island in very rough seas against head winds,many of the passengers suffered from sea sickness. It was toodangerous for Sally Murray to get out on deck to take water samplesas part of her scientific experiment.</P><P><IMG SRC="09" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=348 X-SAS-UseImageWidthX-SAS-UseImageHeight ALIGN=bottom></P><P>The journey took 13 days and we were very relieved to eventuallyreach Heard Island at dawn on a grey rainy day.The ship anchored somedistance from Heard Island and passengers climbed down a rope ladderinto an amphibious vehicle called a 'Larc' which was operated by menfrom the Australian Army.</P><P><IMG SRC="07" WIDTH=257 HEIGHT=227 X-SAS-UseImageWidthX-SAS-UseImageHeight ALIGN=bottom></P><P>Heard Island was given to Australia by Great Britain in 1950 andis Australia's only sovereign overseas territory. It is situatedclose to the Antarctic convergence where the sea is rich in nutrientsso provides an excellent breeding ground in spring and early summerfor many species of penguins and seals, including Gentoo penguins,King penguins, Elephant seals, Fur seals and Leopard seals. Fur sealswere almost wiped out by sealers in the nineteenth century but largecolonies have now reestablished on the lower slopes of the island.</P><P><IMG SRC="06" WIDTH=201 HEIGHT=279 X-SAS-UseImageWidthX-SAS-UseImageHeight ALIGN=bottom></P><P>Heard Island is 42km long and is nearly always cold, wet andwindy. Ice covers 90% of Heard Island but the lower slopes arecovered with moss and grasses. In the centre of the Island isAustralia's highest mountain, Big Ben (2745m) which we were fortunateto view under perfect conditions as the mist cleared on our return tothe ship.</P><P><IMG SRC="02" WIDTH=367 HEIGHT=231 X-SAS-UseImageWidthX-SAS-UseImageHeight ALIGN=bottom></P><P>We next travelled directly west to Mawson Base in Antarctica. Thevoyage now became very interesting as we spent many hours on deckviewing beautiful ice bergs of varied shape, size and colour. Here wecaught our first glimpses of Adelie penguins and Weddell seals wholive among the ice bergs.</P><P><IMG SRC="13" WIDTH=346 HEIGHT=161 X-SAS-UseImageWidthX-SAS-UseImageHeight ALIGN=bottom></P><P>When we came to within 50km of Mawson Base we found that the seawas frozen to a depth of 2m. No ship had reached Mawson so far thatseason.On a previous voyage goods and passengers had beenhelicoptered off the ship. The Polar Queen was able to break ice butit was a slow process taking us 6 hours to travel 1 km. The Captainallowed us to climb down the rope ladder on to the sea ice where theAdelie penguins joined us in a game of ice soccer.</P><P><IMG SRC="14" WIDTH=369 HEIGHT=192 X-SAS-UseImageWidthX-SAS-UseImageHeight ALIGN=bottom></P><P>As we neared land the ice eventually became thin enough for theship to negotiate and we finally reached Mawson Base on January 25th1990 in time to participate in a traditional Australia Day barbecue.</P><P>Mawson is Australia's oldest Antarctic Base having been founded in1954 next to a natural horse shoe shaped harbour. It is a centre forresearch inot Glaciology and Upper Atmosphere Physics. There wereabout 60 people on the base over summer but only 24 would remain forthe winter. In 1990 the huskies were a major attraction at MawsonBase and were much loved by the residents, they were used to pullsleighs in the winter. There are no longer any huskies in AustralianAntarctica as the Government agreed to their removal as part of aninternational treaty concerning the Antarctic environment.</P><P><IMG SRC="05" WIDTH=198 HEIGHT=282 X-SAS-UseImageWidthX-SAS-UseImageHeight ALIGN=bottom></P><P>Mawson is also a centre for Emperor Penguin research. There arelarge rookeries on nearby islands.</P><P><IMG SRC="03" WIDTH=191 HEIGHT=353 X-SAS-UseImageWidthX-SAS-UseImageHeight ALIGN=bottom></P><P>On the way to Davis Base the ship stopped in Pridz Bay to allowresearch scientists aboard the ship to catch thousands of Antarctickrill (Euphasia Superba) to take back to the laboratories in Hobart..Krill are a type of prawn about 60mm long and weighing about 1 gram,they form the basis of many food chains in the Southern Ocean. Thestudy of krill is an important area of research at the AustralianAntarctic Division and could have an important bearing on futureworld food supplies.</P><P>At Davis Base we met up with an IMAX film crew who were making thefilm 'Antarctica' which is still showing in theatres such as theOmnitheatre. We were lucky enough to be taken for a flight in thehelicopter they had been using. This was an unforgettable experiencewith stunning views of the glacier and the sparkling blue oceanstudded with ice bergs.</P><P><IMG SRC="12" WIDTH=335 HEIGHT=177 X-SAS-UseImageWidthX-SAS-UseImageHeight ALIGN=bottom></P><P>A further 'jolly' in an army 'Larc' allowed us to get very closeto the ice bergs. This was not possible on the large ship becauseabout nine tenths of an ice berg is under water and large ships musttravel at a safe distance from them.</P><P><IMG SRC="04" WIDTH=364 HEIGHT=238 X-SAS-UseImageWidthX-SAS-UseImageHeight ALIGN=bottom></P><P>Our final stop was, for me, a return visit to Casey Base which Ihad last visited in 1986. Since my last visit a new base had beenopened which was quite luxorious compared with the previousconditions. However, I was pleased to see that the old base at Wilkeshad not changed and that the colony of Adelie penguins continued tothrive.</P><P><IMG SRC="10" WIDTH=268 HEIGHT=242 X-SAS-UseImageWidthX-SAS-UseImageHeight ALIGN=bottom></P><P>Unfortunately the Antartic School Science Prize Competition wasdiscontinued after 1989. Reasons given were the small number ofentries that the competition attracted among school students and thecost of accomodating 4 extra passengers on the voyage. I am sorrythat present students are denied this opportunity because I know thatthe experience had a tremendous impact on Sally Murray and KyliePaish and fully expect them both to return to Antarctia some time inthe future.</P><P><IMG SRC="11" WIDTH=259 HEIGHT=221 X-SAS-UseImageWidthX-SAS-UseImageHeight ALIGN=bottom></P><P>&nbsp;</P></BODY></HTML>

I am also qualified to teachItalian and German, but have never had the time to teach them.<BR>Outside of school my interests are numerous and exercise-wise include ballroomdancing, aerobics, jogging and walking. I also like reading, gardening (whenI don't have to do too much), movies, cooking (when I have time), craftsetc. I love sunny, warm weather, flowers, animals, outdoors (but not camping),my house and Perth - so I suppose I am a bit of a nature and home lover.I hate the cold!!! I am independent and have travelled extensively in thepast. I am currently involved in a couple of student exchanges. I'm a Virgoso I'm critical and analytical, but it doesn't mean much - I just do it.I also like my house to be clean and tidy, but my car is a mess - purelya utility.<BR>Well now you know me pretty well. <BR><BR>If you'd like to Email me re Jap teaching, student exchanges, etc. my addressis : <A HREF="mailto:dcuneo@plc.wa.edu.au">dcuneo@plc.wa.edu.au <BR><BR></A></BODY></HTML>

Aquariums, scientists, and conservation organizations are collaborating to produce a variety of courses, video tapes, brochures and other educational materials.  Individual coral reef areas are creating or revising management plans for their coastal zones.  With the involvement and financial support of governments, foundations and individuals, all these initiatives are being put into place to insure that the world's coral reefs are preserved for the future.<p><font size=+2><i>On the Science Front:</i></font><br>Bob Ginsburg, along with colleagues from the International Society for Reef Studies (ISRS), is taking a lead role in IYOR's scientific program.  A number of scientists are currently undertaking a review and assessment of reef sites around the world in an attempt to determine the extent of damage being done.  Sites being studied include reefs in the Pacific and Indonesia, Tanzania, the El Nido/Bacuit Bay National Marine Reserve and Tourist Zone in the Philippines, the Bahamas (Abaco), Puerto Rico, and others.<p><font size=+2><i>On the Public Awareness Front:</i></font><br>The IYOR Public Awareness Committee, co-chaired by Stephen Colwell and Sue Wells, is composed of representatives from conservation organizations, scientists, aquariums and government institutions.  The committee will be responsible for developing activities promoting coral reef research, education and conservation.  A number of proposals to publicize IYOR are being initiated.  Public aquariums will sponsor a coordinated curriculum on coral reef conservation, a traveling exhibition of coral reef photography by the world's leading underwater photographers, and a poster contest for school children.  A bilingual public education and outreach program has been organized to travel around the Caribbean and Latin America.  Educational materials are being developed, including maps, manuals, instructional kits, scientific reports, a full-color calendar, and a slide show. <br><p align=center><font size=+1><b> Click here for <a href="activities.html">details on IYOR Activities</a> </p><hr align=center><p align=center>For more information about The International Year of the Reef,<br> please feel free to contact:</p><PRE>Public Awareness Committee          or          Scientific ProgramStephen Colwell                                 Robert GinsburgThe Coral Reef Alliance                         University of Miami64 Shattuck Square                              RSMASSuite 220                                       4600 Rickenbacker Cswy.Berkeley, CA  94704                             Miami, FL  33149tel: (510) 848-0110 fax: (510) 848-3720         (305) 361-4875 fax: (305) 361-4094email: IYOR1997@aol.com                         email: rginsburg@rsmas.miami.edu<p></PRE><p><b>Click here to see <a href="orgs.html">Participating Organizations</a></b><p><hr width="90%"><p><center><a href="http://www.coral.org/"><IMG SRC="Logo.GIF" height=63 width=105 no border><br><font size="+2"><strong>The Coral Reef Alliance</strong></font></a></center><p></BODY></html>

CORAL is one of "the most important [conservation groups] for divers to support . . . CORAL has a record of domestic and international conservation efforts and might be just what hands-on, action hungry divers want." - <em>Rodale's Scuba Diving Magazine, December, 1995.</em><p><strong><font size=+1>Why should I be concerned about coral reefs?</font></strong><p> Coral reefs are a "living rainbow" of color and aquatic life, making them a favorite destination for scuba divers and snorkelers.  They are home to over 4,000 different types of fish and thousands of species of plants and animals.  25% of all marine life depends on coral reefs for survival.<p>Coral reefs are also useful to humans, providing an important source of food and income for millions of people.  Coral reefs contain unique chemicals that have great potential for medicinal use, and they prevent beaches and shorelines from being washed away by acting as natural breakwaters.<p> Unfortunately, we are quickly losing this valuable resource.  Scientific studies show that <em> up to 70% of the world's coral reefs may be destroyed in the next 20-40 years </em> if destruction continues at its present rate.  Certain reefs in Florida and the Caribbean are in critical condition and could be destroyed in 10 years or less if current trends continue, while 70-90% of the reefs in The Philippines and Indonesia are already damaged beyond repair.<p> If we do not do something to halt this rapid destruction, we will lose forever the opportunity to enjoy the beauty and life that make up a coral reef.<p><strong><font size=+1>How does CORAL work toward coral reef conservation?</font></strong><p><li>CORAL helps to provide funding and technical support for coral reef conservation and research programs.  Many communities can't afford to protect their reefs without this help.<p><li>In 1995, CORAL <em> contributed over $73,000 to local organizations</em> in the Caribbean and the Pacific to support reef protection programs, such as putting out mooring buoys and establishing Marine Protected Areas.<p><li>CORAL works with the dive industry, governments, local communities and other conservation organizations to develop conservation strategies that protect coral reefs.<p><li>CORAL's <em> Volunteer Divers </em> help scientific and conservation projects that need assistance.<p><li>CORAL promotes education about coral reefs by distributing information to divers and others to encourage responsible diving and to increase awareness about threats to coral reefs.<p><strong><font size=+1>Where does CORAL get its support?</font></strong><p> CORAL is supported by its members - scuba divers, snorkelers and others from around the United States and the world who want to help keep coral reefs alive.  CORAL also receives grants from foundations and donations from corporations that wish to support CORAL's work.<p><strong><font size=+1>Are donations to CORAL tax deductible?</font></strong><p> Yes, The Coral Reef Alliance is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization, and all donations to CORAL are tax deductible in the United States.<p><strong><font size=+1>How can I become involved with CORAL?</font></strong><p>There are many ways that you can become involved with the Coral Reef Alliance:<p><li><strong><em>Join CORAL.</strong></em>  As a CORAL member, your tax-deductible contribution will go towards supporting CORAL's programs and assisting coral reef conservation efforts world-wide.  You will receive up-to-date information about CORAL projects and activities, have the opportunity to participate in CORAL projects and activities, and can become active as a CORAL Volunteer. <p><li><strong><em>Fill out a Coral Diver Report.</strong></em>  Reports from divers like you are a valuable source of information that is being used to track the condition of coral reefs around the world.  By accessing CORAL's World Wide Web site, you can use the CORAL On-line Network to report instantly on the condition of the reefs you have observed while diving.  This information is forwarded to concerned scientists and conservation groups as a first alert to take action to address new threats to particular reefs.<p><li><strong><em>Become a CORAL Volunteer.</strong></em>  CORAL's Volunteer Network is a great way for you to become actively involved with coral reef conservation .  CORAL will match you with conservation organizations in need of volunteer assistance.  You can take part in projects such as dive clean-ups, research projects, or educational programs.<p><li><strong><em>Take the CORAL Diver Pledge.</strong></em>  You can help protect coral reefs by diving responsibly and encouraging your dive buddies to do the same.<hr width=70%><center><font size=+1><strong>THE CORAL DIVER PLEDGE</strong></font><br><em>Coral reef ecosystems are one of the world's most valuable resources - <br> I want to do my part to keep our fragile coral reefs alive.</em><p><strong>AS AN INDIVIDUAL DIVER,</strong><br>I pledge to dive responsibly, avoiding damage to coral reefs.<p><strong>AS A ROLE MODEL FOR OTHER DIVERS,</strong><br>I pledge to encourage others to respect and protect the reefs.<p><strong>AS A BUYER OR SELLER OF DIVE PRODUCTS / SERVICES,</strong><br>I pledge to make choices that reflect my commitment to keeping coral reefs alive.</center><hr width=70%><p><strong><font size=+1>If I am not a diver, can I still be involved with CORAL?</font> </strong><p> Yes!  Divers are not the only people concerned about the fate of coral reefs.  Any concerned individual can provide invaluable assistance in helping to promote coral reef conservation.  Ask us about our numerous volunteer opportunities for teachers, graphic artists, writers and others.  With the help of concerned individuals like you, we can all play a part in keeping coral reefs alive!<p><strong><font size=+1>Where can I get more information about CORAL?</font></strong><p> To learn more about The Coral Reef Alliance, write to us at the address below, or check out our site on the World Wide Web.<p><center><font size=+1><strong>The Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL)</font></strong><br>64 Shattuck Square, Suite 220<br>Berkeley, CA  94704<br>Tel: (510) 848-0110  Fax: (510) 848-3720 <br> <a href="MAILTO:CORALmail@aol.com"><em>CORALmail@aol.com</em></a></center><br><hr noshade align=center width="90%"><p><center><a href="Home.html"><img src="Menu/*Homepage.GIF" border="0"></a><a href="CORAL.html"><img src="Menu/*AboutCoral.GIF" border="0"></a><a href="Gallery.html"><img src="Menu/*Gallery.GIF" border="0"></a><a href="Member.html"><img src="Menu/*Member.GIF" border="0"></a><a href="Report.html"><img src="Menu/*DiversReport.GIF" border="0"></a><a href="Facts.html"><img src="Menu/ReefFacts.GIF" border="0"></a><a href="Volunteer.html"><img src="Menu/*Volunteer.GIF" border="0"></a></center><p><hr noshade><p><a href="http://www.cea.edu/"><img src="CEA/cealogo.gif" height=39 width=96 align=left align=top no border></a><font size=-1>The WWW server for these WEB pages is provided courtesy of the<a href="http://www.cea.edu/"><strong>Center for Electronic Art</A></strong>, a nonprofit media education and production facility.<p> <center>"Making a difference with technology."</center></font></BODY></HTML>

Our educational programs explain scientific discoveries about coral reefs, highlight the importance of the reefs' extraordinary biological diversity,  draw attention to recent developments (both negative and positive) affecting the reefs, and motivate support for and participation in coral reef conservation efforts.  Information is distributed in a variety of ways, through mailings, press releases, educational seminars, public service announcements, and the Internet.  CORAL has also created  "<em>Coral Reefs - The Vanishing Rainbow,</em> " an educational slide show and script that allows individuals to make their own presentation about the threats facing coral reefs.  Reef Alert provides information to the general public with a particular focus on divers and the dive industry in order to make the most effective use of resources.<p><font size=+1><strong>The "Marine Protected Area" (MPA) program:</font></strong><br>The IUCN, The World Bank and other multinational organizations have joined together to propose the creation of "A Global Representative System of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs)."  MPAs, when properly planned and managed, can help preserve essential species diversity by protecting local marine life, and can help the local economy by creating natural fish nurseries and attracting non-extractive uses of the reefs (such as scuba diving).  One of the most critical elements for success of MPAs is local community involvement in the design and management of the area.  This is particularly true for coral reef MPAs that are frequently located near the coast.  CORAL's MPA program assists coral reef communities in establishing and managing their own MPAs.  It provides resources and materials for projects such as mooring buoy installations, as well as advice and models for creating management plans and enforceable regulations through community participation.  For the long-term, CORAL is creating a Coral Reef Conservation Fund that will provide small grants to support community MPAs and other local reef conservation projects.<p><font size=+1><strong><a href "IYOR/index.html">The International Year of the Reef - 1997</a></strong></font><br>1997 has been designated as the "International Year of the Reef" (IYOR) and CORAL's Executive Director, Stephen Colwell, is co-chair of the Public Awareness Committee.  The Committee is comprised of NGOs, scientists and others from around the world working together to plan events and produce materials that will raise public awareness about the serious threats facing coral reefs.  CORAL is responsible for coordinating the many different public awareness projects inspired by IYOR, and has created a number of programs for The International Year of the Reef, including:<ul><li><em><strong> Coral Reef Masterpieces</strong></em> - a travelling exhibition featuring coral reef photography by the world's leading underwater photographers.  The exhibit will be featured at a number of museums, zoos, and aquariums around the United States througout 1997 and 1998, and will be accompanied by special events, educational seminars and lecture series.<p><li><em><strong> Reef Check</strong></em> - sheduled to take place in September, Reef Check is a coordinated effort by divers and snorkelers to assess the global condition of coral reefs.  Divers will survey reefs around the world in an effort to "check the pulse" of coral reefs.<p><li><em><strong> Public Service Announcements </strong></em> - in cooperation with Earth Communications Office (ECO), CORAL has created a number of public service announcements about IYOR and the state of coral reefs.  These announcements will be aired on television and as movie previews throughout 1997.  In addition, CORAL will be featured in the "Ocean Report" radio announcement produced by the PEW charitable trusts.<p><li><em><strong> The Visionaries</strong></em> - CORAL will be featured in a half-hour PBS series that focuses on our coral reef education and conservation efforts.  The program will air six times throughout 1997 on PBS affiliates.  Check your local station for details.<p><li><em><strong> IYOR Calendar </strong></em> - CORAL has created a special calendar for 1997 in honor of The International Year of the Reef.  The calendar features coral reef photography by renowned underwater photographer Mike Hurley, as well as educational information about coral reefs and the threats that they face.</ul><p><font size=+1><strong>The "Keys Campaign"</strong></font><br>The coral reefs of the Florida Keys are one of the United States' greatest natural treasures, but very few people in the United States know that the reefs are in danger of being killed within the next ten to twenty years.  The Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary and other conservation efforts designed to protect the reefs need both popular and financial support if they are going to succeed in keeping the reefs alive.  The Keys Campaign is a public awareness and advocacy campaign designed to turn U.S. divers into a vocal constituency for the Sanctuary and a valuable source of financial support for coral reef conservation in the Keys.<p><hr noshade align=center width="90%"><p><center><a href="Home.html"><img src="Menu/*Homepage.GIF" border="0"></a><a href="CORAL.html"><img src="Menu/*AboutCoral.GIF" border="0"></a><a href="Gallery.html"><img src="Menu/*Gallery.GIF" border="0"></a><a href="Member.html"><img src="Menu/*Member.GIF" border="0"></a><a href="Report.html"><img src="Menu/*DiversReport.GIF" border="0"></a><a href="Facts.html"><img src="Menu/ReefFacts.GIF" border="0"></a><a href="Volunteer.html"><img src="Menu/*Volunteer.GIF" border="0"></a></center><p><center><strong>The Coral Reef Alliance</strong><br><a href="MAILTO:CORALmail@aol.com"><em>CORALmail@aol.com</em></a></center><br><p><hr noshade><p><a href="http://www.cea.edu/"><img src="CEA/cealogo.gif" height=39 width=96 align=left align=top no border></a><font size=-1>The WWW server for these WEB pages is provided courtesy of the<a href="http://www.cea.edu/"><strong>Center for Electronic Art</A></strong>, a nonprofit media education and production facility.<p> <center>"Making a difference with technology."</center></font></BODY></HTML>

Recently, CORAL has donated over $70,000 to small coral reef groups, including the Palau Conservation Society in Palau.<p><li><strong>Taking the lead in public awareness for The International Year of the Reef -1997.</strong>  1997 has been declared "The International Year of the Reef," (IYOR) and CORAL has taken a leading role serving as co-chair of the public awareness committee for this event.  CORAL coordinates the reef conservation and educational activities of over 50 organizations around the world participating in IYOR.<p><li><strong>Organizing "<em>Coral Reef Masterpieces. </em>"</strong> This exhibition of coral reef photography by the world's most renowned underwater photographers will be displayed nationwide at major aquariums, zoos, and museums throughout 1997 as a part of The International Year of the Reef.  It features dramatic images of healthy and damaged reefs, as well as captions to educate the public about current threats to coral reefs.<p><li><strong>Sponsoring Public Service Announcements.</strong>   In cooperation with Earth Communications Office (ECO), CORAL has created a number of public service announcements about IYOR and the state of coral reefs. These announcements will be aired on television and as movie previews throughout 1997. In addition, CORAL is to be featured in the "Ocean Report" radio announcement produced by the PEW charitable trusts. <p><li><strong>Producing the educational slide presentation: "Coral Reefs - The Vanishing Rainbow."</strong>  In cooperation with The Ocean Futures Foundation, CORAL has created a slide show about coral reefs that is distributed free of charge to divers, conservation organizations, and others to educate the public about the importance of the coral reef ecosystem and the threats that it faces.  <em> Please contact CORAL if you are interested in obtaining a copy.</em><p> <li><strong>"The Visionaries." </strong>  CORAL was selected from over 2,500 nonprofit organizations to be featured in a public television series called "The Visionaries."  This half-hour episode focuses on CORAL's collaborative work with other international organizations.  The program will air six times throughout 1997 on PBS affiliates.<p><li><strong>Creating the "CORAL Diver Network" on the Internet.</strong>  Divers can receive up-to date information on coral reefs around the world and can file reports electronically on the condition of reefs that they have visited.  The CORAL Diver Network also features information on threats to coral reefs, colorful photos of marine life, and connections to CORAL's other programs such as the CORAL Volunteer Matching Services.<p><li><strong>Distributing educational materials for divers, dive resorts and host governments.</strong>  CORAL's "<em>Checklist on Sustainable Dive Tourism in Coral Reef Areas</em> " has been distributed at a major dive tourism conference in the Dominican Republic and to dive tourism operators around the world.  CORAL's brochures, fact sheets, articles and postings on the Internet explain how responsible divers can be "part of the solution .  .  . not part of the problem."<p><li><strong>Participating in major international workshops.</strong>  CORAL has been an invited speaker at The International Coral Reef Initiative in the Philippines, the Caribbean Conference on Sustainable Tourism in the Dominican Republic, the World Bank's Workshop on Sustainable Financing of Coral Reef Conservation in Washington D.C., and has contributed to a number of conservation conferences around the world.<p><li><strong>Sponsoring meetings and educational seminars at dive shows.</strong>  Through these sessions, CORAL has been able to educate divers about dive threats to coral reefs and to promote the exchange of ideas among groups of divers, members of the travel industry and environmental groups concerning the role that divers can play in conservation.<p><p><hr noshade align=center width="90%"><p><center><a href="Home.html"><img src="Menu/*Homepage.GIF" border="0"></a><a href="CORAL.html"><img src="Menu/*AboutCoral.GIF" border="0"></a><a href="Gallery.html"><img src="Menu/*Gallery.GIF" border="0"></a><a href="Member.html"><img src="Menu/*Member.GIF" border="0"></a><a href="Report.html"><img src="Menu/*DiversReport.GIF" border="0"></a><a href="Facts.html"><img src="Menu/ReefFacts.GIF" border="0"></a><a href="Volunteer.html"><img src="Menu/*Volunteer.GIF" border="0"></a></center><p><center><strong>The Coral Reef Alliance</strong><br><a href="MAILTO:CORALmail@aol.com"><em>CORALmail@aol.com</em></a></center><br><p><hr noshade><p><a href="http://www.cea.edu/"><img src="CEA/cealogo.gif" height=39 width=96 align=left align=top no border></a><font size=-1>The WWW server for these WEB pages is provided courtesy of the<a href="http://www.cea.edu/"><strong>Center for Electronic Art</A></strong>, a nonprofit media education and production facility.<p> <center>"Making a difference with technology."</center></font></BODY></HTML>

The construction at Paradise Reef will soon be heard by the NAFTA Commission for Environmental Cooperation.</strong><p>In spite of a referendum held in Cozumel last year which showed that <em>over sixty percent</em> of local residents opposed building the pier at Paradise reef, construction of the pier is already 1/3 complete.  Several other proposed pier sites in Cozumel- acceptable to the cruise lines, divers, and the local community- were rejected by the Grupo Consortio H developers because of their private financial interests.  The developer's "environmental" program to glue chunks of the reef onto concrete blocks in other locations is a farce that will do nothing to save the reef.<p>The construction at Paradise Reef is the first case agreed to be heard by the NAFTA Commission for Environmental Cooperation.  US EPA Administrator Carol Browner, Canadian Environmental Minister Sergio Marchi, and Mexican Secretary of the Environment Julia Carrabias voted unanimously to launch a staff probe looking into the disputed pier development in Cozumel.  It is expected that the NAFTA commission will condemn the actions of the Mexican government for violating its own environmental review laws, but the commission has no authority to penalize the Mexican government or to force them to halt construction.<p>So far, the Mexican government says that it has no plans to halt the construction of the pier.

They host an extraordinary variety of marine plants and animals and are one of the most biologically diverse ecosystems in the world.  They are a significant source of food to low-income coastal communities, a source of income and employment through tourism and marine recreation, and offer countless other benefits to humans, including unique chemicals with medicinal properties.  Despite this, coral reefs  around the world are rapidly being degraded by a number of human activities including over-fishing, coastal development, and the introduction of sewage fertilizer and sediment.  Trade in reef species is a strong additional pressure on this already highly threatened ecosystem.</em><p><strong><font size="+1">Trade in Coral Reef Species</font></strong><p>Coral is often exported from reef areas to be sold as marine souvenirs.  Although coral collection is illegal in the US and a number of other nations, coral and other reef souvenirs can still be legally imported from areas with threatened coral reefs, in spite of the devastation that this trade causes the reef ecosystem.  These destructive trade practices must be stopped.<p><strong><em>Ways you can help stop unsustainable trade in coral reef souvenirs:</em><ul><li>Do not purchase coral jewelry or other marine souvenirs unless you are certain that they have been farmed or produced in sustainable aquaculture operations.<li>Ask suppliers of marine souvenirs where they obtain their stocks, and encourage them to contact government or environmental organizations for advice in regulating collection so that reefs are not destroyed.<li>Support legislation prohibiting the importation of coral for private use.</strong></ul><p>Cyanide, one of the most toxic poisons known, is currently being used to catch live fish in the South Pacific and Southeast Asia.  Fishermen stun the fish with sodium cyanide in order to catch them live to sell to luxury live fish markets in Asia or to tropical aquarium owners.  Cyanide not only poisons the fish, but also destroys their habitat, killing coral polyps and the symbiotic algae and other small organisms necessary for healthy reefs.  Cyanide fishing has already caused mass destruction to coral reefs in the Philippines and Indonesia, and is spreading rapidly to other parts of Asia.  We must halt this criminal practice of coral reef destruction.<p><strong><em>Ways you can help stop cyanide fishing:</em><ul><li>Support legislation prohibiting the importation of fish that have been caught using cyanide.<li>If you own a tropical aquarium, demand that your aquarium store only purchase fish that have been certified cyanide-free.<li>Do not purchase fish from a live fish restaurant unless you are certain that it has been caught without the use of cyanide.</ul></strong><p><hr><p><font size="-1"><em>Background Information:</font></em><p><strong>Importing Coral, "Live Rock," and Other Reef Species</strong><br>A number of species of coral are listed under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) Appendix II controlled trade category, which requires export permits in order to engage in international trade of these species.  The collection or exportation of coral is banned in the U.S. and many other nations with threatened coral reefs.  Unfortunately, this restriction does not apply to importing coral from other regions where coral collection is allowed (such as Indonesia or Papua New Guinea), and the reef destruction occurring in these areas can be devastating.  Furthermore, coral collected in countries where collection is illegal (such as the Philippines) is often exported and sold under the pretext of having been collected legally in a different country.<p>In addition to corals, many other reef species are sold as souvenirs or for private aquariums, including giant clams, shells, puffer fish, seahorses, starfish, sea urchins, sea fans, sponges, and "live rock" covered with tropical barnacles or other crustaceans.  Of these, only giant clams are currently protected under the CITES Appendix II.  There are some local regulations on the collection of a few of these species, but these regulations do not prevent importation into the U.S.  The collection of reef dwellers for souvenirs and for private aquariums is not only detrimental to the individual species population, but can also cause extensive damage to the entire coral reef ecosystem.<p>If coral reef habitats are to be effectively protected, it is necessary that more comprehensive regulations be placed on the trade of coral reef species.  Coral imported to the U.S. should be restricted to scientific research and public aquariums.  Trade in other reef plants and animals should be banned unless it is certain that they come from a sustainably managed program.  <p><strong>Tropical Fish and Cyanide Fishing</strong><br>Another factor having adverse effects on coral reefs is cyanide fishing for the live fish industry.  Certain live tropical fish are very popular in the Asian seafood market and others are sold around the world to individual aquarium owners.  Fishermen stun fish by squirting sodium cyanide into reef areas where the fish live.  Cyanide not only poisons the fish, but kills their coral reef habitat and the other small invertebrates living on the reef as well.  To capture fish hiding in the reef, some cyanide fishermen rip the coral reefs apart with crowbars to capture the disoriented fish, causing further reef destruction.  The most intense damage caused by cyanide fishing has taken place in the Philippines and Indonesia, the regions of the world with the greatest marine biological diversity.  While it usually takes decades for coral reefs to recover from the effects of cyanide, the fishing pressures in these regions are currently too high to allow any recovery at all.<p>For many years the live fish trade has provided an important source of income to many coral reef communities.  Because fishermen are paid substantially more for live fish than for dead ones, a complete ban on the live fish trade would be counter-productive, making it necessary for fishermen to intensify subsistence fishing and harvesting of the reefs.  Instead, measures should be taken to ensure that live reef fish are collected sustainably (by methods such as hand-nets), without the use of cyanide.  The Great Barrier Reef has managed to set up effective controls on illegal cyanide fishing, and the Philippines has recently established educational programs and set up detection facilities to monitor fish exports for traces of cyanide.<p>Although cyanide fishing is illegal throughout the Asia/Pacific region, enforcement is relatively poor.  Bribery and corruption of government officials are commonplace in the live fish trade.  Stricter laws and enforcement are needed to prevent cyanide fishing.  Although it is illegal to export fish caught with cyanide in many countries (such as the Philippines), these laws are frequently circumvented.  In order to effectively stop this practice, countries importing live fish need to become more active in discouraging trade in fish caught with cyanide.  Before importation into the United States is allowed, live fish should be certified as cyanide-free.<p><center><strong>CORAL- The Coral Reef Alliance </strong><br>64 Shattuck Square, Suite 220<br>Berkeley, CA  94704<br>Tel: (510) 848-0110 / Fax: (510) 848-3720 <br><a href="MAILTO:CORALmail@aol.com"><strong><em>CORALmail@aol.com</a></strong></em></center><p><hr width="90%"><p><center><a href="Home.html"><img src="Menu/*Homepage.GIF" border = "0"></a><a href="CORAL.html"><img src="Menu/*AboutCoral.GIF" border="0"></a><a href="Gallery.html"><img src="Menu/*Gallery.GIF" border="0"></a><a href="Member.html"><img src="Menu/*Member.GIF" border="0"></a><a href="Report.html"><img src="Menu/*DiversReport.GIF" border="0"></a><a href="Facts.html"><img src="Menu/ReefFacts.GIF" border="0"></a><a href="Volunteer.html"><img src="Menu/*Volunteer.GIF" border="0"></a></center></BODY></html>

This effort is being done in cooperation with trained staff from the Fisheries Division.  The goals of this project are: to obtain baseline data for future management of coral reef resources; to create long-term monitoring programs; and to develop a more systematic monitoring program, including procedure, for Antigua-Barbuda.  The Coral Reef Monitoring Project offers volunteer opportunities for local residents and internships.<p>EAG has been a proponent of  a National Policy on Sustainable Development that would curtail some of the poorly conceived and designed development projects in Antigua and Barbuda.  Raising public and government awareness about major development issues facing the two islands is one of EAGs objectives. <p><center><em><a href="Contents.html"> Return to the International Coral Reef NGO Directory</a></center></em></BODY></html>

Although their activities mainly focus on the Great Barrier Reef, the Australian Littoral Society is concerned with reefs located in both eastern and western Australia. Since the organization's establishment in 1965, the Australian Littoral Society has directed attention and resources to coral reef conservation.  Various development proposals for the Great Barrier Reef are monitored and critiqued (via the EIS process) by the Society to ensure that they do not compromise conservation values.  They are represented on numerous GBRMP Planning Committees and consistently advise on management zoning plans for the marine park. Besides their own active participation in GBR-related activities, the Australian Littoral Society also facilitates the participation of local groups on localized issues.<p>Public education and outreach campaigns are run by the Society and include educational project materials supplied to students (primary, secondary, tertiary) plus displays at various appropriate venues.  Media releases are also part of the organizations education strategy.<p>A database of all published information on the Great Barrier Reefs and islands is maintained and continues to be developed.<p><center><em><a href="Contents.html"> Return to the International Coral Reef NGO Directory</a></center></em></BODY></html>

Named after the rare black catbird, known locally as the Siwa-ban, the Foundation was formed in 1990 to establish a multi-habitat sanctuary off the mainland coast.  The reserve which includes part of the barrier reef, seagrasses, mangroves and caye habitats is located on Caye Caulker, a mangrove-sand caye located 20 miles northeast of Belize City.   <p>Some of the organizations activities have focused on protecting reefs from tourism-associated impacts.  For example, through a GEF-NGO small grant, The Siwa-ban Foundation has installed 39 reef mooring systems along the Belize Barrier Reef, from Caye Chapel Channel to Hol Chan Marine Reserve.  In addition, they have conducted a marine tourguide training seminar aimed at persons bringing tourists to the reef.  The 10-hour course included lectures on biodiversity, coral reef ecology, reef damage and its prevention, the use of reef mooring systems, and safety.  Sixty-seven completed the course in 1993.<p>Other projects initiated by the Foundation focus on water quality, research and education.  Their activities related to water quality issues range from working with local authorities on solid and liquid waste prevention strategies for Caye Caulker, to advocating action on the part of the Government of Belize to initiate a dialog with neighboring Mexico regarding its waste disposal problems.  Research and education projects include a partnership with University College of Belize and the preparation of a portion of  The State of Belizes Coastal Zone. <p><center><em><a href="Contents.html"> Return to the International Coral Reef NGO Directory</a></center></em></BODY></html>

Through outreach and education programs, SHIP is encouraging others to share their commitment to protection of both the wrecks and the marine environment.<p>Some educational materials produced by SHIP are targeted at divers who make up the majority of Chuuks tourists.  Other education activities include the development and expansion of Xavier High School's Marine Education Program.  The program provides practical learning experiences for students and they are encouraged to build on their traditional knowledge of ocean and examine the environment with standard scientific methods.  Clark Graham, President of SHIP, began teaching scuba diving to students at Xavier in 1991 - leading to open water certification.  Environmental education and awareness is emphasized in the scuba training and in other student instruction.  In addition, there is an on-going guest speaker program which has brought experts in many fields to conduct workshops in such areas as dangerous marine life, coral reefs and medicine, EISs and environmental protection of marine areas.  Most recently SHIP and Xavier are considering expanding their marine program to include transecting reef areas, water quality testing, and other related activities.<p>SHIP is also active in monitoring development activities (e.g. commercial fishing) and their associated impacts on Chuuks marine environment.  At public hearings and government meetings SHIP representatives advocate environmental protection and historic and cultural preservation.<p><center><em><a href="Contents.html"> Return to the International Coral Reef NGO Directory</a></center></em></BODY></html>

Educational materials include pamphets (e.g. Ten Common Hoi Ha Wan Corals),  posters and slide packs.  Magazine, About Life.  Volunteer opportunities, specifically at the Marine Studies Center.<p><strong>Organizational Information:</strong> WWF HKs first Marine Conservation project has been to ask the government for official protection of Hoi Ha Wan as Hong Kongs first marine protected area.   In 1988, WWF HK established the Hoi Ha Wan Education Sub-committee.  This committee has been working with government departments, the Marine Biological Association and diving clubs in Hong Kong to conserve and protect Hoi Ha.  Hoi Ha is home to a relatively thriving coral community, one of the last remaining in Hong Kong.<p>The process to establish  Hoi Ha Wan as a Marine Park was near completion in late 93.  As a representative on the Marine Parks and Reserves Working Group, WWF HK participated and assisted in the consultation and legislative phases of the process.  Before the passage of the legislation, WWF HK proceeded with plans for a Marine Studies Center to be located at Hoi Ha.  Completion of the center is slated for September 1995.

(62) (21) 717217.  Videos.<p><strong>Organizational Information:</strong> Korpus Kewang Haruku developed from an indigenous organization found throughout Central Molucca Island, called the Kewang or Kapala Ewang which literally means Head of Guards.  Traditionally it functioned as the executive branch of the People Customary Council in a certain village or confederation of villages.  Its primary task is to regulate and monitor the practices of customary law in daily life, including the peoples consensus to protect their natural resources.  Korpus Kewang originally existed as part of the Haruku Customary Council, but in 1978 it became a structured organization with outlined tasks and working procedures.  In response to reef destruction and poisoning of fishes by outsiders practicing destructive fishing techniques, Korpus Kewang Haruku was formally formed to strengthen their traditional power to more effectively confront the offenders.  While maintaining their primary role as customary guardians, Korpus Kewang established another foundation in 1993 called Yayasan Learissa Kayell to specifically deal with the socio-economic aspects of  fisherfolk activities in Haruku.<p>The work of Korpus Kewang Haruku is based on the notion that nature (including reefs) is an integral part of their origins and an inherent part of their present and future daily lives --  they believe that in protecting nature, they protect their origins and life.  Of importance to the group is the maintenance of their knowledge of Haruku indigenous natural resource management systems.  Many of their activities involved organizing people mainly through the Haruku Customary Council utilizing traditional media such as community gatherings, rites, ceremonies and many forms of indigenous folkarts.  In addition to their community-based activities, Korpus Kewang Haruku along with other indigenous people-based organizations in Moluccas are developing local and national campaigns.<p><center><em><a href="Contents.html">Return to the International Coral Reef NGO Directory</a></center></em></BODY></html>

The Society focused initially on the impact vis a vis anchor damage recreational and dive boats were having on the reef. To help eliminate anchor damage, the Society with the assistance of Reef Relief installed mooring buoys.   Later they broadened their focus to include public education and creation of protected areas.  The organization has generated greater public awareness about the fragility of the reef through Earth Day programs, environmental education in schools, workshops and dissemination of educational materials, including brochures on reef etiquette.  The Negril group is also involved in the maintenance of the mooring buoys, coral reef monitoring and reef restoration.<p><center><em><a href="Contents.html"> Return to the International Coral Reef NGO Directory</a></center></em></BODY></html>

A variety projects provide volunteer opportunities.  Slide presentations, workshops and classes.<p><strong>Organizational Information:</strong> The foundation Reef Care Curacao or Kuida Ref Korsou (the papiamentu name) was formed in 1992.  Reef Care relies on a pool of volunteers and supporters to assist them with enhancing public awareness, research projects and protection activities.  Programs are developed and launched by the Board of Reef Care Curacao.  At a later stage, volunteers take charge of  program coordination and logistics which allows the Board to develop new programs.<p>Among their research activities, Reef Care has a Trididemnum Project that involves surveying on an on-going basis the occurrence of the colonial tunicate, a potentially coral threatening organism.  Another survey project focuses on documenting the population and the come-back of black sea urchins, and coupling this effort with a promotional campaign to prevent destruction of the sea urchins.  Scientific monitoring of elkhorn coral is also conducted as is coral bleaching and various reef diseases.   Reef Care also has a project to stop spearfishing and regulate kanasters (fishtraps).<p>Several public awareness and education programs have been initiated by Reef Care.  One program, Kids for Corals,  gives school children instruction in snorkeling while at the same time increasing their awareness of the coral reef environment and engages the children in activities to preserve coral reefs (e.g. clean-up programs).  An underwater photo contest plus exhibition is another vehicle the organization utilizes to increase public awareness.   Other Reef Care sponsored activities include: seminars and workshops on a variety of topics (e.g. artificial beaches); a reef mooring program; and  a reef alarm phone - a central phone number where any observed damage or danger to the reef or marine life can be reported and in some cases, brought to the attention of the public.<p><center><em><a href="Contents.html"> Return to the International Coral Reef NGO Directory</a></center></em></BODY></html>

In developing a coastal zone management program for the nation, the PNG Department of Environment and Conservation (DEC) identified the Hiri East coast in Central Province, as a suitable pilot area for launching the program.  It includes four Motu villages, several fishing settlements, a small island resort and marine, and the University of Papua New Guinea's Motupore Island Research Station.  It also encompasses over 60km of the Papuan Barrier Reef and fairly extensive areas of mangroves and seagrass beds.  DECs process of developing a management plan included: a workshop for the Hiri East village councilors; a series of village consultations aimed at providing information about the benefits of coastal zone management; and a survey to collect baseline data for a biogeographic profile of the areas which the local communities and DEC used in developing the management plan.  Other activities aimed at facilitating broad based and active community involvement in the program were initiated by DEC, but since 1994 the Programme has been running under another management.<p>The goal of the Programme and the four communities that are each represented by coordinators, is to conserve the coral reefs of the Hiri Coast and develop on a sustainable basis  its marine resources (e.g., fisheries).  Participatory planning and monitoring workshops are one form of community organizing the Programme relies on to identify key issues, problems and aspirations of community members.  The development of management regimes suitable to local communities is tied closely with the coastal zone management programs education and awareness work, as is the training of rangers and formulation of ranger schemes (surveillance).<p><center><em><a href="Contents.html"> Return to the International Coral Reef NGO Directory</a></center></em></BODY></html>

The maine focus of ESCOW's environmental work has been to educate the women and the communities of their Province about the effects of logging and outside developers.  The attention ESCOW gave to community concerns has created a greater demand for more education on other important issues such as the dynamite fishing.  In 1993 ESCOW established an Educational Awareness Program to specifically meet the communities' demand for information on relevant environmental issues.  <p>The primary objective of the Program is to highlight the importance of the natural environment by educating women and others on both the negative impacts of large scale projects and on what their legal rights as resource owners are. In addition to dynamite fishing awareness work, ESCOW is also involved in mangrove crab management and supporting the use of Fish Aggregating Devices to provide easier access to fishing while decreasing fuel consumption.  ESCOW views these efforts as a first step in organizing a provincial community-based coastal resource management network.<p><center><em><a href="Contents.html"> Return to the International Coral Reef NGO Directory</a></center></em></BODY></html>

CCF-TPO encourages their CFP affiliates to include in their short and long range plans the protection and preservation of the environment.  CFPs whose member families live in coastal areas or in fishing villages, in particular have plans that include conservation of coral reefs.

In the cases of the Kasilinganan and Sto Nino Bayanihan Projects, the  majority of members are organized fisherfolks.  The activities of the CFPs are somewhat similar and include: information and advocacy campaigns; installation of artificial reefs; protection of coral reefs in fishing areas; monitoring and reporting to authorities illegal fishing techniques: and networking with NGOs with similar concerns.  The locations where Bantay Dagat Project, Sto. Nino Bayanihan Project and Kasilinganan Project are most active are the coastal barangays of Dipolog City, Siari, and Roxas respectively.   One method of dealing with illegal fishing that is being used by all three CFPs, is an organized group of sea vigilantes known as Bantay Dagat.  The aim of Bantay Dagat is to protect reefs from harmful fishing methods and report violations to the proper authorities.<p><center><em><a href="Contents.html">Return to the International Coral Reef NGO Directory</a></center></em></BODY></html>

The vision that steers their mission is sustained economic development and equity; where the people, particularly fisherfolk, are entrusted with the control, use and management of the seas and its resources. The mission of the group is to engage in sustainable development programs in coastal communities for peoples empowerment by undertaking organizing, education, capability building, research, coastal resource management, socio-economic and cooperatives development.  <p>CERDs core program, the Fishery Integrated Resource Management for Economic Development (FIRMED), is now being implemented in partnership with fisherfolk organization in selected coastal communities of Samar and Batangas.  The program encourages local initiative and self-reliance and also promotes a multi-disciplinary approach to community development.  The main components of FIRMED are:<ol><li> Coastal Community Organizing Program -- formation of structures for peoples empowerment (social, political, economic structures).<li> Sustainable Fisheries Development Program -- participatory research of the coastal resource ecosystems to serve as basis for community planning, coastal resource rehabilitation and management schemes, and development of livelihood opportunities<li> Socio-economic Development Program -- provision of credit for enterprise development<li> Human Resource Development Program -- Continuing education of development workers and community leaders to enhance their skills, knowledge, and attitudes towards sustainable development and peoples empowerment.</ol>From their experience gained from working with coastal communities and their desire to share coastal resource management techniques with Pos, NGOs and other interested institutions, CERD set up the Community-based Coastal Resource Management (CB-CRM)Training and Consultancy Program.  The Program is supported by a full-time pool of experienced staff from a variety of fields including fisheries, aquaculture, training, ecology, management and community development.  The CD-CRM Training and Consultancy Program aims to promote CB-CRM practice as well as to provide specific services requested by interested groups.  A variety of training modules are offered such as: data collection; resource mapping, pollution monitoring and control; legal tools; CB concepts and practice; public education and advocacy; and women in fisheries.<p><center><em><a href="Contents.html">Return to the International Coral Reef NGO Directory</a></center></em></BODY></html>

Since then GDFI has worked out the establishment of a marine sanctuary in Bagonbanua, a small island with seagrass and fringing coral reef, through a municipal ordinance.  The sanctuary has since been maintained and monitored by GDFI.<p>Monitoring of coral life forms in marine park designated areas and transplants of corals in areas of the park that have less coral cover are activities GDFI engages in.  Community organizing and education are strategies applied to their community-based resource management work along with providing alternative livelihood options to coastal folk.  GDFI also facilitates formation of the Protected Area Management Board, a multi-sectoral group composed of  local government, church, school, youth and women representatives, that acts as the governing body for the management of marine resources in their respective areas.<p><center><em><a href="Contents.html">Return to the International Coral Reef NGO Directory</a></center></em></BODY></html>

Reports, books, videos, and educational materials.  Trainings and internships. <p><strong>Organizational Information:</strong> The Haribon Foundation has been involved in environmental and wildlife protection and conservation in the Philippines since 1972.  Haribons vision is sustainable development for the Philippines, something which they actively work and contribute to by:<ul><li> Promoting and undertaking community-based resource management strategies at specific sites;<li> Conducting scientific and socio-economic researches on natural ecosystems to benefit communities and to promote sustainable approaches to development; and<li> Raising the national consciousness on sustainable development to promote a constituency for environmental issues and membership for the organization.</ul>Haribon believes that communities with direct access to natural resources can be their best partners towards sustainable development; therefore, they have developed a Community-based Resource Management Program (CBRMP) that encourages active participation of communities towards effective management of natural resources.  This program covers both marine and terrestrial ecosystems and has four main conservation components, namely: protected area management, marine reserve and sanctuary establishment, alternative technology training and sustainable forest management.  It uses a combination of community education, organizing, participatory research and alternative livelihood projects or cooperative development to stimulate community participation.<p>Haribons first community-based project implemented in 1988 in the island of San Salvador, Masinloc, Zambales is now a successful community-managed municipal reserve and sanctuary.  It is now serving as an example for the Marine Conservation Program for the province.  Haribons CBRMP also paved the way for other projects such as the training of aquarium fish collectors to use environment-friendly barrier nets in catching tropical fishes instead of sodium cyanide.  Over 400 tropical aquarium fish collectors/divers from Zambales, Quezon, Batangas and Palawan have undergone the barrier net training.  Another project involved reintroduction of lost species such as the giant clam and blue tang.  For the past three years, Haribon has been working together with 585 fishing families in 7 barangays in 5 municipalities in Zambales.<p>Other areas of involvement for the organization include work in the province of Batangas where a combination community and tourism-based marine sanctuary and reserve is in its early stages of implementation.  Three barangays (230 families) and 30 resort owners are cooperators in this project.  In Patnanungan, Quezon the establishment of a marine reserve for fisherfolk in the area is under consideration by the local government unit.  Six hundred families in 2 barangays in Patnanunagan, the second to last island in the Polilio group of islands, are serviced by Haribon.<p><center><em><a href="Contents.html">Return to the International Coral Reef NGO Directory</a></center></em></BODY></html>

Their work does not only focus on the reef, but on the communities involved and the ecosystem as a whole.  As a technical support NGO, Hayumas mission is to contribute to the development of community-based and sustainable aquatic resource management systems.  The management systems must meet the following criteria:<ul><li> Economically viable, e.g.,  by diversifying marine and terrestrial resource base;<li> Environmentally sound, e.g., by developing aquatic resource management zones using, among others, IUCN standards adapted to local conditions;<li> Socially just, e.g. by assisting the less fortunate to get better organized in order to ensure more equitable access to resources and support services, as well as active participation in policy and decision-making processes at various levels;<li> Culturally sensitive, e.g. by giving due respect and recognition to local cultures and indigenous knowledge systems; and<li> Holistic, e.g. by taking into account all the above principles into the planning and decision making processes.</ul>HAYUMA relies on a technical pool of staff members and volunteers, with support fromother NGOs and institutions, in assisting POs and NGOs conduct resource assessment surveys.  The surveys are the basis for developing resource management options and monitoring systems.  The results of the assessment and the suggested management options are first validated and later presented to all concerned during consultation meetings at various levels.  These are facilitated until a consensus is reached regarding management options that are acceptable to the various interested groups.  Working closely with local counterparts, HAYUMA believes that the systems that will finally evolve will be owned and maintained by these communities.  During the course of conducting the resource assessment surveys, one of the goals of HAYUMAs multi-disciplinary team is to transfer their technical skills, e.g., surveying and monitoring skills, to their counterpart teams from the community.<p><center><em><a href="Contents.html">Return to the International Coral Reef NGO Directory</a></center></em></BODY></html>

The Centers operational base was established in Manila in 1977.<p>ICLARM is an operational organization, not a granting entity.  Its program of work is aimed to resolve critical technical and socioeconomic constraints to increased production, improved resource management and equitable distribution of benefits of economically developing countries.  It pursues these objectives in the fields of aquaculture, capture fisheries management, coastal area management and information through cooperative research with institutions in developing and developed countries.  ICLARMs work is international.  The programs of ICLARM are supported by a number of governments, development banks and foundations.<p>The current objectives of ICLARMs Coral Reef Resource Systems Program have been defined as the advancement of coral reef fisheries management and resources utilization, based on improved understanding of: 1) coral reef ecosystems; 2) the characteristics of fishing communities and fishery resources; and 3) the possibilities for increases in the productivity of reef resources.  A multitude activities, some already in progress, related to each of the three main programmatic groups have been developed and prioritized.  <p>ReefBase, for example, is one project aimed at improving our understanding of coral reef ecosystems. ReefBase is the name of an ICLARM-initiated project to develop a global database on coral reefs.  Potentially, Reef Base users, through a global map on their computer screen, will be able to focus in on any country, reef system or individual reef to obtain details of reef areas, species composition, coral cover, catch rates and composition of reef fish and invertebrates, recreation and other forms of resource use, human impacts, management efforts and indigenous knowledge.  ReefBase will provide data from which it should be possible to quantify changes in reef health at national and global levels, thus providing NGOs, governments and the media with the statistics and information that are needed to implement policy changes. <p>ReefBase takes one volunteer at a time to work on aspects of the database and associated research.  The work is mostly in-house, but includes occasional field work with a Philippine researcher.  Applicants should be available for a minimum of six months.  Prior experience with coral reefs is preferred.<p><center><em><a href="Contents.html"> Return to the International Coral Reef NGO Directory</a></center></em></BODY></html>

Trainings and internships.<p><strong>Organizational Information:</strong> One of PRRMs current areas of work is the Sustainable Fisheries Development Program (SFDP).  This program is partly funded by the Asian Development Bank through the Philippine Governments Sector Project (FSP).  The resulting SFDP covers both the FSP initiated programs as well as PRRMs own initiatives.  The majority of staff involved in the project are specialists in community organizing and personnel with ecology, biology or fishery backgrounds.<p>SFDP is structured to achieve community-based coastal resource management.  The approach of PRRM in SFDP is: (a) education, community awareness; (b) alternative livelihood projects; (c) habitat enhancement and rehabilitation projects; (d) community organizing with the establishment of peoples organizations; and (c) credit assistance.<p>Obtaining a baseline set of information concerning social, economic, political and ecological is necessary for all of these projects.  Community-based environmental mapping and assessment of existing coastal resources forms the basis of the ecological information.  Coral reefs are given priority as they are one of the major habitats of the coastal area, the others being seagrass and mangroves.  Coral reefs are also one of the foci in the habitat enhancement and rehabilitation component of the SFDP.  One of the coral reef related initiatives is the artificial reef project, the work of which can be divided into three areas:<ol><li> Education:  to increase community awareness of destructive fishing methods and other forms of coral reef degradation and to address the impacts it has on the habitat and coastal community.   To clear up misconceptions about the uses and potential results of artificial reefs versus fish-aggregating devices.  To assist and train the community on site selection, artificial reef construction, maintenance, monitoring, evaluation and the subsequent planning.  General environmental awareness activities are conducted throughout the project.<p><li>  Secondary Data Review:  In order to best advise and assist fisherfolk, a review of available research and studies concerning  artificial reefs and FADs will be completed and assessed.  This will be combined with community gathered information to use for planning and other management purposes.<p><li>  Research and Project Development:  Research will concern the monitoring and evaluation of the existing projects and a subsequent review of the success of this rehabilitation technique.  Site-specific research will also be carried out to assess site suitability as project areas.  A community-base monitoring program is also targeted for the project areas. <p><center><em><a href="Contents.html"> Return to the International Coral Reef NGO Directory</a></center></em></BODY></html>

Coral reef habitat display at Aquaria Water Museum.<p><strong>Organizational Information:</strong> Aquaria Water Museum is a public aquarium in Stockholm that gives visitors a direct experience with a variety of tropical habitats, including a living coral reef.  In 1992, Aquaria Water Museum reported that they had begun research for and development of a coral breeding project.  The project focuses on the development of coral culturing for the aquarium trade and involves placing substrates in the water on which corals will grow either through sexual reproduction or fragmentation.  The two main objectives of the project are first, to create an alternative source of income, which does not contribute to an overexploitation of coral reefs, for coastal communities in the tropics.  The second goal is to increase the knowledge and awareness of coral reefs through aquariums. Indirect benefits of the project that are cited include raising consciousness among local coastal populations about coral reef protection and possibly making a coral culture a tourist attraction.  As of late '92 a site for the first pilot culture had not been decided, but the Museum was negotiating with counterparts in the Philippines and the Seychelles.<p><center><em><a href="Contents.html"> Return to the International Coral Reef NGO Directory</a></center></em></BODY></html>

Reports and trainings.<p><strong>Organizational Information:</strong> The Chumbe Island Coral Park was established in 1992 to manage the "Chumbe Reef Sanctuary", located on Chumbe Island, eight miles southwest of Zanzibar town.  The aim of the Park is to conserve Zanzibar's fringing coral reef.  Conservation efforts include coral reef management and monitoring of coral reef health, fish and invertebrate populations, and impacts affecting the reef, e.g., sedimentation and algal growth.<p>In cooperation with the Zanzibar Department of Environment and an Advisory Committee made up of representatives of government agencies, the Institute of Marine Sciences of the University of Dar es Salaam and local fishing villages, the Park has established and runs the Chumbe Island Coral Park Educational Center.  The aim of the Center which offers a combination of environmental education with entertainment and sports activities for day visitors and divers, is to give Zanzibari and mainland Tanzanian fishers, families and school children the opportunity to learn more about their coral reef and island forest.  Income generated by providing a wide array of services to the diving clientele (mainly eco-tourists) is used for providing free or low cost educational services to the Zanzibari public.  For example, Zanzibari families, groups or school children may be invited on certain days in the week for guided glass-bottom boat trips and guided snorkeling, as well as walks along the forest nature trail.  In addition to these offerings of the Center, others such as slide shows, marine related exhibits and guided day and night diving tours along marine trails are available.  The Park is interested in building relationships with local and international marine research institutions, research fellows and students, offering them an opportunity to work in the sanctuary in exchange for cooperation in the production of educational materials on the field of their studies.<p>The Park heads up a training program in snorkeling, SCUBA diving and monitoring methods with local rangers.  Rangers are also provided lectures on zoology and marine biology.  The Park coordinates with the Zanzibar Department of Environment and Fisheries and the Institute of Marine Sciences on matters such as policy development, management and research.<p><center><em><a href="Contents.html"> Return to the International Coral Reef NGO Directory</a></center></em></BODY></html>

The organization provides the government of Belize with scientific expertise and resources to assist with the development of management initiatives for the protection and sustainable use of their marine resources.  Self-financing volunteers, mainly from the UK, are involved in collecting baseline survey data under the guidance of marine scientists.  The data are used in the formation of management plans for different parts of the Belize Barrier Reef including South Water Cay Marine Reserve and Turneffe Atoll.    One of the priorities of CCC is the provision of training for Belizean nationals in order that much of the survey work currently being undertaken by CCC can be run entirely by Belizians.  CCC currently offers 24 scholarships annually which include dive training and development of marine identification and survey skills.<p>In conjunction with the Government and University College of Belize, CCC is establishing a Marine Research Center on Calabash Cay (Turneffe).  They are also helping to develop UCBs marine studies program and producing education materials for school children. CCC anticipates working in the Philippines.<p><center><em><a href="Contents.html"> Return to the International Coral Reef NGO Directory</a></center></em></BODY></html>

The goal of the projects is to provide basic information necessary to develop management plans for the sustainable use of resources and conservation of threatened habitats. <p>Frontiers only reef-related project is carried out on Mafia Island in Tanzania, in collaboration with the Zanzibar Institute of Marine Science and National Museum of Tanzania.  The majority of volunteers working on the project are divers from the UK, but local community members, such as tourism developers and fish collectors, are also involved.  Volunteer researchers are trained in situ at Frontiers research base.  Their research work which is restricted to basic surveys is based on ReefWatch methods as developed by York University.  Two main areas of research include baseline surveys of habitats to identify areas of high diversity and surveys of resource use, predominately finfish, shellfish and coral mining.  Specific projects include:<ul><li> use of sundried mudbricks as an alternative to the use of lime coral in construction;<li> evaluations of use of amateurs in marine survey work;<li> sustainable use of mangroves and mangrove crabs; and<li> current status of gastropod shell population and the shell fishery.</ul><p><center><em><a href="Contents.html"> Return to the International Coral Reef NGO Directory</a></center></em></BODY></html>

The main objectives are to:<ol><li> Increase public awareness of reef conservation issues.<li> Reduce impacts caused by trade in reef species.<li> Undertake practical reef conservation projects overseas.</ol><p>Education plays an important part in the Let Coral Reefs Live campaign, and MCS has had a wide range of articles about reefs and their conservation published in the popular press.  A "Coral Reef Visitor's Code" leaflet produced by MCS is being distributed by tour operators and displayed a dive centers overseas.  MCS has helped prepare reef conservation displays for public places such as aquariums, museums and libraries.<p>In addressing the trade of reef species, the Society has produced reports on marine curios and on conservation aspects of the tropical marine aquarium trade.  They are developing an eco-labelling scheme for aquarium fish aimed at bringing about improvements in the marine aquatic trade.  The organization is also an active advocate for tighter controls on international trade in corals and works closely with HM Customs and Excise, assisting their efforts to trace and prevent illegal imports, and will continue to campaign for better controls and more effective monitoring throughout the curio trade.<p>MCS assists UK Dependent Territories in promoting conservation and management of reefs and their resources.  For example, MCS has produced coral reef educational materials for the Turks and Caicos Islands (British West Indies) in the Caribbean.<p>For more information on the reef conservation programs of the Marine Conservation Society contact Dr. Elizabeth Wood at:  Hollybush, Chequers Lane, Eversley, Basingstoke, Hampshire, RG27 ONY, UK.

Overfishing, global climate change and coral bleaching are among the issues addressed by the Center mainly through research, long-term monitoring, education and policy development.  <p>Currently CMRC supports specific research on the effects of temperature and ultraviolet-B (UV-B) on corals.  CMRC researchers are using a new technology, the DNA Solar Dosimeter, to determine the amounts of harmful solar radiation reaching corals and other marine organisms. Long-term monitoring of coral communities related to health and bleaching is being done by CMRC.  For example, they monitor seawater temperatures at reefs in the Florida Keys, Gulf of Mexico and throughout the Caribbean region to help determine the role of temperature in coral bleaching.  In addition, the Center conducts monitoring of physical parameters (e.g., temperature, currents, weather) related to the health of coral reef ecosystems.<p>With principal facilities in Florida and the Bahamas, research sites across the wider Caribbean, and affiliated scientists at more than 20 U.S. universities, CMRC is one of the regions leading centers of field research and training in marine science.  CMRC contributes research data to U.S. government policymakers responsible for guiding the nations responses to possible environmental change.<p><center><em><a href="Contents.html">Return to the International Coral Reef NGO Directory</a></center></em></BODY></html>

The developers sought to create a lagoon  for waterfront homesites by utilizing dynamite to blast a channel through coral reef habitat and shoreline.  Expert testimony given by two oceanographers and supported by Friends of Puako Reef  focused on the inadequacy of Mauna Lani Resorts EIS and subsequently, plans for the development have been withdrawn.

High among their objectives, IMA is seeking to put an end to the use of sodium cyanide for the capture and trade in marine food and aquarium fish species.  Considerable emphasis is placed on field action where environmental principles are translated into practices that work at the village level.  For example, IMAs Netsman Training Program trains Philippino fish collectors to switch from cyanide to net use.  <p>The recent establishment of three cyanide detection test (CDT) laboratories, in cooperation with the Philippine Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources, is part of a broader campaign against destructive fishing, and is part of the National Cyanide Fishing Reform Program.  The Program conducted by IMA involves a media campaign, Netsman Training and other alternative livelihoods at the community level, and village level and school awareness programs.  In addition, IMA has launch SCORE, Status of Coral Reef Survey Project, which encourages volunteer divers (e.g., scuba divers, marine researchers, fishermen) to keep a score card of reefs they visit.  Information from the survey cards returned to IMA will be used to help government and NGOs formulate policies and programs aimed at saving the reefs.<p><center><em><a href="Contents.html">Return to the International Coral Reef NGO Directory</a></center></em></BODY></html>

Founded in 1980, Pacific Whale Foundation has conducted coral reef studies and established coral reef monitoring programs.  For example, they have provided baseline data on coral coverage, and fish density and diversity to state and federal agencies responsible for developing Marine Life Conservation Districts and Hawaiis National Marine Sanctuary.  Using SCUBA and Earthwatch volunteers, the Foundation also has conducted reef assessments.  The purpose of one specific project run by Pacific Whale Foundation, was to assess the effects of human activities and natural disturbances on unique tropical reef communities in Maui and to determine coral recovery rates.  Being a research organization the findings of the Pacific Whale Foundation are regularly published in peer reviewed journals and presented at various forums. <p>As an active participant in community-sponsored workshops that identify research needs and management objectives, the Foundation often suggests management strategies that will bring about more effective environmental protection.  Their other conservation efforts include lobbying, collaboration with management agencies in the development of marine protected areas and programs, and public education programs.  The organization has an Ocean Outreach Program that aims to bring the marine world into local classrooms.  This program includes a reef walk experience and educational snorkel cruises for school children and the general public.<p>Pacific Whale Foundations Internship Program combines the expertise of scientists and field researchers with interns who are concerned individuals with a keen interest in the marine ecosystems.   The Program provides a vehicle to gain hands-on experience in field research, a well as an opportunity to become better acquainted with marine animals in their natural environment.<p><center><em><a href="Contents.html">Return to the International Coral Reef NGO Directory</a></center></em></BODY></html>

Reports.<p><strong>Organizational Information:</strong> Sierra Club through its national Marine and Coastal committees, has been actively engaged in issues directly or indirectly related to coral reefs for over twenty years (e.g., Coastal Zone Management and the Clean Water Acts).  Over the last two years, their attention has been focused specifically on issues related to coral reefs with the formation of the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary and related efforts to protect and restore the reef there; and, most recently, with the inauguration of the ICRI by the U.S. government.  They expect their efforts devoted to coral reefs to increase in the coming years as the ICRI and other efforts are implemented.  <p>Currently the Club's coral reef work is being coordinated out of Washington DC, Florida and Hawaii.  In Washington, DC, Sierra Club tracks legislation and coordinates with other NGOs and government agencies based there.  The Florida location for Sierra Club coordinates efforts in the Florida Keys (i.e., FKNMS), Caribbean, and Texas while the Hawaii location oversees work in Hawaii and the Pacific Basin, including American Flag islands of American Samoa, Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands and Guam.  Other areas may be included in the scope of the organization through IUCN Protected Areas Program.  Among their activities, Sierra Club is presently working with ocean recreation representatives, scientists, agencies, NGOs and the federal ICRI team to implement coral reef and water quality monitoring, including volunteer monitoring.  In Hawaii, the Club is developing a network of volunteers on each major island to support volunteer monitoring.

<html><HEAD><title>The International Year of the Reef</title></HEAD><BODY background="#999999" text="#030778" link="#8850bb" vlink="#059030"><p align=center><IMG SRC="IYORlogoTM.GIF" height=140 width=200></center></p><center><font size="+5"><strong>The International Year of the Reef - 1997 </strong></center></font><br clear><p><p align=top><font size=+1> Coral reefs around the world are being threatened by factors such as over-fishing, coastal development, runoff from agriculture and logging, high-impact tourism and many other causes.  Concern about the state of the world's reefs has inspired scientists and environmental groups to accept the following challenges: </font> <p><a href="activities.html"> <IMG SRC="newearth.gif" height=100 width=100 align=left></a></p><ul><b><font size=+1><li>planning and executing major programs of public education and outreach about coral reefs and coral reef destruction<li>assessing the conditions of coral reefs worldwide<li>collaborating with governments, local communities and other reef managers to develop and implement plans for the sustainable use of irreplaceable reef resources</b></font></ul><p><strong>The International Year of the Reef (IYOR) 1997</strong> has begun a major effort of assessment, education and collaboration.  Scientists and volunteers from the worldwide diving community are involved in diagnosing the condition of representative reefs throughout the tropical seas.  Aquariums, scientists, and conservation organizations are collaborating to produce a variety of courses, video tapes, brochures and other educational materials.  Individual coral reef areas are creating or revising management plans for their coastal zones.  With the involvement and financial support of governments, foundations and individuals, all these initiatives are being put into place to insure that the world's coral reefs are preserved for the future.<p><font size=+2><i>On the Science Front:</i></font><br>Bob Ginsburg, along with colleagues from the International Society for Reef Studies (ISRS), is taking a lead role in IYOR's scientific program.  A number of scientists are currently undertaking a review and assessment of reef sites around the world in an attempt to determine the extent of damage being done.  Sites being studied include reefs in the Pacific and Indonesia, Tanzania, the El Nido/Bacuit Bay National Marine Reserve and Tourist Zone in the Philippines, the Bahamas (Abaco), Puerto Rico, and others.<p><font size=+2><i>On the Public Awareness Front:</i></font><br>The IYOR Public Awareness Committee, co-chaired by Stephen Colwell and Sue Wells, is composed of representatives from conservation organizations, scientists, aquariums and government institutions.  The committee will be responsible for developing activities promoting coral reef research, education and conservation.  A number of proposals to publicize IYOR are being initiated.  Public aquariums will sponsor a coordinated curriculum on coral reef conservation, a traveling exhibition of coral reef photography by the world's leading underwater photographers, and a poster contest for school children.  A bilingual public education and outreach program has been organized to travel around the Caribbean and Latin America.  Educational materials are being developed, including maps, manuals, instructional kits, scientific reports, a full-color calendar, and a slide show. <br><p align=center><font size=+1><b> Click here for <a href="activities.html">details on IYOR Activities</a> </p><hr align=center><p align=center>For more information about The International Year of the Reef,<br> please feel free to contact:</p><PRE>Public Awareness Committee          or          Scientific ProgramStephen Colwell                                 Robert GinsburgThe Coral Reef Alliance                         University of Miami64 Shattuck Square                              RSMASSuite 220                                       4600 Rickenbacker Cswy.Berkeley, CA  94704                             Miami, FL  33149tel: (510) 848-0110 fax: (510) 848-3720         (305) 361-4875 fax: (305) 361-4094email: IYOR1997@aol.com                         email: rginsburg@rsmas.miami.edu<p></PRE><p><b>Click here to see <a href="orgs.html">Participating Organizations</a></b><p><hr width="90%"><p><center><a href="http://www.coral.org/"><IMG SRC="Logo.GIF" height=63 width=105 no border><br><font size="+2"><strong>The Coral Reef Alliance</strong></font></a></center><p></BODY></html>

<B>Invest Wisely:</B> Important information about these mutual funds is contained in the Funds' simplified prospectus. Investors should obtain a copy from their financial advisor and read it carefully before investing. Calculations of average annual compound returns have been calculated to the date specified. The calculations included changes in unit value and reinvestment of all distributions but do not take into account sales, redemption or optional charges payable by an investor which would have reduced returns.
<P>
When purchasing mutual funds investors should be aware that:

	*<B>Explanation:</B> Investment advisory companies in Canada fall into two main categories; full service brokerages who offer access typically to a broad range of investment products such as mutual funds, stocks, bonds (including strip bonds), derivatives etc; and financial planning firms whose emphasis is more on the creation of financial planning strategies, including dealing in investment products such as mutual funds, but often also dealing in GICs, annuities, insurance, mortgages etc. Please note however that many companies - and individual advisors within companies - offer an overlapping range of services.

<HEAD><TITLE>Help on Making Queries</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" TEXT="#000000" LINK="#FF0000" ALINK="#0000FF">
<A NAME="Making Queries"></A><H1>Making Queries</H1>
Excite for Web Servers gives web users access to a sophisticated concept-based
searching engine. But even though the search engine is advanced, users
can form queries without using a complicated query language. This page
will help you to choose the queries that will give you the best
results.
<P>
<A NAME="Query Basics"></A><H2>Query Basics</H2>
A query is simply a description of an information need. Unlike Boolean
systems that search for just those documents containing <I>all</I> the
words in your query, Excite for Web Servers will search for documents that are a
best match for the words in your query. Excite for Web Servers will also search for
documents that are about the same concepts that your query describes,
so sometimes Excite for Web Servers will bring back articles that don't mention
<I>any</I> of the words in your original query.
<P>
What this means is that your query -- the description of your
information need -- can be as detailed as you like. Don't worry about
providing too many words; the more words, the better. Additional words
in your query will help Excite for Web Servers figure out what concepts you're
really interested in. On the other hand, Excite for Web Servers will do a pretty
good job of figuring out what documents are interesting to you even if
your query is vague.
<P>
For example, let's say you're searching a web site for documents about
customer support for the Widget2000 product you're using. A good
starting point would be
<P>
<PRE>
        customer support for the Widget2000
</PRE>

If you have a question about a particular feature of the Widget2000,
for example the Blurfl upgrade package, you might choose a query like
<P>
<PRE>
        customer support for the Blurfl upgrade package
        of the Widget2000
</PRE>

Even if there are no documents that are actually about the Blurfl
upgrade, Excite for Web Servers will still show you documents about Widget2000
customer support.
<P>
<A NAME="Advanced Query Tips"></A><H2>Advanced Query Tips</H2>
Here are some suggestions for getting the best results out of
Excite for Web Servers.
<p>
<b>Use More Words</b>
<br>
The easiest way to narrow your Excite for Web Servers search and the first thing
you should try is to simply use more words in your query.  The
greater the detail you provide, the better Excite for Web Servers is able to find
precisely what you're looking for.  Also try using the
Query
By Example</A> option on the search results page.
<p>
<b>Use + to Require Words</b>
<br>
 Put a <A HREF="#anchor1">plus sign (+)</A> in front of a search word and Excite for Web Servers
 will
make sure that ALL of the documents it returns contain the word.
 Example search: Travel +France.
<p>
<b>Use - to Exclude Words</b>
<br>
Put a <A HREF="#anchor2">minus sign (-)</A> in front of a search word and Excite for Web Servers
 will make sure that NONE of the documents it returns contain the word.
 Example search: Jaguar -car -automobiles.
<p>
<b>Use AND, OR, NOT, AND NOT, ( )</b>
<br>
Excite for Web Servers supports full <A HREF="#anchor3">Boolean operators</A> and syntax.  You c
an use the AND, OR, NOT, and AND NOT operators, and parentheses ( ) for grouping
.  Example search: swimming AND (man OR woman).<p>
<hr>
<p>
<A NAME="anchor1"></A><b>Using a Plus Sign (+) to Require Words</b>
<p>
<b>What it does:</b>
<br>
Excite for Web Servers will make sure that ALL of the documents it finds include
the word(s) you specify as being required.

<p>
<b>How to use it:</b>
<br>
In your search text, put a plus sign (+) in front of words that
must be in documents that Excite for Web Servers finds.  Do not put a space between
the plus sign (+) and the word.  For example, to find documents
about hockey, but only those with the term NHL in them you could
enter:
<p>
hockey +NHL
<p>
<b>What's different about it:</b>
<br>
Without the plus sign (+), Excite for Web Servers looks for documents about any
of the words in your search text.  Excite for Web Servers will rank documents
that have all of the words higher, but will also list documents
that have only some of your search words as well as documents
that may have none of your search words, but that appear to be

conceptually related.
<p>
<b>The downside:</b>
<br>
You may miss related documents that don't have the words you specify
as required.  For example, the search &quot;hockey +NHL&quot;
would not include documents that have the words National Hockey
League, but not NHL.
<p>
<hr width=50% align=center>
<p>
<A NAME="anchor2"></A><b>Using a Minus Sign (-) to Exclude Words</b>
<p>
<b>What it does:</b>
<br>
Excite for Web Servers will make sure that NONE of the documents it finds contain
any word(s) you specify to exclude.
<p>
<b>How to do it:</b>
<br>
In your search text, put a minus sign (-) in front of words that
must not be in documents that Excite for Web Servers finds. Do not put any space
between the minus sign (-) and the word. For example, if you want
to find documents about zeppelin aircraft but not the rock band
Led Zeppelin, you could enter: Zeppelin -Led<BR>
<p>
<b>What's different about it:</b>
<br>
Without the minus sign (-), Excite for Web Servers looks for documents that are
conceptually-related to all the search words you provide, rather
than looking for items to exclude from the results.
<p>
<b>The downside:</b>
<br>
It's easy to exclude too much. For example, if you were looking
for information on greyhound dogs and not the bus company, the
search &quot;greyhound -bus&quot; would exclude a document that
was all about greyhounds, but that had the sentence &quot;the
greyhound trainers arrived by bus.&quot;
<p>
<hr width=50% align=center>
<p>
<A NAME="anchor3"></A><b>Boolean Operators: AND, OR, NOT and ()</b>
<p>
<b>What they do/How to use them:</b>
<br>
<b>AND</b> - Documents found must contain all words joined by the AND
operator. Note that this is equivalent to putting a plus sign
(+) in front of the word. For example, to find documents that
have all of the words wizard, oz and movie, you could enter: wizard
AND oz AND movie
<p>
<b>OR</b> - Documents found must contain at least one of the words joined
by OR. For example, to find documents that have either the words cat
or kitten you could enter: cat OR kitten
<p>
<b>AND NOT</b> - Documents found cannot contain the word after the term AND NOT.
 Note that this is equivalent to putting a minus sign
(-) in front of the word. For example, to find documents that
have the word pets, but not the word dogs, you could enter: pets
AND NOT dogs
<p>
<b>( )</b> - Parentheses are used to group portions of Boolean queries
together. For example, to find documents that have the word fruit, and either
the word banana or the word apple in them, you could enter: fruit
AND (banana OR apple)
<p>
<b>What's different about it:</b>
<br>
Allows for excluding and requiring words, and complex combinations
of words.
<p>
<b>The downside:</b>
<br>
It's often difficult to specify exactly what you want to include
or exclude. You can also get unexpected results if you are not
careful about your use of operators and parentheses. For example,
the search bananas OR apples AND oranges is the same as the search
bananas OR (apples AND oranges). Both queries will find documents
that contain both apples and oranges, together with documents
that contain the word bananas. However, the query (bananas OR

apples) AND oranges is not the same. It will find documents containing
the word oranges and, in the same document, either bananas or
apples. Be careful out there!

<P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>
Earning money, saving money, and making money grow offer a daunting series of challenges to most of us. Yet, despite the important consequences for the rest of our well-being, its surprising how few hours many of us are willing to devote to the purpose of improving our financial health. In many cases far more time is spent deciding upon what new car to buy, or on a vacation destination than on making a well-reasoned choice of investment for an RRSP.
<P>
Even when a few spare moments are found, time often only opens the window to the recognition of how much there is to know before we ever get to the point of making a truly informed decision. Todays universe of investment alternatives is immense. For instance, consider that there are presently more than 1,100 different mutual funds registered in Canada. A decade ago, the corresponding number was fewer than 200. The past ten years has seen an explosion in the variety of opportunities were being offered to help make our money grow. 
<P>
For investors, the ever-increasing number and complexity of choices suggests that knowledge and time will forever seem to be in short supply. Thats why, for many Canadians, seeking the help of a financial professional in creating a well-conceived financial plan might prove the most important investment decision theyll ever make.    
<P>
A financial advisor has the comprehensive training, up-to-date product knowledge and years of practical investment experience to develop a personalized financial plan tailored to your needs. He or she will help you to discover an acceptable balance between risk and reward, enabling you to achieve your long range financial goals. They can even make your financial plan more tax-efficient.
<P>
Building financial independence doesnt mean taking a do-it-yourself approach. Part of "getting ahead" means knowing your own limitations. Most of us wouldnt consider installing complex electrical wiring in our homes, because we recognize the boundaries of our expertise. Making sure you conduct your financial plan properly from the very start should likewise prevent the need for costly repairs in the future.
<P>
Choose wisely. Otherwise, the freedom of choice you limit may be your own.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>
A financial advisor helps you identify your financial goals - and what holds you back from attaining those goals. He or she works with you to construct a financial plan and makes a number of recommendations. He or she then implements the elements of that financial plan and provides you with periodic reviews to assess the success of the plan and to consider any changes necessary to better meet your original - or revised - goals.
<P>
Independent financial advisors are not tied to any one mutual fund management company, insurance company or other organization which manages financial products. Therefore his or her personal compensation is based on one of the following two types or a combination of both:
<P>
<B>Commission basis:                                                                                            </B> Commissions are payable on financial products purchased through the investment advisor. Commissions can be payable by the investor, by the company which manages/sponsors the financial product (such as a mutual fund management company) or a mixture of both.
<P>
<B>Fee-only basis:                                                                                            </B> The client pays the advisor a fee based on the client's assets, income or on an hourly rate to reflect the effort in creating and updating the financial plan and in making transactions.
<P>
Your financial advisor will be pleased to discuss with you his or her compensation. Additionally, documents such as mutual fund simplified prospectuses provide detailed information on commissions and other compensation.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>
Just as with any other professional there are various ways of finding someone whose skills and experience are suitable to your needs.
<P>
Asking a friend or relative for a recommendation is a very good way of making contact with someone as is asking another professional you work with such as an accountant or a lawyer.
<P>
You should probably meet with at least three or four investment advisors before deciding on one you want to work with. Remember you will be entering into a long term relationship! 
<P>
Your selection process should be based on a variety of issues such as:
<UL>
<LI>His or her experience, qualifications and credentials.
<LI>Can the advisor supply you with references from existing clients.
<LI>Does he or she have the appropriate depth of knowledge and experience in the particular financial issues you face, such as estate planning, education planning, insurance, tax strategy.
<LI>How the advisor will keep you informed of the progress of you financial strategies, and with what frequency.
<LI>How you will pay for the advisor's services, such as fees, commissions etc.
</UL>

	For many Canadians, the most important part of their financial planning is retirement. But building an adequate retirement income can be an uphill battle - and its a battle that many Canadians are losing. Consider this: According to <A HREF="http://www.statcan.ca">Statistics Canada</A> -, a full 43% of Canadians over 65 must rely on government pensions to see them through their retirement years. They live at subsistence levels.
	<P>
	But there is a way to counterattack and achieve the comfortable financial future you deserve - a Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP). This section illustrates how an RRSP forms an important part of your financial arsenal. Review the information and illustrations here and consult with an independent investment advisor to design the strategy to win your personal retirement income war.

	If you have children, grandchildren or know of another young person you would like to help, this section will guide you in investing for the education they need.

<FONT COLOR="000066"><B>Mackenzie's Multifaceted Approach to Money Management</B></FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>
Starting with just one mutual fund and one client in 1967, Mackenzie has grown to become a major Canadian financial organization. Today Mackenzie offers one of the broadest ranges of mutual funds available in Canada. Mackenzie's approach has created three fund families characterized by different money management styles and by the asset groups they make available to Canadian investors.
</FONT>
<P>

<A HREF="IndustrialFunds.html"><IMG SRC="images/IndustrialTitle.jpg" WIDTH=252 HEIGHT=46 BORDER=0 ALT="The Industrial Group Of Funds"></A><BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1>
The team of portfolio managers for the Industrial Group of Funds uses a "Top-Down, Value" investment style. They look for out-of-favour equities and position themselves in relation to a 3-5 year horizon. Their fixed-income approach is largely based on anticipating interest rate fluctuations, and supplementing interest income by attempting 
to generate capital gains.
</FONT>
<P>

<A HREF="IvyFunds.html"><IMG SRC="images/IvyTitle.jpg" WIDTH=252 HEIGHT=46 BORDER=0 ALT="Ivy Funds"></A><BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1>
The managers for Ivy Funds, Gerald Coleman and Jerry Javasky, employ a Bottom-Up, Value and Growth style. In keeping with their approach, they always look to buy businesses, not stocks. From their perspective, analyzing the economy as a whole is less important than analyzing the financial qualities of the specific companies they choose to hold. Therefore, they always take a long-term view of investing.
</FONT>
<P>

<A HREF="UniversalFunds.html"><IMG SRC="images/UniversalTitle.jpg" WIDTH=252 HEIGHT=46 BORDER=0 ALT="The Universal Funds"></A><BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1>
The Universal Funds family has assembled a roster of global equity and fixed income offerings that stretches across all geographic regions and asset classes. The six distinguished portfolio management teams employed by Mackenzie to manage the portfolios have all built records of impressive long-term returns alongside a specialized knowledge of the markets in which they invest. 
<P>
<I>The six advisor teams are:</I>
<P>
<B>Bluewater Investment Management Inc:</B> The team at Bluewater consists of two proven Investment Managers, Bill Kanko and Dina DeGeer who have established excellent credentials in managing equity portfolios for Canadian investors from a "bottom up" perspective. Bill and Dina have a combined 25 years of experience and worked together successfully at predecessor firms.
<P>
<B>Cursitor-Eaton Asset Management:</B> Recognized as a leading practitioner of global asset allocation techniques, Cursitor-Eaton has clients among the world's most discerning investors - pension funds, government bodies and family trusts. Cursitor-Eaton's strength lies in making core asset class and country choices on a decisive basis, primarily in the world's highest quality markets: the US, Japan, UK, France, Germany and Switzerland.
<P>
<B>Henderson International:</B> Henderson was founded in 1932 as a UK and international money management company and was a forerunner in emerging market and smaller company investments. Now one of the world's leading investment firms, their investment performance records on European and technology-related portfolios have been exemplary.
<P>
<B>Mackenzie Financial Corporation:</B> Mackenzie's roots date back to 1967 with the formation of Industrial Growth Fund which hold's one of Canada's best long-term investment performance records. Other funds such as Industrial Income Fund and Ivy Canadian Fund are considered "household names". One of the reasons for Mackenzie's strong Canadian performance record has been its success in investing in resource-based and precious metals companies. The Universal Funds have drawn on Mackenzie's own strengths for managing portfolios in these asset classes.  
<P>
<B>Mackenzie Investment Management Inc:</B> "MIMI" is a subsidiary of Mackenzie Financial Corporation formed in 1984 and operates out of Boca Raton, Florida. MIMI has some very important and proven areas of expertise including US emerging growth stocks, for mutual fund portfolios on both sides of the border. Another strength is the management of funds using a conservative futures-based strategy which allows Canadian investors to enjoy the benefits of international equity and fixed-income exposure while retaining full RRSP eligibility.
<P>
<B>Thornton Management (Asia):</B> Founded in 1984, Thornton specializes in the management of Asian equity portfolios. Thornton is organized into investment teams consisting of managers with expertise at the individual country level. This is crucial, as Asia consists of many diverse economies and the social, cultural and business norms are similarly varied throughout the region.

<B>An Introduction To Mackenzie</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>
Founded in 1967 as a small, private investment advisory with one mutual fund, Mackenzie Financial Corporation has grown to become a publicly owned, multi-dimensional financial services company with more than 50 mutual funds and nearly $17 billion under administration.
<P>
Mackenzie's core business is the management of mutual funds on behalf of investors throughout North America.  In Canada, Mackenzie offers 36 mutual funds through the Industrial, Ivy and Universal fund families.  In the United States, Mackenzie Investment Management Inc. offers 17 mutual funds under the Ivy and Mackenzie names.
<P>
In addition, through M.R.S. Trust Company, Mackenzie provides trustee services to holders of registered plan investments, issues guaranteed investment certificates, and offers mortgage lending to developers and home owners. Multiple Retirement Services Inc., another Mackenzie subsidiary, offers self-directed RRSP and RRIF and a growing range of other financial products.
<P>
As a corporation, Mackenzie is dedicated to generating consistently superior long-term investment returns for its unitholders by investing wisely - and enhancing value for shareholders in the corporation.
<P>
Philosophically, Mackenzie is committed to a strong working relationship with skilled, independent financial advisors who represent the company and who work directly with Canadian and U.S. investors to establish and execute long-term personal financial plans with the aim of helping individuals build their financial independence.

<FONT COLOR="000066"><B>Mackenzie's Multifaceted Approach to Money Management</B></FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>
Starting with just one mutual fund and one client in 1967, Mackenzie has grown to become a major Canadian financial organization. Today Mackenzie offers one of the broadest ranges of mutual funds available in Canada. Mackenzie's approach has created three fund families characterized by different money management styles and by the asset groups they make available to Canadian investors.
<P>

<IMG SRC="../FundInformation/images/IndustrialTitle.jpg" WIDTH=252 HEIGHT=46 BORDER=0 ALT="The Industrial Group Of Funds"><BR>
The team of portfolio managers for the Industrial Group of Funds uses a "Top-Down, Value" investment style. They look for out-of-favour equities and position themselves in relation to a 3-5 year horizon. Their fixed-income approach is largely based on anticipating interest rate fluctuations, and supplementing interest income by attempting 
to generate capital gains.
<P>

<IMG SRC="../FundInformation/images/IvyTitle.jpg" WIDTH=252 HEIGHT=46 BORDER=0 ALT="Ivy Funds"><BR>
The managers for Ivy Funds, Gerald Coleman and Jerry Javasky, employ a Bottom-Up, Value and Growth style. In keeping with their approach, they always look to buy businesses, not stocks. From their perspective, analyzing the economy as a whole is less important than analyzing the financial qualities of the specific companies they choose to hold. Therefore, they always take a long-term view of investing.
<P>

<IMG SRC="../FundInformation/images/UniversalTitle.jpg" WIDTH=252 HEIGHT=46 BORDER=0 ALT="The Universal Funds"><BR>
The Universal Funds family has assembled a roster of global equity and fixed income offerings that stretches across all geographic regions and asset classes. The six distinguished portfolio management teams employed by Mackenzie to manage the portfolios have all built records of impressive long-term returns alongside a specialized knowledge of the markets in which they invest. 
<P>
<I>The six advisor teams are:</I>
<P>
<B>Bluewater Investment Management Inc:</B> The team at Bluewater consists of two proven Investment Managers, Bill Kanko and Dina DeGeer who have established excellent credentials in managing equity portfolios for Canadian investors from a "bottom up" perspective. Bill and Dina have a combined 25 years of experience and worked together successfully at predecessor firms.
<P>
<B>Cursitor-Eaton Asset Management:</B> Recognized as a leading practitioner of global asset allocation techniques, Cursitor-Eaton has clients among the world's most discerning investors - pension funds, government bodies and family trusts. Cursitor-Eaton's strength lies in making core asset class and country choices on a decisive basis, primarily in the world's highest quality markets: the US, Japan, UK, France, Germany and Switzerland.
<P>
<B>Henderson International:</B> Henderson was founded in 1932 as a UK and international money management company and was a forerunner in emerging market and smaller company investments. Now one of the world's leading investment firms, their investment performance records on European and technology-related portfolios have been exemplary.
<P>
<B>Mackenzie Financial Corporation:</B> Mackenzie's roots date back to 1967 with the formation of Industrial Growth Fund which hold's one of Canada's best long-term investment performance records. Other funds such as Industrial Income Fund and Ivy Canadian Fund are considered "household names". One of the reasons for Mackenzie's strong Canadian performance record has been its success in investing in resource-based and precious metals companies. The Universal Funds have drawn on Mackenzie's own strengths for managing portfolios in these asset classes.  
<P>
<B>Mackenzie Investment Management Inc:</B> "MIMI" is a subsidiary of Mackenzie Financial Corporation formed in 1984 and operates out of Boca Raton, Florida. MIMI has some very important and proven areas of expertise including US emerging growth stocks, for mutual fund portfolios on both sides of the border. Another strength is the management of funds using a conservative futures-based strategy which allows Canadian investors to enjoy the benefits of international equity and fixed-income exposure while retaining full RRSP eligibility.
<P>
<B>Thornton Management (Asia):</B> Founded in 1984, Thornton specializes in the management of Asian equity portfolios. Thornton is organized into investment teams consisting of managers with expertise at the individual country level. This is crucial, as Asia consists of many diverse economies and the social, cultural and business norms are similarly varied throughout the region.

<B>The Value of Independent Financial Advice</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>
Earning money, saving money, and making money grow offer a daunting series of challenges to most of us. Yet, despite the important consequences for the rest of our well-being, its surprising how few hours many of us are willing to devote to the purpose of improving our financial health. In many cases far more time is spent deciding upon what new car to buy, or on a vacation destination than on making a well-reasoned choice of investment for an RRSP.
<P>
Even when a few spare moments are found, time often only opens the window to the recognition of how much there is to know before we ever get to the point of making a truly informed decision. Todays universe of investment alternatives is immense. For instance, consider that there are presently more than 1,100 different mutual funds registered in Canada. A decade ago, the corresponding number was fewer than 200. The past ten years has seen an explosion in the variety of opportunities were being offered to help make our money grow. 
<P>
For investors, the ever-increasing number and complexity of choices suggests that knowledge and time will forever seem to be in short supply. Thats why, for many Canadians, seeking the help of a financial professional in creating a well-conceived financial plan might prove the most important investment decision theyll ever make.    
<P>
A financial advisor has the comprehensive training, up-to-date product knowledge and years of practical investment experience to develop a personalized financial plan tailored to your needs. He or she will help you to discover an acceptable balance between risk and reward, enabling you to achieve your long range financial goals. They can even make your financial plan more tax-efficient.
<P>
Building financial independence doesnt mean taking a do-it-yourself approach. Part of "getting ahead" means knowing your own limitations. Most of us wouldnt consider installing complex electrical wiring in our homes, because we recognize the boundaries of our expertise. Making sure you conduct your financial plan properly from the very start should likewise prevent the need for costly repairs in the future.
<P>
Choose wisely. Otherwise, the freedom of choice you limit may be your own.

<A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="../images/BackToTop.gif" BORDER=0></A>
<B>What does an independent financial advisor do?</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>
A financial advisor helps you identify your financial goals - and what holds you back from attaining those goals. He or she works with you to construct a financial plan and makes a number of recommendations. He or she then implements the elements of that financial plan and provides you with periodic reviews to assess the success of the plan and to consider any changes necessary to better meet your original - or revised - goals.
<P>
Independent financial advisors are not tied to any one mutual fund management company, insurance company or other organization which manages financial products. Therefore his or her personal compensation is based on one of the following two types or a combination of both:
<P>
<B>Commission basis:</B> Commissions are payable on financial products purchased through the investment advisor. Commissions can be payable by the investor, by the company which manages/sponsors the financial product (such as a mutual fund management company) or a mixture of both.
<P>
<B>Fee-only basis:</B> The client pays the advisor a fee based on the client's assets, income or on an hourly rate to reflect the effort in creating and updating the financial plan and in making transactions.
<P>
Your financial advisor will be pleased to discuss with you his or her compensation. Additionally, documents such as mutual fund simplified prospectuses provide detailed information on commissions and other compensation.

<B>How to select a financial advisor</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>
Just as with any other professional there are various ways of finding someone whose skills and experience are suitable to your needs.
<P>
Asking a friend or relative for a recommendation is a very good way of making contact with someone as is asking another professional you work with such as an accountant or a lawyer.
<P>
You should probably meet with at least three or four investment advisors before deciding on one you want to work with. Remember you will be entering into a long term relationship! 
<P>
Your selection process should be based on a variety of issues such as:
<UL>
<LI>His or her experience, qualifications and credentials.
<LI>Can the advisor supply you with references from existing clients.
<LI>Does he or she have the appropriate depth of knowledge and experience in the particular financial issues you face, such as estate planning, education planning, insurance, tax strategy.
<LI>How the advisor will keep you informed of the progress of you financial strategies, and with what frequency.
<LI>How you will pay for the advisor's services, such as fees, commissions etc.

As in investor, you know that diversification is a basic rule of sound investing and that each mutual
fund you own offers an element of diversification within its portfolio. Owning several mutual funds
can increase your diversification and lessen you investment risk, just like owning several different
stocks or a number of bonds from different issuers and with different maturities.
<P>

However, you may not be aware that simply loading up on the number of mutual funds in your portfolio
is not the best strategy. Better returns and lower risk is better achieved by owning an <B>optimized</B>
portfolio of a relatively small number of selected funds. 
<P>

The aim of an efficient and optimal portfolio is to provide the best mix of funds to achieve superior
investment returns while lowering volatility.
<P>

STAR is a strategic asset allocation service offered by Mackenzie and designed by <A HREF ="#Garmaise">Garmaise
Investment Technologies</A> , a Toronto-based leader in this field. STAR is designed to help
both investor and financial advisor determine the best allocation of investment dollars
among asset classes using the same techniques employed by sophisticated and successful
institutional investors.
<P>

Investment success is influenced by many factors, but research has shown that the weighting
of holdings among various asset categories accounts for <A HREF ="http://www.mackenziefinancial.com/FundInformation/Process.html#Determinants">
more than 90%of investment returns</A>.
In fact, the world's most successful pension fund managers spend more time deciding what
proportion of the portfolio will be invested over the long term in bonds, stocks, treasury
bills and other investments than on what individual securities to hold.
<P>

STAR brings to the individual mutual fund investor the expertise and technologies that these
institutional investors call upon to design their strategic asset allocation. STAR's objective
is to establish and maintain mutual fund portfolios that match an investor's specific financial
needs and objectives to build returns and reduce risk.
<P>

STAR independently assesses Mackenzie's wide range of domestic and international funds and compares
their growth and income objectives, performance records, management styles and so on. STAR then recommends
a portfolio of seven funds meeting an investor's individual risk/return criteria.
<BR><BR>

This section is an introduction to STAR, strategic asset allocation, asset optimization
and other concepts. It will explain how they work in theory, in practice and how STAR can
build peace of mind for your investments.

<A NAME = "Allocation">
<A HREF = "#TOP"><IMG SRC ="../images/BackToTop.gif" BORDER = 0></A>
<B>What is Strategic Asset Allocation?</B>
<P>

<FONT SIZE =-1>
There are two approaches to asset allocation in investing: tactical asset allocation
and strategic asset allocation. 
<P>

In a tactical asset allocation model, a portfolio manager follows market movements
and economic indicators in an attempt to move in and out of asset classes at the most
beneficial time. This is often known as "timing the market". Evidence shows that market
timing is not generally successful at producing superior results. 
<P>

Strategic asset allocation is the process of designing a portfolio which allocates
assets in a manner which, in the longer term, can maximize return through minimizing risk,
using the inherent properties of the various asset types. During the economic cycle, different
asset types experience varying investment return patterns. That is, various types of assets, for
instance Canadian large-cap stocks, US small-cap stocks, German bonds, Japanese equities and so on,
grow at different rates and at different times. Through long-term
study of these patterns, it is possible to create a portfolio that is optimized rather than just diversified.
<P>

<HR NOSHADE SIZE=1>

<A NAME = "diversification">
<A HREF = "#TOP"><IMG SRC ="../images/BackToTop.gif" BORDER = 0></A>
<B>What is the difference between diversification and portfolio optimization?</B>
<P>

<FONT SIZE =-1>
Every investor knows the benefits of diversification. It can be simply described as not putting all of one's
eggs in one basket. The nature of a mutual fund means that there is already a degree of diversification within
a fund's portfolio. Holding several funds diversifies an investor's portfolio further.
<P>

However, simply investing in many funds does not necessarily increase returns and lower risk.
Some combinations of funds work better than others. For instance, a portfolio of two Canadian equity
funds managed from a "bottom-up" investment strategy provides very little diversification. However mixing one
"bottom-up" fund with another Canadian equity fund that is managed from a "top-down" perspective can provide
diversification as these different investments may perform differently and different points in the economic cycle.
Adding a broader selection of asset types, such as foreign equities and bonds, emerging market investments,
precious metals and others provides greater diversification still.
<P>

This idea can be illustrated in these diagrams.

<P>

In an optimized portfolio, such as one of those offered by STAR, the individual characteristics
of all major asset classes have been analyzed for historic returns throughout the economic cycle
and for volatility. This research shows that correlations can be made to the performance patterns
of these assets. Some asset types are very similar in their patterns and are said to be closely
correlated. Some types move in almost opposite directions, or at opposite times and these are said
to be negatively correlated.
<P>

Through sophisticated computer modelling, an optimized balance of positively and negatively
correlated asset types can be formed. In fact several portfolios could be constructed with different
levels of inherent variability and potential for long-term growth.
<P>

This is exactly how the STAR portfolios have been constructed, offering investors a choice
of optimized portfolios, of which one will be suited to both their financial needs and appetite
for volatility. Asset optimization means that for an investor whose level of ability to accept risk
is known, the most efficient mutual fund portfolio can be created.
<P>

This is a great theory for investors, but can it be supported in practice? <A HREF ="">Optimization in Action</A>
is a compelling illustration of exactly how the STAR portfolios have delivered strong returns
while lowering risk.

<A NAME = "constructed">
<A HREF = "#TOP"><IMG SRC ="../images/BackToTop.gif" BORDER = 0></A>
<B>How is a STAR optimized portfolio constructed?</B>

<P>

<FONT SIZE =-1>
Based on the understanding of <A HREF ="#diversification">Asset Optimization</A>, the STAR optimized portfolios are designed 
to suit different individuals and their own tolerance for investment volatility.
<P>

The Efficient Frontier is a useful concept in understanding how the fourteen optimized STAR portfolios have been created.
<P>

<IMG SRC ="images/Risk.gif" ALIGN = "LEFT">


If the relationship between risk and return of all combinations of asset classes were to be graphed, it
would produce a scatter chart with a dot representing each combination. A curve marking the top edge of
this area of dots can be drawn on this chart representing, for any given level of short-term risk, the highest
expected long-term return, that is the most efficient combination of assets. Thus, this line is known as the
Efficient Frontier.
<P>


The portfolios created by STAR are designed to be located at different positions along the
Efficient Frontier. STAR offers different portfolios for registered (eg. RRSP and RRIF),
non-registered, wholly Canadian and wholly foreign portfolios.

Garmaise Investment Technologies of Toronto is the developer of the software behind STAR
and is no stranger to the world of investing. Since 1977, the company has been involved
in the development of systems to assist pension funds in Canada and around the world with
the management of large pools of investment capital. Garmaise has also acted as a consultant
in assisting institutional investors in applying computer-based investment theories
in the real world.
<P>

Most importantly however, Garmaise has developed one of the world's most advanced asset allocation
programs for individual mutual fund portfolios. Real-world application of this approach has shown
the effectiveness of the system in reducing volatility, encouraging more consistent returns,
minimizing the effect of market cycles and ultimately enhancing long-term growth.

Although STAR provides an excellent way of choosing an investment portfolio that suits both

believe the financial advisor's role in STAR is vital.

<UL>
<LI>It is important to have a financial advisor review the answers you give to the STAR questionnaire.
Your financial advisor may also be able to add other factors to your choice of portfolio - factors not
discussed by the STAR questionnaire.
<LI>He or she can guide you as to how STAR fits into your existing RRSP or other portfolios.
<LI>He or she can help you to assess how changes in your personal financial circumstances affect
the suitability of a particular STAR portfolio to your needs.
<LI>As with any other investment, your financial advisor is perfectly qualified to advise you in
the setting of your investment priorities, such as long-term growth, regular income, minimizing
of tax consequences and so on. He or she will also be there to conduct periodic reviews of your
situation and aspirations.

<FONT COLOR="000066"><B>SWP: Three Important Letters For Those Reaching Retirement</B></FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>

Income tax can often be one of the biggest burdens to bear for Canadians reaching retirement age. Without proper tax planning, a lifetime of savings can be depleted by taxation.
<P>
For those facing this reality, here are three important letters to remember: SWP. They stand for Systematic Withdrawal Plan, a special service offered by Mackenzie to actively manage your retirement savings.
<P>
Here's how it works. You simply invest a portion of your non-registered savings in one or more Mackenzie mutual funds and make withdrawals at regular intervals by redeeming units of the funds.
<P>
Under a SWP, only the capital gains portion of each withdrawal is taxable, since the rest of the withdrawal is simply the return of your invested capital. Over time, a greater portion of your withdrawal should be in the form of capital gains - only three quarters of which is taxable. The advantage over earning straight interest income is significant.
<P>
A SWP gives you complete control over your savings - you can choose to withdraw as much as you need to cover your living costs - yet give your savings access to a broad array of top performing mutual funds.
<P>
Historically, the higher long-term returns and more favourable tax treatment provided by mutual funds have allowed retirees to minimize the depletion of their savings, while providing them with a steady stream of income.

<FONT COLOR="000066"><B>A Solid Financial Plan Outlasts its Owner</B></FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>




Most investors understand the importance of a forward-looking financial plan - one that anticipates the unfolding of future events and provides for them in advance. Yet, when it comes to envisaging a future that acknowledges our own death, financial common-sense often gets pre-empted by an emotional preference for changing the subject.
<P>
Indeed, estate planning is so sensitive a topic that informed sources estimate that only one in two adult Canadians have actually gone to the trouble of making out a will. 
<P>
As investment professionals well know, a financial plan that fails to clarify how individuals want their investments handled after death is woefully inadequate. When you have been meticulous and decisive in building up investment assets during your lifetime, it seems tragic to allow the provincial government to determine how these assets will be partitioned amongst your family.
<P>
Sound estate planning is primarily about one thing: utilizing your ability to make good choices on behalf of those you care for most - particularly at a time when they will be under great emotional stress.
<P>
The essential document for achieving your estate-planning goals is a will. While it's not mandatory that your will be drawn up by a lawyer it's normally a prudent idea. Together, a well-informed financial advisor, a lawyer and an accountant can craft a careful, well-thought out document that carries 
<P>
out your instructions and bypasses the regulatory snags that can accompany estate probate. A will can avoid those hasty decisions and misunderstandings which later lead to permanent strife after your death, if there is doubt about your exact intentions.
<P>
Once you have completed a will, your next most important estate objective should be to draft a will for your spouse. By doing so, you plan for the possibility of a common disaster. Whether it is in a car accident or otherwise, you simply have to acknowledge that fate can be cruel. You should definitely decide who you would appoint as the legal guardian(s) for your children. Then choose an executor that you fully trust to carry out the structured transfer of assets if you both should perish.
<P>
Estate planning ought to be consistent with your existing legal documents. Many of us are in second marriages, or business arrangements where a legal challenge might be offered if our will disposed of assets in a manner contrary to these agreements. Naturally, your will should be regularly reviewed and updated.
<P>
Along these lines you would also be wise to create a power of attorney, to enable a trusted person to act on your behalf concerning financial matters should you become unable to do so. In addition, you may find it wise to set up a separate power of attorney to deal with health care decisions that may be required as one ages.
<P>
Again, it is a matter of making well-informed decisions before an involuntary process puts a lifetime of hard work at risk - through an inflexible and arbitrary method of settling your affairs.
<P>
It takes resolve and a certain amount of courage to think your financial plan through to the end by making a will. But the reward comes in knowing that you've given your family and those you most value every possible advantage for building their future in case you're not there to share it.

<FONT COLOR="000066"><B>Are All Equity Markets Created Equal?</B></FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>




Given the performance of the U.S. equity markets during 1995, many Canadian investors have questioned the value of diversifying into other foreign equity markets. Should they?
<P>
As soon as one investment question is answered, a new one pops up to take its place. The growing global flow of trade during the past decade has increased the prosperity of many citizens of the world - almost overnight. As more countries have embraced economic institutions that more thoroughly resemble our own, investment capital has become an experienced world traveller. Given that many foreign nations look to pattern themselves after the American model to speed up the pace of their own economic development, it is perhaps only fitting that U.S. equity markets turned in such an outstanding performance in 1995.
<P>
However, a new question has now arisen in the mind of investors. If foreign economies are to move in step with the American business cycle, is it really necessary for Canadian investors to diversify their equity holdings beyond those available in the States?
<P>
Interestingly enough, recent research is lending good, yet complex, evidence supporting the importance of greater geographic diversification for investors.
<P>
Here's what we mean. The way in which the U.S. equity market behaves in relation to other foreign equity markets has changed over time. The evidence that equity markets evolve was presented in a 1994 article by Claude Erb, Campbell Harvey and Tadas Viskanta. In measuring the performance of the G-7 equity markets against one another, from January of 1970 to December of 1993, they found that how similar another G-7 equity market would be to the U.S. equity market depends upon how closely the business cycle in that country is aligned with the American business cycle.
<P>
Equity returns in other G-7 countries, (see 1995 returns charted on back page), followed the pattern of the U.S. market most closely when both economies were in recession. Curiously, they were usually lowest when both economies were expanding at the same time. If one economy was in recession while the other was in recovery, the correlation was still low, but not as low as when both were on an economic upswing. Furthermore, the authors quickly realized that the timing of each economy's business cycle was varying over time. Therefore, the degree to which other G-7 equity markets play follow the leader with the U.S. market shifts from cycle to cycle.
<P>
They also found the Japanese equity market to be the least likely to follow the pattern of the American equity market, or any of its G-7 counterparts. Just this past summer, Jeanine Magill re-confirmed this finding in Morningstar's newsletter on U.S. mutual funds. In general, the greater a fund's stake in Japan, the greater were its diversification benefits for American investors. We trust this observation won't be lost on Canadian investors whose only foreign holdings are in American stocks.
<P>
The case of Japan may present the best answer to our original question, especially if you believe one should "buy low and sell high". In 1995, the U.S. market was up 34.5% while Japan was down slightly, at -1.8%. Japan is slowly emerging from a recession, while the North American recovery is middle-aged. By taking advantage of the fact that these two economies are in different phases of the business cycle, it simply seems to be street-smart to own a mutual fund that currently invests in Japan.
<P>
Diversification between equity markets does offset risk. But it requires a constant effort to monitor the ways in which global markets change. The Universal family of international funds, as well as STAR, have assembled a remarkable range of specialized expertise, with a tested ability to perform. They can make you feel at home in foreign equity markets, be it in the U.S., the Far East, or somewhere in between. For more information about how our diversity can play into your hands, please call your financial advisor.

<FONT COLOR="000066"><B>Looking for Growth in all the Right Places</B></FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>


According to noted Canadian-born economic thinker, John Kenneth Galbraith, there are two sorts of economists in the world: those who do not know; and those who do not know they do not know.
<P>
Such an opinion offers us an interesting anecdote, but is it really in our long-term interest, as investors, to use Galbraith's wry observation as an excuse for not looking ahead? After all, we often learn a great deal about the risks and rewards of holding an investment simply through the process of thinking through an economic forecast.
<P>
In the belief that it's better never to advise others to do something you're not prepared to do yourself, we asked our Canadian portfolio managers to give us their most informed judgements about how 1996 may unfold, in order to determine if Canada's economy would encourage our investments to thrive - or hibernate .
<P>
The primary fact of economic life, in their estimation, is that low inflation rates are likely to persist in Canada throughout 1996. The conservative monetary policies of both the Bank of Canada and The Federal Reserve Board in the United States have kept price inflation at the lowest sustained levels we have seen in thirty years.
<P>
Low inflation rates have in turn set the stage for their second economic expectation - that interest rates will remain stable and perhaps trend somewhat lower this year. As a result, the cost of financing future business ventures will be significantly decreased.
<P>
Third, they're quite confident that economic growth in Canada will maintain its steady, if unspectacular, pace. The continuation of growth is enabling corporate profits in Canada to reverse a trend of the past few years. As Bruce Little, Globe & Mail columnist, noted in a recent column, "Between 1990 and 1994, profits at Canadian companies, expressed as a percentage of gross domestic product, were the lowest since the Great Depression." The firms surviving this profit famine have emerged with stronger corporate balance sheets, and have placed a premium on the ability to create consistent productiviy gains.
<P>
Fourth, they believe that economic trends continue to favour Canada's export-oriented companies. Evidence for this view was recently touted by Trade Minister Roy MacLaren, who stated that 36.6% of Canada's GDP consisted of exported goods and services at the end of September, 1995 (on an annualized basis). This ratio of exports to GDP put us at the top of the table amongst G-7 countries. By comparison, U.S. exports made up only 11% of their GDP. Furthermore, in 1960 just 17% of Canada's GDP was made up of trade with the rest of the world.
<P>
The importance of this transformation is hard to overstate, for it shows our economy to be more adaptable and resilient than many observers believe. Most economic forecasts did not predict the long-term doubling of our exports, or that we would be exporting goods and services at three times the current rate of American businesses. The difficulty is that economic activity usually changes a step or two ahead of the statistics that mirror them.
<P>
With this fundamental change in Canada's business scene, Mackenzie' managers have been busy re-configuring their portfolio holdings over the past few years in order to reap the full benefit from this strengthening trend.
<P>
Mackenzie has consistently counselled cautious optimism in the growth of Canadian businesses. In the long run, the ownership of successful companies has outpaced all other forms of investment. And perhaps that is the only economic forecast that any investor really needs before deciding where they ought to invest for 1996 - and beyond.

<FONT COLOR="000066"><B>Supply Your RRSP Demands by Building Equity in Export Markets</B></FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>


According to a spring-time report released by Statistics Canada, many Canadian companies were placed in such dire straits by the past recession that they had to adopt a policy of "export or perish" in order to survive. 
<P>
The drive to prevent economic extinction is a powerful motivating force. Canada is today's most trade-dependent economy amongst the Group of Seven nations. Exports literally mushroomed to become 37% of Canada's gross domestic product (GDP) during 1995. That represents the loftiest level of exports since these statistics were first collected in 1926, and doubles the proportion from 1960 when exports were 17% of GDP.
<P>

	</TD>
	</TR>
	</TABLE>
	

What lesson should an RRSP investor draw from the success of our exporters? Well, consider that the TSE 300 index turned in an annual average compound rate of return of 10.7% over the past 25 years, while the Morgan Stanley World Index, which represents the weighted performance of global stock markets, averaged 13.4% over the same period of time (figures as of  June 30, 1996).
<P>
If an additional 2.7% per year over a quarter century isn't enough to tempt you abroad, think about using a little selectivity. An investment in Japanese stocks alone averaged 17.6% over these 25 years, despite being caught in the doldrums over most of this decade. Swedish stocks bettered the TSE 300 by eight full points per year at 18.7%. If you recognized that Hong Kong was about to become an economic powerhouse back in 1971, you could have rolled up average annual returns of 20.2%.    
<P>
The price of staying at home becomes even clearer once you realize that the TSE 300 represent less than 3% of the world's total equity market capitalization.
<P>
In building our roster of global equity funds, we assembled expertise that stretched across all geographical regions and asset classes, and included a full spectrum of distinct equity management styles. Each management team has both a history of impressive long-term investment returns and a specialized knowledge of the markets in which they trade.
<P>
<B>How can this wide array of choice work to your RRSP's advantage?</B>
<P>
<IMG SRC="../images/Bullet.gif" BORDER=0>First, under Revenue Canada's  foreign content rules, up to 20% of the cost value of your RRSP contributions can be invested in foreign securities. Mackenzie offers eleven equity mutual funds that merit attention in this way. As the chart shows, you can diversify your RRSP by picking one of four approaches. You can invest in the world as a whole, narrow your focus to a single economic block, concentrate upon a single country, or make use of a fund's special ability to move  across such bordersCursitor-Eaton's method.
<P>
<IMG SRC="../images/Bullet.gif" BORDER=0>Second, you can also choose a Canadian mutual fund that itself places 20% of its holdings in overseas equities. By using this two-tier strategy, you could boost your RRSP's foreign content to a maximum of 36% overall.
<P>
<IMG SRC="../images/Bullet.gif" BORDER=0>Third, you could acquire a passport to unlimited foreign participation by investing in <A HREF="/cgi-bin/MKNet/Funds/fundspub.cgi?619&10000&Dec&1994&10000&Dec&">Universal World Balanced RRSP Fund</A> or <A HREF="/cgi-bin/MKNet/Funds/fundspub.cgi?818&10000&Dec&1994&10000&Dec&">Universal World Growth RRSP Fund</A>. Both enjoy 100% RRSP eligibility, because their international equity exposure is based on holding futures. Using futures as an equivalent substitute to holding equities directly is a strategy that conforms with Canadian securities regulation, given that the fund never engages in leveraged investing.  
<P>
Mackenzie offers many investment avenues that can supply your RRSP with whichever level of equity in global markets you and your financial advisor deem most appropriate. Take a page out of the play-book for some of Canada's most successful exporters. Go where the growth is!

<FONT COLOR="000066"><B>RRSP Update: Invest Earlier. Contribute Consistently. Retire Carefree!</B></FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>



Does this sound familiar? It's March 1st, 1997, the last day to make an RRSP contribution for a 1996 tax deduction. Thousands of Canadians have searched their savings accounts and are now scrambling to contribute to an RRSP investment that may or may not be right for them. It's the most predictable event on the financial "planning" calendar. But in reality, for many of us, very little actual planning goes into this exercise. 
<P>
For some very good reasons, we think its time to encourage the last minute club to adopt a less procrastinating approach to their RRSP investment.
<P>
While timing isn't everything, the truth is that it's possible to RRSP invest at any time and the earlier you contribute for the 1996 tax year, the easier it will be to shelter more of your income from tax.
<P>
<IMG SRC="ArticleImages/Article2Graph.gif" BORDER=0 ALIGN=RIGHT>

RRSP limits for the 1996 tax year are high: a maximum of $13,500 or 18% of your 1995 earned income, minus any pension adjustments arising from contributions made by you or your employer to a company pension plan (DPSP or RPP). And predictably many Canadians will have left it too late to take full advantage of the amount they are entitled to contribute. What's worse is that this scenario is often played out year after year by the same individuals. To beat the odds we suggest two strategies that will help you to meet your long-term needs.
<P>
First, consider investing earlier in life. The younger you begin to invest in an RRSP, the more time your investment will have to compound. As the graph on this page demonstrates, the longer you allow your RRSP to grow untouched, the more you can expect to harvest in the form of investment returns when you reach your retirement years.
<P>
Second, invest earlier in the year. The accompanying bar chart illustrates the clear advantage to an investor of making RRSP contibutions at the earliest possible time, as opposed to waiting until the contribution period has almost ended. This strategy reaps progressively greater rewards with every increase in the annual average rate of return of the investment vehicle in your RRSP.
<P>
Investing earlier substantially extends your RRSP's growing season, minimizing the risks posed by short-term shifts in market direction, and gives your RRSP time to ripen to a full size. There are many strategies to consider when RRSP investing, but the most fundamentally sound decision could well be to invest both earlier in life and earlier during each annual period of RRSP-eligibility. RRSPs reduce your taxable income now, and build wealth (tax-free) for tomorrow. 
<P>
The benefits of RRSPs are obvious. But here's to more timely ways of making these tax shelters grow for you in 1996 and beyond.

<FONT COLOR="000066"><B>Investing in a Futures-Based Environment</B></FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>




What are futures? Simply put, they are risk-management tools. A futures contract places the investor who purchases or sells the contract under an obligation  to accept or deliver the underlying asset on a specified date of expiration. Futures contracts are commonly termed "derivatives" because their value is derived  from an underlying asset, such as a stock, bond or stock index.
<P>
Though the use of futures has grown enormously in the past decade, it is important to distinguish amongst the various uses for these tools. The three primary financial uses for futures are: to hedge risks, to perform as an equivalent substitute, or to speculate through leveraging. 
<P>

	</TR>
	</TABLE>
	
	
The classic example of a hedger is the farmer who enters into a futures contract as a seller of an agricultural product at a fixed future price. This will protect him against the possibility of a decline in the price for his product at harvest-time. 
<P>
Investors using futures as an equivalent substitute have made a judgement about the direction of price movements of an underlying asset, but prefer not to translate this judgement into the direct purchase of securities. Judging the trend for a stockmarket to be up, they purchase a futures contract based on that stockmarket's index. They expect the risks and rewards of owning the futures contract to parallel what would happen if they actually owned those stocks making up the composite index. The money not spent purchasing shares is set aside as collateral, pending price developments in the futures contract.
<P>
The third use occurs when a speculator purchases or sells futures without being able to either deliver the underlying asset or to hold enough collateral in the form of cash to back up the market value of the contract. In effect, this becomes just like purchasing stocks or bonds on margin. Both the risks and rewards of smaller price movements in the underlying asset are leveraged many times by using futures in this way.
<P>
Futures offer Canadian investors some important advantages. First, and foremost, a futures-based mutual fund allows Canadian investors complete access to foreign securities markets while maintaining full 100% RRSP eligibility. Second, a futures-based fund can often reduce the risk to one's RRSP holdings. Canada represents only a tiny fraction of the world's overall economy. For any investor, the prospect of exempting global markets from their RRSP could leave their portfolio insufficiently diversified, and open to adverse movements in one capital market. Risk can be further diminished by employing a disciplined professional management approach that initially determines the asset allocation of a portfolio in stocks, bonds, or cash, before going on to decide which countries should be over-weighted or under-weighted in a portfolio.
<P>
Canadian securities regulators have prohibited mutual funds from engaging in leveraged speculation, and require mutual funds to maintain collateral for all their outstanding futures positions. Funds which employ futures strategies as an equivalent substitute like the Universal World RRSP Funds often represent a prudent RRSP alternative.
<P>
For more information about the benefits of investing in a "futures-based environment" ask your financial advisor about Universal World Balanced RRSP Fund, or either of our newly launched futures-based funds: Universal World Income RRSP Fund, or Universal World Growth RRSP Fund.

<FONT COLOR="000066"><B>A Tale of Two Booms</B></FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>



Up until recently, few Canadians concerned themselves with population trends. While we all understood the term "baby boom", not too many of us considered the impact that this extraordinarily large number of people would have on the way we will live in the future.
<P>
But now newspapers quote experts on the subject frequently and the headlines are filled with speculation about the impending demise of the Canada Pension Plan if current population trends persist. What will happen to the economy - and our individual retirement plans - as this population bulge ages?
<P>
The answer may well depend on the financial behaviour of these nine million Canadians over the next decade. Here's the background. Those born between the years 1947 and 1965 are entering a new phase of the family life cycle commonly called middle age. This phase is typically characterized by a radical change in personal spending habits. Whereas people under age 40 typically borrow more than they save, people between ages 40 and 60 usually save more than they borrow.
<P>

	<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="ArticleImages/Article4Graph1.gif" BORDER=0><BR>
<FONT SIZE=2><I><B>Waiting for the Second Boom to Arrive</B></I></FONT>
	</CENTER>
	

<P>
By the year 2005, the baby boom generation will have made this demographic shift in full and the impact for investors in Canadian securities markets could be profound. For example, we could find ourselves living in a much lower interest rate environment. The reason being, fewer people will be looking to borrow money (they will have purchased their final home by this point) meaning the demand for loans will be reduced substantially. When combined with the predictable increase in individual savings rates (boomers will save to cover retirement costs), the slackening demand for credit may keep interest rates low.
<P>
It's also possible that some truly novel demographic trends may make savings grow at an accelerated pace. For example, no one can quite predict how the unprecedented growth in two income households may change what retirement will look like in the next century. In addition, by the year 2000 it is estimated that $75 billion of wealth per year will be transferred from one generation to the next in the form of inheritances in Canada*.
<P>
Where will all of these savings be invested? With the threat of a looming Canada Pension Plan crisis, the probable continuation of high tax rates and the possibility of low interest rates, the likely answer is investments will be made at unprecedented levels in RRSPs.
<P>
Statistics Canada's data show that Canadians contributed $19.2 billion to RRSPs in 1993. As large a number as that is, it represented only 20% of the $97.9 billion that we were able to invest on a tax-deductible basis, says Stats Can. In short, there is room for five times the current rate of RRSP savings. If the theory proves to be valid, what form of tax-sheltered savings will baby boomers prefer? Logic suggests that common stocks, which have proven to outperform other forms of investment over the long term, may become the RRSP investment of choice. If a greater amount of savings chased the same supply of stocks, a good argument can be made that future prices for Canadian equities should trend upward.
<P>
Whatever the eventual outcome, it's clear that baby boomers may carry the solution to their retirement challenge in their own pockets. If this generation is given the opportunity to increase its rate of savings and makes the most of its opportunity by prompting a second boom for Canadian equities over the next two decades, the looming Canada Pension Plan crisis may never come about. 
<P>
If you are a baby boomer and you're not yet investing for your retirement, maybe it's time you gave it a second thought. The future you save may be your own.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>





According to Woody Allen, eighty percent of success consists of simply showing up. Canadians often seem to make a similar assumption when it comes to their retirement. They take it for granted that they will arrive at this promised destination simply by turning sixty-five.
<P>
A recent demographic study by Monica Townson, prepared for the Canadian Advisory Council on the Status of Women, and entitled "Women's Financial Futures: Mid-Life Prospects for a Secure Retirement" offers a vivid illumination of why we should all think twice about the future condition of our RRSP at the retirement finishing-line, before letting more time slip past. 
<P>
Released in April of 1995, this background paper spells out the retirement prospects for women aged 45-54 at the time of the 1991 Census of Population. According to Townson: though surveys show that almost two-thirds of these Canadian women are satisfied with their projected retirement income, the outlook for women in this age bracket is not exactly rosy".
<P>
Townson identifies this group as a "transition generation". Previously, Canadians subscribed to a more "traditional" role for women, one in which women in their twenties and early thirties married, started a family of two or three children and then worked as fulltime homemakers until their youngest child was in school on a regular basis. The fact that mothers might well be caught short when it came to their own future was overlooked by the social arrangements of the time. Being absent from the workforce while raising their children, these women were neither part of corporate pension plans, nor were they able to draw an earned income which would allow them to contribute to an RRSP.

<FONT SIZE=2><I><B>Labour Force Participation of Women</B></I></FONT>
	</TD>
	</TR>
	</TABLE>
	
<P>
As the bar-chart illustrates, once their children became more self-sufficient and entered the school system, the labour force participation of these women increased markedly. Today, almost three-quarters of them earn their own income. The accompanying pie-chart and bar-charts at bottom right offer a snapshot of the financial assets that mid-life women had built up in 1991. It is largely by using such investments that mid-life women may hope to improve their retirement outlook.
<P>
Although on the surface the picture may look bright, Townson points out: "Most women who are members of private pension plans belong to plans where retirement benefits are related to earnings and length of service. That puts them at a disadvantage in two respects: their low earnings and their shorter length of service. While about two-thirds of employed women in this age group have an RRSP, they apparently do not contribute to their plans every year and the amount of money accumulated in these plans is unknown. Judging by the very low average annual contributions shown in the overall income tax data, it seems unlikely that women in this age group will have substantial amounts of money in RRSPs by the time they reach retirement."
<P>
Mid-life women in Canada are confronted with the unenviable task of trying to accomplish retirement goals in two decades of employment that others have four decades to achieve. For them, time is in short supply.
<P>
Townson's conclusion? "All indications are that the financial future of women in this age group will still largely be determined by government programs." In the current climate of public policy, and as confirmed in the electoral results of the past few years, Canadians have decided to "reduce the role of government and increase the role of the individual in providing for her or his own retirement." Mid-life women have a difficult journey ahead of them.
<P>
The initial step in overcoming such difficulties is for these Canadian women to realize the true dimensions of the retirement problem that they face. Monica Townson's work helps women over this threshold. Once there, women will continue to need clear and concise educational materials to help them plan effectively for a secure financial future. By making optimal use of their existing opportunities, such as maximizing their RRSP contributions, they can still gather the assets that will allow them to genuinely look forward to their own retirement.
<P>
Of course, it remains probable that the mid-life women, which the Townson study focuses on, are not alone in their state of unpreparedness. The lesson that Canadians should draw from her work is that we all need to plan more thoroughly to make our retirement savings as durable as possible, if they are to outlast the social changes that are sure to come in the future.

<FONT COLOR="000066"><B>Getting the Goods on the CPI</B></FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>



For investors everywhere, inflation represents the true economic wild card. We all know it's lurking somewhere in the deck, but we often plan our investment strategy without fully taking into account how its sudden appearance might affect our long-term performance returns.
<P>
Amongst Canadian investors and consumers alike, the most widely accepted tool for getting a reading on the prevailing inflation rate is the Consumer Price Index, or CPI.
<P>
The Consumer Price Index is generally defined by Statistics Canada as a "measure of price change obtained by comparing, through time, the cost of a basket of commodities - since the basket contains commodities of unchanging or equivalent quantity and quality, the index reflects only pure price movement." As Statistics Canada readily acknowledges, the statistical accuracy of the CPI relates to "a concept of aggregate consumer price movement, rather than to any absolute reality of consumer price change".
<P>
When considering any statistic that measures such a broad trend, it's important to remember that inflation rates vary from province to province, and city to city. What is sometimes overlooked, is that in everyday terms inflation will also vary from person to person, even in a location where the CPI has been relatively stable.
<P>
For instance, if you are a vegetarian with a special craving for lettuce and tomatoes, you could not help but notice that the price of these vegetables has increased by more than 20% when compared to their price a year before. You may also have noticed that although the CPI fell to zero for much of 1994, by far the biggest component of that favourable inflation rate was a result of a sudden drop in cigarette taxes. Most non-smokers would have the perception that the prevailing inflation rate had changed little.
<P>
For equity investors, the chart above reveals an interesting relationship between inflation rates, as measured by the CPI (U.S.), and stock prices, as reflected by the Dow Jones Industrial Average. We used American data simply because it allows us to trace the statistical relationship over a much longer period of time.
<P>
As you can see, stock prices perform poorly when the inflation rate is accelerating, (the periods enclosed in the dotted boxes), but when the inflation rate peaks, and then stabilizes at a more moderate rate of increase, the stock market does very well. In short, stock prices seem to prefer an economic environment in which inflation is low and steady.
<P>
So, should the current Consumer Price Index levels buoy your level of optimism as an equity investor? In a word - Yes! We are living in precisely that type of favourable inflation environment in which North American stocks have thrived in the past. However, be cautious in your use of this inflation indicator. Short-term swings in the CPI do not always foretell a long-term trend. If you need a second opinion on just how long long-term can be, or how to use the CPI to help position your investments, talk to your financial advisor. He or she can help you to turn the trick of earning returns that out-trump the wild card of inflation.

<FONT COLOR="000066"><B>Emerging markets: the oldest secret of all</B></FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>




Fear of the unknown lies behind some of the most powerful innovations in human endeavour.
<P>
One of the oldest fears for investors has been the prospect of foreign investing. Making overseas investments can be perplexing; whether it's a matter of access to information, unfamiliarity with the languages, worry over transaction costs, or fear that the process of currency conversion may adversely affect their future returns. Of course, the reason that international diversification keeps coming up as an investment topic is precisely because the perceived risks are often well outdistanced by the rewards.
<P>
The modern expression of this dilemma arises in the question of investing in emerging markets: extraordinary growth potential on the one hand; above average volatility on the other.
<P>
The solution to this investment paradox, oddly enough, was discovered a long time ago. It came in the form of the very first mutual fund, which was called the Foreign and Colonial Government Trust. Launched in London, England in 1868 the fund's prospectus set forth the simple objective: "to give the investor of moderate means the same advantages as the large capitalist, in diminishing the risk of investing in Foreign and Colonial Government Stocks, by spreading the investment over a number of different stocks."
<P>
This fountainhead for all mutual funds was a notable success as an investment vehicle, which spawned many others such as the Submarines Cable Trust in 1871 and the Share Investment Trust in 1872. Indeed, during the Edwardian era in England, between 1907-1913, an average of 176 million per year* was being invested abroad. By way of comparison, one estimate equates this rate of investment as probably in excess of $20 billion in present-day U.S. dollars*. Clearly, British investors had overcome their fear of foreign places.
<P>
When you pause to consider that Canada and the United States offered perhaps the most promising opportunities of the late 19th century, you gain insight into what the future may hold for countries such as Thailand, Chile, Poland and China. Such emerging markets attract capital because they are able to sustain much higher levels of economic growth than more mature markets. The key to safety is to diversify between the various emerging markets, and to acquire the best managerial expertise in selecting specific securities for your portfolio.
<P>
Mackenzie introduced Universal Far East Fund and Universal World Emerging Growth Fund after having undertaken a painstaking search to find managers who have demonstrated a superior long-term track record in directing mutual fund portfolios in emerging markets.
<P>
Thornton Management, headquartered in Hong Kong, which guides Universal Far East Fund, specializes in Asian fund management and offers outstanding local expertise and research abilities in this area of the world. Their firm originally coined the terms "Tiger" and "Little Dragons" in 1986, which have since become part of the investment vocabulary that defines the region.
<P>
For Universal World Emerging Growth Fund, Mackenzie selected portfolio specialists Henderson Administration. Founded in London in the late nineteenth century, Henderson has a long history of global investing encompassing such ground-breaking ventures as the construction of railroads that opened South America for economic development (1895-1912). Several emerging nations have consulted the firm on the formation of their capital markets, which vouches for Henderson's continuing success as a pioneering investor.
<P>
The upshot is that emerging market investing, while not for the ultra conservative, has consistently rewarded the patient investor. Creating well-diversified international portfolios is a full-time job, one in which professional management skill is at a premium. A mutual fund portfolio is therefore the form of investment that is probably best suited to prosper in such a demanding environment.
<P>
Remember to heed the lessons of history. Without the optimism and foresight of British investors in the past, Canadians may never have had the opportunity to enjoy the level of economic prosperity we have achieved in this century. By investing a portion of their savings in these growth economies today, Canadians can build wealth both for themselves and the rest of the world tomorrow.

<FONT COLOR="000066"><B>Banking on Real Estate to Meet Your Retirement Needs?</B></FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>




Buying a house is the single largest purchase most of us will ever make. It's little surprise, then, that our expectations for home ownership tend to exceed the mere need for shelter. Owning a home is supposed to be a dream come true. But is that dream in need of some re-interpretation?
<P>
In the past, home ownership has proved to be an accomodating avenue to wealth. Many individuals who purchased homes in the 1960's and 1970's have seen a substantial increase in the value of their property - enough to fund a comfortable nest egg for their retirement if they sold their home.
<P>
However, this virtuous cycle of real estate appreciation was driven by demographics and the spending habits of the baby boomers as they started families of their own. Now that the demand for housing no longer outstrips the supply of new and existing homes, can Canadian real estate history repeat itself?

	</TABLE>
	
<P>
The accompanying chart illustrates the average price of residential real estate in the three largest cities in Canada over the past decade. As you can see, location is all-important.
<P>
The average prices for residential real estate* in Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver were once all within $42,000 of one another in 1985. However, by August of 1995 a canyon-sized gap exists between Vancouver at an average price of $315,000 and Montreal at $111,000. Real estate's predictability as an asset class  starts to ring hollow.
<P>
Citizens of these three cities live in entirely divergent real estate environments. Montreal is in the midst of what could only be called the Rip Van Winkle of real estate markets. Since 1988, the Montreal housing market has been in virtual hibernation. In Toronto, the average price of a home vaulted upwards in spectacular fashion between 1985 and 1989, only to ride the roller-coaster rapidly downwards until 1993. In the meantime, Vancouver's real estate market lagged Toronto's until 1991, only to continue its rocketing ascent while Toronto's housing market plummeted back to earth.
<P>
If you're hoping that your real estate investment can replace your RRSP, either in whole or in part, the mixed message that these records of performance send are a signal for caution. Depending upon where you live in Canada, the housing market has offered every kind of outcome: sharply up, sharply up and down, or neither up nor down. 
<P>
The lesson we're probably left with is that home ownership by itself is unlikely to prove an adequate substitute for thorough RRSP planning. The level of uncertainty that is part and parcel of owning real estate in Canada has been greater than for owning other assets such as stocks, or fixed-income securities, if past performance serves as 
a guide.

<FONT COLOR="000066"><B>A Remedy for Investor Sleeplessness</B></FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>



Is thinking about your investments keeping you up at night? Small wonder. Investors are faced with having to counter-balance two conflicting objectives: the desire to maximize their expected returns for an investment, and the desire to reduce to a minimum the element of uncertainty, or risk, concerning that expected return.
<P>
The general market consensus says that it is precisely those investment choices offering the largest potential gains that are most likely to gyrate up and down like a yo-yo, thereby dooming return-hungry investors to sleeplessness.
<P>
Some interesting perspectives about how investors "react to and perceive uncertainty", as they walk the tightrope of risk and return, were convincingly outlined by Amos Tversky in an article entitled "The Psychology of Risk".
<P>
The first insight Tversky stresses is that while the traditional wisdom holds that investors do not like uncertainty, it is far more accurate to say "that the major driving force is loss aversion rather than aversion to uncertainty." In short, investors hate losing money. They rarely complain when the element of uncertainty runs rapidly in their favour by making them wealthier.
<P>
The second observation emphasizes that "the decisions that investors make are in fact dependent on their reference point...Investment alternatives are not evaluated in terms of final outcomes; they are evaluated in terms of gains and losses defined relative to the reference point." As Tversky puts it "the first $100 you win is what gives you the most pleasure per $100, and the first $100 you lose is the most painful per $100." Investors worry about their short-term gains and losses, not some far more abstract performance figure perched 10 years into the future.
<P>
Third, investors are pre-disposed to evaluating their options one at a time. When investors make a decision about one particular investment option, they often overlook the impact the addition of that asset may have on their overall portfolio. By making investment choices one at a time, they lose sight of the big picture. As Tversky sketches out, "even a series of what seem to be quite reasonable choices taken in isolation, can produce a result that is unacceptable when they are combined."
<P>
If acknowledging the causes of investor insomnia is the first step in resolving the problem, then Tversky's observations can point us in the direction of a practical remedy. 
<P>
Mackenzie's <A HREF="../FundInformation/Allocation.html">STAR Strategic Asset Allocation</A> Service was designed together with Garmaise Investment Technologies Inc. to help you overcome your state of unrest. It fully recognizes your uniqueness. That's why it asks you to assist us in discovering a more accurate profile of your tolerance for risk. It does this in a simple, yet comprehensive, questionnaire. By telling us about yourself, we can be a great deal more precise about how allergic you actually are to short-term losses in the value of your investment. Knowing this, your financial advisor can better balance your desire for maximized returns with your tolerance for risk, using the keen perceptions of behavioural reseachers such as Tversky.
<P>
Your financial advisor will then recommend to you a STAR portfolio that looks at the big picture, and optimally balances risk and return amongst all of its holdings. One of the fourteen STAR portfolios is matched to the level of volatility, or risk, that best suits your personal investment needs.
<P>
Ultimately, STAR will offer you something more than numbers alone can measure. For peace of mind does in part depend upon finding a financial product tailored to your needs and individual preferences. By keeping on the path of a long-term investment strategy, you make time your ally. And time is one of the factors that really works to effectively control risk.
<P>
For more information about STAR, or the opportunity to experience the questionnaire for yourself, please talk to your financial advisor. It just might allow you to sleep in.

<P>
A T3 is issued to:
<UL>
<IMG SRC="../images/Bullet.gif" BORDER=0>Unitholders of mutual fund trusts who hold the fund OUTSIDE a RRSP, RRIF or similar registered plan.
<P>
<IMG SRC="../images/Bullet.gif" BORDER=0>It is sent only to unitholders who have received $10 or more in taxable distributions of the fund.
<P>
<IMG SRC="../images/Bullet.gif" BORDER=0>T3s are issued and income is taxable whether distributions are received in cash or re-invested into the fund.
</UL><P>

<P>

<A NAME="trust">
<A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="../images/BackToTop.gif" BORDER=0 ALT=Back To Top"></A>
<B>Trust Year Ending</B><BR>
Calendar year in which the fund declared a distribution to be paid to its unitholders.	
<P>

<A NAME="21">
<A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="../images/BackToTop.gif" BORDER=0 ALT=Back To Top"></A>
<B>21 Capital Gains</B><BR>
Unitholder's portion of the total amount of the capital gain of the fund.
Capital gains are generated by the fund selling securities during that year.
Capital gains are taxable at three quarters of the unitholder's marginal rate.
<P>

<A NAME="23">
<A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="../images/BackToTop.gif" BORDER=0 ALT=Back To Top"></A>
<B>23 Actual Amount Dividends</B><BR>
Unitholder's portion of the total amount of the Canadian dividend.
This allows unitholders to claim the dividend tax credit. (See boxes 32, 39)
<P>

<A NAME="25">
<A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="../images/BackToTop.gif" BORDER=0 ALT=Back To Top"></A>
<B>25 Foreign Non-Business Income</B><BR>
Unitholder's portion of dividend and other income received from foreign investments. Foreign income is fully taxable at the unitholder's marginal rate. (See box 34 for information on tax withheld on this income.)
<P>

<A NAME="26">
<A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="../images/BackToTop.gif" BORDER=0 ALT=Back To Top"></A>
<B>26 Other Income</B><BR>
Unitholder's portion of the interest income received by the fund.
Interest income is fully taxable at the unitholder's marginal rate.
<P>

<A NAME="30">
<A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="../images/BackToTop.gif" BORDER=0 ALT=Back To Top"></A>
<B>30 Capital Gains Eligible For Deduction</B><BR>
Any distribution paid in 1994 prior to February 22, 1994 may have capital gains income which would be eligible for deduction. Distributions paid after this date are no longer eligible for deduction. As no Mackenzie fund paid a capital gains distribution between January 1 and February 22, 1994 this box will appear blank or as a zero on all T3 supplementaries issued. (For further information on the February 22, 1994 Federal Budget and the elimination of the life time capital gains exemption please see What are the effects of the February 1994 Capital Gains election? )
<P>

<A NAME="32">
<A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="../images/BackToTop.gif" BORDER=0 ALT=Back To Top"></A>
<B>32 Taxable Amount Of Dividends</B><BR>
The fund passes dividend income to the unitholder to avoid the fund itself paying tax. (This is advantageous to unitholders as it allows the dividend income to be taxed in accordance with each unitholder's marginal tax rate and to claim the dividend tax credit (see box 39). 
The taxable amount is calculated as follows:
<P>
<DD>Actual amount of dividends (from box 23) plus an additional 25%
<P>
This is often also referred to as the "grossed-up" amount.
<P>

<A NAME="34">
<A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="../images/BackToTop.gif" BORDER=0 ALT=Back To Top"></A>
<B>34 Foreign Non - Business Income Tax Paid</B><BR>
Represents the unitholder's portion of foreign withholding tax paid by the fund to the country of origin.
A unitholder can use this as a tax credit, since the fund allocates the income to unitholders.
Regardless of whether the foreign income was interest or dividend it is subject to withholding tax in the country of origin, usually at a tax rate of 15%.
<P>

<A NAME="39">
<A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="../images/BackToTop.gif" BORDER=0 ALT=Back To Top"></A>
<B>39 Federal Dividend Tax Credit</B><BR>
The federal dividend tax credit is calculated as follows:
<P>
<DD>gross up amount (see box 32)  x   13.33%
<P>
The federal dividend tax credit can be used to reduce the unitholder's taxable income.
<P>

<A NAME="12">
<A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="../images/BackToTop.gif" BORDER=0 ALT=Back To Top"></A>
<B>12 Social Insurance Number</B><BR>

	Universal World Balanced RRSP Fund turned in moderate growth this quarter, with much of the strength coming in September.  Both stocks and bonds performed well, but we see better growth prospects for equities and will continue to emphasise stocks for the future.<BR>Global Fixed Income Commentary:<BR>In a surprise move, "The Fed" did not raise rates, and the U.S. bond market responded positively.  So long as political problems in Canada remain subdued we expect bond markets in Canada to outperform bond markets in the U.S.  We see little evidence that U.S. rates will rise significantly in the months ahead.  <BR>In Europe, governments are moving closer to reaching their fiscal and monetary targets in order to comply with European Monetary Union requirements, and a strong focus on deficit reduction is improving the environment for core European bond markets.  Investments in emerging market bonds are strong, with countries like Mexico, Argentina and Brazil showing better than expected economic strength since the peso crisis of 1994.<BR>We see continued health in both US high-yield and US dollar denominated emerging market bonds, but are also sensitive to the frothiness starting to develop in these markets.   We will carefully scrutinize and evaluate any future investments in these areas. <BR>Global Equity Commentary:<BR>In Europe, our focus remains on countries like France, Austria, and the Netherlands.  The Fund has been consistently underweight Japan, and despite that market's poor performance lately, we feel stock valuations are still too rich, and there is still more room for the Yen to fall.  <BR>We prefer to direct our Far East investments to the higher growth nations of Hong Kong, Singapore, and Malaysia.  The Hong Kong market appears to be overcoming the worries surrounding the hand over in 1997.  With support from the Chinese, reasonable valuations and strong momentum, we believe that the Hong Kong market could soon surpass its former high.<BR>We have underweighted the U.S. because of  concern about slower earnings growth.  America has benefitted from corporate restructuring, but will now need top line growth to drive earnings, and we expect US investors will be disappointed.   There may be better opportunities in Europe, Latin America and Asia, where we expect improved corporate profitability to drive these markets higher.<BR>Sept 30, 96.

	Invest Wisely: Important information about this mutual fund is contained in the Funds simplified prospectus. Investors should obtain a copy from their financial advisor and read it carefully before investing. Calculations of average annual compound returns have been calculated to the date specified. The calculations included changes in unit value and reinvestment of all distributions but do not take into account sales, redemption or optional charges payable by an investor which would have reduced returns.
When purchasing mutual funds investors should be aware that:
mutual fund investments are not guaranteed
unit values and investment returns will fluctuate over time; and
past performance does not assure similar future returns.

	The recent strength of the US market has been fueled by strong corporate profits, boosted by companies that have vigorously cut costs and restructured.  We believe this process is now mature, and that disappointments in the broad US market could create a favourable environment for stocks in countries that have lagged over the past few years.<BR>Universal World Growth RRSP Fund, with the largest portion of its assets in Europe, is highly sensitive to the prospects for European Monetary Union, scheduled for January, 1999.  European government leaders are focusing their attention to budget deficits and cutting fiscal spending to meet Maastricht criteria, but we feel this is the wrong approach.  By cutting government spending in a low-growth environment, the economy slows even further, which leads to lower tax collection and reduced government revenues, thus putting more pressure on the fiscal deficit.  The better way to effectively reduce government budget deficits is to encourage growth through lower interest rates, which will spur economic activity and enhance competitiveness through lower exchange rates.   If central bankers in Europe take a more rational view toward inflation, and lower interest rates, it could be a boon to stock markets across the entire European continent.<BR>Asia continues to be well represented in the portfolio with the largest exposure in Hong Kong.  Despite that market's excellent performance this year, it remains the best value in the region. We feel that concerns over Hong Kong's transition from British to Chinese control are overblown, and with Hong Kong on the doorstep of China, the colony stands to gain sgnificantly from what is arguably the world's fastest growing region.  Investors in mainland China today are paying a premium of about 70 times earnings for "A" Shares, but "H" shares of the same companies (which are open to foreign investors) trade at around 12 times earnings.  Obviously the potential for investment growth is excellent.<BR>Nov 30, 96.

	Invest Wisely: Important information about this mutual fund is contained in the Funds simplified prospectus. Investors should obtain a copy from their financial advisor and read it carefully before investing. Calculations of average annual compound returns have been calculated to the date specified. The calculations included changes in unit value and reinvestment of all distributions but do not take into account sales, redemption or optional charges payable by an investor which would have reduced returns.
When purchasing mutual funds investors should be aware that:
mutual fund investments are not guaranteed
unit values and investment returns will fluctuate over time; and
past performance does not assure similar future returns.

As an investor, you're unique. Your financial, current financial situation,
and investment experiences and attitudes all contribute to your individual Investor Profile.
<BR><BR>

Your answers to this questionnaire will enable us to understand your personal investment
preferences and circumstances in order to recommend a portfolio of mutual funds most
suitable to your needs. 
<BR><BR>

While a number of questions may seem indirect, the questionnaire has been designed
to elicit valid, usable responses. Please complete each section in full.

<B>YOUR FINANCIAL GOALS FOR THIS INVESTMENT</B>
</FONT>
</CENTER>

<BR><BR>


1. What is the major goal of your investment? Please choose the most important one.
<BR><BR>

<INPUT TYPE = "radio" NAME ="question5" VALUE = "4">
I expect to use these funds for a large purchase or expense within five years.
<BR><BR>

<INPUT TYPE = "radio" NAME ="question5" VALUE = "6">
I want to be certain that my capital is secure and that I have regular income now.
<BR><BR>

<BR><BR>

2. Your personal time horizon is an important part of your financial strategy.
If you plan to invest for less than two years, you may experience a declining
part of a market cycle without having the opportunity to take advantage of longer-term
trends. A short-term bond or money market fund may better protect such short-term savings.

12. We would like you to think about the possible outcomes of investment opportunities.
The following two ventures each has a different "most likely" return, the first of 15%,
the second of 20%. But as with most investment opportunities, there are also other possible
outcomes, including a large loss (50% of investment) or a large gain (also 50% of the investment).
Please compare the following two investment opportunities.

<B>The Registered Retirement Income Fund (RRIF)</B>
<P>
The RRIF is the most popular option for accessing RRSP savings to provide income during retirement. A RRIF offers complete income flexibility while allowing your savings to remain tax-sheltered and under your personal control.
<P>
A RRIF will:
<UL>
<LI>Let you determine the amount of your withdrawals, so you can provide the income that best meets your needs.<BR>
<LI>Maximize the value of your retirement savings by keeping them tax-sheltered until withdrawn as income.<BR>
<LI>Allow you to continue investing based on your individual needs, so you can soundly diversify your savings, and<BR>
<LI>Ensure that any remaining savings will go to your beneficiary or estate if you should die before you withdraw all of your savings.<BR>
</UL><P>

<A NAME="2">
<A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="../images/BackToTop.gif" BORDER=0></A>
<B>Continued Tax-Sheltering and Flexible Income: How a RRIF Works</B>
<P>
You may establish a RRIF any time before the end of the year in which you turn 69 by transferring some or all of your savings directly from an RRSP, which can include funds from a company pension plan (provided they are not "locked-in") or a deferred profit sharing plan.
<P>
No tax is payable when transferring your RRSP savings directly into a RRIF.  All interest, dividends and capital gains generated by the savings in your RRIF continue to accumulate tax-free.  Only your withdrawals are taxable.  The ability to keep these savings tax-sheltered is a very valuable benefit because it maximizes the funds available for your to withdraw as income during your retirement years.
<P>
You must withdraw at least the minimum amount from a RRIF every year starting in the year in which you turn 69 years old. This amount is typically calculated based on the value of the RRIF at the end of the previous calendar year. A different percentage is used dependent on your age in any particular year. The percentages are as follows:

Under current pension law, locked-in RRSP or pension plan savings cannot be paid out to you in a lump-sum.  (Locked-in RRSPs contain vested pension benefits that were transferred-in from a company pension plan upon termination of employment, and must be confused with deposit-type investments such as GICs which may be held inside an RRSP and temporarily lock-in your savings for the term you select).  Until recently, these funds could only be used to purchase a life annuity upon retirement.  Not only did this force retirees to give up control of their money, it also forced those who needed income immediately upon retirement to accept whatever annuity rates were available at the time.  Happily, this situation is changing due to the introduction of the Life Income Fund, a special type of RRIF now available in several provinces.

<B>The Life Income Fund (LIF)</B>
<P>
The Life Income Fund (LIF) was created specifically for accessing locked-in RRSP and pension plan savings to provide retirement income.  With a LIF, if interest rates are low upon retirement, you can delay the purchase of a life annuity until rates improve but begin making withdrawals immediately - and keep control of your savings.  
<P>
A LIF provides the same valuable tax-sheltering as a RRIF.  To satisfy provincial pension regulations, however, two additional rules regarding how income can be taken out apply:

<UL>
<LI>In addition to the minimum annual withdrawal, a LIF also has a maximum annual withdrawal. This ensures that funds will be available to purchase a life annuity by age 80. For example, at age 65 the maximum for 1993 is about 9% of your LIF's value. At age 79, the maximum is about 13%, and	<BR>
<LI>All assets in a LIF must be used to purchase a life annuity by the end of the year in which you turn 80.

<B>Why a RRIF and LIF are so Advantageous</B>
<P>
A RRIF gives you full control over your savings - from income flexibility to investment selection and estate planning.  Much of that same control has also been built into the LIF.  The main advantages that make the RRIF and now the LIF a better choice than a life annuity for many retirees are summarized in the following table:

Your investment advisor can help you set realistic personal financial targets. But remember: based on historical evidence, chances are government and/or corporate pension plans alone just won't do the job.

<FONT COLOR="000066"><B>The Importance Of Diversification</B></FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>
Diversification is often defined as having the foresight as an investor not to put all your eggs in one basket. The key idea is to reduce the possibility of a substantial loss of capital by spreading risk across different types of investment.
<P>
In practice, there are four major ways to achieve a diversified investment portfolio.
<P>
<IMG SRC="../images/Bullet.gif" BORDER=0>
First, there is the ability to diversify between asset classes: stocks, bonds, cash, and precious metals. Results of studies carried out by U.S. pension fund analysts suggest that approximately 90% of long-term investment results may depend upon the allocation between asset groups in your portfolio. 
<P>
<IMG SRC="../images/Bullet.gif" BORDER=0>
Second, you can diversify your investments geographically. The Canadian market represents less than 3% of the worlds entire equity market capitalization. Investment exposure to overseas markets allow you to take advantage of economic cycles that move in a different rhythm to that of North America. The faster-growing emerging economies of the Far East, Latin America and the "new" Europe offer rewards for capital investment that the more mature markets simply are unable to provide.
<P>
<IMG SRC="../images/Bullet.gif" BORDER=0>
Third, you may spread your investment risks by owning several currencies. This type of diversification becomes especially important if you plan to retire outside Canada, or if foreign travel makes up a large part of your lifestyle. Owning a basket of currencies can offset long-term erosion in the buying power of the Canadian dollar.
<P>
<IMG SRC="../images/Bullet.gif" BORDER=0>
Fourth, many professionals advise that you diversify by portfolio management style. Whether it is a value, growth, sector-rotator, or blend of any of these three broad styles, in selecting mutual funds it is usually wiser to own more than one. Certain investment styles have often proven to wear better during some stock market cycles than others. Assembling an assortment of styles can help prevent your investment returns from going completely out of fashion.
<P>
By diversifying in all four directions at once, an investor can go a long way towards making their overall investment strategy more durable. Mutual funds offer levels of diversification that very few individual investors could hope to match.

<FONT COLOR="000066"><B>How to Get There</B></FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>


The road to financial independence is marked with signposts to help you determine if your investments are headed in the right direction. But these markers only make sense in light of the investment goals you have set out for yourself.
<P>
How can you start to plan your journey? While many of us would like to believe that we have the ability to invest successfully on a do-it-yourself basis, the existing track record suggests that a certain set of skills and prior experience is mandatory.
<P>
It has been shown that the return of a mutual fund investment in the long run is far more dependent on investor behaviour than the actual performance of the fund itself. A U.S. study, conducted by Dalbar, shows that over the decade from January 1984 to September 1993, the average investor in U.S. equity funds who sought professional financial advice managed a cumulative return of 90.2%, while those investors who relied upon their own advice only received a return of 70.2%.
<P>
Self-discipline in developing and carrying out a financial plan is easier to achieve in theory than in practice.
<P>
To begin with, you need to get your bearings about where your finances stand today. Could you create a net income statement for yourself? Do you know all your financial assets and liabilities? Becoming more knowledgeable about your finances lets you make realistic assumptions about how much you can invest on a yearly basis. It also establishes the good habit of planning in advance for your expenses.
<P>
Second, you need to precisely define your personal financial needs and future goals.
<P>
At the same time, you would want to securely establish your tolerance for risk.
<P>
Third, as a Canadian tax-payer it is vital to take advantage of RRSPs and RRIFs in order to defer income taxes, and allow your retirement savings to grow on a tax-sheltered basis.
<P>
Lastly, a self-reliant investor must be prepared to make substantial time available for learning about the bewildering array of investment options open to them if they are to make wise choices in the long run.
<P>
Given these guidelines for building a successful financial plan, and the constant pressure to broaden and educate oneself about new investment alternatives, it=s small wonder that many people turn to an independent financial advisor.

<FONT COLOR="000066"><B>Mutual Funds: A Superior Alternative</B></FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>
Mutual funds were created to meet a genuine need. A mutual fund pools together the savings of many investors in a straightforward way that offers clear benefits for all concerned as they seek to make their own money grow. 
<P>
The following advantages offer compelling evidence that there really is strength in numbers: 
<P>
<IMG SRC="../images/Bullet.gif" BORDER=0>
<B>Full-time professional money management:</B> You gain access to a set of specialized skills that can build better long-term performance returns on your behalf than you could achieve on your own.
<P>
<IMG SRC="../images/Bullet.gif" BORDER=0>
<B>Diversification:</B> Mutual funds can protect you against many types of investment risk, by spreading your holdings across asset classes, geographic region, and currency. 
<P>
<IMG SRC="../images/Bullet.gif" BORDER=0>
<B>Liquidity:</B> You may buy or sell mutual fund shares dailyso long as it is a regular trading day for the major securities exchanges in Canada. 
<P>
<IMG SRC="../images/Bullet.gif" BORDER=0>
<B>Administrative convenience:</B> Relevant paperwork and record-keeping is handled for you by the fund management company.
<P>
<IMG SRC="../images/Bullet.gif" BORDER=0>
<B>Safety:</B> Mutual fund investors have three built-in safeguards, their money is kept separate from the management company, each funds investment assets are held by a custodian (a large Canadian bank or trust company), and in the remote event of fraud by a mutual fund company a contingency fund has been established in several provinces to compensate individual investorssuch funds have never yet needed to be used.
<P>
In addition, mutual funds allow Canadian investors access to some very exotic capital markets. The markets of the Far East and other emerging economies present certain difficulties of language and unfamiliar securities practices that can present formidable obstacles to individuals seeking to invest all on their own.
<P>
As a financial product, mutual funds offer well-crafted solutions to many of the most pressing demands in todays investment marketplace. Their ability to meet a persistent need makes it easy to understand why mutual funds have become so popular during the past decade and an investment choice used by more than 30% of Canadians.
<P>
</FONT>

<FONT COLOR="000066"><B>Making the right choice:</B></FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>
Choosing the right type of mutual fund portfolio, suited specifically to your needs, requires careful deliberation. Investing before you have developed a financial plan, 
is a lot like trying to build a house without a blueprint. You may wind up with something so at odds with what you originally hoped for from your investments that youre forced back to the drawing board whether you like it or not.
<P>
As a rule, it pays to plan ahead. 
<P>
However, in drawing the broad outlines for an effective strategy be sure that youve left enough room to create a balance between risk and reward. Many investors prove too cautious in their approach. While its natural to fear a loss of capital in the near-term, the more profound risk is one of failing to meet your objectives in the long run.
<P>
In short, this means investing in the innovative business ideas that drive growth in the economyequity ownership. Only equities, as an asset class, have a track record of being able to grow your savings in a way that significantly outpaces the effects of inflation and taxation over time.

<P>


<FONT SIZE=2>
A Personal and tax-effective way to save for your children's future.
<P>
Establishing an individual Registered Education Savings Plan (RESP) and setting up a pre-authorized chequing plan to automatically make your contributions will ensure you have funds available for a very special purpose - helping to pay for the post-secondary schooling your children- or grandchildren - will need to pursue successful careers in their chosen fields.
<P>
An RESP provides two valuable tax benefits which maximize the funds available to pay for your children's post-secondary schooling.
<P>
By allowing you to systematically invest manageable amounts on a regular basis, the pre-authorized chequing plan is the most convenient way to build up savings for any purpose. By combining the advantages of a regular investment plan with the valuable tax benefits of an individual RESP, saving for your children's future becomes even easier.
<P>
An individual RESP will:
<P>
<UL>
<IMG SRC="../images/Bullet.gif">Allow you to build up your savings more rapidly by keeping your contributions tax-sheltered until withdrawn.
<P>
<IMG SRC="../images/Bullet.gif">Reduce you future taxes by allowing you to shift the income generated by your contributions to your children when withdrawn.
<P>
<IMG SRC="../images/Bullet.gif">Enable you to invest your savings based on your individual needs so you can achieve the right balance between long-term growth and preservation of capital.

<FONT COLOR="000066"><B>Tax-sheltered growth plus a lower tax rate: How an RESP works</B></FONT>
<P>



<FONT SIZE=2>
An RESP provides two significant tax benefits which non-registered accounts lack.
<P>
First, all interest, dividends and capital gains generated by your investment are allowed to accumulate tax-free, resulting in faster growth. Second, when the growth portion is withdrawn, it is taxed in the students hand and at his or her tax rate - not yours. Since most students have much lower incomes than their parents, this "income-splitting" technique should result in significant tax savings and helps maximize the funds available to pay for post secondary schooling.
<P>
RESP growth can only be withdrawn to pay for post-secondary expenses of the student(s) named as beneficiaries under the plan. However, the contributions made, which are not tax-deductible, may be withdrawn tax-free at any time.
<P>
Maximum annual contributions of $1,500 per year can be made for up to 21 years, for a cumulative maximum of $31,500. All funds in the plan must be withdrawn before the end of the plan's 25th year.

<FONT COLOR="000066"><B>Individual vs. Pooled RESPs: A closer look</B></FONT>
<P>


<FONT SIZE=2>
There are two types of RESP available to investors.
<P>
<B>Individual RESPs</B> give you significantly greater control and flexibility than pooled RESPs in a number of key areas. 
<P>
Individual RESPs, such as the one offered by Mackenzie, are generally considered superior because they give you significantly greater control and flexibility in areas such as investment selection, naming beneficiaries and making contributions and withdrawals.
<P>
<B>Pooled RESPs</B>, do not allow you to decide on how our savings are invested. They also involve various restrictions - which vary from plan to plan - which significantly increase the chance that growth earned will be forfeited and divided among the other children in the pool. Such restrictions can included: having to name beneficiaries under a given age (usually 13) and not being able to interrupt your contribution schedule or access you accumulated contributions. There can even be restrictions regarding how education payments must be received and on academic standards at the post-graduate level.
<P>
Individual RESPs are not subject to such constraints. The only way the growth portion of your plan can be forfeited is if your child does not go on to study at the post-secondary level.

<FONT COLOR="000066"><B>Why RRSPs are a must</B></FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>
An RRSP is the most significant financial opportunity available to Canadians. 
<P>
While RRSPs are often sold simply on their ability to generate income tax refunds, their real benefit is one of building superior investment returns. That's because RRSP investments grow tax-free until they are withdrawn.
<P>
The power of long-term, tax-deferred investing can be substantial. To illustrate, under current tax rules, if you choose to invest without the use of an RRSP, you must do so in <A HREF="http://www.mackenziefinancial.com/FinancialPlanning/RRSP.html#After">after-tax dollars</A>. What's more, the interest, capital gains, and dividends earned by your unsheltered investment are also subject to income tax. In 1995, you paid at least 40% in provincial and federal income taxes on taxable income above $30,000. In other words, on your last $1,000 of gross income earned, you retained just $600 after taxes. An RRSP is the most significant financial opportunity available to Canadians. While RRSPs are often sold simply on their ability to generate income tax refunds, their real benefit is one of building superior investment returns. That's because RRSP investments grow tax-free until they are withdrawn.
<P>
If each year, for 30 years, you place that $600 in an unsheltered investment which (hypothetically) earns 10% per annum, your after tax yield would be 6%. The result is that your retirement nest egg would only have an after tax value of $47,435. Using the same scenario, a Canadian in the 40% tax bracket could shelter the entire $1,000 in gross income from tax, and invest it inside an RRSP earning an assumed rate of 10%. By doing so every year for 30 years, the RRSP grows to a pre-tax level of $164,494. Incredibly, you could have saved more than three times as much simply by using an RRSP to protect income from tax. The difference between sheltered and unsheltered investing is that important.

	</TD>
	<TD><FONT SIZE=2>
	When you invest or spend some of your earned income, that money can be referred to as "after-tax dollars." This is because you are using money on which you have already paid tax. For instance, lets say you wished to buy a $450 TV set and your marginal tax rate was 40%. The TV will cost you $450 in after-tax dollars. However to make $450 after tax, you have to earn $750 pre-tax dollars, as you only get to keep 60% of your income after taxes and 60% of $750 is $450.

	</TD>
	<TD><FONT SIZE=2>
	Your marginal tax rate is the tax payable on your last dollar of income. All Canadians can earn a small amount per year free of federal and provincial income taxes. There is then a rising scale of tax rates applied to your income. The more you earn, the greater proportion of your income you must pay in tax. That last dollar attracts your highest tax rate.

<FONT COLOR="000066"><B>How an independent financial advisor can help</B></FONT>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=-1>
Although RRSPs, RRIFs and LIFs all offer benefits, how well they work for you will be determined by the quality of the advice you receive, both when you set the plan up and in the future. Therefore, it is vital to get sound advice on all aspects of managing your retirement savings. The source of this advice for hundreds of thousands of Canadians is an independent financial advisor representing a mutual fund dealer, investment brokerage or financial planning firm.
<P>
A close long-term relationship with a qualified advisor will ensure your savings are arranged to satisfy your present and future needs as best as possible.
<P>
<I>Services an independent advisor can provide include:</I>
<P>
<IMG SRC="../images/Bullet.gif" BORDER=0>
Select a suitable portfolio of investments, ensuring your retirement savings are soundly diversified and monitor them on an ongoing basis.
<P>
<IMG SRC="../images/Bullet.gif" BORDER=0>
Ensure that all the paperwork to set-up, transfer and make periodic changes to your RRSP, RRIF or LIF is completed quickly and accurately.
<P>
<IMG SRC="../images/Bullet.gif" BORDER=0>
Make adjustments to your registered and non-registered portfolios in response to changes in administrative rules, tax laws, economic conditions and, of course, changes in your personal conditions.
<P>
Just as importantly, these investment professionals are known for taking responsibility for educating their clients about their investments. To ensure that investors have access to all these valuable services, Mackenzie offers its mutual funds exclusively through independent financial advisors.
<P>

There are many complexities invloved in all areas of personal financial planning. Selecting a good investment product can be a challenge to many of us. Ensuring that a good investment is also an appropriate investment, in terms of balancing risk and return to meet your personal appetite for performance and volatility, tax consequences where appropriate and ensuring the investment selected fits within a broader financial plan is an added challenge.
<P>
Mackenzie has always recommended seeking independent financial advice and therefore we make our mutual funds available exclusively through independednt financial professionals.

<IMG SRC="images/Suggestion1.gif" BORDER=0 ALT="Suggestion 1">
Contribute as much and as early as you can. Time, money, and tax savings are a powerful combination. Here's proof: This table shows the advantage of early investing. A 20 year old, a 30 year old and a 40 year old are all saving money on a monthly basis until age 65. 
To compensate for the shorter periods of time available to the older investors, the 30 year old invests twice as much as the 25 year old. The 40 year old invests three times as much. As you can see, time is a very important factor in investing. Although the 40 year old and the 30 year old actually invested much more money than the 20 year old, at age 65 the 20 year old had by far the biggest nest-egg.

The message is clear. Acting now is one of the most important things you can do in building a financially secure retirement. 
<P>


<IMG SRC="images/Suggestion2.gif" BORDER=0 ALT="Suggestion 2">Consider a spousal RRSP. You get the tax savings while the money compounds tax-free in your husband's or wife's name. This could mean two lower tax brackets upon retirement instead of a single higher one.
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/Suggestion3.gif" BORDER=0 ALT="Suggestion 3">Take advantage of the foreign content allowance. The Income Tax Act now allows you to invest up to 20% of your RRSP's cost value in non-Canadian securities. International investing can build greater stability through diversification  and offers new growth. Mackenzie offers a broad range of mutual funds eligible for this part of your RRSP portfolio. 
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/Suggestion4.gif" BORDER=0 ALT="Suggestion 4">Consolidate your RRSP holdings for easier record keeping  and better growth. There's no limit to the number of RRSPs you can own. But to minimize fees and maintain more control over your portfolio, it's often wise to consolidate your RRSP holdings.
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/Suggestion5.gif" BORDER=0 ALT="Suggestion 5">As a last resort, consider borrowing to contribute. With today's interest rates, it may make sense to borrow money to invest in an RRSP as long as the RRSP is earning a good rate of return - and you pay off the loan promptly. Although your borrowing costs are non-deductible, you can reduce your debt by using your tax refund. Plus, you'll have a bigger nest egg for retirement.
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/Suggestion6.gif" BORDER=0 ALT="Suggestion 6">Ask about a Pre-Authorized Chequing Plan from Mackenzie. <A HREF="/cgi-bin/MKNet/PersonalFinance/Outside/Installment.cgi">Investing by Installment</A> is a no-cost way to contribute to your RRSP directly from your bank or trust company account. And, you can benefit from dollar cost averaging through regular contributions.
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/Suggestion7.gif" BORDER=0 ALT="Suggestion 7">Rely on <A HREF="../FinancialAdvice/index.html">professional investment advice</A>. An independent investment advisor can help you set goals for your RRSP, and develop a balanced, diversified portfolio that fits your personal investment objectives.
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/Suggestion8.gif" BORDER=0 ALT="Suggestion 8">Avoid taking a short-term view. RRSPs build wealth for the long-term. So should mutual funds. That's why you should assess a mutual fund based on the long-term record of its manager.
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/Suggestion9.gif" BORDER=0 ALT="Suggestion 9">Maintain an appropriate mix of asset classes. The two most significant asset classes are fixed income securities  such as bonds and mortgage-backed securities  and equities. Research has shown that the relative weightings of asset categories within a portfolio is responsible for over 90% of investment returns. 
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/Suggestion10.gif" BORDER=0 ALT="Suggestion 10">Select a manager with a solid performance track record who can offer a wide range of fully exchangeable funds. Over time you may wish to add additional diversification to your portfolio or adjust your asset mix.

		<CTE>The effects of Mackenzie's prosperity are far-reaching, with both fund unitholders and corporate shareholders benefitting from the company's well-being.<BR><P>

But Mackenzie's success extends well beyond the core businesses in which the company operates. Money is also redirected into the community through two key routes - employment and charitable activities.<BR><P>
