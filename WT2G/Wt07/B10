overseas in 1994 than in the previous year. How a company selects and manages the people

<em>Capitalizing on the Global Workforce </em>is the only book of its kind to examine the array of 
international human resource issues faced by organizations and expatriates. It introduces the 
Windham International Cultural Model, a guide to understanding how culture affects the way 
people behave and think, and provides a cultural context for the practical aspects of deploying, 
selecting and compensating expatriates for maximum success.<br>

<p><font size=1>As it becomes increasingly easy to copy technology, companies are faced with finding new 
methods or &quot;tools&quot; that can increase the human side of creativity and innovation. 
Brainstorming and story boarding are probably the most popular creative thinking techniques in 
the workplace, however, they are actually the weakest methods available. While the most 
well-known techniques are helpful in setting an environment that supports creative thinking, 
they do not explicitly guide thoughts in creative directions.<br>
<em><br>
Creativity, Innovation and Quality</em> presents the latest thinking on creativity and innovation, 
and shows how creative thinking can be used to advance the practice of quality management. 
Covering both the theory and applications of creative thinking in quality management, 
<em>Creativity, Innovation and Quality</em> enables the reader to:</font> </p>
<ul>
<li><font size=1>Understand how recent advances in cognitive science can unlock the creative potential 
in everyone</font></li>

<p align=left><font size=1>Organizations live or die as systems not processes. Their success or failure is a function of how

<p><font size=1>&quot;The purpose of this excellent book is to help managers lead teams to greater productivity. 
Zenger succeeds admirably in enabling all leaders and managers to do just that. This is a clearly 
written, down-to-earth and useful guide.&quot; ---Warren Bennis,<em> University Professor and 
Distinguished Professor of Business Administration, USC, and author of Creative Collaboration</em></font> </p>
<p><font size=1>Peter Drucker, renowned business author and consultant, and Jack Welch, the most respected 
CEO in the United States today, have both stated that productivity is the number one issue 
facing corporations.<br>
<br>
Best-selling author and trainer Jack Zenger agrees, and shows that productivity gains can result 
only if people work smarter, not longer. That can only happen where management creates a 
work environment that supports and motivates the creativity and innovation their employees 
have to offer.<br>
<br>
The problems?</font> </p>
<ol>
<li><font size=1>Productivity is far below where it could and should be.</font></li>
<li><font size=1>The average executive believes their organization is functioning at about 60% of 
potential.</font></li>
<li><font size=1>Only a handful of companies have any organized effort to address productivity 
improvement.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font size=1>Zenger's conclusion? People are the key. Firms that employ knowledge and service workers are 
able to borrow the same money, share many of the same technologies and have access to the 
same pools of raw materials and supplies as their competitors. How then can any company 
outdistance the competition in productivity improvement? <br>
<br>
The only way to distinguish yourself from the competition and move ahead of the pack is to 
utilize the natural resource you already have, the critical resource which most companies all too 
often ignore: People!<br>
<br>
Using straightforward language and examples culled from 40 years of helping companies to 
improve productivity, Zenger uncovers the human side of the productivity equation and offers 
concrete suggestions and 22 specific steps to creating a new era of workplace <br>
productivity and profitability.</font> </p>
<p><font size=1>&quot;Jack Zenger's latest book is an extraordinary collection of common sense wisdom. If managers 
and supervisors in all kinds of organizations read and applied its practical advice, their 
leadership would accelerate to new levels and America's productivity would skyrocket beyond 
belief.&quot; --- Stephen J. Frangos,<em> President of Frangos Consulting and author of Team Zebra</em></font> </p>

<p><font size=1>&quot;Three words used most often in this book, team, human and resolution, describe Joan and Ken. 
It is their team approach to all problems, their basic humanity and love of life, and their true 
desire to resolve conflict that makes them and this book so effective.&quot;<br>

<p><font size=1>Can you imagine how rewarding it would be, each day, to truly enjoy going to work?<br>
Most people spend the better part of their waking hours in jobs they do not enjoy. The 
happiest, most productive employees are those who have either found a job they truly enjoy, or 
found ways to make their current jobs more enjoyable. If we can get more pleasure and 
satisfaction from our work time, it would immeasurably improve the quality of our lives.<br>
<br>
For more than 30 years, authors Joan Goldsmith and Kenneth Cloke have worked with teams 
and employers to create positive work environments in which communication between all 
levels is respectful, creativity is encouraged and people are acknowledged and supported.<em> Thank 
God It's Monday! </em>provides real-world examples and exercises to stimulate employees and 
employers into creating better work lives.<br>
<em><br>
Thank God It's Monday!</em> identifies 14 core values that will make any work more stimulating and 
satisfying, including:</font> </p>
<ul>
<li><font size=1>Inclusion of everyone</font></li>
<li><font size=1>Celebration of diversity</font></li>
<li><font size=1>Open and honest communication</font></li>
<li><font size=1>Risk taking</font></li>
<li><font size=1>Opportunities for personal growth</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font size=1><em>Thank God It's Monday! </em>will be valuable to employees seeking to increase satisfaction in their 
current jobs, displaced employees searching for the work situations that are best for them, and 
employers and organizational leaders looking to keep their best employees by creating 
energetic and vibrant workplaces. <em>Thank God It's Monday! </em>provides scores of ready-to-use 
activities, worksheets and exercises that will help transform the workplace into a second home 
that everyone wants to return to each day.</font> </p>
<p><font size=1>&quot;This book offers both wonderful insights and practical tools. Cloke and Goldsmith walk the 
talk, speaking in a language of humanism to capture our &#145;hearts and minds' and equip our &#145;heads 
and hands.' This book is a must for anyone who shares a concern for, and belief in, people and 
is committed to truly effecting organization change.&quot; --- Lance Dublin, <em>CEO and President,

</strong></em></font></font><font size=2>Managing with Courage &amp; Conviction in the Age of Uncertainty</font> </p>
<p><font size=1>America has a growing leadership crisis. Americans today are held less accountable for their 
actions than ever before. Will this undeniable trend ruin American individuals' drive for 
excellence?<br>
This leadership vacuum in American industry is nothing new. Led by the automobile and steel 
industries, established U.S. firms have seen their markets decline under the onslaught of fierce 
foreign competition. <br>
<br>
While leaders in companies such as Motorola and GE made hard choices, invested heavily in 
their products and their people, and emerged as companies that can compete effectively 
anywhere, leaders in most U.S. firms are still reluctant to step up to the plate and make similar 
decisions.<br>
It is just a matter of time before these firms have no choice but to act. Business leaders must 
recognize, and then take steps to solve, the forces resisting leadership.<br>
<br>
Today's problems stem from four major sources:</font> </p>
<ol>
<li><font size=1>Divisions in the workplace</font></li>
<li><font size=1>Destruction of the work ethic</font></li>
<li><font size=1>Obsession with harmony</font></li>
<li><font size=1>Fear of change</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font size=1><em>The Will to Lead</em> doesn't pull any punches. Government, unions, welfare, education, affirmative 
action&#151;all come under the authors' microscope. The result is a detailed framework for 
emphasizing teamwork while encouraging leadership, highlighting and demanding personal 
accountability, and more. Tactics and strategies developed by Ford, Motorola, MCI and others 
are examined <br>
and their effectiveness graded.<br>
<br>
The result is a timely and provocative book that approaches this growing problem from a new 
and controversial angle, and is guaranteed to provoke commentary and reaction.</font> </p>

<p><font size=2><strong>WHAT IS CORPORATE SOUL MUSIC?<br>
</strong></font><br>
<font size=2>Throughout our lifetimes the pressures and demands of daily life take over. &#147;As we hit our 30&#146;s and 40&#146;s, it&#146;s 
almost universal to lose touch with our beliefs and with what makes us authentic - with what we deeply care 
about,&#148; says management consultant and author Allan Cox. &#147;The same is true for organizations.&#148; As they age, 
they lose touch with their core reasons for being. Their focus becomes blurred, their results diminished.<br>
<br>
In this demanding workplace and global marketplace it is critical to reach back to our essence, to find what truly 
drives us, to find our soul, Cox says. &#147;Soul&#148; is no longer a soft concept. Rather, it is emerging as the crucial 
element for driving a top-notch workforce and fulfilled company.<br>
<br>
What is corporate soul music? It is the sound of companies united with their own purpose.<br>
</font><br>
<font size=2><strong>REDEFINING CORPORATE SOUL: Linking Purpose and People </strong><em>by Allan Cox with Julie Liesse</em> shows how 
both individuals and companies can turn &#147;inside out&#148; to recapture a lost energy and regain sight of their unique 
mission, values and purpose. Cox and Liesse cite some of this era&#146;s most successful firms that have achieved 
along with increased profit a palpable swelling of corporate pride and the public mystique that accompanies it - 
from <strong>Motorola</strong> to the <strong>Body Shop</strong>, <strong>Nike</strong>, to <strong>Northwest Airlines</strong>. And the authors identify some small- to 
medium-sized companies - <strong>Consolidated Communications</strong>, <strong>lassie Partners</strong>, <strong>The Spectrum Group</strong> - that have 
experienced real resonance, regularly singing their song with power.<br>
<br>
What makes these firms first-rate? They are marked, the authors reveal, by a &#147;here and now contact with their 
own authenticity - their corporate soul.&#148;<br>
<br>
Take, for example, <strong>The Spectrum Group</strong>, a company that installs and customizes computer systems. The 
company&#146;s hidden goal - its purpose - is not merely to win new clients or successfully install systems. &#147;What 
really pulls this group of talented people is the desire to win recognition for their good work,&#148; writes Cox. They 
say:&#148; It&#146;s not just about being dependable...We love the feeling that we are respected for what we do. That&#146;s 
what lights our fire.&#148; And previously struggling <strong>Northwest Airlines </strong>has become the leading on-time- major 
airline, motivating its employees with a mission statement beginning: &#147;Customer loyalty keeps us flying.&#148; And 
<strong>Household International&#146;s</strong> 75-person accounting department&#146;s drive to improve was put into these words: &#147;we 
add value - not just numbers.&#148;<br>
<br>
For a company to unite inscription takes sincere self-examination - entirely similar to the journey an individual 
must take to regain fundamental beliefs left along a career path. As Cox states, successful enterprise &#147;whether or 
not for profit, depends on the ripple effect&#148; - linking purpose with people, and linking people with each other and 
with beliefs, ideas and impulses. Questions for self-examination apply for the company as well as the employee, 
for the human resources director as well as the chairman of the board.<br>
<br>
Cox and Liesse&#146;s book is designed to fit in a briefcase alongside the laptop and cellular phone. Short enough to 
finish on a coast to coast flight, it is a powerful tool combining real-life anecdotes, inspiring quotes, and 
insider-savvy advice. Above all, <strong>REDEFINING CORPORATE SOUL</strong> has a soul of its own, linking instinct with 
action - bringing to the surface that flash of remembrance for a long-lost sense of purpose that cam be turned to 
the company&#146;s tasks at hand.<br>
<br>
Allan Cox, chairman of Berryman Communications Company, is the author of six books on management, 
including <em>Confessions of a Corporate Headhunter</em> and <em>Straight Talk for Monday Morning</em>. A management 
consultant for 30 years, he now maintains a limited practice with CEOs and their staffs on purpose-based 
organizational growth. He is also CEO of Amateur All-Star Baseball, Inc., a not-for-profit alliance that directs the 
programs of more that half the organized youth baseball in the United States.<br>
<br>
Julie Liesse, an award-winning journalist, is former Chicago bureau chief of<em> Advertising Age</em>, a leading weekly 
business publication.<br>

<h2><a name="features"><font color="#800000"><font size=3><em>Key Features</em></font></font></a></h2>
<p><font size=3>Arranged in four parts,<strong> </strong></font><font size=2><em><strong>REDEFINING CORPORATE SOUL</strong></em></font><font size=3><strong> </strong>charts the course through which 
management consultant Cox has captained corporations to their true beginnings.<br>
<br>
&#176; Rediscovering a corporation&#146;s original purpose and articulating and connecting with that purpose 
in sincere, encompassing missions statement.<br>
<br>
&#176; Renewing a corporation&#146;s life and opening its boundaries to find its essential &#147;song&#148; which the 
corporation can then sing with power and conviction.<br>
<br>
&#176; Expressing that song through vital, fluid teamwork - based upon true collaborations that don&#146;t 
depend on consensus - as Cox calls it &#147;full voices, superior choices...involved, interested, and 
unintimidated.&#148;<br>
<br>
&#176; Making infotech a mate, not an obstacle, to corporate soul by using information technology to 
foster team relationships, revitalize communications, and intensify connections.</font></p>

<em>- Fortune Magazine (7/16/90)<br>
</em></font></font></p>
<p align=left><font color="#000000"><font size=2>What do Billie Holiday, Eric Clapton, the Beatles and Nostradamous have to do with business? A great deal, 
according to Barry Gibbons, the former Chairman and CEO of Burger King. From the wisdom he has culled from 
his 25 years of business experience combined with &quot;encounters&quot; and &quot;conversations&quot; with a rogue cast of 
famous&#151;and often infamous&#151;characters (both the quick and the dead), Gibbons has written an irreverent new 
book. THIS INDECISION IS FINAL: 32 Management Secrets of Albert Einstein, Billie Holiday, and a Bunch of 
Other People Who Never Worked 9 to 5 (Irwin, June 1996, $21.95) is his irrepressible challenge to the corporate 
status quo. With a little help from his friends, Gibbons uses everyday examples to explain vital business 
concepts, such as the importance of brand recognition la Michael Jackson and James Taylor's take on missions 
statements, ethics codes and operating manuals. And everything, everything&#151;is fair game to him&#151;from 
diversity to women in the workplace, from social responsibility to reengineering.<br>
<br>
&quot;The equivalent of a Swiss army knife,&quot; is how Gibbons describes This Indecision Is Final. &quot;A compendium of 
useful tools in a single unit, designed to fit in your pocket and armed with which you can take on anything.&quot; By 
combining sensible advice with ironic wit and a touch of the absurd, Gibbons deconstructs business 
concepts&#151;virtual organizations, teams, and all the other hot topics of the moment &#151;in a desire to entertain and 
enlighten. He wants to shake up and change the business community and, while he's at it, to give it a sense of 
humor.</font></font></p>
<p align=left><font color="#000000"><font size=2><strong>ABOUT THE AUTHOR<br>
</strong>Barry Gibbons, an Englishman, came to the U.S. in the late 1980s as head of the Florida-based Burger King 
Corporation. After five years, during which he was named one of Fortune magazine's &quot;Turnaround Champs&quot; in 
1991, he quit his position as Chairman and CEO of his own accord and left big business completely &#151;while still 
two years short of his 50th birthday. Today, he has homes and private business interests on both sides of the 
Atlantic, and runs his own company, Festina, for his speaking, writing and consultancy work, which includes an 
offbeat newspaper column on business. </font></font></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><font color="#000000"><font size=3>Armed only with offbeat humor and insight, the candid former chairman and CEO of Burger King 
takes on almost everything related to the corporate world in this series of essays, including:</font></font></p>

<p align=left><font color="#000000"><font size=2>This book tackles the subjects of total quality and business engineering from a ground-breaking dual 
perspective of both reengineering and quality management. This new approach to the total quality concept, 
called &#147;total reengineering,&#148; aims to satisfy shareholders, employees, and customers simultaneously. In the past, 
total quality and reengineering were treated separately. This book is the first to unite the two subjects into one 
integrated management approach.<br>
<br>
<em>Integrating Reengineering with Total Quality</em> includes:</font></font></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left><font color="#000000"><font size=2>&#183; A description of the &#147;Total Quality Triad&#148; -- three distinct groups affected by the 
implementation of total quality.<br>
&#183; An analysis of the three aspects of TQM -- technology, logic, and the human <br>
dimension -- and how each has contributed to the evolution of TQM practices.<br>
&#183; An explanation of the interrelationship between total quality as an objective, and <br>
using business reengineering as a means to achieve it.</font></font></p>

environmental operations. ISO 14000 has captured the attention of business and governments worldwide and, 
following in the footsteps of the ISO 9000 quality management standards, ISO 14000 registration will likely 
become a global passport to doing business for thousands of companies.<br>
<br>
<em>ISO 14000: A Guide to the New Environmental Management Standards </em>explores the ISO 14000 series in detail, 
traces the history and development of the standards, and describes each standard in the series, including 
environmental management, environmental auditing, labeling, performance evaluation, and life cycle assessment.<br>
<br>
<em>ISO 14000: A Guide to the New Environmental Management Standards</em> explores the implications of these new 
standards for international trade and regulatory enforcement. It explains the ISO 14000 registration process and 
offers guidance in understanding and implementing ISO 14000. This comprehensive preview of the ISO 14000 
series is for companies that want to know what ISO 14000 is, how it will affect them, and what they can do about 
it.<br>

<p><font size=1>More and more companies, regardless of their size, are required to purchase materials outside 
the United States. Many buyers and other purchasing professionals lack the skills or the 
confidence to be successful in international purchasing or to manage foreign suppliers and the 
supply chain that results. Too often, buyers are obligated to rely on expensive subsidiaries, 
representatives, and brokers rather than deal directly with international suppliers themselves. 
Now, <em>Global Supply Management</em> explains the techniques that leading-edge companies use to 
get the best from their suppliers around the world. <em>Global Supply Management </em>is a tool for 
teaching purchasing professionals the essentials of culture, language, law, customs, logistics, and 
currency management&#151;the information world-class companies need to find world-class 
suppliers. <br>
<br>
Some specific topics include:</font> </p>
<ul>
<li><font size=1>Cultural differences and how they affect purchasing</font></li>
<li><font size=1>Managing international logistics and customs operations, and setting expectations for<br>

timely, authoritative, and practical book on how to make the initial steps of the manufacturing 
process faster, more efficient, and easier on the bottom line. Set-up time reduction program

most expensive private schools, it's closer to $100,000. Every year, these costs increase at

revealing that even though college costs are steep, it is not true that financing a college 
education is impossible. <em>Secure Your Child's Future </em>details scholarship and funding options 
available to parents and children, and offers a smart savings and investment plan. <br>

</strong></em></font></font><font size=2>Revised Edition</font> </p>
<p><font size=1>More than 20,000 investors cashed in on the strategic sales secrets found in the first edition of 
this expert stock guide. Now, with the stock market at all time highs, even more readers are 
eager to identify the most opportune time to liquidate their stock positions and steer their 
investing decisions safely and profitably through a volatile stock market.<br>
<br>
An investor's success depends far more on when they sell a stock than on when they purchase 
it. And yet, most investors have a tendency to hold on to a stock far longer than is profitable. 
Brokers, too, have their own hesitations about advising clients to sell. The inescapable 
conclusion is that investors need help knowing when to cash in whether they are individual 
investors, stock brokers, or money managers.<br>
<br>
This must-have guide helps readers identify and overcome their resistance to selling stock and 
shows them how to earn the maximum profit through strategic selling. Cassidy also provides 
investors with practical advice on how to sell successfully in changing market conditions 
including a checklist to help investors decide if they should sell or hold in adverse markets. <br>
<br>
<em>It's When You Sell That Counts</em> reveals for the first time:</font> </p>
<ul>
<li><font size=1>The hidden reasons we resist selling</font></li>
<li><font size=1>Survival tactics for individuals in the market jungle</font></li>
<li><font size=1>The ways investors rationalize their inaction</font></li>
<li><font size=1>The most powerful hold/sell test</font></li>

</blockquote>
<p><font size=1><em>Wealth in a Decade</em> is about becoming wealthy in as few as 10 years. The author defines wealth 
as the ability to live off the return of one's investment portfolio. When this level of financial 
security is achieved, life is filled with many new and exciting choices.<br>
<br>
This is not a get-rich-quick scheme. The investment strategies outlined in Wealth in a Decade 
were discovered during Brett Machtig's research involving hundreds of investors who became 
wealthy in as few as ten years.<br>
<br>
It involves identifying realistic goals and laying out a practical, achievable plan for increasing 
savings, getting out of debt and implementing an investment program to make the savings 
grow. These strategies can be implemented with or without the help of an investment 
professional.<br>
<em>Wealth in a Decade</em> will allow readers to achieve wealth in as few as ten years and show them 
how to:</font> </p>
<ul>
<li><font size=1>Gain control of spending and get out of debt.</font></li>
<li><font size=1>Use the three driving forces that will move the markets.</font></li>
<li><font size=1>Manage assets in such a way as to buy low and sell high in any market.</font></li>
<li><font size=1>Implement the laws, strategies, and tactics that hundreds of investors have used to 
become wealthy.</font></li>

<p><font size=1>Although saving and investing are the cornerstones of personal prosperity, millions of 
Americans find themselves living from paycheck to paycheck, with little or no money left 
over to save, much less to invest.<br>
<br>
To seize control of their financial futures, most Americans need to learn new strategies for 
keeping and growing the money they have, and tips for increasing their income. <em>Wealth Starts 
at Home </em>outlines 10 strategies that lead readers toward securing a bright financial future.<br>
<br>
Thirty million people, currently working full or part time from the comfort of their own 
homes, have realized that a home business is not only convenient, it also allows them to save 
money for their future like never before. Sixty million more Americans are expected to join 
them by the year 2000.<br>
<br>
David D'Arcangelo explains that anyone, even those with a net worth as low as $500, can open 
a home-based business and immediately expand their income while generating all-important tax 
breaks.<br>
<br>
Written in an easygoing style and packed with real-world examples and tips, <em>Wealth Starts at 
Home</em> outlines other goals average readers can achieve, including:</font> </p>
<ul>
<li><font size=1>How to secure personal financial needs</font></li>

strategies available to readers everywhere. By the time they reach the last page, readers will be

worth knowing about investing in mutual funds.</p>
<p>Because they are a terrific vehicle for most investors, mutual funds are proliferating rapidly. Buth 
with so many offerings, success means hunting down better information, making disciplined choices, 
and avoiding seductive misconceptions. This book helps with all three. It will equip you to de

<p>A <em>Commonsense Guide to Mutual Funds</em> clrifies the strategies that winning fund managers use to 
gain the edge in performance. Easy-to-remember <strong>dos</strong> and <strong>don'ts </strong>fill in what marketing literature 
from the fund companies and even ratings in personal finance magazines leave out of the picture.</p>
<p>Concentrated, authoritative, and easily put to work, this is mutual fund investing distilled to its most 
useful form.</p>

intrude upon or distract from the copy or cause problems?<br>
<br>
</font><font color="#FF0000"><font size=3><em><strong>Navigation:</strong></em></font></font><font size=2> How effective is the site in educating users about links on the site? Do users

<p align=left><font size=1>&#147;<em>The Paradox Principles </em>teaches us to balance the unique challenges 
we face every day by tapping a rich, renewable source of knowledge 
and ideas: ourselves.&#148; --- Larry Bossidy, <em>CEO AlliedSignal Inc</em>.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align=left><font size=1>Tumultuous changes affecting corporations have left managers and employees reeling from the 
shocks and searching for the holy grail of management solutions to set their companies 
straight. But the techniques-du-jour or programs-of-the-month have done nothing but confuse 
employees, create chaos in the organization, and cause everyone to lose focus of the true 
strategic objectives. The key to success is not just some new technique or management trend. 
It&#146;s just not that simple. The high-performance organizations of tomorrow must learn how to 
deftly balance the tensions and conflicts that challenge the progress and effectiveness of any 
large enterprise. <em>The Paradox Principles </em>shows managers how to face those conflicts and use 
paradox as a dynamic tool to create balance and focus within an organization. Lessons learned 
from executives at over 200 high-performance companies and the collective experience of the 
Price Waterhouse Change Integration&#174; Team show managers how to achieve unparalleled 
success by better managing the paradoxes inherent in their industry, organization, and strategy. 
The authors also show managers facing uncharted waters how to:</font> </p>
<p align=left><font size=1>&#183; Create a high performance organization that is focused and strategically balanced.<br>
&#183; Develop management styles with the best blend of operational efficiency and strategic 
effectiveness.<br>
&#183; Align the actions of everyone through the use of fewer, more effective, performance 
measures.<br>
&#183; Manage the complexity and chaos caused by the level of change buffeting all organizations 
today.<br>
&#183; Move beyond all the hand-wringing about behaviors and beliefs to create a new and positive 
culture in the organization.</font> </p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size=1>&#147;This excellent book is light and easy to read, but delivers a heavy 
message - customers, not management, will determine the ultimate 
success or failure of a business. --- Francis J. Fosenthal, Jr.<em> Vice 
President, Corporate Total Quality, Black &amp; Decker</em></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size=1>This eye-opening book introduces customer focus as a decision that every person in the 
organization will make, every day. Author Paul Levesque provides the readers with both the 
reason and the method for injecting the &#147;wow&#148; factor into their most routine customer 
transactions, regardless of whether their business is a one-person operation or a multinational 
corporation. Central to this book is a step-by-step process -- the Customer Focus Process, or 
CFP -- for guiding your team through a creative customer focus brainstorming session. It is here 
that your team begins to understand and work through the core &#147;phases&#148; of customer focus:</font> </p>
<ul>
<li><font size=1>Define the transaction sequence, or the actual events experienced by the customer, <br>
from start to finish.</font></li>
<li><font size=1>Brainstorm ideas for exceeding customer expectations at each individual step in the 
transaction sequence.</font></li>
<li><font size=1>Develop ways to make customers feel important at each step of the sequence.</font></li>
<li><font size=1>Review customer expectations, and tailor the experience to fit the customer.</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font size=1>This entertaining, easy-to-read guide, provides everything needed to better understand the 
power of customer focus and running a successful CFP session.</font> </p>

</strong></em></font></font></a><font size=1>(excerpted from the March 1996 issue of Quality Systems Update&#146;s &#147;ISO 14000 Environmental Management Report&#148;)</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=center><font color="#FF0000"><font size=3><em><strong>First US Registration to Draft ISO 14001</strong></em></font></font></p>
<p align=left><font size=2><em>SGS-Thomson Microelectronics Inc.</em> has become the first US company to attain accredited 
registration to the draft ISO 14001 standard.<br>
<br>
The semiconductor manufacturer received its certificate in January from the London office of 
<em>Bureau Veritas Quality International (BVQI)</em>, one of a handful of registrars operating in the 
United States that has been accredited to issue registrations to the draft standard.<br>
<br>
Registration to the draft virtually assures <em>SGS-Thomson</em> a place among the first US companies 
to hold ISO 14001 registration once the final standard is published, probably in September. 
QSU will publish a listing of draft ISO 14001 registration achievers beginning in this month&#146;s 
issue.<br>
<br>
John French of <em>BVQI</em>&#146;s North American operations, said the audit was limited to the 
requirements of the draft environmental standard though the company also holds ISO 9000 
registration through another registrar.<br>
<br>
He said <em>BVQI</em> is planning to perform the first joint ISO 9000 and draft ISO 14001 audit this 
month in Alabama. And he said BVQI has tentatively scheduled what he hopes will be the first 
integrated audit of a company&#146;s environmental, quality, safety, and health management 
systems in June.<br>
<br>
This trend, he said, is towards integration of management systems, particularly with respect to 
ISO 9000 and the draft ISO 14001 standard.<br>
<br>
&#147;That&#146;s not to say they are identical. But there are many areas in which they overlap.&#148; he 
explained. &#145;The whole isos of ISO 9000 is that everybody is responsible for quality. The whole 
isos of ISO 14001 is that everybody&#146;s responsible for environmental management.&#148; Rachel 
Long, <em>SGS-Thomson&#146;s ISO 9000 coordinator</em>, said the San Diego facility will eventually 
combine its ISO 9000 and ISO 14001 systems.<br>
<br>
&#147;Our plan is to move it into one system,&#148; she said. &#147;It is my responsibility to ensure that we 
always maintain ISO 9000 registration and to always keep the systems robust whenever we 
implement new systems.&#148;<br>
<br>
<em>SGS-Thomson</em> initially attained approval under the European Union&#146;s voluntary 
<em>Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS)</em> regulations, which require companies to 
implement a formal environmental management systems. since the company based its system 
on the requirements of the draft ISO 14001 document, it was able to also pursue registration to 
the draft.</font></p>

Efficiently access and analyze any type of remote sensing data with
ENVI, the most interactive, powerful and easy-to-use image processing
package available. An extensible GUI lets you examine even the most
complex images. You can import spectral libraries and perform
sub-pixel analysis to discover more information with ENVI's advanced
set of hyperspectral tools. Improve identification with ENVI's
integrated radar tools by selecting polarizations, analyzing
scattering patterns and extracting textural information. Due to
ENVI's powerful underlying language, IDL, you can also customize all
or part of ENVI to suit your individual needs.

The Visible Human CD is the first complete digital photographic reference for exploring human anatomy, equipping medical researchers, practitioners and educators with a simple, yet powerful tool for education and exploration. More than 10,000 image slices from a human male are compressed for convenient access onto a single CD-ROM. 
<P>
Voyage through the body guided by the graphical <I>Visible Human Navigator.</I> Quickly reference images using bookmarks. Animate a series of images to gain insight into anatomical relationships and structure. Annotate and highlight areas of interest with text, color, and markers. Adjust brightness and gamma corrections of MR and CT images for interactive analysis.
<P>
Images can be exported to popular desktop packages for manipulation, processing, and hardcopy output.
<p><a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/visible/visible_human.html">The National Library of Medicine</a> provided the data for the Male and Female Visible Human as part of the <i>Visible Human Project</i>, a research effort undertaken to create complete three-dimensional sets of anatomically-detailed human male and female images.

It is not claimed that theseroutines are the ultimate in efficiency, they work well for their originalpurpose, and may be of general interest.  Some routines have been updatedto take advantage of new features in IDL.  Other routines will be updatedin the future.  These routines have not been tested for PV-WAVE.One demonstration library is also included to show how the eqv routine works.
<P>The three IDL libraries are:

<LI>idlusr: General interest routines. Categories include:     	
text file/string manipulation, text strings, date &amp; time routines,  plotting/graphics, imaging, array processing, math routines, programming routine, widget tools, etc. A PostScript document describing date &amp; time routines is available on the site in the compressed file idl_time.ps.Z.    
<LI>idlusr2: Somewhat more specialized routines.  This library is still rather small but it is expected that a number of idlusr routines will be moved here eventually (as time permits).	
<LI>idldoc:  Routines and files related to maintaining and documenting  the above libraries and your own local libraries.

<P>AVIRIS is an acronym for the Airborne Visible InfraRed Imaging Spectrometer.
AVIRIS is a world class instrument in the realm of Earth Remote Sensing. It is aunique optical sensor that delivers calibrated images of the upwelling spectral radiance in 224 contiguous spectral channels (also called bands) with wavelengths from 400 to 2500 nanometers (nm). The instrument flies aboard a NASA ER-2 airplane (a U2 plane modified for increased performance) at approximately 20 km above sea level, at about 730 km/hr. AVIRIS has flown all across the US, plus Canada and Europe. <P>The science objectives of the AVIRIS project are broad. In a nutshell, the main objective is to identify, measure, and monitor constituents of the Earth's surface and atmosphere based on molecular absorption and particle scattering signatures. Research with AVIRIS is dominantly directed towards understanding processes related to the global environment and climate change.

<center>RESEARCH  SYSTEMS  ANNOUNCES  FEMALE  VERSION  OF VISIBLE  HUMAN  CD  </center><p>
<center>New CD is world's first complete, digital reference of the female anatomy</center>

<p>BOULDER, Colo. -- Research Systems, Inc. (RSI), a developer of multi-platformdata analysis software headquartered here, today announced that a  femaleversion of its popular Visible Human CD will be available in February 1997.
 <p>The Female Visible Human CD will be the world's first  digital reference ofthe female anatomy containing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computedtomography (CT), and X-ray images.  There are several CDs on the marketcontaining digital images of the male anatomy, including  Research Systems'original Visible Human CD.
<p>
With Research Systems' Female Visible Human CD, medical professionals,researchers, and educators can conveniently visualize and navigate a humanbody -- from optical nerves to Achilles tendons to bony features and muscles-- using actual photographs of the female anatomy.  The CD contains more than10,000 images in axial, coronal and sagittal orientations, giving users asimple, yet powerful tool for education and exploration.
<p>
Working in cooperation with the National Library of Medicine (NLM), Bethesda,Md., Research Systems acquired nearly 5,000 axial photos and computed thesagittal and coronal cross-sections, allowing users to view the FemaleVisible Human from any of three orientations.  For efficient storage andretrieval, the Female Visible Human images (over 10 gigabytes of data) arecompressed onto a single CD using JPEG, the industry-standard compressionformat.
<p>
The Female Visible Human CD contains a graphical Navigator, which was builtwith Research Systems' IDL <I>(Interactive Data Language) </I>software, aprogramming environment widely used by scientists and engineers to build dataanalysis and data visualization applications.  The Navigator is amouse-driven browser that lets users select a body section, click on it, andretrieve the corresponding images in any of the three orientations.  With theNavigator, users can also annotate and highlight areas of interest with text,color and markers; create bookmarks for commonly viewed body sections; andanimate a series of images to gain greater insight into anatomicalrelationships and structure.
<p>
Many of the 10,000 images are available in both low and high resolution.  Asingle image, or sets of images, can be easily exported for processing oroutput to standard graphics formats such as TIFF, PICT, GIF, PostScript, EPS,and BMP.
<p>
The Visible Human Project, a federally-funded $1.4 million research program,began in 1989 when NLM project directors Michael Ackerman and Donald Lindbergconceived the idea and, working with the University of Colorado's Dr. VicSpitzer, put together the technologies needed to create the images.  Theinitial goal of the program was to create complete three-dimensional sets ofanatomically-detailed images of a human male and female for educationalpurposes.
<p>
The images for Research Systems' new Female Visible Human CD were collectedfrom a 59-year-old woman who died of heart disease.  Researchers at theUniversity of Colorado's Health Sciences Center, Boulder, Colo., scanned thebody using a variety of techniques including computed tomography, magneticresonance imaging, and X-ray imaging.  They then froze the corpse in gelatin,shaved off 0.33 millimeter slivers, and photographed each newly-exposedsurface with a digital camera.  Finally, they merged all of the images toform one three-dimensional computer model.
<p>
This digital cadaver forms the basis for lifelike simulations of surgical andradiation treatments, and has also proved valuable as an educational tool forstudents at all levels.  By providing this electronic yardstick of the"normal" female, the Visible Human project is intended to simplify andstandardize the study of human anatomy.
<p>
The National Library of Medicine, part of the National Institutes of Health,has made the Female Visible Human available to any interested parties via theInternet, but at more than 40 gigabytes -- the equivalent of 24 millionprinted pages and 300 times more storage than an average hard drive -- itwould take several weeks, 24 hours-a-day, to download.
<p>
That's where Research Systems' Female Visible Human CD comes in.  "Our CDmakes the majority of these remarkable images accessible and convenient foranyone with a computer and CD-ROM drive," said Denise M. Fields, vicepresident of sales & marketing at Research Systems.  "Because of the hugememory requirements and lengthy download time, acquisition of the datadirectly from the NLM via the Internet is impractical for most people.  Butwith our Female Visible Human CD, students, researchers and other medicalprofessionals have a wealth of knowledge at their fingertips -- literally a mouse-click away."

<p>The Female Visible Human CD costs $495* and is available for PCs runningWindows 3.1, Windows 95, Windows NT, Macintosh, and Power Macintosh; and Unixworkstations from Sun Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard, and Silicon Graphics.  
<p>
Research Systems also sells a two-volume set containing both the male andfemale CDs for $795*.
<p>
Educational discounts are available.

<center><p><B>RESEARCH SYSTEMS ANNOUNCES ENVI FREELOOK</B></center>
<center><p><b>ENVI FreeLook-Freeware for Basic Data Viewing and Processing</b></center>

<p>Research Systems, Inc. has recently made available ENVI FreeLook, a basic, user-friendly viewing and data quality assessment software package for a wide variety of data sets. FreeLook is distributed as freeware via the internet and may be used without fee by any individual for non-commercial use and by any United States government organization. Earthwatch has selected FreeLook as the viewer to be included with its commercial Earlybird satellites. To get a copy of FreeLook go to <a href="ftp://ftp.rsinc.com/pub/">Research Systems' anonymous ftp site.</a>

<p><B>Basic, Useful Processing</B>
<p>Written in IDL, FreeLook provides an easy means to preview data and perform limited image processing. Contrast enhancement, image sharpening, edge detection and image smoothing are controlled from FreeLook's GUI. The software will also read cursor position and value for both pixel-based and georeferenced imagery to extract Z-profile (spectrum) datum from multispectral and hyperspectral data and to measure distances from points along transcects. And, FreeLook lets users stretch images using Linear 0%, Linear 2%, Equalization and Square Root with histograms information in the Image or Scroll window.

<p>Grayscale and RGB images are displayed in three windows. The "Scroll Window" shows large images at a subsampled resolution (if image size is larger than the screen size); the "Main Image Display" shows a portion of the the image at full resolution; the "Zoom Window" shows a subset of the main display with a zoom factor applied. The current subsampling factor for the Scroll Window and zoom factor for the Zoom Window are displayed in the title bar at the top of their respective display windows.

<p><B>Great File & Data Support</B>
<p>Developed by Better Solutions Consulting, LLC, ENVI FreeLook provides basic viewing, data selection, and dataquality assessment capabilities for a wide variety of image data.  ENVIFreeLook Version 1.0 supports common image formats including GIF, TIFF, JPEG, and flatbinary files. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory's  AIRSAR/SIR-C complex scattering data can also be synthesized to image format for viewing. Support for specific remote sensing data types including AVIRIS, GeoTIFF, Landsat, SPOT, Planetary Data System, and Radarsat is planned for s future release during the 1st quarter of 1997.<br>
<p>FreeLook runs on multiple platforms and operating systems, including Windows 3.11, Windows 95, Windows NT, Macintosh and Power Mac, and popular Unix platforms (SGI, Sun, HP, IBM, & DEC). Online help describes the software's capabilities and functions.

To improve this situation, hydrologists first need a way to measure and visualize the intricate 3D geometry of river basins," explains Scott Peckham, who developed RiverTools, a software toolkit for the analysis of digital terrain and river networks. Traditionally, hydrologists spent many tedious hours making measurements by hand from topographic maps, which precluded the possibility of studying large basins, like the Mississippi.<P><I><B>Necessity---The Mother of Development</B></I><BR>Peckham was inspired to write RiverTools while working on his doctorate at the University of Colorado. Frustrated by the limitations of existing C and FORTRAN code, Peckham sought to develop an integrated "point-and-click" toolkit that would be easy to use and extend. Speed and platform-independence also were important considerations that contributed to his decision to use IDL.<P>RiverTools draws heavily on the many high-level plotting and graphics routines that are built into IDL, making the data analysis and visualization of Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) possible. And its graphical interface exploits IDL's portable widgets and controls. Liberal use of IDL's array operators allows RiverTools to run as fast as compiled FORTRAN code.<P><I><B>Making Sense of Complex Data</B></I><BR>RiverTools was designed to study large drainage basins. The sole data input is a raster grid of elevation values, a DEM. Users generate a digital map of the river networks in the region, which is stored in a vector-based "tree" data structure. This data structure is naturally suited to river networks, which have a treelike appearance when viewed from the air, and allows efficient storage and processing of measured quantities. More than a dozen parameters are automatically measured for every node in the "tree," including geometric characteristics like upstream area, channel lengths, drops, and slopes. Many topological aspects, such as Shreve magnitude and Horton-Strahler order also are measured and allow the internal structure of the "river tree" to be described in precise terms.<P>Numerous data analysis and plotting routines are built into RiverTools. In addition, RiverTools users can work with color images---such as contour plots, shaded relief, and river maps---plot them on the screen, and save them in several formats, including PostScript and GIF. According to Peckham, the ability to view data in multiple forms "really lets you see what the trends are."<P><I><B>Advanced Software for Learning</B></I><BR>Using the cross-platform capability of IDL, RiverTools has been implemented on HP, Sun, DEC, and Macintosh computers. <P>As a research tool, RiverTools has proven invaluable for testing various competing hypotheses about the geometry of river basins. The simple user interface allows RiverTools to be used in the classroom, enabling students to repeat many of the classic studies that they read about. Dr. Vijay Gupta, who served as Peckham's thesis advisor, is using RiverTools for the computer lab component of a course on surface-water hydrology at the University of Colorado in Boulder.<P><ul>To see and learn more about RiverTools, access Peckham's home page on the World Wide Web at: <A HREF="http://cires.colorado.edu/people/peckham.scott/RT.html"><TT>http://cires.colorado.edu/people/peckham.scott/RT.html</TT></A><p> RiverTools can be obtained free of charge by anonymous ftp from<A HREF="ftp://cses.colorado.edu/pub/RiverTools/"><TT>ftp://cses.colorado.edu/pub/RiverTools/</TT></A></ul></table><!-----------------footer-----------------------------><table border=0 cellpadding=0><tr><td colspan=3 valign=left><a href="footer.map"><img width="598" height="36" border=none src="../../graphics/footer.gif" usemap="#footer" ISMAP></a><map name="footer"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="0,0,75,35" HREF="../index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="75,0,150,35" HREF="../../envi/index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="150,0,225,35" HREF="../../vh/index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="225,0,300,35" HREF="../../services/index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="300,0,375,35" HREF="../../index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="375,0,450,35" HREF="../../contacting.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="450,0,525,35" HREF="../../whatsnew/index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="525,0,598,35" HREF="../../dlsw/index.html"></MAP><tr><td valign=left><a href="footer1.map"><img width="598" height="36" border=none src="../../graphics/footer1.gif" usemap="#footer1" ISMAP></a><map name="footer1"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="0,0,166,36" HREF ="../../index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="171,15,297,36" HREF ="../../contacting.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="252,0,385,15" HREF="../../legal.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="490,0,596,36" HREF="../../sitemap.html"></map></table><!-----------------footer-----------------------------></BODY></HTML>

The U.S. Global Change Research Program maps the complex interactions among the atmosphere, ocean, and land for better understanding of the interplay of these systems.<P>Mark Abbott, a researcher at Oregon State University's College of Oceanic and Atmospheric Science (COAS), with support from NASA and the Office of Naval Research, amasses data from ocean-related satellites (including MODIS and the NOAA infrared imagers, as well as ocean buoys) to study biological and physical processes in the upper ocean, the top 100 meters of water. He develops coupled physical/biological models that eventually can be used to predict and understand the effects of changes in physical forcing of the ocean by winds, currents, and land masses. Abbott is also a principal investigator with EOS (Earth Observing System), an interdisciplinary research effort, led by NASA, committed to integrating hardware and software systems, including IDL, to enhance collection and analysis of earth sciences data.<P><I><B>Insightful Models</B></I><BR>Once data are processed, IDL, running on Sun, HP, IBM workstations, Macintosh computers, and Microsoft Windows and Windows NT platforms, is used to display, manipulate, and analyze images.Abbott uses IDL's advanced 3D animation capabilities, color tables, overlays, and maps to construct the models. After images are retrieved, they are saved as PostScript files in color or black and white, for journals, reports, and video tapes.<P><I><B>Accurate Predictions</B></I><BR>Analyses of satellite imagery, wind fields, and drifting buoys show that rapid wind shifts dramatically change ocean circulation patterns.The data sets, combined with a suite of assimilation models, will empower scientists to make reasonable predictions about the effects of a changing environment on the structure and function of the upper ocean. They expect that large-scale changes, such as decreasing stratospheric ozone (which increases surface UV radiation) and changing patterns of wind forcing (as a result of climate change), will significantly alter the patterns of upper-ocean heat flux and carbon cycling.<P>Abbot and his team also are studying ocean fronts, which are strong spatial gradients in water temperature. Surprisingly, significant fluctuations occur on much smaller time and space scales than had been suspected.<p>When Abbott joined COAS, they were using graphics libraries that were difficult to use and debug. "With IDL," Abbott says, "I don't have to sit there and rush through manuals...it's straightforward and easy to go in and change things around."</table><!-----------------footer-----------------------------><table border=0 cellpadding=0><tr><td colspan=3 valign=left><a href="footer.map"><img width="598" height="36" border=none src="../../graphics/footer.gif" usemap="#footer" ISMAP></a><map name="footer"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="0,0,75,35" HREF="../index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="75,0,150,35" HREF="../../envi/index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="150,0,225,35" HREF="../../vh/index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="225,0,300,35" HREF="../../services/index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="300,0,375,35" HREF="../../index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="375,0,450,35" HREF="../../contacting.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="450,0,525,35" HREF="../../whatsnew/index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="525,0,598,35" HREF="../../dlsw/index.html"></MAP><tr><td valign=left><a href="footer1.map"><img width="598" height="36" border=none src="../../graphics/footer1.gif" usemap="#footer1" ISMAP></a><map name="footer1"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="0,0,166,36" HREF ="../../index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="171,15,297,36" HREF ="../../contacting.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="252,0,385,15" HREF="../../legal.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="490,0,596,36" HREF="../../sitemap.html"></map></table><!-----------------footer-----------------------------></BODY></HTML>

Since humans' visual perceptions are a primary source of information acquisition, this shortcoming poses a significant hurdle to making the best analyses of multi-variate data sets.<P>To overcome the data visualization limitations of most GIS systems, Eva-Marie Stephan, working at the University of Zurich's GIS lab, used IDL to design the interactive visualization environment called "DataScaping." This advanced software application provides interactive viewing and exploratory data analysis capabilities for validation of complex data sets, including spatial interpolation, detection of "outliers," and false model assumptions of Arc/Info data.<P><I><B>GUI Tools Speed Development</B></I><BR>Stephan's role centers on assessing the needs of geographers and delivering the applications they need to increase their productivity and analysis accuracy.<p>"IDL is a very good environment for easy and complex GUI building," says Stephan. "The availability of a variety of interface controls and graphical routines, and the possibility to add new routines using a powerful programming language, is a very good concept." Features include 3D and 4D graphical representations, interactivity, dynamic linking of windows, representations for uncertainty in modeled data (blurring, transparency, and probability surfaces), parallel viewing of multiple layers in different scales, animation, and combining and linking realistic and analytic data representations.<P>Stephan's 3D scenes, called "datascapes," can be manipulated interactively using a mouse to change resolution, exaggeration, range, perspective, and color mapping. "When I prototyped the program," Stephan continues, "I began with standard IDL routines. But, as I became more familiar, I wrote my own. There was a smooth transition, which I appreciated."<P><I><B>Flexible Data Handling and Cross-Platform Functionality</B></I><BR>Stephan developed DataScaping on a Sun SPARCstation, but has moved the code to a PowerMac and Silicon Graphics Onyx, where it ran "without any significant problems or code changes."<P>IDL's ability to handle virtually any data format, including HDF, CDF, and netCDF, ensures that users throughout the GIS lab can implement and make accurate analyses with DataScaping without data conversion hassles. <P><I><B>Superior Data Modeling</B></I><BR>DataScaping helps users validate and improve their data modeling and communicate model results and uncertainty for presentations.<P>"Another plus," Stephan says, is that "IDL is very easy to get started with. Good documentation, introductory tutorial, the many widget examples with code...that's what made me choose IDL and not a 'free' software package."Eva-Maria Stephan currently is working on her Ph.D. at the University of Zurich, in the GIS lab.</table><!-----------------footer-----------------------------><table border=0 cellpadding=0><tr><td colspan=3 valign=left><a href="footer.map"><img width="598" height="36" border=none src="../../graphics/footer.gif" usemap="#footer" ISMAP></a><map name="footer"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="0,0,75,35" HREF="../index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="75,0,150,35" HREF="../../envi/index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="150,0,225,35" HREF="../../vh/index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="225,0,300,35" HREF="../../services/index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="300,0,375,35" HREF="../../index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="375,0,450,35" HREF="../../contacting.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="450,0,525,35" HREF="../../whatsnew/index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="525,0,598,35" HREF="../../dlsw/index.html"></MAP><tr><td valign=left><a href="footer1.map"><img width="598" height="36" border=none src="../../graphics/footer1.gif" usemap="#footer1" ISMAP></a><map name="footer1"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="0,0,166,36" HREF ="../../index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="171,15,297,36" HREF ="../../contacting.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="252,0,385,15" HREF="../../legal.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="490,0,596,36" HREF="../../sitemap.html"></map></table><!-----------------footer-----------------------------></BODY></HTML>

The data derived from these methods provide a high-resolution image of reservoir rock, which assists Texaco's research efforts by allowing them to look at the fluids within a rock matrix---as well as the rock matrix itself---before drilling.<P><I><B>Visualizing CT and NMR Data in One Package</B></I><BR>In 1993, Texaco, Inc. released CoreTEX(TM), a visualization and analysis software application that helps researchers quantitatively analyze and visualize CT and NMR data from well cores. Because suitable commercial software programs were not available, CoreTEX was developed using IDL on a MicroVAX II running VMS. The platform was later upgraded to a MicroVAX 3800. CoreTEX includes capabilities for statistical analysis, histogramming, fitting, profiling, highlighting, and color table manipulation. CoreTEX provides a complete graphical user interface and features online help and animated 2D and 3D movie loops.<P><I><B>IDL's Application Power</B></I><BR>IDL was selected as the application environment because development speed and code portability were crucial. The system needs to run on multiple computing platforms and operating systems, and IDL was the software that best satisfied these requirements.<P><I><B>Fast Application Development</B></I><BR>Texaco achieved full functionality using IDL on new workstations after only two person-months of effort. Now, the latest version of CoreTEX contains nearly 300 IDL routines. The graphical interface uses object-oriented techniques that allow Texaco to concurrently evaluate several CT and NMR datasets.</table><!-----------------footer-----------------------------><table border=0 cellpadding=0><tr><td colspan=3 valign=left><a href="footer.map"><img width="598" height="36" border=none src="../../graphics/footer.gif" usemap="#footer" ISMAP></a><map name="footer"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="0,0,75,35" HREF="../index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="75,0,150,35" HREF="../../envi/index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="150,0,225,35" HREF="../../vh/index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="225,0,300,35" HREF="../../services/index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="300,0,375,35" HREF="../../index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="375,0,450,35" HREF="../../contacting.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="450,0,525,35" HREF="../../whatsnew/index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="525,0,598,35" HREF="../../dlsw/index.html"></MAP><tr><td valign=left><a href="footer1.map"><img width="598" height="36" border=none src="../../graphics/footer1.gif" usemap="#footer1" ISMAP></a><map name="footer1"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="0,0,166,36" HREF ="../../index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="171,15,297,36" HREF ="../../contacting.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="252,0,385,15" HREF="../../legal.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="490,0,596,36" HREF="../../sitemap.html"></map></table><!-----------------footer-----------------------------></BODY></HTML>

The Sea Ice WorkStation (SIWS), funded by the British National Space Centre, is being developed by Earth Observation Sciences, Ltd. (EOS), based in Farnham, Surrey, UK to automate the reliable extraction and fusion of remotely-sensed sea ice data from space-borne instruments.<P>Using IDL, EOS developed SIWS  for use on Sun workstations to provide a flexible, upgradable solution that can be used as a production prototype. SIWS generates sea-ice charts in standard or customized forms, presenting the information in a variety of projections and scales based on user criteria or default options. The charts are derived from vector or raster SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) data surrounded by contextual vector information from either AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) or SSM/I (Special Sensor Microwave Imager) instruments. <P>SIWS includes a data catalogue and GUI-based browser that allow incoming imagery or processed results to be searched, viewed, and manipulated for selection and assessment. The system's new algorithms have been validated through comparison with derived data from arctic field campaigns to offer significant advances beyond existing capabilities. The detail and context can be selected from:<UL>	<LI> SAR-derived parameters	<LI> Ice edge	<LI> Total ice density	<LI> Percentage of first year and multi-year ice	<LI> Ice motion	<LI> AVHRR-derived sea surface temperatures	<LI> SSM/I-derived ratios of first year and multi-year ice  </UL><P><I><B>IDL Provides Fast Analysis</B></I><BR>Ice can form and thicken dramatically within hours and travel tens of kilometers per day, pushed by wind and currents. Dr. Neil McIntyre, Business Operations Director at EOS says, "Using IDL, we perform analysis of sea-ice cover on a daily basis." There is widespread need for information on precise location of the ice edge, accurate discrimination of ice types, determination of ice motion, and changing ice characteristics. "IDL is a key instrument for EOS in system development and data processing as it provides easily assimilated, informative, and quick results. System development and data processing times using IDL are very good. IDL is very robust and easy to use."<P>Evaluation of SIWS in Europe and North America is under way to assess the ease-of-use and quality of output in near-operational situations. Interpretation of the information on the computer screen, fax transmission of the ice charts, and access to results via electronic file transfer will be tested. </table><!-----------------footer-----------------------------><table border=0 cellpadding=0><tr><td colspan=3 valign=left><a href="footer.map"><img width="598" height="36" border=none src="../../graphics/footer.gif" usemap="#footer" ISMAP></a><map name="footer"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="0,0,75,35" HREF="../index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="75,0,150,35" HREF="../../envi/index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="150,0,225,35" HREF="../../vh/index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="225,0,300,35" HREF="../../services/index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="300,0,375,35" HREF="../../index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="375,0,450,35" HREF="../../contacting.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="450,0,525,35" HREF="../../whatsnew/index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="525,0,598,35" HREF="../../dlsw/index.html"></MAP><tr><td valign=left><a href="footer1.map"><img width="598" height="36" border=none src="../../graphics/footer1.gif" usemap="#footer1" ISMAP></a><map name="footer1"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="0,0,166,36" HREF ="../../index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="171,15,297,36" HREF ="../../contacting.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="252,0,385,15" HREF="../../legal.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="490,0,596,36" HREF="../../sitemap.html"></map></table><!-----------------footer-----------------------------></BODY></HTML>

GLINT (GLobal data INTerface), an IDL application written by Harvard University student intern Ben Stevens and Scripps Institution of Oceanography staff member David Pierce, specializes in analyzing regional climate variations that often are part of broader patterns extending across hemispheres. A well-known example is the El Ni&ntilde;o phenomenon, in which Pacific Ocean warming along the equator is associated with unusual winter weather across North America.<P>GLINT compares large data sets from numerical models and ship and satellite observations to help understand the forces at work in shaping climates. Results from GLINT will help point the way to better climate forecasts that can help farmers manage crops to get the best yields and civic planners conserve water in anticipation of droughts.<P>Analysis of multiple datasets often presents geophysicists with a formidable challenge: Within the ocean of digital information, how can they efficiently read data, recognize patterns, and determine the significance of the trends? Compounding the problem, a pattern of climate variability might only be valid over a particular region, during certain months or seasons, in different aspects (such as temperature and rainfall), or over a limited number of years. These factors only begin to account for all the elements that go into predictions, making analysis an extremely complex task.<P><I><B>Interactive Analysis Sparks Intuitive Understanding</B></I><BR>GLINT offers weather researchers a host of integrated analysis capabilities, including precise statistics, a  simple GUI, comprehensive 1D, 2D, and 3D data viewing, and animations to make finding weather patterns easier.<P>GLINT asks the statistics module what form of data it can process (for example 1D time-series, or 3D volumetric) and then converts the source data into that format. GLINT's set of statistical modules, written in IDL, includes formulas for averaging by region or season, detrending, correlating, smoothing, and constructing Empirical Orthogonal Functions. <P>Extending GLINT to meet individual user needs is easy using IDL's integrated suite of application development tools. Researchers can quickly add new functionality, at the IDL command line, and the extensions will automatically be added to the pull-down menu.<P>Pierce's graphical interface provides easy access, not only to statistics and number-crunching, but also to powerful visualization techniques. Data can be viewed in a variety of ways and with any  dimension the data supports---along one axis (time-series), two axes (a standard XY map), or three axes (a volumetric data set).<P>A subregion of interest can be selected from a dataset simply by drawing a region on a map with a mouse. Selecting a time domain is just as easy. Sliders determine the starting and ending dates and buttons can be used to select particular months or seasons. Animations deliver understanding into global climate trends and changes. Hardcopy maps can be saved to any number of standard bitmap formats or PostScript.<P><I><B>User Extensibility to Meet Individual Requirements</B></I><BR>According to Stephens and Pierce, GLINT's advanced visualization capabilities, statistics, and portability to popular platforms were primary motivations for choosing IDL. <P>"In practice, it turned out that the 'interpreted/compiled' nature of IDL was as important as the integrated statistics algorithms, since it substantially speeded development time," Pierce says. "Individual modules could be debugged on the fly without requiring exiting the program, recompiling and relinking, then restarting."<P>Developed on DEC Ultrix and  Alpha workstations, "IDL's cross-platform portability made it trivial to port GLINT to a Sun SPARCstation," Pierce adds.<P>Applications that efficiently turn dense mounds of data into significant, revealing imagery will prove to be increasingly useful as data collection processes become more  accurate and the volume of data builds. IDL, and Scripps' GLINT, will provide the tools to increase our understanding of that data and earth's systems.</table><!-----------------footer-----------------------------><table border=0 cellpadding=0><tr><td colspan=3 valign=left><a href="footer.map"><img width="598" height="36" border=none src="../../graphics/footer.gif" usemap="#footer" ISMAP></a><map name="footer"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="0,0,75,35" HREF="../index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="75,0,150,35" HREF="../../envi/index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="150,0,225,35" HREF="../../vh/index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="225,0,300,35" HREF="../../services/index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="300,0,375,35" HREF="../../index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="375,0,450,35" HREF="../../contacting.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="450,0,525,35" HREF="../../whatsnew/index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="525,0,598,35" HREF="../../dlsw/index.html"></MAP><tr><td valign=left><a href="footer1.map"><img width="598" height="36" border=none src="../../graphics/footer1.gif" usemap="#footer1" ISMAP></a><map name="footer1"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="0,0,166,36" HREF ="../../index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="171,15,297,36" HREF ="../../contacting.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="252,0,385,15" HREF="../../legal.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="490,0,596,36" HREF="../../sitemap.html"></map></table><!-----------------footer-----------------------------></BODY></HTML>

In the infrared spectrum, energy that passes through a lens strikes focal plane arrays (FPAs), complex panels of integrated circuits with photo detectors. FPAs are the "film"; Forward Looking Infrared Sensors (FLIR) are the "camera," and are primarily used to "see" in the dark with computers converting the energy-data into images.<P><I><B>Accurate Imaging</B></I><BR>Accurately processing the data is essential to getting clear, recognizable images. Unfortunately, optical cross-talk, false signals, stray radiation and flaws in even the best lenses can corrupt images. To complicate matters, the FPA structure reflects some light, producing another source of image corrupting data. Charlie Franda and John Zimmerman, at Texas Instruments Defense Systems Electronics Group (TI), are refining FPAs and FLIR imaging to find the sources of flaws and areas of the array which reflect energy.  	<P>Initially, the group's commercial software was incapable of handling the high volume of Fourier-transform Range Simulator (FTRS) test data. Hidden line images did provide a pseudo-3D image of the optical cross section (OCS). However, this method did not produce images with high enough resolution to determine the source of reflections.<P><I><B>IDL Data Handling</B></I><BR>Franda's group used IDL to develop an application which accepts two-dimensional OCS data from the FTRS and represents it in false colors. Running on a Pentium PC with 32 MB of RAM and a 90 MB buffer, TI analyzes focal plane arrays by continuously scanning an array 2500 times in one direction while "slewing" in elevation to create an OCS image. Using IDL to transform the data into 3D images, Franda graphically represents FPAs and can interactively evaluate their performance. <P>IDL provides interactive color tables, ultra-fine zooming, annotation tools, legends, X-Y peak profiles, and the ability to easily export processed images to printers. Franda comments, "We're able to visualize what we're looking at with IDL and interpret the data.  And, we can now manipulate image parameters."  <P><I><B>Intuitive Evaluation of Flaws</B></I><BR>By interpreting the tests, Franda and Zimmerman refine the design of FPAs to reduce reflectivity, trace reflections, or account for the effect of baffles and flaws in lenses and mirrors. "IDL is so powerful because it allows you to do so many different things. The enhanced imaging capability is extremely useful for engineering evaluations," Franda concludes.<P>For now, FLIRs are used almost exclusively by the military, since the cost is prohibitive for civilian uses. Someday, with ongoing development by the team at Texas Instruments, the ability to guide ourselves through darkness will be easier, safer and part of our everyday lives.</table><!-----------------footer-----------------------------><table border=0 cellpadding=0><tr><td colspan=3 valign=left><a href="footer.map"><img width="598" height="36" border=none src="../../graphics/footer.gif" usemap="#footer" ISMAP></a><map name="footer"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="0,0,75,35" HREF="../index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="75,0,150,35" HREF="../../envi/index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="150,0,225,35" HREF="../../vh/index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="225,0,300,35" HREF="../../services/index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="300,0,375,35" HREF="../../index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="375,0,450,35" HREF="../../contacting.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="450,0,525,35" HREF="../../whatsnew/index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="525,0,598,35" HREF="../../dlsw/index.html"></MAP><tr><td valign=left><a href="footer1.map"><img width="598" height="36" border=none src="../../graphics/footer1.gif" usemap="#footer1" ISMAP></a><map name="footer1"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="0,0,166,36" HREF ="../../index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="171,15,297,36" HREF ="../../contacting.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="252,0,385,15" HREF="../../legal.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="490,0,596,36" HREF="../../sitemap.html"></map></table><!-----------------footer-----------------------------></BODY></HTML>

Using test instruments that collect data from billions of miles away, engineers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are keeping alive the quest for understanding how our galaxy was formed. <P>At MIT, Dan Dewey is perfecting energy gratings, crucial elements of the High Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer (HETG) that will be included in the Advanced X-ray Astrophysics Facility (AXAF). Once in orbit, the AXAF telescope, scheduled for launch in 1998, will help scientists determine the temperatures, ionization structures, ionization history, elemental abundance, and velocities of X-ray emitting plasmas.  	<P>Using IDL on Sun workstations  and a Macintosh Quadra 950, Dewey calibrates and verifies each grating's performance. When all 336 gratings are assembled, they form the transmission receptacle of a grazing incidence mirror capable of studying the X-ray properties of stars, galactic nuclei, binary X-ray sources and even super-nova remnants.  About the size of a quarter, each grating facet is 2.5mm x 2.5mm square with approximately 6 cm2 of active grating area, which is composed of 0.5 micron to 0.7 micron thick gold bars. X-rays are defracted by the gratings onto focal plane detector strips. In combination with the detector, the gratings, calibrated for high energy (0.8 - 10 keV) and medium energy (0.4 - 5keV) transmissions, can achieve resolving powers as great as 1000 (E D E), making it possible to distinguish closely spaced X-ray emission lines that arise from hot astrophysical plasmas. <P><I><B>Precise Calibration Tolerance</B></I><BR> A calibration goal of no more than one percent deviation requires highly accurate analysis. Several IDL routines enable Dewey to concentrate on the task at hand, rather than writing complex, low-level code. First, IDL reads a set of Position Sensitive Proportional Counter (PSPC) event files, the calibration routine, and an analysis driver. The PSPC procedure automatically does most of the work by extracting the line order intensities. The results reach an IDL routine which has built-in heuristics to form a file of ratios, then sets weighting factors on the ratios for fitting purposes. Finally, comparisons of the measured data values with the best-fit model values are made. The results are output to a text file of measured and modeled values, and a contour plot of Chi-squared values.<P>This test reveals the gratings' diffraction efficiency and the efficiency ratios of the energies at the source emission lines and in a variety of diffraction orders. When the gratings are calibrated, Dewey can confidently place them in the mirror assembly, sure that X-rays collected from space can be reliably interpreted.<P><I><B>Simulation And Test</B></I><BR>IDL-created data sets with known grating properties are analyzed to verify that the analysis software is operating within the required one percent degree of error. "We do everything in IDL," says Dewey. "The code reads the event file, calibrates it, selects a spatial region, extracts the energy pulse-height distribution, sets up parameters for modeling the lines and continuum, calculates the continuum model, and uses the continuum and line estimates to do a fit to the data." The output is the graphical representation of the data as well as estimates of line location, width, and intensities, and their errors. IDL also communicates with an ORACLE database where test results, instrumentation parameters, and acquired data are stored. <P><I><B>Seeing Deeper Into Space</B></I><BR>In the past, X-ray spectroscopy has been limited to studies of the sun and a few dozen sources which are accessible to earlier, less sensitive satellite instruments. With AXAF, the study of thousands of distant objects will become practical. IDL's support for testing, data processing and visualization gives Dewey the tool to help scientists explore one of the oldest mysteries---how the universe came to be and what makes up the galactic sea of light that illuminates the night sky and triggers the imagination. </table><!-----------------footer-----------------------------><table border=0 cellpadding=0><tr><td colspan=3 valign=left><a href="footer.map"><img width="598" height="36" border=none src="../../graphics/footer.gif" usemap="#footer" ISMAP></a><map name="footer"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="0,0,75,35" HREF="../index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="75,0,150,35" HREF="../../envi/index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="150,0,225,35" HREF="../../vh/index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="225,0,300,35" HREF="../../services/index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="300,0,375,35" HREF="../../index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="375,0,450,35" HREF="../../contacting.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="450,0,525,35" HREF="../../whatsnew/index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="525,0,598,35" HREF="../../dlsw/index.html"></MAP><tr><td valign=left><a href="footer1.map"><img width="598" height="36" border=none src="../../graphics/footer1.gif" usemap="#footer1" ISMAP></a><map name="footer1"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="0,0,166,36" HREF ="../../index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="171,15,297,36" HREF ="../../contacting.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="252,0,385,15" HREF="../../legal.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="490,0,596,36" HREF="../../sitemap.html"></map></table><!-----------------footer-----------------------------></BODY></HTML>

Litton/Itek Optical Systems, based in Lexington, Massachusetts, has overcome the pitfalls of using remotely collected data by developing the Image Simulation Facility (ISF). At the ISF, technicians can physically simulate imaging system performance, and also easily alter image acquisition conditions to produce better results.Ken Riehl and his group at the ISF develop optics prototypes to ensure that customer imaging requirements are met before systems are built.<P><I><B>Critical Tests Use IDL</B></I><BR>IDL plays a crucial role in the  data simulation and testing process. "We're spreading the word that IDL is a powerful and comprehensive tool for image manipulation," says Riehl. <P>Specifications and image acquisition conditions for a proposed system are modeled physically in the ISF. Optics configuration, detector characteristics, atmospheric conditions, and collection geometries are evaluated by physically matching or scaling real-world imaging parameters. "Sensor systems are simulated by matching their optical and focal plane characteristics. Short focal lengths are used in place of actual system lenses and modified to match the modulation transfer function (MTF) of the system being simulated," Riehl explains. <P><I><B>Integrated With Fortran Simulation Code</B></I><BR>Riehl uses IDL on Sun SPARC,  SGI, and VAX workstations in conjunction with in-house software (written in FORTRAN and C) to aid in image characterization and simulation, including statistical analysis and signal-to-noise measurement.<P>The simulation process begins by selecting imagery with the desired characteristics and scene content to satisfy the required conditions. These data are imported into the IDL-based application where, for example, spatial resolution is easily altered with IDL's REBIN function. Imaging system MTF, a key indicator of system sharpness, is simulated in the frequency domain using IDL by multiplying the Fourier transform of the image by a two-dimensional degrading filter. Various atmospheric conditions and sensor characteristics are simulated by adding appropriate amounts of noise.<P><I><B>Intuitive Image Manipulation</B></I><BR>IDL's vast array of mathematical routines for image processing and treatment of images as matrices  fosters intuitive, rapid, and easy  manipulation of image data. System developers are able to write their routines on the fly, saving time and increasing the number of tests the facility is able to complete. Consequently, more systems are built and the ISF can be sure its designs meet customer specifications.<P>Litton/Itek builds some of the most advanced imaging systems in the world. IDL's prototyping capabilities help them efficiently meet specification requirements and remain one of the leaders in optical systems development. </table><!-----------------footer-----------------------------><table border=0 cellpadding=0><tr><td colspan=3 valign=left><a href="footer.map"><img width="598" height="36" border=none src="../../graphics/footer.gif" usemap="#footer" ISMAP></a><map name="footer"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="0,0,75,35" HREF="../index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="75,0,150,35" HREF="../../envi/index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="150,0,225,35" HREF="../../vh/index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="225,0,300,35" HREF="../../services/index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="300,0,375,35" HREF="../../index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="375,0,450,35" HREF="../../contacting.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="450,0,525,35" HREF="../../whatsnew/index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="525,0,598,35" HREF="../../dlsw/index.html"></MAP><tr><td valign=left><a href="footer1.map"><img width="598" height="36" border=none src="../../graphics/footer1.gif" usemap="#footer1" ISMAP></a><map name="footer1"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="0,0,166,36" HREF ="../../index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="171,15,297,36" HREF ="../../contacting.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="252,0,385,15" HREF="../../legal.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="490,0,596,36" HREF="../../sitemap.html"></map></table><!-----------------footer-----------------------------></BODY></HTML>

However, time-series data often contain signals whose frequencies change rapidly. The traditional Fourier spectrogram has been used extensively to display the frequency content of these signal data but can fail to simultaneously provide high time and frequency resolutions. The Wigner distribution, another method of signal analysis developed after Fourier methods, overcomes spectrographic resolution problems but can introduce nonlinear and undesirable effects.<P>Dr. Amir Najmi, of Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory (JHUAPL), has focused on developing optimal processing methods for electromagnetic and acoustic data.  He is primarily interested in using the Wigner distribution as a tool for time-frequency analysis and the detection of signals with rapidly changing frequency content. The challenge has been to develop custom kernel functions in software that attenuate the nonlinear artifacts of the Wigner distribution.<P><I><B>Speed, Efficiency and Control</B></I><BR>Before he went to Johns Hopkins Applied Physics laboratory, Najmi had been involved in developing sophisticated seismic imaging techniques for Shell Oil Company in Houston. He found programming in FORTRAN "quite unsuitable to the work of a researcher who is thinking of new methods that require rapid implementation, testing and evaluation." Najmi continues, "I had basically given up on programming and left it to the professionals because it just was not practical in my work. It took weeks or months to try out new methods, implement, debug the programs and see the results!"<P>Najmi was introduced to IDL by Ray Sterner, an APL colleague and long-time IDL expert. "This was the tool I had been dreaming of. I just took off with IDL," Najmi says. "Once I have an idea, I can quickly prototype that idea and see the results almost instantly. When I am at the IDL prompt, I have complete control of the machine. I even use IDL to monitor and update my home page on the World Wide Web."<P>Najmi runs IDL on a Hewlett-Packard 735 workstation and exports images to a variety of Tektronics printers. In the last three years he has written and tested more than "one hundred thousand lines of code---a task I would not have been able to complete using FORTRAN or C."<P><I><B>Going Beyond Tradition</B></I><BR>To test the new kernel functions, Najmi used experimental ocean current data and digitized recordings of various whale songs. Each species of whale produces different signals that form its "sound fingerprint." These signals provided complex time-series data with rich and rapidly varying frequency content.<P>Processing the collected data using the Wigner distribution and newly- designed kernel functions within IDL, Najmi was able to obtain spectacular imagery and show the functionality and usefulness of the new algorithm. "IDL has allowed me to write programs for designing the kernel functions using the images of the two-dimensional ambiguity function in a completely interactive environment." This has opened up a rapid method of prototyping that Najmi calls "experimental kernel design" which will have far-reaching implications for research beyond looking at whale songs. Medical studies into the effects of drugs on patients' ECGs and EEGs represent just one possibility for advancement. <P>IDL's ability to import and process large data sets and visualize the results gives Najmi confidence that his efforts will not be hampered by software limitations. "In one project I have processed over sixty gigabytes of data entirely within IDL in a very timely fashion."</table><!-----------------footer-----------------------------><table border=0 cellpadding=0><tr><td colspan=3 valign=left><a href="footer.map"><img width="598" height="36" border=none src="../../graphics/footer.gif" usemap="#footer" ISMAP></a><map name="footer"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="0,0,75,35" HREF="../index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="75,0,150,35" HREF="../../envi/index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="150,0,225,35" HREF="../../vh/index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="225,0,300,35" HREF="../../services/index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="300,0,375,35" HREF="../../index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="375,0,450,35" HREF="../../contacting.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="450,0,525,35" HREF="../../whatsnew/index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="525,0,598,35" HREF="../../dlsw/index.html"></MAP><tr><td valign=left><a href="footer1.map"><img width="598" height="36" border=none src="../../graphics/footer1.gif" usemap="#footer1" ISMAP></a><map name="footer1"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="0,0,166,36" HREF ="../../index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="171,15,297,36" HREF ="../../contacting.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="252,0,385,15" HREF="../../legal.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="490,0,596,36" HREF="../../sitemap.html"></map></table><!-----------------footer-----------------------------></BODY></HTML>

In their Flight Testing department, Dornier had been searching for analysis software that processes and provides graphical representation of several types of time-series data recorded during test flights. <P>Using IDL, Dornier developed STAUS, a software environment that includes a custom GUI for analysis, visualization, and processing of data. Developed for DEC workstations, STAUS results are output to devices such as the DECLaser 2000, DEC Printserver 40, CANON CLC 300 and HP Deskjet 1200.<P>To easily visualize complex interactions among numerous parameters, engineers need to define several Y-axes on a graph. Eight different measurements are displayed and compared simultaneously, enabling Dornier engineers to analyze the relationships of performance characteristics such as stress on the aircraft's structure, external air temperature and pressure, maximum takeoff weights, climbing ability, cabin pressure, and temperature.<P><I><B>Presentation Graphics</B></I><BR>In order for the DO328 to meet  registration specifications for the Luftfahrtbundesamt (the German equivalent of the FAA), as well as European and American authorities, Dornier needed to present publication-quality test results to officials. This was easily accomplished using the IDL graphics routines embedded in STAUS.<P>So test engineers don't waste time creating new layouts for data display in different formats, Dornier built a database containing more than 2,000 layouts. After selecting an appropriate layout and importing the data, STAUS users can interactively modify the graphical elements until the chart is defined.<P>This interactive procedure also can be executed automatically using pre-written configuration files, significantly speeding the production process. The files read the ASCII data, access the database of charts, and draw the chart when users select the "grafics" button from the application menu.<P><I><B>Calling External Software</B></I><BR>STAUS allows users to visualize data from external C or FORTRAN programs, enabling Dornier to utilize previous software investments. Data sets are displayed as XY plots, in polar coordinates (with multiple Y-axes), and as 3D bars or "carpet" diagrams. Dornier also uses the data to derive new test parameters.<P>Initially, Dornier developed their user interface with keyboard and mouse I/O routines and windows. Since then, Dornier has built a "point and click" interface using IDL's GUI controls, resulting in fewer user errors during operation of the system. <P><I><B>Safe Flights</B></I><BR>The flight performance programs produce huge data sets, displayed through several IDL applications, in graphical or tabulated form. Results are sent as encapsulated PostScript files to Dornier's graphics department to be included in pilots' flight manuals.

OMICRON's (Taunusstein, Germany) latest control unit for scanning probe microscopy (SPM) is SCALA, a commercially-available hardware/software system based on UNIX workstations. SCALA meets OMICRON's customer needs by combining a modern, user-friendly graphical interface for control and data processing with proven, very high signal-to-noise ratio analog electronics. <P>SCALA's software was written entirely in IDL and has been developed in close collaboration with CREASO, Research Systems' German representative. Dr. Thomas Berghaus, Development Manager at OMICRON, opted for IDL as the only development software for SCALA. "It is essential for a commercial software package that the program code is compact and easy to read. This allows for efficient maintenance," Berghaus remarks. "An open program structure is a must for OMICRON. The program has to be easily extensible and only IDL complies with our strict requirements."<P>The VME bus, an industrial standard for multi-processor systems with excellent real-time processing capabilities, together with a powerful interface between software and hardware, guarantees fast and flexible data transfers with minimum overhead. At the heart of SCALA is a VME board implementation of a SUN SPARC single-board computer which controls the system. On-line display and basic processing is done by the SPARC processor while the connection between the SPARC computer and the hardware control, data acquisition, and buffering are handled by a Real-Time Measurement Controller (RTMC-Motorola 68010).<P><I><B>Powerful Command Interface</B></I><BR>The software component of SCALA combines fast and flexible measurement control with IDL's powerful image and data processing capabilities and supports single-user and network configurations. IDL's flexible tools enabled OMICRON to design a GUI that allows users to execute scans and get results fast. Four GUI modules allow access to various levels of system control: hardware setup, measurement set-up, on-line measurement control with real-time display, and image processing. Employing different SPM scanning heads, as well as starting a new scan, is easy because re-configurations to default settings are achieved with just a few mouse clicks. Dedicated operations can be assigned to selected positions or patterns inside the scan frame, useful in nano-structuring or selective spectroscopy. Customer-designed command routines can be added to fit individual specifications. Complete measurement parameter sets are stored and recalled with simple commands.<P>During the scanning process, incoming data are displayed through user-specified "channels" on the screen in real-time. A measurement control GUI provides an easy way to manage the scanning activities of the instrument and scanning parameters, like gap voltage and feedback. Display modes can be selected individually for each scan in progress and windows can be added, removed, and assigned to other pre-selected channels during the scan.<P><I><B>Real-Time Display and Image Processing</B></I><BR>Apart from features typically associated with image processing, (e.g. smoothing, filtering, background removal, area selection, and zoom)  the OMICRON/IDL application offers users a number of specialized imaging tools. Operators can easily load datasets by clicking on a thumbnail image of measured data.  Also, up to four channels of topographic data can be sampled simultaneously during scanning, and several data sets may be loaded and displayed at the same time to compare results. Image processing routines create new data sets, together with their window representations, for side-by-side comparison of the results of different parameter settings for one routine. A number of pseudo-3D data representation forms allow display of topographic frames in different ways, like single- or multi-colored wire frames, or contour and light-shaded representations.<P><I><B>Image Enhancement</B></I><BR>To gain the most insight into the acquired data, dedicated routines, written in IDL, provide essential image processing. Background removal by plane subtraction, exponential or polynomial surface fitting, and subtraction of mean values per line or column are now  possible, each with a single command. The numerical values of any channel and for any lateral position are available with a single mouse click, and a Fourier transformation may be used for filtering and comparison. Data representations---topographic images, profiles, contour lines, spectroscopy curves, etc.---may be printed using a variety of standard formats (TIFF, GIF, Sun Raster, PICT, and BMP).<P>Dr. Berghaus found the support from CREASO exceptional and chose IDL because of its "powerful commands for time-saving programming and interactivity." Berghaus concludes, "IDL is an internationally marketable standard solution. The decisions to use IDL and work with CREASO were correct. I would do the same again at any time."</table><!-----------------footer-----------------------------><table border=0 cellpadding=0><tr><td colspan=3 valign=left><a href="footer.map"><img width="598" height="36" border=none src="../../graphics/footer.gif" usemap="#footer" ISMAP></a><map name="footer"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="0,0,75,35" HREF="../index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="75,0,150,35" HREF="../../envi/index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="150,0,225,35" HREF="../../vh/index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="225,0,300,35" HREF="../../services/index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="300,0,375,35" HREF="../../index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="375,0,450,35" HREF="../../contacting.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="450,0,525,35" HREF="../../whatsnew/index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="525,0,598,35" HREF="../../dlsw/index.html"></MAP><tr><td valign=left><a href="footer1.map"><img width="598" height="36" border=none src="../../graphics/footer1.gif" usemap="#footer1" ISMAP></a><map name="footer1"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="0,0,166,36" HREF ="../../index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="171,15,297,36" HREF ="../../contacting.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="252,0,385,15" HREF="../../legal.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="490,0,596,36" HREF="../../sitemap.html"></map></table><!-----------------footer-----------------------------></BODY></HTML>

Terry Figel, with the University of California in Santa Barbara, develops graphical user interfaces that make data easily accessible to scientists at the Center for Remote Sensing and Environmental Optics (CRSEO) and to the Sequoia 2000 project.<P><I><B>CRSEO's Task</B></I><BR>The group's mission is collection and analysis of data from space-based sensors and instruments carried on ships for ocean experiments. The ship-based instruments collect data from sixty or more channels and measure parameters such as salinity, conductivity, fluorescence, and light levels at varying wavelengths.<P>To analyze mean values of the parameters, the water vapor and wind speed measurements are retrieved from the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I). The sea surface temperature measurements come from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR).<P>Figel processes data gathered by ships sailing near the coast of Antarctica. The data eventually are read into IDL, running on DEC Alpha machines. Figel created a graphical user interface, with scroll bars controlling the X and Y axes,  that allows scientists to plot the values for each parameter, reverse the axes, call minimum and maximum definitions, and overplot different datasets.<P><I><B>See Trends Using Animations</B></I><BR>After a series of images is saved in the GIF format, Figel uses his custom application to animate the series, which he finds to be a more interesting and elegant way to display data and discover trends and changes. The animation is created by using global pictures in sequential positions to create the illusion of rotation.<P><I><B>Fast Plotting and Visualization Increase Productivity</B></I><BR>Before he used IDL, Figel had to write scripts with interfaces for each plot using Mathematica. This tedious procedure took several minutes for a single plot. With IDL, each plot takes only seconds. Figel recommends IDL because of the built-in mapping capabilities and because scientists need both numerical and visual solutions to their problems.<P>Figel previously used a FORTRAN program but switched to IDL because "there were far too many loops, so IDL was much faster." Figel says, "With custom GUIs built in IDL, scientists can visualize their images easily."</table><!-----------------footer-----------------------------><table border=0 cellpadding=0><tr><td colspan=3 valign=left><a href="footer.map"><img width="598" height="36" border=none src="../../graphics/footer.gif" usemap="#footer" ISMAP></a><map name="footer"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="0,0,75,35" HREF="../index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="75,0,150,35" HREF="../../envi/index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="150,0,225,35" HREF="../../vh/index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="225,0,300,35" HREF="../../services/index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="300,0,375,35" HREF="../../index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="375,0,450,35" HREF="../../contacting.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="450,0,525,35" HREF="../../whatsnew/index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="525,0,598,35" HREF="../../dlsw/index.html"></MAP><tr><td valign=left><a href="footer1.map"><img width="598" height="36" border=none src="../../graphics/footer1.gif" usemap="#footer1" ISMAP></a><map name="footer1"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="0,0,166,36" HREF ="../../index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="171,15,297,36" HREF ="../../contacting.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="252,0,385,15" HREF="../../legal.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="490,0,596,36" HREF="../../sitemap.html"></map></table><!-----------------footer-----------------------------></BODY></HTML>

Another tool developed with IDL marks frontal systems generating weather maps used by the media.<P>A Wide Area Network of 10 Sun SPARCservers and 200 workstations connects the four SMI branches, in Payerne, Geneva, Locarno, and at the Zurich-Kloten Airport. The demands made on the computing centers are extensive, as both 24-hour weather services and the research department vie for limited computing resources. To meet this demand, the SMI searched for a "universal" software development package for the creation of applications across disciplines and departments. IDL was chosen as the central development toolkit because it enabled the SMI to accomplish a variety of tasks, including data processing, visualization, and the rapid creation of intuitive graphical user interfaces for applications.<P><I><B>Flexible Program Linking and Interactive Data Processing</B></I><BR>Many scientists at the SMI play an active role in developing their own software applications. The platform independence of IDL widgets, Remote Procedure Call (RPC) network capabilities, and the possibility of operating complete applications as run-time modules led the SMI scientists to choose IDL. <P>Currently, the most extensive IDL project is the development of a graphical front end for the Computer Aided Forecasting system (CAF). The CAF front end forms a geographical information system (GIS) using IDL's map functions and data from the CIA world map database.<P>The IDL/NEONS (Naval Environmental Operational Nowcasting System) application provides users with an integrated tool for weather service operation and allows selection and display of meteorological data for interactive processing. Other weather services across Europe use NEONS and the data it provides.<P>Users can interactively define regions by drawing boxes around areas of interest on the projected map. According to the size of the selected region, different resolutions for the geographical background information can be applied. Each background element can be enabled or disabled and the colors changed and saved, with other settings, to a user configuration file.<P>The SMI plans to use IDL to automate the generation of various meteorological products. One project involves extracting cloud information from satellite images and overlaying it with the background continent maps, for weathercasts on Swiss television.</table><!-----------------footer-----------------------------><table border=0 cellpadding=0><tr><td colspan=3 valign=left><a href="footer.map"><img width="598" height="36" border=none src="../../graphics/footer.gif" usemap="#footer" ISMAP></a><map name="footer"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="0,0,75,35" HREF="../index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="75,0,150,35" HREF="../../envi/index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="150,0,225,35" HREF="../../vh/index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="225,0,300,35" HREF="../../services/index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="300,0,375,35" HREF="../../index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="375,0,450,35" HREF="../../contacting.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="450,0,525,35" HREF="../../whatsnew/index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="525,0,598,35" HREF="../../dlsw/index.html"></MAP><tr><td valign=left><a href="footer1.map"><img width="598" height="36" border=none src="../../graphics/footer1.gif" usemap="#footer1" ISMAP></a><map name="footer1"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="0,0,166,36" HREF ="../../index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="171,15,297,36" HREF ="../../contacting.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="252,0,385,15" HREF="../../legal.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="490,0,596,36" HREF="../../sitemap.html"></map></table><!-----------------footer-----------------------------></BODY></HTML>

Developed for the Canada Centre for Remote Sensing, RPP will provide valuable information on Canada's agriculture, fishing, wildlife distribution, geology, and forestry. Fast changing environmental phenomena like near-coastal ocean fluctuations and sea-ice formation also are studied.<P>The RPP is a flexible, low repeat-cost, stand-alone research tool that incorporates IDL's extensive display  capabilities with C computational algorithms to provide high-precision, full-resolution processing of signal and image data. Researchers using the RPP save money because SAR satellite data is obtained at a fraction of the cost of aerial data collection missions.<P><I><B>Accurate Images Reveal More </B></I><BR>Precision processing is what the RPP is all about. Accurate analysis enhances the potential for reaping the most knowledge from data. The RPP is a phase-preserving processor. Image quality specifications tolerate a maximum radiometric error of +/- 0.05dB within a scene and impulse response with broadening of less than three percent. These parameters apply for squint angles as wide as eight degrees. <P>The RPP also performs survey processing, quickly producing low-resolution imagery of a full square scene, and scanSAR processing using the Spectral Analysis (SPECAN) algorithm for full-resolution imagery.<P><I><B>One Package Saves Time &amp; Money</B></I><BR>IDL's platform-independent application development tools allowed Array to refine RPP in one environment with confidence that it will run on other platforms without expensive and redundant modifications. The RPP was developed on Sun and Silicon Graphics workstations, and is implemented on a 133 MHz SGI Indy, with 64 MB RAM and three GB of disk storage space. <P><I><B>Flexible Data Handling in IDL Meets Users' Needs</B></I><BR>IDL powers the image processing facilities in RPP. Initially, raw data is assessed for quality and converted to CEOS, HDF, or TIFF formats, according to users' requirements. The RPP performs extensive image analysis to verify that image quality parameters are satisfied. Reports on signal and image data quality, and descriptions of the process, can be produced at any point.<P>The RPP is designed to run in interactive, batch, or debug mode. In interactive mode, users can review the default processing parameters and algorithms to make adjustments while looking at the intermediate results, rather than waiting until the process is complete only to find that the image is inaccurate. RPP displays status and error messages to keep users updated. More detailed system status and diagnostic messages are produced in debug mode. Users can stop processing, alter the parameters, and resume processing. As in the interactive mode, the image display tools then will show the effects on the image. Images are processed "behind the scenes" or, when scheduled, in batch mode.<P>Satellite imaging systems will provide researchers and commercial users with immediate, up-to-date information. Array's Radarsat Precision Processor will pave the way for low-cost, accurate SAR processing.</table><!-----------------footer-----------------------------><table border=0 cellpadding=0><tr><td colspan=3 valign=left><a href="footer.map"><img width="598" height="36" border=none src="../../graphics/footer.gif" usemap="#footer" ISMAP></a><map name="footer"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="0,0,75,35" HREF="../index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="75,0,150,35" HREF="../../envi/index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="150,0,225,35" HREF="../../vh/index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="225,0,300,35" HREF="../../services/index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="300,0,375,35" HREF="../../index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="375,0,450,35" HREF="../../contacting.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="450,0,525,35" HREF="../../whatsnew/index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="525,0,598,35" HREF="../../dlsw/index.html"></MAP><tr><td valign=left><a href="footer1.map"><img width="598" height="36" border=none src="../../graphics/footer1.gif" usemap="#footer1" ISMAP></a><map name="footer1"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="0,0,166,36" HREF ="../../index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="171,15,297,36" HREF ="../../contacting.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="252,0,385,15" HREF="../../legal.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="490,0,596,36" HREF="../../sitemap.html"></map></table><!-----------------footer-----------------------------></BODY></HTML>

A couple of years ago, we would submit simulation jobs to Cray queues and wait three days only to have the model crash in the third step. Now we get our errors in two minutes, fix the problem, and rerun," Denning exclaims. "Using IDL/GeoPlot, we can do short test simulations and see the results instantly."<P>Denning works with a global climate model that simulates the state of the global atmosphere in three dimensions on a six-minute time-step. Using GeoPlot's intuitive interface, Denning has access to hundreds of mega-bytes of binary model output.<P>Prior to developing GeoPlot, each time he looked at a particular variable, Denning wrote custom code, looped through the files until he got to the desired point, then saved the relevant data to a smaller file for analysis or plotting. "We spent way too much time reinventing the wheel, writing custom FORTRAN or C programs. And we had zillions of these little intermediate data products lying around," Denning laments.<P>"Now, I can open a model output file and a menu appears with the names of the hundreds of variables that are present. Click on one and you get a color plot overlaid on a  map of the world. Bring up a second map and you can calculate the difference between the two plots as a third," Denning says.<P>GeoPlot's interface gives users smooth access to contour interval controls, color schemes, and text fields for interactive control and analysis of plot after plot. Users can zoom on tiny geographic areas without the image becoming "grainy." A sequence of plots can be animated to give users a better feel for patterns in the data. Denning concludes, "I get direct, easy-to-interpret feedback on the models and can compare to observations in seconds."<P><I><B>Observation and Simulation in One Computer Environment</B></I><BR>In combination with the model, which uses FORTRAN routines to predict winds, temperatures, and CO2 concentrations at more than 50,000 locations every six minutes, GeoPlot has helped Denning learn that interactions between the "breathing" of terrestrial ecosystems, through photosynthesis and respiration, are responsible for a surprising fraction of the annual mean geographic distribution of atmospheric CO2. This implies that a greater portion of the global uptake of fossil fuel CO2 is accomplished by land plants and soils than previously thought. The work is causing other researchers to rethink some popular ideas about the processes that regulate atmospheric CO2. (For a more complete description of these findings, refer to Nature, July 20, 1995; vol 376, pp 240-243).</table><!-----------------footer-----------------------------><table border=0 cellpadding=0><tr><td colspan=3 valign=left><a href="footer.map"><img width="598" height="36" border=none src="../../graphics/footer.gif" usemap="#footer" ISMAP></a><map name="footer"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="0,0,75,35" HREF="../index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="75,0,150,35" HREF="../../envi/index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="150,0,225,35" HREF="../../vh/index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="225,0,300,35" HREF="../../services/index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="300,0,375,35" HREF="../../index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="375,0,450,35" HREF="../../contacting.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="450,0,525,35" HREF="../../whatsnew/index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="525,0,598,35" HREF="../../dlsw/index.html"></MAP><tr><td valign=left><a href="footer1.map"><img width="598" height="36" border=none src="../../graphics/footer1.gif" usemap="#footer1" ISMAP></a><map name="footer1"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="0,0,166,36" HREF ="../../index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="171,15,297,36" HREF ="../../contacting.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="252,0,385,15" HREF="../../legal.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="490,0,596,36" HREF="../../sitemap.html"></map></table><!-----------------footer-----------------------------></BODY></HTML>

Also, fusion reactions produce none of the long-lived and dangerous waste by-products associated with fission reactions.<P>Fusion is the process during which two hydrogen nuclei, (deuterium and tritium) merge to form a heavier helium nucleus accompanied by the release of an enormous amount of energy. The fusion energy can be converted to electricity through heat exchange devices that drive generator turbines. <P>Research which could make fusion an everyday source of energy is being conducted at General Atomics. Ben Penaflor, an engineer in the Fusion Group, and his team,  have been developing an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) to a sophisticated real-time control system built by fusion scientist John Ferron (Funded by the U.S. Department of Energy under Contract No. DE-AC03-89ER51114). The software GUI, written entirely in IDL from Research Systems, is part of a system that controls plasma produced by an experimental fusion reactor called DIII-D tokamak.<P><I><B>Controlling Fusion</B></I><BR>At General Atomics, fusion physics is studied in the tokamak by creating plasma (ionized gas), with temperatures of more than 200 million degrees celsius, confined in a donut-shaped magnetic "bottle." Learning how to control plasma is an important aspect of fusion research because certain plasma shapes are better for confinement than others. The longer the confinement time, the greater the chance fusion will occur. Extremely strong magnetic fields, generated by high current coils, control the plasma shape. The Plasma Control System monitors the DIII-D tokamak in real time, using feedback control of the magnetic fields to shape and position the plasma. <P>The ability to easily change over 500 operating parameters was a primary system design requirement. In addition, the Plasma Control System required an interface which could simultaneously interact with a number of concurrent processes, enabling Penaflor to send and receive information from various working routines. According to Penaflor, "IDL was more than up to the challenge when it came time to develop a graphical interface for real-time digital control."<P>IDL gave the group the ability to supply a large number of inputs of time-dependent target waveforms that are used in controlling the plasma. "IDL has provided us with the flexibility of being not only a fast, easy to use GUI generator, but also the power of a high-level programming language."<P><I><B>Software Portability Required</B></I><BR>Maintainability and portability to various platforms, advanced plotting capabilities, and the ability to react and respond to other processes were also cited as key features. Other important features in IDL include utilities for performing vector calculations, dealing with structures, and superior product support---all of which IDL and Research Systems deliver. "IDL gives us exactly what we need!" Penaflor remarks.<P><I><B>Future Needs</B></I><BR>The demand for energy will certainly increase in the future. As precious natural resources continue to dwindle, fusion energy becomes more attractive and economically competitive. With the work of Ben Penaflor and his staff at General Atomics, there's a chance that the world will someday have a clean, inexhaustible energy resource.</table><!-----------------footer-----------------------------><table border=0 cellpadding=0><tr><td colspan=3 valign=left><a href="footer.map"><img width="598" height="36" border=none src="../../graphics/footer.gif" usemap="#footer" ISMAP></a><map name="footer"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="0,0,75,35" HREF="../index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="75,0,150,35" HREF="../../envi/index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="150,0,225,35" HREF="../../vh/index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="225,0,300,35" HREF="../../services/index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="300,0,375,35" HREF="../../index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="375,0,450,35" HREF="../../contacting.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="450,0,525,35" HREF="../../whatsnew/index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="525,0,598,35" HREF="../../dlsw/index.html"></MAP><tr><td valign=left><a href="footer1.map"><img width="598" height="36" border=none src="../../graphics/footer1.gif" usemap="#footer1" ISMAP></a><map name="footer1"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="0,0,166,36" HREF ="../../index.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="171,15,297,36" HREF ="../../contacting.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="252,0,385,15" HREF="../../legal.html"><AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="490,0,596,36" HREF="../../sitemap.html"></map></table><!-----------------footer-----------------------------></BODY></HTML>

<b>RESEARCH SYSTEMS ANNOUNCES ENVI V2.6</b> 
<p>
With new release, the industry's leading hyperspectral image processing software becomes more useful to remote sensing 
specialists processing traditional data types such as panchromatic, multispectral and radar. </p>
<p>BOULDER, Colo. -- Research Systems, Inc. (RSI), a developer of multi-platform data analysis software headquartered 
here, today announced that Version 2.6 of its ENVI image processing software will be available in January. </p>
<p>ENVI (the Environment for Visualizing Images) is an image processing application for technical professionals analyzing remote 
sensing data. ENVI includes traditional image processing features as well as advanced radar, spectral analysis, and file 
handling tools for natural resource, environmental, and agricultural remote sensing. ENVI can be used to visualize and analyze 
any type of satellite or aircraft digital imagery, including Landsat, AVIRIS, and ERS-1, among others. </p>
<p>&quot;ENVI has rapidly become the industry standard for hyperspectral image analysis on the strengths of its advanced spectral 
processing tools,&quot; said Denise M. Fields, Research Systems' vice president of sales &amp; marketing. &quot;Each new version adds 
more 'standard' functionality and ENVI now compares very favorably with other mainstream products designed for 
panchromatic, multispectral, and radar data analysis. The big plus with ENVI 2.6, however, is that many of its advanced 
spectral processing tools can be used with traditional data types for improved analysis.&quot; </p>
<p>ENVI Product Manager Fred A. Kruse, Ph.D., added: &quot;Many users are starting to apply ENVI's advanced spectral 
processing tools to data types other than hyperspectral. ENVI 2.6 continues this trend by solidifying ENVI's mainstream 
image processing capabilities and making sure that users of all data types have access to all of the software's advanced 
processing techniques. ENVI is the only image processing package to provide fully integrated spectral tools such as the Pixel 
Purity Index (PPI) and n-Dimensional Visualizer. We are now routinely applying these methods for improved analysis of 
Landsat TM, SPOT XS, and data from advanced SAR systems such as JPL's SIR-C.&quot; </p>
<p>ENVI is written entirely in IDL (<em>Interactive Data Language</em>), Research Systems' fourth-generation language for engineers, 
scientists and programmers building data analysis and data visualization applications. This means users can expand ENVI's 
features or create their own routines using IDL. The language syntax is easy and efficient -- a few lines of IDL code can do 
the job of hundreds of lines of C or FORTRAN, without losing flexibility or performance. </p>
<p>Version 2.6's major new features include: faster program loading resulting from code modularization; improved interface using 
menu bars in all dialogs; support for GeoTIFF data format; interactive mensuration tools for measuring distances; direct file 
reading from CD-ROM and diskette of selected data formats; an enhanced n-D Visualizer, which allows real-time links 
between the visualizer, the image display and the spectral data; and improved on-line help, including several new tutorials. </p>
<p>ENVI 2.6 is available for all popular operating systems: Windows 3.1, Windows 95, Windows NT, Macintosh, native Power 
Macintosh, UNIX, and Linux. Personal computer pricing starts at $3,350 and workstation pricing starts at $5,750*. 
Research Systems was founded by President David Stern in 1977 in Boulder, Colo. The privately-held company supports 
more than 25,000 users worldwide through a direct sales force and network of international distributors. Primary markets for 
the company's products are space physics, medical imaging, engineering test &amp; analysis, and the earth sciences. Additional

<font color=dc6000><H3><a name="Data Mining">Data Mining with ENVI</a></H3></font>
For centuries, miners have combed the earth, hoping to find gold. However, to geologists, the existence of gold and other tell-tale minerals provide insight into the earth's composition, allowing them to identify more accurately areas that contain valuable resources.
<P>
<I><B>Interpreting Geologic Structure</B></I><BR>
Alan Morris, of Barrick Gold Exploration in Nevada, analyzes geologic structure using ENVI software to process Landsat data of North and South America.
<P>
Morris derives information about chemical alteration of minerals in rock beds that occurs by natural means, such as oxidation. This information provides a guide to metals of ecological interest. For instance, if a mineral deposit contains large amounts of iron and sulfur (chemicals in pyrite or "fools gold"), oxidation will result in a red stain on exposed rocks, a detectable surface phenomenon that is visible in the image. 
Morris studies Landsat data that cover seven bands, ranging from the visible through thermal infrared spectra, representing the spectral signatures of sand, water, or dense rock, where patterns of erosion can indicate the geologic composition of the area.
<P>
<I><B>Large Data Handling with ENVI</B></I><BR>
Processing of large datasets requires not only powerful imaging computers, but also software that allows the generation of large-scale images derived from scenes as big as 500 MB, representing areas of 170 x 180 km. Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates are preprocessed by a consultant to provide Morris with a general interpretation of an area.
<P>
Using ENVI on a 60 MHz Gateway PC, Morris matches data to existing USGS maps. By determining land types, he can recognize what types of altered material generally occur by the specific type of alteration halo, or aureole.
<P>
<I><B>Advanced Features Provide Deeper Insight</B></I><BR>
Band ratios in ENVI allow Morris to recognize alteration anomalies that might not be apparent to the naked eye. For example, the hydroxyl absorbance band indicates the presence of hydroxyl ions, (band 7 on Landsat TM data). The band shows clay alteration, which can result from mineralization or secondary oxidation of sulfides.
<P>
Color representations of the band ratios help Morris visually discern different alteration types. In a common band ratio color composite, iron oxide is depicted in blue, clay in red, and silica in green. Altered areas show up as pastel shades, while the unaltered rocks and other features appear as bright colors. Also, Morris uses ENVI for contrast stretching of raw eight-bit scenes. ENVI can stretch the capacity to 256 levels of intensity and brightness, allowing easy image sharpening. Filtering algorithms can adjust the brightness and darkness of adjacent pixels in order to enhance linear trends in the images.
<P>
"Our goal with this system is to give the field geologist another tool to use in evaluating an area," Morris says. "Traditionally, remote sensing has been the province of computer specialists removed from day-to-day fieldwork. With ENVI and fairly simple computers, everyone can use the available Landsat data."</ul>

<IMG SRC="graphics/egg.gif" ALT="Image in ENVI" ALIGN=left WIDTH="308" HEIGHT="252">
With the advent of remote sensing technology, scientists can easily and economically study the earth's surface from afar.
EG&G Energy Measurements of Las Vegas, Nevada, uses ENVI to process remote sensing data that guides environmental clean-up efforts at Department of Energy (DOE) sites, focusing on waste burial, vegetation stress, and ground contaminates.
<P>
<I><B>Economically Processing Disparate Data Types</B></I><BR>
To perform an inquiry into a specific geographical scene, EG&G acquires data from two sources: Daedalus, a multi-spectral sensor flown on DOE aircraft and operated by EG&G; and AVIRIS, (NASA's Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer), a hyperspectral sensor flown on a converted U2. AVIRIS provides scientists with as many as 224 bands of spectral data.
<P>
The sensors simultaneously acquire a series of images in various wavelengths within the infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, concentrating on a ground area as small as 20 square meters.
<P>
<I><B>Spectral Tools for Precise Analysis</B></I><BR>
First, the data are pre-processed by converting the digital results to radiance or reflectance values, which calibrates the data for subsequent analysis. Once the data are converted, users access a spectrum matching routine in ENVI and pull  a sample spectrum from the data for comparison with other spectra within a dataset. This allows analysts to identify stressed vegetation and chemical contaminates that retard vegetation growth.
<P>
<I><B>Image Enhancement Tools Save Time</B></I><BR>
Remote sensing data are enhanced with band ratio and principal components analysis by using ENVI's band math procedure to manipulate wavelength bands and the innovative Linear Spectral Unmixing routine to identify and map ground materials at the sub-pixel level. 
<P>
Originally, EG&G used a PCI package called EASI/PACE, but  switched to ENVI after beta-testing  ENVI for Research Systems. Now, EG&G uses ENVI on a daily basis on Sun workstations.
<P>
According to EG&G, "ENVI has saved us time, and it has great flexibility in handling a variety of datasets."</ul>

Road development in virgin tropical forests encourages farmers and cattle ranchers to settle and use the land. Unfortunately, slash-and-burn deforestation is the easiest method of clearing these regions, and results in the destruction of ecologically vital resources.
<P>
Near the Chamela Biological Station, managed by Mexico's Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM), with funding provided by the U.S. National Science Foundation, Stephanie Serra and Dr. Robert L. Stanford, Jr. have used ENVI to study how slash-and-burn techniques affect the chemical composition of soils.
<P>
<I><B>Easy Comparison of Data With ENVI</B></I><BR>
Serra developed a method for estimating change rates in land use around Chamela. Dry season Landsat MSS images from 1973, 1983, and 1992 allowed her to study deforestation that began following the construction of a highway into the rain forest in the early 1970s. Serra's research efforts will benefit ecologists as well as Mexican residents, who rely on the land for their livelihood.
<P>
The advancement of software technology has expanded researchers' ability to study human effects on land at different scales. Serra identified variations in the spatial area and spectral sensor data between each image. Before changes are calculated, variations are minimized and general land types are distinguished as end members.
<P>
Classification between the different regions in the area poses a  remote sensing challenge. For example, the Landsat resolution can only distinguish between water and land types. Serra needs more specific information, such as where  untouched forest exists versus cleared areas.
<P>
To get to the level of detail she needed, Serra combined her knowledge of the area with an IBM RS/6000 workstation and ENVI software. Once Landsat images were prepared for classification, she used the IsoData function in ENVI to obtain statistical classifications. The variety and flexibility of pre-defined functions in ENVI offered her a range of choices among classification algorithms, allowing her to detect vegetated areas in an image, select and assign color values to differentiate vegetation from cleared areas, and annotate the land types.
<P>
<I><B>Cost-Effective Solution</B></I><BR>
Since Serra didn't receive funding for extensive field work, she relied on ENVI as a cost-effective solution for detecting large-scale changes in the Chamela forest. ENVI has won her confidence; she feels that with preparation and minimal software familiarity, a process that once took three months using a traditional language now takes as little as two weeks with ENVI.

AVIRIS is an acronym for the Airborne Visible InfraRed Imaging Spectrometer.
AVIRIS is a world class instrument in the realm of Earth Remote Sensing. It is a
unique optical sensor that delivers calibrated images of the upwelling spectral radiance in 224 contiguous spectral channels (also called bands) with wavelengths from 400 to 2500 nanometers (nm). The instrument flies aboard a NASA ER-2 airplane (a U2 plane modified for increased performance) at approximately 20 km above sea level, at about 730 km/hr. AVIRIS has flown all across the US, plus Canada and Europe. 
<P>
The science objectives of the AVIRIS project are broad. In a nutshell, the main objective is to identify, measure, and monitor constituents of the Earth's surface and atmosphere based on molecular absorption and particle scattering signatures. Research with AVIRIS is dominantly directed towards understanding processes related to the global environment and climate change.

<font size="2"> Followers of an Egyptian cleric jailed in the  U-S figure in the investigation of a series of letter bombs.         An F-B-I spokesman calls it ''an important lead.''         All eight letter bombs sent to an Arabic newspaper in Washington  and the federal prison in Leavenworth, Kansas, were postmarked from  Alexandria, Egypt.         Three followers of Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman are inmates at Leavenworth.         Abdel-Rahman and nine followers were convicted of conspiring to  bomb the United Nations and other New York City landmarks.         Two of the prisoners at Leavenworth were convicted with the  sheik. The other was found guilty in the World Trade Center  bombing.         Abdel-Rahman is being held at the hospital for federal prisoners  in Springfield, Missouri. He is serving a life prison term.</font>

         singer/songwriter Townes Van Zandt. The 49-year-old died at
         his Nashville home Wednesday night. It's not clear whether
         he had a stroke or a heart attack. No matter how he died, he
         lived and played in Austin. Van Zandt penned hundreds of
         songs, mixing country and blues. The result -- music that is
         simple, powerful, and like the artist,sad. Van Zandt carried
         a pain with him that came out in his music. "</FONT>

         Zandt never saw the big time. Just getting the song out was
         Townes Van Zandt's job. And his admirers say he did that
         better than anyone else. Van Zandt had just returned home
         Wednesday night after having hip surgery when he died.

<p>Our pets are part of our families.  We love them, we cherish them, we do
our best to take care of them.  But do we actually know what we're feeding
them?  In our series, Food Pets Die For we found that it is perfectly legal
for pet food companies to use dead dogs and cats from animal shelters,
roadkill and any kind of mammal in pet food.  The law also allows for the
use of 4-D meat.  This is what the USDA calls cattle that is dead, dying,
disabled or diseased.  The meat is considered unfit for human consumption.
<p>In the same category is cattle condemmed because it is contaminated with
pesticides or antibiotics.  Rather than waste all of that protein, rendering
companies recycle it into products that go back on the market.  All of this
is legal as long as pet food manufacturers use the right definitions on the
label.  They buy meat and bone meal products from rendering companies who
are providing a sort of recycling service.  Dead animals become tallow and
meal products which are used in thousands of houshold products including pet
food.  According to the Pet Food Institute, "pet food manufacturers have
strict controls over their supplies of proteins, from both slaughter houses
and renderers, and only farm animals (the same animals used for human food)
are used in pet foods."  Renderers will sign affadavits promising the meal
products do not include household pets. <p> But a reporter from the
Baltimore City Paper tells a different story.  He visited a rendering plant
as part of a series of stories on waste.  According to his report, dogs and
cats can make up a small percentage of meat and bone meal that is sold to
pet food companies. Roger Hostenbach is the president of the Association of
American Feed Control Officials.  He believes that pet food companies put
out good products although he would not guarantee that there are no
euthanized animals in some pet food products.  Hostenbach explains,  "It
says that it's got meat products in there and if in fact there were any dogs
and cats rendered then there's the possiblity that there could be some in
there." Hostenbach also points out that even if this were common they don't
see any health risks. <P> But is using meat that's unfit for human
consumption actually dangerous for your pet?  Hostenbach says "It's as safe
as any product in the market place."  He says so bcause all diseased meat
must go through a process called rendering.  "It's cooked for an extended
period at a temperature such that if there were any problems with pathogenic
bacteria or other disease entities that hopefully they are all
destroyed."<p>Critics like homeopathic veterinarian Dr. Wil Falconer say
rendering does not destroy the problems.  He points to the recent "Mad Cow"
scare and new discoveries that not every thing dies because you cook it.  "
Can you cook all of the toxic effects of disease out of that body?"  he
asks, "I don't know."  Falconer warns of contaminents like mecury and lead
that could kill your pet.<p>K-EYE sent a bag of randomly chosen dog food to
a lab for analaysis.  We had them check for pesticides and lead and mecury
which are metal contaminants. The lab found no traces of pesticide or mecury
and only minimal amounts of lead.<p>In Texas, the State Chemist regulates
all animal feed, including pet food.  They don't decide what's in there, but
they do make sure that pet food companies are honest about what's on the
label.  The chemists test primarily for vitamins and proteins.  They don't
test for pesticides or other contaminants.  Dr. George Latimer says they
used to, but stopped because they weren't finding anything significant.  He
says they focus instead on looking for problems that are a lot more
prominent and on ensuring pet food labels are accurate.  "The important
thing, it seems to me, is that the consumer should know what the consumer is
getting."<p>And a label will tell you a lot.  It won't say remains of cats,
dogs or diseased livestock are in the food.  But if you don't want to take
the chance, stay away from products that list 'meat and bone meal' as one of
the top five ingredients.  Some vets and breeders say preservatives like
ehtoxyquin may cause cancer.  If a product is using ethoxyquin, the label
should say so.  If you're worried about it, Vitmain 'E' is a healthier
option.<p>Now let's solve the mystery of meat by-products.  The word sounds
scary, but it only means the non-meat parts of an animal -- like lungs and
brain.  The rules say by-products can not include diseased or contaminated
meat. <p>Some pet owners are giving up on the processed food altogether.
Kate Frost makes homemade cat food.  "It only takes 30 seconds and it's
worth it to know I'm feeding them the right stuff."  Her cat has kidney
problems, so Kate makes a special recipe from Dr. Pitcairn's Guide to
Natural Health for Cats and Dogs.  She mixes millet, rice, eggs and alfalfa
sprouts with fresh turkey meat.  Kate even shops at health food stores for
organic meat and produce. Her vet had written off her cat, until she
switched to this homemade food.<P>But you don't have to go that far if you
don't want to.  There are a number of companies who promise they only use
natural and healthy ingredients.  Here are a few who make that claim:
Wysong, Natural Pet, Flint River Ranch.  You can find these in pet and
health food stores across Austin.  <p> Dr. Michael Werner from the Brodie
Animal Hospital warns that all this is not a simple "Buy 'X' diet.  He says
super premium diets are different from store brand diets in consistency of
ingredients and overall quality.  For some pets that doesn't matter, but if
a pet owner notices poor weight gain, skin problems, gastrointestinal
problems then they need to see a vet. <p>What about higher-end foods like
Science Diet and Iams? Dr. Werner has had good experiences with them.  He
also recommends Hill's Prescription Diet, Health Blend, Eukanuba, and
Pro-Plan.  "The bottom line," he says, "is if a pet is doing well on a
specific diet and not having any problems, don't change the diet!"  Check
with your vet if you have aesthetic concerns and don't like the idea that
some companies could be using products made with diseased livestock or
euthanized animals.  Also, look for the AAFCO name on any product.  It
indicates the product has gone through field trial testing.  <p>Scott Click
is from Tomlinson's Feedstore.  He sells the premium brands and says you can
tell the difference between those premium brands and lower-end supermarket
brands in your animal. But foods with a good reputation don't let pet lovers
off the hook.  You still have to check the ingredient list in any brand to
make sure you're comfortable with what your animal is eating.  Click says
you should listen to your pet, "See how well your pet does with it.  Is
their coat shiny? Are they healthy? Are they growing well? Are they getting
too overweight? Determine it with your pet."<p>Remember -- no matter who
makes it, read the label.  Even a great company makes different kinds of
products. So to know what's in there, you have to do the work
yourself.<p><b>FOR MORE INFORMATION</b><p><Em>Ingredient

Three followers of Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman are inmates at Leavenworth.         Abdel-Rahman and nine followers were convicted of conspiring to  bomb the United Nations and other New York City landmarks.         Two of the prisoners at Leavenworth were convicted with the  sheik.

<IMG SRC="./images/fatpill.gif"><P>
   If you tuned in to K-EYE Monday and Tuesday at ten, you saw our series,
"The Fat Pill Feud." When I first started my investigation I was perplexed
at how one pill could cause so much controversy. Everybody seems to want it,
but no one really seems to know much about it.
<BR>     I was leery of any pill that made such big promises for weight loss. I
was skeptical that such a pill was really necessary or safe.
<BR>     I started my investigation by interviewing Dr. Simonia Scumpia, the
obesity expert for Austin Diagnostic Clinic. She confirmed my initial
skepticism but at the same time she convinced me there were people who could
benefit from Redux and a similar drug combination called Fen-Phen.
<BR>     Let me explain what these two drugs are. Redux and Fen-Phen are
appetite suppressing drugs. The scientific name for Redux is dexfenfluramine.
Fen-Phen is actually a combination of two drugs:  fenfluramine ( a sister
drug to dexfenfluramine) and phentermine.
<BR>     How do they work?  Taking Redux or Fen-Phen  stimulates the brain to
release an extra amount of a neuro-transmitter called serotonin.
The release of serotonin is what gives you that physical and emotional sense
of feeling full and content. 
Redux has been approved to use for one year.  Phen-Fen, however, was only
approved to use for three months.
Dr. Scumpia says, "Redux is magic because finally the FDA and medical society
have accepted as fact that obesity is a chronic disease, that requires
treatment."
<BR>     It's magic for people who have a true obesity problem.  People who are
30-percent over their ideal body weight (for example, a woman who is 5'6" and
weighs 165 pounds) or if  you have a weight problem caused by medical
conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, high
cholesterol, heart attacks and so on.
<BR>     Doctors have to be careful to fully evaluate someone before prescribing
Redux. Patients may have a secondary cause of being overweight.  Hormonal
imbalances, low thyroid activity, and adrenal hormones can all cause weight
gain.
<BR>     Nobody has any business being on Redux if they want to lose 10 or 20
pounds.
Side effects include:  Primary Pulmonary Hypertension.  This is a rare but
fatal complication.  In the normal population it strikes only one in one
million people.
Among the obese, it strikes 8 in million people.  
But Among the obese who are also on Redux or Fen-Phen, it strikes up to 28
people.<BR>
In laboratory studies Redux has been shown to cause significant brain damage
in animals.  The FDA clearly states it is not yet known what relevance those
studies have on human beings.<BR>
Scumpia says there's no point in taking the chance of a serious
complication, unless you have a very good reason.  That means, unless you're
obese or are obese and have serious medical problems.
The effects of Redux or Fen-Phen on pregnant women and thier fetuses is unknown.
The FDA and most obesity experts absolutely advise against pregnant women
taking 
either drug.  People with Epilepsy should also avoid it, as studies have
shown it can actually trigger seizures.<BR>
Anyone on anti-depressants should also take note.  If you use Prozac or
Patil, stay away from Redux.  It can cause what's called Seratonin Syndrome,
a highly debilitating condition.  <BR>
Redux, will not, however will not affect anyone taking lithium.
The migraine medication called Imitrex can  also be dangerous to 
Redux users.<BR>
Depression can also be a side effect of Redux.
And anyone, considering either Fen-Phen or Redux, needs to realize that they
can be, highly addictive drugs.<BR>
Mild side effects include: dry mouth, drowsiness, vivid dreams, and short
term memory loss. <BR>
Redux should only be used with a diet and exercise program
And finally, no one should take either drug without a complete physical
evaluation by a doctor.  Doctors should always monitor your progress closely
and check for any signs of complications.<P>

Dan Robertson returns home to Austin after "earning his stripes" during a six-year stint at station KTRE-TV in Lufkin, Texas.  "I'm pleased to be back in my hometown where I have a real feel for the local weather patterns, and what folks want and need to know."  Dan graduated from University of Texas at Austin and is committed to the Austin community.  Having three children of his own, Dan is a favorite to speak about weather to children in schools in Central Texas. <P>
Dan also shows his wry humor "every chance I get" with his co-anchors on K-EYEopener News.  "I love to be the comic relief," he said.  "So often the news is 'gloom and doom' and I get to lighten it up by being the morning bonehead."  Dan and his wife Diane have three boys; Joey, Sam and Matt.<P>

<TR><TD><CENTER><B>Evening Anchor: 6 & 10p K-EYEwitness News</B></CENTER><P>
Neal started in television news more than 30 years ago after earning three communication degrees from University of Texas at Austin.  In addition to his on-camera career, he has taken on the roles of News Director, Assignments Editor and Producer.  Neal won the National Headliners Club highest national award for "consistently outstanding television news coverage in the nation"  (other winners include Ed Murrow and Eric Sevareid) and the nation's top award for radio news reporting from the Society of Professional Journalists (other winners include CBS and David Brinkley).  His involvement in the Austin community is unmatched by any other broadcast journalist. Neal was named Austin's "Most Worthy Citizen"  by the Austin Chamber of Commerce in honor of his three decades of community service.  Neal has served on the Committee for Wild Basin Wilderness and the Board of Directors of the Austin Symphony. <P>
Before Neal's stint as a co-anchor on K-EYEwitness News, he had a successful career creating and running his own communications business, the Neal Spelce Company.  The National Secretaries Association named Neal "Boss of the Year", which is a true indication of Neal's easygoing nature and diplomatic business approach. <P>

<TR><TD><CENTER><B>Weekend Anchor & Reporter: K-EYEwitness News</B></CENTER><P>
Before joining K-EYEwitness news, Will worked as a reporter for KOAT, the ABC station serving the entire state of New Mexico and parts of Colorado.  Will won critical acclaim for his coverage of two controversial tribal votes on the Mescalero Indian reservation in southern New Mexico.    Will was the only reporter allowed to go inside election headquarters and was the first with 'live' results.<P>
Will began his first job in journalism exactly one day after graduating from San Jose State University.  At KBCA, one of two FOX stations in northern California, Will worked as a reporter, producer and an anchor.  "My approach to reporting the news is to focus on the people element - who's affected and why." <P>

<TR><TD><CENTER><B>Evening Sports Anchor : 6 & 10p K-EYEwitness News</B></CENTER><P>
Andy cites his family as the biggest influences in his career, as well as the late Bruce Roberts, a sportscaster with WBBM sports in Chicago.  He atttributes his addiction of local sports to watching Bruce on TV every night as a kid. Andy began his broadcasting career in Abilene as a news and sports anchor, then worked his way around the country anchoring for TV stations in Richmond, Miami, Milwaukee, L.A. and Sacramento before coming to K-EYE.  He covered the Olympic games in the late 1980's.<P>
Andy does not like to think of himself as a celebrity, but more of a regular guy.  "I thrive on the excitment of covering the 'big' game or breaking the 'big story.  I dislike the tabloid sensationalism in local TV news.  I also dislike the following words:  Research, focus groups, consultants and 'Andy, can I see you in my office."<P>

<TR><TD><CENTER><B>Evening Weather: 6 &10p K-EYEwitness News</B></CENTER><P>
While attending Penn State in the 1970's, Cliff began working part-time at a local radio station reporting news.  There was an opening for a weatherman at the radio station's sister TV station and Cliff got the job.  From there he migrated to Corpus Christi before being hired on by WNBC - the flagship of the National Broadcasting Company.  Cliff appeared regularly as the fill-in weatherman on the "Today Show" with Jane Pauley and Tom Brokaw for nearly two years.  "Doing that program was wonderful.  The way things were done set a benchmark for me - a higher standard."  Cliff then worked at the CBS station in Los Angeles (KCBS), where he continued forecasting the weather.  He hated the smog and traffic and after eight years went back to work for NBC in Miami at MTVJ.  Cliff was impressed by Granite Broadcasting, the group that owns K-EYE,  and agreed to come to K-EYE and settle down after years of moving around the country.<P>
Cliff is a sailor at heart and plans to begin sailing again soon.  He is married to Tamara, a woman he refers to as having "beauty, talent and beyond-the-call-of-duty-patience." <P>

<TR><TD><CENTER><B>Anchor, K-EYEopener News</B></CENTER><P>
April may be a new anchor in the morning, but she is a familiar face at 
K-EYE, having done extensive reporting for the evening and weekend news.  She 
has a solid background in radio and television - beginning at the age of six 
when she hosted a children's radio show.  April holds a bachelor's degree in 
Journalism from Emerson College in Boston.  She was born and raised in the 
Cayman Islands and is a pioneer in the development of television and news 
programming there.  "My experience there is invaluable.   The public was 
weaned on CNN and BBC news - and we were expected to compete on that level 
with very little in the way of resources.  Thanks to my time there, I've 
learned quite a bit about flexibility and ingenuity under fire."  April 
has done just about every job there is to do in television - from 
editing and producing to managing.
<P>
She is a strong believer in K-EYE's emphasis on personalizing stories.  "We 
don't just report the facts - we talk to regular people about how the news 
affects them and focus on showing you what it means for your life and family."
<P>
April moved to Austin with her husband Jerry and their son Devon.  They are 
the pround parents of a new baby boy - Ian.<P>

         <PRE>Last year, we hid a hammer,
T'was such a hit we found,
that thousands wished to play again!
(but this year's "gold" is round!)
&nbsp;
The High Tech toys we gave last year,
The value we did double!
For more than twenty thousand bucks,
The hunt is worth your trouble!</PRE>

         and we excluded golf courses. It is, in fact, in Texas,

Have bios on our site,

         three degrees from The University of Texas, which narrows
         the hunt to the City of Austin. We also told you that it is
         not at the Capitol or at any school. Also that it was
         <B><I>NOT in plain sight</I></B> , hence the large boulder
         that covered it. Bios were also available at the "site" of

         <PRE>When seeking gold medallions,
You might stop and ask a farmer,
don't bother with the yankee ones
that live up north of Parmer!
&nbsp;
Sometimes Islands are found west of
where to find our treasure
A Lake named Walter Long lies east,
of where you should take measure.</PRE>
         
         <P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>

         <PRE>From the valley of the sunsets,
Towards Calgary go forth,
But a mountain of shepherds,
Lies too far up north.
&nbsp;
So now you have gotten,
some triangulation,
(This prize should be good
for this much aggravation!)</PRE>
         
         <P>&nbsp;</P>
         
         <P><B>EXPLANATION:</B> If you had a Austin map in front of
         you, you'd note that Sunset Valley is south, Calgary, Canada
         is North but Shepherd Mountain is too far North! Our
         medallion was hidden within that triangle.

         <PRE>It's crowded, needs parking,
And soon bids farewell,
Our medallion is hidden,
In a spot parallel.
&nbsp;
So, too, is the place,
Arthur wooed Guinevere,
And where insects may hide
When there's something to fear.</PRE>
         
         <P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>
         
         <P><B>EXPLANATION:</B> If you take the Austin map and draw a
         line from the Robert Mueller Airport through Camelot
         subdivision and then to Bee Cave, <B><I>where insects
         hide</I></B>, the medallion was hidden in a spot

         <P><B><FONT SIZE=5>CLUE #7</FONT></B></P>
         
         <PRE>Look for the medallion
in a place you'd rather be,
Call for help from co-workers
or even family!
&nbsp;
Remember to search high and low
and of coors, don't mess with Texas,
A treasure is awaiting with the
price tag near a Lexus!</PRE>
         
         <P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>
         
         <P><B>EXPLANATION:</B> This was many clues in one. Most
         importantly, the first letter of every other stanza spelled
         out LCRA, which is located just the other side of the
         bridge. "I'd rather be <U>fishing</U>" is the reference to
         <B><I>the place you'd rather be</I></B>. The reference to
         <B><I>low</I></B> was the Emmett Shelton Bridge, the area's
         first low water bridge. <B><I>Of Coors</I></B>, a
         Colorado-brewed beer was for the Colorado River. <B><I>Don't
         Mess with Texas</I></B> is the campaign developed to protect
         Texas <U>parks</U> and <U>water</U>. The prize is valued at
         $20,042, almost what a Lexus automobile costs.</P>

         <PRE>Colors are important
Red, green, pink and blue
Geography &amp; geometry and
the angles you pursue.
&nbsp;
So navigate quite carefully,
and know your latitude
Don't get angry in your search
and keep a great attitude!</PRE>
         
         <P><B>EXPLANATION:</B> Red was for Redbud Trail, pink was
         for the Granite rock, green was for trees and blue was for
         the water. Know your latitude is a hint for upcoming clue
         #10. and Don't get angry was a word play of "dam."

         <P><B><FONT SIZE=5>CLUE #9</FONT></B></P>
         
         <PRE>A quote from a newsman
about future and heart,
will make a medallion hunter
pretty darn smart.
&nbsp;
After you read it,
you'll go fly a kite,
for this clue should shed,
some true hunting light.</PRE>
         
         <P><B>EXPLANATION:</B> The LCRA has a brochure available
         titled Friends of the Colorado River Foundation that has a
         quote from Walter Cronkite on the front, <I>"The best way to
         see the future was to look into the river and the river that
         runs through the heart of all things Texan is called the
         Colorado"</I>. <B><I>Go fly a kite</I></B> was also a clue
         for newsman Walter Cronkite.

         <P><B><FONT SIZE=5>CLUE #10</FONT></B></P>
         
         <PRE>Numbers play an important role
in where you'll find the prize
like 2-2, 1, 9, 0,
and triple meaning for 5.
&nbsp;
Channel position minus 2
will swiftly point you north
Then a combination of 3 above
will quickly move you forth!</PRE>
         
         <P><B>EXPLANATION:</B> Emmett Shelton was born February 12,
         1905 So all the numbers and the dash were given but not in
         any order, plus <B><I>triple meaning for 5</I></B> referred
         to 1905. Park hours are 5am-10p. 105W for longitude.</P>
         
         <P>The channel position goes back to clue 8, (know your
         latitude) 42 -  2 = 40N and combo of three above105W is the
         longitude and latitude that takes you to the state of
         Colorado, again a reference to the Colorado river.

Cordless Telephones</FONT></CENTER></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=6>C</FONT>ONSUMER
<FONT SIZE=6>R</FONT>EPORTS</B><HR>If you're in the market for a
cordless telephone, good news. Prices are lower than ever. And after
testing the latest models, Consumer Reports says they have fewer
problems than cordless phone owners are used to.</P>

<P>Christie Lucas is ready to buy a new cordless telephone.</P>

<P>"Hold on for a second, I can't hear you."</P>

<P>Her three-year-old cordless just doesn't cut it. Too much static,
and she can't take it far from the base before the signal starts to
cut out.</P>

<P>Those are two problems Consumer Reports looked at when it tested a
dozen new cordless phones priced from $50 to $127.</P>

<P>To check sound quality, testers played a recorded voice over each
cordless phone...</P>

<P>And compared it to the same voice on a regular phone.</P>

<P>They found, the new cordless models are virtually static-free.
</P>

<P>"That's as clear as the corded phone." And, as they have for
years, testers checked each phone for range -- how far you can ke it
from the base before the sound breaks up.</P>

<P>"Right about now I'm getting a little hissing."</P>

<P>Not all of this year's models did very well at that. These two
from G.E. had the shortest range of all the phones tested.</P>

<P>If, like Christie, you're shopping for a cordless, Consumer
Reports says, consider this one by AT & T.; Its model number is 4336,
and it rated highest.</P>

<P>Testers found it has excellent range and sounds as clear as a
regular phone.</P>

<P>And at $50, it's the least expensive of all the phones tested.
</P>

<P>Again, that's the AT & T; model 4336. If you live in a crowded
neighborhood where there are lots of cordless phones, Consumer
Reports says, consider a 25-channel model. The Cobra CP-2500 is a
good choice at just under $80.</P>

<P>In all, three G.E. cordless phones Consumer Reports tested had
short ranges (less than 100 feet outdoors.) The two mentioned above
are models 9535 and 9783. The third, which comes with an answering
machine, is the 9785. Here's how to reach the brands mentioned in the
story: GE (317) 587-3000, AT & T; (800) 222-3111, Cobra (312) 889-3087.
</P>

<P>This story is based on an article in the November 1996 issue of
Consumer Reports, pages 24-28.</P>

<TR><TD><CENTER><B>Anchor: 5p K-EYEwitness News</B></CENTER><P>
Daniel's family has been in the television business ever since the invention of the radio tube.  His grandfather was a pioneer of live radio, his mother one of the first women of television and his father is the White House Correspondent for CBS News to this day.  "It's not that I dreamed of being a famous broadcaster as a little boy," Daniel says, "I didn't have much choice.  For me this isn't just a job, it's always been a part of my life."  Daniel earned his degree in broadcast journalism from  San Diego State University, then started his career with the CBS affiliate in Midland, Texas (KOSA-TV).  From there Daniel worked his way around the country with anchor and reporter jobs in Dallas and Austin, then anchor jobs in Portland, Maine, Omaha, Nebraska and now Austin, Texas. <P>
Like most people, Daniel lives for the weekends.  From ripping up Austin's mountain bike trails to carving up the lakes on wake boards, Daniel grabs "all that God's country has to offer." This also includes an occasional cold beverage at his favorite jazz clubs.  Of all the joys in life, however, Daniel says fatherhood is clearly the greatest joy of them all.  He has a son named Andrew who is "more than any man could ask for."  A son who's already begun his TV career.  Daniel also has five brothers, with four of them being "in the business." <P>

<HR>
Frozen pizza is one of the fastest growing categories of frozen food in grocery stores. Consumer Reports tested to find which is the best tasting and the healthiest.<P>

Here's the last thing you'd think of doing with a pizza just begging to be eaten -- grind it up in a food processor.<P>

But that's the first step Consumer Reports takes to analyze what's actually in frozen pizza.<P>

Testers were spot checking to see how much fat there was, when they found a problem. Some of the pizzas had a lot more fat than they listed on their nutritional labels. One of the worst offenders was healthy choice pepperoni.<P>

"The label claims 5 grams of fat. However, our analysis showed twice that amount."<P>

Healthy Choice's cheese pizza also had nearly twice as much fat as it claimed. Other diet pizzas -- those from Lean Cuisine and Weight Watchers -- were correctly labeled. But when testers checked for taste, the diet pizzas didn't do so well.<P>

In all, the taste testers munched their way through nearly 200 slices of both diet and regular pizza, some pepperoni, some cheese. The tests included big-name brands like Tombstone, Tony's and Totino's. The best tasting turned out to be one called Digiorno rising crust. It tasted close to fresh pizza from a pizzeria. And good news -- Digiorno's cheese pizza doesn't have much more fat than some of the diet pizzas.<P>

If you can't find Digiorno, there are two good choices from Tombstone: special order pepperoni and another special order called four cheeses. Both earned high scores for taste and texture.<P>

At the store you'll also see lots of frozen pizzas made with french bread. But Consumer Reports found when heated, the top-layer of crust turns soggy under the toppings.<P>

Healthy Choice is at (402) 595-6000 and Digiorno is at (847) 646- 2000. This story is based on an article in the January 1997 issue of Consumer Reports, pages 19-23.<P>

<!-- STORY TEXT HERE --!>

Guys, how many times have you wished women came with a manual? Ever notice
how they seem to have the upper hand in a relationship? Perhaps that's
because *they're* the ones with the instruction book. It's called "The
Rules: Time Tested Secrets for Capturing the Heart of Mr. Right. There are
35 rules in all and this week Kris Davis-Jones will be telling us about "The
Rules." Here's some of them.  
<P>
Rule Seven--Don't accept a Saturday night date after Wednesday. <BR>
Rule Two--Don't talk to a man first. <BR>
Some of these rules may seem old-fashioned, but the authors promise this
book is the quickest way down the aisle with a man who absolutely adores you. 
<P>
Everywhere you look women are hunting men. Now they've got a new weapon. On
television and radio, in offices and salons, women are reading the rules. 
<P>
Chrissie reads, "Do everything you possibly can to put your best face
forward. Color gray hair, grow your hair long. Lisa, can you work with me on
this?
<P>
Rule Two--Don't talk to a man first. And when he talks to you, use Rule
19--Don't open up too fast.  
<P>
Lisa says, "I have a list of things I say. I have two kids that fight
constantly, a dog that barks all the time, a psychopathic ex-husband, and
the IRS is after me. The answer I got from Michael is "How tantalizing!".
<P>
It may work for lisa, but the rules say that's a no-no. Be honest but
mysterious. If you want a man, act like you don't. After all, the guys you
*don't* want call constantly, right?  Your grandmother called it "playing
hard to get." Scarlett O'Hara is the ultimate "Rules" girl. Letting *men*
chase her and engaging in what the book calls "busy princessdom". Men, it
says, are hunters that can smell a desperate woman a mile away. Of course
that was the Civil War. Will these "Rules" work in the Nineties? Some women
swear by them, there are even "Rules" support groups in some cities. Other
women say, "No way."
<P>
Ever since Eve tempted Adam with an apple, men have accused women of
manipulating them. Now a controversial new book guarantees women a
successful marriage -- if you're willing to follow a few rules. Kris
Davis-Jones has more on our K*EYEwitness News Extra, Manhunt.
<P>
"The Rules" seem to go against everything women have been taught. For
example, in the workplace, women are told, "If you want to succeed, be
aggressive." but "The Rules" say that go-for-it attitude just won't work in
matters of the heart.
<P>
Rule Five--Don't call him and rarely return his phone calls. 
<P>
Rule Six--Always end phone calls first.
<P>
Bridget Taylor says, "Good morning. I'm Bridget Taylor and here's a look at
your traffic.
<P>
Tough advice for women of the Nineties. Women who are used to taking charge. 
<P>
Bridget says, "Whatever i've been doing hasn't been working. 
<P>
That's why lots of women like Mix 94.7's Bridget Taylor are trying the rules. 
<P>
Rule Seven--Don't accept a Saturday night date after Wednesday. 
<P>
Bridget says, "I really like what it stands for. Having morals and values.
Being your own woman. Always being busy so you're not really needy. 
<P>
Johna Koenig says, "Love should be spontaneous, you should go with your
heart. you should go with your feelings. 
<P>
Johna Koenig says she's done just fine breaking almost every rule in the
book. Koenig believes a successful relationship has more do with who you
date than how you date.
<P>
Johna says, "If you're in a relationship with a man who's self confident.
He's going to appreciate when you do the little extra's for him. 
<P>
However she does agree with Bridget about Rule Eighteen.
<P>
Johna says, "You can't change a man. That's a very good rule.
<P>
Now remember Bridget We went on a date with her and we're going to give you
a how-to lesson in "The Rules" tomorrow.<BR>
If you're married or engaged, you're not off the hook. "The Rules" say you
still need to follow "The Rules." They're less strict for engaged and
marrieds, but the idea is the same. If you stay busy and have an active
life, "The Rules" say he'll be more interested in you, and make an effort to
spend time with you.  
<P>
It's time for the big date. All week Kris Davis-Jones has been showing you
what the rules of dating are all about--that's according to a controversial
book called, The Rules--the rules for catching a man. On K*EYEwitness News Extra, we're going along as a "Rules" girl shows us how
it's done. If you're a guy picking up a "Rules" girl...then the front porch
is all you'll see on the first date. It's just one of the things "Rules"
girls do to keep men curious, and wanting more. 
<P>
Rule Four--Don't go dutch or meet him halfway. <BR>
Most of us might *meet* a man on a lunch date, because it's easier. But "The
Rules" say that's exactly why you shouldn't. So Jay Mahavier's picking up
our rules girl at her apartment. As Bridget Taylor knows, the rule for the
first three dates is easy--all you have to do is show up. Let him pick the
restaurant, open the door, and pull out your chair. 
<P>
Rule Three--Don't stare at men or talk too much.<BR>
Bridget also knows she doesn't have to fill the silences. She keeps the
conversation light. No family talk, and not a lot of detail. 
<P>
Bridget says, "So I just called them and said I am so interested in being in
radio, what can I do? I was 16 and the rest is history? Cheers."
<P>
Rule Eleven--End the date first.<BR>
Bridget says, "I've got so many things to do this afternoon, I'm going to
have to go.
<P>
On this first date, "The Rules" worked. 
<P>
Jay says, "Can I give you a call sometime, if you like? Definitely, sure,
love to. 
<P>
Bridget admits it's a little awkward at first, but says it worked for her
mom and she's hoping it will work for her too.
<P>
How long do you have to act like this on a date according to "The Rules"? 
For the first three. Then you can start opening up more on the fourth date.
The authors say "The Rules" are most important during the first three months
of a relationship. We're still looking for someone who's used "The Rules"
and is engaged or married. If that's you, call <B>Kris Davis-Jones at 490-2196</B>.
Or E-mail me at <A HREF="mailto:davisjones@k-eyetv.com">davisjones@k-eyetv.com</A>.
<P>
All right guys, it's finally your turn. On tonight's K*EYEwitness News Extra
we find out what men think about the manhunt. We're talking about the
manhunt many women are going on after paying a visit to their nearby
bookstore. This book called "The Rules" advocates an old-fashioned approach
to dating. Let the man chase you. Act non-chalant, even disinterested.
There's no denying the women are buying "The Rules" and using them. It's has
been on The New York Times Bestseller List for weeks. But the guys we talked
to say this book needs to stay on the shelves.
<P>
Hockey players are known for breaking the rules.  These Austin Ice Bats say
they want women who will break the rules too. 
<P>
Brett Fizzell says, "I like an more outgoing girl because I'm kind of shy.<BR>
One that'll approach you." <BR>
Kris says, "You don't see that as being too forward and aggressive?" <BR>
Brett says, "No, it's the Nineties."
<P>
Rule Five--Don't call him and rarely return his calls.<BR>
Steve Adams says, "That's brutal. She doesn't call you fine, give her the ax." 
Kris says, "They suggest getting a timer and setting it for ten minutes.
After ten minutes you say, "I've got a million things to do, I've got to go." 
Mark Martello says, "Ten minutes, that's a little anal. What if you got a
nice conversation going?" 
<P>
Rule Thirteen--Don't see him more than twice a week. <BR>
Brett says, "You gotta know when to come back at the guy and say, "Yea I'm
interested." 
<P>
Randy Crow is a 38 year old bachelor. He says "The Rules" send women and men
back into the dark ages. 
<P>
Randy says, "For years, guys have been told no means no and for us to go
backwards and make no mean yes that's really dangerous." 
<P>
Randy calls "The Rules *game playing* and says it's a familiar script with
new actors. 
<P>
Randy says, "You've got the classic example of the guy who treats women bad
and they all love him to death. Let's evolve." 
<P>
So what kind of woman is this bachelor looking for?
<P>
Randy says, "I want them to come up with their own rules." 
<P>
Scene from Gone With the Wind: Rhett!<BR>
Monday we showed you the ultimate rules girl. The guys want to remind us
what happened to Scarlett.<BR>
Scarlett says, "Where will I go what will I do?<BR>
Rhett says, "Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn.
<P>
The authors knew guys would react this way. They say, pay attention to what
a guy does, not what he says. And of course if "The Rules" fail, there's
plenty more advice on the shelves.

<BODY BACKGROUND="c:\windows\Media\Internet

ALIGN="LEFT" SRC="file:///images/solidwaste/greenlogo.gif"></H1>
<P>Our management of resources must change.  <EM>In 1993,
Hoosiers alone
discarded more than 36 million pounds of waste every day.</EM>  A
significant
factor in this dilemma is our reliance on disposable materials. 
Many people
take their wasteful habits for granted.  As waste gets carried
away from our
homes and workplaces, it's easy to forget that the waste must go
somewhere.</P>
<P>The Marshall County Solid Waste Management District is
aggressively pursuing
comprehensive, less-wasteful solid waste management practices. 
These practices
promote the wise use of our natural resources, while continually
reinforcing the
rewards and benefits of Indiana's waste management hierarchy
(reduce, reuse, and
recycle).</P>
<P>The District has several program areas and general information
which you can
learn more about by selecting from the hypertext below:</P>

<H2>MISSION STATEMENT</H2>
<P>Our mission is to achieve voluntary participation in programs
and activities
designed to prevent pollution at the source; and to instill
within the public a
pollution prevention ethic which is consistent with the
protection of human
health and the environment.  To accomplish its mission, the
MCSWMD will:</P>
<UL>
<LI>facilitate public involvement and strive to achieve public
awareness and
support of pollution prevention programs;
</LI>
<LI>develop pollution prevention programs and activities which
will result in
the reduction of pollutants, waste by-products, and the use of
hazardous
materials; and,
</LI>
<LI>facilitate the decrease in the amount and the toxicity of
substances
released into the environment or generated as wastes by promoting
a hierarchy of
source reduction, reuse, and recycling.

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Waste Reduction</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY><CENTER><H1>Waste Reduction</H1></CENTER>
<P>Source reduction is any activity that prevents the creation of
waste at the
point of generation, and is the pinacle of the waste management
hierarchy. 
Reduction prevents waste, while recycling uses existing would-be
waste in place
of virgin materials to manufacture a new product.  Continual
growth and
increased consumption is seen as good for the economy.  We should
be able to
sustain economic growth by making better use of our resources. 
Businesses can
become more competitive and individual consumers more prosperous
by using
resources more effectively and creating less waste.</P>
<P><B>Consumers can.....</B></P>
<UL><LI>Buy in bulk or economy-sized packages.</LI>
<LI>Choose products in refillable instead of single use
bottles.</LI>
<LI>Buy concentrated liquids and mix in refillable
containers.</LI>
<LI>Select products with little or no packaging.</LI>
<LI>Use cloth instead of paper towels, napkins and disposable
diapers.</LI>
<LI>Choose less toxic cleaners, varnishes and paints or decide
not to buy some
items.</LI>
<LI>Use china instead of single use cups, plates and
tableware.</LI></UL>
<P><B>Retailers can.....</B></P>
<UL><LI>Make items available in bulk or concentrated form.</LI>
<LI>Make refillable containers available.</LI>
<LI>Minimize repackaging.</LI></UL>
<P><B>Businesses can.....</B></P>

<H1>Waste Reduction at School</H1>
<UL>
<LI>When buying school supplies, purchase reusable products.  A
solar
calculator, refillable       pen or pencil will last longer than
disposable
supplies and will produce less waste. 
</LI>
<LI>Reuse is a big part of the solution for tackling our waste
problem.  For
example, think of       repairing your shoes, bike or knapsack
rather than
buying new ones.   
</LI>
<LI>Carry a reusable cloth bag when you go shopping to reduce the
number of
plastic and paper bags that are thrown out each year.   
</LI>
<LI>Pack a green lunch at school!  A thermos for hot soups,  a
refillable
beverage container,       and a reusable sandwich container will
reduce the
amount of waste you throw away.  Less       garbage means less
waste going to
landfills. 
</LI>
<LI>Need a new wardrobe for back to school?  Why not swap your
clothes with a
friend or       siblings -- you'll get a new wardrobe and keep
usable clothes
out of the landfill. 
</LI>
<LI>You can help reduce waste by sending the clothes you have
outgrown to a
local charity instead of the landfill.

<CENTER><H1>Plastic</H1></CENTER>
<P>Plastics should be recycled.   Contrary to popular believe, plastics may not
be safe to landfill.  Some landfill leachate has found to contain triethyl
phosphate, dicyclohexyl phthalate and ethyl carbonate, all of which are used as
stabilizers and plasticizers in plastics such as PVC.</P>
<P>The plastic industry has developed coding symbols to identify each catagory
of plastic resin.  These symbols are commonly seen on the bottom of plastic
containers:</P>
<P><B>#1 Polyethylene terephthalate (PET)</B></P>
<P>One of today's most commonly used plastic containers is the 2 liter bottle. 
More than 100 million pounds of these bottles are recycled annually.  PET can be
recycled into:</P>
<UL><LI>Bottle packaging</LI>
<LI>Carpet, filters</LI>
<LI>Textiles and apparel</LI>
<LI>Strapping, twine and rope</LI>
<LI>Scouring pads, tire cord</LI>
<LI>Fiberfill</LI></UL>
<P>PET can also be reprocesses into polyol for automobile bumpers and freezer
insulation, and unsaturated polyester can be used in bathtubs, sinks, boat hulls
and awnings.</P>
<P><B>#2 High-density polyethylene (HDPE)</B></P>
<P>Milk and water jugs, as well as detergent bottles are made from HDPE.  HDPE
can be recycled into:</P>

<P><B>#3 Vinyl (V)</B></P>
<P>Products from vinyl include cooking oil bottles and meat packaging.</P>
<P><B>#4 Low-density polyethylene (LDPE)</B></P>
<P>Plastic grocery and produce sacks as well as plastic bags for products such
as bread, pasta, marshmallows, etc., are commonly made from LDPE.  These bags
are often collected at grocery stores.</P>
<P><B>#5 Polypropylene (PP)</B></P>
<P>Products from PP include shampoo and syrup bottles, straws, margarine tubs,
and yogurt containers.</P>
<P><B>#6 Polystyrene (PS)</B></P>
<P>Often known by the trademark name &quot;Styrofoam&quot;.  Products from PS
include hot beverage cups, fast food clamshell containers, meat trays, and egg
cartons.  Work with suppliers to encourage the use of packaging material  that
can be composted.  See if vendors will take back the styrofoam.  Give excess
packaging Styrofoam to pack-ship facilities, such as  MAIL BOX, Etc. </P>
<P><B>#7 Other</B></P>
<P>All other plastics.</P>
<HR>
<CENTER><H1>Glass, Steel, Aluminum Cans and Foil</H1></CENTER> 
<P>Glass, steel (or &quot;tin&quot;) and aluminum are easy to recognize and
recycle.  It is no longer necessary to remove labels prior to recycling.  Glass
bottles must not be mixed with other types of glass such as windows, light
bulbs, mirrors, glass tableware, Pyrex or auto glass.</P>
<P>The steel industry recycles more than 100 billion pounds of scrap every
year.  An additional  2 billion pounds of scrap are exported.  Recycling steel
has considerable environmental benefits.  Every ton of recycled steel saves
2,500 pounds of iron ore, 1,000 pounds of coal, and 40 pounds of limestone.  For
every pound of steel recycled, 5,450 BTUs of energy are conserved (enough to
light a 60 watt bulb more than 26 hours).</P>
<HR>
<CENTER><H1>Paper</H1></CENTER> 
<P>Most types of paper can be recycled.   Virgin paper pulp prices have soared
in recent years prompting construction of more plants capable of using waste
paper.  Virtually all paper products should be marked with the percentage and
type of recycled content.</P>
<P>Just saying &quot;recycled paper&quot; is not enough.   &quot;Recycled paper&quot;
could mean anything from 100% true recycled paper to 1% re-manufactured ends of
large paper rolls.  &quot;Post-consumer&quot; means the paper that you and I
return to recycling centers.  From a recycling point of view, the more &quot;post-consumer&quot;
paper the better.</P>
<P>Most households get dozens of pieces of mail every month which gets disposed
of immediately.   With the exception of plastic stickers and product samples,
the contents of most junk mail can be recycled including phone books.</P>
<P>Use recycled paper, preferably &quot;unbleached&quot; grey or tan-colored
paper with a high post-consumer content.  Envelopes with glassine windows, or no
windows, are preferred.  If you don't want junk mail from organizations you have
never heard of, you can easily have your name taken off most lists. For more

<HR>
<CENTER><H1>Cardboard</H1></CENTER> 
<P>Cardboard has a market price well above other types of paper.  Supermarkets
or other high volume business will often accept your boxes.  Cardboard should be
free of tape.</P>
<HR>
<CENTER><H1>Paper that can't be recycled</H1></CENTER> 
<P>Paper that can't be recycled includes: food contaminated paper, waxed paper,
waxed cardboard milk &amp; juice containers, oil soaked paper, carbon paper,
sanitary products or tissues, stickers and plastic laminated paper such as fast
food wrappers, juice boxes, and pet food bags.  Paper with any sort of
contamination or plastic layers can't be recycled.</P>

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Other Recyclables</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY><CENTER><H1>OTHER RECYCLABLE MATERIALS</H1></CENTER>
<P>When people think about recycling, they usually think about conventional
materials (i.e., aluminum, steel, glass, paper and plastics).  However, there
are other commonly used materials that can be recycled as well.</P>
<HR>
<CENTER><H2>Computer Printer Cartridges</H2></CENTER> 
<P>Laser printer cartridges are easily recycled, refilled or re-built.  All
packages of printer cartridges should include information for the consumer on
how to return the cartridge to a recycler capable of handling the specific brand
of cartridge.  Some companies, such as  Hewlett-Packard, include a postage paid
return label with each cartridge.</P>
<P>Ink jet printer cartridges are typically not designed to be refilled, but
they should be.  Cartridges can typically be refilled 4-5 times before suffering
from clogged or damaged pores.  
</P>
<P>Several companies exist to recycle or refill laser and ink jet printer
cartridges.  You can get a list by using a net search system such as
<A HREF="http://www2.infoseek.com">InfoSeek</A> -- use key words like &quot;<EM>recycle
refill +laser-printer-cartridges</EM>&quot;. Examples are
<A HREF="http://www.toners.com/welcome.html">
Environmental Laser</A>, a Native American owned cartridge re-manufacturer, and
<A HREF="http://www.awod.com/gallery/business/comtek">
Jetpack</A>, which will refill ink jet cartridges by mail. 
</P>
<P>A rapidly increasing percentage of our nation's paper is used inside
computer printers.  Businesses should consider printers that print on both sides
of a sheet.  Individuals should ask that economical printers be manufactured
that use both sides of a sheet of paper. 
</P>
<P>Uniform clean white paper from computer printers is among the most valuable
type of recycled paper.  Very high quality recycled paper for use in printers is
readily available: due to the finer grain of recycled paper, the print quality
is often better than with virgin paper.  Purchase only recycled printer paper. 

</P>
<HR>
<CENTER><H2>Computer floppy disks / unsold computer software</H2></CENTER> 
<P>GreenDisk, Inc. of Redmond Washington now recycles computer floppy disks in
several ways.  Unsold and returned software is disassembled and separated into
paper, plastic and disks.  The disks, with are basically brand new, are erased,
formatted,  tested, labeled, and resold as GreenDisk Recycled Diskettes. 
Individuals and companies may also send old or defective disks directly to the
company which will shred the disks and recycle the plastic and any metal. For
more information, link to <A HREF="http://imagelinc.com/greendisk/">
GreenDisk, Inc.</A>.  
</P>
<HR>
<CENTER><H2>Smoke Detectors</H2></CENTER> 
<P>The most common type of smoke detector contains a small amount of
radioactive material.  All detectors must, by law, be labeled as to radioactive
content and include an address or phone number for disposal.  You may need to
look carefully inside or on the plastic case for the instructions.  If the
instructions are missing or out of date, look at a similar model in a store. 
Even if the new detector is of a different brand, the company should be able to
help you properly dispose of the old detector.  
</P>
<HR>
<CENTER><H2>Leftover Paint</H2></CENTER>     
<P>Energy can be recovered from used paint by separating and burning the
solvents, and the residual solid 'filler' can also be recycled  into new paint.
Some manufactureres have gone a stage further, offering surface coatings that
are simply blends of similar types of recovered post-consumer paint.  These can
be used in applications where color consistency is less critical as, for
example, a primer coat for drywall.

<CENTER><H2>Disposable single use cameras</H2></CENTER> 
<P>Recent studies have show that, despite the recycling claims on the side, a
dismally low percentage of disposable cameras are ever actually recycled. 
Enough cameras have been tossed to circle the planet, stacked end-to-end.  Local
film developers often have little or no  incentive to return the camera bodies
to the manufacturers, and not all parts of the cameras are recyclable.  Kodak
has started to reimburse developers for the costs of sorting, storing and
shipping, but processors are still faced with a bewildering variety of types of
cameras and procedures for dealing with them. 
</P>
<P>Inexpensive fully-automatic 35mm cameras can be purchased for about $20 if
you look hard.  These cameras will give better results and cost less to use than
the disposables.  If you must use a disposable camera, be sure to take it to a
developer that explicitly promises to recycle the remains.

<BODY><CENTER><H1>Household Hazardous Waste</H1></CENTER>
<P>
 Approximately ____ households in Marshall county generate more than _____ tons
of solid waste each year, most of which is disposed in solid waste landfills. 
Approximately 0.3 - 0.5 percent of that waste may be hazardous to human health
or the environment.  In addition, an unknown quantity of household hazardous
waste is improperly disposed of by pouring into storm drains, dumping on the
ground, etc.  A mission of the Marshall County Solid Waste Management District
(MCSWMD) is to instill within the public a pollution prevention ethic which is
consistent with the protection of human health and the environment.  While
hazardous waste generated by households is exempt from many environmental
regulations, the issue of how best to properly manage household hazardous
products and reduce waste is of growing concern.  Household hazardous wastes of
concern are unused or contaminated consumer products such as paints, stains, and
varnishes; cleaners; pesticides, fungicides, and herbicides; solvents; used
motor oil and other automotive fluids; and, spent household batteries.</P>
<P> Once a consumer no longer has a need for the product, then it becomes a
waste.  The EPA definition of household hazardous waste, is as follows: HHW is
A. generated by individuals on the premises of a residence for individuals and
composed primarily of materials found in the wastes generated by consumers in
their homes, and B. Listed as hazardous waste in 40 CFR, Parts 261.33 (e) or
(f), or hazardous by characteristic of ignitability, corrosivity, reactivity,
and/or extraction procedure toxicity.</P>
<HR>
<CENTER><H2>RECOMMENDATIONS</H2></CENTER>
<P>Alternative cleaning products are available that do not contain the highly
toxic chemicals that clean instantly, but in the process, exact a  toll on the
health of the user and the safety of the environment in which we  live and
breathe.  Americans are regularly exposed to over 70,000 chemicals.   The cost
is, literally, immeasurable, and is currently reflected in medical expenses,
health insurance costs and worker compensation claims.</P>
<P>
Consumer-oriented materials should educate buyers on the environmental effects
of hazardous household products and the importance of purchasing only the
quantity needed.  If disposal is required then emphasis should be placed on the
most environmentally appropriate method.</P>
<P>
Follow the waste management hierarchy: Purchase only what is needed, and use up
all of the product to avoid the need for recycling or disposal.  Collection and
disposal of HHW items should be limited to those items that cannot be donated,
recycled, or recovered.  These items include banned pesticides, oil-based paints
and paints containing heavy metals, wood preservatives, dioxins, and pool
chemicals.</P>
<P>
The MCSWMD promotes and supports private sector efforts by retailers,
manufacturers, and other stakeholders for proper recycling or energy recovery of
certain items, such as motor oil, antifreeze, brake fluid, oil filters, latex
paint, solvents, paint thinners, strippers, non-alkaline household batteries,
fluorescent light bulbs, and thermometers.</P>
<HR>
<CENTER><H2>Household toxics</H2></CENTER> 
<P>We use many potentially toxic chemicals in our homes: bug sprays, snail
bait, paints, stains, antifreeze, oils, solvent and many others. These items
should not be dumped into the regular garbage.  Water seeps through landfills
and the toxics may end up in the water table.   The best thing to do is use what
you buy, buy only what you need.  If you have accumulated toxics, check with the
solid waste management district for the next household hazardous waste
collection day and location.

<LI>Determine if cleaning is necessary.  In some cases, the substrate is clean
enough to paint without additional cleaning.
</LI>
<LI>Avoid using materials with protective coatings that must be removed prior
to painting, such as preservatives used to protect products while in storage
(i.e., oils, grease, and silicone).  Vendors often ship materials with
protective coatings.  Work with these vendors to reduce the use of such
coatings. In some instances, materials that require painting can be replaced
with color-matched injection molding.</LI></UL>

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Motor Oil / Antifreeze</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY><CENTER><H1>Motor Oil</H1></CENTER>
<P>Approximately 1.2 billion gallons of used motor oil are generated annually. 
Used motor oil contains heavy metals and other toxic substances, and is
considered hazardous waste.  One gallon of used oil can contaminate a million
gallons of groundwater!  Oil is a non-renewable resource which never wears out,
it just gets dirty.  About 67 gallons of crude oil are needed to produce one
gallon of refind oil.  By comparison, 2 gallons of used motor oil can produce
one gallon of re-refined oil.  Used oil can be environmentally safe to burn as
fuel in most industrial and commercial boilers that have been equipped with the
proper pollution control equipment.  Used oil can also be used to fuel asphalt,
cement, and lime kilns.</P>
<P><IMG

<EM>Motor oil must never be dumped in storm drains; storm drains  flow
untreated into rivers, lakes or oceans.</EM>  Never mix anything with used motor
oil, and never place used oil in a container that has contained other chemicals.

</P>
<HR>
<CENTER><H1>Recycling Oil</H1></CENTER>
<P>Recycling used motor oil is easy. Typically you must put used oil into a
clean plastic milk jug or into the containers your new oil came from and clearly
mark it &quot;used motor oil.&quot;  The following businesses in Marshall County
will accept your used oil.  Please call before bringing in oil and drop off oil
during regular business hours only:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Tractor Supply Company - Plymouth</LI>
<LI>Oliver Ford Lincoln-Mercury - Plymouth (up to 3 gallons)</LI>
<LI>Martin Chevrolet - Plymouth &amp; Bremen</LI>
<LI>Tatich's T.M.T. Automotive - Bremen</LI>
<LI>WalMart Express Lube - Plymouth</LI></UL>
<P>Some states have laws requiring any business that sells oil to take used oil
back from consumers.  Many auto stores and quick-lube shops take oil (the
industry association encourages it).  Nationwide, Jiffy Lube, Valvoline Instant
Oil Change Centers, Pep-Boys and Wal-Mart Express Lube will accept used oil.</P>
<P>Call <STRONG>1-800-MOTOR OIL</STRONG> for the location of the nearest

<HR>
<CENTER><H1>Antifreeze</H1></CENTER>
<P>Antifreeze contaminates motor oil - do not mix the two.  Try purchasing the
newer, non-toxic, antifreeze.  In Marshall County, you can dispose of your old
antifreeze at the annual Household Hazadous Waste Collection Day, usually held
in the late spring or early summer in the Plymouth High School parking lot.

<BODY><IMG
SRC="c|/windows/media/internet%20art/buttons/duracell" ALIGN="BOTTOM">
<CENTER><H1>Household (Dry-cell) Batteries</H1></CENTER>
<P>Household batteries contain metals such as: mercury, cadmium, lead, lithium,
manganese dioxide, silver, copper, nickel and zinc.  All of these metals pose
significant environmental and health hazards.  When  burned, these batteries
release pollutant into the air, and the resulting ash can be highly toxic.  When
landfilled, these pollutants can contaminate our groundwater.</P>
<P>Discarded or burned household batteries represent less than 1% by weight of
our trash, however, they account for over half of all cadmium and most of all
mercury found in the environment.  Mercury is highly toxic to people, wildlife,
and the environment.  Health risks associated with mercury include kidney damage
and genetic, neurological, and psychological disorders.  Cadmium is a known
carcinogen and is poisonous when ingested or inhaled.</P>
<P>Recycling household batteries keeps metals out of the environment, while
reducing our exposure to these metals and reclaiming a valuable resource.  All
household batteries can be recycled.  The metals in these batteries can be
reclaimed and used in other products.  Alkaline batteries are the most common
and include AA, AAA, AAAA, C, D, N, 9 volt, and lantern type batteries.  In
spite of recent reductions in mercury content, alkaline batteries still
contribute a significant amount of mercury in the waste stream.</P>
<P>Button batteries are so-called because of their size and shape.  Mercuric
oxide and silver oxide are the primary components.  Button Cells are
increasingly targeted for recycling because of the value of recoverable
materials, the hazard to the environment, and the small size and easy handling
relative to other battery types.  If you have your watch batteries replaced, be
sure to ask if the battery will be recycled.</P>
<P>Rechargeable batteries can be used as many as 25 times or more, but they do
eventually wear out.  These batteries can be recycled with your household
batteries.  The new rechargeable alkaline batteries have the advantage that they
contain no cadmium, which is a drawback to nickel-cadmium rechargeables.</P>
<P>Nickel-Cadmium rechargeable batteries (&quot;NiCads&quot;) contain Cadmium,
a metal toxic even in small quantities.  These batteries are commonly used in
portable telephones and video tape recorders. These batteries should not be
disposed of with the normal trash. While using such batteries is better overall
for the environment than disposables, the metals should not end up in  landfills
when these batteries die.</P> 
<HR>
<CENTER><H1>Recycling (Dry-cell) Batteries</H1></CENTER>
<P>In Marshall County, you can drop off your used dry-cell batteries for
recycling at any one of the following convenient locations:</P>
<UL><LI>Radio Shack - Plymouth, Bremen, or Argos</LI>
<LI>WalMart - Plymouth (at the service counter)</LI>
<LI>K-Mart - Plymouth (at the camera/film service counter)</LI>
<LI>Culver Hardware - Culver (at the service counter)</LI>
<LI>Hall's Hardware - LaPaz (at the service counter)</LI>
<LI>Marshall Co. Solid Waste District office - Plymouth</LI></UL>
<P>Stores &amp; watch repair shops can purchase collection containers from
MERECO of Albany, NY.  When filled, these plastic-lined containers are returned
to the company which pays for the quantity of Silver or Mercury Oxide batteries,
and charges for the quantity of Lithium or Zinc-Air cells.</P>
<P>The Rechargeable Battery Recycling Corporation (RBRC) is an industry funded
group promoting battery recycling.  Manufacturers pay a fee to support the costs
of the eventual collection of the batteries they sell. RBRC is starting a
program to place collection boxes at retail outlets nationwide. 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>For the location of the nearest drop-off location call
<STRONG>1-800-8BATTERY</STRONG>.  You'll need to enter the name of a
manufacturer that supports the RBRC in order to get any information, even though
the RBRC accepts batteries of any origin.</LI>
<LI>Chances are there won't be a store near you.  You can also mail batteries
directly to the recycling contractor.  Note! -- the contractor has received a
large number of batteries of the wrong types.  Please send ONLY spent
rechargeable NiCad batteries. Place the batteries in a Zip-Lock type plastic
bag, place in a padded envelope, and mail third class, fourth class, or UPS
ground to:
<EM>RBRC, C/O INMETCO, 245 Portersville Road, Ellwood City, PA 16117</EM>.

<HR>
<CENTER><H1>Automotive (Lead-Acid) Batteries</H1></CENTER> 
<P>According to the U.S. EPA, two thirds of all lead in municipal solid waste
comes from automotive batteries.  An average battery weighs 36 pounds, half of
which is recoverable lead that can be easily recycled.  The 1990 Indiana General
Assembly adopted a law that requires retailers to accept used batteries for
every new one sold.  The returned batteries must be sent  to a reclamation
center for recycling.  Some stores such as the Plymouth K-mart and WalMart will
provide a refund even without a battery purchase.</P>

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Yard Waste</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY><CENTER><H1>Yard Waste</H1></CENTER>
<P>Yard waste such as grass clippings, leaves and tree prunings are estimated
to comprise approximately 20% by weight of the municipal waste stream.  During
the growing season, yard waste can amount to 50% or more of the residential
waste stream.  Yard waste not only takes up valuable landfill space, but it also
contributes to landfill gas production, acidic leachate production and settling
problems as well.  Keeping yard waste out of the garbage truck saves money,
protects the environment and returns a valuable natural resource to the soil.</P>
<P>Source reduction is an important component of a comprehensive yard waste
management  strategy.  Source reduction of yard waste benefits both the resident
grounds-keeper and the waste hauler.  The benefits for the grounds-keeper
include reduced time required to bag waste, cost of the bags and significant
improvement in the health and appearance of the soil and the landscape.  The
resident may also pay less for waste disposal.  The waste hauler benefits by
increased economies of the collection operation and by reducing the amount of
material which must go to a final disposal site.</P>
<P>People generally bag grass clippings because they believe that it will
result in a more attractive and healthier lawn.  Lawn care experts recommend
simple changes in mowing and fertilizing practices which result in a attractive
and healthy lawn while also saving the grounds-keeper time and money.  Grass
clippings and leaves are ideal as mulch for weed control, while broken or
chipped wood can be utilized as mulch for the garden, playground, pathways, or
landscape cover.  </P>
<P>Yard waste can also be incorporated directly into the soil and allowed to
decompose naturally.  Besides the Solid Waste District, the local soil
conservation service, soil and water conservation district and the cooperative
extension office are excellent sources of technical information.</P>
<HR>
<CENTER><H1>Compost</H1></CENTER> 
<P>Composting is the aerobic, biological decomposition of organic materials
under controlled conditions.  The composting process can reduce material volume
by as much as 80%, and turns organic waste into beneficial compost and humus. 
Composting destroys pathogens and weed seeds.  When added to the soil, compost
improves soil quality because it increases the soil's water holding capacity,
decreases compaction potential, increases permeability and reduces erosion
potential.  Compost also provides nutrients in an organic form, which are made
available to the plants throughout the growing season.</P>
<P>Backyard composting offers an excellent opportunity to reduce the amount of
yard waste.  A small composter can accept and decompose a significant part of
the yard waste as well as other  organic waste from the home.  </P>
<P>Compost is just recycled plant matter.  Food and yard scraps placed in a
special bin are converted into valuable garden soil in a matter of weeks. 
Compost bins are available at garden stores &amp; nurseries. Composting can
easily reduce by half the volume of material an average household sends to a
landfill.  For more information, try visiting the

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Waste Tires</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY><CENTER><H1>Waste Tires</H1></CENTER>
<P>Improper disposal of tires affects our health, the environment, and our
waste management costs.  Proper waste tire management: eliminates whole tires
from being buried in landfills, eliminates tire stockpiles that trap water and
provide ideal habitat for disease carrying mosquitos and rodents; reduces the
risk of uncontrolled tire fires and related hazards and provides raw material
for scap tire markets.</P>
<P>The Indiana General Assembly has passed several laws to foster proper tire
managment and protect residents from improper tire disposal hazards.  As of July
1, 1995, whole tires may not be disposed of in Indiana landfills.  Anyone that
transports, processes and/or stores scrap tires must register with the Indiana
Department of Environmental Management.</P>
<P>The legislation also created a 25 cent fee on each new tire sold in Indiana.
 This funding is split between two state agencies for new tire managment
programs.  IDEM programs educate  tire dealers and users about proper management
methods, decrease illegal dumping through enforcement and clean up harmful waste
tire dumps.  The Department of Commerce's tire recycling market developement
program promotes the reuse and recycling of tires.</P>
<HR>
<CENTER><H1>Reusing and Recycling Tires</H1></CENTER>
<P>Retreading bonds a new tread to a worn tire.  The process is frequently done
on truck, off-road vehicle and farm tires as a less costly alternative to
replacement tires.  The price of a retread tire can be 50-70% less than the cost
of a new one, and with proper care should last just as long.</P>
<P>Waste tires can be recycled as whole or split tires or as crumb (ground)
rubber.  Whole tire can be used as a part of playground equipement.  Split tire
uses include floor mats, belts and dock bumpers.  Crumb rubber is the fastest
growing market for scrap tires.  Crumb rubber uses include rubber and plastic
products such as floor mats, carpet, shoe soles, padding, athletic surfaces,
alternative-energy fuel, and rubberized asphalt. Adding rubber to asphalt
greatly enhances the material's temperature resistance.  Asphalt-rubber
compounds can also be used as a crack and joint filler.</P>
<P>The Marshall County Solid Waste Management District sponsors an annual waste
tire amnesty day where residents may bring in up to 12 tires for no charge,
which we in turn will recycle.  The event is usually held in the late summer.</P>

<CENTER><H1>Welcome to the Imaging Radar<BR>Bulletin Boards!</H1></CENTER>
The JPL bulletin boards have been set up as forums for questions or comments pertaining to any aspect of the JPL Remote Sensing program (data, software, methodology, education...).  If you feel hesitant about submitting your question or comment, note that you are not required to leave your name when you make a submission to a bulletin board. 
<P>There a two bulletin boards to which you can direct your input.  The EDUCATION BB is for items that pertain to our imaging radar education program.  The TECHNICAL BB is for everything else.
<P>Our intention is not to be the only ones supplying the responses!  This bulletin board is for everyone, so feel free to add your thoughts (within decent limits, of course).
<p>For newcomers and the curious, here are some simple 
<a href="bbhelp.html">bulletin board instructions</a>.
If reading instructions is not what you were put on earth to do, then you'll be glad that the bulletin board is simple to use and self-explanatory (at least we think so).</P>
<P><STRONG>IMPORTANT:</STRONG>  This bulletin board makes use of fill-out-forms, so you must have a browser that will support this feature.

<p>Here is the latest about the launch of ERS-2:</p>
<p>Check the <a href="http://services.esrin.esa.it/specers2.htm"> ERS-2
Home Page </a> periodically for updates</p>
<p><strong>Launch date of ERS-2 confirmed</strong>. ERS-1 and ERS-2 to perform tandem
mission 
     The launch of ERS-2, ESA's second remote sensing satellite, is
now scheduled for the night
     of 20 to 21 April 1995, at 10:44 p.m. Kourou time, (01:44 a.m.
GMT, 03:44 a.m. Paris time)
     by the Ariane launcher ( there will be further launch
opportunities the following night and the
     night of 23 to 24 April). 
</p><p>
     The launch of ERS-2 will at the same time open a new era of Earth
observation by radar: the
     ESA Council decided on 22 March 1995 to operate ERS-2 in tandem
with ERS-1, which was
     launched in 1991. This joint operations of two radar satellites
is eagerly awaited by several
     hundred sientists, as only two satellites on well-tuned orbits
allow the fully exploit the
     potential of SAR interferometry. SAR interferometry is a method
to map the Earth's surface
     with extreme accuracy. 
</p><p>

     SAR interferometry is already used for observing earthquakes and
monitoring volcanic areas.
     The ERS tandem mission will improve the accuracy of these
investigations and, equally
     important, establish the database for a highly precise, digital,
three-dimensional map of the
     Earth's continental surface. Establishing such a global digital
terrain model with conventional
     methods would be impossible.

<li>First of all, I assume that you are using a forms-capable

<li>You can use AND and OR to narrow down what you are searching for.
For instance, if I typed in :
<b>seasat or SIR-C and death and valley
</b>,
a list from an index of all documents or images that have "seasat" or
"sir-c", and the words "death" and "valley" 
either in the name of the document or in the document itself would
be displayed. The search is case <b>IN</b>sensitive, and is limited to
40 items.  Each item is given a score, the 40 highest scoring items will
be on the list. </li>
<p></p>
<li>I have to re-index the home page everytime something is added.

<p>
I work at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California in the
Radar Science and Engineering Section.  More specifically, I work in
Anthony Freeman's calibration and system studies group, where, among
other things, we are engaged in various radar calibration
activities for SIR-C, J-ERS-1, and Radarsat.  We are now gearing up for
<a href="/amazon/">JAMMS, the JERS-1 Amazon Multi-season Mapping Study, </a>
data collection for
which will begin September 27, 1995. </p> 
</p>
<p>Recently, the home page was featured (front page article!) at the
Pasadena Star-News (Aug 4, 1995).  The home page was also 3rd in
balloting for NASA cool site of the year (1995).</p>
<p>I was born in San
Francisco, and attended high school in Scottsdale Arizona.  I obtained my AB degree at
UC Berkeley in physics and astronomy in 1981, and my PhD in Planetary
Science at MIT in 1986.  Since then, I have been working here at JPL.

<h1>What 
<em>is</em> Imaging
Radar ?</h1>
<p></p>
<h2>by Tony Freeman, Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory</h2>
<p></p><p></p>
<b></b><p>
An imaging radar works very like a 
flash camera in that it provides its own
light to illuminate an area on the ground and 
take a snapshot picture, but at
radio wavelengths. A flash camera sends out a pulse 
of light (the flash) and
records on film the light that is reflected back at it through 
the camera lens.
Instead of a camera lens and film, a radar uses an antenna and 
digital computer
tapes to record its images. In a radar image, one can see only the 
light that
was reflected back towards the radar antenna. <p>
<p>
A typical radar 
(RAdio Detection and Ranging) measures the strength and
round-trip time of the 
microwave signals that are emitted by a radar antenna
and reflected off a distant 
surface or object. The radar antenna alternately
transmits and receives pulses at 
particular microwave wavelengths (in the range
1 cm to 1 m, which corresponds to a 
frequency range of about 300 MHz to 30 GHz)
and polarizations (waves polarized in a 
single vertical or horizontal plane).
For an imaging radar system, about 1500 high-
power pulses per second are
transmitted toward the target or imaging area, with 
each pulse having a pulse
duration <i>(pulse width)</i>  of typically 10-50 
microseconds (us).  The pulse
normally covers a small band of frequencies, centered 
on the frequency selected
for the radar. Typical bandwidths for an imaging radar are 
in the range 10 to
200 MHz. At the Earth's surface, the energy in the radar pulse is 
scattered in
all directions, with some reflected back toward the antenna. 
Thisbackscatter
returns to the radar as a weaker radar echo and is received by the 
antenna in a
specific polarization (horizontal or vertical, not necessarily the same as 
the
transmitted pulse). These echoes are converted to digital data and passed to 
a
data recorder for later processing and display as an image. Given that the
radar 
pulse travels at the speed of light, it is relatively straightforward to
use the 
measured time for the roundtrip of a particular pulse to calculate the
distance or 
range to the reflecting object. The chosen pulse bandwidth
determines the resolution 
in the range (cross-track) direction.  Higher
bandwidth means finer resolution in this 
dimension.<p>
<p>
<IMG SRC="gif/imagingradarv31.gif"><IMG 
SRC="gif/imagingradarv32.gif"><b></b><p>
<b></b><i>	Radar transmits a pulse
	Measures reflected echo (backscatter )</i><p>
<i></i><p>
In the case of imaging 
radar,  the radar moves along a flight path and the area
illuminated by the radar, or 
<i>footprint</i>,  is moved along the surface in a
swath, building the image as it does 
so. <p>
<IMG SRC="gif/imagingradarv33.gif"><p>
<p>
<i>Building up a radar image 
using the motion of the platform</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>The length of the radar 
antenna determines the resolution in the azimuth
(along-track) direction of the 
image: the longer the antenna, the finer the
resolution in this dimension. <i>Synthetic 
Aperture Radar (SAR)</i>  refers to
a technique used to synthesize a very long 
antenna by combining signals
(echoes) received by the radar as it moves along its 
flight track. Aperture
means the opening used to collect the reflected energy that is 
used to form an
image. In the case of a camera, this would be the shutter opening; for 
radar it
is the antenna. A <i>synthetic</i>  aperture is constructed by moving a 
real
aperture or antenna through a series of positions along the flight track. 
<p>
<p>
<IMG SRC="gif/imagingradarv34.gif"><p>
<p>
<i>Constructing a  Synthetic 
Aperture</i><p>
<i></i><p>
As the radar moves, a pulse is transmitted at each 
position; the return echoes
pass through the receiver and are recorded in an 'echo 
store.' Because the
radar is moving relative to the ground, the returned echoes are 
Doppler-shifted
(negatively as the radar approaches a target; positively as it moves 
away).
Comparing the Doppler-shifted frequencies to a reference frequency allows 
many
returned signals to be "focused" on a single point, effectively increasing 
the
length of the antenna that is imaging that particular point. This 
focusing
operation, commonly known as SAR processing, is now done digitally on 
fast
computer systems. The trick in SAR processing is to correctly match 
the
variation in Doppler frequency for each point in the image: this requires 
very
precise knowledge of the relative motion between the platform and the 
imaged
objects (which is the cause of the Doppler variation in the first 
place).<p>
<p>
Synthetic aperture radar is now a mature technique used to generate 
radar
images in which fine detail can be resolved. SARs provide unique 
capabilities
as an imaging tool.  Because they provide their own illumination (the 
radar
pulses), they can image at any  time of day or night, regardless of 
sun
illumination.  And because the radar wavelengths are much longer than those 
of
visible or infrared light, SARs can also "see" through cloudy and dusty
conditions 
that visible and infrared instruments cannot.<p>
<p>
<b>What is a radar 
image?</b><p>
<b></b><p>
Radar images are composed of many dots, or picture 
elements.  Each pixel
(picture element) in the radar image represents the radar 
backscatter for that
area on the ground: darker areas in the image represent low 
backscatter,
brighter areas represent high backscatter.  Bright features mean that a 
large
fraction of the radar energy was reflected back to the radar, while 
dark
features imply that very little energy was reflected.  Backscatter for a 
target
area at a particular wavelength will vary for a variety of conditions: size 
of
the scatterers in the target area, moisture content of the target area,
polarization 
of the pulses, and observation angles.  Backscatter will also
differ when different 
wavelengths are used.<p>
<p>
Scientists measure backscatter, also known as radar 
cross section, in units of
area (such as square meters).  The backscatter is often 
related to the size of
an object, with objects approximately the size of the wavelength 
(or larger)
appearing bright (i.e. rough) and objects smaller than the wavelength 
appearing
dark (i.e. smooth).   Radar scientists typically use a measure of 
backscatter
called normalized radar cross section, which is independent of the 
image
resolution or pixel size.  Normalized radar cross section (sigma0.) is
measured 
in decibels (dB).  Typical values of sigma0. for natural
surfaces range from +5dB 
(very bright) to -40dB (very dark).<p>
<p>
A useful rule-of-thumb in analyzing 
radar images is that the higher or brighter
the backscatter on the image, the rougher 
the surface being imaged.  Flat
surfaces that reflect little or no microwave energy  
back towards the radar
will always appear dark in radar images. Vegetation is 
usually moderately rough
on the scale of most radar wavelengths and appears as 
grey or light grey in a
radar image. Surfaces inclined towards the radar will have a 
stronger
backscatter than surfaces which slope away from the radar and will tend 
to
appear brighter in a radar image.  Some areas not illuminated by the radar,
like 
the back slope of mountains, are in shadow, and will appear dark.  When
city streets 
or buildings are lined up in such a way that the incoming radar
pulses are able to 
bounce off the streets and then bounce again off the
buildings (called a double-
bounce) and directly back towards the radar they
appear very bright (white) in 
radar images.  Roads and freeways are flat
surfaces so appear dark. Buildings which 
do not line up so that the radar
pulses are reflected straight back will appear light 
grey, like very rough
surfaces.<p>
<p>
<IMG 
SRC="gif/imagingradarv35.gif"><p>
<p>
<i>Imaging different types of surface with 
radar</i><p>
<i></i><p>
Backscatter is also sensitive to the target's electrical 
properties, including
water content.  Wetter objects will appear bright, and drier 
targets will
appear dark.  The exception to this is a smooth body of water, which will 
act
as a flat surface and reflect incoming pulses away from a target; these 
bodies
will appear dark.<p>
<p>
Backscatter will also vary depending on the use of 
different polarization.
Some SARs can transmit pulses in either horizontal (H) or 
vertical (V)
polarization and receive in either H or V, with the resultant combinations 
of
HH (Horizontal transmit, Horizontal receive), VV, HV, or VH.  Additionally,
some 
SARs can measure the phase of the incoming pulse (one wavelength = 2pi
in phase) 
and therefore measure the phase difference (in degrees) in the return
of the HH and 
VV signals.  This difference can  be thought of as a difference
in the roundtrip times 
of HH and VV signals and is frequently the result of
structural characteristics of the 
scatterers.  These SARs can also measure the
correlation coefficient for the HH and 
VV returns, which can be considered as a
measure of how alike (between 0/not alike 
and 1/alike) the HH and VV scatterers
are.<p>
<p>
Different observations angles 
also affect backscatter.  Track angle will affect
backscatter from very linear features: 
urban areas, fences, rows of crops,
ocean waves, fault lines.  The angle of the radar 
wave at the Earth's surface
(called the incidence angle) will also cause a variation in 
the backscatter:
low incidence angles (perpendicular to the surface) will result in 
high
backscatter; backscatter will decrease with increasing incidence 
angles.<p>
<IMG SRC="gif/imagingradarv36.gif"><p>
<p>
<i>Radar backscatter is a 
function of incidence angle, (theta)i</i><p>
<i></i><p>
NASA/JPL's Radar 
Program<p>
<p>
NASA/JPL's radar program began with the SEASAT synthetic 
aperture radar (SAR)
in 1978.  SEASAT was a single frequency (L-band with lambda 
~ 
24 cm or 9.4 inches), single polarization, fixed-look angle radar.  The 
Shuttle
Imaging Radar-A (SIR-A), flown on the Space Shuttle in 1981, was also an L-
band
radar with a fixed look angle. SIR-B (1984) added a multi-look angle 
capability
to the L-band, single polarization radar.  SIR-C/X-SAR is a joint venture 
of
NASA, the German Space Agency (DARA), and the Italian Space Agency 
(ASI).
SIR-C/X-SAR provided increased capability over Seasat, SIR-A, and SIR-B 
by
acquiring images at three microwave wavelengths (lambda), L- band
(lambda ~ 
24 cm or 9.4 inches) quad-polarization; C-band
(lambda ~ 6 cm or 2.4 inches) quad-
polarization; and X-band
(lambda ~ 3 cm) with VV polarization. SIR-C/X-SAR also has 
a
variable  look angle, and can image at incidence angles between 20 and 
65
degrees. SIR-C/X-SAR flew on the shuttle in April and in October of 
1994,
providing radar data for two seasons. Typical image sizes for SIR-C 
data
products are 50kmx100km, with  resolution  between10 and 25 meters in 
both
dimensions. <p>
<p>
Parallel to the development of spaceborne imaging radars, 
NASA/JPL have built
and operated a series of  airborne imaging radar systems. 
NASA/JPL currently
maintain and operate an airborne SAR system, known as 
AIRSAR/TOPSAR, which
flies on a NASA DC-8 jet. In one mode of operation, this 
system is capable of
simultaneously collecting all four polarizations (HH,HV, VH and 
VV) for three
frequencies: L- band (lambda ~ 24 cm); C-band (lambda
~ 6 cm) ; and 
P-band (lambda ~ 68 cm). In another
mode of operation, the AIRSAR/TOPSAR system 
collects all four polarizations
(HH,HV, VH and VV) for two frequencies: L- band 
(lambda ~ 24
cm); and P-band (lambda ~ 68 cm), while operating as 
an
interferometer at C-band to simultaneously generate topographic height 
data.
AIRSAR/TOPSAR also has an along-track interferometer mode which is used 
to
measure current speeds. Typical image sizes for AIRSAR/TOPSAR products 
are
12kmx12km, with 10 meter resolution in both dimensions. Topographic 
map
products generated by  the TOPSAR system have been shown to have a 
height
accuracy of1 m in relatively flat areas, and 5 m height accuracy in 
mountainous
areas.<p>
<p>
JPL are studying designs for  a free-flying multi-
parameter imaging radar
system like the one flown during the SIR-C/X-SAR 
missions. JPL are also
studying a global mapping mission (TOPSAT) which will use 
radar interferometry
to generate high quality topographic maps over the whole 
world and monitor
changes  in topography in areas prone to earthquakes and 
volcanic activity.<p>

SIR-C/X-SAR radars illuminate Earth with microwaves allowing
detailed observations at any time, regardless of weather or
sunlight conditions.  SIR-C/X-SAR uses three microwave
wavelengths:  L-band (24 cm), C-band (6 cm) and X-band (3 cm). 
The multi-frequency data will be used by the international
scientific community to better understand the global environment
and how it is changing.  The SIR-C/X-SAR data, in conjunction
with aircraft and ground studies, will give scientists clearer
insights into those environmental changes which are caused by
nature and those changes which are induced by human activity.  
SIR-C was developed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.  X-SAR
was developed by the Dornier and Alenia Spazio companies for the
German space agency, Deutsche Agentur fur 
Raumfahrtangelegenheiten (DARA), and the Italian space agency,
Agenzia Spaziale Italiana (ASI).

<h1>What is SIR-C/X-SAR?</h1>
<hr>
SIR-C/X-SAR stands for  Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-band Synthetic Aperture
Radar. SIR-C/X-SAR is an imaging radar system scheduled for launch aboard the
NASA Space Shuttle in 1994. It consists of a radar antenna structure and
associated radar system hardware that is designed to fit inside the Space
Shuttle's cargo bay. On take-off, the cargo bay doors are closed as seen in the
graphic on the next page. After the Space Shuttle has reached a stable Earth
orbit, the cargo bay doors will be opened , the antenna structure will be
deployed, and SIR-C/X-SAR will be switched on, to begin using its
state-of-the-art radar technology to image the earth's surface. Radar images
generated by SIR-C/X-SAR will be used by scientists to help understand some of
the processes which affect the earth's environment, such as deforestation in
the Amazon, desertification south of the Sahara, and soil moisture retention in
the Mid-West.<p>

<h2>The SIR-C/X-SAR Project</h2>
<hr>
	SIR-C/X-SAR is a joint project of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA), the German Space Agency (DARA) and the Italian Space
Agency (ASI). It is the next step in a series of spaceborne imaging radars,
beginning with SEASAT in 1978, continuing with SIR-A (1981), Germany's
Microwave Remote Sensing Experiment (1983), and SIR-B (1984). It is a precursor
to the Earth Observing System (EOS) imaging radar system planned for the end of
the decade. <p>
<b></b><p>
<h2>Science Objectives</h2>
<hr>
	SIR-C/X-SAR's unique contributions to Earth observation and monitoring are its
capability to measure, from space, the radar signature of the surface at three
different wavelengths, and to make measurements for different polarizations at
two of those wavelengths. SIR-C image data will help scientists understand the
physics behind some of the phenomena seen in radar images at just one
wavelength/polarization, such as those produced by SEASAT. Investigators on the
SIR-C/X-SAR Science team will use the radar image data from SIR-C/X-SAR to make
measurements of the following:<p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Vegetation type, extent and deforestation<p>
<li>Soil moisture content<p>
<li>Ocean dynamics, wave and surface wind speeds and directions<p>
<li>Volcanism and tectonic activity<p>
<li>Soil erosion and desertification<p>
</ul>
<p>
<p>
<h2>SIR-C/X-SAR Instrument Description</h2>
<hr>
<p>
	The SIR-C/X-SAR antenna structure actually consists of three individual
antennas, one operating at L-band (23.5cm wavelength), one at C-band (5.8cm
wavelength) and the third at X-band (3cm wavelength). The L-band and C-band
antennas are constructed from separate panels that can measure both horizontal
and vertical polarizations.<p>
<p>
<IMG SRC="gif/SIRCdesc3.gif"><p>
<p>
	The SIR-C/X-SAR antenna is the most massive piece of hardware (at a total of
10,500 kilograms) ever assembled at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and measures
12 meters by 4 meters. The SIR-C instrument was built by JPL and the Ball
Communication Systems Division for NASA and provides the L-band and C-band
measurements at different polarizations. The L-band and C-band antennas employ
phased array technology, which allows the antenna beam pointing to be adjusted
electronically. The X-SAR  instrument is built by the Dornier and  Alenia
Spazio companies for DARA and ASI and operates at a single frequency, X-band.
The X-SAR antenna is a slotted waveguide type, which uses a mechanical tilt to
change the beam pointing direction. <p>
<p>
<p>
<h2>SIR-C/X-SAR Image Data</h2>
<hr>
	During a week-long Shuttle flight, SIR-C/X-SAR will image an area of roughly
50 million square kilometers of the Earth's surface. This corresponds to a
total of 50 hours of data. The peak data rate will be 225 megabits (or
225,000,000 bits) per second. The data collected will be processed into images
with resolution selectable from 10 to 200 meters. The width of the area mapped
out by the radar will vary from 15 to 90 kilometers, depending on how the radar
is operated, and the direction in which the antenna beams are pointing. Data
from SIR-C/X-SAR will be used to develop automatic techniques for extracting
information from radar image data, in preparation for the EOS SAR mission later
in the decade.<p>
<p>
<IMG SRC="gif/SIRCdesc4.gif"><p>
<p>
This schematic diagram shows the SIR-C/X-SAR antennas illuminating an area on
the ground, and mapping out a swath as the Shuttle moves forward. The area
shown is a SEASAT image of Los Angeles, California. North is to the right of
the image shown.<p>
<p>
<h2>More About SIR-C/X-SAR</h2>
<hr>
	The Shuttle Imaging Radar-C and X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR)
is a cooperative space shuttle experiment between the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration (NASA), the German Space Agency (DARA), and the Italian
Space Agency (ASI).  The experiment is the next step forward in NASA's
Spaceborne Imaging Radar (SIR) program that began with the Seasat Synthetic
Aperture Radar (SAR) in 1978, and continued with SIR-A in 1981 and SIR-B in
1984. The program will eventually lead to TOPSAT, a mission to measure
topography globally, and the Earth Observing System (EOS) SAR later in this
decade.  The program also benefits from experience gained with the Magellan
Mission to Venus, other international spaceborne radar programs (e.g. ERS-1,
JERS-1), and prototype aircraft sensors such as the JPL Airborne SAR
(AIRSAR).<p>
<p>
	SIR-C will provide increased capability over SEASAT, SIR-A, and SIR-B by
acquiring digital images simultaneously at two microwave wavelengths
([[lambda]]): L- band ([[lambda]] = 23.5 cm) and C-band ([[lambda]] = 5.8 cm).
These vertically- and horizontally-polarized transmitted waves will be received
on two separate channels, so that SIR-C will provide images of the magnitude of
radar backscatter for four polarization combinations: HH
(Horizontally-transmitted, Horizontally-received), VV (Vertically-transmitted,
Vertically-received), HV, and VH; and also data on the relative phase
difference between the HH, VV, VH, and HV returns.  This allows derivation of
the complete scattering matrix of a scene on a pixel by pixel basis.  From this
scattering matrix, every polarization configuration (linear, circular or
elliptical) can be generated during ground processing.  The radar polarimetric
data will yield more detailed information about the surface geometric
structure, vegetation cover, and subsurface discontinuities than image
brightness alone.  <p>
<p>
	Germany's imaging radar program started with the Microwave Remote Sensing
Experiment (MRSE) flown aboard the Shuttle.  This X-band radar was flown on the
first SPACELAB mission in 1983.  The program was continued by development of
the X-SAR, for which cooperation with Italy was initiated.  X-SAR, will operate
at X-band ([[lambda]] = 3.1 cm) with VV polarization, resulting in a
three-frequency capability for the total SIR-C/X-SAR system.  Because radar
backscatter is most strongly influenced by objects comparable in size to the
radar wavelength, this multi-frequency capability will provide information
about the Earth's surface over a wide range of scales not discernible with
previous single-wavelength experiments.<p>
<b></b><p>
<h2>SIR-C/X-SAR Instrumentation</h2>
<hr>
	SIR-C will provide multi-frequency, multi-polarization radar data.  The SIR-C
instrument is composed of several subsystems: the antenna array, the
transmitter, the receivers, the data-handling subsystem, and the ground SAR
processor.  The antenna is composed of two planar arrays, one for L-band and
one for C-band.  Each array is composed of a uniform grid of dual-polarized
microstrip antenna radiators, with each polarization port fed by a separate
corporate feed network.  The overall size of the SIR-C antenna is 12.0 x 3.7
meters and consists of three leaves each divided into four subpanels. <p>
<p>
<b>Model of the SIR-C/X-SAR antenna</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<IMG SRC="gif/SIRCdesc5.gif"><p>
<p>
	Unlike previous SIR missions, the SIR-C radar beam is formed from hundreds of
small low power solid state transmitters embedded in the surface of the radar
antenna.  By properly phasing the energy from these transmitters, the beam can
be electronically steered in the range direction +/-23deg. from the nominal
40deg. off nadir position without physically moving the large radar antenna.
This feature will enable images to be acquired over a wide range of incidence
angles.  <p>
<p>
	X-SAR will provide VV polarization images using a passive slotted waveguide
antenna measuring 12.0 x 0.4 meters.  Other X-SAR components include a
traveling wave tube as transmitter, an exciter, receiver, and data handling
subsystem.  A mechanical  tilt mechanism will point the X-SAR antenna to angles
between 15 and 60deg., in the same direction as the L-band and C-band beams.
<p>
<p>
	Both SIR-C and X-SAR can be operated as either stand alone radars or together.
Roll and yaw maneuvers of the shuttle will allow data to be acquired on either
side of the shuttle nadir (ground) track.  The width of the imaged swath on the
ground varies from 15 to 90 kilometers (9 to 56 miles) depending on the
orientation of the antenna beams and the operational mode. Table 1 presents a
summary of the SIR-C/X-SAR system characteristics.<p>

<TITLE>FAQ</TITLE>
<H1>Frequently Asked Questions</H1>
<HR>
<P></P>
<OL>
<LI>How can I get data or images of (your favorite site here) ?</li>
<blockquote>
Take a look at our <a href="scienceapps/data.html">section devoted to this very topic!</a>
</blockquote>


<LI>What is the difference between radar images and radar data?</LI>
<P></P>
<p>
<blockquote>
Radar images are typically byte images of some sort.  
Radar data is in a different
format, sometimes due to the nature of the data.  For <a
href="poldesc.html">polarimetric radars</a>, the data volume of radar
data can be quite large compared to a byte image.  However, there may be
a great deal more information than is present in the byte images.</P>
<p>The <a href="sirced.html">SIR-C Education CD-ROM </a> describes the
characteristics of radar data.</p>
<p>There is also what we call "raw" SAR data, which is the signal data
that we process into images. </p> 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<li>What is the difference between a radar image and a regular image
like a camera would take ?</li>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
Imaging radars provide a unique way of looking at the Earth and other
planetary
bodies. An imaging radar works very like a flash camera in that it
provides its own
light to illuminate an area of interest and take a snapshot picture, but
at radio
wavelengths. The chief advantages of using radar are its ability to
'see ' at night and
through thick cloud cover. There are currently several operational
spaceborne and
airborne imaging radars being used for remote sensing of the Ea rth's
environment,
with more to come in the near future. 
For a complete tutorial
on the characteristics of radar data, see the <a href="sirced.html">SIR-C
Education CD-ROM</a>.

<hr>
<P></P>
<p>Of all the imaging radars that have been or are in orbit about the
Earth, <a href="../desc/SIRCdesc.html">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> is the only one that is multi-frequency and
multi-polarization.  This added capability is comparable to the advance
from black and white to color pictures.  With these different channels
of data, we may create color radar images.  For instance, <a
href="../kliucomp.html">here is how we created a color image of the
Kliuchevskoi Volcano
in Russia</a>.</p>
<p>With this in mind, we thought we would have a Contest!  The object of
the contest is to make on your own computer the most interesting color image
of Sunbury Pennsylvania.  Of course, we provide the black and white GIF images
of different channels 
of the radar data.</p>

<A HREF="/education/cdrom/OrderCD.html">
order the SIR-C Educational CD-ROM</A> from
the EROS data center. 
(Volume <b>SIRCED03</b> is the latest).
If you don't have access to a CD-ROM, almost all of 
<a href="http://southport.jpl.nasa.gov/cdrom/ROADMAP/GUIDTOUR.HTM">
the contents of this CD-ROM is now available on-line!
</a>
<p>

<b>The <i>third</i> CD-ROM, SIRCED03</b>, 
was produced following the two successful SIR-C/X-SAR Missions 
on the Space Shuttle Endeavour in 1994.  It contains the exciting 
results from the two missions in pictures and videos, 
with lesson plans that utilize the mission results to 
teach students about our changing Earth.  

<p>
The SIRCED03 CD complies with the <i>ISO-9660</i> standards.
This means this CD can be read directly from the PC, Macintosh and Unix
platforms!
<p>


The first SIR-C Education CD, SIRCED01,
was developed before the two SIR-C/X-SAR missions on the 
Space Shuttle Endeavour in 1994.  The SIRCED01 CD-ROM contains a 
pre-launch look at the SIR-C/X-SAR mission, the sites to be 
covered and the science planned for the mission.  The SIRCED01 
will run on Macintosh, PC and some Unix workstations; a 
Macintosh is required to use its full capability.
<p>

The second SIR-C Education CD, SIRCED02, was developed after
the SIR-C/X-SAR missions but it could only be read from Macintosh
computers. This limited its distribution.
There was a need for this information to be available
on other platforms, especially the PC.
<p>

The third and last SIR-C Educational CD, SIRCED03, was developed
for this purpose. This CD can be read from many platforms including
PC, Mac and Unix systems. 
The SIRCED03 CD also has all of the contents of the 
SIRCED02 CD for Macintosh and much more.
The SIRCED03 CD is vastly reorganized and
includes lots of new information and pictures that were not 
available previously.
<a href="http://southport.jpl.nasa.gov/cdrom/ROADMAP/GUIDTOUR.HTM">
The entire contents of the SIRECED03 CD is now available on-line!
</a>
Please be patient as the information is being directly read
from a CD drive!

<CENTER><H1>Instructions on Using the JPL Imaging Radar Bulletin Board</H1></CENTER>
<P><STRONG>IMPORTANT:</STRONG>  This bulletin board makes use of 
fill-out-forms, so you must have a browser that will support this feature. 
<hr size=5>
<P>The Bulletin Board is fairly self explanatory.  If you want to
submit a question, just click on the icon for submitting a question.
You will then see a box to fill in your question.  Below the box is a
submit button:  After you click on this button, the question will be
posted to the bulletin board.  
</p><P>If you want to read responses to a question, then click on the
number of responses at the end of the question.  This will then bring up
all the responses to that question.  If you want to submit your own
response just click on the icon for submitting a response, and, just as
for submitting a question, you will see a box for writing text, and
below that, a submit button to post the response.
</p>
<hr size=5>
<p>With this bulletin board, you may format (if you like - it is
<strong> not necessary </strong>) your responses in html.  If you want to
 put in an html link, feel free.  Please be sure that it is formatted
correctly and that the link works before you submit it, so that we don't
have incorrect links. You can look at this 
<a href = "http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/General/Internet/WWW/HTMLPrimer.html">beginners guide to html</a> for
more commands,  but here are some basic html commands that you may
want to incorporate in your questions and responses:
</p><p>
If you want to make a line break, simply end a line with
<strong> &lt p &gt </strong> 
</p><p>

If you are
linking to a location on the imaging radar home page, be sure to start
the link with a "/".  For instance, a link to the bulletin board welcome page would
read:
<p><strong> &lta href = &quot/bboard/Welcome.html&quot&gt Bulletin Board
Welcome Page &lt/a&gt 
</strong>.</p>
<p> and would look like this : Here is a link to the 
<a href="/bboard/Welcome.html">Bulletin Board Welcome Page</a>
<p>
If you want to put a link to an image on the imaging radar home page, or
another location, you may phrase this within your question or response
as :</p>
<strong>&lta href = &quot/pio/srl/sirc/srl-manaus2.gif&quot&gt
Manaus Comparison &lt/a&gt
</strong>.
</p><p> and it would look like this : <p>
<a
href="/pio/srl/sirc/srl-manaus2.gif">Manaus Comparision</a>
<p>
If you want to put an in-line link to an image (keep in mind that the
more in-line images, the longer it takes to load
the questions.  <strong>If you put in too many, we will delete
them</strong>) on the imaging radar home page or
another location, you may phrase this within your question or response
as :</p>
<strong>&ltimg  src = &quot/pio/srl/sirc/srl-manaus28.gif.html&quot&gt
</strong>.</p><p>and it would look like this :<br> <img
src="/pio/srl/sirc/srl-manaus28.gif"></p><p>
Or, when looking at another site, you would state  it as :</p><p>
<strong>&ltimg  src = &quothttp://sun1.cr.usgs.gov/landdaac/sir-c/sircsamp.html&quot&gt
</strong>.</p> <p>which would look like :
</p><p>
<img src="http://sun1.cr.usgs.gov/landdaac/sir-c/sircsamp.gif
 However, too many in-line links will slow down loading the
bulletin board, and will be deleted if they seem unnecessary.

QUESTION 430:<STRONG>     One method of simulating a SAR image is to simulate the speckle image and multipy it by the simulated background image.  According to a paper by Dr. Lee, N-look intensity speckle has a Chi-square distribution with 2N degrees of freedom and thus a mean of 2N.  How do I multiply this by my background image so as not to change the mean intensity of the background image (i.e. so as not to change its energy)? Should I divide the speckle image first by 2N? Or shoud I divide it by its mean (which is only approximately 2N)? Or should I do something else entirely?  Another paper I've seen by Frery says that N-look intensity  speckle is best described by a gamma distribution in which alpha = lambda = N. This is not the same as a Chi-square distribution so which is correct (or which is more correct)?  A totally different approach is to apply speckle to the background image by creating a random phase image in which the pixels form a uniform distribution over the interval 0 to 2pi, produce the exponential of the phase image, apply a 2D FFT, multiply it with an FFT'd impulse respnse function and then inverse FFT it and take the magnitude.  Is any one method considered to be better? 1/28/97</STRONG> - <A HREF="/cgi-bin/bb-MakeResponsePage.pl/qnum=430">0 responses</A><ADDRESS>Gordon G.

QUESTION 301:<STRONG>     I'm attemptng to develop algorithms (as automatic as possible) for an oil slick detection that uses Radarsat SAR data, although probably not exclusively.

My calculations indicate that in mildly windy conditions the return from an isolated tree should be visible in 5-10 cells to either side of the tree. Obviously this result is specific to one system (x-band 1.5m x-range resolution) The doppler bandwidth estimate for the tree canopy comes from several different sources and exceeds the resolution cell bandwidth by a factor 10. 1/24/96</STRONG> - <A HREF="/cgi-bin/bb-MakeResponsePage.pl/qnum=216">3 responses</A> - [last response 4/25/96]<ADDRESS>mark williams, DRA - Malvern - England, mlwilliams%taz.dnet@hermes.dra.hmg.gb</ADDRESS><HR>

QUESTION 210:<STRONG>     The SIR-C calibration article by Freeman et al. (IEEE Trans. Geosci. Rem. Sens.  33: 848-857) shows various calibration uncertainties for the 2 SRL flights (tables 8 and 9). For instance, the  pass-to-pass uncertainty at L-band for SRL-1 is +-1.3dB. How exactly should this uncertainty be interpreted? Is it a confidence interval so that one can assume, for instance, that backscatter from identical targets at the same incidence angles on two different passes will be within +-1.3dB 90% of the time? Or 95%, or 100% of the time? Is the calibration uncertainty to be interpreted differ- ently for point and distributed targets?

QUESTION 187:<STRONG>     hi, Although L-Band Synthetic Aperture Radars have been used to produce high  quality images, has there been any attempt to use the Ultra Wide Band UHF.  In an earlier paper I had argued that with large band width avaliable, the number of independent samples that can be averaged are high. Consequently averaging these "indepentent samples" can produce a sharper image, even when the entire aperture  is not used. (ie smallest possible resolution is not used).

QUESTION 166:<STRONG>     I have a basic question about how radar interacts with the ground.  I know that as surface roughness increases, less radar energy is specularly re- flected and more is backscattered to the sensor.  Is it the same for soil moisture?  Specifically, as you reduce soil moisture, do you get more  specular reflection (I know less energy is scattered back to the sensor, but is this due solely to soil penetration?)?  Also, how would the response vary between HH and VV polarizations? 11/10/95</STRONG> - <A HREF="/cgi-bin/bb-MakeResponsePage.pl/qnum=166">3 responses</A> - [last response 12/ 5/95]<ADDRESS>John Chadwick, chadwick@sensor.gsfc.nasa.gov</ADDRESS><HR>

QUESTION 129:<STRONG>     Hello; I have a student who has a question I cannot begin to answer. If you could help him out I would appreciate it. I will let him type the question in. Dear NAS, I have heard NASA scientists saying that they plan to terra form Mars by pumping gases into its  atmosphere, like CO2 to worm the planet..  But when Mars had an atmosphere before and it wass maintained by volcanoes pumping necessary gases into the Marsion atmosphere.  Then when the volcanic activity stoped, the planet lost its atmosphere to space.  So the planets gravity was too weak to hold on to any life sustaining atmosphere.  Doesn't that mean you can not terra form Mars?  Mars's gravity is just too weak.  Also, please don't give me an explenation on how you plan to terra form Mars.

QUESTION 116:<STRONG>     I am a grad student relatively new to SAR research, so I apologize in advance if this is an ignorant question.  My only experience with SAR imagery is over  land, (esp. wetlands).  In some cases I have found strong sigma0-VV responses over wetlands at large incidence (~40).  I thought this may be due to vertically oriented vegetation growth until I saw the same strong sigma0-VV at large incidence over open ocean.  I expected calm ocean to be nearly specular, with sigma0-VV roughly equal to sigma0-HH.  I thought my image might simply be a special case with waves oriented to produce the strong sigma0-VV until I noticed that in some references, (Ulaby, Moore, Fung, Microwave Remote  Sensing..., vol. 2) that sigma0-VV is predicted to be stronger than sigma0-HH at large incidence over ocean.  In this reference, nothing was mentioned about a particular wave orientation.

QUESTION 92:<STRONG>     I'm a UC Davis water management specialist working on something called regulated deficit irrigation.  It's the practice of purposely depriving plants of water during stress-tolerant periods in order to save water while possibly enhancing some aspect of production.  For example, we identified that mild stress during late July in almond can reduce the incidence of hull rot fungus. I have 3 experimental field sites in the San Joaquin Valley where different irrigation treatments result in tree water stress.  We are monitoring this stress from the ground with leaf/stem water potential and stomatal conductance measurements.  I would like to see if these stresses express themselves in  something that can be remotely sensed.  I've tried using hand-held infrared thermometers from 12 ft ladders to monitor canopy temperature but there is a lot of variability.  I'm thinking something from an airplane would be much better.  Each replication is approximately 75 x 120 ft. and contains 8-30 trees.  I believe there are some private consultants who offer fly-over  services using some type of infrared film.  However, I've never been satisfied that they know what they are measuring.  This would be an ideal opportunity for someone working on developing remote sensors to verify their utility with ground based measurements.     7/24/95</STRONG> - <A HREF="/cgi-bin/bb-MakeResponsePage.pl/qnum=92">1 response</A> - [last response 7/25/95]<ADDRESS>Dave Goldhamer, Dept. of LAWR, Univ. of CA, Davis, Dave@uckac.edu</ADDRESS><HR>

QUESTION 54:<STRONG>     This is in reply to Tom(?) who replied to my question no.51 I/we don't have a homepage and your e-mail address appears to be invalid so... Our radar is 94GHz (sees through fog/rain/smoke) and has a 25cm down-range resolution. The cross range resolution is between 1.4m and 4m at 800m range. The data is digitised to 8-bits and yes we fly our own helicopter over what we fancy. Yhis uses most of our buget and the cost per mile is frightening, so I'm not at liberty to hand out free data (sorry). We have automatically registered these images against cartographic maps and x-band SAR. To do the same against infra red images would be harder because of the lack of range information but it is possible. I know people who automatically register infrared images taken at both shallow and steep depression angles, against cart maps. 3/30/95</STRONG> - <A HREF="/cgi-bin/bb-MakeResponsePage.pl/qnum=54">3 responses</A> - [last response 4/21/95]<ADDRESS>mark williams, dra uk, MLWILLIAMS%TAZ.dnet@hermes.dra.hmg.gb</ADDRESS><HR>
QUESTION 52:<STRONG>     I work with imaging radar. A forward looking airborn radar scans the ground from +/- 30 degrees at a shallow depression angle. The data is gathered at about 800m. A radar image is made, combining the  information from many sweeps. High down-range resolution plus the use of doppler beam sharpening techniques allow the formation of good quality x-band images. We then aim to automatically register these against cartographic maps and also identify interesting features.

QUESTION 32:<STRONG>     Some comments:  1) How about an imaging radar 'who's who' with information on research interests, possibly brief biographical details, and a contact address. This would be a  useful resource for researchers. I mean this to include anybody, and not just limit it to the JPL staff.  2) I would like to see the standard sample datasets available via the WWW route. One of each format, from each sensor would be nice. 'Real' data, rather than pictures, of course. Ditto the standard docs, preferably in postscript format.  3) A list of available JPL radar reports/publications along with ordering info (etc) would be useful. This would stop me having to bug the radar librarians so I guess they'd be happy too. Perhaps a section on radar textbooks would be a useful item too.  4) Finally, congratulations on the BBS and the updated home page!

<h2>Abstract<BR></h2>
</center>

The Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-band 
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) is the
most advanced imaging radar system to fly in Earth orbit.  
Carried in the cargo bay
of the Space Shuttle Endeavour in April and October of 1994,
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
simultaneously
recorded
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SAR">SAR</a> 
data at three wavelengths (L-, C-, and X-bands; 23.5, 5.8, and 3.1 cm,
respectively).<BR>
<BR>
The
   <a href="Acronyms.html#SIR-C/X-SAR">SIR-C/X-SAR</a> 
Science Team consists of 52 investigator teams from more than a dozen
countries.  Science investigations were undertaken in the fields 
of ecology, hydrology,
geology, and oceanography.  This report contains 44 investigator 
team reports and
several additional reports from co-investigators and other researchers.

<title>SEASAT - 1978</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>
SEASAT	1978</h1>
<p>
<img src="">
<p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Seasat was the first Earth-orbiting satellite designed for remote sensing of 
the Earth's oceans and had onboard the first spaceborne synthetic aperture 
radar (SAR). Seasat was managed by JPL and was launched on June 28, 
1978 into a nearly circular 800 km orbit with an inclination of 108 
degrees.  Fourteen Earth orbits were completed each day. 
<p>
Five complementary experiments designed to return the maximum 
information from ocean surfaces were onboard:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Radar altimeter to measure spacecraft height above the ocean surface
<li>Microwave scatterometer to measure wind speed and direction
<li> Scanning multichannel micrwave radiometer to measure sea surface 
temperature
<li> Visible and infrared radiometer to identify cloud, land and water 
features
<li> Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) L-band, HH polarization, fixed look 
angle to monitor the global surface wave field and polar sea ice conditions.
</ul><p>

The Seasat SAR operated for 105 days until October 10, 1978, when a 
massive short circuit in the satellite electrical system ended the mission.  
During Seasat operations, approximately 42 hours of data were collected.

<h2>
How to Get Seasat Imaging Radar Data </h2>
<p>
All the Seasat data were acquired digitally and most of the data were 
optically processed to survey data products.  These products are available 
on 70 mm film.  The Seasat swath width of 100 km was processed into 
four 25 km wide products at JPL.  Only a small percentage of the data were 
digitally processed; these products contain the complete 100 km wide 
swath of data.  
<p>
The Seasat digital processor operated at JPL from 1978 to 1982.  
Approximately 10% of the total Seasat data set were processed to  
precision data before the processor was turned off.  JPL currently has no 
capability to process additional Seasat data.
 <p>
All of the data that were processed are archived at JPL.  Digital data are 
available as byte products on 9 track 6250 bpi CCT or as 8 x 10 black and 
white prints, positive transparencies, or duplicate negatives.  The photo 
products are approximately 1:500,000 scale.
<p>

<h1>SIR-A	1982</h1>
<p>
<img src="">
<p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
The Shuttle Imaging Radar A (SIR-A) was launched aboard the space 
shuttle Columbia in November 12, 1981 on shuttle orbital flight test -2 
(OFT-2).  It formed part of NASA's Office of Space and Terrestrial 
Applications (OSTA-1) payload.  The main goal of SIR-A was to further our 
understanding of radar signatures of geologic features; a secondary goal 
was to assess the shuttle as a scientific platform for Earth observations.

<h2>How to Get SIR-A Data </h2>
<p>
The SIR-A processor was operated at JPL from December 1981 to March 
1982.  All 8 hours of the SIR-A data were optically acquired; there was no 
digital system to collect data.  All collected SIR-A data were processed to 
optical products and are available as hard copy prints or as film 
negatives/positives.  The scale on the photo products is 1:500,000.
<p>
The JPL Radar Data Center maintains an archive of SIR-A 5" data for 
reference only.  JPL does not distribute the SIR-A data products. 
<p>
All imagery acquired by SIR-A are available for public distribution from 
the National Space Science Data Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.  Inquiries 
concerning costs and turn-around times should be directed to:

<h1>SIR-B	1985</h1>

<p>
<img src="">
<p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>

Shuttle Imaging Radar B (SIR-B) was the second major step in the 
evolutionary NASA radar remote sensing research program.  The radar 
imagery collected at the fixed look angle SEASAT and SIR-A experiments 
demonstrated the relationship between image intensity and the incidence 
angle of the radar at the surface.  This led to the design of SIR-B, the first 
spaceborne SAR with a mechanically tiltable antenna.  This allowed the 
acquisition of multi-incidence angle imagery.  
<p>
SIR-B was launched on October 5, 1984 aboard the Space Shuttle 
Challenger on flight 41-G into a nominally circular orbit.  The average 
altitude for the first 20 orbits was 360 km; for the next 29 orbits was 257 
km; and for the duration of the mission 224 km.  At the 224 km altitude, 
the orbit was allowed to drift slightly westward with an approximate 1-
day repeat cycle.  This enabled SIR-B to image a given site at several 
different incidence angles on subsequent days over the course of the 
mission.
<p>
An international team of scientists participated in the mission, conducting 
scientific investigations in geology, renewable resources, oceanography, 
and calibration techniques.

<title>Pre-launch Radarsat Press Release</title>
<h1> Pre-launch Radarsat Press Release</h1>
<hr>
<b>
RADARSAT/DELTA II ROCKET SCHEDULED FOR NOV. 3 LAUNCH
</b><p>
     The launch of the RADARSAT spacecraft is scheduled to
occur between 6:22 to 6:23 a.m. PST on Friday, Nov. 3, from
NASA's Space Launch Complex 2, Vandenberg Air Force Base, CA.
</p><p>
     The spacecraft, mated aboard a McDonnell Douglas-built
Delta II rocket on Oct. 25, is a cooperative program between
the Canadian Space Agency (CSA), the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and NASA.
</p><p>

      Carrying a powerful radar that can see through clouds
and darkness, RADARSAT will produce high resolution images
of the Earth's lands and oceans.  Data from satellite images
will be used for research and applications in oceanography,
agriculture, forestry, hydrology and geology.  Information
on sea ice and terrestrial ice sheets will be used for
climate studies and as an aid for navigation of Arctic and
Antarctic Ocean waters, including iceberg surveillance.
</p><p>

     The CSA developed and will operate the satellite; NASA
will furnish launch services.  In exchange, the United
States will have access to archived data and direct
approximately 15 percent of the satellite's observing time.
NOAA will use the data for environmental monitoring programs
and also facilitate data distribution to other U.S.
government agencies.  RADARSAT International, Inc. (RSI)
will be the commercial distributor of the data worldwide.
Lockheed Martin, as a partner in RSI, has distribution
rights in the U.S.
</p><p>

     A prelaunch news conference will be held on Thursday,
Nov. 2 at 11 a.m. PST in the main conference room of the
NASA Vandenberg Resident Office, Building 840, Vandenberg AFB, CA.
</p><p>

     Participants will be:
</p><p>

Floyd Currington, NASA Launch Manager, Kennedy Space Center
</p><p>

Don Miller, NASA Launch Vehicle Manager, Goddard Space Flight Center
</p><p>

Robert Warren, RADARSAT Spacecraft Manager, Canadian Space Agency
</p><p>

Capt. John Shattuck, USAF Launch Weather Officer, Vandenberg AFB
</p><p>

     NASA Television is carried on Spacenet 2, transponder
5, channel 9 located at 69 degrees West longitude.  Audio
only will be available on the V-3 circuit which may be
reached by dialing 407/867-1260.
</p><p>

                    -end-
</p><p>

Radar interferogram of a portion of the Rutford ice stream in
Antarctica, based on two ERS-1 images taken six days apart.  The fringe
pattern (color cycle) is essentially a map of ice flow velocity, with
one fringe representing 28 mm of range change along the radar line of
site. From Goldstein et al. (1993)

<p>These images are made by taking (in most cases)
multichannel radar images and assigning the colors red, green, and blue 
to three of the channels.  <strong><a href="kliucomp.html">
An example of how this is done is shown here</a></strong>.

SIR-C/X-SAR radars illuminate Earth with microwaves allowing
detailed observations at any time, regardless of weather or
sunlight conditions.  SIR-C/X-SAR uses three microwave
wavelengths:  L-band (24 cm), C-band (6 cm) and X-band (3 cm). 
The multi-frequency data will be used by the international
scientific community to better understand the global environment
and how it is changing.  The SIR-C/X-SAR data, in conjunction
with aircraft and ground studies, will give scientists clearer
insights into those environmental changes which are caused by
nature and those changes which are induced by human activity.  
SIR-C was developed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.  X-SAR
was developed by the Dornier and Alenia Spazio companies for the
German space agency, Deutsche Agentur fur 
Raumfahrtangelegenheiten (DARA), and the Italian space agency,
Agenzia Spaziale Italiana (ASI).

SIR-C/X-SAR radars illuminate Earth with microwaves allowing
detailed observations at any time, regardless of weather or
sunlight conditions.  SIR-C/X-SAR uses three microwave
wavelengths:  L-band (24 cm), C-band (6 cm) and X-band (3 cm). 
The multi-frequency data will be used by the international
scientific community to better understand the global environment
and how it is changing.  The SIR-C/X-SAR data, in conjunction
with aircraft and ground studies, will give scientists clearer
insights into those environmental changes which are caused by
nature and those changes which are induced by human activity.  
SIR-C was developed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.  X-SAR
was developed by the Dornier and Alenia Spazio companies for the
German space agency, Deutsche Agentur fur 
Raumfahrtangelegenheiten (DARA), and the Italian space agency,
Agenzia Spaziale Italiana (ASI).

<H1>SIR-C Interferometry Coverage</H1>
<HR>
<p>
  These maps (courtesy of Eric Fielding of JPL) show the locations of the swaths of the
interferometry datatake pairs collected during the SIR-C missions of
1994.
Each line represents the centerline of the two datatakes that form an
interferometric pair. Different line colors and line widths indicate
which
pair covers that line, as shown in the map key. A few interferometric
pairs
were collected by repeating the same orbit in the April SRL1 and October
SRL2 flights, all the other pairs were collected during days 7 through
10
of SRL2. The map of the world is in a Robinson projection.  The maps of
the individual continents are in Lambert Conformal Conic projections.
</p><p>
Most of the SRL2 interferometry datatakes were collected in a special
high-resolution interferometry mode (40 MHz bandwidth, VV polarization
only) of the SIR-C instrument, and have a swath width of about 20 km.

<TITLE>SIR-C Mode Table</TITLE>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<H1>SIR-C Mode Table</H1>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>
SIR-C Radar Modes</h2>
</p><p>
The SIR-C radar has various modes of operation which are different
combinations
of frequency and polarization (see Table below).  Modes 1 through 16
were the
primary modes of operation; most of the repeat-pass interferometry data
collected during the last three days of SRL-2 were collected in Mode 20.
Different modes were used for each datatake depending on the primary
science
goal of the datatake.  For example, geology datatakes were often taken
in Mode
11 which provides dual frequency and dual polarization data and a swath
width of
approximately 30-50 km thereby providing good data coverage.  Ecology
datatakes
were often taken in mode 16 which is dual frequency and quad
polarization; due
to the greater amount of data collected in mode 16, the swath width is
narrower
and is typically 10-25 km wide.  Many sites were imaged in more than one
mode on
different data passes.  The mode information for each datatake is
included in a
text file posted with the survey data at the <a href="http://sun1.cr.usgs.gov/landdaac/sir-c/survey.html">EROS Data Center
</a> for each datatake.  
This text file, called DTHDR.TXT has the mode
information on
line #6.
</p><p>
The columns headed by "channel 1", "channel 2", etc., indicate the data
recorded to each of four high density digital recorders on-board the
Space Shuttle during mission operations.  Therefore, to find out which
frequencies and polarizations were recorded for a particular mode, just
look up all the frequencies and modes saved to the four recorder
channels.  In order to double the swath, the same frequency and
polarization was saved to more than one channel.</p>
<p>The frequency and polarizations letter abbreviations indicate the
following :</p>
<ul>
<li>LHH - L-band, Horizontal transmit and receive</li>
<li>LVH - L-band, Vertical transmit, Horizontal receive</li>
<li>LHV - L-band, Horizontal transmit, Vertical receive</li>
<li>LVV - L-band, Vertical transmit and receive</li>
<li>CHH - C-band, Horizontal transmit and receive</li>
<li>CVH - C-band, Vertical transmit, Horizontal receive</li>
<li>CHV - C-band, Horizontal transmit, Vertical receive</li>
<li>CVV - C-band, Vertical transmit and receive</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<p>The following images were obtained from either earth orbit by 
<a href="desc/SIRCdesc.html"> SIR-C </a> 
 (on the Space Shuttle Endeavour), or from an airborne laboratory <a
href="desc/AIRSdesc.html"> (AIRSAR)</a> flying at 33,000 ft.  By
acquiring  and processing "Interferometric SAR" data from these instruments, we can
obtain maps of the topography of the areas illuminated by these imaging
radars.  From these maps of topography, we can form perspective views,
3-d analglyphs, and video fly-bys of the data (using the radar
brightness as the intensity and the color indicating either height contours or
frequency /polarization effects).</p>

<p>The following images do not necessarily have associated image captions at this

<p>These images are made by taking (in most cases)
multichannel radar images and assigning the colors red, green, and blue 
to three of the channels.  <strong><a href="kliucomp.html">

SIR-C/X-SAR radars illuminate Earth with microwaves allowing
detailed observations at any time, regardless of weather or
sunlight conditions.  SIR-C/X-SAR uses three microwave
wavelengths:  L-band (24 cm), C-band (6 cm) and X-band (3 cm). 
The multi-frequency data will be used by the international
scientific community to better understand the global environment
and how it is changing.  The SIR-C/X-SAR data, in conjunction
with aircraft and ground studies, will give scientists clearer
insights into those environmental changes which are caused by
nature and those changes which are induced by human activity.  
SIR-C was developed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.  X-SAR
was developed by the Dornier and Alenia Spazio companies for the
German space agency, Deutsche Agentur fur 
Raumfahrtangelegenheiten (DARA), and the Italian space agency,
Agenzia Spaziale Italiana (ASI).

<h1>SIR-C Standard Data
Products</h1>
<hr>
<p><strong><a href="proc2.23.95.html">List of data that
has been processed by JPL (Standard products)</a>. </strong> 
<p></p>
<hr>
<p>This list will be updated
periodically, and eventually you will be able to search for the lat/lon,
or site name that you are interested in.</p>
<p>The following is a description of what this list means :</p>
<p>
The SIR-C processor team produces two basic data products: survey and standard.
For a description of the standard data format, see <a href="../sample.html> this description of a sample data set that we make available</a>.  The
survey products are low resolution (100 meter), single frequency, single
polarization images of entire datatakes.  The standard data products are
calibrated, full resolution (~25 meters) scenes from datatakes.  All available
frequencies and polarizations are included in the digital data.  <p>
<p>
Participants in the Imaging Radar Outreach Program can request either one scene
to be processed or a duplicate of one existing standard data product.
SIR-C/X-SAR Science Team Members can order duplication of additional products.
Eventually, all standard data products will be available from the EROS Data
Center, in addition to the SIR-C survey data which are already available
<a href="http://sun1.cr.usgs.gov/landdaac/sir-c/sir-c.html">here</a>.<p>
<p>
The following list contains SIR-C standard data products are listed according
to the processing date.  The list will be updated every 3-4 weeks.  SIR-C data
is L-band 23 cm) and/or C-band (6 cm) data; X-SAR data s X-band (3 cm).  See
<a href="http://www.op.dlr.de/ne-hf/SRL.html">the DLR/X-SAR home page
</a> for information on X-SAR data.<p>
<p>
A few warnings about this list:<p>
<p>
1.  Not all of the data listed are fully calibrated.  Flight 1 data processed
before September 22, 1994 are not fully calibrated;  Flight 2 data processed
before February 1, 1995 are not fully calibrated.<p>
<p>
2.  Not all of the data products listed are available for distribution.  If a
requested product is unavailable, the requester will be notified and asked to
select an alternate product.<p>
<p>
<p>
The list contains the following information.<p>
<p>
<b>Datatake Number</b><p>
<b></b>Identifies the orbit on which the data were collected.  Note that many
datatake numbers were used on both flights of SIR-C/X-SAR.  See GMT Scene
Center for how to distinguish between data from the two flights.<p>
<p>
<b>Site Name</b><p>
<b></b>This identifies the site at which a particular datatake was aimed.  The
site name is also the name associated with the survey data.<p>
<p>
<b>Scene Name</b><p>
<b></b>The scene name provides for additional identification of the standard
data product.  For example, if a datatake Site Name is "Duke Forest, North
Carolina" but the pass covers all of the eastern United States, the scene
chosen for standard processing might have a Scene Name of "Atlanta, Georgia" to
distinguish it from other scenes processed along the same data pass.<p>
<p>
<b>GMT Scene Center</b><p>
<b></b>This is the Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) at the center of the standard
scene.  The GMT is read as follows:<p>
<p>
1994/101:21:19:25<p>
<p>
1994 is the year<p>
101 is the day<p>
21 is the hour<p>
19 is the minute<p>
25 is the second<p>
<p>
The GMT Scene Center can be used to distinguish between flight 1 and flight 2
data products.  	Flight 1 went from GMT day 100 through 111<p>
	Flight 2 went from GMT day 274 through 285<p>
<p>
The GMT can be used with the other information given to look at the survey
data, posted on the WorldWideWeb.  This allows a preview of the area shown in
the standard data product.  The GMT in the center of each survey segment is
also in the <b>dthdr.txt</b> file that accompanies survey data for each
datatake.<p>
<p>
<b>Latitude and Longitude at Scene Center (LatLon Center)</b><p>
<b></b>This is the latitude and longitude at the center of  the standard

<p>
<b>Processing Date</b><p>
<b></b>This is the date on which the standard data product was produced.<p>
<p>
<b>L PR# and C PR #</b><p>
<b></b>These are the processing run numbers for the L-band data and the C-band
data.  Not all standard data products have both frequencies of data.  One, or
both, processing run numbers can be distributed for a standard data product.<p>

Standard data products are described in terms of frames or scenes, where a
frame or scene is a small portion of a complete datatake.  Brief descriptions
of the standard data formats are below; for more information on the formats see
<em>HTTP://</em>  For information on obtaining the software needed to read the
CEOS-formatted tapes, see <em>HTTP://</em><p>
<p>
This describes the type of data product as follows:<p>
<p>
SLC	= Single Look Complex<p>
Full resolution, single look complex, deskewed, slant range image with natural
pixel spacing, distributed on CEOS-formatted 5 Gbyte 8 mm tape.  Frame size is
50 km (7.5 seconds) along track by the swath width.  These products have the
highest resolution and are intended for users who will calibrate the data
themselves.  Some of these data products are not calibrated.<p>
<p>
MLC	= Multilook Complex<p>
MLD	= Multilook Detected<p>
Both MLC and MLD images are distributed on CEOS-formatted 5 Gbyte 8 mm tapes,
multilook, complex polarimetric data, deskewed, ground range.  Frame size is
100 km along track (~15 seconds) by the swath width.<p>
<p>
GEO	= Geocoded<p>
Multi-look, CEOS-formatted frame image products.  Images are 100 km square in
UTM projection.<p>
<p>
RSD	= Reformatted Signal Data<p>
SAR signal data, with radar, platform, and processing parameters, 8 bit
unpacked and data window position (DWP) shifted data with original raw data
header.  Frame size is 100 km along track (~15 seconds) by the swath width.<p>
<p>
INF 	= Interferometric SLC<p>
CEOS-formatted data, frame image similar to SLC; the same Doppler parameters
applied to repeat pass data; no along track Doppler drifts or azimuth deskew.
No calibration parameters are applied to these data.  Frame size is 50 km (~7.5
seconds) along track by swath width.<p>

<p>
Dear Colleague,<p>
<p>
                We would like to thank you for your interest in imaging radar
data produced by the NASA/JPL imaging radar program.  We will endeavor to
satisfy your request for data if we are able to do so.  The following
information is required from you before we can begin this process:<p>
<p>
	1.  Project Title<p>
<p>
	2.  Where is your site? (Give center latitude and longitude and approximate
size of area.)<p>
<p>
	3.  What type of data are you interested in? (e.g., SIR-C, AIRSAR, or
TOPSAR)<p>
<p>
	4.  What are the objectives of your investigation?<p>
<p>
	5.  How do you think radar image data will benefit your study?<p>
<p>
	6.  Your full name, address, telephone and fax number and e-mail address.<p>
<p>
A one-page summary of your project is all that is required (a sample is
enclosed with this letter).  If you have sent us some of this information
before, please take the time to send it to us again.  It will greatly simplify
our operations if all requests are submitted in the same fashion.<p>
<p>
Once you've completed the one-page summary of your project, please send it by
fax or e-mail to:<p>
<p>
Radar Data Center<br>
Outreach Data Requests<br>
Fax #: (818) 393 2640<br>
e-mail: <a href="mailto:radar.data@jpl.nasa.gov">
<tt>radar.data@jpl.nasa.gov</tt></a><br>
<p>
In return we will:<p>
<p>
	1.  Check to see if your site was covered by the radar you specified (e.g.,
SIR-C, AIRSAR, TOPSAR).<br>
<p>
	2.  If your site was covered during either of the SIR-C missions, we will
email you the number(s) of the data takes that cover your site.  The survey
data (low-resolution) and precision data products for these data takes are posted on a World Wide Web site
at the EROS Data Center at URL:<a
href="http://sun1.cr.usgs.gov/landdaac/sir-c/sir-c.html/">
<tt>http://sun1.cr.usgs.gov/landdaac/sir-c/sir-c.html/</tt></a>.  Coverage maps are
also posted.  If you are not able to access the files over the internet, please
contact the EDC customer service desk (605 594 6116) with the data take
information.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
	In order to look at the SIR-C survey data over the World Wide Web you will
need access to the Internet.  The  survey data are posted as both image data
files (~1500 Kb) and as browse data files (~150 Kb) and can be downloaded 
directly through the Web.<p>
<p>
	3.  We will send you a frame processing request for SIR-C data.  You will need
to identify the exact center of your site within the survey image and submit
the frame processing request (together with a copy of your original one-page
project summary) to obtain a full resolution product.<p>
<p>
	4.  When we receive your request, it will be placed in our processing queue.
Please be aware that it may take some time for your frame product to be
processed (between four and six months is typical at present).  Orders will be
restricted to one frame product per user.<p>
<p>
	5.  When your SIR-C request has been completed, we will send you a copy of the
digital data on 8 mm tape (5 GByte capacity), an 8 1/2 x 11 photographic print,
and a detailed format description.<p>
<p>
	6.  If your request is for AIRSAR or TOPSAR data and the data over your site
have been processed, we will send you a copy of the full-resolution AIRSAR
digital data set on 8 mm tape (5 Gbyte capacity), an 8 1/2 x 11 photographic
print, and a detailed format description document.  There will be a nominal
charge ($150-$250 US) for duplication of AIRSAR data.<p>
<p>
Please be aware that NASA's data policy does not under any circumstance permit
exclusive rights to data acquired by NASA for a NASA-funded program.  Thus, the
radar data over your site may also be distributed to other requesters.<p>
<p>
To find out more about radar data or the NASA/JPL imaging radar program, we
strongly suggest that you take a look at our NASA/JPL Imaging Radar Home Page.

SAMPLE ONE-PAGE PROJECT SUMMARY<p>
<p>
<b>Title:</b>  Searching for signs of former habitation in the Mojave Desert,
California<p>
<p>
<b>Site Name and Location:</b> Death Valley, CA (36.629N, -117.069W). Area is
approximately 50km x 50km in size<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Data Type:</b>  SIR-C<p>
<p>
<b>Objectives:</b>  In the Mojave Desert, numerous Native American tribes
flourished during wetter climatic periods.  We hope to use radar images to map
previously known and unknown burial and settlement sites within the Death
Valley National Park area.  During the California Gold Rush in the
mid-nineteenth century, many gold excavation and mining boom towns were
established and later abandoned.  We hope to use radar images to identify the
boundaries of these abandoned mines and 'ghost towns' from space.<p>
<p>
<b>How radar will benefit our study:</b>  Our site is in one of the driest
areas in the United States.  The ability of radar to penetrate very dry soils
may help us to locate the remains of buried settlements there.  The sensitivity
of radar to soil wetness may enable us to locate buried water sources, which
may be associated with former settlements.  Radar's sensitivity to the physical
structure of the surface being imaged may also be useful in detecting man-made
artifacts, such as the foundations of buildings, or former rail tracks.<p>

</b><p>
<p>
The NASA/JPL AIRSAR is a side-looking imaging radar system which utilizes the
Synthetic Aperture principle to obtain high resolution images which represent
the radar backscatter of the imaged surface at different frequencies and
polarizations.  The image coordinates are usually slant or ground range and
azimuth.  Slant range is a measure of the radial distance of the image object
from the radar.  Ground range is a measure of the distance of the object from a
point directly below the aircraft.  Near range in the images is closest to the
aircraft and far range is furthest away.  The azimuth dimension in the images
is parallel to the line described by the track of the aircraft (see figure).
The spatial resolution of the AIRSAR images, which determines how far apart two
objects have to be in order to separate them in the image, is on the order of
12 x 12 meters.  Note that this is not the same as the range or azimuth pixel
spacing which is contained in the variable format header of the AIRSAR data.<p>
<p>
The information contained in each pixel of the AIRSAR data represents the radar
backscatter for all possible combinations of horizontal and vertical transmit
and receive polarizations (i.e. HH, HV, VH, and VV).  The data is in compressed
Stokes matrix format, which has 10 bytes per pixel. From this data format it is
possible to synthesize a number of different radar backscatter measurements.
The <u>MacSigma0</u> and <u>MacMultiView</u> software packages allow the
synthesis of images and analysis of data for some of the more important radar
backscatter measurements for AIRSAR data. Each pixel contains information about
the radar backscatter for a single frequency only.  Other image files may be
available which contain information about the radar backscatter at different
frequencies.  The radar backscatter measurement is a strong function of
incidence angle, which is defined as:<p>
<IMG SRC="/desc/gif/AIRSdesc1.gif"><p>
	<p>
where h is the altitude of the aircraft (typically about 8 km), R0 is near
range in the image (typically 8-10 km), [[Delta]]R is the size of the (slant)
range pixels in meters and i is the line number of the object in the image.
The incidence angle is defined with respect to the normal to the Earth's
surface.  The above expression is strictly valid for a flat Earth only.  Radar
backscatter usually has a tendency to decrease as the incidence angle
increases.  This effect can often be seen in AIRSAR images, where the incidence
angle is typically in the range of 0 to 70 degrees.  The smaller incidence
angles correspond to near range in the AIRSAR data, while the larger incidence
angles correspond to far range.<p>
<p>
Much of the data produced by the AIRSAR is now calibrated, so that the radar
backscatter measurements are in normalized radar cross section format
(m<sup>2</sup>/m<sup>2</sup>) or [[sigma]]<sup>0</sup>. [[sigma]]<sup>0</sup>
is the radar cross section (measured in m<sup>2</sup>) normalized by the area
of the measurement, which in this case is the pixel area in square meters.
Results obtained using uncalibrated AIRSAR data should be treated with caution.
If a trihedral corner reflector is deployed within the imaged scene and a few
simple measurements about that reflector are known, then there are facilities
in the <u>MacSigma0</u> and <u>POLCAL</u> software to lend assistance.<p>
<p>
The direct measurements of radar backscatter which are made by the AIRSAR
systems are the elements of the scattering matrix: Shh, Shv, Svh and Svv, which
represent the backscatter for each pixel in response to the 4 different
combinations of H and V transmit and receive polarizations.  Shv is the
scattering matrix term for H transmit, V receive, for example.  The scattering
matrix measurements are complex numbers, with amplitude and phase.<p>
<p>
The Shv and Svh measurements are equal by the principle of backscatter
reciprocity.  In AIRSAR data, only the Shv term is retained.  The AIRSAR data
is issued in compressed Stokes matrix format.  An intermediate step in forming
the Stokes matrix for each pixel is to form the cross-products:<p>
<p>
<IMG SRC="/desc/gif/AIRSdesc2.gif"><p>
These cross-products can be recovered from the Stokes matrix data format, which
can be considered as a type of coding.  The first three are 
<IMG SRC="/desc/gif/AIRSdesc3.gif">
measurements.  The last three are complex numbers, with amplitude expressed in 
<IMG SRC="/desc/gif/AIRSdesc4.gif">
and a phase term which can be expressed in degrees.  The phase is between -180
and 180 degrees.  In displaying the ShhSvv* term using <u>MacSigma0</u>, for
example, the amplitude is displayed as a grey scale, the phase as a color
representation.<p>
<p>
Experience with AIRSAR data has shown that the first four of the above
cross-products contain the most information about the imaged surface.  <p>
<p>
The reader interested in more background information on radar polarimetry is
referred to the papers listed.<p>

<p>
The compressed Stokes matrix data format is composed of 10 bytes per pixel
preceded by two ASCII headers, the variable format header and the "old" header.
Both the variable format header and the "old" header are composed of
50-character fields where one character is saved per byte. In general, a
compressed Stokes matrix data file looks like the following:<p>

represents a right-justified real number, and `CCCCCCCC' represents a character
string.  The number of bytes per sample (field 5) must be 10 and fields 11 and
13 must point to the "old" header (described below) and the beginning of the
data respectively.  <p>
<p>
The contents of fields 14 through 16 vary depending on which AIRSAR processor
was used and may not exist at all.  It was originally intended that they would
be used to keep track of the relative location of the data set being examined
with respect to the "original" data set.  <p>
<p>
The "old" header is composed of approximately 160 50-character fields and
contains information recorded during the acquisition of the data and
information added during correlation and possibly calibration.  In versions of
the SAR correlator prior to 1990,  this is the only header saved with each data
set (it is saved in the 1025th line of the file).  With the addition of the
variable format header, this header became the "old" header.<p>
<p>
The user header does not usually exist on data obtained direct from JPL.  <p>

2.7.3 --><title>ERS/JERS1 Description</title></head><body><b>ERS-1 and
JERS-1</b><p>
<p>
ERS-1 and JERS-1 are remote sensing satellites launched by the European Space
Agency and NASDA of Japan, respectively.  Both satellites carry Synthetic
Aperture Radar instruments which are used to image the Earth's surface.  The
<u>Alaska SAR Facility</u> (ASF) has an agreement with both Space Agencies to
receive data from these two sensors and process it into images.  ERS-1 data can
only be received within the viewing range of the ASF downlink antenna, which
covers the state of Alaska, the Bering Strait, North-West Canada, the Gulf of
Alaska, and the ice sheet up to the North Pole.  JERS-1 data can be received by
ASF for any part of the world. Data for each sensor can also be ordered direct
from the European (<u>ESRIN</u>) or Japanese (<u>NASDA EOC</u>) data
distribution facilities. Some restrictions and costs may apply.<p>
<p>
The ERS-1 SAR is a C-band (6 cm wavelength) instrument, operating with VV
polarization.  It's orbit height is about 800 km and the range of incidence
angles within a typical image is fixed at between 20 degrees for near range and
26 degrees for range range.  A typical image area is 80 x 80 km.<p>
<p>
The JERS-1 SAR is an L-band (24 cm wavelength) instrument, operating with HH
polarization.  It's orbit height is about 570 km and the range of incidence
angles within a typical image is fixed at between 32 degrees at near range and
38 degrees at far range.  A typical image area is 80 x 75 km.<p>
<p>
The ERS-1 SAR was designed primarily to observe features on the ocean, such as
waves or ice sheets.  The wavelength and incidence angle selected for ERS-1 are
also good for observing some, but not all, features on land, such as
mountainous terrain or agricultural fields.  The JERS-1 SAR was designed
primarily to collect data over land which would be useful to geologists.  The
wavelength, incidence angle and polarization selected for JERS-1 are not ideal
for observing ocean features.<p>
<p>
ASF distributes hi-res (high resolution) and lo-res (low-resolution) data
products. The hi-res data product has 8192 by 8192 12.5 x 12.5 m pixels, with
25-30m resolution and takes up 64 Megabytes of disk space.  The lo-res ASF data
product  has 1024 by 1024 100 x 100 meter pixels, with 200 meter resolutionand
takes up 1 Megabyte of disk space.  Many samples (about 256) have been averaged
to produce each pixel in the lo-res data products.  Each pixel represents
normalized radar cross section ([[sigma]]<sup>0</sup>) for either L-band HH or
C-band VV at the appropriate incidence angle. The lo-res ASF products can be
displayed by the <u>MacSigma0</u> program.<p>
<p>
The main difference between the lo-res ERS-1 and JERS-1 images versus those
from an airborne system like the AIRSAR is the size of the imaged area, which
is much larger for the satellite images.  In addition, the resolution of the
lo-res data is much larger than for the AIRSAR data.  Also, the range of
incidence angles for the satellite data is only about 6 degrees across the
imaged swath, while for the AIRSAR the range of incidence angles is about 40
degrees for a typical image.  This means that the backscatter variation with
incidence angle across the swath is more pronounced for the AIRSAR data.  The
geometry for collecting satellite SAR data is similar to the geometry
illustrated in the last section for the AIRSAR.  The height of the platform,
however, is significantly different.  Since the AIRSAR platform (a DC-8
aircraft) flies at around 10 km altitude, to image a swath 10 km wide, an
incidence angle variation of about 40 degrees is typical.  For the satellite
platforms, with altitudes greater than 500 km, an 80 km swath width can be
observed with only a 6 degree variation in incidence angle across the swath.<p>

<p>
<p>
An ERS-1 or JERS-1 data set processed at the Alaska SAR Facility contains three
files:  the data file itself, a trailer file, and a leader file.  The data file
contains a small header and the data itself.  In the data, there is generally
some number of bytes at the beginning of each line which are ignored.  This
number is typically 12.  The following is a typical data file:<p>
<p>
<p>
	
<IMG SRC="gif/ERSJERS1desc1.gif"><p>
<p>
<p>
The leader and trailer files are both of the same format.  This format is
called the CEOS format.  In this format, files contain a sequence of "records"
which are saved end-to-end.  Each "record" is a particular type.  Encoded in
the beginning of each record are the record type and record length.  The
parameters contained within each "record" and their specific locations depend
on the record type.  Unfortunately, the encoded record type is not consistent.
The best method of locating records is by using the File Descriptor Record
which is always the first record in either file.  This record contains
information about the other records contained within the file.  Also, the
sequence of "records" is sometimes not actually stored end-to-end but may be
separated by an extra byte.  The <u>MacSigma0</u> program was written to check
and compensate for this extra byte.<p>
<p>
The leader and trailer files are identified as ".ldr"  (or ".LDR") and ".trl"
(or ".TRL", ".tlr", or ".TLR") files.  In other words, if the data file is
called "Beaufort", then the trailer file should be either "Beaufort.trl" or
"Beaufort.TRL".  If the data file is called "Bonanza Creek.dat", then the
trailer file is expected to be either "Bonanza Creek.trl", "Bonanza Creek.TRL",
"Bonanza Creek.tlr", or "Bonanza Creek.TLR".  <p>

<TITLE>How to Get Radar Data</TITLE>
<H1>How to Get Radar Data</H1>
<HR>
<p>Most of the <strong>SIR-C Survey Data</strong> from SRL-1 and SRL-2
are now on-line at the <a
href="http://sun1.cr.usgs.gov/landdaac/sir-c/sir-c.html">the Eros Data
Center (EDC)</a>!  
SIR-C Survey Data is low resolution (50 meter pixel spacing), single
frequency (usually L-band) and single polarization (usually HH) byte data.
Even though this data is not the highest resolution, and is only
single channel (just a black and white image), this is a very useful
resource. <strong>It is available free, it is available now, and it is 
available
over the internet!</strong>
</p><p>
If you need either better resolution (up to 5 meter pixel spacing), or
more channels (such as was used to make the color pictures in the picture
gallery), then you can request that data be processed for you (for free!)
by becoming part of our
<strong> <a href="outreach/info.html">outreach program!</a></strong>  
In order for you to get data
processed, you will have to justify the need.
</p><p>
Here is a list of <a href="datasource.html">addresses, and in some cases telephone, fax, or email
addresses</a> to contacts for imaging radar data from a multitude of
missions. <img src="gif/thumb/new.gif">
</p><p>
(of course, there are also the sample radar
 <A HREF="radarimages.html">images</A> 
that are available, as well as the pictures in the 
<a href="pic.html">picture gallery</a>).
</P>
<p>I have put together a <a href="sample.html">
sample data set of Death Valley </a>.  This sample
data set has all three SIR-C high precision data formats 
(called "SLC", "MLC", and "MLD"). (Survey data are just byte images). 
With the
accompanying documentation to help them along, 
I hope that software developers will
incorporate this data format into their image display and analysis
programs.
This data
set is available on 8mm tape.  (The SLC
data is way to large to be made available on line, but I may put some
MLC and MLD on line).  
I also hope to put  a similar package on-line containing X-SAR and
AIRSAR data.

<H1>Advantage of Multichannel Radar Data</H1>
<HR>
<P>
The <a href="pic.html">picture gallery </a>contains nice looking images that have been obtained
from imaging radar data.  However, in order to make these nice looking
images, scientists start out (in most cases) with black and white 
images from different
wavelengths and polarizations, and combine them to make a color image.
</p>
<p>
For instance, below are the three black and white images of different
frequencies and polarizations of SAR data from SIR-C that were used to
make a nice color image of the Kliuchevskoi Volcano in Russia:
</p>
<p>
These three images (L-band Horizontal transmit, Horizontal receive (LHH),
L-band Horizontal transmit, Vertical receive (LHV), and
C-band Horizontal transmit, Vertical receive (CHV) )
</p>
LHH<img align=top src="gif/kliu_lhh.gif">
<p>
LHV<img align=top src="gif/kliu_lhv.gif">
<p>
CHV<img align=top src="gif/kliu_chv.gif">
<p>
may be combined to form :
</p>
<img align=middle src="gif/kliucolor.gif">
<p>
by assigning Red to the LHH image, Green to the LHV image, and Blue to
the CHV image.</p><p>
This is what the optical image taken from the Space Shuttle looks
like...</p>
<img align=middle src="gif/opticalkliu.gif">
<p>
And, here is what a survey image looks like that you can get from the
EDC over the World Wide Web...

<p>
<img align=middle src="gif/kliu15s.gif">


</p>
<p>As can be seen, a lot is gained by having a multichannel radar
system.</p>

<P></P>
<p>
It is the desire of NASA and the JPL imaging radar program to make radar
data more accessible to new users.  There are several ways that we are
attempting to do this:
</p>
<ol>  
<li>Send us a letter or email to be part of our outreach program.  <a
href="outreachletter.html">Read
this letter for what information we need. </a>
If we did not
collect SIR-C data from your site, we will check if there is any AIRSAR
data that you could use.  AIRSAR has collected SAR data at many sites
around the world, and the quality is similar to SIR-C data quality.
<P></P>
<li>Before requesting data, <a href="/scienceapps/modetable.html">read
the description of the data collection modes</a></li>
</p><p>
<li><a href="../sample.html">Sample SIR-C data is available on 8 mm tape</a>.  
This sample data set is
designed for software developers, so that they may incorporate the SIR-C
data formats into their data analysis programs.  It may also be useful to
other users who would like an understanding of the data formats, for
coding their own software, or for gaining experience working with radar
data before acquiring their own.  The data set is of Death Valley,
California, USA.</li>
<P></P>
<li><a href="../software.html">software for reading and decompressing 
SIR-C format data</a>.  This
software is available through a software license from JPL, and may now be
obtained via anonymous ftp to licensed users.  This software, in addition
to reading and decompressing the SIR-C data, may also be used to create
images of any polarization, to average down the data, read the headers,
and convert between SIR-C and AIRSAR data formats.  (AIRSAR is an airborne
SAR that has imaged sites around the world).</a></li>
<P></P>
<li><a href="../coverage.html">Coverage Maps</a>
Coverage maps showing where over the Earth the Space Shuttle SRL
         missions collected data from. New! The coverage map for Seasat,
SIR-A, and
         SIR-B has been added here.</li>

<strong>Flash! here is the fix to the Oct. 3 1994 bug described below, and a fix
to another bug (in the undocumented program that will save as a floating
point image one channel of data)</strong>  
<p>
Sometimes, the info program was bombing when getting information about a
scene (it did not always bomb, but often enough to be a problem).  This
part of the software is not critical for anything, but here is the
fix...(for software tape release 1.4)
(thanks to Greg Sassenrath
of The Aerospace Corporation)
</p>
<ol>
<li>edit the sinfo.f file in the directory for both the cvert and dcomp
software</li>
<li>change the declaration of the variables hardvers and softvers from
real to
character*27 (at line 46 and 47 of the file):</li>
<br>
<strong>from:</strong>
<ul>
<li>real hardvers</li>
<li>real softvers</li>
</ul>
<strong>to :</strong>
<ul>
<li>character*27 hardvers </li>
<li>character*27 softvers </li>
</ul>
<li>save the changes</li>
<li> recompile and link all the software using the make files </li>
</ol>
<p>
Here is the correction to another software bug, this for an undocumented
program in the byte_image (dcomp) software...without this correction, the
floating point image will come out as all zero's</p>
<ol>
<li>edit the sfloat_image.f file in the directory for the dcomp software</li>
<li><strong>after line 474</strong>, which should be </li>
<ul><li>ncnt = ncnt + 1</li></ul>
<li><strong>add </strong> the following line</li>
<ul>
<li>out(ncnt)=tp</li>

<li><strong>Bug: cvert and dcomp software.</strong>  
When reading the ascii headers for <strong>MLC</strong> data, sometimes when getting
information about the scene, the program crashes.  I have not yet had
time to determine the cause.  However, this step is not necessary to
convert or decompress the data. If it crashes, skip that step (type out
the ascii header files instead) , and
continue...</li>

<li>added vaxfc manual (however, this software is not currently

<HR>
<p>  There is a new tape (as of April 17, 1995) containing the SIR-C software.  This tape has
the lastest versions of the CEOS_READER, dcomp and cvert software.  The
current tape should say <strong>Software Tape Release 2.1</strong> .
The software is also available by ftp.</p>
<p>We also now have SIR-C utility programs (written in IDL).

<p>See a picture of the 
<a href="../airsar.gif">NASA DC-8 aircraft </a>

This aircraft is currently based out of NASA/AMES.
If you look carefully, you can see antennas mounted on the

<h1>Topsar images - hot off the processor</h1>
<hr size=5>
<p>For the time being, as an experiment, the AIRSAR group will be
supplying TOPSAR images from their airborne interferometric SAR.  </p>
<p>Each scene will be presented as :</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Topography </strong>
<ul>
<li>relative vertical accuracy of
the data is about 1 meter in non-mountainous areas</li>
<li>relative vertical accuracy is worse than 1 meter in mountainous areas</li>
<li>for the image display of topography, the color contour interval may
be determined by the scale bar at the bottom of the image, and is
much more coarse than the accuracy of the data.</li>
<li>C-band data is used to calculate topography.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<li><strong>SAR backscatter</strong>
<ul>
<li>red = P-band total power</li>
<li>green = L-band total power</li>
<li>blue = C-band VV</li>
<li>topography is used to calibrate the data</li>
</ul>
</ol>
<p>For the time being, the data will be sorted solely by TS number,
which is just a number indicating the order of processing.</p>
<p>For more information about these data products, please contact Jakob
vanZyl at 
<a href="mailto:jacobv@blacks.jpl.nasa.gov">jacobv@blacks.jpl.nasa.gov</a>
</p>
<p>In the near future, we will make these images sortable by latitude
and longitude.  The latitude and longitude of these images may be found
ON the image.</p>

<b>SPACEBORNE IMAGING RADAR FOR MONITORING THE EARTH'S ENVIRONMENT - AN
EDUCATIONAL PACKAGE </b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b>A Freeman and K. Crandall</b><p>
<b>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</b><p>
<b>California Institute of Technology</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>	NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory has produced an educational package
entitled 'The SIR-C Education Program' (SIR-CED), designed as a two- to
three-week module for middle school and high school students. The SIR-CED
package has also been used to teach college-level undergraduates, particularly
those taking non-science majors, and by engineers and scientists with an
interest in radar imaging, but who are not necessarily imaging radar
specialists. The package includes two educational CD-ROMs called the SIR-C
Education Pre-launch CD-ROM, Volume ID SIRCED01 and the SIR-C Education
Post-launch CD-ROM, Volume ID SIRCED02. In the SIR-CED program students receive
some training in understanding, displaying and analyzing radar images, then may
choose their own research project to explore further. Students are given access
to the same data and data analysis tools used by scientists who utilize radar
images in their studies. <p>

<b>SIRCED02</b><p>
<b></b><p>
	The SIRCED02 CD-ROM contains actual results and data from the two SIR-C/X-SAR
missions. Some new features included on this second SIR-CED CD-ROM are movie
visualizations from the missions and the data produced during them, a 'roadmap'
to the CD-ROM which uses the Mosaic browse tool, a simplified top level
directory structure, plus a sample project. Otherwise, the organization of the
second SIR-CED CD-ROM is very similar to the first. To access the CD-ROM,
you'll need a computer with a CD-ROM drive connected to it and properly
installed. The SIR-CED CD-ROMs can be opened on Macintosh, PC, SUN and Indigo
computer systems. Place the CD-ROM in the caddy of your CD drive, then gently
insert the caddy into the drive itself, and off you go. On the Macintosh
computer, when you open up the SIRCED02 CD-ROM, you should see four folders and
two files arranged something like this:<p>
<p>
<IMG SRC="gif/SIR-CED02intro4.gif"><p>
<p>
<i>Top level file organization of the SIRCED02 CD-ROM</i><p>
<i></i><p>
On a PC or Unix computer, when you open the CD you'll see a directory listing
something like this:<p>
<p>
<u>Name	Type	</u><p>
/Data	<i>Folder</i><p>
/Document	<i>Folder</i>	<p>
/Roadmap	<i>Folder</i><p>
<i></i>/Software	<i>Folder</i><p>
<i></i>ReadmeTx.txt	<i>text file (ASCII)</i><p>
ReadmeWd.txt	<i>text file (Microsoft Word)</i><p>
<p>
<p>
The contents of these files and folders, and how to access the information they
contain, are described below. <p>
<p>
<b>Roadmap</b> - the contents of this <i>folder</i>  let you take a look at the
SIRCED02 CD-ROM using a browse tool called Mosaic developed by NCSA. If you are
a regular World Wide Web user, you will probably have heard of Mosaic, which is
a very powerful tool for accessing information (including text, images, videos,
sound) on the Web. Mosaic can be run in local mode, to access information
stored on your computer disk, or, as we have done on, a CD-ROM. We have
provided versions of the Mosaic 'road map' for SIRCED02 for Macintosh, PC and
Unix systems.  These can be found in the folders <b>Mac</b>, <b>PC</b> and
<b>Unix</b> inside the <b>Roadmap</b> folder. <p>
<p>
<b>ReadmeWd.txt</b> - this <i>text file</i>  describes the organization of the
SIR-CED CD-ROM in more detail. Open this file first or take a look at the road
map provided in the <b>Roadmap</b> folder. If you have the program <b>Microsoft
Word</b> (5.0 or higher recommended for the Macintosh, 6.0 for PCs), you can
open this file using it.<p>
<p>
<b>ReadmeTx.txt</b> - this <i>text file</i>  describes the organization of the
SIR-CED CD-ROM in more detail. This file is an MS-DOS text file version of the
ReadmeWd.txt file. It can be opened using the program <b>Teachtext</b> on the
Macintosh (provided) or using almost any Word Processing program on PC, SUN or
Indigo computers.<p>
<p>
<b>Document</b> - this <i>folder</i>  contains a complete set of the documents
which form part of the overall SIR-CED package. They are a Teacher's Resource
Guide, Lesson Plans and Presentation Slides, which are in separate folders
labeled Teachers, Lessons and Slides. All of these documents were written in
Microsoft Word for the Macintosh (v. 5.1).<p>
<p>
<b>Software</b> - this <i>folder</i>  contains the software for the Macintosh,
PC, SUN and Indigo computers provided with the SIR-CED package, organized into
folders which are labeled accordingly.<p>
<p>
<b>Data</b> - this <i>folder</i>  contains all the image data files used in the
SIR-CED program. It is arranged into five sub-folders:<p>
<p>
	<b>Mods1to4</b>: 	contains all the data files referred to in the Lesson
Plans<p>
<p>
	<b>Supersit</b>:   	contains all the image data for the SIR-C supersites<p>
<p>
	<b>Othersit</b>:   	contains all the image data for other sites of interest<p>
<p>
	<b>FULLSIZE</b>:  	contains some full size (12MByte) files from NASA/JPL's
AIRSAR for selected scenes<p>
<p>
	<b>gifs</b>:	contains GIF file format versions of the PICT files found in
folders Mods1to4, Supersit and Othersit<p>
<b>How to use the SIR-CED CD-ROMs</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b> The SIR-CED CD-ROMs can be opened using a CD reader on
Macintosh, SUN,
and IBM PC computers. They contain a User's guide, a guide for teachers,
lesson
plans, and images from sites all around the world covered by SIR-C.
Software
for displaying the images provided on all three supported computer
platforms is
included on the CD. The comprehensive data set incorporated into the
SIR-CED
CD-ROM may also be useful for some engineers and scientists, who wish to
explore the potential of radar observation. The CDs are designed so that
they
can be used separately, so you don't have to have both of them to begin
using
the SIR-CED program. You'll find a description below of the contents of
each of
the two SIR-CED CD-ROMs, plus some frequently asked questions.<p>
