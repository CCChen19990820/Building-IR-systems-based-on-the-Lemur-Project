<h2>SIR-C/X-SAR STATUS REPORT FOR THE PERIOD ENDING DAY 2,
0 HRS  MISSION ELAPSED TIME</h2>
<hr>
<p></p>
<p>SUMMARY- The radars continue to perform very well, with no new
anomalies. The radar panels are running 20 degrees F warmer than last
mission due to the Beta angle, still well within the operating range
of the panels.  Several Built In test Equipment (BITE) engineering
data takes were cut short  due to sequence timing problems. Two data
takes were received during the last 24 hours which had the potential
for mission one to mission two interference fringes. The first, a
Mammoth Mt., California data take was processed, but no fringes  were
found. The second one, a data take over the Galapagos Islands has not
completed processing yet. The target of opportunity, the Kliuchevskoi
volcano, was added to the timeline and successfully acquired, down
linked and processed.</p>

<h2>SIR-C/X-SAR DAILY STATUS REPORT TWO
FOR THE PERIOD FROM DAY 0.04 HOURS THROUGH
DAY 1, 00 HOURS, MISSION ELAPSED TIME</h2>
<Hr>
<p>
SUMMARY- On orbit checkout continued as planned. Engineering checkout of
the
radars was completed with a calibration of the X-SAR mechanical tilt
mechanism at
09 hr 38 min MET The first science data take, Raco, Michigan, was
carried out at
Day 0, 07 HRS, 38 MIN. Data take operations have been routine, with data
flowing
the realtime X-SAR processor and the near real time processor at JPL as
planned.
The first "change image", a comparison of SRL-1 and SRL-2 data acquired
over
Raco, Michigan was completed and sent to the POCC. 
</p><p>
A toal of nine tapes have been recorded, seven SIR-C tapes and two X-SAR
tapes.. 
</p><p>
A significant volcanic eruption plume has been seen over the Kamchatka
peninsula.
Replanning of observations is underway to view this target of
opportunity at all three
radar frequencies.. 
</p><p>
Current projection of the orbit suggests that the opportunity to do
flight one to flight
two interferometry has been lengthened by 12 to 24 hours. This increased
period of
time is due to the excellent launch performance of the shuttle. 
</p><p>
<hr>
ANOMALIES- C band, center leaf, panel 6 vertical polarization high power
amplifiers are no longer operational due to a shorted 11 volt power
supply. This
amounts to the loss of one quarter of the functionality of one of the
eighteen C band
panels. Telemetry data from the Payload Data Interleaver and the
telemetry from the
Built In Test Equipment (BITE) disagree as to the number of transmit
/receive
modules affected. Further analysis will be required to understand this
discrepancy.
The result of this anomaly is that the C band vertical polarization
transmitted power
level will be slightly reduced. Since the low noise amplifiers in that
panel are
operational, the C band receive sensitivity is not affected. No
corrective action is
needed or planned. 

</p><p>
PHRR-2 showed a fault when attempting to post amble. The fault was
cleared and
the post amble retried, resulting in the same fault condition. The tape
was swapped
out and normal operations were resumed. This is still under study.

<h2>SIR-C/X-SAR DAILY STATUS REPORT ONE
FOR THE PERIOD FROM LAUNCH 
THROUGH DAY 0, 04  HOURS MISSION ELAPSED TIME</h2>
<hr>
<p>
SUMMARY-Nominal launch occurred at GMT day 273 11:16:00 as planned.
Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS) burn number one was not needed. OMS 2
was
executed on plan to put the orbiter into the desired orbit. Payload bay
doors were
opened at 01 hrs 29 min. Payload activation proceeded as planned,
starting with the
pallet activation, MAPS, APL, SIR-C and X-SAR power-up operations. 
</p><p>
The X-SAR antenna was moved out of the stowed position and operated
normally. 

</p><p>
The initial orbit achieved was so close to the desired orbit that the
first , planned trim
burn was not necessary. ANOMALIES- PHRR-3 showed a tape fault condition
when the cassette was threaded to prepare for the first recorder
operation called a
post amble operation. The post amble operation writes a set of records
for
engineering purposes. The recorder was reset and began normal operation.
The
problem is felt to be due to a bit of slack which developed during the
launch phase,
with no implications on the mission operations. 

</p><p>
When the X-SAR was activated, it was found that the on board command
memory
was empty. The commands for the first hours of flight operations were
uplinked to
restore the memory contents. Operation has been as expected since then.

<b></b><p>
	Gentlemen, <p>
<p>
	We have calibrated a couple more scenes. Neither had corner reflectors in
them, so we used the default values from the first mission. Here are a few
observations:<p>
<p>
1.  The C-Band VH/HV amplitude ratio does seem to consistently have dropped by
about 0.5-0.6dB. This suggests that the V-pol transmit problem you are seeing
with one panel has an effect which is observable during processing (and should
be correctable during processing).<p>
<p>
2.  Other than the above, the system seems to be behaving itself - the
cross-talk, channel amplitude and phase balances are where we expect then to
be. <p>
<p>
3.  We still have no further insight into whether the L-band system gain lost
2.2dB  or not. If it did, it occurred in both H and V channels. What do the
BITE tests say? Can you compare them with the first mission?<p>
<p>
4.  Our next chance to look at the 2.2dB L-band question should come tomorrow
when we look at the rain forest near Manaus, which we expect to have stable
RCS. Our only other possibility is data-take 62.21 over Oberpfaffenhofen which
is scheduled for playback and has corner reflectors. This is the only other
data-take with corner reflectors in the Playback plan for SRL-2. It would be
nice to see a couple more before Endeavour (with a U) lands.<p>
<p>
Are we in Heaven or are we in Hell? No, just calibrating the SRL. The CAL
Team.<p>

<b>Data Take ID:		14.2 (Oetztal) and 20.2 (Prince Albert)</b><p>
<b>Time:			2:40 pm PST, October 1, 1994</b><p>
<b></b><p>
	Gentlemen, <p>
<p>
	DT 14.2 is the first data-take we received data for after the reported problem
with the C-Band panel  V-pol HPA. Unfortunately, it's a dual-pol (HV,VV)
downlink, so we can't draw too many conclusions, but here goes anyway:<p>
<p>
1.  The raw data QA plots (histograms, range and azimuth spectra, range plots)
look OK.<p>
<p>
2.  Impulse response functions and measures (resolution, ISLR, PSLR) are within
specifications.<p>
<p>
	DT 20.2 is a 20 MHz BW quad-pol playback (so was DT 6.2 over Raco, MI). We
looked at the average value of the VH/HV amplitude ratio and got the following
results:<p>


<pre>
                    DT 6.2              DT 20.2 (SRL-2)     SRL-1 Average       
      C-Band        .85                 0.37                1.0 (+ .17)         
      L-Band        -.81                -0.75               -.81 (+ .13)        

</pre>
<p>
The numbers in parentheses represent the range of observed values for  Flight 1
(i.e. 3-sigma). The significance of the above is that L-band didn't change,
while the C-Band results did if we compare DT 20.2 with DT 6.2 or the results
for the first mission. One possible interpretation of these results is that the
V-transmit EIRP went down by 0.5 --&gt; 0.6dB. The loss of V-pol transmit on
one panel only should lead to a (17/18)**3 = -0.7dB drop in the V-pol EIRP
according to Fuk Li, which is consistent with the above. If this is correct, we
should be able to detect the failed panel during processing and apply an
appropriate correction to the data.<p>
<p>
<p>
We seek 'em here, we seek 'em there, we seek those few-tenths of a dB
everywhere. <p>

<b>Time:			7:30 A PST, September 30, 1994</b><p>
<b></b><p>
	Gentlemen, <p>
<p>
	We have succeeded in calibrating the L-band and C-band data from the Raco 6.2
data-take. For the record, the time was 15:15 hours into the mission. Here are
the results of our analysis of this data:<p>
<p>
1.  Impulse response quality same as last time(i.e. better than
specifications).<p>
2.  Polarization channels are registered to within 1/8 of a pixel (within
specifications).<p>
3.  The images corresponding to the two frequencies are offset from each other
by ~1 pixel. This is the same as for the SRL-1 images and can (and should) be
fixed in the processor.<p>
4.  Location error as determined by comparing corner reflector locations with
image frame coordinates are a few kilometers in both directions. There are too
many sources of error to say anything definitive about this at present.<p>
5.  Cross-talk is less than -30dB at L-band and less than -40dB at C-band (as
before).<p>
6.  We calibrated the C-band data using corner reflectors. If we had used the
numbers we derived for the first mission instead we would have achieved almost
identical results (to within a few degrees and a few-tenths of a dB).<p>
7.  We also calibrated the L-band data using corner reflectors. If we had used
the numbers we derived for the first mission instead we would have achieved
almost identical results (to within a few degrees and a few-tenths of a dB) for
channel balance in amplitude and phase. The exception to this is the absolute
calibration factor, which differs by 2.2 dB from SRL-1. The explanation for
this is either that the L-band gain is down overall by ~2.2dB for the SRL-2
data-take or that the corner reflectors were deployed better in September
rather than in April. We prefer the latter explanation for now, but we'll keep
you posted.<p>
8.  We have two fully functioning, calibratable polarimetric radar systems
again.<p>
<p>
Deja vu all over again. The CAL Team.<p>

	Gentlemen, <p>
<p>
	Here is a summary of the QA plots generated by Jeff Levison for the DT 5.2
L-Band and DT 6.2 Playbacks. Sample plots are attached:<p>
<p>
1.  Range spectra look good (20 MHz bandwidth). Caltone visible at around 5
MHz. <p>
2.  Raw data histograms exhibit no signs of saturation<p>
3.  Echo monitor looks as expected.<p>
4.  Azimuth spectra look good and coaligned.  <p>
5.  HV/VH amplitude ratios and phase differences (extracted from image data)
within 0.15dB and 8 degrees of the values for L-band and C-band at 20 MHz
during SRL-1. This is a good indication that the radar is up and running pretty
much the same as before.<p>

Quality is Job 1. The CAL Team.<p>

To make it easier, we'll call this system "SIR-C Reg" from now on.<p><p>SIR-C Reg is an interactive tool for registering SIR-C data, X-SAR data, orbyte images to SIR-C data, X-SAR data, byte images, digital elevation maps(DEMs), or JPL AIRSAR data.  Tools are provided for reading data in nativeformat (e.g. CEOS for SIR-C and X-SAR data), viewing the data and collectingtie points, registering the data, and exporting the data in native or otherformats.  The user interface is written in Research System Incorporated's ImageDisplay Languagereg..  Computational routines are written in both IDL and in Cas appropriate.<p><p>Version 1.1 of SIR-C Reg contains some extra image tracking features that areonly available if you are running IDL version 3.0.  These features are notcompatible with IDL version 3.5.1.  Please note that IDL version 3.5.1 has beenfound to contain new bugs with respect to version 3.0.  It is recommended thatyou use version 3.0 if at all possible so as to take advantage of theadditional features in SIR-C Reg v1.1.<p><p><p><b><a name="RTFToC3">1.2What to Read</a></b><p><p>This document describes how to install and use the SIR-C Registration system.A tutorial is provided in Chapter 2.  The tutorial will provide you with mostof the information you need to use the system effectively.<p><p>Details of implementation are described in the Technical SpecificationsDocument (version 1.2) which should accompany this User's Guide.  Referencesare made throughout this document to the relevant sections in the TechnicalSpecifications Document (TSD).<p><p>Additional program details are also included in this document.<p><p><p><b><a name="RTFToC4">1.3Overview</a></b><p><p>SIR-C Reg is composed of four main subsystems:<p><p>	(1) Image Import Subsystem<p>	(2) Tie / Check Point Collection Subsystem<p>	(3) Image Registration Subsystem<p>	(4) Image Export Subsystem<p><b><a name="RTFToC5">1.3.1Image Import Subsystem</a></b><p><p>The Image Import subsystem generates displayable byte images from a variety ofdata sources.  These include the following:<p><p>	SIR-C MLC and MLD data<p>	X-SAR MGD data<p>	JPL AIRSAR compressed Stokes matrix data<p>	I*2 DEMs<p>	byte images<p><p>The representative byte  images are used in the Tie / Check Point CollectionSubsystem and are stored in a special format (see TSD Section 3.1).  For SARdata, the user may choose to synthesize a power or amplitude image.<p><p>The Image Import Subsystem is described in TSD Section 3.<p><p><b><a name="RTFToC6">1.3.2Tie / Check Point Collection Subsystem</a></b><p><p>The Tie / Check Point Collection Subsystem provides an interface with which theuser selects tie and check points between a master image and a slave image.The master image is that to which the slave image is being registered.  Tiepoints are differentiated from check points in that tie points are used togenerate the registration equation coefficients.  Check points are used as ameans of measuring the registration error.<p><p>The user is provided with standard tools such as zooming in and out in order tofacilitate the selection of tie and check points.  In addition, the user maychoose the "correlation chip" option in order to have the computerautomatically deduce the location of a tie or check point.<p><p>This subsystem is described in TSD Section 1.3.  The correlation chip functionis described in TSD Section 5.<p><p><b><a name="RTFToC7">1.3.3Image Registration Subsystem</a></b><p><p>Once enough tie points have been selected, the user may choose one of two imagewarping options:<p><p>	translation, scaling, rotation<p>	warping<p><p>Generally, the translation, scaling, and rotation step is applied first.  Thisinvolves the determination and application of a set of first-order warpingequations.  At least 6 tie points are required to determine the coefficients ofthe warping equations.  This warping step is described in TSD Section 7.2.<p><p>The warping step is generally applied second.  The equations are second order.At least 12 tie points are required to compute the coefficients.  The secondorder warping step is described in TSD Section 7.3.<p><p>After either step, a results file is created which contains the updated tiepoints and measures of the registration error.  The contents of the resultsfile is contained in TSD Section 7.5.<p><b><a name="RTFToC8">1.3.4Image Export Subsystem</a></b><p><p>The Image Export Subsystem generates the final registered output data sets.The user may choose to generate a data set in the same format as the original,a byte image, or an IEEE floating point image.  The user selects the image tobe exported.  The warping equations used are read from the associated imagedescriptor file and are applied to form the exported data set.  This subsystemis described in TSD Section 4.<p><p><b><a name="RTFToC9">1.3.5Layout of Directories</a></b><p><p>The directories in which data files, images, tie point files, etc. are kept arerelative to a project directory.  The project directory is set with theenvironment variable PROJ_DIR.  You would set this variable as follows:<p><p>	setenv PROJ_DIR &lt;your project directory&gt;<p><p>If PROJ_DIR is undefined, then the system assumes that it is the currentdirectory (i.e. `.').<p><p>The following directories must be contained within the project directory:<p><p>	<IMG SRC="sircreg1.gif"><p><p>The DATA directory contains the original data sets (e.g. a SIR-C MLC data set)and the exported data sets.  <p><p>The IMAGES directory contains the representative byte images created by theImage Import Subsystem.  <p><p>The DESCRIPTORS directory contains files which describe the representative byteimages.  These are generated by the Image Import Subsystem and are updated bythe Image Registration Subsystem to include any warping equations applied to agiven image.  <p><p>The TIEPTS directory contain the tie points associated with images in theIMAGES directory and are created by the Tie / Check Point Collection Subsystem.<p><p>The RESULTS directory contains the files generated by the Image RegistrationSubsystem comparing old and new tie points.  These files also contain a measureof the registration accuracy.<p><p><b><a name="RTFToC10">1.4Requirements</a></b><p><p>SIR-C Reg v1.1 should be usable on any BSD 4.3 type Unix system with an ANSI Ccompiler and IDL version 3.0 or 3.5.1.  Additional features are available underIDL 3.0.<p><p>SIR-C Reg is targeted to run on a Sun SPARC II running under operating systemOS 4.1.3 or later with 32 MB of internal memory.  It was integrated and tested,however, on a Sun SPARCstation 4/280 with 8 MB of memory and is clearlycompatible with older computers with fewer resources.  It has also been testedon Sun 670MP systems running SunOS 4.1.3 and DECstations running ULTRIX 4.3.<p><p><b><a name="RTFToC11">1.4.1IDL Compatibility</a></b><p><p>SIR-C Reg v1.1 will run under IDL versions 3.0 or 3.5.1.  However, it containssome additional image tracking features that are only available if you arerunning IDL version 3.0.  <p><p><p><b><a name="RTFToC12">1.5Supported Image Sizes and Display Requirements</a></b><p><p>SIR-C Reg supports images of variable sizes up to 32767 samples x 32767lines.<p><p>To use the Tie / Check Point Collection Subsystem, at least an 8-bit gray scaleor color display is required.<p><p><p><b><a name="RTFToC13">1.6Input Data File Formats</a></b><p><p>The following data can be used as master data:<p><p>	SIR-C MLC or MLD data<p>	X-SAR MGD data<p>	JPL AIRSAR data<p>	I*2 DEMs<p>	byte images<p><p>The following data can be used as slave data:<p><p>	SIR-C MLC or MLD data<p>	X-SAR MGD data<p>	byte images<p><p>For SIR-C data files created by the SIR-C CEOS tape reader, the CEOS leader,trailer, image descriptor, and image data files are required.  The file namingconvention expected is "&lt;base_name&gt;_ldr_ceos","&lt;base_name&gt;_tlr_ceos", "&lt;base_name&gt;_img_ceos", and"&lt;base_name&gt;_img_ceos_image", respectively.  This differs from standardCEOS files in that the data has been separated out of the imagery options file,with the 12 byte prefix removed from the beginning of each record, and the datadescriptor record kept in the separate file.  The programs will also recognizethe SIR-C archive CEOS file format containing the CEOS leader, trailer, andimagery options files with the names "&lt;base_name&gt;_ldr_ceos","&lt;base_name&gt;_tlr_ceos", and "&lt;base_name&gt;_img_ceos".  The volumedefinition file and null volume definition file are not needed.  Only the MLCand MLD data formats are supported.  See TSD Sections 3.2 and 4.3 for theequations used to uncompress and compress the SAR data.<p><p>For X-SAR data, the CEOS leader and imagery options files are required.  Theexpected file naming convention expected is the same as that for SIR-C.  Ifyour X-SAR files are not named appropriately, you must rename them to theexpected forms before running the programs.  The volume definition file andnull volume definition file are not needed.  No trailer file is generated forX-SAR data.  Only the MGD data format is supported.  See TSD Sections 3.3 and4.4 for the equations used to decode the SAR data.<p><p>For JPL AIRSAR data, only the compressed Stokes matrix format is supported.See TSD Section 3.4 for the equations used to uncompress the SAR data.<p><p>For DEMs, only the I*2 (2-byte integer) data format is supported.  These aregenerally read as short data types in C.  The data may optionally have a headerwhich is ignored by the system.  The user must provide the size of the headerin bytes.<p><p>Byte images may also have a header which is ignored by the system.  The usermust provide the size of the header in bytes.<p><p><p><p><p><p><b>	<a name="RTFToC14">2.Getting Started</a></b><p><p><p><b><a name="RTFToC15">2.1Installation</a></b><p><p>You should have received with this manual a tape, floppy disk, or other mediacontaining the SIR-C Reg system.  Presumably this tape contains a tar file.  Inorder to install the system, follow these instructions, substituting theappropriate directories and device names:<p><p>	1) insert or mount the tape or other media into or onto the appropriatedrive<p>	2) cd to the directory where you want the system stored, for example, on aSun:<p>		cd /usr/local<p>	3) extract the tar file<p>		tar xvf /dev/rst0<p>	4) dismount the tape or other media<p><p>Be sure you have at least 0.5 MB of free disk space for SIR-C Reg.

However,this function only works if the master and slave images are both inapproximately the same orientation and have approximately the same pixeldimensions.  The following case would not work:<p><p>	<IMG SRC="sircreg51.gif"><p><p>In addition, the two images must exhibit the same reflectivity properties.  Forexample, if you wish to generate a tie point at the intersection of 4agricultural fields,  each of these fields must exhibit the same relativebrightnesses in the slave and master image.  The following example would notgenerate a valid tie point:<p><p>	<IMG SRC="sircreg52.gif"><p><p>The orientation and pixel dimension requirements are usually met after applyinglinear warping.  Thus the correlation function may be useful in findingadditional tie points after linear warping and before polynomial warping.<p><p>Finally, the areas that you select should have some high contrast features inorder for the correlation to generate useful results.  Correlating two areas ofnear uniform intensity (such as over calm ocean) may not produce a tie point.<p><p><b><a name="RTFToC48">2.4.5.3.9.2How to Use It</a></b><p><p>The correlation function only operates when both the master and slave imagesare at full resolution (i.e. x 1).

Center the box on thecorresponding area in the slave image.  The press the right mouse button.<p><p>The correlation function is now called and attempts to locate the peak of thecorrelation.  If the peak falls on the edge of the area over which thecorrelation was computed, then no tie point is generated.  Otherwise, a new tiepoint pair is generated and added to the tie point lists.

Otherwise, go back to the Tie / Check Point Collection subsystem andadd some more tie points.

In the example we've been using so far, the slave image name was"slave.img".  The new slave image file name is derived from the original nameby first removing the ".img".  If a ".&lt;n&gt;" remains at the end of the filewhere &lt;n&gt; is an integer, then the new base file name will end with".&lt;n+1&gt;".  Otherwise, a ".1" is appended to the base name.<p><p>For example, "slave.1" would be converted to "slave.2" and "slave" would beconverted to "slave.1".<p><p>The new image file name is then created by appending ".img" to the new basefile name.

Introduction
</a></u></b><p>
<b><u></u></b><p>
	The user may want to transport unformatted floating point  (4 
bytes per sample) data files written by a VAX computer to a unix host 
computer.  This host computer, if it is not a VAX, may have a different 
convention for interpreting unformatted floating point data values.  The 
purpose of this software is to convert these non-ASCII files to the 
unformatted floating point representation of the host machine.  This is 
done by reading the bytes bit by bit, converting them to floating point 
numbers, and then writing the results to another file.<p>
	The motivation behind writing this program was our observation and 
personal experience that while many users are switching from VAX computers 
to unix computers such as SUN, <p>
SGI, and DEC alpha computers, there are many data files created by VAX
computers that must now be used on  other machines.  For instance, 
NASA/JPL AIRSAR synthetic aperture radar synoptic data is processed on 
a VAX computer, but we wish to analyze the data on a DEC alpha, SUN, HP, 
SGI, etc.,  computer. This requires that the data be converted to the 
floating point format of several different types of computers.<p>
	This software was written with generality in mind.  The data file is 
allowed to have any length header at the beginning of the file (header values not 
converted, so if it is an ASCII header it will be preserved), and any length 
header bytes at the beginning of each line (must be a constant length for each 
line).<p>
	In particular, this software was written to convert  AIRSAR synoptic 
data from VAX floating point format to host computer floating point format.  
These files
have three lines of ASCII header information (15360 bytes), followed by 
5088 lines of data, each data line being 5120 bytes (1280 floating point 
numbers), with no prefix header at the beginning of each line.  Therefore, 
these values are the default values.  However, any unformatted floating 
point data file may be converted by this software.<p>
	This software was written in ANSI C, and should work on any computer 
with an ANSI C compiler.  It has only been tested on unix platforms.<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<b><u>
<a name="RTFToC2">2.
Software description, and an example
</a></u></b><p>
<b><u></u></b><p>
			The program <b>vaxfc</b> converts the data by examining the 4 bytes 
that make up each floating point value.  Refer to [2] for a complete description of 
VAX floating point representation.  These four bytes are structured as follows,
with the bits numbered as indicated:<p>
<pre>
	15	 14    13    12    11    10    9    8         7      6      5      4      3      2      1     0
	31	30    29    28    27    26    25   24       23    22    21    20    19    18    17 16    
</pre>
<p>
corresponding to the byte order :<p>
<pre>
				byte 1	    byte 0                    
				byte 3	    byte 2                    
</pre>
<p>
			Bit 15 : sign bit.<p>
<p>
			Bits 14 through 7  :  excess 128 binary exponent (binary 1 to 255 
indicates true values -127 to 128)<p>
<p>
			Bits 6 though 0 and 31 through 16 :  normalized 24 bit fraction with 
redundant most significant fraction bit not represented.  Significance increases 
from 16
to 31 then 0 to	6.<p>
<p>
			The program is compiled as follows:<p>
<p>
&gt; <b> cc vaxfc.c -o vaxfc -lm</b><p>
<b></b><p>
			This should create the <b>vaxfc</b> executable.<p>

<h2>Educational Goals</h2><p>

Welcome to the SIR-C Education Program (SIR-CED). SIR-CED is
an education initiative based around the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's imaging radar program and is designed for Middle School and
High School students. The goals of this initiative are to:<p>

<ol type=1>
<li>Help improve the overall performance of US students in Middle School and
High School in mathematics, science and geography, in accordance with the
national goals for education.<p>

<li>Provide an easy-to-use set of resources for teachers in the modern
classroom.<p>

<li>Spark students' interest in earth science, mathematics, computing,
geography, physics and engineering as subjects they might consider for
college.<p>

<li>Encourage students to think about their environment and 
how to monitor it.
</ul>

The  earth's environment presents problems that concern us all. The headlines
are full of dire warnings about global warming and the greenhouse effect, or
instances of earthquakes,  floods, volcanic eruptions, and hurricanes. Many
people are concerned enough to want to find out more. Young people in
particular, will flock to buy magazines and attend exhibitions concerning the
environment, and are often concerned enough to join in demonstrations or
organize petitions which address environmental issues. Ask your students how
many of them have a T-shirt with <i>Save the Rain Forest</i>
 written on it, for
example.<p>
<p>
<A NAME = "WHATISCED">
<h2>What Is SIR-CED?</h2><p>
<p>
SIR-CED is based around NASA's imaging radar program. Imaging radar is a key
technology used by scientists to monitor the Earth's environment. SIR-C, or
Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C, is the latest generation of imaging radars produced
by JPL for NASA, and flew on the Space Shuttle in April 1994 and October 1994.
SIR-C represents the state-of-the-art in radar imaging technology, and the
collected radar data offers scientists a unique look at the Earth from space.
Among other things, scientists will use the SIR-C radar images to view areas of
the earth that are normally obscured by clouds, to monitor deforestation, to
search for buried river channels in the Sahara Desert, and to estimate the
extent of flooding in river basins.<p>
The SIR-CED program is designed to help meet some of the goals set out in
NASA's Strategic Plan for Education (see 
<a href="OVERVUWD.HTM#FURTHREAD">
Further Reading</a>
). In putting together
this initiative, NASA and JPL's aim is to reach as many Middle School and High
School students as possible in order to:<p>

<ol type=1>
<li>Carry the message that NASA is actively pursuing Earth observation
programs under the umbrella of <i>Mission to Planet Earth</i>.<p>
<li>Teach them that imaging radars are an important 
and current part of these
programs.<p>
<li>Show how imaging radars work and how they are used to monitor the world
around us.<p>
<li>Develop practical experiments and procedures to assist educators in
teaching earth science, computing and mathematical principles to Middle School
and High School students, in Southern California and across the United
States.<p>
</ol>

Although some segments of the SIR-CED program are designed around the SIR-C
missions, the program is designed to be used with data from a wide range of
imaging radars.  Examples of data from earlier imaging radar missions can be
found on the CD-ROM accompanying this package, including images from Magellan
mission to the planet Venus. The software included in the SIR-CED package
should be flexible enough to handle radar image data from future missions, too.
The SIR-CED program should be useful as an introduction to imaging radar and
its role in monitoring the earth's environment over the next decade or so.<p>
<p>
<A NAME = "WHOINVOLVED">
<h2>Who Should Get Involved?</h2><p>
<p>
The SIR-CED package is designed as a module for Middle Schools and High
Schools. The documentation you are reading contains Lesson Plans and
Presentation Materials to use in the classroom, and a Teachers' Guide which can
be used as a reference book or to supplement the classroom materials. The
SIR-CED material can be taught as part of an earth science class, a computing
course, or a geography class.  Undoubtedly, teachers will find some of the
images useful in teaching other subjects as well.  <p>
<p>
The SIR-CED package allows students to learn about NASA's Earth observation
program, how imaging radar forms a key part of that program, and how to use the
software provided on the CD-ROM to analyze radar image data in the same way
scientists do. Then, having learned the necessary skills, they can tackle a
project in which they pick a site, investigate the data available, form a
hypothesis about what they see and then test it against their observations. 
The time spent on this material is up to the individual teacher. Some teachers
have used the material as a one-hour supplement to their usual material. Others
have spent several weeks on SIR-CED with their class, with a one-hour period
each day. Some material may be too advanced for Middle School students and the
teacher may wish to skip over those parts of the package. For High School
students, progress through the first stages of the package may be too slow, so
the teacher may elect to head for the project part of the package sooner. <p>
<p>

<A NAME = "COMPONENTS">
<h2>The Components</h2>

The SIR-CED package consists of the following components:
<ol type=1>
<li>Teachers' Resource Guide
<li>Presentation Materials
<li>Lesson Guides, including activities for students
<li>A CD-ROM containing:

<ul type=circle>
<li>radar images
<li>shuttle hand-held photographs taken by the astronauts
<li>digitized location and topographic maps
<li>ground photos
<li>video clips from the SIR-C missions
<li>software for image display and analysis
<li>documentation
</ul>

<li>A selection of videos about imaging radar
</ol>

Electronic copies of the Teachers' Guide, Presentation materials and Lesson
Guides can all be found on the SIR-CED CD-ROM. You'll find lesson plans and
presentation materials to use in the classroom in the Lessons and Slides
directories. You'll also find a Teachers Guide to use as a
reference book in the Teachers directory. 
It's a good idea to introduce the CD to
your students by running the Guided Tour. 
<p>
The Teachers' Resource Guide was written to provide detailed information for
teachers using the SIR-CED package. It is divided up into five Modules:<p>

<ul type=circle>
<li>Module 1 - Mission to Planet Earth
<li>Module 2 - How Radar Images the Earth
<li>Module 3 - What is SIR-C/X-SAR?
<li>Module 4 - Image Examples
<li>Module 5 - Exploration and Discovery
</ul>

<p>
Module 1 introduces NASA's Mission to Planet Earth and how scientists use
remote sensing to monitor the environment.  Module 2 answers the question 'What
is imaging radar?' and describes what radar images mean.  Module 3 addresses
the SIR-C/X-SAR mission: what it is; what the scientific aims of the mission
are; who is involved, etc.  Module 4 looks at sample data sets for some of the
sites selected by the SIR-C science team. Module 5 sets the students off on
their own, exploring the data contained on the SIR-CED CD-ROM, discovering
things for themselves and then reporting on them as a scientist would.<p>
<p>
Corresponding to Modules 1, 2 and 3 of the SIR-CED package is a set of
Presentation Materials. These consist of viewgraphs or overheads which can be
copied onto a transparency and used with an overhead projector. 
<p>
The Lesson Guide is also divided up into five modules, following the format of
the Teachers' Resource Guide.  The Lesson Guide consists of planned activities
for the students, which can be photocopied and handed out, or distributed
electronically by copying them onto your students' computers.  A number of the
lessons involve computer activities using data from the SIR-CED CD-ROM.<p>
<p>
The SIRCED03 CD-ROM is the second in a series and is a post-SIR-C launch look
at imaging radar and at some the sites imaged by SIR-C/X-SAR. It contains a
collection of images (including radar images from earlier missions),
documentation (including the Teachers' Resource Guide, Presentation Materials
and Lesson Guide), and software for displaying the image data and some of the
text files. This data set is unique; never before has such a comprehensive set
of radar data and supporting data been collected together. <p>
<p>
A video to accompany the SIR-CED package is also available 
(from NASA CORE).
It contains an introduction to the role imaging radar can play in monitoring
the earth's environment (the EOS SAR video); a time-lapse movie of the SIR-C
and X-SAR antenna under construction; a movie showing imaging radar data being
collected on an aircraft; and some examples of radar images from the Magellan
mission to Venus.<p>
<p>
The documentation which accompanies the SIR-CED package has been written in
Helvetica 14, a font with a fairly large typeface. This was done so that the
material would be legible if projected onto an overhead projector screen,
straight off the computer screen (using an LCD perhaps). Thus if a point
requires further explanation, the teacher can pick out the appropriate part of
the Teachers' Resource Guide and display it for the class.<p>

<A NAME = "WHATSNEEDED">
<h2>What Is Needed?</h2>

A description of the hardware and software requirements for this CD
is available in the
<a href="../REFERMAP/HOWTOUSE.HTM">
How Do I Use The CD?
</a>
 section.
If only one computer is available, you might also want an LCD (Liquid Crystal
Display) device to project your computer display onto an overhead projector
screen or a hook-up to project the computer display onto a TV screen.<p>
<p>
The computer skills required to use the computer part 
of the SIR-CED package
are the basic skills such as pointing, clicking, opening a file, dragging,
copying and saving a file. 
For a few file types, the
appropriate application should be launched first by double-clicking, then the
file can be opened from within the application. We have tried to keep the size
of most files on the CD-ROM below 1.4 Mbytes, 
so they can be copied and distributed
using a floppy disk, and also so that they do not require vast amounts of
memory to open them.<p>
<p>
You may also need:<p>
<ul type=circle>
<li>Access to a photocopying machine
<li>An overhead projector and screen
<li>A good Atlas or a prominent map of the world
<li>A VHS video player (optional)
<li>A Television (optional)
</ul>

Freedom Dean, Timothy Garrett, Hillary Hartley, Aaron Moshiashwill, Jonathon
Woodring, Eric Mortenson, Eric Cooper, Marta Rives and Robert Parrott).<p>
<p>
The authors would like to thank: Mike Sander and Diane Evans of the JPL SIR-C
Project Office for their encouragement and support; JoBea Way for use of the
Kidsat room and facilities; Dick Monson, Miriam Baltuck and Shelby Tilford of

<h2>Further Reading</h2>
Throughout the documents included in this package, we have avoided the
use of technical references, since we feel that the SIR-CED package should
stand alone, and not require a great deal of plowing through reference books.
We also felt that the resources to access reference books or papers might be
unavailable to some teachers using this package. Nevertheless, some background
reading to explore the subjects addressed in SIR-CED might prove useful:

An overall map of the CD is displayed above.
This image is takened from our MS-Windows <i>File Manager.</i>
Your display window will look slightly different but the
directory structure should be the same. 
As you can see,
the topmost directories are:
<p>

We have also opened each of these directories to show the 
next level of subdirectories
below them. This will give you a better idea how the CD is organized.
<p>

Some of the directory and filenames may seem funny to you. This is
because the DOS/MS-Windows 3.1 operating system has a limitation of
eight characters per filename. 
However, we try to make the filenames recognizable more or less.
For example,
the <b>Guided Tour</b> is located in the /ROADMAP/GUIDTOUR.HTM file.

SIR-C Data Compression Formats

	For SIR-C  there are three possible data formats:

		1) compressed cross-products data (MLC)  (Multilook data)
			 quad-pol, 10 bytes per pixel
		 	 dual-pol 5 bytes per pixel 

		2) compressed detected data (MLD)  (Multilook data)
			 single-pol, 2 bytes per pixel

		3) compressed scattering matrix data (SLC)  (Singlelook data)
			 quad-pol, 10 bytes per pixel
			 dual-pol, 6 bytes per pixel
			 single-pol, 4 bytes per pixel 

	In the following descriptions:
	
		sign( ) will return the sign of the argument ( ± 1) 

		nint( ) will indicate that the nearest integer value is calculated of its 
argument.  

		int( ) will indicate that the truncation of the floating point value to integer 
is calculated of its argument, and that, if the floating point value is less than zero, 
subtraction by 1.0 is additionally required.  Note that this is not the same as FORTRAN 
int( ).



Multi Look Complex data

	There are two possible data formats for Cross-products data, depending on 
polarization mode.

	SIR-C "MLC" quad-pol data - 10 bytes per pixel.  Consists of one file for each 
scene, per frequency.  Each line of the file consists of TBD range samples, in which range 
increases with sample number.  There are a TBD number of lines per file, in which each 
line corresponds to different azimuth or along track locations.  There are no header lines 
after the file has been stripped for the header by the CEOS reader. The standard output 
product by the GDPS will not have 12 bytes of file information at the beginning of each 
line.  There will be separate header files.  This data will be multi look complex cross-
product data.  The bytes present depend on the polarization mode.  The data has been 
symmetrized such that SHV = 0.5 (SHV +SVH).  

¡ 10 bytes per pixel - quad-pol data, with:
	¡ Byte(1) :  int{log2(SHHSHH* + 2SHVSHV* + SVVSVV*)}
	¡ Byte(2) : nint{254[Mantissa  - 1.5]}
		Mantissa = (SHHSHH* + 2SHVSHV* + SVVSVV*) / 2Byte(1))
		qsca = [ (Byte(2) / 254 ) + 1.5] 2Byte(1)

	¡ Byte(3) : nint{255 sqrt(SHVSHV* / qsca)} - 127
	¡ Byte(4) : nint{255 (SVVSVV* / qsca)} - 127
	¡ Byte(5) : nint{sign[Re(SHHSHV*)]
				127sqrt(2|Re(SHHSHV*) | / qsca)}	
	¡ Byte(6) : nint{sign[Im(SHHSHV*)]
				127sqrt(2|Im(SHHSHV*) | / qsca)}
	¡ Byte(7) : nint{127 (2Re(SHHSVV* )  / qsca)}
	¡ Byte(8) : nint{127 (2Im(SHHSVV* )  / qsca)}
	¡ Byte(9) : nint{sign[Re(SHVSVV*)]
				127sqrt(2|Re(SHVSVV*) | / qsca)}
	¡ Byte(10) : nint{sign[Im(SHVSVV*)]
				127sqrt(2|Im(SHVSVV*) | / qsca)}
	The total power is :

		TP =  0.25 ( byte(2) / 254 + 1.5) 2Byte(1))

	The remaining terms are given by :

		SHVSHV* = qsca[ (byte(3) + 127)/255]2
		SVVSVV* = qsca[ (byte(4) + 127)/255]
		SHHSHH* = qsca - SVVSVV* - 2 SHVSHV*
			Re(SHHSHV*) = 0.5 qsca {sign(byte(5)) [byte(5)/127]2}
			Im(SHHSHV*) = 0.5 qsca {sign(byte(6)) [byte(6)/127]2}
			Re(SHHSVV*) =   qsca  [byte(7)/254]
			Im(SHHSVV*) =   qsca  [byte(8)/254]
			Re(SHVSVV*) = 0.5 qsca {sign(byte(9)) [byte(9)/127]2}
			Im(SHVSVV*) = 0.5 qsca {sign(byte(10)) [byte(10)/127]2}

	SIR-C "MLC" dual-pol data - 5 bytes per pixel.  Consists of one file for each 
scene, per frequency.  Each line of the file consists of TBD range samples, in which range 
increases with sample number.  There are a TBD number of lines per file, in which each 
line corresponds to different azimuth or along track locations.  There are no header lines 
after the file has been stripped for the header by the CEOS reader.  The standard output 
product by the GDPS will have 12 bytes of file information at the beginning of each line.  
There will be separate header files.  This data will be multi look complex cross-product 
data.  The compression format is the same as for the quad-pol data format, except that not 
all 10 bytes are present.  The bytes present depend on the polarization mode. 

	HH and VV polarizations : bytes 1,2,4,7,8
	HH and HV polarizations : bytes 1,2,3,5,6
	VH and VV polarizations : bytes 1,2,3,9,10


The Stokes matrix and Cross-Products

The symmetrized Stokes matrix may be formed from the cross-products of the scattering 
matrix that are stored by SIR-C in the MLC format as follows:

	m(1,1) = (ShhShh* + SvvSvv* + 2ShvShv*) / 4.0
	m(1,2) = (ShhShh* - SvvSvv*) / 4.0
	m(1,3) = (Re(ShhShv*) + Re(ShvSvv*) ) / 2.0
	m(1,4) = (-Im(ShhShv*) - Im(ShvSvv*) ) / 2.0
	m(2,1) = m(1,2)
	m(2,2) = (ShhShh* +SvvSvv* - 2ShvShv* ) / 4.0
	m(2,3) = ( Re(ShhShv*) - Re(ShvSvv*) ) / 2.0
	m(2,4) = (-Im(ShhShv*) + Im(ShvSvv*) )/ 2.0
	m(3,1) = m(1,3)
	m(3,2) = m(2,3)
	m(3,3) = (ShvShv*  + Re(ShhSvv*) / 2.0
	m(3,4) = -Im(ShhSvv*) / 2.0
	m(4,1) = m(1,4)
	m(4,2) = m(2,4)
	m(4,3) = m(3,4)
	m(4,4) = (ShvShv* - Re(ShhSvv*) )/ 2.0

	The cross-products in terms of the symmetrized Stokes matrix elements are :

	ShhShh* = 2m(1,2) + 2m(1,1) - m(3,3) - m(4,4)
	ShvShv* = m(3,3) + m(4,4)
	SvvSvv* = 2m(1,1) - 2m(1,2) - m(3,3) - m(4,4)
	ShhShv* = complex( m(1,3) + m(2,3), -m(1,4) - m(2, 4) )
	ShhSvv* = complex(  m(3,3) - m(4,4), -2m(3,4) )
	ShvSvv* = complex( m(1,3) - m(2,3), -m(1,4) + m(2,4) )
 

	For SLC data, the Stokes matrix will not be symmetrized.  The unsymmetrized 
Stokes Matrix is given by:

	m(1,1) = (ShhShh* + ShvShv* + SvhSvh* + SvvSvv*) / 4.0
	m(1,2) = (ShhShh* - ShvShv* + SvhSvh* - SvvSvv*) / 4.0
	m(1,3) = (Re(ShhShv*) + Re(SvhSvv*) ) / 2.0
	m(1,4) = (-Im(ShhShv*) - Im(SvhSvv*) ) / 2.0
	m(2,1) = (ShhShh* + ShvShv* - SvhSvh* - SvvSvv*) / 4.0
	m(2,2) = (ShhShh* + SvvSvv* - ShvShv* - SvhSvh*) / 4.0
	m(2,3) = ( Re(ShhShv*) - Re(SvhSvv*) ) / 2.0
	m(2,4) = (-Im(ShhShv*) + Im(SvhSvv*) )/ 2.0
	m(3,1) = (Re(ShhSvh*) + Re(ShvSvv*) ) / 2.0
	m(3,2) = ( Re(ShhSvh*) - Re(ShvSvv*) ) / 2.0
	m(3,3) = (ShvShv*  + Re(ShhSvv*) / 2.0
	m(3,4) = (-Im(ShhSvv*+Im(ShvSvh*) / 2.0
	m(4,1) =  (-Im(ShhSvh*) - Im(ShvSvv*) ) / 2.0
	m(4,2) = (-Im(ShhSvh*) + Im(ShvSvv*) )/ 2.0
	m(4,3) =  (-Im(ShhSvv* - Im(ShvSvh*) / 2.0

SIR-C Data Compression Formats

	For SIR-C  there are three possible data formats:

		1) compressed cross-products data (MLC)  (Multilook data)
			 quad-pol, 10 bytes per pixel
		 	 dual-pol 5 bytes per pixel 

		2) compressed detected data (MLD)  (Multilook data)
			 single-pol, 2 bytes per pixel

		3) compressed scattering matrix data (SLC)  (Singlelook data)
			 quad-pol, 10 bytes per pixel
			 dual-pol, 6 bytes per pixel
			 single-pol, 4 bytes per pixel 

	In the following descriptions:
	
		sign( ) will return the sign of the argument ( ± 1) 

		nint( ) will indicate that the nearest integer value is calculated of its 
argument.  

		int( ) will indicate that the truncation of the floating point value to integer 
is calculated of its argument, and that, if the floating point value is less than zero, 
subtraction by 1.0 is additionally required.  Note that this is not the same as FORTRAN 
int( ).



Multi Look Detected data
	
	There is  one Multilook detected data product : 

	SIR-C "MLD" single pol data - 2 bytes per pixel.  Consists of one file for each 
scene, per frequency.  Each line of the file consists of TBD range samples, in which range 
increases with sample number.  There are a TBD number of lines per file, in which each 
line corresponds to different azimuth or along track locations.  There are no header lines 
after the file has been stripped for the header by the CEOS reader.  The standard output 
product by the GDPS will not have 12 bytes of file information at the beginning of each 
line.  There will be separate header files.  This data will be multi look detected power 
values.  The polarization will be either HH , HV, VH, or VV, depending on mode.

¡ 2 bytes per pixel - single-pol data, with:
	¡ Byte(1) :  int{log2(SXYSXY*)}
	¡ Byte(2) : nint{254[SXYSXY*/2Byte(1)  - 1.5]}

	To decompress the power,

		TP =   ( byte(2) / 254 + 1.5) 2Byte(1))



The Stokes matrix and Cross-Products

The symmetrized Stokes matrix may be formed from the cross-products of the scattering 
matrix that are stored by SIR-C in the MLC format as follows:

	m(1,1) = (ShhShh* + SvvSvv* + 2ShvShv*) / 4.0
	m(1,2) = (ShhShh* - SvvSvv*) / 4.0
	m(1,3) = (Re(ShhShv*) + Re(ShvSvv*) ) / 2.0
	m(1,4) = (-Im(ShhShv*) - Im(ShvSvv*) ) / 2.0
	m(2,1) = m(1,2)
	m(2,2) = (ShhShh* +SvvSvv* - 2ShvShv* ) / 4.0
	m(2,3) = ( Re(ShhShv*) - Re(ShvSvv*) ) / 2.0
	m(2,4) = (-Im(ShhShv*) + Im(ShvSvv*) )/ 2.0
	m(3,1) = m(1,3)
	m(3,2) = m(2,3)
	m(3,3) = (ShvShv*  + Re(ShhSvv*) / 2.0
	m(3,4) = -Im(ShhSvv*) / 2.0
	m(4,1) = m(1,4)
	m(4,2) = m(2,4)
	m(4,3) = m(3,4)
	m(4,4) = (ShvShv* - Re(ShhSvv*) )/ 2.0

	The cross-products in terms of the symmetrized Stokes matrix elements are :

	ShhShh* = 2m(1,2) + 2m(1,1) - m(3,3) - m(4,4)
	ShvShv* = m(3,3) + m(4,4)
	SvvSvv* = 2m(1,1) - 2m(1,2) - m(3,3) - m(4,4)
	ShhShv* = complex( m(1,3) + m(2,3), -m(1,4) - m(2, 4) )
	ShhSvv* = complex(  m(3,3) - m(4,4), -2m(3,4) )
	ShvSvv* = complex( m(1,3) - m(2,3), -m(1,4) + m(2,4) )
 

	For SLC data, the Stokes matrix will not be symmetrized.  The unsymmetrized 
Stokes Matrix is given by:

	m(1,1) = (ShhShh* + ShvShv* + SvhSvh* + SvvSvv*) / 4.0
	m(1,2) = (ShhShh* - ShvShv* + SvhSvh* - SvvSvv*) / 4.0
	m(1,3) = (Re(ShhShv*) + Re(SvhSvv*) ) / 2.0
	m(1,4) = (-Im(ShhShv*) - Im(SvhSvv*) ) / 2.0
	m(2,1) = (ShhShh* + ShvShv* - SvhSvh* - SvvSvv*) / 4.0
	m(2,2) = (ShhShh* + SvvSvv* - ShvShv* - SvhSvh*) / 4.0
	m(2,3) = ( Re(ShhShv*) - Re(SvhSvv*) ) / 2.0
	m(2,4) = (-Im(ShhShv*) + Im(SvhSvv*) )/ 2.0
	m(3,1) = (Re(ShhSvh*) + Re(ShvSvv*) ) / 2.0
	m(3,2) = ( Re(ShhSvh*) - Re(ShvSvv*) ) / 2.0
	m(3,3) = (ShvShv*  + Re(ShhSvv*) / 2.0
	m(3,4) = (-Im(ShhSvv*+Im(ShvSvh*) / 2.0
	m(4,1) =  (-Im(ShhSvh*) - Im(ShvSvv*) ) / 2.0
	m(4,2) = (-Im(ShhSvh*) + Im(ShvSvv*) )/ 2.0
	m(4,3) =  (-Im(ShhSvv* - Im(ShvSvh*) / 2.0
	m(4,4) = (Re(ShvSvh*) - Re(ShhSvv*) )/ 2.0

AIRSAR Data Compression Formats


	For AIRSAR data, there are four possible formats :  

		1) compressed stokes matrix data 
			(multilook,quad-pol, low-res, 10 bytes/pixel)
		2) compressed scattering matrix (730 processor) data 
			(single look,quad-pol,10 bytes/pixel)
		3) compressed scattering matrix (3.5 processor) data 
			(single look,quad-pol, low-res, 10 bytes/pixel)
		4) uncompressed synoptic amplitude data 
			(vax real*4, single pol, low-res, 4 bytes/pixel)
	In the following descriptions:
	
		sign( ) will return the sign of the argument ( ± 1) 

		nint( ) will indicate that the nearest integer value is calculated of its 
argument.  

		int( ) will indicate that the truncation of the floating point value to integer 
is calculated of its argument, and that, if the floating point value is less than zero, 
subtraction by 1.0 is additionally required.  Note that this is not the same as FORTRAN 
int( ).

		gen_fac is the AIRSAR general scale factor whose value is recorded in the 
header of the oldheader, field 133.


Detected data products

	AIRSAR synoptic amplitude data - 4 bytes per pixel.  This data is not 
compressed.  Consists of one file for each scene, per channel processed (usually three).  
Each line of the file consists of 1279 range samples, in which range increases with sample 
number.  There are 5090 lines per file, in which each line corresponds to different 
azimuth or along track locations.  The azimuth pixel spacing is 12.1 meters for the pre-
1993 prf, and 8 meters for the 1993 and later prf.  The range pixel spacing is 6.66 meters 
(assumes 20 MHz data).  The first two lines in the file are header lines. The data has been 
multilooked by 16, and the pixels are amplitude rather than power values.  The format is 
that each pixel is a four byte DEC VAX floating point number.  There is no general scale 
factor that is used.

		gen_fac is the AIRSAR general scale factor whose value is recorded in the 
header of the oldheader, field 133.


Complex scattering matrix data

		AIRSAR 730 processor "hi-res" quad-pol data -  10 bytes per pixel.  
Consists of four files for each scene, per frequency.  Each line of each file consists of 
1024 azimuth samples.  There are 750 lines, each corresponding to progressively greater 
range from the radar.  The azimuth pixel spacing is 3.33 meters.  The range pixel spacing 
is 6.66 meters (assumes 20 MHz data).  The four files are exactly adjacent to each other 
in azimuth.  Generally, the first two lines of the file are header lines.  There is no 
symmetrization of the data.

¡ 10 bytes per pixel - quad-pol data, with:
	¡ Byte(1) :  int{log2(0.25 (SHHMHH* + SHVSHV* + SVHSVH*+ 
SVVSVV*))}
	¡ Byte(2) : nint{254[Mantissa  - 1.5]}

		Mantissa = 0.25 (SHHSHH* + SHVSHV* + SVHSVH*+ SVVSVV*) / 
2Byte(1)
		qsca = 2 sqrt{  gen_fac [ (Byte(2) / 254 ) + 1.5] 2Byte(1) }

	¡ Byte(3) : nint{127 Re(SHH)/qsca}
	¡ Byte(4) : nint{127 Im(SHH)/qsca}
 	¡ Byte(5) : nint{127 Re(SHV)/qsca}
	¡ Byte(6) : nint{127 Im(SHV)/qsca}
	¡ Byte(7) : nint{127 Re(SVH)/qsca}
	¡ Byte(8) : nint{127 Im(SVH)/qsca}
	¡ Byte(9) : nint{127 Re(SVV)/qsca}
	¡ Byte(10) : nint{127 Im(SVV)/qsca}

	 The total power (when  decompressing) is :

		TP =  gen_fac ( byte(2) / 254 + 1.5) 2Byte(1)) 

	and the remaining terms are given by :

		ysca = 2 sqrt{  gen_fac [ (Byte(2) / 254 ) + 1.5] 2Byte(1) }

		Re(SHH) = byte(3) ysca/127
		Im(SHH) = byte(4) ysca/127
		Re(SHV) = byte(5) ysca/127
		Im(SHV) = byte(6) ysca/127
		Re(SVH) = byte(7) ysca/127
		Im(SVH) = byte(8) ysca/127
		Re(SVV) = byte(9) ysca/127
		Im(SVV) = byte(10) ysca/127

		AIRSAR 3.5 processor "complex" quad-pol data -  10 bytes per pixel.  
Consists of four files for each scene, per frequency.    Each line of each file consists of 
1024 azimuth samples.  There are 1282 lines, each corresponding to progressively greater 
range from the radar.  For 20 MHz bandwidth data, the azimuth pixel spacing is 12.2 
meters (1993 and after, the prf was increased, such that the azimuth pixel spacing was 
decreased to 8 meters).  The range pixel spacing is 6.66 meters (again assuming 20 MHz 
data).  The first 2 lines of each file are header lines.  The four files correspond to the 
center four looks of 16 processed looks.  There is no symmetrization of the data.  The 
compression is identical to the AIRSAR 730 processor "hi-res" quad-pol data.

	The differences between AIRSAR and SIR-C data, is that the first two bytes are 
defined differently, and that the scale factor is defined differently.  The value stored in the 
first two bytes by AIRSAR is the total power, while the value stored in the first two bytes 
by SIR-C is four times the total power.  The scale factor for AIRSAR  is two times larger 
than the scale factor used by SIR-C.  In addition, there is no general scale factor for SIR-
C.
	Because of round off errors for some of the cross-product terms that are small, 
AIRSAR data converted to the SIR-C format, and then compared with the original 
AIRSAR compressed scattering matrix data, or with the AIRSAR Stokes data derived 
from the scattering matrix data,  might not be in exact agreement.

The Earth's polar regions are ice-covered, dynamic, beautiful, hostile, and
vitally important to the global climate.  They are vast, remote, and difficult
to access. The Polar regions have no sunlight nearly all winter and are
shrouded by clouds.  The images and data from satellites that orbit the polar
regions are important tools used to study these areas.  This home page 
describes some of the interesting facts and features of the Arctic and 
Antarctic regions and how we observe these regions using satellites.  The
primary science focus is on sea ice, which is ice formed in the oceans, and
 how we study it using RADAR or SAR imagery.

<title>What is SAR, anyway?</title>

<center>
<h1>What is SAR, anyway?</h1>
<img width=550 height=5 src="gifs/rainbow.gif">
</center>

<p>
<font size="+3">SAR</font> stands for <font size="+2"><I>synthetic aperture radar</I></font>. Radar sends out a pulse of radio waves which bounces off the
object to be depicted.  Then the scattered pulses return to the radar, where they
are captured by the receiving antenna.  The antenna is the radar's aperture, or 
its opening on the world.  SAR antennas are a type of radar antennna designed to take
advantage of their satellite's movement, thus creating a "synthetic" aperture or
opening.
 
<p>
<font size="+2">SAR</font> is an <font size="+2"><I>active remote sensing
 system</I></font>.  Active systems
transmit their own signal and measure the energy that is reflected or scattered
back from the target material.  

<p>
<font size="+2"><I>Passive systems</I></font> measure natural radiation emitted by the target material
and energy from other sources reflected from it.  For instance, the reflection
of solar radiation in a camera is an example of a passive system.  A difficulty
with passive systems in studying the polar regions is that good quality images
in the visible portion of the spectrum cannot be obtained in the presence of
clouds, rain, or darkness.
  

<p>
<font size="+2">SAR</font> images, which resemble photographs, are actually maps in which the brightness
shown is a measure of the radar energy reflected back to the antenna.  Water
droplets in fog and clouds are transparent to radio waves of the proper frequency
just as window glass is to light waves of the visible frequency.  Hence, a SAR
instrument can gather data in conditions where optical sensors would be useless,
i.e. it can provide excellent images of what the radar detected even in fog, 
clouds or darkness.  SAR data is used to study agriculture, ecology, geology, 
oceanography, and hydrology as well as shipping in ice-covered seas, oil
exploration, ocean pollution monitoring, and ocean research.

This figure shows a SAR antenna on a satellite that is orbiting the earth at an
altitude of 705 km, with a trace of sub-satellite track, a radar beam (yellow)
that is pointing 23 degrees off the sub-satellite track to continuously
illuminate the surface with a 100 km wide swath (red).

NASA has teamed up with three other international space agencies.
<P>
<img src="gifs/yellowball.gif">
Each of these agencies has built Earth orbiting satellites which carry a
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) instrument to study and monitor the Earth and its
global climate.
<p>
<img src="gifs/greenball.gif">
These satellites have a Sun-synchronous, near polar, quasi-circular orbit, and
ensure highly repetitive coverage of ice zones even during Polar winters.<br>
<p>
<img src="gifs/blueball.gif">
NASA has built two ground stations to receive SAR data from these 4 satellites.  One is called the <a href="http://eosims.asf.alaska.edu:12355">Alaska SAR Facility</a> at the University of Alaska Fairbanks,
which also processes and distributes SAR imagery.  ASF is managed by UAF and
was implemented together with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.  The other
station is The McMurdo Receiving Ground Station in Antarctica, which sends
the data it receives to ASF for processing.

<h2>1. What is SEA ICE and what does SEA ICE look like?</h2>
<p>
<h3>Sea ice is a thin, fragile, solid layer that forms in the Polar Oceans.  It forms a boundary between the relatively warm ocean and the cooler atmosphere.  There are many
different kinds of sea ice, and here are a few of the main ones:  </h3>
<P>
<font size="+1">
<center><img width=260 height=177 src="icegifs/1YrIceFlow.gif"></center><p>
This is a picture of a first year ice floe, or ice that grows during one winter.  It is usually smooth and is commonly 0.5 to 1.0 m thick.  The ice has been 
broken up to form rafts.  A research ship is in the left corner.

<p>
<center><img width=260 height=177 src="icegifs/1YrRidge2.gif"></center><p>
Ridges are long extents of compressed, broken pieces
of first year ice.  Their thicknesses can vary greatly.

<p>
<center><img width=260 height=191 src="icegifs/Multi-year_Ice.gif"></center><p>
Multi-year ice has grown during at least 
two consecutive winters and is 3 to 5 m thick.  It is not as smooth as first-year ice.  A weathered ridge crosses this floe.

<p>
<center><img width=550 height=5 src="gifs/rainbow.gif" alt="hr width=75%"></center>

<h2>2.  Why does SEA ICE float?</h2>
<p>
<h3>Sea ice floats because it is less dense in the solid phase than it is in the
liquid phase.  If sea ice were MORE dense in the solid phase, it would sink
to the bottom of the ocean (light things can't carry heavy things too well,
right?  Sinking, dense ice would cause the oceans to freeze to their beds, so animals and
plants which live on the ocean floor would die!</h3>
<p>
<center><img width=550 height=5 src="gifs/rainbow.gif" alt="hr width=75%" ></center>
 
<h2>3.  How does the structure of SEA ICE help it to float?</h2>
<p>
<h3>Sea ice is made of oxygen atoms and hydrogen atoms that are joined together
like a net.  Hydrogen bonding gives ice all of its unusual 
properties.  As ice melts, hydrogen bonds are broken.  The molecules become
more closely packed, or more DENSE.  This is why ice can float on water!</h3>       
<p>
<center><img width=550 height=5 src="gifs/rainbow.gif" alt="hr width=75%"></center>

<h2>4.  Where can I find some SEA ICE?</h2>
<p>
<h3>Sea ice is found in the North (Arctic) and South (Antarctic) Polar regions.
In the Arctic, there is a permanent body of ice.  </h3>  
<p>
<center><img width=550 height=5 src="gifs/rainbow.gif" alt="hr width=75%"></center>

<h2>5. Is SEA ICE the same thing as ICEBERGS?</h2>
<p>     
<h3>No way!  Icebergs are broken pieces of <i>glaciers</i> which originate from
masses of snowfall on land.  Here is a shuttle picture
of the Malaspina Glacier in Alaska:</h3>
<center><img width=384 height=318 src="icegifs/malaspina.gif"></center>
<p>
<h3>Glaciers carry sediment around with them as they move, and these sediments
can be studied to determine where the glacier or iceberg originated.</h3>
<P>
<center><img width=256 height=423 src="icegifs/dirtyice.gif"></center><p>
<h3>This is a dirty iceberg in the Weddell Sea, which is east of the Antarctic
Peninsula.  For more on glaciers, click
<a href="http://www.whistler.net/glacier/whatgl.html">here.</a>
</h3>    
<p>
<center><img src="gifs/rainbow.gif" alt="hr width=75%"></center>

<h2>6.  Why isn't SEA ICE very salty? Could I eat it for breakfast?</h2>
<p>
<h3>Well, along with a balanced diet of toast, juice, and milk, sure!  It is
about as salty as the ice in your refrigerator!  Although sea ice is made from
salty sea water, the salt molecules are rejected back into the liquid as
ice forms.  There isn't much room for salt molecules to be trapped in the
close-knit structure of sea ice.  And as far as breakfast goes, there's even
a kind of ice called Pancake Ice, which are small (1-3 m in diameter) and formed when slushy ice is clumped together by ocean wave action:
<center><img width=280 height=298 src="icegifs/pancake.gif"></center>
</h3>

<P>
<center><img src="gifs/rainbow.gif" alt="hr width=75%"></center>

<p>
<h2>7.  What is it about SEA ICE that we want to measure?</h2>
<p>
<h3>The oceanic processes of greatest significance in the Polar seas
are those related to the presence of ice and include its thickness, compactness
and type, its motion, the presence and energetics of ice-margin phenomena such
as bands and eddies, and the penetration of oceanic swell into the ice pack.<br>
Thus, scientists use the SAR images to measure ice concentration, ice type,
ice motion, ice thickness, and ice margin structure.</h3>

This is a pair of SAR images of sea ice in the Beaufort Sea, Arctic Ocean, 
taken by Seasat, a NASA oceanographic satellite that flew in 1978.  Thick ice
is red/pink.  The ocean is calm on October 5th (dark), and very windy on
October 8th (blue).  Look for the same ice features in both images.  By
tagging identical floes in both images, we can see how dynamically the ice can
move.  In this case, the ice is moving clockwise and towards the right.

This sequence for both the Arctic and Antarctic shows the comparison of sea
ice extent and ice concentration (percent of ice cover) for 4 months in 1988.
Which months have the least ice?  September in the Arctic and March in the 
Antarctic.  How does the ice extent compare to the amount of sunlight?  
Good question, isn't it?  These maps were obtained by a passive microwave
satellite instrument.

<center>
<h1>RAMP</h1>
<h2>RADARSAT Antarctic Mapping Project</h2>
<img width=388 height=300 src="sargifs/ramp.gif" alt="******">
</center>
<p>
The purpose of the RADARSAT Antarctic Mapping Project (RAMP)is to produce the
first fine-resolution radar image-maps
of the entire Antarctic Continent.  As in the Arctic, the Antarctic is dark much of the year and cloudy as well, so there are very few satellite optical
images of the continent.  Thus, a radar map would be particularly useful.  
 Radarsat will
carry a SAR, or synthetic aperture radar, capable of viewing the Earth with
resolutions better than 25 meters.  Data for the project will be acquired over a 
period of 18 days by 

The image above shows the first 50 of 243 data passes over the continent, and 
the center hole will be filled using the radar's extended beams.
The collection of Antarctic mapping data, to be planned
by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, will require an unprecedented rotation of the satellite in orbit in order to acquire images of the South Pole.<br>

<p>
On board tape recorders will store data for downlinking to Canadian ground 
receiving stations and the Alaska SAR Facility.  Data will be processed into images
by the ASF and the images will be sent to Ohio State University for compositing into
map products.  Final products will be distributed through the ASF and the National
Snow and Ice Data Center.<br>

<p>
The Radarsat mapping of Antarctica has generated considerable excitement in the 
earth science community.  The project will complete the first radar mapping of 
a continent on
Earth.  Interestingly, NASA's Magellan project to Venus has already acquired a radar-map of that planet's entire surface.  More directly, the project will provide critical
benchmarks for gauging future changes in the extent, the shape, and the dynamics
of the great Antarctic Ice Sheet.  It will also contribute to the understanding
of iceberg formation and the geologic history of the Antarctic continent.<br> 
<p>
The first Antarctic mapping is planned for October of 1996.  A second mapping is
anticipated two to three years later.<br>

<h1>10 Great Ways to Use SAR Data</h1>
<img width=550 height=5 src="gifs/rainbow.gif">
</center>

<dl>
<dt><h2><img src="gifs/redball.gif">1. Sea Ice</h2>
<dd>The Polar Oceans are unique among the world's oceans.  In addition to the
climatic roles of the polar oceans and their ice covers, sea ice is also of interest
because ice can act as a roadblock, impeding ship traffic across otherwise highly
advantageous marine trade routes.  SAR imagery can help ships find the thinner ice to navigate through and avoid thick ice.       
 
<dt><h2><img src="gifs/orangeball.gif">2. Polar Oceans</h2>
<dd>The high-latitude oceans are biologically the most active regions of
the world oceans.  SAR images show features of the ocean processes that are important for fisheries and biological productivity.

<dt><h2><img src="gifs/yellowball.gif">3. Open Oceans</h2>
<dd>Surface waves of open oceans are widely studied with SAR.  Useful
products from SAR for identifying ocean circulation features include the location
of current boundaries, mesoscale eddies and temperature fronts.

<dt><h2><img src="gifs/greenball.gif">4. Glaciology</h2>
<dd>Most data related to glaciology involves mapping and monitoring of features
and glacial dynamics from sequential imagery.  Products that can be derived by
accurate mapping include the areal boundary of glaciers and ice sheets, the location
of many surface features including crevasses, flow lines, moraines, ice streams,
and ice rises, as well as the detection, size, density, and rate of production of
icebergs.

<dt><h2><img src="gifs/blueball.gif">5. Geology</h2>
<dd>SAR image data for geological studies can be used to make maps of gelogic structural
features, lithologic units, surface morphology (shape), coastal changes, volcano
 distributions and morphology, and surficial processes.  These maps provide
information on coastal erosion and accretion as well as on the tectonic and 
volcanic history of Alaska, for example, including the characteristics of active volcanoes.

<dt><h2><img src="gifs/purpleball.gif">6. Hydrology</h2>
<dd>For hydrology studies, SAR can be used to study the flux and storage of 
water, including snow.  One product is soil moisture content, which includes mapping
the unfrozen and frozen surface condition of permafrost in Alaska as well as the areas
 of wet and dry soil.


<dt><h2><img src="gifs/redball.gif">7. Ecosystems</h2>
<dd>For ecosystem studies, SAR can be used to examine both forest and low-vegetation canopy
characteristics and soil moisture.  Maps of the canopy geometry, extent, and
above-ground biomass using both SAR data alone and SAR data combined with data
from optical sensors can be made.

<dt><h2><img src="gifs/orangeball.gif">8. Volcanoes</h2>
<dd>Large, explosive eruptions of volcanoes affect the Earth's radiation balance
and hence, its climate.  SAR can provide the shape of a volcano plus the different forms and ages fo lava flows.  

<dt><h2><img src="gifs/yellowball.gif">9. Forestry</h2>
<dd> The global forests are storehouses of carbon in both standing and dead
biomass, and they are also critical elements for the hydrological cycle.  SAR
can be used to determine if forests are frozen or thawed, and how photosynthetically active they are.

<dt><h2><img src="gifs/greenball.gif">10. Remote Sensing Science</h2>
<dd>The research activities performed for remote sensing science have provided and
will continue to provide the scientific and technical information needed for proper
interpretation of remotely acquired optical and microwave data.  These activites include sensor
design and calibration, field and laboratory measurements, and data analysis and 
modeling.

<td>This is a radar image taken by the Shuttle Imaging Radar-C showing two
large ocean eddies next to sea ice in the Weddell Sea, Antarctica, on October
5, 1994, The eddies sweep up loose bits of sea ice, mostly pancake ice, in
their rotating currents.  Very new ice is seen in the darkest areas.  First-
year ice is green.  Open ocean is blue.  The image was processed with the ASF
Radarsat processor.  It has a larger size than all the other SAR images seen
here, having a size of 240km by 360 km.  The colors are denied by combining
3 radar channels:  L-band VV is blue, L-Band HV is green, and C-band VV is red.
RADARSAT will obtain images 4 times as large as this image!</td></tr>

in three modes:<br>
1.SAR Image Mode, for the acquisition of wide swath images over the oceans, polar ice
caps and land areas<br>
2.SAR Wave Mode, yielding 5 km x 5 km images at regular intervals along track
for the derivation of length and direction of ocean waves<br>
3.Wind Scatteromenter Mode, using three separate antennae for measurements of
sea-surface, wind speed, and direction<br>

<img src="gifs/greenball.gif" alt="*"><font size="+2">SAR</font>: The JERS-1 SAR is a high-resolution, all-weather imaging radar that can map the topography and geological characteristics of the earth's
surface.

<p><img src="gifs/blueball.gif" alt="*">
<font size="+2">Optical Sensor</font>: The optical sensor is a high resolution
sensor that measures solar radiation reflected off the earth's surface in the visible,
near infrared, and short wavelength infrared.  From this data, stereoscopic images
can be made.

<p><img src="gifs/purpleball.gif" alt="*">
<font size="+2">Mission Data Recorder and Transmitter</font>: JERS-1 also
has a high
density digital tape recorder for the earth observation data collected by the SAR
and the OPS.  This allows recording of data outside a ground station zone, which can be transmitted later when the satellite is in view of a ground station.

<a name="corner"> Don't try this at home, kids...</a><p>
This corner reflector is a radar reflecting device made from a metal frame and
wire mesh.  It suspends 4 different faces of wire mesh that are impenetrable to
radar, but allow snow to drift through it. When the microwaves hit the earth,
they are absorbed by the snow and reflected back up to the satellite by these
corner reflectors.  The reflectors act as bookmarks so scientists can tell what part
of the image they are looking at.  And you thought it was a jungle gym...

This hollow, motor driven fiberglass corer is used to remove a single meter section of
ice for study.  The corer is pushed vertically downward, in this case by a
motor.  Using the core, measurements of ice salinity, ice crystals, and 
structure can be made.  These scientists are doing an Antarctic Experiment
in the Weddell Sea.

<a name="boat">The CSS Baffin</a> is a research ship that is seen here penetrating the marginal ice zone in the Labrador Sea.  The ice smooths out the 
roughness in the ocean, so it is often calm and quiet once the ship is well into the ice pack.

This sled is great for carrying friends and sledborne microwave radiometers.
Measurements of ice properties from the small instruments seen here and in the
above two pictures are used to verify what similar instruments measure from
satellites.

<a name="alien"> A buoy or a spaceship? You make the call...</a><p>
The Argos Buoy is shown here on deformed seasonal sea ice in the Weddell Sea.
It transmits 3 hourly signals to a constellation of several earth orbiting
satellites.  As the ice moves, the buoy moves along with it.  Triangulation by
3 or more satellites enables precise location of the buoy and therefore
accurate knowledge of how fast and how much ice growth has occurred.  The
transmitter sits on the very top part of the buoy, and once its 1-year battery
dies, well, that ends the life of the buoy.

<title>Description by Mark Lucas</title>
<h1>Description by Mark Lucas</h1>
<hr>
<p>
My strategy was to use all seven bands of the SIR to create an interesting image of Sunbury Pennsylvania.  The trick to doing this is to map the bands into numerous perceptual channels.  I decided to use L_hv, C_hv, and X_vv for the red, green and blue channels, respectively.  My selection was simply on the basis of attempting to map the wavelengths from longest to shortest into the optical band; red longest, blue shortest.
</p><p>
With the rest of the channels I wanted to attempt to generate an elevation map.  This map probably has little correlation to the actual elevation of Sunbury, but could serve as a cue to the relative strength of the radar returns across those bands.  Areas where there are strong returns are elevated (the city of Sunbury) and areas where there is little return are at low spots (the river for example).

</p><p>
Finally, although probably outside the scope of the contest, I decided to create a Quicktime movie and perform a fly through (took about a day to generate on a PowerPC).  Our perceptual systems are very good at pulling information out of objects in motion.

</p><p>
Opened Adobe Photoshop v3.0 and loaded the L band hv into the red channel, the C band hv into the green channel and the x band vv into the blue channel.

</p><p>
L-band is 21 cm      	Red Channel  hv
<br>
C-band is 5.6 cm   	Green Channel hv
<br>
 X-band is 3 cm   	Blue Channel vv
<br>

</p><p>
Next I adjusted Brightness/Contrast  Brightness -14,  Contrast +28
Saved as Sunbury Texture in pict format

</p><p>
Opened c hh, l hh, c vv, l vv in multi channel mode assigning each a separate channel.

</p><p>
Created new channel Results c hh X l hh, used apply image to normal c hh then multiply l hh with 100% opacity set on both

</p><p>
Created new channel Results c hh X l vv, used apply image to normal c hh then multiply l vv with 100% opacity set on both

</p><p>
Created new channel Results, used apply image to normal Result c hh X l hh channel, used apply image overlay 50% opacity to Result c vv X l vv channel.

</p><p>
Applied Brightness +16 and Contrast +41 to the Results Channel
saved pict file as SunburryHeight.

</p><p>
Since I intended to sample this image at every five pixels to derive elevation, I ran a Gaussian Blur to avoid sampling errors.

</p><p>
Gaussian Blur with a radius of 5 pixels converted results channel to grayscale and saved as SunburyHeight_blur


</p><p>
Opened Infini D 2.6 from Specular,
Created a new Terrain object and scaled x and y  by 10, centered at the origin.
Under Render:Get Image...  loaded Sunburytexture.pict, applied that as a texture map to the terrain.

</p><p>
Under Edit Terrain, changed the grid resolution to 100, selected image, edit image and loaded the sunburyheightblur.pict as the height map for the terrain.

</p><p>
Created a new sphere object, selected a uniform scale of 100, turn backfaces on, cast shadows off, then applied misty clouds as the texture map to the sphere.

</p><p>
Rendered Image at 640X480 no shadows, no dithering, no reflections, no transparency

</p><p>
Moved around to another view, scaled the terrain height (z scale in object info) to two - doubling the relative height.  Rendered another 640X480 image.

</p><p>
Infini D is a powerful 3D modelling and visualization program from Specular Inc.  One of the features that I like to use is the terrain object.  The terrain object is a wire mesh that can be texture mapped and elevation mapped with imported pictures.I created an invisible cube and made it the parent object for the terrain.  That allows separate rotation control of the cube and scaling control of the terrain and provides more flexibility for devising animation scenarios.  Next, using the sequence window I created events that rotated the cube (and the attached terrain) at 90 degree intervals.

</p><p>
Navigating with the camera I moved to several positions along a flight path and saved them as snapshots.  During this process the animation can be previewed in wireframe and test animations can be quickly generated by setting the resolution to 160 X 120, fast rendering, and five images per second.  Once I was satisfied with the scenario I generated a Quicktime animation at 320 X 240, ray traced, 15 images per second.

</p><p>
Since the contest is restricted to jpeg or gif images, I read the pict files back into Adobe Photoshop and saved them as jpegs.Mark Lucas

2.7.3 --><title>IEEE Biog</title></head><body><b>Anthony Freeman</b> (M'83)
received the B.Sc. (Hons.) degree in mathematics in 1979 and the Ph. D. degree
in astrophysics in 1982, both from the University of Manchester Institute of
Science and Technology, Manchester, England. <p>
	Between 1982 and 1987 he worked at the Marconi Research Centre, Chelmsford,
england, on moving target imaging with SAR, aircraft SAR motion compensation,
SAR design studies and image quality assessment. Since March 1987 he has been
employed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology,
Pasadena, California, as a radar systems specialist and group supervisor. His
group is responsible for calibration of the SIR-C data products and studies of
advanced radar systems. His current research interests are in the field of
multi-frequency, multi-polarization SAR calibration and in classification and
information extraction from SAR imagery.<p>
	Dr. Freeman is chairman of the Committee on Earth Observing Sensors (CEOS)
Working Group on SAR calibration. He is a principal investigator on three
NASA-sponsored studies: one on SIR-C calibration, one on Calibration and Change
Detection using Alaska SAR Facility ERS-1 data, and one on geographical
information systems.<p>

What Can We Learn From the Radar Images?</H3> Kilauea volcano is on the big island of Hawaii.  All of the Hawaiian volcanoes formed when a hotspot from deep within the Earth fed lava through the ocean floor over a period of roughly 100 million years.  The island of Hawaii built up slowly over generations as eruptions added to the surface and raised the height of the land above the water.  <h3>What can we learn about the island from a radar picture of Kilauea?</h3>The big island of Hawaii is the youngest island in the Hawaiian island chain.  Kilauea is one of the active volcanoes on Hawaii; its latest eruption began in 1983 and is still going on, creating new land on Hawaii.  In the image that shows the island from above, you will see the city of Hilo near the top of the image.  Different types of lava flows are also visible, including old flows from 1881 that are now covered by forest.  This is a good example of the unique capability of radar.  Scientists can use these images to map and track the pattern of lava flows to aide in determining which of the populated areas may be in danger from future eruptions.    <P><center><H2>The Mountain Gorillas of Rwanda</H2></center><center><table width=80% cellspacing=10><tr align=center valign=middle>   <td>      <font size=+1>      <A HREF="MOVIES/QTMOVIES/GORILLA.MOV">      <IMG align=bottom SRC="MTGORICN.GIF" alt="[GORILLA IMAGE]">      <br>      Movie of The Mountain Gorillas</A>      <br>      (4.6 MB -- Will take a while to load)      </font>   </td>   <td>      <font size=+1>      <A HREF="RWANDA.JPG">      <IMG align=bottom SRC="RWANICON.GIF" alt="[RWANDA IMAGE]">      <br>      See a Radar Image of the Gorilla's Habitat</A>      <br>      (757K JPG)      </font>   </td></tr></table></center><P><H3>What Does the Radar Image of Rwanda Tell Us About the Gorilla's Habitat?</H3><IMG SRC="1STLESSN/RWANDAFC.GIF" alt="[RWANDA IMAGE]" align=left>This image of Rwanda is a good example of a practical application of radar to understand an environmental issue.  The area shown in the image is often obscured by clouds making it difficult to get pictures using optical instruments such as cameras.

Areas where civilization is encroaching on the gorilla habitat are visible, as are lava flows that have come close to populated areas.<P>  The color variations in the Rwanda image show how radar responds to the surface being imaged.

<title>Why was this data collected? </title>
<h1>Why was this data collected? </h1>
<hr size=5>
<p>You may well ask yourself why we made this movie: </p>
<ul>
<li>We obtained data over the entire San Fernando Valley in order to
study the effects of the Northridge Earthquake - We may also use this
data set to compare with future data sets that may be collected.</li>
<li>This technique of
obtaining topography from interferometric SAR data is still somewhat
experimental.  In order to test it, we must acquire data from areas of
known topography.</li>
<li>  The reason why the results from this
technique are so exciting is the prospect of mapping remote areas or
areas perpetually covered by clouds to such high accuracies.  
<li>There is a
lot of interest from many areas in a global mapping project. However,
before embarking on such a large undertaking, techniques and ideas
critical for the success of such a project must tried out. </li></ul>

<h1>How were these movies made?</h1>
<hr size=5>
<p>All of the radar measurements used in making this movie were obtained
from a
<a
href="/airsar/airsar.gif">NASA DC-8
aircraft</a> (based at Moffett Field) flying at 33,000 feet!  It took
about
5 minutes to collect all the data in the data take,
and about an  hour on a Cray Superserver SMP/APP computer to process
it.</p><p>
The video was generated by using the TOPSAR-derived DEMs and
brightness maps as input to the program Fly! (from <a
href="http://www.pci.on.ca/"> PCI</a> of Richmond
Hill, Ontario, Canada), which simulates flight over a synthetic
surface.  Fly!  outputs a movie of a sample flight path in "j-movie"
("Parallax-JPEG") format.  This was then converted to MPEG-1 using the
"compressor" software of <a href="http://nvr.com/">North Valley
Research</a>, Be
averton, OR.

<title>How accurate is this data?
</title>
<h1>How accurate is this data?
</h1>
<hr size=5>
<p>The resolution of the imaging radar data that was used in constructing
this movie was about 2 meters vertical accuracy with 5
meter pixel spacings horizontally. In making the movie, compressing it,
and converting the format to mpeg, significant
degradation in apparent accuracy has occurred. 
</p><p>
This movie looks best with 16 bit video; it loses some detail on 8 bit
monitors. 
</p><p>
idges in this movie will appear in two parallel locations due to multi
path reflections. Bodies of water are dark - they have
some image artifacts because their returned signal is weak. There may be
locations that are in "radar shadows" due to the
viewing geometry.

<title>What are these movies ?</title>
<h1>What are these movies?</h1>
<hr size=5>
<p>These are movies  and images obtained from imaging radar data.
</p><p>These MPEG movies were derived from a single <a
href="/airsar/">AIRSAR/TOPSAR</a>
dataset over the San Fernando Valley area on May 26, 1994 at 2 am.
The heights are
not exaggerated.
Pixels of like color have the same height (though the choice of colors
is arbitrary). We chose single paths through the data to make into these
mpeg
movies - any path through areas that we have data could have been
chosen.</p><p>
In the 3-D movies, the red and blue/green colors are used
to achieve the 3-D effect; with <a href="glasses.html">the 3-D
glasses</a> on, this movie should
look black/white.</p><p>
   The brightness at each pixel is proportional to the
C-band VV brightness at that spot.</p>

The workshop was ably organized by Dr. KamalSarabandi of the University of Michigan and his staff. Their efforts are muchappreciated. Attendance for this workshop was lower at 35 than for someprevious meetings. This reflects a maturing in the subject matter ( a lot ofthe problems in SAR calibration have been solved) and the fact that ourcommunity was very well served with technical conferences this year (IGARSS andPIERS being particularly well-attended). The attendees at this latest workshoprepresent the 'hard-core' of people working in the field, i.e. the people whoactually do the work of SAR calibration.<p><p>	The workshop was organized into technical sessions and working group meetingsover a two-day period. Technical sessions were held in which three or four20-minute presentations were made in the following technical areas:<p><p>*  Radarsat ScanSAR calibration<p>*.  Spaceborne SAR calibration<p>*  Polarimetric calibration<p>*  SAR processor calibration<p>*  Calibration devices<p>*  Radiometric calibration<p>*  Interferometric SAR<p><p>Two working group or discussion sessions were also held during which thefollowing topics were addressed in more detail:<p><p>*  Correction for ADC saturation in SAR images<p><p>	The technical discussion on correction for ADC saturation in SAR imagescentered on a problem which has affected both ERS-1 and JERS-1 data products,namely saturation of the Analog-to-Digital converter on board the spacecraft.This can lead to a calibration error - underestimation of the radar backscatterfrom the data. A number of methods to correct for this problem in the imagewere debated. The conclusions reached by the subgroup were as follows:<p><p>1.  The design of future SAR systems should incorporate features to minimizethe occurrence of ADC saturation, such as Block Floating Point Quantizers,higher dynamic range ADC's, and Automatic Gain Control (AGC) systems.<p><p>2.  When the problem does occur, the effects (i.e. calibration errors) shouldbe made clear to potential users of the data and software made available tocorrect the problem, where possible.<p><p>*  ScanSAR calibration problems<p><p>	ScanSAR data, with it's very  wide swaths and relatively low resolution,presents a tough technical challenge for the next year for those members of thesubgroup involved in Radarsat calibration. a number of technical issues wereraised during discussion, including:<p><p>3.  How to use point targets to calibrate data with such low resolution(50-100m).<p>4.  Uncertainty in beam shapes and beam pointing angles can lead to largecalibration errors.<p>5.  Over land, the altitude of the imaged site above sea level must beincorporated into the radiometric correction. Large errors (2-3dB or worse) mayresult if the terrain height changes significantly within an imaged scene, e.g.going from sea level on the coast to above 10,000 feet in many coastal mountainranges. This is obviously not an issue for sea ice and ocean scenes.<p>6.  Intercalibration of processors was regarded as a priority.<p>7.  Variable noise levels will be present within ScanSAR images as a functionof both along-track and across-track directions.<p>8.  Geocoding of ScanSAR data has yet to be demonstrated.<p>9.  The gamma-coefficient has been shown to be flat at both C- and X-band overa wide range of incidence angles for the Amazon rain forest.<p>10.  During the recent SIR-C mission, data was collected in ScanSAR mode over afew sites. JPL agreed to provide copies of a sample of the raw data to membersof the subgroup.<p><p>*  Future directions for the subgroup<p>	<p>11.  Following a presentation on the use of the World Wide Web to disseminateinformation, the subgroup decide to set up a World Wide Web server site. Thiswill include copies of the chairman's report, plus lists of references,important papers, and e-mail addresses of sub-group members. The site will alsocontain a link to a Bulletin board for the subgroup members. JPL offered to setup and maintain this facility.<p>12.  As for most technical groups, future communications between group memberswill be via e-mail. <p>13.  We debated closing the subgroup down as a possible option. Given thatthere are still technical problems to solve and with Radarsat launchapproaching, a vote decided by an overwhelming majority to continue with thesubgroup's activities.<p>14.  Activities over the next year will focus on Radarsat calibration. CCRSagreed to distribute the Radarsat ADRO to subgroup members to ensure that theygain access to the data.<p>15.  Kamal Sarabandi is organizing a special session on SAR calibration atIGARSS '95 in Florence, Italy. All workshop attendees were invited to submit apaper.<p>16.  The next meeting of the subgroup is planned for December 1995. The meetingwill take the form of a two-day workshop held during the same week and at thesame place as the December Working Group on Calibration and Validationmeeting.<p>17.  The subgroup's plan for the next five years is attached.<p>18.  It was also recommended that the subgroup organize a special workshop forusers at the first Radarsat Users Meeting sometime in early 1996.<p><p>CEOS WGCV SAR Calibration Subgroup<p><p>Five Year Plan:<p><p>1.  Continue to promote technical interchange on SAR Calibration throughout thecommunity via workshops, special journal issues and conferencepapers/presentations.<p><p>2.  Promote joint field campaigns to deploy calibration equipment in support ofSIR-C, ERS-2 and Radarsat.<p><p>3.  Develop test sites for calibration of radar imaging sensors, e.g. atEdwards Air Force Base in California and Flevoland in the Netherlands.<p><p>4.  Exchange data products between group members to verify calibrationindependently.<p><p>5.  Ensure that radar image data products produced over the next five years arecalibrated or stem from calibrated data.<p><p>6.  Develop algorithms for removing terrain height effects on radar imagecalibration.<p><p><p>CEOS WGCV SAR Calibration Subgroup<p><p>

<h1>How were these movies made?</h1>
<hr size=5>
<p>All of the radar measurements used in making this movie were obtained
from a
<a
href="/airsar/airsar.gif">NASA DC-8
aircraft</a> (based at Moffett Field) flying at 33,000 feet!  It took
about
25 minutes to collect all the data in the data take,
and about a 7  hours on a Cray Superserver SMP/APP computer to process
it.</p><p>
The video was generated by using the TOPSAR-derived DEMs and
brightness maps as input to the program Fly! (from <a
href="http://www.pci.on.ca/"> PCI</a> of Richmond
Hill, Ontario, Canada), which simulates flight over a synthetic
surface.  Fly!  outputs a movie of a sample flight path in "j-movie"
("Parallax-JPEG") format.  This was then converted to MPEG-1 using the
"compressor" software of <a href="http://nvr.com/">North Valley
Research</a>, Be
averton, OR.

<title>Why was this data collected? </title>
<h1>Why was this data collected? </h1>
<hr size=5>
<p>You may well ask yourself why we made this movie: </p>
<ul><li>This technique of
obtaining topography from interferometric SAR data is still somewhat
experimental.  In order to test it, we must acquire data from areas of
known topography.</li>
<li>  However, the reason why the results from this
technique are so exciting is the prospect of mapping remote areas or
areas perpetually covered by clouds to such high accuracies.  
<li>Use of data such as this for urban planning is being evaluated.</li>
<li>There is a
lot of interest from many areas in a global mapping project. However,
before embarking on such a large undertaking, techniques and ideas
critical for the success of such a project must tried out. </li>
<li>AIRSAR is based out of NASA/Ames - San Francisco is therefore the
most convenient urban area to
try out these techniques.</li></ul>

<h1>What are these movies?</h1>
<hr size=5>
</p><p>This MPEG movie was derived from a mosaic of 6 separate <a
href="/airsar/">AIRSAR/TOPSAR</a>
datasets over the San Francisco Bay area in April 1994.  The heights are
exaggerated by a factor of 3 with respect to the horizontal scale.
Pixels of like color have the same height (though the choice of colors
is arbitrary). We chose one path through the data to make into this mpeg
movie - any path through areas that we have data could have been
chosen.</p><p>
In the 3-D movie, the red and blue/green colors are used
to achieve the 3-D effect; with <a href="glasses.html">the 3-D
glasses</a> on, this movie should
look black/white.</p><p>
   The brightness at each pixel is proportional to the
C-band VV brightness at that spot.  The vantage point is <b>1600m above
the (exaggerated) local surface </b>and the speed is <b>1000Km/h </b>(at
15 frames/sec).

<TITLE>SRL-2 San Francisco</TITLE>
<H1>SIR-C image of San Francisco, California</H1> 
<P> 
This image of San Francisco, California shows how the radar
distingishes between densely populated urban areas and nearby areas
that are relatively unsettled.  Downtown San Francisco is at the
center and the city of Oakland is at the right across the San
Francisco Bay. Some city areas, such as the South of Market, called
the SOMA district in San Francisco, appear bright red due to the
alignment of streets and buildings to the incoming radar beam.
Various bridges in the area are also visible including the Golden Gate
Bridge (left center) at the opening of  San Francisco Bay, the Bay
Bridge (right center) connecting San Francisco and Oakland, and the
San Mateo Bridge (bottom center).  All the dark areas on the image are
relatively smooth water: the Pacific Ocean to the left, San Francisco
Bay in the center, and various reservoirs.  Two major faults bounding
the San Francisco-Oakland urban areas are visible on this image.  The
San Andreas fault, on the San Francisco peninsula, is seen in the
lower left of the image.  The fault trace is the straight feature
filled with linear reservoirs which appear dark.  The Hayward fault is
the straight feature on the right side of the image between the urban
areas and the hillier terrain to the east.  The image is about 42
kilometers by 58 kilometers (26 miles by 36 miles) with north toward
the upper right.  This area is centered at 37.83 degrees north
latitude, 122.38 degrees east longitude.
<p>
The image was acquired by the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-band Synthetic
Aperture (SIR-C/X-SAR)
imaging radar when it flew aboard the space shuttle Endeavour on October 3,
1994. SIR-C/X-SAR, a joint mission of the German,  Italian and the United
States
space agencies, is part of  NASA's Mission to Planet Earth.
<P> 
The colors are assigned as follows :  red represents the LHH channel, green
represents the LHV channel, and blue represents the CHV channel.

What 
<em>is</em> Imaging
Radar ?
</h1>

by Tony Freeman, Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory
</center>
<p>

An imaging radar works very like a 
flash camera in that it provides its own
light to illuminate an area on the ground and 
take a snapshot picture, but at
radio wavelengths. A flash camera sends out a pulse 
of light (the flash) and
records on film the light that is reflected back at it through 
the camera lens.
Instead of a camera lens and film, a radar uses an antenna and 
digital computer
tapes to record its images. In a radar image, one can see only the 
light that
was reflected back towards the radar antenna. <p>
<p>
A typical radar 
(RAdio Detection and Ranging) measures the strength and
round-trip time of the 
microwave signals that are emitted by a radar antenna
and reflected off a distant 
surface or object. The radar antenna alternately
transmits and receives pulses at 
particular microwave wavelengths (in the range
1 cm to 1 m, which corresponds to a 
frequency range of about 300 MHz to 30 GHz)
and polarizations (waves polarized in a 
single vertical or horizontal plane).
For an imaging radar system, about 1500 high-
power pulses per second are
transmitted toward the target or imaging area, with 
each pulse having a pulse
duration <i>(pulse width)</i>  of typically 10-50 
microseconds (us).  The pulse
normally covers a small band of frequencies, centered 
on the frequency selected
for the radar. Typical bandwidths for an imaging radar are 
in the range 10 to
200 MHz. At the Earth's surface, the energy in the radar pulse is 
scattered in
all directions, with some reflected back toward the antenna. 
Thisbackscatter
returns to the radar as a weaker radar echo and is received by the 
antenna in a
specific polarization (horizontal or vertical, not necessarily the same as 
the
transmitted pulse). These echoes are converted to digital data and passed to 
a
data recorder for later processing and display as an image. Given that the
radar 
pulse travels at the speed of light, it is relatively straightforward to
use the 
measured time for the roundtrip of a particular pulse to calculate the
distance or 
range to the reflecting object. The chosen pulse bandwidth
determines the resolution 
in the range (cross-track) direction.  Higher
bandwidth means finer resolution in this 
dimension.<p>
<p>
<IMG SRC="IMGRAD31.GIF"><IMG SRC="IMGRAD32.GIF"><b></b><p>
<b></b><i>	Radar transmits a pulse
	Measures reflected echo (backscatter )</i><p>
<i></i><p>
In the case of imaging 
radar,  the radar moves along a flight path and the area
illuminated by the radar, or 
<i>footprint</i>,  is moved along the surface in a
swath, building the image as it does 
so. <p>
<IMG SRC="IMGRAD33.GIF"><p>
<p>
<i>Building up a radar image 
using the motion of the platform</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>The length of the radar 
antenna determines the resolution in the azimuth
(along-track) direction of the 
image: the longer the antenna, the finer the
resolution in this dimension. <i>Synthetic 
Aperture Radar (SAR)</i>  refers to
a technique used to synthesize a very long 
antenna by combining signals
(echoes) received by the radar as it moves along its 
flight track. Aperture
means the opening used to collect the reflected energy that is 
used to form an
image. In the case of a camera, this would be the shutter opening; for 
radar it
is the antenna. A <i>synthetic</i>  aperture is constructed by moving a 
real
aperture or antenna through a series of positions along the flight track. 
<p>
<p>
<IMG SRC="IMGRAD34.GIF"><p>
<p>
<i>Constructing a  Synthetic 
Aperture</i><p>
<i></i><p>
As the radar moves, a pulse is transmitted at each 
position; the return echoes
pass through the receiver and are recorded in an 'echo 
store.' Because the
radar is moving relative to the ground, the returned echoes are 
Doppler-shifted
(negatively as the radar approaches a target; positively as it moves 
away).
Comparing the Doppler-shifted frequencies to a reference frequency allows 
many
returned signals to be "FOCUSED" on a single point, effectively increasing 
the
length of the antenna that is imaging that particular point. This 
focusing
operation, commonly known as SAR processing, is now done digitally on 
fast
computer systems. The trick in SAR processing is to correctly match 
the
variation in Doppler frequency for each point in the image: this requires 
very
precise knowledge of the relative motion between the platform and the 
imaged
objects (which is the cause of the Doppler variation in the first 
place).<p>
<p>
Synthetic aperture radar is now a mature technique used to generate 
radar
images in which fine detail can be resolved. SARs provide unique 
capabilities
as an imaging tool.  Because they provide their own illumination (the 
radar
pulses), they can image at any  time of day or night, regardless of 
sun
illumination.  And because the radar wavelengths are much longer than those 
of
visible or infrared light, SARs can also "SEE" through cloudy and dusty
conditions 
that visible and infrared instruments cannot.<p>
<p>
<b>What is a radar 
image?</b><p>
<b></b><p>
Radar images are composed of many dots, or picture 
elements.  Each pixel
(picture element) in the radar image represents the radar 
backscatter for that
area on the ground: darker areas in the image represent low 
backscatter,
brighter areas represent high backscatter.  Bright features mean that a 
large
fraction of the radar energy was reflected back to the radar, while 
dark
features imply that very little energy was reflected.  Backscatter for a 
target
area at a particular wavelength will vary for a variety of conditions: size 
of
the scatterers in the target area, moisture content of the target area,
polarization 
of the pulses, and observation angles.  Backscatter will also
differ when different 
wavelengths are used.<p>
<p>
Scientists measure backscatter, also known as radar 
cross section, in units of
area (such as square meters).  The backscatter is often 
related to the size of
an object, with objects approximately the size of the wavelength 
(or larger)
appearing bright (i.e. rough) and objects smaller than the wavelength 
appearing
dark (i.e. smooth).   Radar scientists typically use a measure of 
backscatter
called normalized radar cross section, which is independent of the 
image
resolution or pixel size.  Normalized radar cross section (sigma0.) is
measured 
in decibels (dB).  Typical values of sigma0. for natural
surfaces range from +5dB 
(very bright) to -40dB (very dark).<p>
<p>
A useful rule-of-thumb in analyzing 
radar images is that the higher or brighter
the backscatter on the image, the rougher 
the surface being imaged.  Flat
surfaces that reflect little or no microwave energy  
back towards the radar
will always appear dark in radar images. Vegetation is 
usually moderately rough
on the scale of most radar wavelengths and appears as 
grey or light grey in a
radar image. Surfaces inclined towards the radar will have a 
stronger
backscatter than surfaces which slope away from the radar and will tend 
to
appear brighter in a radar image.  Some areas not illuminated by the radar,
like 
the back slope of mountains, are in shadow, and will appear dark.  When
city streets 
or buildings are lined up in such a way that the incoming radar
pulses are able to 
bounce off the streets and then bounce again off the
buildings (called a double-
bounce) and directly back towards the radar they
appear very bright (white) in 
radar images.  Roads and freeways are flat
surfaces so appear dark. Buildings which 
do not line up so that the radar
pulses are reflected straight back will appear light 
grey, like very rough
surfaces.<p>
<p>
<IMG 
SRC="IMGRAD35.GIF"><p>
<p>
<i>Imaging different types of surface with 
radar</i><p>
<i></i><p>
Backscatter is also sensitive to the target's electrical 
properties, including
water content.  Wetter objects will appear bright, and drier 
targets will
appear dark.  The exception to this is a smooth body of water, which will 
act
as a flat surface and reflect incoming pulses away from a target; these 
bodies
will appear dark.<p>
<p>
Backscatter will also vary depending on the use of 
different polarization.
Some SARs can transmit pulses in either horizontal (H) or 
vertical (V)
polarization and receive in either H or V, with the resultant combinations 
of
HH (Horizontal transmit, Horizontal receive), VV, HV, or VH.  Additionally,
some 
SARs can measure the phase of the incoming pulse (one wavelength = 2pi
in phase) 
and therefore measure the phase difference (in degrees) in the return
of the HH and 
VV signals.  This difference can  be thought of as a difference
in the roundtrip times 
of HH and VV signals and is frequently the result of
structural characteristics of the 
scatterers.  These SARs can also measure the
correlation coefficient for the HH and 
VV returns, which can be considered as a
measure of how alike (between 0/not alike 
and 1/alike) the HH and VV scatterers
are.<p>
<p>
Different observations angles 
also affect backscatter.  Track angle will affect
backscatter from very linear features: 
urban areas, fences, rows of crops,
ocean waves, fault lines.  The angle of the radar 
wave at the Earth's surface
(called the incidence angle) will also cause a variation in 
the backscatter:
low incidence angles (perpendicular to the surface) will result in 
high
backscatter; backscatter will decrease with increasing incidence 
angles.<p>

NASA/JPL's Radar 
Program<p>
<p>
NASA/JPL's radar program began with the SEASAT synthetic 
aperture radar (SAR)
in 1978.  SEASAT was a single frequency (L-band with lambda 
~ 
24 cm or 9.4 inches), single polarization, fixed-look angle radar.  The 
Shuttle
Imaging Radar-A (SIR-A), flown on the Space Shuttle in 1981, was also an L-
band
radar with a fixed look angle. SIR-B (1984) added a multi-look angle 
capability
to the L-band, single polarization radar.  SIR-C/X-SAR is a joint venture 
of
NASA, the German Space Agency (DARA), and the Italian Space Agency 
(ASI).
SIR-C/X-SAR provided increased capability over Seasat, SIR-A, and SIR-B 
by
acquiring images at three microwave wavelengths (lambda), L- band
(lambda ~ 
24 cm or 9.4 inches) quad-polarization; C-band
(lambda ~ 6 cm or 2.4 inches) quad-
polarization; and X-band
(lambda ~ 3 cm) with VV polarization. SIR-C/X-SAR also has 
a
variable  look angle, and can image at incidence angles between 20 and 
65
degrees. SIR-C/X-SAR flew on the shuttle in April and in October of 
1994,
providing radar data for two seasons. Typical image sizes for SIR-C 
data
products are 50kmx100km, with  resolution  between10 and 25 meters in 
both
dimensions. <p>
<p>
Parallel to the development of spaceborne imaging radars, 
NASA/JPL have built
and operated a series of  airborne imaging radar systems. 
NASA/JPL currently
maintain and operate an airborne SAR system, known as 
AIRSAR/TOPSAR, which
flies on a NASA DC-8 jet. In one mode of operation, this 
system is capable of
simultaneously collecting all four polarizations (HH,HV, VH and 
VV) for three
frequencies: L- band (lambda ~ 24 cm); C-band (lambda
~ 6 cm) ; and 
P-band (lambda ~ 68 cm). In another
mode of operation, the AIRSAR/TOPSAR system 
collects all four polarizations
(HH,HV, VH and VV) for two frequencies: L- band 
(lambda ~ 24
cm); and P-band (lambda ~ 68 cm), while operating as 
an
interferometer at C-band to simultaneously generate topographic height 
data.
AIRSAR/TOPSAR also has an along-track interferometer mode which is used 
to
measure current speeds. Typical image sizes for AIRSAR/TOPSAR products 
are
12kmx12km, with 10 meter resolution in both dimensions. Topographic 
map
products generated by  the TOPSAR system have been shown to have a 
height
accuracy of1 m in relatively flat areas, and 5 m height accuracy in 
mountainous
areas.<p>
<p>
JPL are studying designs for  a free-flying multi-
parameter imaging radar
system like the one flown during the SIR-C/X-SAR 
missions. JPL are also
studying a global mapping mission (TOPSAT) which will use 
radar interferometry
to generate high quality topographic maps over the whole 
world and monitor
changes  in topography in areas prone to earthquakes and 
volcanic activity.<p>

<H1>SIR-C image of Los Angeles, California</H1> 
<P> 
<P> 
This radar image shows the massive urbanization of  Los Angeles,
California.  The image extends from the Santa Monica Bay at the left
to the San Gabriel Mountains at the right.  Downtown Los Angeles is in
the center of the image.  The runways of the Los Angeles International
Airport appear as black strips at the left center of the image.  The
waterways of Marina del Rey are seen just above the airport.  The San
Gabriel Mountains and the city of Pasadena are at the right center of
the image.  Black areas on the mountains on the right are fire scars
from the 1993 Altadena fire.  The Rose Bowl is shown as a small circle
near the right center.  The complex freeway system is visible as dark
lines throughout the image.  Some city areas, such as Santa Monica in
the upper left, appear red due to the alignment of streets and
buildings to the incoming radar beam.  
<p>
The image was acquired by the
Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar
(SIR-C/X-SAR) onboard the space shuttle Endeavour on October 3, 1994.
 SIR-C/X-SAR, a joint
mission of the German, Italian and the United States space agencies,
is part of  NASA's Mission to Planet Earth.   This image is centered
at 34.04 degrees North latitude and 118.2 degrees West longitude with
North pointing toward the upper right. The area shown measures 40
kilometers by 50 kilometers (25 miles by 31 miles).

<html><head><!-- This document was created from RTF source by rtftohtml version2.7.3 --><title>Science Objectives of Imaging Radar</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" text="#000000" link="#FF0000" vlink="#888800"      background="../JPLRADAR.GIF" alink="#00FF00"><font size=+1><center><IMG SRC = "../CEDLOGO.GIF" alt="[SIR-CED LOGO]"><h1>Science Objectives of Imaging Radar</h1></center><h2>SIR-C/X-SAR Science Objectives</h2><p>	The sensitivity of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) to surface and, in somecases, subsurface geometry and roughness, and to electrical properties canprovide information about land, ocean surfaces and vegetation cover that iscomplementary to measurements made by sensors operating in the visible, nearinfrared, and thermal infrared portions of the electromagnetic spectrum.  SARprovides its own illumination and can therefore produce reliable multitemporaldata independent of weather or solar illumination, through all seasons, and atany latitude. Radar waves penetrate clouds and, under certain conditions,vegetation canopies, ice, and very dry sand or soil, making it possible toexplore near-surface zones  not accessible with other remote sensingtechniques.  It should be noted that 3-dimensional features (e.g. mountains)are enhanced, in comparison with optical imaging sensors, due to theside-looking illumination and imaging geometry.  <p><p>	The SIR-C/X-SAR missions, in April and October 1994, extended the capabilityof an aircraft campaign by providing regional scale data over a short timeperiod.  The mission design also enabled areas to be imaged at differentincidence angles on subsequent days, an important parameter for studying manyland and ocean processes.  The extensive ground truth measurement campaignsprovided critical data to be used in development of algorithms  to produce dataproducts for studying global change issues.  By having multiple flights,insights on seasonal variations for the key science issues is also provided.Such long-term development studies are critical for developing the requirementsand mission design for future radar missions.<p><p><h2>Earlier Imaging Radar Missions</h2><p><p>	The two flights of SIR-C/X-SAR in 1994 differ from the earlier missions, SIR-Aand SIR-B, in that (1) SIR-C/X-SAR was the primary payload, (2) the two flightsprovided a unique look at seasonal change in radar signatures and (3) theastronauts provided round-the-clock observations of the Earth to coincide withradar data collection.  The crew onboard the SIR-C/X-SAR flights had anopportunity to help explore the relationships between the radar data andweather conditions beyond what is possible by the investigators on the ground.<p><p><b>	</b>The first Shuttle Imaging Radar, SIR-A, was flown in November 1981;this was the second flight of the shuttle and the first scientific payload everflown.  There were two crew members onboard.  For the early flights,experiments on board the Shuttle did not involve any crew interaction.  Thehandheld photographs (HHPs) acquired on the mission were assessed along withthe SIR-A radar data.  In several cases, coincident photographs and radar datawere coincidentally obtained which prompted the Science Team for the next SIRexperiment, SIR-B in 1984, to pursue the use of shuttle-based observationsobtained in parallel with the radar data.<p><p>	Pre-mission planning and crew training prepared the astronauts for acquiringphotographs of the SIR-B sites during the mission, but only as time permitted.Observations made by the crew had a very significant effect on the results ofsome the SIR-B investigations.  A photograph of the southern ocean ice was usedto determine the location and concentration of thin first-year ice and openwater which was critical in the interpretation of the radar data.  A map ofgeologic structure, generated from a photographic stereo pair obtained over theAndes mountains, was used in the interpretation of the radar data over thisarea.<p><p><h2>Crew Observations</h2><p><p>	Science observations by the shuttle crew included photographic documentationof the sites on a routine basis and visual observations of features of interestwhich are recorded as notes, voiced down to the operations center during themission, and discussed with the science investigators after the mission.  Theseobservations may or may not be backed up with photographic documentation.  Theobservations describe interactions of the atmosphere, oceans and land surface,and identify unpredicted or transient phenomena for potential imaging.<p><p>	The primary camera used for Earth observations is a Hasselblad 70 mm camera.Accompanying equipment includes three lenses (50, 100, and 250 mm), a data linkto record time, filters, film magazines and various types of film.  The 100 mmlens offers spatial resolution similar to the Landsat Multi-Spectral Scanner(MSS) (80 m) and the 250 mm lens offers Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) resolution(30 m).  With the 250 mm lens, the Hasselblad is capable of obtainingphotographs at the same resolution as the SAR images but with a much largerfield of view.<p><p>	A Linhof Aero Technika and a Nikon F4 35 mm camera are also available.  TheLinhof uses 5 inch film and is useful for photographing large areas withresolutions similar to the Hasselblad.  Lenses include a 90 and a 250 mm.  TheNikon F4 is provided with an interchangeable 35-70 mm zoom lens, and 28, 200,and 300 mm autofocus lenses.  <p><p>	The shuttle provides a number of unique optical perspectives.  A non-polarshuttle orbit provides an opportunity to obtain variable sun-angle photographyover the duration of the mission.  The current polar orbiting platforms (SPOT,Landsat, AVHRR, etc.) are all in sun-synchronous orbits therefore preventingacquisition of variable sun angle data.  From the shuttle's lower inclinationorbits, the complete range of sun angles from dawn to dusk are available; allare useful for observations, although low sun angles are particularly usefulfor highlighting subtle topographic or roughness features.  <p><p>	Sun glint is the reflection of the sun on water surfaces; it representsscattering in the forward direction and is a function of the sun angle and theamount of small scale surface roughness.  Wind stress, waves, and currentscontrol ocean patterns that may be observed in sun glint.  When the ocean iscalm, the sun glint is bright and the area of bright ocean is small.  When theocean is rougher, the scattered light is more diffuse and the bright area isenlarged by wave facets that produce reflections from many differentdirections.  Thus the sun glint can be related to physical phenomena thatroughen and calm the ocean's surface such as wind stress, wave-currentinteractions, and biological or chemical properties of the surface of the oceanwhich can create surface slicks.  In a similar fashion, radar energy isscattered off the ocean surface, in this case in the backscattered direction.The rougher the ocean the greater the radar return.  During the SIR-C/ X-SARmission, the crew was on the look out for sun glint and took photographs ofthis phenomenon.  Some of these photographs can be found in the Oceansdirectory.<p><p><h2>Dynamic Surface Phenomena</h2><p><p><b>	</b>Although the radar can penetrate clouds and "SEE" the Earth's surfaceday or night and in all seasons, the radar is very sensitive to the seasonaland meteorological (weather) state of the surface at the time of imaging.Changes in the seasonal state of the surface can change the radar backscatterby up to 10 dB.  Clouds not only affect the state of the surface as viewed bythe radar, but may attenuate the radar beam by several dB, especially at theshorter X- and C-band wavelengths.  Observations of cloud location and type arereadily made from space.  For SIR-C/X-SAR, observations of the atmosphere andsurface at the same time are very important in understanding the radarobservations for a site, especially when comparing results obtained atdifferent times during the mission.  Radar data interpretation must be done inthe context of the Earth's surface state at the time of imaging.<p><p><p><h2>SIR-C/X-SAR Science Themes</h2><p><p>	The central science themes of the SIR-C/X-SAR missions are examinedhere in more detail.<p><b> </b><p><b>	i)  Oceans</b><p><p>	How waves move through the oceans and how the air and sea interact with eachother play a major role in determining the earth's climate.  The ocean storesheat and energy and air-sea interactions move this heat and energy around theearth.  The Gulf Stream, off the east coast of North America is a good exampleof how heat is moved around the globe; this major current moves heat from theequatorial region into the northern Atlantic allowing tropical plants, such aspalm trees, to grow along the southern coast of Ireland.<p><p>	SIR-C/X-SAR images of oceans are used to study large surface and internalwaves, wind motion at the ocean surface, and ocean current motion.  These dataassist scientists in understanding how the Earth's climate is moderated by theocean.  In shallow areas, radar images can be related to the topography of theocean bottom.  Natural and man-induced oil spills can also be imaged andmonitored using imaging radar.<p><p>	The distribution of sea ice largely determines the heat and water balance nearthe Earth's poles. Imaging radar can be used to study the seasonal distributionof sea ice.  Although SIR-C/X-SAR's was not in a polar orbit (the highestlatitude it reached was 57deg. north and south), sea ice images were collectedover the Sea of Okhotsk in the eastern Soviet Union, and the Labrador sea offthe coast of Newfoundland.<p><p><b>	</b>At high latitudes, sea ice is in constant motion, particularly alongthe ice pack margins, the regions viewed by SIR-C/X-SAR in its 57deg. orbitinclination.  The concentrations of open water, first year (thin) ice andmultiyear (thicker) ice, as well as the location of the ice margin and thelocation and concentration of ice bergs changed from day-to-day throughout themission.  The interaction of the open ocean and the ice at the ice margins isof particular interest; these regions often contain extensive spiral eddies.<p><p>	The ocean is a dynamic system, strongly influenced by the atmosphere.  Theocean surface temperature also has a significant effect on clouds.  Radar issensitive to the manifestations of this dynamic air-sea system, specifically tocapillary and gravity waves, internal waves, mesoscale and sub-mesoscale(spiral) eddies, current boundaries, bathymetric features (and tides), oceanfronts, sediment fluxes, island wakes, currents in tidal inlets and shallowareas, and convergent surface currents in upwelling regions.  In addition, theradar return is sensitive to oil slicks and natural algal blooms whichinfluence the roughness of the ocean's surface. <p><p>	Our current understanding of the geophysical information contained in radarimagery of the ocean surface is often limited due to the lack of other datadescribing the state of the ocean at the time of data collection.Documentation of ocean state in parallel with SIR-C/X-SAR radar data mayprovide key information needed to more fully evaluate the radar ocean imagery.In addition, shuttle-based photography of the ocean experiment sites shows theinvestigators' ships involved in surface truth data collection relative to theradar swath and ocean features.  Observations and photography of regional oceansystems and clouds provides the regional context within which the radar swathis located.  This is more important to radar studies of the oceans than of landsites; the regional context of land sites does not change as rapidly during an11-day mission (at least we hope not!).<p><p>  <p>	<p><b>	ii)  Ecosystems</b><p><p>	Ecologists study life on earth and how different life forms interact with eachother and their local environment.  SIR-C/X-SAR collected ecology data overtropical forests including the Amazon basin in South America, and overtemperate forests in North Carolina and Michigan, and in Central Europe.SIR-C/X-SAR images are used to study:<p><ul type=circle><li>land use<li>vegetation type and extent<li>effects of fires, flooding, and clear cutting</ul>The three frequencies available on SIR-C/X-SAR interact with vegetation ondifferent scales providing three views of the forest.  SIR-C/X-SAR data areimproving our understanding of forest geometry.  By studying changes in forestsbetween missions, scientists can assess the effects that changing environmentalconditions and land use has on forests and in turn, on the global carboncycle.<p><p>	The earth's vegetated surface as viewed by SAR varies significantly withweather conditions and the surface cover.  Recent results of experiments tounderstand the day-night variations in the radar backscatter of forestsindicate there is a strong diurnal (day/night) signature related to thedielectric constant (electrical property) which in turn is related to plantwater status.  When clouds pass over vegetation and cut off solar energy, thephotosynthetic process slows down or stops, water potential rises and thedielectric constant changes.  <p><p>	On a longer term basis, changes in the weather conditions and forestvegetation state over the duration of each mission and between missionsproduced significant changes in the radar backscatter.   <p><p>	Specific phenomena which may be documented through visual observations includesnow existence and extent, flood existence and extent (through sun glintphotography), leaf on/off and/or leaf color (green or yellow/red),deforestation extent and vegetation vigor or greenness which is related towater status.  In addition, acquisition of radar imagery of forests during andafter forest fires would provide a valuable "TARGET OF OPPORTUNITY" data set.Depending on the season, the probability of fire occurrence in particularregions determined specific areas to monitor intensively.<p><p><b>	iii)  Hydrology</b><p><p>	Hydrologists study the global water cycle focusing on processes that occur onland.  (As opposed to Oceanographers who focus on the worlds oceans.)  Inaddition to water in swamps, lakes, rivers, and mud puddles, large amounts ofwater are stored as soil moisture and in vegetation; this is an important partof the global water cycle and plays a major role in surface moisture and globalenergy fluxes.  The amount of water a surface or material contains in partdetermines its electrical properties.  Since radar is sensitive to theelectrical properties of a surface it is useful for measuring soil andvegetative moisture over large areas and how these vary between seasons.SIR-C/X-SAR hydrology investigations are focused on Brazil, Oklahoma,Pennsylvania, and Italy.  Radar data from these sites are being used todetermine soil moisture patterns.  These studies will help develop ways toestimate soil moisture and evaporation rate over large areas.  This informationwill be valuable input to large-scale, regional hydrologic models.<p><p>	Likewise, in mountainous and high latitude regions, seasonal snow cover is amajor storage component in the hydrologic cycle.  Spring snow melt oftendominates the annual runoff cycle and resulting water supply, ground water andreservoir recharge rates.  For many areas, long-term or ground-based snow coverdata do not exist and remotely sensed data provide the only way to acquire thisinformation.  SIR-C/X-SAR acquired data on snow cover over Mammoth Lakes,California; radar data on snow and glacial cover were acquired over theAustrian Alps, the Himalayas and the Patagonian district in Southern Chilewhich contains the largest modern glaciers and ice fields in South America.X-band data are useful for determining snow type, while L- and C-band data arebe used for estimating snow volume.<p><p>	Wetlands are sources of many trace gases that are important parts of theglobal atmospheric cycle.  Wetlands are also especially vulnerable to humanalteration.  SIR-C/X-SAR radar data are used to determine the extent and limitsof selected wetlands areas, as well as their changing conditions.<p><p>	The hydrologic state of the earth's surface varied significantly over theduration of the mission and from mission to mission due to precipitation(including snow) and the ensuing dry-down.  Although it is not possible toobserve either rain or soil moisture visually from the shuttle, it is possibleto observe clouds which could potentially be raining by identifying cloud type,and lightning, which is directly correlated to rain.  This knowledge isimportant for rain and snow experiments.  It is also important for otherexperimenters requiring calibrated radar data as the existence of snow and/orrain within the experimental area may influence the radar backscatter.<p><p><b>	iv)  Geology</b><p><p>	Geologists study the present surface of the Earth and by looking at olderrocks, how it came to be and how it may have looked in the past.  SIR-C/X-SARdata are useful for mapping geologic structures and variations in rock typesover large areas.  These data are especially useful in areas of heavyvegetation and continuous cloud cover where field work is often difficult.<p><p>	Long radar wavelengths (24 cm: L-band on SIR-C) can penetrate below thesurface in extremely dry desert areas.  This allows scientists to map geologicstructures buried under the sand and to identify ancient stream systems.Discovery of ancient stream systems in the Sahara have had importantimplications for past climate histories and also for present possible sourcesof water.<p><p>	The SAR is sensitive to scatterers (sand grains, rocks, etc.) that areapproximately the size of SIR-C/X-SAR's radar wavelengths (3, 6 and 24 cm).Thus a variety of surfaces, from sand to rough lava flows, can be mapped withimaging radar.  These different wavelengths allow various geologic processes tobe studied including soil/sediment erosion, transportation, deposition, anddegradation.  These processes have an impact on sedimentation in rivers,streams, river deltas and coastal environments and affect the amount of landavailable for food production.<p><p>	The radar's sensitivity to surface roughness allows scientists to study thehistory of past climate change and the relative age of surfaces because as landsurfaces age and are exposed to weathering, they generally change theirroughness characteristics.<p><p>	Although the geologic state of the surface was unlikely to change during theSIR-C/X-SAR mission or even between the two missions, the state of the surfacein terms of vegetation and snow cover did change and do strongly influence theinterpretation of the radar imagery for geologic purposes.<p><p>	In addition to monitoring meteorological conditions, shuttle-based photographsfor geology experiments with SIR-C/X-SAR provide information on the geologicsetting and regional context of the radar imagery.  Low sun angle photographynot available through SPOT or Landsat provide a unique opportunity for viewingsubtle surface features to which the radar is sensitive; these photographs areparticularly valuable in understanding the mechanisms of subsurface imaging ofancient river systems in northeastern Africa as they highlight surfaceroughness patterns which may be confused with subsurface radar signatures.Stereo photography provides a three-dimensional perspective of a region.Monitoring of active volcanoes during the mission provides an opportunity toobtain radar imagery of erupting volcanoes and/or fresh lava flows.  Activevolcanoes are observed on approximately 50% of all shuttle flights and this wasthe case for the two SIR-C missions.  Indeed, Kliuchevskoi volcano, on theKamchatka peninsula started an eruptive episode the day the second SIR-Cmission was launched!<p><p><b>	v)  Rain and Clouds </b><p><p>	Throughout the history of radar, one of the main selling points has been itsability to "SEE THROUGH CLOUDS".  Recently, however, clouds have become animportant factor in the future analysis of SIR-C/X-SAR data due to threefactors:<p><ol type=1><li>At X-band (3 cm) and possibly at C-band (6 cm), clouds and associatedrain may attenuate (reduce the strength of) or scatter radar signalssignificantly.  In addition, rain occurring at the time of data acquisitionchanges the dielectric properties of the surface soil and vegetation, thusaffecting the backscatter.<p><li>Clouds indicate wind direction, thermal boundaries and storm systemsassociated with ocean surface state.  In particular, cloud patterns in thesouthern ocean can be used to predict the position of convective storms thusproviding a means of focusing data collection for the southern ocean waveexperiment.<p><li>Clouds limit incident radiation on the Earth's surface and thereforechange the water status of the surface vegetation.  In particular, cloudsdecrease or stop transpiration which in turn changes plant water potential,dielectric constant and radar backscatter.  <p></ul>	Two SIR-C/X-SAR experiments are evaluating the ability of radar to image rain.These investigations require imaging of rain systems and therefore decisions onwhether or not to take data were made during the mission.  The scientistsresponsible for those experiments identified areas in the Western Pacificocean, the "RAINIEST PLACE ON EARTH", as having the best chance for imagingrain.<p></font><table border=7 cellpadding=5>   <tr>   <td><A HREF="../REFERMAP/RADCDREF.HTM">Radar Images: An Overview</A>   </td>   <td><A HREF="../GUIDTOUR.HTM">Guided Tour</A>   </td>   </tr></table><p><font size=1><i>Converted to the IBM-PC by Al Wong, al.wong@jpl.nasa.gov<br><br>Jet Propulsion Laboratory<br>4800 Oak Grove Drive<br>Pasadena, CA 91109<br></i></font></body></html>

<TITLE>SRL-2 - Maly Semlyachik Volcano, Russia</TITLE>
<H1>Maly Semlyachik Volcano, Russia</H1> 
<P> 
This is an X-band seasonal image of the Maly Semlyachik volcano, 
which is part of the Karymsky volcano group on Kamchatka 
peninsula, Russia. The image is centered at 54.2 degrees north 
latitude and 159.6 degrees east longitude. This image was 
acquired by the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C and X-band Synthetic 
Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) aboard the space shuttle Endeavour 
on  April 9, 1994, during the first flight of the radar system, 
and on September 30, 1994, during the second flight. The image 
channels have been assigned the following colors: red 
corresponds to data acquired on April 9; green corresponds to 
data acquired on September 30; and blue corresponds to the ratio 
between data from April 9 and September 30, 1994. Kamchatka is 
twice as large as England, Scotland and Wales combined and is 
home to approximately 470,000 residents. The region is 
characterized by a chain of volcanoes stretching 800 kilometers 
(500 miles) across the countryside.  Many of the volcanoes, 
including the active Maly Semlyachik volcano in this image, have 
erupted during this century. But the most active period in 
creating the three characteristic craters of this volcano goes 
back 20,000, 12,000 and 2,000 years ago. The highest summit of 
the oldest crater reaches about 1,560 meters (1,650 feet). The 
radar images reveal the geological structures of craters and 
lava flows in order to improve scientists' knowledge of these 
sometimes vigorously active volcanoes. This seasonal composite 
also highlights the ecological differences that have occurred 
between April and October 1994.  In April the whole area was 
snow-covered and, at the coast, an ice sheet extended 
approximately 5 kilometers (3 miles) into the sea. The area 
shown surrounding the volcano is covered by low vegetation much 
like scrub. Kamchatka also has extensive forests, which belong 
to the northern frontier of Taiga, the boreal forest ecosystem.  
This region plays an important role in the world's carbon cycle. 
Trees require  60 years to mature in Kamchatka's 120-day growing 
season. The forest industry is managing these forests and 
practicing selective cutting to allow younger trees time to grow 
and reseed.  X-SAR images will aid in mapping these deforested 
areas and in encouraging further recultivation efforts.

They will open up images of atropical rain forest in Belize  and investigate the site from severalperspectives.  Among these images are a false color mosaic, aCompressed Stokes image, a vegetation map and key, various groundphotographs and a map of the area.  <p>After the students have browsed through the images, they are given specificdirections on how to decide what features of the radar image indicate suchstructures as upland forest, clearcut areas, and roads.<p><h2><a href="MODULE04.HTM#SECB">Section B - Death Valley, California</a></h2>This is an exercise similar to the one above.  Students will firstbrowse through the images included in the directory to see what sorts ofinformation is currently available to researchers.  They will then look at theradar images to see if they can produce a vegetation map similar to the onethey have been given.<p><h2><a href="MODULE04.HTM#SECC">Section C - Decade Volcanoes</a></h2>Students will be introduced to the 15 Decade Volcanoes that have beenidentified by the international volcanological community to pose a particularthreat to humans.  Using the Decade Volcanoes as examples, students will beintroduced to radar images of volcanoes that occur around the world.  Thisexercise can also serve as a starting point for studying the other volcanoesimaged by the SIR-C radar.<p><h2><a href="MODULE04.HTM#SECD">Section D - Comparing Radar and Visible Light Images</a></h2>This exercise is aimed at helping students distinguish the differencesbetween radar image data and visible photographs.  Students will look at radardata and photographs taken by the astronauts of three sites: Death Valley,California, Kliuchevskoi Volcano, Russia, and Mt. Everest, Nepal.<p><p><hr><p><a name="SECA"><center><IMG SRC="../LOGO.GIF" alt="[SIR-CED LOGO]"><h2>Module 4 - Looking at Radar Images<br>Activities</h2></center><h3>A)  Belize, Central America</h3></a>1)  Look in the directory <b>/Data/Mods1to5/Module04/Images/Belize</b>. You should find thefollowing files in there:<p><ul type=circle><li><a href="../../../DATA/MODS1TO5/MODULE04/IMAGES/BELIZE/README.TXT">ReadMe.Txt</a><li><a href="../../../DATA/MODS1TO5/MODULE04/IMAGES/BELIZE/SEASATIM.GIF">SEASATim.gif (261K GIF)</a><li><a href="../../../DATA/MODS1TO5/MODULE04/IMAGES/BELIZE/SEASATZM.GIF">SEASATzm.gif (373K GIF)</a><li><a href="../../../DATA/MODS1TO5/MODULE04/IMAGES/BELIZE/MOSAICIM.GIF">Mosaicim.gif (257K GIF)</a><li><a href="../../../DATA/MODS1TO5/MODULE04/IMAGES/BELIZE/LBANDFUL.GIF">Lbandful.gif (1,260K GIF)</a><li><a href="../../../DATA/MODS1TO5/MODULE04/IMAGES/BELIZE/BELIZKEY.GIF">Belizkey.gif (8K GIF)</a><li><a href="../../../DATA/MODS1TO5/MODULE04/IMAGES/BELIZE/VEGMPBYT.GIF">VegmpByt.gif (16K GIF)</a><li><a href="../../../DATA/MODS1TO5/MODULE04/IMAGES/BELIZE/VEGMPKEY.GIF">Vegmpkey.gif (2K GIF)</a><li><a href="../../../DATA/MODS1TO5/MODULE04/IMAGES/BELIZE/VEGMPHDR.TXT">Vegmphdr.txt</a><li><a href="../../../DATA/MODS1TO5/MODULE04/IMAGES/BELIZE/GROUNDV1.GIF">GroundV1.gif (257K GIF)</a><li><a href="../../../DATA/MODS1TO5/MODULE04/IMAGES/BELIZE/GROUNDV2.GIF">GroundV2.gif (11K GIF)</a><li>LBandRed.STK</ul>2)  Display the images and the text contained in the <b>/Data/Mods1to5/Module04/Images/Belize</b>directory described above. Take a look at the images and write down your impressions or thoughtsabout them.<p><br><br><br><br>3)  Locate Belize on a map of the world.

The local climate can also affect how muchvegetation grows on a volcano and how quickly vegetation returns after aneruption.  Recently active volcanoes may produce lava flows that resurface thevolcano giving it a fairly smooth look.  Surfaces on less active volcanoes maybe more deeply eroded.  The appearance of the volcano surface is alsocontrolled by eruptive style.  Some volcanoes produce fairly fluid lava thatspreads out over the surface.  Other volcanoes produce thicker lava that tendsto plug up the volcano until it explodes.Which images have evidence for lava flows? <p><br><br><br><br>Do lava flows always come from the same place?  Why?<p><br><br><br><br>What evidence would you look for on each radar image that the lava flows areall the same age or are different ages?<p><br><br><br><br>6) Go to the image titled <a href="../../../DATA/MODS1TO5/MODULE04/IMAGES/VOLCANO/RWANDA.GIF">Rwanda.gif (408K GIF)</a>.In addition to containing theNyiragongo Decade Volcano, this image contains the Virunga National Park, hometo the last surviving mountain gorillas.

<TITLE>SRL-2 - Taal volcano, Philippines</TITLE>
<H1>Taal volcano, Philippines</H1>
<P>
This is an image of Taal volcano, near Manila on the island 
of Luzon in the Philippines. The black area in the center is 
Taal Lake, which nearly fills the 30-kilometer-diameter (18-mile) 
caldera.  The caldera rim consists of deeply eroded 
hills and cliffs.  The large island in Taal Lake, which 
itself contains a crater lake, is known as Volcano Island.  
The bright yellow patch on the southwest side of the island 
marks the site of an explosion crater that formed during a 
deadly eruption of Taal in 1965.  The image was acquired by 
the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-band Synthetic Aperture 
Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) aboard the space shuttle Endeavour on 
its 78th orbit on October 5, 1994.  The image shows an area 
approximately 56 kilometers by 112 kilometers (34 miles by 
68 miles) that is centered at 14.0 degrees north latitude 
and 121.0 degrees east longitude.  North is toward the upper 
right of the image.  The colors in this image were obtained 
using the following radar channels: red represents the L-band 
(horizontally transmitted and received); green 
represents the L-band (horizontally transmitted and 
vertically received); blue represents the C-band 
(horizontally transmitted and vertically received).  Since 
1572, Taal has erupted at least 34 times. Since early 1991, 
the volcano has been restless, with swarms of earthquakes, 
new steaming areas, ground fracturing, and increases in 
water temperature of the lake.  Volcanologists and other 
local authorities are carefully monitoring Taal to 
understand if the current activity may foretell an eruption. 
Taal is one of 15 "Decade Volcanoes" that have been 
identified by the volcanology community as presenting large 
potential hazards to population centers.  The bright area in 
the upper right of the image is the densely populated city 
of Manila, only 50 kilometers (30 miles) north of the 
central crater.

<TITLE>SRL-2 - Kliuchevskoi Volcano, Russia</TITLE>
<H1>Kliuchevskoi Volcano, Russia</H1> 
<P> 
This is an image of the Kliuchevskoi volcano, Kamchatka, Russia, 
which began to erupt on September 30, 1994.  Kliuchevskoi is the 
bright white peak surrounded by red slopes in the lower left 
portion of the image.  The image was acquired by the Spaceborne 
Imaging Radar-C and X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar aboard the 
space shuttle Endeavour on its 25th orbit on October 1, 1994.  
The image shows an area approximately 30 kilometers by 60 
kilometers (18.5 miles by 37 miles) that is centered at 56.18 
degrees north latitude and 160.78 degrees east longitude. North 
is toward the top of the image.  The Kamchatka volcanoes are 
among the most active volcanoes in the world.  The volcanic zone 
sits above a tectonic plate boundary, where the Pacific plate is 
sinking beneath the northeast edge of the Eurasian plate. The 
Endeavour crew obtained dramatic video and photographic images 
of this region during the eruption, which will assist scientists 
in analyzing the dynamics of the current activity. The colors in 
this image were obtained using the following radar channels: red 
represents the L-band (horizontally transmitted and received); 
green represents the L-band (horizontally transmitted and 
vertically received); blue represents the C-band (horizontally 
transmitted and vertically received).  The Kamchatka River runs 
from left to right across the image. An older, dormant volcanic 
region appears in green on the north side of the river.  The 
current eruption included massive ejections of gas, vapor and 
ash, which reached altitudes of 20,000 meters (65,000 feet).  
New lava flows are visible on the flanks of Kliuchevskoi, 
appearing yellow/green in the image, superimposed on the red 
surfaces in the lower center.  Melting snow triggered mudflows 
on the north flank of the volcano, which may threaten 
agricultural zones and other settlements in the valley to the 
north.

The following window (or something similar)should appear:<p><IMG SRC="SIG0FM02.GIF" alt="[SIGMA 0 FILE MENU]"><p>Highlight the <b>Open Cmprsd Stokes...</b> option.  A window will thenappear which allows you to select the directories and files.Now find the directory <b>/Data/Mods1to5/Module02/Images/Airborne</b> on the CD.Open that directory, select the file <b>SanFranc.STK</b> and click OK.You will now be given the <b>Select Compressed Stokes Image Type</b> window:<p><IMG SRC="OPTIO02A.GIF" alt="[SELECT COMPRESSED STOKED IMAGE TYPE]"><p><p>Select <b>VV</b> and click on <b>OK</b>.

Think of some things about San Francisco that you might have read or heardof.<p><ol type=a><li>What part of this image do you think might be buildings?<p><br><br><br><br><li>What part of the image do you think might be city parks?<p><br><br><br><br><li>What part of the image looks like a bridge?  Can you guess the name of the bridge?<p><br><br><br><br></ol>2.  Run the cursor back and forth onto the Golden Gate bridge. As you are doingthat, notice what is happening with the three values at the bottom left of theimage.  Those values tell you, in order, the X and Y coordinates of the cursorand the reflectivity of parts of the image to radar.  Go to X = 110 and Y = 55.What is the third value?<p><br><br><br><br>This value is called sigma zero (<IMG SRC="MODU0215.GIF">).It ranges from about -40 to +5, where -40 represents almost no reflections ofthe radar pulses and +5 represents very high reflectiveness.  In the Sigma0images, -40 is represented as black and +5 as white, with gray shadesrepresenting the numbers in between.  <p>3. Sometimes it can be difficult to get directly to the X and Y values youwould like to look at.  Let's make that a bit easier.  Go to <b>Image:Zoomin</b>.  What happens?<p><br><br><br><br>4. You have magnified the image and not all of the image can be seen anymore.You can help this by moving the cursor to the small box at the bottom right ofthe image, click and hold the mouse while pulling the box towards the bottomright of the computer screen.  Now you can see most of the image.  Does it seem like you can see more detail?<p><br><br><br><br>5. Go to a spot just above and left of the middle of the Golden Gate Bridge.Click and hold the mouse and move the cursor to the right of the bridge andbelow the middle.  You should have created a green box.Now go to <b>Image:Zoom in</b> once more.What did you zoom in on this time? What can you say about detail in this image?<p><br><br><br><br>6. Zoom in once more.  Find X,Y coordinates 110, 55 now.  Was it easier to findthem?  What can you say about detail in this image?  You will notice that theimage seems to be made up of a lot of little boxes - we call these <b>pictureelements</b> or <b>pixels.  </b>Each pixel contains one bit of information.Although we can make it bigger, we can't get more information from it.	What is the <IMG SRC="MODU0216.GIF">reading now?  Has it changed from before?<p><br><br><br><br>7. Close this image of San Francisco (click in the box at top left or go to<b>File:Close</b>).  Now open <b>SanFranc.STK</b> again<b> </b>(<b>File:OpenCmprsd Stokes..., VV, OK</b>).  You again should see the window below.This is a histogram (a graph) of the number of pixels that have particularreflectiveness, ranging from very dark and  unreflective (left) to very lightand reflective (right).  San Francisco seems to have a lot of unreflectivearea.  Let's take a look at only the portion of the histogram that has a lot ofpixels.  Bring the tip of the cursor into the gray bar at the bottom of thewindow, click and hold the mouse, and then move the arrow inside the bar to theposition shown below.  Let up the mouse button. Click <b>OK.  </b> What do you notice about the appearance of the image now?<p><IMG SRC="HISTO02B.GIF" alt="[HISTOGRAM DISPLAY - ENHANCED CONTRAST]"><br><br><br><br>It will appear lighter than the previous image, because you have instructed thecomputer to make the medium gray pixels into light gray and turn all of the oldlight gray values into white.  This  change in the gray scale lets you  seemore contrast between regions of the image that seem to look a lot alike.  Thisis often called   <b>Enhancing the contrast.</b>8. Bring the cursor back to theGolden Gate bridge, X = 110 and Y = 55.  Do you remember what to do if it isdifficult to find the exact coordinates?  (See number 3.)  What is the numberfor <IMG SRC="MODU0218.GIF">?<p><br><br><br><br>9. How does this compare to the reading you took before enhancing the contrast? (Number 3.)<p><br><br><br><br><b>This is important</b>.  Making changes that help you see the things in the image better <b>DOES NOT</b> change the data.  The radar reflectiveness of thatportion of  the  Golden  Gate  bridge <b>HAS NOT CHANGED</b> just because we changed the way the bridge looks on the computer <p><h3>What are those other choices in <b>Sigma0</b> Compressed Stokes?</h3>1. Your teacher will have explained that radar instruments can be builtthat can produce pulses of different frequencies and different polarizations.The radar band (wavelength) used in the San Francisco images is the L band (23cm long).  Let's imagine now a slinky or a rope.  Perhaps you can do thisyourself.  With a partner, take the ends of a slinky, stretch it out a ways,and lay it on the ground.  Now, while one of you stays still the other shouldmove her/his hand back and forth and make waves.  Since the waves are parallelto the ground, these would be like horizontally polarized waves.  Imagine awindow with a very wide but narrow opening.  Could you and your partner sendhorizontal waves back and forth to each other through this window?<p><br><br><br><br>This is the situation as shown below in Figure A. <p><table><tr align=center valign=middle><td><IMG SRC="MODU0220.GIF"></td><td><IMG SRC="MODU0221.GIF"></td></tr><tr align=center valign=middle><td>Figure A</td><td>Figure B</td></tr></table><p>What do you think would happen if you turned the window 90 degrees so that itis tall and narrow, as in Figure B?<p><p>Now stand up with the slinky.  Continue to have your partner hold the slinkyand this time  move your end of the slinky up and down.  You can see that thesewaves are perpendicular to the ground and would be like vertical waves.Imagine the  same narrow window on it's side as an upright window as we thoughtof above.  <p>Would the vertical waves go through the upright window?<p>Why do you think that?<p><br><br><br><br>The radar sends out and collects horizontally and vertically polarized waves.Some horizontal waves are return unchanged, as horizontal waves.  These arerepresented in the Compressed Stokes table as <b>HH.  </b>These would bebouncing<b> </b>back<b> (backscattering) </b>mostly off of objects that arelarger than the waves or are mostly oriented horizontally.  In the same way,some vertical waves are sent out and collected unchanged.  These arerepresented as  <b>VV</b> and would be backscattered mostly off of objects thatare upright.<p><p><IMG SRC="OPTIO02B.GIF" alt="[SELECT COMPRESSED STOKES IMAGE TYPE - TP]"><p><p>There are, of course, lots of objects that are tipped somewhat sideways and areneither horizontal nor vertical.  Tree branches are a good example of these.They may be pointing vertically, horizontally, or any which way in between.  <p><p>Sometimes a horizontal wave might bounce in such a way that it gets flipped tovertical - or a vertical wave might get flipped to horizontal.  This is what iscollected as <b>HV.  </b><p><p>The correlation coefficient is a measurement of how much alike the<b>HH</b> and the <b>VV</b> scatterers are, expressed as a percent.    Theycould be completely different (0 % alike) or they can be completely similar(100% alike). Thus, correlation coefficient is a measurement expressed from 0to 100.  <p><p>Also of interest are the phase measurements, <b>HHVV, HVVV, </b>and <b>HHHV.</b>These give some indication of how much difference there is in the length ofthe path between two types of collected waves, such as <b>HH </b>and <b>VV.</b> <p><p>2) Open <b>SanFranc.stk</b> again (<b>File:Open Cmprsd Stokes) </b>and thistime select <b>Correlation Coefficient</b>.  Go to the section of the GoldenGate bridge that we looked at before (X,Y coordinates 110,55).  What do youfind for that section?<p><br><br><br><br>Correlation Coefficient is?<p><br><br><br><br>Does that mean that the horizontal and vertical scatterers are mostly alike or mostly different? (Circle your answer)<ul>Alike<p>Different<p></ul>Why do you think that?<p><br><br><br><br>3) Make a box around the area of the bridge we have been looking at. (Clickand hold the mouse as you drag out a box.)  Now zoom in several times.(<b>Image:Zoom in</b>)  Notice that now you can still see the bridge on thescreen as you enlarge the image.  Be sure to drag out the image so that itfills the entire screen (Click and drag the box at bottom right of the image.)After you zoom several times, you should see the option <b>Image:Displaycorrelation coefficients</b> appear in bold letters.  Click on this option.What do you see?  This is a very convenient way to see the correlationcoefficients.  What is the reading for 110, 55?  <p><br><br><br><br>Look to the right and left of the bridge.  What sorts of numbers do you see -high or low correlation coefficients?  <p><br><br><br><br>What do you think might be in the neighborhood of the bridge?  Would there beany difference in the objects or structures doing the backscattering?<p><br><br><br><br>What do you notice about the shade of the high correlation coefficients - arethey light or dark?<p><br><br><br><br>What can you say about the shade of the low correlation coefficients?  <p><br><br><br><br>4) Draw a box in the area of X,Y coordinates 100,150.  What does this arealook like it might be?<p><br><br><br><br>Zoom in on this area several times so that the option <b>Display correlationcoefficients</b> comes up on the screen again.  Go ahead and display thecoefficients.  What sort of readings do you get for this area?  <p><br><br><br><br>Do the numbers suggest that the objects that are horizontal backscatterers arethe same as or different from the vertical backscatterers?<br><br><br><br>What sorts of things might be doing the backscattering?<p><br><br><br><br>If you guessed that this is a park with lots of trees and shrubs, you wereabsolutely right.  It is San Francisco's famous Golden Gate Park.  Sketch atree with lots of branches. <p><br><br><br><br>Can you see why the branches might respond differently to differentpolarizations of radar pulses?<p><br><br><br><br><h3>How could we get an image from <b>Sigma0</b> and display it?</h3>1. Go to <b>File:Open Cmprsd Stokes:SanFranc.STK:TP.  </b>Now go to<b>File:About this data.</b>  Go to the third and fourth lines which read:<p><pre>NUMBER OF SAMPLES PER RECORD   =   _____NUMBER OF LINES IN IMAGE       =   _____</pre><p>Write down the numbers that appear there.  <p>Now  go to <b>File:Save as byte</b>.  Give the file a new name, click<b>Save</b>, and then close the file and quit Sigma0 (<b>File:Close</b>and<b> File:Quit</b>).  <p>This image shows what we know is actually true about the area of San Franciscothat we have studied in the radar image.  Scientists call visiting an area andinvestigating  the site in person  obtaining <b>Ground Truth</b>.  Does thisground truth map match your ideas of what you were probably seeing in the radarimages?<p><br><br><br><br>Now open up the file <b>SanFrancisco.gif</b>.This is a SIR-C image of the city of SanFrancisco, California.  How is it different from the image in<b>SanFranc.stk</b>?  Hint:  the first image is taken from an aircraft, thesecond from space.<p><br><br><br><br>3) List three reasons why it is important for scientists to look and see whatis there on the ground after they deduce what is there from looking at images.<br><br><br><br><p><hr><p><a name="SECD"><center><IMG SRC="../LOGO.GIF" alt="[SIR-CED LOGO]"><h2>Module 2 - What is Imaging Radar?<br>Activities</h2></center><h3>D)  What do Color Radar Images Mean?</h3></a><h3>Computer Activity</h3>For this exercise you will need the following image files:<p><ul type=circle><li><a href="../../../DATA/MODS1TO5/MODULE02/IMAGES/COLORIMG/XBAND.GIF">XBand.gif (74K GIF)</a><li><a href="../../../DATA/MODS1TO5/MODULE02/IMAGES/COLORIMG/CBAND.GIF">CBand.gif (75K GIF)</a><li><a href="../../../DATA/MODS1TO5/MODULE02/IMAGES/COLORIMG/LBAND.GIF">LBand.gif (79K GIF)</a><li><a href="../../../DATA/MODS1TO5/MODULE02/IMAGES/COLORIMG/COLORLCX.GIF">ColorLCX.gif (77K GIF)</a><li><a href="../../../DATA/MODS1TO5/MODULE02/IMAGES/COLORIMG/LBANDHH.GIF">LBandHH.gif (32K GIF)</a><li><a href="../../../DATA/MODS1TO5/MODULE02/IMAGES/COLORIMG/LBANDHV.GIF">LBandHV.gif (33K GIF)</a><li><a href="../../../DATA/MODS1TO5/MODULE02/IMAGES/COLORIMG/LBANDVV.GIF">LBandVV.gif (32K GIF)</a><li><a href="../../../DATA/MODS1TO5/MODULE02/IMAGES/COLORIMG/COLORL.GIF">ColorL.gif (75K GIF)</a><li><a href="../../../DATA/MODS1TO5/MODULE02/IMAGES/COLORIMG/COLORLLC.GIF">ColorLLC.gif (76K GIF)</a></ul><p>You should find these images in the directory <b>/Data/Mods1to5/Module02/Images/ColorImg</b>. These images areof a site in Pennsylvania, in the Appalachian mountains.

This records "HEAT WAVES" and is able to penetrate clouds andhaze much more easily.  Only one infrared wavelength was used in this image.Thus,  it is only possible to show the image as shades of gray ranging fromblack to white.<p> 10) Identify at least five things that you can see on the earth from theseimages.  <p><br><br><br><br><hr><p><a name="SECC"><center><IMG SRC="../LOGO.GIF" alt="[SIR-CED LOGO]"><h2>Module 1 - Mission to Planet Earth <br>Activities</h2></center><h3>C)  Remote Sensing</h3></a>1)  What do we mean by the words <i>remote sensing</i>?<p><br><br><br><br>Remote sensing instruments actually record only the amount of light thatcomes in to them.   On the satellites we use today, the amount of light comingin is counted by a digital sensor.   Whatever it counts is then turned into aset of digital numbers (DNs) that represent the quantity of light.  Inthe SIR-CED program, the DN's range from 0 to 255.  That is, it is possible torepresent the amount of light returned as some amount from smallest (DN = 255) to largest (DN = 0).In the computer exercise below we'll seehow this works.  <p>Consider the following sorts of situations:<p>2) You are an environmental research scientist, studying rain forests.  Youwould like to know what is happening in the area around the Amazon river.Would these views of the earth be helpful to you?<p><br><br><br><br>3) You are a weather forecaster who needs to follow a rapidly buildinghurricane off the coast of Brazil.  Would this view of the earth be useful toyou?<p><br><br><br><br>4) What do you think you would see if you could  obtain a more detailed view ofthe area?  Make a list of a few things that you have heard about  SouthAmerica.  How much closer up do you think you would need to get to see thosethings?<p><br><br><br><br>5) Now open <a href="../../../DATA/MODS1TO5/MODULE01/IMAGES/GALANDES.GIF">GalAndes.gif (151K GIF).</a> What features can be identified in both theimage of the whole earth and the image of the Andes Mountains?  Look at theimages and at a map.  Can you tell where in South America you might be?  <p><br><br><br><br>This is a <b>false color</b> image of the Andes, made by using a combinationof visible light and infrared light.The image is also a <b>mosaic</b> or combination of alot of different images joined together to make one image (a bit like acrossword puzzle).<p>You might like to have a map with you as you look at this image.  The mosaicshows the area where Chile, Peru, and Bolivia meet.  Lakes Titicaca and Poopocan be seen as nearly black patches from top to bottom; a large light blue areabelow and left of Lake Poopo is Salar de Uyuni, a dry salt lake some 120kilometers  across.  These lakes lie in the Altiplano, a region between thewestern and eastern Andes, which is covered by clouds.  The water/ice contentof the clouds is indicated by their shade of pink.  The vegetated Gran Chacoplains east of the Andes are pale green (right of image).  The light bluepatches in the mountains to the north  are glaciers.  <p>6) Think about  the two situations described above (rain forest and weatherforecasting).  In what ways would the <b>GalAndes </b>image match your needsbetter than the Galileo images you have already studied?  In what ways would itbe worse?  <p><br><br><br><br>7)  Scientists use remote sensing to study three broad categories of interest:Land Studies, Ocean Studies, and Atmospheric Studies.  Look at the Earthfeatures below, and place each under the correct category.<p><p><b>Earth Features:</b>ocean currents, rainfall, cloud cover,vegetation cover,presence of plankton, hydrology, disaster monitoring, wave height anddirection, wind speed and direction, meteorology, oil or mineral deposits,geologic mapping, flooding extent, deforestation.<p><table width=80%><tr align=center><th>Land Studies</th><th>Ocean Studies</th><th>Atmospheric Studies</th></tr></table><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><p><hr><p><a name="SECD"><center><IMG SRC="../LOGO.GIF" alt="[SIR-CED LOGO]"><h2>Module 1 - Mission to Planet Earth <br>Activities</h2></center><h3>D) Zoom-In on Los Angeles</h3></a>1) The <b>GalAndes</b> image and the <b>GalInfra</b> images both make use ofinfrared rays to image portions of the earth.  Now we'll take a look at a radarimage of a closer view of the earth.  Look at <a href="../../../DATA/MODS1TO5/MODULE01/IMAGES/LASEASAT.GIF">LASEASAT.gif (424K GIF)</a>.This is an image of  Los Angeles  and the surrounding area astaken from the <b>SEASAT SAR</b> satellite in 1978. The image wastaken from the West.  This is a very large image.  <p>2) This radar image is similar to the Infrared image taken by the Galileospacecraft in one way since it is shown in gray scale.  Locate the city of Burbank.Later we will see what sorts of characteristics would make somethingparticularly "BRIGHT" to radar.  Notice the  darker area just underneath.These are the Hollywood Hills which reach towards the left (West) into theSanta Monica Mountains.  The famous HOLLYWOOD sign is located here.  <p>3) List five features of the city that you can readily make out, such asstreets and  mountains.  <p><br><br><br><br>4) Now look at <a href="../../../DATA/MODS1TO5/MODULE01/IMAGES/LAZOOMIN.GIF">LAZoomIn.gif (467K GIF)</a>.This image is a close up of downtown Los Angeles, withDodger stadium featured at the top center.  What features canbe identified in both the  <b>LASEASAT</b> and <b>LAZoomIn</b> images?<p><br><br><br><br>5)  Next look at the <a href="../../../DATA/MODS1TO5/MODULE01/IMAGES/LASIRC.GIF">LASIRC.gif (258 GIF)</A>image. This is a radar image of Los Angelescollected by the SIR-C radar in October 1994, 16 years after the SEASAT image.<p>6)  In the two images of Los Angeles (<b>LASEASAT.gif</b> and<b>LASIRC.gif</b>), what are some features visible in one image but not in theother?  What differences can you see? What might have changed in Los Angelesbetween 1978 and 1994?  <br><br><br><br>7)  Why do you suppose scientists like to use grayscale images instead ofcolor images?<br><br><br><br>8) Consider using remote sensing for military and weather forecasting purposes.Make a list of advantages and disadvantages for all four different distanceviews of parts of the earth that you have seen.<p><pre>                    Military                         Weather forecasting             Advantage    Disadvantage            Advantage   DisadvantageGalOpticGalAndesLASEASATLAZOOMIN</pre><p><hr><p><a name="KEYTERMS"><center><IMG SRC="../LOGO.GIF" alt="[SIR-CED LOGO]"><h2>Module 1 - Mission to Planet Earth <br>Activities</h2></center><h3>Key Terms</h3></a><ul type=circle><li>SIR<p><li>SAR<p><li>NASA<p><li>atmosphere<p><li>tectonics<p><li>global warming<p><li>ecosystems- </u><p><li>optical<p><li>infra-red<p><li>radar<p><li>remote sensing<p><li>trajectory<p><li>radiation<p><li>hydrology<p><li>geology<p><li>cartography<p></ul><p><hr><p><table border=7 cellpadding=5>   <tr>   <td><A HREF="../../../ROADMAP/GUIDTOUR.HTM">Guided Tour</A>   </td>   <td><A HREF="COVERPAG.HTM">Lesson Table of Contents</A>   </td>   </tr></table><p><font size=1><i>Converted to the IBM-PC by Al Wong, al.wong@jpl.nasa.gov<br><br>Jet Propulsion Laboratory<br>4800 Oak Grove Drive<br>Pasadena, CA 91109<br></i></font></body></html>

The collection of radar images on this CD were not available in oneplace up until now.  Weencourage you to assign students the projects hinted atin this section.  They should be asking the types of questions as:<i>What sorts of information can we get from these images?What sorts of information might require some other approach to getthe answers?

Now you're ready to go off into the wild blue yonder and tackle someresearch. <p><p>2)  The data collected together on the <b>SIR-CED CD-ROM</b> is unique. Mostscientists using radar data have not been able to obtain all the informationcontained in the <b>SIR-CED CD-ROM</b> about their site, without performing alaborious search throughout numerous archives. You have an opportunity to look ata data set, analyze it, draw conclusions about it and report them to yourcolleagues. In other words, you can do scientific research. <p><p>3)  Pick a site from the <b>SIR-CED CD-ROM</b>. Copy the files over to yourcomputer or have your teacher do it for you. <p><p>4)  First list what you know about the site:<p><ol type=a><li>Where is it? Locate it on a map. <p><br><br><br><br><li>What kind of site is it? <p><br><br><br><br><li>What are scientists on the SIR-C team interested in at this site?<p><br><br><br><br><li>What data files are available?<p><br><br><br><br></ol><p>5)  Next look at all the data files one by one. Record your impressions onpaper. Identify and record features (e.g. roads, bridges, airstrips, towns,mountains, volcanoes, glaciers, snow, farmland, deserts, forests, marshes,shrubs, clearcuts, rivers, lakes, ocean, clouds) which can be seen in thedifferent data sets.<p><p>6)  Next, as a good scientist, you need to form a hypothesis. An examplehypothesis might be:<p><p><i>"RADAR IMAGES CAN BE USED TO TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A AND B ON THEGROUND"</i><p><i></i><p>A and B could be any two items from the list of features you have made, forexample roads and forests.<p><p>7)  Now you need to collect together data to prove or disprove your hypothesis.Display the images available for the site again. Look at the backscatter valuesor the DN values for the features you have identified and note them down.Record as many samples as you can and make a table of your results like the onebelow:<p><p><b>Table of backscatter values for Feature A and Feature B</b><p><pre>                     Feature A      Feature B                                                               Sample 1                -9.0        -15.0             Sample 2                -9.4        -16.0             Sample 3               -10.0        -14.7             Sample 4                -8.5        -13.5             Sample 5                -7.9        -14.9             Sample 6                -9.9        -15.5             Sample 7                -8.2        -13.8             Sample 8                -8.9        -15.9             Sample 9                -9.5        -14.3             </pre><p><p>8)  You could now draw a graph of the values in the table, like so:<p><p><b>	Plot of backscatter values for Feature A and Feature B</b><p><IMG SRC="MODUL055.GIF"><p>If you can draw a shape around the samples from Feature A and another aroundthose from Feature B and the shapes do not overlap, you can tell the differencebetween the two using radar backscatter (<i>initial hypothesis correct </i>).If the shapes do overlap, then you can  not tell the difference (<i>initialhypothesis wrong </i>). <p><p><p>9)  What about features A and B enables you to separate them by backscatter? Doyou think the scattering mechanisms are different for the two features?<p><br><br><br><br>10)  Now write a short report on your results and present them to yourcolleagues.<p><p><table border=7 cellpadding=5>   <tr>   <td><A HREF="../../../ROADMAP/GUIDTOUR.HTM">Guided Tour</A>   </td>   <td><A HREF="COVERPAG.HTM">Lesson Table of Contents</A>   </td>   </tr></table><p><font size=1><i>Converted to the IBM-PC by Al Wong, al.wong@jpl.nasa.gov<br><br>Jet Propulsion Laboratory<br>4800 Oak Grove Drive<br>Pasadena, CA 91109<br></i></font></body></html>

<TITLE>SRL-1 - Kamchatka Peninsula, Russia</TITLE>
<H1>Kamchatka Peninsula, Russia</H1>
<P>
This image from the X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (X-SAR) was
obtained on the first day of the Space Radar Laboratory-1 (SRL-1)
mission, and shows the central part of the Kamchatka Peninsula in
Eastern Russia.  The prominent mountain to the right side of the
image is the 1,486-meter-high (4,875-foot) Karymsky volcano
located at 54.07 degrees north latitude, 159.60 degress east
longitude.  This volcano last erupted over an extended period of
time that started in 1970 and continued until late 1982.  During
this decade of activity, there were several quite large explosive
eruptions that produced pyroclastic flows, mud flows and lava
flows.  Other, more heavily eroded volcanoes can also be seen.
The Kamchatka Peninsula has many active volcanoes, including the
2,800-meter-high (9,186-foot) Bezimianny which erupted late last
year.  Other spectacular eruptions also took place from Plosky 
Tolbachik, which was the site of a major fissure eruption in
1976.  These volcanoes are particularly important to scientists
from the perspective of the environmental focus of the Mission to
Planet Earth as well as because of their role as natural hazards.
Because they are so high, and are located at a high latitude, 
the summits of some of these volcanoes actually extend into the
stratosphere -- a part of the atmosphere where volcanic aerosols
and ash can remain suspended for weeks or months, thus affecting
regional weather patterns and short-term climate.  In addition,
many of the 65 active volcanoes in this area erupt explosively,
producing ash plumes from Kamchatka that drift into the airways 
used by aircraft traveling from Alaska to Japan.  Monitoring
these volcanoes with orbital radar and other satellites is an
effective way to observe these natural hazards.  This image was
obtained on orbit 10 of the SRL-1 mission (data take 10.1) at an
incidence angle of 38.63 degrees.  The width of the image is 24
kilometers (15 miles).

<html><head><title>Student Report: Day 5</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" text="#000000" link="#FF0000" vlink="#888800"      alink="#00FF00"><h1>Student Report</h1>April 15, 1994<p>Student Report: Day Five<p>The first paragraph of this report is getting boring and repetitive -- every day all we tell you is how flawlessly the mission is going.  But, then again, it's better that we've got nothing to say than to be constantly telling you about everything that's going wrong.  So, let's repeat it.  The mission is going flawlessly. In fact, things are going so well that two data takes have been added in -- both 'targets of opportunity' that we've talked about -- Bangladesh and the Mississippi River.  We're particularly happy about this because those are sites that we've found over the last couple of days. There's a big difference between working a support position, however important it is, and actually seeing the mission change because of data you provided. <p>Yesterday, our second crew/student discussion took place.  Jon did a great job, and everything went well. We'll let Jon summarize his discussion and give his impressions later. Currently, the third talk is scheduled for tomorrow morning.  Aaron Moshiashwili will be the one speaking to the astronauts.  He'll bring you highlights after his discussion, but probably not until the next day -- we're going to take the day off.<p>Security at JSC is interesting, to say the least. I know that most people have never really worked at a secure installation, so this is worth reporting.  First of all, we all have two badges. The first one is a paper badge in a plastic holder that clips on to clothing. This badge says that we have temporary access to JSC, that the badge expires on the 29th of April, and that we are authorized to enter buildings eight, (which contains the photo lab and other stuff we need to use) thirty-one (which houses EOL) and building 30. (where  Mission Control is located) We need to be wearing this badge at all times. <p>The other badge is only for Mission Control, (there are other parts of Building 30 that we can get into without this badge) which has a magnetic stripe on the back and says, in big letters, ESCORT REQUIRED. Only people who have been through at least 1 mission simulation are allowed freely through Mission Control during a mission. Security is tight during a mission. They close all the computers off from the Internet, and even from the other sites on JSC -- no chances are taken. To get into Mission Control, you have to go through one of three huge steel doors, with no handles on either side.  Each of the doors has next to it a unit that includes a camera, a mirror (behind which I know not what) a magnetic stripe reader, a buzzer for security, and a keypad.  Each of the badges has a number that goes with it, a number that is written down ONCE, memorized, and then destroyed.  To get in, we need to have someone with full access with us; they announce our names to security, we put our badges in the reader, punch in our numbers, step back, and our escort does the same.  If everyone in the group did it right, the door opens. <p>Building 31 is pretty much the same as any other research lab.  If you didn't notice the rooms with labels like SOLAR SYSTEM EXPLORATION DIVISION, you could easily think you were in any of the better colleges in the country. But building thirty is different.  There's just something about it that says something serious is going on in this building.  We've all noticed that even though we know we are cleared to be in it, we all feel like at any moment a security guard could come up and drag us away. It's scary, and it's exciting in a way -- by the same token, we're somewhere where few people ever get to see.  And until that security guard shows up and kicks us out, we're going to enjoy it.<p>Working in a lab with this kind of technology is incredible.  The feeling of being informed about something (and, by informed, I mean nearly totally informed) is strange.  If I want to know something about the weather, I can find it out.  Normally, my knowledge of the weather is restricted to what I see outside.  Now, if I want to know what it looks like outside in Sri Lanka, I can find out in five minutes.  If I want to see what the cloud cover looks over Australia, or the sea surface temperature in the Gulf area, all it takes is for me to move over to another terminal and check it out. I'm told that even with all this, we're just looking at the surface of the world weather situation, but to a layman like me, every question I could conceive of asking can be answered right here. <p>That's another new feeling, the feeling of having the power of information backing you.  It's frightening, but a different kind of frightening than being in Mission Control.  It's kind of like the feeling you get looking out off a cliff.  Remember the old adage, about the more you know, the more you realize how much there is that you don't know?  Well, I've never been as aware of how much there is that I don't know as I am now.  You could spend a lifetime and maybe understand meteorology.  Another one and maybe you'd understand radar science.  One more and be able to figure the inner workings of one or two of the systems on the Shuttle.  And we're among people here who HAVE spent their lives getting that kind of knowledge.  It's a spectacularly humbling experience.<p>Now, on a less philosophical note, here's Jon with his report on his conversation with the Shuttle.<p>Speaking with the astronauts was a really great experience, a once in a lifetime experience that not many people get to achieve, and I'm glad that I was one of the very few lucky people.  At first, I was very nervous and apprehensive about speaking with the astronauts, because everyone is listening in on you while you talk on A/G 1, throughout all of JSC and on NASA Select, and a person becomes very aware that this is not the time to make a mistake when so many people are watching.  Also, since this was a very special experience, I was afraid of making a mistake, because embarrassing myself in front of multitudes is one of my nightmares, but that's beside the point.  Plus, everyone is nervous about what I might say in over A/G 1 to the astronauts, because speaking with the astronauts is a very sensitive area during a mission.  As soon as the discussion began, and Mikey (Mike Kobrick) helped me out with my talk, I lost my inhibition and talked with the astronauts like it was an every day sort of thing, nothing out of the ordinary.<p>My talk was basically an Earth observations update, I made a long comment on how the mission was proceeding from my point of view.  I spoke with them on how grateful we all were for the great job the astronauts on the Endeavor were doing on the SRL, since this was the first mission dedicated to Earth observations, and something new to them about reporting on what they saw from space, not just commenting that "IT WAS PRETTY".  I went on to mention that I had worked over the last two summers preparing a handbook for the astronauts (the reason that we're lucky enough to be attending STS-59) in the areas of the Raco supersite, BOREAS sites, and the oceanographic sites.  After that, I went on to tell the astronauts how their work and the data from the SRL was excellent and in the future we could extend radar science and hopefully understand our world better through radar science.  I continued and I got to get some input back from Endeavor astronaut, Linda Godwin.<p>All in all it was a great experience, and it was all very normal and natural after I began talking to them, like it was an everyday thing to do.  There really isn't much more I can say about the experience, as I am a person of few words, other than I really enjoyed it and glad I had the chance to do it.  I thank all the people at JSC, JPL, my fellow students, CTY, SIR-C/X-SAR, MAPS, everyone else, and JoBea, Mike, and Ben in particular for allowing me the chance to sit in on STS-59 and allowing me to speak with the astronauts.  Thanks to everyone.<p><table border=7 cellpadding=5>   <tr>   <td>      <a href="OVERVIEW.HTM">Student Reports: Overview      </a>   </td>   </tr></table><p><font size=1><i>Converted to the IBM-PC by Al Wong, al.wong@jpl.nasa.gov<br><br>Jet Propulsion Laboratory<br>4800 Oak Grove Drive<br>Pasadena, CA 91109<br></i></font></body></html>

<html><head><title>Student Report: Day 1</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" text="#000000" link="#FF0000" vlink="#888800"      alink="#00FF00"><h1>Student Report</h1>April 11, 1994<p>Student Report: Day One<p>Alicyn Campbell<br>Jonathan Woodring<br>Aaron Moshiashwili<br><p>In the summers of '92 and '93, through the combined efforts of the Johns Hopkins' Center for Talented Youth and Earthwatch's Challenge Awards program, eleven students from across the country worked at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory assembling the crew notebook for shuttle mission STS-59, the Space Radar Laboratory.(SRL)  This April, three of those students are following up on that, working at Johnson Space Center in Houston (Mission Control) as crew support during the actual mission.<p>This mission is the first in a series that will be wholly devoted to looking back at planet Earth, as opposed to looking outward at other planets and areas. The SRL is being carried by the Space Shuttle Endeavor and consists of three different instruments created to image and monitor the state of planet Earth -- MAPS, SIR-C and X-SAR. MAPS, or, Mapping Air Pollution from Space, was created by NASA at Langley Research Center in Langley, Virginia. It will be recording and gauging the global distribution of carbon monoxide in the earth's  atmosphere. <p>Also on board is SIR-C/X-SAR, the first multi-frequency, multi-polarization radar ever to take images of earth from space. SIR-C, the first half of this dual unit, was created and assembled by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. SIR stands for Shuttle Imaging Radar, and C designates it as the third such radar to have been sent into space. What distinguishes it from other such radars is that SIR-C utilizes two frequencies of radar, the L and C bands, and can collect the returns, or 'backscatter,' in up to four different ways, known as polarizations. Each different band and polarization will give dramatically different results and reveal different information about the area being scanned.<p>X-SAR, the X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar, is the other half of this dual unit.  Unlike SIR-C, X-SAR only operates on one frequency (X band) but X-SAR also has the ability to record multiple polarizations. X-SAR is attached to the SIR-C unit, but it was created by a coalition of the Italian space agency, ASI, and DARA, the German space agency.<p>    The radar draws from the shuttle's power source and can see through the clouds, (and just about any other kind of weather disturbance) and can operate during day or night.  Together they make a multifrequency radar capable of imaging the earth more precisely and effectively than ever before.  In fact, the total amount of data to be recorded on this mission is estimated to be about 32 terabits, or a stack of encyclopedias twenty thousand volumes high.<p>As of today, the Shuttle mission seems to be going along quite smoothly. X-SAR had a few problems when it started up, but they were easily corrected and the radar is now working as expected.  The first SIR-C images have been released and already are providing new insight into the state of the earth. For example, one of the images released, of Raco, Michigan already displays differences from previous AIRSAR data.(AIRSAR is Airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar -- a less powerful unit built along the same lines and mounted on an aircraft used by NASA).  The Raco images will be used not only for in-depth study of the area's ecology, but for the radar's calibration as well as to hopefully develop new algorithms to help us further understand the massive amounts of data the SRL is giving us.<p><table border=7 cellpadding=5>   <tr>   <td>      <a href="OVERVIEW.HTM">Student Reports: Overview      </a>   </td>   </tr></table><p><font size=1><i>Converted to the IBM-PC by Al Wong, al.wong@jpl.nasa.gov<br><br>Jet Propulsion Laboratory<br>4800 Oak Grove Drive<br>Pasadena, CA 91109<br></i></font></body></html>

<html><head><title>Student Report: Day 2</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" text="#000000" link="#FF0000" vlink="#888800"      alink="#00FF00"><h1>Student Report</h1>April 12, 1994<br>MET 03:02:00:00<p>Student Report : Day Two<p>As of today, the mission is continuing smoothly. We've gotten some incredible footage, both radar and video, beamed down to us from Endeavor. We found out that our first report actually made it to the site that it was intended for on the Net, and we got an incredible tour of Mission Control. One thing that I thought deserved passing along -- in the control room, there is one plaque on the wall for each shuttle mission that has gone up. After each mission is over, the member of the flight team who made the most important mission-critical decision gets the honor of placing the plaque on the wall. During one mission, for example, a snap judgment call on the part of the booster specialist prevented the mission from having to abort from the air, an extremely hazardous operation. Instead, they got the shuttle into orbit, corrected the problem, and the mission was a success. Guess who put up that plaque? <p>Tonight, Alicyn is going to experience the highlight of the mission, at least for the students -- starting tonight with her, continuing two nights from now with Jon, and two days after that with Aaron, we are all going to get a chance to actually talk on the ground-air loop with the astronauts.    <p>Speaking of the loops, let me describe a little about the communication system that they use here at JSC during the mission. We're working in a room called the EOL, or Earth Observations Lab, and over in one of the corners there is a touch-screen monitor and a headset. On the monitor are about 18 different little "BUTTONS," and each of them represents a communications "LOOP".  At any time, we can monitor as many loops as we like, listening for anyone trying to call us or just trying to get the most up to date reports on each section's work. If we hear, for example, "EARTH OBS, THIS IS POCC COMM ON DATA PC." we know that POCC COMM (The Payload Communications officer, one of only two positions allowed to speak with the astronauts) wants to talk with us. So we push the Data PC loop button once, and change it from "MONITOR" to "TALK."  Then we can talk into the headset and communicate with POCC COMM, or MAPS Science, or any of the other stations. Some of our loops are monitor-only; AG1, the Air-Ground loop to the astronauts, for example, is for POCC COMM and CAPCOM alone.  (CAPCOM is the other position that can talk to the crew.) Because of the loops, a huge room like Mission Control is almost so quiet that you can hear a pin drop -- if you need to talk, you talk to that one person across the headset instead of shouting across the room. There are no ringing phones, and we can pay attention to several different things at the same time, as well as catching the transmissions between the astronauts and Mission Control.<p>So Alicyn will be the first of the students to talk to the astronauts, and one of the very few people in the world to be so privileged during a mission.  We have already been extensively briefed for this -- mission control is VERY serious about what gets said over that voice loop.  Before she talks tonight, Alicyn will go through another briefing, and has to submit what she's going to say at least two hours in advance of the actual talk.  It's a little extreme, yes, but the astronauts spend pretty much every waking minute working on getting all the data they possibly can, so taking even five minutes out is a significant demand.  I don't know about you, but we don't think that this is terribly onerous; they're giving us an incredible chance, and I think that any of us would gladly agree to all of this and much more to get a chance to get on-line with the Shuttle. <p>So, tomorrow Alicyn will give you the report from after her talk with the Endeavor, and we'll once again report on what's going on here at JSC.  Same Net-time, same Net-channel ...<p><table border=7 cellpadding=5>   <tr>   <td>      <a href="OVERVIEW.HTM">Student Reports: Overview      </a>   </td>   </tr></table><p><font size=1><i>Converted to the IBM-PC by Al Wong, al.wong@jpl.nasa.gov<br><br>Jet Propulsion Laboratory<br>4800 Oak Grove Drive<br>Pasadena, CA 91109<br></i></font></body></html>

<TITLE>SRL-1 - Unzen volcano, Japan</TITLE>
<H1>Unzen volcano, Japan</H1>
<P>
This is a space radar image of the area around the Unzen 
volcano, on the west coast of Kyushu Island in southwestern 
Japan.  Unzen, which appears in this image as a large 
triangular peak with a white flank near the center of the 
peninsula, has been continuously active since a series of 
powerful eruptions began in 1991.  The image was acquired by 
the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-band Synthetic Aperture 
Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) aboard the space shuttle Endeavour on 
its 93rd orbit on April 15, 1994.  The image shows an area 
41.5 kilometers by 32.8 kilometers (25.7 miles by 20.3 
miles) that is centered at 32.75 degrees north latitude and 
130.15 degrees east longitude.  North is toward the upper 
left of the image.  The radar illumination is from the top 
of the image.  The colors in this image were obtained using 
the following radar channels:  red represents the L-band 
(vertically transmitted and received); green represents the 
average of L-band and C-band (vertically transmitted and 
received); blue represents the C-band (vertically 
transmitted and received). Unzen is one of 15 "Decade" 
volcanoes identified by the scientific community as posing 
significant potential threats to large local populations.  
The city of Shimabara sits along the coast at the foot of 
Unzen on its east and northeast sides.  At the summit of 
Unzen a dome of thick lava has been growing continuously 
since 1991.  Collapses of the sides of this dome have 
generated deadly avalanches of hot gas and rock known as 
pyroclastic flows.  Volcanologists can use radar image data 
to monitor the growth of lava domes, to better understand 
and predict potentially hazardous collapses.

<html><head><title>Student Report: Day 7</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" text="#000000" link="#FF0000" vlink="#888800"      alink="#00FF00"><h1>Student Report</h1>April 18, 1994<br>MET 09<p>Student Report: Day Seven<p>This is it, folks. Endeavor lands tomorrow, and we're going home either tomorrow or Wednesday.  What a long, strange trip it's been ...<p>Y'know, we've been writing these things for a week and a half now, and I wonder if anyone has been reading them. I'm going to post our E-Mail addresses at the end of this, so that if you get the urge -- to say hi, to ask further questions, or just to tell us that you read these things -- you can. <p>Yesterday was Aaron's air-ground link with Endeavor, and we'll let him speak up later.  First, yesterday's report talked a lot about the outside of JSC, which is interesting, but kind of superfluous.  The really incredible stuff is what's IN the buildings.<p>You already know about the Clean Rooms, Mission Control, and EOL. The only other place that we've got personal experience with is Building Eight. Half of building eight is the on-site medical facility. The other half, the half we've used has video and photo labs, and a computer set up to print photos from laser disk. <p>I've got to diverge from my divergence for a bit to tell you about the photos. An average shuttle mission comes home with three to five thousand frames of photographic film, from cameras high enough quality that they can take detailed Earth pictures from orbit. These pictures are all developed, numbered, cataloged according to latitude \ longitude, main visible features, etc.  This information is stored in a database at JSC called sseop.jsc.nasa.gov, which is public access.  NASA also publishes laser disks which contain several tens of thousands of shuttle photos apiece, which makes it slightly easier to find, let's say, the photos from STS-42, roll 97, frame 143.<p>That's the only other building that we know from personal experience.  However, we've been told about a lot of incredible stuff, which hopefully we'll get to see once the shuttle has landed. There's a building which is set up to run simulations in Mission Control.  It has the capabilities to feed data into Mission Control that exactly replicates a shuttle mission, and they can go through any number of "ANOMALIES," to see how well the ground crew is prepared for them.  Unless you have participated in a simulation, you're not allowed through Mission Control unescorted during a mission.<p>Astronaut training goes on here, and I assume they've also got the standard battery of equipment that you've seen in The Right Stuff. However, I'm told that they have a full array of VR equipment.  The American government is just about the biggest user of VR in the world, for just such applications like this.  The equipment they use today probably saves them thousands of dollars per astronaut in materials used for training.<p>A slight divergence, and then we'll go to Aaron.  If anyone out there in Netland is interested in working on a shuttle mission, this is for you.  STS 68, the second SRL mission, is flying in August.  By then, we would like to have a network of people across the country (or even across the world, if possible) on-line to JSC during the mission. If any of these people knew of anything interesting going on in their area (flooding, fires, anything major that could be seen from space and might make a difference to the radar) they'd write in to us with a report of what they knew, where they were, any and all information that they thought pertinent.  Our information here is limited by what gets put on the Net or in the newspapers.  If it's something like a volcano eruption or an earthquake, we're not likely to get any information until it's over, and while aftermath is probably interesting, it doesn't give us any more information about the way the world works.  So, if you're interested in helping out a shuttle mission, write to either Aaron or Jon.<p>And now, to wrap up the series, here's Aaron with what happened last night.<p>STOP THE PRESSES! Before Aaron says a word, we've forgotten to thank the six most important people in the entire mission!<p><ul>Thank you, Shuttle Commander Sidney Gutierrez.<br>Thank you, Mission Specialist Michael Clifford.<br>Thank you, Pilot Kevin Chilton.<br>Thank you, Mission Specialist Thomas Jones.<br>Thank you, Payload Commander Linda Godwin.<br>Thank you, Mission Specialist Jay Apt.<br></ul><p>These six are the astronauts who served aboard the Endeavour (we've been leaving out the u in Endeavour all week. Oops.) for STS-59, the Space Radar Laboratory. It was their incredible dedication and hard work that enabled this mission to go so spectacularly smoothly. And we almost forgot to thank them.  Shame on us.  Now back to our regularly scheduled report.<p>Here we go. To start out, I was talking to Linda Godwin, the Payload Commander. It was kind of neat because I also talked to her once before, last summer at JPL. No particular amenities were exchanged; the format of our conversations with the crew are a long comment, then several smaller comments with space for response.  I told her about how I worked two years ago in the field on the upper peninsula of Michigan, on one of the sites that they have imaged.  I told her about what an incredible experience it was, getting away from a science class to do something like that, or like working at JSC.  The feeling is absolutely different.  Learning on the job like this is incredible.  What I'm doing matters, and that makes all the difference in the world.  If something goes wrong in a high school physics class, nobody cares.  Here, when someone asks you to find something out and they need it in an hour for the shuttle flyby, you don't get a chance to do it over.  And you do NOT fail.  If you did screw up, I don't really think that anyone would care; they plan for that, and it happens.  But that's not what happens.  You do it.  You do the best job possible.  And if it involves learning some radar science, or meteorology, or computer science, well, them's the breaks.<p>I love it.<p>Anyway, once I got done with that, I noted that I had been wondering how different the training had been for this mission as opposed to her others, and she was nice enough to oblige me by telling me. Pretty much the same thing happened when I wondered what differences she noticed in the state of the world between yesterday and a week before that.  All in all, it was fun and informative, and I got a real kick out of talking to the shuttle.<p>OK, folks, here's where we get off.  It's been fun -- we all learned a little, and nobody got hurt. I hope that you've enjoyed reading these things as much as we've enjoyed writing them.  We encourage correspondence -- that's how you learn, and learning's how you grow. <p>Signing off,<p>Aaron Moshiashwili, <a href="MAILTO:AMOSH@EDEN.RUTGERS.EDU">amosh@eden.rutgers.edu</a><br>Jon Woodring, <a href="MAILTO:WOODRING@USC.EDU">woodring@usc.edu</a><br>Alicyn Campbell, <a href="MAILTO:ACAMPBEL@REED.EDU">acampbel@reed.edu</a><br><p><table border=7 cellpadding=5>   <tr>   <td>      <a href="OVERVIEW.HTM">Student Reports: Overview      </a>   </td>   </tr></table><p><font size=1><i>Converted to the IBM-PC by Al Wong, al.wong@jpl.nasa.gov<br><br>Jet Propulsion Laboratory<br>4800 Oak Grove Drive<br>Pasadena, CA 91109<br></i></font></body></html>

<html><head><title>Student Report: Day 3</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" text="#000000" link="#FF0000" vlink="#888800"      alink="#00FF00"><h1>Student Report</h1>April 13, 1994<p>Student Report : Day Three<p>Allright. It's MET 04/03:10, (Mission Elapsed Time four days three hours ten minutes) flight day five, and time for our third report.  Alicyn's talk with the astronauts went famously -- in fact, everyone here was so impressed that we've been invited into the Mission Control Center, the brain of the entire place.  We've seen it on TV, and we've even looked in from the viewing room right next door, but it's not the same. A little later, Alicyn will tell you what went on.<p>To start out with today, I thought that we would give you all out in Netland some idea of where we are and what we actually do here.  We're working in a room called EOL, the Earth Observations Lab, and its immediate area. In this room, there is sophisticated equipment for monitoring the weather of the world. For those of you who like to know the tech angles, (I know I do) the equipment is, from the ground up : 5 TVs, a VCR, a laserdisk player, a MAC IIfx with two monitors and more memory than I can shake a stick at, a venerable 386sx-33, an impressive 486dx-66, a PS2/70, a 386-33 notebook that we are in constant connection with a naval weather database called NODDS with, a Silicon Graphics Indy, and, on the floor, the most incredible piece of equipment in the whole lab -- a Silicon Graphics Crimson. This is a computer designed to run hyper-powerful graphics applications. We use it to get satellite weather pictures, manipulate them, and use them to examine weather under the shuttle's flight path. There's also a few racks of computers that I have no idea about whatsoever.  We've also got a light table for viewing photos and a thermal printer hooked up to one of the TVs. <p>But I had promised to tell you what we do here.  Earth Obs is usually a minor support position, but STS-59 (the mission designation for this project) is the first step in NASA's Mission To Planet Earth. So Earth Obs becomes a lot more important -- we (the students) monitor world events to search out "TARGETS OF OPPORTUNITY," places on the world where something is happening realtime that the astronauts should be aware of, either to take photos of or, if it's significant enough, to take radar data of.  There are a dozen little things that we have to do every day -- keep track of what's going on in the mission over the NASA select TV channel; digging up photos from older shuttle missions to get another view of the areas that are being studied on this mission; we take notes at the daily weather briefing to send over to whoever needs it. We correlate data; we investigate sites.  <p>There's surprisingly much to be done here, even though we're only in college and most of the people here have doctorates.  Everyone here has been incredibly supportive, though. Case in point.  Pat Jaklitch runs the lab, and has a background in about four separate fields of science including computers and meteorology, and she seems not to mind us underfoot, so I guess we're doing something right. <p>Allright! Now we've got what you've been waiting for. This is Alicyn Campbell's report on her conversation with the crew of the Endeavour.<p>Alicyn : As of today, I am extremely pleased to report that the mission is still continuing smoothly.  The phenomenal success of this Mission to Planet Earth has made an already exciting opportunity to be here at JSC even more rewarding. <p>Yesterday evening I had my discussion with the crew from the POCC COMM. It took place at approximately 7:30 PM, and was an unbelievable experience. As nervous as I was, the days (and weeks) of anxiety became worth it to have the chance to talk to the crew in space about what they were seeing in regards to supersites and a mission I've spent time and effort on. The supportiveness of everyone here at JSC, too, made the experience all the more impressive. The continual faith shown by JoBea and others in me and my ability makes experiences like this even more worthwhile. When I think of the opportunities which have already been made available to me at the age of eighteen, sometimes all of this doesn't even seem real. <p>The sites I have been working on for the past two summers were in the disciplines of ecology, hydrology, and oceanography; but as a biology major and environmentalist, the sites in the Amazon (namely Manaus) have become closest to my heart. I had the chance to update the crew on what I have been doing here at JSC with the Manaus site, and tell them about the first SIR-C image of the area.  Additionally, I was able to inquire about what they've seen so far, and how they're manipulating the extensive amount of camera equipment on the Shuttle to take images of the sites.<p>The opportunity to be at the Johnson Space Center for the duration of the mission is an amazing one. I've spent the past two summers working with JoBea Way of the Jet Propulsion Lab on a crew notebook, and learning about the sites to be targeted in this mission. To be involved in the mission and able to see the goals of the project come to fruition so successfully is definitely an extraordinary feeling. As an environmental monitoring tool, SIR-C is one of the most important devices we as young people will have to combat the damage being done to the planet we will soon inherit as adults. Knowledge is vital in the struggle to preserve planet earth, and this mission is the first of many that will contribute to providing that information. The Space Radar Laboratory (SRL) will have a real impact in shaping what we've learned, and are yet to learn about our changing planet, and SIR-C/X-SAR is the first step. It is an honor and a privilege for me to be here in Houston for STS 59, contributing my time and myself to the mission to planet earth.<p><table border=7 cellpadding=5>   <tr>   <td>      <a href="OVERVIEW.HTM">Student Reports: Overview      </a>   </td>   </tr></table><p><font size=1><i>Converted to the IBM-PC by Al Wong, al.wong@jpl.nasa.gov<br><br>Jet Propulsion Laboratory<br>4800 Oak Grove Drive<br>Pasadena, CA 91109<br></i></font></body></html>

Today's Sunday, and the Shuttle lands on Tuesday.  Things are still going well. In fact, by Friday, the amount of data that the scientists here were expecting to be collected had been. A conservative estimate has to be made, because of all the different things that can happen, but for the people down here, it's like having an extra four days to take data. Aaron hasn't spoken yet -- it was rescheduled for 5:00 today. Tomorrow you'll get that report. <p>We had a very good time on our day off, thank you very much. We visited Houston and liked it less than immensely, and then visited Galveston and didn't hate it but it still wasn't that great.  It was a day off, though, which all of us needed.  All of us have jobs of one sort or another, but none of us are used to working ten or twelve hour shifts starting at seven in the morning.  The work is fun, but it gets to you. <p>Although history takes no notice of such things, it's kind of exciting for a bunch of college freshmen to think that because of research they did, something on a Shuttle mission changed.  Because of our reports of flooding in Bangladesh and the Mississippi River area, SIR-C has taken data of those areas.  It's infinitesimal compared to the scope of the mission, but because of us, the shuttle made a maneuver.  Yes, it's stupid, but I know that I get a thrill out of it.  Our part in it was collecting data on the affected areas.  We monitored the papers, and when we noticed the targets of opportunities, we put together reports with everything from the path that the radar would take to previous radar data to complete weather forecasts to satellite pictures.  And although it won't give us immortality, it's still cool.<p>I don't know what you think of what JSC looks like, but I know that the first time I walked onto JPL, it destroyed every expectation that I had. JSC is easily the size of a small town. It is big enough to have its own roads, and I don't mean just a glorified driveway, either. There are a lot of roads here, and all of them are good-sized. To walk from one side to another would probably take fifteen or twenty minutes. There are enough parking spaces to fit 5,000 JSC employees and 12,000 outside contractors, from Lockheed to Boeing.  There are about 120 buildings, all told, and none of them are anything that could be described as small.  The grounds are very well-kept, though. All the grass is green, and there's a fair-sized pond right out of Building Eight. And there's quite a lot of grass.  In fact, there are many parks that would envy JSC's spaciousness. I think that a popular conception is that a place like JSC would feel sterile, but it's actually quite a nice place. (with the exception, of Mission Control, which is still a nice place, but really is sterile).<p>Actually, there are places on JSC (and JPL) that really ARE sterile. They're called the Clean Rooms, and that's just what they are. They're fabrication facilities, and the nature of the equipment that is being build in them is such that they have to be reduced to a level of sterility equaled by no other place on Earth. These are the places you think of when you think "NASA COMPLEX" -- enormous rooms, rooms so big that trucks can drive into them easily. Pure white rooms, with a bunch of scientists with face masks, white outfits, clip boards, and lots of delicate tools put together some of the most complex equipment ever assembled. <p>To get into the Clean Room where SIR-C/X-SAR was assembled, Jon and Alicyn went through a chamber that blew all of the dust off of their clothing and vacuumed it up, and another area where they had to step on stuff which removed all the dirt from their shoes.  Inside, a stream of air is constantly blowing through the room to get rid of any free-floating dust.  And that room was relatively dirty by Clean Room standards.  It was a level 100,000 room, which means that for every cubic (something; I'm honestly not sure. I think meter, but it could just as easily be foot or yard) there are only 100,000 particles of dust.  NASA has Clean Rooms that go all the way down to level 1 -- a single particle of dust for every cubic whatever.  That we have the technology to do that -- to take a room and remove all traces of the Earth outside of it, to make it an absolutely artificial environment -- is incredibly impressive.  I can't imagine the rooms themselves, however, being anything but depressing, and maybe even frightening.  On the other hand, these literally ARE the rooms where dreams are built ... that's far from depressing.  But it's still an environment entirely different from that which Man was meant to inhabit.  Powerful stuff.<p>We've been here for a week, now, and a lot has changed.  While last Sunday it was comfortable working here nearly alone, now it feels empty.  There's no-one here to answer questions, no odd requests for information coming in over the loop. It's a lot less hectic, but there's a less to do.  It's different.  It's the weekend. Everyone but us is home resting.  Oh well, two days left.<p>I wish that there was more to tell you.  Friday we mostly did research, finding out what people need to know.  Fun work, and important to the people who need the data, but not worth writing about.  I guess that the report ends here -- tomorrow we'll at least have Aaron's report. Until then ...<p><table border=7 cellpadding=5>   <tr>   <td>      <a href="OVERVIEW.HTM">Student Reports: Overview      </a>   </td>   </tr></table><p><font size=1><i>Converted to the IBM-PC by Al Wong, al.wong@jpl.nasa.gov<br><br>Jet Propulsion Laboratory<br>4800 Oak Grove Drive<br>Pasadena, CA 91109<br></i></font></body></html>

<html><head><title>Student Report: Day 4</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" text="#000000" link="#FF0000" vlink="#888800"      alink="#00FF00"><h1>Student Report</h1>April 14, 1994<p>Student Report: Day Four<p>The mission is still moving along according to plan. The shuttle, as always, has had minor problems, as is to be expected of anything that complex, but nothing big enough to bother the mission. In fact, the biggest problem so far has been bubbles in the crew's water supply.  We are continuing to locate target sites of opportunity, and monitor what's going on in the world.  Yesterday, (because of Alicyn's spectacular talk with the crew) we were fortunate enough to get to see the Mission Control Center up close.  We were escorted in, and were able to sit and listen in with the CAPCOM and ask questions.  The CAPCOM is the only station besides POCC COMM where individuals on the ground can talk to the crew in space. While POCC COMM's are usually scientists from the project, CAPCOMs are astronauts. CAPCOM is a crew/ground relations position; CAPCOM, being astronauts themselves, know intimately what it's like up in the shuttle, and can better understand the needs of the astronauts. The CAPCOM on duty had flown twice before, and also was a CAPCOM on the Hubble repair mission, as well as being one of the backup astronauts for that mission.  We were really lucky to get to go in to the Mission Control Center, and it was an amazing experience.  We work pretty long hours, but the rewards are worth it by far. <p>We've given you a lot of background on our mission, on what we do and why we've been doing it, but two things we haven't mentioned are the two most important people on our trip. The first is Scott Milroy. He works with CTY, the Johns Hopkins Center for Talented Youth, and he coordinates the Challenge Awards, the program that got us all started along the road that eventually led us here.  He's in Houston with us, as both a chaperone and as a friend.  Plus, he's the only one old enough to rent a car.<p>The other person is JoBea Way, whose name we've mentioned several times in the past but whose role we've never fully qualified.  She's the JPL scientist who has been our sponsor and our mentor for the last several years. Alicyn started working with her three years ago, for her original Challenge Awards project in Alaska. Alicyn and Jon both worked with JoBea two years ago, for their first Challenge Awards Graduate project, for a week here at JSC and a week at JPL. The year after that, Aaron (as well as four others) joined them for six weeks at JPL, putting together one of the training notebooks that the crew used for this mission. JoBea is incredibly enthusiastic about everything she does, and especially our involvement in this project.  She has been working up to this mission for years, and seems to be about as excited as we are about being here.  If it wasn't for her incredible support and dedication, we would never have had this chance.  Honestly, not enough can be said in praise of either Scott or Jobea, as well as Ben Holt, an oceanographer at JPL, who has worked very closely with us; the Durfee Foundation, a philanthropic organization which has funded this experience from the start; or any of the hundred and a half other people who have helped make this what it is.<p>Yesterday JoBea participated in a press conference updating the progress of the ecology sites on the mission.  She showed some of the SIR-C images that have been downloaded so far, and they looked great.  She also used some of the things that we've put together (maps, photo mosaics, etc.).  It was really exciting to see work we did contributing to the mission, and to see someone we know so well giving the press the mission status update. <p>Another exciting event will take place this evening. At approximately 5:26 PM CDT, or Mission Elapsed Time 05/13:20, our second student/crew discussion will take place.  This time it's Jon's turn, and everyone expects him to do wonderfully. For those of you who happen to get it, the cable channel NASA Select carries our conversations live.  In tomorrow's student report we will have Jon's report from his discussion. <p>Meanwhile, we're putting together a videotape from all the footage that the Shuttle has beamed down.  There's a video camera on board Endeavor, and through the two TDRS satellites we can (and certainly do!) receive live video of the Earth (and happenings on-board the shuttle) much of the time.  So we're going through the tapes to find the best views, and assemble them into a coherent videotape to be sent out.  If you have any interest in that kind of thing at all, we're going to try to make the tape available to the public -- you'll get more updates on that as it develops.  All I can say about it is that the sunrise over the edge of the Earth is one of the most incredibly beautiful sights I've ever seen.  Maybe someday I won't have to watch it from a video screen...<p><table border=7 cellpadding=5>   <tr>   <td>      <a href="OVERVIEW.HTM">Student Reports: Overview      </a>   </td>   </tr></table><p><font size=1><i>Converted to the IBM-PC by Al Wong, al.wong@jpl.nasa.gov<br><br>Jet Propulsion Laboratory<br>4800 Oak Grove Drive<br>Pasadena, CA 91109<br></i></font></body></html>

<TITLE>SRL-2 - Rabaul volcano, New Guinea</TITLE>
<H1>Rabaul volcano, New Guinea</H1>
<P>
This is a  radar image of the Rabaul volcano on the island 
of New Britain, Papua New Guinea taken almost a month after 
its September 19, 1994, eruption that killed five people and 
covered the town of  Rabaul and nearby villages with up to 
75 centimeters (30 inches) of ash.  More than 53,000 people 
have been displaced by the eruption.  The image was acquired 
by the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-band Synthetic Aperture 
Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) aboard the space shuttle Endeavour on 
its 173rd orbit on October 11, 1994.  This image is centered 
at 4.2 degrees south latitude and 152.2 degrees east 
longitude in the southwest Pacific Ocean. The area shown is 
approximately 21 kilometers by 25 kilometers (13 miles by 
15.5 miles).  North is toward the upper right. The colors in 
this image were obtained using the following radar channels: 
red represents the L-band (horizontally transmitted and 
received); green represents the L-band (horizontally 
transmitted and vertically received); blue represents the C-
band (horizontally transmitted and vertically received). 
Most of the Rabaul volcano is underwater and the caldera 
(crater) creates Blanche Bay, the semi-circular body of 
water that occupies most of  the center of the image.  
Volcanic vents within the caldera are visible in the image 
and include Vulcan, on a peninsula on the west side of the 
bay, and Rabalanakaia and Tavurvur (the circular purple 
feature near the mouth of  the bay) on the east side.  Both 
Vulcan and Tavurvur were active during the 1994 eruption.  
Ash deposits appear red-orange on the image, and are most 
prominent on the south flanks of Vulcan and north and 
northwest of Tavurvur. A faint blue patch in the water in 
the center of the image is a large raft of floating pumice 
fragments that were ejected from Vulcan during the eruption 
and clog the inner bay.  Visible on the east side of the bay 
are the grid-like patterns of the streets of Rabaul and an 
airstrip, which appears as a dark northwest-trending band at 
the right-center of the image.  Ashfall and subsequent rains 
caused the collapse of most buildings in the town of Rabaul.  
Mudflows and flooding continue to pose serious threats to 
the town and surrounding villages.  Volcanologists and local 
authorities expect to use data such as this radar image to 
assist them in identifying the mechanisms of the eruption 
and future hazardous conditions that may be associated with 
the vigorously active volcano.

<TITLE>SRL-2 - Colima Volcano, Mexico</TITLE>
<H1>Colima Volcano, Mexico</H1> 
<P> 
This is an image of the Colima volcano in Jalisco, Mexico, a 
vigorously active volcano that  erupted as recently as July 
1994.  The eruption partially destroyed a lava dome at the 
summit and deposited a new layer of ash on the volcano's 
southern slopes. Surrounding communities face a continuing 
threat of ashfalls and volcanic mudflows from the volcano, 
which has been designated one of 15 high-risk volcanoes for 
scientific study during the next decade.  This image was 
acquired by the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C and X-band 
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) aboard the space 
shuttle Endeavour on its 24th orbit on October 1, 1994. The 
image is centered at 19.4 degrees north latitude, 103.7 
degrees west longitude.  The area shown is approximately 
35.7 kilometers by 37.5 kilometers (22 miles by 23 miles). 
This single-frequency, multi-polarized SIR-C image shows: 
red as L-band horizontally transmitted and received; green 
as L-band horizontally transmitted and vertically received; 
and blue as the ratio of the two channels. The summit area 
appears orange and the recent deposits fill the valleys 
along the south and southwest slopes.  Observations from 
space are helping scientists understand the behavior of 
dangerous volcanoes and will be used to mitigate the effects 
of future eruptions on surrounding populations.

<TITLE>SRL-2 - Mammoth Mountain, California</TITLE>
<H1>Mammoth Mountain, California</H1> 
<P> 
This false-color composite radar image of the Mammoth Mountain 
area in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, California, was acquired by 
the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C and X-band Synthetic Aperture 
Radar aboard the space shuttle Endeavour on its 67th orbit on 
October 3, 1994. The image is centered at 37.6 degrees north 
latitude and 119.0 degrees west longitude. The area is about 39 
kilometers by 51 kilometers (24 miles by 31 miles).  North is 
toward the bottom, about 45 degrees to the right. In this image, 
red was created using L-band (horizontally transmitted/ 
vertically received) polarization data; green was created using 
C-band (horizontally transmitted/vertically received) 
polarization data; and blue was created using C-band 
(horizontally transmitted and received) polarization data. 
Crawley Lake appears dark at the center left of the image, just 
above or south of Long Valley. The Mammoth Mountain ski area is 
visible at the top right of the scene. The red areas correspond 
to forests, the dark blue areas are bare surfaces and the green 
areas are short vegetation, mainly brush. The purple areas at 
the higher elevations in the upper part of the scene are 
discontinuous patches of snow cover from a September 28 storm. 
New, very thin snow was falling before and during the second 
space shuttle pass. In parallel with the operational SIR-C data 
processing, an experimental effort is being conducted to test 
SAR data processing using the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's 
massively parallel supercomputing facility, centered around the 
Cray Research T3D . These experiments will assess the abilities 
of large supercomputers to produce high throughput Synthetic 
Aperture Radar processing in preparation for upcoming data-
intensive SAR missions. The image released here was produced as 
part of this experimental effort.

<TITLE>SRL-1 - Kilauea, Hawaii</TITLE>
<H1>Kilauea, Hawaii</H1>
<P>
This color composite C-band and L-band image of the Kilauea
volcano on the Big Island of Hawaii was acquired by the
Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-band Synthetic Aperature Radar (SIR-
C/X-SAR) flying on space shuttle Endeavour.  The city of Hilo can
be seen at the top.  The image shows the different types of lava
flows around the crater Pu'u O'o.  Ash deposits which erupted in
1790 from the summit of Kilauea volcano show up as dark in this
image, and fine details associated with lava flows which erupted
in 1919 and 1974 can be seen to the south of the summit in an
area called the Ka'u Desert.  In addition, the other historic
lava flows created in 1881 and 1984 from Mauna Loa volcano (out
of view to the left of this image) can be easily seen despite the
fact that the surrounding area is covered by forest.  Such
information will be used to map the extent of such flows, which
can pose a hazard to the subdivisions of Hilo.  Highway 11 is the
linear feature running from Hilo to the Kilauea volcano.  The
Kilauea volcano has been almost continuously active for more than
the last 11 years.  Field teams that were on the ground
specifically to support these radar observations report that
there was vigorous surface activity about 400 meters (one-quarter
mile) inland from the coast.  A moving lava flow about 200 meters
(660 feet) in length was observed at the time of the shuttle
overflight, raising the possibility that subsequent images taken
during this mission will show changes in the landscape.

<TITLE>SRL-2 - Kliuchevskoi Volcano optical/radar comparison</TITLE>
<H1>Kliuchevskoi Volcano optical/radar comparison</H1> 
<P> 
This comparison shows optical and radar imaging of Kliuchevshoi
volcano in Kamchatka, Russia, which began to erupt on September
30, 1994, as space shuttle mission STS-68 was beginning with its
Spaceborne Imaging Radar C/X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar
(SIR-C/X-SAR) payload.
<P>
The optical photo at left was taken by shuttle astronauts during
the early hours of the eruption on September 30.  The ash plume,
which reached heights of more than 18 kilometers (50,000 feet), is 
emerging from a vent on the north flank of Kliuchevskoi, partially hidden 
by the plume and its shadow in this view.  The photograph is 
oriented with north toward the bottom, for comparison with 
the radar image at right acquired a few 
days later.  Near the center of the photo, a small whitish 
steam plume may be seen emanating from the growing lava dome 
of a companion volcano, Bezymianny.
<P>
In the radar image at right, Kliuchevskoi is the blue triangular peak in 
the center of the image, towards the left edge of the bright red 
area that delineates bare snow cover.  The image was 
acquired by SIR-C/X-SAR aboard the space shuttle 
Endeavour on its 88th orbit on October 5, 1994.  The image 
shows an area approximately 75 kilometers by 100 kilometers 
(46 miles by 62 miles) that is centered at 56.07 degrees 
north latitude and 160.84 degrees east longitude.  North is 
toward the bottom of the image.  The radar illumination is 
from the top of the image.  The Kamchatka volcanoes are 
among the most active volcanoes in the world.  The volcanic 
zone sits above a tectonic plate boundary, where the Pacific 
plate is sinking beneath the northeast edge of the Eurasian 
plate. The Endeavour crew obtained dramatic video and 
photographic images of this region during the eruption, 
which will assist scientists in analyzing the dynamics of 
the recent activity. The colors in this image were obtained 
using the following radar channels: red represents the L-
band (horizontally transmitted and received); green 
represents the L-band (horizontally transmitted and 
vertically received); blue represents the C-band 
(horizontally transmitted and vertically received).  In 
addition to Kliuchevskoi, two other active volcanoes are 
visible in the image.  Bezymianny, the circular crater above 
and to the right of Kliuchevskoi, contains a slowly growing 
lava dome.  Tolbachik is the large volcano with a dark 
summit crater near the upper right edge of the red snow 
covered area.  The Kamchatka River runs from right to left 
across the bottom of the image.  The current eruption of 
Kliuchevskoi included massive ejections of gas, vapor and 
ash, which reached altitudes of 15,000 meters (50,000 feet).  
Melting snow mixed with volcanic ash triggered mudflows on 
the flanks of the volcano.  Paths of these flows can be seen 
as thin lines in various shades of blue and green on the 
north flank in the center of the image.

<TITLE>SRL-1 - Mammoth, California</TITLE>
<H1>Mammoth, California</H1>
<P>
This image is a false-color composite of the Mammoth Mountain
area in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, California.  The image is
centered at 37.6 degrees north latitude and 119.0 degrees west
longitude. The area is approximately 11.5 kilometers by 78.3
kilometers (7.2 by 48.7 miles) in size.  The image was acquired
by the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C and X-Synthetic Aperture Radar
(SIR-C/X-SAR) aboard space shuttle Endeavour on its 40th orbit,
April 11, 1994.  The city of Mammoth Lakes is visible in the
bottom right portion of the scene.  In this color representation,
red is C-band HV-polarization, green is C-band VV-polarization
and blue is the ratio of C-band VV to C-band HV.  Blue areas are
lakes or slopes facing away from the radar illumination.  Yellow
represents areas of dry, old snow as well as slopes facing
directly the radar illumination.   
<P>
At the time of the SIR-C overflight, the sky conditions were
partially cloudy, with low and cold air temperatures. Total snow
depth is about 1 to 1.5 meters (3 to 5 feet).  The current snow
accumulation is only about 40 percent of the average for the
season.  The most recent snowfall in the area covered the entire
area with about 30 centimeters (14 inches) of fresh dry snow. 
Above 3,000 meters (10,000 feet) elevation the snowpack is dry.
Below that elevation, the snowpack has a layered structure.  
Snow hydrologists are using SIR-C/X-SAR data to determine both
the quantity of water held by seasonal snowpack and the amount of
snow melting.

<TITLE>SRL-2 - Mt. Rainier, Washington</TITLE>
<H1>Mt. Rainier, Washington</H1> 
<P> 
This is a radar image of Mount Rainier in Washington state. The 
volcano last erupted about 150 years ago and numerous large 
floods and debris flows have originated on its slopes during the 
last century. Today the volcano is heavily mantled with glaciers 
and snowfields. More than 100,000 people live on young volcanic 
mudflows less than 10,000 years old and, consequently, are 
within the range of future, devastating mudslides. This image 
was acquired by the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C and X-band 
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) aboard the space shuttle 
Endeavour on its 20th orbit on October 1, 1994.  The area shown 
in the image is approximately 59 kilometers by 60 kilometers 
(36.5 miles by 37 miles).  North is toward the top left of the 
image, which was composed by assigning red and green colors to 
the L-band, horizontally transmitted and vertically, and the L-
band, horizontally transmitted and vertically received. Blue 
indicates the C-band, horizontally transmitted and vertically 
received. In addition to highlighting topographic slopes facing 
the space shuttle, SIR-C records rugged areas as brighter and 
smooth areas as darker.  The scene was illuminated by the 
shuttle's radar from the northwest so that northwest-facing 
slopes are brighter and southeast-facing slopes are dark.  
Forested regions are pale green in color; clear cuts and bare 
ground are bluish or purple; ice is dark green and white. The 
round cone at the center of the image is the 14,435-foot (4,399-
meter) active volcano, Mount Rainier.  On the lower slopes is a 
zone of rock ridges and rubble (purple to reddish) above 
coniferous forests (in yellow/green). The western boundary of 
Mount Rainier National Park is seen as a transition from 
protected, old-growth forest to heavily logged private land, a 
mosaic of recent clear cuts (bright purple/blue) and partially 
regrown timber plantations (pale blue). The prominent river seen 
curving away from the mountain at the top of the image (to the 
northwest) is the White River, and the river leaving the 
mountain at the bottom right of the image (south) is the 
Nisqually River, which flows out of the Nisqually glacier on the 
mountain.  The river leaving to the left of the mountain is the 
Carbon River, leading west and north toward heavily populated 
regions near Tacoma. The dark patch at the top right of the 
image is Bumping Lake. Other dark areas seen to the right of 
ridges throughout the image are radar shadow zones.  Radar 
images can be used to study the volcanic structure and the 
surrounding regions with linear rock boundaries and faults. In 
addition, the recovery of forested lands from natural disasters 
and the success of reforestation programs can also be monitored.  
Ultimately this data may be used to study the advance and 
retreat of glaciers and other forces of global change.

<TITLE>SRL - Mt. Pinatubo comparison</TITLE>
<H1>Mt. Pinatubo comparison</H1> 
<P> 
These are color composite radar images showing the area around Mount 
Pinatubo in the Philippines.  The images were acquired by the Spaceborne 
Imaging Radar-C and X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) aboard 
the space shuttle Endeavour on April 14, 1994 (left image) and  October 
5,1994 (right image). The images are centered at about 15 degrees north 
latitude and 120.5 degrees east longitude. Both images were obtained 
with the same viewing geometry. The color composites were made by 
displaying the L-band (horizontally transmitted and received) in red; 
the L-band (horizontally transmitted and vertically received) in green; 
and the C-band (horizontally transmitted and vertically received) in 
blue.  The area shown is approximately 40 kilometers by 65 kilometers 
(25 miles by 40 miles). The main volcanic crater on Mount Pinatubo 
produced by the June 1991 eruptions and the steep slopes on the upper 
flanks of the volcano are easily seen in these images. Red on the high 
slopes shows the distribution of the ash deposited during the 1991 
eruption, which appears red because of the low cross-polarized radar 
returns at C and L bands. The dark drainages radiating away from the 
summit are the smooth mudflows, which even three years after the 
eruptions continue to flood the river valleys after heavy rain. 
Comparing the two images shows that significant changes have occured in 
the intervening five months along the Pasig-Potrero rivers (the dark 
area in the lower right of the images).  Mudflows, called "lahars," that 
occured during the 1994 monsoon season filled the river valleys, 
allowing the lahars to spread over the surrounding countryside. Three 
weeks before the second image was obtained, devastating lahars more than 
doubled the area affected in the Pasig-Potrero rivers, which is clearly 
visible as the increase in dark area on the lower right of the images. 
Migration of deposition to the east (right) has affected many 
communities. Newly affected areas included the community of Bacolor, 
Pampanga, where thousands of homes were buried in meters of hot mud and 
rock as 80,000 people fled the lahar-stricken area.  Scientists are 
closely monitoring the westward migration ( toward the left in this 
image) of the lahars as the Pasig-Potrero rivers seek to join with the 
Porac River, an area that has not seen laharic activity since the 
eruption.  This could  be devastating because the Pasig-Potrero rivers 
might be permanently redirected to lower elevations along the Porac 
River where communities are located. Ground saturation with water during 
the rainy season reveals inactive channels that were dry in the April 
image. A small lake has turned into a pond in the lower reaches of the 
Potrero River because the channels are full of lahar deposits and the 
surface runoff has no where to flow. Changes in the degree of erosion in 
ash and pumice deposits from the 1991 eruption can also be seen in the 
channels that deliver the mudflow material to the Pasig-Potrero rivers. 
The 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption is well known for its near-global 
effects on the atmosphere and short-term climate due to the large amount 
of sulfur dioxide that was injected into the upper atmosphere. Locally, 
however, the effects will most likely continue to impact surrounding 
areas for as long as the next 10 to 15 years. Mudflows, quite certainly, 
will continue to pose severe hazards to adjacent areas. Radar 
observations like those obtained by SIR-C/X-SAR will play a key role in 
monitoring these changes because of the radar's ability to see in 
daylight or darkness and even in the worst weather conditions.  Radar 
imaging will be particularly useful, for example, during the monsoon 
season, when the lahars form.  Frequent imaging of these lahar fields 
will allow scientists to better predict when they are likely to begin 
flowing again and which communities might be at risk.

<TITLE>SRL-1 - Galeras Volcano</TITLE>
<H1>Galeras Volcano</H1>
<P>
This radar image of the area surrounding the Galeras volcano in 
southern Colombia shows the ability of a multi-frequency radar to 
map volcanic structures that can be dangerous to study on the 
ground.  Galeras has erupted more than 20 times since the area 
was first visited by European explorers in the 1500s.  Volcanic 
activity levels have been high in the last five years, including 
an eruption in January 1993 that killed nine people on a 
scientific expedition to the volcano summit.  Galeras is the 
light green area near the center of the image.  The active cone, 
with a small summit pit, is the red feature nestled against the 
lower right edge of the caldera (crater) wall.  The city of 
Pasto, with a population of 300,000, is shown in orange near the 
bottom of the image, just 8 kilometers (5 miles) from the 
volcano.  The image was acquired by the Spaceborne Imaging 
Radar-C/X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/ X-SAR) aboard the 
space shuttle Endeavour on its 96th orbit on April 15, 1994.  
North is toward the upper right. The area shown is 49.1 by 36.0 
kilometers (30.5 by 22.3 miles), centered at 1.2 degrees north 
latitude and 77.4 degrees west longitude.  The radar illumination 
is from the top of the image.  The false colors in this image 
were created using the following radar channels:  red represents 
the L-band (horizontally transmitted and received); green 
represents the L-band (horizontally transmitted, vertically 
received); blue represents the C-band (horizontally transmitted, 
vertically received).  Galeras is one of 15 volcanoes worldwide

"International Decade Volcano" because of the hazard that it

<TITLE>SRL-1 - Gorilla habitat, Central Africa</TITLE>
<H1>Gorilla habitat, Central Africa</H1>
<P>
This is a false-color radar image of Central Africa, showing 
the Virunga Volcano chain along the borders of Rwanda, Zaire 
and Uganda.  This area is home to the endangered 
mountain gorillas.  This C- and L-band image was acquired on 
April 12, 1994, on orbit 58 of space shuttle Endeavour by 
the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-band Synthetic Aperture 
Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR).  The area is centered at about 1.75 
degrees south latitude and 29.5 degrees east longitude.  The 
image covers an area 58 kilometers by 178 kilometers (48 
miles by 178 miles).   The false-color composite is created 
by displaying the L-band HH return in red, the L-band HV 
return in green and the C-band HH return in blue.  The dark 
area in the bottom of the image is Lake Kivu, which forms 
the border between Zaire (to the left) and Rwanda (to the 
right).  The airport at Goma, Zaire is shown as a dark line 
just above the lake in the bottom left corner of the image.  
Volcanic flows from the 1977 eruption of Mt. Nyiragongo are 
shown just north of the airport.  Mt. Nyiragongo is not 
visible in this image because it is located just to the left 
of the image swath.  Very fluid lava flows from the 1977 
eruption killed 70 people.  Mt. Nyiragongo is currently 
erupting (August 1994) and will be a target of observation 
during the second flight of SIR-C/X-SAR.  The large volcano 
in the center of the image is Mt. Karisimbi (4,500 meters or 
14,800 feet).  This radar image highlights subtle 
differences in the vegetation and volcanic flows of the 
region.  The faint lines shown in the purple regions are 
believed to be the result of agriculture terracing by the 
people who live in the region.  The vegetation types are an 
important factor in the habitat of the endangered mountain 
gorillas.  Researchers at Rutgers University in New Jersey 
and the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund in London will use this 
data to produce vegetation maps of the area to aid in their 
study of the remaining 650 gorillas in the region.

<TITLE>SRL-1 - Mt Pinatubo, Philippines</TITLE>
<H1>Mt Pinatubo, Philippines</H1>
<P>
This is a false color L-band and C-band image of the area around 
Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines, centered at about 15 degrees 
north latitude, 120.5 degrees east longitude.  This image was 
acquired by the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C and X-Band Synthetic 
Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) aboard the space shuttle Endeavour
on orbit 78 on April 13, 1994.  The false-color composite is made
by displaying the L-band HH return in red, the L-band HV return
in green and the C-band HV return in blue.  The area shown is 
approximately 45 by 68 kilometers (28 by 42 miles).  The main
volcanic crater on Mount Pinatubo produced by the June 1991
eruptions, and the steep slopes on the upper flanks of the
volcano, are easily seen in this image.  The red color on the
high slopes show the rougher ash deposited during the 1991
eruption.  The dark drainages are the smooth mudflows which
continue to flood the river valleys after heavy rain.  Radar
images such as this one can be used to identify the areas flooded
by mudflows, which are difficult to distinguish visually, and to
assess the rate at which the erosion and deposition continues.  A
key aspect of the second SIR-C/X-SAR mission in August 1994 will
be to collect a second image of Pinatubo during the summer
monsoon season -- new mudflows will have occurred -- and to
evaluate the short-term changes.  The 1991 eruption of Mount 
Pinatubo in the Philippines is well known for its near-global
effects on the atmosphere and climate due to the large amount of
sulfur dioxide that was injected into the upper atmosphere.  What
is less widely known is that even today the volcano continues to
be a major hazard to the people who have returned to the area
around the volcano.  Dangerous mudflows (called "lahars") are
often generated by heavy rains, and these can still sweep down
river valleys and wash out roads and villages, or bury low lying
areas in several meters of mud and volcanic debris.  These
mudflows will continue to be a severe hazard around Pinatubo for
the next 10 to 15 years.

<TITLE>SRL-2 - Central Africa gorilla habitat</TITLE>
<H1>Central Africa gorilla habitat</H1> 
<P> 
This is a false-color composite of Central Africa, showing 
the Virunga volcano chain along the borders of Rwanda, Zaire 
and Uganda. This area is home to the endangered mountain 
gorillas.  The image was acquired on October 3, 1994, on 
orbit 58 of the space shuttle Endeavour by the Spaceborne 
Imaging Radar-C/X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-
SAR).  In this image red is the L-band (horizontally 
transmitted, vertically received) polarization; green is the 
C-band (horizontally transmitted and received) polarization; 
and blue is the C-band (horizontally transmitted and 
received) polarization. The area is centered at about 2.4 
degrees south latitude and 30.8 degrees east longitude.  The 
image covers an area 56 kilometers by 70 kilometers (35 
miles by 43 miles). The dark area at the top of the image is 
Lake Kivu, which forms the border between Zaire (to the 
right) and Rwanda (to the left). In the center of the image 
is the steep cone of Nyiragongo volcano, rising 3,465 meters 
(11,369 feet) high, with its central crater now occupied by 
a lava lake. To the left are three volcanoes, Mount 
Karisimbi, rising 4,500 meters (14,800 feet) high;  Mount 
Sabinyo, rising 3,600 meters (12,000 feet) high; and Mount 
Muhavura, rising 4,100 meters (13,500 feet) high. To their 
right is Nyamuragira volcano, which is 3,053 meters (10,017 
feet) tall, with radiating lava flows dating from the 1950s 
to the late 1980s. These active volcanoes constitute a 
hazard to the towns of Goma, Zaire and the nearby Rwandan 
refugee camps, located on the shore of Lake Kivu at the top 
left.  This radar image highlights subtle differences in the 
vegetation of the region. The green patch to the center left 
of the image in the foothills of Karisimbi is a bamboo 
forest where the mountain gorillas live. The vegetation 
types in this area are an important factor in the habitat of 
mountain gorillas.  Researchers at Rutgers University in New 
Jersey and the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund in London will use 
this data to produce vegetation maps of the area to aid in 
their studies of the last 650 mountain gorillas in the 
world. The faint lines above the bamboo forest are the 
result of agricultural terracing by the people who live in 
the region.

Here weexamine those differences further.<p><p>	Let's say that you are flying on an airplane between Philadelphia andPittsburgh. You look out the window and see the West Branch River joining upwith the Susquehanna River near Sunbury, Pennsylvania. Some of the diffusescattered light from the Sun reflects off the ground and enters the pupil ofyour eye. Light from the Sun contains all the colors of the rainbow, anddifferent objects on the ground absorb and reflect the different colors oflight. Your eyes  tell your brain what they saw, and your brain figures outthat the rivers look blue and the trees look green. <p><p>	Your camera does the same thing. When you take a picture with your camera, thecamera shutter opens briefly, exposing the film to this reflected light. Thenyou take the film to be processed, and when you get the pictures back, thepicture looks very similar to what your eyes saw. Now let's suppose thatinstead of a camera you have an imaging radar like SIR-C/X-SAR, which usesdifferent wavelengths to observe the Earth. You are the envy of everyone on theairplane (and you have probably exceeded your baggage allowance). <p><p>	As we have seen earlier, because radar operates at radio wavelengths, thepicture you will take is a kind of "FLASH" picture.  The radar will illuminatethe ground with radio waves. The radio waves reflect off the ground, and someof the radio waves will be reflected back to the radar where it will record theresult (like the film in your camera). If you have a single-wavelength imagingradar, you can visualize the radar image as a black and white image, where thewhiter the image the brighter the radio reflection from the ground. But if youhave a multi-wavelength or multi-polarization radar, you can make a colorpicture.<p><p>	Unlike a camera which can take a picture of the entire spectrum of therainbow, imaging radars have discrete wavelengths of radio waves that they cantransmit. If your radar is a three wavelength radar like SIR-C/X-SAR, then itis like a camera that can only capture three colors of the rainbow. But withthree colors, we can still make a color picture, by assigning different colorsto different radio wavelengths. This is significant because the brightness ofthe ground typically changes with wavelength.  This is just like what happensat visible wavelengths.  A tree is bright at the green colors (wavelengths),and not as bright at the other colors, therefore the tree appears green.<p><p><h2>Combining Images from Different Radar Wavelengths</h2><p>	A color image can be constructed by assigning just three colors (red, green,and blue). Therefore, in making a color image from a three wavelength radar, wecould assign one wavelength band to be red, one wavelength band to be green,and the third wavelength band to be blue.  The assignment of these colors iscompletely arbitrary, as radio waves don't have a "COLOR". However, by makingsome kind of assignment, we can visualize the radar image. The brightness ofeach color will depend on the brightness of the radar image for thatwavelength.  <p><p>	For instance, say we are flying on the space shuttle over Sunbury Pennsylvaniaand you turn on the SIR-C imaging radar. Here are three black and white imagescorresponding to the three wavelengths of the SIR-C radar.  They look like this:<p><p>"X-BAND"<p><IMG SRC="MORCOLR1.GIF" alt="[X-BAND]"><p><p>"C-BAND"<p><IMG SRC="MORCOLR2.GIF" alt="[C-BAND]"><p><p>"L-BAND"<p><IMG SRC="MORCOLR3.GIF" alt="[L-BAND]"><p><p>As you can see, there are subtle differences between these images.  Forexample, the "L-BAND" image has more variation in gray than the "X-BAND" and"C-BAND" images. The reason for this is that lots of different types of terrainappear rough on the scale of the X-band and C-band wavelengths (3 cm and 6cm).So, apart from the smooth river, which appears dark at all three wavelengths,most of the variation in the X-band and C-band images is due to changes inslope on the ridges of the Appalachians, which run through this area ofPennsylvania. If the terrain slope towards the radar, the backscatter tends toincrease; if it slopes away from the radar, the backscatter tends to decrease.At L-Band, the agricultural fields in the valleys are smoother than the treeson the forested ridges, so we see some contrast between the tree-covered ridges(which are light gray) and the valleys, which appear darker.<p><p>	Now, if we assign the red color to the "L-BAND" image, the green color to the"C-BAND" image, and the blue color to the "X-BAND" image, we get the followingcolor image when we combine them:<p><p><IMG SRC="MORCOLR4.GIF" alt="[FALSE COLOR COMPOSITE]"><p><p>As can be seen from this color image, there are significant differences in the "BRIGHTNESS" ofthe ground at the different wavelengths. The tree-covered ridges are redderthan the valleys, because we assigned that color to L-band and the trees give astrong backscatter at L-band. Yellow areas are brighter in both the red andgreen images (L-band and C-band). It is somewhat easier to see thesedifferences by looking at the color image than by looking at the black andwhite images of each wavelength separately. This type of image is sometimesreferred to as a 'false color' image, since it does not represent the 'true'colors your eye would see, but an artificial selection of different colorsassigned to different wavelengths.<p><p><h2>Combining Images from Different Polarizations</h2><p><p>	When we transmit the radio waves, we can choose the polarization.  Usually wedecide to transmit the radio waves so that they are vibrating horizontally orvertically with respect to the plane of propagation.  When the radar receivesthe radio waves, we can also choose which polarization it will receive, againusually horizontal (H) or vertical (V).  Depending on the transmit and receivepolarization, the ground reflects the radio waves differently. <p><p>	Let's try combining three images of different polarizations.  Below are threeblack and white images of Sunbury in Pennsylvania.  Each image was illuminatedwith  the same wavelength of radio waves ("L-BAND").  But the polarization ofthe radio waves is different for each image:<p><p>"L-BAND HH"<p><IMG SRC="MORCOLR5.GIF" alt="[L-BAND HH]"><p><p><p>"L-BAND HV"<p><IMG SRC="MORCOLR6.GIF" alt="[L-BAND HV]"><p><p>"L-BAND VV"<p><IMG SRC="MORCOLR7.GIF" alt="[L-BAND VV]"><p><p>As can be seen, the differences are sometimes very subtle between theseimages.  It is difficult to compare them for specific areas.  However, if weform a color image by assigning the blue color to HH, the green color to HV,and the red color to VV, we can see more clearly the differences in the radarbrightness for different transmit and receive polarizations :<p><p><IMG SRC="MORCOLR8.GIF" alt="[FALSE COLOR IMAGE]"><p><p>In this image we see thetree-covered ridges stand out as a green color. That is because the HVpolarization we selected for the green color is the best for observing thescatter off randomly oriented objects such as tree branches and leaves. So notonly does the L-Band wavelength pick out trees from agriculture well, usingL-Band HH polarization is even better. <p><p>	We can also combine images from different polarizations and differentfrequencies. In this way we can examine the same image in different ways, andby using color we can highlight differences in radar brightness due todifferent wavelengths and polarizations of radio waves. For instance, we couldtake an L-band HH polarization image, an L-band HV polarization image, and aC-band VV polarization image, assign them the colors red, green, and bluerespectively, and get the following color image:<p><p>LHH, LHV, and CVV Image<p><IMG SRC="MORCOLR9.GIF" alt="[FALSE COLOR IMAGE]"><p><p>This combination appears to show the contrast between the tree-covered areasand the agriculture in the valleys even better than the previous one. Thiscombination always seems to show up differences in land use well, so it is useda lot in generating color images from SIR-C. <p></font><table border=7 cellpadding=5>   <tr>   <td><A HREF="../../GUIDTOUR.HTM">Guided Tour</A>   </td>   <td>      <a href="../RADCDREF.HTM">Radar Images: An Overview      </a>   </td>   </tr></table><p><font size=1><i>Converted to the IBM-PC by Al Wong, al.wong@jpl.nasa.gov<br><br>Jet Propulsion Laboratory<br>4800 Oak Grove Drive<br>Pasadena, CA 91109<br></i></font></body></html>

<TITLE>SRL-2 - Mauna Loa, Hawaii</TITLE>
<h1>Mauna Loa, Hawaii</H1>
<P>
This image of the Mauna Loa volcano on the Big Island of 
Hawaii shows the capability of imaging radar to map lava 
flows and other volcanic structures.  Mauna Loa has erupted 
more than 35 times since the island was first visited by 
westerners in the early 1800s.  The large summit crater, 
called Mokuaweoweo Caldera, is clearly visible near the 
center of the image.  Leading away from the caldera (towards 
top right and lower center) are the two main rift zones 
shown here in orange.  Rift zones are areas of weakness 
within the upper part of the volcano that are often ripped 
open as new magma (molten rock) approaches the surface at 
the start of an eruption.  The most recent eruption of Mauna 
Loa was in March and April 1984, when segments of the 
northeast rift zones were active.  If the height of the 
volcano was measured from its base on the ocean floor 
instead of from sea level, Mauna Loa would be the tallest 
mountain on Earth.  Its peak (center of the image) rises 
more than 8 kilometers (5 miles) above the ocean floor.  The 
South Kona District, known for cultivation of macadamia nuts 
and coffee, can be seen in the lower left as white and blue 
areas along the coast.  North is toward the upper left.  The 
area shown is 41.5 by 75 kilometers (25.7 by 46.5 miles), 
centered at 19.5 degrees north latitude and 155.6 degrees 
west longitude.  The image was acquired by the Spaceborne 
Imaging Radar-C/X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/
X-SAR) aboard the space shuttle Endeavour on its 36th orbit 
on October 2, 1994.  The radar illumination is from the left 
of the image.  The colors in this image were obtained using 
the following radar channels:  red represents the L-band 
(horizontally transmitted and received); green represents 
the L-band (horizontally transmitted, vertically received); 
blue represents the C-band (horizontally transmitted, 
vertically received).  The resulting color combinations in 
this radar image are caused by differences in surface 
roughness of the lava flows.  Smoother flows, called 
pahoehoe flows, are depicted in red, and rougher flows, 
called a'a flows in volcanology terminology that originated 
in the Hawaiian language, are shown in yellow and white.  
Mauna Loa is one of 15 volcanoes worldwide that are being 
monitored by the scientific community as an "International 
Decade Volcano" because of the hazard that it represents to 
the local towns of Hilo and Kona.  The Kilauea volcano is 
located off to the right of  Mauna Loa and is not visible in 
this image.

<TITLE>SRL-1 - Colombian volcano</TITLE>
<H1>Colombian volcano</H1>
<P>
This is a radar image of a little known volcano in northern 
Colombia.  The image  was acquired on orbit 80 of space 
shuttle Endeavour on April 14, 1994, by the Spaceborne 
Imaging Radar C/X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-
SAR).  The volcano near the center of the image is located 
at 5.6 degrees north latitude, 75.0 degrees west longitude, 
about 100 kilometers (65 miles) southeast of Medellin, 
Colombia. The conspicuous dark spot is a lake at the bottom 
of an approximately 3-kilometer-wide (1.9-mile) volcanic 
collapse depression or caldera. A cone-shaped peak on the 
bottom left (northeast rim) of the caldera appears to have 
been the source for a flow of material into the caldera. 
This is the northern-most known volcano in South America and 
because of its youthful appearance, should be considered 
dormant rather than extinct. The volcano's existence 
confirms a fracture zone proposed in 1985 as the northern 
boundary of volcanism in the Andes.  The SIR-C/X-SAR image 
reveals another, older caldera further south in Colombia, 
along another proposed fracture zone. Although relatively 
conspicuous, these volcanoes have escaped widespread 
recognition because of  frequent cloud cover that hinders 
remote sensing imaging in visible wavelengths.  Four 
separate volcanoes in the Northern Andes nations of Colombia 
and Ecuador have been active during the last 10 years, 
killing more than 25,000 people, including scientists who 
were monitoring the volcanic activity. Detection and 
monitoring of volcanoes from space provides a safe way to 
investigate volcanism. The recognition of previously unknown 
volcanoes is important for hazard evaluations because a 
number of major eruptions this century have occurred at 
mountains that were not previously recognized as volcanoes.

<TITLE>SRL-1 - Mammoth, California 3-D</TITLE>
<H1>Mammoth, California 3-D</H1>
<P>
This is a three-dimensional perspective of Mammoth Mountain,
California.  This view was constructed by overlaying a Spaceborne
Imaging Radar-C (SIR-C) radar image on a U.S. Geological Survey
digital elevation map.  Vertical exaggeration is 1.87 times.  The
image is centered at 37.6 degrees north, 119.0 degrees west.  It
was acquired from the Spaceborne Imaging Radar C/X-Band 
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) onboard space shuttle
Endeavour on its 67th orbit on April 13, 1994.  In this color
representation, red is C-band HV-polarization, green is C-band
VV-polarization and blue is the ratio of C-band VV to C-band HV. 
Blue areas are smooth, and yellow areas are rock outcrops with
varying amounts of snow and vegetation.  Crowley Lake is in the
foreground, and Highway 395 crosses in the middle of the image. 
Mammoth Mountain is shown in the upper right.

<TITLE>SRL-1 - Galapagos Islands</TITLE>
<H1>Galapagos Islands</H1>
<P>
This is an image showing part of Isla Isabela in the
western Galapagos Islands.  It was taken by the L-band radar in
HH polarization from the Spaceborne Imaging Radar C/X-Band 
Synthetic Aperture Radar on the 40th orbit of the space shuttle 
Endeavour.  The image is centered at about 0.5 degree south 
latitude and 91 degrees west longitude and covers an area of 75
by 60 kilometers (47 by 37 miles).  The radar incidence angle at
the center of the image is about 20 degrees.
<P>
The western Galapagos Islands, which lie about 1,200 kilometers
(750 miles) west of Ecuador in the eastern Pacific, have six
active volcanoes similar to the volcanoes found in Hawaii.  Since
the time of Charles Darwin's visit to the area in 1835, there
have been over 60 recorded eruptions on these volcanoes.  This
SIR-C/X-SAR image of Alcedo and Sierra Negra volcanoes shows the 
rougher lava flows as bright features, while ash deposits and 
smooth pahoehoe lava flows appear dark.  A small portion of Isla
Fernandina is visible in the extreme upper left corner  of the
image.
<P>
The Galapagos Islands are one of the SIR-C/X-SAR supersites and
data of this area will be taken several times during the flight
to allow scientists to conduct topographic change studies and to
search for different lava flow types, ash deposits and fault
lines.

Adiscussion of the movie clips follows.<p><h2>Antenna Movie</h2>The first movie clip, <a href="../../../../ROADMAP/MOVIES/QTMOVIES/ANTMO2SP.MOV">AntMo2SP.mov (3,513K Movie),</a>shows a time lapse video ofthe SIR-C antenna under construction in a clean room. The video uses time-lapsephotography to show the building of the SIR-C radar.  Construction is at theJet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. The construction takes placein a "CLEAN ROOM," which is continually having its air filtered and circulated.The engineers constructing the radar change their clothes when they begin towork with the electronic equipment. This equipment is extremely sensitive andeven the smallest dust particles could potentially disrupt their functioning.<p>The video shows the construction of the SIR-C antenna and electronics over aperiod of several months during 1993.  The antenna is the huge, billboard-sizedstructure. The massive support structure of girders on the back of the antennais designed to keep the antenna very flat when in space and also holds theelectronic components to operate the antenna.<p><h2>Shuttle Launch and Land</h2>The second movie clip,<a href="../../../../ROADMAP/MOVIES/QTMOVIES/LAUNLAND.MOV">LaunLand.mov (4,836K Movie),</a>shows the SpaceShuttle Endeavour being launched on one of the SIR-C missions, the SIR-Cantenna in the Shuttle payload bay and then the Endeavour landing at EdwardsAir Force Base in California<p><h2>SIR-C Supersites</h2>The third movie clip, <a href="../../../../ROADMAP/MOVIES/QTMOVIES/SITESHOW.MOV">SiteShow.mov (9,965K Movie),</a>shows the location ofall of the SIR-C supersites on a map of the world. <p><h2>Ground Data Collection</h2>The fourth movie clip,<a href="../../../../ROADMAP/MOVIES/QTMOVIES/MANAUSCR.MOV">ManausCR.mov (2,270K Movie),</a>shows a video taken atone of the supersites during the first SIR-C mission in April 1994. The videowas taken at the Manaus supersite in the Amazon, Brazil. It shows a largetriangular-shaped reflector which was used to help calibrate the SIR-C radardata. A triangular-shaped reflector is used because we know its radar crosssection, so we can compare with the measurement from the data. The reflectorwas placed in a clear-cut area (for raising beef cattle) with uncleared rainforest in the background<p><h2>Radar Sees Through Clouds</h2>The fifth movie clip,<a href="../../../../ROADMAP/MOVIES/QTMOVIES/PRALBERT.MOV">PrAlbert.mov (1,126K Movie),</a>compares theastronauts view from the Space Shuttle with a radar view of the Prince Albertsupersite in Canada. <p><h2>Mapping Snow Wetness</h2>The sixth movie clip,<a href="../../../../ROADMAP/MOVIES/QTMOVIES/MAMMOWET.MOV">MammoWet.mov (2,922K Movie),</a>shows a map of snowwetness produced from SIR-C data obtained over Mammoth Mountain in California.Maps like this can be used to predict run-off in the Spring thaw. This isimportant in Southern California (and many other places world-wide) since muchof their water comes from run-off in the Sierra Nevada.<p><h2>A New View of Death Valley</h2>The seventh movie clip,<a href="../../../../ROADMAP/MOVIES/QTMOVIES/DVMOVISP.MOV">DVMoviSP.mov (1,088K Movie),</a>shows a flight around DeathValley in California generated from radar data overlaid on a map of surfaceheights.<p><h2>Getting Close to a Chain of Volcanoes</h2>The eighth movie clip,<a href="../../../../ROADMAP/MOVIES/QTMOVIES/GALAPMSP.MOV">GalapMSP.mov (5,981K Movie),</a>shows a flight around theGalapagos volcanic island chain in the Pacific generated from radar dataoverlaid on a map of surface heights. The surface heights were also obtainedfrom radar data, using the technique of radar interferometry.<p><h2>Radar and the Gorillas</h2>The ninth movie clip,<a href="../../../../ROADMAP/MOVIES/QTMOVIES/GORILLA.MOV">Gorilla.mov (4,694K Movie),</a>shows SIR-C data beingused to help scientists map the remaining habitat of the mountain gorillas inRwanda, Africa. These gorillas live in an area which is very difficult anddangerous to access, and which is almost always covered in cloud. Hence thename given to these gorillas in the Hollywood motion picture based on scientistDiane Fossey's life story: 'The Gorillas in the Mist' .<p><p><table border=7 cellpadding=5>   <tr>   <td>      <a href="../CONTENTS.HTM">Slides - Table of Contents      </a>   </td>   </tr></table><p><font size=1><i>Converted to the IBM-PC by Al Wong, al.wong@jpl.nasa.gov<br><br>Jet Propulsion Laboratory<br>4800 Oak Grove Drive<br>Pasadena, CA 91109<br></i></font></body></html>

The orbit drifted slightly from day to dayallowing the same area to be imaged from different angles.  This, along withlimitations on imaging angle, also meant that some sites moved into or out ofview of the radar.  The collected data takes for the second mission weresimilar for two reasons:  (1)  the shuttle flew in the same orbit during boththe April and October 1994 missions and therefore the same areas of the worldwere visible to the radar during both flights and (2) many of the SIR-C/X-SARexperiments were aimed at collecting data at the same site in two differentseasons and therefore some of the same data takes were collected on bothflights.  On the eighth, ninth, and tenth days of the second mission, theshuttle went into an exact repeat circular orbit for a special radar experimentcalled interferometry.  For more on interferometry, see Section F in Module2.<p><p>Because of the amount of power that the radar uses, it could not be operatedcontinuously during the missions and therefore the data takes are shown asdiscontinuous lines.  Most data takes are aimed at one site, which is imaged bya few seconds of data.  However, the radar was left on for many minutes duringeach data take to collect data over as many sites as possible.  These otherdata will eventually be used for other studies.  The missions were planned tofill up as many data tapes as possible before the shuttle returned to Earth.<p><p><IMG SRC="DATATAK2.GIF"><p><p><p><table border=7 cellpadding=5>   <tr>   <td>      <a href="../CONTENTS.HTM">Slides - Table of Contents      </a>   </td>   </tr></table><p><font size=1><i>Converted to the IBM-PC by Al Wong, al.wong@jpl.nasa.gov<br><br>Jet Propulsion Laboratory<br>4800 Oak Grove Drive<br>Pasadena, CA 91109<br></i></font></body></html>

<h1>SIR-C/X-SAR Supersite Locations</h1>
</center>

The map below shows the locations of the 19 Supersites designated as the high
priority sites for the SIR-C/X-SAR missions.  These sites were areas where
intensive <i>ground truth</i> work was conducted
before, during, and after the missions.
Calibration devices were also deployed at many of the Supersites.
These devices were used after the missions to calibrate the SIR-C and X-SAR
datasets.<p>

<center>
<IMG SRC="SITELOCS.GIF">
</center>
<p>

In addition to these Supersites, data was collected at over 300 other target
sites around the world.  And since the data passes often covered more 
than just
the target site, data was actually collected at many more than just the
designated sites.  For a complete list of the target sites, 
see the file 
<a href="SUPERSIT.HTM">SuperSit.htm</a>.
<p>

All of the data collected during the two SIR-C missions has been processed into
low resolution products for just one of the radar frequency/polarizations
available (usually L-Band HH). These low resolution images can be seen using a
clickable map of the world which shows where the SIR-C data was collected. This
is available on the World Wide Web through the NASA/JPL Imaging Radar Home Page

<h1>Module 2 - How Radar Imaging Works</h1>
</center>

<h2>A) Basic Electromagnetics</h2>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<ol type=1>
<li>Students will identify three features of an  electromagnetic wave.
<li>Students will understand the analogy between radar systems 
    and human vision.
<li>Students will identify the source, scatterer, and observer in various
    sensing systems.
<li>Students will learn what an image swath is.
</ol>
<p>

In this section, some basic concepts of electromagnetics are reviewed. The
purpose is to introduce the student to some ideas about light waves which can
help him or her understand how a radar works. Understanding how simple things
like how light is generated, or how a flashlight or a flash camera works can
help in understanding how a radar image is constructed.<p>

This is <i>not</i>  meant to be a complete introduction to the theory of light
and how it works.<p>

<h2>Electromagnetic Waves</h2>

Since photons travel at the speed of light (c), the distance a photon
travels (x) equals speed (c) x time (t), or x = ct. The voltage of an
electromagnetic wave is described by the following equation:<p>
		
<IMG SRC="MOD2SEA2.GIF"><p>

The wavelength and frequency are related by f = <IMG SRC="MOD2SEA3.GIF">/c.
<p>

<h2>Wave Diagram</h2>

<IMG SRC="MOD2SEA4.GIF"><p>

<ul>
V = voltage of electromagnetic wave<br>
x = distance<br>
A = amplitude of electromagnetic wave<br>
<img src="LAMBDA.GIF"> = wavelength<br>
</ul>

The best way to understand the electromagnetic spectrum is to understand the
composition of its most primary component: the electromagnetic wave. All the
different kinds of electromagnetic energy -- radio waves, television waves,
radar waves, light waves, infrared waves, ultraviolet waves, x-rays,
gamma-rays, etc. -- are made of the same type of basic wave.  This wave has
three features:  the photon, the wavelength and frequency of the wave in which
the photon travels, and the amplitude of the wave in which the photon travels.
<p>

The <b>photon</b> itself is simply a particle of energy traveling at the speed
of light. A substance will emit photons when its energy level increases. This
can happen through several means: chemical reaction (e.g. fire); nuclear
reaction (e.g. solar radiation); an increase in temperature (e.g. hot metal);
or the presence of an electric current (e.g. a light bulb or toaster element).
Photons are found in each type of radiation.  <p>

The characteristics that differentiate one kind of electromagnetic energy from
another are the <b>frequency </b>and<b> wavelength</b> of the wave in which the
photon travels. The frequency of a wave is the number of times the crest of a
given wave passes a point in one second.  Frequency is measured in hertz. One
hertz means a frequency of one wave per second. <p>
Standard radio waves have a frequency of between 100,000 and 1,000,000 hertz.
In comparison, visible light waves have frequencies between 100,000,000,000,000
and 1,000,000,000,000,000 hertz.  <p>

The higher the frequency of a wave, the shorter its wavelength.  Wavelength is
the distance between the crests or troughs of two consecutive waves. Radio
waves can have wavelengths of anywhere from 3 millimeters to 30 kilometers.
Light waves on the other hand have wavelengths of between 0.4 and 0.7 microns
(10<sup>-6</sup> meter). The frequency and wavelength are inversely related.
Therefore, radio waves have a lower frequency (fewer radio waves pass a given
point in one second) than light waves, while at the same time having a much
larger distance between the crests of each wave. It makes sense that if a wave
has a greater wavelength, and all waves travel at the same speed, fewer waves
will pass a given point in one second.<p>

Not only can you identify a certain kind of energy by its frequency and
wavelength, but these characteristics also effect a wave's tendencies.  Waves
with long wavelengths are not easily absorbed. Radio waves are classic examples
of waves with long wavelength. On the other hand small wavelength waves are
absorbed quite readily. Because they can pass through matter so easily, short
wavelength waves are considered more dangerous to humans. X-rays, gamma-rays,
and ultraviolet waves can all cause cancer if you are overexposed to them. This
is because they are able to penetrate the cells in your body and can cause
damage to their structures.               <p>

Finally, the <b>amplitude</b> of a wave determines its strength. The best
analogy for this is an ocean wave. The larger the wave, the more energy it has.
A change in amplitude has no effect on the frequency or wavelength.  Changes in
amplitude account for a weak or strong radio signal or for bright and dim
lights of the same color.            <p>

<h2>The Electromagnetic Spectrum</h2>
 
<IMG SRC="MOD2SEA5.GIF"><p>

<ul>
1 nm = 1 nanometer or 0.0000000001 meters<br>
1 <IMG SRC="MOD2SEA6.GIF">m = 1 micrometer or 0.0000001 meters<br>
1 cm = 1 centimeter or 0.01 meters<br>
1 Hz = 1 Hertz or one cycle per second<br>
1 GHz = 1 GHz or 1,000,000,000 cycles per second<br>
</ul>

<h2>Polarization</h2>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<ol type=1>
<li>Students will be introduced to the idea of polarization of 
    electromagnetic waves.
<li>Students will understand the idea of polarization screening.
</ol>
<p>

So far, we have learnt that electromagnetic waves can travel in a given
direction, and that they have a given amplitude and wavelength. Another
important property of electromagnetic waves is their <b>polarization</b>.
Polarization is the term used to describe the way in which the electromagnetic
wave oscillates as it travels along. For example, a vertically polarized wave
will oscillate up and down as it moves forward; a horizontally polarized wave
will oscillate from side to side. These two polarizations are illustrated
below:<p>
 
<IMG SRC="MOD2SEA7.GIF"> <p>

Other types of polarization are possible, for example circular
polarization in which the wave oscillates in a circle as it moves along (like a
slinky or a spring). In general, polarization is described by an ellipse. We
shall mostly concern ourselves with horizontal and vertical polarizations
here.<p>

It is possible to screen different polarizations, using a screen of
very thin lines arranged either vertically or horizontally. A screen of closely
spaced vertical lines will allow a vertically polarized wave to pass through,
but horizontally polarized waves will bounce off it. This is the principle
which is used in polarized sunglasses to reduce the amount of light entering
the human eye. Polarization screening is illustrated below:<p>
 
<IMG SRC="MOD2SEA8.GIF"> <p>

To demonstrate the idea of polarization screening in the classroom, get
an old pair of polarized sunglasses and take the lenses out. Look through the
lenses one by one to see how they reduce the amount of light passing through,
then put the lenses on top of each other and look through both together. Rotate
one lens by 90 degrees and the light passing through the two screens should be
zero (i.e. you should see nothing). This is because both horizontal and
vertical components of the light have been screened out.<p>

<h2>Human Vision</h2>

<IMG SRC="MOD2SEA9.GIF">
<p>

<ol type=1>
<li><b>Source</b> (Sun) emits light at a given frequency as a 
continuous stream of photons
<li><b>Scatterer</b> (earth) reflects light in all directions
<li><b>Observer</b> (eye) receives light from scatterer
</ol>
<p>
Radar is similar to human sight. Both kinds of sensing make use of
electromagnetic waves and their properties. Human vision uses the segment of
the electromagnetic spectrum known as visible light. Visible light is comprised
of the electromagnetic energy that is perceived by us as colors. These waves
have a wavelength of 0.4 to 0.7 microns and a frequency of between
10<sup>14</sup> hertz and 10<sup>15</sup> hertz. Radar is simply another type
of electromagnetic energy. The only difference is that radar waves have much
larger wavelengths and a much lower frequency. Despite this difference, radio
and light waves behave much the same way.  <p>

As shown in the diagram, human vision is dependent on a <b>Source</b> of
energy, a <b>Scatterer</b>, and an <b>Observer</b>.  In the diagram, the sun
acts as the source and emits light waves. These light waves, and all other
electromagnetic waves, are made of photons. These photons travel until they hit
matter. Depending on the density and composition of the substance, the photons
will do one of three things. The first possibility is that some or all of the
photon's energy can be absorbed by the substance it impacts.  Black substances
appear black because they absorb all the energy of the visible light spectrum.
Since all the energy is being absorbed, no light energy is reflected off the
given substance and it appears void of color, or black. This also explains why
black tar, black clothing, or any black substance gets especially warm when
left in the sun. The electromagnetic energy is being absorbed and converted to
heat energy.  <p>

Another possibility is for the energy to pass through the substance and be
refracted. This is what happens when you look through a magnifying glass or
when you look at a friend through a glass of water and his or her image is
distorted. The photons are being bent or redirected as they pass through the
atoms and molecules of the given substance. This bending of the wave causes a
distortion of the image.  <p>

A final possibility is that the photons can be reflected. Most things we see,
we see because of reflection. For example, we see leaves as green because they
contain a chemical (chlorophyll) which reflects green light and 
absorbs other colors in the visible light spectrum. <p>

The sun emits energy in the form of photons. Some of these photons travel at a
wavelength and frequency known as the visible light spectrum.  Traditionally,
these are referred to as light waves. This is the only segment of the
electromagnetic spectrum that humans can see with the naked eye.  These photons
then travel to Earth and are absorbed, refracted or reflected. Any object that
reflects photons is known as a scatterer.  In the diagram, the ground is the
scatterer. The photons which are reflected by the scatterer impact our eyes and
are converted to electrical impulses.  These electrical impulses are then sent
to our brain and interpreted as vision. The mechanism which receives or
collects the energy from the scatterer is known as the observer. In the vision
diagram, the human eye is the observer. <p>

The process of vision requires three primary components:<p>

<ol type=1>
<li>a Source that emits energy,
<li>a Scatterer that reflects some of that energy
<li>and an Observer which receives and collects the energy of the photons
    after they impact the scatterer.
</ol>
<p>

These same basic components are needed for a radar system.<p>
<h2>Focusing Light</h2>

The sun radiates or emits light equally in all directions. It is an example of
an <b>isotropic radiator</b>.<p>

<IMG SRC="MOD2SA10.GIF"><p>

With a flashlight, light generated by the bulb reflects off the silvered
concave part and is focused towards the object to be illuminated. This is an
example of a <b>non-isotropic radiator.</b><p>

<IMG SRC="MOD2SA11.GIF"><p>

The area illuminated by the flashlight is called its <b>footprint.</b><p>

<IMG SRC="MOD2SA12.GIF"><p>

Once again, how radar works can be understood by examining light--in this
case, a flashlight. Substances that emit light often do so through isotropic
radiation. However, it is often valuable and necessary to focus all this energy
in one direction. This is what occurs in a flashlight. By focusing this energy,
more energy can be shed in specific areas. In the case of a flashlight, the
focused light energy can illuminate a given area more powerfully. The area that
receives the focused energy is known as the <b>footprint</b>. <p>
<p>
	Radars focus radar energy in much the same way. By focusing isotropic radar
energy, more powerful pulses of photons can be beamed at the target area. The
focused energy covers a footprint much like that of a flashlight being shown
across a wall. The radar then collects the reflected energy and interprets the
data. This data are used to create radar images.  The path of the radar
footprint is known as a <b>swath</b>. Radars record reflected radar waves from
the swath area and then piece together the information to create an image of
that area.   <p>

<html><head><!-- This document was created from RTF source by rtftohtml version2.7.3 --><title>Teacher's Guide, Module 2, Section E, How Radar Imaging Works</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" text="#000000" link="#FF0000" vlink="#888800"      alink="#00FF00"><center><IMG SRC="../../LOGO.GIF" alt="[SIR-CED LOGO]"><h1>Module 2 - How Radar Imaging Works</h1></center><h2>E) Scattering Mechanisms</h2><h2>Objectives</h2><ol type=1><li>Students will be able to draw and label a diagram showing an example ofwhat happens to a transmitted pulse when it hits four types of surface.<li>Students will be able to predict what the brightness will be, (high,medium or low) for each type of surface.  <li>Students will be able to list several examples of each type of scatteringmechanism.</ol><p>Radar is reflected in the same manner as visible light. We refer to thisreflection as scattering. The radar pulses sent out by an imaging radar arescattered upon contact with the earth's surface. The way in which the energycontained in the pulse is scattered is known as a scattering mechanism. Animaging radar of the type we are discussing can only measure the energyscattered back towards it, i.e. the <i>backscatter</i>. <p>In this section, four different types of common scattering mechanism areintroduced, including scattering from four types of surface:<p><ol><li>Smooth surface <li>Rough surface<li>Double-bounce<li>Vegetation Layer</ol><p><h2>Smooth Surface</h2>The first type of scatter we shall consider is from a smooth surface. As canbe seen in the diagram below, most of the scatter from a smooth surface is inthe forward direction, away from the radar. Only a very small fraction of theenergy in the transmitted pulse is reflected back towards the radar.<p> <IMG SRC="MOD2SE2.GIF" alt="[SMOOTH SURFACE BOUNCE]"><p>Thus, backscatter from a smooth surface will tend to be very low (say less than-20dB) and will appear dark in the radar image. The exceptions to this are whenthe radar is pointing straight down, so that the smooth surface is at rightangles to the radar look direction; or when the surface is tilted towards theradar. In these cases, almost all the energy in the pulse will be reflectedback towards the radar, and the backscatter will be very high (white in theradar image). The types of surface that would demonstrate smooth surfacescattering are smooth water, dry lake beds, some types of smooth rock and baresoil. The effect of scattering off a smooth surface is like a pool ball hittingthe side of a pool table. The ball is "REFLECTED" at the same angle it hit theside, but in the opposite direction.<p>To demonstrate the same effect using visible light, use a flashlight and aflat piece of aluminum foil. Have the students stand above the aluminum foiland aim the flashlight at the foil. They will notice that most of the light isreflected in one direction, away from them.<p><h2>Rough Surface</h2>The second type of scatter we shall consider is from a rough surface. As seenin the diagram below, the scatter from a rough surface is in all directions.Some fraction of the energy in the transmitted pulse is reflected back towardsthe radar. In general, the rougher the surface is, the higher the backscatter.This can be understood if we consider that the rougher a surface is, the morelikely it is that some segments (or facets) of it will be inclined at rightangles to the radar look direction. Backscatter from a rough surface will tendto be greater than -20dB and will appear gray to white in the radar image. Thetypes of surface that would demonstrate rough surface scattering are waterblown by the wind or with waves, lava and other types of rock and bare soilwith clumps.<p><IMG SRC="MOD2SE3.GIF"><p>Surfaces may be rough at different scale lengths. Comparing the scale lengthwith the radar wavelength we can get an idea whether the surface will appearrough to the radar and thus whether it will give high or low backscatter. Forexample, if we look at a plowed field, we may find that the plowed furrows areabout 6cm high. This is one measure of the scale of the roughness for thatfield. With a roughness scale of 6cm, the field will appear rough (i.e. brightin the radar image) at C-band (6cm wavelength) and X-band (3cm wavelength), butnot at L-band (24cm wavelength).<p>To demonstrate the effect of scattering from a rough surface using visiblelight, use a flashlight and a crinkled piece of aluminum foil. <p><h2>Double-bounce</h2>The third type of scatter is from two surfaces, one flat on the ground(horizontal), the other upright (vertical). The reflected pulse hits bothsurfaces one after the other. This type of scattering is known asdouble-bounce. From the diagram below, most of the scatter for a double-bouncemechanism is back towards the radar, i.e. in the backscatter direction.Double-bounce backscatter will tend to be fairly high (HH, VV greater than-10dB) and will appear light gray to white in the radar image. Double-bouncescattering occurs commonly in urban areas, where there are plenty of verticalsurfaces (the sides of buildings) and horizontal surfaces (sidewalks, streets).It can also occur frequently in nature, whenever there are upright vegetationstems (stalks, trunks) and a relatively smooth (and flat) surface underneath.Examples are flooded forests, forests where the vegetation lying on the groundhas been removed, rice fields, corn fields, marshes and swamps.<p><IMG SRC="MOD2SE4.GIF"><p>To demonstrate the effect of double-bounce scattering using visible light, usea flashlight and two flat pieces of aluminum foil, one on a table top, theother held vertically next to it. <p><h2>Vegetation Layer</h2>The fourth type of scatter is from a layer of randomly oriented scatterers,which is common in many types of vegetation. This type of scattering is morecomplicated than the other three. The radar pulse penetrates the vegetationlayer, then is scattered after hitting one of the randomly oriented branches orleaves in the canopy. From the diagram below,  the scatter for a vegetationlayer is in all directions, with some in the backscatter direction. Backscatterfrom a vegetation layer will vary. Some vegetation layers will be fairly low inbackscatter (HH, VV less than -10dB) and will appear dark gray in the radarimage. Other vegetation layers will have fairly high backscatter (HH, VV a fewdB above -10dB) and will appear light gray in the radar image. Most naturallyoccurring vegetation, such as forests, shrubs, and grassland have scatteringpatterns which are characteristic of vegetation layers, but vary depending onthe wavelength. Forests tend to have fairly high backscatter at all radarwavelengths, because forests are made up of objects of all different sizes(from leaves to trunks). Shrubs are smaller than forests and tend to havefairly high backscatter at short and medium wavelengths (i.e. less than say30cm). Short grass tends to have low backscatter at all wavelengths. Long grassmay have high backscatter at shorter wavelengths (say, less than 10cm) but lowbackscatter at longer wavelengths. Scattering from a vegetation layer anddouble-bounce backscatter can often be seen together, for example in a radarimage of a forest. We will see later how these two phenomena can bedistinguished.<p><IMG SRC="MOD2SE5.GIF"><p><h2>Radar Backscatter Characteristics Of Scattering Mechanisms</h2>The following is a summary of approximate characteristics ofbackscatter for the four different surface types:<p><h2>Smooth Surface</h2><blockquote>Overall backscatter very low (HH, VV &lt; -20dB), except when lookingstraight down</blockquote><p><h2>Rough Surface</h2><blockquote>Overall backscatter low to high (HH, VV &gt; -20dB)<br>VV &gt; HH<br>HV &lt; -20dB<br>Phase Difference within 30 degrees of zero<br>Correlation coefficient &gt; 0.7<br></blockquote><h2>Double-bounce</h2><blockquote>Overall backscatter high (HH, VV &gt; -10dB)<p>Phase Difference within 80<sup>o</sup> of <u>+</u>180<sup>o</sup><p></blockquote><h2>Vegetation Layer</h2><blockquote>HH and VV within 1dB of each other<p>HV &gt; HH - 7dB or HV &gt; VV - 7dB<p>Correlation coefficient between 0 and 0.5</blockquote><p>These radar backscatter characteristics can be compared with the mean values inthe "STATISTICS" results generated by Sigma0. The above "RULES-OF-THUMB"should separate most different types of scatterers, but <i>will</i> be wrong insome cases (there is always an exception to every rule).<p><h2>Hint for the Classroom:</h2>Use this sheet to compare against Statistics obtained using<b>Sigma0</b>.<p><h2>Mapping Vegetation Type</h2>Given the characteristics of the scattering mechanisms described above, it ispossible to estimate the dominant (strongest) type of scatter for each pixel ina radar image data set where all the polarizations are available. We might forexample, classify a pixel as being one of three types:<p><ol><li>Surface Scatter<li>Double-bounce<li>Vegetation Layer</ol>Suppose that we have three wavelengths of radar data available to us. We canclassify data from each wavelength separately into one of the above three typesof backscatter. We may get a different answer for each wavelength. It is thenpossible to use these different answers to classify the image into differentvegetation or ground cover types.<p>The NASA/JPL AIRSAR system is an imaging radar which produces radar image dataat three wavelengths: C-band (6cm wavelength); L-band (24cm wavelength); andP-band (68cm wavelength). At each wavelength, images for all polarizations aregenerated. Three frequency AIRSAR data can be found on the <b>SIR-CEDCD-ROM</b> in the <b>Pre-SIRC</b> folders as files of type <b>Filename.stk</b>.This data can be classified as to the dominant scattering mechanism asdescribed above. <p>Also on the <b>SIR-CED CD-ROM</b> can be found vegetation maps, generated fromNASA/JPL AIRSAR data, using an algorithm developed by A. Freeman of JPL. Thevegetation maps are stored on the <b>CD-ROM</b> as image files named<b>Vegmpbyt.gif</b> in <b>Pre-SIRC</b> folders. Each pixel in a <b>Vegmpbyt.gif</b>file is classified as corresponding to an urban area (e.g. a city ortown); a forest; medium vegetation, such as shrubs or a mature corn field; lowvegetation, such as grassland, scrub or low-lying agricultural crops (e.g.wheat or barley); no vegetation (rocks, bare soil and water surfaces). Withinthe three vegetated classes (forest, low and medium vegetation), there is afurther subdivision into, for example, forest which has a significant amount ofdouble-bounce [Forest (D)] and forest which doesn't [Forest]. Theclassification is based on a model of the scattering mechanisms expected fromthese different ground cover types at all three AIRSAR frequencies and wasfirst made to work on AIRSAR data from a few typical scenes. Some pixels areunclassified and are designated as bright, medium or dark. These pixels do notmatch the models. <p><h2>Classification Rules for Vegetation Maps</h2>The vegetation maps found in the <b>Vegmpbyt.gif</b> files were generatedfollowing rules broadly along the lines of those described below:<p><ol><li><b>No Vegetation</b> - surface scatter dominant at all three frequencies<li><b>Low Vegetation</b> - vegetation layer scatter dominant at C-band, but not at L-and P-band. <li><b>Low Vegetation (D)</b> - classified as low vegetation, but with asignificant amount of double-bounce (implied by large HH-VV phase difference)at C-band.<li><b>Medium Vegetation</b> - vegetation layer scatter dominant at L-band, but notat  P-band. <li><b>Medium Vegetation (D)</b> - classified as medium vegetation, but with asignificant amount of double-bounce (implied by large HH-VV phase difference)at L-band.<li><b>Forest</b>  - vegetation layer scatter dominant at L-band and P-band.<li><b>Forest (D)</b> - classified as forest, but with a significant amount ofdouble-bounce (implied by large HH-VV phase difference) at P-band.<li><b>Urban</b> - Double-bounce scatter dominant at all three wavelengths.</ol>Some pixels do not match any of the scattering mechanism models or the rulesdescribed above. These are <i>unclassified</i> pixels. To differentiate betweenthese unclassified pixels, three levels are given:<p><ol><li><b>Bright </b>- Unclassified pixels which have high backscatter at L-band andP-band.<li><b>Medium</b>- Unclassified pixels which have high backscatter at L-band butnot at P-band.<li><b>Dark</b>- Unclassified pixels which have do not have high backscatter atL-band and P-band.</ol><b>WARNING</b> - the vegetation maps in the <b>Vegmpbyt.gif</b> files are ourbest estimate of the ground cover class based on current models andunderstanding of radar backscatter. <i>They may be wrong in some cases.</i><p><table border=7 cellpadding=5>   <tr>   <td>      <a href="../CONTENTS.HTM">Teacher's Guide - Table of Contents      </a>   </td>   </tr></table><p><font size=1><i>Converted to the IBM-PC by Al Wong, al.wong@jpl.nasa.gov<br><br>Jet Propulsion Laboratory<br>4800 Oak Grove Drive<br>Pasadena, CA 91109<br></i></font></body></html>

These payloads formed the Spaceborne Radar Laboratory (SRL); thetwo flights in 1994 were designated SRL-1 and SRL-2 and a third flight (SRL-3)may take place in 1996.<p>After the space shuttle launch and insertion into a stable earth orbit, thepayload bay doors were opened and the antenna deployed to start collectingdata.  The orbit for the first mission was at an altitude of 215 km above theearth's surface, and at an inclination of 57deg. allowing data to be collectedbetween + 57deg. and -57deg. latitude.  The orbit drifted slightly from day today, so the same site could be imaged at different incidence angles during themission.  The second flight repeated observations of many sites from the firstflight to study any changes that may have occurred between flights.  Inaddition, for a portion of the second mission, a series of shuttle maneuverswere used to keep the shuttle in a exact repeat orbit.  This allowed the samesite to be imaged at the same angle during the mission; scientists will usethese data to study daily changes at each site and for radar interferometry.<p>  <h2>Astronaut Crew</h2> 	Six astronauts flew on each of the first two SIR-C/X-SAR missions.  Althoughthe astronauts did not actually operate the radar antenna, which is commandedfrom the ground, they made important observations of the sites (includingHand-held photographs) and were also be responsible for changing tapes for datarecording.  The crew for each mission divided into two shifts of three peopleeach, permitting 24-hour observations for the mission.  Both crews participatedin pre-mission training to familiarize them with the purpose of the SIR-C/X-SARmission and the sites that were to be imaged.  The crews of both missions wereable to achieve unprecedented stability of the Endeavour by very fineadjustment of the shuttle's thrusters. This was a big plus for the radarobservations and meant that it was much easier to compare results from orbit toorbit and between missions than was previously thought. <p><h2>STS-59/SRL-1 Astronaut Crew</h2> <b>USAF <u>Colonel Sidney M.

Steve worked forIBM on their semiconductor, voice and telephony products before joining theastronaut corps.<p><h2>Mission Timeline</h2> 	Before each mission, planners from both the SIR-C and X-SAR projects prepareda detailed plan known as the pre-mission timeline.  The pre-mission timelinewas a list of sites to be imaged during the mission and the times during whichdata were to be collected over each site.  This timeline was based on apre-mission orbit model which placed the shuttle (and its payload passengers)at a certain position orbiting the earth.  The exact orbital path could not beknown until the actual shuttle launch and orbit insertion, after whichadjustments were made to the pre-mission plan.<p>	In order to make the pre-mission plan, the SIR-C/X-SAR Science Team gave alist of their site locations to the mission planners.  In many cases, thesewere sites where scientists have been working for many years to characterize anarea. Using a computer program, planners compared the site list with themodeled orbital path to determine which sites could be imaged during themission and to calculate the angle at which the radar beam needed to be aimedto hit each site.  Since each mission lasted just 11 days, the timeline wasdesigned to maximize the amount of radar data that was collected.  <p>	Since SIR-C/X-SAR is an international mission involving scientists and sitesfrom all over the world, a great many compromises had to be made in order tooptimize the mission timeline.  Choices had to be made between sites that aregeographically close together.  For example, the Chesapeake Bay and theAppalachian mountains could not be imaged at the same time although the shuttlepassed over both at the same time.  Since the shuttle is a complicated mannedspacecraft, planners also had to consider the amount of power that the timelinerequires, and shuttle maintenance activities and maneuvers.<p>	As changes in the position of the orbit or problems with the equipmentoccurred during the mission, the timeline was changed to ensure that good datawere collected over as many sites as possible.  During the second mission, forexample, the timeline was adjusted to ensure that radar data was collected overa volcano that erupted while the shuttle was in orbit on the Kamchatkapeninsula in Eastern Russia, Mt. Kliuchevskoi.<p><IMG SRC="MOD3SED2.GIF">   Plot showing datatakes collected on the April 1994 SIR-C/X-SARmission.<p><h2>Mission Control</h2> 	NASA's space shuttle operations are controlled by Johnson Space Center inHouston, Texas. The SIR-C/X-SAR radar antenna was commanded from a PayloadOperations Control Center (POCC) also located at Johnson Space Center.  TheSIR-C/X-SAR POCC was actually operated by SIR-C and X-SAR personnel during eachmission.<p>	POCC personnel were responsible for operating the radar antenna and ensuringthat radar data were recorded onboard the shuttle.  This was done by sendingcommands from the POCC to the radar antenna hardware.  The commands were sentthrough the TDRSS (Tracking Data Relay Satellite System) satellites which are aseries of communication satellites used by NASA and the US Government. Eachcommand contained information that should tell the antenna when to turn on andin which operational mode data are to be collected. The SIR-C/X-SAR equipmentonboard the shuttle has the ability to store 128 commands in case thecommunication between the POCC and the shuttle is lost for a period of time.<p>	To help determine if the radar antenna was operating properly, some datacollected were transmitted to the POCC for analysis during the missions.  Thistransmission occurred over the same TDRSS link that was used to command theradar antenna. (See the section on real time processing below.)<p>	In addition to ensuring that data were collected and are of good quality, POCCpersonnel also discussed site observations with the astronaut crew.  The crewidentified particular sites that should be added to the mission timeline, suchas the Mt. Kliuchevskoi eruption. Crew communication was also useful fortrouble-shooting minor problems with the antenna and the tape recorders onboard the Shuttle.<p>	Aside from the radar antenna responsibilities, the SIR-C/X-SAR POCC teamworked closely with shuttle flight design people at JSC.  JSC had to approveany proposed change to the orbital path of the shuttle.<p><h2>Real Time Data Processing</h2> 	All of the radar data collected during the SIR-C/X-SAR missions was recordedon-board the shuttle on digital tape recorders. These tape recorders looksimilar to the ones in your VCR at home, but are capable of recording much moredata. The tapes were taken off the shuttle following it's return to Earth andthe data sent to JPL and Germany and Italy for processing.  In addition, duringthe mission some data were transmitted ("DOWNLINKED") to the POCC forprocessing and analysis.  These data were used to make sure the radar wasworking as expected, and also to produce images for press releases.<p><table border=7 cellpadding=5>   <tr>   <td>      <a href="../CONTENTS.HTM">Teacher's Guide - Table of Contents      </a>   </td>   </tr></table><p><font size=1><i>Converted to the IBM-PC by Al Wong, al.wong@jpl.nasa.gov<br><br>Jet Propulsion Laboratory<br>4800 Oak Grove Drive<br>Pasadena, CA 91109<br></i></font></body></html>

Students will learn how to open imagesand do basic image analysis.<li>Students will use the Galileo earth image to identify threemajor characteristics of the earth. <li>Students will be introduced to optical technology as used in remotesensing. </ol><p>Image data for Module 1 contained in the /MODS1TO5/MODULE01/IMAGES directory should be copied over to your computerbefore beginning this module. The files you will needare in this directory are<b>GalOptic.gif</b> and <b>GalInfra.gif</b>.<p><h2>Galileo</h2>Galileo is a NASA spacecraft mission to Jupiter. The spacecraft, consisting ofan orbiter and an atmospheric entry probe, was launched aboard the SpaceShuttle Atlantis on October 18th, 1989. Galileo is flying a complex path thatrequires three planetary fly-bys for gravitational boosts (like a kind ofsling-shot).  This gives NASA scientists three opportunities to look at theEarth through Galileo's instruments, which include a color camera.<p>After its launch in 1989, Galileo entered a gravity-assist path which isneeded to attain the energy necessary to reach Jupiter. It passed Venus onFebruary 10, 1990, and Earth on December 8, 1990. A final pass by Earth onDecember 10, 1992 put Galileo on a direct trajectory leg to Jupiter. ThisVenus-Earth-Earth gravity-assist (VEEGA) trajectory will take more than sixyears from launch to arrival at Jupiter.  When Galileo arrives in December1995, an atmospheric probe will descend through Jupiter's clouds and send itsscientific measurements to Earth via the orbiter. Then the orbiter will beginan orbital tour of Jupiter to study and map the major satellites from as closeas a few hundred miles and to monitor the behavior of Jupiter's atmosphere andmagnetosphere for about two years.  <p><h2>Images</h2>The first image the students will display [<b>GalOptic.gif</b>] is a colorpicture taken by Galileo at a distance of roughly 2.1 million kilometers whileon its first pass in 1990. It shows the whole earth, with South Americaprominent near the center. At the top, the east coast of the United States,including Florida, is visible. Picturesque weather fronts are visible in theSouth Atlantic at the lower right. The west coast of Africa is visible on thehorizon at right.  This is an optical image, taken using red, green, and violetfilters. You will notice that a sizable amount of area is covered by clouds.When areas are cloud-covered, a camera using visible light can not see throughthe clouds to the land below.<p>The second image displayed by the students [<b>GalInfra.gif</b>] is anotherGalileo image of the same area. This image was taken three minutes earlier,using light in the near infrared, with a wavelength of 1 micron. Thiswavelength easily penetrates atmospheric hazes and enhances the brightness ofland surfaces. You can see that less land has been obscured by clouds than inthe optical image.  <p><table border=7 cellpadding=5>   <tr>   <td>      <a href="../CONTENTS.HTM">Teacher's Guide - Table of Contents      </a>   </td>   </tr></table><p><font size=1><i>Converted to the IBM-PC by Al Wong, al.wong@jpl.nasa.gov<br><br>Jet Propulsion Laboratory<br>4800 Oak Grove Drive<br>Pasadena, CA 91109<br></i></font></body></html>

The image shows the FurnaceCreek alluvial fan and Furnace Creek Ranch at the far right and the sand dunesat Stovepipe Wells at the center.  Note that this image does not correspondcompletely with <b>Shuttle2.gif</b> -- the Furnace Creek area does not appearon <b>Shuttle2.gif</b><p><a href="../../../../DATA/MODS1TO5/MODULE04/IMAGES/COLORIMG/KLIUOPTI.GIF">KliuOpti.gif (217K GIF)</a>- </b>Hand-held photograph of Kliuchevskoi volcanoon the Kamchatka peninsula in eastern Russia.  This photograph was taken onSeptember 30, 1994, the first day of the second SIR-C mission during the earlyhours of the eruption. The ash plume, which reached heights of more than 18kilometers (50,000 feet), is emerging from a vent on the north flank ofKliuchevskoi, partially hidden by the plume and its shadow in this view. Thiseruption produced ash, gas and dust and few (if any) new lava flows resulted.The photograph is oriented with north toward the bottom, for comparison withthe radar image (<b>Kliuche2.gif</b>) acquired a few days later. Near thecenter of the photo, a small whitish steam plume may be seen emanating from thegrowing lava dome of a companion volcano, Bezymianny. <p> <a href="../../../../DATA/MODS1TO5/MODULE04/IMAGES/COLORIMG/KLIUCHE2.GIF">Kliuche2.gif (434K GIF)</a>- </b>In this radar image, Kliuchevskoi is the bluetriangular peak in the center of the image, towards the left edge of the brightred area that delineates bare snow cover.  North is toward the bottom of theimage. The radar illumination is from the top of the image.  The colors in thisimage were obtained using the following radar channels: red represents the L-band (horizontally transmitted and received); green represents the L-band(horizontally transmitted and vertically received); blue represents the C-band(horizontally transmitted and vertically received). In addition toKliuchevskoi, two other active volcanoes are visible in the image. Bezymianny,the circular crater above and to the right of Kliuchevskoi, contains a slowlygrowing lava dome. Tolbachik is the large volcano with a dark summit craternear the upper right edge of the red snow covered area. The Kamchatka Riverruns from right to left across the bottom of the image.  Melting snow mixedwith volcanic ash triggered mudflows on the flanks of the volcano. Paths ofthese flows can be seen as thin lines in various shades of blue and green onthe north flank in the center of the image.<p> <a href="../../../../DATA/MODS1TO5/MODULE04/IMAGES/COLORIMG/MEVEREST.GIF">MEverest.gif (251K GIF)</a>- </b> This file contains a side-by-side hand-held photographand a radar image of Mt. Everest.  The peak of Mount Everest (8,848 meters or29,028 feet), can be seen near the center of each image. The SIR-C radar imagewas acquired through thick cloud cover on April 16, 1994 and the hand heldphotograph was taken under clear conditions on October 10, 1994. Both imagesshow an area approximately 70 kilometers by 38 kilometers (43 miles by 24miles); North is toward the upper left.  The colors in the radar image wereobtained using the following radar channels: red represents the L-band(horizontally transmitted and received); green represents the L-band(horizontally transmitted and vertically received); blue represents the C- band(horizontally transmitted and vertically received).  Radar illumination is fromthe top of the frame. The optical photograph has been geometrically adjusted tobetter match the area shown in the radar image.  Many features of the Himalayanterrain are visible in both images.  Snow covered areas appear white in theoptical photograph while the same areas appear bright blue in the radar image.The radar image, taken in early spring shows deep snow cover; the opticalphotograph, taken in late summer shows minimum snow cover. The curving andbranching features seen in both images are glaciers. The two wavelengths andmultiple polarizations of the SIR-C radar are sensitive to characteristics ofthe glacier surfaces that are not detected by conventional photography, such asthe ice roughness, water content and stratification.  For this reason, theglaciers show a variety of colors in the radar image (blue, purple, red,yellow, white) but only appear as gray or white in the photograph.<p><table border=7 cellpadding=5>   <tr>   <td>      <a href="../CONTENTS.HTM">Teacher's Guide - Table of Contents      </a>   </td>   </tr></table><p><font size=1><i>Converted to the IBM-PC by Al Wong, al.wong@jpl.nasa.gov<br><br>Jet Propulsion Laboratory<br>4800 Oak Grove Drive<br>Pasadena, CA 91109<br></i></font></body></html>

These scientists presented plans to NASA to use data from SIR-C/X-SARin their research.  The final team was selected in 1988.  Each SIR-C/X-SARScience team member was selected to carry out a specific scientificinvestigation.  Several central themes have emerged from the investigationsthat are central to the overall SIR-C/X-SAR mission.  These themes are largelyrelated to global cycles including:<p><ul type=circle><li>Oceans - ocean circulation patterns<li>Ecosystems - the global carbon cycle<li>Hydrology - the hydrologic cycle<li>Geology - geologic processes including the study of ancient climates<li>Rain and Clouds - air-sea interactions.   </ul><p><h2>SIR-C/X-SAR Supersites</h2> Of the more than 400 SIR-C/X-SAR sites, 34 were chosen as Supersites andBackup Supersites to represent different environments within each scientificdiscipline.  These sites were the highest priority targets for the SIR-C/X-SARmission.  This means that if problems developed during the missions thatreduced the ability to collect data, these sites would have had the highestpriority.  In addition, Supersites and Backup Supersites were sites where morethan one investigator worked together to provide an interdisciplinary look atone area. <p>As it turns out, there were no major radar or shuttle operational problemsduring either the first or second flight of the SIR-C/X-SAR antenna.  So datacollection was not restricted to the Supersite and Backup Supersites.  In fact,data was collected at over 400 sites on each mission.<p>The Supersites and Backup Supersites are also areas where intensive field workoccurred before, during, and after the mission.  The field work includedsetting out corner reflectors/calibration devices for the over flight ofSIR-C/X-SAR and completing "GROUND TRUTH" studies before, during, and after themission. Scientists recorded the locations of each measurement and use thisinformation to interpret the radar images.  Ground truth measurements alsodescribe areas for long term studies.  Some typical ground measurementsinclude:<p><ul type=circle><li>Ecology : tree geometry and density, crop type and distribution<li>Geology : rock type and distribution, surface character (boulders, sand,etc.)<li>Oceanography : wave height, wind direction<li>Hydrology : soil moisture, snow thickness and extent </ul><p>About 100 hours of SIR-C/X-SAR data was recorded onboard during each flight.A limited amount of data was transmitted to ground receivers for near-real-timedigital processing during the mission for key sites around the world to checkon the health of the radar and also for image press release during themission.<p>Sites from which data was collected to address the global carbon andhydrologic cycles include tropical forests in the Amazon Basin, boreal forestsin northern Michigan, and temperate forests in North Carolina.  Sites at whichdata was collected to address the hydrologic cycle include areas of Brazil,Italy, and the midwestern United States.  Paleoclimate and geologic processstudies are focused on arid areas in North Africa, semi-arid areas in thesouthwest U.S., tectonically-active areas in the south central Andes, and thevolcanically active Galapagos Islands.  Oceanography experiments are focused onthe Gulf Stream, the East North Atlantic, and in the Southern Ocean.  Cornerreflectors and other devices for calibration were deployed at supersites insouthern Germany, The Netherlands, and Australia, as well as at othersupersites.<p><IMG SRC="SITELOCS.GIF"><p> <h2>SIR-C/X-SAR Science Objectives</h2> The sensitivity of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) to surface and, in somecases, subsurface geometry and roughness, and to electrical properties canprovide information about land, ocean surfaces and vegetation cover that iscomplementary to measurements made by sensors operating in the visible, nearinfrared, and thermal infrared portions of the electromagnetic spectrum.  SARprovides its own illumination and can therefore produce reliable multitemporaldata independent of weather or solar illumination, through all seasons, and atany latitude. Radar waves penetrate clouds and, under certain conditions,vegetation canopies, ice, and very dry sand or soil, making it possible toexplore near-surface zones  not accessible with other remote sensingtechniques.  It should be noted that 3-dimensional features (e.g. mountains)are enhanced, in comparison with optical imaging sensors, due to theside-looking illumination and imaging geometry.  <p>The SIR-C/X-SAR missions, in April and October 1994, extended the capabilityof an aircraft campaign by providing regional scale data over a short timeperiod.  The mission design also enabled areas to be imaged at differentincidence angles on subsequent days, an important parameter for studying manyland and ocean processes.  The extensive ground truth measurement campaignsprovided critical data to be used in development of algorithms  to produce dataproducts for studying global change issues.  By having multiple flights,insights on seasonal variations for the key science issues is also provided.Such long-term development studies are critical for developing the requirementsand mission design for future radar missions.<p><h2>Earlier Imaging Radar Missions</h2> The two flights of SIR-C/X-SAR in 1994 differ from the earlier missions, SIR-Aand SIR-B, in that (1) SIR-C/X-SAR was the primary payload, (2) the two flightsprovided a unique look at seasonal change in radar signatures and (3) theastronauts provided round-the-clock observations of the Earth to coincide withradar data collection.  The crew onboard the SIR-C/X-SAR flights had anopportunity to help explore the relationships between the radar data andweather conditions beyond what is possible by the investigators on the ground.<p>The first Shuttle Imaging Radar, SIR-A, was flown in November 1981;this was the second flight of the shuttle and the first scientific payload everflown.  There were two crew members onboard.  For the early flights,experiments on board the Shuttle did not involve any crew interaction.  Thehandheld photographs (HHPs) acquired on the mission were assessed along withthe SIR-A radar data.  In several cases, coincident photographs and radar datawere coincidentally obtained which prompted the Science Team for the next SIRexperiment, SIR-B in 1984, to pursue the use of shuttle-based observationsobtained in parallel with the radar data.<p>Pre-mission planning and crew training prepared the astronauts for acquiringphotographs of the SIR-B sites during the mission, but only as time permitted.Observations made by the crew had a very significant effect on the results ofsome the SIR-B investigations.  A photograph of the southern ocean ice was usedto determine the location and concentration of thin first-year ice and openwater which was critical in the interpretation of the radar data.  A map ofgeologic structure, generated from a photographic stereo pair obtained over theAndes mountains, was used in the interpretation of the radar data over thisarea.<p><h2>Crew Observations</h2> Science observations by the shuttle crew included photographic documentationof the sites on a routine basis and visual observations of features of interestwhich are recorded as notes, voiced down to the operations center during themission, and discussed with the science investigators after the mission.  Theseobservations may or may not be backed up with photographic documentation.  Theobservations describe interactions of the atmosphere, oceans and land surface,and identify unpredicted or transient phenomena for potential imaging.<p>The primary camera used for Earth observations is a Hasselblad 70 mm camera.Accompanying equipment includes three lenses (50, 100, and 250 mm), a data linkto record time, filters, film magazines and various types of film.  The 100 mmlens offers spatial resolution similar to the Landsat Multi-Spectral Scanner(MSS) (80 m) and the 250 mm lens offers Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) resolution(30 m).  With the 250 mm lens, the Hasselblad is capable of obtainingphotographs at the same resolution as the SAR images but with a much largerfield of view.<p>A Linhof Aero Technika and a Nikon F4 35 mm camera are also available.  TheLinhof uses 5 inch film and is useful for photographing large areas withresolutions similar to the Hasselblad.  Lenses include a 90 and a 250 mm.  TheNikon F4 is provided with an interchangeable 35-70 mm zoom lens, and 28, 200,and 300 mm autofocus lenses.  <p>The shuttle provides a number of unique optical perspectives.  A non-polarshuttle orbit provides an opportunity to obtain variable sun-angle photographyover the duration of the mission.  The current polar orbiting platforms (SPOT,Landsat, AVHRR, etc.) are all in sun-synchronous orbits therefore preventingacquisition of variable sun angle data.  From the shuttle's lower inclinationorbits, the complete range of sun angles from dawn to dusk are available; allare useful for observations, although low sun angles are particularly usefulfor highlighting subtle topographic or roughness features.  <p>Sun glint is the reflection of the sun on water surfaces; it representsscattering in the forward direction and is a function of the sun angle and theamount of small scale surface roughness.  Wind stress, waves, and currentscontrol ocean patterns that may be observed in sun glint.  When the ocean iscalm, the sun glint is bright and the area of bright ocean is small.  When theocean is rougher, the scattered light is more diffuse and the bright area isenlarged by wave facets that produce reflections from many differentdirections.  Thus the sun glint can be related to physical phenomena thatroughen and calm the ocean's surface such as wind stress, wave-currentinteractions, and biological or chemical properties of the surface of the oceanwhich can create surface slicks.  In a similar fashion, radar energy isscattered off the ocean surface, in this case in the backscattered direction.The rougher the ocean the greater the radar return.  During the SIR-C/ X-SARmission, the crew was on the look out for sun glint and took photographs ofthis phenomenon.  Some of these photographs can be found in the Oceansdirectory.<p> <h2>Dynamic Surface Phenomena</h2> Although the radar can penetrate clouds and "SEE" the Earth's surfaceday or night and in all seasons, the radar is very sensitive to the seasonaland meteorological (weather) state of the surface at the time of imaging.Changes in the seasonal state of the surface can change the radar backscatterby up to 10 dB.  Clouds not only affect the state of the surface as viewed bythe radar, but may attenuate the radar beam by several dB, especially at theshorter X- and C-band wavelengths.  Observations of cloud location and type arereadily made from space.  For SIR-C/X-SAR, observations of the atmosphere andsurface at the same time are very important in understanding the radarobservations for a site, especially when comparing results obtained atdifferent times during the mission.  Radar data interpretation must be done inthe context of the Earth's surface state at the time of imaging.<p> <h2>SIR-C/X-SAR Science Themes</h2>  The central science themes of the SIR-C/X-SAR missions are examinedhere in more detail.<p><h2>i)  Oceans</h2> How waves move through the oceans and how the air and sea interact with eachother play a major role in determining the earth's climate.  The ocean storesheat and energy and air-sea interactions move this heat and energy around theearth.  The Gulf Stream, off the east coast of North America is a good exampleof how heat is moved around the globe; this major current moves heat from theequatorial region into the northern Atlantic allowing tropical plants, such aspalm trees, to grow along the southern coast of Ireland.<p>SIR-C/X-SAR images of oceans are used to study large surface and internalwaves, wind motion at the ocean surface, and ocean current motion.  These dataassist scientists in understanding how the Earth's climate is moderated by theocean.  In shallow areas, radar images can be related to the topography of theocean bottom.  Natural and man-induced oil spills can also be imaged andmonitored using imaging radar.<p>The distribution of sea ice largely determines the heat and water balance nearthe Earth's poles. Imaging radar can be used to study the seasonal distributionof sea ice.  Although SIR-C/X-SAR's was not in a polar orbit (the highestlatitude it reached was 57deg. north and south), sea ice images were collectedover the Sea of Okhotsk in the eastern Soviet Union, and the Labrador sea offthe coast of Newfoundland.<p>At high latitudes, sea ice is in constant motion, particularly alongthe ice pack margins, the regions viewed by SIR-C/X-SAR in its 57deg. orbitinclination.  The concentrations of open water, first year (thin) ice andmultiyear (thicker) ice, as well as the location of the ice margin and thelocation and concentration of ice bergs changed from day-to-day throughout themission.  The interaction of the open ocean and the ice at the ice margins isof particular interest; these regions often contain extensive spiral eddies.<p>The ocean is a dynamic system, strongly influenced by the atmosphere.  Theocean surface temperature also has a significant effect on clouds.  Radar issensitive to the manifestations of this dynamic air-sea system, specifically tocapillary and gravity waves, internal waves, mesoscale and sub-mesoscale(spiral) eddies, current boundaries, bathymetric features (and tides), oceanfronts, sediment fluxes, island wakes, currents in tidal inlets and shallowareas, and convergent surface currents in upwelling regions.  In addition, theradar return is sensitive to oil slicks and natural algal blooms whichinfluence the roughness of the ocean's surface. <p>Our current understanding of the geophysical information contained in radarimagery of the ocean surface is often limited due to the lack of other datadescribing the state of the ocean at the time of data collection.Documentation of ocean state in parallel with SIR-C/X-SAR radar data mayprovide key information needed to more fully evaluate the radar ocean imagery.In addition, shuttle-based photography of the ocean experiment sites shows theinvestigators' ships involved in surface truth data collection relative to theradar swath and ocean features.  Observations and photography of regional oceansystems and clouds provides the regional context within which the radar swathis located.  This is more important to radar studies of the oceans than of landsites; the regional context of land sites does not change as rapidly during an11-day mission (at least we hope not!).<p>  <h2>ii)  Ecosystems</h2> Ecologists study life on earth and how different life forms interact with eachother and their local environment.  SIR-C/X-SAR collected ecology data overtropical forests including the Amazon basin in South America, and overtemperate forests in North Carolina and Michigan, and in Central Europe.SIR-C/X-SAR images are used to study:<p><ul type=circle><li>land use<li>vegetation type and extent<li>effects of fires, flooding, and clear cutting</ul><p>The three frequencies available on SIR-C/X-SAR interact with vegetation ondifferent scales providing three views of the forest.  SIR-C/X-SAR data areimproving our understanding of forest geometry.  By studying changes in forestsbetween missions, scientists can assess the effects that changing environmentalconditions and land use has on forests and in turn, on the global carboncycle.<p>The earth's vegetated surface as viewed by SAR varies significantly withweather conditions and the surface cover.  Recent results of experiments tounderstand the day-night variations in the radar backscatter of forestsindicate there is a strong diurnal (day/night) signature related to thedielectric constant (electrical property) which in turn is related to plantwater status.  When clouds pass over vegetation and cut off solar energy, thephotosynthetic process slows down or stops, water potential rises and thedielectric constant changes.  <p>On a longer term basis, changes in the weather conditions and forestvegetation state over the duration of each mission and between missionsproduced significant changes in the radar backscatter.   <p>Specific phenomena which may be documented through visual observations includesnow existence and extent, flood existence and extent (through sun glintphotography), leaf on/off and/or leaf color (green or yellow/red),deforestation extent and vegetation vigor or greenness which is related towater status.  In addition, acquisition of radar imagery of forests during andafter forest fires would provide a valuable "TARGET OF OPPORTUNITY" data set.Depending on the season, the probability of fire occurrence in particularregions determined specific areas to monitor intensively.<p><h2>iii)  Hydrology</h2> Hydrologists study the global water cycle focusing on processes that occur onland.  (As opposed to Oceanographers who focus on the worlds oceans.)  Inaddition to water in swamps, lakes, rivers, and mud puddles, large amounts ofwater are stored as soil moisture and in vegetation; this is an important partof the global water cycle and plays a major role in surface moisture and globalenergy fluxes.  The amount of water a surface or material contains in partdetermines its electrical properties.  Since radar is sensitive to theelectrical properties of a surface it is useful for measuring soil andvegetative moisture over large areas and how these vary between seasons.SIR-C/X-SAR hydrology investigations are focused on Brazil, Oklahoma,Pennsylvania, and Italy.  Radar data from these sites are being used todetermine soil moisture patterns.  These studies will help develop ways toestimate soil moisture and evaporation rate over large areas.  This informationwill be valuable input to large-scale, regional hydrologic models.<p>Likewise, in mountainous and high latitude regions, seasonal snow cover is amajor storage component in the hydrologic cycle.  Spring snow melt oftendominates the annual runoff cycle and resulting water supply, ground water andreservoir recharge rates.  For many areas, long-term or ground-based snow coverdata do not exist and remotely sensed data provide the only way to acquire thisinformation.  SIR-C/X-SAR acquired data on snow cover over Mammoth Lakes,California; radar data on snow and glacial cover were acquired over theAustrian Alps, the Himalayas and the Patagonian district in Southern Chilewhich contains the largest modern glaciers and ice fields in South America.X-band data are useful for determining snow type, while L- and C-band data arebe used for estimating snow volume.<p>Wetlands are sources of many trace gases that are important parts of theglobal atmospheric cycle.  Wetlands are also especially vulnerable to humanalteration.  SIR-C/X-SAR radar data are used to determine the extent and limitsof selected wetlands areas, as well as their changing conditions.<p>The hydrologic state of the earth's surface varied significantly over theduration of the mission and from mission to mission due to precipitation(including snow) and the ensuing dry-down.  Although it is not possible toobserve either rain or soil moisture visually from the shuttle, it is possibleto observe clouds which could potentially be raining by identifying cloud type,and lightning, which is directly correlated to rain.  This knowledge isimportant for rain and snow experiments.  It is also important for otherexperimenters requiring calibrated radar data as the existence of snow and/orrain within the experimental area may influence the radar backscatter.<p><h2>iv)  Geology</h2> Geologists study the present surface of the Earth and by looking at olderrocks, how it came to be and how it may have looked in the past.  SIR-C/X-SARdata are useful for mapping geologic structures and variations in rock typesover large areas.  These data are especially useful in areas of heavyvegetation and continuous cloud cover where field work is often difficult.<p>Long radar wavelengths (24 cm: L-band on SIR-C) can penetrate below thesurface in extremely dry desert areas.  This allows scientists to map geologicstructures buried under the sand and to identify ancient stream systems.Discovery of ancient stream systems in the Sahara have had importantimplications for past climate histories and also for present possible sourcesof water.<p>The SAR is sensitive to scatterers (sand grains, rocks, etc.) that areapproximately the size of SIR-C/X-SAR's radar wavelengths (3, 6 and 24 cm).Thus a variety of surfaces, from sand to rough lava flows, can be mapped withimaging radar.  These different wavelengths allow various geologic processes tobe studied including soil/sediment erosion, transportation, deposition, anddegradation.  These processes have an impact on sedimentation in rivers,streams, river deltas and coastal environments and affect the amount of landavailable for food production.<p>The radar's sensitivity to surface roughness allows scientists to study thehistory of past climate change and the relative age of surfaces because as landsurfaces age and are exposed to weathering, they generally change theirroughness characteristics.<p>Although the geologic state of the surface was unlikely to change during theSIR-C/X-SAR mission or even between the two missions, the state of the surfacein terms of vegetation and snow cover did change and do strongly influence theinterpretation of the radar imagery for geologic purposes.<p>In addition to monitoring meteorological conditions, shuttle-based photographsfor geology experiments with SIR-C/X-SAR provide information on the geologicsetting and regional context of the radar imagery.  Low sun angle photographynot available through SPOT or Landsat provide a unique opportunity for viewingsubtle surface features to which the radar is sensitive; these photographs areparticularly valuable in understanding the mechanisms of subsurface imaging ofancient river systems in northeastern Africa as they highlight surfaceroughness patterns which may be confused with subsurface radar signatures.Stereo photography provides a three-dimensional perspective of a region.Monitoring of active volcanoes during the mission provides an opportunity toobtain radar imagery of erupting volcanoes and/or fresh lava flows.  Activevolcanoes are observed on approximately 50% of all shuttle flights and this wasthe case for the two SIR-C missions.  Indeed, Kliuchevskoi volcano, on theKamchatka peninsula started an eruptive episode the day the second SIR-Cmission was launched!<p><h2>v)  Rain and Clouds </h2> Throughout the history of radar, one of the main selling points has been itsability to "SEE THROUGH CLOUDS".  Recently, however, clouds have become animportant factor in the future analysis of SIR-C/X-SAR data due to threefactors:<p><ol><li>At X-band (3 cm) and possibly at C-band (6 cm), clouds and associatedrain may attenuate (reduce the strength of) or scatter radar signalssignificantly.  In addition, rain occurring at the time of data acquisitionchanges the dielectric properties of the surface soil and vegetation, thusaffecting the backscatter.<p><li>Clouds indicate wind direction, thermal boundaries and storm systemsassociated with ocean surface state.  In particular, cloud patterns in thesouthern ocean can be used to predict the position of convective storms thusproviding a means of focusing data collection for the southern ocean waveexperiment.<p><li>Clouds limit incident radiation on the Earth's surface and thereforechange the water status of the surface vegetation.  In particular, cloudsdecrease or stop transpiration which in turn changes plant water potential,dielectric constant and radar backscatter.  </ol><p>Two SIR-C/X-SAR experiments are evaluating the ability of radar to image rain.These investigations require imaging of rain systems and therefore decisions onwhether or not to take data were made during the mission.  The scientistsresponsible for those experiments identified areas in the Western Pacificocean, the "RAINIEST PLACE ON EARTH", as having the best chance for imagingrain.<p><table border=7 cellpadding=5>   <tr>   <td>      <a href="../CONTENTS.HTM">Teacher's Guide - Table of Contents      </a>   </td>   </tr></table><p><font size=1><i>Converted to the IBM-PC by Al Wong, al.wong@jpl.nasa.gov<br><br>Jet Propulsion Laboratory<br>4800 Oak Grove Drive<br>Pasadena, CA 91109<br></i></font></body></html>

However, colors doserve to bring out subtle features and they do make each image easier tointerpret.<p>Look in the directory called <b>/Data/Mods1to5/Module04/Images/Volcano</b>.The following files shouldbe in the directory for this lesson:<p><ul type=circle><li>Colima, Mexico :     <a href="../../../../DATA/MODS1TO5/MODULE04/IMAGES/VOLCANO/COLIMAMX.GIF">    ColimaMx.gif (268.gif)</a><li>Galeras, Colombia	 :     <a href="../../../../DATA/MODS1TO5/MODULE04/IMAGES/VOLCANO/GALEVOLC.GIF">    GaleVolc.gif (162K GIF)</a><li>Mauna Loa, United States :     <a href="../../../../DATA/MODS1TO5/MODULE04/IMAGES/VOLCANO/MAUNALOA.GIF">    MaunaLoa.gif (276K GIF)</a><li>Mount Rainier, United States :     <a href="../../../../DATA/MODS1TO5/MODULE04/IMAGES/VOLCANO/MRAINIER.GIF">    MRainier.gif (323K GIF)</a><li>Nyiragongo, Zaire :     <a href="../../../../DATA/MODS1TO5/MODULE04/IMAGES/VOLCANO/RWANDA.GIF">    Rwanda.gif (408K GIF)</a><li>Unzen, Japan :     <a href="../../../../DATA/MODS1TO5/MODULE04/IMAGES/VOLCANO/UNZEN.GIF">    Unzen.gif (210K GIF)</a><li>Taal, Philippines :     <a href="../../../../DATA/MODS1TO5/MODULE04/IMAGES/VOLCANO/TAAL.GIF">    Taal.gif (355K GIF)</a></ul><p>The other eight Decade Volcanoes are: <p><ul type=circle><li>Etna, Italy<li>Merapi, Indonesia<li>Sakura-jima, Japan<li>Santorini, Greece<li>Teide, Spain<li>Vesuvius, Italy <li>Santiaguito, Guatemala<li>Ulawun, Papua New Guinea</ul><p>An explanation of these images follows.<p><a href="../../../../DATA/MODS1TO5/MODULE04/IMAGES/VOLCANO/COLIMAMX.GIF">ColimaMx.gif (268.gif)</a>- This is a SIR-C image of the Colima volcano in Jalisco, Mexico, avigorously active volcano that erupted as recently as July 1994. The eruptionpartially destroyed a lava dome at the summit and deposited a new layer of ashon the volcano's southern slopes. Surrounding communities face a continuingthreat of ashfalls and volcanic mudflows from the volcano.  This image wasacquired SIR-C/X-SAR on October 1, 1994.  The image is centered at 19.4 degreesnorth latitude, 103.7 degrees west longitude. The area shown is approximately35.7 kilometers by 37.5 kilometers (22 miles by 23 miles).  The summit areaappears orange and the recent deposits fill the valleys along the south andsouthwest slopes. <p><u>Color Assignments:</u><p><ul>red = L-band horizontally transmitted and received<br>green = L-band horizontally transmitted and vertically received<br>blue = ratio of the two channels</ul><p>  <a href="../../../../DATA/MODS1TO5/MODULE04/IMAGES/VOLCANO/GALEVOLC.GIF">GaleVolc.gif (162K GIF)</a>- This SIR-C radar image of the area surrounding the Galeras volcano in southernColombia shows the ability of a multi-frequency radar to map volcanicstructures that can be dangerous to study on the ground.  Galeras has eruptedmore than 20 times since the area was first visited by European explorers inthe 1500s.  Volcanic activity levels have been high in the last five years,including an eruption in January 1993 that killed nine people on a scientificexpedition to the volcano summit.  Galeras is the light green area near thecenter of the image.  The active cone, with a small summit pit, is the redfeature nestled against the lower right edge of the caldera (crater) wall.  Thecity of Pasto, with a population of 300,000, is shown in orange near the bottomof the image, just 8 kilometers (5 miles) from the volcano. The image wasacquired on April 15, 1994.  North is toward the upper right. The area shown is49.1 by 36.0 kilometers (30.5 by 22.3 miles), centered at 1.2 degrees northlatitude and 77.4 degrees west longitude.

The large summit crater, called MokuaweoweoCaldera, is clearly visible near the center of the image.  Leading away fromthe caldera (towards top right and lower center) are the two main rift zonesshown here in orange.  Rift zones are areas of weakness within the upper partof the volcano that are often ripped open by new magma (molten rock) as itapproaches the surface at the start of an eruption.  The most recent eruptionof Mauna Loa was in March and April 1984, when segments of the northeast riftzones were active.  <p>If the height of the volcano is measured from its base on the ocean floorinstead of from sea level, Mauna Loa is the tallest mountain on Earth.  Itspeak (center of the image) rises more than 8 kilometers (5 miles) above theocean floor.  The South Kona District, known for cultivation of macadamia nutsand coffee, can be seen in the lower left as white and blue areas along thecoast.  North is toward the upper left. The area shown is 41.5 by 75 kilometers(25.7 by 46.5 miles), centered at 19.5 degrees north latitude and 155.6 degreeswest longitude. The image was acquired on October 2, 1994. The radarillumination is from the left of the image.  The color combinations in thisradar image are caused by differences in surface roughness of the lava flows.Smoother flows, called pahoehoe flows, are depicted in red, and rougher flows,called a'a flows in volcanology terminology that originated in the Hawaiianlanguage, are shown in yellow and white.  Hawaii's other most active volcano,Kilauea, is located off to the right of Mauna Loa and is not visible in thisimage. <p><u>Color Assignments:</u><p><ul>red = L-band horizontally transmitted and received<br>green = L-band horizontally transmitted, vertically received<br>blue = C-band horizontally transmitted, vertically received</ul> <p><a href="../../../../DATA/MODS1TO5/MODULE04/IMAGES/VOLCANO/MRAINIER.GIF">MRainier.gif (323K GIF)</a>- This is a SIR-C radar image of Mount Rainier in Washington state. The roundcone at the center of the image is the 14,435-foot (4,399- meter) peak of MountRainier.  The volcano last erupted about 150 years ago and numerous largefloods and debris flows have originated on its slopes during the last century.Today the volcano is heavily mantled with glaciers and snowfields.  More than100,000 people live on young volcanic mudflows less than 10,000 years old and,consequently, are within the range of future, devastating mudslides. This imagewas acquired on October 1, 1994.  The area shown in the image is approximately59 kilometers by 60 kilometers (36.5 miles by 37 miles).  North is toward thetop left.  In addition to highlighting topographic slopes facing the spaceshuttle, SIR-C records rugged areas as brighter and smooth areas as darker.The scene was illuminated by the shuttle's radar from the northwest so thatnorthwest-facing slopes are brighter and southeast-facing slopes are dark.Forested regions are pale green in color; clear cuts and bare ground are bluishor purple; ice is dark green and white.   On the lower slopes is a zone of rockridges and rubble (purple to reddish) above coniferous forests (inyellow/green).  The western boundary of Mount Rainier National Park is seen asa transition from protected, old-growth forest to heavily logged private land,a mosaic of recent clear cuts (bright purple/blue) and partially regrown timberplantations (pale blue).  The prominent river seen curving away from themountain at the top of the image (to the northwest) is the White River, and theriver leaving the mountain at the bottom right of the image (south) is theNisqually River, which flows out of the Nisqually glacier on the mountain.  Theriver to the left of the mountain is the Carbon River, leading west and northtoward heavily populated regions near Tacoma.  The dark patch at the top rightof the image is Bumping Lake.  Other dark areas seen to the right of ridgesthroughout the image are radar shadow zones.<p><u>Color Assignments:</u><p><ul>red = L-band horizontally transmitted and received<br>green = L-band horizontally transmitted, vertically received<br>blue = C-band horizontally transmitted, vertically received</ul> <p><a href="../../../../DATA/MODS1TO5/MODULE04/IMAGES/VOLCANO/RWANDA.GIF">Rwanda.gif (408K GIF)</a>- This is a SIR-C radar image of Central Africa, showing the Virunga volcanochain along the borders of Rwanda, Zaire and Uganda.  The image was acquired onOctober 3, 1994.  The area is centered at about 2.4 degrees south latitude and30.8 degrees east longitude. The image covers an area 56 kilometers by 70kilometers (35 miles by 43 miles).  The dark area at the top of the image isLake Kivu, which forms the border between Zaire (to the right) and Rwanda (tothe upper left).  The steep cone in the center of the image is Nyiragongovolcano, rising 3,465 meters (11,369 feet) high, with its central crater nowoccupied by a lava lake.  Nyiragongo has small craters and cones on it'sflanks.  To the right of Nyiragongo is the  cone of Nyamuragira volcano, whichis 3,053 meters (10,017 feet) tall, with radiating lava flows dating from the1950s to the late 1980s.  In the center left of the image is the Virungavolcanic field, home to the endangered mountain gorillas.  These activevolcanoes constitute a hazard to the towns of Goma, Zaire and the nearbyRwandan refugee camps, located on the shore of Lake Kivu at the top left.  Thisradar image highlights subtle differences in the vegetation of the region.  Thegreen patch to the center left of the image in the foothills of Karisimbi is abamboo forest where the mountain gorillas live.  The vegetation types in thisarea are an important factor in the habitat of mountain gorillas.  <p><u>Color Assignments:</u><p><ul>red = L-band horizontally transmitted and vertically received<br>green = C-band horizontally transmitted, vertically received<br>blue = C-band horizontally transmitted, horizontally received</ul><p><a href="../../../../DATA/MODS1TO5/MODULE04/IMAGES/VOLCANO/UNZEN.GIF">Unzen.gif (210K GIF)</a>- This is a SIR-C radar image of the area around the Unzen volcano, on the westcoast of Kyushu Island in southwestern Japan.  Unzen, which appears in thisimage as a large triangular peak with a white flank near the center of thepeninsula, has been continuously active since a series of powerful eruptionsbegan in 1991. The image was acquired on April 15, 1994 and shows an area 41.5kilometers by 32.8 kilometers (25.7 miles by 20.3 miles) that is centered at32.75 degrees north latitude and 130.15 degrees east longitude.  North istoward the upper left of the image.  The radar illumination is from the top ofthe image which is why the north flank of Unzen appears particularly bright inthis image.  The city of Shimabara sits along the coast at the foot of Unzen onits east and northeast sides and other settlements dot the coast along thewhole peninsula.  A dome of thick lava at the summit of Unzen has been growingcontinuously since 1991.  Collapses of the sides of this dome have generateddeadly avalanches of hot gas and rock known as pyroclastic flows.  These flowshave killed several people since this most recent eruption began.<p>  <u>Color Assignments:</u><p><ul>red = L-band vertically transmitted and vertically received<br>green = average of L-band &amp; C-band vertically transmitted and received<br>blue = C-band vertically transmitted, vertically received</ul><p><a href="../../../../DATA/MODS1TO5/MODULE04/IMAGES/VOLCANO/TAAL.GIF">Taal.gif (355K GIF)</a>- This is a SIR-C radar image of Taal volcano, near Manila on the islandof Luzon in the Philippines.  The black area in the center is Taal Lake, whichnearly fills the 30-kilometer-diameter (18-mile) Taal caldera. The caldera rimconsists of deeply eroded hills and cliffs.  The large island in Taal Lake,which itself contains a crater lake, is known as Volcano Island.  The brightyellow patch on the southwest side of Volcano island is the site of anexplosion crater that formed during a deadly eruption in 1965.  The image wasacquired on October 5, 1994 and shows an area approximately 56 kilometers by112 kilometers (34 miles by 68 miles) that is centered at 14.0 degrees northlatitude and 121.0 degrees east longitude.  North is toward the upper right ofthe image.  Since 1572, Taal has erupted at least 34 times.  Since early 1991,the volcano has been restless, with swarms of earthquakes, new steaming areas,ground fracturing, and increases in water temperature of the lake.Volcanologists and other local authorities are carefully monitoring Taal tounderstand if the current activity may foretell an eruption.  The bright areain the upper right of the image is the densely populated city of Manila, only50 kilometers (30 miles) north of the central crater. <p><u>Color Assignments:</u><p><ul>red = L-band horizontally transmitted and received<br>green = L-band horizontally transmitted, vertically received<br>blue = C-band horizontally transmitted, vertically received</ul><p><table border=7 cellpadding=5>   <tr>   <td>      <a href="../CONTENTS.HTM">Teacher's Guide - Table of Contents      </a>   </td>   </tr></table><p><font size=1><i>Converted to the IBM-PC by Al Wong, al.wong@jpl.nasa.gov<br><br>Jet Propulsion Laboratory<br>4800 Oak Grove Drive<br>Pasadena, CA 91109<br></i></font></body></html>

The files you will needare:<p><b>SanFranc.stk</b>, <b>SanFrkey.gif</b>, <b>SanFranc.gif</b> and <b>SanFranc.txt</b><p> To display the <b>SanFranc.stk</b> image, you need to run <a href="../../../../ROADMAP/REFERMAP/SOFTWARE/SIGMAUSE.HTM">the <b>Sigma0</b> program </a>then use the <b>Open Compressed Stokes</b> option under the <b>File</b>menu.

The following window should appear(or something similar): <p> <IMG SRC="MOD2SC3.GIF" alt="[SIGMA0 FILE MENU]"> <p>  Highlight the <b>Open compressed stokes</b> option.  A window will thenappear for you to select a directory/filename.  Go to the CD directory/DATA/MODS1TO5/MODULE02/IMAGES/AIRBORNE and select the file<b>SanFranc.stk</b> to open it.  You will now be given the <b>Options</b>window:<p><Img Src="../../LESSONS/OPTIO02A.GIF" alt="[SIGMA0 OPTIONS WINDOW]"><p>  Select <b>VV</b> and click on <b>OK</b>.  Another window will pop up:<p> <Img Src="../../LESSONS/HISTO02A.GIF" alt="[SIGMA0 HISTOGRAM WINDOW]"><p> Click <b>OK</b> for now.  We'll take a look at what this does a little later.<p>An image of San Francisco as taken in 1985 by a JPL airborne imaging radar willpop up on your screen.  <p>San Francisco image displayed using <b>Sigma0</b><p><IMG SRC="MOD2SEC6.GIF"><p>Run the cursor back and forth onto the Golden Gate bridge. As you are doingthat, notice what is happening with the three values at the bottom left of theimage. Those values tell you, in order, the X and Y coordinates of the cursorand the reflectivity of parts of the image to radar. <p>This value is the normalized radar cross section (<IMG SRC="MOD2SC7.GIF">). It ranges from about -40 to +5, where -40 represents almost no reflections ofthe radar pulses and +5 represents very high  reflectiveness.  In the Sigma0images, -40 is represented as black and +5 as white, with gray shadesrepresenting the numbers in between.  <p>To display the key to the San Francisco image, use the Finder to locate the<b>SanFrkey.gif </b>file. <p><IMG SRC="MOD2SC8.GIF"><p>Go back to Sigma0 using the Finder or redisplay the <b>SanFranc.stk</b>image if you quit Sigma0. Now go to <b>Image | Zoom in</b>. You have magnifiedthe image and not all of it can be seen any  more.  You can help this by movingthe cursor to the small box at the bottom right of the image, click and holdthe mouse while pulling the box towards the bottom right of the computerscreen.  Now you can see most of the image. <p>Go to a spot just above and left of the middle of the Golden Gate Bridge.Click and hold the mouse and move the cursor to the right of the bridge andbelow the middle. You should have created a box with "ANTS" marching aroundagain.  Now go to <b>Image | Zoom in </b>once more.  <p>Zoom in once more.  Find X,Y coordinates 110, 55 now. You will notice that theimage seems to be made up of a lot of little boxes - we call these <b>pictureelements</b> or <b>pixels.  </b>Each pixel contains one bit of information.Although we can make it bigger, we can't get more information from it.<p>Now close this image of San Francisco (click in the box at top left or go to<b>File | Close</b>).  Now open <b>SanFranc.stk</b> again<b> </b>(<b>File | OpenCompressed Stokes..., VV, OK</b>).  Again you should see the histogram windowbelow.  This is a histogram (a graph) of the number of pixels that haveparticular reflectiveness, ranging from very dark and unreflective (left) tovery light and reflective (right).  San Francisco seems to have a lot ofunreflective area.  Let's take a look at only the portion of the histogram thathas a lot of pixels.  Bring the tip of the cursor into the gray bar at thebottom of the window, click and hold the mouse, and then move the arrow insidethe bar to the position shown below.  Let up the mouse button:<p><Img Src="../../LESSONS/HISTO02B.GIF" alt="[SIGMA0 HISTOGRAM WINDOW]"><p> Click <b>OK.  </b> You will find that the image displayed will appear lighterthan the previous image, because you have instructed the computer to make themedium gray pixels into light gray and turn all of the old light gray valuesinto white.  This  change in the gray scale lets you  see more contrast betweenregions of the image that seem to look a lot alike.  This is often called<b>Enhancing the contrast.  </b>Bring the cursor back to the Golden Gatebridge, at X = 110 and Y = 55.  The number for <IMG SRC="MOD2SC10.GIF"><sup></sup>should not have changed.<p>This is important.  Making changes that help you see the things in the imagebetter DOES NOT change the data.  The radar reflectiveness of that portion ofthe  Golden  Gate  bridge HAS NOT CHANGED just because we changed the way thebridge looks on the computer <p><h3>What are those other choices under <b>Sigma0</b> Compressed Stokes?</h3>The radar sends out and collects horizontally and vertically polarized waves.Some horizontal waves are return unchanged, as horizontal waves.  These arerepresented in the Compressed Stokes table as <b>HH.  </b>These would bebouncing<b> </b>back<b> (backscattering) </b>mostly off of objects that arelarger than the waves or are mostly oriented horizontally.  In the same way,some vertical waves are sent out and collected unchanged.  These arerepresented as  <b>VV</b> and would be backscattered mostly off of objects thatare upright.<p><Img Src="../../LESSONS/OPTIO02B.GIF" alt="[SIGMA0 OPTION WINDOW]"><p> There are of course lots of objects that are tipped somewhat sideways and areneither horizontal nor vertical.  Tree branches are a good example of these.They may be pointing vertically, horizontally, or any which way in between.  <p>Sometimes a horizontal wave might bounce in such a way that it gets flipped tovertical - or a vertical wave might get flipped to horizontal.  This is what iscollected as <b>HV.  </b><p>  The correlation coefficient is a measurement of how much alike the<b>HH</b> and the <b>VV</b> scatterers are, expressed as a percent.    Theycould be completely different (0 % alike) or they can be completely similar(100% alike). Thus, correlation coefficient is a measurement expressed from 0to 100.  <p>Also of interest are the phase measurements, <b>HHVV, HVVV, </b>and <b>HHHV.</b>These give some indication of how much difference there is in the length ofthe path between two types of collected waves, such as <b>HH </b>and <b>VV.</b> <p>Open <b>SanFranc.stk</b> again (<b>File | Open compressed Stokes) </b>and thistime select <b>Correlation Coefficient</b>.  Go to the section of the GoldenGate bridge that we looked at before (X,Y coordinates 110,55).  <p>Make a box around the area of the bridge we have been looking at. (Click andhold the mouse as you drag out a box.)  Now zoom in several times.(<b>Image | Zoom in</b>)  You should still see the bridge on the screen as youenlarge the image.  Be sure to drag out the image so that it fills the entirescreen (Click and drag the box at bottom right of the image.)   After you zoomseveral times, you should see the option <b>Image | Display correlationcoefficients</b> appear in bold letters.  Click on this option. <p>Try other options in the Dialog box and compare the results with the key givenin <b>SanFrkey.gif</b>. You should see that some polarizations are very usefulfor separating urban areas from water or vegetation.<p><p><table border=7 cellpadding=5>   <tr>   <td>      <a href="../CONTENTS.HTM">Teacher's Guide - Table of Contents      </a>   </td>   </tr></table><p><font size=1><i>Converted to the IBM-PC by Al Wong, al.wong@jpl.nasa.gov<br><br>Jet Propulsion Laboratory<br>4800 Oak Grove Drive<br>Pasadena, CA 91109<br></i></font></body></html>

A radartransmits microwave signals and measures the strength and time delay of thereturned energy.  The time delay, t, of the echo can be used to determine therange or distance ,R, to an object, since microwaves travel at the speed oflight, c, and R = ct.<p>Imagine you are standing in 'echo valley' and you shout the word 'radar' atthe top of your voice. Then you hear an echo ('radar'). How loud is it? Howlong did it take for the echo to come back to you? These are the properties aradar measures: the strength of an electromagnetic wave can be compared withthe loudness of a sound wave; the time delay is the same idea, except thatsound waves travel at the speed of sound, not the speed of light.<p><h2>Radar Pulses</h2><h2>Objectives</h2><ol type=1><li>Students will see a visual of a radar pulse and  be able to describethe range of wavelengths (or frequencies) used for radar.<li>Students will  be able to describe the duration of a radar pulse as beingaround 10 micro-seconds.</ol><p>Pulse Duration<p><IMG SRC="MOD2SB2.GIF"><p>A radar transmits a parcel or packet of photons  known as a pulse. The photonsall have the same wavelength (or frequency), which will be in the range 1cm to1m for radar. The pulse duration (length) is <IMG SRC="MOD2SB3.GIF">which is typically around 10 micro-seconds. The transmitted pulse travels atthe speed of light for the medium (3x10<sup>8</sup> m/s in a vacuum). The powerlevel of the transmitted pulse is typically around 1 kilo-watt.<p><h2>Radar System</h2><h2>Objectives</h2><ol type=1><li>Students will be introduced to the main components of radar systems.<li>Students will be able to draw and label the following their correct order:transmitter, switch, antenna, radar pulse, receiver and data recorder,processor and display.<li>Students will be able to define the purpose of each component.</ol><p><IMG SRC="MOD2SB4.GIF"><p>In a simple radar system, the radar transmitter generates a high power radarpulse, which is fed to a switch known as a circulator, which directs thetransmitted pulse to the radar antenna. Radar antennas are constructed totransmit and receive pulses at particular radar wavelengths. On transmission,the antenna directs the transmitted pulse towards the target area. The energyreflected off the earth's surface comes back as a radar echo, which is thenreceived by the antenna. When receiving, the circulator switch directs thereturned echoes into the radar receiver, which converts the echoes to digitalnumbers. The radar data is then passed to the data  recorder, which stores thedata on disk or on tape. In imaging radars, the recorded data have to beprocessed first before they can be displayed as an image. This takes a lot ofcomputations and thus can take a long time.<p><p>Note that the radar does not transmit and receive at the same time - thecirculator switch is switched rapidly (say 1000 times a second) between thetransmit position and the receive position. The switch also serves to protectthe receiver from the high-power transmitted pulses, which could blow thereceiver.<p><p>Much like human vision, a radar system has a Source, a Scatterer, and anObserver.  In a radar system, the radar antenna acts as both the Source and theObserver.  Look at the diagram of the radar system.  The first step incollecting radar images is for the antenna to emit a parcel or packet ofphotons known as a pulse.  When the antenna is emitting a pulse of energy, itis referred to as a transmitter. Energy from this radar pulse that is reflectedback, known as backscatter, is collected by the antenna.  When the antenna iscollecting backscatter, it is referred to as a receiver.  The circulator switchalternates the antenna between transmitter mode and receiver mode. Thetransmitter and the receiver can not operate at the same time because theenergies being emitted and collected would interfere with each other.After theenergy has gone from Source (Transmitter) to Scatterer (planet surface), andback to the Observer (Receiver), the receiver then converts this energy intodigital information and sends it to the data recorder and display. This data isthen processed into a radar image of the target area.   <p><h2>Radar Vision</h2><h2>Objectives</h2><ol type=1><li>Students will know what happens to a radar pulse when it reaches theearth.<li>Students will be introduced to the term "BACKSCATTER".<li>Students will be able to associate the following words.  Source-Radar,Scatterer-Earth's surface, and Observation-Radar.</ol>When the radar transmits a pulse,<p><IMG SRC="MOD2SB5.GIF"><p>some of the energy in the radar pulse is reflected back towards the radar. Thisis  what the radar measures. It is known as radar backscatter. The radar cannot measure energy reflected in other directions.<p><IMG SRC="MOD2SB6.GIF"> <p><h2>A Hint for the Classroom</h2>A good analogy how radar works is the flash camera. The flash cameratransmits a pulse of (visible) light using the flash bulb, which also directs(or focuses) the pulse towards the subject (or target). The pulse of light isreflected off the subject and some of it is reflected back towards the camera.The shutter of the camera opens at a set time and serves as a circulatorswitch. The lens of the camera focuses the reflected light onto the film andserves as a receiver. The 'data' are recorded on the now exposed film, to beturned into an image later. The analogy of the flash camera can be takenfurther to image a 'swath' in the classroom, by moving the camera and takingseveral (overlapping) photographs, to simulate the way an imaging radar works.<p>Use a flash camera in your classroom, together with the diagram of a radarsystem, to show your students how imaging radar is just like a flash camera,operating using radio waves.<p><h2>Radar Imaging</h2><h2>Objectives</h2><ol type=1><li>Students will be able to determine the difference between an image that hasa low backscatter from one with a high backscatter by looking at thebrightness.<li>Students will view how the radar footprint moves to form an image in thearea of the swath.</ol> <p> <IMG SRC="MOD2SB7.GIF"><p>As the radar moves along its flight track, it images a swath along the ground.The schematic diagram above shows a radar in the Space Shuttle looking out tothe right and down as it flies along. The radar beam footprint is shown as ashaded ellipse. This footprint moves as the radar moves. As it moves along animage is built up of the area in the swath. Each pixel (picture element) in theradar image represents the radar backscatter for that area on the ground.Darker areas in the image represent low backscatter, while brighter areas inrepresent high backscatter. The  area shown is Los Angeles, with the PalosVerdes peninsula near the top of the picture, in the center, and Los AngelesInternational airport near the top right-hand corner.<p><h2>Synthetic Aperture Radar </h2><h2>Objectives</h2><ol type=1><li>Students will learn what  synthetic aperture radar means and howthis technique is used to resolve fine detail.</ol><p>Some types of imaging radar are often referred to as Synthetic ApertureRadar's or SAR's for short. SIR-C, for example, is a Synthetic Aperture Radar.This refers to a technique used to synthesize a very long antenna by combiningsignals (echoes) received by the radar as it moves along a track. A longantenna is desirable since, the longer the antenna, the finer the detail theradar can resolve, and the smaller the objects the radar can 'see'. Aperturerefers to the opening used to collect the reflected waves which are used toform an image. In the case of a camera, this would be the shutter opening; forradar it means the antenna. A <i>synthetic</i>  aperture can be constructed bymoving a real aperture or antenna to different positions. At each position apulse is transmitted, then the return echoes pass through the receiver and arerecorded in an 'echo store'.<p><p><IMG SRC="MOD2SB8.GIF"><p><p>Using the flashlight analogy, the bigger the reflecting bowl of theflashlight, the narrower the beam of light generated. For a flashlight theaperture is the reflecting bowl. Similarly, larger radar antennas will havefiner beams. The beam width for an antenna (or aperture) of size D isapproximately <IMG SRC="MOD2SB9.GIF">/Din radians, where <IMG SRC="MOD2SB10.GIF">is the wavelength at which the antenna operates.<p><p>For a 'real' antenna of length D, and a radar of wavelength <IMG SRC="MOD2SB11.GIF">,imaging an object at range R, the smallest resolvable object is of size ~<IMG SRC="MOD2SB12.GIF">R/D.For a 10m antenna, operating at 800 km range at wavelength 25 cm, this gives aminimum object size of 20 km. With a synthetic aperture of length 20km, aminimum object size of 5m can be resolved, since the resolution of a syntheticaperture is half the size of the actual antenna used, i.e. D/2. <p><p>Synthetic aperture radar is a technique used to generate radar images in whichfine detail can be resolved. To understand what a photograph means, we do notneed to understand the process use to grind the lens; in the same way, it isnot necessary to understand the synthetic aperture radar technique tounderstand what a radar image means.<p><h2>Radar Backscatter Measurements</h2><h2>Objectives</h2><ol type=1><li>Students will be introduced to the measurements used by scientists whostudy radar backscatter - known as radar cross section or RCS.<li>Students will be introduced to typical values of RCS for naturalsurfaces.</ol><p>Radar scientists measure backscatter (also known as radar cross section orRCS) in units of area (i.e. square meters). The radar cross section of anobject is often related to its actual size, as seen by the radar. For example,the RCS of a sphere is <IMG SRC="MOD2SB13.GIF">r<sup>2</sup>,where r is the radius of the sphere. Calculating the backscatter for morecomplicated geometrical shapes is less straightforward. In fact, many radarengineers have spent their careers constructing mathematical models which canbe used to predict radar cross section of an object. These models are used todesign aircraft or missiles with the lowest possible radar cross section, sothat they can not be detected by 'enemy' radars.<p><p>For looking at the earth, radar scientists often use a measure callednormalized radar cross section, <IMG SRC="MOD2SB14.GIF">,which is given by:<p><p> <IMG SRC="MOD2SB14.GIF">= 10log10 (RCS/A) where A is the area of the image pixel<p><p>The units for normalized radar cross section are decibel (dB), which is a kindof log scale. <IMG SRC="MOD2SB14.GIF"><sup></sup>has the advantage for radar scientists that it is independent of thepixel size in the image data. Thus, <IMG SRC="MOD2SB14.GIF"><sup></sup>measured for a corn field using an image with 100mx100m pixels would bethe same as for an image with 10mx10m pixels.<p><p>Example:  for an object with <IMG SRC="MOD2SB18.GIF">= -10dB, and an image pixel size of 10mx10m, the measured RCS would be10m<sup>2</sup>. If the normalized radar cross section, <IMG SRC="MOD2SB19.GIF">,is constant at -10dB over a large area and we look at it with an image pixelsize of 100mx100m, the RCS would be 1000m<sup>2</sup>.<p><p>Typical values of <IMG SRC="MOD2SB20.GIF">for natural surfaces are from + 5dB to - 40dB. + 5dB would correspond to a verybright feature in a radar image, and would mean that a very large fraction ofthe radar pulse energy is reflected back towards the radar. - 40dB would be avery dark feature in a radar image, and  would mean that very little of theenergy in the radar pulse is reflected back towards the radar. Those studentswho cannot grasp the log derivation of <IMG SRC="MOD2SB21.GIF">,can still learn to use the dB values to separate features. <p> <h2>Different Polarizations</h2> <h2>Objectives</h2> <ol type=1><li>Students will be introduced to the terms used in the measurement ofbackscatter using different polarizations. <li>Students will be able to describe the different measurements.<li>Students will be able to see the different measurements on the computer.</ol><p>  With the capability to use different polarizations on transmit andreceive, we can measure the normalized radar cross section for  combinations ofpolarizations:<p><IMG SRC="MOD2SB22.GIF"> -  Horizontal transmit, Horizontal receive <p><IMG SRC="MOD2SB23.GIF"> -  Vertical transmit, Vertical receive<p><IMG SRC="MOD2SB24.GIF"> -  Horizontal transmit, Vertical receive<p>Total power (TP) - defined as 0.25(<IMG SRC="MOD2SB25.GIF"><sup></sup>+ 2<IMG SRC="MOD2SB26.GIF">+ <IMG SRC="MOD2SB27.GIF">)<p><IMG SRC="MOD2SB28.GIF">-  Phase difference between the HH and VV<p>    measurements<p><IMG SRC="MOD2SB29.GIF"> -  Correlation between HH and VV measurements<p>When we transmit a radar pulse and look at the reflected echo, we can measurethe phase of the return as well as its amplitude. The phase is related to thetime it takes for the pulse to go out and back. Every time the pulse travels adistance of one wavelength, the phase changes by 2<IMG SRC="MOD2SB30.GIF">(look at a sine wave to see this for yourself). In radar, the phase differencebetween the HH and VV returns is often significant, as will be seen later. Thephase difference can be thought of as a difference in round-trip time for theHH and VV returns. The phase difference, <IMG SRC="MOD2SB31.GIF">,is measured in degrees (i.e. not dB) and is therefore a number between -180 and+180 degrees. <p>Another significant parameter is the correlation coefficient, <IMG SRC="MOD2SB32.GIF">,between the HH and VV returns. It is a measure of how alike the HH and VVscatterers are, and is given as a number between 0 and 1, or as a percentage (0to 100%). <IMG SRC="MOD2SB33.GIF">= 0 means the HH and VV scatterers are completely different. <IMG SRC="MOD2SB34.GIF">= 1 means the HH and VV scatterers are the same. Values in between 0 and 1 meanthat there is a mixture of identical and different HH and VV scatterers.<p>Images of each of the different polarization measurements can be displayedusing the program <b>Sigma0</b>. This can be demonstrated with any of theradar image data (<b>Filename.stk</b> files) provided. After selecting anAIRSAR or SIR-C image for display, the various polarizations come up on a menufor selection. Once a selection has been made, and an image displayed, selectan area with the mouse. Then execute the <b>Mean and Std Dev</b> option underthe <b>Statistics</b> menu to display the mean values for the polarizationmeasurements listed above for the selected area.<p> <h2>What Changes Radar Backscatter?</h2> <h2>Objectives</h2> <ol type=1><li>Students will be able to describe how backscatter can change through theuse of a different polarization, wavelength, time of observation or observationangle.<li>Students will be able to explain two advantages to using radar inmonitoring change over time on the earth.  For example deforestation and urbangrowth.<li>Students will be able to give an example of  what a long wavelength wouldbe sensitive to.  For example a tree trunk.</ol><p>Backscatter can change if we use a different polarization, wavelength, time ofobservation, or observation angle. Different polarizations can often be used todistinguish between different types of scattering, as will be seen later. Forexample, smooth surfaces, rough surfaces and vegetation layers all givedifferent signatures if the various polarizations are examined. Using differentwavelengths can often give sensitivity to different sizes of structure. Forexample, when looking at a forest, the radar cross section at shorterwavelengths, e.g. C-band (6cm), would be sensitive to the leaves at the top ofthe canopy. Longer wavelengths, e.g. L-band (24cm), would be sensitive to thebranches, and very long wavelengths, e.g. P-band (68cm), would be sensitive tothe trunks of the trees. <p>Because radar sensors can always acquire an image, independent of cloud coveror  whether it is day or night, they are very useful in monitoring change overtime. When looking at the earth's surface, radar images are sensitive tochanges in structure and in water content. For example, changes in ocean wavedirection, crop growth,  harvesting, deforestation, leaf state (on or off), areall structural changes that have been noted in radar images. Urban growthshould also be very easy to detect in radar images. Frozen versus thawed trees,dry versus wet vegetation, dry versus wet snow and dry versus wet soil are allexamples of moisture content changes that have been observed in radar images.<p><h2>Different Observation Angles</h2>  Radar backscatter can also change with observation angle. There are twoangles to consider. The first is the track angle (angle of radar track comparedto True North), which is shown below:<p>i)  Track Angle<IMG SRC="MOD2SB35.GIF"><p>Man-made features, such as urban areas and fences, terrain with significantheight variation, crops with strong row directions, ocean waves all demonstratestrong dependence on track angle in their radar backscatter behavior. Naturalvegetation in relatively flat areas does not, since it tends to grow equally inall directions.<p>The second angle is the incidence angle (angle of radar wave at earth'ssurface, compared with local vertical). Most types of scatterers showsignificant variation in backscatter versus incidence angle. If the radar ispointing in a direction at right angles to the surface (e.g. straight down fora flat surface, with <IMG SRC="MOD2SB36.GIF">i= 0), the backscatter will be very strong. As the incidence angle <IMG SRC="MOD2SB39.GIF">increases, generally the backscatter will decrease.<p>ii)  Incidence Angle<IMG SRC="MOD2SB38.GIF"><p>Note that by Pythagoras cos(<IMG SRC="MOD2SB39.GIF">)= h / R, where h is the height of the spacecraft and R is the distance from theradar to the object (the <i>range</i> ) .<p><h2>Radar Shadow and Layover</h2> An imaging radar sensor illuminates the ground as it flies over it from acertain direction. In areas of significant relief, such as mountainous regions,some parts of the ground may be in shadow, since the illumination of the radarbeam is blocked by mountains or hills. This is illustrated below.<p><IMG SRC="MOD2SB40.GIF"><p>Another problem which occurs commonly in radar images is layover, which causesmountains to appear as if they have 'fallen over'. This phenomenon occursbecause imaging radar sensors measure how far away a scatterer is from theradar, then map the results onto some nominal ground plane. Thus, the top of amountain may be closer to the radar than the bottom, and will appear nearer tothe radar in the final image. Often the side of the mountain facing the radarwill give very high backscatter, because of the low incidence angle. This isalso illustrated in the graphic above. Radar shadow and layover are visible inmany radar images: an example is the SEASAT radar image of Los Angeles seen inLASEASAT.pic from Module 2. With a little practice, it becomes easy torecognize mountainous areas in radar images from the characteristic brightleading edge of the layover and dark shadows.<p><h2>How Do Scientists Use Imaging Radar Data?</h2><h2>Objectives</h2> <ol type=1><li>Students will be able to explain how radar backscatter can be used todescribe a surface.<li>Students will be able to explain why images appear dark or light.<li>Students will be introduced to how scientists interpret the measurementsof the surface being imaged.</ol><p>Imaging radars operate by transmitting a series of radar pulses, thenmeasuring the strength of the returned echo. They measure radar backscatter,which can be thought of as the amount of pulse energy reflected back towardsthe radar by an object. A  radar image, then, is a two-dimensionalrepresentation of the radar backscatter of the surface being imaged. Thequestion is, how to interpret the measurements?<p>Radar backscatter is primarily a function of the physical structure of thesurface being imaged.  This means that backscatter changes as the surfacetopography (relief) and roughness vary across the target area.  Radarbackscatter is also sensitive to the electrical properties of the targetarea.<p><h3>Surface Roughness</h3>A useful rule-of-thumb in analyzing radar images is that the higher orbrighter the backscatter on the image, the rougher the surface being imaged.Surfaces inclined towards the radar will have a stronger backscatter thansurfaces which slope away from the radar, e.g.<p><IMG SRC="MOD2SB41.GIF"><p>If a radar is pointing almost straight down towards the target surface then itwill reflect strongly because more surface area will be "EXPOSED" to the radarbeam and the backscatter will be high.  Man-made objects, such a bridges,buildings and fences can appear very bright in a radar image when viewed fromthe correct angle.<p><h3>Surface Electrical Properties</h3>On earth, the electrical properties of a surface are often a strong functionof the liquid water content of the surface materials.  In general, backscatterstrength increases with the moisture content of the surface material.  Theexception to this is bodies of water such as rivers, lakes, and oceans which,if the surface is very smooth, give very low backscatter.  Only if the watersurface is disturbed due to surface winds or waves will the backscatter behigh.  Vegetation contains a great deal of liquid water and often havecomplicated geometrical structure -- think of the "PATTERNS" formed by trunks,branches and leaves.  As a result, vegetation will usually give higherbackscatter than the surrounding soil.  Of all vegetation types, forests tendto give the highest backscatter, with flooded forests, such as swamps, givingeven higher values.<p>Radar waves will penetrate very dry surfaces, such as the sands of the SaharaDesert, to give us a glimpse of the underlying rocks or buried river channels<p><h2>Backscatter In Radar Images</h2><h2>Objectives</h2> <ol type=1><li>Students will be able to list two examples of four classifications ofbackscatter.<li>Students will be able to give the approximate dB range for each group.</ol><p>Here is a summary, indicating potential explanations for high and lowbackscatter in a radar image:<p><center><table border=1 cellpadding=10><tr align=center><th>        Backscatter range</th><th>   Possible Explanation</th></tr><tr align=left valign=top>       <td>Very high backscatter<br>          (above -5dB)       </td>       <td>       <ul type=circle>                                  <li> Terrain slopes towards radar                                  <li> Radar looking almost straight down                                  <li> Very rough surface                                  <li> Flooded forest                                  <li> Man-made objects       </ul>       </td></tr><tr align=left valign=top>       <td>High backscatter<br>          (-10 to 0dB)       </td>       <td>       <ul type=circle>                                  <li> Rough surface                                  <li> Dense vegetation, e.g. forest       </ul>       </td></tr><tr align=left valign=top>       <td>Moderate backscatter<br>          (-20 to -10dB)       </td>       <td>       <ul type=circle>                                 <li> Moderately rough surface                                 <li> Medium level of vegetation, e.g.                                      shrubs, agricultural crops       </ul>       </td></tr><tr align=left valign=top>       <td>Low backscatter<br>          (below -20dB)       </td>       <td>       <ul type=circle>                                  <li> Terrain slopes away from radar                                   <li> Smooth surface, e.g. water, road                                      surface                                  <li> Very dry material, e.g. sand in an                                      arid desert       </ul>       </td></tr></table></center><p>These are, of course, just rules-of-thumb, to which many exceptions arepossible and have been found by scientists analyzing radar image data. There isoften considerable overlap between the backscatter ranges, so it might bedifficult to differentiate between forest and shrubs, using backscatteralone.<p><h2>Hint for the Classroom</h2> Later on, you can use this sheet to compare against Statistics obtained using<b>Sigma0</b>.<p><table border=7 cellpadding=5>   <tr>   <td>      <a href="../CONTENTS.HTM">Teacher's Guide - Table of Contents      </a>   </td>   </tr></table><p><font size=1><i>Converted to the IBM-PC by Al Wong, al.wong@jpl.nasa.gov<br><br>Jet Propulsion Laboratory<br>4800 Oak Grove Drive<br>Pasadena, CA 91109<br></i></font></body></html>

This image is upside down when compared with the <b>Mosaicim.gif</b>image but was collected at the same time (April 1990) by the NASA/JPL AIRSARimaging radar system. The radar was flying parallel to the top of the image andlooking down and out to the left (i.e. down the page). <p><IMG SRC="MOD4SEA3.GIF"><p><a href="../../../../DATA/MODS1TO5/MODULE04/IMAGES/BELIZE/BELIZKEY.GIF">Belizkey.gif (8K GIF)</a>- key to the radar image shown in <b>Lbandful.gif</b>. Thisschematic diagram, drawn to the same scale as the radar image, shows the sizeof the area covered (12.3kmx12.6km) and identifies some features seen in theradar image. Most of the image frame contains broadleaf upland forest, ortropical rain forest. At the top left is a small triangular shaped patch of atype of stunted forest, known as Bajo, which grows on poorly drained claysoils. The Bajo is separated from the upland forest by an escarpment, whichrises about 100 feet. The most interesting feature in the image is a ranchknown as Gallon Jug in the center right of the image, which was settled inabout 1985, and contains: farmland (for raising corn and cattle); bare soilfields (just recently plowed); an area of regrowth, where the soil was too poorto support agriculture and the rancher is allowing the forest to grow backagain; a recently bulldozed clear-cut, with trees still lying scattered on theground; and a small coffee plantation. The coffee plantation was an area in theupland forest where the understory and middle canopy vegetation had beencleared, leaving only large trees.  Although some coffee bushes had beenplanted, the forest floor was generally open. Also shown in the key is a localvillage where the ranch hands live, and two small lakes: Laguna Verde (greenlagoon) and Laguna Seca (dry lagoon). Following the path of a small stream is apatch of flooded forest and marshland. Several dirt roads or tracks areindicated on the key as well.<p><IMG SRC="MOD4SA4.GIF"><p><a href="../../../../DATA/MODS1TO5/MODULE04/IMAGES/BELIZE/VEGMPBYT.GIF">VegmpByt.gif (16K GIF)</a>- vegetation map of the Gallon jug area generatedautomatically from the AIRSAR data, using all three frequencies and all thedifferent polarizations. <p><IMG SRC="MOD4SA5.GIF"><p>Comparing the vegetation map with the key shown in <b>Belizkey.gif</b> youshould be able to see the following:<p><ol><li>The area of farmland is classified as low vegetation (light green).<li>The area of bare soil is classified as no vegetation (blue).<li>Most of the upland forest is classified as forest (bright green and    yellow).<li>The area of regrowth is classified as medium vegetation (dark green).<li>The Laguna Verde is classified as no vegetation (blue).<li>The Laguna Seca has patches of no vegetation (which may be open water),    medium vegetation (D), and low vegetation (D).

The image. whichwas drawn by a botanist, shows trees and shrubs seen along the walk.<p><IMG SRC="MOD4SA7.GIF"><p><b>LBandRed.STK</b> - LBand AIRSAR image data file containing allpolarizations. To display this image, run the <b>Sigma0</b> application, select the <b>LBandRed.STK</b> file andthen select the <b>Open Cmprsd Stokes</b> option under the<b>File</b> menu. Select the HV polarization for display. <p>Now point to a patch of upland forest with the mouse. The HV backscatter, seenin the bottom left hand corner of the image window, should be in the region of-14.0 dB, give or take a few dB. Pointing to  a patch of farmland, thebackscatter value will change to around -23.0 dB. Thus we can tell thedifference between forest and farmland by looking at the L-Band HVbackscatter.<p>Next, draw a rectangle on the image within the upland forest by holding downthe mouse while dragging, then release. Choose the <b>Mean and Std Dev</b>option under the <b>Statistics</b> menu and a set  of numbers will appear inthe Statistics window. The mean values corresponding to the selected rectangleunder the Mean column should match closely the following numbers:<p><center><table width=30% cellpadding=5 border=1><tr><td>HH</td> <td>-9.0 dB</td></tr><tr><td>HV</td> <td>-14.0 dB</td></tr><tr><td>VV</td> <td>-9.0 dB</td></tr><tr><td>HHVV* phase</td> <td>0.0 deg</td></tr><tr><td>Corr coef</td> <td>0.29</td></tr></table></center><p>These values correspond closely to the model for scattering from a vegetationlayer, since HH and VV are equal, HV is 5.0 dB less than both, the phasedifference between HH and VV is 0 degrees, and the HH-VV correlationcoefficient is close to one-third.<p>Close the HV image, and then display the HH image by using the <b>Open CmprsdStokes</b> option again and selecting the <b>LBandRed.STK </b>file. Notice thatthe coffee plantation, the clear-cut and the flooded area are now significantlybrighter than the surrounding upland forest. Pointing the mouse at any of thesestandout areas should reveal an HH backscatter of around -7 dB, 2 dB higherthan the upland forest. Now select a rectangle around the coffee plantation andexecute the <b>Zoom In</b> option under the <b>View</b> menu five times. Nowuse the <b>Display Sigma Zeros</b> option under the <b>View</b> menu to writethe backscatter values in dB over each pixel. You should see that thebackscatter values in the coffee plantation are indeed a couple of dB higherthan the nearby upland forest.<p><table border=7 cellpadding=5>   <tr>   <td>      <a href="../CONTENTS.HTM">Teacher's Guide - Table of Contents      </a>   </td>   </tr></table><p><font size=1><i>Converted to the IBM-PC by Al Wong, al.wong@jpl.nasa.gov<br><br>Jet Propulsion Laboratory<br>4800 Oak Grove Drive<br>Pasadena, CA 91109<br></i></font></body></html>

The files you will needare in this directory are<b>GalOptic.gif</b>, <b>GalInfra.gif </b>and<b> AndesVIR.gif</b><p><h2>Looking At An Object From A Distance</h2>Remote Sensing means "LOOKING AT AN OBJECT FROM A DISTANCE" and can be appliedto any attempt to observe interesting phenomena from afar. Thus an astronomer,looking at the constellation of Orion through a telescope, or a bird-watcherobserving a rare swallow or eagle through a pair of binoculars, could both besaid to use "REMOTE SENSING". In the scientific community, remote sensing hascome to mean observing the earth (or other planets in the solar system) usinginstruments which measure reflected electromagnetic radiation. In the 1990's,this means using sophisticated cameras and radars mounted on high-flyingaircraft or orbiting spacecraft to form pictures or images of the earth as seenat different wavelengths of reflected electromagnetic radiation, (i.e. light).These images are then used to aid our understanding of the physical processeswhich can affect the earth's atmosphere or it's surface.<p><h2>History - From Pigeons To Satellites</h2>An early example of a remote sensing tool is the telescope, mentioned above,which was used by navigators to spot land while at sea, as well as forobserving the stars and planets. Until the hot-air balloon was invented, ourancestors had no means of observing the earth from up above, other than byclimbing a high mountain and looking down.  During the nineteenth century, theneed for long-range observations of enemy positions for artillery targetingproduced some interesting experiments in remote sensing. An example was aFrench experiment to obtain long-range  photographs by strapping a camera to a(presumably well-developed) pigeon. During the American Civil War, balloonswere hoisted aloft during several battles to observe the disposition of enemytroops and direct artillery fire on them through signaling (using semaphore).Unfortunately for the balloonists, this improvement in military technologyarrived on the scene at the same time as the rifle, which allowed sharpshooterson the ground to use them for target practice.<p>During the First World War, airplanes were introduced in support of artillery,in the role formerly played  by pigeons and balloons. In the early stages ofthe war, unarmed observation planes would take off with a camera strapped tothe undercarriage, to take pictures of the trenches and troop movements of theenemy. When someone figured out how to strap a machine gun onto an aircraft,the era of the fighter and the Red Baron was born. The initial objective of thefighter plane was thus to shoot down the observation planes which carriedremote sensing equipment.<p>After the First World War had ended, and aircraft began to be produced forcivilian use, it was realized that pictures taken from cameras mounted onaircraft could be used to produce highly detailed, accurate maps. Most of ourmodern maps are generated in this way. Prior to that, maps were produced bysurvey teams on the ground, in a similar fashion to the maps produced by theLewis and Clark Expedition in North America or by Stanley and Livingstone inCentral Africa. <p>As technology progressed, cameras improved, infra-red and ultra-violet filmswere developed, and other types of sensors, such as radar and X-rayinstruments, added to the range of the electromagnetic spectrum which could beused in remote sensing. With the dawn of the space age, it became possible to place remote sensing instruments on orbiting satellites, andto look down on all the corners of the earth, even the most remote locations.The development of satellite remote sensing technology also coincided with thedawn of the missile era. Thus, the first remote sensing satellites were used bythe USA and the Soviet Union to target or at least identify each others'long-range ballistic missile sites. The U-2 spy plane, whose revealing picturesgave the first indications to President Kennedy that the Soviet Union hadinstalled missiles in Cuba, was a further example of the military use of remotesensing. <p>As often happens with new technological developments, initial exploitation bythe military is followed by scientific utilization, then commercial use. A goodexample in remote sensing is the case of weather satellites, which wereinitially developed to determine weather conditions over sites of militarysignificance, then the data from these satellites was used by scientistsstudying the Earth's atmosphere. Nowadays, no TV news broadcast  would becomplete without the sight of the weather 'expert' waving his or her arms aboutover a picture of clouds or storm systems provided by a weather satellite.  <p>In the 1970's, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)launched the first in a series of civilian remote sensing satellites <p>called LANDSAT. LANDSAT provided scientists and cartographers withunprecedented access to remote sensing images of the Earth from space. Mapscould be reliably drawn for areas of the world which were previouslyinaccessible, geologic surveys could be conducted from an office desk, andvegetation cover could be mapped over large portions of the Earth's landsurface. <p>In the 1990's, NASA plans to launch a series of Earth Observing Satellite(EOS) as part of the Mission to Planet Earth. The remote sensing instrumentscarried by these satellites will revolutionize scientists' understanding of theEarth as a global system, including the atmosphere, oceans and land. Otherremote satellites have already been launched or planned by nations such asRussia, Japan, Canada and the countries of the European Economic Community.Radars which can image the Earth's surface, such as NASA/JPL's SpaceborneImaging Radar-C (known as SIR-C for short) are a key part of these programs. <p><h2>What Do Scientists Use Remote Sensing Data For?</h2>Take a look at the picture of the Earth below. The image was collected by asatellite at a very high altitude, so that one side of the whole Earth isvisible. On this scale, it is possible to see only large-scale features, suchas the continents, the oceans and clouds in the atmosphere. <p><IMG SRC="MOD1SEC2.GIF"> <p>When scientists look at remotely sensed images of the Earth, they areinterested in different aspects of the large-scale features visible in theimage above: the land, the oceans and ice, and the atmosphere. Scientific useof remote sensing data can be divided up into these areas of interest, i.e.,<p><ul type=circle><li>Land Studies (e.g. geology, agriculture, land management)<li>Ocean Studies (e.g. oceanography, ice studies)<li>Atmospheric Studies (e.g. meteorology)</ul><p>Within each area of interest, there are many measurements which can be madeusing remote sensing. Examples are given on the next page. It is only recentlythat scientists from the different disciplines have got together  toincorporate their results and insights into the first attempts at anunderstanding of the Earth as a global system. For example, a scientiststudying the Antarctic ice sheet (a land study) might make use ofmeteorological data (from an atmospheric study) to estimate the annual snowfallrate over the continent. Combining these data with measurements of seasonal icesurface temperature, obtained from a remote sensing satellite, the scientistcould then produce a model which would be used to estimate the rate of increaseor decrease in the ice sheet thickness over the continent. This data could thenbe used by an oceanographer to estimate the rise or fall in sea level whichwould occur if the ice sheet thickness model were correct. <p>More recently, scientists have developed models of the Earth as a completesystem, including land, ocean and atmosphere. Remote sensing measurements areused as inputs to these models. The models are used to predict the consequencesand estimate the likely causes of global warming, or an increase in the size ofthe hole in the ozone layer which has been observed over the polar regions.<p><h2>Scale</h2>The scale of the features to be measured  governs the scale of the remotesensing data required. For example, looking at vegetation cover over acontinent can be done at very coarse scale (e.g. a grid with points every 1kilometer). Mapping vegetation type in California's Central valley wouldrequire a finer scale (e.g. a grid with points every 30 meters).<p><h2>Measurements Derived From Remote Sensing By Scientists:</h2><ol>   <li>Land Studies<p>   <ul>   <li>Vegetation cover (type, seasonal variation, effects of drought,       deforestation)   <li>Surface roughness and moisture content   <li>Hydrology (watersheds, runoff rates, snow and ice cover)   <li>Geology (fault lines, earthquake damage, volcanoes, oil,        gas and mineral exploration)   <li>Cartography (producing maps of topography, land cover type)   <li>Disaster monitoring   </ul>   <p>   <li> Ocean Studies<p>   <ul>   <li>Monitoring ocean currents (e.g. Gulf stream)   <li>Wind speed and direction at the ocean surface   <li>Wave height and direction of travel   <li>Ocean surface temperature   <li>Presence of plankton   <li>Extent and nature of polar ice caps   </ul>   <p>   <li>Atmospheric Studies<p>   <ul>   <li>Rainfall   <li>Extent and thickness of cloud cover   <li>Hurricane and tropical storm monitoring   <li>Wind speeds and directions   <li>Atmospheric temperature   <li>Atmospheric Chemistry (aerosols, ozone, volcanic dust, etc.)   </ul></ol><p><h2>Images</h2>Students will do an exercise where they are introduced to the use ofdigital numbers (<b>DN</b>s) and X,Y coordinates as seen in the Values table.The <b>DN</b>s indicate gray scale values from 0 to 256, and range in shadefrom white to black. They will looks at various shades of gray and then turntheir gray scale images into false color images, also ranging from 0 to 256.<p>Students will then return to the images reviewed in Section B and check theimages for gray scale values.  They will then display an image of the Andestaken using both visible and infrared wavelengths and see what a three color,"FALSE COLOR" image looks like. The image the students will display is a falsecolor mosaic of the central  part of the Andes mountains of South America(70<sup>o</sup>W, 19<sup>o</sup>S).  It is made up of 42 images taken by theGalileo spacecraft from an altitude of about 25,000 kilometers.  Thecombination of visible and near infrared filters (green, 0.76 micron, and 1.0micron) was chosen for this image to separate regions with distinct vegetationand soil types.   <p>The mosaic shows the area where Chile, Peru, and Bolivia meet.  Lakes Titicacaand Poopo can be seen as nearly black patches from top to bottom; a large lightblue area below and left of Lake Poopo is Salar de Uyuni, a dry salt lake some120 kilometers  across.  These lakes lie in the Altiplano, a region between thewestern and eastern Andes, which is covered by clouds.  The water/ice contentof the clouds is indicated by their shade of pink   The vegetated Gran Chacoplains east of the Andes are pale green (right of image).  Light blue patchesin the mountains to the north  are glaciers.  <p><table border=7 cellpadding=5>   <tr>   <td>      <a href="../CONTENTS.HTM">Teacher's Guide - Table of Contents      </a>   </td>   </tr></table><p><font size=1><i>Converted to the IBM-PC by Al Wong, al.wong@jpl.nasa.gov<br><br>Jet Propulsion Laboratory<br>4800 Oak Grove Drive<br>Pasadena, CA 91109<br></i></font></body></html>

SIR-C/X-SAR is an imaging radar system  launched aboard the SpaceShuttle in April and October, 1994. It consists of a radar antenna structureand associated radar system hardware that is designed to fit inside the SpaceShuttle's cargo bay. On take-off, the cargo bay doors are closed as seen in thegraphic on the next page. After the Space Shuttle has reached a stable Earthorbit, the cargo bay doors opened and SIR-C/X-SAR was turned on, to begin usingits state-of-the-art radar technology to image the earth's surface. <p>Radar images generated by SIR-C/X-SAR are used by scientists to help understandsome of the processes which affect the earth's environment, such asdeforestation in the Amazon, desertification south of the Sahara, and soilmoisture retention in the Mid-West.<p><h2>Deploying SIR-C </h2><IMG SRC="MOD3SA2.GIF"><p>Space Shuttle doors closed during launch<p><IMG SRC="MOD3SA3.GIF"><p>Space Shuttle doors open, showing SIR-C/X-SAR  antenna<p>The radar antenna is placed into the payload bay making an angle of 40 degreesto the nadir.  Nadir is the area on the earth directly below the shuttle.<p><IMG SRC="MOD3SA4.GIF"><p><h2>The SIR-C/X-SAR Project</h2>SIR-C/X-SAR is a joint project of the National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration (NASA), the German Space Agency (DARA) and the Italian SpaceAgency (ASI). It is the next step in a series of spaceborne imaging radars,that began with SEASAT in 1978, continued with SIR-A (1981), Germany'sMicrowave Remote Sensing Experiment (1983), and SIR-B (1984). SIR-C/X-SAR wasplanned as a precursor to the Earth Observing System (EOS) imaging radar systemwhich is planned for the end of the decade. <p><h2>Science Objectives</h2>SIR-C/X-SAR's unique contributions to Earth observation and monitoring are itscapability to measure, from space, the radar signature of the surface at threedifferent wavelengths, and to make measurements for different polarizations attwo of those wavelengths (L-band and C-band). SIR-C image data help scientistsunderstand the physics behind some of the phenomena seen in radar images atjust one wavelength/polarization, such as those produced by SEASAT.Investigators on the SIR-C/X-SAR Science team use the radar image data fromSIR-C/X-SAR to make measurements of the following:<p><ul type=circle><li>Vegetation type, extent and deforestation<li>Soil moisture content<li>Ocean dynamics, wave and surface wind speeds and directions<li>Volcanism and tectonic activity<li>Soil erosion and desertification</ul><p><h2>SIR-C/X-SAR Instrument Description</h2>The SIR-C/X-SAR antenna structure actually consists of three individualantennas, one operating at L-band (23.5cm wavelength), one at C-band (5.8cmwavelength) and the third at X-band (3cm wavelength). The L-band and C-bandantennas are constructed from separate panels that can measure both horizontaland vertical polarizations.<p><IMG SRC="MOD3SA5.GIF"><p>The SIR-C/X-SAR antenna is the most massive piece of hardware (at a total of10,500 kilograms) ever assembled at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), andmeasures 12 meters by 4 meters. The SIR-C instrument was built by JPL and theBall Communication Systems Division for NASA and provides the L-band and C-bandmeasurements at different polarizations. The L-band and C-band antennas employphased array technology, which allows the antenna beam pointing to be adjustedelectronically. The X-SAR  instrument is built by the Dornier and Alenia Spaziocompanies for DARA and ASI and operates at a single frequency, X-band. TheX-SAR antenna is a slotted waveguide type, which uses a mechanical tilt tochange the beam pointing direction. <p><h2>SIR-C/X-SAR Image Data</h2>During each 11-day Shuttle flight, SIR-C/X-SAR imaged an area of roughly 50million square kilometers of the Earth's surface. The peak data rate was 225megabits (or 225,000,000 bits) per second. The data collected was processedinto images with resolution selectable from 10 to 200 meters. The width of thearea mapped out by the radar varied from 15 to 90 kilometers, depending on howthe radar is operated, and the direction in which the antenna beams arepointing. Data from SIR-C/X-SAR will be used to develop automatic techniquesfor extracting information from radar image data, in preparation for the EOSSAR mission later in the decade.<p><IMG SRC="MOD3SA6.GIF"><p>This schematic diagram shows the SIR-C/X-SAR antennas illuminating an area onthe ground, and mapping out a swath as the Shuttle moves forward. The areashown is a SEASAT image of Los Angeles, California. North is to the right ofthe image shown.<p><h2>More About SIR-C/X-SAR</h2>The Shuttle Imaging Radar-C and X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR)is a cooperative experiment between the National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration (NASA), the German Space Agency (DARA), and the Italian SpaceAgency (ASI).  The experiment is the next step forward in NASA's SpaceborneImaging Radar (SIR) program that began with the Seasat Synthetic Aperture Radar(SAR) in 1978, and continued with SIR-A in 1981 and SIR-B in 1984.  The programalso benefits from experience gained with the Magellan Mission to Venus, otherinternational spaceborne radar programs (e.g. ERS-1, JERS-1), and aircraftsensors such as the JPL Airborne SAR (AIRSAR).<p>SIR-C provides increased capability over SEASAT, SIR-A, and SIR-B by acquiringdigital images simultaneously at two microwave wavelengths (<IMG SRC="MOD3SA7.GIF">):L- band (<IMG SRC="MOD3SA8.GIF">= 23.5 cm) and C-band (<IMG SRC="MOD3SA9.GIF">= 5.8 cm).  These vertically- and horizontally-polarized transmitted waves arereceived on two separate channels, so that SIR-C provided information on radarbackscatter for four polarization combinations: HH (Horizontally-transmitted,Horizontally-received), VV (Vertically-transmitted, Vertically-received), HV,and VH; and also data on the relative phase difference between the HH, VV, VH,and HV returns.  This information allows derivation of the complete scatteringmatrix of a scene on a pixel by pixel basis.  From this scattering matrix,every polarization configuration (linear, circular or elliptical) can begenerated during ground processing.  The radar polarimetric data yields moredetailed information about the surface geometric structure, vegetation cover,and subsurface discontinuities than image brightness alone.<p>Germany's imaging radar program started with the Microwave Remote SensingExperiment (MRSE) flown aboard the Shuttle in 1983.  This X-band radar wasflown on the first SPACELAB mission.  The program  continued with thedevelopment of the X-SAR instrument in cooperation with Italy.  X-SAR, operatesat X-band (<IMG SRC="MOD3SA10.GIF">= 3.1 cm) with VV polarization, resulting in a three-frequency capability forthe total SIR-C/X-SAR system.  Because radar backscatter is most stronglyinfluenced by objects comparable in size to the radar wavelength, thismultifrequency capability will provide information about the Earth's surfaceover a wide range of scales not discernible with previous single-wavelengthexperiments.<p><h2>SIR-C/X-SAR Instrumentation</h2>The SIR-C instrument is composed of several subsystems: the antenna array, thetransmitter, the receivers, the data-handling subsystem, and the ground SARprocessor.  The antenna is composed of two planar arrays, one for L-band andone for C-band.  Each array is composed of a uniform grid of dual-polarizedmicrostrip antenna radiators, with each polarization port fed by a separatecorporate feed network.  The overall size of the SIR-C antenna is 12.0 x 3.7meters and consists of three leaves each divided into four subpanels. <p><h2>Model of the SIR-C/X-SAR antenna</h2><IMG SRC="MOD3SA11.GIF"><p>Unlike previous SIR instruments, the SIR-C radar beam is formed from hundredsof small low power solid state transmitters embedded in the surface of theradar antenna.  By properly phasing the energy from these transmitters, thebeam can be electronically steered in the range direction +/-23deg. from thenominal 40deg. off nadir position without physically moving the large radarantenna.  This feature will enable images to be acquired over a wide range ofincidence angles.  <p>X-SAR provides VV polarization images using a passive slotted waveguideantenna measuring 12.0 x 0.4 meters.  Other X-SAR components include atraveling wave tube as transmitter, an exciter, receiver, and data handlingsubsystem.  A mechanical  tilt mechanism will point the X-SAR antenna to anglesbetween 15 and 60deg., in the same direction as the L-band and C-band beams.<p>SIR-C and X-SAR can be operated as either stand alone radars or together.Roll and yaw maneuvers of the shuttle will allow data to be acquired on eitherside of the shuttle nadir (ground) track.  The width of the imaged swath on theground varies from 15 to 90 kilometers (9 to 56 miles) depending on theorientation of the antenna beams and the operational mode. Table 1 presents asummary of the SIR-C/X-SAR system characteristics.<p><h2>Table 1:  SIR-C/X-SAR System Characteristics</h2><pre>PARAMETER          L-BAND               C-BAND             X-BANDWavelength         0.235 m             0.058 m            0.031 mSwath Width      15 to 90 km          15 to 90 km       15 to 40 kmPulse Length  33.8, 16.9, 8.5 us   33.8, 16.9, 8.5 us    40 usData Rate        90 Mbits/s           90 Mbits/s         45 Mbits/sData Format     8,4 bits/word        8,4 bits/word      8,4 bits/word                 (8,4) BFPQ            (8,4) BFPQ        (8,4) BFPQ</pre>BFPQ = Block Floating Point Quantization, a form of data compression from 8bits per sample to 4 bits per sample.<p>SYSTEM PARAMETERS:<pre>Orbital Altitude                 225 kmResolution                       30 x 30 m on the surfaceLook Angle Range                 17 to 63 degrees from nadirBandwidth                        10 and 20 MHzPulse Repetition Rate            1395 to 1736 pulses per secondTotal Science Data               50 hours/channel/missionTotal Instrument Mass            11,000 kgDC Power Consumption             3000 to 9000 W</pre><table border=7 cellpadding=5>   <tr>   <td>      <a href="../CONTENTS.HTM">Teacher's Guide - Table of Contents      </a>   </td>   </tr></table><p><font size=1><i>Converted to the IBM-PC by Al Wong, al.wong@jpl.nasa.gov<br><br>Jet Propulsion Laboratory<br>4800 Oak Grove Drive<br>Pasadena, CA 91109<br></i></font></body></html>

The files you will needare in this directory are<b>LASEASAT.gif</b>,<b> LAZoomIn.gif </b>and<b> LASIRC.gif</b><p><h2>SEASAT</h2>Remote sensing saw a big leap forward with the arrival of SEASAT in 1978. TheSEASAT payload included an imaging radar which transmitted electromagneticwaves at 24 cm wavelength (known as L-band) with a horizontal-horizontal (HHfor short) polarization. The images produced by these impulses had a resolutionof 25 meters and a pixel size of 12.5 meters. SEASAT operated for roughly 100days beginning in July of 1978.  Its mission was to understand the physicalprocesses taking place on the ocean surface through analysis of its radarimages. These radar images gave scientists an invaluable tool for looking atthe Earth, over both ocean <i>and  </i>land. Since the radar instrument useslight generated by the instrument itself,  radar imaging can produce images atnight. Also, radar has the capacity to transmit through even the heaviest cloudcover. This is because clouds are effectively transparent to radar waves.Optical images of a planet's surface, such as those in the color  photographstaken by the Galileo spacecraft, can not be taken when an area is cloud-coveredor dark.  Because radar makes it possible for images to be taken at night, thenumber and completeness of images can be greatly augmented. Also, areas such asrain forests, which can have cloud cover up to 95% of the year, can now becharted.   <p><h2>Images</h2>Taken by SEASAT as it passed in 1978, the next image students will display isone of the Los Angeles basin.<p><IMG SRC="MOD1SED2.GIF"><p>This image of Los Angeles and its surrounding cities [<b>LASEASAT.gif</b>] wastaken from the west (left on the image). The Pacific Ocean is visible on theleft of the radar image and the San Gabriel Mountains are clearly shown in theupper right corner. An in-depth discussion of why particular aspects of thelandscape appear as dark or light is included in the next section.  Briefly,however, the more impulses returning to the radar receiver, the lighter theimage. Since the radar impulses are sent at an angle toward the earth'ssurface, flat surfaces such as streets, parking lots, and calm water reflectthe energy away from the receiver, like so:  <p><IMG SRC="MOD1SED3.GIF"><p>All of these structures generally appear as dark areas in radar images. Theangled roofs and uneven surfaces of vegetation and land surfaces tend toreflect a greater amount of energy back at the radar antenna and thus appear aslighter areas.<p>At  X,Y coordinates 350, 750 is the city of Burbank, which appears as a verylight square.  Burbank is unique in this image in that its streets are orienteddifferently from the remainder of the cities in Los Angeles. The streets arelined up in such a way that the incoming radar pulses are able to bounce offthe streets and then bounce again off the buildings (called a double-bounce)and directly back towards the radar instrument, as shown in the graphic below:<p><IMG SRC="MOD1SED4.GIF"><p>Just below  Burbank, you can see the Hollywood Hills, home of the "HOLLYWOOD"sign. These hills continue to the west, becoming the Santa Monica Mountains. Atthe foot of the San Gabriel Mountains, at X, Y coordinates 500, 720  lies theJet Propulsion Laboratory. The Palos Verdes peninsula juts out at about 120,360.  In the center of the image, you will locate Dodger stadium. The many darklines criss-crossing the image are the renowned L.A. freeway system. Therunways of the Los Angeles International Airport are also shown as two darkstrips bordering the Pacific at about 190,400 on the image. Once again, thereare no clouds present because clouds do not reflect radar impulses and are thusinvisible to radar sensors.<p>The next image of Module 1 is of Dodger Stadium [<b>LAZoomIn.gif</b>]<b> </b>and the surrounding L.A. community. In this image, students can view downtownLos Angeles in the center of the image, ringed by freeways.  Dodger stadiumsits at the top center of the image, surrounded by Elysium Park. Both thefreeways and the individual city blocks can be seen with greater resolution inthis image. The stadium itself appears darker than the surrounding areasbecause the flat surfaces of the playing field and parking lots reflect theradar impulses away from the radar receiver.  <p>The final image in Module 1 is a SIR-C image of Los Angeles, collected inOctober 1994. This is again a black-and white image of Los Angeles, taken usingthe same type of radar (same wavelength and polarization) as the one flown onSEASAT. The main difference between the two images (<b>LASEASAT.gif</b> and<b>LASIRC.gif</b>) is of course that they were taken 16 years apart, but theywere also taken at different angles. SEASAT flew in a near-polar orbit,observing Los Angeles at it flew from South to North. SIR-C flew in a differentorbit, observing Los Angeles at it flew from almost South-East to almostNorth-West. When you look at things from different directions they tend toappear different. Have one of your students face the class straight-on, then inprofile to demonstrate this concept. See what differences your students canidentify between the two radar images.<p><table border=7 cellpadding=5>   <tr>   <td>      <a href="../CONTENTS.HTM">Teacher's Guide - Table of Contents      </a>   </td>   </tr></table><p><font size=1><i>Converted to the IBM-PC by Al Wong, al.wong@jpl.nasa.gov<br><br>Jet Propulsion Laboratory<br>4800 Oak Grove Drive<br>Pasadena, CA 91109<br></i></font></body></html>

This program is called Mission to Planet Earth (MTPE).  <p><p>	NASA's Mission to Planet Earth will study how the global environment ischanging. Using the unique perspective available from space, NASA will observe,monitor and assess large-scale environmental processes, focusing on climatechange. MTPE satellite data, complemented by aircraft and data, will allow usto better understand natural environmental changes from human-induced changes.MTPE data, which NASA will distribute to researchers worldwide, is essential tohumans making informed decisions about protecting their environment.<p><h2>Science Themes</h2>The following are the underlying science themes for MTPE:<p><ol><li>Environmental processes are global in scale, complex and closelyconnected.<li>Each component of the environment -- air, water, land, biota -- iscontinually changing, and changes in one component affect the other.<li>Changes can occur naturally or as a result of human activities. Thesechanges occur on such a scale that they require long-term observation andanalysis.<li>These closely connected systems require interdisciplinary research.<li>MTPE will provide that long-term, interdisciplinary research.</ol><p><h2>Program Themes</h2><ol><li>NASA conceived and initiated MTPE because the unique global perspectiveavailable from space allows comprehensive, long-term measurements ofenvironmental processes.<li>NASA's MTPE space-based remote-sensing programs are complemented andverified by aircraft, balloon and ground-based measurements.<li>NASA's MTPE programs are distributed across the United States through NASAcenters, universities and other institutions. MTPE is a cooperative programwithin the U.S. Global Change Research Program, which involves other federalagencies with different areas of environmental expertise.<li>NASA's MTPE is an international program, involving other countries in anattempt to solve problems that recognize no national boundaries.<li>NASA's MTPE focus is information -- providing the data policy makers andnations need to make informed decisions about the global environment.</ol><p>As part of NASA's Mission to Planet Earth, JPL is investigating thebiological, chemical and physical features of Earth's atmosphere, oceans, landsurface and crust - and studying aspects of the interfaces between them. Toaddress key global problems such as ozone depletion, climate change, volcanismand tectonism, JPL scientists acquire data from remote-sensing instrumentscarried by aircraft, balloons and satellites; insights are also gained throughlaboratory experimentation, field work and theoretical modeling. While researchis becoming largely interdisciplinary in nature, JPL is building on strengthsin traditional areas of expertise, such as atmospheric chemistry, oceanography,geology and geodynamics. <p><table border=7 cellpadding=5>   <tr>   <td>      <a href="../CONTENTS.HTM">Teacher's Guide - Table of Contents      </a>   </td>   </tr></table><p><font size=1><i>Converted to the IBM-PC by Al Wong, al.wong@jpl.nasa.gov<br><br>Jet Propulsion Laboratory<br>4800 Oak Grove Drive<br>Pasadena, CA 91109<br></i></font></body></html>

The image files can be opened by using the<b>Sigma0</b> or <b>Netscape</b>, depending on the type of image. The /DATA directory contains two sub-directories:<p><ol><li>/DATA/LOCATION - Images classified by continents and oceans<li>/DATA/MODS1TO5 - Images for the lesson modules 1 to 5</ol>The directory <b>Mods1to5</b> contains all the image data files to be used inintroducing Modules 1 to 5 of the <b>SIR-CED</b> package. It is recommendedthat you copy over the data files from <b>Mods1to5 </b>for each module to yourown computer before setting up to teach a lesson using these files. You may also wantto copy the software you are going to use into this directory (e.g.<b>Sigma0</b>). <p><h2>A Hint for the Classroom</h2>Data contained in directories <b>Pre-SIRC</b> for each site should be regarded asa look at the sites to be covered by SIR-C. It was generated prior to SIR-Claunch, and therefore does not contain any SIR-C data. Data contained indirectories labeled <b>Post-SIRC</b> for each site contain radar images, hand-heldphotographs and other information obtained during the SIR-C mission and puttogether afterwards. <p>For each site, varying degrees of data were found to be available. Some siteshave radar data from the NASA/JPL AIRSAR (in the <b>Pre-SIRC</b> directories);others have radar images and shuttle hand-held photographs from the SIR-Cmissions (in the <b>Post-SIRC</b> directories); some have scanned radar images fromearlier imaging radar missions such as SEASAT or SIR-B; some have photos takenon the ground; some have digital topographic maps; some have optical orinfra-red images; most have a text file describing the aims of the SIR-Cinvestigators for the site or text files describing some of the SIR-C resultsobtained for that site. <p>In producing the files contained in this CD, we have tried to ensure that theuser can open the files without knowing the file dimensions, as much aspossible. Thus many image data files are in GIF format, which are fairlystandard (compressed) data formats which many programs can access. We have alsotried to keep file sizes down as much as possible to below 1.4Mbytes, so thatfiles can easily be copied onto a high density floppy disk for circulation. Themajor exceptions to this are most of the movie clips, which tend to be biggerthan 1.4 Mbytes, and some of the color images generated during the SIR-Cmissions.<p>The directory <b>Software</b> contains software for the PC which can beused to display and interact with the image data on the <b>CD-ROM</b> and opentext files. There are three programs in the Software directory which you may wishto install your own computer:<p><ol><li><b>Netscape</b> - Browser program. Used to read all <b>*.htm</b> files.<li><b>Quicktime Movie Player</b> - A program which plays video clips using Quicktime. Use toopen files with names ending in <b>.mov</b><li><b>Sigma0</b> - A program for display and interaction with radar images. Usedto open files with names ending in <b>.stk</b></ol><p><b>You cannot run these programs directly off the CD-ROM.</b>You must install them on your computer first. In each program directory, there is a README.TXT file that contains installation instructions. <p>With the three programs listed above you should be able to open most of thefiles contained on the CD-ROM. <p>To open a file ending with <b>.stk </b>you should use <b>Sigma0</b>.  Simplydouble click on the <b>Sigma0</b> icon and under the file menu drag down andselect Open Compressed Stokes.  Find your way to directories that contain filesthat end with <b>.stk</b>. Select that file and it will automatically open.For further information, there is an introduction in <a href="../../../../ROADMAP/REFERMAP/SOFTWARE/SIGMAUSE.HTM">How Do I Use Sigma0?</a><p><h2>File Types</h2> <h3>1)  PreSIR-C Text Files</h3>These files are all PreSIR-C files in that they were generated beforethe SIR-C missions. Most of these files originated from a Macintoshcomputer and have not been translated for the PC (yet).<p><b>DirIndex.txt</b> - text file containing an index of the files contained inthe site directory.   Data are in a Macintosh<b>Teachtext</b> format file. File can beopened using Macintosh <b>Teachtext</b> software by double-clicking on the file icon oropening using the <b>Open</b> option under the<b> FILE</b> menu in<b>Teachtext</b>. The <b>Teachtext </b>software application can be found in the<b>Software</b> directory on the SIR-CED CD-ROM. <b>Teachtext </b>files can alsobe opened by many other types of word processing programs, such as <b>MicrosoftWord</b>, <b>WordPerfect</b> and <b>MacWrite Pro</b>. All of these programs aredistributed by commercial vendors and can not be found on the SIR-CED CD-ROM.<p><b>SiteWord.txt</b> - text file describing the site in the carefully chosenwords of the SIR-C investigators.

The files you will needare:<p><ul type=circle><li>XBand.gif<li>CBand.gif<li>LBand.gif<li>ColorLCX.gif<li>LBandHH.gif<li>LBandHV.gif<li>LBandVV.gif<li>ColorL.gif<li>ColorLLC.gif</ul> <p><h2>Combining Images from Different Radar Wavelengths</h2> A radar image is fundamentally different from what your eye would see. Here weexamine those differences further.<p>Let's say that you are flying on an airplane between Philadelphia andPittsburgh. You look out the window and see the West Branch River joining upwith the Susquehanna River near Sunbury, Pennsylvania. Some of the diffusescattered light from the Sun reflects off the ground and enters the pupil ofyour eye. Light from the Sun contains all the colors of the rainbow, anddifferent objects on the ground absorb and reflect the different colors oflight. Your eyes  tell your brain what they saw, and your brain figures outthat the rivers look blue and the trees look green. <p>Your camera does the same thing. When you take a picture with your camera, thecamera shutter opens briefly, exposing the film to this reflected light. Thenyou take the film to be processed, and when you get the pictures back, thepicture looks very similar to what your eyes saw. Now let's suppose thatinstead of a camera you have an imaging radar like SIR-C/X-SAR, which usesdifferent wavelengths to observe the Earth. You are the envy of everyone on theairplane (and you have probably exceeded your baggage allowance). <p>As we have seen earlier, because radar operates at radio wavelengths, thepicture you will take is a kind of "FLASH" picture.  The radar will illuminatethe ground with radio waves. The radio waves reflect off the ground, and someof the radio waves will be reflected back to the radar where it will record theresult (like the film in your camera). If you have a single-wavelength imagingradar, you can visualize the radar image as a black and white image, where thewhiter the image the brighter the radio reflection from the ground. But if youhave a multi-wavelength or multi-polarization radar, you can make a colorpicture.<p>Unlike a camera which can take a picture of the entire spectrum of therainbow, imaging radars have discrete wavelengths of radio waves that they cantransmit. If your radar is a three wavelength radar like SIR-C/X-SAR, then itis like a camera that can only capture three colors of the rainbow. But withthree colors, we can still make a color picture, by assigning different colorsto different radio wavelengths. This is significant because the brightness ofthe ground typically changes with wavelength.  This is just like what happensat visible wavelengths.  A tree is bright at the green colors (wavelengths),and not as bright at the other colors, therefore the tree appears green.<p>A color image can be constructed by assigning just three colors (red, green,and blue). Therefore, in making a color image from a three wavelength radar, wecould assign one wavelength band to be red, one wavelength band to be green,and the third wavelength band to be blue.  The assignment of these colors iscompletely arbitrary, as radio waves don't have a "COLOR". However, by makingsome kind of assignment, we can visualize the radar image. The brightness ofeach color will depend on the brightness of the radar image for thatwavelength.  <p>For instance, say we are flying on the space shuttle over Sunbury Pennsylvaniaand you turn on the SIR-C imaging radar. Here are three black and white imagescorresponding to the three wavelengths of the SIR-C radar.  They look like this:<p>"X-BAND"<p><IMG SRC="MOD2SED2.GIF"><p>"C-BAND"<p><IMG SRC="MOD2SED3.GIF"><p>"L-BAND"<p><IMG SRC="MOD2SED4.GIF"><p>As you can see, there are subtle differences between these images.  Forexample, the "L-BAND" image has more variation in gray than the "X-BAND" and"C-BAND" images. The reason for this is that lots of different types of terrainappear rough on the scale of the X-band and C-band wavelengths (3 cm and 6cm).So, apart from the smooth river, which appears dark at all three wavelengths,most of the variation in the X-band and C-band images is due to changes inslope on the ridges of the Appalachians, which run through this area ofPennsylvania. If the terrain slope towards the radar, the backscatter tends toincrease; if it slopes away from the radar, the backscatter tends to decrease.At L-Band, the agricultural fields in the valleys are smoother than the treeson the forested ridges, so we see some contrast between the tree-covered ridges(which are light gray) and the valleys, which appear darker.<p>Now, if we assign the red color to the "L-BAND" image, the green color to the"C-BAND" image, and the blue color to the "X-BAND" image, we get the followingcolor image when we combine them:<p><IMG SRC="MOD2SD5.GIF"><p>As can be seen from this color image (<b>ColorLCX.gif</b>), there are significant differences in the "BRIGHTNESS" ofthe ground at the different wavelengths. The tree-covered ridges are redderthan the valleys, because we assigned that color to L-band and the trees give astrong backscatter at L-band. Yellow areas are brighter in both the red andgreen images (L-band and C-band). It is somewhat easier to see thesedifferences by looking at the color image than by looking at the black andwhite images of each wavelength separately. This type of image is sometimesreferred to as a 'false color' image, since it does not represent the 'true'colors your eye would see, but an artificial selection of different colorsassigned to different wavelengths.<p><h2>Combining Images from Different Polarizations</h2> When we transmit the radio waves, we can choose the polarization.  Usually wedecide to transmit the radio waves so that they are vibrating horizontally orvertically with respect to the plane of propagation.  When the radar receivesthe radio waves, we can also choose which polarization it will receive, againusually horizontal (H) or vertical (V).  Depending on the transmit and receivepolarization, the ground reflects the radio waves differently. <p>Let's try combining three images of different polarizations.  Below are threeblack and white images of Sunbury in Pennsylvania.  Each image was illuminatedwith  the same wavelength of radio waves ("L-BAND").  But the polarization ofthe radio waves is different for each image:<p>"L-BAND HH"<p><IMG SRC="MOD2SED6.GIF"><p>"L-BAND HV"<p><IMG SRC="MOD2SED7.GIF"><p>"L-BAND VV"<p><IMG SRC="MOD2SED8.GIF"><p>As can be seen, the differences are sometimes very subtle between theseimages.  It is difficult to compare them for specific areas.  However, if weform a color image by assigning the blue color to HH, the green color to HV,and the red color to VV, we can see more clearly the differences in the radarbrightness for different transmit and receive polarizations :<p><IMG SRC="MOD2SD9.GIF"><p>In this image (<b>ColorL.gif</b>) we see thetree-covered ridges stand out as a green color. That is because the HVpolarization we selected for the green color is the best for observing thescatter off randomly oriented objects such as tree branches and leaves. So notonly does the L-Band wavelength pick out trees from agriculture well, usingL-Band HV polarization is even better. <p>We can also combine images from different polarizations and differentfrequencies. In this way we can examine the same image in different ways, andby using color we can highlight differences in radar brightness due todifferent wavelengths and polarizations of radio waves. For instance, we couldtake an L-band HH polarization image, an L-band HV polarization image, and aC-band VV polarization image, assign them the colors red, green, and bluerespectively, and get the following color image (<b>ColorLLC.gif</b>):<p>LHH, LHV, and CVV Image<p><IMG SRC="MOD2SD10.GIF"><p>This combination appears to show the contrast between the tree-covered areasand the agriculture in the valleys even better than the previous one. Thiscombination always seems to show up differences in land use well, so it is useda lot in generating color images from SIR-C. <p><table border=7 cellpadding=5>   <tr>   <td>      <a href="../CONTENTS.HTM">Teacher's Guide - Table of Contents      </a>   </td>   </tr></table><p><font size=1><i>Converted to the IBM-PC by Al Wong, al.wong@jpl.nasa.gov<br><br>Jet Propulsion Laboratory<br>4800 Oak Grove Drive<br>Pasadena, CA 91109<br></i></font></body></html>

You may alsowish to copy the Quicktime Movie Player application (located in the /SOFTWARE/QUICKTIM directory on the CD) over to your computer to play the video clip more smoothly.<p>The Lesson Plan for this component does not go into detail about howinterferometry works, but stresses the significance of the topographic mapsgenerated using this technique. You will find an explanation of howinterferometry works below.<p>In Radar Interferometry, radar measurements from two radars are combined togive a measurement of the height of the surface.<p><IMG SRC="MOD2SF2.GIF"><p>The two measurements can be obtained by using two radars, observing the groundat exactly the same time, but from slightly different vantage points. Theseparation between the two radars is often quite small, from a few meters to atmost a kilometer. An alternative is to use only one radar, and obtain the twomeasurements on different orbit tracks which are closely spaced but a day orlonger apart. This is the technique used for SIR-C: it is called Repeat-passInterferometry. It relies on the Earth's surface not changing between passes,so it doesn't work all the time. <p>Each radar measures the distance to a point on the ground very precisely. Thetwo radars, and any object on the ground, form a triangle. If we know thedistance from each radar to the object on the ground (r1 and r2), the distancebetween the two radars (the baseline B) and the angle of that baseline, <IMG SRC="MOD2SF3.GIF">(with respect to the horizontal), we can use trigonometry (cosine rule) tocalculate the height, h, of one of the radars above the position of the objecton the ground.<p><IMG SRC="MOD2SF4.GIF"><p>Here's how it works. From the above diagram, we know that:<p><IMG SRC="MOD2SF5.GIF"><p>and, by the cosine rule,<p><IMG SRC="MOD2SF6.GIF"><p>which is the same as,<p><IMG SRC="MOD2SF7.GIF"><p>We solve for <IMG SRC="MOD2SF8.GIF">,then for h (using <IMG SRC="MOD2SF9.GIF">).This calculation has to be repeated for every point on the ground within theimage, i.e. for every pixel in the image. Fix the position of one of the radarsabove sea level, and we can produce a map of the surface heights.<p>As you might imagine, generating a height map from two radar measurements inpractice is not straightforward. First we have to form an image from eachradar, then we have to make sure the two images are registered. Then it turnsout that we can only precisely measure the relative distance <IMG SRC="MOD2SF10.GIF">fromthe phase difference between each pair of radar measurements. This can berelated to the height h after some more complicated algebra and some processingon the computer. But the above explanation gives the basic idea.<p>Radar Interferometry is a technique which combines information from two radarimages to produce a map of surface heights for the area being investigated. Amap of surface heights can be made into a map with contours, showing how highmountains are, just like the type you might use when hiking, or into an image,showing the mountains, hills and valleys. Information on surface heights forany particular area can be very useful to scientists who might want to studyhow water flows in that area (usually downhill), for example.<p>Run the Quicktime Movie Player and do a <b>File | Open</b>.Go to the directory /ROADMAP/MOVIES/QTMOVIESon the CD. Select the file named <b>GalapmSP.mov</b>. You should see a window that looks something like this:<p><IMG SRC="MOD2SF11.GIF"><p>Click on the arrow at the bottom left-hand corner to play the movie. You willsee a radar-generated fly-by of the Galapagos Islands, which are a chain ofvolcanic islands in the Pacific off the coast of Ecuador. In the movie,interferometry was used to produce the height information. The gray-scaleinformation is a radar image of the islands laid on top of the surfaceinformation. The bright 'splash' on the side of the volcano which is closest toyou at the beginning is a patch of lava from a recent eruption.<p>Radar Interferometry can produce accurate height maps and very accuratemeasurements of height changes. Scientists use height maps in modeling theEarth. Height maps can be used in planning a new town, or a dam, or a canal, ora new road. The Army uses height maps as information to help get soldiers fromPoint A to Point B on the ground. Very accurate measurements of height changescan be used to monitor earthquake damage, volcanoes, landslides and glaciers,all of which cause the Earth's surface to shift.<p><table border=7 cellpadding=5>   <tr>   <td>      <a href="../CONTENTS.HTM">Teacher's Guide - Table of Contents      </a>   </td>   </tr></table><p><font size=1><i>Converted to the IBM-PC by Al Wong, al.wong@jpl.nasa.gov<br><br>Jet Propulsion Laboratory<br>4800 Oak Grove Drive<br>Pasadena, CA 91109<br></i></font></body></html>

<H2><CENTER><A NAME="PROGRAM">PROGRAM</A> DESCRIPTION</CENTER></H2>

<DL>
<DT><B><I>OBJECTIVE:</I></B>
<DD>Conduct research to build a natural gas technology base for member companies, with the aim of developing ideas and concepts beyond the near-term horizon.<P>

<DT><I><B>NEED:</B></I>

<DD>Market forces are driving manufacturers, developers, and supporting institutions toward near-term deployment of well-developed concepts.  Global competition and capital resource limitations prevent manufacturers from accepting the risks and costs associated with the development of new and innovative technologies.  There is a missing mid-term link in the development of technologies that will allow our gas industry to take advantage of new market opportunities and compete effectively in tomorrow's marketplace.  The Sustaining Membership Program (SMP) provides this missing mid-term link for its membership and strives to develop new and innovative technology concepts that will build and protect natural gas markets and will reduce the cost of transmission and distribution operations.<P>
</DL>

<DL><DT><I><B>BACKGROUND:</B></I>

<DD>SMP is receiving substantial support from companies that are Basic Members of the Institute of Gas  Technology (IGT).  The <a href="mmbrshp.htm">membership of SMP</a> have committed above and beyond this basic level to the goals of the Sustaining Membership Program.<P>

<DD>SMP was started in October 1985; currently, seven research areas are being addressed:<P>
<OL>
<LI>Power Generation
<LI>Industrial Markets
<LI>Residential and Commercial Markets
<LI>Vehicle Markets
<LI>Distribution Systems
<LI>Transmission and Storage Systems

<DD>Within these research areas, <a href="proj_sum.htm">seventeen projects are currently in progress</A>.  Fifteen others have been concluded.  It should be noted that many of these projects are coordinated with work  sponsored by the Gas Research Institute (GRI).  A number of projects are also receiving significant industry, U.S. EPA, and U.S. DOE co-funding.  Therefore, the $2.2 million in membership contributions are presently leveraged  into a program funding level exceeding $7 million.<P>

<DD>SMP, which receives the highest priority at IGT, is guided by a top-level advisory committee from the gas industry called <a href="simrac.htm">SIMRAC</a> (Sustaining IGT Member Research Advisory Committee), currently consisting of <a href="simrac.htm">10 members</a>; the <a href="smporg.htm">overall SMP organization chart</a> shows SMP's structure.<P>

<DT><I><B>SMP ADMINISTRATION</B></I>:
<UL>
<li>Members receive the benefit of a research effort dedicated to natural gas utility needs.  All dues are pooled together to fund a balanced slate of projects designed to build a technology base and thus provide a highly leveraged research effort for individual contributors.<p>

<li>IGT also shares in the cost of this program.  Sustaining Membership Research provides much more in direct labor hours for each dollar of dues expended by IGT when handled as Sustaining Membership research, compared with sponsored projects.  This is made possible by essentially eliminating the costs of proposal preparation, reports, billing, marketing, contract administration, invoice collection, and fees.<p>

<li>IGT is fully responsible for the management of the Sustaining Membership research program, not as sponsored projects, but in the way that IGT has been responsible for managing the education program with Basic Membership dues.<p>

<li>All patents resulting from work on SMP or GRI coordinated projects are assigned to IGT.  Sustaining Members receive preferential treatment on licensing over non-members.  International utility members are granted the right-of-first refusal to license SMP technologies in their respective territories.  IGT's share of royalties are returned to fund additional research in the Sustaining Membership Program.  GRI is entitled to a pro-rated share of any royalties resulting from any work funded by SMP or GRI coordinated projects if the total cumulative GRI funding is at least one-third of the combined SMP and GRI funding to date.<p>

<li>Two semiannual conferences (1 to 2 days each) are held for Sustaining Members to receive reports on programs and plans.<p>

<li>Advisory input, principally through SIMRAC, is regularly solicited to provide guidance and feedback.<p>
</ul>

<DT><I><B>FUNDING:</B></I>
<DD>The current funding level is at $2.2 million per year in Sustaining Membership dues.  IGT is also leveraging these funds through participation by U.S. EPA, U.S. DOE, industry, and GRI.  IGT continues to receive significant coordinated funding from GRI (estimated at $3.0 million in 1996) in projects that are consistent with GRI's research plan.<P>

<DD>Dues are collected annually before the beginning of the research year from  Sustaining Members.  The dues formula --<P>

<H2 ALIGN=center>IGT NATURAL GAS RETURN TECHNOLOGY ACHIEVES<BR>
70% REDUCTION OF NO<SUB>x</SUB> EMISSIONS<BR>
AT COAL-FIRED POWER PLANT<BR>
IN RICHMOND, VIRGINIA</H2>

DES PLAINES, IL, October 11, 1996 --- The Institute of Gas Technology (IGT) and the Gas Research Institute (GRI) today announced the successful completion of tests of a new natural gas injection technology that reduces nitrogen oxide emissions from coal-fired stoker boilers by up to 70%.<P>
The IGT-patented METHANE de-NOX<SUP>SM</SUP> reburn technology was tested on a boiler at a 240-MWe, coal-fired cogeneration plant in Richmond, VA, owned and operated by Cogentrix, Inc., an independent power producer based in Charlotte, NC.  METHANE de-NOX incorporates injection of natural gas above the stoker grate to create a uniform oxygen-deficient atmosphere.  These conditions promote the decomposition of fixed nitrogen compounds to harmless molecular nitrogen.<P>
Joining IGT, GRI, and Cogentrix in developing the technology were a consortium of utilities including Columbia Gas Systems, Inc.; Consumers Power Co.; Indiana Gas Co.; North Carolina Natural Gas Corp.; Texas Gas Transmission Corp.; and the City of Richmond, a municipal gas supplier.  Engineering and plant modifications were provided by Detroit Stoker Co., IGT's industrial partner.<P>
"As the first trial of reburn on coal-fired stoker boilers, the results are promising," said Greg Ridderbusch, GRI's Industrial Business Unit General Manager.  "This underscores the potential for broader application of reburn and builds on prior results from GRI's R&D efforts in the power generation market."<P>
"This is the second successful application of our METHANE de-NOX process in a commercial setting and shows how natural gas can help reduce emissions from stoker boiler systems," said Richard Biljetina, IGT's Vice President of Gas Industry Programs.  "This technology is also applicable to stokers firing municipal solid waste, refuse-derived fuel, and biomass."<P>
IGT's reburn process reduced NO<SUB>x</SUB> by over 50% with 10% natural gas injection and by up to 70% with 25% natural gas injection.  This allowed the boiler to operate in compliance with Virginia state NOx and CO regulations without using urea injection. The boilers at Richmond were originally constructed with a urea injection system to meet environmental regulations for NOx emissions. Retrofit of the METHANE de-NOX reburn system improved boiler efficiency by as much as 3% and simplified operations for emissions compliance. The plant expects to realize significant operating cost savings.<P>

<h2>IGT Wins Industry Recognition for SMP-Supported Technology</h2>

Each year R&D Magazine recognizes the top 100 new technologies that were first available for purchasing or licensing during the previous calendar year.  The winners are selected based on their importance, uniqueness, and usefulness as judged by a panel of technical experts.  IGT submitted an application for our <B>Oxygen Enriched Air Staging (OEAS)</B>.  IGT has been notified that OEAS has been accepted for this prestigious award!  The Sustaining Membership Program (SMP) has supported OEAS since its inception.<p>

As you may know, <b>Oxygen Enriched Air Staging (OEAS)</b> is an environmental technology for the economic reduction of NOx emissions from high temperature furnaces such as used in glass melting.  OEAS reduces NOx emissions by 50-70% without having a negative impact on other emissions, energy efficiency, product quality or the operability of the furnace.  OEAS costs are less than 15% of the cost of alternative technologies per ton of NOx removed.<p>

The OEAS R&D/Commercialization team is:<P>
<ul>
Combustion Tec, Inc.<br>
Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.<br>
Anchor Glass Container Corporation<br>
Owens Brockway Glass Containers, Inc.<br>
Southern California Gas Company<br>
Gas Research Institute<br>
U.S. Department of Energy -- Office of Industrial Technology<br>

<h3>IGT Sustaining Membership Program Overview</h3>

<b>The Mission:</b><P>

The Sustaining Membership Program (SMP) is a collaborative technology development program that utilizes expert scientific staff and facilities at the Institute of Gas Technology (IGT) and its development partners.  The principal objective of the program is to sustain for its members a research capability to develop new and innovative technology concepts that will build and protect existing natural gas markets, open new markets, and reduce the cost of transmission and distribution operations.<P>

<b>The Need:</b><P>

Every industry needs new technology developments to prosper; the natural gas industry is no exception.  In recent years, however, market forces have driven developers, manufacturers, and supporting institutions toward <B>near-term</B> deployment of well-developed technologies.  Global competition and capital resource limitations prevent most manufacturers from accepting the risks and costs associated with the development of new and innovative concepts.  <B>There is a missing mid-term link</B> in the development of innovative technologies that prevents the natural gas industry from taking advantage of new market and business opportunities, and, thus, competing effectively in tomorrow's marketplace.<P>

<b>The Solution:</b><P>

SMP provides the seed funding for such mid-term technology developments, pooling resources from over 50 companies, both U.S. and international.  The projects, under the direct guidance of a single advisory committee of SMP members, are focused on expanding gas utilization, meeting environmental standards, and reducing the cost of operations for member companies.  Equipment manufacturers participate in early design stages and examine new technology concepts in near-commercial-size experimental facilities before committing the heavy investments necessary for successful market introduction.<P>

<b>Member Benefits:</b><P>

SMP provides its members with --

<UL>
<LI>A highly leveraged mid-term technology development effort
<LI>Targeted research for market growth and cost reduction
<LI>New products and business opportunities
<LI>Facilities and expertise in selected core areas.
<LI>Governance in the selection of projects.<P>
</UL>

<B>Program Goals:</B><P>

SMP currently conducts research and develops products to expand markets and reduce costs in seven key areas:

<UL>
<LI>Power Generation
<LI>Industrial Markets
<LI>Residential and Commercial Markets
<LI>Vehicle Markets
<LI>Distribution Systems
<LI>Transmission and Storage Systems
<LI>Environment and Safety
</UL><P>

Staff and research laboratory facilities have been expanded in these areas to address key research issues for the gas industry.  SMP has been especially instrumental in building a core competence at IGT in the areas of combustion, bioengineering, and natural gas vehicle deployment.<P>

SMP efforts are now directed toward building additional core competencies in gas processing and distribution/transmission operations, including automation and computer software tools.<P>

Efforts to date have resulted in four license agreements with commercial partners.  Several technology development agreements containing preliminary licensing terms are also under negotiation with commercial partners.  Patents are necessary to attract and maintain the interest of commercial partners during product development and deployment phases.  Thirty-four patents have been obtained by SMP.<P>

<b>Measures of Success:</b><P>

To date, four three key areas have proven very productive and have provided commercial or near-commercial technologies:

<OL>
<LI>Low-NO<SUB>x</SUB> combustors have already been commercially deployed in the glass melting industry, in power and industrial boilers, and in air heating markets to retain and build load while meeting NO<SUB>x</SUB> emission standards.

<LI>A number of commercial applications have been introduced for both CNG and LNG vehicle applications.  These include meter accuracy determinations, calibration methods, storage cylinder testing and improvements, compressor evaluations, emission controls, and software for fueling station designs.

<LI>In gas processing, we have developed a new NFM process that effectively treats natural gas containing high quantities of CO<SUB>2</SUB> and H<SUB>2</SUB>S.

<LI>New technology for the bioremediation of soils contaminated with heavy hydrocarbons from manufactured gas plants has resulted in successful field demonstrations.  This technology is both low-cost and environmentally preferred to incineration or landfill.

Perhaps the best measure of success is the fact that SMP, in its 12th year, is attracting growing support and funding from GRI, DOE, EPRI, and industry to support later stages of development, field trials, and demonstration tests.  The $2.2 million in membership contributions are presently leveraged into a program funding level exceeding $7 million.  This further leverages the seed money from SMP and allows the program to initiate work on new ideas and concepts, thus continuing the process of building a solid technology base for future needs of the gas industry.

SMP PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</H2> 

<DL>
<DT><B><I>OBJECTIVE:</I></B>
<DD>Conduct research to build a natural gas technology base for member companies, with the aim of developing ideas and concepts beyond the near-term horizon.<P>

<!--
<DT><I><B>NEED:</B></I>
<DD>Market forces are driving manufacturers, developers, and supporting institutions toward near-term deployment of well-developed concepts.  Global competition and capital resource limitations prevent manufacturers from accepting the risks and costs associated with the development of new and innovative technologies.  There is a missing mid-term link in the development of technologies that will allow our gas industry to take advantage of new market opportunities and compete effectively in tomorrow's marketplace.  The Sustaining Membership Program (SMP) provides this missing mid-term link for its membership and strives to develop new and innovative technology concepts that will build and protect natural gas markets and will reduce the cost of transmission and distribution operations.<P>
-->

<DT><I><B>BACKGROUND:</B></I>
<DD>SMP is receiving substantial support from companies that are Basic Members of the Institute of Gas  Technology (IGT).  The <a href="mmbrshp.htm">membership of SMP</a> have committed above and beyond this basic level to the goals of the Sustaining Membership Program.<P>

<DD>SMP was started in October 1985; currently, seven research areas are being addressed:<P>
<OL>
<LI>Power Generation
<LI>Industrial Markets
<LI>Residential and Commercial Markets
<LI>Vehicle Markets
<LI>Distribution Systems
<LI>Transmission and Storage Systems
<LI>Environment and Safety
</OL><P>

<DD>Within these research areas, <A HREF="proj_sum.htm">sixteen projects are currently in progress</A>. <A HREF="cnclproj.htm">Sixteen others have been concluded</A>.  It should be noted that many of these projects are coordinated with work sponsored by the Gas Research Institute (GRI).  A number of projects are also receiving significant industry, U.S. EPA, and U.S. DOE co-funding.  Therefore, the $2.2 million in membership contributions are presently leveraged into a program funding level exceeding $7 million.<P>

<DD>The SMP, which receives the highest priority at IGT, is guided by a top-level advisory committee from the gas industry called <A HREF="simrac.htm">SIMRAC</A> (Sustaining IGT Member Research Advisory Committee), consisting of 10 members;  the <A HREF="smporg.htm">SMP organization chart</A> shows SMP's structure<P>

<DT><I><B>SMP ADMINISTRATION</B></I>:
<UL>
<li>Members receive the benefit of a research effort dedicated to natural gas utility needs.  All dues are pooled together to fund a balanced slate of projects designed to build a technology base and thus provide a highly leveraged research effort for individual contributors.<p>

<li>IGT also shares in the cost of this program.  Sustaining Membership Research provides much more in direct labor hours for each dollar of dues when handled as Sustaining Membership research, compared with sponsored projects.  This is made possible by essentially eliminating the costs of proposal preparation, reports, billing, marketing, contract administration, invoice collection, and fees.<p>

<li>IGT is fully responsible for the management of the Sustaining Membership research program, not as sponsored projects, but in the way that IGT has been responsible for managing the education program with Basic Membership dues.<p>

<li>All patents resulting from work on SMP or GRI coordinated projects are assigned to IGT.  Sustaining Members receive preferential treatment on licensing over non-members.  International utility members are granted the right-of-first refusal to license SMP technologies in their respective territories.  IGT's share of royalties are returned to fund additional research in the Sustaining Membership Program.  GRI is entitled to a pro-rated share of any royalties resulting from any work funded by SMP or GRI coordinated projects if the total cumulative GRI funding is at least one-third of the combined SMP and GRI funding to date.<p>

<li>Two semiannual conferences (1 to 2 days each) are held for Sustaining Members to receive reports on programs and plans.<p>

<li>Advisory input, principally through SIMRAC, is regularly solicited to provide guidance and feedback.<p>
</ul>

<DT><I><B>FUNDING:</B></I>
<DD>The current funding level is at $2.2 million per year in Sustaining Membership dues.  IGT is also leveraging these funds through participation by U.S. EPA, U.S. DOE, industry, and GRI.  IGT continues to receive significant coordinated funding from GRI (estimated at $3.0 million in 1996) in projects that are consistent with GRI's research plan.<P>

<DD>Dues are collected annually before the beginning of the research year from  Sustaining Members.  The dues formula --<P>

<OL>
<LI>Is scaled according to company size based on the company's most recent NOI (Net Operating Income, after  depreciation and taxes, but before capital and interest charges).<P>

<LI>Ranges from a minimum of $5,000 annually to a maximum of  $100,000.<P>
</OL>

METHANE de-NOX<SUP>SM</SUP> REBURN PROCESS FOR COAL/BIOMASS-FIRED STOKER BOILERS</CENTER></H3>

<b>Project:</b> 80030<br>
<b>Period:</b> 10/1/94 - Present<br>
<b>Project Manager:</b> <a href="/smp_o/projmgrs.htm#jkr">Joseph K. Rabovitser</a><img src="/smp_o.gif" alt="SMP only" border=0><p>

<B>Objective:</B> To demonstrate the use of the METHANE de-NOX<SUP>SM</SUP> reburn process as a control technique for reducing emissions from coal/biomass-fired stoker boilers.<P>

<B>Description:</B> A natural gas reburning technology, METHANE de-NOX<SUP>SM</SUP> (U.S. Patent Nos. 5,020,456, 5,205,227, and 5,307,746) has been developed by the Institute of Gas Technology (IGT) with funding support from SMP, the Gas Research Institute (GRI), and several gas companies.  The technology reduces NO<SUB>x</SUB> emissions below current EPA regulation levels without increasing other undesirable emissions.  Natural gas is injected together with recirculated flue gases (for enhanced mixing) above the combustion grate to create an oxygen-deficient zone.  Overfire air is then injected at a higher furnace elevation to burn out the combustibles.  This process provides significant advantages over ammonia/urea injection techniques for NO<SUB>x</SUB> control.<P>

System designs are based on extensive pilot-scale development work, and a successful demonstration at the modern Olmsted County waste-to-energy facility in Rochester, Minnesota.  See concluded SMP Project 80012.<P>

The current project further demonstrates this NO<SUB>x</SUB> control technique on coal-fired stoker boilers.  Our industrial partner is Detroit Stoker Co.  It is estimated that 2,000 stoker boilers currently operate in the United States.  Historically, stokers have had problems with gaseous and particulate emissions, erosion, slagging, and fouling.  Many are turning to ammonia/urea injection to control NO<SUB>x</SUB> emissions; however, ammonia-slip and other operating problems are causing serious concern.  This provides the opportunity for natural gas to capture a portion of this load by injecting 10% to 25% natural gas for NO<SUB>x</SUB> control.<P>

<B>Status:</B> Field tests demonstrating our METHANE de-NOX reburn process have been successfully completed on one Cogentrix coal-fired stoker boiler in Richmond, Virginia.  NO<SUB>x</SUB> reductions over 50% were achieved with 10% natural gas injection and up to 70% reductions were possible with 25% natural gas addition.  The boiler is now in continuous operation and is in compliance with state NO<SUB>x</SUB> and CO regulations without the need for urea injection.<P>

Successful conversion of all eight boilers at the Cogentrix facility will add an estimated 3 BCF/yr of new gas load.  There is a potential for 130 BCF/yr of new gas load on a nationwide basis (10% co-firing, 60% duty cycle).<P>

ADVANCED REGENERATIVE <A NAME="GLASS">GLASS</A> MELTING FURNACE</CENTER></H3>

<b>Project:</b> 80024<br>
<b>Period:</b> 4/1/91 - Present<br>
<b>Project Manager:</b> <a href="/smp_o/projmgrs.htm#ha">Hamid Abbasi</a><img src="/smp_o.gif" alt="SMP only" border=0><br>
<b>Principal Investigator:</b> David Rue<p>

<B>Objective:</B> Develop combustion modifications to reduce NO<SUB>x</SUB> emissions from regenerative glass melting furnaces and to provide higher productivity while maintaining melt quality.<P>

<B>Description:</B> A technique of oxygen-enriched air staging (OEAS) is being developed for reducing NO<SUB>x</SUB> emissions from glass melters with additional funding from Southern California Gas Co., GRI, and the U.S. Department of Energy.  A version of this technique was evaluated on IGTs glass tank simulator in an earlier program for GRI, and significant NO<SUB>x</SUB> reductions were demonstrated.  The proposed technique requires only minor plant modifications and involves reducing the combustion air to the burner to retard NO<SUB>x</SUB> formation and the injection of the remaining air (with oxygen enrichment) downstream to complete the combustion.  This also improves furnace production rates.  Implementation of this technology avoids expensive options such as oxy-gas firing and electric boosting, thus avoiding plant closings in a market that uses over 120 BCF/y of natural gas.  This technology received an R&D 100 award in 1996.<P>

<B>Status:</B> IGT and its commercial partners, Combustion Tec, Inc. (CTI), and Air Products and Chemicals (APCI), are now on a fast-track program to demonstrate and commercialize the OEAS technology for regenerative glass furnaces.  As a result, the OEAS technology has already been successfully retrofitted to three Anchor Glass Corporation endport furnaces:  a 150 ton/d furnace producing flint glass in Huntington Park, CA; a 200 ton/d furnace producing amber glass in Houston, TX; and a 320 ton/d flint glass furnace in Huntington Park, CA.  The 320 ton/d furnace was a commercial retrofit sale and allowed Anchor to switch from oil to gas firing.  As a result of the successful field conversions, showing 50% to 70% NO<SUB>x</SUB> reduction, CTI and APCI have licensed the OEAS technology and are involved in sales negotiations with glass makers in the U.S. and Canada.  Commercial installation of OEAS on two 135 ton/d amber glass furnaces at Rocky Mountain Glass Containers in Colorado were completed in March and September 1996.  Anchor is planning 7 to 10 additional endport furnace retrofits in the next two years.<P>

Owens-Brockway Glass Containers, the largest container glass producer in the U.S., has joined the project team to field test the OEAS technology on one of its sideport furnace in Vernon, California.  Sideport furnaces provide nearly 65% of U.S. glass production.  Modifications have been completed, and testing is in progress.  Initial results indicated that emission reductions are below state regulations.<P>

<h2>NEWS RELEASE</h2>

Release Date:  June  4, 1996

<h3>INERT BASE GAS TECHNOLOGY GETS GO-AHEAD IN THE U.S.</h3>

CHICAGO ---  Equitrans, Inc., Gas Research Institute (GRI), and Institute of Gas Technology (IGT) announced today that Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has issued an Order approving the proposed Inert Base Gas Field Experiment at Equitrans' Shirley Storage Field located in Tyler and Doddridge Counties, West Virginia.  This field experiment -- to be undertaken as a part of the overall research effort cosponsored by Equitrans, GRI, and IGT's Sustaining Membership Program (SMP) -- is designed to demonstrate the technical feasibility and economic viability of replacing a portion of the base (or cushion) natural gas in storage reservoirs with an inert gas.  Specifically, the Order authorizes Equitrans to withdraw up to 400 million cubic feet (MMcf) of base natural gas from its Shirley storage reservoir and to replace the base gas by injecting 300 MMcf of nitrogen.<p>

For more information on this announcement, please view the entire <a href="./news/ibg.htm">Inert Base Gas Technology News Release</a>.<p><p>

For further details about the technology, see the project entitled "<a href="/80007.htm">Inert Base Gas for Natural Gas Storage Fields</a>".<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE><i><b>Burner Tip of the Month</b><br>
Electricity-generating plants have long had to deal with the ash created by combustion; now, the Institute of Gas Technology (IGT) says it has a solution. IGT recently announced the successful demonstration of a process that uses its natural gas-fired CYCOM technology to vitrify fly ash, allowing for either its reuse or disposal in standard landfills.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The tests, which were funded by Gaz de France and the Canadian Natural Gas Technology Centre, were conducted on fly ash from a municipal solid-waste-to-energy plant in Rochester, Minn., in a 3.5-ton-per-day pilot unit at IGT's Energy Development Center in Chicago. IGT says the tests showed that the process economically creates a non-leachable, glass-like slag that meets all current and foreseeable EPA use/disposal guidelines.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The system uses a gravity-feed cyclonic melter that vitrifies the fly ash in an ultra high-intensity vertical vortex chamber. High treatment temperatures and downstream scrubbing equipment ensure the complete destruction of organic chemicals in the ash and provide clean stack gases, according to IGT.</i></BLOCKQUOTE>

SMP PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</H2> 

<DL>
<DT><B><I>OBJECTIVE:</I></B>
<DD>Conduct research to build a natural gas technology base for member companies, with the aim of developing ideas and concepts beyond the near-term horizon.<P>

<!--
<DT><I><B>NEED:</B></I>
<DD>Market forces are driving manufacturers, developers, and supporting institutions toward near-term deployment of well-developed concepts.  Global competition and capital resource limitations prevent manufacturers from accepting the risks and costs associated with the development of new and innovative technologies.  There is a missing mid-term link in the development of technologies that will allow our gas industry to take advantage of new market opportunities and compete effectively in tomorrow's marketplace.  The Sustaining Membership Program (SMP) provides this missing mid-term link for its membership and strives to develop new and innovative technology concepts that will build and protect natural gas markets and will reduce the cost of transmission and distribution operations.<P>
-->

<DT><I><B>BACKGROUND:</B></I>
<DD>SMP is receiving substantial support from companies that are Basic Members of the Institute of Gas  Technology (IGT).  The <a href="mmbrshp.htm">membership of SMP</a> have committed above and beyond this basic level to the goals of the Sustaining Membership Program.<P>

<DD>SMP was started in October 1985; currently, seven research areas are being addressed:<P>
<OL>
<LI>Power Generation
<LI>Industrial Markets
<LI>Residential and Commercial Markets
<LI>Vehicle Markets
<LI>Distribution Systems
<LI>Transmission and Storage Systems
<LI>Environment and Safety
</OL><P>

<DD>Within these research areas, <a href="proj_sum.htm">seventeen projects are currently in progress</A>.  Fifteen others have been concluded.  It should be noted that many of these projects are coordinated with work  sponsored by the Gas Research Institute (GRI).  A number of projects are also receiving significant industry, U.S. EPA, and U.S. DOE co-funding.  Therefore, the $2.2 million in membership contributions are presently leveraged  into a program funding level exceeding $7 million.<P>

<DD>SMP, which receives the highest priority at IGT, is guided by a top-level advisory committee from the gas industry called <a href="/smp_o/simrac.htm">SIMRAC <img src="/smp_o.gif" alt="SMP only" border=0></a> (Sustaining IGT Member Research Advisory Committee), currently consisting of 10 members; the <a href="/smporg.htm">overall SMP organization chart</a> shows SMP's structure.<P>

<DT><I><B>SMP ADMINISTRATION</B></I>:
<UL>
<li>Members receive the benefit of a research effort dedicated to natural gas utility needs.  All dues are pooled together to fund a balanced slate of projects designed to build a technology base and thus provide a highly leveraged research effort for individual contributors.<p>

<li>IGT also shares in the cost of this program.  Sustaining Membership Research provides much more in direct labor hours for each dollar of dues expended by IGT when handled as Sustaining Membership research, compared with sponsored projects.  This is made possible by essentially eliminating the costs of proposal preparation, reports, billing, marketing, contract administration, invoice collection, and fees.<p>

<li>IGT is fully responsible for the management of the Sustaining Membership research program, not as sponsored projects, but in the way that IGT has been responsible for managing the education program with Basic Membership dues.<p>

<li>All patents resulting from work on SMP or GRI coordinated projects are assigned to IGT.  Sustaining Members receive preferential treatment on licensing over non-members.  International utility members are granted the right-of-first refusal to license SMP technologies in their respective territories.  IGT's share of royalties are returned to fund additional research in the Sustaining Membership Program.  GRI is entitled to a pro-rated share of any royalties resulting from any work funded by SMP or GRI coordinated projects if the total cumulative GRI funding is at least one-third of the combined SMP and GRI funding to date.<p>

<li>Two semiannual conferences (1 to 2 days each) are held for Sustaining Members to receive reports on programs and plans.<p>

<li>Advisory input, principally through SIMRAC, is regularly solicited to provide guidance and feedback.<p>
</ul>

<DT><I><B>FUNDING:</B></I>
<DD>The current funding level is at $2.2 million per year in Sustaining Membership dues.  IGT is also leveraging these funds through participation by U.S. EPA, U.S. DOE, industry, and GRI.  IGT continues to receive significant coordinated funding from GRI (estimated at $3.0 million in 1996) in projects that are consistent with GRI's research plan.<P>

<DD>Dues are collected annually before the beginning of the research year from  Sustaining Members.  The dues formula --<P>

<OL>
<LI>Is scaled according to company size based on the company's most recent NOI (Net Operating Income, after  depreciation and taxes, but before capital and interest charges).<P>

<LI>Ranges from a minimum of $5,000 annually to a maximum of  $100,000.<P>
</OL>

NOx AND CO EMISSIONS REDUCTION FROM MSW COMBUSTORS</center></H3>

<b>Project:</b> 80012<br>
<b>Period:</b> 10/1/86 - 3/31/91<br>
<b>Funding:</b> SMP:  $619K / GRI:  $1,555K / IND:  $350K / MGF:  $270K<br>
<b>Project Manager:</b> Hamid Abbasi<p>

<B>Objective:</B> To use natural gas injection as a control technique for reducing NO<SUB>x</SUB> and CO emissions from municipal solid waste (MSW) combustion systems.<P>

<B>Description:</B> Restrictions for landfill disposal of MSW have resulted in acceptance of mass burning as an alternative.  Significant advances, considering the relatively poor quality of the fuel, have been made in combustion, heat recovery, and environmental control equipment.  However, existing plants continue to experience problems with emissions.  The most commonly employed mass burn combustors have average NO<SUB>x</SUB> emissions of about 250 ppm (@ 7% O<SUB>2</SUB>).  EPA has issued standards requiring that NO<SUB>x</SUB> emissions not exceed 180 ppm for large combustors.<P>

IGT joined with Riley Stoker Corp., and TAKUMA CO., LTD. to develop a NO<SUB>x</SUB> control technology using in-furnace natural gas injection.  Funding support for this project was received from Brooklyn Union Gas Co., GRI, Minnesota Gas Co., Northern Illinois Gas Co., Northern Natural Gas Co., Peoples Gas, Light and Coke Co., Southern California Gas Co., and the SMP.<P>

<B>Results:</B> A natural gas injection technology termed METHANE de-NOXSM (U.S. Patent Nos. 5,020,456; 5,205,227; and 5,307,746; Canadian Patent No. 2,036,944; and Japan Patent No. 2,026,049) has been developed that reduces NO<SUB>x</SUB> emissions below EPA regulation levels without increasing other undesirable emissions.  The system design was based on extensive pilot-scale development work at both IGT and Riley facilities, and was successfully demonstrated during a thirty day field evaluation period at the modern Olmsted County waste-to-energy facility in Rochester, Minnesota.  Testing was conducted on one of two 100-ton/day Riley/Takuma mass-burn combustors.<P>

NOx levels were controlled below 75 parts per million (ppm) while maintaining carbon monoxide (CO) levels below 40 ppm (both at 7% oxygen) with natural gas injection of about 14% of total heat input.  Compared to baseline levels, this is a 60% reduction in NO<SUB>x</SUB> and a 50% reduction in CO emissions.  These figures are very significant because the test unit is a state-of-the-art combustor with fairly low baseline emissions levels.  Natural gas injection also resulted in a significant reduction in excess air while flue gas recirculation levels of 6% to 8% were sufficient to inject and effectively mix the natural gas.  This technology, therefore, offers several benefits (lower emissions, lower costs, no ammonia slip and no visible plume) when compared to thermal de-NO<SUB>x</SUB> which currently is the only commercial NO<SUB>x</SUB> control technology for MSW combustors.<P>

<B>Application &amp; Status:</B> <B><I>NO<SUB>x</SUB> emissions reduction from waste-to-energy plants.</I></B>  A commercial license has been  granted to TAKUMA CO., LTD. for the territory of Japan.  A demonstration is in progress in Japan.  In addition, METHANE de-NOX is being demonstrated on a coal-fired stoker boiler system in the U.S.  See <A HREF="./80030.htm">SMP Project 80030</A>.<P>

METHANE de-TOX<sup>&reg;</sup> PROCESS FOR MSW COMBUSTORS</center></H3>

<b>Project:</b> 80025<br>
<b>Period:</b> 10/1/91 - 9/30/93<br>
<b>Funding:</b> SMP:  $278K / DOE:  $293K<br>
<b>Project Manager:</b> Hamid Abbasi<p>

<B>Objective:</B> To develop natural gas-based emission reduction technologies for municipal waste combustors (MWCs) that avoid the need to install expensive post-combustion control equipment such as spray dryers for acid gas control.<P>

<B>Description:</B> EPA is developing air pollution rules that will set stringent MWC emission limits.  There is a need to demonstrate effective reduction technologies for the combined control of acid gases, NO<SUB>x</SUB>, trace metals, and organics.<P>

In another SMP/GRI coordinated program (Project 80012), IGT developed the technology of natural gas injection (termed METHANE de-NOXSM) for NO<SUB>x</SUB> reduction from MWCs.  This technology was successfully demonstrated at the Olmsted Waste-to-Energy facility. IGT subsequently, with support from DOE/NREL, and in cooperation with U.S. EPA, designed a process which combines natural gas with dry sorbent injection to demonstrate simultaneous control of several air pollutants.  The proposed technique is termed METHANE de-TOX<SUP>®</SUP>.  A U.S. Patent, No. 5,105,747 has been issued.<P>

The technology goals are:  to reduce NO<SUB>x</SUB> to below 80 vppm, CO and THC to below 40 vppm (all at 7% O<SUB>2</SUB>), HCl by 95%, SO<SUB>x</SUB> by 80%, and combined PCDD/PCDF to below 5 mg/Sm<SUP>3</SUP> at the boiler exit; minimize corrosion of the boiler and downstream equipment; increase boiler thermal efficiency by 5% and, consequently, increase overall power production efficiency by over 10%.  Successful demonstration of these emission reductions would provide the industry with a low-cost control technology that meets the new EPA regulations set in 1991.<P>

<B>Results:</B> A retrofit system design has been completed.  This includes a detailed design, safety analysis, and quotations for all major equipment.<P>

<B>Application &amp; Status:</B> <B><I>Reduction of SO<SUB>x</SUB>, HCl, and NOx emissions from waste-to-energy plants.</I></B>  This  technology further enhances the economics of applying METHANE de-NOX.  See active Project 80030.  Further development of METHANE de-TOX requires investments beyond the scope of the SMP.  Funding for the construction and operating phases of the project is being sought from U.S. DOE, EPA, and participating utilities.<P>

MICROBIAL PRODUCTION OF CHEMICALS FROM METHANE</center></H3>

<b>Project:</b> 80003<br>
<b>Period:</b> 10/1/85 - 9/30/95<br>
<b>Funding:</b> SMP:  $1,513K / GRI:  $1,200K<br>
<b>Project Manager:</b> Robert Kelley<p>

<B>Objective:</B> To obtain experimental data and to determine the technical and economic feasibility of microbial utilization of methane for the production of regio- and stereospecific value-added chemicals.<P>

<B>Description:</B> Methane-utilizing microbes can produce chemicals by co-oxidizing other carbon compounds.  In this case, methane is used as a fuel.  The co-oxidation product accumulates in the reaction medium.  For certain co-oxidation reactions the products obtained are in one molecular configuration called a stereo- or regiospecific isomer, unlike a mixture of optical isomers produced in chemical processes.  A preliminary survey conducted by Battelle on behalf of IGT and GRI indicates that specific optical isomers are of interest to the chemical industry.  These isomers may act as value-added intermediates in the production of the next generation of polymers, food additives, and pharmaceuticals.<P>

<B>Results:</B> IGT scientists have co-oxidized more than 30 chemicals and successfully produced several stereo- and regiospecific products.  Stereospecific propylene oxide has been identified as having significant commercial potential.  The influence of several regeneration factors on the enhancement of propylene oxide production rates has been examined.  We have found that the use of methanol, formate, and ethanol is very effective in enhancing the productivity of propylene oxide (PO) to levels as high as 2000 lb of PO/lb of biocatalyst/h.  Preliminary economic analyses have been conducted for a continuous bioreactor and a granular activated carbon fluidized-bed reactor (GAC-FBR).  The GAC-FBR provided the best results with a potential range of $1 to $5/lb of PO.<P>

<B>Application &amp; Status:</B> <B><I>Chemicals production from methane.</I></B>  Project on hold.  Due to the time urgency and  resource limitations of town gas site remediation work, IGT staff has been redirected to this effort.  The SMP Industry Advisory Committee, SIMRAC, will determine the timing of work resumption in this area.<P>

AIR PARTIAL OXIDATION OF NATURAL GAS IN A FLUIDIZED BED</center></H3>

<b>Project:</b> 80008<br>
<b>Period:</b> 10/1/85 - 3/31/88<br>
<b>Funding:</b> SMP:  $352K<br>
<b>Project Manager:</b> Jitendra Patel<br>
<b>Principal Investigator:</b>  Michael Roberts<p>

<B>Objective:</B> To develop an improved process for producing synthesis gas for ammonia from natural gas.<P>

<B>Description:</B> Conventionally, synthesis gas for ammonia has been produced from natural gas by steam reforming.  A new and more economical scheme for making synthesis gas is proposed in which air is reacted with natural gas under partial oxidation conditions, producing synthesis gas containing a significant amount of nitrogen.  A part of the nitrogen is used for ammonia production; the excess nitrogen is removed in a cryogenic step that also recovers energy by expanding waste nitrogen. IGT conducted its research in existing high-temperature, high-pressure, fluidized-bed reactors to determine whether fluidized-bed operations will provide the best method for production of the synthesis gas from methane.<P>

	Result:	Nineteen tests were completed in a 4-inch-diameter fluidized-bed reactor to obtain a data base for determining the economic feasibility of producing ammonia by air partial oxidation of natural gas.  Partial oxidation of methane using an inert alumina bed material and a catalyst has been demonstrated at conversions of 63% and 97%, respectively.  Reactor operating conditions for the parametric tests were at a pressure level of 300 psig and temperature ranges from 1600o to 2000oF.  The effects of varying the ratios of natural gas to steam, natural gas to air, and space velocity were determined using a catalyst.  An extended test (8 hours of steady-state operation) and a design point test (72 hours of steady-state operation) were conducted.  Trace carbon formations acceptable in fluidized reactor operation were observed in most of the tests.  Some catalyst decrepitation, as well as elutriation of solids from the reactor bed, occurred but may be minimized or eliminated by proper catalyst preparation.  Targeted methane conversions and product-gas compositions were achieved.<P>

Preliminary studies conducted by Foster Wheeler Corporation show that retrofitting an existing 100 ton/day ammonia plant by this technique would reduce natural gas requirements from 34 million Btu to 28 million Btu per ton of ammonia at an investment cost of $15 million.  For a new, large (2200 ton/day) ammonia plant, capital cost reductions of 10% to 15% are projected.<P>

<B>Application &amp; Status:</B> Ammonia production.  Requires manufacturing partner and commercial demonstration.<P>

<b>Project:</b> 80010<br>
<b>Period:</b> 10/1/86 - 9/30/90<br>
<b>Funding:</b> SMP:  $580 K / GRI:  $962 K<br>
<b>Project Manager:</b> Anthony L. Lee <br>
<b>Principal Investigator:</b>  Erek Erekson<p>

<B>Objective:</B> To study the oxidative coupling of methane to ethylene, and other high-value chemicals.<P>

<B>Description:</B> Novel catalysts were prepared at IGT using both primary and secondary promoters/stabilizers.  Reaction kinetics and product formation of selected catalysts were studied in a fixed-bed reactor system at temperatures in the range of 600$deg; to 800$deg;C, pressures from 1 to 100 atmospheres, and methane/oxygen ratios from 3 to 30.<P>

<B>Results:</B> On this coordinated project with GRI, a number of oxidative catalytic methods for converting methane to chemicals were investigated including the coupling of methane to methane to produce ethylene, as well as the cross coupling of methane and toluene, to form styrene.  The best yield for ethylene production was 28% over a Li/B/MgO catalyst.  Other researchers reported C<SUB>2</SUB> yields in the range of 10 to 30%.  For the cross coupling of methane and toluene to form styrene, the best yield was 15% per pass.  Other researchers reported 5 to 12% yields.<P>

Besides testing a total of 95 separate catalyst formulations in 539 runs, we also investigated the following novel methods for methane conversion by using:<P>

SURFACE COMBUSTOR FOR PROCESS HEATERS</center></H3>

<b>Project:</b> 80019<br>
<b>Period:</b> 4/1/90 - 4/30/94<br>
<b>Funding:</b> SMP:  $178K / GRI:  $299K<br>
<b>Project Manager:</b> Tian-Yu Xiong<p>

<B>Objective:</B> To develop a compact and high-efficiency, combustor-heat exchanger system capable of meeting very stringent emissions regulations.  This natural gas-fired heater is designed to replace conventional process heaters, such as used in refineries.  This technology may also be applicable to water heaters and boilers.<P>

<B>Description:</B> The surface combustor design is based on the concept of relatively cold heat exchanger surfaces embedded in a stationary bed of refractory material, in which gaseous fuel is burned.  The heat released is extracted by the embedded heat exchanger through combined convective-radiative heat transfer.  The convective heat transfer between the products of combustion and the heat exchanger is enhanced because gas flow across the tube surfaces is intensely mixed by the bed of packed solid particles surrounding the tubes.  This greatly increases the heat flux.  Complete combustion is achieved at relatively low temperatures and provides a flue gas stream with very low NOx, CO and total hydrocarbon (THC) emissions.  Combining the combustor and heat exchanger also makes the unit more compact, capable of high turndown ratios, and less costly.<P>

<B>Results:</B> Initial investigations obtained extensive combustion and heat transfer data in a bench-scale unit for the design of prototype combustors.  Parametric studies on the effects of tube configurations, bed materials, and operating conditions were completed.  The data verified the excellent performances of this combustor-heater: high combustion intensity (up to 0.8 X 10<SUP>6</SUP> Btu/h-ft<SUP>2</SUP>), high heat transfer rates (up to 120 X 10<SUP>3</SUP> Btu/h-ft<SUP>2</SUP>) and very low combustion emissions for both NO<SUB>x </SUB>and CO (as low as 15 ppm at 0% O<SUB>2</SUB>).<P>

A GRI coordinated project provided the necessary combustion/heat transfer model development to assist in scale-up of this technology.  Purdue University, as a subcontractor, was responsible for the development of the computer-based model.  A computer code was developed to simultaneously solve the energy and momentum equations with variable properties.  The model has been validated using experimental data.  A comparison of the calculated major parameters (pressure drop, gas temperatures, heat transfer, flame location, thermal efficiency and NO<SUB>x</SUB> emissions) with the experimental data obtained at IGT shows good agreement.  Two U.S. Patents, Nos. 5,375,563 and 5,476,375, have been issued.<P>

<B>Application &amp; Status:</B> <B><I>High-efficiency, low-emissions process heaters.</I></B>  Technology development agreement has been signed with a manufacturing partner, <A HREF="./partners.htm">TAKUMA CO., LTD.</A>, and further development is being funded directly by Takuma.<P>

<b>Period:</b> 1/1/94 - 9/30/94<br>
<b>Funding:</b> SMP:  $250K / GRI:  $391K<br>
<b>Project Manager:</b> Hamid Abbasi<br>
<b>Principal Investigator:</b> Jeffrey Mocsari<p>

<B>Objective:</B> Develop advanced indirect heating systems that will maintain or improve the competitiveness of natural gas-fired equipment in industrial heat treating applications.<P>

<B>Description:</B> During the last two decades, competitive global energy and market conditions have motivated the metals industry to improve the energy utilization of heat treating systems.  To address this issue, research has been directed toward one or more of the following:  1) improving process productivity; 2) improving thermal efficiency; 3) improving process temperature uniformity; 4) improving product quality; and 5) reducing hazardous stack emissions.<P>

This project aims to develop advanced, natural gas-fired heating systems (for example, systems that use ceramic radiant tubes) and will include integration of new burner designs and advanced material components into full-scale indirect heating systems.  A high-temperature indirect heat treating furnace, installed at IGTs Energy Development Center, is used to simulate heat treating process conditions and collect data.<P>

<B>Results:</B> GRI awarded IGT a contract to evaluate the performance of 3Ms Hybrid U-Tube for industrial heating applications.  The Hybrid U-Tube provides increased operating temperature capabilities, thus increasing both the productivity and improving the operating life of this crucial furnace component.<P>

The Hybrid U-Tube was first evaluated in IGTs test facility.  Furnace atmosphere quality, mounting techniques, tube thermal shock resistance, and temperature uniformity were studied and a successful retrofit package consisting of a Hybrid U-Tube and mounting hardware was developed.  Subsequent GRI funding is evaluating the 3M U-Tube at user sites.  Two Hybrid U-Tubes have been in operation since mid-1994 in a retort carburizing furnace at the Timken Company bearing plant in Bucyrus, Ohio.  The life and performance of these tubes is being monitored.<P>

<B>Application &amp; Status:</B> <B><I>Metal heat treating furnaces.</I></B> Successful demonstration of the 3M Hybrid U-Tube promises to strengthen the position of gas-fired heating systems in the industrial heating market.  Continuation funding for this work is being provided by GRI.  Market deployment strategy is being developed by 3M.<P>

<H3><CENTER>INDUSTRIAL MARKETS:<br>
NATURAL GAS BURNER FOR DIRECT-FIRED AIR HEATERS</CENTER></H3>

<b>Project:</b> 80015<br>
<b>Period:</b> 10/1/88 - present<br>
<b>Funding:</b> SMP: $602K / GRI: $393K / Ind.: $325K<br>
<b>Project Manager:</b> Joseph K. Rabovitser<br>
<b>Principal Investigator:</b> Sandeep Ahuja<p>

<B>Objective:</B> To develop a natural gas-fired, ultra-low emission burner designed to provide cost-effective, low-temperature direct air heating for food, malting, drying, and space heating.<P>

<B>Description:</B> Current direct-fired air heating technology produces emission levels that are not acceptable for many hot air applications.  In the food drying industry, for example, the primary concern is the potential for formation of nitrosamines from the relatively high levels of NO<SUB>x</SUB> (>5 ppm at 15% O<SUB>2</SUB>) in the directly heated air.  This concern for nitrosamines forced the malt drying industry to switch to more costly indirect heating methods.  Some of these are now operating on fuel oil and electricity.  IGT teamed with Maxon Corp. to develop natural gas-fired burners for direct air heaters that are technically superior to other fossil fuel-fired and electric indirect-air heaters.  This work was also funded by Southern California Gas Company and GRI.<P>

<B>Results:</B> Both a 1 X 10<SUP>6</SUP> Btu/h concept and a 2.5 X 10<SUP>6</SUP> Btu/h prototype ultra-low-NO<SUB>x</SUB> (ULN) burner were jointly designed and tested by IGT and Maxon at IGT's Applied Combustion Research Facility.  Experimental results demonstrated two major technical goals:  ultra-low emissions and sufficient turndown ratio.  NO<SUB>x</SUB> emissions from these cyclonic combustors were below 1.5 vppm, while CO and THC were below 4.5 vppm. Turndown ratios up to 25:1 were obtained.<P>

Field tests were also successfully completed using a 0.5 x 10<SUP>6</SUP> Btu/h burner at Alkar (an oven manufacturer for the food industry) in Lodi, Wisconsin.  In these field tests, two types of meat (turkey and beef) were cooked using a conventional direct-fired burner, and our ULN burner.  Cooked meat samples were analyzed at Utah State University using visual, optical, and chemical tests.  The analyses showed that the quality of food cooked using the ULN burner was both superior and eliminated the pinking of meats cooked by the conventional burner.<P>

<B>Application &amp; Status:</B> <B><I>Direct process air heating.</I></B> Maxon continues to successfully market a single-stage version of this burner concept.  Known as the CYCLOMAX burner, it produces less than 8 ppm NOx and less than 25 ppm CO.  To date, Maxon has sold over 250 of these burners for air heating, fume incineration and metal finishing.  The ULN version requires optimization and is available for licensing.<P>

<b>Project:</b> 80023<br>
<b>Period:</b> 4/1/91 - 9/30/95<br>
<b>Funding:</b> SMP: $474K / GRI: $150K / DOE: $654K<br>
<b>Project Manager:</b> Erek Erekson<p>

<B>Objective:</B> Investigate the use of oxide-based, non-noble metal catalysts for application to gas engine exhaust cleanup for natural gas vehicles and compressor stations.<P>

<B>Description:</B> While natural gas engines are less polluting than gasoline engines, increasingly stringent environmental regulations make an exhaust catalytic converter an important option for both NGVs and stationary compressor engines.  The purpose of this project was to develop catalysts that convert CO, unburned hydrocarbons and NO<SUB>x</SUB> to benign compounds.  Catalytic converters for gasoline engines use expensive platinum group metals, the aim of this development program was to develop effective catalyst formulations from oxide-based, non-noble metals.<P>

<B>Results:</B> IGT has developed catalysts that achieve 80% to 95% methane conversion at high temperatures (>550$deg;C).  These catalysts also remove 20% to 35% of the NO<SUB>x</SUB> in the exhaust from lean-burn engines.  A further goal for this project was to achieve 90% NO<SUB>x</SUB> conversion.  A more basic study of NO<SUB>x</SUB> adsorption in lean burn-type environments was conducted.  A more effective catalyst route for NO<SUB>x</SUB> conversion was not identified.<P>

<B>Application &amp; Status:</B> Natural gas vehicles.  IGT has developed effective, low-cost catalysts for use in the event that regulations force a high methane conversion in the exhaust gas.  A catalyst that would simultaneously convert high levels of NO<SUB>x</SUB> would require further development work.<P>

<b>Period:</b> 10/1/85 - 12/31/91<br>
<b>Funding:</b> SMP:  $1,544K / GRI:  $1,537K<br>
<b>Project Manager:</b> William F. Rush, Jr.<p>

<B>Objective:</B> To define, develop, and demonstrate the key features of an integrated advanced gas distribution systems that substantially automates and advances gas distribution operations, improves safety, and reduces operating and maintenance costs.<P>

<B>Description:</B> Individual features and related components of advanced distribution systems were designed in modules to optimize their flexibility.  Components integrated within the system included advanced meters, automated valves, pressure sensors, cathodic protection monitors, communication links, power sources, and pipe locaters.  A laboratory model of the advanced gas distribution system was demonstrated. Methods of data communication evaluated included wire, radio, and telephone.  Whenever possible, commercial equipment was selected for the laboratory model to demonstrate available technology.<P>

<B>Results:</B> Basic components of an automated distribution system were evaluated.  A total of 20 meters, capable of automated meter reading, were installed using a dedicated wire communication technique. Connections through plastic, steel, and cast iron pipe systems were demonstrated.  Features of the system included automated billing, multiple-rate billing, backup electrical power, tamper detection, pipe-to-soil potential-measurement, district meter reading, and remote city gate control.<P>

For more advanced systems a 2-inch robot platform was evaluated.  Adaptation of compact, low-cost control and sensor technology to robotic inspection/location devices were investigated.  A patent was obtained for an automated posting valve and assembly (U.S. Patent No. 4,987,924).<P>

Coordinated projects have also been completed with GRI to 1) evaluate power supply options for automatic residential gas meters, 2) develop low-cost sensors for automated gas distribution systems, and 3) develop a computerized operation management (COM) system for gas distribution operations.  Initial efforts focused on COM system requirements at the residential level and were coordinated with similar efforts by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) and other industry associations.  Specifications for utility data communications requirements at the residential level compatible with the EPRI utility communication architecture (UCA) have been submitted to standards committees in the U.S. for evaluation.<P>

<B>Application &amp; Status:</B> Automation of utility systems.  Standards for automatic meter reading communication protocols have been developed and accepted by industry standards committees.<P>

<b>Funding:</b> SMP:  $150K<br>
<b>Project Manager:</b> Jim Semrau<p>

<B>Objective:</B> To evaluate the performance of solvents being developed at IGT for acid-gas removal from subquality natural gas in rotating gas-liquid contactors.<P>

<B>Description:</B> Essentially all of the natural gas in the U.S. is treated to some degree prior to its introduction into the pipeline system for transportation to the consumer.  Current studies, using an N-formyl-morpholine (NFM) solvent, have demonstrated excellent commercialization potential in conventional gas processing equipment.  This process involves mass transfer operations and frequently employs gas-liquid contacting units, such as conventional towers with trays or packing.  Rotating contactors provide an alternative and promise the following advantages over conventional mass-transfer devices:  1) very effective mass transfer; 2) short residence times; 3) small footprint; 4) low weight; 5) small fluids inventory; 6) small wetted surface area; 7) rapid response to operational changes; and 8) portability.<P>

	The performance of NFM may be greatly enhanced when used in a rotating contactor system.  While both engineering and academic studies have been performed on rotating contactors, there is a lack of sufficient data and models to fully scale up the technology.  This program conducted studies on a rotating contactor unit with the solvent systems under development at IGT.<P>

<B>Results:</B> See current Project 80018.<P>

<B>Application &amp; Status:</B> <B><I>Natural gas upgrading.</I></B> This work, which is primarily funded by GRI and DOE, has been combined with the work effort under active Project 80018.<P>

<b>Period:</b> 10/1/85 - 9/30/94<br>
<b>Funding:</b> SMP:  $1,773K / IND:  $100K<br>
<b>Project Manager:</b> Hamid Abbasi<br>
<b>Principal Investigator:</b>  John Wagner<p>

<B>Objective:</B> To develop gas-fired combustion systems for industrial wastes.<P>

<B>Description:</B> A comprehensive, computerized data base on thermally-treatable, liquid and solid wastes was used to define markets for waste combustion requiring supplemental natural gas fuel use.  About 6 million metric tons of wastes per annum have been identified as candidates for gas-fired cyclonic combustion systems. <P>

A comprehensive test facility was subsequently established to evaluate specific waste combustion solutions using an improved, second-generation cyclonic combustor.  An automated 3-million Btu/h test unit complete with gaseous, liquid and solids fuel feeding systems, as well as, downstream gas conditioning equipment has been installed at IGT's Energy Development Center.<P>

<B>Results:</B> A slagging cyclonic combustor (CYCOM&trade;) was developed for a class of industrial solid wastes.  Performance of the unit was evaluated using spent aluminum potliner (SPL), a by-product of primary aluminum production.  SPL, which contains cyanides and fluorides, has been classified as a hazardous waste material by the U.S. EPA.  Additional funding was received from Tenneco, Enron Corp., and Northwest Pipeline Corp.<P>

CYCOM tests with both a surrogate and actual SPL were successfully conducted in cooperation with Columbia Aluminum Corporation at our Energy Development Center.  The CYCOM unit destroyed the cyanides in the SPL, captured the fluorides, and produced a benign molten slag discharge while emitting a flue gas stream that contains less than 100 ppm carbon monoxide and 25 ppm total hydrocarbons.  Analyses of the slag indicate that leachability levels are well below proposed EPA limits.  A patent (U.S. Patent No. 5,307,748) has been obtained for this technology development.<P>

<B>Application &amp; Status:</B> <B><I>Waste destruction, recovery, and vitrification.</I></B>  This thermal process is ideal for  gaseous, liquid, or finely-ground solids fuels requiring high destruction efficiencies.  An evaluation center complete with a CYCOM unit is in operation.  Tests funded by industry are in progress.  Recent tests, funded by Gaz de France, successfully demonstrated the vitrification of ash from municipal waste combustors.<P>

<b>Funding:</b> SMP:  $513K<br>
<b>Project Manager:</b> Mark Khinkis<br>
<b>Principal Investigator:</b>  Tian-Yu Xiong<p>

<B>Objective:</B> To develop a natural gas-fired incineration system capable of operating at extreme temperatures.<P>

<B>Description:</B> A radiant, self-recuperative incinerator was assessed mathematically through computer analysis.  Equations were derived to project the operating characteristics of the unit as a function of the major variables using methane fuel.  The results of this modeling effort were used to construct a small, laboratory-scale, proof-of-concept burner.  The well-insulated burner was operated to confirm that temperatures higher than normal adiabatic flame temperature can be obtained.<P>

<B>Results:</B> Tests conducted in the bench-scale burner at chamber temperatures between 2400° and 3750°F did achieve levels 200° to 500°F higher than adiabatic flame temperature based on ambient air combustion. In addition, carbon tetrachloride (PCB surrogate) destruction efficiencies of 99.99998% were demonstrated for a residence time of 40 msec.  Thus, the size of a toxic waste incinerator can be greatly reduced and external air preheating or oxygen enrichment can be eliminated for systems requiring extreme temperatures.  U.S. Patent No. 4,828,481 was issued on May 9, 1989.<P>

As part of the program, a computer-assisted pulse thermometer, capable of measuring extreme gas temperatures, was developed.  This novel device has improved temperature-measuring capabilities and would replace the widely used conventional suction pyrometer.  U.S. Patent No. 5,116,137 was issued on May 26, 1992.<P>

A 1 million Btu/h commercial incineration system has been designed based on the successful bench-scale studies.  An economic evaluation was prepared to assist in the technology transfer to industrial users.<P>

<B>Application &amp; Status:</B> <B><I>Gaseous and liquid hazardous waste destruction.</I></B>  Requires further development,  manufacturing partner, and scale-up to commercial size.  The computer-assisted pulse thermometer requires a distributor.<P>

<b>Funding:</b> SMP:  $179K<br>
<b>Project Manager:</b> Philip Anderson<p>

<B>Objective:</B> To prevent the uncontrolled release of stored fluids such as LNG from bulk storage tanks.<P>

<B>Description:</B> Uncontrolled release to the atmosphere of such fluids creates the hazards of deflagration, detonation, and/or toxic effects both within and outside the plant boundary.  Storage tanks are always provided with automatic pressure relief systems intended to protect the tanks against the possibility of over-pressure.  While vapor venting due to operational errors or rapid changes in barometric pressure is a rather common operational occurrence, relief systems can be overwhelmed.  This has led to catastrophic tank failures and massive releases of liquid.  IGT researchers developed a model of the vaporization process of the fluid based on fundamental considerations.  (Evaporative refrigeration is the mechanism for maintaining the temperature of these stored liquids.)  They also instrumented an existing LNG storage tank and obtained data with which to validate the model..<P>

The model is used in computerized simulations of tank operating situations to determine the conditions under which venting and uncontrolled pressure rises can occur.  From these simulations, techniques for monitoring tank behavior and guidelines for operations are developed.<P>

<B>Results:</B> Both hardware and software are available for obtaining storage tank data.  A computer model has been developed to assist plant operators by providing operating guidelines to prevent the uncontrolled release of stored fluids from LNG tanks.<P>

<b>Funding:</b> SMP:  $631K / GRI:  $300K / U.S. EPA:  $75K<br>
<b>Project Manager:</b> Amir Rehmat<br>
<b>Principal Investigator:</b>  Michael Mensinger<p>

<B>Objective:</B> To develop a two-stage, agglomerating waste combustor (AGGCOM).<P>

<B>Description:</B> The two-stage approach is based on combining IGT's fluidized-bed, agglomerating technology with our cyclonic combustor technology.  The system can operate over a wide range of conditions in the first stage, from low temperature (desorption) to high temperature (agglomeration).  In the combined system, solid, liquid and gaseous organic wastes can be efficiently destroyed, while solid inorganic contaminants are trapped within a glassy surface matrix rendering them environmentally benign and suitable for disposal in ordinary landfills.<P>

The first stage is an agglomerating fluidized-bed reactor, which can operate at substoichiometric conditions or with excess air.  With a unique distribution of natural gas, air and wastes, the bulk of the fluidized-bed is maintained at 1500° to 2000°F, while the central jet temperature can be varied between 2000° to 3000°F.  When the contaminated soil or sludge is fed into the fluidized bed, the combustible fraction undergoes rapid gasification/combustion producing gaseous components.  The solid fraction containing trace metal contaminants undergoes a chemical transformation in the hot zone and is agglomerated into glassy, essentially non-leachable pellets.<P>

The gaseous product leaving the fluidized bed may contain unburned hydrocarbons, dioxins, furans, and CO.  The product gas from the fluidized bed is fed to the second stage where the addition of natural gas raises temperatures to 1800° to 2400°F.  The cyclonic combustor/separator provides sufficient residence time to oxidize all CO and organic compounds to CO<SUB>2</SUB> and water vapor giving a combined DRE greater than 99.99%.  Conventional scrubbing techniques may be required to treat acid gases.<P>

<B>Results:</B> A six-ton/d AGGCOM pilot plant has been constructed at IGT's Energy Development Center with funding from U.S. EPA, GRI, and SMP.  This pilot plant provides a natural gas-based thermal treatment evaluation center for highly contaminated soils and certain industrial wastes.<P>

<B>Application &amp; Status:</B> <B><I>Thermal process for remediation of contaminated soils or sludges.</I></B> Evaluation center is in operation at IGTs Energy Development Center.<P>

<b>Project:</b> 80032<br>
<b>Period:</b> 10/1/94 - 3/31/96<br>
<b>Funding:</b> SMP:  $100K / U.S. EPA:  $150K<br>
<b>Project Manager:</b> Michael Mensinger<p>

<B>Objective:</B> To develop a process that uses a combination of supercritical extraction/liquid-phase oxidation (SELPhO<SUB>x</SUB>) to remove contaminants from soil and destroy the extracted contaminants.<P>

<B>Description:</B> The SELPhO<SUB>x</SUB> process, developed by IGT, combines supercritical extraction of organic contaminants using carbon dioxide with subsequent wet air oxidation to destroy the extracted contaminants.  Extraction of contaminants with carbon dioxide provides a very environmentally benign means of treating the soil.  Furthermore, much of the original soil organic matter tends to remain in place.  It is expected that this process would target hot spots such as soils contaminated with high levels of organic contamination.<P>

Wet air oxidation is a proven commercial process developed by our partner, Zimpro Environmental, Inc.  Unlike combustion techniques, flameless wet air oxidation generates no fly ash, smoke or oxides of sulfur or nitrogen.  Organic sulfur and chloride are converted to H<SUB>2</SUB> SO<SUB>4</SUB> and HCl (or salts) and are processed in the liquid phase.  This work was co-funded by the U.S. EPA.<P>

<B>Results:</B> A small-scale, transportable SELPhOx treatment unit was designed and constructed.  Economic evaluations and laboratory treatment tests were completed.<P>

<B>Application &amp; Status:</B> Highly contaminated soils.  Technology available for evaluation on soils that are  highly contaminated with organic matter.  Economics indicate that application will be limited to hot spots or situations that require a green treatment process.<P>

<CENTER><IMG ALT="Sustaining Membership Program" SRC="SMP3.GIF"></CENTER> <p>

<b>The Mission:</b><BR>

The Sustaining Membership Program (SMP) is a collaborative technology development program that utilizes expert scientific staff and facilities at the Institute of Gas Technology (IGT) and its development partners.  The program aims to sustain for its members a capability to develop new and innovative technology concepts that will build and protect existing natural gas markets, open new markets, and reduce the cost of transmission and distribution operations.<P>

<b>The Need:</b><BR>

Every industry needs technology developments to prosper, and the natural gas industry is no exception.  In recent years, however, market forces have driven manufacturers, developers, and supporting institutions toward <b>near-term</b> deployment of well-developed concepts.  Global competition and capital resource limitations prevent most manufacturers from accepting the risks and  costs associated with the development of new and innovative technologies.  Except for the basic research conducted at universities, there is a missing <b>mid-term</b> link in the development of innovative technologies that will allow the natural gas industry to take advantage of new market and business opportunities and thus compete effectively in tomorrow's market place.<P>

<b>The Solution:</b><BR>

SMP provides the seed funding for such mid-term technology developments, pooling resources from over 50 companies, both U.S. and international.  The projects, under the direct guidance of a single advisory committee from the members, are focused on expanding gas utilization, meeting environmental standards, and reducing the cost of operations for member companies.  Manufacturers are able to participate in early design stages and  examine new technology concepts in sizable experimental facilities before committing the heavy investments necessary for successful market introductions.<P>

<b>Member Benefits:</b><BR>

SMP provides its members with

<UL>
<LI>A highly leveraged mid-term development effort
<LI>Targeted research for market growth and cost reduction
<LI>New products and business opportunities
<LI>Facilities and expertise in selected core areas.<P>
</UL>

<b>Measures of Success:</b><P>

To date, three main areas have been very productive and have provided commercial or near-commercial technologies:  1) Low-NO<sub>x</sub> combustors have already been commercially deployed in the glass melting industry, in power and industrial boilers, and in food processing markets to retain and build load while meeting NO<sub>x</sub> reduction standards.  2) In NGV, many commercial applications in all areas except vehicle engines, have resulted.  These include fueling station designs, meter accuracy determinations and calibration methods, storage cylinder testing and improvements, compressor evaluations, and emission controls.  Both CNG and LNG applications are addressed.  3) Our work on the bioremediation of soils contaminated with heavy hydrocarbons from manufactured gas plants has resulted in successful field demonstrations that will be both low-cost and environmentally preferred to incineration or landfill.<p>

Perhaps the best measure of success is the fact that SMP is in its 11th year, attracting growing support and funding from GRI, DOE, EPRI, and industry to support later stages of development, field trials, and demonstration phases.  This further leverages the seed money from SMP and allows the program to initiate work on new ideas and concepts, thus continuing the process of building a solid technology base for future needs of the gas industry.<p>

<CENTER><b>ACHIEVEMENTS -- TEN YEARS IN REVIEW</b></CENTER><P>

The SMP has been instrumental in building a core competence at IGT in the areas of combustion, bioengineering, and natural gas vehicle deployment.  In addition, staff and research laboratory facilities have been expanded in other areas to address key research issues for the gas industry.  The SMP currently conducts research and develops products to expand markets and reduce costs in seven key areas:<P>

LOW-NO<sub>x</sub> BURNER FOR FIRETUBE BOILERS</CENTER></H3>

<b>Project:</b> 80022<br>
<b>Period:</b> 4/1/91 - Present<br>
<b>Project Manager:</b> <a href="/smp_o/projmgrs.htm#mjr">Michael J. Roberts</a><img src="/smp_o.gif" alt="SMP only" border=0><br>
<b>Principal Investigator:</b> David F. Cygan<p>

<B>Objective:</B> To develop a low emissions cyclonic burner for firetube boilers, the predominant boiler design for commercial and small industrial steam generators.<P>

<B>Description:</B> A premixed, cyclonic burner is being developed for new and retrofit applications to firetube boilers.  Two concepts are being evaluated; a single-stage configuration with diluent and a two-stage configuration.  The goal is to commercialize a cost-effective natural gas-fired burner technology that meets both existing and future regulations without utilizing such expensive options as selective catalytic reduction, flue gas recirculation, or water/steam injection.  The project goal is to limit emissions to <15 vppm NO<SUB>x</SUB> with very low levels of CO and THC over the entire burner turndown range of 4:1.<P>

<A HREF="http://www.burnham.com/">Burnham Corporation</A>, which is the parent company of Kewanee Boiler Company, and Takuma Company, Ltd. of Japan, a major Japanese boiler/burner manufacturer have joined the project team as manufacturing partners and funding contributors.  A technology development agreement has been executed with Takuma.  Co-funding is being provided by Southern California Gas Co.<P>

<B>Status:</B> Test results from a 200-hp (8 x 10<SUP>6</SUP> Btu/h) versatile test burner demonstrated emission levels of <10 vppm NO<SUB>x</SUB>, at 3% O<SUB>2</SUB>, <25 vppm CO, and <5 vppm total hydrocarbons (THC) using a single-stage configuration employing excess air.  The two-stage configuration also provided excellent results.  Emission levels of 15 vppm NO<SUB>x</SUB>, <60 vppm CO, and <5 vppm THC were measured without any diluent injection.<P>

In a joint decision with our manufacturing partners, the single-stage approach has been selected for initial development.  A 250-hp (10.5 x 10<SUP>6</SUP> Btu/h) prototype burner was designed and tested to acquire design data for commercial retrofit burners.  Results confirmed the ability of this burner to achieve all of the project goals.  U.S. Patent No. 5,220,888 has been issued for this novel burner design.<P>

Burnham Corp. has fabricated a commercial retrofit burner for a 250-hp firetube boiler.  They are evaluating this burner at the manufacturing site prior to the scheduled field tests in southern California.  Data show single digit NO<SUB>x</SUB> emissions with very low levels of carbon monoxide.  These data are being obtained without the use of flue gas recirculation.<P>

LOW-NOx <A NAME="BURNER">BURNER</A> FOR WATERTUBE BOILERS</CENTER></H3>
<b>Project:</b> 80029<br>
<b>Period:</b> 6/1/94 - Present<br>
<b>Project Manager:</b> <a href="/smp_o/projmgrs.htm#mjr">Michael J. Roberts</a><img src="/smp_o.gif" alt="SMP only" border=0><br>
<b>Principal Investigator:</b> David F. Cygan<p>

<B>Objective:</B> To develop a low emissions, staged burner for watertube boilers, which represent the large power and industrial steam generation market.<P>

<B>Description:</B> 	A premixed, two-stage burner designed to force internal recirculation of combustion products is being developed.  This then avoids the need for external flue gas recirculation with its associated high capital and maintenance costs.  A unique design brings secondary air either through or around the primary combustion zone and enhances internal recirculation to lower flame temperatures.  This greatly reduces the formation of both thermal and prompt NO<SUB>x</SUB>.  The design also maximizes heat transfer to the process fluid surrounding the combustion zone and, therefore, is ideal for adaptation to water tube boiler designs.<P>

This project receives significant co-funding from U.S. DOE.  Our industrial partner is Detroit Stoker Co., and modeling efforts are provided by George Washington University.<P>

<B>Status:</B> IGT, with both internal and GRI funding, designed, built, and tested an 8 X 10<SUP>6</SUP> Btu/h concept burner. A total of 33 test configurations were evaluated using a boiler simulator at our Energy Development Center.  Refinement of primary-stage combustion parameters has resulted in the formation of less than 1 vppm NO<SUB>x</SUB> in this zone.  Overall NO<SUB>x</SUB> levels of about 12 vppm with very low CO and THC emissions were achieved over a 4-to-1 turndown ratio.  No flue gas recirculation or other diluent injection are required to achieve these low emission levels and, therefore, this burner development promises to provide a solution that minimizes any loss of efficiency.  However, further reductions in emissions can be obtained by adding a diluent.<P>

Our commercialization strategy is to:  1) design, fabricate, and test a 20 x 10<SUP>6</SUP> Btu/h prototype burner at Detroit Stokers research facilities in Monroe, Michigan; and 2) modify and evaluate this prototype burner at a commercial field site.<P>

<b>Project:</b> 80031<br>
<b>Period:</b> 1/17/95 - Present<br>
<b>Project Manager:</b> <a href="/smp_o/projmgrs.htm#ha">Hamid Abbasi</a><img src="/smp_o.gif" alt="SMP only" border=0><br>
<b>Principal Investigator:</b> John Wagner<p>

<B>Objective:</B> To develop a simple, cost-effective retrofit technology to reduce NO<SUB>x</SUB> emissions and increase productivity in natural gas-fired, high-temperature industrial furnaces such as melters, smelters, heat treat furnaces, and calciners.<P>

<B>Description:</B> Oscillating combustion involves the forced, out-of-phase oscillation of the fuel and/or oxidant flow rate(s) to a combustor to create successive, fuel-rich and fuel-lean zones within the flame, thus retarding NO<SUB>x</SUB> formation.<P>

IGT has obtained a patent (U.S. Patent No. 4,946,665) and has teamed with Air Liquide to develop and commercialize this technology.  IGT efforts are focusing on developing air-gas oscillating combustion systems, while Air Liquide, with substantial in-kind co-funding, is focusing on developing oxy-gas oscillating combustion and will lead field evaluations on a commercial oxy-gas-fired glass tank.  Another team member, CeramPhysics, Inc., is developing a solid-state proportioning valve (SSPV) for application to oscillating combustion.<P>

This strategic collaboration project is co-funded by Columbia Gas Distribution Companies, GRI, Gas Technology Canada, and Southern California Gas Company.<P>

Recently, additional co-funding from the U.S. Department of Energy ($650,000) has made possible an expanded program to test oscillating combustion on a wide variety of industrial burners.  In particular, applications will focus on the steel industry.<P>

<B>Status:</B> IGT has constructed a 250,000 Btu/h test facility for air-gas oscillating combustion tests at its Applied Combustion Research Laboratory.  Air Liquide has modified its 1 MMBtu/h oxy-gas test furnace at its Countryside, IL research center for further development of oxy-gas oscillating combustion.  CeramPhysics has scaled up its valve for the size-ranges needed in the test programs.  Recent air-gas oscillating combustion testing at IGT has shown up to 65% and 75% reductions in NO<SUB>x</SUB> emissions with ambient and preheated air, respectively.  In addition, heat transfer increases of up to 10% have been observed.  Heat transfer increases lead to increased furnace productivity.  Air Liquide obtained similar results with oxy-gas combustion.<P>

INERT BASE GAS FOR NATURAL GAS STORAGE FIELDS</CENTER></H3>
<b>Project:</b> 80007<br>
<b>Period:</b> 10/1/85 - Present<br>
<b>Project Manager:</b> <a href="/smp_o/projmgrs.htm#brm">Brij R. Misra</a><img src="/smp_o.gif" alt="SMP only" border=0><p>

<B>Objective:</B> Demonstrate the use of inert base gas as a viable alternative for reducing the cost of underground natural gas storage.<P>

<B>Description:</B> In cooperation with GRI, IGT researchers are using inert gas in underground natural gas storage fields to reduce base gas cost.  The project consists of three phases:  1) laboratory studies on inert and natural gas mixing properties in underground storage media, 2) a field demonstration on a storage field, and 3) technology transfer efforts toward wide-scale implementation.<P>

<B>Status:</B> Field experience obtained from France, where inert gas has successfully replaced a part of base gas requirements in underground gas storage fields, suggests that this approach is feasible.  Laboratory tests on a number of cores from storage fields in the United States and France, representing different rock types and covering a wide range of porosity and permeability distribution, have been completed and have verified that mixing of natural gas and inert gas is generally limited to a very narrow zone.  This allows replacement of base gas with a lower cost inert gas.  A systematic approach consisting of site selection, data evaluation, modeling, and implementation planning has been developed to select candidate storage fields and minimize the risk of gas mixing during inert gas application.<P>

Current work is focused on a field demonstration in the Shirley storage field, operated by Equitrans.  The inert gas injection target area has been selected.  Reservoir modeling to characterize the storage reservoir and predict long-term storage operations in the presence of inert gas has been completed.  The long-term (20 years) predictive model runs indicated that a significant portion of the base gas can be replaced with nitrogen without jeopardizing the pipeline quality of withdrawal gas.  In addition, inert gas injection in the Shirley field would prove beneficial in terms of cutting down natural gas migration.  <P>

Equitrans has filed an application with FERC for permission to inject inert gas in the Shirley field.  FERC approval was received during the summer of 1996.  After about one year of natural gas withdrawals from the target area, injection of nitrogen can begin in late 1997.  Plans are to initially inject 300 MMCF of nitrogen representing 5% of the total base gas.<P>

<b>Principal Investigators:</b> Marek Czachorski, Ken Kountz, William Ryan<p>

<B>Objective:</B> To assess, design, and test  new concepts for natural gas cooling systems.<P>

<B>Description:</B> The goal of this project is to evaluate new gas cooling concepts designed to offer a significant improvement in overall efficiency and to reduce the cost of gas cooling equipment.<P>

<B>Status:</B> We have completed work on a seasonal heat pump analysis computer program that analyzes the effectiveness of using mixed refrigerants which are being considered by the HVAC industry as replacements for R22.  We also investigated the advantages of using spray absorbers in lithium bromide absorption systems.  This year, studies will be expanded to directly address applications of the spray concept to the triple-effect system being developed by Trane.<P>

	Currently, we are completing the assessment of advancements in desiccant and sensible heat exchange matrices, the two most important and expensive components of desiccant cooling and dehumidifying machines.  We have completed the evaluation of 14 candidate products obtained from American, European, and Japanese manufacturers and developers.  We have also estimated the expected equipment cost reductions for the most promising new products.  Our studies were supplemented by experimental evaluation of materials and matrices.  Multi-dimensional performance maps were developed for four commercially-available matrices.  <P>

	A fully automated and computerized test stand was built at IGTs Energy Development Center to obtain the data needed for these design optimization studies and performance evaluations.  A computer simulation program for desiccant cooling systems (DES3) was developed.  The program contains empirical performance maps of the four best matrices, and allows for "what if" analysis of desiccant cooling system configurations.  DES3 is being made available to manufacturers and to the interested SMP members.<P>

SYSTEM FOR UPGRADING SUBQUALITY NATURAL GAS</CENTER></H3>

<b>Project:</b> 80018<br>
<b>Period:</b> 4/1/90 - Present<br>
<b>Project Manager:</b> <a href="/smp_o/projmgrs.htm#rp">Raj Palla</a><img src="/smp_o.gif" alt="SMP only" border=0><p>

<B>Objective:</B> To reduce the cost of upgrading subquality natural gas by developing cost-effective solvents and absorption systems.<P>

<B>Description:</B> Essentially all of the natural gas in the United States is treated, to some degree, prior to its introduction into the pipeline system for transportation to the consumer.  This GRI-coordinated project focuses on the commercialization of a physical solvent, N-Formyl-Morpholine (NFM) and includes efforts to obtain laboratory/bench-scale experimental data, conduct computer simulations, and perform field experimentation.  NFM treatment capabilities are being evaluated for various gas-liquid contacting systems including random packing and structured packing configurations.  Huntsman Specialty Chemical Company (formerly Texaco Chemical), Koch Engineering Company, Inc., and Krupp Uhde GmbH are industrial participants in this program.  U.S. DOE/METC is also providing coordinated funding on this program.<P>

<B>Status:</B> Bench-scale equipment has been used to evaluate NFM, commercial solvents, and solvent additives, and to collect vapor-liquid equilibrium data (over 1,000 experimentally obtained data points), mass-transfer rate data, solvent stability data, corrosion data, and auto-refrigeration (Joule-Thomson effect) data.  These experimental data have been combined with limited available literature information to model solvent performance in gas sweetening applications using ASPEN Plus Process Simulation Software.<P>

Computer simulations using 9% and 37% total acid gas content were conducted for both NFM and a commercial physical solvent.  Economic comparisons with the commercial solvent show a 5% to 25% reduction in circulation rates, and a 40% to 50% reduction in refrigeration duty.  Also, 75 times more C<SUB>3</SUB>H<SUB>8</SUB> and 30 times more C<SUB>4</SUB>H<SUB>10</SUB> remain with the natural gas stream when NFM is used.  This results in a higher Btu sales gas and reduced off-gas processing requirements.  We estimate that installation of an NFM system will save up to 15% in total construction costs and 40% to 50% annually in operating costs.<P>

Test results from a 1 MMSCFD pilot plant absorption unit operating at Shell's Fandango facility (15% acid gas concentration) indicate that the use of NFM as a treating solvent is extremely effective.  To date, a total of forty-three (43) tests at a range of conditions have been completed.<P>

Tests with structured packing will begin in October 1996.  The structured packing should provide greater absorption, higher capacity, more flexibility and lower pressure drop -- all of which promises to further improve the potential savings.<P>

IGT and Krupp Uhde GmbH have concluded an agreement which offers this technology to potential users worldwide.<P>

<b>Principal Investigator:</b> Joe McCarty<p>

<B>Objective:</B> To develop a wireless system for reading cathodic protection currents and voltages using a buried, low-cost transponder and sacrificial anode.<P>

<B>Description:</B> Cathodic protection test points are often difficult to access in urban environments.  They can be paved over or otherwise lost because of construction activities.  The goal of this project is to develop a wireless, buried monitor that can be activated during a walk-by or drive-by using an electronic package.  Anode current, steady-state cathodic protection potential, and instant-off cathodic protection potentials will be measured.  Potential measurements will be referenced to a permanently buried copper-copper sulfate electrode.<P>

Development of this approach should significantly improve productivity and reduce the cost of cathodic protection monitoring.  The buried transponder will return a radio frequency signal or echo to ground level.  The project examines methods of modifying the frequency and/or duration of the returning RF echo to encode the desired information.  After developing a successful proof-of-concept unit, prototype transponders will be constructed for longer-term testing.  A prototype of the operator electronics will also be constructed, and will be portable, battery-operated and sufficiently robust for field testing.  Field tests will be carried out at Brooklyn Union Gas, the co-sponsor.<P>

<B>Status:</B> IGT has reviewed commercially available technology for tagging plastic pipe and has adapted this device for acquiring cathodic protection data.  Breadboard units based on low-cost digital microcontrolleers have been bench tested.  We have shown that current from the sacrificial anode in conjunction with low voltage technologies can provide a viable long-term power supply.  Prototypes are currently being prepared for field testing.<P>

<b>Principal Investigator:</b> Henry Modetz<p>

<B>Objective:</B> Increase the market share of natural gas as a transportation fuel through the further development of dedicated natural gas-fueled vehicle technology.<P>

<B>Description:</B> The current focus of this coordinated GRI research project is to reduce the cost of NGV fueling stations through the assessment, testing and development of state-of-the-art fueling station components and systems.  This systems approach includes compressor, dispenser meter, control concepts, and related safety evaluations, as well as the development of support software and economic data.  Advanced gas storage concepts have also been evaluated experimentally to determine operating capacity, system requirements, and on-board system performance.<P>

<B>Status:</B> The initial phases of this program involved the investigation of methane adsorption at modest pressures for low pressure vehicle storage systems.  The most promising of these adsorbents in terms of potential storage volume and costs are high-surface-area activated carbons.  The major technical challenge is the availability of effective, low-cost carbons.<P>

A computer-controlled fueling station, designed by IGT, is being used to evaluate compressor/cascade systems and also provides high pressure gas to the adjacent high pressure/high flow rate meter test facility.  This laboratory is used to evaluate and develop existing and emerging NGV fueling station technologies and components.  During initial testing, IGT identified an operational limitation for a Coriolis-type flow meter commonly used in NGV dispenser applications.  In response, the manufacturer developed a new design and IGT was contracted to verify its performance.  A prototype turbine meter which performed well in recent testing has the potential to substantially reduce dispenser meter costs.  Under the current program, IGT continues to evaluate other meter designs.  A total of eight commercial and prototype flow meters are being evaluated based on accuracy, initial cost and maintenance to determine the most cost-effective meter.<P>

Other ongoing tasks include the evaluation of compressor packages and residential fueling appliances; the development and deployment of a natural gas engine-driven compressor package for fueling medium-duty NGV fleets; the release of improved versions of "Cascade," a fueling station simulation software package used for sizing the compressor/cascade for given fleet requirements; the release of "Bid Spec," a fueling station specification tool, and the study of LNG odorization and safety issues for vehicle applications.<P>

<b>Principal Investigator:</b> Dr. Joseph M. Katz<p>

<B>Objective:</B> To goal of this project is to develop improved field-applied coatings and application methods for pipeline girth welds and repair sites that provide significant pipeline life-cycle cost savings.<P>

<B>Description:</B> The focus is on the development of a technique that uses a unique combination of a solvent-free epoxy or epoxy-urethane primer overcoated with a specially formulated plastic flamecoat.  The technical work addresses three areas:  application of plastic flamecoats over liquid thermoset primers, laboratory testing and evaluation of promising primer/plastic flamecoat systems, and field trials of the selected dual coatings on large-diameter pipes.  The coating materials and flamecoat applicators chosen for this study are all commercial products, and are being examined for the best combination of performance and ease of application.<P>

<B>Status:</B> A laboratory has been set up complete with grit blasting, flame coating, and disbondment testing capabilities.  Evaluation of various coating formulations and procedures is under way using modified cathodic disbondment tests to screen samples for durability.  A coating system showing excellent resistance to cathodic disbondment at ambient temperatures has been identified and is currently being evaluated by an independent laboratory.  The laboratory investigation has been redirected to concentrate more effort on developing a high temperature coating system with properties that complement our ambient temperature systems.  An advisory panel is being formed to help guide the project.  A subcontract has been negotiated with NICOR Technologies, Inc. to provide training and support for the field trials.<P>

<B>Objective:</B> To develop expert systems and related technology for productivity improvements in the gas industry.<P>

<B>Description:</B> Efforts are focused on developing an advisory/training application, LeakView, that will assist or train field crews engaged in leak investigations.  LeakView will assist field personnel in determining the class of a leak and aims to reduce costs by automating procedures and data collection.  Based upon the definitions for leak classes used by participating natural gas utilities, operative rules have been identified and verified using an expert system program.<P>

<B>Status:</B> Documentation received from several natural gas utilities was used to develop the basic information categories needed to address leak classification.  Interviews and field observations of utility crews were conducted.  This provided additional information that is considered when determining the classification of a leak, but which is not part of the general company procedures and published guidelines.  This data represents expert knowledge and is being used to modify the rules in the LeakView computer program.<P>

A framework for the expert system has been developed to accept information in a format that leak surveyors use (for example, location of leak, distance to nearest structure, type of ground covering).  The user interface reflects the operating modes of a commonly used leak detector (flame ionization/combustible gas indicator) for ease of understanding by the operator.<P>

Interviews with an industry consultant and initial demonstrations for utility personnel have revealed a subclassification system regarding the maximum time before repair and the frequency of leak rechecking in the field.  Over 230 rules have been specified, relating location, magnitude, paving, and migration potential to leak class, recheck frequency, and repair time.  Additional rules address the overall size of leaks and unusual situations such as leaks near special structures.<P>

The LeakView software has been upgraded to run in a Windows format.  The upgrade allows the user to incorporate a sketch of the leak site and any accompanying data using on-screen forms.  These changes are designed to provide a friendly user interface for subsequent field evaluations.  A rugged, pen-based, hand-held computer has been selected for this application and demonstration copies of the LeakView software are available for member companies.  The pen-based computers can be supplied at cost.<P>

<b>Principal Investigator:</b> Christopher J. Ziolkowski<p>

<B>Objective:</B> To develop improved acoustic field instruments by applying microprocessor-based, digital signal processing (DSP) techniques.<P>

<B>Description:</B> Initial activities are concentrating on the development of a digital sonic leak pinpointer for pounds pressure systems.  It is estimated that the development of an efficient leak pinpointer using DSP techniques could reduce gas company operating costs by avoiding dry holes and recalls due to secondary leaks.  In addition, the same basic software/hardware can be adapted to other instruments, and should reduce implementation costs and improve the prospects for commercial success.  One application being investigated with the help of TRANSOCEANIC, St. Petersburg, Russia, is a leak and tamper detection and alert system for transmission piping.  Other potential instrument applications include plastic pipe location and data analysis for robotic sensors.<P>

The DSP techniques for adaptive filtering are effective in minimizing continuous, non-leak background signals.  These techniques have the advantage of adapting to the continuous background signals at a work site.  If this noise changes, the adaptive filter automatically changes in response.  Adaptive filtering is also effective at removing periodic noises, such as 60 Hz and its harmonics.  When combined with signal gating, adaptive filtering substantially improves an instrument's ability to pinpoint gas leaks.  Signal gating is a method of minimizing loud intermittent background noise, including traffic noise.  A patent (U.S. Patent No. 4,455,863) has been obtained for the apparatus and process.<P>

<B>Status:</B> The overall sensitivity of the sonic leak pinpointer has been improved by the combination of new commercially available sensors and improved noise rejection provided by DSP adaptive filtering.  These changes also permit an increase in spacing between probe mounted sensors.<P>

The digital sonic leak pinpointer has been packaged for field trials using commercially available hardware.  The DSP, amplifier and analog filter boards are installed in an industrial-grade portable computer chassis (10-in. x 12-in. x 16-in.).  Five laboratory instruments used in the initial development work have been eliminated by using commercially available PC circuit boards.  Software was written to accommodate these changes.  Field trials began in January 1995.  Initial results are very encouraging.  Leak detection is being demonstrated with widely spaced barholes (5 feet apart) in urban locations.  The current version of the hardware can use 2 to 4 sensors.  Our field tests demonstrated that the 2-sensor mode has operational advantages that outweigh the incremental improvement in noise rejection given by 3 or 4 sensors.  The 2-sensor mode is faster to deploy in the field and reduces the cost of the unit.  We are presently building several units for controlled deployment at several U.S. and foreign member companies.<P>

<b>Project:</b> 80014<br>
<b>Period:</b> 10/1/86 - Present<br>
<b>Project Manager:</b> <a href="/smp_o/projmgrs.htm#vjs">Vipul J. Srivastava</a><img src="/smp_o.gif" alt="SMP only" border=0><br>
<b>Principal Investigators:</b> J. Robert Paterek, John J. Kilbane<p>

<B>Objective:</B> To develop, demonstrate and implement cost-effective strategies for the remediation of former manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites.<P>

<B>Description:</B> This program, coordinated with significant funding by GRI and industry, focuses on the development, demonstration, and deployment of an integrated biological/chemical process, referred to as the MGP-REM Process, for degrading polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).  Biological treatment of contaminated soils reduces the level of biodegradable PAHs (mostly 2- and 3-ring compounds).  Recalcitrant PAHs (predominantly 4- to 6-ring compounds) are then subjected to chemical treatment for further oxidation to biodegradable intermediates which are then destroyed during the subsequent biological treatment.<P>

<B>Status:</B> This technology is available for site remediation using the slurry reactor or landfarming modes.  Research is continuing on in-situ applications.  The soil treatment cost for landfarming is estimated to range between $30 to $60 per cubic yard.  The treatment cost for slurry phase methods is estimated to range between $45 to $85 per cubic yard.  As a result of successful field experiments and favorable economics, our MGP-REM Process has been selected for full-scale remediation at one site and is being considered for another site.  Bioremediation methods, such as MGP-REM, are among the three presumptive methods recommended for PAH-contaminated soil by the U.S. EPA.  Recently, several MGP site soils with PAH levels as high as 10,000 ppm were subjected to treatability testing.  Bench- and field-scale results show that our integrated treatment method can degrade PAHs at a faster rate and to a greater extent than conventional bioremediation.  Field experiments have shown that our treatment result in approximately 95% degradation of total PAHs.  Soils are thus converted to a non-toxic state.  Similarly, soil slurry test results show that the treated soils can meet stringent state clean-up guidance standards.<P>

In-situ application of the MGP-REM process is now the primary research focus.  The in-situ mode is expected to further reduce treatment costs and should be favored by regulatory agencies and the public.  We are studying direct injection techniques using vertical and horizontal wells, as well as the use of foam fluids to deliver chemicals and bioactivity-stimulating nutrients to the targeted area.  In the laboratory, direct injection with mechanical mixing resulted in a greater than 95% degradation of PAHs.  Addition of non-aqueous fluid-based foams can result in 99% degradation of PAHs. <P>

<body>

The Acoustic Pipe Locator works by putting a series of sound bursts 
into the pipe to be located. These sound pulses travel 
down the length of the pipe and into the surrounding soil.  Sensors on the ground detect the pulses and record their arrival time.  The microprocessor calculates the position of the pipe relative to the sensors based on the difference in arrival time of each pulse.

<b>Project:</b> 80026<br>
<b>Period:</b> 10/1/91 - Present<br>
<b>Project Manager:</b> <a href="/smp_o/projmgrs.htm#rlk">Robert L. Kelley</a><img src="/smp_o.gif" alt="SMP only" border=0><p>

<B>Objective:</B> To demonstrate the technical and economic advantages of an integrated chemical and biological treatment process for treating PCB-contaminated soil and water.<P>

<B>Description:</B> The process combines two remedial techniques:  1) treatment using chemical reagents and 2) biological treatment using aerobic and/or anaerobic biosystems either in sequence or alone, depending on the waste.  The process is applicable to remediation of soils and liquids containing both low and high waste concentrations.  Applicable matrices include soil, sludges, groundwater, and surface water.  This project has received funding from GRI, SMP, and industry.<P>

<B>Status:</B> Results have shown that a significant fraction of PCBs can be directly mineralized (i.e., completely destroyed) to CO<SUB>2</SUB> in a single cycle of chemical and biological treatment.  In our treatment process, PCBs are modified, in a pretreatment step, to a water soluble, as well as more easily biodegradable product using chemical reagents.  This product is then completely destroyed in the subsequent biological treatment step.  Such complete degradation of PCBs should eliminate any future liability associated with transporting or storing the treated material.<P>

In aqueous environments, chemical treatment alone can remove more than 99% of the PCBs.  However, in PCB-contaminated soils, our process is much more effective than conventional bioremediation in removing PCB compounds.  We have developed improved biological cultures that increase the total remediation efficiency and that destroy up to 95% of some PCB congeners.  In addition, proprietary surfactants have been developed to increase the availability of PCBs for chemical and biological degradation.  Soil samples treated in a laboratory slurry reactor, using our microbes and surfactants, showed reductions from 380 ppm PCB to 5 ppm PCB in 10 days, and to less than 2 ppm in 20 days.<P>

We are currently developing in-situ application methods that will treat both near surface and subsurface PCB contamination without excavation.  This will comply with TSCA regulations and should greatly reduce treatment costs.  Suitable field demonstration sites are currently being evaluated.<P>

<b>Principal Investigators:</b> David Rue<p>

<B>Objective:</B> To develop an advanced natural-gas-fired, high-temperature melting and/or fixation process.<P>

<B>Description:</B> Submerged combustion melting is a natural gas-fired combustion technology with applications in a wide range of industries.  Natural gas and oxidants are fired into and under the surface of a bath of melted material.  Combustion products bubbling through the bath create turbulence which provides very effective heat transfer and enhances melt homogeneity.  The overall gas temperature is reduced, and NO<SUB>x</SUB> formation is consequently lower.  The thermal efficiency of the melter is also increased by the combustion of any organic material in the melt.  Producing a melt by this process has significant cost and operating advantages over other high-temperature melting methods.  U.S. Patent No. 4,877,449 has been issued.<P>

<B>Status:</B> A 500 lb/h submerged combustion melter is being constructed at IGTs Energy Development Center.  The unit will initially be used to produce cement from contaminated estuarine sediments, ash residues and cement kiln dust.  Thus, this process can be used to convert waste materials into useful products such as cement, allowing natural gas to penetrate a production process that is primarily coal-fired.  Discussions are also underway for application of the submerged combustion technology to the production of mineral wool and glass (sodium silicate, fiber, etc.).<P>

<h3>INERT BASE GAS TECHNOLOGY GETS GO-AHEAD IN THE U.S.</h3>

CHICAGO ---  Equitrans, Inc., Gas Research Institute (GRI), and Institute of Gas Technology (IGT) announced today that Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has issued an Order approving the proposed Inert Base Gas Field Experiment at Equitrans' Shirley Storage Field located in Tyler and Doddridge Counties, West Virginia.  This field experiment -- to be undertaken as a part of the overall research effort cosponsored by Equitrans, GRI, and IGT's Sustaining Membership Program (SMP) -- is designed to demonstrate the technical feasibility and economic viability of replacing a portion of the base (or cushion) natural gas in storage reservoirs with an inert gas.  Specifically, the Order authorizes Equitrans to withdraw up to 400 million cubic feet (MMcf) of base natural gas from its Shirley storage reservoir and to replace the base gas by injecting 300 MMcf of nitrogen.<p>

The proposed field experiment will span a 3-year period and will not result in a physical enlargement of the Shirley reservoir.  According to the implementation plan developed by IGT, base natural gas will be withdrawn from the reservoir for the first year of the approved field experiment.  During years two and three, base gas will continue to be withdrawn from the reservoir, while the nitrogen is concurrently injected.  According to Equitrans, the potential benefits to the public of this project are significant given the readily transferable nature of the inert base gas technology to Equitrans' other storage reservoirs and to other storage operators in the industry.  In particular, start-up costs for new storage facilities could be dramatically reduced by using an inert gas, such as nitrogen, in place of more expensive natural gas for cushioning.<p>

In 1986, GRI and IGT/SMP initiated a research effort to develop a systematic approach that could be applied by the U.S. gas industry to implement the use of inert base gas into its storage fields.  Prior to selecting the Shirley reservoir as a candidate for the field experiment, IGT conducted exploratory "tracer" testing, which consisted of the deliberate mixing of storage gas with argon.  The concentration profile obtained from this test identified a potential target zone for inert gas injection.  Furthermore, comprehensive reservoir modeling was conducted to predict the long-term behavior of the Shirley reservoir under alternative scenarios.  The results of IGT's reservoir modeling and analysis led to the development and design of the field experiment approved by the FERC Order.<p>

A comprehensive risk assessment has also been conducted to quantify the potential risk of the field experiment and to identify alternative mitigation options.   This analysis indicates that the likelihood of nitrogen moving away from the low-pressure inert gas zone and toward the high-pressure area containing the working gas is between 0.1 and 1.0 percent.  Mitigation options include nitrogen withdrawal upon detection at any of the injection/observation wells, reversal of the flow of nitrogen, blending with natural gas, and separation of nitrogen from the natural gas after withdrawal.<p>

Equitrans, Inc., is an Appalachian-based subsidiary of Equitable Resources, Inc. (ERI).  ERI is a full-service energy company.  It offers energy solutions to wholesale and retail markets with innovative products and services developed through its exploration, production, storage, transportation, and distribution of natural gas and electricity operations.  ERI is also engaged in the production of liquids and crude oil.<p>

GRI, headquartered in Chicago, manages a cooperative research, development, and commercialization program for the mutual benefit of the natural gas industry and its customers.  GRI works with research organizations and manufacturers to develop gas technologies and to transfer new products and information to the marketplace.<p>

IGT, headquartered in Des Plaines, IL, is an independent, not-for-profit center for energy- and environment-related technology development and education.  Founded in 1941, its primary functions are to perform sponsored research, development, and demonstration work for industry and government; provide educational programs and services; disseminate scientific and technical information; undertake the technical and economic evaluation of energy systems; and offer strategic planning and business decision support services to its Members and industrial clients.<p>

</H3>
<BR>
<HR>El Nino is a disruption of the ocean-atmosphere system in the tropical
Pacific having important consequences for weather around the globe. Among
these consequences are increased rainfall across the southern tier of the
US and in Peru, which has caused destructive flooding, and drought in the
west Pacific, sometimes associated with devastating brush fires in Australia.
Observations of conditions in the tropical Pacific are considered essential
for the prediction of short term (a few months to 1 year) climate variations.
To provide necessary data, NOAA operates a network of buoys which measure
temperature, currents and winds in the equatorial band. These buoys daily
transmit data which are available to researchers and forecasters around
the world in real time.

<H4><CENTER>(a)Schematic diagram of normal and El Nino conditions in the
Pacific Ocean,<BR>
and (b) wind and temperature on the Equator at 110W </CENTER>
</H4>
In normal, non-El Nino conditions (top panel of schematic diagram), the
trade winds blow towards the west across the tropical Pacific. These winds
pile up warm surface water in the west Pacific, so that the sea surface
is about 1/2 meter higher at Indonesia than at Ecuador. The sea surface
temperature is about 8 degrees C higher in the west, with cool temperatures
off South America, due to an upwelling of cold water from deeper levels.
This cold water is nutrient-rich, supporting high levels of primary productivity,
diverse marine ecosystems, and major fisheries. Rainfall is found in rising
air over the warmest water, and the east Pacific is relatively dry. The
observations at 110 W (left diagram of 110 W conditions) show that the cool
water (below about 17 degrees C, the black band in these plots) is within
50m of the surface. <BR>
<BR>
During El Nino (bottom panel of the schematic diagram), the trade winds
relax in the central and western Pacific leading to a depression of the
thermocline in the eastern Pacific, and an elevation of the thermocline
in the west. The observations at 110W show, for example, that during 1982-1983,
the 17-degree isotherm dropped to about 150m depth. This reduced the efficiency
of upwelling to cool the suface and cut off the supply of nutrient rich
thermocline water to the euphotic zone. The result was a rise in sea surface
temperature and a drastic decline in primary productivity, the latter of
which adversely affected higher trophic levels of the food chain, including
commercial fisheries in this region. The weakening of easterly tradewinds
during El Nino is evident in this figure as well. Rainfall follows the warm
water eastward, with associated flooding in Peru and drought in Indonesia
and Australia. The eastward displacement of the atmospheric heat source
overlaying the warmest water results in large changes in the global atmospheric
circulation, which in turn force changes in weather in regions far removed
from the tropical Pacific. <BR>

<H4><CENTER>(a) January 1991 (a normal year), and (b) January 1992 (an El
Nino Year). </CENTER>
</H4>
El Nino can be seen in measurements of the sea surface temperature, such
as those shown above, which were made from the TAO Array of moored ATLAS
buoys and PROTEUS buoys. In January 1991, the sea surface temperatures and
the winds were near normal, with warm water in the Western Pacfic Ocean
(in red on the top panel of January 1991 plot), and cool water, called the
&quot;cold tongue&quot; in the Eastern Pacific Ocean (in green on the top
panel of the January 1991 plot). The winds in the Western Pacific are very
weak (see the arrows pointing in the direction the wind is blowing towards),
and the winds in the Eastern Pacific are blowing towards the west (towards
Indonesia). The bottom panel of the January 1991 plot shows anomalies, the
way the sea surface temperature and wind differs from a normal January.
In this plot, the anomalies are very small (yellow/green), indicating a
normal January. <BR>
<BR>
January 1992 was the peak of an El Nino year. In January 1992, the warm
water (red in the top panel of the January 1992 plot) has spread from the
western Pacific Ocean towards the east (in the direction of South America),
the &quot;cold tongue&quot; (green color in the top panel of the January
1992 plot) has weakened, and the winds in the western Pacific, usually weak,
are blowing strongly towards the east, pushing the warm water eastward.
The anomalies show clearly that the water in the center of Pacific Ocean
is much warmer (red) than in a normal January. <BR>
<HR>
<H4><CENTER><A HREF="TAO_SST_Wind.mpeg">An animation of El Nino</A></CENTER>
</H4>
As you view this animation, you will see the warm water spreading from the
western Pacific to the eastern Pacific during 1991. The bottom panel in
the animation, labeled anomalies, shows how much the sea surface temperature
for each month is different from the long term average for that month. The
red color in the anomalies plot indicates that the temperature of the water
is much warmer than is normal for that month. Blue color indicates that
the water is much cooler than is normal for that month.

<HR><BR>
<H4><CENTER>Several recent El Ninos can be seen in Pacific Sea Surface Temperature</CENTER>
</H4>
In the left hand panel, you see the sea surface temperature at the Equator
in the Pacific Ocean (Indonesia is towards the left, South America is towards
the right). Time is increasing downwards from 1986 at the top of the plot,
to the present, at the bottom of the plot. The first thing to note is the
blue &quot;scallops&quot; on the right of the plot, in the eastern Pacific.
These indicate the cool water typically observed in the Eastern Pacific
(called the &quot;cold tongue&quot;). Cold tongue temperatures vary seasonally,
being warmest in the northern hemisphere springtime and coolest in the northern
hemisphere fall. The red color on the left is the warm pool of water typically
observed in the western Pacific Ocean. El Nino is an exaggeration of the
usual seasonal cycle. During the El Nino in<BR>
1986-1987, you can see the warm water (red) penetrating eastward in the
Spring of 1987. There is another El Nino in 1991-1992, and you can see the
warm water penetrating towards the east in the northern hemisphere spring
of 1992. <BR>

</H4>
El Nino years are easier to see in the anomalies on the right hand panel.
The anomalies show how much the sea surface temperature is different from
the usual value for each month. Water temperatures significantly warmer
than the norm are shown in red, and water temperatures cooler than the norm
are shown in blue. In the right-hand plot of sea surface temperature anomalies,
it is very easy to see El Nino's, with water warmer than usual (red) in
the eastern Pacific, during in 1986-1987, 1991-1992, 1993 and 1994. Notice
the very cool water (blue), in the Eastern Pacific, in 1988-1989. This is
a La Nina, which occurs after some (but not all) El Nino years. It is unusual
for El Ninos to occur in such rapid succession, as has been the case during
1990-1994. <BR>
<BR>
It is possible that 1995 may also be an El Nino year. You can read the U.S.
National Meteorological Center's El Nino Advisory for this month, and you
can look at the present conditions in the tropical Pacific, as measured
by NOAA's TAO network of moored buoys.

<H3><CENTER>What are the effects of increasing carbon dioxide concentrations
in the earth's atmosphere on climate?<BR>
<IMG SRC="CO2_patterns.gif" WIDTH="534" HEIGHT="403" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"

</H3>
This question has not yet been answered, and is the focus of considerable
current research. Since we are currently altering the concentration of carbon
dioxide in the atmosphere and will certainly continue to do so, we want
to be able to predict what the effect will be. Making these predictions
involves two steps: understanding the processes that make the present climate,
and modeling these processes under scenarios of increased atmospheric CO2
in order to make predictions. Ocean circulation is one of the processes
that affects climate. For example, if the Gulf Stream were to stop flowing
the climate in England would be similar to Siberia. England and Siberia
are at similar latitudes, and the warm waters of the Gulf Stream cause the
climate in England. Since it is not possible to experiment on the scale
of the earth, we use models to predict what will happen as the concentration
of CO2 increases. Several models have been developed to simulate increasing
CO2, and what affects this will have on the Earth's climate. Unfortunately
models are not perfect and they make assumptions. Models can only make predictions.
They can not tell us what will happen. However, a model's accuracy may be
assessed by comparing its predictions with observed patterns.<BR>

The global coupled Atmosphere-Ocean Model (Russell et al. 1995) was designed
for climate predictions at decade to century time scales. Atmospheric source
terms are similar to those of Hansen et al. (1983). Advection of heat, water
vapor and salt uses the linear upstream scheme (Russell and Lerner, 1981).
The ocean model conserves mass, allows for divergent flow, and has a free
upper surface. Atmospheric and ocean surface fluxes are of opposite sign
and are applied synchronously. Flux corrections are not used.<BR>
<BR>
The coupled Atmosphere-Ocean Model was used to generate a 74-year control
simulation with constant atmospheric composition and a 74-year simulation
with compounded 1% annual increases of atmospheric carbon dioxide. The results
of these two simulations are being used by United Nations Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) for their Second Scientific Assessment of
Climate Change, which is due at the end of 1995.<BR>

it on a space available basis only. Please contact Deborah Kaska as soon as possible - see 
addresses below. </p>
<p>3. Laboratory Manuals are sold in the UCSB Bookstore and the IV bookstore. The 
Laboratory Manual will be required for the laboratory. You should bring the manual with 
you to the first laboratory session <b>Complete Pre-Lab Worksheet #1 in the manual 
before coming to your first lab!! </b>. You will not need a separate laboratory notebook. 
The schedule inside the front cover is for 1995. In lab you will be given an updated 1996 
schedule. </p>

<p>This discussion section is designed for students in the honors program and for students 
interested in a more in-depth introduction to research in biology at UCSB. The honors 
section does not review course material. Students participating in the honors section will 
write two papers during the quarter. </p>
<hr>
<p><a name="Students repeating Biology 4A"><b>Students repeating Biology 4A</b></a><b>: </b>If you passed the lab the first time you took the course, 
you will not repeat the laboratory portion of Biology 4A even though you are enrolled in a 
laboratory section. You do not need to attend the lab and your grade this time will be 
based entirely on your lecture exams. Please<b><i> contact Dr. Kaska if do not know whether 
or not you passed the lab.</i></b> </p>

<p><a name="Video playback of Bio 4 lectures:"><b>Video playback of Bio 4 lectures:</b></a><b> </b>The lectures in Biology 4 are taped and replayed 
every Sunday afternoon in Broida 1610 from 1-5pm. The Monday lecture will be shown at 
1, Tuesday's lecture at 2 etc. This will begin October 6. This is the only time these tapes 
will be available. The tapes may not be checked out individually and are not available in 
Kerr Hall. </p>
<hr>
<p><a name="Academic Honesty"><b>Academic Honesty</b></a><b>:</b> Read and heed! Examinations in this course will be completed on 
Scantron forms which are graded electronically. An exam submitted for regrading will be 
compared to the electronic copy of the original. This is done to enable fair and accurate 
assignment of credit. Altering an examination with the intention of obtaining additional points 
is a violation of university policy. <b>Without exception,</b> students who submit altered exams 
for regrading, who submit plagiarized material, or who violate any university policy relating 
to academic integrity will be brought before the Student-Faculty Committee on Student 
Conduct. It is the policy of the faculty of Biology 4, that any student caught cheating in the 
course, including cheating on examinations or quizzes, and found guilty of this offense by the 
Student-Faculty Committee on Student Conduct will receive a grade of F in the course. 
Penalties implemented by the Student Faculty Committee on Student Conduct can include 
suspension or expulsion from the university. </p>

<h1>LSCF </h1>

<p>The managers of the Life Sciences Computing Facility located
in rm 2242 Noble Hall have agreed to accomodate our class for
&quot;non-reserved&quot; drop-in use during the following times:<br>
<br>
Monday 9:00am - 11:00am<br>
Tuesday 6:00pm - 8:00pm<br>
Wednesday 6:00pm - 8:00pm<br>
Friday 9:00am - 11:00am &amp; 6:00pm - 8:00pm<br>
<br>
MCDB 4a students will not receive stickers and should not be<br>
questioned by MCL monitors during the above times. LSCF usage
stickers<br>
are required for all other times. <br>
<br>
MCDB 4A students are restricted to use of the facility for web
access associated with the course and the facility is not a
general purpose computing lab (no word processing, electronic mail,
etc).<br>
<br>
We are fortunate to use this facility as it is normally reserved
for upper division courses. Please follow the above restrictions
so that our class will continue to have access to the lab.<br>

<hr>

<p>The purpose of this presentation is to help you understand the movements
of chromosomes in meiosis and how Mendelian genes segregate in
meiosis. This is the key to understanding the fundamentals of
genetic principles. </p>

<p>A series of short movies will demonstrate the segregation of
alleles during meiosis. The hypothetical organism is 2N = 4 and
thus has two pairs of homologous chromosomes - remember one chromosome
of each pair was donated by the gametes that formed this
individual. This is indicated by color - blue chromosomes are from
the paternal parent and red are from the maternal parent. </p>

<p><i>This presentation is a two dimensional artistic
representation of a process that occurs in three dimensions. For
clarity, we have arranged the chromosomes in a flat plane. </i></p>

<h2>Meiosis<b><i> </i></b></h2>

<p>Meiosis is a series of two nuclear divisions called meiosis I
and meiosis II. These two divisions are each divided into further
phases: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Prophase </li>
    <li>Metaphase </li>
    <li>Anaphase </li>
    <li>Telophase </li>
</ul>

<h3>Genes on Different Chromosomes </h3>

<p>In this initial example, we are considering two genes, <i>A/a</i>
and <i>B/b</i> that are located on different chromosomes. The <i>A/a</i>
gene is located at the tip of one arm of a large metacentric
chromosome and the <i>B/b</i> gene is near the centromere of a
smaller chromosome. The cell (meiocyte) undergoing meiosis is
heterozygous for both genes and thus its genotype is<i> AaBb</i>.
Note that one of the gametes that formed this organism must have
had the genotype <i>AB</i> (blue parent) and the other gamete
must have been <i>ab</i> (red parent). The arrangement of the genes
on the chromosomes prior to meiosis is diagrammed below: </p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/meio1.gif" width="380"
height="382"></p>

<p>Prior to the beginning of meiosis, all the DNA replicates
during the premeiotic S-phase to form identical pairs of sister
chromatids for each chromosome. </p>

<h4>Prophase I </h4>

<p>The first stage of meiosis I is prophase I, characterized by
the condensation of the chromosomes, the pairing of the
homologous chromosomes, and exchange of genetic material that
results in the crossovers or chiasmata that will become visible
in late prophase<b><i>. Click on the cell below to see an
animation of these events</i></b> </p>

<h3 align="center"><img src="images/prophase.gif" width="250"
height="250"> <br>
<a href="prophase.mov">Movie of meiocyte undergoing prophase </a></h3>

<h4>Metaphase I, Anaphase I, Telophase I and Meiosis II </h4>

<p>After prophase I, the next stage is metaphase I. The
homologous pairs align on the equatorial plate of the cell, and
how one pair of homologous chromosomes lines up has no effect on
how any other pair lines up. The specific arrangement of the
homologous pairs during metaphase determines which allele for
each gene will be in the same haploid product of meiosis. In the
first example, the blue homolog of the large chromosome pairs
(carrying the <i>A</i> allele) has aligned on the same side of
the equatorial plate as the red homolog of the small chromosome
pair (carrying the <i>b</i> allele). During anaphase I, the these
two will move to the same pole of the cell and will eventually
end up in the same haploid product, which will have the genotype <i>Ab</i>.
Similarly, the other chromosomes moving to the opposite pole will
result in haploid products of genotype <i>aB</i>. Click on the
image below to see how this happens. </p>

<h3 align="center"><img src="images/meio1a.gif" width="303"
height="292"> <br>
<a href="meio1.mov">Movie of segregation pattern that gives Ab
and aB combinations</a> </h3>

<p>Since how homologous chromosomes line up at metaphase is independent
of how any other pair lines up, about 50% of the time the
alternative arrangement occurs - the <i>A</i> allele aligns with
the <i>B</i> allele and the <i>a </i>with the<i> b</i>. This
arrangement leads to products of meiosis that have genotypes of <i>AB</i>
and <i>ab</i>. Click below to see this alternative segregation
pattern. </p>

<h3 align="center"><img src="images/meio2.gif" width="289"
height="295"> <br>
<a href="meio2.mov">Movie of segregation that gives AB and ab combinations</a> </h3>

<p>The alternative arrangements in metaphase are the reason that
genes on different chromosomes obey Mendel's Law of Independent Assortment.
The results of this process are that for every meiosis that leads
to<i> AB</i> and <i>ab</i> haploid cells an equal number of
meioses lead to <i>Ab </i>and <i>aB</i> cells. Thus, all four
combinations appear in equal proportions or 25%. This is the
basic premise that leads the 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratios observed
in Mendel's F2 generation. (see page 214 in Purves, Orians, and
Heller, 3rd edition) </p>

<h3>Genes on the Same Chromosome</h3>

<p>In this example we are going to consider the segregation of
the same <i>A/a</i> gene with regard to another gene, <i>D/d</i>,
that is located on the same chromosome arm as the <i>A/a</i>
gene. This arrangement leads to the phenomenon called <b>genetic
linkage.</b> When two genes show genetic linkage, it is an
exception to Mendel's<b> Law of Independent Assortment</b>. </p>

<h4>Segregation of linked genes when no crossover occurs between the
two loci</h4>

<p>In the next movie, the cell has finished <b>prophase I</b> and
is just beginning to enter <b>metaphase I</b>. In this example a
crossover has occurred in prophase I that lies outside the
interval between the <i>A/a</i> and <i>D/d</i> genes. The
position where crossing over occurs in any one meiosis is a
random event. If two genes are close together on a chromosome
arm, a crossover will rarely occur between the two loci. Genetic
linkage is measured by determining what percentage of the time a
crossover does occur between two linked genes. The percentage of
crossovers is a measure the genetic distance between two genes on
a genetic map. When no crossover occurs between the A/a and D/d
gene the only products of meiosis produced will be <i>AD</i> and <i>ad. </i>This
is the same as the parental gametes that produced this individual.
So we call these <b>parental gamete combinations.</b><b><i> </i></b></p>

src="images/meio3.gif" align="center" width="309" height="306"></a> <br>
<a href="meio3.mov">Movie of segregation with no crossover
between A and D</a></h3>

<h4>Segregation of linked genes when crossover occurs between the two
loci</h4>

<p>In the final movie, a crossover has occurred in prophase I
between the A/a and D/d gene loci. This results in<b>
recombination</b> for the A/a and D/d loci and products of
meiosis that are<b> recombinant gamete combinations</b>, <i>Ad</i>
and <i>aD. </i></p>

<h3 align="center"><a href="meio4.mov"><img
src="images/meio4.gif" width="307" height="304"></a> <br>
<a href="meio4.mov">Movie of segregation with crossover between A
and D</a></h3>

<h4>Genes Far Apart on the Same Chromosome</h4>

<p>When genes are very far apart on the same chromosome, the
number of crossover events equals the number of noncrossover
events. Thus the gametes produced end up having all combinations
in equal proportions. This is exactly what <b>Mendel's Law of
Independent Assortment</b> would predict. Thus most of the time,
any two genes will obey Mendel's Law of Independent Assortment.
It is only when they are close to each other on the same
chromosome that they display the nonMendelian behavior of <b>genetic
linkage</b>.</p>

<H3>Answers to Midterm Fall 1994 </H3>

<OL>
<LI>A
<LI>A
<LI>E
<LI>C
<LI>B
<LI>D
<LI>D - A linkage group represents collection of linked gene loci
that make up the genetic map of a single chromosome.
<LI>D 
<LI>E
<LI>C
<LI>D - In this case the only thing to consider is the segregation
of the<I> Aa x aa</I> genes. Thus 50% of the progeny will be <I>aa--</I>
and thus albino. The rest will be some color.
<LI>C - Among the 50% that are <I>A-</I>, there will be either
<I>B-</I> (agouti) or <I>bb</I> (black) genotypes in a ratio of
3 agouti: 1 black so to calculate the overall agouti progeny we
multiply &#190; X &#189; = 3/8 or 37.5%
<LI>B - To determine the black progeny you multiply &#188; x &#189;
= 1/8 or 12.5%
<LI>E - The only explanation for a 1:2:1 ratio in the F2 generation
is incomplete dominance. If two different genes are segregating
the F2 should be some variation of 9:3:3:1 in the phenotypic classes.

</OL>

<H3>Answers Final Exam Fall 1994 </H3>

<OL>
<LI>B - If Charlie's genotype is BbEe then when you interbreed
dogs of similar genotype, you would expect 3/16 <I>B-ee</I> and
1/16 <I>bbee </I>so altogether we would expect 4/16 golden or
yellow in the offspring.
<LI>C - 3/16<I> bbE-</I> that would be brown progeny.
<LI>D 
<LI>C 
<LI>A - the cross is X<I><SUP>L</SUP></I>X<I><SUP>l</SUP></I>
x X<I><SUP>L</SUP></I>Y so have the sons would get the lethal<I>
l</I> allele and never be born. We would thus expect a ratio of
2 female:1 male in the progeny.
<LI>D - 
<LI>C - X<I><SUP>C</SUP></I>X<I><SUP>c</SUP></I> x X<I><SUP>C</SUP></I>Y
= 50% of sons with X<I><SUP>c</SUP></I>Y
<LI>A - The females will be either homozygous dominant or heterozygous
so none will show the trait.
<LI>E 
<LI>D - Her mother is a carrier and has a &#189; chance of giving
her the X-linked allele. If she is a carrier she has a &#189;
probability of passing it on to her sons. So the overall probability
is &#189; x &#189; or &#188; that her 1<SUP>st</SUP> son will
be colorblind. Thus the probability that her son will not be colorblind
is 1 - &#188; or &#190;.
<LI>C - This is obviously an autosomal recessive disorder. Thus
Joe's genotype must be Aa because her has an affected father.
Beth's genotype is a little harder to figure out, she is either
AA or Aa. You only care about the chance of her being heterozygous
so you know both her parents are heterozygous because she has
an affected sibling. Thus the chance she is heterozygous is 2/3
(think hard about this point). If both Beth and Joe are heterozygous
then we would expect &#188; of their children to be affected so
the overall probability is 2/3 x &#188; or 1/6.
<LI>E 
<LI>D- you can exclude X-linked recessive because of the affected
female has an unaffected father.
<LI>E - 2/3 for II-2 to be heterozygous, 2/3 x 1/2 for III-2 and
thus 2/3 x &#189; x &#189; for IV-1. IV-2 must be heterozygous
and thus to calculate the overall probability that they will have
an affected child we would mulitiply 2/3 x &#189; x &#189; x &#188;
or 1/24.
<LI>B
<LI>D
<LI>C - The recombinant phenotypes should be present about 20%
of the progeny or 1000 x .2 = 200
<LI>B
<LI>A -  (B was mistakenly indicated as the right answer earlier)
<LI>D - Their is a typographical error in the numbers which should
add up to 1000 progeny. Thus to calculate the map distance = (90
+ 110) /1000 x 100% or 20 centimorgans apart.
<LI>B - this syndrome is called Klinefelter's which have XXY.
<LI>A

<p align="left">The piebald trait is controlled by the <em>S</em><sup><em>P</em></sup><em> </em>allele
in dogs and can be expressed at different levels of intensity
(expressivity) depending on the presence or absence of other
genes.</p>
<p align="left">The piebald trait is also observed in mice and
humans. It appears to be due to a failure of melanocytes to
properly migrate during early development so that parts of the
skin are unable to make pigment. The gene involve is a
protooncogene called c-kit.</p>
