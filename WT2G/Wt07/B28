<BR><B>THE CITY OF PASADENA ADOPTED A PLAN TO CREATE A BIOTECH/BIOMED RESEARCH PARK</B>
<BR>by<I> Ahmed A. Enany</I>
<P>
============<BR>
<P>
In an attempt to bolster its technology-based economy, the City of Pasadena recently adopted a public/private initiative named ìTechnoplexî seeking, among other things, to create a biotech/biomed research park to be located between the Harbor Freeway and Huntington Memorial Hospital.  The park, named the South Fair Oaks Biotech Corridor,  is designed to attract and retain spin-offs from nearby biomedical and biotechnology research institutions. According to Yvonne Walkup, Business Development Manager for the City of Pasadena, the corridor ìis just one step in the direction of making Pasadena  biotech/biomed-friendly .î 
<P> 
City officials realize the importance of linking up with local research institutions such as Caltech, Huntington Memorial Hospital and Huntington Medical Research Institute to encourage the growth of biomedical businesses in Pasadena. These institutions generate commercializeable  technologies that can support new firm formation. But one of the biggest frustrations of newly founded biomed/biotech firms in the area is the paucity of affordable real estate that is suitable for R&D and manufacturing activities. The Caltech spin-off, Clinical Micro Sensors (see page 9),  is one of these firms. According to its President, Faiz Kayyem, ìthe City of Pasadena can encourage the proliferation and retention of university spin-offs by creating a research park environment comparable to that in La Jolla or Palo Alto. The payoff of such an effort is tremendous. Biomedical and biotechnology firms can generate many high-paying technology jobs.î 
<P> 
William Opel of Huntington Medical Research Institute was one of the early proponents of creating such a research park 
environment. His proposal was taken seriously by Pasadena officials who commissioned a feasibility study that recommended the creation of a biomedical corridor in the South Fair Oaks Redevelopment Area. On October 16, 1995, the City allocated $90,000 to conduct the environmental impact analysis needed for the proposed corridor and prepare the specific plans for its development.  
<P> 
Pasadena officials hope that the Park would also attract spin-offs from a proposed research foundation to be established by the AIDS researcher, Robert Gallo, in the city. The foundation will be the west coast satellite of Galloís Washington, D.C.- based AIDS research institute.

<BR><B>REPORT SAYS BIOMEDICAL TECHNOLOGY IS THE THIRD LARGEST INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA</B>
<BR>by<I> Ahmed A. Enany</I>
<P>
============<BR>
<P>
While many California industries have laid off thousands of workers in the wake of defense cutbacks during the last 5 years, biomedical technology has added jobs and became one of the stateís significant engines of growth. This is the conclusion of a new report released by the California Health Care Institute (CHI), a public policy research and advocacy organization based in La Jolla. The report shows that the state is now home to a dynamic industry ó the third largest in the state as shown in the graph below ó that employs about 152,000 people.  
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="http://www.socalbio.org/graph/empca.gif"></CENTER>
<P>
The report, entitled ìCaliforniaís Health Care Technology Economy,î is based on a survey of biomedical firms and research organizations in the state conducted for CHI by the Bay Area Bioscience Center between June and September of 1994. Here are some of its interesting conclusions: 
 <P>
<BR>è By contrast to Californiaís general lackluster economic performance, the stateís biomedical firms increased their revenues by about 20.3% to $13.6 billion in 1993 from $10.85 billion in 1991. 
<P>
<BR>è These revenues are generated by firms that tend to be young and small. Most of the stateís biomedical firms emerged during the last 15 years, and 64% employ less than 50 people. 
<P>
<BR>è Manufacturers of drugs, medical devices and lab supplies account for 37%, 36% and 22% of the stateís biomedical jobs respectively.  
<P>
<BR>è The average yearly biomedical salary is about $40,000. 
<P>
<BR>è A significant portion of the stateís biomedical revenues is generated from exports, and 2 of every 5 medical devices exported by the US are made in California. 
<P>
<BR>è California leads the country in investment in biomedical research. In 1993, biomedical organizations, including universities, spent $3.98 billion ó 33% up from 1991 ó on research and development (R&D).  
<P>
<BR>è The report estimates that 582 new drugs and medical devices ó many of which are premised on breakthrough innovations are now under different stages of development. If approved, these products can generate thousands of additional high-paying jobs, and secure Californiaís leadership in biomedical manufacturing. 
<P> 
In a press release issued on May 2nd, 1995, CHI president David Gollaher, Ph.D., warned that Californians should not take these positive developments for granted. ìNo other state approaches California in scale of academic and commercial medical technology; but our leadership is hardly secure. The next year or two will be critical. FDA review is unduly lengthy, bureaucratic, and expensive. NIH funding is under fire. Medicare and Medicaid are targeted for cuts. Federal and state lawmakers must find creative ways to balance budgets and make government more efficient without, in the process, harming Americaís most innovative industry,î he said. 
<P> 
Molly Ingraham, CHIís Director of Corporate Communications, informed SYNERGIES that the reportís estimates of biomedical jobs and revenues tend to be conservative ìbecause the survey did not adequately capture certain segments of the stateís biomedical industry. In addition, certain regions, such as LA County, were under-represented because of a relatively low rate of firm response.î 
<P> 
Unfortunately, CHIís report does not provide a comprehensive count of biomedical firms in the state. Only 800 firms were described as ìactively engaged in healthcare technology (p.5).î This is a small fraction of Californiaís biomedical firms. David Anast, the Newport Beach-based publisher of the Biomedical Market Newsletter, found 2300 firms just in Southern Californiaís seven counties. 
<P> 
Also, the report does not show the regional breakdown of biomedical firms, employment and revenues throughout the state. It only mentions that: ìOf Californiaís largest health care technologies companies, approximately half are clustered in Northern California, primarily in the Bay Area, and half are located in Southern California (p.6).î Despite these shortcomings CHIís report provides the only up-to-date overview of the stateís biomedical industry.  
<P> 
SCBC and CHI will collaborate in producing next yearís biomedical industry report.

<BR><B>WHERE IS THE BIOPHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY GOING?</B>
<BR>by<I> W. Courtney McGregor, Ph.D.</I>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="http://www.socalbio.org/graph/mac.jpg"></CENTER>
<P>
============<BR>
<P>
Some idea of where the biopharmaceutical industry is going comes from a glance at what kinds of products are in 
development. Figure 1 shows the distribution of the 234 mostly protein biotechnology drugs in clinical tests.(1) If we 
accept that it takes an average of 12 years to get from basic research through final review for approval of a new 
medicine, some percentage of these drugs will make it to the local pharmacy in the next 8-9 years.(2) 
Unfortunately, many of the companies developing these drugs do not have enough cash to carry them until products 
are approved. Some projections from a year ago suggested that 58% of the nearly 1300 biotech companies had less 
than 2 years of cash left.(3) 
<P> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="http://www.socalbio.org/graph/biodrug.gif"></CENTER>
<P>
These companies do not have many options. If there is true FDA reform and soon, that may help some companies. 
Most of the biotechnology industry continues to think that the FDA is an impediment to their success.(4) But the trend 
is toward consolidation of companies as has been predicted for years. Table 1 shows the profile of consolidation 
from May 1994 through May 1995.(5) Many of the consolidations have been mergers of small companies, but the 
major acquisitions by big pharmaceutical companies usually get the most media attention.

<P> 
One of the negative consequences of consolidation is staff reduction, but job security isnít what it used to be anyway 
as evidenced by big pharmaceutical job cuts in recent years. From 1989 to 1995, pharmaceutical firms nationwide 
laid off about 51,480 employees. About 50% of these job cuts took place in 1993.(6)   
<P> 
The alliances that develop in the future will be shaped by a variety of creative financing strategies but the trend will 
continue. Analysis of recent consolidations strongly suggests that they have evolved from already established 
working relationships. Personal contacts and the development of relationships at one or more levels appears to be 
very important. Given the 800 plus biomedical firms in Los Angeles County alone,(7) there are likely some local 
opportunities for alliances to be explored. This, of course, does not preclude the proliferation of new biotechnology 
companies in the region.

<FONT SIZE=5 FACE="SCRIPT"><B>D</B></FONT><FONT FACE="ARIAL">uring the last two decades Southern California, due to the abundance of ideas, labor, capital and networking opportunities, has been the world center of intraocular lens (IOL) design and manufacturing. The innovations of local firms contributed, not only to biomedical job growth, but also to improving the life style of people afflicted with cataracts. After experiencing dramatic growth, the IOL industry went through a period of restructuring and shrinkage after 1985. In addition to market saturation, manufacturers attribute this turn of fortunes to government regulations that, although well-intentioned, cut the profit margins of the industry significantly. The following is a brief analysis of the achievements and tribulations of IOL manufacturing in the US and Southern California.  
<P> 
<B>Cataracts and IOL Implantation: </B><BR>
<a href="A http://www.web-xpress.com/vhsc/cataract.html">cataract</a> is the opacification or cloudiness of the eye lens associated with aging, corticosteroid intake, diabetes, or traumas, such as blunt injuries to the eye and electrical shocks. When cataracts accumulate to the point of occluding both eyes, a surgical procedure to extract them is required to restore visual acuity. This procedure -- which now takes less than 30 minutes to perform -- involves removing the cataract-ridden natural eye lens and replacing it with a tiny IOL made of biocompatible material, such as polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) or silicone. More than 1.5 million cataract procedures are performed each year in the US and almost all involve the implantation of IOLs (see table 1).

<P> 
Although all early IOL innovations following World War II were of European origin, the US came to dominate the manufacturing of these tiny lenses during the last two decades. It is estimated that about two-thirds of all IOLs manufactured in the world are made in the US, and most of these are designed and produced by firms located in Southern California, such as <a href="http://www.researchmag.com/company/profile/cpagn.htm">Allergan</a> (Irvine), Chiron Vision (Irvine), Iolab (Claremont), Ioptex (Irwindale), Pharmacia Iovision (Irvine), Ocularvision (Goleta), Ophthalmic Innovations International (Claremont), <a href="http://www.staar.com/">Staar Surgical</a> (Monrovia), Mentor/ORC (Azusa), and <a href="http://www.surgidev.com/">Surgidev</a> (Goleta). 
<P> 
<B>The European Phase: </B><BR>
Cataract removal was practiced routinely since recorded times. For example, Ancient Egyptian healers removed cataracts by striking the eye causing the lens to dislocate in the vitreous cavity. But the implantation of IOLs to replace the cataract-ridden natural eye lens was a post-World War II innovation pioneered by such renowned European ophthalmologists as Harold Ridley, Binkhorst, Worst, Choyce, Baron, Strampelli and Federov. It was Ridley who first designed and implanted an IOL -- manufactured with the help of Rayners of London -- in 1949 at St. Thomas (London). From 1950 to 1959, he performed 1000 implantations before giving up the idea because of myriads of  post-operative complications. Ridleyís lens -- known as the posterior-chamber IOL because it was implanted in the posterior capsule housing the natural eye lens -- was prone to dislocation because of its heavy weight. Also, post-operative complications resulted from inadequate sterilization, the development of glaucoma, and the chemically-active material in the lens.  
<P> 
These problems did not discourage other ophthalmologists who, during the 1950s and 1960s, developed new designs. These 
included the anterior-chamber lens, first implanted by Strampelli of Italy and Baron of France in the eyeís anterior chamber, the 
iris-support lens pioneered by Epstein and Binkhorst and Federov, and the iridocapsular lens developed by Binkhorst. These new 
designs overcame some of the complications associated with Ridley posterior-chamber lens, which was gradually abandoned by 
surgeons. But these new designs had their own complications, such as corneal decomposition caused by anterior-chamber IOLs or macular edema resulting from the use of the iris-support lens. 
<P> 
<B>The American Phase:</B> <BR>
While European ophthalmologists continued to experiment with design modifications to improve the safety of IOLs, their American 
counterparts refrained from using them, preferring the traditional alternative of fitting aphakic patients with bottle-bottom 
eyeglasses or contact lenses to improve vision. IOL implantation was only practiced by an elite group of European-trained surgeons, such as Warren Rees who implanted the first IOL in the US in 1952.  
<P> 
Although these surgeons, many of whom resided in Southern California, relied heavily on the cataract surgery and IOL innovations 
pioneered in Europe, they eventually made significant contributions resulting in (a) shifting the locus of IOL innovations during the 
last two decades from Europe to the US; (b) making cataract removal and IOL implantation the safest and most frequently performed surgical procedure in the US; and (c) the rise of a specialized segment of the medical device industry dedicated to the design and manufacturing of IOLs headquartered in Southern California. Among these surgeonsí contributions were (a) spreading IOL implantation skills among cataract surgeons by sponsoring implantation seminars ( such as Hirschmanís which was offered in Long Beach in 1974); (b) convincing third-party payers to reimburse IOL implantation, and educating regulators about the life-enhancing value of the procedure; and (c) making important innovations in microsurgery. These included the use of the operating microscope, sterilization (particularly the use  of viscoelastic in surgery), and cataract removal and IOL implantation instruments (such as <a href="http://mystic.biomed.mcgill.ca/MedinfHome/ZSPROJECTS/Ophthalmology/OphthHypertext/history.html">Kelmanís phacoemulsification</a> machine which reduced the time and invasiveness of the procedure, and increased its safety significantly). But the most dramatic contribution of surgeons, such as Sinskey, Shearing, Simcoe, Pearce, Harris, and Aziz Anis, was reviving Ridleyís posterior-chamber IOL and redesigning it to insure the ease and safety of its insertion through a small incision. These pioneers made Ridleyís original idea the industry standard. In 1977-78, posterior-chamber IOLs were used in only 3.7% of all implantation procedures in the US. Six years later, its share rose to 83%. 
<P> 
<B>The Growth Years (1975-1985):</B> <BR>
From the economic stand-point, the above factors increased the popularity of IOL implantation which, in turn, led to the rise of an 
industry dedicated to IOL manufacturing. Of the 40,000 people in the US who underwent cataract surgery in 1975, only 10% were 
fitted with IOLs (FDA Consumer, Feb., 78). By 1980, 500,000 persons had their cataracts removed surgically, and 45% received 
IOLs (see Table 1). Initially, big firms ignored this market segment because of its small size. As a result, the playing field became 
dominated by smaller and faster entrepreneurial firms, particularly in Southern California, such as California Intraocular Lens Corp. 
(Baldwin Park), American Medical Optics (Santa Ana), Intermedics (Pasadena), Iolab (Pasadena), Heyer Schulte (Goleta), McGhan 
(Santa Barbara), Surgidev (Goleta) and Optical Radiation Corp. (Azusa). Outside California, Cilco (Huntington, WV), Coburn 
(Clearwater, FL), Lynell Medical (NY, NY), and Precision-Cosmet (Minnetonka, MN) also vied for market shares. By 1984, these 
firms dominated the IOL market which reached $240 million in size, up 300% from 1980 (Barronís, Oct. 1, 84). Iolab led the pack, 
with 25% of the market, followed by Cilco (17%), Intermedics (12%), American Medical optics (9.5%), Precision-Cosmet (8.7%) and 
Optical Radiation Corp. (ORC) (2.9%). By the mid 1980s, Southern Californiaís share was well over 50% of the IOL market. 
<P> 
In many respects the regime of IOL manufacturing in the US during most of the 70s and 80s resembled that of its European 
counterpart. US cataract surgeons were the critical players in the IOL industry. They made numerous IOL innovations around which 
new firm formation occurred. These surgeons also cultivated learning networks for the exchange of clinical and technical 
information. These networks were critical in furthering innovations in cataract surgery and IOL design, particularly given the 
absence of input from American academia. Academic institutions in the US maintained an armís length relationship with the 
industry. The trial and error approach to IOL innovation was an anathema to many scientists who often complained about the 
natural tendency of the practicing surgeon to separate surgery from science. 
<P> 
Richard Aguilera, co-founder of the Claremont-based Ophthalmic Innovations, and Patrick Dundas, former employee of American 
Optical Corp., Storz and ORC, contend that, unlike any other region in the US, Southern California was home to many innovative 
cataract surgeons who were the source of its dynamism in IOL design and manufacturing. In Dundasí words: ìBecause of the 
climate and existence of a relatively large population of elderly people, Southern California has been a magnet attracting innovative 
cataract surgeons, such as Thomas Mazzaco of Van Nuys and Robert Sinskey of Santa Monica, who believed in the value of IOLs, 
had a large market here, and were a force behind IOL firm advances in the region.î 
<P> 
Unlike their European counterparts that remained as isolated workshops, Southern Californiaís IOL manufacturers thrived on 
networking and informational exchange facilitated by their geographical agglomeration. As Aguilera states: ìIOLs, these tiny pieces 
of plastic, created a ëmini Silicon Valleyí in Southern California that generated cutting-edge innovations.î 
<P> 
According to Barronís (Oct. 1, 84), IOLs costing between $40 to $60 to produce in 1984 had market price tags between $200 and 
$400. These large profit margins lured many venture capitalists and fueled an IOL speculative fever on Wall Street. Also, the growth 
prospects of the industry attracted many established firms that entered the market during the early 1980s by acquiring promising 
firms. In Southern California, Iolab was acquired by Johnson & Johnson, McGhan was sold to 3M, and American Medical Optics 
was purchased by American Hospital Supply. Outside Southern California, Cilco, Precision-Cosmet, and Coburn were acquired by 
Rorer, Fregitronics and Revlon respectively. The availability of venture capital and the interest of established firms in the IOL market 
encouraged firm formation particularly in the Southern California, including American IOL (Huntington Beach), Chiron 
Ophthalmic (which became Chiron Vision) (Irvine), Ioptex (Irwindale), IoTech (San Marino), and Staar Surgical (Monrovia). 
<P> 
Finding skilled labor to support this industry in Southern California has not been a challenge, according to Aguilera and Dundas. 
IOLs have been made by one of four methods: injection molding, lathe-cutting, cast molding, and compression & lathe-cutting. 
Manufacturers drew workers from the regionís sizeable plastics and optics industries where the basic skills required by these 
methods were widely diffused. In short, the abundance of ideas, capital, labor and networking opportunities was what made Southern California an ideal IOL innovation and manufacturing region. Not only did local firms provide most of the US output of IOLs, they also pioneered many innovations: anti-UV radiation IOLs, foldable lenses, Silicone IOLs, expandable lenses, ultra-smooth IOLs, one-piece IOLs, multi-focal IOLs, and injectable IOLs. The forecast in the mid-1980s was that these innovations would triple the size of the market from $240 million in 1984 to $700 million in1990 (Barronís, Oct. 1, 84). 
<P> 
<B>The Dry Years (1985-1995): </B><BR>
This prediction, however, never materialized. Expectations of market saturation intensified competition and triggered price warfare 
which was accompanied by questionable sales tactics. Barronís (July 22, 85) reported that some IOL manufacturers induced doctors 
to buy their lenses by offering perks including outright cash payments. This triggered a wide-scale governmental investigation of the 
industry in the mid-1980s. Government probing of the industry was also spurred by the growing concerns about the escalating cost 
of Medicare payment for cataract removal and IOL implantation, which increased 10-fold during the 1980s (LA times, June 7, 93). 
<P> 
The outcome of this investigation was favorable neither to IOL makers nor to their backers among cataract surgeons. In addition to 
cracking down on manufacturers employing questionable sales tactics, government proposed a cap of $200 on reimbursement for 
all IOLs to be enforced in 1990 (LA Times, Oct. 24, 88). This cap was lowered in 1993 to $150. Also, Medicare reimbursement per 
cataract removal and IOL implantation procedure was cut significantly from $1850 in 1986 to $1150 in 1993 (LA Times, June 7, 
93). 
<P> 
These changes, combined with the 100% conversion of aphakic patients to IOLs, spelled trouble for IOL manufacturers, particularly 
in Southern California (LA Times, June 9, 90). They dampened growth expectations and cut the profit margins of IOL 
manufacturers. This brought new firm formation to a halt. In addition, the price warfare continued unabated which reduced the 
average price per lens from $325 in 1985 to $125 in 1995. This, in turn, reduced the industryís domestic revenues from $309 
million to $214 million despite the doubling of the its output during the same period (see table 1). Wide-scale industry restructuring 
accompanied these changes which reduced the number of firms active in the IOL market and induced vertical integration. 
<P> 
<B>Weíre no Longer in Kansas: </B><BR>
In the early 80s, over 40 firms were actively developing IOLs in the US. Less than half of these firms exist today. During the last ten 
years, plant rationalization, bankruptcy and product failures eliminated many players. For example, Cilco could no longer afford to 
maintain subsidiaries throughout the US. Thus, in the early 1990s, it closed down its operations in Bellevue (WA), Brentwood (TN) 
and Pomona (CA), and consolidated its manufacturing in Huntington (WV).  
<P> 
Escalating R&D cost and the toughening of FDA regulations at a time when revenues were declining made it difficult for small 
producers to continue as specialized IOL makers. Many independent firms therefore succumbed to acquisitions from 1986 on. 
American IOL (Huntington Beach, CA) was absorbed by Eye Technology (St. Paul, MN). Intermedics (Pasadena, CA) was purchased by Pharmacia and Moved to Monrovia, CA. The British firm Smith & Nephew acquired Ioptex of Irwindale in 1988. Intraoptics (Boca Raton, FL) was bought by Chiron Ophthalmic (Irvine, CA) in 1992. Pharmacia also acquired Iovision (formerly known as Wright Medical) (Irvine, CA) in 1995. 
<P> 
Product failures caused other firms to scale down or unravel. Surgidev laid off 150 people in Goleta following the discovery of 
problems caused by some of its IOLs in 1988. Others, such as Vision Technologies, which relocated from San Dimas (CA) to 
Colorado, went bankrupt in 1992. The Azusa-based ORC, once the darling of Wall Street, unraveled in 1994 because of product 
failures that undermined its standing on Wall Street. Its IOL business was sold to Benson Eyecare (Rye, NY) which was later acquired by Mentor (Santa Barbara, CA). ORCís eyeglass lens business was retained by Benson under the name Orcolite. 
<P> 
Also, from 1986 to 1995, the ownership of many IOL operations changed hands at a dizzying pace. Coopervision (Palo Alto, CA), 
which purchased Cilco from Rorer in 1986, was forced to sell the firm to Nestleís subsidiary Alcon (Fort Worth, TX) in 1988. The 
deal also included the acquisition of Coopervisionís surgical business in Irvine, Cooper Surgical, which made IOLs and ophthalmic 
surgery instruments. During the same year, Allergan (Irvine, CA), which was a subsidiary of Smithklein, acquired American Medical 
Optics from American Hospital Supply. In that same year, Revlon sold its Minnetonka-based Precision-Cosmet to Johnson & Johnson. The firm was latter absorbed by Johnson & Johnsonís Claremont-based Iolab. But, in 1995, Johnson & Johnson sold Iolab to Chiron Ophthalmic (Irvine, CA), a subsidiary of the biotech firm Chiron (Emeryville, CA). Revlon also sold its Florida-based IOL operation, Coburn, in 1987 to American Cyanamid. Since then, Coburn has been operated by Storz (St. Louis, MO), an ophthalmic surgery business acquired by Cyanamid a year earlier. Finally, in 1994, Smith & Nephew could not keep Ioptex which was sold at a loss to Allergan. 
<P> 
Out of this restructuring, a two-tiered IOL industry structure emerged. The first and dominant tier is composed of diversified 
ophthalmic firms, with <a href="http://www.slackinc.com/advert/alcon/alcprod2.htm">Alcon</a> at the lead (after its acquisition of Cilco), followed by Chiron vision (after its acquisition of Iolab and Intraoptics), Allergan, Storz and Pharmacia, that muscled into the IOL market through acquisitions. These firms use a strategy of competition based on cost reduction and technological innovation. Reduction of production cost has been attempted by plant rationalization, as in the case of Cilcoís consolidation of operations in West Virginia or Pharmaciaís closure of its Monrovia operation in 1995, streamlining mass production processes, and marketing IOLs as bundled products, that is, offering IOLs as part of a broad customized cataract surgery package. 
<P>
The emphasis on cost-containment in the current health care environment favors bundling which helps both buyers and sellers in 
reducing transaction costs. Bundling is also a response to shifts in cataract procedures which increasingly emphasize small incision 
and sutureless surgery. These shifts have moved profit sources to customized surgery packages including, not just IOLs, but also 
expensive phacoemulsification, vitrectomy and viscoelastic products (BBI, Nov. 1, 94). The acquisitions of smaller firms by bigger 
ophthalmic firms as described above have been in part motivated by the need to access lens technologies, foldable, ultra-smooth, 
injectable and multifocal IOLs, and to respond to demand for sutureless and small-incision surgery (BBI, Dec. 1, 94). 
<P> 
The second tier is composed of a few small firms, such as <a href="http://www.mdriol.com/index.htm">DGR</a> (St. Petersburg, FL), Eye Technology (St. Paul, MN), Ocularvision (Goleta, CA), Ophthalmic Innovations International (Claremont, CA), Suncoast IOL (Largo, FL), Surgidev (Goleta), and US IOL (Lexington, KY), that still function as specialized manufacturers of IOLs. Collectively, these firms control less than 10% of the IOL market. They are narrowly specialized and, therefore, do not have the luxury of bundling their IOLs in a cataract surgery package. Their ability to compete technologically with firms in the first tier is limited, given the escalating cost of R&D at a time when the US market is declining. Their survival therefore rests on finding growth in foreign markets or diversifying into other growth segments of the ophthalmic market.  
<P> 
Export-based growth has been the preferred strategy of most of these firms. For example, Ophthalmic Innovations -- founded in 
1988 -- is among Southern Californiaís export-dependent manufacturers. The 50-employee firm produces various models of one-
piece posterior-chamber IOLs solely for export (Interview, July 16, 95). Outside Southern California, Suncoast IOL --  founded in 
1988 -- adopts a similar strategy. The 20-employee firm generates almost all of its revenues ($1.06 million in 1992) from foreign 
markets (Tampa Bay Business Journal, Jan. 7, 94). 
<P> 
<B>The Special Case of Staar Surgical:</B><BR>
The Monrovia-based Staar Surgical, founded in 1982, survived the restructuring of the IOL industry and emerged as the only fastest 
growing independent IOL manufacturer in the 1990s. The firmís share of the IOL market increased from 0.4% in 1991 to 4.4% in 
1993 (Staar Surgicalís Annual Report, 1994). Technologically, Staar has the muscles to compete effectively with the big players. Its 
dramatic growth has been the result of its technological dominance in the market for the foldable IOLs invented by its founder 
Thomas Mazzaco. Not only does Staar control about one-third of this market segment, but big players, including Alcon, Chiron, and 
Allergan, also owe their market position in the foldable IOL business to innovations licensed from Staar. Yet Staar resembles the 
second-tier firms in the sense that it is a narrowly specialized firm.<BR><BR>
<IMG SRC="IOLFOLD.GIF" width=120 height=150 align=right>
Staarís competitive strategy has therefore been mixed. On the one hand, it has been strengthening its technological competitiveness in the market for small-incision IOL and, at the same time,  increasing its sales in foreign markets. But limits on the future growth and the crowding of the foldable IOL market have prompted the firm to explore diversification into related markets. Lucrative opportunities in the areas of glaucoma therapy and implantable contact lenses are being explored by the firm (The Wall Street Transcript, Feb. 27, 95).  <BR><BR>

<B>At the Moment: </B><BR>
Despite the changes described above, Southern California is still the leading region in IOL manufacturing (see Table 2). Also, Local surgeons are still providing new designs of IOLs mimicking the attributes of the natural eye lens. The latest innovative trend is the multi-focal IOL, a version of which is designed by the San Diego eye surgeon, Lee Nordan. This lens is being developed and 
manufactured by Wright Medical, a firm founded by the ex-Allergan employees, George Wright and Gene Currie, in San Clemente 
in 1988. It is sold primarily in European markets under the name Nordan VariFocal. According to company officials, the Nordan 
VariFocal is made of soft silicon that can be folded into a very small incision. But unlike other IOLs, it enables patients to see clearly both at a distance and close up (LA Times, April 6, 90). Wright Medical relocated to Irvine and changed its name to Iovision. The company was acquired in 1995 by Pharmacia which hopes to establish a leading position in this new, but uncertain, segment of the IOL market.

<P>
<B>The Future:</B> <BR>
The signs are mixed about the future of the IOL industry. A report released by Frost & Sullivan (Business Wire, May 1, 95) forecasts 
a shrinkage in the surgical ophthalmic device market from $631 million in 1993 to $542 million in the year 2000 (see Figure 1). 
This decline is in large part due to the negative growth of the IOL market. There are also concerns that IOLs may be rendered 
obsolete by biotech compounds preventing cataract formation. Houston Biotechnology (Woodlands, TX) is developing the 4197X-
RA Immunotoxin to prevent the formation of cataracts. Also, Oculon (Cambridge, MA) is developing Pantethine for blocking the 
buildup of proteins that are precursors to cataracts. Although these drugs target post-vitrectomy surgical cataracts and, accordingly, work with, rather than replace IOLs, they may eventually prove useful in preventing the formation of all types of cataracts. But these new technologies are still at an early stage of development.

It is possible that technological innovations, such as the multifocal lens, may play a role in reviving the IOL market. The aging of the ìbaby boomersî by the turn of the century may also contribute to the industryís growth. Exports can be an additional source of 
revenue growth for big and small firms alike. The Third World, where cataracts often go untreated, provides a big market. 
Opportunities also abound in Japan and Western Europe where the 65 and older group is growing faster compared to the US, 1.5% and 1% respectively (BBI, March 1, 94).

<BR><B>THE DEATH OF COMMON SENSE</B>
<BR>by<I>Thomas Asher, Ph.D.</I>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="http://www.socalbio.org/graph/asher.gif"></CENTER>
<P>
============<BR>
<P>
Those of us in the biomedical industry saw ìitî coming, that is, the loss of wisdom and judgment in our 
society. In short, the loonies are taking over the asylum. Inflexible reimbursement (or rather non-
reimbursement by third payors), overkill quality assurance demands, OSHA insanity, FDA obstruction, 
irrational employment and discharge restrictions, etc., etc., etc.  
<P> 
Now, author, attorney and optimist, Phillip Howard, has traced the evolution of this morbid event by 
using a multitude of horror stories as illustrations and, surprisingly suggesting an attractive solution 
in his best seller,<B> The Death of Common Sense: How Law is Suffocating America</B> (Random House, 
New York, 1994). 
<P>  
His thesis, simply put, has been that our society has lost sight of ìpurpose,î and has made ìprocessî an 
end in itself. He refers to the triumph of ìrationalismî as demonstrated by our legislators who design 
laws that are calculated to take into account every potential eventuality thus leaving no room for 
flexibility or adjustment for changes in circumstances. The product of applying this form of rationalism 
is ìrules,î and as he points out, rules reject initiative and inhibit interpretation. Howard, through 
numerous, outrageous and current legislative examples, arrives at the highly believable observation, 
ìHow things are done has become more important than what is done.î 
<P>  
Surprisingly, he doesnít blame the civil service system rather the society (i.e., us) and our obsession for 
ìfairnessî (i.e., a level playing field). In making laws, we seem to insist that ìeveryone must be heard,î 
rather than, ìall that is necessary to be said, should be said.î  
<P>  
Howardís research into the Civil Service Act of 1883 is illuminating. Woodrow Wilson, a noted 
economist prior to his presidency said, ìThe need to invest public servants with large powers and 
discretion is the indispensable condition of responsibility. Otherwise, nothing will get done. The less 
his power (i.e., the civil servantís), the more safely obscure and unnoticed does he feel his position to 
be and the more readily does he lapse into remisiveness.î 
<P>  
Blame for the change in this philosophy has been wrongly placed on big government and, particularly, 
the 1930ís New Deal. Roosevelt emphasized decision making instead of hesitation and fear of 
responsibility when in 1937 he stated, ìPurpose must be the central driving force of democracy.î The 
results, including the WPA, a multitude of municipal sewage plants, national reforestation, the 
Tennessee Valley Authority and successful rat eradication programs were the result of the civil service 
focusing on ìpurposeî or ìresultsî rather than ìprocessî or ìform.î 
<P>  
Among Howardís extensive collection of examples of life on the funny farm is the New York Public 
School System which requires 10 separate filings and reviews taking six months in order to fix a $50 
door lock and which includes a final review by the ìSupervising Supervisor.î Our current system seems 
to be based on total distrust; hence, safeguards, reviews, public hearings, competitive bids all of which 
diffuse responsibility and insure that no one can be accountable.  
<P>  
To no oneís surprise, the administrators of our laws make no decision, bad or good. The problem is 
expected to fade away, or some other external force will come into play and solve or eliminate the 
problem. This whole sad situation becomes more painful when one realizes that this is the result of the 
best of intentions. Voters want government to be fair (e.g., all citizens to be treated alike, no favors, no 
gifts, etc.) and the whole world to be perfect (e.g., everyone should have health, wealth and happiness). 
<P>  
The rationale seems to be that middle-class standards are demanded for all, even if unrealistic. If 
middle-class housing is beyond the financial capability of a local government, then no housing is better 
than ìsub-standard,î but affordable, shelter. The fear of being percieved as treating the homeless as  
second class citizens (e.g., by denying them certain ìmiddle-class nicetiesî in low-cost housing 
projects) leads government officials to deny them any housing. Thus, lawmakers see to it that 
everything is equal. Since they are our elected representatives, I guess it means we subscribe to this 
inhumane lunacy, doesnít it? 
<P>  
The Solution ó make laws an expression of ìpurpose,î not ìmethod.î Clarify their ìintent,î and grant 
authority. Demand accountability of the administrators of the law. Accept that perfection is 
unobtainable; take a chance; make mistakes and reexamine the results of the experiment. After all, 
every piece of legislation is a new experiment. Transfer decision making ìfrom a page back to people,î 
and for Godís sake, let us try to get done what we think should be done with all deliberate speed.  
Among those things each and every citizen can do, is study the Death of Common Sense, and then get 
off our duffs.  
<P>  
America is supposed to be the ultimate example of participatory democracy. Chief Justice Earl Warren 
said it all in 1972, ìThe greatest menace to freedom is an inert people.î

<BR><B>IN THE SPOTLIGHT: PACESETTER INC.</B>
<BR>by<I> Ahmed A. Enany</I>
<P>
============<BR>
<P>
Pacesetter was founded in 1969 by Alfred Mann, a UCLA-trained physicist and aerospace entrepreneur.  Prior to starting Pacesetter, Mann owned and managed two companies, Spectrolab and Heliotek, which made power systems for space satellites during 1960s. He sold the two companies to Textron and invested in Pacesetter to develop a new pacemaker incorporating a power-generation technology pioneered by the aerospace industry. The firmís first product did not achieve commercial success when it reached the market in 1973. Pacesetter quickly recovered from this setback and , like the phoenix rising from the ashes, evolved from an unknown firm housed in a small row industrial building on San Fernando Road to what is now the biggest medical device firm in LA County, and the second biggest manufacturer of pacemakers in the world after Medtronic (Minneapolis, MN).

</table>
<P>
In a healthy person, the <a href="http://www.via.net/~cvri/nwsletma.html#heart">sinus node</a> (located atop the heartís right atrium) slows down or speeds up the heart beat to match blood flow and oxygen intake to the personís activity. When the sinus nodeís ability to pace the heart fails, death results unless <a href="http://www.via.net/~cvri/nwsletmj.html#arrhy">cardiac rhythm</a> is maintained by artificial electrostimulation. The first device used in the US to stimulate the heart electrically was developed in 1932 by <a href="http://www.bae.ncsu.edu/bae/courses/bae465/1995_projects/scho/htmls/history1.html">Dr. 
Albert Hyman</a>. It was an external pacemaker used for short durations in patients having slowed heart rate due to a shock, as in the case of hypothermia. The first fully implantable heart-pacing device in the U.S. was developed in 1958 by <a href="http://www.invent.org/book/book-text/49.html">Wilson Greatbatch</a>, William Chardack and Andrew Gage, and implanted in the first patient at Millard Fillmore Hospital (Buffalo, NY) in 1959. This invention gave rise to a new segment of the medical industry dedicated to the manufacturing of cardiac rhythm management devices.

</table>

<P>

At that time, the pacemakerís design was basic. It consisted of an assembly of a power source and transistors encased in a small container, typically made of stainless steel. The device was connected to the heart by a single-wire lead to deliver electrical pulses through an electrode at a constant rate, usually 70 pulses per minute. One of the disadvantages of early pacemakers was the short-life of their power sources. A typical pacemaker was powered by  a small mercury battery having an average life of  about 18 months. The battery had other problems, such as emitting hydrogen gas which made it impossible to hermetically seal it. Also, sodium hydroxide frequently escaped resulting in damage to the pacemakerís electronic parts. Complications resulting from these problems prompted a search for better power sources to increase the longevity and reliability of pacemakers. Pacesetter was one of the firms that explored an alternative to the mercury battery. 
<P> 
<B>The Founding Experience: </B>
<P>
Mannís entry to the medical market was purely accidental. He recalls that, in 1967, Spectrolab was the primary supplier of space power systems to the <a href="http://www.jhuapl.edu/">Applied Physics Lab (APL)</a> -- a federal research lab managed by the Johns Hopkins University -- which worked on defense and space projects for NASA and the Department of Defense. ìDuring the years of my stay at Spectrolab, we had done three dozen spacecraft for APL. Moreover, we made space-type rechargeable batteries and had advanced electronic capabilities,î he said.
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="http://www.socalbio.org/graph/mann.jpg"> </CENTER>
<CENTER><B>Al Mann: Founder of Pacesetter</B> </CENTER>
<P>  
He mentioned that APL got interested in pacemakers as a result of concerns about the complications resulting from the short life of their power sources. These concerns were expressed by cardiologists who participated in colloquia organized by APL to encourage interaction between medical professionals and engineers. Mann recalls that his friend, Robert Fischell, an engineer who headed the Power Group of the labís Space Department, suggested to APL that the life of pacemakers could be extended by making their batteries rechargeable using the same technologies employed in powering space crafts. Although the idea was appealing, APL was not positioned to develop such a device internally. Therefore, Fischell was encouraged to find an interested  private  partner. 
 <P> 
Initially, Fischell presented a proposal to <a href="http://www.medtronic.com/">Medtronic</a> (Minneapolis, MN), which controlled 80% of the market for pacemakers in the late 1960s, for jointly developing the rechargeable pacemaker. But the firm was not interested. Subsequently, Fischell offered the project to Spectrolab, but Mann also turned him down. ìOn the surface the project was appealing. I was bored with aerospace projects, and was looking for something new. I knew the technologies of power generation and electronics, and I was motivated to promote progress against heart disease because my father died of a heart attack. But I did not know anything at the time about the medical device market. Also, the project required a lot of capital, and didnít make sense for Spectrolab,î Mann said. However, after much prodding from Robert Fischell and APL officials, Mann relented and founded Pacesetter in Sylmar. Initially, Mann did not intend to move to Pacesetter. He opted to manage the new firm on part-time basis while running Spectrolab for Textron. But in 1972, he decided to dedicate all of his time to the new enterprise.  
<P>  
<B>The Rechargeable Pacemaker:</B>
<P>  
<TABLE BORDER=1 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5 WIDTH=175  Align=right>
<TD WIDTH=175>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="http://www.socalbio.org/graph/RCBD102.GIF" ALIGN=TOP> Pacesetter's Rechargeable Pacemaker BD 102</CENTER>
</table>
<P>
In February 1973, Pacesetter released its first rechargeable pacemaker which was implanted at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. As of September 1974, 800 of these devices were implanted with only one known malfunction. Analysts attributed this unusual low failure rate to the new space technology incorporated in the pacemaker. The device featured a new power source, a specially-designed space-type nickel cadmium battery which was superior to the mercury battery. This new power source was based on research funded by NASA for about 20 years to increase the reliability and longevity of earth satellitesí power systems. The battery was redesigned to fit the much smaller pacemaker. Not only did it eliminate most of the problems associated with the mercury battery, it also opened the door for further miniaturization of pacemakers. Pacesetter provided patients with external chargers to replenish the battery for an hour through the skin once a week or for four hours monthly. 
<P>  
<B>Back to the Drawing Board:</B>
<P>  
Although considered a significant innovation, Pacesetterís rechargeable pacemaker did not achieve significant commercial success. Mann attributed this to ìthe scare tactics employed by competitors.î  Also, while Pacesetter was busy working on its rechargeable pacemaker, a new battery design was made that ushered in a new era in the heart-pacing technology. In 1972, <a href="http://www.greatbatch.com/wgl.html">Wilson Greatbatch</a>, the co-inventor of the first American implantable pacemaker, adapted the <a href="http://www.greatbatch.com/medprod.html #infoli">lithium battery</a> for use in pacemakers. This battery revolutionized the industry because it proved to be completely solid-state, very reliable when used at body temperature, lasting for as long as 10 or more years, and prone to miniaturization. The Saint Paul-based newcomer, <a href="http://www.guidant.com/crm.html">Cardiac Pacemakers Inc.</a>, was the first firm to utilize the lithium battery in powering pacemakers.  The lithium battery gained wide acceptance by the late 1970s and became the power generation standard.  
 <P> 
Also, the early 1970s witnessed the use of monolithic integrated circuits in the design of the pacemakerís electronic components. This increased reliability and worked well with the lithium battery that was strong enough to power semiconductors directly. As a result, the old method required soldering the pacemakerís electronic components -- the output circuit, the timing circuit and sensing circuits -- by hand was abandoned.  
 <P> 
<B>Making a Better Mouse Trap: </B>
<P> 
Mann, who by 1972 became fully dedicated to Pacesetter, recalls that the setback of the rechargeable pacemaker made him contemplate quitting. But he decided to duke it out. ìI could not give up. Rational or not, I decided to go forward, and charted a new plan for a better pacemaker series to be designed. I talked to our people and we outlined a program to significantly advance the state-of-the-art.î  For Pacesetter, adopting the above described  innovations was necessary, but not sufficient, for building a competitive edge. To avoid being an ìalso-ran,î the firm had to make ìa major breakthrough ó something that would truly differentiate us from our competition,î Mann said.  
 <P> 
According to Jason Sholder, Pacesetterís VP for Technology, ìthe firm already had an excellent R&D team that was assembled to develop the rechargeable pacemaker. We were not short on the scientific talent. What we lacked, and this was what the setback of the rechargeable pacemaker made obvious to us, was an understanding of the market. This is the reason I was brought in because of my prior experience at GEís pacemaking operation in Milwaukee (WI).  We also discovered the importance of interaction with cardiologists and surgeons because they do the implantation, understand the needs of their patients, and recommend pacemakers to them. Learning from them, and getting their trust, are essential in having a foothold in the market. From these cardiologists we learned about the frustration of changing the parameters of the pacemaker once implanted. The market needed a device  that could be reprogrammed nonsurgically.î  
 <P> 
Programmability was not new in the design of pacemakers. In 1972, Cordis (Miami Lakes, FL) pioneered programmability to allow cardiologists to nonsurgically change some of the pacemakerís parameters, such as the number of pulses delivered to the heart per-minute. But Cardiologists still lacked any direct means to assess the functionality of pacemakers over time. This was the market niche that Pacesetter targeted, and the founderís aerospace background was helpful. The firm introduced <a href="http://www.spacelink.msfc.nasa.gov/NASA.Projects/Technology.Transfer/Space.Spinoff.Benefits/Health.and.Medicine/Medical.Implants">bi-directional telemetry</a> -- the same technology used for communication between earth stations and orbiting satellites -- which was the hallmark of its new pacemaker, <a href="http://www2.interpath.net/devcomp/guide/ps/ps526.htm">the Programalith</a>. The new device was unveiled in 1978. According to Mann, the new pacemaker ìwas smaller, yet lasted longer than other pacemakers. But most importantly, not only were multiple-functions programmable, but it also introduced bi-directional telemetry of not only programmed values, but a number of diagnostic measurements as well.î 
<P> 
<TABLE BORDER=1 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5 WIDTH=120  Align=right>
<TD WIDTH=120>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="http://www.socalbio.org/graph/PRGRMLTH.GIF" ALIGN=TOP> The Programalith</CENTER>
</table>
<P>
The Programalith was well received by cardiologists because of unique features that were absent in the programmable pacemakers of competitors, including Medtronicís Spectrax (Dow Jones, March 10, 80). As a result, the product fueled explosive growth. In 1978, Pacesetter was an obscure company generating revenues of about $4.6 million. By 1982, sales reached $60 million making Pacesetter the third largest producer of pacemakers with control of 13% of the market following Medtronic (Minneapolis, MN) and <a href="http://www.imed.com/">Intermedics</a> (Freeport, TX), which controlled 40% and 17% of the market respectively (Dow Jones, Sep. 10, 82). 
 <P> 
<B>Keeping Up With the Competition:</B>
<P>  
Until the early 1980s, almost all pacemakers paced the heart at a constant rate, usually 70 beats per minutes. This limited the activities of pacemakersí users and caused ìthe pacemaker syndrome,îincluding dizziness and fatigue, which often resulted if they engaged in activities requiring an increased or decreased heart rate. This triggered the development of the ìrate-responsiveî pacemaker. It contains sensors detecting the need for accelerated or slowed heart rate. Thus, if a person starts to run, the sensors detect the resulting changes in body movement, breathing rate or temperature, and adjust the heart rate accordingly. Medtronic was the first to bring a rate-responsive pacemaker, the Enertrax, to the market in 1981 (Dow Jones, Nov. 16, 81).  
 <P> 
Another breakthrough innovation, the ìdual-chamberî pacemaker, was made by Cordis in 1983. Dual pacing synchronizes the activities of both chambers of the heart, the atrium and the ventricle, thereby simulating the heartís natural rhythm. This resulted in more efficient blood circulation and eliminated some of the pacemaker syndrome. By contrast, conventional pacemakers which paced only the ventricle caused deficient blood circulation when the pumping activities of the atrium and the ventricle were out of synch. Cordisí Sequicor II was a dual-chamber pacemaker capable of ìsensing and stimulating cardiac activity in either or both chambers of the heart (Dow Jones, Feb. 22, 83).î Intermedicsí Cosmos, Medtronicís Symbios 7006 and Pacesetterís <a href="http://www2.interpath.net/devcomp/guide/ps/ps172.htm">AFP</a> were also among the early models of dual-chamber pacemakers introduced during 1984. 
 <P> 
Pacesetter was determined to raise capital to be able to develop more products covering all heart-pacing modalities. Therefore, the firm attempted to go public. The first attempt at an IPO was made in 1980,  but it was foiled by Pacesetterís bank -- Merrill-Lynch -- which decided it was premature. The second attempt was made in 1983, but it was again frustrated by ìa collapse of the new issue market, adverse publicity about overuse of pacemakers, about industry and Pacesetterís selling practices, and also a major product recall  by Medtronic,î Mann said.  
 <P> 
<B>Siemensí Acquisition of Pacesetter: </B>
<P> 
At the time of preparing the prospectus for the second offering, Pacesetter was approached by the German firm, Siemens, which made an offer for acquisition. When Pacesetterís second attempt at an IPO failed, Mann took Siemens' offer seriously, and an acquisition agreement was finalized in 1985.  
 <P>
<TABLE BORDER=1 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5 WIDTH=145  Align=right>
<TD WIDTH=145>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="http://www.socalbio.org/graph/SYNCH2.GIF" ALIGN=TOP> Pacesetter's Synchrony II</CENTER>
</table>
<P>  
For Siemens, Pacesetterís acquisition was important to establish a foothold in the US market for pacemakers. Siemens already owned a Swedish manufacturer of pacemakers, Siemens-Elema, which made the worldís first implantable pulse generator in 1958. But Elema lacked the technology to compete in the American market. ìWhen it (Siemens) surveyed the US market, it seemed apparent that the acquisition of Pacesetter would best serve its objectives.î For Pacesetter, whose name changed to Siemens-Pacesetter, the acquisition meant financial security. ìWith Siemens behind us, no longer would we be limited by lack of capital,î Mann, who continued to manage Pacesetter for Siemens, said. Thus, Pacesetter mounted an aggressive campaign to develop pacemakers, such as the <a href="http://www2.interpath.net/devcomp/guide/ps/ps512.htm">Phoenix</a>, <a href="http://www2.interpath.net/devcomp/guide/ps/ps957.htm">Paragon</a>, <a href="http://www2.interpath.net/devcomp/guide/ps/ps781.htm">Solus</a>, and <a href="http://www2.interpath.net/devcomp/guide/ps/ps782.htm">Synchrony</a>, covering the whole range of <a href="http://webaxis.com/heartweb/history3.htm">pacing modalities</a>: single- and dual-chamber rate-responsive, and single- and dual-chamber conventional pacemakers.  

<P>
At the center stage is the patented PDx software which provides physicians with detailed data about the patientís health and the performance of the pacemaker. The latest versions of the Paragon and Phoenix product lines, the Paragon III DDD and the Phoenix III SSI, approved by the FDA in 1994 featured a PDx-based capability called ìrate <a href="http://www.lassp.cornell.edu/sethna/hysteresis/WhatIsHysteresis.html">hysteresis</a>.î It allows the heart more time to beat on its own before the electrical pulse is delivered. Rate hysteresis saves energy and, therefore, extends the life of the pacemakerís battery (Health Industry Today, Dec. 1, 94). These <a href="http://www.webaxis.com/scripts/heartweb/pacelist.idc">products</a> enabled the company to occupy the second position, after Medtronic, with control of 25% of the market by the end of the 1980s (LA Times, Oct. 31, 89). 
 <P> 
<B>Taking Advantage of Market Turmoil:</B>
<P>  
Pacesetter also benefited from the market turmoil resulting from the fast pace of <a href="http://www2.interpath.net/devcomp/guide/bindex1.htm">cardiac pacing</a> innovations. Older actors gradually exited this market segment when they failed to keep up with the innovations of smaller firms. General Electric (GE), ARCO and American Edwards closed their pacemaker operations. Cordisí market position eroded gradually and, after product-recall problems,  it also exited this market segment by the late 1980s. Newer and faster firms used technology effectively to gnaw on the market shares of older firms. These included, in addition to Pacesetter, Intermedics which inherited ARCOís facility in Texas, <a href="http://www.tps.com/">Telectronics</a> which purchased GEís plant in Milwaukee (WI) and acquired Cordisí operations in Miami Lakes (FL), and Cardiac Pacemakers Inc. 
 <P> 
<B>Building a Learning Organization: </B>
<P> 
But reducing Pacesetterís success to technology is a mistake. Mann mentioned that: ìAlthough I come from a technical background, the experience of the rechargeable pacemaker made it clear to me that a better ëmouse trapí does not make itself, finance itself, or sell itself.î Through trial and error and by observing the market leaders, ìthe firm learned how to integrate the different disciplines, software, electronic hardware, metallurgy, biology and power generation, required for manufacturing pacemakers effectively,î said Jason Sholder.  
 <P>
The importance of building an effective  marketing capability was also a hard-learned lesson. Mann recalls that ìwhen we started, our people had all come from aerospace. No one had any experience in medical devices, let alone pacemakers.î To overcome this problem, the firm recruited top marketing personnel defecting from older pacemaker firms, such as Medtronic, Cordis or General Electric, to guide the firm through the pacemaker marketing maize.  
 <P> 
Management also fostered an open environment that, according to Mann, ìsatisfied talented, creative and committed peopleî, and where the delegation of authority, departmental interface and freedom to make decisions without fear of failure were encouraged. Because of these factors, ìour employee turnover rate for both professional and non-exempt personnel was less than one-tenth the average for Californiaís technology companies,î Mann emphasized.  
  <P>
<B><a href="http://www.sjm.com/">St. Judeís</a> Acquisition of Pacesetter: </B>
 <P>
These features, in addition to Pacesetterís market standing and technological competence, were among the factors attracting the attention of St. Jude (St. Paul, MN) which acquired the company from Siemens in 1994 for $530 million. St. Jude is a pioneer in the development of mechanical heart valves with over 590,000 implants all over the world. The acquisition of Pacesetter is part of its product diversification strategy (Star Tribune, Dec. 26, 94). This move is praised by industry observers who consider Pacesetter as an important asset in securing St. Judeís future profitability and competitiveness (The Wall Street Transcript, Feb. 27, 95 & Biomedical Materials, March 1, 95). 
 <P> 
<B>Mann Exits Pacesetter: </B>
 <P>
St. Judeís acquisition of Pacesetter provided Alfred Mann with the opportunity to exit the firm and dedicate his efforts to promote his two new firms, <a href="http://www.minimed.com">MiniMed</a>  and <a href="http://www.cochlearimplant.com/">Advanced Bionics</a>, both located in Sylmar. The first develops and markets insulin pumps for diabetics (see page 8), and the second is develops and manufactures cochlear implants for the hearing-impaired.  He also supports the Alfred Mann Foundation, a non-profit organization seeking to develop medical technologies requiring large investments and a long gestation period before reaching the market. His experience in the development of pacemakers taught him that ìcapital is king.î The foundation was built  because of his concern that capital is all too often difficult to raise in the US even for the best of opportunities due to the short-term focus of investors and the large amount of capital needed to insure success. He hopes that his foundation would make a difference by providing a source of adequate and patient capital  for developing cutting-edge medical devices. 
  <P>
<B>At the Moment: </B>
 <P>
Pacesetter is still in control of 25% of the $2 billion market of pacemakers, and is positioned to challenge Medtronicís lead. During last June, the firm obtained FDA clearance to market three new pacemakers in the US, the Trilogy DR (dual-chamber, rate-responsive), SR (single-chamber, rate-responsive) and DC (dual-chamber). The 3 devices incorporate advanced telemetry and programming features made possible by the companyís patented PDx software. Pacesetter has also two other enhanced Trilogy pulse generators, Trilogy DR+ and SR+, under clinical trials (PR Newswire, June 12, 1995).  
 <P>
 
Pacesetter is also marketing two new pacemaker leads, the Tendril and Passive Plus. The first is designed to increase safety in fixing the electrode to the heart and to minimize tissue damage during the implantation procedure. The second features an electrode tip designed to maximize the sensing of the heartís natural electrical activities and enhance the pacemakerís performance.  It also reduces the inflammatory response often associated with the implantation procedure (Health Industry Today, Dec. 1st, 94). 
 <P> 
The company has recently begun human clinical evaluation in Europe of the smallest pacemaker in the world, Microny SR+, which weighs 14 grams. The device incorporates a new technology, Auto-Capture, for minimizing the amount of energy required to stimulate the heart. Auto Capture is also employed in the firmís Regency family of Pacemakers (PR Newswire, Oct. 17, 95). In addition, Pacesetter is diversifying its product portfolio. Its patenting activities reveal that implantable defebrillators to terminate tachycardia, a condition where the heart beats fast, are currently under development. Analysts expect these devices to fuel growth in the electrophysiology market (The Wall Street Transcript, Feb. 27, 95).

<BR><B>CREATIVE FINANCING OF BIOTECHNOLOGY VENTURES</B>
<BR>by<I> Fariba Fischel-Ghodsian, Ph.D.</I>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="http://www.socalbio.org/graph/fariba.jpg"></CENTER>
<P>
============<BR>
<P>
Creativity has always been a strong asset of biotechnology companies. But a lot of capital is needed to translate this 
creativity into useful products and processes. Although the rewards to investors are immense, as in the cases of 
Genentech and Amgen, the high risks associated with biotech commercialization often drive traditional investors 
away. For this reason, biotech firms have employed various creative financing strategies to satisfy their hunger for 
cash.  
<P>  
Biotech financing strategies fall into three categories: equity offerings, corporate product licensing and debt 
financings. Sale of equity has traditionally been the largest source of capital to the biotech industry. These deals 
include (a) private equity offerings through venture capital; (b) private placement; and (c) initial and follow-on 
public offerings. 
<P>  
A "plain-vanilla" offering is the simplest and most common method of equity offering. Investors simply buy shares 
of the company based on a valuation agreed upon by both parties .  However, as the industry has evolved and 
investors have realized the inherent risks in drug development, many variations of equity financing have been used 
to satisfy the needs of both companies and investors. These modifications have varying risk/reward ratios and tax 
advantages. They  include Stock Index Reset Right (SIRR), Special Purpose Accelerated Research Corporation 
(SPARC), Private Investment in Public Companies (PIPE), Stock Warrant Off-balance sheet Research and 
Development (SWORD), and Rights Offering and Tracking Stocks. 
 <P> 
 SPARC, for example, suits investors who are willing to take risks and invest in promising early-stage R&D programs 
which are spun off from parent companies. By comparison, SIRR is designed to compensate investors for the risk 
they take by granting additional shares to them if the stock price underperforms a specific target price in the years 
following a public offering. But investors may be required to pay additional money to the company if the stock price 
stays above a specific price target. Several companies in Southern California have used variations of SIRR,  such as 
Ligand in its IPO and Advanced Tissue Sciences in its recent private placement. 
<P>  
Product licensing has been another important source of financing for biotechnology companies. I use the term 
"product licensing" broadly to include sharing of future product sales both by strategic corporate partners as well 
as investors. Traditional pharmaceutical companies, in their competitive rush to the biotech gold mine, have 
developed collaborations with biotechnology companies to provide them with much needed capital in lieu of 
sharing future product sales. These collaborations typically take advantage of the biotech companies' strong R&D 
capability and combine them with the strength of the pharmaceutical companies in manufacturing, clinical 
development, and marketing. Strategic alliances with larger pharmaceutical companies covers the whole spectrum 
from royalty-bearing product licensing agreements, in which the large company funds the entire product 
development, to manufacturing and marketing agreements, and finally to more profit-sharing co-promotion and 
co-marketing or joint venture agreements. 
 <P> 
Traditional debt financing has been the least popular method of financing for biotechnology companies. This is due 
to the high interest rate associated with risky early stage product development. However, convertible debts, which 
are a hybrid bond/stock investments and which grant investors the right to convert  debt into common stock, have 
been widely used.  
  <P> 
During the 20-year life of the biotechnology industry, equity financing has been the most important source of 
capital.  R&D Limited Partnerships were an attractive method of financing in the 1980s. However, the 1990s may 
go down as the decade of corporate partnerships and consolidation (see article on page 2). Uncertainties about the 
future of the national health care system, and competition from generic drug manufacturers are among the factors 
motivating alliances and consolidations. The 70% increase in the number of alliances forged between established 
pharmaceutical firms and biotech companies in 1994 is a reflection of this trend. These partnerships provided a 
minimum of $1.9 billion, barely lower than the $2.2 billion provided by all other sources of public and private 
financing.  
 <P>  
Although there is a clear discrepancy between how established pharmaceutical firms and Wall Street value biotech 
companies, the enthusiasm of large drug companies, a positive climate at the FDA, and favorable product approval 
news have just opened an exciting financing window for biotechnology companies. While most of the  current 
financing deals are follow-on offerings for companies with advanced clinical-stage products, these factors create a 
good climate for smaller firms to go public. I am therefore optimistic about financing opportunities for biotech 
companies in the future.

<B>Chantal Pharmaceutical</B> (West LA, LA County) -- a small publicly-traded firm (NASDAQ:CHTL) founded in 1979 by Chantal 
Burnison -- announced on June 16 and August 8 the conclusion of two private placement that netted over $11 million. Investors 
have high expectation of the marketing potential of Ethocyn, Chantalís main skin care product. The product proved in clinical trials 
its ability to optimize the skinís production of elastin fiber which minimizes wrinkles.  
<p> 
Over a year ago, Dr. Richard Strick of UCLA Medical Center told physicians at a San Francisco meeting of the American Academy of Dermatologists (LA Business Journal, Sept. 26, 94, p. 3) that Ethocyn ìis a breakthrough because it gives us a tool to deal with one of the components of the aging process, and weíve had no such tool or weapon to deal with that component -- the elasticity of aging skin -- until this time, and without the irritation of side-effects.î 
 <p>
The firm will use the proceeds to build up its manufacturing and marketing capabilities. Chantal is now looking for additional lab 
space to increase its production of Ethocyn. Also, on July 10, the firm announced a marketing agreement with the Los Angeles-based Stanson Marketing Inc. to distribute its Ethocyn-based skin care lotion in North America.  
 <p>
Chantal is also researching and developing two other compounds, Cyoctol and Metcyclor, for treating androgen mediated disorders, 
such as acne or male pattern baldness, and certain cancers. For more information, contact the company at 310-207-1950.

<A HREF="http://www.caltech.edu/~entforum/an0396.htm"><B>Clinical Micro Sensors</A></B> (CMS)  (Pasadena, LA County) was founded recently to focus on the design and manufacturing of devices for gene detection based on a novel technology developed at Caltech by Faiz Kayyem and Thomas Meade. The research conducted by Kayyem and Meade combines prior insights from biology, chemistry and physics to test how fast electrons travel in DNA strands. They reported in the February issue of Angewandte Chemie (English Edition 34(3), 1995, p. 249) that electrons travel faster in double-stranded than in single-stranded DNA molecules. The explanation has to do with the theory of the B-stack. This is a channel running at the center of the double-helix where electrons travel fast. By contrast, electrons travel slower in a single-stranded DNA because it lacks a B--stack. 
 <p>
The history of biology in the past 30 years has shown that the line between basic and applied research, science and commerce, has 
been progressively thinning. Kayyemís and Meadeís work is no exception. Their research intended to explore the physics of DNA to 
prove the existence of the  B-stack. But the discovery of differences in conductivity between single- and double-stranded DNA 
molecules lent itself immediately to commercial applications. Biological sensors can be constructed based on this discovery to detect 
viral or human DNA in biological samples.   
<p> 
ìOur strategy is to develop a novel DNA electrode so compact, sensitive and simple-to-use that no other DNA detection scheme is 
competitive. Such an electrode is possible based on differences in the electrical conductivity of single versus double stranded DNA,î said Kayyem, CMSí President. For more information, contact the firm at 818-578-0184.

<A HREF="http://www.newsfile.com/042296br.htm"><B>Cryopharm</B></A> (Pasadena, LA County)  a privately-held firm founded in 1987 and known for its work in cryopreservation of blood componentsó  announced on June 26 the signing of an exclusive licensing agreement with Competitive Technologies and the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey for patent rights to chemical compounds called coumarins. The firm will apply its halogenation technology to  transform coumarins into efficient decontaminants of blood and blood products. 
<p> 
About a month earlier, Cryopharm received a patent for a method to inactivate pathogens in blood. It involves the use of chemical 
photosensitive compounds, such as brominated psoralens,  that selectively bind to and destroy the genetic material of viruses  
(including HIV and Cytomegalovirus) upon activation with ultraviolet light without compromising the integrity of blood 
components.  
<p> 
The<B> Antiviral Agents Bulletin</B> (Sep. 1st, 1994) reported that the use of viral photoinactivation has been studied for 20 years. 
However, no commercial success has been achieved in utilizing this technique in decontaminating blood safely and efficiently.  
<p> 
Cryopharm, which employs  17 persons, is expected to change this situation. The firmís halogenated chemical compounds are 
considered an efficient alterntive to the existing methods of plasma   decontamination involving the use of heat or detergents. 
Companyís researchers  also claim that  they are promising tools for cleaning red blood cells. For more information, contact Roger 
Hackett, Ph.D., at 818-793-1040.

<B>Logan Medical Devices</B> (Glendale, LA County)  was founded as a joint venture between Pollution Research & Control Corp. (PRCC) of Glendale and Logan Research Ltd. of Britain. The new venture will manufacture a device incorporating PRCCís 
chemiluminescence technology to diagnose asthma. The device monitors the increase in the amount of nitric oxide exhaled by 
asthmatics. It is an alternative to the invasive procedure of biopsy which is frequently used to determine the degree of lung 
inflammation.  
<p> 
Albert Gosselin, PRCCís President, informed SYNERGIES that Logan will operate two facilities, one in Glendale and the other in Britain, to manufacture and market the device in the US and European markets. The size of the US market for Loganís asthma device is about $100 million. For more information, contact the Albert Gosselin at 818-247-7601.

<A HREF="http://www.minimed.com"><B>MiniMed Inc.</B></A> (Sylmar, LA County) filed for an initial public offering (IPO) in May 25, 1995. The IPO was underwritten by Smith Barney Inc., Dillon, Read & Co. Inc. and UBS Securities Inc. The firm sold 3.4 million shares at $13 a share. The firm expects the proceeds to be used for general purposes, such as repaying debts, funding acquisitions and improving facilities.  
<p> 
MiniMed was incorporated in 1993. It controls three-quarters of the market for external insulin pumps used by type-I diabetics. The 
firm acquired its microinfusion pump technology from MiniMed Technologies, a limited partnership that spun-off Pacesetter 
Systems in 1980. 
<p> 
MiniMed also makes an implantable pump to release insulin directly into the abdominal cavity. In its prospectus, the firm says that 
its implantable pump ìclosely simulates normal pancreatic delivery and provides patients with even better glycemic control.î 
Although approved for sale in Europe, the pump has not yet been marketed in the US.  
<p> 
MiniMed employs about 280 people in LA County and generates about $36.3 million from sales ó up 300% from 1990. For more 
information, contact Cliff Hague at 818-362-5958.

<B>Navix Inc.</B> (Camarillo, Ventura County) -- A biotech firm founded in 1988 by Ivan Modrovich --  won a research grant of about $2 million from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Last July, NIST selected 24 high technology R&D projects for funding. Navix and Nanogen (San Diego, CA) were the only biomedical firms from Southern California that received such 
funding. According to Jon Gilchrist, CEO, Navix will use its grant to develop rapid, low-cost genetic probes to detect DNA sequences associated with disease. The grant will enable the company to increase the number of employees significantly. For more information, contact Jon Gilchrist at 805-987-7891.

<B>Worldwide Vision Lens</B> (Burbank, LA County) will apply a new cost-effective technology to produce high-quality aspheric 
eyeglass lenses for the mass market. ìSpecialty aspheric lenses have been around for quite some time but are only now beginning to 
gain popularity. Local firms, including Orcolite (Azusa) and Younger Manufacturing (LA), produce them. Eyeglass users like these 
lenses because of their thinness and light-weight. However, they are expensive to produce. We have developed a proprietary 
technology to manufacture these lenses at larger volumes and lower cost,î said Patrick Dundas, co-founder and Executive Vice 
President. Dundas, a former manager at Optical Radiation Corp. (Azusa), teamed up with Greg Burnett, a former employee of 
Barker Optics (Burbank), to establish Worldwide Vision Lens to take advantage of this technology. The firm is currently raising 
capital to scale-up manufacturing. For more information, contact the firm at 818-566-1818.

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="MS SANS SERIF"><B>R</B></FONT>adiology is going digital. During the last 100 years X-ray films have been used to locate broken bones, 
tumors and blockages. But now a new technology called Picture Archiving Communication Systems 
(PACS ) provides a better and cheaper alternative to the X-ray film.  
<P> 
Computer workstations are used to grab scans as soon as they are finished, thereby eliminating the need 
for X-ray film completely. These high resolution workstations can be preset to organize the scans in logical 
relationships. A radiologist can examine the original images, enlarge and annotate them, and produce a 
paper film image having value to the patient, the referring physician and insurance carriers. 
<P>
The trend toward computerization in hospitals and imaging centers is being driven by costs. To put an MRI 
or CT scan on X-ray film can cost $25 or more per scan. This includes the cost of the film, processing, 
couriers, storage and personnel. By contrast, the paper film costs only 12 cents to produce in gray scale. It 
has the patient's name, exam number, date and place of origin embedded in it. X-ray film is a static 
medium that must be stored by law for 7 years for adults and 21 years for children. Instead of storing film 
in warehouses, PACS-based scans can be stored on magnetic tapes or other electronic media. This 
method not only eliminates film, processing, storage and retrieval costs, it also has many environmental 
advantages. 
<P> 
The cost of converting to PACS is very low. Dr. Stuart Schweitzer, a UCLA medical economist, estimates 
that most hospitals and imaging centers will be able to pay for the system in a year or less. Teaching 
hospitals, such as George Washington University Medical Center, USC and UCLA, are among the first 
nationally to install this system. Diana Visintainer of USC said that she was able to cut the cost of X-ray 
film in the imaging center she runs by almost 50% by converting to  a PAC system. According to Dr. 
Schweitzer, the paper film image will save the US health-care industry about $835 million a year. 
<P> 
PAC systems are also convenient. RadNet Corp., a company that runs imaging centers throughout 
California, is one of the first centers to go filmless. The firm conducted surveys of referring physicians who 
received paper film images and found that doctors liked and often preferred them. For the first time a 
physician can share a visual representation of a problem area with her/his patient on paper in her/his 
office. S/he can send the paper film image to an insurance carrier when asking for speedy payment. The 
paper film image is visual proof of her/his diagnosis. Scans can be sent by modem across telephone lines 
for expert opinion. They can be sent from rural areas at odd times of the day or night to more central 
locations which can support a staff of radiologists. They can even be accessed by a distant doctor, with a 
recognized password,  on her/his office or home PC or Mac. The paper film images can be printed on the 
physicianís office copy machine if it has high enough resolution and 256 colors in gray-scale.

This is good news for LA Countyís financially-challenged medical centers and hospitals. The conversion to

<B>NOTE FROM THE EDITOR</B>: 
<P>
According to Health Management Technology  (May 1st, 1995), sales of medical PACS and related 
products reached $349 million in 1993. The market is expected to reach more than $1 billion by the end of 
the century.  
 <P>
Biomedical Synergies' firm database shows that there are over 160 competitors offering PACS and/or 
PAC integration services in the US. Leading vendors include Agfa, Canon U.S.A., DuPont, Fuji, Kodak, 
Lorel, and Siemens.  
 <P>
In California,  the Silicon Valley-based Hewlett Packards and Sun Microsystems offer workstations 
designed for medical picture archiving. Olicon (San Clemente) entered the PACS market in 1980 as 
Raytel. Accuson (Mountain View and Canoga park) produces ultrasound mini-PACS. Cemax-Icon 
(Freemont) -- now owned by 3M (Minneapolis, MN) -- supplies teleradiology systems. Smaller firms, such 
as DR Systems (San Diego), RadMan (Santa Monica) and Vision Ten (Santa Ana) provide software for 
managing radiological information. <I>Ahmed A. Enany</I>

<FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="MS SANS SERIF"><B>F</B></FONT>or years, <a href="http://www.ventura.org/venecon.htm">Ventura County </a>deployed a panoply of fiscal incentives and relied heavily on its locational amenities -- beautiful surroundings, abundant real estate, low crime rate, etc. -- to attract businesses from neighboring counties, particularly from Los Angeles. This strategy paid off in many cases including biomedical research and manufacturing. But the continued effectiveness of this approach in boosting the 
county's industrial employment is in doubt. 
<BR> <BR>
<B>Ventura's Biomedical Industry: </B><BR>
At the moment, Ventura County is home to 88 biomed firms.  These firms employ about 4,260 people 
(1.8% of the 1996  county employment) and generate over $1.3 billion in revenues (see Table 1). 
They are concentrated, as shown in Map 1 below,  in the following cities: <a href="http://www2.ci.camarillo.ca.us/camarillo/">Camarillo</a>, <a href="http://www.ci.oxnard.ca.us/">Oxnard</A>, <a href="http://www.ventura.org/vencity.htm">Ventura</a> and

<BR><BR>
 A close study of the background of these firms reveals that the majority relocated from Los Angeles or 
spun-off from LA-based organizations. The list of significant migrants includes Guardian Sunrise, a 450-
employee maker of equipment for the disabled which relocated from Pacoima to <a href="http://cyber-pages.com/simi/"> 
Simi Valley</a>,  Royce Medical, a Camarillo-based 150-employee manufacturer of orthopedic supports that relocated from West LA, and <a href="http://www.zmi.com/">Zymed</a> (Camarillo), an 84 employee maker of medical monitors that spun-off from Spacelabs Medical (Chatsworth) in 1987.

</TABLE></CENTER>
 <BR><BR>
According to Clyde Pratt, founder of Techmedica and now President of Kinamed (Newbury Park), a 
maker of ceramic orthopedic implants that was once located in Santa Monica, "many Ventura biomed 
entrepreneurs, myself included, wanted to live and work in a place that resembles the Los Angeles of 
yesteryear -- in terms of quality of life, control of urban growth, low cost of doing business, and abundant 
and cheap real estate --  and, at the same time, offers access to the market, resources, and cosmopolitan 
culture of  the Los Angeles of today." 
<BR> <BR>
This has been a strong selling point for all sorts of biomedical ventures. For example, Everest & 
Jennings, once the biggest manufacturer of wheelchairs in the world, relocated from LA to Camarillo in 
1988 to expand and contain the cost of doing business without sacrificing access to resources in LA. Also, 
when <A HREF="http://www.bio.com/companies/amgen.html">Amgen</A> started in 1980, its research director, Winston Salser,  engaged in a complicated locational search resulting in the choice of Thousand Oaks as a home for the new biotech firm. George Rathmann, Amgen's founder, told the LA Times (Nov. 12, 1995) that the choice of Thousand Oaks was the result of plotting and strategy aiming at balancing the desire for nice surroundings -- clean air, cheap housing, good schools, etc. -- with the need to access scientific resources located in LA. 
 <BR><BR>
<B>Locational Amenities are Like Flowers: </B><BR>
Ventura County officials now realize that locational amenities are like flowers: they last while they last. This 
lesson was learned the hard way when significant biomedical employers moved elsewhere for reasons 
similar to those that attracted them to Ventura in the first place.  
<BR><BR> 
For example, Everest & Jennings relocated to St. Louis (MO) in 1992 taking with it 400 jobs. The move 
was intended to reduce the cost of doing business. Ohmeda (Oxnard), a 400-employee maker of 
anesthesia equipment, moved to Singapore seeking lower labor wages. Techmedica (Camarillo), a maker 
of orthopedic implants, was relocated to Texas by its parent, Sulzer Inc., and took with it 100 jobs. Core-
Vent Biomedical Engineering (Camarillo), a manufacturer of dental implants employing 120 people, 
returned recently to Calabasas in LA County to occupy a larger facility. 
<BR><BR>
In addition, Ventura County failed in retaining the biotech executives who left Amgen to start their own 
firms. With the exception of Jim Chamberlain, former manager of business development at Amgen who 
now heads BioSource International (Camarillo), Amgen's executives who departed to form their own 
businesses chose to start elsewhere. The list includes Rathmann who left in 1989 to start Icos in Seattle 
(WA). 
<BR><BR> 
A study released last year by a consulting group hired by county supervisors advised government to adopt 
an activist approach to strengthen six of the countyís healthiest industries to boost employment and put an 
end to firm relocation. Biomedical manufacturing is among the sectors recommended for promotion (LA 
Times, Sep. 19, 1995).  
<BR><BR> 
At the moment, the biomedical industry in Ventura is still trailing aerospace in terms of the number of 
employees. The Stateís Employment Department shows that the countyís aerospace firms employ close to 
5,000 people. But the bet is that aerospace employment will remain stable or continue on its downward 
path, while biomedical jobs will increase significantly. 
<BR><BR>
<B>Sources of Biomedical Job Growth:</B><BR>  
One source of biomedical employment growth will continue to be firms relocating to Ventura from 
neighboring counties if they continue to ignore the needs of their biomed firms. For example, 
Baxter/Hyland Division (Glendale) chose Newbury Park, instead of LA, as the home of its new biotech 
complex. Baxter is developing a 20-acre site on the MGM ranch property near Amgen to house the 
manufacturing of anti-hemophilic factors. The first phase including a 100,000 sq. ft. structure has been 
completed. Company officials told the LA Daily News (Sep. 1, 1993) that its new campus will provide 
about 700 jobs when fully developed by the end of the century. 
<BR> <BR>
Local firm formation around product or process innovations provides another source of employment 
growth. Examples include Auotgenics (Newbury Park), a designer of autologous heart valves; Kottler 
Research (Oxnard), a spin-off from Gingi Pack (Camarillo), that makes dental impression made from sea 
weed; Navix (Camarillo), a spin-off from Medical Analysis Systems (Camarillo), which develops novel 
DNA probes; and Ventrex (Ventura), an Ohmeda spin-off that manufactures blood pressure transducers.  
<BR><BR>
The county is also betting on the expansion of existing firms, particularly Amgen, to boost its share of 
California's expanding biomedical employment. 
<BR><BR>
<B>The Hegemonic Presence of Amgen:</B><BR> 
Ventura is a one-company county where Amgen accounts for most of its biomed jobs. Table 2 below 
shows the firm's unrivalled contribution to local biomedical employment. There is no doubt that the 
fortunes of the county's biomedical industry will be closely tied, at least in the foreseeable future, to that of 
Amgen.

The firm was founded in 1980 to utilize recombinant DNA and molecular biology to manufacture new 
drugs. In 1989, Amgen succeeded in getting FDA approval of its first product, <a href="http://www.keenesentinel.com/~hospital/services/pharm/meds/epoetin.html">Epogen</a>. It is a recombinant 
form of human erythropoietin -- a protein responsible for regulating the production of red blood cells -- 
used in the treatment of anemia associated with chronic renal failure. Amgenís second product, <a href="http://www.keenesentinel.com/~hospital/services/pharm/meds/filgrastim.html">Neupogen</a>, 
was approved in 1991. It is a recombinant granulocyte colony stimulating factor used in combating 
neutropenia, a condition where the body fails to produce sufficient infection-fighting white blood cells. 
Epogen and Neupogen now generate revenues of about $1.6 billion and support Amgenís worldwide 
employment of about 4,000 people, of whom about 2,496 work in the firmís sprawling 1.5 million sq. ft. 
campus in Thousand Oaks. Graph 1 below shows the growth of Amgen's local employment.

<BR><BR>
Several new products are currently under development in hematopoiesis, neurobiology, inflammation and 
soft-tissue repair. If some of these reach the market, Amgen can expand its Ventura County employment 
significantly. According to Chuck Seeger, Amgenís Thousand Oaks site planner, ìWeíve got development 
potential up to 3.8 million square feet and 8,000 people (LA Times, Nov. 12, 1995).î  Amgenís growth 
potential has caused a lot of excitement in the region. Gary Heathcote, Chairman of the Conejo Valley 
chamber of Commerce, told the LA Daily News (April 10, 1994): ìWeíre going to be the biotechnology hub 
of the world.î 
 <BR><BR>
<B>Uncertainties and Challenges: </B><BR>
But growing a self-sustaining biomedical industry is not going to be without challenges. For one thing, the 
county is disadvantaged by the lack of research and educational institutions comparable to UCLA or 
Caltech serving as sources of biomed innovations and start-ups. Local firms can certainly rely on the 
scientific resources existing in neighboring counties in building critical mass in segments such as 
biotechnology. But, according to Bob Guthrie of Ventrex, if Los Angeles deploys effective incentives to 
localize the outcome its biomedical research, Ventura will find it increasingly difficult to attract the talent 
and start-ups necessary to boost the regionís biomedical employment. 
<BR> <BR>
In addition, if  plans for reforming the national health care system emphasize price controls and cost 
containment, the potential of Venturaís biomedical industry may, according to Clyde Pratt of Kinamed, be 
stymied.  
 <BR><BR>
Also, the January 1994 Northridge Earthquake reminded everyone of the vulnerability of the Southern 
California economy to natural disasters. The earthquake may have put the local expansion plans of many 
Southland firms on hold, and this should be of concern to those who are counting on Amgen and Baxter to 
boost Venturaís biomedical employment.   
 <BR><BR>
On May 18, 1995, John Matulich, Manager of Development of Facilities at Amgen, told members of the 
Greater LA Chapter of the International Society of Pharmaceutical Engineers (ISPE) gathered at the 
Red Lion Hotel in Glendale that the Northridge shaker forced management to rethink its plans for 
expansion in Thousand Oaks. He pointed that it makes sense for Amgen to emphasize expansion out of 
Southern California to minimize the effect of future earthquakes on the firmís operations. 
<BR> <BR>
Furthermore, Ventura has relied on its locational amenities to attract many biomedical firms, but little has 
been done to entice these firms to dig deeper roots in the local economy. As a result, area firms can be 
easily poached by regions offering more attractive surroundings and incentives for relocation.  
<BR><BR> 
Finally, like their counterparts in LA, Venturaís biomedical firms have not developed a collective identity, 
and  they rarely interact with each other to explore creative strategies to meet the increasing challenges of 
research and manufacturing. Jon Gilchrist of Navix lamented this lack of networking among local firms. He 
argued that if this trend continues, local firms will find themselves increasingly at a disadvantage. 
<BR><BR>
<B>Planning for the Future: </B><BR>
Networking and building institutions for collective action, particularly if carried out in collaboration with their 
counterparts in LA, will enable firms to mitigate some of the uncertainties described above. Local 
entrepreneurs realize that collective action and networking can serve firms at least in four areas. 
<BR> <BR>
(a) Collective action will maximize their voice in issues such as the reform of the health care system, FDA 
reform, and continued federal funding of biomedical research.  
 <BR><BR>
(b) Networking will create opportunities for pooling complementary resources to reduce the cost, spread 
the risk, and accelerate the process of product development. 
<BR><BR>
(c) Entrepreneurs can also learn how to collectively overcome shortages of critical inputs necessary for 
growth. Labor availability is a case in point. Although most firms consider labor to be abundant, Gary 
Hutchinson of Zymed argues that ìthere are shortages in critical areas, such as in programmers with 
experience in Windows or NT environments.î Jon Gilchrist points to possible future shortages of 
technicians with biotech-related skills. Such problems can be collectively anticipated and solved in 
collaboration with local training programs. 
 <BR><BR>
(d) Entrepreneurs can collectively educate policy makers about how to customize business development 
programs to insure industry growth. In general, area firms are discouraged by the giveaway game that 
local municipalities play using taxpayers' money to entice out-of-area businesses to locate in their 
communities (LA Times, June 4, 1995). Biomed entrepreneurs would like to see, instead, a focused 
strategy for building critical mass in niche segments of the industry. 
 <BR><BR>
Jon Gilchrist of Navix contends that such a strategy should emphasize, among other things, building 
biomedical incubators. According to Jim Chamberlain of BioSource : ìAn incubator can go a long way in 
signaling the commitment of local policy makers to the industry and laying down the infrastructure for 
creating a critical mass of firms in promising areas such as medical electronics or biotechnology.î  
 <BR><BR>
Chamberlain and Gilchrist also call for the creation of a public-private fund dedicated to investing in local 
start-ups. Willard Eyer of Rx Rocker (Newbury Park), a maker of wheelchairs, agrees. "Most area firms 
are either too young or too risky to qualify for traditional financing. In addition, venture capital tend to 
attract only to the high-end segment of the industry leaving many firms in other segments cash-starved. A 
concerted effort should be done locally to correct this situation," he said.  
 <BR><BR>
Maximizing export opportunities is another area ripe for collective action. This is of importance to firms 
competing in flat or slowly growing market segments in the US.  
Vic Pollard, President of Vic Pollard Dental Products (Newbury Park) contends that these firms can find 
growth in foreign markets if incentives and information are made available to them.   
<BR> <BR>
His ten-employee firm that produces diamond-tipped drills and other dental products has struck gold in the 
Russian market. The small firm forged a number of partnerships that netted it $5 million since 1992.  He 
said: ìI knew about this opportunity by accident through contacts I had with the US Commerce 
Department, and nobody prepared us for the daunting Russian business climate.î He would like to see 
local activism in enabling firms to operate effectively in foreign markets. 
 <BR><BR>
Taking such action steps will allow Ventura County to sustain and grow its biomedical industry, even if the 
county looses many of its locational amenities. The experience of <a href="http://www.silvalonline.com/index.html">Silicone Valley</a> in Northern California is instructive. Despite the region's numerous urban problems -- crowdedness, pollution, high cost of housing, etc. -- it continues to reign as the world capital of the semiconductor industry. Networking and an intricate 
web of collaborative relations enable area firms to maintain their edge in research and manufacturing. </FONT>

<FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="MS SANS SERIF"><B>T</B></FONT>he scene is the Edison Electric Light Company in Menlo Park, New Jersey. The date is October 1, 1880. 
Thomas Edison has just officially begun factory production of the electrical light bulb. In this fictitious 
account, Edison is visited by two inspectors from the FDA. In this surprise visit, Mr. Edison is told of how 
the FDA is now regulating the electric light business. To Mr. Edison's surprise, the design process is one of 
the areas which is regulated by the government. Edison is given some very disturbing questions to answer: 
<BR><BR>
<B>FDA:</B> This electric light bulb is a very clever invention. You must have had some sort of plan in order to 
come up with such a novel idea. Could we please see your design and development plan that identifies 
each design and development activity and the persons responsible for each activity? 
 <BR><BR>
<B><B>Edison:</B></B> My plan was really quite simple, yet comprehensive: Electricity to effect exact imitation of all done 
by gas, to replace lighting by gas by lighting by electricity. To improve the illumination to such an extent as 
to meet all requirements of natural, artificial and commercial conditions. My great effort - not to make a 
large light or a blinding light, but a small light having the mildness of gas. As for the persons responsible 
for each activity, there were dozens of machinists, physicists, chemists, and laborers employed as needed. 
 <BR><BR> 
<B>FDA:</B> We'd like to see your design input requirements, including the intended use of the device, the needs 
of the user, and the approval of designated qualified individuals. 
 <BR><BR>
<B>Edison:</B> It's really very simple. I just wanted to replace the present system of gas lighting by an electrical 
lighting system. The light bulb needed to be both practical and economically feasible for use by the 
ordinary individual. 
 <BR><BR>
<B>FDA:</B> Please show us your procedures for verification of the device design, and give us the names of the 
competent personnel who have been assigned to such activity. 
 <BR><BR> 
<B>Edison:</B> Verifying the device design was quite obvious - if it didn't blow up or burn out, it was a success. 
As for competent personnel, I did the testing myself with the assistance of some of my associates. Who 
would assign such an important task to incompetent personnel anyway? 
 <BR><BR> 
<B>FDA:</B> We hope you are able to show us the documentation for your design review, which has been 
performed by qualified individuals who did not have direct responsibility for the design development. 
 <BR><BR> 
<B>Edison:</B> Why would I have someone who did not have direct responsibility for the design development 
review my design? Anyone who was not familiar with our efforts would not have been competent to judge 
us. Just consider this: we have an almost infinitesimal filament heated to a degree which is difficult to 
comprehend, and it is in a vacuum under conditions of which we are wholly ignorant. You cannot use your 
eyes to help you, and you really know nothing of what is going on in that tiny bulb. I speak without 
exaggeration when I say that I have constructed 3,000 different theories in connection with the electric 
light, each of them reasonable and apparently likely to be true. Yet in two cases only did my experiments 
prove the truth of my theory. 
 <BR><BR> 
<B>FDA:</B> Then we presume you have no design output to show us either. 
 <BR><BR>
<B>Edison:</B> Nothing except for a working light bulb and several volumes of my lab notebooks. 
 <BR><BR>
<B>FDA:</B> How about your procedures which ensure that the design basis for your light bulb and its 
components are correctly translated into production specifications? 
 <BR><BR>
<B>Edison:</B> If you're looking for production procedures, I can show you that. After all, what competent 
manufacturer would attempt to build anything in production quantity without first reducing it to a written 
procedure? 
 <BR><BR>
<B>FDA:</B> No, Mr. Edison. We are looking for a procedure which describes how your design is to be translated 
into a production procedure. 
 <BR><BR>
<B>Edison:</B> I can't help you there. Next question. 
 <BR><BR>
<B>FDA:</B> What about your documentation of design release? We'd like to see that designated individuals have 
reviewed all records required for the design history record to insure that the design history file is complete 
and that the final design is consistent with the approved design plan before releasing the design. 
 <BR><BR> 
<B>Edison:</B> Huh? 
 <BR><BR>
<B>FDA:</B> Let's see your procedures for the identification, documentation, validation, review, and approval of 
design changes. 
 <BR><BR>
<B>Edison:</B> All of my efforts have been documented in my lab notebooks. I followed a basic rule which I 
learned early in my career - whatever happens, write it down! Whatever I have to show you is in my lab 
notebook. With the 3,000 theories I tried, I didn't have time to write meticulous procedures as you have 
suggested, nor would this have improved the design process any. In fact, such structure would most likely 
have clouded the thinking of my research group. 
 <BR><BR>
<B>FDA:</B> One final request. We'd like to see your design history record containing or referencing all records 
necessary to demonstrate that the design was developed in accordance with the approved design plan. 
 <BR><BR>
<B>Edison:</B> As I have said, everything I have to show you is in my lab notebooks. Nothing fancy, just some 
hand-written notes and sketches. If I had to formally document all of my 3,000 different theories, we would 
not have a light bulb. By the way, don't you guys have something more productive to do? 
 <BR><BR>
<B><CENTER>********************************</B></CENTER>
 <BR><BR>
Thomas Alva Edison is one of America's legendary folk heros. Most people remember him for his 
development of the light bulb. Many don't realize that the light bulb was just a part of the electrical power 
distribution system for which he was the chief architect. Edison's 1,093 U.S. patents (the largest number 
ever issued to a single person) included pioneering work in the telephone, sound recording, and motion 
picture industries. 
 <BR><BR> 
One can only wonder at the negative effect that government imposed design controls would have had on 
Edison. As Robert Friedel describes for us: "The invention of the electric light was a complex, human 
achievement, and we shall not understand it unless we fully appreciate that fact. This may seem to be an 
obvious truth, but little that has been written about the event has taken it into account. This invention, like 
most inventions, was the accomplishment of men guided largely by their common sense and their past 
experience, taking advantage of whatever knowledge and news should come their way, willing to try many 
things that didn't work, but knowing just how to learn from failures to build up gradually the base of facts, 
observations, and insights that allow the occasional lucky guess - some would call it inspiration - to effect 
success."<sup><small>[1]</small></sup> 
 <BR><BR> 
It is absurd to think that Edison might have written down a research plan including design input, then to 
have built his light bulb, and then to have compared his design output with his design input to see if he 
succeeded. The process of invention is never such a straightforward and predictable process. Edison gives 
us some insight into the design process in a revealing letter of November 1878: 
 <BR><BR> 
"It has been just so in all my inventions. The first step is an intuition - and comes with a burst, then 
difficulties arise. This thing gives out and then that - 'bugs' - as such little faults and difficulties are called - 
show themselves and months of anxious watching, study and labor are requisite before commercial 
success - or failure - is certainly reached .... I have the right principle and am on the right track, but time, 
hard work and some good luck are necessary too ...."<sup><small>[2]</small></sup> 
 <BR><BR> 
The trial-and-error approach, so common to inventors, is described by Edison: 
 <BR><BR>
"I would construct a theory and work on its lines until I found it untenable, then it would be discarded and 
another theory evolved. This was the only possible way for me to work out the problem ..."<sup><small>[2]</small></sup>
 <BR><BR>
Edison once said that "negative results are as just  valuable as positive results." Walter Mallory once 
offered Edison his condolences upon learning that after several months of experimentation, there had been 
no progress in his development of the storage battery. Edison's reply was: "Why man, I've got a lot of 
results. I know several thousand things that won't work."<sup><small>[2]</small></sup>
 <BR><BR>
To Edison, the term "Design Controls" would have been an oxymoron. You cannot plan what you are going 
to design, in the same way that one follows a cookbook to bake a cake. When Edison was once asked 
about the laboratory rules and regulations, he exclaimed, "Hell there ain't no rules around here! We're tryin' 
to accomplish somep'n."<sup><small>[2]</small></sup>
 <BR><BR> 
Although Edison was informal in his methods, he wrote down all that he did. The documents he left behind 
are said to contain more than three and a half million pages. Friedel describes this documentation: "While 
there is nothing inherently incomprehensible about the notes, correspondence, and other papers generated 
in the Menlo Park Laboratory, they are definitely not like the more literary records usually left by a political 
figure, writer or businessman. They are the creations of men, immersed in the mechanical, electrical, and 
chemical knowledge of their day, attacking some very bedeviling technical problems. If the record they left 
behind them is generally without comprehensive explanation for their activities and ideas or interpretations 
of their abbreviated notes and scribblings, it should be no surprise. Indeed, those few documents that do 
seem to delineate more fully the ideas and purposes behind laboratory activity must be looked upon with 
suspicion, for they often turn out to be creations after the fact, put together for purposes of publicity or 
legal convenience."<sup><small>[1]</small></sup> 
 <BR><BR>
One often wonders, given the myriad of "Design Controls" that biomedical manufacturers have to conform 
with, what will become of innovation? I suspect that it will become an idea studied in history books. 
Product development will be reduced to incremental changes - adding a color display to a patient monitor, 
or providing an alarm which goes "beep-beep" instead of "beep."  
 <BR><BR> 
Edison is often quoted as saying: "Genius is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration." One has to wonder how 
much room is left for innovation when so much perspiration is due to government regulation. Would we 
have light bulbs today if this had been the case in Edison's time?

<FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="MS SANS SERIF"><B>T</B></FONT>he U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has been developing standards for medical devices for a 
number of years.  The FDA has submitted the final draft of the<a href="http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/sacgmp.html"> 
CURRENT GOOD MANUFACTURING PRACTICE FINAL RULE (CGMP)</a>.  The rule may have the name changed to "Quality System."  This rule may go into effect sometime in 1996.  It will require all Class III, II and some Class I devices to comply 
with the requirement.  This will require all devices containing software to comply.  The rule has been 
"Harmonized" to bring it in line with international standards like the  <a href="http://tecnet1.jcte.jcs.mil:8000/htdocs/teinfo/directives/pub/pub94i.html">ISO-9001-1994</a> Quality Standard and 
it includes certain additional requirements that focus on public health. 
<P> 
<a href="http://www.qadas.com/qadas/iso/dod/backgrou.html">ISO-9001</a> is a conceptual model of how to provide high quality products. The  standard does not define 
how to  implement a product development process, but rather, requires the manufacturer to: (1) define the 
desired process, (2) document the defined process, and (3) work to the documented procedures.  The 
model has 20 specific areas of focus that must be addressed in order to become qualified.  A comparison 
and intensity of focus is shown in Table 1.

<P>
The manufacturer must document virtually every aspect of the product development and manufacturing 
process.  The main focus areas of the standard are on the manufacturing aspects of the product.  The 
standard is weak in the early aspects of the product definition and concept development.  Only one focus 
area (Design Control) touches on the early engineering aspect of the development process.  The Design 
Control section is also the area that the FDA has recently added to the rule, and one that has caused much 
concern during the public review process.  
<P> 
The design control section will require  developers of the product to create detailed development plans, 
conduct and document formal design reviews, define complete product requirements (Design Input), 
complete product documentation (Design Output), define conformance to requirements, as well as create a 
"Design History File and Record." In short,  manufacturers will be required to demonstrate that everything 
about the product and process is understood, documented and implemented correctly. 
<P> 
Many manufacturers, especially small ones, are concerned about the interpretation, cost and effort 
required to implement the rule. Design control will place far greater demands on the  engineering of the 
product, especially in the early phases of development. Manufacturers can, of course, petition for relief 
from these requirements. However, the FDA has made it clear that they will take a hard line at giving 
concessions. Those who do not have the design control requirements in place now face a steep learning 
curve and have to pay the high cost of creating and implementing the 
new rules. Attempting to carry out this task on their own by trial and error can be risky and time-
consuming.  
<P> 
An alternative approach is to learn through interaction with other biomedical entrepreneurs who 
implemented the ISO-9001 standard successfully. I have shown that the FDA's CGMP is similar in many 
respects to this standard. Southern California is home to many world-class biomedical firms operating 
according to the ISO-9001 rules. Biomedical entrepreneurs who have to meet the FDA's new design 
control requirements can draw on the experience of these firms to learn to meet the challenges of CGMP.  
<P> 
It is possible to facilitate this type of interaction through CGMP workshops that local industry associations, 
such as the Southern California  Biomedical Council, can organize. These workshops should be 
designed carefully to facilitate collective learning. My experience with roundtable groups such as 
So/Cal/Ten and World-Class Manufacturing Practices, where entrepreneurs from various industries 
meet regularly to teach each other how to cope with engineering and design control problems, shows how 
effective this type of learning can be.

<CENTER><I> Allen J. Scott, Ph.D.</I></CENTER>
<BR><BR><BR><BR>
<FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="MS SANS SERIF"><B>P</B></FONT>ublic Policy commonly deals in practice with regional industrial development by engaging in activities such 
as the provision of urban amenities, land-use planning, the mitigation of pollution problems, and various 
direct and indirect fiscal incentives. In this standard approach, an arsenal of subsidies and tax relief 
measures is typically deployed by municipalities in an effort to attract new industrial investments. often 
without proper scrutiny of the total social costs involved.  
<BR><BR>
I suggest an alternative approach involving a bottom-up strategy for reorganizing the local economy. 
Economic competitiveness and growth can be much improved by policies that take direct aim at the 
regional production system as such.  
<BR><BR>
This is because the market mechanism alone cannot insure growth and efficiency. It is important to keep in 
mind that the very existence of markets is contingent on a framework of social norms and institutions. 
These include legal conventions, managerial ideologies and practices, structures of inter-firm 
collaboration, forms of worker socialization, traditions of craftsmanship, and reputation effects.  Such 
norms shape the manner of the marketís operation. Markets need to be augmented by means of collective 
action on at least three important fronts. 
<BR><BR>
(a) Critical inputs and services supplied as public goods. Technological research, labor training, 
information about export opportunities are examples. 
<BR><BR> 
(b) Firm collaboration in production tasks makes it possible to achieve more efficient outcomes. But its 
attainment is dependent on the willingness of firms to sacrifice some of their autonomy for the sake of 
higher aggregate levels of productivity. Organized collaboration between firms makes it possible for them 
to learn from each other and to pool critical technologies and labor skills in the interests of superior 
combinations of productive resources. Regional industrial consortia, such as the Southern California 
Biomedical Council (SCBC), and public-private partnerships are among the myriad ways of stimulating this 
sort of collaboration. 
<BR><BR> 
(c) Forums for strategic choice and action are also essential for regional economic success in the modern 
world. Tasks such as securing trade-marks for regional producers, and heading off short-term wage and 
price competition that might undermine the long-term viability of regional producers as a group are 
important here. 
<BR><BR>
Such tasks might be performed by local government bodies, associations of relevant civil parties such as 
employers and workers, or any number of different kinds of private-public consortia or partnerships. The 
point here is simply to aver that there is an important and positive role for institutions of collective action to 
play in local industrial development.  
<BR><BR>
This role is significant, not just in promoting industrial growth, but also in securing the commitment of all 
the major parties in the region to continued and creative participation and thus to the reinforcement of the 
social cohesion of the entire regional economy. 
<BR><BR> 
This proposed approach is all the more urgent in view of the challenges posed by the intensified 
competition unleashed by economic globalization. Most intense competition comes precisely from regions 
in Germany, Italy, Japan, Singapore and Taiwan that have made substantial progress toward addressing 
problems of regional economic coordination and planning.  
<BR><BR>
As we shift increasingly into the new global framework of flexible regional production systems, institutions 
of collective industrial coordination supplementing the market mechanism will become essential for 
building and sustaining long-term regional competitive advantages. In this context, stand-alone producers 
and fragmented regional economies are likely to find themselves increasingly at a competitive 
disadvantage. </FONT>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE =4 FACE="ARIAL"><B>SCBC ORGANIZED A WORKSHOP ON DESIGN CONTROLS 
</B></FONT></CENTER><BR>
<CENTER>By</CENTER>

<CENTER><I>Ahmed A. Enany</I></CENTER>
<BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT SIZE=6 FACE="SCRIPT"><B>O</B></FONT>n March 25, the Southern California Biomedical Council (SCBC) held a successful workshop dealing with the FDA's proposed design controls for medical device makers. These controls are detailed in the FDA's 217-page document entitled: "Medical Devices; Working Draft of the Current Good 
Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) Final Rule."  
 <p>
About 70 biomed industry executives participated in the workshop which featured presentations by Michael 
Stokke, Supervisory Consumer Safety Officer, FDA's Los Angeles District Office; Brian Donato, Partner, 
Human, Phelps & McNamara; Donald Smith, Program Manager, California Manufacturing Technology 
Center; Michael O'Hara, GMP Specialist, Ehrlich-Rominger; and Edward LaBudde, Manager, LaBudde 
Systems. 
<p> 
Michael Stokke mentioned that the list of the most frequently cited problems observed by FDA inspectors in 
Southern California includes incomplete or lacking DHRs, inadequate calibration of equipment, incomplete 
DMRs, inadequate component inspection, inadequate complaint handling systems, and lacking or 
inadequate quality assurance. These are among the problem areas targeted by the FDA's proposed design 
controls.  
<p> 
The intended harmonization of these controls with the ISO-9000 rules is, according to Brian Donato, an 
admirable goal.  He added that, to enforce these controls without triggering panic among manufacturers, 
"the FDA has to change its culture of product inspection, work patiently with firms to insure conformity, and 
solve ambiguities contained in the proposed design controls." This, he explained, is one of the goals of his 
Orange County's Grassroots Regulatory Partnership which provides a forum to enhance FDA-industry 
communication. 
<p> 
Smith, O'Hara and LaBudde do not expect any dramatic changes in the FDA's final list of design controls 
which are applicable to manufacturers of devices classified under class I (only if the device contains or is 
driven by software), II and III. They therefore urged manufacturers to start  complying with ISO-9000 as 
soon as possible. This is a task that could take on average between 6 to 12 months to accomplish. They all 
listed numerous resources and strategies of concurrent engineering that firms can rely on to insure 
conformity with the new design controls without affecting the speed of product development.

<BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="ARIAL"><FONT SIZE=6 FACE="SCRIPT"><B>D</B></FONT>uring his visit to Los Angeles last March, Dr. Greg Milman, Chief of Pathogenesis and Basic Research 
Branch at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), met with biomedical firms in 
Greater Los Angeles to highlight new features of the Small Business Innovative Research Grant (SBIR) 
program. The meeting, which was organized by the Southern California Biomedical Council, took place 
on March 12 at the Economic Development Corporation of Los Angeles (EDC).  
 <p>
Dr. Milman informed participants that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) will allocate $200 million in 
the form of SBIR grants to small biomedical businesses during 1996. He explained that any US-owned 
biomedical business with less than 500 employees can apply for SBIR grants from the NIH. He added that 
"this is an opportunity for a business to obtain seed funding to support research and development activities 
without relinquishing equity or incurring debt." 
<p> 
The following are among the program's new features: 
 
<UL><LI>The caps on "first phase" and "second phase" grants have been raised to  $100,000 and $750,000 
respectively; 
<LI> Businesses can apply for both phases at the same time; 
<LI> A fast track system went into effect. As a result, grant applications now take less than 4 months to be 
processed; and 
<LI> About 1 in 4 first phase and 1 in 3 second phase applications are approved. 
</UL>
<p> 
Rohit Shukla of the Los Angeles Regional technology Alliance (LARTA) informed the participants that his 
organization can provide matching grants to biomedical businesses that succeed in obtaining SBIR funding. 
<p> 
Deadlines for submitting SBIR grant applications are: April 15, August 15 and December 15.

<BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE=6 FACE="SCRIPT"><B>B</B></FONT><FONT FACE="ARIAL">iomaterials are substances used in therapeutic and diagnostic systems that come in contact with tissues 
and biological fluids inside the human body. According to Peppas and Langer, biomaterials are found in 
2700 medical devices, 2500 diagnostic products and 39,000 drugs.<sup>[1] </sup>
<P>
Kiki Hellman of the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiologic Health estimates that about 11 million 
Americans have some form of bio-compatible materials implanted in their bodies.<sup>[2]</sup> Examples include 
pacemakers, hip and joint replacement, silicone used in breast implants and  Dacron-based vascular grafts. 
 <P> 
Although these biomaterials have had a tremendous health impact, many generate side-effects that the 
medical community is struggling with. As a result, the search is still going on for better materials. New 
medical uses for glasses, ceramics, polymers, and metals are currently being explored in biomedical 
research centers throughout the US. 
 <P> 
<B>Examples:</B> <BR>
BioGlass, for example, developed by L.L. Hench, University of Florida, has the ability to form an intimate 
bond with living tissue. BioGlass has been demonstrated to promote bone growth for such applications as 
mandibular augmentation (jaw bone replacement) and replacing damage to the middle ear.  
 <P> 
Radioactive glass microbeads containing yttrium, invented by Prof. Delbert Day, University of Missouri-
Rolla, have proven effective in treating liver cancer. Marketed by Nordion in Canada, the treated 
microspheres are injected into the hepatic artery and preferentially attach themselves to the surface of 
malignant tumors, releasing levels of radiation to the tumor far higher than is now possible with 
conventional therapies.  
 <P> 
Membrane biopolymers, first pioneered by Prof. Robert Langer of MIT, are now being exploited for drug 
delivery systems, artificial skin, and tissue encapsulation. Several research institutions, including Oak 
Ridge National Lab and the Naval Research Lab, are developing fiber-optic biosensors for such varied 
potential applications as blood glucose measurement, antibody detection, and virus detection.  
 <P> 
Professor J. D. Mackenzie and Eric Bescher at UCLA have recently developed a novel material called 
"ormosil" doped with antibodies for the detection of micro-organisms, such as cryptosporidium parvum, 
which is potentially fatal to immuno-compromised individuals. 
 <P> 
These are but a few examples of the recent explosion of new applications resulting from increased 
collaboration between the medical research community, material scientists and biochemists. But successful 
commercialization of these new applications requires two types of reform: FDA reform and tort reform.  
  <P>
<B>FDA Reform:</B> <BR>
Materials used in medicine find their principal use in biomedical devices. Both biomedical device 
manufacturers and providers face challenges often far surpassing those of pharmaceutical manufacturers. 
Some biomed devices and materials require approvals from two or more FDA centers. Because of the difficulties 
associated with FDA approval, California medical device CEOs report, on average, 15-20 percent of their 
total staff is overseas.<sup>[3]</sup> 
  <P>
Increasingly, new technologies are introduced into clinical trials in Europe first, resulting in European 
patients receiving the benefit of pioneering breakthrough technologies, developed in the US, before 
American patients. 
 <P> 
In addition, the entire clinical infrastructure required to support large scale clinical trials must be 
transplanted to Europe as well. This includes lab analysts, vendors and regulatory consultants. This costs 
our state and our nation thousands of good jobs. 
  <P>
<B>Tort Reform:</B> <BR>
Another challenge to biomedical materials is current product liability laws. In particular, a number of raw 
materials providers, such as Dow Chemicals, DuPont, and Dow Corning, have pulled materials from the 
market used in the manufacture of biomedical devices. The potential threat of being dragged into a major 
class action liability suit is driving many biomaterials suppliers away from the medical device industry. 
Without tort reform, thousands of Americans could be denied access to life-saving products for which there 
are few or no substitutes. 
  <P>
One ray of hope, however, is "The Biomaterials Access Assurance Act," first introduced last year by 
Senators John McCain (R-AZ) and Joe Lieberman (D-CT) and Representative George Gekas (R-PA), who 
have pledged to reintroduce their bill before Congress adjourns in October. Passage of this bill will help 
address this critical problem.

<FONT SIZE=6 FACE="SCRIPT"><B>T</B></FONT><FONT FACE="ARIAL">he growth potential of biomaterials is now recognized by observers of the biomedical industry. The UK-based Clinica Reports estimates that the world market for advanced biomaterial-based products will grow by 13.6% a year to reach a value of $15.2 billion by the end of the century.<sup>[1]</sup> The main areas of future growth include: <BR>

<UL>
<LI> The controlled release of drugs;
<LI> Artificial skin, cartilage and other body parts; 
<LI> Orthopaedic and wound care activities; and 
<LI> The cardiovascular and incontinence sectors. 
 </UL>
<P>
Some segments of the biomaterial product market may grow faster than others. A study released last year by Frost & 
Sullivan projects a whopping 24% compound growth rate of absorbable and erodable biomaterial products, from $466 
million in 1994 to $2.1 billion in 2001. This is a sub-segment of the biomaterial products market that includes collagen, 
hyaluronic acid, gelatin products, and polymers such as polyolactic acid.<sup>[2]</sup> 
 <P>
Although the US market for biomaterials is dominated by big firms, such as DuPont or DePuy, many small firms have 
made inroads into  the research-intensive, advanced materials segment of this market. A recent survey conducted by 
CorpTech<sup>[3]</sup> of 17 of these firms found that 41% plan to expand their work force during 1997 by an average of 10.8%. 
 <P>
Southern California is home to numerous firms producing biomaterials-based products. But a small fraction (see Table 1) 
is taking advantage of research in advanced materials to produce new body parts or implants.

<P>
Medical products based on advanced materials is a segment of the biomedical market that should be targeted for 
promotion. The growth of this segment can be fueled by innovations generated by local universities and research 
institutions. At the moment, there are numerous research programs carried out in the Southland to explore medical uses 
of advanced biomaterials. A sample is provided in Table 2 which focuses only on those projects currently funded by the 
National Institutes of Health (NIH). With proper technology transfer mechanisms and investment incentives, some of 
this research is bound to be the source of new firm formation and job generation in the area.

<FONT FACE="ARIAL"><BR><CENTER>By</CENTER></FONT>
<FONT FACE="ARIAL"><CENTER><BR><I><B>James Lucas</B></I></CENTER></FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=6 FACE="SCRIPT"><B>I</B></FONT><FONT FACE="ARIAL">magine the frustration of the founder of a medical firm in Orange County. After making good on his commitments to a venture capital firm, he became a millionaire when he took his company public.  On his office wall, he proudly displayed the $20-million check raised in the initial public stock offering (IPO) to 
finance the firm's growth.  Yet, his success was to be short lived. His stock price would tumble and he'd lose control of his company -- just when its operations were beginning to make serious money.  It happened because he didn't see the value of credibility and the price he'd have to pay when it was in short supply. 

<P>
Soon after the IPO, as the CEO painted an optimistic picture of rising earnings, the stock, as shown in 
Graph 1, hit $14 a share.  The CEO learned he could push up the price by telling Wall Street that future 
earnings would rise. If a discouraging projection would depress the stock price, then the CEO saw no 
incentive to guard his credibility.  After all, a higher stock price meant lower costs for the next round of 
capital needed to fuel growth. 
<P>
<CENTER>Graph 1 <BR>
<B>Credibility & Stock Price Fell Together  </B><BR></CENTER>

<CENTER><img src="stock.jpg" align=middle width=324 height=151 Alt=Stock Price Chart></CENTER>
<P> 
In the end, the stock price eroded with the CEO's credibility: it fell to $6 after a securities analyst, feeling 
betrayed, projected earnings that were sharply below the expectations the CEO had raised.  The analyst 
was right and, for nearly a year, the stock price remained stubbornly low.   As  Graph 1 shows, it rebounded 
only when the frustrated CEO sold out to a competitor.  
<P> 
For public and private firms alike, the credibility of management is a crucial asset that figures prominently in 
the calculation of a firm's value and its cost of capital. Further, in medical technology firms, the credibility of management affects more than just stock prices.  When the promise of a new technology is hard to explain -- and when customer trust is crucial -- credibility can make the difference in the success of marketing as well as investor communications.  That is why 
credibility -- which is both inexpensive and easily acquired -- should be a cornerstone in every 
management's communications plan. 
<P> 
<B>Quantitative Evidence: </B><BR>
The best evidence into the effects of credibility can be found in the stocks of publicly traded companies, 
where statistical measurements are abundant.  Although "credibility" is hard to quantify, a UC-Berkeley 
professor of law and accounting published a landmark study into a close proxy of credibility:  the study 
correlated the valuations (or, prices) of stocks with the disclosure policies of their managers.  In particular, 
he examined the effects of conservative disclosure policies -- that is, when managers consistently disclose 
all material news, good or bad, in a timely and uniform way.  
<P> 
Firms with conservative disclosure policies tended to have higher valuations relative to their cash flows, 
according to the researcher, Lev Baurch. He found that managers make their firms more valuable when 
they disclose news in a uniform and timely manner; when their statements are consistent; when they have a 
bias toward action in disclosing news; and when they help their constituents understand the factors that 
affect the future of the firm's technologies and finances. 
<P> 
Of particular interest to small and fast-growing biomedical firms, he wrote:  "The benefits of an effective 
disclosure strategy are usually relatively greater for small companies, especially those operating in new or 
unusual high-tech businesses with a limited following among professional investment analysts.  These are 
the companies most often misunderstood, suspect and therefore misvalued by others." 
<P> 
Managers can see the practical workings of credibility when they watch sophisticated investors decide how 
much to pay for a company.  Investors' valuations usually reflect the firm's future cash flows, discounted to 
present value.  Of course, communications -- and the efforts to establish credibility -- cannot affect one 
variable: the historic cash flows.  Communications can, however, influence another variable: the discounting 
to present value the future cash flows.  Embedded in this calculation is a discount rate that reflects 
perceptions of  the risks inherent in an industry, a firm and its stock. 
<P> 
A well-executed communications program works to  persuade investors to pay a higher valuation relative to 
the firm's cash flows.  It maximizes a firm's value by helping investors understand the business and 
accurately forecast its future, thereby reducing the discount for risk that might also be explained as the cost 
of credibility. 
<P> 
<B>Inexpensive, Easily Acquired:</B><BR> 
An emphasis on credibility adds little to the cost of a communications program, whose diverse elements 
might range from media relations to trade shows to the annual report and investor meetings.  Yet, an 
emphasis on credibility ensures that managers can get the most from every dollar they invest in 
communications. 
<P> 
For the marketers of biomedical technologies that are both complex and have profound human costs, trust 
is the  building block to long-term economic value. It can ease the paths to market for new products and 
open the doors to premium prices and customer loyalty.  
<P> 
Managers like the Orange County CEO make a mistake when they favor salesmanship and "hype" over 
credibility.  Wall Street is cluttered with the wreckages of great companies whose managements  
paid a too-high price after sacrificing short-term gains for long-term credibility.

University-Industry Alliances as a Pillar of California's Knowledge Value Economy</FONT></B></FONT></CENTER>

<FONT FACE="ARIAL"><CENTER><BR><I><B>Ahmed A. Enany</B></I></CENTER></FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=6 FACE="SCRIPT"><B>B</B></FONT><FONT FACE="ARIAL">elieve it or not, there is still gold in California. And contrary to the Gatlin Brother's song, it is not all "in a bank in the middle of Beverly Hills, in somebody else's name." It is actually in universities and research institutions whose knowledge production and accumulation can provide technological support for economic growth. It is also "in our names" because this research is mostly funded by taxpayers' money in the form of grants allocated by such governmental agencies as the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the National Science Foundation (NSF), the Department of Energy (DOE) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).  
<p> 
<B>Knowledge Value  as California's Gold: </B><BR>
Mining this gold is essential to grow Californiaís "knowledge value" economy: the key to the stateís future prosperity.<sup>[1]</sup>  This is an economy based on science-dependent, information-intensive and creative industries such as entertainment, 
environmental remediation, multimedia, communication, and biomedicine. In this new economy, creating effective bridges 
linking the state's knowledge centers and industry is key to competitiveness. 
<P> 
California seems to have a natural lock on knowledge value. This is the result of the stateís historical commitment to, and 
investment in building institutions of research and intellectual accumulation. Nowhere is this more obvious than in the case 
of life sciences. The state is home to some of the countryís most prolific centers of biological and medical research that are 
respected and envied by the rest of the world.  
<P>
One important indicator of the excellence of these centers is their ability to compete effectively in attracting NIH funds for 
medical research. During the past 5 years alone, these institutions succeeded in attracting over $6 billion or 14.4% of NIH 
grant money. This makes California, as clearly shown in Map 1 and Table 1, the top winner of federal dollars dedicated to 
medical research.

<P>
Most of this money (about 70.9%) supports research conducted at the campuses of the University of California, 
Stanford University, Scripps Research Institute, the University of Southern California (USC), the Salk Institute and 
Caltech. These 6 institutions attract on average 46.19%, 9.34%, 6.06%, 5.60%, 2.04% and 1.68% of the NIH grant funds 
to California respectively, and generate most life-science innovations particularly in the area of biotechnology. 
<P> 
Biotechnology is an example of Californiaís lock on knowledge value. The state is the birthplace of this industry and home 
to over 30% of the US biotech firms. These firms employ nearly 50% of all biotech personnel in the country. The growth of 
this industry was fueled by breakthrough research conducted at the University of California and Stanford. It was also made 
possible by success in building alliances with industry, as illustrated by the Connect Program in San Diego, for effective 
transfer of this research. 
<P>
<B>The Problems and Promise of University-Industry Alliances:</B><BR> 
Building such alliances is not an easy task. Creating effective bridges between the university and industry is difficult 
because it involves players having different missions, organizational structures, and reward systems. But the experiences 
of San Diego and the San Francisco Bay Area demonstrate that when these linkages are established, either 
spontaneously or as a result of planning, the rewards to the regional economy are immense. Biotechnology has dug deep 
roots in the two regions and promises to boost high technology employment. For example, it is estimated that San Diegoís 
biotech industry, which employs now about 14,000 people, has the potential of providing high-paying jobs to as many as 
50,000 people within the next 10 years. 
<P> 
<B>The View From Los Angeles: </B><BR>
These lessons have not escaped the attention of university administrators and economic development organizations in 
Los Angeles. The region has historically lagged in linking its centers of intellectual accumulation with its knowledge value 
economy.  But numerous initiatives are now on the way to rectify this situation, particularly in the case of biomedical 
technology development. 
<P> 
As Map 2 demonstrates, Los Angeles attracts about 27% of California's share of NIH grant funding of medical research. 
Most of this money goes, as Map 3 shows, to research institutions such as UCLA (located within zip code 90024), USC 
(located in zip code 90007), and Caltech (located within Zip code 91106).
<P>

<P>
<CENTER>Graph 3</CENTER>
<CENTER><img src="lanih.jpg" width=500 height=323 Alt=Map of LA></CENTER>
<P> 
All three institutions have embarked on programs to translate their vast reservoirs of biomedical knowledge into firms and 
jobs benefiting the regional economy. On April 2, UCLA, under the leadership of C. Kumar Patel, Ph.D., Vice Chancellor - 
Research, launched officially its Industry Competitiveness Networks (ICN) Roundtable. This is an effort seeking to further 
the application of emerging technologies, particularly those based on advances in life sciences, and to contribute to the 
growth of  the Los Angeles knowledge value economy.  Also, two years ago, the School of Pharmacy spearheaded efforts 
at USC to ease biomedical technology transfer to the private sector through its LINK Program. Caltech has also been 
moving in the same direction.  
<P> 
Even smaller research institutions, such as the Huntington Medical Research Institutes (HMRI) of Pasadena, have 
embarked on ambitious initiatives to link with local firms. For example, HMRI is among the strong supporters of  the City of 
Pasadena's initiative to create a biotech/biomed park to accommodate spin-offs from nearby research institutions. This 
park is the centerpiece of Pasadena's efforts to grow a biomed/biotech industry at the feet of  the San Gabriel Mountains. 
<P> 
<B>Building Lasting Competitive Advantages:</B><BR> 
All these are positive steps in the direction of mining the region's gold accumulated in its universities and research centers. 
Linking the university with industries of the future, including biomedical, holds out an enormous economic promise for Los 
Angeles and California. It capitalizes on factors that are unique to the region and the state to establish a competitive 
advantage that cannot be easily replicated elsewhere.

<FONT SIZE=6 FACE="SCRIPT"><B>T</B></FONT><FONT FACE="ARIAL">he California State University (CSU) System  is the largest state-supported university system in the US. The system has 22 campuses, 25,000 faculty and 350,000 students. Interestingly, the number of CSU students in the Greater Los Angeles area exceeds that of the entire University of California statewide. 
<P> 
The CSU is similar to the Big 10 or typical midwestern universities in that it accepts the top 1/3 of the 
graduating high school seniors. Last year the CSU awarded over 50% of the bachelor's and master's 
degrees granted in California. CSU now provides the majority of the technical labor in the state and is an 
important contributor to its biotechnology, biomedical and medical device workforce. 
 <P>
In 1987 the CSU Program for Education and Research in Biotechnology (CSUPERB) was created to 
provide a coordinated and amplified development of bioscience research, training and education within the 
CSU. It seeks to (a) foster competitiveness both on the state and national levels, (b) facilitate training of a 
sufficient number of bioscience technicians and scientists, (c) catalyze technology transfer, (d) facilitate 
acquisition and long-term maintenance of state-of-the-art biotechnology resource facilities, and (e)promote 
the development of bioprocess engineering and bioscience production, research and training programs.  
 <P>
CSUPERB is a program designed to facilitate inter-disciplinary and  multi-campus coordination in 
biotechnology research and education. It encourages synergistic interaction among faculty from all CSU 
campuses who engage in education and research focusing on such areas as bioengineering, agricultural 
biotechnology, environmental and natural resources, molecular ecology, and marine biotechnology. 
 <P>
In addition, CSUPERB serves as the official liaison between the CSU, industry, government, and the public 
in biotechnology matters. Accordingly, it is an active  member of the US Council of Biotechnology 
Centers, the Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO), the Southern California Biomedical Council 
(SCBC) and the California Health Care Institute (CHI).  
<P> 
CSUPERB has been effective in obtaining  state and federal resources for various inter-campus projects 
contributing to the development of California's biotechnology infrastructure. It emphasizes the creation of 
multi-investigator, multi-campus, large scale instrumental core resource facilities. The first 3 of 10 proposed 
biotechnology core resource facilities projected over the next 10 years have been established. 
<P> 
CSUPERB also conducts a number of other activities. These include (a) creating a competitive research 
and education grants program, (b) upgrading of biotechnology instructional and research equipment, (c) 
developing new training facilities, (d) upgrading the biotech-related skills of high-school educators, and (e) 
sponsoring biotechnology short-courses and workshops for university and college faculty, including those 
working in different community colleges throughout the state. CSUPERB estimates that these activities 
impact over 18% of the students in US higher education.  
 <P>
CSUPERB hosts an annual 3-day biotechnology symposium which brings together 300 faculty and 
graduate researchers from the 22 CSU campuses. The next symposium will be held at the Kellogg 
Conference Center located on the campus of Cal Poly, Pomona during January, 1997.

SHOULD KNOW ABOUT PATENTS 
 
</FONT></B></FONT></CENTER>
<FONT FACE="ARIAL"><BR><CENTER>By</CENTER></FONT>
<FONT FACE="ARIAL"><CENTER><BR><I><B>Richard C. Hsu</B></I></CENTER></FONT>
<BR><BR>
<FONT SIZE=6 FACE="SCRIPT"><B>S</B></FONT><FONT FACE="ARIAL">uppose that you have just invented a recombinant DNA technique or discovered a bio-compatible material 
useful in medical applications. You have formed a small firm and you are convinced there is a ready market 
for your invention. The question that enters your mind is whether you should seek legal protection of your 
invention. You wonder whether it would be worth spending precious start-up resources to have your 
invention patented. For today's high-tech firms, many of which would have never even considered such a 
proposition 30 years ago, the answer is a definitive yes. 
<P> 
<B>Offensive and Defensive Uses of Patents: </B><BR>
Traditionally, patents have been used offensively to protect against potential infringers. Perhaps less 
utilized, but no less potent, is the defensive use of patents. For example, suppose you start selling your 
product and you are sued for patent infringement. Even if you contest the merits of your opponent's case, 
you cannot afford not to belittle the claim because the stakes  are high and the cost of proving or disproving 
infringement can run into the hundreds of thousands of dollars. 
 <P>
One way of using patents defensively is to disprove an accuser's claim that it was the first to conceive of the 
invention. You can also counterclaim against your infringer. Frequently, companies in such situations will 
cross-license patents or settle the case. Now that you realize the value of obtaining a patent, how do you go 
about obtaining one? How much will it cost? How long will it take? 
 <P>
<B>What Can be Patented? </B><BR>
A patent can be issued to cover any "new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of 
matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof." 35 USC 101.  
 <P>
There are three requirements for patentability.  First, the invention has to have utility. This can be satisfied 
by suggesting that the invention t has some  practical use. Second, it should be novel. This means that the 
patent applicant must be the first to invent the subject matter of the patent. Third, the invention must be 
non-obvious. This means that the invention should not be obvious even to those skilled in the relevant 
technology. 
 <P>
This does not mean that only radical inventions are patentable. One can obtain a patent on even a modest 
improvement in the existing technology as long as the improvement satisfies the non-obviousness 
requirement. 
 <P>
<B>Filing a Patent Application:</B><BR> 
The process of obtaining a patent in the US is known as patent prosecution and is initiated with the filing of 
a patent application with the US Patent Office. A patent application consists of a "specification" which is a 
section describing the invention and how it is made and used, and a "claims" section which sets forth the 
specific protection being sought. 
<p>
<B>The Costs of Filing a Patent Application: </B><BR>
The basic filing fee for a US patent application is currently $750. For small firms (those having fewer than 
500 employees), this fee is reduced to $375. Attorney's fees vary widely with the complexity of the matter 
and may be in the range of $5,000 to $10,000. Once a patent is issued, maintenance fees ranging from 
$999 to $2,990 must be paid periodically to keep the patent enforceable. 
 <P>
<B>The Time Required to Obtain a Patent: </B><BR>
The average length of time from the filing of an application to the issuance of a patent is between two to 
three years. After the applicant submits a response to the first examiner's Action, the examiner reconsiders 
his application. Eventually, when the applicant and the examiner are in agreement, the patent will be issued. 
 <P>
<B>The Rights of a Patent Owner: </B><BR>
Once a patent is issued, the patent protection lasts 20 years from the date of filing the application. The 
patent gives the owner the exclusive right to make, use or sell the invention. To obtain foreign patent 
protection, an application must be filed in each country where protection is sought. 
 <P>
<B>Conclusion: </B><BR>
Patent protection has started to attract substantial attention from many small start-ups. The best initiative 
for these companies is to incorporate patents into their business plan. This involves developing an 
intelligent patent strategy, which does not demand patenting every research and development effort. It 
entails devising a patent portfolio to be used both offensively and defensively.

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">* <B>Amgen</B> (Thousand Oaks, Ventura County), the leading independent biotechnology firm in the world, has good news for cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. The Los Angeles Daily News (May 28, 1996) 
reported that the firmís drug candidate, <a href="http://cer.hs.washington.edu/John/platelet.htm">Megakaryocyte</a> Growth and Development Factor (MGDF), has shown promising results in Phase I human clinical trials. MGDF is Amgenís genetically-engineered drug designed to boost platelet production in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, thereby reducing chances of life-threatening hemorrhages. 
 <p>
Also, on May 20, 1996, Amgen announced that it has begun Phase I clinical trials of <a href="http://www.rndsystems.com/cb/cbsu96/cbsu96a2.html">leptin</a>, a genetically 
engineered protein responsible for regulating fat deposition in the body. The company is investigating the 
potential of leptin in inducing weight loss in obese people.  
 <p>
Amgen has an exclusive license from The Rockefeller University to develop and market products, such as 
leptin, based on the discovery of the obesity gene by researchers from the Rockefeller University's 
Laboratory of Molecular Genetics and Howard Hughes Medical Institute.  
 <p>
In a press release, Amgen announced that "The initial trial is designed primarily to evaluate safety and 
tolerability of leptin across a variety of weight categories of people who have no other medical 
complications. The study is being conducted at multiple centers in North America. This initial safety 
evaluation is likely to take until at least early 1997 to complete." For more information, call Amgen at 800-
77-AMGEN.<BR>

* <B>HIV Therapeutics, Inc.</B> (San Juan Capistrano, Orange County) is a biotech start-up formed to develop a 
new family of anti-viral, self-assembling drugs to target <a href="http://www.medaccess.com/physical/aids/hhca/hhca_02.htm">HIV</a>. The company's novel technology seeks to 
place lipid degrading enzymes on the surface of the virus using <a href="http://www.cs.jmu.edu/courses/isat280/cd4.htm">CD4</a> receptors and antibodies specific to 
<a href="http://www.umd.umich.edu/~jcthomas/JCTHOMAS/Student%20Papers/C.Williams.html">gp41</a> as targeting molecules. 
<p>
Richard Burstein, founder and President of HIV Therapeutics, stated that "the binding specificity of the 
drugs makes it capable of selectively locating and destroying the virus without harming healthy cells." He 
added that  "the therapeutic success of the drugs is not affected by viral mutations due to the use of a 
combination of an antibody and a CD4 receptor."

* <B>PDT, Inc.</B> (Goleta, Santa Barbara County) announced on May 29, 1996, that it has entered into an 
agreement with Iridex, a provider of semiconductor-based laser systems used in ophthalmology, to 
co-develop photodynamic therapy devices for treating eye diseases. 
<p>  
The two firms are co-developing a portable, solid state diode light source which is now in Phase I/II 
ophthalmology clinical trial in the US. In this trial, patients receive an injection of PDTís leading candidate 
drug, SnET2, which remains inactive until exposed to low power red light. The light is produced by the diode 
light source co-developed by PDT and IRIDEX. The light activates the drug, causing a photochemical 
reaction that selectively destroys abnormal blood vessels associated with advanced macular degeneration 
(AMD).  
 <p>
According to BioVenture View (June 1st, 1996), SnET2 is also in Phase III studies for AIDS-related 
Kaposi's sarcoma and metastatic skin lesions from breast cancer, in collaboration with corporate partner 
Pharmacia & Upjohn. Phase III studies in basal cell carcinoma are planned.

<H2>PURCHASING DIVISION</H2> </center>
<P>
Welcome to the Purchasing Division of the City of San Buenaventura. We appreciate your interest in doing business with the City and hope this guide will benefit you as a new or present supplier.

Our aim is to help you in your sales effort and to promote a 
climate of good business relationships with the City of San
Buenaventura. 

This guide will outline our purchasing policies and procedures.
Whenever you need more information, please ask us.

<P>
<B>PURPOSE</B>
<P>
The Purchasing Divisions purpose is to maintain continuity of
services and supplies to support the various City agencies and
departments. 
<P>
The purpose of this guide is to explain how a vendor may
participate in the City's business. The City is always interested
in securing responsible vendors who can supply its needs promptly,
economically, and in the desired quality and quantities.
<P>

<B>ORGANIZATION</B>
<P>
Procurement services for all City departments are centralized in
the Purchasing Division under the direction of the Purchasing and
Services Manager.
<P>
The Purchasing Division is organized by major commodity groups
which are assigned to individual Buyers who specialize in the
commodities they purchase. A listing of Buyers assigned to each
commodity group is available upon request.
<P>

<B>SALES CALLS AND CONTACTS</B>
<P>
Office hours are from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Monday through Friday.
To  conserve time and ensure you adequate attention, we urge you to
make a definite appointment before coming to the Purchasing
Division.
<P>
Routine courtesy visits are not encouraged as they can disrupt the
daily work flow.
<P>
<B>VENDOR REGISTRATION</B>
<P>
Lists of interested and responsible vendors are maintained by the
Buyers. You may contact the front desk or the appropriate Buyer for
a Vendor's Registration application form to add your company name
to our list.
<P>

Because of the number of suppliers the Purchasing Division deals
with, submitting a Vendor's Registration form does not guarantee a
vendor will be notified every time a quotation or bid for that
particular commodity or service is sent out. 
<P>
Buyers may also contact firms that are not on the list of
suppliers. Failure to respond to three (3) consecutive bid or quote
invitations may result in the removal of your firm's name from the
supplier list. 
<P>

<B>SPECIFICATIONS</B>
<P>
Written specifications are used in the bidding process to describe
the required level of quality, quantity, delivery, and scope of
work. In addition to the specifications, certain terms and
conditions governing purchases are also outlined in the bid form. 
<P>
Sometimes a vendor may expend considerable time and money
presenting a product to an individual City department in the hopes
of making a sale. If you do this, remember that the purchase may
eventually be made by competitive bid and what you spend for
expensive designs, demonstrations and layouts does not guarantee
you an order.
<P> 
Specifications prepared by City departments are carefully reviewed
by each Buyer to eliminate undue restrictions and other limitations
which unnecessarily reduce competition. The purchase will
eventually be made from the lowest responsible bidder meeting these
objective specifications. 
<P>
The help you offer a department in developing their purchase
request cannot be considered when we make the purchase. We
recommend, if you are called upon to provide expensive pre-purchase
services, that you consider contracting separately with the
department for this service. You might also ask the department you
assisted to list you as a suggested vendor on their requisition so
we can send you a bid invitation.
<P>

<B>BASIS FOR AWARD</B>
<P>
It is the Citys desire to develop maximum competition for all
purchases and to make awards based on the lowest responsible and
responsive bid received. 
<P>
Lowest responsible bidder means the lowest bidder whose offer best
responds in quality, fitness and capacity to the requirement of the
proposed work or usage. Such factors as delivery time, quality,
compatibility, references, experience, parts and services, freight
costs, etc., play an important part in awarding a purchase order to
the lowest responsible bidder.
<P>
A responsive bid is one which is in substantial conformance with
the requirements of the specifications, the invitation to bid, and
the City's contractual terms and conditions. This would also
include such things as completeness of the quotation forms,
inclusion of references and attachments, and completion of required
responses.

<pre>
DELIVERY AND INSPECTIONS

Shipment in almost all cases is to be made to the City of Ventura,
FOB destination. Requirements for delivery are specified on all
bids and purchase orders. Failure to meet the specified date may
cause cancellation of the order and will reflect adversely on your
firms overall performance rating.
 
Variations from the specifications make a shipment subject to
rejection. 


BID RESULTS

Bid awards are a matter of public record. Abstracts of bids showing
prices and awards are available by contacting the Purchasing office
support staff or the appropriate Buyer. 

Negotiated procurements based upon formal written proposals are
confidential and are made public upon execution of a signed
contract.


CHANGE ORDERS

The purchase order is the City's contract with the vendor.
Therefore, any change to that contract must be in writing and
authorized by the Purchasing Division. Department personnel may not
make changes to the purchase order. 


BILLING AND PAYMENT

The City requires invoices in duplicate for each purchase order
issued to the vendor. The purchase order number must appear on all
invoices, shipping tags, and all correspondence relevant to the
order.

Payment is made after receipt of invoice and delivery and
acceptance of material as specified on the purchase order. Unless
otherwise specified on the purchase order, invoices should be
submitted to:

CITY OF SAN BUENAVENTURA 
ACCOUNTS PAYABLE 
P. O. BOX 99 
VENTURA, CA 93002-0099

Sending your invoice to any other department (unless so instructed)
may delay payment. The City tries to pay all invoices within thirty
(30) days of receipt of invoice and acceptance of the order.
Questions regarding payment of invoices should be made to the
Accounts Payable Office. You will need to reference the purchase
order and invoice numbers.


INSURANCE

In all instances in which vendor personnel enter City property to
repair, install, service, construct, consult, etc., the City
requires a certificate of insurance verifying coverage per City
insurance requirements. 

Whenever insurance is required on a purchase order, the vendor will
be supplied with complete requirements for coverage. Contact the
Purchasing Division if you need further information on insurance
requirements.


TAX 

The City is exempt from federal excise tax, but pays sales and use
taxes when applicable. Certificates of Exemption from Excise Tax
may be obtained from the Purchasing Office. 


MINORITY, SMALL & LOCAL BUSINESS

The City is vitally interested in promoting minority, small and
local businesses. We see local and small businesses as an important
part of a competitive bid process which deserves our encouragement
and help.

Buyers will gladly answer any questions on specifications, bid or
award procedures, and purchasing procedures in general. Please let
your business status and locale be known when requesting your name
be added to our vendor list. Buyers will gladly attend business
fairs and commodity shows produced by minority, small and local
businesses. 


GIFTS AND GRATUITIES

The Purchasing Division maintains a strict policy prohibiting the
acceptance by its employees, of gifts and/or gratuities from any
supplier or potential supplier.


METHODS OF PROCUREMENT

The following methods of purchasing are available:

Petty Cash
City personnel are authorized to make petty cash purchases up to
$50.00.

Blanket Purchase Orders (BPOS)
A blanket purchase order allows a vendor to sell goods to the City
on an as-needed basis at specific prices or under a specific
pricing arrangement, for a specified period of time. 

Purchases $1,000 or less - Direct Purchase Orders (DPOS)
City operating departments may purchase goods and services using a
Direct Purchase Order (DPO) when the dollar amount does not exceed
$1,000. A DPO number must be given to the vendor at the time the
order is placed. The DPO number and name of requesting department
must appear on vendors invoice to the City.

Purchases $1,000 - Less than $10,000
Purchases over $1,000 and less than $10,000 require competitive
quotations whenever possible and are generally made through the
informal bid process. Quotations may be submitted to the Purchasing
Division via telephone, in person, by mail, or by facsimile
transmission.

Purchases $10,000 and Over
For purchases $10,000 and over, formal bids are normally solicited,
depending on the complexity of the materials or services being
procured. Formal bids must be sealed and can be submitted in person
or by mail. Formal bids can NOT be submitted via telephone or
facsimile. 


ACTING WITHOUT A PURCHASE ORDER NUMBER 

All purchases charged to the City require a purchase order. If an
individual calls you and attempts to place an order without a City
purchase order number, you are cautioned to request an authorized
purchase order number and obtain the name and department of the
individual. The purchase order number is vital to doing business
with the City. It is your insurance that you will be paid. 
      
EXCEPTION:  There may be times during an emergency when an order
must be placed after hours or on weekends (times when the
Purchasing Office is normally closed). Be assured that true
emergency purchases at such times without purchase order numbers
will be approved. Be sure to obtain the individual's name and
department and request identification if the order is placed in
person. Department personnel are instructed to obtain a purchase 
order number from the Purchasing Office the following work day. The
employee who placed the order will contact you with an authorized
purchase order number.


EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT PLAN 

The Purchasing Division maintains an Emergency Resource List of
vendors who may be contacted in the event of a local disaster. If
you believe your firm may provide such a resource, please contact
the Purchasing office to register as an emergency resource vendor.


ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES 

The Purchasing Division supports the City Councils Resolution No.
92-16 by procuring and using environmentally sound products. We
encourage vendors to help keep us informed of available recycled
and environmentally sound products.

In accordance with City Administrative Regulations No. 03-002.9
vendors shall not provide any items to the City in performance of
a contract which are tropical hardwoods or tropical hardwood
products. Vendors are urged not to import, purchase, obtain, or use
for any purpose, any tropical hardwood or tropical hardwood
product.


AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT
 
In compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act, if you or
someone in your firm needs special assistance to participate in a
walk-through or attend a pre-bid meeting, you should contact the
Purchasing Office at (805) 658-4719 (voice) or the California Relay
Service. Notification 48 hours prior to the meeting would enable
the City to make reasonable arrangements to ensure accessibility to
the meeting.

No vendor providing a service, program or activity to the public on
behalf of the City shall discriminate against any person because of
sex, race, color, creed, national origin or disability. Vendors, if
providing a service, program or activity to the public on behalf of
the City, shall comply with the Americans with Disability Act and
Citys policies pursuant thereto when providing said service,
program or activity.



We hope this guide has helped you better understand our division
and its purpose.  When we conduct business with you, it is our
desire to have you feel that each transaction has been
satisfactorily concluded in a respectful, fair and professional
manner.

of the single family units are owner occupied.  Multi-family housing 
comprises 29.5% of the housing units in the City.  Nearly all of these 
are renter occupied.  Two thirds of the City's housing was built in the 
last 30 years with the remaining one third built before 1960.  Many 
of these older homes were built in the Victorian, California Craftsman 
and Mission Revival architectural styles.

California Integrated Waste Management Board for the Household
Hazardous Waste Collection  program.

<P>
Public Works Director Ron Calkins stated the City was relying

the work.

responsibility to fund disposal costs in the future.
<P>
Norma Camacho, representing the County of Ventura, informed the
City Council they considered a proposal submitted by MSE Environmental,

the disposal methods.  She indicated they were in the process
of releasing a Request for Proposals (RFPs), and the company selected
would do all the household hazardous waste collection events.
 She advised the City Council the County of Ventura was listed
as the material generator so the City's liability was somewhat
limited.

<P>
<U><B>11. Pier Repair Options and Public Input Process</B></U>
<P>
<U>RECOMMENDATION</U>:
<P>
  
<P>
 (a) Establish the Community Affairs Commission as the     appropriate
venue for gathering public input on Pier repair    alternatives
using input to the Arts and Cultural Affairs     Committee, the
Historic Preservation Committee, the Tourism    and Special Events
Committee, and the Save the Pier     Campaign Committee; and
<P>
 (b) Direct staff to focus attention on the following three  
  alternatives as the focus for further input and engineering
   repair analysis:
<P>
  (1)  Leave the Pier at its current length with some additional
   strengthening.
<P>
  (2) Restore the Pier to original length, or a length between
    the original and the current length, using steel (or     concrete)
for added strength.  The Pier Deck and     railings would be wood.
<P>
  (3) Restore the Pier to its full length using all wood, building
    it as strong as possible using the best materials and    
techniques available.
<P>
Public Works Director Ron Calkins reviewed his Administrative
Report dated February 21, 1996.  The Public Works Director displayed
pictures of piers showing wood pilings with steel braces, wood
and steel pilings; and concrete material.  He informed the City
Council that the insurance proceeds could be used to reinforce
the existing pier.
<P>
Councilmember Tuttle stated he would prefer not to receive a recommendation.
<P>
Councilmember Bennett said there would be people who want the
City to invest additional monies beyond the insurance proceeds;
and if so, he would like information on how the Council should
re-prioritize its budget. 
<P>
  
<P>
San Buenaventura City Council     February 26, 1996          
            Page 10
<P>
Councilmember Bennett stated he would like to strengthen the existing
pier, not spend City monies, and use any remaining insurance proceeds
to add to the pier.  He mentioned it would be preferable to receive
a recommendation as part of the public input process.  He noted
that it was also important to receive timely input from staff
during the public input process.
<P>
Councilmember Friedman stated he was concerned about proceeding
with this matter without knowing the reasons for the pier failure.
<P>
The Public Works Director stated the consultant's findings as
to the pier failure would be incorporated in the report to be
prepared as a result of the action taken on this item.  He assured
the City Council that if the consultant's findings reflected other
options should be pursued, staff would present those in the  report.
<P>
Councilmember Di Guilio reminded the City Council that when the
pier  sustained major damage previously, the City underwent a
public input process.  He indicated the City Council should make
the decision on the proper option to repair the pier rather than
soliciting a recommendation.  He asked about the clean up cost.
 Councilmember Di Guilio mentioned he too was concerned about
not having the consultant's report on the reason(s) for the pier
failure before taking the recommended action.  He indicated he
was not interested in spending any money beyond the insurance
proceeds.  Councilmember Di Guilio said he would be interested
in raising the pier.
<P>
The Public Works Director informed the City Council the clean
up expense was approximately $50,000 which would be applicable
to the City's deductible.
<P>
 
<P>
City Engineer Rick Raives advised the City Council it was hoped
the consultant's report would be done in about 30 days.
<P>
Deputy Mayor Measures asked what length the pier had to be to
retain its historical designation.  She expressed her concern
about the impact on future insurance premium costs.
<P>
San Buenaventura City Council     February 26, 1996          
            Page 11
<P>
 The City Engineer told the City Council that staff had been unable
to 
<P>
determine if the pier was a registered landmark.  He pointed out
the pier 
<P>
was a local landmark.
<P>
The Director of Community Services said staff would look into
the impact
<P>
on future insurance premiums.
<P>
Jo Rogers, representing the Historical Preservation Committee,
indicated
<P>
they were pleased to be able to participate in the public input
process.
<P>
Councilmember Di Guilio suggested the City Council comments be

<P>
presented to the citizen advisory groups involved in the public
input
<P>
process, and that the citizen advisory groups act as a clearinghouse
<P>
without making recommendations to the City Council.
<P>
Deputy Mayor Measure said she agreed with the comments made by

<P>
Councilmember Di Guilio.
<P>
Councilmember Friedman offered a motion to approve the recommendation
with the provisions that the citizen advisory groups act as a
clearinghouse and that staff bring issues to the City Council
at the appropriate time during the public input process, which
motion was seconded by Councilmember Measures.  Upon call of the
roll, the vote was as follows:
<P>
 AYES:  Councilmembers Friedman, Tuttle, Di Guilio,
<P>
   Bennett, Monahan, Measures, and Tingstrom.
<P>
 NOES:  None.
<P>
 ABSENT: None.
<P>

Improvement Program.
<P>
Director of Management Resources Terry Adelman reviewed his Administrative
Report dated February 22, 1996, and made reference to the updated
CIP information.
<P>
Councilmember Friedman inquired about the reason(s) for allocating
$1.8 million from the Maintenance and Operations Budget to the
CIP Budget,  whether a City-wide Communications System was actually
a CIP project or Maintenance and Operation Budget expense, how
many CIP projects the City would be able to complete in a fiscal
year, why there was such a backlog of CIP projects, and reserve
level policy information.
<P>
Councilmember Tuttle asked about a list of the art in public places
projects, sources of funding for the art in public places projects,
and definition of public art.
<P>
Councilmember Monahan requested information on the reason Gas
Tax monies were allocated for art in public places, whether funds
were being set aside for the development of the City's 87+ acre
park, and whether the City Council wanted to proceed with the
concept of a park.
<P>
Councilmember Bennett inquired about whether there were any restrictions
on the use of General Fund cumulative to date funding, how much
money was actually available from the Kimball Road Overcrossing,
how the City Council would determine the Maintenance and Operations
Budget contribution to the CIP Budget, a list of the projects
which could be developed if the City was not allocating all its
traffic mitigation improvement monies to the Johnson Drive/U.
S. 101 Interchange project, total monies allocated to the Johnson
Drive/U. S. 101 Interchange project, amount of annual street maintenance
funding, why the Parks and Recreation Improvement Fund anticipated
fund balance did not match the project expenditures, why the Waterline
Replacements project costs dropped significantly, whether all
projects in the Water Fund were part of the Water Master Plan,
whether it was necessary to allocate monies for 
<P>
San Buenaventura City Council     February 26, 1996          
            Page 13
<P>
the California Street Parking Structure - Structural Maintenance
project since there are discussions about spending money for the
parking structure next to the Holiday Inn and building another
parking structure in the downtown area, formula for building the
contingency funds, and the status of the Surfers Point Bike Path
Project.
<P>
 
<P>
Councilmember Di Guilio stated he prepared a list of written questions
which he would provide to staff for responses.  He asked that
the cumulative year to date amounts reflect the balance to avoid
confusion.  He requested information about reliability of fund
balances for June 1996, as well as the impact on the total funds
for each project, CIP projects with ongoing costs impacting the
Maintenance and Operations Budget,  those funds over which the
City Council has discretion relative to their use,  manner in
which projects get added to the CIP list,  consideration of redefinition
of CIP, whether one-year projects should be on CIP list, report
 providing a priority  list of water and drainage projects, explanation
of why some water and drainage projects were funded from the Maintenance
and Operations budget, and information on how CIP projects were
evaluated relative to the City's goals.
<P>
 
<P>
Councilmember Friedman requested information on prioritizing CIP
projects and whether projects budgeted to the year 2002 were indexed
for inflation.
<P>
Councilmember Tuttle wanted to know how much had been spent on
the Downtown Redevelopment project, the debt service, and any
specific projects being proposed.  Also, he inquired whether the
RDA Capital Mission Plaza - Fund 94 and  RDA Capital Downtown
- Fund 95 monies were encumbered.
<P>
Deputy Mayor Measures wondered what portion of the art in public
places was generated by grants.
<P>

the Peirano Building from the Figueroa Plaza project:
<P>

bank account in the City to raise monies for the proposal.  He
said the Oxnard concept had been modified, and they planned to
work with the Oxnard facility.

issues which needed City consideration.
<P>
Councilmember Tuttle advised the City Council no decisions should

and refuse haulers participated at a recent meeting of the West
County Waste Management Joint Powers Authority (JPA) which was
very informative and beneficial.  He mentioned the trash might
end up being delivered to three different landfills to ensure
their viability.
<P>
The Assistant to the City Manager informed the City Council there
were not enough tons of refuse for the Simi Valley Landfill as

<P>
<U><B>9. Initiation of Comprehensive Plan Amendment Regarding
Population Limits and Authorization for the 1996 Residential Growth
Management Program Allocation Process to Proceed  (62)</B></U>
<P>
Everett Millais, Director of Community Services, presented an
Administrative Report dated February 20, 1996, a pending projects
list and a new Exhibit &quot;A&quot; to 
<P>
the proposed resolution initiating a Comprehensive Plan amendment.
 In response to Councilmember Friedman, Mr. Millais explained
that the Comprehensive Plan is not cast in stone, that it should
be reviewed periodically to deal with changes in circumstances.
 The Plan, he said, provides the process for amendments.  Mr.
Millais explained how the population figures in the current plan
were derived; that they are not scientific, but rather the result
of public testimony and Council deliberation and action.
<P>
Councilmember Bennett said a key issue is school development in
the east end.  If  the Plan is going to be amended, how much more
will the EIR be complicated to add the school element.
<P>
Mr. Millais said that school overcrowding is a major issue.  There
is some case law, he said, dealing with withholding allocations
because of school overcrowding and he would like to bring a report
back to Council on that issue.  With regard to population figures,
Mr. Millais said that staff is suggesting that as population figures
are received from that State Department of Finance, that they
be used to make any adjustments annually.
<P>
In response to Councilmember Monahan, Mr. Millais advised the
Council he has received requests for the City to levy a fee for
school construction to the maximum allowed by law.  Court cases
say the City is preempted from collecting the fees.  Again, he
said he would bring a report to the Council regarding fees for
schools and withholding of allocations.
<P>
Councilmember Di Guilio expressed his opinion that  the Comprehensive
Plan is more than population, that it should encompass all elements
of need.
<P>
Dr. Joseph Spirto, Superintendent of the Ventura Unified School
District,  described some of the difficulties experienced by the
District with regard to accommodating space for all students.
 The Board of Education, he said, recently approved a recommendation
to form a committee to look at  mitigation factors to overcrowded
schools.  The District would like to continue to work with the
City to find a solution to the school problem.
<P>
The following persons spoke about the proposed amendment to change
the population cap:
<P>
 Bill Locey, 1560 Santa Ynez - opposed
<P>
 Todd Collart, 5627 Amherst Street - support
<P>
 Cecil Black, 112 Harding Avenue - opposed
<P>
 Steve Perlman, 7811 Marin Lane - support
<P>
 Chuck Cohen, 730 Woodlawn Drive, Thousand Oaks, representing
 Weston Co. - support
<P>
Mr. Black asked about the imposition of fees by the City for schools
and asked how much it would cost for an EIR.
<P>
Mr. Millais said the City could impose a fee beyond what the State
allows the School District to charge.  The cost of a Master EIR
would be between $250,000 and $300,000.
<P>
Mayor Tingstrom asked if there were others wishing to be heard.
 There being none, public testimony was closed.
<P>
Mayor Tingstrom offered a motion to postpone the Residential Growth
Management Program process until January, 1997, which motion was
seconded by Councilmember Friedman.  Upon call of the roll, the
vote was as follows:
<P>
 AYES:  Councilmembers Friedman, Tuttle, Bennett and
<P>
   Tingstrom.
<P>

and incorporating the revised Exhibit &quot;A&quot;  which stipulates

<P>
Councilmember Monahan left the Chamber.
<P>

Comprehensive Plan to allow using school capacity as a criteria
for granting allocations, which motion was seconded by Councilmember
Friedman.
<P>
City Attorney Bulens and Director of Community Services Everett
Millais advised the Council they would come back with a report
in the next 30 days regarding the inclusion of school capacity
as a criteria for environmental review.
<P>
Upon call of the roll, the vote was as follows:

<P>
<U><B>10. Concepts for Revising the Water Demand Reduction Offset
Program.  (123)</B></U>
<P>
Steve Perlman, 7811 Marin Lane, asked about projects which would
decrease the demand for water.
<P>
Public Works Director Ron Calkins explained that any new project
must offset the demand for water.
<P>
Clark Owens, 486 Alpine Avenue, representing the Chamber of Commerce,
requested that the DROP program be discontinued because of the
time it consumes.   With a continuation of the program he suggested
retrofitting landscaping irrigation systems at schools; providing
greater flexibility in the program; and suggested retrofitting
hotels, with a possibility the hotels might be willing to share
the costs.  Mr. Owens supported the staff recommendation.
<P>
Chuck Cohen, representing Weston Co., said he is willing to work
with the City to develop a drought program.  He supported the
recommendation.
<P>
Councilmember Tuttle offered a motion to adopt the following concepts
for revising the Water Demand Reduction Offset Program:
<P>
 a. Develop a City-administered program to retrofit toilets to
    be reimbursed by developers paying their pro-rata share of
    the program's cost;
<P>
 b. Allow credit for retrofitting urinals;
<P>
 c. Investigate increasing the credit given for retrofitting school
    toilets; and
<P>
 d. Allow offset programs to include landscape plant material
    and irrigation retrofits,
<P>
which motion was seconded by Councilmember Bennett.  Upon call
of the roll, the vote was as follows:
<P>
 AYES:  Councilmembers Friedman, Tuttle, Di Guilio,
<P>

<P>
<U><B>11. Policy Guidance for Utility Rates and Agreement for
Professional Services for Rate Review  (31)</B></U>
<P>
Councilmember Di Guilio offered a motion  to:  
<P>
 a. Consider various possible policy changes relating to utility
    rates and direct staff to develop details for later Council
    action for:  (1) the implementation of a sanitation base fee,
    and (2) lowering the minimum tier for sanitation charges from
   8 to 4 hundred cubic feet (HCF) per billing period; and
<P>
 b. Authorize the City Manager to execute Agreement  No. 96-23
   with Black &amp; Veatch, rate specialists, to perform an analysis
    of sanitation rates and create a computerized sanitation rate
    model for an amount not to exceed $28,000,
<P>
which motion was seconded by Councilmember Measures.  Upon call
of the roll, the vote was as follows:
<P>
 AYES:  Councilmembers Friedman, Tuttle, Di Guilio, 
<P>
   Bennett, Monahan and Tingstrom
<P>

 (b) Install center raised median to restrict left turns at Harbor
Boulevard   and Beachmont Street; and
<P>
 (c) Direct that an ordinance be prepared which allows for the

<P>
Director of Community Services Everett Millais reviewed his Administrative
Report dated March 26, 1996.  The Director of Community Services
showed and described slides of a diagram for left turn restrictions
at Beachmont Street/Harbor Boulevard, diagram for left turn restrictions
at boat ramp driveway on Anchors Way, diagram showing proposed
locations for signs restricting certain classes of vehicles on
Beachmont Street, project average daily traffic volumes with left
turn restrictions, and diagram for future signalization of the
Oyster Street/Harbor Boulevard intersection.
<P>
Marion Woods, 1215 Anchors Way, representing the Ventura Marina
Mobile Home Park, indicated they would prefer to leave the traffic
circulation as is; however, they would accept the staff recommendation.
<P>
Stanley Friedman, 3008 Seaview Avenue, said he agreed with the
administrative report except for left turns from Oyster Street.
 Mr. Friedman suggested allowing left turns from Beachmont Street.
<P>
Anne Worm Wood, 1215 Anchors Way, representing Ventura Marina
Mobile Home Park, indicated they supported the staff recommendation.
<P>
Clif Simonson, 1264 Seafarer Street, stated he had a problem restricting
left turns at Beachmont Street and moving traffic to Oyster Street.
<P>
Cathy Ajeman, 3001 Seahorse Avenue, urged the City Council not
to prohibit left turns at Beachmont Street.
<P>
Joseph O'Brien, 2969 Seaview Avenue, told the City Council he
did not support increasing traffic on his street and restricting
left turns at Beachmont Street.
<P>
Richard Parsons, 1603 Anchors Way, representing the Ventura Port
District, informed the City Council that they had not taken a
position on the administrative report, but he believed the residents
in the area would live with the staff recommendations.  Mr. Parsons
suggested the City make sure the residents were satisfied with
the City's actions.
<P>
Ray Greiner, 1378 Beachmont Street, said he did not support limiting
left turns at Beachmont Street.
<P>
David Harris, 1361 Beachmont Street, requested the City Council
consider additional left turn restrictions.

in the area.
<P>
Andrew Soter, 1309 Beachmont Street, also said the staff recommendation
would increase traffic in the area.  Mr. Soter pointed out the
right turns on Beachmont Street were a major problem.  He suggested
Beachmont Street be partially closed at the Arundell Barranca,
which would be less expensive than the staff recommendation.
<P>
Bob Fowler, 383 Carol Drive, representing property owners of Parcel
20, indicated the staff recommendation would impact them the most,
but they would agree with the staff recommendation provided large
trucks coming into the area would be able to make left turns safely

expressed concern about the number of public hearings facing the
Longboards Restaurant just to obtain approval of a curb cut.
<P>
Bernie Tautz, 1314 Beachmont Street, stated he did not support
restricting left turns at Beachmont Street.  Mr. Tautz indicated
there were no solutions to the in-bound traffic.  Mr. Tautz mentioned
he did not believe the new rules would be enforced because the
current regulations were not being enforced by the City.  He said
he could live with the staff recommendation.
<P>
Desiree Foraste, 1361 Beachmont Street, mentioned she was not
opposed to the Longboards Restaurant, but she wanted the traffic
re-routed off  Beachmont Street.
<P>
Jill Lee, 1381 Beachmont Street, mentioned she would like the
matter closed, but she wants to make sure the traffic problems
on Beachmont Street were resolved.
<P>
Kee Lee, 1381 Beachmont Street, suggested Beachmont Street be
closed at the Arundell Barranca.  Mr. Lee also suggested left
turns be restricted at Harbortown Point if the staff recommendation
was approved.
<P>
Transportation and Traffic Engineer Nazir Lalani provided additional
traffic circulation information.  The Transportation and Traffic
Engineer advised the City Council that the proposed ordinance

size regulation.  He discussed signalization and associated costs.
<P>
Councilmember Tuttle offered a motion to approve recommendations
(a) and (c) with the provision that left turns be restricted in
front of the Harbortown Point.  Councilmember Di Guilio seconded.
<P>
The Transportation and Traffic Engineer told the City Council
that Beachmont Street would be placed on the traffic signal monitoring
list; and at the appropriate time, he would present a report to
the City Council for direction on whether to restrict left turns
at Beachmont Street or install a traffic signal.
<P>
Upon call of the roll, the vote was as follows:
<P>
 AYES:  Councilmembers Tuttle, Di Guilio, Measures, and

  of the Serra Community.
<P>
b. Adopt  Alternate 1 or 2 of Section 12 of the resolution  establishing
the    time for a developer to pay the Capital Improvement Deficiency
Study   Update fees.
<P>
City Engineer Rick Raives introduced Pat Reeves, Consultant with
Penfield Smith, who prepared the capital Improvement deficiency
fees and related study.  Mr. Reeves advised the Council his firm
undertook a very comprehensive review of what the demands and
the needs are and calculated the fees based upon a  ratio of benefit
to each property.

revisions and requested that no action be taken at this time to
allow additional time for the property owners to review the proposed
fees:
<P>

the fees and refer the matter to an ad hoc committee to engage

Council can feel the comfort of knowing appropriate allocations
have been made, and as much of the City's anticipated costs are
going to be covered, which motion was  seconded by Councilmember
Monahan.
<P>
City Attorney Bulens advised the Council if they postpone acting
on the fees and a development comes through before the fees come

lower rate and  it will be the City's responsibility to pay the
difference.

the four parcels abutting Main Street, to the developer for construction
of the theater complex.  In conjunction with the construction
of the theater, a four-story parking structure will be constructed.

of an existing parking lot behind the proposed theater site.<BR>

<H3>London & Thames Valley Pharmaceutical Group</H3>
<p>
The London and Thames Valley Pharmaceutical Group (LTVPG) is a regional
group comprising 17 international research-led companies of European and American origin. The Group accounts for a major proportion
of the UK pharmaceutical industry's R&D expenditure. In 1994 it spent
almost &#163;600 million, equivalent to over 40% of the total spent by the
industry. Member companies are researching and developing new medicines
in several areas including: AIDs, Alzheimer's Disease,
Asthma, Cancer, Diabetes, Migraine and Rheumatoid Arthritis. Equally
important is the LTVPG's contribution to the local and national
economy. Its export sales from the UK amounted to &#163;1.8 billion in 1994 - equivalent to 45% of total UK pharmaceutical exports. In 1995
the UK pharmaceutical industry as a whole contributed a surplus of over
&#163;2 billion to the balance of trade.

<H3>The Latest Postings (updated December 8th)</H3>
<P>

<B>We have some useful Government, Industry, Pharmaceutical and Health Care <a href="links.htm">links</a> for you.</B>
<P>

<B>26/11/96 - NHS given £1.6bn Budget boost</B>
<P>
In the last Budget before the Election, the Chancellor Kenneth Clarke MP announced a £1.6 billion increase in NHS current expenditure for 1997/8; or 2.9% in real terms.  The capital programme has been significantly reduced by 9.6% but a bigger role is projected for PFI investment which is expected to rise from £65m in 1996/7 to £166m in 1997/8 and £307m and £422m in the following two years.  These figures are likely to be significantly reduced if Labour form the next Government.  
<P>
There have also been cuts in spending on central health, miscellaneous services and DoH administration with the savings being used to boost spending to 3% in real terms on current hospital and community health services and to 3.2% on current family health services.  DoH total spending in real terms will rise by only 0.8% next year.  
<P>
Prescription charges will increase by 15p from 1 April 1997.  Other NHS charges will also increase.  
<P>

<B>26/11/96 - "Biotechnology - a new revolution in Healthcare" published</B>
<P>
A new publication from the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) underlines the importance of effective patents for potential new medicines offered by the proposed European Directive for the Legal Protection of Biotechnology Inventions.  
<P>
The aim of the European Directive, due to be debated in the New Year, is to promote an environment that will allow European biotechnology research to catch up with the USA and Japan.  As the leading centre of biotechnology research in Europe, the UK has the most to gain from patent protection for its discoveries.  
<P>
Go to <a href="bookshop.htm">Bookshop</a> to order your copy.
<P>

<B>25/11/96 - DoH proposes further additions to NHS 'Selected List'</B>
<P>
On the eve of the Budget, the Department of Health published a list of 60 products in seven therapeutic categories which could be added to the Selected List of Medicines no longer prescribable on the NHS.  They include 37 preparations for skin disorders and, for the first time, treatments for allergic disorders (11).  It is envisaged that most of the products would continue to be available from pharmacists over the counter.  Patient Groups, and the ABPI, have expressed concerns over the surprise announcement and the shortness of the consultation period.  Comments on the proposals are required by 9 January 1997.  The necessary regulations will then be laid before Parliament to come into effect early next year.  
<P>
The Selected List was extended from 10 to 17 therapeutic categories in 1992.  Recommendations as to which products should go on the list are made to Ministers by the Advisory Committee on Drugs.  
<P>

<B>19/11/96 - NHS Primary Health Care Bill</B>
<P>
The National Health Service (Primary Care) Bill received its First Reading in the House of Lords.  The Bill aims to allow health professionals to develop and pilot services in response to local needs.  It will provide greater flexibility for community pharmacists and provide more appropriate arrangements for the appointment of GPs.  Consultation with the professions will continue throughout the Bill's progress through Parliament, and it is hoped that the first pilot schemes will be launched on 1 April 1998.  
<P>

<B>13/11/96 - 2nd Government White Paper on the NHS</B>
<P>
The Government published its 2nd White Paper <I>"The National Health Service : A Service with Ambitions"</I> on the future direction of the NHS.  It restates the Government's commitment to the founding principles of the NHS; to reflect on how it is progressing; and to suggest how it should continue to develop into the next century from what is seen as the successful base established in the first 50 years.  It contains no proposals for legislation and no new policies.  
<P>

<B>12/11/96 - Efficiency Scrutiny on Prescription Fraud</B>
<P>
The DoH has launched a new Efficiency Scrutiny to examine the extent to which patients illegally claim exemption from paying the prescription charge within Family Health Services in England and Wales (while taking account of measures to deal with fraud within the hospital sector).  The Department also plans to introduce measures to strengthen the prescription form against fraudulent abuse.  The scrutiny will last for 90 days after which a report with recommendations for action will be made to the Secretary of State for Health.  
<P>

<B>23/10/96 - The Queen's Speech - A Primary Health Care Bill</B>
<P>
During the Queen's Speech at the State Opening of Parliament it was announced that "legislation will be introduced to improve and develop primary care services".  The Bill, to be published shortly, will be based on the White Paper: <I>Choice and Opportunity</I>, and will aim to increase flexibility in current primary care contractual arrangements which currently tend to impede the delivery of services.
<P>
<I>Choice and Opportunity</I> outlines proposals which would enable GPs and dentists to agree local contractual arrangements with their Health Authorities.  Community pharmacies will also be allowed to develop their relationships with contracting bodies.  The proposals will allow GPs to offer more varied and sophisticated services, and NHS Trusts (especially community trusts) will be able to employ salaried GPs which should help to improve services in poorly provided inner city areas.
<P>
All new schemes will be carefully piloted and will first have to receive direct approval from the Secretary of State.  The Labour and Liberal Democrat Parties, although broadly welcoming the measures, have expressed concern that they could undermine the non-commercial ethos of the NHS.  The BMA has welcomed the Bill as a way to help adventurous GPs develop new ideas.
<P>

<B>23/10/96 - The Queen's Speech - Long Term Care</B>
<P>
The Government also announced proposals to publish White Papers on Long Term Care in the Queen's Speech.  Originally the Department of Health hoped to introduce a Bill but the lack of Parliamentary time in the shortened session, combined with the complexities involved in drafting the required legislation, meant that this was not possible.  The Department now aims to publish draft legislation and a policy statement in the New Year, whilst the Treasury intends to produce complementary proposals for the regulation of the long term care insurance market.  The proposed measures will establish a partnership scheme to provide incentives for individuals to insure against their own long term care needs and will also allow people to make up the difference in cost between their Local Authority care provision and that of their own choice of care.
<P>
These proposals are in line with the Government's recent response to the Health Select Committee's Report:  <I>Long Term Care: Future Provision and Funding</I>, which identified many of the current problems in long term care provision.  The Government welcomed the Report in general and the new White Paper will take a number of its recommendations into account.  The Royal College of Nursing's (RCN) suggestion that the nursing care elements of nursing home costs should be met by the NHS was also welcomed as constructive by the Government but it concluded that 'it does not believe that it currently represents the highest priority for extra NHS expenditure'.  The RCN estimated that the transfer would cost the NHS £180m per annum.
<P>

<B>3/10/96 - Pharmaceutical Industry highly ranked by MPs (MORI)</B>
<P>
Of 36 British industry sectors, the Pharmaceutical Industry is now the 4th most favourably regarded by MPs, its highest placing to date, according to a new MORI survey.  The industry's strongest images, the survey confirms, are its R&D effort and its contribution to the UK economy.
<P>
78% of all MPs now view the industry favourably (Conservative MPs: 88%) - a rise of 7% over 1995.
<P>
The MORI survey was conducted among MPs between May and July.
<P>

<B>1/10/96 - "NHS Medicines" - new briefings for Parliamentarians</B>
<P>
2 new briefings for Labour and Conservative MPs and candidates are available from the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI).  They set out the benefits that the pharmaceutical industry brings to the health and wealth of the nation.

<B>30/9/96 - Disease Management - 2nd DoH consultative document</B>
<P>
After receiving a number of submissions to its consultative paper on Disease Management (published in May), the Department of Health has produced a second consultative document.  The paper stated that the Department sought "neither to encourage nor discourage joint disease management programmes" but proposes many new criteria which would make it much more difficult for private companies to enter into such agreements.  The voluntary sector are included as possible partners in joint ventures, in contrast to the original document, and the paper has been widely circulated to this sector.
<P>
The Department asked for comments by the end of October and claims that a final version will be issued later in the Autumn, possibly incorporated into wider guidance governing contracting.  However, given the timetable, this may slip into 1997.
<P>

<B>27/9/96 - "Prodigy and Patient Care" - new ABPI briefing</B>
<P>

<B>24/9/96 - Labour's Departmental Responsibilities</B>
<P>
Labour have announced new Departmental responsibilities.  In Chris Smith's health team, Kevin Barron (Rother Valley) takes on the role of Shadow Minister for Public Health, bringing into existence the Party's proposal to create such a role to address health impact of policies throughout all areas of government.   He retains his existing portfolio, including responsibility for the Pharmaceutical Industry.   Tessa Jowell (Dulwich), Shadow Health Minister, deputises for Mr Smith with additional responsibilities for London and dentistry services.   Ann Coffey (Stockport) manages the community and social services aspects of the health services.
<P>
Kevin Hughes (Doncaster North) has been appointed Health Whip.
<P>

<B>24/9/96 - New Health Service Ombudsman</B>
<P>
Michael Buckley (Chairman of Dartford and Gravesham NHS Trust) is to be the next Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration, and Health Service Commissioner.   His appointment takes effect on 2/1/97 when the present Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman, Sir William Reid, retires.  Mr. Buckley retired from the Civil Service in 1991 after 29 years within the administration.
<P>

<B>11/9/96 - Labour's "Vision for Growth"</B>
<P>
Labour have published its <I>"Vision for Growth: A new Industrial Strategy for Britain"</I>.   Written following consultation with the business community through the Party's <I>Industry Forum</I>, the policies set out are designed to answer a continuing decline in British industry.  Significantly, the Pharmaceutical Industry is described as a 'shining exception' to this decline.
<P>
The Party's approach combines a number of familiar New Labour themes and proposes a "practical approach to industrial policy", underpinned by low inflation and economic stability, where companies work in partnership with government, their employees, suppliers and other 'stakeholders' to achieve a competitive economy.
<P>
The Party promises to "put science, innovation, technology and design back at the centre of government thinking and action", one initiative being to support incubator companies in the development of individual scientific projects.  The Party does not propose to reverse the Government's decision to move the Office of Science and Technology to the DTI but does promise that the Chief Scientific Adviser would be given en enhanced role, with direct access to both the Prime Minister and Cabinet.  A wide range of other proposals are made and further consultation with business and industry is promised.
<P>

<B>9/9/96 - "Health Economics - an introduction to economic evaluation"</B>
<P>
This new publication from the OHE (Office of Health Economics) provides a useful overview of economic evaluation in healthcare and an insight into the techniques used, with examples.
<P>

<B>27/8/96 - New Briefing on  Promoting and Marketing Medicines </B>
<P>
The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) has issued a new media briefing on the rules governing the promotion and marketing of medicines.
<P>
It provides a useful and succinct summary of the Industry s Code of Practice which covers such matters as advertising to doctors, information for the general public, substantiation of claims and the training of medical representatives.

<P>

<B>29/7/96 - Prodigy: DoH issues interim report</B>
<P>
The DoH issued an interim report on its pilot testing of a computerised prescribing system for GPs and announced further studies for final evaluation in Autumn 1997. In response, Dr. Trevor Jones - Director General of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI), noted that a substantial group of prescribers had expressed anxiety over the system which clearly needs considerable revision.  He confirmed that the ABPI is looking forward to working with patients, doctors and the DoH in addressing the problems that the Report has highlighted, but noted "there must be no compromise with doctors' freedom to prescribe the medicines best suited for individual patients".
<P>

<B>25/7/96 - New Shadow Health Secretary</B>
<P>
Tony Blair announced on July 25th that Chris Smith (Islington South & Finsbury) is to replace Harriet Harman as Shadow Health Secretary.  In a straight job-swap, Ms Harman will take on Mr. Smith's former portfolio at Social Security.
<P>

<B>11/7/96 - New Media Briefing on Biotechnology</B>
<P>
A new  media briefing from the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) addresses frequently asked questions on the definition, role and future contribution of biotechnology in the development of new medicines.

<P>

<B>9/7/96 - Invest in Britain Bureau's Review of Operations</B>
<P>
The Invest in Britain Bureau published its Annual Review of Operations on 9th July.  It gives particular prominence to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors, painting an encouraging picture of investment in the UK.   Over 1,350 inward investment projects have been secured in the past 3 years, creating or safeguarding 285,000+ jobs and increasing the UK's total stock of inward investment to £159b (cf. 1985: £44b).   This constitutes 40% of all inward investment into the EU.
<P>
This success is attributed  to the UK's low rates of personal and corporate taxation, a skilled and flexible workforce, low social costs, low levels of industrial disputes and its continuing deregulation programme.  It warns that European competitors are trying to catch up.
<P>
R&D strength and the UK's licensing and regulatory environment, including the location in London of the EMEA, and the links between companies and the universities, are seen as important factors in attracting pharmaceutical investment.  One third of Europe's biotechnology companies - nearly 200 in total - are now located in Britain.
<P>

<B>8/7/96 - "Health of the Nation": New Target Announced</B>
<P>
A new key target, "The Environment" was announced at the 4th Anniversary Conference of the "Health of the Nation" on 8th July.   Health Secretary Stephen Dorrell and Tony Newton, Chairman of the Cabinet Committee on the HoN, emphasised that the HoN strategy should be co-ordinated across all Government departments and that the DoE would play a key role in this initiative.  The implications of poor air quality for those with severe asthma was cited as an example of the influence of the environment on the nation's health. (Further info: Tom Elliott,
DoE , 0171 276 4142).
<P>
Progress in the other 5 key areas was reported on, particularly advances being made in the development of the HoN Outcome Scales (HoNOS) following a comprehensive national survey of psychiatric morbidity.   There are downward trends in death from strokes, CHD, cancer and accidents.  A reduction in teenage pregnancies was achieved for the 3rd year running.   It was announced that new AIDS/HIV targets were under development to replace the current gonorrhoea model, building on the availability of prevalence data which have now been accumulated over several years.
<P>
Teenage smoking and obesity continue to be of concern and will be addressed by the <I>Respect</I> and <I>Active for Life</I> health promotion campaigns.
<P>

<B>5/7/96 - DTI R& D Scoreboard: Pharmaceuticals account for nearly one third</B>
<P>
The 6th annual UK R&D Scoreboard was published by the DTI on 5th July.  R&D investment as a whole by companies in the UK increased by 4.2% in 1995 - the smallest increase for 5 years (cf. 1994 6%, 1993 7.5%).  The increase in sales was much larger at 9% and profits grew by 18%.  Only 1 UK company, Glaxo Wellcome, is in the world's top 50 R&D investors.
<P>
Science & Technology Minister Ian Taylor said that the figures are "a warning signal" and Richard Freeman, Corporate Chief Economist at ICI, described the results as "mostly disappointing".
<P>
The pharmaceutical sector accounts for nearly one third of the total (£2.8b of £9.1b).  Although also contributing a third to the increase in spending, this represents a lower growth than in previous years and probably results from rationalisation of R&D following recent mergers.   The Report lists the top 22 pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies by UK R&D spend.
<P>

<B>4/7/96 - New Briefings on Biotechnology available to Parliamentarians</B>
<P>
3 new briefings from the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) are now available - "Biotechnology and Healthcare  (the role of biotechnology in developing new medicines), "Biotechnology and Patents" and "The Search for New Medicines".

<H3>1. BACKGROUND</H3> <P>

<ol type="a">
<li>
As part of the package of Autumn Statement measures the Right Honourable Mrs Virginia Bottomley MP, Secretary of State for Health, announced Government plans to extend by regulation the Limited List scheme.
<P>
<li>
The Limited List is a scheme whereby particular medicines in specified therapeutic categories may not be prescribed under the NHS.<P>
<li>
The scheme was introduced in April 1985 and included the following seven categories: indigestion remedies; laxatives; analgesics for mild to moderate pain; cough and cold remedies; vitamins; tonics; and benzodiazepine sedatives and tranquillisers.<P>
A further ten categories are to be added as follows:<P>
<ul>
<li> anti-diarrhoeal drugs<P>

<li> drugs for allergic disorders<P>

<li> hypnotics and anxiolytics<P>

<li> appetite suppressants<P>

<li> drugs for vaginal and vulval conditions<P>

<li> contraceptives<P>

<li> drugs used in anaemia<P>

<li> topical anti-rheumatics<P>

<li> drugs acting on the ear and nose<P>

<li> drugs acting on the skin<P>
</ul>
<li>
The Government will be advised by the Advisory Committee on NHS Drugs on which medicines within these categories will cease to be reimbursable on the NHS. In order to fulfil this role the Advisory Committee on NHS Drugs has had its terms of reference amended and its membership expanded.
</ol>

<H3>1. A KEY POINT SUMMARY
</H3> </a> <p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
The London and Thames Valley Pharmaceutical Group supports the Health Select Committee's view that GPs should have the freedom to prescribe the medicines they consider to be most appropriate for their patients.<P>
<li>
For patients, the real value is the much improved quality of life provided by medicines and the contribution of health promotion measures, such as immunisation, to patient welfare.
<p>
<li>
The use of new effective medicines is often responsible for a reduction in NHS hospital bed days and waiting lists with the consequence that financial savings can be yielded for the NHS.
<p>
<li>
The economy as a whole also benefits from the intelligent use of medicines. Shorter courses of treatment and a reduction in hospitalisation has a significant impact on the level of sickness absence and consequently the level of productivity and the welfare budget.
<p>
<li>
A successful medicine enables the pharmaceutical industry to maintain its financial support for the research of future medicines.
<p>
<li>
Consideration of only the short term cost implications of a medicine can result in the loss of health gain for patients as more expensive medicines may provide safer, more efficient treatment.</a><p>

<H2>GENERIC SUBSTITUTION IN THE UK
</H2> <p>
<B>JUNE 1994</B>

2.<a href="#2"> Definition Of Generic Substitution</a><p>
3.<a href="gen2.htm"> Government Position </a><p>
4. <a href="gen3.htm"> The Impact on the Pharmaceutical Industry </a><p>
5. <a href="gen4.htm">The Impact on the London and Thames Valley Pharmaceutical Group</a><p>
<p>

<a name="1"><H3>1. INTRODUCTION</H3></a>

<P>
The London and Thames Valley Pharmaceutical Group comprises 17
research led companies including Glaxo and SmithKline Beecham.
Its members are responsible for one third of the industry's research
and development and staffing in this country. The Group is a significant
local employer and member companies spend more than &#163;500
million a year on research and development and export more than
&#163;1 billion. In 1993, the UK pharmaceutical industry as a
whole contributed a surplus of &#163;1.5 billion to the balance
of trade.
<P>
The Group has followed closely the various methods which, in recent
years, have been discussed to control the drugs bill. In the main,
successive UK governments have adopted a system of profit controls
as reflected in the PPRS. In effect, they settled for an indirect
form of supply side control. By doing so, governments openly acknowledged
the value of inward investment to the UK by the pharmaceutical
industry and the need for significant investment in research and
development. In short, they struck a balance between controlling
the cost of medicines to the NHS and having a thriving research
and export based pharmaceutical industry in the UK.
<P>

<a name="2"><H3>2. DEFINITION OF GENERIC SUBSTITUTION</H3></a>

<P>
Generic substitution may be defined as permitting, or requiring,
the pharmacist to dispense a generic version - where one is available
- in place of the branded medicine specifically prescribed by
the GP. There is scope for refinements on that basic position,
for example by requiring the prescribing doctor to indicate whether
a generic may or may not be dispensed.
<P>
Generic substitution differs from generic prescribing where the
doctor makes the positive decision to prescribe the product generically.
This the industry supports and the government have been successful
at encouraging a high level of generic prescribing amongst GPs
in the UK.

<H2> A NATIONAL PRESCRIBING LIST IN THE UK

<p>
<a name="1"><H3>1. KEY POINT SUMMARY</H3></a>
<p>
<ul>
<li>
The London and Thames Valley Pharmaceutical Group is concerned by the Health Select Committee's proposal in July 1994 that medicines should eventually be available to patients in the NHS only if they were listed on a National Prescribing List.</li><P>


<li>The Group believes that it is of grave concern that this list would be drawn up not by health professionals at a local level but by a central bureaucracy.</li><P>


<li>About 17,000 medicines already on the market would be reviewed by central Government, a task that would take many years tying up time and effort that could be better spent elsewhere in the NHS.</li><P>


<li>The introduction of a National Prescribing List would impact on investment in research and development and consequently threaten the long-term stability of the pharmaceutical industry.</li><P>


<li>The choice of medicines available to patients would be restricted to those decided by the Government regardless of what the doctor might consider to be most appropriate for the patient.</li><P>


<li>Local health professionals are the best people to advise which medicines are best for their patients, and which offer best value for money: that is the path that LTVPG recommends.</li>
</ul>
<p>

<a name="2"><H3>2. INTRODUCTION</H3></a><P>

The London and Thames Valley Pharmaceutical Group (LTVPG), comprising 15 international research led companies of British, European and American origin and includes Glaxo and SmithKline Beecham. The Group is a significant local employer and its member companies together are the largest contributors to the British pharmaceutical industry's commitment to R & D investment and exports. Last year, the industry achieved a record surplus of &#163;1.7 billion and record exports of &#163;3,650 million - equivalent to &#163;45,000 per employee.

<H3>1. SUMMARY</H3><P>
<ul>
<li>
Research and development by the UK pharmaceutical industry plays a critical role in the search for new medicines. The industry spends over &#163;1.5 billion (1) each year on research and development, equivalent to 17.5% of gross output/sales(2). This is more than double that spent by government and charities combined.<P></li>

<li> Researching and developing new medicines is a high risk, high cost and long term business. It takes on average between 10 and 12 years to develop and market a new medicine and costs about &#163;200 million (3). 1 in 7 medicines becomes a commercial success.<P> </li>

<li> The research efforts of the UK pharmaceutical industry make a significant contribution to reducing the suffering of patients. Ten out of the top 20 medicines prescribed on the NHS are British (4). The industry is Britain's second largest manufacturing exporter and had a trade surplus in 1994 of &#163;1.7 billion (5).</li>

<H3>1. EXPORT SUCCESS</H3>

<ul>
<li>
The British pharmaceutical industry showed record trade figures for
its exports in 1995, making it the second largest manufacturing sector
in its contribution to Britain's balance of trade. The overall trade
surplus for the industry was &#163;2,133 million.
</li>
<P>

<li> The industry's 1995 exports of &#163;4,935 million were made up of &#163;2,592
million of trade with our European partners and &#163;1,343 million to
non-EU countries. The largest markets were the USA, followed by France, Germany, the Netherlands and Japan.</li>
<P>

<li>The industry's competitive performance in the world pharmaceutical
market is worth up to &#163;2 billion a year to the British economy, derived
from the earnings and profits, tax receipts and trade surplus that the
industry generates.

<H3>2. COSTS UNDER CONTROL</H3>
<P>
<ul>
<li> The industry provides the nation's medicines at a cost equivalent to
20p per person per day (Source ABPI briefing April 1996 "Investing in Better Health"). The annual cost of the medicines prescribed by GPs in the UK is about &#163;70 per person per year - around half the cost in France, Italy and Germany.</li>
<P>

<li> Figures for inflation rates in the health care sector show that the
pharmaceutical industry is making a significant contribution to keeping
down the costs of the NHS. In 1994, total NHS expenditure rose by 4.6%,
with 11.7 million more prescriptions dispensed than in the year before.
Retail Price Inflation rose by 2.9 per cent in the same period, while
pharmaceutical manufacturing prices fell by 2 per cent. The rate of
growth in the NHS medicines bill is slowing as pharmaceutical prices
have fallen.</li>
<P>

<li> Medicines are cost effective and frequently eliminate or reduce the
need for costly hospital care.  An average prescription costs the NHS
around &#163;8.28, while a week in hospital costs over &#163;1,100.

<H3>3. RESEARCH DRIVES THE INDUSTRY FORWARD</H3>
<P>
<ul>
<li> Expenditure on R&D in 1995 in the pharmaceutical sector was a record
&#163;2 billion, representing around 20 per cent of total UK investment in
research and development.  This amounts to more than &#163;5 million a day.</li>
<P>

<li> A value-added analysis of the R&D record of British companies over a
four year period put five pharmaceutical companies in the top 15.</li>
<P>

<li> More than 200 potential new medicines are under development by
pharmaceutical companies in the UK, making significant progress in
major disease areas. Ten of the top 35 prescribed medicines on sale in
the world were discovered and developed in UK laboratories.</li>
<P>

<li> The pharmaceutical industry carries out almost a third of all
industrial research and development in the UK, spending more than &#163;4
million a day. This investment has grown by five times in the past 15 years.</li>
<P>

<li> The pharmaceutical industry contributed more than 70 per cent of the
total health R&D expenditure in Britain, far more than Government,
charities and universities combined.</li>
<P>

<li>Four British pharmaceutical companies are ranked among the top ten UK
investors in industrial R&D, including the top two.

<H2>EXTENSION OF THE LIMITED LIST</H2> <P>
<p>
<H3>2. LTVPG OBJECTIVES</H3><P>

LTVPG opposes this unilateral action.<P>
<ul>

<li> LTVPG member companies seek to ensure that the greatest possible transparency exists during the Advisory Committee's consideration of the ten new categories and that the deepest possible consultation takes place.<P>

<li> LTVPG member companies hope that discussions between ABPI and the Department of Health ensure that the Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme develops in such a way as to restore confidence of the UK pharmaceutical industry when it addresses its long term plans. Such a PPRS outcome could mitigate the worst effects of a Limited List extension.<P>

<li> The LTVPG member companies regret that the Government is committed to extend the Limited List and believe that sufficient controls are in place to limit growth in NHS medicines expenditure and do not accept that such measures the extension of the Limited List are necessary further to control this growth.<P>
</ul>
</li>

This will mean that, with our partners in healthcare, we can ensure effective patient choice is maintained and the quality of their care is not undermined.

<H2>EXTENSION OF THE LIMITED LIST</H2> <P>
<p>
<H3>3. RATIONALE</H3><P>

<ol type="a">
<li>
The extension of the Limited List is being imposed in order to curb the growth in the NHS medicines bill, currently of the order of 12.1% per annum.<P>
<li>
It has been assumed that this growth is caused because the price of medicines is rising at the same rate. In fact, price increases for medicines represented just a 1.7 per cent rise in costs and the use of new medicines accounted for only 1.6 per cent growth.<P>
<li>
Since 1985, a number of controls have been introduced which have sought to ensure that prescribing is carried out rationally.<P>

<li>There are four main reasons for the growth in the total medicines bill, related directly or indirectly to Government policies:</ol> <P>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A general shift in the balance of provision from secondary to primary care including the encouragement of patient screening, leading to earlier treatment.<P>

<li> The drive to reducing hospital waiting lists which results in the treatment of more patients.<P>

<li> Demographics and specifically the increase in the number of elderly people in the population.<P>

<li> The rise in unemployment which creates additional demands on the healthcare services.
</ul>

<H2>EXTENSION OF THE LIMITED LIST</H2> <P>
<p>

<H3>4. IMPACT OF LIMITED LIST CHANGES</H3><P>

The ten new categories will, over the next few months, be assessed by the Advisory Committee on NHS Drugs.
Dependent on the outcome of these assessments, the following effects may emerge.

<H4>4.1 On Research, Development and Investment </H4><P>

<ul>
<li> UK research in the targeted therapeutic categories will stop. No significant advances have been made in the existing seven categories since 1985.<P>
<li>
New medicines in the additional categories, developed elsewhere, may not be made available to patients in the UK.<P>

<li> Two hundred new products currently under development are threatened.<P>

<li> The industry's vital contribution to the wider UK science base, in academia, medical institutions and research charities will be undermined. This will affect both finance for specific near-market research projects and funding support of pure or "blue sky" research.
<P>
</ul>

<A NAME="4.2"></A>
<TABLE><TD WIDTH="110"></TD><TD WIDTH="385">

<H4>4.2 On the Pharmaceutical Industry</H4><P>
<ul>
<li> The pharmaceutical industry operates on a long term basis: it takes &#163;150 million and 10-12 years to research, develop and bring a new medicine to patients. Instability is damaging. The pharmaceutical industry needs a stable base.<P>

<li> Nationally: potentially up to a &#163;400 million reduction in investment, much of which comes from overseas, and up to 5,000 jobs are in jeopardy.<P>

<li> Regionally: in the LTVPG the reduction in investment could be up to &#163;85 million with some 500 jobs at risk.<P>

<li> Sales at risk: potential loss is &#163;450 million nationally which is 16% of the total medicines bill with a wide ranging effect on different companies. As much as two thirds of the revenue of some companies may be at risk.<P>

<li> Adverse effect on the industry's export achievement which produced a trade surplus of &#163;1.2 billion in 1991.

<H4>4.3 On Patients</H4><P>
<ul>
<li> It is likely that the review of the categories covered by the Limited List will prevent many medicines being available to patients on the NHS. They will have to pay for them or change to a different and unfamiliar medicine. This will particularly affect those on low incomes.<P>

<li> The elderly will be severely affected as 32% of prescriptions issued last year in the ten new categories were written for pensioners.<P>

<li> There is a risk that women could suffer from restrictions on GPs' freedom to prescribe the most appropriate contraceptives and medicines for vaginal and vulval conditions. "Health of the Nation" identified a target of reducing unwanted pregnancies which could become threatened if contraceptives prescribing is restricted.<P>

<li> Mentally ill patients could also become more vulnerable because of the potential withdrawal of certain medicines within the hypnotics and anxiolytics category. This would go against the commitment to the mentally ill expressed in "Health of the Nation".<P>

<li> In addition, there can be no other medicines within these categories which will be added to the Limited List causing considerable patient concerns. These will only be known when the Advisory Committee has completed its deliberations.<P>

<li> Funding for patient and carer support groups and charities, much of which is provided by pharmaceutical companies, will be put at risk.

<H2>VALUE OF MEDICINES
</H2> <p>
<H3>2.1 Introduction</H3>
<p>
The London and Thames Valley Pharmaceutical Group (LTVPG) is a regional group comprising 15 international research-led companies of British, European and American origin and includes Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham. The Group is a significant local employer and its member companies together are the largest contributors to the British pharmaceutical industry's commitment to R & D investment and exports. Last year, the industry achieved a trade surplus of &#163;1.7 billion and exports of nearly &#163;4 billion - equivalent to more than &#163;53,000 per employee.</a><p>

<p>
<H3>2.2 Background</H3> <P>

LTVPG is keen to contribute to the debate on future healthcare policy and, in addition, is committed to working in partnership with the Government and the National Health Service for the promotion of health gain. We recognise the enormous pressures on the Department of Health to control public expenditure but would stress the value of medicines in making the best use of limited resources. The growth in the NHS medicines bill is due not to an increase in the price of medicines but to demographic effects, an increase in health promotion activity, and GPs trading up from older less expensive medicines to newer ones which are safer and more effective. The ability to manage more conditions in the primary setting has also contributed to the growth in the medicines bill.
<P>
It is important to note that the rate of growth in the medicines bill is decreasing. Much of this downward trend can be attributed to measures implemented to encourage rational prescribing: indicative prescribing amounts; the use of PACT (detailed prescribing data); and the increased use of generics and local formularies.
<P>
The Government has stated that its prescribing policy is based on the following principles:<p>
<ul>
<li>
patients should have access, through the NHS, to effective drugs to meet all real clinical need;</li>
<li>the provision of those drugs should be efficient and cost-effective.</li>
<p>
</ul>

(Source: Government Response to the Health Select Committee Report Priority Setting in the NHS: The NHS Drugs Budget, para (iii), October 1994)<P>

The Health Select Committee Report recognised that GPs have the freedom to prescribe whichever drugs they consider most appropriate for their patients. In addition, it stated 
<ul>
<B><I>"the containment of costs, though desirable, must be subordinate to the need to ensure appropriate treatment; such treatment will itself, of course, often be the most cost-effective."</I></B></ul>
<p>
 The Report also stated: <P>

<ul>
<B><I>"it would be wrong if too great a preoccupation with the cost issue in isolation were to encourage under-prescribing or have an adverse effect on patient care."</I></B></li>
</ul>
<p>

 (Source: Health Select Committee Report Priority Setting in the NHS: The NHS Drugs Budget, paras 42 and 165, July 1994)
<p>
LTVPG welcomes these principles, believes that the pharmaceutical industry has made a significant contribution to health gain through the provision of medicines to meet clinical need and endorses the importance of efficient and cost-effective prescribing.</a><p>

<H2>VALUE OF MEDICINES
</H2> <p>
<H3>2.3 Value to Patients</H3>
<p>
Considerable benefits can be achieved for patients through the intelligent use of medicines. Much evidence exists to demonstrate that medicine therapy can result in the significant reduction of both morbidity and mortality in a number of conditions. For many patients, the real value is in the much improved quality of life provided, for example, by the use of anti-emetics to off-set the side effects of chemotherapy in the treatment of cancer.
<P>
Health promotion measures also provide a major contribution to patient welfare. Early identification of disease, with subsequent treatment by medication, not only reduces human suffering but also helps to keep patients out of hospital. The recent Department of Health immunisation programme for mumps, measles and rubella demonstrates how successful this approach can be. In April this year, Chief Medical Officer Dr Kenneth Calman revealed that, in the first quarter of this year, confirmed measles dropped by 85 per cent in England and Wales compared with the previous two months and added that 92 per cent of the school age population were immunised.
<P>
The treatment of peptic ulcers with medicines is a further example of how drug therapy provides significant opportunities for a reduction in hospital admissions. A survey on the management of peptic ulcers in Scotland during the 1980s showed that in Tayside, where patients received long-term continuous therapy with H2-receptor antagonists, hospital admissions for the condition decreased by 27% compared with the rest of Scotland where there was a fall of only 5%. A similar pattern emerged with the rate of admissions for ulcer haemorrhage which fell by 29% in Tayside compared with 7% in the rest of Scotland. (Source: Aliment Pharmacol Therapy 1993: 7: 429-442)
<P>
Treatment of severe mental illness further illustrates how the quality of patients' lives can be improved. Advances in the development of medicines for schizophrenia have resulted in improvements in patients who previously did not respond to older medicines and have subsequently enabled them to leave hospital and residential care.
<P>
Two million people in the UK suffer psoriasis, and quality of life surveys indicate that it can be distressing and severely debilitating. Nevertheless, many patients prefer to suffer in silence, having become dissatisfied with the efficacy or acceptability of traditional treatments in the long term. They had apparently given up hope of finding an effective user-friendly treatment.
<p>
The vitamin D analogues have recently shown considerable promise in psoriasis. Their success has stimulated further research into the condition and its mechanisms and genetics. The result is likely to be progressively better treatment for this important group of patients.<p>

<H2>VALUE OF MEDICINES
</H2> <p>
<H3>2.4 Value to the NHS
</H3> <P>
There is considerable evidence demonstrating that therapeutic advances and the use of new effective medicines result in the reduction of bed days in NHS hospitals and waiting lists with consequential financial savings for the NHS.
<P>
There is increasing recognition of this fact. In May 1994, the Department of Health in conjunction with the ABPI, published guidelines on the economic evaluation of medicines. Health Secretary Rt Hon Virginia Bottomley MP commented at the time: 
<P>
<ul>
<B><I>"The economic evaluation of medicines means looking at the long-term cost consequences of utilising particular drug therapies compared to other treatments for the same condition." </I></B>
</ul>

The Government later rejected the Health Select Committee's recommendation for compulsory cost-evaluation although it re-affirmed that the Department of Health is encouraging companies to undertake such studies which 

<ul>
<B><I>"cannot provide a satisfactory basis for banning a product from supply, but are very useful in helping doctors to decide between competing products or interventions".</I></B>

<P>
 (Source: Government Response to Priority Setting in the NHS: The NHS Drugs Budget, para 17)
</ul>
<p>
The Health Select Committee recognised that inappropriate prescribing has an impact on both patient welfare and the drugs budget and concluded that rational prescribing is not always cheaper prescribing. It cited evidence showing that an increase in the prescription of inhaled corticosteroids - costing far more than the traditional bronchodilators - for asthma sufferers would result in a reduction of the much steeper expense associated with hospital admissions in the case of severe asthma attacks. (Source: Health Select Committee Report Priority Setting in the NHS: The NHS Drugs Budget, paras 144 (5) and 145, 20 July 1994)
<p>
This evidence was supported by an audit of a GP practice in Norwich between 1987 and 1994 of asthma patients. The audit found that an increase in the use of inhaled steroids resulted in a reduction of the average annual drug cost per asthmatic diagnosed from &#163;115 to &#163;80.
<P>
In addition, the practice's workload for asthma-related problems fell considerably and consequently its overall costs for primary and secondary care in this area were &#163;25,000 less than the local average. (Source: British Thoracic Society Winter Meeting, 1994)
<P>
A further example is in the treatment of kidney failure. Annual dialysis costs are very expensive and normally range from &#163;13,000 to &#163;20,000 per year per patient. By contrast, although each kidney transplant costs approximately &#163;10,000, including surgery and in-patient expenses, the subsequent annual cost of an immunosuppressant is usually a quarter or less of annual dialysis treatment. In short, the combination of a transplant and subsequent medication is significantly less expensive in all but the very short term and greatly improves the quality of life for a patient.
<P>
A US study of schizophrenia patients treated with an anti-psychotic found that the number of hospital bed days fell by an average of 132 days per year after 1.5 years, 166 days per year after two years, and 201 days per year after 2.5 years. This represented enormous savings in hospital costs. (Source: Hospital and Community Psychiatry, Vol 45, No 3, March 1994)

<H2>VALUE OF MEDICINES
</H2> <p>
<H3>2.5 Value to the Economy</H3>
<P>
The intelligent use of medicines not only provides real value to the NHS but also to the economy generally. Screening and early intervention requiring shorter courses of treatment - and often enabling patients to avoid hospitalisation - will result in a fall in the level of sickness absence from work. Lost employment has a significant impact on both the level of productivity and the welfare budget.
<P>
For the year, 1991-92, it was calculated that lost employment caused by asthma (11 million days) cost the Department of Social Security &#163;101 million in sickness and invalidity benefits with the cost of lost productivity amounting to an estimated &#163;558 million. (Source: Asthma - The Key Facts)
<p>
The pharmaceutical industry itself is a significant employer and, last year, employed over 75,000 people in the UK. A further 250,000 people are employed as a result of the presence of the pharmaceutical industry in Great Britain. Over the same period, the industry topped the UK industrial investment league and achieved a trade surplus of &#163;1,697 million. President of the Board of Trade Rt Hon Michael Heseltine MP, when giving evidence to the Trade and Industry Select Committee, said:
<P>
<ul>
<B><I>"Two of the most successful industries we have are essentially long-term industries; the pharmaceutical industry and the defence industries and they are amongst our most successful exporters and they are amongst our most successful companies". </I></B> <I>(6 July 1994) </I>
</ul>

<A NAME="2.6"></A>

<H3>2.6 Value to Research, Development and Science
</H3>
<p>
There is recognition in both the main political parties of the importance of R & D.<P>

At the launch of "Prescribe UK", which seeks to encourage pharmaceutical inward investment, Health Secretary Rt Hon Virginia Bottomley MP said:<p>
<ul>

<B> <I>"The UK is among the world's leaders in invention and scientific exports: 10 of the top 35 medicines available world-wide were discovered and developed here. The UK has a highly skilled workforce and gives a high priority to research and development".</I> </B> <I>(14 December 1994)</I>
</ul>
<P>
The Labour Party consultation paper Health 2000 pointed out that scientific developments in the field of molecular and genetic research have created the opportunity to eliminate or control the progress of major modern illnesses and cited Alzheimer's Disease, cystic fibrosis and muscular dystrophy as areas where advances have been made in the understanding of genetic disorders. (Source: Health 2000, February 1994)
<p>
A successful medicine not only provides benefits for patient welfare and to the NHS but also enables the pharmaceutical industry to continue financing the research of future medicines. This research takes many years to reach fruition and it is vital that the UK industry remains in a position to continue with such investment which is currently in the region of &#163;1.6 billion a year. Of the top seven R & D British companies, no less than four are in the pharmaceutical sector.

<H3>3. CONCLUSION</H3>
The London and Thames Valley Pharmaceutical Group would urge any Government to take a long-term holistic approach to the value of medicines. The intelligent use of medicines is good for patients, for the National Health Service, the national economy and for research and development.
Consideration of only the short term cost implications of a medicine can result in the loss of health gain for patients as more expensive medicines may provide safer, more efficient treatment which in fact provides better value to the NHS.
<P>
The Group hopes that through forums such as the Joint ABPI/Government Strategic Working Group, the Government and industry can develop strategies which will enable the pharmaceutical industry to continue to successfully develop new medicines which will provide health gain for patients and value to the NHS.

<H2>GENERIC SUBSTITUTION IN THE UK
</H2> <p>
<B>JUNE 1994</B>
<p>

<H3>3. GOVERNMENT POSITION</H3>

<P>
The Government has consistently rejected proposals for generic
substitution in the NHS. For example, during the House of Commons
Selected List debate in 1985, the then Secretary of State for
Social Services Norman Fowler commented:
<P>
<ul>
<B>&quot;Others would favour compulsory generic substitution across
the whole range of drugs, including what are undoubtedly life-saving
drugs... ...There is no doubt that the industry's research efforts
would be seriously undermined by that sort of action.&quot;</B>
<I>(Hansard, 18 March 1985, Col 693)</I> 
</ul>
<P>
Minister of State for Health at the time Kenneth Clarke said:
<P>
<ul>
<B>&quot;Generic substitution... ...would create great problems
if a doctor prescribed one drug and a different formulation was
dispensed by a chemist, and those problems could not be resolved.
It would have damaged research in key areas&quot;.</B> <I>(Hansard, 18 March 1985, Col 747) </I>
</ul>
<P>
By that time, the Government had significantly shifted its attitude
to pharmaceuticals by proposing the first Selected List (a supply
side control) and beginning to develop a range of demand side
controls: PACT, drug budgets, FHSA Advisers. They did, however,
hold to their line of opposing generic substitution. They stated
publicly that their preference was to persuade doctors to increase
the proportion of prescriptions written generically. In this,
they have had a good measure of success. The proportions written
in generic form have increased from 35% in 1985 to 43% in 1992
(DoH Statistical Bulletin) with up to 49% among fundholders (Hansard,
21 March 1994, Col 70W).
<P>
DoH officials have indicated previously that the government would
like to see the level rise to at least 60%. Its successful but
incremental introduction through encouragement (rather than enforcement)
of GP prescribing allows the research based industry to manage
its brands post patent expiry, in an open market situation and
hence have a slower decline curve than the 100% decline that would
be seen with generic substitution.
<P>
However, on 17 February 1994, at the final oral evidence session
of the recent Health Select Committee inquiry into the drugs budget,
Health Minister Dr Brian Mawhinney announced that he had instructed
officials in the Department of Health to investigate how generic
substitution could be introduced. This was contrary to the commitment
in last year's PPRS agreement that additional measures would not
be contemplated without full consultation. Although the industry
welcomed Secretary of State for Health Mrs Virginia Bottomley's
comments on 23 March 1994 at the FT Pharmaceutical Conference
and subsequently at the ABPI dinner on 14 April 1994 that the
Government remains to be convinced about the merits of generic
substitution, the issue is still on the DoH's agenda. The industry
is seeking to ensure that the Government takes full account of
its views on this matter, particularly with regard to the impact
on one of the UK's most successful industries.

<H2>GENERIC SUBSTITUTION IN THE UK
</H2> <p>
<B>JUNE 1994</B>
<p>
<H3>4. THE IMPACT ON THE PHARMACEUTICAL
INDUSTRY</H3>

<P>
The cumulative effect of the Government's long succession of both
supply side and demand side constraints (Selected List, a tough
PPRS incorporating a 2.5% price reduction to last for three years,
target budgets etc) is significantly undermining the confidence
of international pharmaceutical companies in the UK as a suitable
place for investment. The pharmaceutical industry has to plan
for the long-term and therefore needs stability. Generic substitution
in the UK could be the last straw. Some Ministers and officials
continue in speeches to acknowledge the importance of this industry's
contribution to the UK economy but seem not to appreciate the
damaging effect on confidence of the large number of steps they
have taken against the industry. Pharmaceuticals are, in fact,
one of the UK's last successful high tech industries and currently
earn over &#163;3 billion in exports and contribute a trade surplus
of &#163;1.5 billion to &quot;UK Plc&quot; which would fall very
significantly if generic substitution was to be introduced.
<P>
Simultaneously with Dr Mawhinney's announcement on generic substitution,
the DoH and the DTI were discussing how to develop a strategy
for inward pharmaceutical investment from the United States and
Japan.
<P>
Mrs Bottomley has in fact stressed the importance for the pharmaceutical
industry not only of long-term stability but also of a constructive
partnership with the Government.
<P>
<ul>
<B>&quot;We believe in working with industry, and listening to
its concerns, needs and interests. Partnership is the best way
to meet the needs of patients&quot;.</B>

<P>
 (FT Pharmaceutical Conference, London, 23 March 1994). 
</ul>
<P>
Her recognition of the industry's <b>&quot;exceptional contribution
to our economy&quot;</b> is endorsed by President of the Board of
Trade Michael Heseltine.
<P>
Over half of the revenue of the research-based companies is derived
from the sale of off-patent brands and it is this revenue which
funds research into the new medicines of the future. Innovative
new medicines make a substantial loss in their first few years
on the market and until they are launched in all major world markets.
Hence it is difficult to raise revenue to fund ongoing R&amp;D
projects based on the sale of innovative medicines alone. In the
UK, the NHS is the sole purchaser of medicines and consequently
the pharmaceutical industry does not operate in a `normal' market.
Therefore, the usual options which allow companies in other commercial
markets to respond to changes in circumstances do not exist for
the pharmaceutical industry.
<P>
The impact of Government measures on the UK industry was highlighted
in the response by Prescribing Partners (a US group of R &amp;
D based companies) to a recent US General Audit Office report.
This demonstrated UK drug prices - on average - to be 60% lower
than the US. However, one of the consequences is that between
1970 and 1992, the UK introduced only 24 innovative products compared
to 113 by the US.

<H2>GENERIC SUBSTITUTION IN THE UK
</H2> <p>
<B>JUNE 1994</B>
<p>
<H3>5. THE IMPACT ON THE LONDON AND THAMES VALLEY
PHARMACEUTICAL GROUP</H3>

<P>
Although generic substitution is not yet an official proposal
and despite Mrs Bottomley's welcome assurances that the Government
&quot;remains to be convinced&quot; about the issue, there is
deep concern within the Group that it is viewed favourably in
other parts of the health sector. Such a measure would impact
severely on the turnover of the Group's member companies. The
consequential and detrimental effect on investment in research
and development and employment levels will be an indication of
the critical threat to the pharmaceutical industry posed by generic
substitution. Furthermore, the industry's very favourable contribution
(&#163;1.5 billion) to the balance of trade would be sharply reduced.
The London and Thames Valley Pharmaceutical Group would face a
combined loss of sales of &#163;440 million per annum with redundancies
of at least 1,340.
<P>
The Group urges Mrs Bottomley to ensure that her promise of full
consultation is upheld. It is vital that the potential negative
impact on one of the UK's leading industries is fully considered.
It urges the Government to guarantee that on this and future issues
proper consultation and transparency will take place. The Group
strongly believes that only through such co-operation between
the industry and the Government - the Joint DoH/DTI/Treasury/
ABPI Strategic Working Party is of particular importance - will
an acceptable formula be found for an affordable level of justifiable
growth in the drugs bill.

<H2> A NATIONAL PRESCRIBING LIST IN THE UK</H2> <p>
<B>MARCH 1995</B>
<p>

<H3>3. BACKGROUND</H3><P>

In July 1994, the Health Select Committee published its second Report Priority Setting in the NHS: The NHS Drugs Budget. In addition to written evidence, the Committee took oral evidence from a range of witnesses representing the medical profession, patient groups, the pharmaceutical industry, health economists and the Department of Health.<P>


Although there are several references recognising the value of both medicines and the pharmaceutical industry, the Report makes a number of proposals which are of serious concern to the industry. These include the introduction of a National Prescribing List. The Government's Response to this Report, published in October 1994, does not allay all of these legitimate concerns.<P>


The Committee recommends the establishment of a National Prescribing List by means of a revised form of the Selected List Scheme (medicines which may not be prescribed by GPs under the NHS). It suggests that:<P>

<ul>
<B><I>"all new products would be prescribable on the NHS. After five years a time sufficient to allow formal assessment of the therapeutic value of the product, each drug would be reviewed according to the criteria applied to drugs in the current NHS Selected List. Those drugs which were found to be less effective, or more expensive with no therapeutic advantage, than competitor drugs would then be excluded from being prescribed on the NHS" (Para 132).The Committee also proposes the systematic review of each drug already licensed and available on the NHS, either five years after its licence renewal or by reviewing medicines by category.</I></B> <P></ul>


Similar to the Selected List Scheme, the operation of a National Prescribing List would be hugely administrative and its management would require a large number of civil servants.<P>

<ul>
<li>The Select Committee acknowledges that the creation of a National Prescribing List "would have implications for the continued existence of the PPRS. We have earlier called for a review within five years, and a decision on its future should be taken on the basis of that review. In the interim the PPRS should be retained." (Para 139).<P></li>

<li>The Government's Response does not rule this out and indicates that that this option will be considered in the future by the Department of Health: </li>
<P>

<B><I>"In the period leading up to the review of the PPRS in 1998 the Government will be considering a range of options for what should happen after then. This will include the option of replacing the Selected List Scheme with a positive list of the medicinal products which may be prescribed at NHS expense on the lines of the National Prescribing List recommended by the Committee" (Page 10).</I></B> <P>


<li>This is of very great concern to the London and Thames Valley Pharmaceutical Group.</li>
</ul>

<H2> A NATIONAL PRESCRIBING LIST IN THE UK</H2> <p>
<B>MARCH 1995</B>
<p>

<H3>4. INTRODUCTION OF A NATIONAL PRESCRIBING LIST</H3><P>

A National Prescribing List using Selected List criteria is the Select Committee's "theory" of what should happen, but the practice would be very different. The criteria for inclusion of a medicine on the Selected List for those categories that are covered by the terms of reference of the Advisory Committee on NHS drugs are:<P>
<ul>
<li>
clinical need taking into account relative efficacy</li><P>


<li>comparative cost.</li><P>

</ul>

Data are provided (in summary and report format) to show the clinical need for the product. Comparative cost data, in terms of cost to the NHS of the medicine compared to the cost of other NHS medicines in the same category for the same indications, are also supplied. The cost comparisons between drugs and the resultant price levelling is effectively "reference pricing" (ie it sets a limit on the price that can be charged for any medicine in that therapeutic category). The relative efficacy of products is extremely difficult to quantify.<P>


Many parties have expressed concern that the decision making process lacks transparency and have strongly questioned the claimed success of the Selected List in achieving its aims (the savings have been substantially less than anticipated and the current extension to the list announced over two years ago is still not complete). It is difficult to understand how a National Prescribing List is more likely to succeed than the Selected List, given that the criteria would remain the same.

<H2> A NATIONAL PRESCRIBING LIST IN THE UK</H2> <p>
<B>MARCH 1995</B>
<p>

<H3>5. INFRASTRUCTURE REQUIRED TO SUPPORT A NATIONAL PRESCRIBING LIST</H3> <P>

<ul>
<li>
Such a List would require the eventual assessment of 17,000 individual medicines covering all therapeutic categories. This would result in a very slow and painstaking process, involving many civil servants with considerable cost implications, as recognised in the Government's Response which states: <P></li>


<B><I>"A National Prescribing List would not be easy or cheap to operate. The work of the Advisory Committee since the beginning of 1993 in reviewing the new categories has been enormous. To have a scheme which included all therapeutic categories would be a very significant activity, requiring substantial resources and drawing on the goodwill and voluntary commitment of an even larger group of professional experts".</I></B> <P>

<li>A permanent committee would have to be created and, given the volume of medicines involved, would probably need to meet in continuous session. Such a committee would require a wide range of experts and an appeals system in order to meet the appropriate legal and transparency requirements. External bodies, patient groups in particular, should be provided with the opportunity to submit evidence. It is likely that the Committee would face legal challenges.<P></li>

<li>In addition, a National Prescribing List would also require considerable input from the Department of Health to manage, update and amend so that it could be responsive to changes in medical practice and prescribing patterns.</li>

<H2> A NATIONAL PRESCRIBING LIST IN THE UK</H2> <p>
<B>MARCH 1995</B>
<p>
<H3>6. DAMAGE TO THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY </H3><P>

<ul>
<li>
A National List involving blacklisting, individual price controls and five yearly reviews, would be extremely destabilising for the industry.</li><P>

<li> The R & D process is already uncertain, with only one in 10,000 compounds researched ever becoming a medicine in general use, and of those which do, only three in 10 recover more than their R & D costs during product life. A National Prescribing List, with its threat of arbitrary removal from the market after five years, would add to that uncertainty, and discourage investment, with a possible resultant loss to doctors and patients of valuable innovative medicines.<P></li>

<li> Removal of a medicine from the market five years after marketing would negate any benefits that could be obtained via the patent term restoration which was introduced in April 1993 in recognition of the need for the pharmaceutical industry to obtain a reasonable return on investment.<P></li>

<li> It is likely that the introduction of a National Prescribing List would enforce a reduction in the price of all branded medicines to that of the generic equivalent at the first five yearly review after patent expiry, thereby further reducing the return required for future R & D investment.<P></li>

<li> The attraction of the UK as an investment base for US, European, and in particular Japanese companies would also be considerably damaged. The effects of this measure therefore would be in direct conflict with the Government's current `Prescribe UK' initiative which aims to encourage such investment.</li>

<B>MARCH 1995</B>
<p>
<H3>7. EFFECTS ON PRESCRIBING AND PRODUCTS</H3> <P>
<ul>
<li> It may be perceived that a National Prescribing List would provide savings by eliminating ineffective medicines. However, all medicines available in the UK today have undergone a rigorous review and satisfied the Medicines Control Agency of their quality, safety and efficacy. Therefore, we could anticipate a severe reduction in the availability of medicines purely on the basis of comparative cost without taking account of the cost benefit. This would also effectively limit prescribers' freedom to prescribe the most appropriate medicine for their patients.<P></li>

<li> Many medicines, for example ACE Inhibitors, &szlig;-Blockers, Proton Pump Inhibitors, and Immunomodulators later in their marketing life, are found to have indications and potential benefits which do not appear on their initial data sheet or within the first five years of marketing. In addition, due to the inherent conservatism of UK doctors, medicines in the first five years may not achieve the level of usage necessary to provide the basis for a full assessment of their therapeutic value. Their exclusion from the National Prescribing List after five years could remove substantial patient benefit in the longer term.<P> </li>


<li>Patients may not be able to obtain the medicines most appropriate to them on the NHS. The Government's Response indicates that this already the case in areas where positive lists exist such as for dressing and appliances, stating that their <P> </li>

<B><I>"operation has presented a number of difficulties, not least the barrier it presents to new products which offer prospective therapuetic advantage. The Committee's ideas on how that might be overcome, in the context of their suggestion, will be examined" (Para 31).</I></B> </li>

<H2> A NATIONAL PRESCRIBING LIST IN THE UK</H2> <p>
<B>MARCH 1995</B>
<p>

<H3>Conclusion</H3> <P>

The London and Thames Valley Pharmaceutical Group would strongly oppose the introduction of a National Prescribing List which would undermine freedom of choice for patients and for doctors, and because it would damage the research based industry for the reasons given above.<P>


Furthermore, it would be unnecessary. The Government already has a formidable array of controls which include the Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme, PACT, indicative drug budgets and the Selected List, and there is strong pharmaceutical competition from generic companies and European Union countries.<P>


We believe that rational prescribing with an appropriate balance of branded and generic products should be encouraged and that health professionals within the NHS should get value for money. Hospital formularies, GP formularies and, in some cases, joint hospital formularies are already widely spread across the UK and are a much more appropriate mechanism for assessing therapeutic and cost benefit within the local environment.<P>


In a competitive environment favourable cost benefit analyses and studies are critical for a product's success and these data are available to formulary committees. Locally based measures, based on outcomes and cost effectiveness wihin the NHS, where individual purchasers have responsibility to deliver quality healthcare and accountability to justify expenditure, should benefit patients and keep overall expenditure within affordable limits.
<P>

The Group welcomed the establishment in 1993 of the Joint DoH/ABPI/DTI/Treasury Strategic Working Group and we believe that this is the right forum in which to discuss the development of policy which would enable the pharmaceutical industry to continue successfully to research, develop and market medicines on a basis which recognises the contribution that it makes to the health and prosperity of the UK and the legitimate interest of the tax payers in seeking value for money.

 [Dr Trevor Jones, Director-General of the ABPI, A to Z of British Medicines Research, ABPI, 1995] </ul>

The research and development efforts of the UK pharmaceutical industry are critical in the search for new medicines. <P>

The UK based industry spends &#163;1.5 billion a year on R&D. This is equivalent to over &#163;4 million each day and accounts for almost one third of all industrial research and development in the UK and more than 70% of the total health R&D expenditure in Britain (6).<P>


The pharmaceutical industry is the UK's largest R&D investor in the civil sector. It invests 17.5% of sales in R&D, more than other R&D intensive industries. The table below compares R&D expenditure by other industries as demonstrated by the table below.<P>

Industry R&D spend as % of sales<pre>
	Pharmaceuticals 		17.5%
	Electronics		 	10.5%
	Aerospace 			9.5%
	Chemicals		        6%
	Motor Vehicles        		2%
	Electrical Engineering		1.5%

</H2> <p>
<B>MARCH 1995</B>
<p>
<H3>3. RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT - HIGH RISK, HIGH COST, LONG-TERM</H3> <P>
<ul>
<B><I>"Two of the most successful industries we have are essentially long-term industries; the pharmaceutical industry and the defence industries and they are among our most successful exporters and they are amongst our most successful companies".</I></B> <P>

 [President of the Board of Trade, giving evidence to the Trade & Industry Select Committee, 6 July 1994]<P>
</ul>
 
Medicines research is extremely risky, very costly, and enormously time-consuming, with only one or two new compounds out of every 10,000 discovered becoming an approved medicine. The rest are discarded, at considerable cost to the company, during the rigorous tests required to establish a compound's safety, efficacy and quality. <P>


When a new compound shows potential for treating a disease, a lengthy process of testing begins to check its toxicity, purity and stability; assess different formulations; and develop methods of production on a larger scale. These tests are carried out simultaneously but it takes many years before trials on humans may begin. The first human trials are on healthy volunteers, followed by clinical trials on patients in hospitals. Tests on humans also take many years. Only when a compound's safety, efficacy and quality have been established can a product licence be applied for with the Medicines Control Agency or the European Medicines Evaluation Agency, based in London. This is usually some 12 years after the compound has first been registered.

<H2> A NATIONAL PRESCRIBING LIST IN THE UK
</H2> <p>
<B>MARCH 1995</B>
<p>
<H3>3.1 Stages in the discovery and development of a new medicine</H3> <P>
<pre>
Discovery                          3-20+ years
Activity and Pre-Clinical Safety   2-4 years     Patent Filed - 20 years
Clinical Safety + Efficacy         3-7 years     Effective
Registration                       1 year
Marketing                          Patent Life
Generic Competition                End of Patent Protection
</pre>
<P>


Average costs for researching, developing and bringing to market a new medicine are approximately &#163;200 million. The development costs of a new compound are about twice those of the primary research undertaken to discover a new compound. Pharmaceutical research comprises four essential stages: primary research; discovery; development and clinical trials. The clinical trials only cover a limited number of patients so the product is kept under review of its effectiveness or possible adverse reactions once it has been launched onto the market through a Post-marketing Surveillance study.<P>


The patent on a new compound is filed when it is first discovered (not when the medicine is first marketed). This means that effective patent life during which the innovators can hope to recoup their costs and generate revenue to make further research and innovation possible is only 8-13 years. When the patent has expired, other (generic) companies are able to manufacture the medicine. This reduces the innovator's return on R&D investment costs. Market share is further reduced at the end of the patent life by the high levels of generic prescribing practised by GPs, especially in the UK.

<H2> A NATIONAL PRESCRIBING LIST IN THE UK
</H2> <p>
<B>MARCH 1995</B>
<p>
<H3>3.2 The Challenges ahead</H3> <P>

The outstanding success of the pharmaceutical industry should not be taken for granted. New discoveries will only remain possible if the pharmaceutical industry remains in a strong enough position to maintain high levels of R&D. Enormous challenges face the industry both nationally and globally. <P>


With the costs of R&D escalating annually, financing research is of major concern to the industry. The resources to finance future medical advances come from the success of past discoveries but as the average length of time taken to discover and develop new medicines increases, the effective patent life and return on investment decreases. This threatens funding for future research. <P>


The current wave of rationalisations in the pharmaceutical industry is a means of seeking to address this problem as pharmaceutical companies attempt to maintain the competitive advantage and address the challenges of the future.<P>


Due to the long term nature of the UK pharmaceutical industry, it requires stability to prosper. Some of the measures announced by the Government in recent years (eg the selected list extension, a tighter PPRS and an imposed price reduction) as a means of controlling public expenditure on the drugs budget have been disruptive to long term planning and have adversely affected some R&D investment. <P>


The setting up of the Joint Strategy Working Group, consisting of representatives from the Departments of Health; Trade & Industry; the Treasury; and the ABPI, as a forum for discussion, has dramatically improved cooperation and consultation between the industry and the Government and is greatly supported by the industry.

<H3>4. THE BENEFITS OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT </H3><P>
<ul>
<B><I>"It would be hard to overstate the contribution of the industry in healthcare, and that is quite apart from the contribution of the pharmaceutical industry to the economy....furthermore in many of the areas where we would hope for a breakthrough, eg treatment of AIDs, the hopes must be pinned on a flourishing pharmaceutical industry"</I></B>

<H3>4.1 For Patients </H3><P>

The result of the industry's R&D efforts has been the discovery of new medicines which have brought relief from suffering for millions of people. The years since World War II have seen a marked improvement in the health of people in the Western world and this is evident from increased life expectancy and reduced childhood mortality. Although the research efforts of the pharmaceutical industry cannot take credit alone (improved public health measures, health education and preventive measures are also important) the contribution of medicines should not be underestimated.<P>


The development of vaccines has led to the eradication or containment of many previously fatal illnesses such as smallpox, polio, diphtheria and tetanus. The discovery of modern medicines has saved millions of lives and reduced the prevalence of many serious illnesses. Advances in the development of medicines for asthma and mental health illnesses have also transformed the quality of life for many people. Many diseases which used to require surgery or hospitalisation such as ulcers, arthritis, heart disease and cancer can now be treated with modern medicines. <P>


The industry is currently committing enormous resources into research to improve treatments for these conditions as well as into finding treatments for as yet incurable diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, AIDs and multiple scelorosis. More than 200 potential new medicines are currently under development by pharmaceutical companies in the UK. The development of human genetics has been a notable discovery and the work underway to map the whole human genome will define genes which predispose people to genetic diseases. It has opened the way for gene therapy and a whole new area of biotechnology and with it the potential for cures for many previously untreatable diseases such as cystic fibrosis and muscular dystrophy.

<H3>4.2 For the NHS</H3> <P>

The NHS, medical institutions, research charities and academia benefit greatly from the R&D undertaken by the pharmaceutical industry. A significant amount of clinical evaluation is carried out within universities and teaching hospitals which increases the knowledge base and therefore improves teaching and practice of medicine. The pharmaceutical industry is the largest single contributor to post-graduate education in the UK.<P>


The NHS benefits from clinical research because patients in clinical research are investigated, treated and monitored at the expense of the research sponsor. However this relieves the NHS of the burden of expense, if not the burden of care, and large quantities of effective medicine are supplied at no cost to the NHS. In the race to shorten development times against the "patent clock", companies support numerous research registrars and research nurses. Research methodology within the NHS benefits from the rigorous standards necessary to satisfy regulatory authorities. <P>


Furthermore, the development of modern medicines produces savings for the NHS through reduced hospitalisation, critical care costs and sickness absence.<P>

<H3>4.3 For the Economy </H3> <P>

The R&D efforts of the UK pharmaceutical industry are not just valuable in terms of improving the health of the nation, they make a major contribution to the UK economy as well. With the value of UK pharmaceutical exports in 1994 at about &#163;4 billion and a pharmaceutical trade surplus of &#163;1.7 billion, the UK pharmaceutical industry is one of the UK's most successful industries. <P>


According to a recent study undertaken by the Office of Health Economics, under the auspices of the Joint Strategy Working Group, the pharmaceutical industry makes a significant net contribution to the wealth of the UK worth up to &#163;2 billion a year (7). The value is generated through the industry's competitive performance in the world pharmaceutical market. The benefits are derived from developing effective medicines for the NHS, earnings and profits, tax receipts, trade surplus and knowledge from R&D expenditures. <P>


In addition, the industry is responsible for employing about 70,000 people, with many more jobs being indirectly created in related areas.

        Select appropriate curriculum. Check out used curriculum

        Cathy Duffy's </strong><strong><u>Curriculum Manuals</u></strong><strong>

        <p><font color="#444444"><strong>Notify your school
        district in writing on or before July 1 of your intent to
        home educate during the upcoming school year which
        commences July 1 and concludes June 30 of the following.
        Your &quot;letter&quot; of intent should include the
        names and dates of birth of each child of legal school
        age who will be home educated. Children who turn six
        before December 1, are required to start school during
        that year. Teenagers who turn sixteen at any time during
        the school year are required to complete that entire
        year. <br>
        <br>
        Complete and submit one IHIP (Individualized Home
        Instruction Plan) for each child you will be educating at home.
        Your school district is supposed to respond to your
        letter of intent with a copy of the regulations and IHIP
        forms. Each IHIP must include a simple listing of the
        curriculum you will be using for each of the required
        subject areas. (see the </strong></font><a
        href="regs_n_legal.html"><font color="#444444"><strong>LEAH
        Regulatory Manual</strong></font></a><font
        color="#444444"><strong>). <br>
        <br>
        File quarterly reports with the school district at
        regular intervals you establish in you IHIP. <br>
        <br>
        Submit an annual evaluation to the local school district.
        Options include, written evaluations, standardized
        testing, and peer review panels. Standardized testing is
        only required every other year between the grades of 4
        and 8, and every year after that until the student is 16. Contact
        your local LEAH chapter for more information regarding
        these options. <br>
        <br>
        Home visits are not required! Nor are you required to
        meet with the superintendent to &quot;seek
        permission&quot;. A determination of compliance to the regulations
        is designed to be handled in writing between the local
        school district and a home educating family. If any of your
        written submissions are challenged, contact your local
        support group or your attorney at HSLDA to determine if
        any of your submissions are in error. (Be sure to join
        HSLDA before you begin!) If so, make all necessary
        corrections or additions and re-submit you documents. If
        all of your paper work is in compliance, follow the
        advice of HSLDA as how to proceed. Above all, keep a good testimony! <br>
        <br>
        Keep good records. You don't need to submit attendance
        records, but you need to report total number of hours in
        your quarterly reports. In the high school years, a good
        transcript is crucial for college admission. </strong></font></p>

authority for all faith and life. </strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#444444"><strong>2. That there is one God, eternally existent in three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. </strong></font></p>

and atoning death through His shed blood on the cross, His bodily resurrection, His ascension, and 
His imminent bodily return in power and glory. </strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#444444"><strong>4. That man was created in the image of God, but fell into sin and is therefore lost, and only those 
who put their faith in Jesus Christ alone, not trusting in any personal works whatsoever, can be 
saved. </strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#444444"><strong>5. That salvation is the free gift of God brought to the sinner by grace and received by personal faith 
in the Lord Jesus Christ, Whose substitutionary death on the cross paid the penalty for man's sin. </strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#444444"><strong>6. That the ministry of the Holy Spirit is to convict mankind; indwell, guide, instruct, and empower 
the believer for godly living and service. </strong></font></p>

individual doctrinal differences which may exist, outside of the aforementioned, should not hinder 
the unity of Christian home educators. </strong></font></p>

<pre>
   The purpose of this section is to establish procedures to		
   assist school authorities in fulfilling their responsibility		
   under Education Law sections 3204 (2) and 3210 (2) (d) and		
   in meeting their responsibility of determining the competency		
   of the instructor and substantial equivalence of instruction		
   being provided at home to students of compulsory attendance		
   age, and to assist parents who exercise their right to provide		
   required instruction at home to such students in fulfilling		
   their responsibilities under Education Law section 3212 (2).

<pre>
   (1) Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (2) and (3) of
       this subdivision, parents or other persons in parental 
       relation to a student of compulsory school attendance age
       shall annually provide written notice to the superintendent
       of schools of their school district of residence of their 
       intention to educate their child at home by July first of 
       each school year. The school year begins July 1 and ends 
       June 30 for all purposes within this section. In the case
       of the City School District of the City of New York, the 
       school district of residence for students who, if enrolled
       in the public schools, would attend elementary school, 
       intermediate school or junior high school in a community 
       school district shall be deemed to be in the community
       school district in which the parents reside.

   (2) Parents who determine to commence home instruction after 
       the start of the school year, or who establish residence 
       in the school district after the start of the school year,
       shall provide written notice of their intention to educate
       their child at home within 14 days following the commencement
       of home instruction within the school district.

<h4><a name="IHIP_PROCESS">(c) Procedures for development and review of an individualized home instruction plan (IHIP).</a> </h4>
<pre>
   (1) Within 10 business days of the receipt of the notice of 
       intention to instruct at home, the school district shall 
       send to the parents a copy of section 100.10 of the 
       Regulations of the Commissioner of Education and a form 
       on which to submit an IHIP for each child of compulsory 
       attendance age who is to be taught at home.

   (2) Within 4 weeks of the receipt of such materials, or by 
       August 15, the parent shall submit the completed IHIP form 
       for the school district. The district shall provide 
       assistance in preparation of the forms, if requested by 
       the parents.

   (3) Within 10 business days of receipt of the IHIP or by 
       August 31, the school district shall either notify the 
       parents that the IHIP complies with the requirements of 
       subdivisions (d) and (e) of this section or shall give 
       the parents written notice of any deficiency in the IHIP.

   (4) Within 15 days of receipt of a notice of a deficiency in 
       the IHIP or by September 15, the parents shall submit a 
       revised IHIP which corrects any such deficiencies.

   (5) The superintendent of schools shall review the revised IHIP 
       and shall notify the parents as to whether the revised IHIP 
       complies with subdivisions (d) and (e) of this section within 
       15 days of receipt of the revised IHIP or by September 30. 
       If the revised IHIP is determined not to be in compliance 
       with subdivisions (d) and (e) of this section, then the 
       parents shall be notified in writing of the reasons for 
       such determination. Such notice shall also contain the 
       date of the next regularly scheduled meeting of the board 
       of education that will be held at least 10 days after the 
       date of mailing of the notice, and shall indicate that if 
       the parents wish to contest the determination of non-
       compliance, the parents must so notify the board of 
       education at least 3 business days prior to the meeting. 
       At such board meeting, the parents shall have the right to 
       present proof of compliance, and the board of education shall 
       make a final determination of compliance or non-compliance.

   (6) The parents shall have the right to appeal any such final 
       school district determination of non-compliance to the 
       Commissioner of Education within 30 days after receipt of such 
       determination.

   (7) When administrative review of a school district determination
       of non-compliance is completed, the parents shall immediately 
       provide for the instruction of their children at a public 
       school or elsewhere in compliance with the Education Law 
       sections 3204 and 3210. For purposes of this subdivision, such
       administrative review shall be deemed to be completed when one
       of the following events have occurred;

       (i)   the parents have failed to contest a determination of
             non-compliance by appealing to the board of education; 
             or

       (ii)  the parents have failed to appeal a final school board 
             district determination of non-compliance to the 
             Commissioner of Education; or

       (iii) the parents have received a decision of the Commissioner 
             of Education which upholds a final school district 
             determination of non-compliance.  

   (8) Within 10 days after administrative review of the determination 
       of non-compliance is completed, the parents shall furnish the 
       superintendent of schools with written notice of the 
       arrangements they have made to provide their children with the
       required instruction, except that such notice shall not be 
       required if the parents enroll their children in a public
       school.

   referenced achievement test which meets the requirements of
   paragraph (1) of this subdivision or an alternative form of
   evaluation which meets the requirements of paragraph (2) of
   this subdivision.

   (1) <b>Commercially published norm-referenced achievement tests.</b> 

      (i)   The test shall be selected by the parents from one of 
            the following: the Iowa Test of Basic Skills, the 
            California Achievement Tests, the Stanford Achievement 
            Test, the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills, the 
            Metropolitan Achievement Test, A State Education 
            Department test, or another test approved by the State 
            Education Department.

      (ii)  The test shall be administered in accordance with one of 
            the following options to be selected by the parents:

            (a) at the public school, by its professional staff; or

            (b) at a registered non-public school, by its professional 
                staff, provided that the consent of the chief school 
                officer of the nonpublic school is obtained; or

            (c) at a non-registered non-public school, by its 
                professional staff, provided that the consent of 
                the superintendent of schools of the school 
                district and of the chief school officer of the 
                non-public school is obtained; or

            (d) at the parents' home or at any other reasonable 
                location, by a New York State certified teacher or 
                by another qualified person, provided that the 
                superintendent has consented to having said certified 
                teacher or other person administer the test.

       (iii) The test shall be scored by the persons administering 
             the test or by other persons who are mutually agreeable 
             to the parents and the superintendent of schools.

       (iv)  The test shall be provided by the school district upon 
             request by the parent, provided that the cost of any 
             testing facilities, transportation, and/or personnel 
             for testing conducted at a location other than the 
             public school shall be borne by the parent.

       (v)   If a score on a test is determined to be inadequate, 
             the program shall be placed on probation pursuant to 
             subdivision (i) of this section. A student's score 
             shall be deemed adequate if :

             (a) the student has a composite score above the 33 
                 percentile on national norms; or

             (b) the student's score reflects one academic year 
                 of growth as compared to a test administered 
                 during or subsequent to the prior school year.

   (2) <b>Alternative evaluation methods.</b> An alternative form of 
       evaluation shall be permitted to be chosen by the parent
       only as follows:

       (i)   for grades 1 through 3: a written narrative prepared 
             by a person specified in subparagraph (iii) of this 
             paragraph.

       (ii)  for grades 4 through 8: a written narrative prepared 
             by a person specified in subparagraph (iii) of this 
             paragraph. This alternative form of evaluation may 
             be used no more often than every other school year 
             for these grades.

       (iii) for the purposes of this paragraph, the person who 
             prepares the written narrative shall be a New York 
             State certified teacher, a home instruction peer 
             group review panel, or other person, who has 
             interviewed the child and reviewed a portfolio of 
             the child's work and who certifies that the child 
             has made adequate academic progress. The certified 
             teacher, peer review panel, or other person shall 
             be chosen by the parent with the consent of the 
             superintendent. Any resulting cost shall be borne 
             by the parent.

   (3) If a dispute arises between the parents over the 
       administration of the commercially published norm-
       referenced achievement test or the use of alternative 
       evaluation methods, the parents may appeal to the 
       board of education. If the parents disagree with the 
       determination of the board of education, the parents 
       may appeal to the Commissioner of Education within 30 
       days of receipt of the board's final determination.

<h4><a name="PROBATION">(j) Probation.</a></h4>
<p><br>
(1) If a child's annual assessment fails to comply with the <br>
requirements of subdivision (h) of this section, the <br>
home instruction program shall be placed on probation <br>
for a period of up to two (2) school years. The parents <br>
shall be required to submit a plan of remediation which <br>
addresses the deficiencies in the child's achievement, <br>
and seeks to remedy said deficiencies. The plan shall <br>
be reviewed by the school district. The school district<br>
may require the parents to make changes in the plan <br>
prior to acceptance.<br>
<br>
(2) If after the end of any semester of the probationary <br>
period the child progresses to the level specified in <br>
the remediation plan, then the home instruction program <br>
shall be removed from probation. If the child does not <br>
attain at least 75% of the objectives specified in the <br>
remediation plan at the end of any given semester within <br>
the period of probation, or if after two (2) years on <br>
probation 100% of the objectives of the remediation plan <br>
have not been satisfied, the superintendent of schools <br>
shall provide the parents with the notice specified in <br>
paragraph (5) of subdivision (c) of this section and the <br>
board of education shall review the determination of <br>
noncompliance in accordance with such paragraph, except <br>
that consent of the parents to such review shall not be <br>
required.<br>
<br>
(3) If during the period of probation the superintendent of <br>
schools has reasonable grounds to believe that the <br>
program of home instruction is in substantial <br>
noncompliance with these regulations the superintendent <br>
may require one or more home visits. Such home visit(s) <br>
shall be made only after three (3) days' written notice. <br>
The purpose of such visits(s) shall be to ascertain areas <br>
of noncompliance with these regulations and to determine <br>
methods of any such deficiencies. The home visit(s) shall <br>
be conducted by the superintendent or by the <br>
superintendent's designee. The superintendent may include <br>
members of a home instruction peer review panel in the <br>
home visit team.<br>

<h2 align=center><font color="#444444"><b>LEGISLATIVE ACTIVITY REPORT<br>
</b><em><b>by Paul Matte - </b></em><em>President, LEAH</em></font></h2>
<p align=center><font color="#444444"><em></em></font>&nbsp;</h2>
<h3><font color="#444444"><b>What Looms on the Horizon</b> </font></h3>
<p><font color="#444444"><strong>Both of the following items deal with the greater issue of who owns the children. We have yet 
to see a child come forth from any branch of government, however we are seeing provision 
for our own children's minds to be force-fed the current foolishness of the mental &quot;fad food&quot; 
of the day. </strong></font></p>
<h3><font color="#444444"><b>Yet Another Reform</b> </font></h3>
<p><font color="#444444"><strong>1. Grasping desperately for a mechanism to deal with the moral and academic devastation 
created by the removal of the knowledge of God from the minds of this generation; federal, 
state and local governments are struggling to bring, &quot;salvation,&quot; to their citizens. This 
planned deliverance is to come through the government's Child Protective &quot;Services,&quot; 
whose stated mission is: protecting the child's best interest, offering needed remediation, 
parent and vocational training classes, health services, family counseling, etc. . </strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#444444"><strong>We have found our salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ and long for the knowledge of 
the Lord to fill the earth. As citizens of heaven we wait patiently for the fulfillment of the 
promises found in the Word of God, but in the mean time we need to pray for one another 
daily and not let the cares of this life so easily upset us. We must daily cry out to the Lord for 
His strength and mercy to raise up a generation whose God is the Lord. </strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#444444"><strong>The times we are facing cause us to take inventory and ask the question, &quot;Were we to be 
arrested for being a Christian, would there be enough evidence to convict us?&quot; Let each of 
us show by our family testimony that the children that we have dedicated to the Lord are 
indeed, &quot;growing in wisdom and stature and favor with God and man&quot; That is God's 
definition of a world class citizen. </strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#444444"><strong>It is for this reason that we are closely watching the proposed application of the &quot;new&quot; 
Regents' testing to home learners and how it would impact the time proven method of 
learning the knowledge and wisdom of the Lord from godly parents. </strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#444444"><strong>The NYS Board of Regents and State Education Department are waiting for the new state 
wide standards and assessments to be in place before considering any changes to the 
existing regulations. We are concerned about the attempt to apply these guidelines to the 
private and home school community. Many of the &quot;new&quot; standards are simply a face lift of 
the New York Compact for Learning, America 2000 a.k.a. Outcome Based Education. A few 
states are abandoning these &quot;new&quot; methodologies as field testing is continuing to show that 
basic skills of reading, writing, speaking, and computation, as well as self discipline, are the 
essentials for productive citizenship. </strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#444444"><strong>As we were going to press we learned that language has been added to indicate that the new 
state wide standards and assessments apply &quot;to public schools only,&quot; which will prevent their 
application to home schooling. The State Education Department refers to home schooling as 
&quot;alternative education;&quot; the very meaning of &quot;alternative&quot; indicates that there is a 
significant difference from that to which the comparison is being made. The application of 
assembly line instruction to private and home school teaching is inappropriate at best and 
incompatible with the firmly held beliefs and convictions of parents who teach their children, 
&quot;by the Book,&quot; or even other values that the parent has determined to convey and leave as 
a legacy to the next generation. The essence of home learning, whether it is parent directed 
(commonly called home schooling) or child directed (commonly called unschooling) is that the 
parent, rather than the state, has determined the learning environment, teaching methods 
and general course of study (even unschooling parents must monitor the activities of their 
children). </strong></font></p>
<h3><font color="#444444">Remember RICO </font></h3>
<p><font color="#444444"><strong>and the misapplication of a law intended to eliminate organized crime? </strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#444444"><strong>2. Early February brought the first confirmation that we need to educate our governor and 
legislators on the impact of Social Services legislation upon home schooling. In that month 
they quickly and quietly moved legislation know as Elisa's law. Named after the child who 
was one of approximately twenty-five killed each year in NYC due to physical abuse. The 
loss of these children is truly a tragedy; however the hastily drawn solution is likely to 
produce great hardship and suffering as innocent, but suspect families are subjected to 
&quot;unreasonable searches and seizures&quot; by overzealous Social Service agents. </strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#444444"><strong>In all fairness we want to give our elected officials the benefit of the doubt. They are 
inundated with decisions to make which often is based upon what they believe to be reliable 
information, which is not always the case. This is why those concerned with maintaining 
freedom for families MUST get involved in observing the activities of the legislative bodies 
on the federal and state levels. The language of this statue creates a multi-lane expressway 
of intrusion, with no speed limits, into the lives of the citizens of New York. The milder parts 
allow immunity for &quot;good faith&quot; actions on the part of the agents and interagency sharing of 
information, including unfounded reports. Don't forget that a disgruntled neighbor, relative or 
child can make an anonymous call on the Toll Free Hotline to initiate an investigation. A 
perplexing portion of the law requires that even unfounded reports remain on the record (a 
record is created for each child) until TEN years after the youngest child mentioned in the 
report turns age eighteen. </strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#444444"><strong>This legislation was an illogical response to an emotional appeal against a highly publicized 
and hideous crime. Do our legislators think of brutality when they protect the doctors hired 
to eliminate the choice of life to the unborn and partially born who are killed at the rate of 
4100 per day in the United States, 290 of which are in New York? Is society truly concerned 
with protecting the life of ALL children? Something is radically wrong. </strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#444444"><strong>Society has abandoned the responsibilities delineated by the Creator, who is acknowledged 
in the majority of America's official and historical documents on both federal and state 
levels. Ultimately the state is authorized to protect life, and the authority of the parent is to 
nurture and admonish their children. The state should not abandon its own role, nor usurp 
that of the parents. </strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#444444"><strong>With 20/20 hindsight we have found that this legislation was developed in December 95 and 
introduced in both the Senate and the Assembly early in this legislative session. On February 
5th we learned that the bill had been passed in both the Senate by 56 votes out of 61 and in 
the Assembly with only 10 opposing votes out of 150. We contacted Duane Motley, who had 
been out of town at the time, to ask what had happened. He and I both thought this could be 
moderated and clarified before being signed into law by the Governor, until he found out that 
the Governor himself had initiated the legislation. Elisa's law has been signed by the 
Governor and will become law January 1, 1997. </strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#444444"><strong>Social Services is already working towards implementation of the bill. We have had one 
family reported to the DSS by medical technicians because of a safety concern in their home. 
This appears to be a routine investigation, but there is great confusion in the department of 
Social Services as to how to apply the 28 year portion of the law. </strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#444444"><strong>If you are concerned about this legislation, inform your chapter's legislative coordinator. 
Hearings may be held on the bill; as soon as we know, we will inform your chapter leaders. In 
the interim, Duane will be working with our legislative committee on clarification of the focus 
of this legislation. </strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#444444"><strong>The Council on National Policy has advised us that there are several legislators who tend to 
swing back and forth between liberal and conservative positions. This is one of the reasons 
that we need to know the legislative districts in which you reside. Much of the legislation on 
Federal and State level can be successfully blocked or passed if the astute constituents 
inform their legislators of their concerns. There are times when it is necessary to have a 
targeted alert to families of selected legislators. Armed with the information of who is in 
which district avoids having to alert every chapter. Being keenly aware that each family's 
time needs to be devoted to the raising of their children, we are continuing to develop 
strategies that will be effective without burdening anyone involved in the process. </strong></font></p>
<h3><font color="#444444"><b>Applied Civics</b> </font></h3>
<p><font color="#444444"><strong>LEAH attempts to be nonpartisan in our legislative update for home educators. We have 
found members from both parties introducing and supporting good and harmful legislation. 
Many laws are being introduced which affect, or have potential to affect private and home 
education and parental rights. Often, a deciding factor is whether individual home educators 
from a legislator's district have made positive, personal contact with him or her. Some 
constituents have established a very fruitful relationship by working on election campaigns. </strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#444444"><strong>As part of our LEAH Capitol Action Program we want to support those families and students 
who desire to exercise their freedoms to hold their elected officials accountable. LEAH will 
provide as much educational information as we can, so you can learn how to find and review 
pending legislation which will affect families (not just in education, but family court, labor, 
civil, health, social services, etc.), about the legislative process (opportunities within it when 
you as a citizen can make a difference) and other helpful resources. Albany / Adirondack 
Regional Reps, Bob &amp; Debbie Dufek are gathering a &quot;Hospitality&quot; list of volunteer host 
families in the Albany and surrounding areas. If you live within forty-five minutes of the 
Capitol and desire to exercise your gift of hospitality please contact the Dufeks. As hosts 
you would open your home to LEAH families and students coming to Albany to visit with 
their legislators or the State Education Department. </strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#444444"><strong>Now is the time for families to come to the aid of their state and nation. Working to elect or 
re-elect those who are &quot;in your camp&quot; is part of the solution for bringing this nation back to 
its rich heritage. Federal and state legislators need your assistance in their campaign 
headquarters. Call their district offices or your county board of elections to obtain the 
location of the campaign headquarters. Volunteer your time, one day per week, two hours 
per day, offer to sweep the floor, wash the windows, or stuff envelopes. Dress nicely, groom 
neatly, show up promptly, and be a great example of home schooling. Good impressions can 
lead to further involvement working for the legislator during the year. Journals of such 
activities can be incorporated as part of writing and civics studies. Pray about this matter; 
then, if so led, act quickly, as the campaigns are now gearing up for the fall. </strong></font></p>
<h3><font color="#444444"><b>Super Sleuths Needed</b> </font></h3>
<p><font color="#444444"><strong>Legislators desperately need the input from those knowledgeable about the legislation with 
which they are concerned. There are 15-17,000 bills introduced in Albany each year and it is 
impossible for your legislator to keep up with every one of them. This is why you need to be 
instructing your children in the ways that they can indeed impact what will soon be their 
responsibility to their country as they approach voting age. In the Washington D. C. area 
many homeschool families are making a difference in our nation as they meet with and 
articulate their concerns to their Federal legislators. We have had response from some of the 
families in the past and are now developing ways in which we can provide the information and 
instruction for you to have effective interface with your elected officials. This is a tall order 
and will require a pooling of our knowledge and experience. If your family is currently 
watching legislation or interested in learning what you can do to help review proposed laws, 
please send your comments and questions to Paul S. Matte, LEAH Legislative Liaison, 6628 
Woodruff Road, Lima, NY 14485. </strong></font></p>
<h3><font color="#444444"><b>Update on the Local Items:</b> </font></h3>
<p><font color="#444444"><strong>The P.A.S.S. Test from the Hewitt Foundation has been approved by the State Education 
Department as an alternative method of evaluation. Margaret Lynch-Brennan (SED) sent an 
official letter out stating that the Hewitt PASS test was now &quot;...another test approved by the 
State Education Department.&quot; Yet some school districts were telling home schoolers PASS 
was not listed in the regulations. Your chapter will receive a copy of this letter in the next 
</strong><strong><i>Chapter Communications </i></strong><strong>mailing coming out this month. We want to thank Dan &amp; Elyse 
Durkee (LEAH's Rochester / Finger Lakes LEAH Regional Rep) for following up and 
researching this for us. Elyse found that she had to go past the SED secretary and speak 
directly with Peg Lynch-Brennan and request some written verification to clear up this 
misunderstanding. </strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#444444"><strong>Dee Black, HSLDA's lawyer assigned to New York members, said that they have received 
recent calls on two issues: end of the year assessments, parents doing the testing, and a few 
districts saying home school students had to participate in state testing. Dee wrote letters 
referring local school officials back to the written regulations (Sections h. (1)(ii)(d), (iii); h. 
(2)(iii); (3) of CR 100.10 on Home Instruction). To date, no superintendent has responded 
back to HSLDA or its members. </strong></font></p>

<h1>Loving Education At Home</h1>
<h3>Serving home educators in New York State . . .</h3>
<p><em>Loving Education At Home, Inc. is an organization of like-minded Christian home educators, dedicated to observing organization of like-minded 
Christian home educators, dedicated to observing the biblical commands of Deuteronomy 6:4-9, Proverbs 22:6 and Ephesians 6:4. LEAH began in 
1983 with five Christian families seeking support and fellowship. It grew into a statewide not-for-profit ministry providing support through a 
network of local chapters.</em></p>
<p><em>A board of directors is comprised of 11 elected volunteer positions; President,Vice President, Secretary,Treasurer, and seven Regional 
Representatives. </em></p>
<h3>SUPPORT </h3>
<p>The network of 121 local <a href="support_txt.html">LEAH chapters</a> currently serves over 2800 families. Your local chapter is the best place to go for help with getting started. </p>
<h3>REGULATORY &amp; LEGISLATIVE </h3>
<p>LEAH serves as a watch dog to protect your right to home educate in New York State. This includes: working with <a href="hslda_txt.html">HSLDA</a> to monitor federal and state bills 
or regulations that would impact home education; serving on the Home Instruction Advisory Group (HIAG) committee to the State Education Department. 
And, LEAH maintains a <a href="regs_n_legal_txt.html">Regulatory Manual</a> that details and explains the home education regulations in New York State. </p>
<h3>EDUCATION </h3>
<p>Chapter leaders meetings with workshops for leadership training and an annual convention are just two of the ways LEAH works to help educate home 
educators. </p>
<h3>INFORMATION </h3>
<p>A quarterly newsletter (<a href="hsr_txt.html">The Home School Report</a>), two page insert in <a href="magazines_txt.html#TEACHOME">The Teaching Home</a> magazine, chapter leader mailings, and fax updates keep open lines 
of communication for urgent legislative and regulatory issues, encouragement, and home education news, information, and resources</p>

<h4>PREPARE, PREPARE, PREPARE! </h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Talk to other home educators and read all of the home
    education materials you can, especially those that talk about
    educational approaches. Borrow books from friends, the public
    library, or a local support group's lending library. View
    LEAH's <a href="hs_in_action_txt.html">Homeschooling in
    Action</a> video which introduces home education by profiling the
    experiences and educational philosophies of three families.</p>
    <p>Have a &quot;plan&quot; for your school year. What
    subjects do you need to teach? Be sure to include physical, spiritual,
    academic, and social development as you make your plans. (see <a
    href="scripture_txt.html">Luke 2:52</a>) </p>
    <p>Subscribe to at least one good home education publication,
    such as <a href="magazines_txt.html#TEACHOME">The Teaching Home</a>
    magazine. </p>
    <p>Select appropriate curriculum. Check out used curriculum
    if you know what you are specifically looking for. More
    expensive or more widely advertised is not necessarily better.
    Cathy Duffy's Curriculum Manuals are especially helpful. Only buy
    what you need for the current year, and don't be tempted by
    &quot;extras&quot; if you can't afford them. If you don't
    have all your curriculum by the July 1st &quot;letter of intent&quot;
    deadline, at least have all your orders placed. </p>
    <p>Know the law! Purchase LEAH's <a
    href="regs_n_legal_txt.html">Regulatory Manual</a> which
    provides a thorough explanation of <a href="..\nysregs.html">Commissioner
    Regulations 100.10</a>. These regulations govern home education
    in NYS. </p>
</blockquote>

<h4>GET CONNECTED! </h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Join the <a href="hslda_txt.html">Home School Legal
    Defense Association</a> (Preferably before you contact your
    school district). Annual membership fee is $100 unless you
    are a member of LEAH. Members receive a discounted HSLDA membership
    fee of $85.</p>
    <p>Join LEAH through a local <a href="support_txt">support
    group</a>. Membership includes a quarterly newsletter; $15
    discount on HSLDA's annual membership fee; legislative
    updates &amp; action alerts; annual convention discounts, and
    more. Families educating children with <a
    href="special_txt.html">special needs</a> are encouraged to
    also join <a href="http://www.oswego.edu/picc.html">Parents
    Instructing Challenged Children</a> for support. </p>
</blockquote>

<h4>KNOW THE REGS! </h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Notify your school district in writing on or before July 1
    of your intent to home educate during the upcoming school
    year which commences July 1 and concludes June 30 of the
    following. Your &quot;letter&quot; of intent should include
    the names and dates of birth of each child of legal school
    age who will be home educated. Children who turn six before
    December 1, are required to start school during that year. Teenagers who
    turn sixteen at any time during the school year are required
    to complete that entire year. </p>
    <p>Complete and submit one IHIP (Individualized Home
    Instruction Plan) for each child you will be educating at home.
    Your school district is supposed to respond to your letter of
    intent with a copy of the regulations and IHIP forms. Each
    IHIP must include a simple listing of the curriculum you will
    be using for each of the required subject areas. (see the <a
    href="regs_n_legal_txt.html">LEAH Regulatory Manual</a>). </p>
    <p>File quarterly reports with the school district at regular
    intervals you establish in you IHIP. </p>
    <p>Submit an annual evaluation to the local school district.
    Options include, written evaluations, standardized testing,
    and peer review panels. Standardized testing is only required
    every other year between the grades of 4 and 8, and every
    year after that until the student is 16. Contact your local
    LEAH chapter for more information regarding these options. </p>
    <p>Home visits are not required! Nor are you required to meet
    with the superintendent to &quot;seek permission&quot;. A determination
    of compliance to the regulations is designed to be handled in
    writing between the local school district and a home
    educating family. If any of your written submissions are
    challenged, contact your local support group or your attorney
    at HSLDA to determine if any of your submissions are in
    error. (Be sure to join HSLDA before you begin!) If so, make
    all necessary corrections or additions and re-submit you documents.
    If all of your paper work is in compliance, follow the advice
    of HSLDA as how to proceed. Above all, keep a good testimony! </p>
    <p>Keep good records. You don't need to submit attendance
    records, but you need to report total number of hours in your
    quarterly reports. In the high school years, a good
    transcript is crucial for college admission. </p>

<p>Regulation of home education in New York State falls under the
jurisdiction of the State Education Department, the Commissioner
of Education, and the Board of Regents. In 1988 the Commissioner's
Regulations were amended with section ß100.10 after a series of
court battles contesting the legality of home education. These
regulations are a compromise at best, but have been beneficial in
keeping legitimate home educating parents out of court.</p>

<p><em><strong>Loving Education At Home is a Christian organization, the members of which are likeminded Christian home education support groups made 
up of families dedicated to observing the Biblical commands of Deuteronomy 6:4-10, Proverbs 22:6, and Ephesians 6:4</strong></em>. </p>
<p><em><strong>We promote home education as the Scriptural design for education whereas institutional education is alternative to the home. </strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>We believe that every family has the God-given legal and constitutional right to home educate in New York State, regardless of their 
philosophy of education or religious affiliation.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>L.E.A.H. is not a church nor is this organization meant to replace the ministry of the local church to the home education family</strong></em><strong>.</strong> </p>
<h3>PURPOSE </h3>
<p><strong>Loving Education At Home is organized exclusively for the purpose of providing service and support to Christian home education support 
groups within New York State including but not limited to the following ways: </strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>1. By aiding in the creation and growth of Christian home education support groups through out New York State. </strong></p>
<p><strong>2. By providing information regarding the legal climate of home education in New York State and in our nation. </strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>2.1 By encouraging home education families to seek appropriate legal counsel. </strong></p>
<p><strong>2.2 By monitoring and advising the State Department of Education and other appropriate officials. </strong></p>
<p><strong>2.3 By monitoring cases before family, state, and federal courts in this regard. </strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>3. By doing whatever is necessary to protect the future freedoms of home education in New York State and in our nation. </strong></p>
<p><strong>4. By promoting the advantages of home education over alternative forms of education outside the home. </strong></p>
<p><strong>5. By promoting sound, highquality home education programs by parents or legal guardians for the purpose of developing 
Christlike character, and which will satisfy the spiritual, intellectual, physical, and emotional growth needs of their children. </strong></p>
<p><strong>6. By reviewing and disseminating home education materials and information considered vital to home educators, this serving as 
a resource to parents desiring to educate their children in the home. </strong></p>
<p><strong>7. By publishing a state newsletter. </strong></p>
<p><strong>8. By planning and conducting an annual state home education convention and other educational opportunities designed to 
provide information and training that will help parents and others involved with or interested in home education. </strong></p>
<p><strong>9. By supporting accurate home education research and its publication. </strong></p>
<p><strong>10. By instituting whatever other programs or services in the future as may be deemed necessary by the membership of this 
organization.</strong> </p>

<h3><strong>We believe: </strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>1. The Bible to be the inspired, infallible, divinely preserved Word of God, the supreme and final authority for all faith and life. </strong></p>
<p><strong>2. That there is one God, eternally existent in three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. </strong></p>
<p><strong>3. In the deity of our Lord Jesus Christ, His virgin birth, His sinless life, His miracles, His vicarious and atoning death through 
His shed blood on the cross, His bodily resurrection, His ascension, and His imminent bodily return in power and glory. </strong></p>
<p><strong>4. That man was created in the image of God, but fell into sin and is therefore lost, and only those who put their faith in Jesus 
Christ alone, not trusting in any personal works whatsoever, can be saved. </strong></p>
<p><strong>5. That salvation is the free gift of God brought to the sinner by grace and received by personal faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, 
Whose substitutionary death on the cross paid the penalty for man's sin. </strong></p>
<p><strong>6. That the ministry of the Holy Spirit is to convict mankind; indwell, guide, instruct, and empower the believer for godly living 
and service. </strong></p>
<p><strong>7. In the spiritual unity of believers through our common faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, and that individual doctrinal differences 
which may exist, outside of the aforementioned, should not hinder the unity of Christian home educators. </strong></p>

<title>UN Convention on the Rights of the Child</title>
</head>

<body>

<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman"><i>September 1995<br>
</i></font><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><i></i></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="5"><b>THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION<br>
ON THE RIGHTS OF THE CHILD</b></font><font size="4"
face="Times New Roman"><b><br>
</b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"><b>America
Prepares for <br>
the Parental Rights Battle of the Decade</b></font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">After years
of debate within the international community between politicians
and child's rights activists, an agreement was finally reached in
1988, which for the first time created a comprehensive charter
advancing the agenda of the children's &quot;liberation&quot;
movement. What the child's rights advocates have for over two
decades been unable to accomplish through the normal legislative
process may now be realized in one sweeping blow, should the
Clinton Administration push the Senate to ratify the <i>United
Nations Convention on the Rights of The Child</i>. Under the
guise of a &quot;child's rights&quot; measure, this wolf in sheep's clothing
could, if passed, substantially undermine the authority of
parents to exercise vitally important responsibilities toward
their children if these responsibilities infringe on the child's
&quot;right&quot; to autonomy and self-expression as defined by a panel
of &quot;experts&quot; appointed by the United Nations. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">If
ratified, this treaty could undermine the family by granting to
children a list of radical &quot;rights&quot; which would be
primarily enforced against the parents. These new
&quot;fundamental&quot; rights would include &quot;the right to
privacy,&quot; &quot;the right to freedom of thought and
association,&quot; and the right to &quot;freedom of
expression.&quot; A fundamental presumption of the treaty is that
parental responsibility exists only in so far as parents are
willing to further the independent choices of the child.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"><b>The </b><b><i>Convention</i></b><b>
Would<br>
</b>Redefine Family Law in America</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The impact
of the <i>Convention</i> is particularly ominous in light of the
fact that the United States Constitution declares treaties to be
the law of the land. Under the Constitution's Supremacy Clause of
Article VI &quot;all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under
the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of
the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby,
any Thing in the Constitution of Laws of any State to the
Contrary notwithstanding.&quot; </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">In <i>Missouri</i>
v. <i>Holland</i> the Supreme Court held that a treaty made by
the President with the required concurrence of two-thirds of the
Senate is, under the Supremacy Clause of Article VI, section 2,
part of the supreme law which takes precedent over contrary state
laws. Thus, the <i>U.N. Convention</i> would constitute legally
binding law in all 50 states. Otherwise valid state laws pertaining
to education, the family, etc., which conflict with the
provisions of the treaty will be subject to invalidation. Were
this convention to be enforced, the United States would be
required to alter large portions of long established law to cater
to the demands of the United Nations, and the panel of experts
they select to define international standards for child's rights.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4"><b>The </b><b><i>Convention</i></b><b>
Would Give Children the &quot;Right&quot; to Disregard Parental
Authority</b></font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Although
several of the treaty's provisions offer generally positive,
nonoffensive platitudes, a substantial portion of this charter undermines
parental rights. The <i>U.N. Convention</i> would: [1] transfer
parental rights and responsibilities to the State; [2] undermine
the family by vesting children with various fundamental rights
which advance notions of the child's autonomy and freedom from
parental guidance; and [3] establish bureaucracies and
institutions of a national and international nature designed to
promote &quot;the ideas proclaimed in the Charter of the United
Nations&quot; and to investigate and prosecute parents who
violate their children's rights. Some of the more relevant
provisions of the <i>United Nations Convention on the Rights of
the Child </i>are summarized below:</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"><b>THE
STATE WILL<br>
DETERMINE CHILD'S &quot;BEST INTEREST&quot;</b></font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>Article
3: </b>&quot;In all actions concerning children,&quot; the
courts, social service workers and bureaucrats are empowered to
regulate families based on their subjective determination of
&quot;the best interest of the child.&quot; This article shifts
the responsibility of parental judgment and decision making from
the family to the State (and ultimately the United Nations).<br>
</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"><b>THE
PROVISIONS OF THE TREATY<br>
MUST BE ENFORCED</b></font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>Article
4:</b> This provision makes clear that the treaty is not just a
positive affirmation. Signatory nations are bound to &quot;undertake
all appropriate legislative, administrative, and other measures,
for the implementation of the rights&quot; articulated in the <i>Convention</i>.
In fact, the United States would be required to &quot;undertake
measures to the maximum extent of available resources . . .
within the framework of international co-operation&quot; in order
to restructure society in accordance with the implementation of
these rights</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"><b>ALL
CHILDREN MUST BE REGISTERED</b></font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>Article
7:</b> In order to insure State and U.N. control over their
development, all children must be immediately registered after birth.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"><b>SEVERE
LIMITATIONS ARE PLACED<br>
ON THE PARENTS' RIGHT<br>
TO DIRECT AND TRAIN THEIR CHILDREN</b></font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>Article
13:</b> Under this provision, parents could be subject to
prosecution for any attempt to prevent their children from interacting
with material they deemed unacceptable. Children are vested with
a &quot;freedom of expression&quot; right which is virtually absolute.
No allowance is made for parental guidance. Section 1 declares a
child's right to &quot;seek, receive and impart information and
ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in
writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other
media of the child's choice.&quot;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>Article
14:</b> Children are guaranteed &quot;freedom of thought,
conscience and religion.&quot; Children have a legal right to
object to all religious training. Alternatively, children may
assert their right against parental objection to participate in
occult, Muslim or Buddhist worship services.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>Article
15</b>: This article declares &quot;the right of the child to
freedom of association.&quot; If this measure were to be taken
seriously, parents could be prevented from forbidding their child
to associate with people deemed to be objectionable companions. Under
Article 15, children could claim a &quot;fundamental&quot; right
to join gangs, cults, and racist organizations over parental objection.
Parental rights and responsibilities are unmentioned. </font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"><b>THE </b><b><i>CONVENTION</i></b><b>
WOULD<br>
</b>FURTHER ENTRENCH THE RIGHT<br>
OF TEENAGERS TO ABORT THEIR BABIES</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><strong>Article 16:</strong></font><font
size="3" face="Times New Roman"> The &quot;right to privacy&quot;
is granted to children under Article 16. Although the United
States Constitution nowhere grants a woman the right to abort her
baby, &quot;privacy&quot; was the operative word used by the
Court in <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i> to create the right to
abortion. This United Nations-sanctioned &quot;privacy&quot; would
seemingly establish as &quot;the law of the land&quot; the
child's right to obtain an abortion without parental notice, the
right to purchase and use contraceptives, the right to
heterosexual and homosexual promiscuity, and the right to
pornography in the home. </font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"><b>THE
STATE MUST ASSIST<br>
PARENTS IN THE RAISING OF CHILDREN</b></font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>Article
18:</b> This provision not only encourages two-income families by
granting children a fundamental right to state-subsidized,
state-run child care facilities, but it calls on the State to be
co-parent by rendering &quot;<i>appropriate assistance to parents
and legal guardians in the performance of their child-rearing responsibilities
and shall ensure the development of institutions, facilities and
services for the care of children</i>.&quot; </font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"><b>PARENTS
WHO DON'T<br>
COMPLY MAY BE PROSECUTED</b></font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>Article
19:</b> This provision mandates the creation of an intensive
bureaucracy for the purpose of &quot;identification, reporting, referral,
investigation, treatment, and follow-up&quot; of parents who, in
violation of the child's &quot;rights,&quot; treat their children negligently.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"><b>A
PROHIBITION ON CORPORAL PUNISHMENT?</b></font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>Article
28:</b> Education is declared a &quot;right&quot; which is not
only to be universally free, but compulsory. This section would
require that the United States pass laws and develop an
infrastructure geared toward &quot;encouraging&quot; all
school-age Americans to be part of the school system. The nations
of the world are challenged to unite in the creation of an
internationalist approach to education. Finally, parties to the <i>Convention</i>
must ensure that school discipline &quot;is administered in a
manner consistent with the child's human dignity&quot; as defined
by the United Nations. Presumably this would prohibit corporal
punishment.</font></p>

to Action</b></font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Baskerville Old Face">During
the 103rd Congress, both houses of Congress introduced
resolutions requesting that the President sign the treaty. Due in
part to the pressure generated from hundreds of thousands of
letters and phone calls in opposition to the treaty, the
President never formally signed the document. After the landslide
Republican victory in November of 1994, many parents stopped
writing and calling their senators. No sooner had the phone calls
and letters dissipated then Hillary Clinton announced to the
world that the treaty would be signed and submitted to the
Senate. On February 16, 1995, President Clinton's Ambassador to
the United Nations signed the treaty in preparation for sending
it to the Senate for ratification. For the treaty to become the
&quot;supreme law of the land,&quot; two-thirds of the Senate
must ratify it. This means over one-third (34 U.S. senators) can
block it.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Baskerville Old Face">As a
result of a new wave of phone calls and letters in February 1995,
32 U.S. senators now publicly and in writing are on record as
opposing the treaty! Furthermore, Senators Lott and Helms have
introduced Senate Resolution 133 to specifically condemn the<i>
U.N. Convention On the Rights of the Child</i> and ask Clinton
not to send it to the Senate for ratification. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Baskerville Old Face">Voice
your opposition to the treaty by contacting your U.S. Senators
and asking them to sign number is (202) D.C. 20510.S.R. 133 in
order to protect your parental rights. The Capitol Switchboard

<p align="center"><font size="4"><b>OPPOSE THE UNITED NATIONS
CONVENTION </b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4"><b>ON THE ELIMINATION OF ALL
FORMS </b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4"><b>OF DISCRIMINATION AGAINST
WOMEN</b></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Wingdings"><b>®</b></font><b> THE
TREATY OBLIGATES THE UNITED STATES TO ENACT LEGISLATION WHICH
AFFECTS PRIVATE AND HOME SCHOOLS:</b></p>

<p><font size="3">Article 10 of the Convention requires all
signatory countries to make legislation for &quot;all forms of
education.&quot; The treaty makes no distinctions between
private, public and home education. Both the specific provisions
and the broad policy implications of the treaty could apply to
non-public education.</font></p>

<p><font face="Wingdings"><b>®</b></font><b> THE TREATY MANDATES
CENSORSHIP, CONTENT CONTROL OF CURRICULUM AND REVISION OF TEXTBOOKS:</b> </p>

<p><font size="3">The Convention imposes curriculum mandates and
textbook revision for the purpose of eliminating &quot;sexual
stereotypes&quot; on all forms of education. Article 10 reads:
&quot;State Parties shall take all appropriate measures
[toward]....(c) The elimination of any stereotyped concept of the
roles of men and women at all levels and in all forms of
education by encouraging coeducation and other types of education
which will help to achieve this aim and, in particular, by the
revision of textbooks and school programs and the adaptation of
teaching methods.&quot; This gives heretofore unthinkable content
control over our education not only to state and federal
governments, but ultimately to the United Nations. </font></p>

<p><font face="Wingdings"><b>®</b></font><b> THE TREATY VIOLATES
THE CIVIL LIBERTIES OF THE INDIVIDUAL AND THE FAMILY BY DICTATING
&quot;POLITICAL CORRECTNESS&quot; AND PROMOTING CENSORSHIP:</b></p>

<p><font size="3">The Convention attempts to break down natural
jurisdictional distinctions between the individual, the family
and the state. For example, motherhood is defined as a
&quot;social function&quot; and the convention would require the
United States to enact &quot;legislation to modify or abolish,
existing customs and practices&quot; (Art 2, sec (f)) which
reinforce traditional family roles, but are perceived by a United
Nations controlled panel of &quot;experts&quot; to be
discriminatory. The preamble to the <i>Convention</i> asserts
that &quot;the traditional role of men&quot; must be stamped out.
Moreover, the &quot;textbook revision&quot; passages of Article
10 raise significant First Amendment concerns by giving the
government a license to purge the American public of unapproved
ideas regarding male/female relationships and to censor textbooks
which promote politically incorrect views of the family.</font><font
size="4"> </font></p>

<p><font face="Wingdings"><b>®</b></font><b> THE TREATY ALLOWS
IMPORTANT QUESTIONS OF AMERICAN DOMESTIC POLICY TO BE DECIDED BY
A U.N. PANEL RATHER THAN BY AMERICANS AND THEIR ELECTED
OFFICIALS:</b></p>

<p><font size="3">The United Nations gains substantive
jurisdiction over the lives and freedoms of American families.
The treaty would mandate laws which invade the sanctity of the
home and discriminate against the traditional family. Article 16
of the <i>Convention</i> states: &quot;State parties shall take
all appropriate measures to eliminate discrimination against
women in all matters relating to marriage and family
relations.&quot; Article 2 of the <i>Convention</i> includes the
following language: &quot;State Parties...agree to pursue by all appropriate means
and without delay...take all appropriate measures to eliminate
discrimination against women by any person, organization or
enterprise. Sections (b), (c), (d) and (f) of Article 2 would
require women to be drafted and serve in combat roles. Section (e)
could be used as the basis for attacking churches and religious
organizations which place men in leadership positions. Article 17
calls for the creation of a &quot;United Nations Committee on the
Elimination of Discrimination Against Women&quot; made up of &quot;experts&quot;
to police the policies of the signatory nations and make sure the provisions
of the <i>Convention</i> are being implemented. </font></p>

<p><font face="Wingdings"><b>®</b></font><b> RATIFICATION OF
THIS TREATY SUBVERTS THE CONSTITUTIONAL LEGISLATIVE PROCESS FOR DOMESTIC
POLICY: </b></p>

<p><font size="3">This treaty effectively amends our Constitution
without requiring the ratification by three-fourths of the
states. If ratified this treaty would become the supreme law of
the land. Article Six, Section two of the Constitution reads:
&quot;This Constitution...and all treaties made...shall be the
supreme law of the land; and the judges in every state shall be
bound thereby, anything in the constitution or laws of any state
notwithstanding.&quot; Treaties were never intended to govern our internal
policies, but simply to govern the relations between nations. The
implications of the treaty are more far-reaching than would have
been those of the discredited Equal Rights Amendment, and it
totally evades the proper process of amending the Constitution,
yet has the same force and effect.</font></p>

<p><font face="Wingdings"><b>®</b></font><b> RESERVATIONS,
DECLARATIONS AND UNDERSTANDINGS DO NOT SAFEGUARD AMERICAN FAMILY
INTERESTS: </b></p>

<p><font size="3">The State Department Memorandum attached to the
treaty suggests that a Senate-passed reservation will protect
Americans from the dangerous consequences of the treaty. Some
have suggested that the Convention is not the &quot;supreme law
of the land&quot; as stated by Article 6, Section 2 of the United States
Constitution, and that the &quot;declarations, reservations, and understandings&quot; to
be attached to the treaty will prevent the treaty from preempting
United States law. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">However, according to the terms of the <i>Convention</i>
the United Nations will oversee which declarations, reservations
and understandings shall be permitted. Article 28, Section Two of
the <i>Convention</i> makes it clear that any &quot;reservation incompatible with
the object and purpose of the present convention shall not be
permitted.&quot; In other words, if the United Nations committee overseeing
the <i>Convention</i> does not like our reservations, it can
reject them. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">More importantly, the Constitution is clear
that if a treaty is properly ratified, it becomes the supreme law
of the land. The United States Congress can certainly pass a
non-binding resolution through the normal legislative process
which advances a public policy directive. But the Framers of the
Constitution never intended the Senate treaty ratification
process to be used for the purpose of adopting non-binding
multinational humanitarian statements. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">At best it is unclear whether or not the treaty
is self-executing. What is clear is that the treaty calls for all
signatory nations to take &quot;appropriate measures.&quot; Regardless
of whether or not the treaty is deemed to be self-executing, many
courts will look to the <i>Convention</i> not only for specific
rules, but as a broad statement of public policy.</font><font
size="4"> </font></p>

<p><font size="3">No amount of declarations, reservations or
understandings can reform the <i>Convention On the Elimination Of
All Forms Of Discrimination Against Women</i>. The treaty is
laced with questionable policy objectives. American freedoms
should not hinge on the interpretations of legal technicalities
found in &quot;reservations&quot; attached to the treaty and
subject to U.N. approval. Why should the United States Senate try
to reform a document whose very premise is fatally flawed? Why
should we allow an international organization like the United
Nations to have any say in American public policy? </font></p>

<h3>Home School Legal Defense Association </h3>
<p>was established in 1983 as a means to provide low-cost, high quality legal defense to a large (and rapidly growing) number of home educators. HSLDA takes 
its committment to home education seriously. Their attorneys are all parents who have, are, or will home educate their <em>own</em> children. </p>
<p>For $100 per year ($85 for LEAH members), HSLDA will represent you with legal counsel for any problems you encounter regarding your right to home 
educate your children. Also provided is Court Report, a bi-monthly newsletter with information on the current legal issues in each state. Request an application 
from: HSLDA, Paeonian Springs, VA 22129. </p>
<p>In addition to this legal defense service, HSLDA and the National Center for Home Education (NCHE) have closely tracked and worked to influence 
legislation of concern to home educators. HSLDA has worked with state home education organizations to draft legislation and regulations favorable to home 
education. </p>

Downstairs, Granville is an urbane eatery with its deep hued woodsand oxblood leather upholstered seats in a (gasp!) non-smoking setting. Upstairs, Granville is all that and then some, as the stogies come outand the smoke-eaters kick into high-gear.  Start your evening with a mouth-wateringcocktail menu, we like to settle in with a Smoke Martini - Bombay Sapphiregin kissed with Laphroaig Single Malt Scotch instead of vermouth - or aginger-mint julep.  	The eclectic Pacific Rim cum New French menu meticulouslyprepared by chef Chote Tongchareon offers sassy appetizers such as searedfois gras with grilled papaya demi-glac&eacute; or phesant terrine withsealed greens and cornichons.  If you're in for dinner, the grilled buffalotenderloin with mushroom and shallot ragout is a must.  	Individual humidorsare available if Granville becomes your regular haunt, offering space for100 of your most prized smokes.  	Granville Restaurant &amp; Bar is locatedat 40 East 20th Street (between Park &amp; Broadway) in NYC.  Call (212)253-9088 for reservations.<BR><BR><HR WIDTH="69%"></FONT><FONT size=5><B>HEARD THROUGH THE GRAPEVINE</B></FONT><FONT size=3><BR>	If you haven't been living in a cave at the bottom of a lake in Mongoliafor the last three years, you'd know that the cigar boom has gone atomic. Though the explosion has knocked more than a few old favorites off theshelves, the blast has made room for a new wave of manufacturers offeringdynamite sticks for discriminating palates to savor.  	Entering the frayin mid- to late November is the Napa Cigar Co. with a fine Nicaraguan blend.Oenophiles take note, Napa Cigar Co. is run by Robert M. Mondavi Jr., scion of the same Mondavi family that put Napa vineyards on the map.  Directinghis palate toward tobacco, Robert Jr. has created a special blend to highlightthe prevailing essence of the region offering five sizes:  robusto, toro,corona, gran corona and churchill.  Later, Napa will release lines fromthe Dominican Republic and the Canary Islands.<BR>	<BR><HR WIDTH="69%"></FONT><FONT size=5><B>PRETTY AS A PICTURE</B></FONT><FONT size=3><BR><BR><IMG SRC="images/cigarposter.gif" WIDTH="250" HEIGHT="204" ALIGN="MIDDLE" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR>If you remember the shot of Michael Dukkakis sitting in a tank taken duringthe 1992 Democratic primary campaign, you may remember Michael Samojeden.He shot that photo, which was referred to by political pundits as the mostpivotal shot of the entire race for the '92 Democratic campaign. Now, ourfavorite lensman has turned his camera towards his humidor for a mouthwateringlook at our favorite Havanas. The limited run of 1000 prints can be ordereddirect from Cigar Essentials (519) 473-7905.

Then, ofcourse, you've never met Mr. Smoke, the ambassador of stogie-dom. Mr. Smoke,the brainchild of Joe Babick president of the Big Brown Public Toy Co.,was born to promote America's rekindled love-affair with the cigar, andtends to cause a ruckus where ever he shows up. &quot;Public response hasbeen overwhelming,&quot; says Babick (who incidentally is a former MisterUSA All-Natural bodybuilding champion). &quot;Everybody seems to love him,but alot of people have trouble summoning up the courage to speak to a seven-footcigar.&quot; Look for surprise cameo appearances by this ultra-gigante everywhere:talk shows, sporting events, cigar smokers and anywhere else TV camerasare rolling. Babick has also created a smaller version of the the big guyfor sale at smokeshops nationwide. Both Jr. and Sr. feature a Colorado wrapperwith a long, soft foam filler and a ring gauge with attitude.

<font size=4>If you've got a sense of humor and a love of fine cigars, you've come to the right place. Here are a couple of cigar cartoons we've picked up here and there. Look to this page for more Smoke Jokes coming soon. If you know a great cigar joke, <A HREF="mailto:cigarwear@aol.com">e-mail it to us!</A><br><br></font>
<BR>

This joke was sent in to us from dkimba00@colybrand.com. Thanks for the joke,
Drew...keep them coming!<P>

A middle aged man comes into a cigar bar, orders a drink, and sits near 
the back of the bar.  He then takes out three different cigars, cuts one, 
then the other, and then the third.  Then he lights them.  First one, 
then the next, and finally the third.  The bartender and the patrons 
watch as the man picks up each cigar, takes a puff, then moves to the 
next cigar.<P>

About halfway through, the man leaves all three cigars at the table, and 
comes to the bar for another drink.  The bartender says, "Ya know, those 
cigars will be much more enjoyable if you smoke one at a time.  That way, 
you can taste the flavors of each individually instead of mixing them all 
together."<P>

The man responds, "Well, my two brothers and I just moved from Cuba to 
different cities in the United States.  We had been smoking a cigar 
together every day since we were kids, and we promised each other we'd 
smoke in this manner, so that we'd never forget the times we've had and 
the love we share."<P>

The bartender and the other patrons recognized the sense in this, and the 
man, returning to the same cigar bar every evening, soon became a 
regular, and his 3-cigar smoking method became well known.<P>

About 6 years later, the man comes in, and pulls out two cigars, cuts and 
lights them.  A hush falls over the room, and when the man comes to the 
bar halfway through his smokes for another drink, the bartender says, "I 
have no way to adequately express my sorrow.  Please, take this one on 
the house."<P>

The man thanks the bartender, and looks up to see the sadness mirrored in 
the faces of the regulars.  He thinks a minute, quickly smiles, and says, 
"Oh, my brothers are fine.  I've just quit smoking."<P>

He's gotan opinion about everything and likes to speak his mind. <BR><BR>Take a look at this month's "Gab" and after Gar has gotten a fewthings off his chest, remember it's your turn. Just click on the messageboard and post your own profundities or take a minute to peruse other people's.</FONT size><BR><BR><HR WIDTH="95%" SIZE="4" ALIGN="LEFT"><br><IMG SRC="images/gargab.gif" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="145" HEIGHT="88" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"> A FEW WORDS ABOUT LOYALTY...<I>I'vebeen lovin' cigars for years. Unbelievable how many new folks are just nowdiscovering this pleasure. In fact they're so many of 'em that it'sgetting tough to find some of my favorite smokes.<BR><BR>Got to thinking about how this explosion has really challenged the cigarmakers. Since it can take as long as 5 years to age a good wrapper leaf,there's no way the cigar guys can keep ahead of this unforeseen demand.So, supply's been short for those cigar companies who, I'm happy to say,are committed to keeping up the quality.<BR><BR>Now, of course, everybody wants to jump on the cigar-selling bandwagon.Today we see cigar-friendly restaurants, cigar clubs, smoke-ins. It's everywhere.So, I was thinking, this is great for the cigar makers. But, they'vegot some challenges, too. They're short on cigars, and long on retailerswho want to sell 'em. So, who do they sell to? The small corner shop thathung in there when cigar smokin&iacute; went south? Or the Johnny-come-lately,who just opened a big new shop with a 20' X 20' walk-in humidor?<BR><BR>That got me thinking about the whole issue of loyalty today. Seems to methat loyalty, as I once knew it, has taken a real hit from the 'me-generation'and 'win-at-any-cost' thinking.<BR><BR>I was reminded of this the other day when I was talking with my 12-yearold nephew. His father was recently fired from a company he'd worked forfor 15 years. Chip said his dad's job loss '...had something to do with'down-sizing'. (The kid obviously didn't know he was supposed to use thepolitically correct phrase, 'right-sizing') 'Uncle Gar', he said, 'how canthey just do this to my dad?' Tough question. And, I couldn't help but wonderhow that experience would affect the way this young person thinks aboutthe word loyalty as he grows up.<BR><BR>A fella by the name of Frederick Reichheld has a book called 'The LoyaltyEffect'. In it, he makes a strong case for the positive effect loyalty canhave in a business. Has some pretty impressive examples. Some people willdismiss this as "old-fashioned" thinking. I'm not oneof them.<BR><BR>So...what do you think the cigar companies should do? And, what would youhave said to my newphew?<BR><BR>I'd like to hear some of your thoughts about loyalty. Post a note on themessage board. Or read some contributions from others.<BR><BR><BR>Sincerely,<BR></I></FONT></LEFT> </BLOCKQUOTE><LEFT> <BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="images/garsignature.gif" WIDTH="174" HEIGHT="46" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM"><BR><BR><BR><HR WIDTH="95%" SIZE="4" ALIGN="LEFT"></BLOCKQUOTE></LEFT><BR><P><CENTER><NOBR> <A HREF="messageboard.html"><IMG SRC="images/messageboard.gif" BORDER="0" WIDTH="119" HEIGHT="75" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A><SPACER size= 10><A HREF="store/garsline/garsline.html"><IMG SRC="store/images/garsline.gif" BORDER="0" WIDTH="60" HEIGHT="75" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A></NOBR></CENTER><P></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE> </BODY></HTML>

"101" HEIGHT="115" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"> Each Diamond Crown Exquisite Humidor,
hand crafted by Reed & Barton, is steeped in a rich heritage and tradition
that dates back to 1824.<BR>
<BR>
SmokeRings.com is proud to offer these quality humidors. We've got them
in our homes and offices, and highly recommend them to our clients.<BR>
<BR>
To own a diamond crown exquisite humidor is a statement, a testament not
only to painstaking craftsmanship and aesthetic beauty, but also to the
enjoyment of one of life's greater pleasures, the smoking of a fine cigar.<BR>
<BR>
The Diamond Crown Exquisite Humidor has been designed to maintain perfect
smoking condition for your fine cigars. The simple experience of opening
this heirloom quality humidor and being greeted by the fragrant Spanish
Cedar aroma will be everlasting.<BR>
<BR>
More than 65 individual operations, many done completely by hand, are required
to build each humidor.<BR>
<BR>
Reed & Barton uses only solid brass handles, hinges and locks in crafting
th humidor.<BR>
<BR>
Each humidor is carefully shaped from the finest solid American hardwoods,
stained and hand-rubbed for a rich, lasting finish. The exclusive finishing
methods bring out the natural beauty of the wood making each humidor truly
&quot;one of a kind&quot; with its own unique features.<BR>
<BR>
Spanish Cedar's wonderful aroma comes from the natural oil within the wood's
fiber. The small spots of natural oil that may be visible on the cedar,
enhance the aroma and the bouquet of each cigar.<BR>
<BR>
As a special feature SmokeRings.com customers may personalize their Diamond
Crown Exquisite Humidor with a Brass Nameplate available from Reed & Barton.<BR>
