By the end of 1995, The Methodist Hospital will have distributed approximately $17.5 million among several Harris County agencies and to programs within the hospital, as part of its ongoing commitment to provide health care to the indigent.
<p>
The contribution to outside agencies is only part of the hospital system's total community benefits program.  Several programs within the hospital provide charity care to financially and medically indigent patients.  As in past years, the hospital’s commitment for 1995 surpasses a minimum contribution defined by a 1993 state law that set charity care levels for tax-exempt hospitals.
<p>
The following outside programs are receiving funding as part of the 1995 program:
<ul>
<li> Northwest Assistance Ministries -- $210,240

<li> Bering Community Service Foundation -- $196,350

<li> Good Neighbor Health Center -- $235,540

<li> Visiting Nurses Association -- $400,000

<li> Eastwood Health Clinic -- $90,000

<li> Ronald McDonald House -- $100,000

<li> San Jose Clinic -- $75,000

<li> American Red Cross -- $40,000

<li> Interfaith Ministries -- $55,000

<li> Leukemia Society -- $65,500

<li> The Women's Center of Houston -- $18,882

<li> SEARCH -- $164,600

<li> The Hospice at The Texas Medical Center -- $400,000
</ul>
A Community Benefits Program Planning Committee, made up of members of the Board of Directors and chaired by Bishop Woodrow Hearn, determines that each agency to receive funding meets the hospital's funding criteria.
<p>
Among the criteria for funding are requirements that the organization:
<ul>
<li> makes services for women and children a priority;

<li> supports programs that are responsive to the Harris County Needs Assessment;

<li> ensures that funds are spent for patient care and for care of patient's families;

<li> seeks projects that collaborate with the United Methodist Church and other religious organizations.
</ul>
In addition to funding for outside agencies, the hospital's program includes a fund for charity care to help indigent patients at Methodist.  In 1994, this internal charity care totaled $15.7 million.
<p>
Methodist also provides millions of dollars in community benefits activities every year.  These include a program for health care professional education, which includes training and education of physicians, nurses, therapists and other medical professionals, as well as programs for school-age children interested in medical careers.
<p>
Another part of the hospital's funding commitment goes to scientific research activities and to community health education programs.
<p>
For more than 75 years, Methodist has earned a reputation for its commitment to quality medical care by ensuring that patients are treated with friendliness, respect and compassion.

<title>Facts About The Methodist Hospital</title><center><font size=+1>
<img src=/methodist/about/about.gif><br>

<h1><hr size=6><font size=+3><b>Facts About The Methodist Hospital</b></font><hr size=6></h1></font>
</center>The best care and service -- that has long been the mission of The Methodist 
Hospital System in Houston.  For 75 years, we have served our community, 
providing outstanding <a href=/methodist/about/facts.htm#medical>patient care</a>, 
<a href=/methodist/about/facts.htm#research> education and research</a> in a 
<a href=/methodist/about/facts.htm#spiritual>spiritual 
environment</a> of caring.  Generations of patients have seen us grow from a 30-bed 
facility into a modern health care system housing one of the largest, private, 
<a href=/methodist/about/comm.htm>non-profit</a> hospitals in the country.
<p>Today, The Methodist Hospital is a 1,527-bed, 
acute care complex located in Houston's world-renowned Texas Medical Center.  
It is one of the largest private, non-profit hospitals in the United States, and is staffed 
by more than 4,000 professionals and support personnel.  The Hospital serves more 
than 100,000 individuals annually from across the country and around the world.<p>In recent years, Methodist has been listed by <i>U.S. News & World Report</i> magazine 
as one of the best hospitals in the United States, with <a href=/methodist/ailing/Cardio.htm>cardiology</a>, 
<a href=/methodist/ailing/Oto.htm>otolaryngology</a>, 
and <a href=/methodist/ailing/Urology.htm>urology</a>
 services highlighted as among the best in the nation.  Methodist has 
also received the "Commitment to Quality" Award, the only national award 
recognizing quality in health care.<p>Through the Methodist Health Care Network, 
Inc., a member of The Methodist Hospital System, Methodist is affiliated with select 
health care institutions in the United States, Latin America, Europe, and the Middle 
East.
<a name=medical>
<p><b>Patient Care</b><p>As an internationally known specialty referral center, the
 Hospital in 1994 served approximately 9,300 inpatients and 81,000 outpatients
 from all 50 states and more than 80 countries.  The Hospital performs nearly one
 million outpatient procedures annually.<p>The Methodist Hospital has long been
 famous for its innovations in cardiology and cardiovascular surgery, and is the 
home of famed heart surgeon Dr. Michael E. DeBakey. <p>Working with Baylor 
College of Medicine, the Hospital developed one of the largest transplant centers
 in the United States, the Multi-Organ Transplant Center, and is also known for its
 use of state-of-the-art technology and innovative diagnostic and surgical treatments
 for cancer and aneurysms.  <p>And, Methodist's high-quality, high-value patient 
care has been extended beyond Hospital walls through its affiliation with the 
Visiting Nurse Association, Inc., providing home health and hospice care.
<a name=research>
<p><b>Education and Research</b><p>The Methodist Hospital is the primary adult 
teaching facility for Baylor College of Medicine, one of the nation's leading institutions 
of medical education and research.  All 827 members of the active medical 
staff hold concurrent faculty appointments at Baylor.  <p>Because of this 
affiliation, millions of dollars in research programs at Baylor and Methodist are
 translated directly into innovative patient care programs at Methodist. 
 Methodist also sponsors training programs for nursing as well as most of the
 allied health professions.<p>Major research facilities at Methodist include:<ul>
<li>The DeBakey Heart Center, which houses two federally designated Specialized 
Centers of Research dedicated to the study of heart failure and atherosclerosis; 
<li>One of three centers in the nation established for the study and treatment of
 Alzheimer's disease; 
<li>One of five of the nation's amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
 (ALS) clinics funded by the Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA); 
<li>One of two centers in the nation to receive National Institutes of Health(NIH) 
designation for prostate cancer research; 
<li>One of two centers in the nation to
receive NIH funding for neonatal seizures; and 
<li>One of eight centers to receive
 NIH funding for epilepsy research.</ul>
<a name=spiritual>
<b>Pastoral Services</b><p>The chaplains at The
 Methodist Hospital provide one of the most important and lasting services for patients
 and their families:  the healing of the spirit.<p>Each day, the Hospital's Pastoral 
Services and Education chaplains visit about 260 patients and families.  The annual
 list stretches to about 70,000.  They are ready to help 24 hours a day, taking turns 
sleeping at the Hospital so they can ensure that help is always nearby.<p>In addition 
to their ministry of counseling in times of great stress and grief, the chaplains at
 Methodist teach their specialty to about 20 clergy, lay persons and seminarians 
each year.  One-year residency, nine-month externship and 12-week internship 
programs in clinical pastoral education are all offered at Methodist.<p>More than 
600 worship services are held at the Hospital each year for patients, visitors and 
employees.  Services are provided in the Christian, Jewish and Muslim faiths, and a 
variety of nondemoninational services are also held.  <p>The Wiess Memorial 
Chapel, named in honor of Elizabeth Carrothers Wiess, is the site of daily religious 
services.  The beautiful stained glass and quiet sanctity of the chapel offer patients
and visitors a place for private prayer and meditation.

Summary: <ul>
Radiofrequency ablation may sound like a fancy name for static on your radio, but it's
          actually a technique used to "tune in" the rhythm of the heart. For the complete article,
          keep reading. For the complete story,
  keep reading.<br><p></ul><p><p><br hs=180><p>
"Radiofrequency ablation is a revolutionary medical technique," says Antonio Pacifico, a cardiologist at The Methodist Hospital.  "It allows us to fix the cause of a patient's fast heartbeat in just one day, eliminating the need for more complex open-heart surgery."<p>Normally, a heartbeat originates with a small electrical signal in the heart's right upper chamber - an area that acts as a natural pacemaker.  The signal then travels down and continues through the bottom half of the heart.<p>If the signal is blocked or starts in an area outside the heart's natural pacemaker, the heart may beat too fast.  Common symptoms are shortness of breath, chest pain or heavy pressure in the chest, palpitations or pounding in the chest, fatigue and possibly even fainting.  "In a small percentage of patients, an untreated fast heartbeat could be fatal," says Pacifico.<p>Patients who have any or all of these symptoms may need to undergo an electrophysiology study.  Doctors make a small incision in the patient's leg and feed a catheter through a vein to the heart to determine what is disturbing the heart's natural rhythm.  The tip of the catheter picks up electrical impulses from the heart and transmits those signals to a monitor.<p>Once the origin of the irregular heartbeat is identified, an ablation catheter is inserted and a pulse of radiofrequency radiation is used to melt the patch of tissue disturbing the heart rhythm without stimulating nerve endings or muscle.  "In essence, the radiofrequency ablation destroys the extra electrical connection without making a hole in the heart," says Pacificio.<p>The treatment's name comes from the radiation wavelength used, 300 to 500 kHz - just below the AM band on your car radio.  An earlier effort employed electrical energy, but it was too powerful and risked burning a hole in heart tissue.  <p>The procedure takes three to five hours and patients may go home the next day.<p><hr size=4></font><center><b><A HREF="/~imagemap/mhsmall"><IMG SRC="/methodist/icon/m-menu.gif" ISMAP border=0></a>

Summary: <ul>
Two years ago, bacterial meningitis robbed Chris Martin of his hearing. After receiving
          a cochlear implant at Methodist, the spunky teenager has returned to the world of
          sound. Chrisí mother recounts his story. For the complete article,
 keep reading.<br><p></ul><p><p><br hs=180><p>
I sat in the surgery waiting room smoothing my hair, adjusting my shoelaces, rearranging magazines...anything to distract me.  Soon, I was pacing the hospital corridor.<p>Chris, my 11-year-old son, was having surgery that could potentially restore his hearing, and time was passing so slowly. <p>"What if it doesn't work?" I thought, immediately shutting out that possibility.  It wasn't an option.  I had told him everything would be all right, and he believed me.  My mind wandered back to six months earlier, when Chris got sick. <p>It was early May, and Chris' fifth grade class had spent the first part of the week camping at a nature reserve.  Chris returned Wednesday, eyes sparkling and face flushed with excitement from his adventure.<p>But by Friday afternoon, the school nurse called to have me take him home; he was running a low-grade fever.  That night, his fever reached 104 degrees, and he was vomiting.  When I called the local children's hospital in Fort Worth, they told me it was probably a 24-hour flu.<p>By Saturday morning, Chris was too weak to walk.  He began breaking out in spots.  "Measles," I thought, weighing whether or not to wait until Monday for a doctor's opinion.<p>Sometime Sunday morning around 2:30 a.m., I heard noises in the kitchen and found Chris getting something to drink.  At first, I was relieved to see him up and around when he had been too weak to walk to the bathroom the day before.  But then he said, "Mom, it's weird.  I can't hear real well out of my right ear, and I have a headache.  Can I have some Tylenol?"<p>Chris returned to bed while I looked frantically through my home medical books for information on hearing problems from measles.  Again I called the local children's hospital, but no one there knew of hearing problems associated with measles.  I went to Chris' room with Tylenol and a glass of water.<p>"How're you doing, honey?" I asked as I stroked Chris' forehead, cool now that his fever had broken.  I was sitting on his right side.  <p>"What did you say?" Chris asked loudly.  During the half hour that had passed, his hearing had deteriorated remarkably.<p>Alarmed, I called our pediatrician at home and summarized the past two days.  His response was unnerving.<p>"Virginia, Chris doesn't have measles.  I don't know what it is, but get him to the emergency room right now.  I'll be in touch with the hospital," Dr. Richardson directed.<p>By the time we reached the hospital, Chris' hearing was completely gone.  The emergency room doctors weren't sure what had caused the hearing loss or the measle-like spots.  Tests were ordered to check out the two suspects -- a brain tumor or spinal meningitis.<p>As an orderly wheeled Chris out of the testing room, I wrote on a scrap of paper, "Did they tell you what they found?"<p>"Just found air in my head," he joked.  "No brains."  Chris tried to smile but his brown eyes didn't sparkle.<p>The CAT scan was normal, so the doctor performed a spinal tap.  Upon drawing some spinal fluid, the doctor knew Chris had bacterial meningitis.<p>Suddenly, there was a rush of activity:  starting IVs with three different antibiotics; sending the spinal fluid to a lab to identify the strain of bacteria; moving Chris to an isolation room; and distributing masks, gloves, and sterile gowns for everyone in contact with him.<p>At some point, our pediatrician explained the various doctors he wanted to consult:  a neurologist to check for damage to the nervous system, an ear specialist to test the extent of hearing damage, and the doctor in charge of infectious disease control who would need to report this case to the health department and Chris' school.<p>Monday afternoon, a hearing specialist, Dr. Palmer, confronted us.  "There are five different types of bacteria that cause bacterial meningitis.  Of those five, Chris has the worst one," he explained.  "We wouldn't have told you this 24 hours ago, but 50 percent of the kids who come in as sick as Chris don't make it through the night."<p>"What about his hearing?  When will it return?" I asked, shaking my head in disbelief.<p>"Chris has had profound hearing loss.  There are two possible causes," Dr. Palmer explained.  "One is swelling in the ear canal, which puts pressure on the cochlear nerve.  We've started him on steroids to reduce any swelling.<p>"The other possibility is that bacteria actually attacked the hair cells in the cochlea, causing them to fail," Dr. Palmer continued.  "The hair cells are what stimulate the cochlear nerve.  If that's the cause, we don't know if or how much of his hearing will return.  We'll need to wait several weeks and do another round of hearing tests."<p>Another side effect of meningitis is loss of balance, which was evident in Chris' first attempt to get out of bed.  Weaving and swaying, he finally steadied himself on the edge of the bed.<p>After several short test runs around the room, we made a trip to the game room to raise Chris' spirits.  We soon learned to watch our toes -- Chris maneuvered his IV rack as if it were filled with vodka and he had had one too many.<p>When we left the hospital two weeks later, we still relied on notepad and pencil to communicate.  Other than that, we tried to keep things as normal as possible.<p>Weekends were the hardest, since Chris couldn't do the things he was accustomed to -- going to the movies, playing ball, hanging out with his friends.  He seemed to adapt fairly well, although it was probably because we all assumed the hearing loss was temporary.  We were slated to return for hearing tests after July fourth weekend and after Chris' birthday, and we anticipated answers by then.<p>Chris wanted to have his eleventh birthday party at a miniature golf course.  When the kids sang Happy Birthday, Chris placed his hands on the table.<p>"I can't hear you sing, but I can sure feel it," he announced.<p>Fearing we would all cry, I busily cut the cake and avoided looking at my mom and sisters.<p>We returned to Dr. Palmer's office in mid-July, my hopes soaring as I sat in the waiting room while an audiologist worked with Chris.<p>The door to the hearing booth opened, and the audiologist emerged shaking his head.<p>"I'm sorry, Mrs. Ruthruff.  I cranked the machine as high as I could safely go and Chris couldn't hear a thing."<p>The audiologist walked with us to our doctor's office, where I waited to hear that everything would be okay; he would simply prescribe a pill and cure the problem.  But he didn't say that.  Instead, he began talking about a Houston doctor doing surgery to implant electrodes in the ear that stimulate the auditory nerve.<p>"The cochlear implant has been around a while, but it hasn't been approved by the FDA for children yet," he said.  "That means you'll undergo a lot of testing to prove that the implant is necessary and the only useful option for Chris.  I'll put a call in for Dr. Herman Jenkins at Methodist Hospital and find out what we can do."<p>In August, we loaded our motor home and took off for Houston.  With apprehension, we met with Rose Chmiel, an audiologist at Methodist.  We desperately hoped her sophisticated equipment would tell us something promising about Chris' hearing.  Rose managed to fit hearing tests, X-rays, another CAT scan, and an appointment with Dr. Jenkins into two days so we could return home as soon as possible.<p>We learned that Chris still had some residual hearing in his left ear, but only enough that if he stood beside a jet engine, Chris would be able to detect but not identify the engine's roar.  After two days, we returned home with hearing aids and the probability that the implant was our only hope.<p>Doctors were anticipating FDA approval for the children's implant by the following summer, but we didn't want to wait that long.  In order to qualify for the implant, the FDA required that Chris first try a hearing aid.  Only if that failed to help his hearing would Chris be eligible for the implant.<p>In November, we made another trip to Houston for two more days of testing.  Chris' frustration level peaked at Houston's School for Deaf Children; the tests only reminded him of his loss.<p>Throughout this time, I soaked in as much information on hearing and the implant as I could find.  <p>Literally meaning "land snail," the cochlea is a shell-shaped tube within the inner ear that contains a receptor for hearing.  It is also lined by 12,000 sensory hair cells that transform the mechanical vibrations of sound waves into nerve impulses so the brain can perceive sound.  Damage to the 12,000 hair cells causes profound hearing loss, and only those with this type of deafness are eligible to receive a cochlear implant because hearing aids can't help.<p>The implant has several parts and is more complex than I originally imagined.  It works by using electrodes as stand-ins for the damaged cochlear hair cells.  Chris would need to wear an external microphone behind his ear that connects to a speech processor, which looks like a paging device and is worn on a belt or carried in a pocket.<p>"The microphone picks up sounds, and the speech processor takes those parts of sound necessary for hearing and encodes them, sending them through the skin by using radio waves," Dr. Jenkins explained.<p>"The electrodes implanted in the cochlea pick up the radio waves and translate them into an electrical current that shocks the nerves in the cochlea," he continued.  "Te brain perceives the stimulated nerve as sound."<p>Chris would receive a 22-channel implant, in which 22 electrodes are implanted and separately programmed to stimulate the auditory nerve, depending on the pitch of the sound.There were potential setbacks, however.  Meningitis causes calcification in the ear, and if too much had accumulated it could block the way for the electrodes.  There was also a chance that the nerve was so severely damaged that the implant wouldn't help.I explained all this to Chris, and we weighed the pros and cons.  Only there didn't seem to be any cons.Arrangements were made for the surgery to be December 15, 1989.  I made history with my Christmas shopping -- it was completed the first week in December.  The usual excitement and anticipation of the holiday season shifted to Chris' upcoming surgery.<p>Christmas carols in the malls brought tears to my eyes, knowing Chris couldn't hear them.  "But just think, Mom," Chris said optimistically.  "I won't have to listen to your version of O Holy Night.  Sorry, but you sounded like an off-key fog horn."<p>Finally, the time came where I stood beside Chris' bed outside the operating room.  I almost panicked at the thought of something going wrong.  Assuring myself I was doing the best for him, I squeezed his hand and kissed his cheek as they wheeled him away.<p>A hint of excitement colored Dr. Jenkins' voice.  "The surgery went better than expected," he reported.  "We were able to get all 22 electrodes in the cochlea.  There was very little calcification to block us."<p>Still, he warned us to be cautiously happy; we wouldn't know how much of the cochlear nerve was still working until the processor was hooked up a month later.  <p>Chris awoke to find the right side of his head shaved and bandaged.  I thought his first call would be for me, but instead he moaned, "Aspirin!  I have a headache!"<p>The next month was filled with the prospect of sounds.  I lost count of how many times Chris said, "When I get my implant hooked up, I'm gonna..."<p>It was exciting, but I tried to remind Chris that his hearing would not be like it was before the meningitis.  He would have to relearn sounds.<p>In January, we arrived at Rose's office for three days of programming, or mapping, Chris' processor.  Everyone's mapping is different,, depending on what pitches they're comfortable with.  Rose set the low and high pitches, one by one, and Chris turned each one up as loud as he comfortably could.  Each time Rose tested an electrode and Chris heard, our excitement grew.<p>Finally, Rose scanned all 22 electrodes.  "It sounds like a whale song," Chris said, indicating that all 22 electrodes were working.  We broke out in tears, then started cheering and clapping.<p>Chris explained that our speech sounded like Donald Duck on drugs, but he could understand some of the words.  (Amazingly, he understood perfectly when I told him we were going to double his allowance.)  We spent the rest of the day trying different sounds.  Chris soon grew tired of us asking him if he could understand every little sound.<p>"He's showing amazing process," Dr. Jenkins observed when we returned for Chris' six-month checkup.  When he is able to see as well as hear the speaker, he can understand 80 to 90 percent of the conversation.  Without visual clues, he is still able to follow 50 to 60 percent.  Dr. Jenkins was impressed, and Chris beamed when he said, "Looks like Chris might be one of our star patients."<p>Chris is lucky.  The short span between his hearing loss and the surgery, the cause of the loss and the fact that his cochlear nerve suffered minimal damage, and his fully developed language skills -- combined with Dr. Jenkins' ability to get all 22 electrodes in the cochlea -- made Chris' case exceptionally successful.<p>While Chris spent the rest of that school year in a deaf education program, he returned to his regular classes that fall and is already halfway through the eighth grade.  He even made honor roll this semester.  Unlike most kids, whose attention can wander during class, Chris must focus on the teacher to augment his comprehension.  Each teacher wears a lapel microphone, and Chris has a receiver plugged into his processor so he can hear the teacher's voice without interference.  Fortunately, the other kids keep an eye on him, tapping him on the shoulder if his attention seems to lag.<p>He still has problems with competing sounds, especially in noisy restaurants or when several people are talking at the same time.<p>But Chris can once again hear his friends when they sing Happy Birthday, and this Christmas I plan to sing O Holy Night loud and clear.<p>

<title>Healthwatch - Bladder Cancer </title><center><font size=+1><img src=../../health.jpg><br><h1><hr size=6><font size=+3><b> Bladder Cancer </b></font><hr size=6></h1></font></center>
Summary: <ul>
Bladder cancer is one of the more common forms of cancer in this country. Every year, more
     than 50,000 people discover that they have this disease. Whites get bladder cancer twice as
     often as Blacks, and men are affected three times more often than women. Although bladder
     cancers most frequently occur after the age of 55, the disease can also develop in younger
     people. There will be an estimated 10,600 deaths from .bladder cancer in 1994. For the
     complete article,
  keep reading.<br><p></ul><p><p><br hs=180><p>
The signs and symptoms of this form of cancer include blood in the urine often accompanied by increased frequency of urination.  Smoking is the major culprit in bladder cancer, with smokers experiencing twice the risk of nonsmokers.  Cigarette smoking is estimated to be responsible for approximately 47 percent of the bladder cancer deaths among men and 37 percent among women.  There is also a link to occupational exposure over many years to aromatiacmines used in the chemical industry, in oil refineries, and in the manufacture of dyes, some heavy machinery, automobiles, textiles, and leather goods.  Fortunately, however, many industries now take more diligent safety precautions to protect workers from known cancer-causing exposures.
<p>
Bladder cancer is diagnosed by examination of the bladder lining using a cystoscope.  Treatment depends, of course, on a number of factors, including the patient's general health, and the type and location of the cancer or cancers.  Successful treatment of cancer of the bladder may require surgical removal of the bladder, as is the case if a tumor has spread over much of the inner surface of the bladder or if it has begun to grow into or through the bladder wall.
<p>
At The Methodist Hospital, physician are concentrating on four developments in the treatment of bladder cancer.
<p>
The most significant, from a quality-of-life standpoint, is continent urinary diversion.  Until recently, patients who had their bladder removed because of cancer required an ostomy and an external bag to collect the urine.
<p>
Seth Lerner, MD, has continued work at Methodist using a technique known as the Kock Pouch.  Originally introduced in the United States in 1982, the Kock Pouch is a reservoir made of small intestine to replace the surgically removed bladder.  The majority of men and women can now have the reconstructed intestinal bladder connected to the urethra, and continence is maintained by the patient's external sphincter.
<p>
The kidneys are protected from the reflux of urine by a surgically created intestinal valve.  The urethra is removed i some patients and a cutaneous stoma is created through which the patient catheterizes the pouch four to five times a day, obviating the need for an external collection bag.  
<p>
The second advancement is in the development of multi-agent chemotherapy to treat metastatic bladder cancer.  It has about a 70 percent objective response rate.
<p>
"Finally we have effective chemotherapy for metastatic bladder cancer," says Lerner, adding that, "It's not a panacea, however, because we still achieve a durable, complete remission rate in only 10 to 30 percent of patients."
<p>
Modifications of standard chemotherapy agents and immunotherapy for superficial bladder cancer is the third area of focus.  When the bladder cancer is in its early stages, the patient can be treated by instilling chemotherapy directly into the bladder through a uretheral catheter.  Methodist is participating with the Upjohn company in clinical trials of an oral medication, Bropiramine, which stimulates the patient's immune system to prevent recurrence of the cancer.
<p>
"We are also involved in state-of-the-art clinical trials to develop new drugs and enhance existing chemotherapy agents for improved efficacy in superficial bladder cancer," says Lerner.
<p>
A fourth and final focus is in the laboratory; preliminary research is underway in two areas:  gene therapy for bladder cancer and identification of molecular markets to predict which bladder cancer patients are at high risk for cancer recurrence and metastases.
<p>
In preliminary gene therapy experiments, we can reproduce bladder cancer in an annual model and with the use of a virus and other potential delivery mechanisms, introduce genes into bladder tumors that may enhance our ability to control the cancer.  This work is being carried out in collaboration with Savio Woo, PhD., and David Rowley, PhD., at Baylor College of Medicine.
<p>
In general, new research findings may offer ways to prevent bladder cancer.  Concurrently, the trend toward improved diagnosis and treatment provides hope that more patients with this disease will receive effective treatment.

Summary: <ul>
Prostate cancer is difficult to identify, because symptoms rarely show themselves until
          the disease is in an advanced stage. Perhaps that is why it is the second leading cancer
          killer, after lung cancer, of men age 50 and over. For the complete article,

  keep reading.</ul><p><p>

Randy Smith does not think of himself as a recovering cancer patient.  He says his story is fairly simple. His story is also fairly typical, because like many men he ignored the warning signs of prostate cancer.<p>Smith, an attorney and vice chairman of Methodist's Board of Directors, chalked up his late-night trips to the bathroom as a sign of old age until some hunting buddies warned him that frequent urination was a sign of prostate cancer.<p>This year, 133,000 men will discover they have prostate cancer.  The number is steadily increasing--two years ago 103,000 new patients were diagnosed, and last year the number rose to 122,000 cases.<p>Peter T. Scardino, MD, chief of the Urology Service at Methodist, says it's an increase that he expected.<p>"The number of patients is increasing mainly because better diagnostic tests have made it possible for the disease to be detected earlier," he explains.<p>Prostate cancer is difficult to identify, because symptoms rarely show themselves until the disease is in an advanced stage.  Perhaps that is why it is the second leading cancer killer, after lung cancer, of men age 50 and over.<p>Approximately 30,000 men will die of prostate cancer this year, deaths that Scardino says could have been prevented with earlier detection of the disease.<p>"If a cancer can be removed when it is still confined to the prostate," he says, "the chances of being cured are 100 percent."<p>Warning Signs<p>	Randy Smith ignored the warning signs from his body.  "I had no pain, no problems other than having to get up to urinate four or five times during the night.  So, I just didn't go (for a prostate examination)," he says.<p>Smith recalls that a fellow lawyer urged him to get an examination for possible prostate trouble.  "I wouldn't take the medical advice of another lawyer.  But he stayed on me, even talking to a doctor about me," says Smith.  "I should have listened earlier."<p>That lawyer has since died--of prostate cancer.<p>The prostate, part of the male reproductive system, is a small gland weighing about an ounce.  Located at the base of the bladder, the prostate produces semen needed to carry sperm cells.Scardino says the exact cause of prostate cancer is unknown.  "We do know that testosterone, the male hormone, promotes the spread of prostate cancer," he says.<p>Some studies suggest that a high-fat diet might be at least partially responsible for prostate cancer.  Whatever the causes, Scardino says the chances for getting prostate cancer increase with age.<p>The malignancy begins with cancerous cells in the prostate.  As tumors enlarge, they can press against other organs, causing pressure that can constrict the urethra and inhibit the normal flow of urine.<p>Frequent urination, painful or difficult urination, blood or pus in the urine or semen, and painful ejaculation are some of the warning signs of prostate cancer.<p>"As with other types of cancer, early detection is vital to the successful treatment of prostate cancer," says Scardino.  "Men will not get an exam unless they're having problems.  And by that time, in many cases, the cancer has spread to another part of the body.  That makes it much harder to treat.<p>Earlier is Easier<p>Prostate cancer is the most common form of cancer among American men over age 50, and black men have the highest rate of incidence.<p>It does not not kill as many men as lung cancer, because prostate screenings have become more effective.<p>Dov Kadmon, MD, a Methodist urologist, says that many men do not receive an examination for prostate cancer during regular physical examinations.<p>Last year, Methodist conducted a screening program during which 1,000 men were checked.  During the screenings researchers discovered that of the men who had received a regular checkup in the previous year, about 50 percent said their physicians ignored the simplest prostate exam.<p>"It is an unpleasant examination for both doctor and patient.  Because of that, some physicians ignore it," says Kadmon.  "A man should ask for a prostate examination if his doctor does not perform one during a routine checkup."<p>The digital rectal exam is a simple procedure.  The examining physician inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into the patient's rectum then feels for tenderness and swelling of the prostate through the wall of the rectum.<p>"Cancer feels hard. Much harder than the regular prostate gland. Physicians call it rock hard," says Kadmon, emphasizing his point by tapping the hard surface of his desk.  "The normal prostate, when you examine it with a finger, has some resiliency to it."<p>But digital rectal exams are not 100 percent certain.  They can miss smaller or out-of-reach cancers on the other side of the prostate.<p>New Weapons Against Cancer<p>A new test available at Methodist is a less uncomfortable method of spotting prostate cancer.  The Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) blood test is a simple test measuring the body's level of PSA, a protein produced only by the prostate.<p>High levels of PSA by itself does not diagnose prostate cancer but it's an indication to check the patient more carefully and to follow up.<p>Kadmon says the PSA test is really the most sensitive blood test for prostate cancer ever developed. "By itself, it's not as good as a rectal exam," he adds, "but together the two tests are very effective."<p>In a small examining room, Kadmon demonstrates a third method for diagnosing the prostate--transrectal ultrasonography, in use at Methodist for the past 10 years.<p>Using sound waves much like a submarine's SONAR, the ultrasound projects a clear picture of the prostate onto a TV screen.  A probe linked to a nearby computer sends the sound waves into the prostate, creating a picture that accurately locates a suspicious nodule.<p>"Most of the time when we feel a nodule on a prostate and perform an ultrasound, there is about an 80 percent chance it's cancer,"  Kadmon elaborates.  "The ultrasound helps us spot cancers in an early stage."<p>Like with other malignancies, suspected cancers must be documented with a biopsy.<p>"We can suspect prostate cancer with a finger, we can suspect it with a blood test, we can suspect it with the ultrasound, but the ultimate proof requires that a piece of tissue be examined under a microscope, and that is what a biopsy does," says Kadmon.<p>The ultrasound probe also contains a device for collecting a biopsy sample.  About three years ago, the biopsy was a major procedure with patients admitted to the hospital for two to four days. Now the entire procedure is done in the office and takes no more than 15 to 20 minutes.<p>During the procedure, a patient lies on his side and stares at a video screen showing an ultrasound image of his own prostate. The patient watches the same image as the doctor who collects the biopsy.<p>"We use a very skinny needle which is attached to the ultrasound probe and directed by the ultrasound to the right spot in the prostate," says Kadmon.  "The patient feels a slight pinch.  I would say it is the equivalent of having your finger stuck for a blood test."<p>Tough Choices<p> Randy Smith was in his late 50s when he was diagnosed with prostate cancer.  "I was afraid that if I had surgery, I would suffer from impotence and incontinence," he recalls.  "The same concerns that other men have."<p>Smith was told that his cancer had not spread beyond his prostate.  He had three options: surgical removal of the prostate; gold irradiated pellets implanted in the groin to kill the cancer; or massive external radiation.<p>On the recommendation of his doctor, Smith chose the surgical removal of the prostate, and in January of 1989 he had the surgery.<p>"It has some pain associated with it, like any abdominal surgery," he recalls.  "There is a catheter in you that is troublesome and stays in you for a couple of weeks.  <p>"Then you go through a period of incontinence (a loss of urinary control) for several weeks. Those muscles have been damaged or severed.  Then there is a period of impotence.  I am happy to say I got over both and am perfectly normal in every respect."<p>If Smith's case were more serious, he may have needed hormonal therapy.  This means removing testosterone from the body.<p>"The normal prostate and prostate cancer need testosterone to thrive and grow.  When you remove testosterone more than 80 percent of the cancers will stop growing and will actually shrink, even if they've spread to other areas," Kadmon says.  "The vast majority of prostate cancers require testosterone to grow even when they spread to other parts of the body."<p>There are two ways to eliminate testosterone: surgically remove the testicles, the main source of testosterone, or eliminate the hormone with a medication that stops the secretion of testosterone.  The shots, costing about $300 each, are taken once a month for the remainder of a patient's life.<p>Kadmon says the only side effect of removing testosterone is the loss of the sex drive.  There are no other physical side effects. <p>Hard Lessons	<p>The lessons that Smith learned are not lost on him. "I think it's a wake up call where you begin to appreciate things a little more, and you begin to reorder your priorities a little better," he says.  "They say this is a man's disease, but it's really a family disease."<p>One lesson Smith learned is that a yearly checkup is critical.  As a recovering cancer patient, he has a checkup every three months.<p>He urges every man to have an annual prostate exam, including the PSA blood test.<p>"I got rid of it (prostate cancer) and it's gone," says Smith. "Men are fools to not go have that exam.

<title>Healthwatch - Have Allergies?</title><center><font size=+1><img src=../../health.jpg><br><h1><hr size=6><font size=+3><b>Allergens are Everywhere</b></font> <hr size=6></h1></font></center>
Summary: <ul>
An allergy can be regarded as an over-reaction of the body's immune system.
          Basically, the immune system is doing what it's designed to do--protect the body by
          battling foreign substances. In a person with allergies, the immune system reacts to a
          substance, or allergen, that is harmless to most people--ragweed pollen, for instance,
          or duck feathers. But how do you know if your symptoms are an allergic reaction? For
          the complete article,
 keep reading.<br><p></ul><p><p><br hs=180><p>

Fall is in the air.  For some, it's the season of autumn leaves.  But for many, fall means watery eyes, runny noses and non-stop sneezing-- thanks to the tiny particles of ragweed pollen that begin their six-week whirl in mid-September.<P>Ragweed pollen is one of many antagonists plaguing the nearly 50 million Americans with allergies.  Reactions can include hay fever, hives, a host of gastrointestinal afflictions, and asthma, a chronic breathing disorder punctuated by recurrent attacks.<P>The number of deaths from allergic reaction is comparatively small:  about 4,000 Americans die annually from asthma and 2,000 from anaphylaxis, an allergy-related drop in blood pressure. <P> "Allergies are more debilitating than deadly," says Jack B. Mazow, MD, a member of Methodist's Allergy and Immunology Service and a practitioner with more than 25 years of experience.  "The problem is the suffering," he says, "not to mention the work loss, cost and inconvenience."<P>Anatomy of an Allergy<br>An allergy can be regarded as an over-reaction of the body's immune system.  Basically, the immune system is doing what it's designed to do--protect the body by battling foreign substances.<P>Typically the invaders are viruses, bacteria or parasites.  But in a person with allergies, the immune system reacts to a substance, or allergen, that is harmless to most people--ragweed pollen, for instance, or duck feathers. <P> What triggers this unnecessary battle against a harmless invader remains partly a mystery.<P>Researchers believe the mystery lies in the body's mast cells, the battleships of allergic reaction.  When the immune system of an allergen-sensitive person detects an allergic substance, it manufactures antibodies called IgE (immunoglobulin E).  These are dispatched to mast cells throughout the body, especially parts most vulnerable to invaders--the eyes, nose, mouth, stomach, and skin.  Now the body is sensitized.<P>The next time the allergen invades, IgE antibodies react, releasing histamine and other chemicals that produce swelling, spasms, and mucous production to throw off the enemy.  When the reaction is in the eyes and nose, the symptoms are tearing and sneezing; in the lungs, shortness of breath and wheezing; in the GI tract, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea; and in the skin, rashes and hives.<P>Allergies tend to run in families.  Also, if a person is allergic to one substance, there are probably more.  And in a climate like Houston's--wet, humid, and laden with organic matter--the likelihood of allergy increases.<P>  "Many of the allergies we treat relate to where we live," says Mazow.  "People develop sensitivities after repeated exposure to the density and multiplicity of allergens in this area." <P>So don't relax; this may be the year your allergy alarm goes off.<P>From Dander to Dust Mites<BR>Pollen is one of the most persistent allergy troublemakers, with enough seasonal variety to create almost year-round misery.  Tree pollen is typically responsible for spring symptoms, grass pollen in the summer and weed pollen in the fall.<P>Other environmental allergens, however, are just as pervasive.  Molds, nature's way of degrading vegetative matter, are virtually everywhere in the environment.  One type grows on wet leaves, another thrives behind the washing machine, and another on bread.  All have fungi spores that can cause severe allergic reactions.<P>Dust (or, technically, the waste of microscopic insects called dust mites) is the irritant responsible for half of all allergic respiratory reactions.  Animal dander is another common source of allergies.  And while cats are particularly irritating, all animals shed dandruff, hair, saliva and serum that can trigger reactions.  People also have allergies to insect stings and bites, typically from bees, hornets and yellow jackets, but fire ants also cause disastrous reactions.<P>Other allergies are more unusual or complex.  For instance, medications, most commonly penicillin and sulfa drugs, are known allergens. The danger is that most compounds have less familiar derivatives and can be the hidden ingredient in other mediations.  Some allergies are associated with the increasing number of additives, preservatives, and pollutants we encounter each year.  Mazow cites one case in which a nurse had a severe allergic reaction to the microscopic shavings inside a latex glove.  Only by literally crawling from the ladies' room and gasping for oxygen was she resuscitated from her brief exposure.<P>Another category of allergies is associated with foods.  Nuts and shellfish are the most common offenders, and their reactions can be sudden and deadly.  Victims must be picky eaters since even small traces of food allergen can cause problems.  "I have nightmares about dropping dead at a church supper," says one peanut allergy sufferer.<P>In the past, food allergies have been blamed for everything from bad headaches to bad grades.  <P>"People often tell us they are allergic to multiple foods," says Methodist allergist Robert Bressler.  "A more realistic number is one or two.  A genuine allergic response--like rhinitis or hives--indicates a food allergy."<P>"Reactions in the gastrointestinal tract are typically from food intolerance, not allergies.  An allergy to certain foods means that the food acts as an allergen and binds to mast cells," says Bressler, who is also a faculty member at Baylor College of Medicine.  "People often mistake dizziness or nausea as an allergic reaction to food, but a true food allergy would cause hives or anaphylaxis."<P>Just the Facts, M'aam<br>How do you know if you need to see an allergist?  Generally, if there is no fever, sneezing is rapid, mucous is clear, and eye-watering is prominent, you're probably suffering from an allergy and not a cold.<P>Patients who are clearly allergic and still suffering in spite of over-the-counter medications should probably see an allergist, who might be able to identify an unusual pattern of reaction or a more effective treatment program.  Says Mazow, "You go to an allergist to pick his or her brain.  In this specialty, a lot can be said for experience."<P>On the first visit, allergists will play the role of detective, looking for clues and information through extensive interviews and clinical histories.  The next step is testing, or challenging, to uncover exactly what is making your skin crawl or your nose run.<P>A skin test is a primitive sounding but sophisticated tool for identifying allergy sources.  Extracts of several suspected allergen are injected under the patient's skin, either on the back or the arm.  Reddening and swelling indicates a probable allergy to the substance.<P>Blood samples are another way to identify allergy sources, but they are regarded as less sensitive and reliable, not to mention expensive and time-consuming.  "Blood tests are reserved for people with profusely reactive or diseased skin, or for patients on antihistamines who wouldn't react to a skin test," says Bressler, "but right now skin testing is the state-of-the-art."<P>Hair of the Dog  <br>A veritable war chest of prescription and over-the-counter medications are available for the allergy sufferer.  But the simplest solution is to avoid the offending agent whenever possible.  This means getting rid of the cat, replacing the feather duvet, not ordering the lobster and, for the truly ambitious, washing any material that a dust mite might find hospitable (bed clothes, curtains...) daily in scalding water.<P>When avoidance isn't possible (as in the case of pollen) or probable (as in the case of dust mites), allergists try to alleviate symptoms through medications.  The most prevalent of these are antihistamines, drugs that chemically block the histamine's irritating action.  The most common antihistamines are effective on certain receptors found in the skin, nose and eyes, making them useful for the itching, swelling and redness associated with rhinitis and hives.<P>Antihistamines are generally not effective for asthma, which results from a more complex mechanism than the simple release of histamine.  Asthma patients generally respond better to inhaled bronchiodilators, which relax the muscles surrounding bronchioles in the lungs.<P>Decongestants also alleviate allergic suffering, although they work only generally to reduce swelling and fluid production in the nasal passages.  Other drugs available to treat allergy, particularly allergic asthma, include cromolyn sodium, which prevents the release of histamine, and corticosteroids, which reduce inflammation on the skin and in the nose and air passageways (see box).<P>Many long term allergy sufferers opt for immunotherapy, commonly called "allergy shots" and the closest thing to a cure.  Treatment consists of a series of injections containing small amounts of the offensive allergen--whether it's ragweed pollen or animal dander--over a period of several months, with decreasing frequency.<P>Most immunotherapy patients improve and progress to a manageable maintenance schedule.  But because of the expense, the inconvenience, and the possible reactions to the injection extracts themselves, allergists advise immunotherapy only after other treatments have failed.  <P>What's New, Pussycat?<br>Both Bressler and Mazow are optimistic about the future in the treatment of allergies.  Both work at the Center for Allergic and Immunnologic Diseases, a joint program of Methodist and Baylor College of Medicine that provides treatment and conducts research on the whole spectrum of allergic and immunologic diseases.<P>"Ours is a comprehensive service," says Bressler.  "We have a sophisticated laboratory to perform molecular and cellular research, but we also see both inpatients and outpatients.  The results of our investigations support day-to-day allergy treatment."<P>The center acts as a resource for complex or difficult allergy cases and stocks more allergen extracts for skin testing than most private practitioners can maintain.  It also offers a successful desensitizing protocol to overcome allergies to penicillin and other medications.<P>Along with basic allergic diseases, Bressler is conducting research on mastocytosis, a disease characterized by a marked increase of mast cells throughout the body.<P>"The more we know about the mast cell the better, since it is the central cell in allergic disease," says Bressler.  "We're gaining new information about the factors in its growth and regulation every day."<P>Continued research and advances in medications should reduce negative side effects, and immunotherapy will continue to improve with more, and better, standardization of allergen extracts.<P>Even more exciting is the possibility of allergy prevention in the future.  Drugs on the horizon will actually plug antibody receptors on immune system cells so allergens have nowhere to go. <P>"Our goal is to continue uncovering the allergic disease process so we can develop and refine more specific therapies," says Bressler. <P> For now, allergy sufferers needn't feel alone, nor miserable, thanks to the variety of effective treatments now available.  Today's ragweed victims can actually enjoy fall through clear eyes and noses, while 30 million particles of ragweed dance, harmlessly, above their heads.<P>Reprinted from The Journal, The Methodist Hospital's quarterly magazine.<P><hr size=4></font><center><b><A HREF="/~imagemap/mhsmall"><IMG SRC="/methodist/icon/m-menu.gif" ISMAP border=0></a>

You may be baffled by the hundreds of over-the-counter pills, syrups, capsules and lozenges that promise allergy relief.  According to Robert Bressler, MD, an allergy specialist at Methodist, "All the varieties contain slightly different chemical compounds.  One may work better for you."<P>The most effective medication depends on the individual patient, the particular types of allergies, and the specific reactions.  But beware: any use of drugs can cause interaction, even with unrelated substances like cigarette smoke.<P>Here's a list of medications that have proven successful in making the allergy-sufferer's life more liveable:<P>- Antihistamines are usually the first drug to be tried in the treatment of allergy disorders.  They work by negating the action of histamine release by mast cells after exposure to an allergen.  Antihistamines are commonly effective against rhinitis (reactions in the eyes and nose), but are also for allergic reactions of the skin, such as hives.  They work best when taken before the start of an attack. <P>A common problem with most antihistamines is drowsiness, which calls for caution when driving a car and should not be combined with alcohol or other medications.  Newer types of antihistamines do not have this sedating effect, but are available only through a doctor's prescription.<P>- Decongestants are drugs that reduce swelling of the mucous membrane and suppress the production of mucous, clearing nasal passages and sinuses enlarged by allergy irritation.  In topical drop or nasal spray form, decongestants relieve congestion within a few minutes.  Oral decongestants last longer but are slower to bring relief and may cause side effects such as increased heart rate.<P>- Bronchiodilators are used to widen the bronchioles, or narrow tubes in the lungs, and to improve breathing.  Usually inhaled, bronchiodilators can be used successfully to prevent asthma attacks and also usually improve breathing within a few minutes.<P>- Cromolyn Sodium is a mast cell inhibitor that actually prevents the release of histamine from mast cells, thwarting the allergic reaction.  It is most commonly given by inhaler for prevention of seasonal allergic rhinitis and allergy-induced asthma attacks.<P>- Corticosteriods are used for their anti-inflammatory effect in treating allergic reactions.  Topical preparations can be used for skin reactions.  Corticosteroids can also be given by nasal spray for rhinitis or by inhaler to treat asthma, although they are not effective for asthma attacks already underway.  Unlike anabolic steroids, corticosteroids are not performance-enhancing drugs and can be used by athletes even in competition.<P>Since chronic use can make allergy symptoms worse over time, these medications should be used sparingly, and they should be avoided during pregnancy.<P>Reprinted from The Journal, The Methodist Hospital's quarterly magazine.<P><hr size=4></font><center><b><A HREF="/~imagemap/mhsmall"><IMG SRC="/methodist/icon/m-menu.gif" ISMAP border=0></a>

Bzzz...ouch!  Slap!<p>	The bugs are back.  And they're in a buzz.<p>	Even if you dread that familiar summer scenario, there is little you can do to prevent a run-in with one of the many vicious, venom-carrying insects that invade every pool party, picnic, baseball game and barbecue.<p>		"Repellent will keep mosquitoes at bay, but the only way to avoid the sting of a harmful flying insect like a wasp or honeybee is to stay a safe distance away," says Dr. Robert Fromm, Jr., director of Emergency Services at The Methodist Hospital.<p>	Dr. Fromm says swatting at them with your hand may just stir them up, so it's best to just move away as fast as you can.  "If you should disrupt a nest or beehive, run!" says Dr. Fromm.<p>	Certain flying insects, like the honeybee, can sting just once, but several will strike several times and that means more poison penetrating your skin.<p>	"Nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath, weakness and generalized swelling usually mean a lot of venom has been secreted into the skin," says Dr. Fromm.  "If you notice those symptoms, it's time to see a doctor."<p>	If you are stung by a honeybee, the bee will leave its stinger stuck in your skin along with a small sack which contains venom.  Don't squeeze it!  Dr. Fromm advises gently scraping it off the skin so the venom will not penetrate.<p>	All insect stings will likely produce some localized swelling, redness of the skin, pain and an itching sensation.  "The best way to treat most stings is to apply ice for the swelling and a lotion or cream to relieve the itching," says Dr. Fromm, "but try to resist the urge to scratch the affected area since that often causes an infection."<p>	And one more thing.  Interestingly enough, the smell of some fragrances and trash is a magnet for most stinging insects.<p>	They'll get all over it.  Like bees on honey.<p>	(I just couldn't resist.)<p><hr size=4></font><center><b><A HREF="/~imagemap/mhsmall"><IMG SRC="/methodist/icon/m-menu.gif" ISMAP border=0></a>

Summary: <ul>
Lou Gehrig's disease. Alzheimer's disease. Parkinson's disease. The names are familiar,
          and the diseases frightening. Each is a neurodegenerative disease -- a brain disorder --
          that has confounded doctors and scientists for years. With continuing research into the
          root causes of these afflictions, doctors hope to provide a better quality of life for
          victims and, someday, prevent the diseases from happening. For the complete article,
</a><hr size=4>
 The dimly lit passageways of the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York, make it feel like some kind of church.  Upstairs in this place of worship, there is a special wing dedicated to one of the finest athletes who ever lived -- Lou Gehrig.<P>Downstairs in the museum's basement, among thousands of scrapbooks and millions of press clippings, are three words that sadly spell out the other enduring legacy of a man once called the Iron Horse -- amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.<P>It is an announcement, dated 1939, of a diagnosis that finished the career of the great baseball player and predicted the end of his life.<P>ALS, or Lou Gehrig's disease, is a neurodegenerative disease, one of a handful of brain disorders that have confounded doctors and scientists for years.  Their more widely known names evoke a singular dread for millions of Americans: Alzheimer's disease.  Parkinson's disease.  Lou Gehrig's disease.<P>Each of these disorders begins in the brain, which is really a network of 100 billion nerve cells, or neurons.  These neurons work together in teams to respond to information supplied by the senses or other parts of the human body.  Certain groups of neurons can perceive visual images, translate smells, control hearing and speech, or make the body's muscles move.<P>The progressive dying of neurons causes a domino effect within the body and systems begin to shut down.  Symptoms that eventually surface in the body depend on which groups of neurons have died off first.<P>The death of groups of motor neurons feeding commands to the muscles, for example, results in muscle weakness and ALS.  A loss of neurons in the substantia nigra (dark substance) of the midbrain results in tremors and slow movements and may foreshadow Parkinson's disease.  Neurons dying in a central part of the brain causes loss of memory which is often the first sign of Alzheimer's.<P>Nearly 10 million Americans are victims of these degenerative disorders.  More, many more, are also casualties: they are the families who must care for, pay for, suffer for, and pray for these victims.<P>At The Methodist Hospital, the battle against neurodegenerative disease is waged along a number of connected fronts.  Ironically, the darkest of diseases are beginning to offer the brightest hope.<P>Lethal legacy<P>Lou Gehrig died in 1941.  A few years later, his wife Eleanor pleaded with a U.S. Senate committee for more ALS research funding.  In her testimony, she told what happened to her husband and encapsulized the typical heartbreaking sequence experienced by all ALS victims.<P>"At first, he simply couldn't play baseball with the skill that put him in the Hall of Fame," she said.  "Then he couldn't play well enough to stay in the Yankee lineup.  Finally, he couldn't play baseball at all.  As the disease progressed, he couldn't dress himself, he couldn't feed himself, he couldn't walk."<P>ALS is nearly as mysterious today as it was in Lou Gehrig's time.  Although researchers have some insight into the possible causes of ALS, relatively little has been discovered about ALS that would enable doctors to save 5,000 Americans stricken annually with the disease.<P>"It is one of the most devastating conditions remaining in modern medicine," says Stanley Appel, MD, chief of Neurology at Methodist and Baylor College of Medicine, and director of the Muscular Dystrophy Association-ALS Research and Clinical Center at Methodist.  "Despite years of studying ALS, despite breakthrough research, despite sometimes heroic efforts, there is still no cure."<P>ALS leaves a healthy mind trapped inside a helpless body.  The disease causes progressive destruction, first in the brain then the spinal cord.  As the nerves wither and die there is nothing left to stimulate muscle tissues, so the body gradually wastes away.  Death generally follows 2 to 10 years after ALS is diagnosed.<P>"We've searched for cures, we've searched for treatments, anything that could improve a patient's quality of life," says Appel.  "And each time one of these avenues fails, we ask why."<P>Over the years, the fight against ALS has led researchers down many blind alleys, some disappointing and some downright bizarre.<P>"An amazing number of treatments have been tried, and all have failed," says Victor Rivera, MD, a Methodist neurologist who has treated ALS patients for more than 20 years.  "In the late 1970s, for example, a treatment that used poisonous snake venom was thought to be effective.  We investigated with a controlled study and, after a lot of effort and expense, it came up totally negative."<P>But the search for treatments and a cure must continue, Rivera says, if only to give ALS patients a slim measure of hope.<P>"The moment we remove hope, these patients and their families are emotionally destroyed.  But these people are fighters -- when a doctor does not offer hope, these people will go out and look for one who will."<P>A New Direction<P>Recently, Appel and a team of researchers working in Houston and in Hamburg, Germany, excited the world with a new theory about a possible cause for ALS.<P>These scientists found evidence that the disease could be caused by a mistaken attack on nerve cells by the body's own immune system.<P>"We saw evidence that antibodies attacked nerve cells in patients with ALS," says Appel.  Antibodies are the body's immune system weapons against disease; they work by attacking and chemically altering a target.<P>Studying patients with ALS and other neurological diseases, researchers found blood samples from most of the ALS patients contained an antibody that attacks calcium channels, protein passageways through which calcium passes into nerve cells.  These affected channels then allow too much calcium inside the nerve cell, damaging it and -- doctors believe -- causing the first stages of ALS.<P>"So if we're right, this makes ALS an autoimmune disease," says Appel.  "And if so, what's triggering the antibody reaction?  It could be a virus, it could be bacteria, it could be some chemical from the outside, it could even be trauma."<P>The researchers are hopeful this theory is a clue to the cause of other neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease.  Even if the theory isn't correct, Appel says, it's still the best clue to a breakthrough in ALS.<P>"If antibodies are the culprit, then perhaps we could lure them away from the nerve cells with a chemical decoy," says Appel.  "Or we could introduce a compound that would soak up and neutralize these antibodies."<P>Another potential benefit would be a test to identify potential ALS victims before massive damage occurs.  "If we could test and identify these people," Appel says, "treatments we have now and will develop in the future could add years to their lives."<P>Appel says doctors have had theories for decades about possible methods to slow down or stop the deterioration that characterizes ALS.  "Only in the past few years we have been able to come up with drugs that promise to do these things," he adds.  "The answer is keeping these cells from dying."<P>Growth-factor drugs, made from hormones that cause the body to grow new tissue, show the brightest promise in the area of treatment.   After years of tests on animals, these growth factors have only recently been tried on humans.<P>The hormones are genetically "purified" by scientists.  "We are able to take these natural compounds and synthesize them in the test tube," explains Rivera.  "When an adult has ALS and nerve cells are destroyed, new ones will never grow back.  When they are damaged, they die and are gone.<P>"But these growth factors cause the creation of new connections on the end of the nerve cells.  That keeps them functioning and prevents them from dying."<P>Unfortunately, these drugs can only slow down the deterioration.  Treatments are valuable but Appel agrees the search for a cause is critical.<P>"Unless we understand what's causing destruction in all the degenerative diseases -- not just ALS -- we're kidding ourselves," he says.  "We may solve it for a year or two in many patients, but we don't solve it permanently."<P>On the track to Alzheimer's<P>James Emerson used to go home every night with the rumble of freight trains echoing in his head.  But what troubled him most each evening was the thought that something he did that day could have caused a disaster somewhere down the line.<P>For 39 years, Emerson worked as a traffic controller for Southern Pacific railroad.  He began having memory problems about five and a half years ago.<P>"I'd have trouble remembering if train Number 1 was on track Number 1, or if it was somewhere else," he says.  "So at first instead of keeping it all in my head I started writing it down."<P>As his memory faded further, even his simple lists were too complicated for Emerson to follow.  "My nerves were really shot," he continues.  "I told my wife one night, 'I can't take the pressure any more.' "<P>Emerson has Alzheimer's disease.  It usually starts with forgetfulness: misplaced keys, missed appointments, a lost shopping list.  Then slowly, a world that should be warm and familiar as a family photograph becomes alien and ultimately terrifying.<P>Alzheimer's disease rips a route of destruction through the human brain, drawing a curtain of fear and confusion on the last act of at least 4 million American lives each year.<P>First identified by German neurologist Alois Alzheimer in 1906, the disease is most prevalent in people over age 65 but it affects younger people as well.  Alzheimer's has received wide publicity over the past decade; the most foreboding information predicts that by the middle of the next century, Alzheimer's will affect nearly 14 million members of that U.S. population known as baby boomers.<P>The primary symptoms of Alzheimer's depend on which direction the path of destruction takes.  Neurons usually begin dying in the hippocampus, an area of the brain that controls memory.<P>When the destruction moves upward to the left-side cortex, speech and language are affected.  Ultimately, massive destruction in these regions may cause walking and movement problems.<P>As the damage moves throughout the cortex, or outer layer of the brain, patients can hallucinate or even suffer seizures.  When it moves into the frontal cortex--the area of the brain that involves complex thinking--reasoning and other abilities fade.  Over time, the names and faces of loved ones slip away, and patients can become irritable or even violent.<P>Because women live longer than men, more females are reported with Alzheimer's.  Estimates suggest that up to 13 percent of the U.S. population over age 65 and as much as 50 percent of those over 85 may have some form of Alzheimer's.<P>Rachelle Doody, MD, PhD, is clinical director of the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, a joint Methodist and Baylor program.  Since 1989, she has treated patients and experimented with drugs designed to treat the primary symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.<P>"Although this disease is certainly incurable right now, many people unfortunately also think of it as untreatable," she says.  "We can treat many of the symptoms and improve a person's quality of life."<P>Recent research has uncovered markers in the genetic material of some people that suggest certain forms of the disease could be hereditary.  "We suspect that biochemical abnormalities possibly triggered by environmental factors--chemicals in the air, compounds in certain foods--could also be a cause in some people," says Doody.<P>Whatever the cause, Alzheimer's leaves a visible path of destruction along the surface of a human brain.  But one doesn't have to look inside a human skull to grasp the most tragic devastation of Alzheimer's.<P>Holding On<P>Since her husband's retirement, Herta Emerson has run the household.  She acts as an advocate for her husband, and has strong opinions about federal funding for Alzheimer's research.  "It doesn't get the attention that other things do," she says.<P>She also takes care of the daily family needs.  "Watching my husband's condition and taking care of our business is a new challenge, I suppose," she says.  "We are comfortable and I think we are very lucky."<P>At least 70 percent of Alzheimer's patients are cared for at home, at the family's expense.  For those who cannot care for an Alzheimer's patient, nursing home care annually costs between $20,000 and $50,000, or more.<P>While she manages the family finances, Herta keeps a careful eye on her husband's progress.  She can't tell if he has improved since he began taking an experimental drug through the Methodist Alzheimer's Center, but she doesn't believe his condition has worsened.<P>Doody has treated James Emerson for 3 years.  When she first met him, Doody immediately suggested to Emerson that he retire.<P>"He was very stressed by his memory loss," she recalls.  "It was also obvious that his memory was breaking down.  He had trouble remembering routine things, like what he ate for supper the night before."<P>Doody suspected that Emerson's forgetfulness was not totally due to job pressure.  Once removed from the stress, Emerson underwent a battery of other tests that pointed to Alzheimer's.<P>Emerson, now 63, says retiring was the best thing that could have happened to him.  "Dr. Doody was the first person to tell me that I should get off the job," he adds.  "I am sure that saved somebody's life."<P>Doody emphasizes that the center is one of the few places that patients can obtain most drug treatments for the primary symptoms of Alzheimer's.  "Treating the major symptoms is still a new concept," she says.  "It's simply too soon to tell if any of these drugs really work."<P>One experimental drug called tacrine (or THA) seems to slow down the deterioriation in some patients.  After treatment, patients show small improvements in speaking, recalling words, and naming objects.<P>"This drug, as with others we're trying, at best only slows down the process of deterioration," says Doody.  "So even if the drug works, symptoms eventually progress."<P>Another promising treatment involves the use of growth factors similar to those used in ALS tests.  As this experimentation continues, the Alzheimer's Center also aims its efforts toward isolating a cause for the disease.<P>In fact, researchers are finally beginning to understand structural changes that occur in Alzheimer's patients.  They have isolated and analyzed a protein, amyloid, that accumulates in the brains of Alzheimer's patients.<P>"We believe that amyloid has a role in damaging and killing cells," says Doody.  "As we discover more about how cells die, we'll know what kills them and what processes -- natural or otherwise -- cause things to go awry."<P>Despite the little that is known about the causes of Alzheimer's, Doody stresses that families should educate themselves about the variety of treatments for the disease's symptoms.<P>"Although many of the treatments are still experimental, people can still obtain them through centers such as this one," she explains.  "The nature of this work is almost like an ongoing battle...we fight to educate people, sometimes we scrap for more research funds.  But always the biggest battle is locating a cause for this disease, and that's still a ways off."<P>Without Warning<P>Parkinson's disease, sometimes called shaking palsy, impairs not only movement but also the intellect.  It is as serious as ALS or Alzheimer's disease.  The disorder afflicts more than 1 million people--men more than women--in the United States, starting in middle to late life and developing slowly into uncontrollable tremors; difficulties in walking, talking, and eating; and in some cases, depression, hallucinations, and dementia.<P>The disease mainly strikes people in their 50s or 60s, but cases have appeared in patients as young as 15 years old.  In severe cases of Parkinson's, patients become rigid and cannot easily resume movement.  Sometimes their facial expressions become blank, they cannot blink their eyes or control their walking.<P>Many people do not know they have Parkinson's disease.  They may have symptoms they consider minor, such as the dragging of a foot, mild stiffness in a leg or arm, or a subtle tremor.  And, symptoms typical to Parkinson's may occur as a result of other disorders such as stroke, head injury, brain tumors, poisoning, or a reaction to medication.<P>The disease is caused by a progressive atrophy of nerve cells that produce dopamine, a chemical that is important in transporting signals from one brain cell to another.  When dopamine levels dwindle, patients lose mobility and sometimes their ability to communicate.<P>"Most patients respond completely to drug therapy, mainly to a drug called levodopa, which restores dopamine to the brain," says neurologist Joseph Jankovic, director of the Parkinson's Disease Center at Methodist and Baylor.<P>Although levodopa will in many cases control Parkinson's symptoms, Jankovic says the most challenging and potentially rewarding direction for research is to find methods of diagnosing the disease before symptoms develop.<P>"We know that when a patient develops symptoms, usually at age 55 or 56, there is already an 80 percent loss of neurons producing dopamine," says Jankovic.  "Earlier detection could prevent such extensive damage."<P>As in ALS and Alzheimer's, researchers suspect that some people may have a family tendency for the disease but it could be caused in others by a renegade compound that causes certain body chemicals to go haywire.<P>An important clue surfaced a few years ago when a number of young drug addicts in the San Francisco Bay area came down with Parkinson's symptoms.  The link was made to a chemical compound present in homemade heroin.<P>"It gave us a good clue that the chemical--MPTP (or a similar neurotoxin)--causes the cell death leading to Parkinson's," says Jankovic.<P>The MPTP model has helped researchers develop drugs that slow down the deterioration of nerve cells.  The newest drug is deprenyl, which has been tested extensively at the Parkinson's Disease Center.<P>"Deprenyl is an effective drug with few side effects," says Jankovic.  "We have seen it delay Parkinson's symptoms for nine months or more."<P>Other drugs being tested include ropinerol, a compound that enhances the effects of levodopa; and midodrine, which overcomes levodopa side effects like low blood pressure.  Injections of botulinum toxin into the limbs can reduce disabling and embarrassing tremors.<P>Surgical treatments for Parkinson's have also shown promise.  Jankovic's team has transplanted part of the adrenal gland to a spot deep inside the brain.  This new tissue produces dopamine and coaxes existing brain cells to do the same.<P>Another procedure, called a thalatomy, involves planting electrodes into a section of the brain called the thalamus.  Doctors use computer scans to determine the trouble spot, then insert an electrode into the thalamus.  Electrical current passes through the electrode and stops the targeted nerve cells' activity.  The treatment has an 85 percent success rate and is used for Parkinson's patients in early stages of the disease.<P>Recent news from France reported on a method of introducing new genetic material into the cells of an animal's brain, a technique that could open the door for treating many neurological conditions, including Parkinson's.  The new genetic information could make nerve cells produce missing dopamine or help other nerve cells survive.<P>	"There are many promising fronts," says Jankovic.  "In 10 years, we'll know the cause of the disease, I believe.  Most likely we will have identified genes that point to a tendency to have Parkinson's.  This will help identify people at risk for the disease and allow us to design protective programs for them."<P>The Final Frontier?<P>The ultimate tragedy of diseases such as ALS and Alzheimer's, and to a certain extent Parkinson's disease, is that they relentlessly destroy communication, personality, memory, movement, and the senses -- the basics of being human.<P>Researchers, among them the best and the brightest in modern medicine, are drawn to dedicate themselves to studying these diseases because of their capacity for total destruction of human life.<P>If they can unmask the agent that kills nerve cells inside the brain, perhaps clinicians and scientists can indeed unlock the mystery of these diseases, providing a path to lead millions back into their lives and keep them from slipping away.<P>Reprinted from The Journal, The Methodist Hospital's quarterly magazine.<P><hr size=4></font><center><b><A HREF="/~imagemap/mhsmall"><IMG SRC="/methodist/icon/m-menu.gif" ISMAP border=0></a>

          away the most common type of cancer. But unlike many other cancers, the incidence of
          skin cancer is rising. The number of melanoma cases alone is increasing about 4
          percent a year, exceeding all other malignancies. For the complete article,

The abundance of moles dotting her skin had been a source of self-consciousness during the awkward days of puberty.  Though few of the spots were larger than a pin head, each looked as big as a silver dollar through the eyes of a girl on the threshold of her teens.  Hoping to camouflage the dreaded blemishes, she resorted to sunbathing but rarely had anything other than a sunburn to show for her efforts.<p>With maturity, the small black and brown circles grew less threatening.  For years, the woman, now in her 40s, paid scant attention to the spots.  Little wonder, then, that the small reddish-brown "mole" emerged unnoticed among several other dark circles.  The location on her lower back gave the spot an added degree of anonymity.<p>Ordinarily, an extra mole or two would have been inconsequential.  But this was no ordinary mole.  In fact, it wasn't a mole at all.  The obscure little skin eruption was skin cancer, in this case the most serious type: malignant melanoma.<p>Fortunately for her, a routine annual physical exam was scheduled by her employer.  Knowing that the woman's history of moles put her at increased risk for skin cancer, her physician did a thorough skin exam and found the melanoma before it had developed into a full-blown cancer.<p>Almost 7,000 Americans, 325 of them Texans, won't be so lucky.  That's the number of people the American Cancer Society (ACS) estimates will die of malignant melanoma during 1993.  Nationwide, malignant melanoma will be diagnosed in more than 30,000 people.<p>Though the most serious of skin cancers, malignant melanoma represent a small part of the picture.  Over 700,000 people will develop some form of skin cancer in 1993, making it far and away the most common type of cancer.  But unlike many other cancers, the incidence of skin cancer is rising.  The number of melanoma cases alone is increasing about 4 percent a year, exceeding all other malignancies.<p>The classic high-risk example for skin cancer is the fair haired, fair complexioned, blue eyed stereotype, which typifies many people of Scandinavian or English-Scottish-Irish descent.  <p>That example, however, can be misleading.<p>"In reality, anyone can develop skin cancer, regardless of skin, hair or eye color or ethnic origin," says John Wolf, Jr., MD, chief of Methodist's Dermatology Service.<p>African-Americans may have less risk for skin cancer than do their fair-complexioned counterparts, but they can and do develop skin malignancies, says Ida Orengo, MD, a dermatologic surgeon at Methodist.  African-Americans have a particular risk for acrolentiginous melanoma, a skin cancer than occurs on the hands and feet.<p>Risk for skin cancer is affected not only by the number of moles a person has but also by the kind of moles.  For example, raised moles are more closely associated with cancer than are flat skin lesions.  The risk is higher still for irregularly shaped and colored moles known as dysplastic nevi.<p>Geographic location figures into the risk.  Skin cancer incidence rises with nearness to the Equator, further evidence of a link to sun exposure.<p>A nationwide increase in the number of skin cancer cases has coincided with concern about depletion of the earth's ozone layer, which filters ultraviolet rays from sunlight.  However, the link remains unproven.<p>"There is evidence to support both sides of the argument, but the most recent information I've seen suggests there is no association," says Methodist dermatologist Andrew H. Rudolph. "Texas supposedly is an area that has had a moderate amount of ozone depletion.  Texas also has a large number of skin cancer cases.  So far, no one has been able to show a cause-and-effect relationship."<p>"Killer tan," the double entendre popularized by the ACS, is not just a billboard eye-catcher.  Little doubt exists that sunworshipers have an increased risk of skin cancer.  That includes those who work outdoors, and those who enjoy outdoor recreational activities--swimming, skiing (water or snow), and fishing.<p>Some people may consider a sunburn a small price to pay for a tan, but the long-term cost can be high, especially for kids.  A history of severe sunburn in childhood can predispose one to skin cancer, including melanoma.  Someone who stays indoors all week and tries to catch up on a suntan over the weekend may increase the risk of melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer.<p>One of the more recent trends in skin cancer might best be described as "generation creep."  At one time. skin cancer had a reputation as an older person's disease: a first lesion rarely appeared before age 50.  That's no longer true.<p>Though skin cancer is more common among older individuals, lesions are being found in a growing number of people in their 30s and 40s.  Excessive or unprotected sun exposure appears to be the primary culprit in the disease's migration to younger populations.  That development could prove troublesome over the long term, as younger people, thinking they have a low risk, might be less alert to signs of skin cancer.<p>Perhaps the most troubling aspect of skin cancer risk is that the vast majority of cases, and virtually all the deaths, could be prevented.<p>"Prevention is the first line of defense against skin cancer, and a lot of very simple steps can be taken to reduce exposure to ultraviolet radiation," says Wolf.  "Screening and detection are the next defenses.  The keys to effective screening and early treatment are physician examinations and patient self-examination of the skin."<p>Prevention begins by being weary of sunlight between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., the peak concentration period for ultraviolet light.  Fair-complexioned people or those who normally avoid the outdoors should be especially careful to avoid sunburn: start with brief exposures and gradually increase the time.<p>A sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 15 or higher is a necessity.  An SPF-15 sunscreen blocks 93 percent of ultraviolet-B (UVB), the form of radiation associated with skin cancer.  Paying more for a higher SPF doesn't buy much additional protection, says Orengo.  An SPF-30 sunscreen, for example, blocks 96 percent of UVB.<p>Contrary to consumer labeling, sunscreens are not waterproof and can even be washed away by perspiration, adds Rudolph.  As a result, a sunscreen should be reapplied every hour or two, even for those who avoid the water.Umbrellas, brimmed hats, and long sleeves and pants all offer protection from excessive sun exposure.  But especially thin clothing, such as a T-shirt, may allow even more UV penetration when wet. "For the risk-conscious consumer," says Rudolf, "a clothing manufacturer has developed an entire line of SPF-rated outerwear."<p>Don't make the mistake of thinking you can't get sunburned on an overcast day: the sun will find you even when you can't see it. Since UV energy penetrates clouds, precautions should still be taken.<p>Summer isn't the only time to heed sun warnings.  People who hike in the fall and ski in winter, and those who take trips to high altitudes, should be particularly mindful about using sunscreens and other forms of sun protection.<p>An artificial tan?  Don't be fooled. The tan is real, and so are the unhealthy effects on the skin.  Many commercial tanning salons emphasize their use of ultraviolet-A radiation, which is not as closely linked to skin cancer as UVB.  However, UVA penetrates more deeply and can damage the skin's natural elasticity, leading to premature aging.<p>"There is also some evidence that UVA may add to the skin cancer risk associated with UVB," says Rudolph.Keep in mind that older tanning machines may still use UVB energy.  Always check out the particulars of a machine before climbing into it.  That's especially true of tanning machines that may be added attractions--at a health club, for example--as opposed to being the sole service at a tanning salon.Children, as well as adults, should have a healthy respect for sun exposure.<p>"Parents can help develop that respect by applying the basic precautions to their children," says Rudolph.  "Use sunscreen and protective clothing, and limit their exposure.  And remember: an early sunburn may set the stage for an adulthood cancer, particularly malignant melanoma."<p>As a complement to prevention, skin examination should be a routine part of personal hygiene.  Self-examination obviously can't prevent cancer, but early detection plays a major role in the 90 to 99 percent cure rate with early treatment for skin cancer, including melanoma.  The ACS recommends monthly skin exams.<p>Self-examination is no time for modesty or self-consciousness.  Undress completely and stand in from of a full-length mirror, if one is available.  Have a hand-held mirror ready for inspecting the back and other hard-to-see places, especially behind the legs and arms.A skin self-exam should cover the body from head to toe, front and back, says Orengo.  Be sure to check the scalp, buttocks, under the arms, and between toes.  If possible, have someone else check your scalp.<p>Pay close attention to the location and appearance of moles, freckles, birthmarks, and other distinctive skin markings.  A cancer can be hard to spot for people unfamiliar with their own skin.  In addition, skin cancer can arise from an existing mole or other skin marking, says Orengo.<p>Though skin cancer's physical appearance can vary, staying alert for a few basic skin changes can help identify many, if not the majority, of malignancies:<p>- an eruption or sore that continually cracks, bleeds, or otherwise doesn't appear to heal.<p>- the occurrence of a new mole, freckle, or other blemish, especially one that has an irregular shape or color.<p>- a change in the size, shape, color or other features of an existing mole.<p>The physical appearance of skin cancer depends largely on the type of skin cells involved.  Two types of non-melanoma skin cancer can occur.  Basal cell carcinoma arises in the epidermis, the outermost layer of skin cells and accounts for about 75 percent of all skin cancers, according to ACS statistics.<p>Basal cells mature, or differentiate, into squamous cells, which are found in middle and upper layers of skin, Orengo explains.  About 20 percent of all skin cancers are squamous cell. Melanoma arises from melanocytes, the cells that determine skin color.<p>That small, fleshy bump on Grandpa's neck might just be a basal cell skin cancer.  Basal cell cancers also tend to appear on the head and hands.  Sometimes they occur as flat growths on the trunk of the body.<p>A suspicious red, scaly patch on the forehead?  A physician ought to take a look to see whether it's a squamous cell carcinoma.  Lesions typically arise on the ears, face and lips and tend to occur as red patches or bumps.<p>An odd-looking mole, freckle or birthmark could be malignant melanoma.  Though resembling moles, melanomas are frequently a collage of tan, red, brown and black, and they usually have an irregular shape.  They can begin in a variety of skin locations, including inside or next to a mole or other skin discoloration.<p>Basal cell skin cancers tend to grow slowly and generally do not spread to other parts of the body.  But the lesions can cause serious, even disfiguring, damage to skin areas they affect.  Squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma often grow quickly and can spread to other parts of the body, says Orengo.<p>Because of the particular threats posed by squamous cell cancer and melanoma, any suspicious lesion should be evaluated as soon as possible by a physician.<p>Several effective treatments are available for non-melanoma skin cancer.  When used by experienced physicians, each of the treatments can produce a cure rate approaching 100 percent, says Dermatology chief John Wolf.  By and large, the treatments have little risk and do not require hospitalization.<p>For very early stage basal or squamous cell cancers, a topical solution of the anti-cancer agent 5-fluoruracil is sometimes used. The most common therapy is a procedure called curettage and desiccation, which involves scraping the lesion and then burning it.  The treatment leaves small white scares that some patients find unacceptable.<p>"But in terms of simplicity and cost-effectiveness, It can't be beat," says Wolf.<p>Other treatments include simple surgery, freezing with liquid nitrogen (cryosurgery), and radiation therapy, which tends to be reserved for older patients.<p>Perhaps the best combination of effectiveness and good cosmetics comes from micrographic, or Mohs, surgery, Orengo says.  Working under a magnifying device, a physician shaves off a thin layer of a cancer lesion.  This is immediately analyzed under a microscope.  Successive layers are removed until the analysis shows no more cancerous cells.<p>When the healing is complete, scarring is minimal compared to other forms of treatment.  Mohs surgery is the preferred treatment for lesions located in sensitive or difficult to treat areas, such as the nose, ears, lips and near the eyes.  The procedure also is a good option for large skin cancers and for recurrent lesions.<p>For melanoma, surgery usually is the only treatment option.  The surgeon removes the lesion and a rim of tissue around the lesion.  The size of the rim, or marking, varies according to how deep the melanoma has penetrated into the skin, says Orengo.As a melanoma penetrates deeper into the skin, the chances increase that the cancer has spread to other sites in the body.  Common sites for cancer migration, or metastasis, are lymph nodes near the lesion, as well as the brain, liver and lungs.  When the disease has spread, chemotherapy or radiation therapy--or both--may be used in addition to surgery.<p>Treatment for non-melanoma skin cancer is highly successful, approaching 100 percent in some instances.  The risk is less than 10 percent for cancer recurring at the same location, but the risk that new lesions will arise at other sites is 30 to 40 percent over two years, Wolf says.<p>When melanoma is identified and treated at an early stage, long-term survival can exceed 90 percent.  As the depth of lesions increases, survival decreases and eventually falls below 50 percent.  Metastatic malignant melanoma has among the lowest survival rates for all cancers.<p>The next time you look in a mirror, remember that you're looking at the person who has primary responsibility for controlling skin cancer, first with prevention and second with self-examination of the skin.  About 2,000 people a year die from non-melanoma skin cancer despite treatment that is almost 100 percent effective.  Virtually all those deaths, as well as most caused by melanoma, result from putting off a doctor's visit.<p>"A lot of people don't report suspicious skin lesions to physicians because they think the lesions eventually go away," says Rudolph. "Some people don't come in because they don't take the lesion seriously, even if they think it might be skin cancer."<p>"But there's also a lot denial and fear," Rudolph continues.  "Many people are simply afraid to hear they have cancer, even if it's a kind of cancer that's easy to treat.  In reality, people should be afraid of what will happen to them if they don't hear that they have cancer."<p>Reprinted from The Journal, The Methodist Hospital's quarterly magazine.<hr size=4></font><center><b><A HREF="/~imagemap/mhsmall"><IMG SRC="/methodist/icon/m-menu.gif" ISMAP border=0></a>

Confused about how often you and your family should have annual physicals,
          boosters and screenings? Wonder no more! The chief of Family Medicine at The
          Methodist Hospital offers an easy-to-follow preventive health timetable for all ages.
          For the complete article, 
  keep reading.</ul><p><p>

Lately, Americans spend a lot of time bashing our health care system, trying to turn it inside out and make it accessible to everyone.  But there's an important question we're not asking.  Once health care is available to all, how do you get people to use it?  How do you convey the importance of regular checkups, immunizations, and routine tests?<P>It begins right here on this page, and it begins with you and your family taking responsibility.<P>All of us, at one time or another, have postponed or neglected routine tests, both for ourselves and our family members.  Robert Rakel, MD, chief of Family Medicine at The Methodist Hospital and chairman of the Family Medicine department at Baylor College of Medicine, recites a range of excuses he's heard from patients during his thirty years of practice: fear of what the doc will find, fear of discomfort, the feeling that routine tests are unnecessary. But, says Rakel, many of us are simply uninformed about necessary health screening.<P>"One-third of pregnant women in America receive inadequate prenatal care, or none at all," Rakel says. "In many countries, that would be unheard of.  It would be unacceptable for pregnant women not to see a doctor."<P>As a society, Rakel says, we don't accept responsibility for educating our members.<P>Every year, automobiles across the country are subjected--by law--to a state inspection.  Imagine if you were, too. If the law required it, would you get your blood pressure checked every year? How about screenings for breast, prostate, or colon cancer?<P>Early detection makes a significant and proven difference in the treatment of disease. Yet Rakel is baffled about our individual and societal resistance to keeping ourselves healthy.<P>"Colon cancer is the second leading cause of death in men and women," he explains.  "Yet only 2 percent of adults avail themselves of a test that would detect colon cancer in the early, treatable stages."<P>Statistics like that give merit to the idea of mandated health checkups.  But since it's not the law, it's up to you to take responsibility for your regular checkups and routine tests. <P>Being informed is the first step, says Rakel.  Depending on whom you ask, you may hear conflicting answers about when to undertake your first mammogram or EKG.  Confusion about the timing of health screenings is one of the most common excuses Rakel hears from his older patients.  Thus, he's developed a standard set of guidelines used in his family practice service.<P>We hope you'll take a minute to compare this family's health to your own, and review the checkpoints.  Have you missed any along the way?  If you have, you're not breaking any laws, except those of common sense and good judgement.<P>All seven members of this family are in apparently good health.  Based on family history and other factors, none of them are at risk for serious illnesses such as heart disease, stroke, or cancer.  Rakel recommends a different set of health screenings for each family member, based on age and gender.<P>INFANT<br>This 6-month-old boy had physical examinations at birth, two weeks, one month, two months, four months, and six months.  During the first six months of life, he has received a series of immunizations for DPT (diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus), OPV (oral polio vaccine), haemophilus influenzae, and Hepatitis B. He will not require any other immunizations until 15 months of age.<P>His next physicals should be scheduled at 9 and 12 months.  The nine-month exam will include a hematocrit, or lab blood test. (If at risk, he should also undergo a sickle-cell test at nine months.) The 12-month exam will include a TB skin test for tuberculosis.  A third Hepatitis B immunization is given at 6-18 months.<P>TODDLER<br>At 15 months, this child had booster shots (DPT, OPV, and influenza B) and immunizations against measles, mumps, and rubella.  After 15 months, physical exams are recommended at ages 2, 3, 4, and 5 years.  At age 5, his exam will include booster shots (DPT and OPV), another hematocrit, and a TB skin test if at risk.  He should have a physical exam every two years from age 8 to 18, with a Td (tetanus-diphtheria) booster at age 14.<P>MOM & DAD<br>Mom and Dad, both thirtysomething, got a head start on a healthy future if they each had a complete physical at age 30.  By having physicals early in adult life, they provide their family doctor with a basis of comparison for future physicals.  That way, their doctor can detect any subtle changes, such as early warning signs of disease, that might go unnoticed without this first physical.  If you're in your 30s and you haven't had a comprehensive physical, now is the time to do it.<P>The physical at age 30 should include the following tests, which will be repeated at ages 35 and 40 or at five-year intervals following the first adult physical:<br>* blood-chemistry panel<br>* complete blood count<br>* cholesterol test<br>* urinalysis<br>* eye exam<br>* hearing exam<P>The physical at age 30 should also include a Td (booster) immunization, to be repeated in 10 years.<P>MOM<br>Mom's current health management program includes the following:<br>* annual pap test, including breast exam, since age 18<br>* annual blood pressure screening<br>* a baseline EKG at age 40<br>* a baseline mammogram at age 40, repeated every two years<P>DAD<br>Dad's current health management program includes the following:<br>* annual blood pressure screening<br>* baseline EKG at age 40, repeated every five years<br>* digital rectal exam at age 40, repeated annually<P>GRANDPARENTS<br>Both grandparents, in their late 50s, and great-grandfather, in his 80s, have been blessed with good health.  If they haven't missed any health checkpoints during their earlier years, their health management program looks like this:<P>Annually<br>* blood pressure<br>* occult stool blood test (annually from age 50)<P>Every three to five years<br>* sigmoidoscopy (baseline at age 50 and 51)<br>* cholesterol test<br>* eye exam<P>Every five years<br>* blood-chemistry panel<br>* complete blood count<br>* urinalysis<br>* hearing exam<br>* electrocardiogram (baseline at age 40, then every 5 years)<P>Every 10 years<br>* Td (booster)<P>GRANDMOTHER<br>* annual pap test<br>* annual breast exam (in conjunction with monthly self breast exam)<br>* annual mammogram<p>GRANDFATHER<br>* digital rectal exam (annually from age 40)<br>* annual PSA (prostate specific antigen) test (value controversial)<P>GREAT GRANDFATHER<br>* pneumococcal vaccine (once at age 65)<br>* annual influenza vaccine after age 65<P>Reprinted from The Journal, The Methodist Hospital's quarterly magazine.<P><hr size=4></font><center><b><A HREF="/~imagemap/mhsmall"><IMG SRC="/methodist/icon/m-menu.gif" ISMAP border=0></a>

Professional athletes may have the best doctors, but who can you turn to when your
          weekend soccer match results in a painful, swollen knee? The same physicians who
          look after Hakeem Olajuwon are ready to serve you at the Baylor Sports Medicine
          Institute at The Methodist Hospital the first comprehensive center for sports

For one glorious week this past summer, Houston was the center of the sports universe.  There were wild, sweaty parties in the middle of major thoroughfares.  Countless interviews with television, radio, and newspaper reporters.  And a parade, where the cheers of a half million delirious fans echoed through the canyons of steel and glass skyscrapers.<P>All because Houston's professional basketball team, the Rockets, won a championship.  It was the first title claimed by a major-league sports franchise in the city, starved after decades of heart-stopping near misses and miserable losing streaks.<P>The city's new heroes rode on fire engines as the victory parade crept through a sea of humanity wearing bright red and yellow, the home team's colors.  These people screamed for athletes with colorful nicknames like The Dream, Mad Max, O.T., and Sam I Am.<P>When the thousands of fans turned out for that massive parade in June, they didn't realize they were there to cheer a few more guys, no less professional than the athletes and not one iota less vital to the Rockets' title run.  But by comparison, they were so anonymous they shared a common nickname: Doc.<P>The official team doctors, orthopedic surgeons Walter Lowe and J. Bruce Moseley Jr. and internal medicine specialist James Muntz, were considered so integral to the Rockets' title run that the team awarded them the same diamond-studded world championship rings given to players and coaches.<P>As summer faded and crept into fall, fans put away their Believe It! and Clutch City signs.  Some of them picked up tools and started raking their yards.  Others pulled on camouflage gear and went hunting.  A few started training for the marathon.  And others picked up basketballs and dreamed of one day riding in a big downtown victory parade.<P>Most of them will never even approach the big leagues.  Until one of these weekend warriors wrenches a knee or rips a ligament.  Then these amateur athletes can take their pain to the new Baylor Sports Medicine Institute at The Methodist Hospital, the first comprehensive center for sports medicine in the Texas Medical Center.<P>There, they can watch the pros go to work.  And they don t even have to buy a ticket.<P>Team Concept<P>To the Rockets last season, Lowe, Moseley, and Muntz were more valuable than Gatorade.  What made them so important?<P>Possibly it was one play, midway through last season, that could have changed the entire course of the Rockets' championship fortunes.  And this play wasn't even on the court.<P>It involved Sean Elliott, who played for the Detroit Pistons. Last February 4, the Rockets traded forwards Matt Bullard and Robert Horry, as well as a couple of draft picks, to Detroit for Elliott. Bullard and Horry packed up and spent two days in Detroit, but suddenly the deal was off.<P>"Dr. Muntz, the team internist, and I did a complete physical on Elliott and saw that he had a kidney problem," recalls Moseley.  "We consulted with other specialists at Methodist (nephrologists Wadi Suki and J. Pedro Frommer) and they agreed Elliott wasn't the 100-percent healthy athlete we thought he was."<P>Doctors reported this information back to the Rockets management, and the deal was off.  The two players returned to Houston, and Horry became a commanding presence for the Rockets in the playoffs.<P>The same medical teamwork that helped the Rockets has spawned a new center combining the sports medicine expertise of three respected organizations  Methodist, Baylor Orthopedic Consultants, and HealthSouth, a private physical rehabilitation company.<P>Methodist will provide research laboratories, educational facilities, and a high-tech conference area for the sports medicine institute.  Six physicians and a number of support staff at the center are employed by Baylor Orthopedic Consultants, and HealthSouth provides and staffs the center's rehabilitation facilities.<P>"We plan to offer a full range of services geared toward the athlete and the active individual, says orthopedic surgeon James Bocell Jr., the center's medical director and section chief of Sports Medicine at Methodist and Baylor College of Medicine.  "It's what we call comprehensive care -- everything from education, to prevention, to treatment of injuries."  And this care will be available to everyone, from the professional athlete to weekend tennis players.<P>A Place for the Weekend Warrior<P>Most so-called sports injuries are injuries of the soft tissue surrounding the joints, a bone, or groups of bones.  It could be anything from a pulled calf muscle or a fractured arm to a torn Achilles tendon or a jammed finger.  It doesn t matter if the injury was caused by a screaming slam dunk or a slip in the bathtub.<P>Sports medicine is really a highly specialized part of orthopedics, says Bocell.  "At this center, we don't mean to say we'll treat only athletes; we'll treat a number of people injured on the job, for example.  But by calling it a 'sports medicine institute,' we let people know they'll get the best orthopedic care possible."<P>Some Methodist/Baylor doctors affiliated with the sports medicine institute are official team physicians of the Houston Oilers, Astros, Rockets, and the new Houston Hotshots professional soccer team.  HealthSouth is a corporate sponsor of the Rockets and the Hotshots.<P>"The professionals tend to seek out the best available care, which is why our physicians have been chosen by these teams," explains Dennis Pullin, executive director of the Sports Medicine Institute.<P>The professional sports connection, however, is just an endorsement of sorts to the everyday weekend warrior.  "Who wouldn't want to be treated by the same doctors who treat familiar star athletes?" Pullin asks.<P>Personnel from the center will also work closely with college and high school athletic programs. For instance, in addition to being the Rockets  head physician, Lowe is the official team doctor for the University of Houston and Houston Baptist University basketball programs.<P>"We send trainers, physical therapists, exercise physiologists, and other experts to athletic events, where they work alongside the schools' doctors and trainers," says Pullin. "And it's not just for players' injuries; we also set up educational programs for students that offer information on how to work out properly, how to stay in shape during the off-season, and the right diet for athletes."<P>The center is also a presence at local athletic events such as tennis tournaments, January's Houston-Tenneco marathon, and other running races.<P>"People recognize that the same specialists who treat professional athletes can give everyone the same kind of care," Pullin says.  "That s our most important point."<P>Better Shape, Better Medicine<P>For decades Methodist has operated one of the country's top centers for orthopedics.<P>The orthopedic program came into its own in 1932, when the local Arabia Temple Shrine program for crippled children moved its outpatient clinic from Hermann Hospital to Methodist, then located in downtown Houston. The Shrine started the program after World War I as a national effort designed to capitalize on medical skills learned by young doctors on the battlefield.<P>For years, Methodist doctors had treated children referred to them from the Shrine clinic. But after moving to Methodist, the Shrine's program evolved into primarily an orthopedic and plastic surgery clinic with a reputation that attracted doctors.<P>One of these was orthopedic surgeon Joe King, who came to Methodist in 1948.  King went on to become the hospital's chief of Orthopedic Services in the 1950s and 1960s and served as president of the hospital's medical staff during that time. Under King's leadership, the orthopedic department became internationally known.<P>Today, Methodist's Orthopedic Service is one of the most active in the country.  In addition to treating bone disease, trauma, and fractures and performing reconstructive joint surgery, the Orthopedic Service offers complete joint replacement, pain control, and a bone bank for transplant surgery.<P>During his career, King worked with players from the Colt .45s, Houston's professional baseball team that became the Astros in 1965. Other doctors from Methodist went to work for the Oilers, the football franchise, in the early 1970s.<P>Maybe it wasn't called sports medicine at the time, but Methodist's orthopedic surgeons helped pioneer a vital service for what was about to happen on a nationwide scale.<P>What happened was that somewhere in the early to mid-1970s, America suddenly became more athletic. Better medical information in the media emphasized the importance of exercise.<P>As more people got up off the couch and into their sweats, doctors began to see more injuries caused by this new activity, says Pullin. The flip side of being in better shape was being more likely to get injuries like pulled muscles and serious sprains. Shin splints, side stitches, and no pain, no gain became parts of the American idiom. Sports medicine was born.<P>Since Methodist and Baylor already had a renowned orthopedics unit and a long-standing relationship with Houston s sports teams, it only made sense to combine the specialties into an all-inclusive sports medicine mecca.<P>The center itself sprawls across two buildings in The Methodist Hospital complex.  Construction last fall renovated what was formerly the Institute of Preventive Medicine (IPM) in Scurlock Tower into areas for the center's radiology, physical therapy, examination, and waiting rooms. Smith Tower next door houses doctors  offices and facilities for teaching and research. And within the complex, HealthSouth -- known nationally for physical rehabilitation -- offers short- and long-term rehabilitative care. <P>Other physicians around the community maintain a close link with the center.  Together, they form an affiliated network to expand the center's reach.<P>"It gives us another method of getting word out about our services , says Pullin. "As many as 40 orthopedic physicians in surrounding areas work with our physicians to extend our service to within 100 miles of Austin and San Antonio to the west, and into Louisiana to the east."<P>The New Gladiators<P>A roar of a crowd during an Astrodome football game is the sonic sister of a jet takeoff or a thunderstorm's rumble. It plays havoc with the ears as well as the eyes.<P>Unless you're a player.  Then the violence can sometimes take a serious toll.<P>Thomas Cain, MD, an orthopedic surgeon at Methodist who works with the sports medicine institute, has treated the Houston Oilers since 1974. <P> He's seen the gamut of injuries one can sustain when 22 behemoths cut loose on the Astroturf. Now, though, he just doesn't see them as much.<P>"Athletes are definitely more aware of conditioning and how to take care of themselves today," says Cain. "Even minor little injuries concern them because they're so finely tuned to performing well. As a result, we see fewer injuries because athletes are generally in much better shape than they were 10 years ago."<P>In football, certain types of injuries are common. Most common are sprains -- tears in the ligaments that hold together bones around joints such as knees, ankles, and fingers. Cain says minor sprains require rest to heal, and possibly an ice pack for swelling and pain. After a few days, athletes with minor sprains should begin to slowly exercise the injured joint. More severe sprains require a cast and sometimes surgery to repair badly torn ligaments.<P>"Another common injury is the brachial-plexus stretch, known as a 'burner,'" Cain explains. "It's a terrible burning sensation in the arm, and it happens when nerves between the shoulder and neck are stretched. It usually lasts a few minutes and, in most cases, the player can return to the game."<P>Cain and other Oilers  team physicians (internal medicine specialist Muntz is one) are trained to get right at the source of an injured player's pain. They question the player about what he s feeling, and from that information the doctors make a decision about keeping a player out of the game if necessary.<P>The way Warren Moon sees it, making a sound medical decision in the heat of a game is much like a quarterback's decision to change a play at the line of scrimmage after he reads the defense.<P>Moon is the former quarterback for the Houston Oilers.  He is 38, an age when most other professional players have already enjoyed years of retirement. So he's particularly attentive to the doctors' advice.<P>"Doctors will go on what the player feels and believes," says Moon. "If a player thinks it is safe to go back in the game, they will let you go back out there. But they will keep a very close watch on you."<P>While it's really up to the team's head trainer and coaches to keep a player from playing, sometimes drastic measures are necessary.<P>If it's not safe yet and the player still insists on playing, the doctors can call their own play. "When a player is really injured and we're nervous about him sneaking back on the field, we'll lock his helmet in a footlocker," says Cain. But that scenario is rare.<P>"Players know that ignoring a serious injury can hamper their performance and even jeopardize a career," Cain continues. "They always say 'play smart.'  Part of that is knowing when you can't go back into a game."<P>While everyday athletes don't have a paycheck riding on whether they play, they do have to go to work the next day.<P>Time and rest are great healers of many minor injuries, says Cain. With a football player, both doctor and player have to make on-the-spot decisions on whether to continue playing. But a regular patient can make a concerted effort to keep weight off the injured joint or area, get lots of rest, and slowly work back into a regular exercise or athletic schedule.<P>One Strike, and They're Out<P>Before professional baseball players went on strike, it seemed the Houston Astros were poised to make a run at a pennant and possibly even the World Series.<P>Sitting out of first place by the slimmest of margins, the Astros believed a player walkout would be the worst news of all. Until Jeff Bagwell got injured.<P>Bagwell, the Astros  sensational first baseman who won National League Rookie of the Year honors in 1993 and Most Valuable Player laurels in 1994, was hit by a pitch that broke a bone in his hand, effectively silencing his hot bat for the crucial weeks of the upcoming pennant race.<P>Orthopedist Bill Bryan has been the Astros  team physician for 12 seasons. He also treats players with minor-league farm teams that form the talent pool for the Astros.<P>The art of treating baseball players involves keeping a complete knowledge of a player's condition and medical history, explains Bryan. The basic idea is to keep small problems from becoming big ones.<P>Bryan says that professional athletes, baseball players in particular, have less chance of major injury than the average weekend athlete because of the amount of conditioning most professionals endure.<P>"Obviously, the greatest risks for a baseball player are being hit by a ball or a collision at a base. Those are atypical injuries; usually we deal with routine shoulder, knee, and ankle injuries," Bryan says. But in baseball, doctors have the luxury of time to make sure about a diagnosis, because players can't go back into a game once they go out.<P>Bryan draws on his experience with players like Bagwell and Nolan Ryan to help young players aiming for a long baseball career.<P>For example, it's possible to learn how to pitch the wrong way, says Bryan.  "A kid who starts pitching in Little League could learn the wrong mechanics and wind up with his arm shot by the time he's in college. So learning the proper mechanics is an important part of learning baseball."<P>Coaches, too, have a bit to learn: pitching a young player too often could result in an injury. It stands to reason that a major league pitcher who throws at speeds up to 90 miles per hour needs to be rested between games, Bryan says. "It may not seem so obvious for a young kid, but overplaying a child can result in the same types of injuries."<P>When Titans Tumble<P>For years, the Houston Rockets' most valuable player has been Hakeem Olajuwon. The fans always knew that. But this year, the whole world acknowledged it; Olajuwon was named the National Basketball Association's Most Valuable Player.<P>When Olajuwon tumbled into a crush of news photographers during a game in early December, Rockets fans and management held their collective breath. The Dream, what the fans call Olajuwon (or The Franchise, which is what the team owner calls him) suffered minor injuries that nonetheless kept him out of a few games.<P>That was a freak, unforseeable accident; more common injuries on the basketball court come as a result of the players' intensity. <P>They get into the game so much that they're not always aware they may land off-balance and fall, or could swing an elbow that catches someone else in the eye, says orthopedist Moseley, one of the Rockets' team doctors.<P>Because basketball is a game of endurance (try running up and down that court for 48 minutes), Moseley says pre-season conditioning is important.<P>"In basketball, there's a lot of up and down motion and landing hard on the feet and ankles. Conditioning is very important, especially for athletes who play on the harder surfaces like concrete," says Moseley.<P>Moseley and Lowe, the Rockets' head physicians, both served fellowships at the Kerlan-Jobe Orthopedic Clinic in Los Angeles. While there, they treated members of the LA Rams, the Dodgers, the Lakers, the Kings (hockey), the California Angels, and players on the mens' and womens' professional golf circuits.<P>The doctors have seen that better sports medicine can in many instances make a better athlete. "When you look at the whole picture -- education, conditioning, proper and early treatment of injuries, appropriate rest and recuperation -- you can stay healthy throughout your athletic career," says Moseley, whether you re a professional basketball player or a guy who likes to walk around the block.<P>If you're the latter, get a thorough checkup from your regular physician before starting a strenuous exercise regimen. Don't try to do too much too soon; practice makes perfect, and you can grow  into your sport by building stamina and strength.<P>"As people start participating in higher levels of sporting competition, the risk of an injury becomes greater, Moseley says. Injuries usually happen at the beginning of an athletic season or among people who aren't yet in proper shape to do what they re hoping to do.<P>Remember: the pros have trainers and team doctors to help them with conditioning programs. Actually, a person who plays basketball on a very competitive but not professional level may be in a little better shape than a pro, adds Moseley, because amateurs do not normally have trainers and team support behind them. In order to stay in shape, the serious athletic individual must rely on a good, sound general conditioning program and his or her own physical ability.<P>But when an injury occurs, teaming up with an experienced sports doctor is most often the winning formula.<P>Now in his second season with the Rockets, Moseley uses his experience with the team to prove his point.<P>"You can't argue with this: every year we've been with the Rockets," he jokes, "they've won a championship."<P>Reprinted from The Journal, The Methodist Hospital's quarterly magazine.<P><hr size=4></font><center><b><A HREF="/~imagemap/mhsmall"><IMG SRC="/methodist/icon/m-menu.gif" ISMAP border=0></a>

<hr size=6></h1></font></center>
Summary: <ul>
When diagnosed with acute myelogenous leukemia, a deadly blood disorder, James
          "Jimmy" Williams was offered hope through a sort of chemical warfare launched in
          Methodist's new Bone Marrow Transplant Unit. Three days after he arrived in
          Houston, Williams started chemotherapy. Six months later he had a bone marrow
          transplant."I'm a survivor," Williams smiles. For the complete story,  keep reading.</ul><p><p>

When he was eight years old, James "Jimmy" Williams was hit by a car. His
 visit to the emergency room lasted just long enough to get a few of his toes 
stitched up.<p>"I've always avoided hospitals ever since I can remember," says 
the 37-year-old rancher from Refugio, Texas.  "I use to think hospitals were a 
place where people died."In February of last year, Williams thought he might 
be one of those people.  <p>It started with what his family doctor thought was a 
simple case of the flu.  When his fever soared to 105 degrees, Williams was
 immediately admitted to the local hospital.  He tested positive for typhoid and
 was successfully treated with a round of antibiotics.<p>Two weeks later Williams 
was back at work, and the fever returned. This time his temperature crept 
dangerously past 105.  More testing revealed a low blood count.  Baffled, his
 doctors transferred Williams to the regional medical center in Victoria for more
 tests and a bone marrow biopsy, all of which were inconclusive.<p>"All the tests 
came up slightly positive for mononucleosis, yet I kept getting these bouts of high
 fever," Williams says, shaking his head.  "It was so frustrating feeling so sick yet 
not knowing what was wrong."<p>It didn't take long to find out.  At The Methodist 
Hospital, Williams was diagnosed with acute myelogenous leukemia, a deadly 
blood disorder.Leukemia has no face, no heart, no soul, and it chooses its 
victims without reason.  While typically patients lose the battle to this relentless
 foe, Williams was offered hope through a sort of chemical warfare launched in
 Methodist's new Bone Marrow Transplant Unit.<p>"After months of being so ill," 
he recalls, "I was relieved to know what was wrong with me and to hear that there
 was something that could help."<p>Three days after he arrived in Houston, 
Williams started chemotherapy.  Six months later he had a bone marrow 
transplant.<p>"I'm a survivor," Williams smiles.<p>Without the transplant he 
would have been lucky to live a year with acute myelogenous leukemia; this 
cancer progresses rapidly. <p>Williams' long-term survival is still not guaranteed
, but he has a fighting chance.  Where before there was a 90 percent likelihood of
 relapse, the transplant dropped those odds to under 50 percent.<p>Only since the
 mid-1980s have bone marrow transplants come of age as an alternative treatment
 to stubborn cancers.  Before that, patients like Williams would have died. <p>Today bone marrow transplants are used to treat the most lethal cancers, including
 leukemias and high-risk breast and ovarian cancers.  In 1992 over 20,000 people 
worldwide had had the treatment, up from a few hundred in 1981.  When
 Williams first heard his diagnosis he felt confused and overwhelmed.  Like most 
people, he had never heard of bone marrow transplants, and the details about the 
complications and risks, possible side effects and medications to fight them
 made his head spin. <p>Philip McCarthy, MD, director of Methodist's Bone
 Marrow Transplant program, carefully explained to Williams that his type of 
leukemia would not be cured by conventional chemotherapy.  It requires extremely
 high doses.  So high, in fact, that in killing stubborn cancer cells the medication 
also destroys healthy bone marrow. <p>It's impossible to survive without bone
 marrow.  A spongy tissue found inside our bones, bone marrow produces blood 
cells that provide the starting point of our immune system.  A transplant allows 
doctors to replace the marrow destroyed after chemotherapy or radiation with
 healthy marrow, offering a chance for survival in the face of death.Still, the 
stakes are high. Because of infection, adverse reactions, or a relapse, 20 to 25 percent of marrow transplant patients who use donated bone marrow do not survive past the first three months.<p>But the stakes are even higher without a transplant.  <p>"These patients die if they don't take the risk," says McCarthy, recruited from Harvard's bone marrow tranplant program in 1991 to head up Methodist's unit.  "A transplant gives them an advantage, and hope."<p>Williams agrees.  "It was not a difficult decision to agree to have the transplant.  I didn't like the risk, but I had no choice if I wanted a chance to live."<p>There are three types of bone marrow transplants.  An autologous transplant, which uses the patient's own bone marrow, is used for cancers that don't involve the marrow, such as breast cancer or Hodgkin's disease, or if the cancer afflicting the marrow is in remission. An allogeneic transplant uses the bone marrow from a matched donor, and syngeneic, the rarest, uses marrow from an identical twin.<p>When donor marrow is used, a simple but highly sophisticated blood test indicates if the donor's tissue type is a suitable match for the patient.  If the match isn't good, the body develops a severe case of "graft-versus-host disease" (GVHD) in which the donor immune system rejects the body of the recipient.  The majority of allogeneic transplant patients experience some form of GVHD but without any long-term side effects.<p>Locating donor marrow in the general population is like finding a needle in a haystack; many nationwide searches for donor marrow come up empty.  A patient's best chance of finding a suitable marrow donor is from a sibling.<p>Reports indicate that in the last five years at least 40 children have been conceived in the United States for the sole hope that their marrow will save a dying sibling.<p>In fact, in 1991 the parents of Anissa Ayala were the focus of international publicity. After a nationwide search failed to match a donor for their dying daughter, they publicly admitted to conceiving a baby to provide donor marrow.  It was not easy.  Anissa's father needed a vasectomy reversed, and her mother was 42 years old.<p>Luckily, Jimmy Williams already had seven siblings, all who immediately volunteered to have their blood tested.  His older brother Daniel was a perfect match.<p>"No one thought twice about offering to be a donor," says Williams.  "Our family is very close.  Everything I have is theirs, and everything they have is mine."<p>Harvesting bone marrow for the transplant is the same procedure whether it's from the patient or a donor.  The donor is anesthetized while doctors insert long needles into both hips, extracting precious tubes of the dark red marrow.  The whole procedure took about two hours, and Daniel never mentioned any discomfort.<p>"The multiple extractions leave the donor a little sore, but there is little risk," explains McCarthy.<p>Over the six months prior to the transplant, Williams had undergone four cycles of high-dose chemotherapy, each lasting about a week. Shortly after beginning his chemotherapy, Williams started feeling better.  What he remembers most was finally having a normal temperature.  While he had no trouble with the common side effects, such as nausea, he did lose his hair and his sense of taste.<p>"I would eat the hottest Mexican food I could find to make up for my lack of taste," he says.<p>After his last cycle of intense chemotherapy to destroy every cancerous marrow cell, Williams had the transplant.<p>"It was a surprisingly simple procedure," Williams recalls.<p>As soon as his brother's marrow was drawn, it was dripped into Williams' bloodstream through an IV tube.  Once in the body, the marrow naturally found its way inside Williams' bones and began producing normal blood cells.<p>The first three months after a transplant is the most critical period for complications, McCarthy stresses.  "An impaired immune system (from the chemotherapy) makes patients very susceptible to infection, and extreme precautions are taken to minimize that risk," he says.<p>Again, Williams was fortunate.  He felt weak, "but not terrible," and he never had any serious complications.  Still, he remembers the pills he had to take to prevent a laundry list of possible side effects.  Medications are prescribed to prevent infections, and additional ones are given to prevent graft-versus-host disease.  <p>Williams had blood transfusions to beef up his low blood counts.  And like all transplant patients, there was a concern about liver, kidney, and lung dysfunction from the chemotherapy and the constant worry of infection.<p>To prevent infection, the leading killer of transplant patients, Methodist's new $400,000 bone marrow transplant unit is exactingly designed to keep the place spotless.  From its seamless floors to its recessed blinds inside the windows, "it must be 100 percent clean for patients," says head nurse Norma Salahshour.  "A critical aspect for patients is clean air, which we achieve throught the use of special filters."<p>A nine-month planning stage culminated in a unit that offers the latest technology in comfortable surroundings.<p>"We wanted an attractive area, one in which the patients' needs are met in the comfort of a home-like atmosphere," Salashour says.<p>Each room even has a sink outside it to make the required constant handwashing more convenient.<p>Unlike many other bone marrow transplant units, the cutting-edge air infiltration system eliminates the need for isolation rooms.  Family members and friends can interact personally with patients, a key ingredient to keeping a patient's spirits alive.<p>"I needed all the emotional support I could get," says Williams.  "I was very lucky that someone was always with me."<p>He watched a lot of television, played Nintendo, and talked with family and the nursing staff.  "Those nurses could not have been a better group," Williams says. "I owe them a lot."<p>After six weeks in the hospital, Williams left Methodist with the knowledge that full recovery was still months away--it takes the immune system six months to a year to function at 100 percent again.  He returned weekly for the first months after his transplant, but now his visits are once a month.  After a year, if all goes well, he can go back to work full time.<p>But Williams, looking every bit the hardy oil field service worker, is already ready to work. It's been seven months, and he's helping with chores on the family farm, easing his way back to normalcy. <p>So far, he has won his game of chicken with death.  <p>"My chances that my leukemia won't return are not 100 percent, but that's okay," Williams says. "I'll take 50 percent over 10 percent any day.  Wouldn't you?"<p>Reprinted from The Journal, The Methodist Hospital's quarterly magazine.

Summary: <ul>
Breast cancer lags only behind lung cancer as the leading cause of cancer death among
          women in the United States. The American Cancer Society estimates that 44,500
          women died from breast cancer in 1991. Although the incidence is increasing--one out
          of nine women will develop breast cancer--mortality rates have remained fairly stable
          over the past 50 years due to early detection and improved treatment. For the
          complete article,  keep reading.</ul><p><p>

Pam Henson didn't know much about breast cancer when the surgeon diagnosed a lump in her right breast, but she knew it could kill her.  She was 33 at the time, the mother of a two-year-old daughter. <p>"I thought it was a death sentence," Pam recalls.  "I didn't know anyone who had had it, and I was really ignorant.  The first thought that came to my mind was my daughter, that I wasn't going to be around to see her grow up."<p>That was 11 years ago.  Today Pam is cancer free and one of thousands who have survived the disease--a number that is growing as breast cancer is detected and treated earlier.<p>The five-year survival rate for localized breast cancer (cancer that has not spread to other organs) has risen from 78 percent in the 1940s to 91 percent today, according to the American Cancer Society (ACS).  If the cancer is localized, the survival rate approaches 100 percent, which is why early detection is so important.  If it has spread, or metastasized, throughout the body, the survival rate drops to 18 percent.<p>Breast cancer lags only behind lung cancer as the leading cause of cancer death among women in the United States.  The ACS estimates that 44,500 women died from breast cancer in 1991.  Although the incidence is increasing--one out of nine women will develop breast cancer--mortality rates have remained fairly stable over the past 50 years due to early detection and improved treatment.<p>Women who have had a previous breast cancer or who have a sister, mother or grandmother who has had breast cancer are considered to have the highest risk for developing the disease.<p>Pam's 66-year-old mother, Bettye Miller, had a breast removed five months ago after a mammography showed a cluster of microcalcifications and a biopsy indicated that the cells were malignant.<p>"My prayers had always been that if it happened again, let it be me and not Pam," Bettye says.  "I was frightened, but as soon as I found out it hadn't spread, I was relieved."<p>The risk of getting breast cancer is slightly greater for women who have not had children or who had their first child after age 30, and in women who have prolonged exposure to estrogen stimulation during their menstrual years--those who go through late menopause (after the age of 50) or who started menstruation early (before age 12).  <p>This does not mean, however, that estrogen replacement therapy often prescribed to women at menopause poses a risk, says Antoinette Ripepi, MD, a surgeon at Methodist who treats many breast cancer patients.  "There's no evidence that supplemental estrogens increase your risks," she says.<p>Diet may also play a role in breast cancer.  In Asian countries, where people typically eat food that is lower in fat, breast cancer is less common, says Peter Fisher, MD, a surgeon and member of Methodist's Cancer Committee.<p>A study of Japanese women who immigrated to the United States found they had a higher incidence of breast cancer after 10 years in America, where they ate foods higher in fat.  The average American woman's fat intake is about 40 percent of total calories.  Fisher says there is sketchy evidence that a high fiber diet can help protect against breast cancer, but that vegetables high in selenium, a trace element found in many green vegetables and beans, can be protective.  "That's not to be construed that people should run out to health food stores and buy selenium," he adds, explaining that it can be toxic in high doses and is most effective when consumed by eating vegetables.<p>Other studies have shown that consuming three to four alcoholic drinks a day over an extended period can hike the incidence of breast cancer by about 10 percent, Fisher says.<p>Stress, which can also affect the body's immune system and lower its ability to fight off disease, can also be a factor.  "There's a bit of unscientific but persuasive evidence that stress may play a role," says Fisher.  "We're talking big-time stress, such as losing a mate or losing a job.  But I don't know that it's unique to breast cancer."<p>Breast cancer incidence rates have increased about 3 percent a year since 1980.  "We don't know exactly why," Fisher says.  "We're diagnosing breast cancer earlier because we're looking earlier.  Women are living longer, and the incidence of breast cancer seems to increase with age."<p>Women in high risk groups, particularly those with a personal or family history of breast cancer and women over 50, should be especially vigilant in looking for warning signs.  But all women need to practice early detection methods.
<p>The ACS recommends a monthly breast self-examination by all women 20 years old or older.  "That's important, because despite all of our technology the great majority of breast cancers are still discovered by the patients themselves," says Fisher.  He suggests doing a monthly exam when menstruation ceases so it is done at the same time every month and at a time when the breasts are less tender.<p>Women need to do exams regularly so they are familiar with their breasts and can recognize changes.  Lumps in the breast, spontaneous nipple discharge, dimpling and inverted nipples can be signs of cancer.<p>Pam's first indication was a knot in her upper breast which her husband discovered.  Her gynecologist ordered a mammogram, a low-dose X-ray of the breast, but no cancer was detected.  Within six months her nipple had inverted.  Her doctor immediately sent her to Ripepi, who suspected a malignant tumor during her examination.  A needle biopsy confirmed her suspicions.  <p>"Of course I wanted to believe it wasn't anything," Pam says.  "I was in good health otherwise and felt back then that if you have cancer you should feel real sick."<p>If a woman is suspicious about a change in her breast, she should be examined by a doctor, preferably one who has done yearly breast exams and is familiar with her, and so can better detect changes, says Ripepi.  <p>Self-exams can be confusing to women with fibrocystic breasts, a non-cancerous condition that occurs in 50 percent of women in their reproductive years.  Fibrocystic changes occur when breast tissue responds to monthly changes in levels of estrogen and progesterone, female hormones produced by the ovaries during the reproductive years.<p>Women with fibrocystic breasts often have lumpy, tender breasts and may have discomfort or even severe pain during their menstrual cycle, another reason why self-examination is recommended after a woman's period. To deal with fibrocystic discomfort, Fisher recommends a low-fat diet, a decrease in caffeine, which tends to make breasts hurt more, and an increase in Vitamin E intake.<p>Pam acknowledges that she still has trouble with her self-exams because of her fibrocystic condition.  "I don't know if I'd know a change or not.  I'm lumpy all the time," she says.  "It is a concern."<p>Women with this condition should be even more diligent about having any suspicions checked out by a physician.  "It's easy to fall through the cracks and think it's just another lump," says Fisher.  "The earlier one detects cancer, the better the chances of curing and the less severe the treatment."<p>Another step in a woman's arsenal against breast cancer should be a mammogram, which is recommended every year for women over 50.  The ACS and the American College of Radiology recommends that a baseline mammogram be done between ages 35 and 39, and then every year or two for women ages 40 to 49.<p>According to Methodist radiologist H.D. Rutherford, mammography can detect calcifications as small as .1 centimeter, the size of a pin head.  Women doing self exams usually don't find cancerous masses until they're at least eight times that size.<p>To get a comprehensive picture, X-rays are taken of the breast while it is compressed both horizontally and then vertically.  While some women find the procedure uncomfortable, it is rarely painful.  The dose of radiation is so low there are no harmful effects from the mammogram, Rutherford explains.<p>Mammography is most effective in women who have gone through menopause because their breasts contain less glandular tissue and more fat than a pre-menopausal woman.  "It's like looking at something laying on a white sheet as opposed to a background of pebbles and gravel," Rutherford says.  "It's easier to read."Methodist performs about 10,000 mammograms a year.  About 5 percent of those are diagnosed as malignant.  While that figure is more than twice as high as in the general female population, Rutherford explains, women coming to Methodist usually have been referred after a warning sign has already been detected.  Methodist's Cancer Center maintains a cancer registry with more than 17,000 cases in its data base.  It offers a cancer information telephone line, coordinates support groups for cancer patients, puts on educational programs for hospital staff, and maintains a cancer information library.<p>If breast cancer is diagnosed, a number of treatment options are available.  In Pam's case 11 years ago, surgery revealed that the cancer had spread to a lymph node.<p>"I didn't really have a choice," Pam recalls.  "The whole breast had to be removed.  There weren't any options really because the tumor was so large."<p>To make sure no cancer remained, she underwent chemotherapy for nine months, followed by four weeks of radiation.  She wears a prosthesis and briefly considered breast reconstruction about five years ago, but she decided against it after being told she would have to undergo three more complicated surgeries.  <p>"My husband and I haven't had a problem with it (the loss of her breast)," she says.  "I've never felt any decrease in his love or affection for me since the surgery.  Dr. Ripepi did such a good job, I can wear a scoop neck or a bathing suit and be comfortable.  For me, it hasn't affected my self esteem."Up until 30 years ago, standard treatment for breast cancer was a radical mastectomy, which removed the breast, lymph nodes and underlying chest muscles.  Prior to that, breast cancer was almost universally fatal.<p>"I haven't done a radical mastectomy in 20 years," Fisher says, noting that such drastic measures are rarely needed today because cancer is detected so much earlier.<p>Today's technology offers treatments ranging from mastectomy, to lumpectomy (local removal of the tumor), to radiation therapy, chemotherapy and hormone manipulation therapy, or a mixture of treatments.  Most patients receive some form of follow-up therapy after surgery as a safeguard against cancer recurrence.While total breast removal continues to be the treatment of choice, lumpectomies coupled with other therapies are also common, says Ripepi.  "It depends on the staging of the cancer and the potential for recurrence."<p>Radiation therapy uses radiation to kill cancer cells, usually in a localized area.  Its most common side effect is a slight burning of the skin, like a sunburn.  Chemotherapy uses a combination of drugs to kill wandering cancer cells throughout the body and is often accompanied by nausea, weakness and hair loss.  Hormone therapy involves the use of a synthetic agent to block the cancer-stimulating action of estrogen.<p>Occasionally radiation therapy or chemotherapy is used prior to surgery to shrink a large tumor, making it more manageable for the surgeon to remove.<p>Pam has had several scares since her initial cancer diagnosis, but all have been unfounded.  "Any time I have an ache or pain, I worry that it's cancer.  I think if it came back again, I don't know if I could handle it as well as the first time," she says, recalling the days she retreated into the shower to cry alone and the times she lay in bed, weak after a chemotherapy treatment, quietly playing Barbie dolls with her daughter.  "I had a two-year-old that I had to get well for."<p>Pam urges women to be aware of their family history, do self- exams, and follow the American Cancer Society's guidelines on getting mammograms.  She also believes women should request regular thorough breast examinations by their doctor.  "I don't think you should be shy or embarrassed.  You need to get past that," she says.  <p>And she knows.  Pam survived to see her daughter earn academic honors in her eighth grade class and sing in the school choir.  "Chances of survival are so wonderful if you catch it early--if you don't wait."<p>Reprinted from The Journal, The Methodist Hospital's quarterly magazine.<p>

<title>Methodist Scoop - Methodistís Bone Marrow Program Receives Accreditation for Non-Related Donors, Too</title>

<font size=+3><b> Methodistís Bone Marrow Program Receives Accreditation for Non-Related Donors
</b></font>
<hr size=6></h1></center><p>
</font>

The Methodist Hospitalís Bone Marrow program has recently received accreditation from the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) to perform marrow transplants between patients and donors who are not related.
<p>
The NMDP maintains a registry of volunteers willing to be marrow donors.  This network includes more than 70 transplant centers throughout the United States.  Each center must meet strict guidelines to be approved as a NMDP site.
<p>
Methodist has the only program in Houston to be accredited for all three components of the transplant process -- donor registration, donor collection and transplants from unrelated donors.
<p>
There are basically two types of marrow transplants:  autologous and allogenic.
<p>
Autologous marrow transplants involve removing a portion of the patientís own marrow, storing it and returning it to the patient after the patient undergoes high doses of chemotherapy and/or radiation.
<p>
Allogenic marrow transplants use marrow from a person other than the patient.  A donor can be a family member or someone unrelated to the patient. 
<p>
Approximately 30 percent of those considering a transplant will find a matched donor within their families.  If a match with a relative is unsuccessful, then a nationwide search begins for a volunteer whose marrow matches the patientís.
<p>
The chances of finding an unrelated donor vary widely, depending on the rarity of the patientís tissue type.  However, once a match is found, that volunteerís marrow may be the only lifesaving option for the patient.
<p>
In many cases, unrelated donor marrow transplants offer the only possible cure for many fatal blood diseases.
<p>
For more information on Methodistís Blood and Marrow Program, call 713/790-3969.  To learn about being listed by the NMDP as a potential volunteer bone marrow donor, call 713/790-3127.

<title>Healthwatch - Smokeless Tobacco: The Dipper's Dilemma</title><center><font size=+1><img src=/methodist/health.jpg><br><h1><hr size=6><font size=+3><b>Smokeless Tobacco: The Dipper's Dilemma</b></font><hr size=6></h1></font></center>
Summary: <ul>
Smokeless tobacco products contain larger amounts of cancer-causing chemicals than
          cigarettes. These chemicals are absorbed through the mouth and stomach and stay in
          the bloodstream longer. Today, smokeless tobacco use is one of the leading causes of
          oral cancer. Each year, more than 30,000 new oral cancers are detected in the United
          States; about one-third of these result in death. For the complete article,
  keep reading.</ul><p><p>
Clint Eastwood stands tall and poised, ready to go for his gun.  He sizes up the bad guy, chewing methodically on the wad of tobacco in his cheek. <p>In another showdown, a baseball pitcher reads a signal from the catcher's mitt, then prepares to blast a fast one past the steely-eyed batter.  Stepping back for the throw, he pauses for a quick spit.<p>Texas is known for its heroes.  And its heroes are known for chewing tobacco.  It may add a certain mystique, but there's nothing mystical about the havoc it can wreak in their mouths. <p>"Smokeless tobacco kept in the mouth or chewed is more dangerous than a cigarette," says Cheryl Bressler, clinical supervisor of Methodist's Otorhinolaryngology Acute Care Unit.  On her unit, she treats many patients who have oral cancer.  Many of them are young men.<p>Bressler is actively involved in a local effort to educate people about the dangers of using smokeless tobacco.  Her message may be startling to some, but not as shocking as the age of some of the "users" she's met.  <p>	"I've talked to a 6-year-old boy who used it regularly," says Bressler, "so I now target elementary and middle school children."<p>Her message is straightforward.  "Chewing or dipping tobacco is a dangerous habit that's hard to break," says Bressler.  And it is not a safe alternative to smoking cigarettes.   In fact, smokeless tobacco products contain larger amounts of cancer-causing chemicals than those found in cigarettes.  These chemicals are absorbed through the mouth and stomach and stay in the bloodstream longer.<p>"It may not cause any major health problems initially," Bressler says, "but continued use can cause cancer."  And cancer is a word even first-graders understand.<p>Smokeless tobacco use is one of the leading causes of oral cancer.  Each year, more than 30,000 new oral cancers are detected in the United States.  About one-third of these result in death.<p>"If you look inside a dipper's mouth, you may see a white patch or sore where they keep the tobacco between their cheek and gum," Bressler explains.  "The white patch, called leukoplakia, will be wrinkled, hardened, or cracked.  In time, it could turn into cancer."<p>It doesn't take long for a dipper to discover danger signs.  Leukoplakia can develop after just a few months of use, so dippers should examine their mouth, lips, and tongue daily for warning signs.<p>Sores that bleed easily or don't heal, a sore throat, pain in chewing and swallowing food, or sore or red gums may be a danger sign.  If any of these are present, the dipper should see a doctor.<p>Bressler is a member of the Society of Otorhinolaryngology/Head and Neck Nurses, a national organization committed to the education of young people about the dangers of smokeless tobacco use.When she and other member nurses meet with students, they emphasize the harmful cosmetic aspects of smokeless tobacco use.  Continued use causes bad breath and can permanently stain teeth.  Long-time users have receding gums and sores or blisters on their gums, lips, and tongues.<p>"Even with all that information, it's tough for a long-time user to quit," Bressler adds.  "Nicotine in smokeless tobacco is just as addictive as it is in cigarettes."So Bressler offers a nine-inning "game plan" to kick the habit:<p><li> First Inning -- Decide to quit;<li> Second Inning -- Pick a quit day;<li> Third Inning -- Cut back before your quit day;<li> Fourth Inning -- Build a support team of family and friends;<li> Fifth Inning -- On quit day, get your teeth cleaned and keep yourself busy with new routines;<li> Sixth Inning -- Plan ahead for your first week;<li>Seventh Inning -- Learn how to conquer temptation;<li>Eighth Inning -- Keep up your guard and be mentally prepared for slips;<li> Ninth Inning -- Celebrate your success and offer your support to friends and teammates who are also trying to quit.<p>	"Smokeless tobacco is dangerous and addictive," says Bressler.  "I can't think of two better reasons to put that little tin can in the trash."<p>Reprinted from The Journal, The Methodist Hospital's quarterly magazine.<p><hr size=4></font><center><b><A HREF="/~imagemap/mhsmall"><IMG SRC="/methodist/icon/m-menu.gif" ISMAP border=0></a>

<title>Healthwatch - What is a Pap Test?</title><center><font size=+1><img src=/methodist/health.jpg><br><h1><hr size=6><font size=+3><b>What is a Pap Tests</b></font><hr size=6></h1></font></center>
Summary: <ul>

The Pap test became a regular part of gynecologic examinations in the United States
          during the 1950s. Its importance in detecting cancer of the cervix is widely known.
          What isn't widely known--for most women--is how early in life it should first be given,
          how regularly, and how long it should go on. For the complete article,


  keep reading.</ul><p><p>

"The Pap test remains the single most effective screening tool in gynecologic oncology," says Alan L. Kaplan, MD, a specialist in gynecologic cancer at The Methodist Hospital.  "It should be part of every woman's annual pelvic exam."<p>The Pap test became a regular part of gynecologic examinations in the United States during the 1950s.  Its importance in detecting cancer of the cervix is widely known.  What isn't widely known--for most women--is how early in life it should first be given, how regularly, and how long it should go on.  The bottom line is that women should all have a lot more experience with Pap tests than we do.<p>The Pap test, or smear, was named after Greek physician George N. Papanicolaou, who discovered that cervical cancer sheds malignant cells into vaginal fluid.  To obtain samples, he devised a very simple and painless test that involves scraping a few cells off the cervix.  When examined under a microscope, the sample or "smear" reveals cell changes that are associated with both cancer and infection.<p>When the Pap smear was first introduced, cervical  cancer caused more deaths among women than any other type of malignancy.  Today, it ranks third.  Wide use of the simple test has reduced the incidence of invasive cervical cancer by about 75 percent.  The American Cancer Society estimates that only 4,500 women will die of the disease this year, most of whom have not had Pap tests regularly.<p>The reason American statistics on cervical cancer look so good is not so much because cervical cancer is being cured but because its development is being prevented.  Kaplan explains that this progress results from the ability to identify and treat cell abnormalities called "dysplasia," which are associated with precancerous conditions.  <p>Once the precancerous condition has been identified, the abnormal cells can usually be removed painlessly during an office visit.  One technique is to destroy the cells through "cryotherapy," the application of a low temperature probe that basically freezes them.  At the opposite end of the spectrum, laser surgery burns the deformed cells off with a beam of light.  In some cases, the physician may recommend a "cone biopsy," performed on an outpatient basis.  A wedge-shaped piece of tissue is removed to facilitate a definitive diagnosis and, at the same time, act as a cure.<p>But when to start having the Pap test?  Raymond H. Kaufman, MD, chief of Methodist's Obstetrics and Gynecology Service, advises women to begin having the Pap test at the onset of sexual activity, or age 20, and to repeat it annually throughout their lives. <p>"Women who have had a hysterectomy should probably still have regular Pap smears," adds Kaplan.  "Although only the vagina remains, and problems rarely occur there, most physicians continue to take smears from the upper vagina.  It's a very inexpensive and accurate way to discover potential problems."<p>Along with detecting cancerous changes in the cervix, the Pap smear may also reveal abnormal cells from the vagina, uterus and, in rarer cases, fallopian tubes or ovaries.  The lack of irregular bleeding--the hallmark symptom of gynecologic cancer--makes ovarian cancer lethal: it is the fourth leading cause of death in women.  Its later symptoms, vague abdominal pain, distention, and constipation, closely mimic those of gastrointestinal disorders.  Months may pass before a correct diagnosis is made.  A pelvic exam coupled with a Pap test may be the only way to detect ovarian cancer.The importance of the Pap smear as a screening device has increased with rising levels of early sexual activity in the United States.  It reveals not only potential cancers but also the presence of certain infections, including yeast, fungus, herpes, and the human papilloma virus (HPV).  A life-long infection harbored by both men and women, HPV is usually transmitted sexually and may cause genital warts.  The likelihood of getting the virus increases with the number of sexual partners a person has, and some 10 to 30 percent of sexually active Americans are infected.  <p>A significant number of women who have dysplasia or cancer also have the virus, and researchers have suggested that infection with certain HPV types may be a risk factor for cervical cancer.  As a precaution, a patient who has the virus should be closely monitored for signs of dysplasia.<p>It takes many years for cervical cells to evolve into dysplasia and then cancer, and even then they multiply slowly.  Still, if left undetected they will inevitably begin to invade surrounding tissue, spreading through the uterus, the pelvis, the vagina, the reproductive organs, and beyond.  Except for irregular bleeding, vague pain in the abdomen, distention, and constipation, there may be no unusual symptoms until the disease has progressed to the point where the likelihood of a cure is greatly decreased. <p>All it takes to avoid this danger and discomfort is the Pap smear, an easy, accurate, and painless procedure that costs less than a haircut.  For the sexually active adolescent, the elderly, and every woman in between, it's really quite a bargain.<p>Reprinted from The Journal, The Methodist Hospital's quarterly magazine.<p><hr size=4></font><center><b><A HREF="/~imagemap/mhsmall"><IMG SRC="/methodist/icon/m-menu.gif" ISMAP border=0></a>

Summary: <ul>
When a person suffers a traumatic head injury, the damage can manifest in a variety of
          ways. It can result in epilepsy, cognitive, mood or behavioral disorders; it can disrupt
          families. For neuropsychiatrists, the symptoms displayed by victims of traumatic head
          injury -- including depression, confusion, hallucinations, irritability, loss of ability to
          control temper and anger, problems with memory, disorientation, decreased ability to
          concentrate, loss of ability to use math or abstract logic, and problems with
          interpersonal relationships -- offer important clues about the injury and what kind of
          treatment is needed. For the complete article,

Between the eighth and ninth grades, the young girl began acting in inexplicable ways. Her grades fell from As to Ds. She hung out with troublemakers and shunned her old friends.<P>She couldn't keep two things on her mind at once, was easily frustrated, and flew into rages. <P>Her physician father feared he was seeing something far worse than teen rebellion and asked a colleague for help.  Stuart Yudofsky, MD, chief of The Methodist Hospital's Psychiatry Service, evaluated the girl.  With the help of a psychologist who specializes in neurological testing, Yudofsky confirmed the father's suspicion: she had brain damage.<P>Further questioning revealed she had been in a car accident two years earlier, a fact she had hidden from her parents to protect the driver.  She revealed she bumped her head in the accident, shrugging off the seemingly slight injury.  Eventually her headaches disappeared. The damage didn't.<P>Brain injuries from motor vehicle accidents are a leading cause of death in people under the age of 35. But it can wreak havoc at any age, materializing as headaches, epilepsy, cognitive or behavioral disorders or in roundabout ways.<P>"Brain damage frequently leads to emotional disorders in patients and disruptions for families," says Yudofsky. "Any sudden, profound change in behavior, mood or intellectual functioning should signal the need to seek medical advice."<P>Sometimes, the injury is not so obvious and identifiable as a car accident.  In cases such as fistfights, high-contact sports (boxing and football), motorcycle accidents, drug and alcohol abuse, symptoms may arise years after the actual injury and be difficult to diagnose.<P>Enter neuropsychiatry, a subspecialty that includes both psychiatrists and neurologists with a mission to explore problems and dysfunctions in the grey zone between the mind and the brain.  Its domain includes patients with cognitive, emotional or behavioral disorders linked to brain abnormalities.<P>While the field has been around for 200 years, only in the last few decades have new technology and ambitious research offered physicians a more sophisticated understanding of the brain's biology.  This understanding has enhanced physicians ability to diagnose and effectively treat patients.<P>In the past, neuropsychiatry was overshadowed by advances in psychoanalytic theory and practice. Emotional disorders were worked out through analysis, and medication was popularly avoided because it would mask symptoms and encourage patients to rely on pills to dispel problems.<P>Now, psychiatrists can prescribe medications to safely and effectively treat many disorders with biological causes.  In addition to the medication, they use talk therapy as well to treat these conditions. <P>Many neurologic and psychiatric disorders were once classified by their most prominent symptoms: Alzheimer's by dementia, schizophrenia by delusions or hallucinations, Parkinson's by its palsy.  Treatments were aimed only at the primary symptoms, the logic being if the primary symptom can be cured, the others may follow.<P>But with a clearer picture of the brain and its structure, physicians now know these diseases stem from a combination of physical and mental causes, with multiple symptoms. Mind and matter are inextricably linked.<P>While the brain is encased in the protective shell of the skull, brain matter itself is pliable--a bundle of billions of nerve cells called neurons.  Damage to brain cells can result in mild confusion to complete disruption of normal mental functioning.<P>Penetrating injuries, such as a gunshot wound, can destroy entire areas of the brain or simple control mechanisms for other areas.  Closed-head injuries can result in contusions, bruises of the brain often associated with significant disability and even death.  Hypoxia, the loss of oxygen to the brain, can result in the release of natural substances that damage or kill brain cells. <P>Whiplash from a motor vehicle accident can cause diffuse damage to the brain's white matter, resulting in a range of movement, sensory or psychological problems.<P>Trauma can also alter the brain's tissue and chemistry. The brain's neurons communicate with each other via chemical messengers called neurotransmitters.  Anything that disturbs the delicate balance of this chemistry--disease processes, strokes, tumors, for example--alter the way in which the brain controls our mood and behavior. <P>  Neuropsychiatrists are tipped off to what changes have occurred in the brain after disease or injury by a patient's symptoms.  And there are many:  depression; confusion; hallucinations; irritability; a loss of ability to control temper and anger; problems with memory; disorientation; decreased ability to concentrate, use math or abstract logic; problems with interpersonal relationships.<P>Symptoms sometimes offer a clue if brain injury has occurred, and where.  Previous personality problems or traits are often magnified after traumatic brain injury. If patients were aggressive, suspicious, or melancholy before trauma, following it these symptoms are usually much more prominent and disabling.<P>"Part of the brain's function is to put the brakes on inappropriate feelings," says Chris Sermas, MD, a psychiatrist on Methodist's staff.  "If damage affects this 'pressure valve' that controls emotions, feelings can explode."<P>If cognitive losses occur, patients may remember where they were born and who they married but forget where they put their keys or where they are going as they step out the door.<P>They may be unable to keep up with previous levels of school or work performance, and compensate, as Yudofsky's ninth grader did, by making new friends with lower expectations and developing a corresponding self-concept.<P>Injuries to the front part of the brain, which controls social propriety, can cause the bizarre personality changes called frontal lobe syndrome. Cognitive functions may stay intact but patients may become volatile or uncharacteristically lewd, making sexual advances in church, for example. They may lose interest in their appearance and hygiene, become boisterous or start taking unusual risks. A classic symptom is apathy, a general indifference to the consequences of one's behavior.<P>Sermas was called to see an elderly lady who appeared normal except for minor depression, forgetfulness, and difficulty walking. She cheered up once doctors treated her depression, but she still refused to go out--she had trouble getting around and kept forgetting where she wanted to go. Tests hadn't turned up significant problems.<P>Acting on a hunch, Sermas consulted a neurologist, who did a spinal tap and drew off extra fluid. His hunch was right. The woman had a condition that caused her body to produce too much spinal fluid, and the resulting pressure on her brain caused the unwanted symptoms.<P>"When she recovered from the spinal tap, she got up and was so thrilled to find she could walk normally, she did a little dance around the room. It was like a scene from a movie," Sermas says. "Simple solutions to multiple problems don't always happen.  But when they do, it's very gratifying."<P>Another patient in her late 50s, who previously was very outgoing, suddenly lost interest in everything. "She didn't want to get dressed in the morning, do her hair, put on makeup or bathe," says Sermas. "All she cared to do was sit around the house in her dressing gown and read the newspaper. The family got particularly alarmed when she didn't get up to use the toilet and urinated on the furniture."<P>The family took her to a urologist who declared everything shipshape. Doctors started entertaining the idea that she might be depressed. She saw a psychiatrist and was put on anti-depressant medications.<P>"Not much happened," Sermas continues, "except she seemed to get a little worse."  Speaking with her in the hospital, Sermas was struck by her blandness.<P>"The key was when she said, `What's the fuss? Everything is okay,' instead of `I just don't care anymore. What's the point of going on?' which is what one usually hears from a depressed patient."<P>A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a benign tumor sitting between her frontal lobes, growing into the cleavage between them. "She had a frontal lobe syndrome," Sermas explains. Neurosurgeons removed the tumor and she recuperated. The lesson to physicians?  Diagnosis comes before treatment; and don't give up.<P>The Most Important Aspect: A Multidiscplinary Team<P>Yudofsky has devoted much of his research and study to the prevention of traumatic brain injuries and to the testing and use of medications to treat the results of brain injury. <P> He is Chairman of the American Psychiatric Association's Task Force on traumatic brain injury and is director of their course on psychiatric aspects of traumatic brain injury, taught at the Association's annual meeting.  Yudofsky is also co-editor of The Textbook of Neuropsychiatry, the worlds largest-selling textbook on this subject.<P>Yudofsky feels Methodist's role is vital in dealing with conditions such as head injury because it can pool its special resources and medical experts from many disciplines.  For success, however, every patient's team must also include family, friends, and co-workers. <P>"A team approach requires coordination and deciding on one professional to take the lead," says Yudofsky, "It's most costly not to use a multi-specialty approach because vast areas of the problem might not be addressed--which can undermine a patient's progress."<P>So how does the team even begin to address whether emotional or behavioral changes are caused by an underlying brain injury?<P>First, they take a history from the patient and from those closest to the patient: family, friends and co-workers.<P>"Patients can be forgetful or lose awareness of social propriety," Sermas says. "Others may see him exhibiting bizarre behavior, while the patient thinks, `What's the big deal?'"<P>Then, testing begins.  Among the many diagnostic tools used is the electroencephalogram (EEG).  The EEG can pick up pathological processes but not the exact nature of the problem, except in the case of epilepsy. It can localize the damage if, for example, abnormal brain waves are found on one side of the brain.<P>Pictures of the brain can be taken using CT scans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scan, which shows hot and cold spots and indicates abnormal function and structures.<P>Should all state-of-the-art psychiatric evaluations include testing for some type of brain injury?  "If this is the first episode of a major psychiatric illness in an individual," Sermas says, "it's an excellent idea, especially if you include an EEG and brain scanning to make sure there isn't a disease process going on, or past brain damage. If, however, a person has a well-documented injury and is 10 years into their illness, all that investigating may not be necessary.<P>Psychologists are called in to give tests that measure IQ: thinking, cognition, memory and problem solving, as well as personality structure."This can point out deficit areas and estimate changes that may have occurred," Sermas says.  "Psychologists can interview the patient to get a feel for major areas of concern. They may recommend behavioral or cognitive therapy--the training of a new part of the brain to take up the work lost in a damaged part."<P>The Occupational Therapy staffs of Methodist's Physical Medicine or Psychiatry services may also evaluate the patient.  Each has its own emphasis.<P>The Physical Medicine rehabilitation staff assesses the ability to do everyday activities: dress, button and zip clothing, tie shoes, cook, use utensils, bathe and walk.  Patients may forget how to do basic things or develop an impaired gait (walk)--indicating damage to the part of the brain controlling motor coordination and strength.<P>Psychiatry's Occupational Therapy service assesses other practical matters: Can you find your way around a kitchen? Can you operate a stove and oven? Can you play a musical instrument or balance a checkbook? What would you do if you were in your home and you smelled smoke? What does 911 mean?<P>"The staff then recommends practical, achievable things to return a measure of control to patients' lives that might otherwise have been lost," Sermas explains. "The biggest thing brain-injured patients must face is that they've lost something: independence, ability, or self-sufficiency.  These assessments can help give it back."<P>Damage to certain brain areas can affect one's ability to connect with the outside world.  Imagine only being able to communicate by phone and discovering the phone lines have gone down for good.<P>"The most frustrating thing about brain injury may be to hear words and not be able to put them together," says Sermas, "or to want to ask a question and not be able to, because the connection between a thought and the part of the brain that regulates the mouth and tongue has been broken." <P>Speech pathologists assess how well patients receive, process and respond to spoken and written communications.  They also help patients channel mental energies into new directions to make up for deficits.<P>"A very vulnerable aspect of the injured brain is memory, especially short-term memory," notes Sermas. "The long-term stuff tends to be stored in concrete upstairs. For short-term losses, they find common-sense ways to compensate, such as keeping pens and notepads by phones. Since the brain has difficulty making the record, you make the record. The difference is where it's registered."<P>Rehabilitation for every case is different, and consequences depend upon a patient's condition, occupation, and expectations. A mild injury affecting one's ability to calculate and use abstractions would be severely disabling for a scientist or a tax accountant, less so for an athlete or construction worker, one who relies on sensory motor functioning.<P>Along with occupational and speech therapy and physical rehabilitation, a psychiatrist is often consulted about the use of medications for brain-damaged patients.<P>"We're finding that medications originally intended for the treatment of high blood pressure or depression may play a role in the treatment of brain-injured patients," says Yudofsky, who did some of the original clinical investigation in this area.<P>"For instance, in aggression that occurs after brain injury, an anti-hypertensive agent works extremely well to help certain patients control their angry emotions and violent behavior."<P>Medications originally used to treat patients' schizophrenia are also helpful for patients in whom brain damage has caused difficulty in perceiving and dealing with reality.<P>"These patients can sometimes be very paranoid, because an injury damages the ability to test reality," Sermas says. "When a patient can't understand the world, one stance is to be afraid of it. If everyone's trying to get you, you don't have to try to figure things out. It simplifies things in one way, but makes it very difficult for a medical team or family members to deal with the patient." <P>One thing traumatic brain injury doesn't have in common with other diseases or injuries is that often people feel responsible, or blame others, for their condition.<P>Not uncommonly after traumatic brain injury, profound changes occur to patients interpersonal skills, career options, and long-term goals.  Feelings of guilt and punishment may arise in those responsible for accidents as well as their victims, especially if injury has resulted from risk-taking behavior or carelessness, no matter how innocent, says Yudofsky.<P>"Patients mourn the loss of their former selves and their prior level of functioning," he continues. "Grief and frustration may find release in blaming and finger-pointing.  Patients may replay in their minds an accident again and again, imaginatively trying to change the tragic outcome."  In these cases, it is the psychiatrist's task to help patients come to terms with their changed level of functioning and to guide them away from negative, destructive behaviors, and toward healthful, constructive rebuilding of their lives.<P>According to Yudofsky and Sermas, many types of traumatic brain injury are avoidable.<P>"The number one risk factor is alcoholism," Yudofsky says. "Alcohol is involved in more than half of all car-related head injuries and many motorcycle and all-terrain vehicle acidents as well .  Alcohol also increases the risk of stroke and brain injuries from fighting."<P>People with high blood pressure can make sure they always take their medicine. If they do, they'll have the same amount of risk for stroke as the general population. If not, their risk increases six-fold. Smokers should take heed: smoking increases blood pressure and the risk of stroke.<P>Seatbelts should be a must for everyone, at all times. It's the best way for adults to prevent head injuries from motor vehicle accidents. Parents should make sure infants and toddlers are strapped in. Studies show car seat restraints -- when used -- are 80 to 90 percent effective in preventing death and severe brain injuries to children.<P>Substance abuse is another preventable factor. Psychiatrists are trained to unmask, counsel and treat self-destructive and addictive behaviors. They can also treat the stress and psychiatric disorders that may lead to brain injury.<P>But even if the brain does sustain injury, there is great hope for patients today. Many neuropsychiatric symptoms can be cured. The depression that accompanies many head injuries often responds to medication and psychotherapy. Other medications can calm irritation, agitation and hallucinations. If damage to one part of the brain makes math calculation difficult, another part of the brain may be trained to compensate for its loss in a process called cognitive rehabilitation.  <P>Psychotherapy, occupational rehabilitation, the involvement of family, friends and co-workers are all vital elements in solving neuropsychiatric problems. With a well-managed multidisciplinary approach, recovery from brain injury is the rule rather than the exception.<P>"You may have a bona fide psychiatric illness for a while, but if you're too quick to put everything under the umbrella of depression or another illness, you may miss a medical neuropsychiatric problem that you could treat and improve a person's life," Sermas says.<P>"Nobody's yet been able to draw a nice line between the brain and the mind; they go together. It all works together."<P>Reprinted from The Journal, The Methodist Hospital's quarterly magazine.<P><hr size=4></font><center><b><A HREF="/~imagemap/mhsmall"><IMG SRC="/methodist/icon/m-menu.gif" ISMAP border=0></a>

Ironically, the smartest organ in our body probably has the most myths surrounding it.  We can't totally blame Hollywood, either--because the brain is the most complex organ in the human body, it is also the most mysterious.<P>So we gathered a list of brain questions and ran them past a few experts from The Methodist Hospital.  Making up our "brain trust" are Stanley Appel, MD, Chief of Neurology at Methodist; Robert Grossman, MD, Chief of the Neurosurgery Service; Bobby Alford, MD, Chief of the hospital's Otorhinolaryngology Service; and Methodist psychiatrist Chris Sermas.<P>Let's see what the experts say:<P>Q.  Is the brain a separate entity from the mind?<P>A.  Grossman: "Philosophers have been debating that question since the time of the ancient Greeks.  No one understands the relationship between the brain and the mind.  We know that if there is damage to the brain, the mind is affected.  But we're unsure where the real connection is."<P>Appel: "As long as the mind isn't in the liver, the adrenal gland, the heart, or the joints, it cannot be a separate entity from the brain."<P>Q.  Is electro-shock therapy (an electric shock delivered to the brain to control behavior or depression) now taboo?<P>A.  Sermas: "Absolutely not.  If anything, it's making a resurgence.  Although there are lots of well-publicized anti-depressent medications, they are probably helpful for serious depression about 70 percent of the time.  There is still a group that won't respond to any medication, and for these people electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is effective most of the time.<P>"We're also finding ECT can be very helpful for other conditions.  For example, Parkinson's disease patients often experience depression.  Sometimes these patients cannot tolerate medications given for Parkinsonism, but they can tolerate the ECT better."<P>Appel: "There is a real positive side to it, but electro-shock therapy has been abused.  And it's the abuse that is called attention to by the popular media.  However, we are still trying to learn as much as we can about electrical stimulation of the brain."<P>Q.  How much oxygen can the brain go without?<P>A.  Grossman: "Not much.  The brain is very dependent on oxygen for its tissues to survive.  In certain situations where the entire body temperature is drastically lowered (such as people who are submerged in very cold water), the brain may need less oxygen because the cellular metabolism is slowed down."<P>Alford: "Under normal circumstances, it's limited to under 10 minutes, depending on the individual.  There are so many variables...but the average is seven to eight minutes for an adult."<P>Q.  Do certain foods enhance brain power?<P>A.  Sermas: "I don't know of any well-documented evidence that brain function can actually be increased by certain foods.  I love salmon and red snapper, and I realize people say fish is a 'brain food.'  Certainly fish is good for keeping your cholestrol down.  And if you eat a lot of fish maybe that means you'll have fewer tiny strokes as you age."<P>Appel: "I would say that a good diet is essential for optimal functioning of the brain.  There's no evidence that other foods, superimposed on that good diet, will enhance brain function beyond what you already have."<P>Q.  Are bigger brains smarter?  Can they hear or see better?<P>Grossman: "Within an individual species, no.  Between species, it is believed that larger brain size and weight corresponds to higher intelligence.  So man is smarter than a dog because our brains are bigger, we think.  But among humans, the size of the brain makes no difference."<P>Q.  Do people automatically begin to lose their hearing when they get older?<P>A.  Alford: "It seems that in the industrialized parts of the world, many people begin to lose their hearing around age 40 to 50.  But in the Third World, there are many who do not.  It depends on the region of the world--some places seem to be worse for this than others.<P>"In these areas, men seem to lose their hearing first.  So it may be work-related, caused by the noise of machines maybe, but it could be diet-related or genetic too.  Take care of your hearing when you're young and you reduce the chances for having problems later in life."<P>Q.  Does "use it or lose it" apply to the brain?<P>Appel: "No question.  The more effectively you use it, the more effectively you will function as you get older.  So those elderly people who stay involved, stay active, and do not limit themselves intellectually will function well as long as they are alive."<P>Sermas: "There was a time when we didn't have older people to study because we weren't living as long as they do today.  Now, however, those who live to be 100 and are mentally healthy seem to be those who do not just sit around the house.  They tend to get out and become engaged in things that keep them stimulated mentally, physically, and socially."<P>Q.  Does the brain deteriorate as it ages?<P>A.  Grossman: "It ages and deteriorates just like any tissue organ in the body.  Neurons (nerve cells) and brain cells die and are compensated for by other cells throughout life.  Perhaps as we age, the process slows down and fewer nerve transmission pathways are available."<P>Q.  Does a gunshot wound to the head mean instant death?<P>A.  Sermas: "No.  Tragically, every doctor has seen patients with gunshot wounds to the head who survived and had a lot to deal with afterwards.  Being alive is one matter, being able to function in society is another.  About the only gunshot wound that is close to being universally fatal is the one where someone puts a gun in their mouth and pulls the trigger.  This trauma blows out the posterior part of the brain which regulates vital functions."<P>Q.  Can you really knock somebody out, like in the movies?  Does it leave permanent brain injury?<P>A.  Appel: "Yes, you can knock someone unconscious with a blow to the head.  A single blow can cause damage, in the form of bleeding inside and outside the brain.  Repeated blows, like that withstood by a boxer, brings with it a likelihood of brain damage.  And some people think it may trigger a process of Alzheimer's disease."<P>Sermas: "One knockout punch may result in just a concussion, which may not be a major problem.  Repeated blows to the head seem to be associated with increased formation of stroke areas, increased incidence of multiple tiny strokes, accelerated rate of brain cell loss, and Parkinson's disease."<P>Reprinted from The Journal, The Methodist Hospital's quarterly magazine.<P> <hr size=4></font><center><b>

One woman's lifelong struggle with multiple sclerosis -- including an entire childhood of
          missed diagnoses -- finally became easier when she enlisted the help Victor Rivera, a
          neurologist at The Methodist Hospital. Since her first visit to Houston in 1980, she has
          taken advantage of her newfound health, becoming an outspoken advocate for the
          disabled. For the complete article,

Deborah McKeithan can fool you because she looks so good.  People tell her that all the time.  On a good day, she agrees with them.  On a bad day, she only wishes she felt the same.  <P>That's the nature of the disease stalking her brain.  It gnaws away inside yet leaves its victims looking great on the outside.  So great that people can't recognize it when they see it.  Not doctors, not even family.<P>Her younger brother once asked her if she would have amounted to anything had she not been born a cripple. <P>"I felt like the weirdo in my family," says Deborah, the middle child of a preacher. "I used to try to be like everyone else and fight for acceptance.  I finally said 'No, fight for your own self.'"<P>Deborah is fighting multiple sclerosis, a fight familiar to 500,000 or so Americans.  It doesn't get instant name recognition like its cousin, ALS.  There's no baseball-hero namesake.  People confuse it with muscular dystrophy, or think it's contagious.  It's neither.  It's a long-term illness, often devastating, but it doesn't kill.  <P>Those living it out in a wheelchair are easily identified as disabled.  Those like Deborah, whose energy animates the most dreary room, make you forget they're ill.  Until it renders them too weak to move, or jars their memory.  Then they're called lazy, or drunk, or psychosomatic.  That's what Deborah's doctors said when they couldn't figure out what was wrong.<P> She spent her adolescence in and out of hospitals.  She missed so much school her dream of being a doctor segued to nursing school, with hopes of working with the terminally ill.  It almost happened, too, but the nursing school faculty didn't think a cripple could cut it.  Nor did the U.S. government.  Or the countless other doctors who thought her only disability was her mind.  <P>Deborah's chronic headaches at age 5 didn't cause suspicion.  Not that they should.  MS rarely strikes people before their 20s, and almost never in the form of a headache.<P>The family physician in Charlotte, North Carolina, promptly cut off her long blonde hair.  Too heavy, he said, that's what's hurting her head.  When that didn't work, he called her psychosomatic.<P>That label stuck for the next 14 years, even through chicken pox that yielded to encephalitis, a 106-degree fever, clumsiness, and vision problems.  At age 13 she looked at her doctor and said, "If it's all in my head, why don't you send me to a psychiatrist?"  It simply reinforced to them that she was a kid looking for attention.<P>Numb hands during her first year in nursing school told her something was wrong, but nothing was going to interfere with school.  Nothing except another massive headache that left her paralyzed on the way to the hospital.  Her brain was swollen,  "mild" hydrocephalus that was apparently missed at birth, doctors said.<P>Spinal fluid swelling her brain left her in a coma.   Part of her skull was removed to control the swelling.<P>She left the hospital at age 19 with a bald head, a permanent shunt to drain excess brain fluid, and a diagnosis of "mild" MS that doctors believed was under control.  The nursing school didn't think it was; besides, she had missed too much school, she'd have to repeat her coursework.  <P>When her headaches recurred, a neurologist in Charlotte became frustrated. Middle-child syndrome.  Just wants more attention, he decided, and convinced her father as well.  When she started seeing double they admitted her back into the hospital, this time on a psychiatric unit.  A nurse wheeled her in front of a mirror, her eyes bulging from brain pressure, and told her how silly she looked.  A psychiatrist passing by realized she was having a stroke and immediately called a neurologist.<P>  Deborah couldn't speak, could barely see, and was bound to her wheelchair.  She wasn't given physical therapy, and speech therapy was taken slowly.  She practiced sculpting with a 25-pound block of clay to keep her thoughts occupied and her hands flexible.  For months she listened to PBS radio, teaching herself to talk again.  <P> When her speech became coherent, she entered the Miss Wheelchair pageant of North Carolina and won first runner up.  In front of 600 people, she gave a speech about making a life for herself and others.  She told them how happy she was to win Miss Congenital.  The audience froze.  Deborah looked at them in horror, then broke into laughter.<P>Laughter restored her confidence.  Laughter kept her going through another serious episode, when her MS was deemed uncontrollable and there was nothing more her doctors would do.  For the fourth time in her life, she was told to get her things in order because she wouldn't live much longer. She was only 24.  <P> She got herself in order.  She learned of a place in Houston that was specializing in MS treatment.  There were good doctors there, doctors who were trying things the rest of the country wasn't.  <P>Her local physician wouldn't give her any names until her mother finally lured it out of him:  Victor Rivera, a neurologist practicing at The Methodist Hospital.  Deborah's mother tracked down the phone number, and they headed to Houston in search of what they couldn't find at home.<P>Multiple Sclerosis is the most common central nervous system disease among young adults in the United States.  <P>Some people never know they have it.  Others have one or several exacerbations.  When that happens, the body's immune system goes into overdrive and attacks the myelin, or covering, that insulates and protects nerves.  <P>  An attack leaves the brain inflamed.  It also leaves lesions on the myelin that form hardened patches of scar tissue called plaques.  Imagine a frayed telephone line that interrupts and distorts your conversation.  It's the same thing with MS.  Damaged myelin short-circuits messages trying to reach the brain -- messages that help you stay balanced, or put one foot in front of the other, or form a sentence. <P>  It's multiple because lesions can occur throughout the brain and spinal cord; it's sclerosis for the plaques of hardened tissue that replace damaged myelin.  Different physical symptoms let doctors know exactly where those plaques are located.  Memory loss or confusion, for example, means they're in the brain; tremors, blurred vision, incoordination, or slurred speech indicates the brain stem; weakness, paralysis or bladder problems implies the motor pathways; tingling and numbness point to sensory pathways.<P>The severity of MS falls along a spectrum.  On one end are the lucky ones whose MS flares up for one or two possibly severe exacerbations, then disappears leaving no trace of illness.  On the other are the few whose symptoms strike and progress rapidly, causing severe, permanent disability. <P>While no one knows what causes MS, more and more studies point to the body's immune system.  Genetics may play some role, but there is no evidence that it is directly inherited.  MS may lie dormant for years without being detected.  Most often, it strikes people between their 20s and 40s, women twice as much as men, whites more than blacks and Asians.  It's found more frequently in people living in colder climates.  It's extremely disabling, but it's not contagious and it's rarely fatal.  Which may be why it's often treated with indifference.<P>Victor Rivera didn't set out to be a rebel.  And The Methodist Hospital didn't anticipate being the country's magnet for MS care.  They simply wanted to make a difference.<P>For decades, the standard treatment for MS in the U.S. was steroids, which helped reduce brain inflammation but didn't do much to keep the disease from progressing.  Europeans were using chemotherapy drugs.<P>According to Rivera, if MS was triggered by a faulty immune system, which was highly suspected, it would probably respond well to chemotherapy.  He started using a new chemotherapy drug, cytoxan, that suppressed the immune system.  No other place in the States had used chemotherapy, and physicians in other medical centers couldn't understand why Methodist was, either. Yet patients were responding.  The cytoxan created a buffer against abnormal antibodies and kept them from attacking the myelin.<P>Ten years later, after the rest of the country had come around to using cytoxan, Methodist was still looking for something better to treat MS.<P>David Huston, MD, an immunology specialist at Methodist, was using cytoxan intravenously on people with lupus, another autoimmune disorder.  It was safer, and it was easy to monitor any side effects.  Rivera tried it on those people with progressive MS and was thrilled with the results.  Patients felt better, stronger, more flexible, and they could move.  It also stabilized the disease's progression.<P>Now patients come to Methodist from across the country, from almost every continent.<P>"We have a group of people from Los Angeles who fly here together every six months for follow-up treatment," Rivera says.  "A very prominent neurologist in L.A. called and asked 'What are you doing differently there?'"<P>Rivera chuckles, then pauses for a minute to consider the answer. <P>"Part of the reason is that our generation was never trained in using drugs that suppressed the immune system," Rivera submits.  "When I was a resident, these drugs either didn't exist, or they were used by cancer specialists, not neurologists.<P>"Even though there's now a tremendous understanding of MS, its treatment still remains a real art," he says.  Because it behaves differently in each person, treatment must be highly individualized.<P>"There are different degrees of MS, and it has multiple symptoms," he explains.  "You must assess what they are so you can treat the MS and its symptoms: the fatigue, the spasticity, the bladder problems." <P>The correct diagnosis of MS and its type is critical in helping physicians gauge an appropriate treatment.  Magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, offers a clear view of brain and spinal lesions.  It also reveals how well or poorly a treatment is working by whether or not the plaque is healing.<P>"The big thing with MS is that it's not totally irreversible, like ALS or Alzheimer's, where you lose nerve cells,"  Rivera says.  "We're not talking about the actual nerves; we're talking about the myelin that covers them, and that can be recovered."  In some cases, the myelin regenerates spontaneously.  In more serious cases, various drugs can reduce inflammation, allowing the lesion to heal and the myelin to restore itself.<P>One such recently FDA-approved drug hit the market last year causing widespread excitement.  Betaseron prevents exacerbations and may, in the long run, cause less side effects for those with remittent MS whose symptoms come and go.  On the flip side, it is very costly, offers no relief to those whose MS is progressive, and is not readily available.  Its limited supply is allotted only to those lucky candidates whose Social Security numbers are randomly selected from a waiting list. <P> But Methodist's artillery doesn't stop with drugs, says neurologist Stanley Appel, who oversees the Neurology Service at Methodist and Baylor College of Medicine.  At least four different studies will hopefully shed light on the disease's cause and cure.  There is also a multiple sclerosis clinic, headed by Methodist neurologist Yadollah Harati.  The clinic is staffed by the same neurologists who practice at Methodist and teach at Baylor College of Medicine.  Patients are seen and treated weekly, including those who have no medical insurance.  A number of them are being started on betaseron.<P>  "We don't just take medicine and put it into our patients like a recipe," Rivera says.  "They feel better, they see results, they get friendly, humane care.  That's why they keep coming here.  They feel like they're home."<P>  The first thing Rivera did when Deborah arrived was determine the extent of her illness.  It hadn't hit her brain stem, but her vision was severely impaired, limited to a  narrow, blurry strip.  <P>She was suffering from optic neuritis, an inflammation of the nerve that controls vision and a classic MS trademark.  <P>"When I saw her, she couldn't walk.  She had all sorts of vision problems, and epilepsy.  Nothing was working for her," Rivera says.  "She also had massive brain swelling, which is very rare in MS."   He gave her a brain diuretic to drain fluid building in her brain that was causing her constant headaches.  Her headaches stopped.<P>Next, he gave her a steroid injection to help her vision.  By the second treatment she could see the subtle print in the wallpaper.  She held her mother and cried.<P>The medications once labeled "too aggressive" kept her exacerbations under control -- they kept her brain from swelling, and they helped control her seizures.  She went home walking with the help of a cane.  That was in 1980.  She's been back since then for follow-up treatments. <P>"Dr. Rivera's been fighting for my life for a long time," Deborah says, matter of factly.  "We've dealt with this together."<P>For the first time in years, Deborah finally had the energy to do something.  She believes Rivera saved her life.  He says he simply gave her the care she needed, the same care all patients should receive. <P>Deborah has worked hard not to let an attitude be her handicap. She's found an answer to her brother's probing question.  <P>Who you were before you became disabled is who you will be, she's learned. Life, she says, can have two purposes: an excuse from, or a reason for. <P>"Some people look for an excuse not to be living, and you give them a disability and they're happy, because they now they have professional 'gonna do,'" Deborah says.  "I was gonna do that..." is unspoken but acknowledged. <P> Or, she continues, life becomes a reason for, "and those are the ones you find within the disabled community educating and changing the world."<P>Deborah's reason for revealed itself when she returned to Charlotte, to a life that now had possibilities.  <P>"Miss Congenital" returned to the strength and support from the friends she made during the pageant.  True to her word, she rallied them to form the country's first chapter of HOW--Handicapped Organized Women--whose motto was "help ourselves by helping others."  They gathered clothing for refugee children, visited newly disabled people at home and in the hospital, paid service calls to the elderly.<P>"It wasn't expected," Deborah says.  "It's not normal for a disabled person to help others, because others are typically wanting to help them."<P>HOW hit the national news.  Major newspapers in New York ran interviews with her.  She was invited, twice, to speak on Sally Jesse Raphael's daytime talk show to explore how disability affects a woman's life.  Sally was so impressed she became a HOW board member.<P> Men were wanting in.  She told them they were invited only when they put on dresses and shaved.  The next meeting, three men came in dresses, clean-shaven, even their legs.  The next week Handicapped Independent Men was born.  "I'm not a woman who goes against my word," Deborah declares.<P>HOW received its first endowment when Deborah won the "Endow A Dream" award from a Chicago philanthropist for overcoming adversity with a positive attitude.  Art Linkletter presented the award, stayed in touch, and encouraged her to do public speaking.<P>	At the time, President Reagan was telling Americans to be more and do more. Deborah was trying, but like many of the disabled she found herself entangled in a Catch-22.  She'd been living on Social Security and disability while turning in her HOW paycheck to the government.  If she gave up Social Security, she'd give up Medicare, a necessity for someone with MS who requires medical support.  Because MS is pre-existing, no insurance plan would take her or anyone else under the same circumstances.<P>Basically, she says, the government was paying the disabled to deteriorate, but the pay was so bad they preferred to work.<P>She drafted a letter to the President requesting that the disabled be allowed to purchase Medicare insurance on a sliding-scale fee. Then, if they could work successfully, they could give up Social Security and keep their health insurance.<P>Wonderful, she says, except how do you get a letter directly to the President?  She dropped a nail file in the envelope.  "My hands shake, and I'm legally blind...you know how these things just slip by," she confesses with feigned innocence.  Two days later, when the metal detectors went off, she got a call from the Secret Service.<P>She was invited to Washington to testify on behalf of the disabled.  The President's Commission recruited her to help draft the Americans with Disabilities Act.  From a simple nail file, Deborah found herself working alongside senators and congressmen, drafting legislation on behalf of the disabled community.  In 1985, the Deborah McKeithan bill was passed, allowing a disabled person to enter the workforce and purchase Medicare insurance on a sliding scale.  Determination helped Deborah McKeithan actually unravel a Catch-22.<P>She wants others to do the same.   "Horses are handicapped, people are disabled" is a motto Deborah uses in her lectures.  In a strange way, her dream of working with the terminally ill has adapted well to this new population. <P>  "I'm telling people who are dealing with the death of their body that they have to live, but their body as they knew it died.  They must get used to this new temple, this new casing, these new abilities," she says.  <P>"Some people never get past it. For others it's a springboard.  Those are the people whose injustices give them a reason for making a difference."<P>Deborah has grown up since that blonde little girl with the cut-off hair.  Much of the time, alone in her hospital bed, she had only herself to talk to.  Now, because of her epilepsy, someone must be near her constantly.<P>"Freedom is a state of mind," says Deborah, who finds solace with the help of Carson, an oversized black Labrador.  Carson lifts a groggy head, glimpses at his charge and, seeing that all is well, surrenders to a Benedryl-induced snooze.  Hay fever is compromising his guide-dog shtick, but they're in Houston for a six-month check up, and somehow he knows Deborah is safe.  He also knows when she's not. <P>"It's the aura," she says.  "He'll come to me as I'm blacking out, nuzzle my hand with his nose, and run for help."  Carson has been specially trained for those with special needs.  He's Deborah's seeing eye dog, he gets help when she's having a seizure, he can stabilize her if she loses her balance.  He's also a great conversation starter, especially when there's a chance to educate.<P>Opportunity strikes at the airport while waiting for her flight back home.  A four-year-old is having a stare down with Carson.  He loosens his grip on mom and gingerly steps up to Deborah.<P>"Is that your dog?" he challenges.  School has started.<P>"Yes, he's my guide dog," Deborah replies.  "He helps me find my way."<P>The little boy is staring now at Deborah.  So are the other passengers waiting for their flight.  Deborah takes off her sunglasses.  "I have multiple sclerosis, and I can't see," she tells him.  He peers into her eyes, confused.  Her eyes are clear and blue.  They look so good.<P>"Why can't you see?" the boy demands, wanting the real answer.  So do the other passengers pretending to read their magazines.  She is deliberate, explaining her illness in terms a child can understand. <P>The boy listens, then reaches for Carson.  The dog backs away -- his harness is on, and he is working.  Deborah removes Carson's harness, and the boy hugs him, satisfied.  So is Deborah.  Thirty or so people have just learned about disability.  They've learned that things aren't always as they look.<P>She gets up to board her flight.<P>"Life is full of detours, but it can be exciting and different if you're open-minded," Deborah surmises. <P>"Some of it has stung," she adds.<P>"Then there are the times when you're meeting a friend for dinner, and the waiter is walking all over the restaurant but he can't find you because he isn't sure what you look like.  And it's because your friend forgot to tell him you're in a wheelchair," says Deborah, sublimely.  "That's joy."<P>For more information, or to contact a physician on The Methodist Hospital's Neurology Service, please call (713) 798-5971.<P>Reprinted from The Journal, The Methodist Hospital's quarterly magazine.<P><hr size=4></font><center><b><A HREF="/~imagemap/mhsmall"><IMG SRC="/methodist/icon/m-menu.gif" ISMAP border=0></a>

<title>Healthwatch - New Treatment for SAH</title><center><font size=+1><img src=../../health.jpg><br><h1><hr size=6><font size=+3><b>New Treatment for SAH</b></font> <hr size=6></h1></font></center>
Summary: <ul>

It strikes suddenly, usually someone who is in the prime of life, 30 to 60 years old, and
          who generally has never been very sick. Half of its victims die within six months. But
          today, new techniques are producing encouraging results for those who suffer a
          subarachnoid hemorrhage. For the complete article,
  keep reading.<br><p></ul><p><p><br hs=180><p>
 "My head felt like it was on fire. I can't describe how awful the pain was."<P>Houstonian Kathy Kilian's recollection could have come from virtually anyone who has endured a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Like others who recall their own experiences, Kilian knows she has joined a growing group of people: survivors.<P>Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is the medical term for bleeding into the narrow fluid-filled space between the brain and the skull. Nationwide, more  than 30,000 people a year have SAH. About 30 percent die almost immediately, and 50 percent die within six months. Of those who survive, as many as 85 percent have some type of neurologic damage.The hallmark symptom is a sudden, excruciating headache, often causing nausea and vomiting.<P>"The pain is so severe that the patient knows it is not an ordinary headache," says Richard L. Harper, MD, a neurosurgeon at The Methodist Hospital. "Those who survive often say they felt like they were going to die. Many people lose consciousness in seconds."<P>The most common cause of SAH is a ruptured aneurysm, which arises from a weak spot in a blood vessel in the brain. The vessel may develop a bulge at the weak site and eventually tear or burst, allowing blood to leak into the subarachnoid space.<P>The second most common cause of SAH is bleeding from an arteriovenous malformation (AVM), a tangled mass of blood vessels in the brain.  Though the vessels have no biologic function, blood flows through them.<P>Aneurysms and AVMs are hereditary disorders that most people are unaware of until bleeding occurs.<P>"The overall clinical picture of the SAH patient is someone who is in the prime of life, 30 to 60 years old, and who generally has never been very sick," Harper says.<P>That picture of health fit Kilian precisely when a ruptured aneurysm brought her to Methodist shortly after Thanksgiving 1990. At the time she was a 45-year-old mother of three, employed in the English Department at the University of Houston.<P>The SAH occurred while Kilian was at work. Though she fell to the floor, she didn't lose consciousness until she arrived at the hospital. When she regained consciousness, she was in the Neurological Intensive Care Unit. It was Thursday, two days after the incident and a day after surgery to eliminate the aneurysm.<P>"When I woke up, I thought I had been in a car accident," Kilian recalls.<P>Instead, she had undergone endovascular treatment to eliminate the aneurysm. Neurosurgery is the most common treatment for brain aneurysms, but a non-surgical technique has produced encouraging results in studies at Methodist and other medical centers.<P>The non-surgical approach involves inserting a wire into a blood vessel and passing a platinum coil on the end of the wire into the aneurysm. A mild electric current sent through the wire releases the coil, which eventually is covered by clot-forming blood cells to seal off the aneurysm.<P>A combination of surgical and non-surgical techniques are often used to treat AVMs. The non-surgical procedure is used to inject a glue-like substance into the AVM to cause the blood to clot.<P>Kilian's SAH left her with blurred vision for a couple of weeks.  But the major effect was a mental fog that lasted well beyond her two-week  hospital stay.<P>"People would say something to me and the words just wouldn't register. I didn't think about anything very much. It was a very strange time," says Kilian. "My husband and children were very patient, which was fortunate, because a lot of patience is needed to help someone get over an experience like this."<P>Perhaps the most obvious change is in Kilian's handwriting, which has notable differences since the SAH. She thinks she can't remember names as well as before the hemorrhage, though friends tell her otherwise.<P>Many SAH survivors are not so fortunate as Kilian, as severe neurologic damage frequently affects both mental and functional abilities. The damage can occur with or without treatment.<P>"The presence of blood outside the vessels in the brain is irritating and can cause spasm of the vessel," says Methodist neurosurgeon David S. Baskin. "After three or four days, the blood vessels can contract and cause a stroke."<P>Baskin is the principal investigator in a study of the drug tirilazad, which might help limit the damage caused by the escaping blood. In preliminary studies, tirilazad has shown potential to limit neurologic damage in head injuries, spinal cord injuries, and stroke, as well as SAH.<P>The key to the drug's potential effectiveness is early treatment, and all patients involved in the study must begin receiving tirilazad within 48 hours after symptoms. Besides assessing the drug's effect on neurologic damage, the study will try to answer questions about the impact of treatment of the cost of care.<P>"For example, do patients who receive an effective treatment take fewer drugs and spend less on medication?" asks Baskin.<P>Quick recognition of SAH symptoms remains a major obstacle to early treatment.<P>"Even though the pain is instantaneous and like nothing they have ever experienced, many people still don't seek medical care immediately," says Harper. "That delay can make a big difference in outcome."<P>Reprinted from The Journal, The Methodist Hospital's quarterly magazine.<P><hr size=4></font><center><b>

<title>Healthwatch - Traumatic Head Injury</title><center><font size=+1><img src=../../health.jpg><br><h1><hr size=6><font size=+3><b>Traumatic Head Injury</b></font> <hr size=6></h1></font></center>
Summary: <ul>

Traumatic head injury kills 96,000 people in the U.S. each year and leaves another
          73,000 with long-term disabilities. The keys to lessening these numbers lie in public
          education about preventive measures and clinical research to develop new, more
          effective treatments for victims. Physicians and researchers at The Methodist Hospital
          and Baylor College of Medicine are working to improve those numbers and, hopefully,
          prevent the injuries from happening in the first place. For the complete article, 
  keep reading.<br><p></ul><p><p><br hs=180><p>
 At The Methodist Hospital and Baylor College of Medicine, there's an all-points bulletin out for Public Enemy Number One.<P>They're trying to stop a killer who is responsible for 96,000 deaths in the United States each year -- nearly twice the number of U.S. soldiers lost in all 10 years of the Vietnam War.  In 1993 alone, they estimate this heartless criminal will put 400,000 in the hospital, leave 73,000 with long-term disabilities, place 2,000 into a permanent vegetative state and cost the country $25 billion in medical costs and lost workers.<P>The fiend's name -- traumatic head injury.<P>Such staggering loss of life and livelihood can only be lessened by two means: research to develop new, more effective treatments and public education to persuade those at risk to take preventive measures.  The specialists with the Head Injury Research Group at Methodist and Baylor are actively involved in both.<P>The Head Injury Research Group was established in 1981 by Methodist and Baylor neurosurgeons to ensure that proper focus was being placed on the clinical and laboratory approaches to traumatic head injury.  With time, investigators from the fields of pathology, anesthesiology, and otorhinolaryngology added their expertise to the group.<P>"Today, the interdisciplinary mix gives our group a distinct advantage over individual physicians or researchers in both the treatment and study of head injuries," says Raj K. Narayan, MD, a Methodist attending neurosurgeon.  "We like to say it takes a team to put Humpty Dumpty back together again.  Even more importantly, we try to keep him from falling off the wall in the first place."<P>The bold initiative paid off in 1989 when the National Institutes of Health awarded the Head Injury Research Group a four-year, $2.8 million grant to fund projects dealing with the early detection and treatment of complications that further worsen the outcome from head injury.  The grant is currently up for renewal.<P>Why the emphasis on the "secondary" problems that result from a traumatic head injury?<P>"The devastation due to head injury doesn't just happen at the moment of impact," says Robert G. Grossman, MD, chief of Methodist's Neurosurgery Service.  "In fact, the majority of deaths and disabilities occur after patients reach the hospital, from complications such as brain swelling, insufficient blood to the brain, infection, and delayed bleeding.  If not prevented or treated quickly, these secondary injuries can cause additional and often irreparable damage to the brain."<P>A Devastating Duo<P>What exactly happens when the head, and subsequently the brain, is injured?<P>"Most of the time, our brains sit well protected within the rigid bones of the skull, floating in a cushioned environment of membranes and fluid," Grossman says.  "However, one sudden impact to the head can disrupt the delicate balance and lead to devastating consequences."<P>That impact can come in one or two forms, Narayan says.  The first type, the "closed head injury," occurs when the head collides with another surface.<P>"Closed injuries result from auto accidents, falls, sports-related blows, and assaults," Narayan says.  "In fact, auto accidents are behind more cases of head trauma (49 percent) in the United States than any other cause."<P>To illustrate how closed head injuries can severely damage or completely destroy brain cells, Narayan suggests considering what happens when a person's head hits a car windshield.<P>"When a person not wearing a seat belt is thrown forward on impact, the head hits the steering wheel and then stops suddenly.  The brain is hurled against the inside of the skull.  Soft brain collides with bone that is not only hard but has rough protrusions.  This same kind of force can also squeeze and twist the brain.  Finally, if the skull is fractured, pieces of bone may tear into nearby brain tissue or blood vessels," Narayan explains.<P>The second head trauma type, "penetrating head injury," occurs when a foreign object -- such as a bullet or a knife -- lacerates the scalp, fractures the skull, enters the brain and rips the soft tissue in its path.<P>The resulting stretching and tearing of nerve fibers known as axons (the "transmission lines" over which the brain sends and receives chemical messages) kills many nerve cells in the damaged area.  The severity of the injury -- and how much it affects normal functioning -- depends on the type of penetrating object, its force and its path through the brain.<P>Sadly, Texas is one of two states (Louisiana is the other) that in 1990 passed a grim milestone regarding head injury type.<P>"For the first time in the United States, bullets rather than car crashes were behind the majority of traumatic head injuries seen in a state's emergency rooms," Narayan says.  "We hoped it was a fluke occurrence, but unfortunately Texas repeated the trend in 1991 and 1992."<P>Where Is the Damage?<P>Regardless of how a head injury occurs, the initial trauma is often only the beginning of a victim's problems.  How well or how poorly a patient recovers from head injury depends on what complications follow in the hours, days, and even weeks afterward.<P>"First of all, if the injury affects a single, specific part of the brain, it creates what we call focal lesions," Grossman says.  "These lesions are better known by their other names: contusions, literally a 'bruise' of the brain; and hematomas, a mass of blood resulting from broken vessels."<P>Contusions, Grossman says, occur in 90 percent of severe head injuries.  "The symptoms vary according to the severity and location of the bruise.  Some patients may be confused, restless, delirious or even unconscious; others may develop severe headaches, paralysis, or seizures that lead to epilepsy," he says.<P>If a hematoma accompanies the contusion, the situation may become even more serious.<P>"Hematomas can put increased pressure on a region of brain cells, impairing whatever physical or mental function that region commands," Grossman says.<P>Where focal lesions are confined to one part of the brain, diffuse lesions are spread out and involve several regions.  Billions of brain cells in these areas are distorted by the twisting, stretching, and compressing forces unleashed during a head trauma.  This distortion, Narayan says, can be relatively benign or can wreck the nerve cells so severely that they die.<P>"The least harmful form of diffuse lesion is the mild concussion," Narayan says.  "There is no loss of consciousness, although the person may be confused for a few moments.  A good example of this injury is 'seeing stars' when you bump your head on the top of a low staircase."<P>Full concussions frequently occur in sports-related injuries.  Take, for example, the football player whose head is on the receiving end of a bruising tackle.<P>"He may lose consciousness for a period of time and probably not remember anything just before and after the impact," Narayan says.  "As long as his helmet does its job of reducing the blow's force, the brain will only be 'stunned' and quickly recover."<P>Why the loss of memory?  Narayan says that in both mild and full concussions, the brain stem -- the region that regulates both breathing and heart rates -- is temporarily disturbed.  This in turn briefly shuts off the part of the brain that controls memory.<P>If a head trauma causes widespread tearing of axons, a condition called axonal injury (DAI) occurs.  DAIs may range from mild to severe, and can cause a patient to lose consciousness for a prolonged period of time -- the dreaded state known as coma.<P>"Seeing a loved one in a comatose state is perhaps the most agonizing aspect of head injury a family can go through," says Narayan.  "The patient doesn't respond to anyone or anything.  His eyes are closed, his breathing labored and he's wired to a mass of incessantly noisy monitoring devices.  It's a scene straight out of a bad dream."<P>A coma may last from a few hours or longer, depending on the severity of brain damage.  In rare instances, a person has remained unconscious for months or even years.  However, a patient who regains consciousness will do so within 2-3 months.<P>Narayan says that people often emerge from a coma with a combination of physical, intellectual, and psychological difficulties that need specialized attention.  Most patients recover their abilities gradually and eventually return to near-normal functioning in all three areas.  Others, he says, may never progress beyond very basic responses.<P>In addition to causing direct damage to the brain, a traumatic head injury may be complicated by pressure on the brain resulting from brain swelling.  This consequence of head injury often proves fatal.<P>"We believe this takes place when the head injury causes a dangerously increased volume of blood within dilated vessels of the brain," Grossman explains.<P>Because the skull is rigid, Grossman says, the swollen vessels compress the surrounding brain.  "If this intracranial (within the skull) pressure remains high, the patient's chances for survival are poor."<P>Knowing How to Treat Humpty<P>In any battle, you first have to know your enemy before you can defeat him.  Taking this wisdom to heart, the Head Injury Research Group has made acquiring patient data a high priority.<P>"We carefully record every head injury case that checks in to the trauma center at Ben Taub General Hospital (where the group's specialists deal with the majority of their head trauma victims) as to injury type and severity, the type of treatment administered, any complications that arise, and the final outcome," Narayan says.<P>Narayan says that the numbers seen in Houston bear out what other data banks across the country are reporting.<P>"We find that 80 percent of all head injuries we treat are mild; that is, the patients are awake, are oriented to their surroundings and can carry on a normal conversation," Narayan says.  "Most of these patients are sent home with specific instructions to come back immediately if their condition changes."<P>The second group, those with moderate head injuries, can still follow simple commands but may appear confused or drift toward unconsciousness.  Narayan says it is common to keep these patients (10 percent of all head injuries seen) in the hospital for observation.  "We like to monitor them closely for a few days just in case their condition takes a turn downward or unforeseen complications arise," he explains.<P>Finally, the last 10 percent of head injury patients are those rated severe.  Their impaired consciousness prevents them from following even the simplest of commands -- and presents the greatest challenge to the treating physician.<P>"You can't take a 'wait and see' approach with these people because they're the most likely to have secondary, life-threatening problems," Narayan says.  "Prompt diagnosis and treatment is the key to their survival."<P>Standard procedure now includes intubation (placing a tube in the trachea to keep open the airway to the lungs), placement on a respirator (to prevent a decrease of oxygen to the brain), constant monitoring for intracranial pressure (to detect brain swelling), computed axial tomography (CAT) scans for locating blood clots, and drug/diet stabilization of all body functions.<P>Does such critical care make a difference?  "The advent of the neurological ICU in recent years has reduced the mortality rate for severe head injury patients from 50 percent in the 1970s to 36 percent," Narayan reports.  "It's really significant when you realize that a 15-percent drop in deaths from cancer or heart disease would be front page news."<P>Coming Out of the Dark<P>Based on their studies of severe traumatic head injuries, the members of the Head Injury Research Group are constantly improving the front-line emergency care that these patients receive at Ben Taub's neurosurgical intensive care unit.  Claudia Robertson, MD, directs Ben Taub's unit and leads the Methodist/Baylor Head Injury Research team.<P>She hopes that the Methodist/Baylor-led success at Ben Taub will provide a model for critical care of traumatic head injury.<P>"Nationally, there's been a tremendous effort by top-level trauma centers like Ben Taub's to help general hospitals with their procedures for diagnosing and treating head injuries," Robertson says.<P>Members of the Head Injury Research Group are teaming with other specialists in Texas to create a state trauma system under the Texas Department of Health.  The goals are to standardize high-quality head injury care, build working relationships between small hospitals and major trauma centers, and establish regional trauma service areas.<P>More Research, More Answers<P>During the first four years of its existence, the Head Injury Research Group has come up with a number of clinically important research findings.<P>"We found that we could combine special sensors and new computer technology to rapidly detect changes in oxygen supply, blood flow, and the degree of swelling in the brain," Robertson says.  "This information allows us to respond with appropriate treatment before any permanent brain damage occurs."<P>In addition, methods were developed to provide the injured brain and body with the calories and proteins it needs to repair tissue damage and prevent infection.<P>"From our data gathering, we learned that weight loss is common in head injury patients because their bodies are often in a hypermetabolic state (burning calories at an accelerated speed)," Robertson says.  "This is particularly dangerous because it increases their susceptibility to infection."<P>Upcoming projects include improving critical care monitoring procedures, refining the "brain-saving" diets already being tested, studying the factors that lead to brain swelling, identifying the role of certain trauma-released enzymes in brain cell death, and investigating post-injury changes in neurochemical levels that may lead to secondary complications.<P>Keeping Humpty Up On the Wall<P>Despite the success of the Head Injury Research Group, members would gladly close up shop if everyone would learn to prevent head trauma instead.  Unfortunately, they're a long way from putting out the "Gone Fishing" sign.<P>"The need for more public education about the dangers of head injuries is evident everywhere," Narayan says.  "Car safety seats are required for infants, but many parents use them incorrectly.  Penalties are stiff for drinking and driving, yet people still continue the behavior.  Gunshot wounds to the head kill or cripple daily."<P>To attack the problem, the American Association of Neurological Surgeons and the Congress of Neurological Surgeons have targeted a prevention campaign called "Think First" at the age group most vulnerable to head (and spinal cord) injuries -- teenagers and young adults.  The Head Injury Research Group members actively participate in the award-winning program.<P>Four components make up "Think First."  These are: educating high school students through presentations by emergency personnel and head injury victims; reinforcing prevention behavior through student activities such as "Staying Alive Clubs;" educating the general public through mass media; and championing public policy initiatives such as state safety belt and motorcycle helmet laws.<P>Narayan says that the key message delivered by "Think First" is that America's 25 million young people should use their minds to protect their bodies.  "We get them to realize they're not as indestructible as they think they are," he says.<P>Worth the time and effort?  You bet, Narayan states emphatically.  "After all, reducing the pain, grief, and needless waste of traumatic head injury is an appropriate goal, especially during 'The Decade of the Brain,'" he says.<P>Reprinted from The Journal, The Methodist Hospital's quarterly magazine.<P><hr size=4></font><center><b>

The eye and the optic nerve are direct pathways to the brain. Early signs of cancer,

          Methodist Hospital, a cooperative research effort combining the fields of neurology,

Eyes are windows to the soul, say the poets.  Doctors are now saying that the eyes can also be a window to disease.<P>Early signs of cancer, vascular disease and degenerative conditions sometimes first surface in the eye.  Loss of vision and peculiar eye movements with double vision may be early signs of multiple sclerosis.  Many kinds of strokes are preceded by visual symptoms.  Certain abnormalities of the retina are associated with Alzheimer's disease.<P>Examination of the back of the eye provides a clear view of a part of the circulatory system.  Changes found in blood vessels here can offer a clue to diagnosing diabetes or high blood pressure and may tip off doctors to the possibility of stroke.<P>Dan B. Jones, MD, is chief of the Ophthalmology Service at The Methodist Hospital.  His sector of the Neurobiology of Disease program could benefit the most from a cooperative research effort combining the fields of neurology, neurosurgery, psychiatry, ophthalmology, and otorhinolaryngology.<P>"Improving diagnostic techniques for brain diseases would enable us to have better tests for eye diseases such as optic neuritis," says Jones.<P>Optic neuritis is an acute, inflammatory disease that affects the nerve between the eye and the brain.  It causes pain and temporary visual loss, can occur in persons of all ages, and is most commonly found in people in their 30s and 40s.  About half the cases of optic neuritis can be linked to multiple sclerosis, but nobody knows what causes the other half of these cases.<P>"Our research into the causes of this disorder was a model for the cooperative effort we're planning," says Jones.  "Starting with our research into brain disorders, we were able to find an effective treatment for this painful condition."<P>One treatment found effective was the intravenous use of corticosteroids, though it was only slightly preferable to no treatment at all.  Although optic neuritis will normally disappear on its own within 2 to 8 weeks, the condition is very painful and some treatment is usually necessary.<P>Jones sees this study as a springboard for improving diagnostic techniques.  "We want to discover better tests for diseases like optic neuritis, newer ways of neuro-imaging to detect it and differentiate among its causes," Jones explains.<P>This research can help provide important clues to other diseases in the brain.  For example, brain tumors often affect vision, with eye symptoms tipping off a clinician that something is seriously wrong aside from the patient's eyes.<P>"The optic nerve is frequently damaged either by physical injury or decreased blood circulation," says Jones, "so changes in the optic nerve may be another place to find clues to what happens to the brain when these things happen."<P>Jones is also interested in the use of growth factors in neuro-ophthalmology, transferring some of the concepts tried in the treatment of spinal cord injury to restore nerve function.<P>"The eye and the optic nerve are direct pathways to the brain," says Jones.  "Taking that route, we may one day find a way to crack the mystery of some our worst diseases."<P>Reprinted from The Journal, The Methodist Hospital's quarterly magazine.<P><hr size=4></font><center><b><A HREF="/~imagemap/mhsmall"><IMG SRC="/methodist/icon/m-menu.gif" ISMAP border=0></a>

When Jennifer Creech mails out thank-you notes for all her wedding gifts, she'll have to address one to The Methodist Hospital, for a gift with the unlikely name "urokinase."<P>Just two weeks before her wedding day, Jennifer suffered a stroke.  She blacked out and was rushed to Methodist.  At the time, the prognosis wasn't good.<P>Jennifer, a 21-year-old social worker in Houston, had lost movement on her right side and couldn't talk.  Her problem was a small blood clot in her brain, blocking blood flow and causing a stroke.  A neurologist who examined Jennifer at the time assessed that the stroke would cause serious brain damage.<P>But Methodist neuroradiologist Michel Mawad was waiting for a patient like Jennifer.  Mawad is the lead investigator in trials of an experimental drug called urokinase in the treatment of acute stroke.<P>"My father agreed to let the doctor give me the drug," recalls Jennifer.  Almost immediately after Jennifer received a dose of urokinase, she regained use of her arm and started moving her leg.<P>"I remember being wheeled into intensive care and really, I didn't feel that bad," she says.  "And aside from a few headaches, afterward it was like nothing ever happened."<P>When an obstruction stops blood flow in an artery feeding the brain, brain tissue can die rapidly.  More than half the stroke victims in the United States do not get to the hospital until more than 24 hours after symptoms start.  About a third of them don't show up at a hospital until 48 hours or more are gone -- along with a lot of brain tissue.<P>Some people receive early warning of a stroke, in the form of a transient ischemic attack (TIA).  This condition mirrors virtually all the symptoms of stroke: numbness of the face, arm, or one side of the body; dimness or loss of vision; difficulty speaking or understanding speech; and headaches and dizziness.<P>TIAs are caused by the narrowing of arteries that supply blood to large parts of the brain.  TIAs usually last just a few minutes, and cause no permanent damage.  But they increase the risk for having a real stroke by at least 10 times.  So people who experience TIAs need to seek preventive treatment to reduce their risk factors.<P>Urokinase, the drug that dissolved Jennifer's blood clot, is still only an experimental treatment for stroke.  "For years it has been used to dissolve blockages in leg and coronary arteries," says Mawad.  "We are among the first to use urokinase in the brain."<P>The drug's effectiveness depends on how quickly doctors can detect the cause of a stroke.  "Our first step is to do an arteriogram, a procedure that actually takes a picture of vessels inside the head.  It can clearly detect the presence of a blood clot," explains Mawad.<P>When the clot is located, a small catheter is snaked through the carotid artery, a main blood supply route to the brain.  Urokinase is injected through the catheter until it reaches the blood clot.<P>"The drug dissolves the clot and restores blood flow and oxygen to the brain," says Mawad.  "If we get a patient early, within six to eight hours of the onset of a stroke, we can limit the amount of brain damage with this treatment."<P>Methodist is one of a handful of centers in the United States to conduct clinical trials on urokinase.<P>While results may typically not be as dramatic as Jennifer's, Mawad says the drug can minimize the effects of a stroke and make recovery and rehabilitation periods much shorter.<P>Jennifer was released from the hospital a week after she was admitted.  Once home, she mailed a wedding invitation to Dr. Mawad.<P>Five days later ,Jennifer Clines walked down the aisle with groom John Creech in her childhood church, with her brother presiding over the ceremony.  And of all the wedding gifts the couple received, Jennifer is glad she got one of them early.<P><hr size=4></font><center><b>

<HTML><HEAD>    <TITLE></TITLE></HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="#ffff99" TEXT="#003800"><IMG SRC="AGONY.GIF" WIDTH="469" HEIGHT="300" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><H6><CENTER><STRONG>by Kathryn Tesar<BR>illustration by Eric Dinyer</STRONG></CENTER></H6><BR>On a midnight quest for a glass of water, you suddenly regret not turningthe lights on as your big toe bumps hard against the new, solid cherry woodentertainment center. Sharp, burning pain travels up your leg and - yoursleeping family forgotten - a string of expletives bursts from your lips.Within seconds the worst of the pain is gone, but your toe continues tothrob mockingly as you try to remember why you got out of bed in the firstplace.<BR><BR>Fortunately, most of us experience such physical distress only in brief,infrequent spurts: a clumsy hammer blow to the thumb, an ill-advised attemptat in-line skating, a too-hot baking dish. For some people, though, pain- serious, debilitating, physical pain - is a constant, as familiar andenduring as the very act of breathing. And, until recently, many of thesepeople could only hope for effective medical relief. <H2><CENTER>&quot;Thousands of needles&quot;</CENTER></H2>After more than 20 years of relentless pain, simply hoping became a strugglefor Penny Walker. In 1971, at the age of 20, Walker sustained a back injuryin a car accident. In spite of numerous treatments and surgeries, Walkerspent most of her adult life feeling what she describes as &quot;thousandsof needles being stuck into me.&quot;<BR><BR>Walker's accident resulted in an injured disc in her spinal cord that ledto arachnoiditis, inflammation or irritation of the nerves inside the spinalcolumn. The pain began in her back, then spread downward to the front and,finally, the back of both legs, growing progressively more intense. Throughit all, there were diagnoses and operations; discs were removed and instrumentationinserted, but nothing seemed to help.<BR><BR>&quot;It became more and more disabling,&quot; she says, &quot;to the pointthat I could no longer function. I didn't want to get out of bed.&quot;<BR><BR>Like many chronic pain sufferers, Walker found her mental health failingwith her physical health. &quot;I became addicted to pain medication, andstill there was no relief. It was so depressing,&quot; she says. &quot;Iwas suicidal. It was a pretty messed-up life.&quot;<BR><BR>By 1993, Walker was spending at least one week a month in the hospital.Then her neurosurgeon referred her to Michael T. McCann, MD, a pain medicinespecialist at The Methodist Hospital. During their first meeting they discussedher injury and pain, as well as previous treatments. After subsequent meetingsand diagnostic tests, McCann recommended a spinal cord stimulator, an implantabledevice that manipulates nerves in the spine to diffuse the pain signalssent to certain points in the body.<BR><BR>Like most pain medicine patients, Walker underwent a psychological consultationbefore the procedure. &quot;We weren't attempting to dismiss her pain aspsychological,&quot; explains Kevin G. Smith, PhD, a psychologist who workswith McCann. &quot;We were trying to find out how she was coping with pain.&quot;<BR><BR>After years of unsuccessful treatments, October 1993 marked the turningpoint. McCann and Methodist neurosurgeon Richard K. Simpson implanted thestimulator, and Walker's life changed dramatically.<BR><BR>While most people treated with the stimulator experience only partial alleviation,Walker's relief was total. &quot;In my case, the pain is gone,&quot; sheexclaims. &quot;It's been a godsend!&quot;<BR><BR>Since the treatment, Walker has returned to Methodist only a few times:twice for follow-up and once to replace the stimulator's batteries. In themeantime, she vacationed in Paris five months after surgery and is participatingfully in the lives of her twin 14-year-old sons. &quot;They're very active,&quot;she says, &quot;and it was important that I could be in their lives.<BR><BR>&quot;Obviously, Dr. McCann doesn't want me bungee jumping, but I have beenhorseback riding,&quot; she happily states. &quot;It's just incredible whatI've been able to do!&quot; <H2><CENTER>Time doesn't heal all</CENTER></H2>In a perfect world, pain exists to alert us to harm or potential dangerto our bodies. By causing a person to react and remove the source of pain,it prevents additional damage to tissue. But for the millions of Americanslike Penny Walker, the world is far from perfect: pain has become a seriousdisability, no longer helping their bodies but instead preventing them fromparticipating in even the most basic activities.<BR><BR>There are many different kinds of chronic pain and no two are alike. Peopleexperience near-constant headaches, back and neck aches, muscle and jointpain, cardiovascular angina and arthritis, among other afflictions. Thesecan affect sufferers for a number of reasons, such as years of persistentstress on a spinal disk or nerve, heart disease or one-time traumas likecar accidents or athletic injuries.<BR><BR>Whatever the causes of chronic pain, the effects on those living with itare often devastating. Some people must quit their jobs and have troubleperforming simple household chores. Merely sitting up can be a torturousexperience; getting out of bed each morning, a Herculean task.<BR>Not surprisingly, long-term chronic pain sufferers often endure profoundemotional distress, as well. Mental anguish - in the form of depressionand hopelessness - invariably accompanies the physical, and the unrelievedstress of living with constant pain takes its toll on relationships withfriends and families.<BR><BR>Carolyn Hardie knows the emotional cost of chronic pain, having damagedher vertebra in a 1991 elevator accident. In the years since, Hardie hasquit her job, experienced strain in her family life and become almost homebound,physically and emotionally unable to make even a quick trip to the mall.<BR><BR>&quot;The person that you once were,&quot; she says, &quot;you can neverbe again.&quot; <H2><CENTER>Getting to the source</CENTER></H2>Until recently, attempts to help people like Walker and Hardie restore normalcyto their lives frequently proved unsuccessful. Some people underwent complexand often ineffective spinal surgeries. Others found that the relief offeredby narcotics came with debilitating side effects and sometimes led to addiction.Many who failed to respond to traditional treatments simply were told, &quot;It'sall in your head&quot; and given referrals to psychiatrists. The most drastic&quot;treatments&quot; actually destroyed the nerves, substituting painwith complete and permanent numbness often accompanied by muscle weaknessand, sometimes, paralysis.<BR><BR>Within the last few decades, physicians and researchers have developed newmethods to lessen pain and even eradicate it completely. Pharmacologicalregimens, lifestyle changes, physical and occupational therapies, invasivespinal procedures or any combination of these have all been used to treatpain with varying degrees of success. And, as doctors and scientists haveadded to their knowledge about pain and its causes, the chances for successfultreatment have increased.<BR><BR>Most pain originates in the spinal column, where a nerve or nerve groupsends signals to a corresponding nerve ending located elsewhere in the body:the fingertips, a big toe or the right hip, for instance. Two recent procedures- spinal cord stimulation and implantable catheter pumps - have proven highlyeffective in treating pain directly at the source, working on the nervesin the spinal column to weaken the pain signals they send out.<BR><BR>Spinal cord stimulators are devices permanently implanted in a patient,usually just above the right hip, with wires that snake around to the centerof the back. The stimulators, or electro-neurotransmitters, are about thesize of two silver dollars and work like pacemakers that jolt the heartback into a normal rhythm.<BR><BR>Neurotransmitters, however, use vibrations to diffuse pain signals sentfrom spinal nerves to nerve endings. For example, pain in the shoulder wouldbe treated by finding the corresponding nerves in the spinal column andcovering them with the transmitter's wires.<BR>One advantage of spinal cord stimulators is that patients themselves canmanage the strength and frequency of the vibrations - and thus the levelof relief.<BR><BR>&quot;Basically, the patients have control,&quot; says Stuart M. Weil, md,a Methodist neurosurgeon who treats pain. &quot;They get educated abouthow to take care of the stimulator, how to make sure it's working, how toturn it up and down.&quot; Once they get down to a level of pain that'sfunctional, he adds, most don't leave it on all the time.<BR><BR>Like spinal cord stimulators, implantable catheters treat nerves directlyat the spine to combat pain throughout the body. Instead of electrical stimulation,however, the catheters' weapons are narcotics, anti-inflammatories and othermedicines that are pumped directly into the spinal fluid, essentially bathingthe brain and the spinal cord. Because the drugs bypass the bloodstreamand the rest of the body, a smaller dosage is required, making the medicationsmore effective and less likely to generate unwelcome side effects like mentaland physical sluggishness and addiction.<BR><BR>Approximately the size of a hockey puck, a catheter pump is significantlylarger than a stimulator. And, unlike stimulators, most catheters can beprogrammed only by the pain medicine physician, although in a few casesthe patient can regulate the amount of medication being pumped to the spine.<BR>As with narcotics delivered orally or through the bloodstream, the greatestdrawback to the pump is the potential of developing a tolerance to the medication.<BR><BR>&quot;Some of the addictive side effects that we're normally concerned aboutare the systemic cravings for the drug,&quot; says neurosurgeon RichardSimpson. &quot;But that's not as much of a problem when you deliver drugsdirectly to the spinal cord because you bypass the rest of the body. Overa period of years, however, the body may adapt to the level of medicationcirculating in the spinal fluid. So if it's not as effective, the dose mayneed to increase.&quot;<H2><CENTER>The pain team</CENTER></H2>In the mid-1980s, when spinal cord stimulation and implantable catheterpumps proved more and more successful, the practice of pain management startedto grow. Although physicians have specialized in pain management for decades,it wasn't until 1993 that it became a Board-certified specialty. With research,new technology and increasingly sophisticated treatments, the practice ofpain medicine by specially trained anesthesiologists has grown in the pastdecade.<BR><BR>&quot;Pain management is a specialty field,&quot; says Vladimir Redko, MD,a pain medicine physician practicing at Methodist. &quot;All of us havecompleted pain management fellowship programs, and we can systematicallyevaluate patients and offer them various techniques to treat their pain.We are dedicated full time to pain.&quot;<BR><BR>Redko adds that new understanding of pain and its causes and treatmentshas enabled specialists to intervene earlier to alleviate pain before itbecomes a major obstacle. &quot;We are trying to help people earlier andmore aggressively,&quot; he says, &quot;so we can take care of problemsbefore they get out of control.&quot;<BR><BR>Pain medicine specialists do not work alone, however. &quot;We're like teamcoordinators,&quot; says McCann. &quot;We identify the problem, then weget the right specialist involved in the team.&quot; The team can includea neurosurgeon, a physical medicine physician and a psychologist, as wellas nurses and social workers.<BR><BR>Suzanne Dorshaw, RN, a perioperative nurse who works with pain patients,emphasizes that pain management is often a whole realm of treatments, notjust one procedure or one set treatment. &quot;You can't just give a patientone interventional procedure and expect them to recover,&quot; she says.&quot;They have to have a package deal.&quot;<BR><BR>Education is one of the most important aspects of pain management, and patientslearn about their bodies, their minds and the resources available. &quot;They'reput through a whole educational process of how to control their pain andnot let their pain control them,&quot; says Dorshaw.<BR><BR>As a physical medicine and rehabilitation specialist, Donna Schramm, md,is an important member of the pain management team. Schramm often assistsin the diagnostic stage, looking for common muscular or skeletal causesof pain, such as stiffness, loss of flexibility and weakness as well asless common conditions like lupus, hypothyroidism and even leg length discrepancy.<BR><BR>The most common ailment that Schramm sees, however, is low back pain, generallycaused by on-the-job injuries or motor vehicle accidents. But pain causedby one condition often leads to more pain from another source - for instance,pain in one leg can lead to overuse of the other leg. &quot;It's like partof your body is taped up and the rest of the body has to move unusually,&quot;Schramm says. &quot;It creates a lot of problems.&quot;<BR><BR>Depending on the type and intensity of pain, Schramm may recommend any ofa variety of treatments, including drug therapy. Most pain patients, however,undergo physical therapy treatments at some point.<BR><BR>Unlike implantable devices and medication, physical therapy doesn't actuallyaffect the level of pain a patient feels. While narcotics, stimulators andcorrective spine surgery actually treat the primary source of pain, physicaltherapy, says Schramm, teaches people to use their bodies so that the painis more manageable.<BR><BR>&quot;I teach people to look at chronic pain like hypertension or heartdisease: We can tone it down, but it's always going to be there,&quot; shesays. &quot;But while physical therapy won't change heart disease or bloodpressure, it can certainly give you more energy and the ability to do morethings, because you're stronger and your overall endurance is better. Thephysical therapy is going to protect the part that hurts and strengthenthe parts that don't, so that you can get more out of your day.&quot;<BR><BR>Like physical therapists, who teach physical coping skills, specially trainedpsychologists on the pain team like Kevin Smith teach patients ways to copewith their pain emotionally. &quot;Pain and pain treatment bring on a lotof emotional stress,&quot; says Smith. &quot;If that stress isn't properlyaddressed or treated, the medical interventions might not be as effective.<BR><BR>&quot;Patients who are faced with pain for any length of time have to startaddressing some of the larger lifestyle issues that pain causes,&quot; headds, &quot;including inactivity, long-term use of medications, the tollon relationships and the financial stresses associated with pain.&quot;<BR><BR>In Penny Walker's case, the psychologist considered her addiction and madesure she understood that there would be no more pain medication.<BR><BR>&quot;The people whose long-term chronic pain has really affected theirlives - their relationships with family, friends, employers - those arethe people who need to make lifestyle changes,&quot; says McCann. &quot;Theycan't cope with their pain well, so they take it out on other people. That'swhere psychologists really help out.&quot; <BR><H2><CENTER>Living with pain</CENTER></H2>Despite increased knowledge of pain, new and better technology and the bestefforts of pain management professionals, most patients never experienceabsolute freedom from pain. They feel less pain, sometimes considerablyless, but the fact is, it will probably be there forever.<BR><BR>But, says Dorshaw, for people living with it, even a slight decrease intheir pain is a vast improvement. &quot;Most of the patients are very appreciative.A lot of them have been neglected for a number of years and never had anyanticipation of being relieved of their pain.&quot;<BR><BR>Carolyn Hardie is one who, after almost four years of suffering, no longerexpected relief.<BR>When the elevator she was in fell several floors then jolted to a stop,Hardie's pain was immediate, &quot;like flipping on a light switch.&quot;From April 1991 to spring of this year, she dealt with constant pain.<BR><BR>&quot;You go to bed with it, you wake up with it. It doesn't go away,&quot;she asserts. &quot;It almost takes away your independence.<BR><BR>&quot;The first step each day - getting out of bed - was absolute agony.I didn't want to wake up in the morning,&quot; Hardie says. &quot;Then,Dr. Redko came along.&quot;<BR><BR>Based on her history and physical condition, Redko chose to treat Hardie'slow back pain with an epidural catheter. Unlike a permanently implantedcatheter pump, which continuously sends medication to the spine, the epiduralmethod uses a tiny, temporary catheter to bathe the inflamed nerve routewith a mixture of steroids, enzymes and other medications for a fixed periodof time.<BR>Although Hardie still experiences pain from other sources, the symptomstreated by the epidural catheter have abated. &quot;The first week was likea miracle,&quot; she says. &quot;I still feel some pain, but I don't havethe terrible, terrible pain in my low back.&quot;<BR><BR>The relief, though limited, has brought a sort of serenity to Hardie's life.&quot;The most wonderful thing is the peacefulness, emotionally, that comesacross you. Everyone used to think that I was so angry. Now, I'm not sotense with everyone.&quot;<BR><BR>And, like many patients, Hardie is grateful for the things most of us takefor granted. &quot;After the treatment, I slept the whole night through,&quot;she says. &quot;Now I look forward to waking up in the morning.&quot; <BR><BR>For more information or to contact a pain specialist, call Methodist's PhysicianReferral &amp; Health Information Line at 790-3333.

          taken seriously? For the complete article,
  keep reading.<br><p></ul><p><p><br hs=180><p>
Childbirth--the most profound, challenging event in many lives--is supposed to be a wonderful experience.  So why do expectant couples often find themselves feeling more anxiety than joy?<P>One reason may be the many well-meaning friends, relatives, and strangers who feel compelled, no, committed to giving advice -- the unsolicited, highly questionable kind that occurs everywhere, any time, and under any circumstance.<P>Pregnancy is the prime time to perpetuate old wives tales.  Handed down like dusty heirlooms, these myths perplex, worry, and often entertain generation after generation.<P>But should any of them be taken seriously?  To find out, we ran some pregnancy lore past two experts at The Methodist Hospital: Paula Hansen, manager of Women's Health Care and Nurseries, and Mark Gottesman, MD, an obstetrician/gynecologist.<P>Do children delivered naturally become better-adjusted than those delivered by C-section?<P>"A lot of things influence how well a baby adjusts, but certainly not the way the child was delivered," says Hansen. The only difference, Gottesman chimes in, may be that babies born through elective caesarean have a little more fluid in their lungs for the first few hours.  "But it has nothing to do with the way a person adjusts to life," Gottesman stresses.  "A baby's adjustment has everything to do with a combination of genetics, parenting and environment."<P>Is it better to deliver naturally, without the use of an epidural? "Modern obstetrical philosophy is that a woman should use whatever method is safe, appropriate, and allows her to stay in control during labor," Gottesman says.<P>"The point of both methods are pain control and relief for Mom," Hansen adds. "Neither has an effect on the baby.  So really, it's a matter of individual choice."<P>Can sex during pregnancy harm the fetus?<P>"Sex cannot harm the fetus in a normal pregnancy," says Hansen.  "However, there can be medical indications in some pregnancies where the obstetrician will discourage sexual intercourse."  Such as? "In certain populations where the propensity for sexually transmitted diseases is higher, a higher risk for premature labor may be more likely," Gottesman explains.  "Generally, though, the only restriction is based upon desire and comfort.  I approve of my low-risk patients being sexually active as far into the pregnancy as they want."<P>Do pets become jealous of newborn babies?<P>Gottesman speaks from personal experience rather than studies: "I think it is often a fact.  Probably the more territorial the pet, the more it resents the newcomer in its territory.  On the other hand, many pet owners feel that their pets have virtually adopted the newborn."<P>Hansen lends some advice for any "sibling rivalry" that occurs between child and pet.  "If your pet shows some jealousy, treat it like another child and spend some quality time," she says.  "If the problem with the pet is more serious, you probably need to make some choices."<P>Can aspirin have a significant effect on the fetus during the first or second trimester?<P>"In the same way that aspirin can cause bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract in some adults," says Gottesman, "we are concerned that a fetus exposed to continuous aspirin administration may also be susceptible to bleeding in its GI tract."<P>Any drugs, cautions Hansen, even over-the-counter medications, should be cleared with your obstetrician before you take them.  "But infrequent aspirin doses during the pregnancy should not be harmful to the fetus," she adds.<P>Do germs enter the cervix when a pregnant woman takes a bath?<P>"In some cases, infections can penetrate an intact amniotic sac and contribute to premature labor," says Gottesman. But in general, both agree that the protective membrane surrounding the baby protects it from germs that may be in the vagina or on the cervix.  "And," says Hansen, "maternal antibodies are constantly flowing around the fetus."<P> Is it true that pregnant women should not travel during their pregnancy?<P>Gottesman restricts his patients from long-distance travel only during the last five to six weeks of pregnancy.  Additionally, he says, "I tell my patients to avoid pressure extremes such as scuba diving or flying in an unpressurized plane.  Commercial flights are OK."<P>"Normal activities that women are used to should be continued, within reason," says Hansen, "but travel restrictions could be imposed earlier if you have a medical problem."<P>Can regular exercise, such as aerobics, harm the fetus?<P>"Not low-impact aerobics," says Gottesman.  "There are many low-impact exercises that can be done during pregnancy.  On the other hand, exercises such as long-distance jogging, jumping jacks, and activities in extremes of temperature are discouraged."<P>What about circumcision?  Some say it's traumatic for the baby but necessary for genital hygiene.<P>"Many cultures practice circumcision as a religious conviction," says Gottesman.  "In the United States, estimates are that more than 90 percent of all males are circumcised.  Many of them are carried out because of so-called 'social reasons.'  If Dad is circumcised, parents want their sons to look like him and all the other boys in the high school locker room.  Interestingly, in California there have been some lawsuits filed by children against both the obstetrician and their parents for permitting this procedure.  In point of fact, circumcision has very few medical indications and very few risks associated with it.  While there had been some controversy about it in the recent past, the vast majority of the obstetrical and urological community remains neutral on the issue. In the final analysis, it's up to the parents."<P>Is cigarette smoking dangerous to breast milk? <P>Gottesman gives an unequivocal Yes.  "Traces of nicotine and other potential carcinogens have been found in the breast milk of mothers who smoke, so it is strongly recommended that mothers who nurse their babies not smoke.  By far the greatest risk is from the actual smoke that the baby will inhale," he says.  "Many mothers who nurse do so because they perceive that it is healthier for their baby.  They should not smoke before, during, or after their pregnancy."<P>Is breast feeding healthier than bottle feeding?<P>"With the exception of the small percentage of babies who can develop milk allergies or lactose intolerance, most babies in the United States will thrive on formula as easily as breast milk," says Gottesman. "For my own patients, I leave it up to them. I personally encourage breast feeding because it's easier (the formula is always at the right temperature) and it strengthens the mother-infant bond.  Those fathers who feel left out can always change diapers."<P>"Breast milk is the most natural form of milk," adds Hansen.  "It has been the sustenance for infants since the beginning of creation."<P>Does breast feeding provide natural protection against pregnancy?<P>"While it does delay ovulation for some women, it doesn't do so all the time," says Hansen.<P>In fact, Gottesman tells his patients that using nursing as their method of contraception is playing a sort of obstetrical roulette.  "Nursing protects women from pregnancy until two weeks before menstruation--when she would be ovulating and therefore fertile.  None of my nursing patients has yet to deduce when that first ovulation will occur," Gottesman explains. "There are probably few obstetricians who have not had a bewildered patient come to their office asking, 'How could this have happened?  I just can't be pregnant.'"<P>Does taking oral contraceptives harm breast milk or the baby?<P>"Oral contraceptives could cause a decrease in breast milk if the woman doesn't have a set breastfeeding pattern going," says Hansen. "Otherwise, there's no negative effect."<P>In fact, Gottesman estimates that 90 to 95 percent will see no change in quantity or quality of breast milk while using oral contraceptives.  "I let patients using the pill take it six weeks postpartum when nursing is well established," Gottesman says.  "For that small percent who do note changes in their milk supply, I advise them to quit the pill, and usually their milk supply is reestablished within 24 to 48 hours."<P>Can spicy foods give the baby gas?<P>"Breast milk is made from a woman's nutritional intake and what she absorbs into her bloodstream," says Hansen.  "Different women have a different tolerance.  And certainly, it depends on what you call spicy and what your body is used to."<P>Gottesman says many nursing mothers find that a surprising number of foods--fruits, chocolate, gas-producing vegetables--not necessarily just spicy, may affect their babies.  "If you think spicy foods upset your baby's digestive tract, eliminate the suspect foods from your diet and re-introduce them one a time."<P>Can pregnant women double their calorie intake since they are "eating for two?" "Doubling is too high an intake of calories and will lead to unwanted pounds that will have to be worked off after delivery," Gottesman warns.  "Yes, you're eating for two.  But not for two adults."<P>What is a pregnancy mask, and do all pregnant women get one?<P>"It's a skin tone change due basically to a hormone shift," says Hansen.  "Some women get a raccoon-like appearance, especially if they've been in the sun.

Summary: <ul>
As people age, their eyes face more challenges than arms not holding the newspaper
          quite far away enough. Some are robbed of their ability to see details; others see as if
          through a tunnel surrounded by darkness; still others experience their vision becoming
          increasingly blurry, hazy or frosty. All are symptoms of eye diseases that are common
          in people age 50 and older. For the complete article,
  keep reading.<br><p></ul><p><p><br hs=180><p>
Imagine a black hole that follows you everywhere.  It sucks in everything you see.  It takes the faces of everyone you love.  It robs your job, your car, and throws you into an unknown world of darkness.<P>You see just enough light around the edges to tease your senses.  Your independence, your confidence have been stolen. You must share all that you know, all that you do, with the darkness.<P>When disease or simple deterioration impairs the eye, it clouds more than vision.  The impairment rules the lives of its victims by destroying their ability to see close up. They can no longer focus, so they cannot read and they cannot drive.<P>Macular degeneration is a group of diseases that destroy the eye's macula, a part of the retina that we use to see details--a stream of hot coffee pouring into a cup, words in a newspaper, brake lights on the car ahead, the face of a grandchild.<P>Age-related macular degeneration is the most common eye disease and a main cause of vision loss in adults over 50, followed only by glaucoma and cataracts.  Medical advances have given doctors the ability to diagnose and treat those diseases early so that devastating effects to the patient can be reduced or eliminated.  At The Methodist Hospital, progress in research and treatment brightens the future and promises to hold off the darkness.<P>Macular Degeneration<P>The retina lines the back of the eye.  The macula, which we need to see detail, makes up only 5 percent of the retina.  The remaining 95 percent of the retina is used for peripheral vision.<P>Macular degeneration normally starts when spots, or "drusen," appear on the retina.  A patient in his 20s or 30s may be diagnosed with macular degeneration when an ophthalmologist detects drusen, but the disease may not be devastating until age 50 or 60.<P>Macular degeneration occurs in two forms--wet and dry.  "In the dry form, cells in the back of the eye--the cells that do the seeing--just stop functioning, atrophy, and die," says Michael Lambert, MD, an vitreoretinal surgeon at Methodist.<P>The wet form of the disease goes a bit farther.  Scar tissue and new vessels grow under the central part of the retina.  As vessels bleed and fluid leaks, cells malfunction and scar tissue then destroys the functioning of the macula.<P>While doctors believe macular degeneration is hereditary, it's not a direct genetic link. <P>"Every child of a parent with macular degeneration is not going to get macular degeneration," Lambert says.  "We think it's an inherited predisposition and that other factors come into play."<P>Lambert has helped to pioneer a new surgery that restores vision in some patients with diseases of the retina.  The procedure, called subfoveal neovascular surgery, removes the vision-blocking membranes that have formed under the macula.<P>"In patients with the same membrane, but with diseases other than macular degeneration, we've taken them from count-fingers vision (where you can only see your fingers in front of you) back to 20/20," Lambert says. "It's been very helpful for them."<P>Lambert believes one answer to the problems of age-related macular degeneration may lie in clues provided by two other retinal diseases. <P>In both diseases, vision-blocking membranes grow on the retina in the same way as in macular degeneration.  One type is caused by unknown disease.  The other, a fungus infection called histoplasmosis, affects mainly residents of the Mississippi and Ohio River valleys.<P>"In macular degeneration, the whole back of the eye is sick.  With these other two diseases, new membranes grow from a single focal point," Lambert says.  "Healthy tissue surrounds this point, which enables us to remove just the small part with the scar."<P>The surgery currently isn't as successful for macular degeneration cases, Lambert says, because the disease encompasses more of the eye.  "That patient wouldn't have as much working material to function again," Lambert explains.<P>Half of Lambert's macular degeneration patients who had subfovial neovascular surgery did experience some improvement.  "But it's not to the level that we had hoped at this point," he adds.  So, he continues to seek new ways to stimulate the badly damaged photoreceptors to start working again.<P>Glaucoma<P>The second most common cause of blindness in the United States is glaucoma, occurring in 1 to 2 percent of the over-40 population and reaching 10 percent of those 85 and older.<P>Glaucoma is a painless disease that has the opposite effect of macular degeneration.  Instead of seeing a black hole with peripheral light, glaucoma sufferers see their world through a tunnel surrounded by darkness.  Without treatment, that tunnel becomes progressively smaller. <P>The most common form of glaucoma is open-angle glaucoma, in which the fluid circulating in the eyes drains improperly.  The fluid, or aqueous humor, normally fills the space between the back of the cornea and the front of the iris and supplies nutrients that include Vitamin C.  The fluid helps the cornea maintain its proper curve, and also removes waste products by draining through a circular channel called the Canal of Schlemm.  <P>In a healthy eye, this flow maintains constant pressure over time.  In a glaucoma-diseased eye, a blockage of the drainage system creates pressure.  Eventually the pressure builds, damaging the optic nerve and causing total blindness.<P>Other forms of glaucoma include:<P>* acute closed-angle glaucoma: a sudden buildup of pressure.  This causes severe pain which can cause total blindness within a few days;<P>* congenital glaucoma: a blockage or malformation of the eye which appears at birth or in the first year of life; and<P>* secondary glaucoma: resulting from another disease, injury, tumor, cataract, or from taking steroids.<P>There is no way to restore vision after any type of glaucoma.  Eye drops used several times a day to maintain pressure are the most common treatment, according to Methodist ophthalmologist Ronald Gross.<P>"The medications work by either slowing down the fluid output or assisting in drainage," Gross says. "If the medications fail, we can lower the pressure with laser or conventional surgery."<P>Early detection will prevent severe visual impairment.  "To minimize damage from glaucoma, it is important to treat the disease at an early stage," Gross says.<P>Because there is normally no pain with glaucoma, it is important to have an ophthalmologist check eye pressure occasionally before the age of 35 and annually after age 40.<P>Cataracts<P>With cataracts, the eye's normally crystal-clear lens clouds in part or whole.  Vision becomes blurry, hazy, or frosty, creating the sense of constantly peering through a window wet with condensation.<P>The lens is located behind the cornea and iris, near the front of the eye.  Controlled by the brain, the lens helps to focus light rays from the viewed object onto the retina.  The image is then instantaneously sent along the optic nerve to the brain.  When the lens is clouded, the brain receives a distorted image.<P>There are four major types of cataracts:<P>* congenital: present at birth;<P>* traumatic: caused by injury;<P>* secondary: caused by a systemic disease or medications; and<P>* age-related: caused by a breakdown of the molecular structure of the protein in the lens.<P>Regardless of the type of cataract, symptoms are the same.  And although doctors do not really know why cataracts form, they have some evidence that a vitamin-deficient diet or a significant amount of exposure to ultraviolet radiation are high risk factors for age-related cataracts.<P>Age-related cataracts are most common in aging eyes, occurring in 30 to 50 percent of people over age 65.  As baby boomers age and life expectancy rises, so will incidences of cataracts.  For now, the number of cataract surgeries has leveled off at 1.2 million a year in the United States.  And surgical removal is the only known effective treatment for cataracts, says Methodist ophthalmologist Douglas Koch.<P>Koch is aware of the negative press ophthalmologists have received for allegedly overusing cataract surgery.  But he emphasizes that surgery is the patient's decision, and there are no medications to dissolve cataracts.<P>"I rely heavily on my patient's own concerns and needs in determining the timing of cataract surgery," he says.<P>Koch uses a small needle to direct ultrasonic waves that break the cataract into fragments.  He then gently suctions them from the eye, leaving the posterior lens capsule intact.  An artificial intraocular lens (IOL) is implanted during surgery to focus light into the retina.<P>Following this surgery, patients still need glasses in order to read. But the improvement of bifocal contact lenses will do away with the need for glasses.<P>Cataract surgery is recommended when the condition affects a patient's everyday life. "The severity of cataract surgery will vary in patients," says Koch, "because a cataract affects different patients in different ways."<P>There may be no miracle drugs to make cataracts disappear, but there is good news about their treatment. <P>"We've got the advances in technology. The techniques are better. The materials we use in surgery are better. And the intraocular lenses are getting better as well," Koch says, referring to advances made in the past five years.<P>In fact, Koch has just completed a test on a new folding lens, which allows surgeons to insert it through a much smaller incision than that required for an unbendable lens.<P>"Approximately 30 patients at Methodist have been implanted with that lens, and the results have been excellent," Koch says.<P>What the smaller incision means for patients is less astigmatism and a stronger eye after surgery.  The potential for better vision without glasses, and for a more rapid recovery of vision immediately following surgery, both increase with the smaller incision.<P>Also, implants can now be more appropriately sized than they were five years ago because more is known about the internal structure of the eye.  Lenses are smaller so that even those that can't be folded can still fit through a smaller incision.  New implants have also been designed to allow for more complex surgeries to be performed in cases where the posterior capsular support would normally be inadequate for an implant.<P>Misleading advertising has helped fuel the misconception that cataracts are removed by lasers.  Although ophthalmologists pioneered lasers in surgery and use them regularly, lasers can only be used in cataract surgery when a secondary cataract is being removed.  Secondary cataracts occur in 50 percent of patients a few months to a few years after they have undergone age-related cataract surgery.<P>Secondary cataracts are a clouding of the posterior capsule.  "That clouding of the capsule can result in a loss of vision that really matches the loss of vision the patient originally experienced with a cataract," Koch says.<P>The YAG laser, which uses the crystal of an yttrium aluminum garnet to create tiny, accurate incisions, is the instrument of choice for opening the membrane of the posterior capsule.  "The opening in the membrane is what is referred to as laser cataract surgery, but it's really, in fact, laser surgery for a secondary cataract," Koch added.<P>Koch says there occasionally can be problems when a cataract is left to go into very advanced stages.  Glaucoma or inflammation inside the eye can occur, although very rarely.  The cataract must also be removed when the retina cannot be examined through the cloudy lens.  <P>"By and large, for the vast majority of people, the reason we do cataract surgery is simply to help them see better," Koch says.<P>Finding a Magic Bullet<P>The reasons why the aging eye develops macular degeneration, glaucoma, or cataracts are not fully understood.  Heredity is believed to be one factor.  And research is proving two more factors play a role in diseases of the eye--antioxidants and ultraviolet radiation.<P>Antioxidants, including vitamins A, C, E, and beta carotene and selenium, fight the oxidation process and may someday prove to ward off strokes, neurological diseases, and cancers, as well as diseases of the eye.  Lambert recommends antioxidants to his macular degeneration patients. He believes a 10-year study of antioxidants administered to patients with age-related macular degeneration will shed light on their benefits.<P>Koch agrees that antioxidants may prove helpful in fighting a number of diseases.  He says he takes daily supplements of vitamins C and E. <P>A recent study of Chesapeake Bay fisherman found that those who wore UV-blocking glasses and caps with bills had fewer incidents of age-related cataracts than those who did not.  Koch and Lambert stress to their patients the importance of keeping eyes protected from the damaging rays of the sun.<P>"I recommend to my patients that if they're going to be outdoors for any significant period of time, particularly between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., that they have an ultraviolet filter in their glasses.  And I routinely prescribe that in my patients' spectacle lenses," Koch says. <P>Myths about the difficulty of eye surgery keep many patients from seeking treatment.  Eye surgery today is virtually painless and is performed on an outpatient basis.  Cataract removal, for example, takes less than an hour.  Patients return home the same day and are seen by the ophthalmologist the following day.  Often, patients play golf or perform their favorite activities within a week or two.<P>Regular eye examinations are vital.  Early diagnosis and treatment of an eye disease can translate to a lifetime of good vision.<P>Gripping, white-knuckled, the edge of a black abyss; searching aimlessly through the fog; running fast through a dark tunnel while the light ahead shrinks--these are dreams that put you in a cold sweat.  They are also what macular degeneration, cataracts, and glaucoma can do if you let yourself sleep.<P>The darkness can always be escaped.  You can choose to look toward the light.<P>Reprinted from The Journal, The Methdodist Hospital's quarterly magazine.<P> <hr size=4></font><center><b>

<p>
In 1994, The Methodist Hospital entered the managed care market with the goal to bring its compassionate, state-of the-art health care to more people throughout the greater Houston area.  Today, millions of people can experience Methodist's outstanding care and service both through most traditional health insurance plans and through the following managed care organizations:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Accountable Health Plan (PPO)<br>
<li>Affiliated Healthcare, Inc. (PPO and HMO)<br>
<li>Affordable (PPO)<br>
<li>Anthem Health Systems (PPO)<br>
<li>Beech Street (PPO)<br>
<li>Capp Care, Inc. (PPO)<br>
<li>Cigna (PPO and HMO)<br>
<li>Cigna Select (HMO)<br>
<li>Cost Care (PPO)<br>
<li>Equifax Healthcare Administrative Services (PPO)<br>
  (formerly Health Economics Corp.)<br>
<li>Healthcare Partners of East Texas (PPO)<br>
<li>Houston Healthcare Purchasing Organization<br>
<li>Integrated Medical Systems (EPO)<br>
<li>Managed Healthcare, Inc. (PPO)<br>
<li>MultiPlan, Inc. (PPO)<br>
<li>Plan 21 (mental health plan)<br>
<li>Prudential:<br>
     <ul>PruCare (HMO)<br>
           Prudential Plus (PPO, POS)<br>
           Prudential SeniorCare (Medicare HMO)<br>
     </ul>
<li>The Travelers Companies (MetraHealth) (PPO, POS)<br>
<li>UniCARE (Affiliated PPO) 
</ul>
<p>

To find out if you're covered by one of these plans, check your health insurance card or ask your benefits coordinator.  If your company doesn't participate in one of these plans, ask your benefits department to consider a managed care plan that would make The Methodist Hospital's outstanding care and service available to you and your coworkers.
<p>
In addition, if you are an employee of one of the following organizations, Methodist's services also are available to you:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Blue Bell Creameries USA, Inc.<br>
<li>Harris County Hospital District (through their POS plan)<br>
<li>Astrodome USA (through InfoCare PPO)<br>
<li>Baylor College of Medicine medical residents (through SelectCare POS)<br>
<li>Spring Branch ISD (through their HMO)<br>
<li>Teachers Retirement System (through TRS Coordinated Care PPO)<br>
<li>Texas Children's Hospital (through their PPO)<br>
</ul>
As these lists grow, we'll update this page to keep you informed.  But, if you're not sure whether your health plan offers you access to The Methodist Hospital, ask your benefits manager or human resources department.  Then, watch for 
<a href=/methodist/manage/choices.htm>open enrollment.</a>

<hr size=6><font size=+3><b>Open Enrollment</b></font><hr size=6></h1></center>
<p>

<p>
Have you reviewed your insurance benefits lately?  Not that an insurance policy is something you'd want to curl up to on a cold winter's night, but it's good to know what your current plan provides.  Then, you'll be ready for your company's open enrollment period.
<p>
What is open enrollment?  It's your annual chance to switch health care plans.  It's your chance to make sure that the services you need and the health care providers you want are available to you.  It's your chance to really scrutinize your health care coverage.  
<p>
At your next open enrollment, ask the health plan representatives about provisions that are most important to you.  Ask them:
<p><ul>
	<li>How many physicians are in their network.<br>
	<li>How many of those physicians are still accepting new patients.<br>
	<li>What hospitals are on the network.<br>
	<li>If their health plan includes access to a nationally renowned <a href=/methodist/health/cancer/>cancer center.</a><br>
	<li>If their health plan includes physicians and hospitals globally recognized in the fields of <a href=/methodist/health/heart/>cardiology</a>, <a href=/methodist/health/ortho/>orthopedics</a>, <a href=/methodist/health/neurology/>neurology</a> and <a href=/methodist/health/urology/>urology.</a><br>
	<li>If their health plan includes access to top experts in <a href=/methodist/health/women's/>women's health.</a><br>
	<li>If their health plan includes <a href=/methodist/constr.htm>other high-quality services</a> that you want.<br>
	<li>What services are excluded from their health plan.

</ul><br>
Go ahead.  Quiz them.  Grill them.  That's what open enrollment is all about.  Take advantage of the opportunity to make sure you and your family have access to the very best health care available.  
<p>
To find out when your employer's next open enrollment period is, contact your company's benefits manager or human resources department.

<p>
What the heck is managed care?  Why doesn't everyone just stick with good, old-fashioned health insurance?  The answer is ecomonics, pure and simple.  And this change in how health care is financed also changes the fundamental goal of health care from treating illness to keeping people healthy.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE=+2>W</FONT>hen Allison Willbern first felt
  the pain in her lower abdomen, she had more important things on her mind
  than childbearing. It was the summer of 1989, and Willbern, a Houston banking
  professional, was conducting an important audit that had &quot;career advancement&quot;
  written all over it. She felt that she simply couldn't afford to leave
  the project, even though she was bleeding profusely.</P>
  <P>&quot;Basically, I put my own personal health in jeopardy for my job,&quot;
  she explains. When she visited her gynecologist a week later, Willbern
  learned that she had suffered an ectopic pregnancy, one in which her fertilized
  egg had embedded not in her uterus, but in her fallopian tubes. The pain
  and bleeding resulted from the rupturing of her tubes. After her doctor
  surgically removed what was left of her tubes, Willbern and her husband
  &shy; who had no children at the time &shy; were faced with a dilemma that
  affects one in every twelve American couples: infertility. Later that year,
  Willbern underwent a successful in vitro fertilization (IVF) procedure
  to give birth to a girl. But subsequent attempts for another child proved
  fruitless.</P>
  <P>For the next five years, the Willberns endured a host of failed procedures.
  Finally, in March 1995, Allison learned about the success rate at Baylor
  College of Medicine's new Assisted Reproduction Technology (ART) program.
  Since beginning operations in Houston &shy; where it's housed at The Methodist
  Hospital and staffed by a team of three Methodist reproductive endocrinologists
  &shy; the program has been remarkably effective in producing pregnancies
  for its patients.</P>
  <P>During 1995, Drs. John E. Buster, Sandra Carson and Peter R. Casson
  were responsible (with the help of the hopeful parents, of course) for
  46 pregnancies, some with more than one baby, out of 115 total procedures.</P>
  <P>And on August 4, Allison Willbern delivered Thomas Austin and Christian
  Alexandria &shy; twin brother and sister.</P>
  <P>&quot;The very first patient we had in Houston got pregnant,&quot; says
  a proud Buster, director of Baylor's Division of Reproductive Endocrinology
  &amp; Infertility. &quot;Our success rates were immediately comparable
  to those of the better-known, longer-established clinics.&quot;</P>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#33FFFF"><IMG SRC="jrnparts.html/family.gif" WIDTH="279"
  HEIGHT="439" ALIGN="RIGHT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" BORDER="2"></FONT><IMG SRC=
  "jrnparts.html/spacer.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="448" ALIGN="RIGHT" NATURALSIZEFLAG=
  "0">To fully comprehend the success of ART, one must recognize that we
  live in a culture that had long treated infertility with benign neglect.
  Through the 1960s, in fact, a doctor's best advice for many patients unable
  to become impregnated was a Caribbean cruise or an alkaline douche, and
  to return for a check-up in six months.</P>
  <P>&quot;The infertile were not taken seriously. The field was a grinding,
  dragging, chronic lack of success,&quot; explains Buster, who likens some
  past infertility treatments to witch doctor-ish remedies.</P>
  <P>By the late 1960s, however, the sexual revolution had threatened to
  redefine America as the land of the infertile. Reliable birth control enabled
  people to postpone childbearing, sometimes to the age that conception is
  difficult. Furthermore, &quot;free love&quot; sometimes came with a price.</P>
  <P>&quot;As a result of the sexual liberation that characterized those
  days,&quot; says Buster, &quot;it was common to see young women with sexually
  transmitted infections that can cause severe tubule damage and lead to
  infertility.&quot;</P>
  <P>Thus, infertility treatments began to mature by the early '70s. Doctors
  employed increasingly sophisticated surgical methods, including endoscopic
  surgeries and laser procedures to remove tubule adhesions and blockage.
  In less severe cases, the procedures were somewhat successful. But patients
  with more extreme damage and little hope of conceiving.</P>
  <P>&quot;Even in the rare severe cases in which the procedures worked,&quot;
  explains Buster, &quot;it would take months &shy; even years &shy; for
  the patient to become pregnant just once.&quot; Success rates hovered around
  ten percent, and many of the women who underwent the procedures developed
  repeat blockages or had ectopic pregnancies, and were forced to undergo
  follow-up surgeries.</P>
  <P>Since 1994, when they moved ART to Baylor from the University of Tennessee
  at Memphis (where it was established in 1987), Buster, Carson and Casson
  have made steady and significant progress. Buster attributes the group's
  accomplishments to the cohesiveness and consistency that come from many
  years of working as a disciplined team.<FONT COLOR="#33FFFF"><IMG SRC=
  "jrnparts.html/doctors.gif" WIDTH="279" HEIGHT="421" ALIGN="RIGHT" NATURALSIZEFLAG=
  "3" BORDER="2"></FONT><IMG SRC="spacer.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="442" ALIGN=
  "RIGHT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"></P>
  <P>&quot;We've been together for so long that the physicians do things
  the exact same way,&quot; Buster says of the group. &quot;We adhere to
  a very strict, codified procedure book. As a result, we can always expect
  that the program will perform consistently.&quot;</P>
  <P>What sets the ART team apart from other reproductive clinics is its
  dedication to the five-step in vitro fertilization process &shy; a process
  that engenders quality control, fastidiousness and consistency. IVF involves
  the manipulation of female eggs and male sperm in a laboratory dish.</P>
  <P>&quot;IVF is the linchpin of the Baylor-Methodist infertility practice,&quot;
  explains Buster. &quot;It differs from traditional infertility therapies
  in that it doesn't depend on the presence of normally functioning tubes.
  Unfortunately, many fertility surgeries are attempts to repair diseased
  tubes, and are ineffective. Because IVF bypasses the tubes, there's very
  little surgery involved. Put very simply, all that's necessary is a uterus,
  ovaries and sperm.&quot;</P>
  <P>The first step in IVF is to place the patient on a regimen of ovulatory
  stimulating drugs that cause her to mature multiple eggs simultaneously.
  This is done in two sub-steps. In the first step, the prospective mother
  takes Lupron, a drug that makes the ovaries almost inert and produces a
  very brief &quot;pseudo-menopause&quot; during which the ovaries produce
  no hormones. The patient is then given a series of gonadotropin injections
  to stimulate ovary follicle growth and cause the ovaries to produce anywhere
  from five to 25 eggs. (The ovaries contain hundreds of thousands of eggs,
  so there's no danger of running out.)</P>
  <H4><I><FONT COLOR="#003399">Prescribing the right dosage of gonadotropins
  is a critical step.</FONT></I></H4>
  <P>&quot;The dosing is a delicate balance of science and art,&quot; says
  Buster. &quot;But one of the reasons we do it so well is that it's always
  done by one person: Dr. Sandra Carson, director of the Baylor ART Program.
  She's been doing it for more than ten years, and she really knows what
  she's doing.&quot;</P>
  <P>The second step of IVF is the recovery of the eggs. &quot;We insert
  an ultrasound probe into the vagina for guidance,&quot; says Buster, &quot;and
  then very gently insert a needle into each follicle and take the eggs out
  individually.&quot;</P>
  <P>The third step of IVF involves the collection of sperm and the actual
  in vitro fertilization of the eggs. In cases where male infertility is
  known or suspected, a method called intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI)
  may be used. For this, Baylor ART relies on Baylor's Scott Department of
  Urology, which is known throughout the world for its expertise in the process.
  Through a microsurgical technique, Larry Lipshultz, MD, a urologist at
  Methodist, is able to extract sperm from men once thought to be hopelessly
  infertile. With ICSI, individual sperm are injected into the eggs to ensure
  fertilization.</P>
  <P>&quot;The treatment of male infertility has changed considerably over
  the last two years,&quot; Carson says. &quot;Until 1992, there was nothing
  we could do other than a few conservative, ineffective procedures.&quot;</P>
  <P>But, with ICSI and other processes, sperm cells can be collected to
  then be mixed with the eggs in a laboratory environment. Fertilization
  takes place in a laboratory dish, in an incubator, in very controlled conditions.</P>
  <P>Over the next two days, the fourth step occurs, as fertilized eggs divide
  first into two cells, and again into four cells. In the final step, the
  embryos are replaced inside the patient's uterus, through a process called
  embryo transfer.</P>
  <P>&quot;The embryos are gently pulled into a very soft, tiny catheter,&quot;
  Carson explains, &quot;that is then inserted through the cervix &shy; as
  in a Pap smear &shy; into the uterus. The embryos are then released into
  the uterus.&quot;</P>
  <P>After all the activity, the waiting begins. By the seventh day after
  the procedure, the egg will attach to the wall of the uterus, and the patient
  should become pregnant. The hopeful mother makes several weekly visits
  to ensure that the pregnancy is viable.</P>
  <P>A similar assisted reproductive technique is gamete intrafallopian transfer
  (GIFT), which calls for the patient to be put under anesthesia for a laparoscopy
  procedure. The sperm and egg cells are placed directly into the intrafallopian
  tubes &shy; rather than in a laboratory incubator &shy; and there's no
  guarantee that fertilization will occur. Baylor ART performs GIFT only
  when patients cite religious objections to laboratory conception, because
  it is considerably more expensive than IVF.</P>
  <H4><I><FONT COLOR="#003399">&quot;It's really wonderful and exciting to
  be able to help a patient have a baby,&quot; Carson says, smiling. &quot;Many
  times the patients have had multiple procedures and have gone through years
  of therapy. We are usually successful in a matter of months.&quot;</FONT></I></H4>
  <P>The Willberns had their share of experiences with ineffectual fertility
  technology. They were involved with one program that actually changed procedures
  in the middle of the therapy.</P>
  <P>Many infertility clinics continue to use older methods, however, in
  large part because insurance companies still deem IVF too experimental.</P>
  <P>&quot;The insurance companies think of IVF as a black hole,&quot; says
  Buster, &quot;but they keep paying for ineffective surgeries.&quot; Buster
  continues to advocate for insurance coverage of IVF, but hasn't been successful
  thus far.</P>
  <P>Meanwhile, the procedure's success rates climb. Since the first successful
  IVF in Oldham, England, in 1979, IVF pregnancy rates have risen from slightly
  more than 1 percent in the early'80s, to 10 percent in 1987, to the 40-plus
  percentages occurring today at clinics in New York, Chicago, Brussels &shy;
  and now in Houston, at Methodist.</P>
  <P>The typical patients at Baylor ART are couples approaching their 40s
  who, for personal or career reasons, have deliberately put off raising
  families &shy; sometimes past the optimal childbearing ages of 22 to 34.</P>
  <P>&quot;People are marrying and wanting children later in life. They're
  often professionals well-established in their careers,&quot; says Buster.
  &quot;Having children wasn't something they wanted when they were younger.
  But now, as they move into their mid-30s, values and priorities change.&quot;
  And because of the Baby Boom, a lot of would-be parents are passing the
  critical years at roughly the same time.</P>
  <P>Says Buster: &quot;Every seven seconds one more baby boomer turns 50&quot;
  &shy; a rate that will continue until 2014 &shy; &quot;so, there's a large
  generation of people who want children, but can't have them because they
  waited too long.&quot;</P>
  <P>With ART serving an older clientele, Buster says that the philosophy
  there is &quot;to get the patient pregnant as quickly as possible.&quot;</P>
  <P>&quot;In the past, we would test both the sperm and female hormones
  extensively,&quot; explains Carson. &quot;Now we're thinking, 'Those things
  might be the problem, but it doesn't change the therapy.' We're spending
  less time and fewer resources on diagnostic techniques and moving directly
  to what gets patients pregnant the fastest &shy; because most patients
  don't care why they're not getting pregnant. They just want to have a baby.&quot;</P>
  <P>Baylor ART has not, however, completely excluded experimental research
  from its protocol. Recently, the physician team opened a pre-implantation
  diagnosis program, which allows doctors to diagnose genetic disorders while
  the embryo is still in the laboratory.</P>
  <P>&quot;We had a prospective father with a disease that could be passed
  off to half of his offspring,&quot; says Carson. &quot;We were able to
  implant an embryo without the disease so that he and his wife now look
  forward to a healthy baby.&quot;</P>
  <P>Another experimental treatment used at the ART is assisted hatching,
  a procedure in which Methodist doctors cut a tiny slit in the zona &shy;
  or covering &shy; around the egg, making it easier for the egg to hatch.
  This is especially beneficial for older patients, who have harder, thicker
  zona.</P>
  <P>Because they don't want to compromise Baylor ART's high success rates,
  the team makes changes to the program slowly and subtly.</P>
  <P>&quot;We change only one thing at a time,&quot; says Buster, &quot;because
  we don't want to jeopardize the system.&quot;</P>
  <P>The entire, five-step IVF treatment costs about $7,200, with an additional
  $1,800 for medication (for a grand total of less than half the cost at
  other such clinics). There are no overnight stays during the procedure,
  and patients maintain normal lifestyles throughout. The only requirements
  are that prospective mothers keep their weight under control and give up
  smoking at least four months prior to the program. And because as many
  as six fertilized eggs are placed into a patient's uterus, there's a higher
  probability for twins. Of the 46 ART pregnancies in 1995, 14 were multiple
  pregnancies &shy; 11 sets of twins, two of triplets and one of quadruplets.</P>
  <P>&quot;I have nothing but praise for Baylor ART,&quot; says Willbern,
  whose biggest worry now is keeping up with infant twins and a six-year-old.
  &quot;They're like a family. From the doctors to the nurses to the coordinators,
  everybody's on a first- name basis. They check on you, and if you beep
  them, they actually return your phone call. They're very supportive.&quot;</P>
  <P>Above all, they're successful &shy; in a way that mere numbers can't
  articulate.</P>
  <P>But Willbern can: &quot;They have turned what was the most devastating
  moment in my life into the greatest joy.&quot;</P>

  <P>That was the question posed by opponents of President Bill Clinton's
  attempt to overhaul the nation's health care system in 1994, after he campaigned
  vigorously on the issue. And the phrase seems to have caught on, for in
  this presidential election neither President Clinton nor former Senator
  Bob Dole has devoted much attention to the &quot;crisis&quot; that was
  so much on the minds of people four years ago.</P>
  <P>Why have health care issues not come up this election year &shy; just
  two years after the media, politicians, bureaucrats and academics devoted
  an awesome amount of time and energy (not to mention paper) to the question
  of reform?</P>
  <P>Why, indeed, since the core problems remain? There are still more than
  35 million uninsured Americans; the costs of doctor visits, hospital stays,
  medications and other health expenses &shy; though not rising as quickly
  as before &shy; are still more than many can afford; and Medicare funding
  is shakier than ever, possibly facing bankruptcy within six years.</P>
  <P>Part of the reason the candidates are sidestepping the issues is simply
  that it is an election year, says Mike Rock, a lobbyist for the American
  Hospital Association. Rock explains that ever since the Clinton Administration's
  frustrated endeavor to reform the health care system, the whole topic has
  become unattractive to politicians trying to get elected. The effort and
  expense required for reform, as well as the voting public's polarity on
  the issue, have led hopeful candidates to shy away from it.</P>
  <H4><FONT COLOR="#FF0033">Insurance Reform &quot;Lite&quot;</FONT></H4>
  <P>Another reason that health care has been out of the campaign spotlight
  is that, in the midst of the candidates' posturing, Congress produced its
  own scaled-down version of health care reform. The Health Coverage Availability
  and Portability Act &shy; more popularly called the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill
  after Senate sponsors Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) and Nancy Kassebaum (R-Kan.)
  &shy; passed both the Senate and the House of Representatives.</P>
  <P>While Kennedy-Kassebaum, which President Clinton signed into law in
  August, is nowhere near as comprehensive as the plan proposed by the 1994
  presidential task force, it does attempt to correct some of the problems
  brought to the forefront of the public consciousness in the last presidential
  election. Provisions of the bill include:</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000CC">* Portability</FONT> </B>&shy; The law will
    offer continuity of health insurance to workers who leave or change jobs.
    New employees will automatically be offered coverage under their new employers'
    plan, and cannot be denied coverage because of pre-existing conditions.
    Small business employees and individuals moving from group to individual
    plans also will be guaranteed coverage.</P>
    <P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000CC">* Deductions</FONT> </B>&shy; Tax deductions
    on health insurance expenses for self-employed individuals, currently at
    30 percent, would increase to 80 percent by 2006.</P>
    <P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000CC">* Fraud deterrents</FONT> </B>&shy; Prosecutors
    will be able to pursue health care fraud cases under new criminal laws,
    while fraudulent billing of Medicare and Medicaid will be subject to stiffer
    fines and penalties.</P>
    <P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000CC">* Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs)</FONT></B>
    &shy; This controversial plan was championed by conservative Republicans
    in both houses, and is being introduced on a trial basis. It will allow
    people to build savings accounts with tax-deductible funds, to be drawn
    on for medical expenses. Earnings from the accounts would be tax-exempt.</P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Since the health care debate began in the last election, MSA proponents
  have maintained that Americans would spend more wisely if they used their
  own money for health insurance, doctors visits, tests and treatments than
  when employers and insurance companies are footing the bill Opponents &shy;
  primarily Democrats &shy; fear that, because of the expense and risk, only
  the healthy and wealthy will use MSAs, leaving insurance companies to pay
  for the sick and the poor without healthier individuals to defray costs.</P>
  <P>Though MSAs made it into the bill, the provision is not as comprehensive
  as supporters would have liked. They have vowed to pursue broader acceptance
  of the accounts in the next congressional session. Bob Dole, while he was
  still in the Senate, fought for the MSA provision. Bill Clinton, on the
  other hand, has been a staunch opponent of the accounts.</P>
  <P>With the passage of Kennedy-Kassebaum, which will take effect in July
  1997, Congress has taken a small step toward reforming health care. Still,
  the law brings no relief to workers whose employers don't offer health
  coverage at all. Nor does it set limits on premiums for individual plans,
  so insurance companies could end up pricing those beyond the affordability
  of many people. It's unlikely that those concerns will be addressed by
  the next Congress, but some other controversial issues &shy; in addition
  to MSAs &shy; may be resolved in the next few years.</P>

  "0">Mental health parity, which would require employers to provide mental
  health insurance at the same level at which they provide regular health
  insurance, was not nearly so divisive an issue as that of medical savings
  accounts. Its inclusion in Kennedy-Kassebaum had bi-partisan support in
  both houses, but it was ultimately left out of the bill because the high
  cost of equal coverage for physical and mental illnesses made it unpopular
  with businesses. In spite of the expense, many legislators &shy; both Republicans
  and Democrats &shy; hope that the 1997 Congress will be successful in getting
  mental health parity passed. Dole has been fairly quiet about parity, but
  Clinton has indicated strong support for the plan.</P>
  <P>Malpractice reform also was left out of Kennedy-Kassebaum, but only
  after much partisan bickering on the subject. Republicans were pushing
  for limits on non-economic (&quot;pain and suffering&quot;) damages, but
  Democrats considered the caps anti-consumer. Whether or not malpractice
  reform will be addressed next term remains to be seen, but such legislation
  stands a better chance under Bob Dole than under Clinton, who has vocally
  denounced capping awards to plaintiffs.</P>
  <H4><FONT COLOR="#FF0033">The looming crisis</FONT></H4>
  <P>With so much effort by Congress, maybe there's no need for the presidential
  candidates to address the subject of health care. Maybe our legislators
  are committed to taking health care reform one step at a time and working
  it out themselves, without guidance from the White House.</P>
  <P>The fact is, the newly elected president will face a bigger, more divisive
  health care problem than those addressed in Kennedy-Kassebaum: the impending
  bankruptcy of Medicare. It's a topic politicians would prefer not to discuss,
  since there's only one way the trust fund can be salvaged: spending cuts,
  which will be vigorously opposed by senior citizens.</P>
  <P>Lobbyist James L. Scott, who represents Methodist and other non-profit
  health systems as director of the Premier Institute, says that the presidential
  candidates would like to keep the Medicare issue on the campaign's periphery.</P>
  <P>&quot;But,&quot; he adds, &quot;what the candidates say or don't say
  about health care between now and the election makes absolutely no difference.
  The problems in Medicare must be dealt with in '97.&quot;</P>
  <P>In reforming the immensely popular program, though, politicians will
  find themselves between a rock and a hard place. Delaying the inevitable
  cuts to Medicare will put the seriously ailing program at further risk.
  But any curtailments are likely to be felt by the beneficiaries: senior
  citizens, a powerful voting bloc who tend to express their displeasure
  with a candidate (or party) at the polls.</P>
  <P>Adding to the difficulty in reaching a resolution is, says Scott, &quot;a
  situation in which a great deal of the American people are out of touch
  with the reality of the Medicare program.</P>
  <P>&quot;A recent poll showed that people still believe that if the waste
  and fraud and abuse were squeezed out, Medicare's budget could be balanced,&quot;
  he continues. &quot;People don't realize that the system is simply overburdened.&quot;</P>
  <P>Reducing the bureaucracy and eliminating fraud could reduce Medicare
  expenditures, but not enough to salvage the program. Greater savings likely
  will be achieved through higher co-payments on the part of beneficiaries
  and lower reimbursements to hospitals, physicians and other providers.</P>
  <P>The crisis within Medicare comes not only from rising costs, but also
  from the fact that more and more people are using the benefits. And the
  number of eligible people will greatly increase in 2011, when the first
  of the Baby Boomers reach retirement age. Unfortunately, by that time,
  the Medicare trust fund is expected to be bankrupt.</P>
  <P>Of course, politicians and policy makers have known about Medicare's
  problems for some time. But recent attempts to cut expenditures &shy; or,
  actually curtail growth &shy; have been unsuccessful, largely because of
  partisan disagreement.</P>
  <P>Surprisingly, the amount of money to be cut from the program was not
  really the source of the disagreement, despite what some lawmakers would
  have voters believe.</P>
  <P>Texas Hospital Association lobbyist Joe DaSilva explains: &quot;In the
  last version of Medicare reform, Congress [the Republican, majority party]
  was proposing $168 billion in cuts, whereas the White House was looking
  at $124 billion in cuts. It's really relatively close, but most of the
  difference, the White House felt, was going to be used for tax cuts.&quot;</P>
  <P>Following the recent announcement that Medicare will run dry even sooner
  than previously thought, both Congress and the next president will have
  to find some common ground in 1997 and act to save the program. It's no
  longer a question of deficit reduction versus tax cuts &shy; any spending
  reductions will be to save Medicare.</P>
  <P>&quot;Of course, everything is significantly impacted by the fact that
  the trust fund is projected to be bankrupt by 2001 or 2002,&quot; DaSilva
  continues. &quot;That will force Congress next year to find a compromise.
  There will be a Medicare bill, not so much to deal with the deficit or
  to deal with a balanced budget, but in order to protect Medicare for a
  least a few more years beyond 2002.&quot;</P>
  <P>Cuts to Medicare's budget are a logical starting point for salvaging
  the program, but Scott believes that significant, long-term changes to
  the program will have to take place.</P>
  <P>&quot;When the Medicare program was created, it reflected the prevailing
  fee-for-service medical structure that existed in the mid-1960s,&quot;
  he explains. &quot;The organization, the delivery and the financing of
  health care have changed dramatically since then. As a result, today Medicare
  costs are going up about 10 to 11 percent a year, while private health
  insurance premiums are holding steady or going down at a rate of 1 or 2
  percent a year.&quot;</P>
  <P>Private insurance premiums are decreasing in large part because of the
  growth of managed care, and many feel that public programs like Medicare
  and</P>
  <P>Medicaid will eventually embrace managed care plans. Already, Medicare
  health maintenance organizations are popping up throughout the country.
  (Please see the related article, <I>Medicare HMOs: What You Should Know</I>).</P>
  <P>&quot;We're going to have to figure out a way to take the market efficiencies
  that have evolved in the private sector and apply those that we can to
  the public sector,&quot; Scott says. &quot;Of course, there will be questions
  about competition and choice, and not all of the private programs will
  work, but a lot of them will. Inevitably, that's going to mean fairly substantial
  growth in Medicare managed care. I think it's a given: Just as we've seen
  managed care grow rapidly in the private sector, we're going to see it
  grow in the public programs.&quot;</P>
  <P>In addition to the advent of Medicare managed care, Scott also predicts
  that the idea of Medicare as an entitlement will be challenged in the future,
  forcing the public to better understand how the program works.</P>
  <P>&quot;Many senior citizens think that they have paid into the program
  and they're going to be getting back what they paid in,&quot; he explains.
  &quot;The reality is that Medicare is a 'direct transfer' program. The
  Medicare costs of retirees of 1996 are being funded by taxes taken out
  of the paychecks of 1996 workers.&quot;</P>
  <P>One unattractive aspect of direct transfer programs like Medicare is
  that low-earning citizens sometimes subsidize those with higher incomes.</P>
  <P>Scott explains: &quot;Let's say there's a young family in which Mom
  and Dad both work, each makes $20,000 a year and they've got two kids.
  Does it make sense to tax that family to subsidize the health care of a
  retiree who's getting $200,000 a year in dividend and interest income?
  You can't make a rational economic argument for that kind of a transfer.</P>
  <P>&quot;But the problem is that nobody wants to make a rational argument
  about it,&quot; he continues. &quot;It becomes a very emotional argument
  in which seniors are saying, 'We earned this,' when really they've earned
  a portion of it. There's an enormous subsidy taking place &shy; oftentimes
  a transfer from the poor to the wealthy. In the kind of environment we're
  facing in the future, you just can't justify that.&quot;</P>
  <P>As a result, Scott thinks the coming years will find well-to-do retirees
  getting less financial support from Medicare. But he adds that major changes
  to the program won't be made immediately.</P>
  <P>He predicts instead that policy changes will occur incrementally. First,
  there will be large, short-term reductions in payments to providers &shy;
  hospitals, doctors, home health agencies. Second, Congress and the president
  will begin to discuss a Medicare managed care program. Third, policy makers
  will begin to debate the validity of Medicare as an entitlement.</P>
  <P>&quot;Politicians will be nervous about the third one,&quot; Scott admits,
  &quot;but once you do Steps One and Two and you still have not achieved
  enough savings to keep the program in line, then, Step Three comes to the
  forefront.&quot;</P>
  <H4><FONT COLOR="#FF0033">Pressing the issues</FONT></H4>
  <P>The realities of Medicare are hard, but they must be confronted to save
  the program. Of course, the problems won't be solved in the next four years,
  but, unless law makers are willing to make some difficult decisions, steps
  cannot be taken toward a resolution.</P>
  <P>&quot;Bill Clinton and Bob Dole both understand the issues perfectly
  well, and both know the right thing to do,&quot; Scott says. &quot;But
  both know the political consequences of doing the right thing.&quot;</P>
  <P>It is up to voters, Scott continues, to find out what the candidates
  really plan for Medicare and other health care matters.</P>
  <P>&quot;Voters should react to Medicare like they react to all harsh issues:
  press the candidates and press them hard.&quot;</P>
  <P>DaSilva, of the Texas Hospital Association, agrees. &quot;Politics controls
  the future of our health care,&quot; he says. &quot;Too many people do
  not participate in the process. They need to let their elected officials
  know how they feel.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>

  <P><FONT COLOR="#330066" SIZE=+2>T</FONT><FONT COLOR="#330066">oo bad we
  can't all be more like Jane Harper. When she was a kid, if it wasn't worth
  running to get somewhere, then it wasn't worth the trip (even if that trip
  was only from the bedroom to the kitchen). When Jane's mother decided to
  direct her daughter's prodigious energy into something more constructive
  than bouncing off the walls, swim lessons at the local YMCA seemed a likely
  outlet. It was the beginning of a lifelong love affair with sports, fitness
  and competition.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#330066">&quot;Years ago, they didn't have a name for hyperactive
  kids,&quot; Jane recalls. &quot;But my mother recognized that I was different.
  Swimming became my channel for all that excess energy.&quot;</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#330066">Jane's first frolics in the pool were the harbinger
  of a competitive childhood swimming career that has continued into adulthood
  as a USS Masters competitor.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#330066">&quot;Having a race to prepare for gave me a goal,&quot;
  she says. &quot;I would work to improve my stroke, my turn, even my mental
  approach. I didn't always win but evaluated my own performance. It's interesting
  to see how you do given your attitude or the training you put in.&quot;</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#330066">Now 43, with a medical career and children to
  tend, Jane trains for her latest passion, the triathlon. Not because she
  feels an obligation to stay fit, but simply because she likes to do it.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#330066">&quot;Here, there are plenty of races and competition
  at every level. Again, I check my technique, my time, my energy at different
  points. The mental puzzle is an interesting challenge.&quot;</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#330066">The benefits &shy; lower cholesterol, lower blood
  pressure, and reduced risk of cardiovascular disease &shy; are just so
  much gravy.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#330066">&quot;I think my interest in fitness started from
  pure enjoyment,&quot; she says. &quot;If I lost the fun out of it, I probably
  wouldn't do it.&quot;</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#330066">Lose the fun? The question for many of us is how
  she made it fun to begin with. With so many bad exercise experiences lurking
  in the musty gym locker of memory &shy; from the agony of a twisted ankle
  to the humiliation of a Phys Ed rope climb &shy; it's no wonder 60 percent
  of Americans don't exercise.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#330066">But no matter how many times you were picked last
  for the kickball team in elementary school, you can find an exercise or
  exercises that you will enjoy and stick with for life. Unfortunately, with
  choices ranging from weight training to water dancing &shy; and with a
  host of celebrity shills urging you to try this or that exercise video
  or equipment &shy; it's hard to determine what's right and what's wrong,
  let alone what's enjoyable. That's where this article comes in.</FONT></P>
  <H4><FONT COLOR="#0033FF">First things first: choose aerobic</FONT></H4>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#330066">Suzanne Somers may have a body that won't quit,
  and you'd like to have one, too. But don't whip out the MasterCard for
  her latest mail-order &quot;(fill-in-the-body-part)-Master&quot; just yet.
  Take some time to cut through the clutter of the advertising hype and narrow
  your exercise choices intelligently.</FONT></P>

  "0"><FONT COLOR="#330066">The first thing every would-be exerciser needs
  to know is this: If you want to improve your cardiovascular health and
  reduce your risk of heart disease, then activities like gardening, golf
  or even tennis won't do the trick, (although any activity is better for
  you than being a recliner statue). The only thing that will work is aerobic
  exercise, which will condition your heart while toning the rest of your
  body. According to David Samuels, MD, a cardiologist at The Methodist Hospital,
  virtually anyone can benefit from this type of exercise, regardless of
  their age or physical condition.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#330066">&quot;Even if you </FONT><IMG SRC="jrnparts.html/spacer.gif"
  WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="134" ALIGN="RIGHT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"><FONT COLOR="#330066">already
  have cardiovascular problems, it can enhance the amount of exertion you're
  able to do,&quot; he says. &quot;There are some rare people who are so
  incapacitated by their cardiac conditions that they are unable to perform
  any exercise. But if someone is able to perform exercise, then the investment
  in time and effort for better health is most definitely worth it.&quot;</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#330066">Any activity that uses the large muscle groups
  (legs, back, chest), is rhythmic or fluid in nature and can be maintained
  for extended periods of time is classified as aerobic (or oxygen-using).
  </FONT></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#330066">Examples of aerobic exercises include:</FONT></I></B></P>

  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#330066">If you don't see anything that interests you,
  don't worry &shy; this list is not all-inclusive. Any vigorous activity
  that can be done non-stop for extended periods, including in-line skating,
  stair climbing or even boxing, may qualify as aerobic exercise. Think you
  could turn housecleaning into an aerobic workout? How about that daily
  walk to the bus stop? Use your imagination, but keep in mind that stop-and-go
  activities &shy; even tiring ones like racquetball or basketball &shy;
  usually don't keep the heart rate elevated for long enough at a stretch
  to be of sufficient benefit. (See section on determining your target heart
  rate at the end of this story.)</FONT></P>
  <H4><FONT COLOR="#0033FF">Choosing the aerobic regimen</FONT></H4>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#330066">Getting fit doesn't have to mean running laps
  until your lungs burst or climbing onto a treadmill every night after work.
  You can dance, you can swim, you can do anything you want as long as it
  achieves the desired effect (raising the heart rate high enough for long
  enough). Fortunately, there are a lot of aerobic options out there, and
  most of them will yield comparable results.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#330066">&quot;There is not a large amount of difference
  in types of aerobic exercise,&quot; says Samuels. &quot;What we're looking
  to achieve is elevation of the heart rate. That's the bottom line.&quot;</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#330066">It takes time to learn and feel comfortable at
  any aerobic activity. Consider that part of the accomplishment. As you
  improve your skill you can focus on maintaining a level to reap cardiovascular
  benefits. You build the foundation for a lifetime skill.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#330066">So the choice is yours. And fitness experts agree
  that the best choice is the one that you will stick with for the long term.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#330066">&quot;These are life decisions, not getting-ready-for-the-daughter's-wedding
  decisions,&quot; says William Bryan, MD, an orthopedic surgeon at Methodist
  and an expert in sports medicine. &quot;Not many people who enter aerobic
  programs can expect to see or feel marked improvement for the first six
  to eight weeks.&quot;</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#330066">How do you persist with a program that long, when
  your past attempts at exercise haven't stretched beyond six to eight days?
  That's where the fun factor comes in. &quot;In order to have an exercise
  program that people will stay with,&quot; says Samuels, &quot;they've got
  to enjoy it.&quot;</FONT></P>
  <H4><FONT COLOR="#0033FF">Exercise: Enjoy it for a lifetime</FONT></H4>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#330066">Jane Harper, who started competing in triathlons
  in 1987 in Florida, can think of few things she'd rather do.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#330066">&quot;I think one thing leads to the other,&quot;
  says Harper, a medical technician and part-time fitness instructor. &quot;I
  enjoy being outside, being in the water and riding a bike. We also lived
  at the beach where the races were held. How could I resist? The fitness
  aspect emerges from that.&quot;</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#330066">What's so much fun about participating in a grueling
  schedule of cycling, running and swimming competitions?</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><IMG SRC="jrnparts.html/aerobicn.gif" WIDTH="180"
  HEIGHT="248" ALIGN="RIGHT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" BORDER="1"></FONT><IMG SRC=
  "jrnparts.html/spacer.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="267" ALIGN="RIGHT" NATURALSIZEFLAG=
  "0"><FONT COLOR="#330066">&quot;I never considered it grueling, just part
  of my hobby,&quot; Jane explains. &quot;Among other things I enjoy is the
  camaraderie. Getting involved in fitness can lead to new friendships and
  associations that one never would have made sitting at home.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#330066">&quot;There is no discrimination because you're
  at a different level than someone else,&quot; says Harper. &quot;It's all
  a matter of effort and enjoyment. The competition challenges us to do our
  best, whether to improve or to place in the standings. It gives us a goal
  to work toward.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#330066">&quot;But nobody's taking roll, nobody's considering
  your age or economic status. Some people don't want to compete, and that's
  OK. You're doing something you enjoy, and you've got to recognize what
  you want out of it.&quot;</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#330066">What you want &shy; and need &shy; is something
  that brings pleasure, not pain. The pleasure, for example, of being on
  the bike trail with friends on a crisp fall morning, or of feeling your
  body glide porpoise-like through the cool water of a sparsely crowded swimming
  pool or open water.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#330066">&quot;The no-pain, no-gain principle is not valid,&quot;
  says Pete Nelson, an exercise physiologist at Methodist's Institute for
  Preventive Medicine. &quot;You should never feel like you've got to hurt
  yourself to achieve aerobic fitness. And it does no good to get on a treadmill
  if you hate treadmills. Picking something you like will help you stick
  with it.&quot;</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#330066">Once you've mastered this idea &shy; that exercise
  needn't leave your mind numb, your muscles torn and your joints aching
  &shy; it may be easier to think of physical activity as something other
  than an unpleasant chore. The key, says Nelson, is to start slow &shy;
  thereby avoiding frustration and injury at the outset. Don't try to run
  a marathon your first day at the track; give yourself time to build up
  skills and endurance and begin enjoying exercise for its own sake.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#330066">As Samuels points out, &quot;the people who tend
  to be dedicated to exercise have been doing it long enough to reap its
  benefits.&quot; If higher energy levels, improved self-esteem and a reduced
  risk of heart attack sound like they'd be worth the effort, then it's time
  to find an exercise that's right for you. You can narrow the choices by
  asking yourself a few simple questions:</FONT></P>
  <H4><I><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Am I physically able to do this?</FONT><FONT
   COLOR="#FF3300"> </FONT></I></H4>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#330066">Your age and physical condition may dictate the
  types of exercise you will be able to do. Overweight individuals and people
  with arthritis or other joint problems, for example, should avoid activities
  like jogging and rope-skipping and concentrate on non-weight-bearing exercises
  such as swimming or biking. Your doctor will be able to recommend the types
  of exercise that are appropriate for you.</FONT></P>
  <H4><I><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Will I be doing this a year from now?</FONT></I></H4>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#330066">The exercise should be something that won't bore
  or frustrate you and will sustain your interest over time. Keep in mind,
  one specific exercise can yield many varieties of workouts.</FONT></P>
  <H4><I><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Does this type of exercise fit my lifestyle?
  </FONT></I></H4>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#330066">Try to match your exercise to the type of life
  you lead, rather than rearranging your life to accommodate your exercise.
  If you're working and have kids at home, will you really use that gym membership?
  If you're single and live in a small apartment, do you really want to sit
  on a stationary bicycle in front of your TV four nights a week?</FONT></P>
  <H4><I><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Is this the sort of thing I can do year-round?
  </FONT></I></H4>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#330066">Jogging and cycling will be impossible during
  winter months in some areas. Extreme summer heat can make outdoor exercise
  unpleasant and even dangerous.</FONT></P>
  <H4><I><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Does this exercise match my personality? </FONT></I></H4>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#330066">Take a few minutes to think about activities other
  than exercise that you enjoy. Do you prefer pursuits that allow you to
  lose yourself in the experience, or do you get pleasure from achieving
  quantitative gains? If the former appeals to you, you might want to stick
  with exercises (jogging, cycling, aerobic dance) that allow you to concentrate
  more on the background music or the scenery than on how many laps or repetitions
  you've completed. If you're very sociable, choose something you can do
  with a friend. A 20-minute walk will fly by when you're sharing a conversation
  with a friend.</FONT></P>
  <H4><FONT COLOR="#0033FF">Don't be afraid to experiment</FONT></H4>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#330066">That wasn't so hard, was it? It only took you
  a few minutes to determine that you could never fit that cross-country
  skiing machine into your living room, or that long jogs on hard pavement
  won't do wonders for those creaky knees of yours.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#330066">Now that you've narrowed the field, it may be
  time to try a few of the more appealing activities on for size. If you'll
  need access to equipment, this is where a short-term gym membership might
  prove helpful.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#330066">&quot;There are all kinds of exercise machines
  on the market today, but it's expensive to go out and buy all that stuff,&quot;
  says Bryan. &quot;Even if you don't want to join a health club for the
  long run, you can get a month's membership, give everything a try and find
  out what works for you.&quot;</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#330066">&quot;Every machine has its pluses and minuses,&quot;
  adds Nelson. &quot;On skiing machines, some people just can't get the motion
  down properly. And getting on a treadmill or stationary bike is just boring
  for some people.&quot;</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#330066">If walking or pedaling to nowhere isn't to your
  liking, you can test other types of exercise &shy; swimming, rowing, running,
  roller-skating, whatever. Regardless of the activity, push yourself only
  to the point of fatigue &shy; even if that means some very short workouts
  at the beginning. And don't be discouraged if you wake up a little stiff
  and sore after your first few workouts.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#330066">&quot;Soreness is the way it's going to be with
  anybody at first,&quot; says Bryan. &quot;You've just got to be very patient
  while your body adjusts to accommodate the physical activity. But if you
  exercise and it hurts for more than three or four days afterward, you need
  to say 'this is more than accommodation' and rest. If the pain persists,
  see your doctor.&quot; </FONT></P>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#330066">Once you've decided on some suitable exercises,
  you can also experiment with ways to keep yourself from getting bored with
  your routine. One of the best ways to do this is by &quot;cross-training&quot;
  &shy; including a number of different exercises in your weekly regimen.
  This approach will help prevent monotony and leave you with fewer reasons
  to quit altogether should one exercise begin to cause you trouble.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#330066">&quot;Don't get addicted to just one type of exercise,&quot;
  advises Bryan. &quot;Be versatile. If you sustain an injury with that type
  of exercise, you need to be comfortable switching to something else so
  you won't lose a step.&quot;</FONT></P>
  <H4><FONT COLOR="#0033FF">Keep your eyes on the prize</FONT></H4>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#330066">Injury and discouragement are the bane of any
  exercise program. Avoid these setbacks, and you could end up like the women
  in the water exercise classes taught by Harper.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#330066">&quot;The older ladies, once I get them in the
  water and they discover how good they feel, undergo a kind of transformation
  &shy; it's like they almost must be there.&quot;</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#330066">When it comes down to it, feeling good (toned,
  relaxed, confident) is what you're shooting for. It's the feeling that
  will keep you coming back to the gym or returning to the track despite
  the weather, the lack of time on your schedule or the fact that you're
  feeling &quot;blah.&quot; Reaching the point where you associate exercise
  with feeling good will take a little time, and until then it's important
  to maintain your perspective.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#330066">&quot;Keep a positive perspective,&quot; Harper
  advises. &quot;Don't berate yourself if you miss a day or don't improve

  what you started and associate the activity with the good things you do.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#330066">&quot;Have realistic goals and expectations. Don't
  be afraid to accept your level as your level. Remember, you're doing this
  for yourself &shy; there's nobody paying you to do it .&quot;</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#330066">In a sense, though, you're paying yourself in

    <H2 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Where the Choices End</FONT></H2>
    <P><FONT COLOR="#330066">The variety of options gives you a lot of discretion
    in choosing exercises that will mesh with your schedule, personality and
    lifestyle. Keep in mind, however, that there are some things that every
    aerobic exercise program should have in common:</FONT></P>
    <P><B><FONT COLOR="#330066">Doctor approval.</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#330066">
    First of all, and most important, anyone preparing to undertake an exercise
    program should consult a doctor and follow physician guidelines in pursuing
    a fitness plan.</FONT></P>
    <P><B><FONT COLOR="#330066">Warm-up and cool-down.</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#330066">
    All workouts, regardless of the type of exercise, should include three
    components: a warm-up to ensure that muscles are properly stretched before
    exercising, the main workout and a cool-down session to allow the heart
    rate to return gradually to its resting state. A rule of thumb is to spend
    20 percent of your exercise session warming up and another 20 percent cooling
    down. </FONT></P>
    <P><B><FONT COLOR="#330066">Progression.</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#330066">
    The best gauge of how well your exercise program is working is whether
    or not you are progressing, that is, making gains in your endurance level
    as measured by the duration and intensity of your workout. While no one's
    potential for progress is infinite, you should continue to see gains in
    endurance for some time after you begin your program. The best way to achieve
    these gains is to gradually extend the intensity and duration of the exercise
    beyond what your body is accustomed to. &quot;Exercise is a long-term phenomenon,&quot;
    says David Samuels, MD, a cardiologist at The Methodist Hospital, &quot;People
    should train and condition themselves by doing what they can do to the
    point of fatigue and then stopping.&quot;</FONT></P>

    <H2><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Hitting the &quot;Heart Target&quot;</FONT></H2>
    <P><FONT COLOR="#330066">To achieve cardiovascular fitness, you should
    be exercising three to five times per week, keeping your heart rate in
    a target range for 20 to 45 minutes per session. This may not be possible
    at first, but your initial efforts should focus on reaching the minimum
    exercise duration and frequency as soon as you can.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT COLOR="#330066">To calculate your optimal target range, you'll
    first need to determine your resting heart rate. Do this by taking your
    pulse for 60 seconds. Next, use the simple formula at the right to determine
    your target heart rate zone.</FONT></P>

    </BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><FONT COLOR="#330066">When first starting your exercise program, you'll
    need to take your pulse periodically to see whether you are in your target
    range. Try to keep moving while taking your pulse so your heart rate doesn't
    have a chance to decrease. If your heart rate is below the target, you
    should increase the intensity of your workout. If it's above the target,
    you should ease off the throttle.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT COLOR="#330066">&quot;Taking your pulse is not something you'll
    have to do forever, just until you get accustomed to interpreting what
    your body's trying to tell you,&quot; says Pete Nelson of Methodist's Institute
    for Preventive Medicine. &quot;What we try to teach people to do is break
    the workout down a little bit, take the heart rate five minutes into it
    to see if you need to speed up or slow down. In the beginning, some individuals
    may need to take their heart rate a few times during their exercise session
    and not just once at the first five-minute mark.&quot;</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT COLOR="#330066">Keep in mind that depending on your physical condition,
    your doctor may advise you not to reach the upper end of your target heart
    range. In this case you'll want to concentrate on increasing the duration
    rather than the intensity of your workout. No one, says Nelson, should
    try to increase duration and intensity simultaneously.</FONT></P>

  <P>What was once considered the un-chic companion of G.I. Joe, used car
  salesmen and &quot;The Odd Couple&quot;'s Oscar Madison now has become
  the magnifi-chic mouthpiece of Hollywood leading men, trend-setting supermodels
  and high-powered business execs of both genders.</P>
  <P>Cigars have recently made a stronger comeback than disco music and John
  Travolta. The cigar industry estimates that more than 10 million Americans
  &shy; 99.9 percent of them men &shy; now regularly smoke cigars, a jump
  of about 2 million since an all-time low in 1993. The return of the cigar
  has opened the doors to private cigar clubs, cigar cruises and cigar sampling
  nights complete with cognac. There are even high-dollar dinner parties
  for cigar smokers only and a glossy magazine called <I>Cigar Aficionado</I>,
  which featured on one of its covers Tom Selleck's puffing kisser.</P>
  <P><IMG SRC="jrnparts.html/cigars.gif" WIDTH="207" HEIGHT="244" ALIGN=
  "RIGHT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">Ah, the glamour of it all. And why not? Cigars
  are harmless, the perfect safe substitute for cigarettes, right? For instance,
  George Burns made it to the ripe old age of 100 and was known to bathe
  while smoking cigars.</P>
  <P>That's the smoke screen. Studies demonstrate otherwise. While smoking
  cigars may not be quite as fatal as smoking cigarettes, which are inhaled
  more frequently, there is no doubt that cigars can lead to cancer and other
  deadly diseases. Even if they aren't inhaled.</P>
  <P>And the sidestream smoke that is unavoidable to bystanders is at least
  as carcinogenic as cigarette smoke.</P>
  <P>&quot;In general, most people, except for perhaps cigarette smokers,
  don't inhale cigars, so the toxic effect on the lungs is a little bit less,&quot;
  says Donald Donovan, MD, an otolaryngologist at The Methodist Hospital.
  &quot;But because of the direct contact of the tobacco to mouth tissues,
  the regular cigar smoker is at increased risk for lip, oral cavity and
  throat cancers. In addition to that risk, there are the dental dangers
  involved with regular cigar smoking, such as gum disease.&quot;</P>
  <P>The American Lung Association cites several myths about the &quot;safety&quot;
  of cigar smoking. The biggest myths are that cigars are a safe alternative
  to cigarettes, that cigar smoking is not addictive and that smoking cigars
  does not cause lung cancer or chronic pulmonary disease.</P>
  <H4>But these are the facts:</H4>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>* Cigar smoking raises the risk of dying from cancers of the larynx,
    mouth, esophagus and lungs four to 10 times. Over all, men who smoke cigars
    have death rates from cancer that are 34 percent higher than those of nonsmokers.</P>
    <P>* Cigar smokers are more likely than nonsmokers to develop chronic obstructive
    lung disease, although the risk is lower than that of cigarette smokers.
    Studies show that the risk of lung disease is as much as 360 percent higher
    for cigar smokers than nonsmokers.</P>
    <P>* Heart and blood vessels can be damaged by nicotine, the addictive
    drug released by tobacco use, even if not inhaled. Nicotine can be absorbed
    into the blood stream through the mouth.</P>
    <P>* Nicotine is released during the use of any tobacco product, including
    cigars.</P>
    <P>* Passive cigar smoke is a more insidious poison than that from cigarettes,
    according to the Environmental Protection Agency.</P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Ah, the gamble of it all. Perhaps cigar smoking clubs are the yuppie
  equivalent to teenagers smoking in the high school bathroom. Unfortunately,
  the health risks are dangerously similar, as well.</P>
  <P>&quot;Cigar smoking is terribly faddish right now, and will probably
  continue to be so for a couple of years, until something else comes along,&quot;
  says Donovan.</P>
  <P>&quot;But history has given us some famous examples of the risks associated
  with regular cigar smoking,&quot; adds Donovan. &quot;Both President Ulysses
  Grant and baseball legend Babe Ruth were cigar smokers who died of throat
  cancer.&quot; Jack &quot;Oscar&quot; Klugman developed throat cancer, too.</P>

  <P>For decades, store-bought bread offered only the dilemma of brand-name
  selection: Wonder vs. ButterKrust vs. Mrs. Baird's. Then came the granola-happy
  '70s and it wasn't so simple. Pre-sliced, plastic-wrapped bread &shy; for
  years as fluffy and white as unsweetened marshmallows &shy; now came in
  a variety of hues and textures. It was no longer a question of brand-name
  loyalty; it had to do with <I>nutrition</I>... and good parenting.</P>
  <P><IMG SRC="jrnparts.html/breadnew.gif" WIDTH="250" HEIGHT="182" ALIGN=
  "RIGHT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">T hough white bread is a &quot;comfort food&quot;
  for many kids, parents urge their children to try wheat, overriding arguments
  of &quot;white's delicious&quot; with &quot;wheat's nutritious.&quot;</P>
  <P>In fact, maybe no more nutritious than white. Marita Carlson, a registered
  dietitian at The Methodist Hospital, says most wheat bread is virtually
  indistinguishable from white when it comes to nutritive value.</P>
  <P>&quot;There is not much difference between 'soft' wheat bread and white
  bread,&quot; says Carlson, pointing out that the vitamin content of most
  supermarket breads is comparable. For instance, all such breads &shy; wheat
  and white &shy; contain the minerals calcium and iron and the B vitamins
  thiamin, ribo-flavin and niacin in roughly the same amounts. And both types
  have negligible amounts of fat and usually no saturated fat or cholesterol.
  The only advantage of wheat bread over white is that wheat <I>sometimes</I>
  has a higher fiber content.</P>
  <P>Fiber is one of the keys to eating well, helping both adults and children
  maintain good intestinal and colonic health. But finding high fiber foods
  isn't always easy and, when it comes to bread, looks can be deceiving.
  Depending on the brand, white bread sometimes prevails even in the fiber
  category.</P>
  <P>A slice of Wonder Kids white bread, for example, has as much dietary
  fiber (two grams) as a slice of Wonder 100% Stoneground Whole Wheat, and
  more than twice as much as a slice of Wonder Family Wheat. Wonder's line
  of &quot;light&quot; breads, which contain cellulose to increase their
  bulk, all have between two and three grams of fiber per slice &shy; and
  this includes the white varieties as well as the healthier-sounding Wonder
  Light Nine Grain and Wonder Light Oatmeal.</P>
  <P>With few breads yielding more than two grams of fiber per slice, Carlson
  says, it's more important to consider the inside rather than the outside
  of the sandwich.</P>
  <P>&quot;If you eat white bread, but it's a veggie sandwich, that's better
  for you than eating a whole-wheat sandwich filled with pastrami and salami
  and balogna.&quot;</P>
  <P>And if you want to make sure your bread is contributing the maximum
  to your recommended daily fiber intake of 20 to 35 grams, Carlson says,
  &quot;you definitely need to look at the label.&quot;</P>

  <P>Time. Depending on your source, it flies, it's money, it waits for no
  man. It's also the No. 1 reason for not exercising, according to a recent
  survey.</P>
  <P>In fact, although the many benefits of exercise &shy; weight loss, lower
  blood pressure, lower cholesterol, increased energy, enhanced self-esteem
  &shy; have been widely reported, some 60 percent of Americans engage in
  no leisure-time activity whatsoever, let alone the kind of rigorous aerobic
  exercise advocated by health experts. (See related feature: <I>Do sweat
  It!</I>) And more often than not, the excuse is lack of time.</P>
  <P><IMG SRC="jrnparts.html/newclock.gif" WIDTH="180" HEIGHT="141" ALIGN=
  "RIGHT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">David Samuels, MD, a cardiologist at The Methodist
  Hospital, says he hears this frequently from his patients. But he wonders
  if they have really tried to make time for exercise &shy; any kind of exercise.</P>
  <P>&quot;I have less time during the day than a lot of working people,
  but I still find time to climb stairs at work,&quot; he says. &quot;All
  too often I see people getting on the elevator to go the equivalent of
  a single flight of stairs.&quot;</P>
  <P>Gradually introducing more activity into your daily routine (taking
  the stairs instead of the elevator, walking to lunch instead of driving)
  can get you into the exercise habit without unduly crimping your schedule.
  When you're ready to start a more serious program, here are some other
  ways to overcome the &quot;no time&quot; excuse:</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>* Make exercise a priority. Something that will make you feel better,
    look better and have more energy should be at the top of your &quot;to
    do&quot; list, not relegated to the &quot;when I get around to it&quot;
    file.</P>
    <P>* Keep to a schedule. Write your exercise time on your calendar, treating
    it as you would an important meeting or appointment.</P>
    <P>* Work out with a partner. You're less likely to skip an exercise session
    if doing so means letting someone else down.</P>
    <P>* Do something else while exercising. Multi-tasking is the buzzword
    of the '90s. Apply the concept to fitness by exercising while you watch
    the evening news, listen to an book-on-tape or even learn a new language
    via cassette.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, it's not enough to find the time for physical activity.
    To deliver the benefits of fitness, exercise must be a long-term, lifetime
    pursuit. Sticking with a program is often more difficult than starting
    one. The following suggestions should help you keep yourself interested
    and on track:</P>
    <P><B><FONT COLOR="#0033FF">* Start off slowly.</FONT></B> Doing too much
    too soon may cause injuries that will give you an excuse to quit altogether.</P>
    <P><B><FONT COLOR="#0033FF">* Multi-task.</FONT></B> If exercise in itself
    doesn't interest you, choose an activity that will allow you to read, listen
    to music or watch television at the same time.</P>
    <P><B><FONT COLOR="#0033FF">* Team up.</FONT></B> A workout &quot;buddy&quot;
    can offer support. Join a running or cycling club. Or, if you want to splurge,
    a qualified personal trainer will keep you focused.</P>
    <P><B><FONT COLOR="#0033FF">* Reward yourself.</FONT></B> For example,
    don't let yourself go on that shopping trip before you've done your workout
    for the day. Got some new some new computer software? Keep the wrapper
    on the box until after your exercise session.</P>
    <P><B><FONT COLOR="#0033FF">* Think positively.</FONT></B> Even if you're
    not in the mood to exercise, put on your shoes and walk to the corner.
    Tell yourself you can always go home when you want.</P>

  <P>How does the old saying go? &quot;You never get a second chance to make
  a first impression.&quot;</P>
  <P>Those who suffer from nail fungus don't have much trouble remembering
  that adage. They live it. Discoloration, brittleness, even the loss of
  a nail may accompany this affliction, leaving even the most self-assured
  sitting on their hands.</P>
  <P><IMG SRC="jrnparts.html/fungus.gif" WIDTH="180" HEIGHT="162" ALIGN=
  "RIGHT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">When a nail suffers trauma that separates the
  nail plate &shy; the top of the nail to which polish is applied &shy; from
  the nail bed &shy; the pinkish undernail &shy; the resulting conditions
  provide a fertile breeding ground for infectious agents. So, the solution
  seems simple enough: avoid the trauma, avoid the fungus. That's the key
  says Ida Orengo, MD, a dermatologist at The Methodist Hospital. She advises
  that a bout with nail fungus doesn't have to be long-term and can often
  be prevented.</P>
  <P>The irony, though, is that not only has the act of disrupting the nail
  bed become commonplace, but it also is often marketed as a hygienic practice.</P>
  <P>&quot;Avoid having your cuticles cut during a manicure,&quot; says Orengo.
  &quot;It's okay to push the cuticle back, but it's there for a reason &shy;
  to protect the nail bed.&quot; What's more, skipping the cuticle trim minimizes
  the chance for infection only by half.</P>
  <P>To thoroughly guard against a host of infections, all manicure instruments
  must be properly sanitized with an antiseptic. Still not willing to take
  your chances? Orengo advises her patients to bring their own instruments
  when unfamiliar or uncomfortable with the sanitization methods used by
  a manicurist.</P>
  <P>Unfortunately, the threat of fungus is not limited to the fingernails.
  And when given the choice, most people would probably opt for the toenail
  variety. At least you can cover it up with a shoe or hide it in a dark
  sock all day. But those who have toenail fungus should know that while
  it may be less visible, fungus on the toenails can be even more of a nuisance
  when it comes to finding a lasting cure. Because bacteria and fungi thrive
  in warm, moist and dark environments, covering feet with shoes and socks
  only encourages their growth.</P>
  <P>So, you've got it. It's too late to talk about prevention; now, you
  just want it and the embarrassment to go away. If a fungus is affecting
  only one nail, help is at the closest drug store.</P>
  <P>Regular applications of topical gel, cream or lotion &shy; like Lotrimin,
  Micatin or Tinactin&shy; available over the counter may do the trick. But
  if there's no visible improvement after a few months or if the fungus spreads
  to more than one nail, you need to see a doctor.</P>
  <P>A dermatologist may prescribe one of two drugs that come in pill form.
  Sporonox is the more familiar of the two because it's been on the market
  longer and is often advertised in popular news magazines. Lamisil was introduced
  more recently and, like Sporonox, can be administered as a &quot;pulse
  therapy.&quot; The advantage of this type of therapy is that patients need
  take the medication for only a week out of each month &shy; for three or
  four months &shy; instead of every day. With Sporonox, the medication binds
  to the nail plate, so the area will remain fungus-free for up to eight

  <P>So, before you resolve to hiding your hands and feet from the world
  forever, see your doctor. Finding a lasting cure is easier and more liberating
  than you ever imagined &shy; and more likely than gloves coming back into
  style as everyday wear.</P>

  <P><FONT SIZE=+2>M</FONT>ichael Russo is an exception to a disturbing rule.
  At 63, he is a healthy male, recently retired, who gets regular check ups.
  As long as he can remember, he's been visiting his doctor for routine physicals
  every two years. He doesn't take his health for granted.</P>

  WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="194" ALIGN="RIGHT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0">&quot;It's like
  going in and having your teeth cleaned every six months,&quot; says Russo.
  &quot;It's foolish not to.&quot; Foolish or not, men don't see the doctor
  nearly as often as women. Statistics show that over the course of a lifetime,
  women visit the doctor 150 percent as often as men. The problem is so bad
  that, in 1994, the United States Congress declared a &quot;National Men's
  Health Week.&quot;</P>
  <P>The joint resolution cited treatable cancers &shy; such as testicular,
  prostate and colon &shy; that are claiming far more lives than they should.
  It also urged men to be more active in preventing health problems before
  they happen &shy; by visiting their doctor more regularly.</P>
  <P>Russo knows a number of people his age, however, who aren't as conscientious
  &shy; or as lucky &shy; as he is with regard to their health.</P>
  <P>&quot;A lot of people I associate with now, since I'm retired, are in
  their 60s and 70s, and many of them have major problems, such as prostate
  cancer and heart disease.&quot;</P>
  <P>Russo attributes much of this to a lack of prevention on the part of
  the individual. Indeed, millions of dollars are spent each year fighting
  male-dominated maladies, such as heart disease and certain types of cancer.
  This money (and many lives) could be saved if only preventive measures
  are taken. The challenge, however, is getting men to take their health
  seriously.</P>
  <P>&quot;We have a lot of male patients who don't come in,&quot; says Martin
  Basaldua, MD, a family physician in Kingwood, Texas, and Medical Director
  of The Methodist Medical Group, a group of primary care physicians affiliated
  with Methodist Health Care System. &quot;We have close to a 50-50 ratio
  of men to women patients, but we certainly see more women in our office.&quot;</P>
  <P>According to Basaldua, there is a sub-group of people &shy; men and
  women &shy; who are very good about getting routine exams. However, the
  women tend to come in on their own; the men come in out of anxiety.</P>
  <P>&quot;It may be a friend or relative who is sick or has died,&quot;
  he says. &quot;It may be something they've read. Whatever the case, men
  begin to think, 'Wait a minute, I haven't had a physical in five years!'&quot;</P>
  <H4><FONT COLOR="#CC3300">Why Men Don't Go</FONT></H4>
  <P>While men are notorious for avoiding the doctor when they're feeling
  good, they are just as bad when they are sick.</P>
  <P>&quot;Very often, I see men who don't come in until after they've been
  sick for quite some time,&quot; Basaldua says. &quot;They don't want to
  miss work. In many cases, their doctors are where they live, not where
  they work, especially in Houston, which is so spread out. They perceive
  it as a hassle to see the doctor.&quot;</P>
  <P>Inconvenience may be one excuse men use for not getting check ups; a
  far more common reason, however, is fear. Basaldua feels that many male
  patients are scared of what they might find out when they go to the doctor.</P>
  <P>&quot;I think this phenomenon still exists, though maybe not as much
  as it used to. Men tend to think that serious illness &shy; like heart
  disease &shy; is not going to happen to them.&quot;</P>
  <P>Kristen Nerz, an exercise physiologist with Methodist Health Care System's
  Institute for Preventive Medicine (IPM), agrees with Basaldua. She regularly
  visits Houston-area companies to conduct preventive screenings for employees.
  The screenings include some of the components of a basic physical, such
  as blood pressure and cholesterol tests.</P>
  <P>&quot;Most of the men are becoming a little more educated about their
  health,&quot; says Nerz. &quot;It's not that they are ignorant so much
  as they're scared. They don't want to know if something is wrong.</P>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><IMG SRC="jrnparts.html/results.gif" WIDTH="150"
  HEIGHT="240" ALIGN="RIGHT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" BORDER="4"></FONT><IMG SRC=
  "jrnparts.html/spacer.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="260" ALIGN="RIGHT" NATURALSIZEFLAG=
  "0">That's when we run into the problems of someone not taking action.&quot;</P>
  <P>To combat the fear, Nerz and other IPM professionals emphasize one positive
  aspect of prevention.</P>
  <P>&quot;Early detection makes a huge difference, especially with the cancers
  that typically strike men,&quot; she says. &quot;Almost any disease is
  treatable if it's caught early. I think men are beginning to understand
  this.&quot;</P>
  <P>Basaldua cites another factor that may be responsible for men (and women)
  not seeing the doctor: the large gap between regular check ups that kids
  experience between the ages of five (the preschool check up) and 15 (when
  kids competing in athletics are required to get physicals).</P>
  <P>Kids don't remember all of their doctor visits during their first year
  of life for immunizations and well-baby check ups. Once babies get past
  their first year, routine physicals are often not done.</P>
  <P>The next time they visit a doctor is when they're about five years old
  &shy; just before school &shy; and they probably don't remember that, either.</P>
  <P>&quot;Unless they go in for an athletic physical, or if they're ill,
  kids and adolescents don't get accustomed to seeing the doctor regularly,&quot;
  he says.</P>
  <P>The result, oftentimes, is a built-in reluctance to see the doctor in
  early adulthood. And, once this behavior becomes habit, it's often hard
  to break.</P>
  <P>Another learned behavior Basaldua sees involves parents. &quot;If parents
  are health care conscientious, then the kids grow up and become so, too.
  If parents rarely visit the doctor, the kids learn that they don't go to
  the doctor unless they are really sick.&quot;</P>
  <H4><FONT COLOR="#CC3300">Let's Get Physicals</FONT></H4>
  <P>For men who have avoided the doctor entirely, and for those whose last
  check up was several years ago or more, Nerz recommends getting a physical
  immediately. The result will be a &quot;baseline&quot; against which future
  check ups can be measured.</P>
  <P>&quot;If something does go wrong later on,&quot; she says, &quot;a doctor
  will have a baseline of normal vital signs to compare it to. It gives the
  doctor a more complete picture of the patient to determine proper treatment
  strategies.&quot;</P>
  <P>Basaldua says a routine physical at age 30 includes the standard hands-on
  check up, as well as lab testing for cholesterol and diabetes. Cholesterol,
  he adds, is a good indicator of potential, more serious problems, including
  heart disease, stroke, kidney disease or atherosclerosis.</P>
  <P>&quot;Unfortunately, most men don't start thinking about cholesterol-related
  problems until they reach age 40,&quot; he says. &quot;This is a milestone
  age for men. They start to realize that they are mortal. At that age, we
  recommend getting examined at least every other year, and at age 50, every
  year, depending upon the patient.&quot;</P>
  <P>At age 40, the physical checklist also includes a stress test, which
  should be repeated every four to five years, depending on certain factors:
  heredity and smoking, among other things. Basaldua also recommends testing
  for colon cancer every three to five years beginning at age 50, and more
  frequently if an immediate family member has had colon cancer.</P>
  <P>Up to age 50, heart disease is, by far, the deadliest killer among men.
  Once past this age, however, the additional risks of cancer &shy; especially
  prostate cancer &shy; become much more evident.</P>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><IMG SRC="jrnparts.html/heman.gif" WIDTH="300"
  HEIGHT="207" ALIGN="RIGHT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" BORDER="4"></FONT><IMG SRC=
  "jrnparts.html/spacer.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="224" ALIGN="RIGHT" NATURALSIZEFLAG=
  "0">Colon cancer also poses a significant threat, because, Basaldua says,
  &quot;before you have symptoms, it can get pretty advanced. If a tumor
  is growing in the colon, it can expand quite a bit with no symptoms. That's
  why getting tested regularly is so important.&quot;</P>
  <P>In most cases, he says, a one- or two-month delay in seeking treatment,
  whether it be for actual symptoms or simply for a general check up, is
  not going to make a big difference. It's when those few months stretch
  into years; then, it can be serious.</P>
  <P>&quot;It's easy to remember an anniversary that's based on a calendar
  year,&quot; he says. &quot;A lot of men choose some important date, like
  a birthday or a wedding anniversary, to help them know when it's time to
  do a physical again.&quot;</P>
  <H4><FONT COLOR="#CC3300">Sage Advice</FONT></H4>
  <P>&quot;In a nutshell, the earlier you detect something, the better chance
  you have of correcting it and being treated successfully,&quot; sums up
  Nerz. &quot;By seeing the doctor regularly, your chances of survival &shy;
  if something is found &shy; are so much better.</P>
  <P>Ideal patient Russo adds some healthy advice of his own for those males
  in their 40s and 50s who are reluctant to see a doctor:</P>
  <P>&quot;Don't be crazy. The idea of catching something early &shy; before
  it spreads throughout your body &shy; is so important. You've got to catch
  it early.&quot;</P>

  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <H2 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#006600">Heart Disease: Man's Worst Friend</FONT></H2>
    <P>No disease strikes more men in their 40s and 50s than heart disease.
    Unfortunately, thousands of deaths chalked up to heart disease each year
    could be prevented if men took their health more seriously.</P>
    <P>&quot;If it's heart disease and they die in their 40s, I'd say that
    most of the cases &shy; 80 to 90 percent &shy; would have been treatable,&quot;
    says Martin Basaldua, MD, Medical Director of Methodist Medical Group.</P>
    <P>&quot;We could have extended their lives had they only come in for their
    physicals, stopped smoking, exercised, etc.,&quot; he says. &quot;It's
    amazing how many people I see who have their first heart attack in their
    40s. You would think in a relatively healthy society like ours, that this
    would be uncommon. But we see it a lot.&quot;</P>
    <P>Basaldua says many men come in with chest pains that turn out not to
    be heart disease.</P>
    <P>&quot;The safest practice, though, is to see your doctor if you experience
    chest pain,&quot; he says. &quot;If you ignore the warning signs, you might
    very well have a heart attack.&quot;</P>

  <P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>I</FONT></B>f you're like most people you look forward
  to living a long, happy and hopefully, prosperous life. But what would
  you do if a terminal or chronic illness appeared unexpectedly to claim
  you or a family member?</P>
  <P>Suffer through the crisis and be thankful that your health insurance
  or government benefits covered the financial aspects, right? Well, wrong,
  as a matter of fact. The frightening fact is that most people &shy; even
  those with &quot;good&quot; insurance or government benefits such as Medicare
  &shy; will have to ante up financially if such a tragedy strikes, according
  to experts. And they're not just talking about the 10 or 20 percent of
  the costs insurance doesn't cover. Translated, this means that to ensure
  you and your family are taken care of in the event of serious illness,
  part of your family savings plan should include funds for unforeseen health
  care costs, no matter what your age.</P>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><IMG SRC="jrnparts.html/treenew.gif" WIDTH="250"

  "0">&quot;Most people hold the mistaken belief that, since they have insurance
  or Medicare, if something were to happen to them everything would be taken
  care of,&quot; says Carolyn Gay, manager of Accounts Receivable Management
  at The Methodist Hospital. &quot;In reality, though, there are many costs,
  particularly when it comes to terminal illnesses, that aren't covered.
  For example, while Medicare will pay for medications administered during
  hospitalization, once patients are discharged they alone are responsible
  for covering the cost of all prescribed medications. Likewise, Medicaid
  pays for just three prescriptions per month. If you have a terminal illness
  or chronic condition, it is very likely that you could be prescribed more
  than this amount.&quot;</P>
  <P>And medicine is expensive. For example, someone with a single condition
  such as high blood pressure could spend as much as $500 per month on prescriptions.
  Someone with a terminal illness, however, could easily see monthly medication
  bills escalate to $1,000 or more, according to Gay.</P>
  <P>And those costs are only the tip of the iceberg, Gay says.</P>
  <P>&quot;When someone is diagnosed with a terminal illness, although in-hospital
  care may be covered, most patients' insurance companies and Medicare won't
  pay for long-term, non-skilled home health care. So, often families are
  left to serve as full-time care givers,&quot; Gay says. &quot;This can
  put the entire household in a financial bind, since someone must often
  either quit his job or take an unpaid leave of absence to provide this
  necessary round-the-clock care.&quot;</P>
  <P>Gay adds that coverage for in-hospital care is limited, too. Insurance
  companies and Medicare usually pay in full for in-hospital care, to a point
  &shy; at which time coverage can be exhausted. For example, Medicare provides
  100 percent coverage for the first 60 days of hospitalization, upon satisfying
  a $736 deductible. After that, the patient is responsible for approximately
  $184 per day for the next 30 days, and $368 per day for the next 60 days.
  Past 150 days hospitalization is no longer covered unless the patient has
  been out of the hospital for a full 60 days &shy; often a difficult requirement
  for someone struggling with a terminal illness.</P>
  <P>&quot;At this point, Medicare benefits are considered exhausted, and
  if the patient must be hospitalized, he is responsible for his own hospital
  costs. Keep in mind that to get this far, he's already paid approximately
  $28,000 out of his own pocket,&quot; Gay said. &quot;And, even if he is
  able to stay out of the hospital and be treated on an outpatient basis,
  Medicare reimburses only 80 percent for outpatient treatments, leaving
  the patient responsible for the remaining 20 percent.&quot;</P>
  <P>Gay adds that, in light of this, it is imperative for everyone to purchase
  Medicare supplemental insurance policies to help with the expenses that
  are not covered by Medicare.</P>
  <P>Margie Thompson, supervisor of social services at the Visiting Nurse
  Association's Hospice, has the unpleasant task of seeing first-hand the
  problems for those who neglected to save.</P>
  <P>&quot;By the time some families come to us, not only are they in a state
  of emotional turmoil as they face the prospect of losing someone they love,
  but their grief is also compounded by worries of how they'll be able to
  pay for the costs associated with illness and death. This includes paying
  for necessary health care as well as funeral costs,&quot; Thompson said.</P>
  <P>&quot;When families come to us we do an initial psycho-social assessment
  that also involves determining their financial situations,&quot; she continues.
  &quot;We then refer them, if necessary, to government agencies and charitable
  organizations that may help them meet some of these costs &shy; but, unfortunately,
  these usually don't even come close to covering the bills.&quot;</P>
  <P>Thompson says that the best thing everyone can do for their families
  is to avoid altogether putting them in this quandary &shy; by saving for
  such an eventuality, no matter how unpleasant it may seem. She also recommends
  that people first and foremost create a will and then sit down with their
  families to make their wishes explicitly known in terms of how they would
  like to be cared for in case they become ill. &quot;Even talking about
  what kind of funeral you would like can help immensely,&quot; Thompson
  says. &quot;When people are grieving and don't know what the dying person's
  wishes are, they often feel obligated to overspend on something like a
  funeral, even if their loved one probably wouldn't have wanted that. We
  have a fear in our society that talking about death somehow makes it come
  true. The reality is that addressing the topic is healthy. And, although
  it's uncomfortable, you will be helping your family emotionally in the
  long run by allowing them to deal with their grief without the added burden
  of financial stress.&quot;</P>
  <P>Mary Margolis, a certified public accountant and financial planner with
  Stavis, Margolis &amp; Associates in Houston, agrees. She advocates an
  aggressive putting-your-ducks-in-a-row approach to planning for the possibility
  of a terminal or chronic illness, so that families aren't bankrupted if
  it does occur. Her basic advice is the same as Thompson's and Gay's &shy;
  save, save, save.</P>
  <P>&quot;People should begin now putting the maximum amount in their 401(k)
  accounts or Individual Retirement Accounts if they have them, as well as
  setting aside at least six months of living expenses in case they become
  disabled or can't work,&quot; Margolis says. &quot;I also advise people
  to purchase disability insurance and to save money above and beyond their
  retirement savings to pay for medical bills and medications not covered
  by private insurance or Medicare.&quot;</P>
  <P>As Thompson pointed out, Margolis also feels that a will is an absolute
  necessity.</P>
  <P>&quot;Everyone, young or old, should have a will. But it's not just
  enough to have one, you must be sure that you have someone who knows how
  to handle planning and implementation,&quot; Margolis says. &quot;An estate
  attorney can draw up the will, but a certified financial planner with special
  training in estate planning should implement it; their more extensive experience
  in doing this helps them foresee and avoid pitfalls.&quot;</P>
  <P>Finally, in planning for the unforseeable future, Margolis says she
  advocates a team approach, if possible. Individuals should select a team
  of advisors, she says, including an attorney specializing in estate planning,
  a certified public accountant and a certified financial planner with special
  training in estate planning to act as the captain&quot; of the team.</P>
  <P>&quot;Even if you haven't been diagnosed with an illness, it's a good
  idea to have a team like this ready to implement a plan in case it does
  happen,&quot; Margolis says. &quot;After all, the facts of life are that
  none of us really knows what will happen down the line.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>

  <P><IMG SRC="jrnparts.html/hmoart.gif" WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="315" ALIGN=
  "RIGHT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><FONT SIZE=+2>W</FONT>e seniors were pretty
  tough as kids, weren't we? We went to the doctor or dentist only when we
  couldn't cure what was ailing us with home remedies. An arm njured in a
  fall from a tree didn't qualify for a doctor visit unless it was clearly
  broken. A tooth-ache? Dab on some oil of cloves and ignore the tooth until
  it hurt so much it had to be pulled. And a regular medical checkup? Phooey!
  That was only for &quot;sick people,&quot; not us. If our aches and pains
  didn't keep us from shooting basketballs or racing our bikes, we left the
  doctors and dentists alone. Especially since we could buy a brand new Daisy
  BB gun for not much more than the cost of several visits to the doctor.
  We were unaware that the prevailing ethic had forced us into a &quot;no-choice
  health plan.&quot;</P>
  <P>The &quot;plan&quot; was for us to bear the entire burden for keeping
  ourselves in good health so doctors could focus their efforts on removing
  a ruptured appendix or other &quot;individual episodes of acute care intervention,&quot;
  as described by M. James Henderson, chief executive officer of MethodistCare,
  the newly formed managed care organization of Methodist Health Care System.</P>
  <P>Henderson continues: &quot;Now the focus is moving toward maintaining
  the overall day-to-day health of the people. If we're getting a little
  sick, we treat the problem immediately; we don't wait until we need an
  operation.&quot;</P>
  <P>That means we seniors can now get help to manage our health rather than
  simply wait for serious illness to strike. We can join health maintenance
  organizations (HMOs) or continue our traditional fee-for-service system.
  But we can't avoid making a choice for long because Medicare is drowning
  rapidly in its own red ink. (Please see related article <I>Taking Issue</I>)</P>
  <P>How does it feel to make that decision? Many of us find it as scary
  as going to the doctor to get that broken tree-climbing arm set and put
  in a cast. &quot;Can I trust this doctor?&quot; &shy; the question of our
  childhood &shy; echoes in our senior years as &quot;Can I trust this HMO?&quot;</P>
  <P>But that mindset ignores the medical community's recent paradigm shift:
  from rescuing patients to managing their health. Does this new approach
  work? Statistics indicate it does.</P>
  <P>HMO members receive equal quality treatment at lower cost compared to
  traditional fee-for-service medical practices. That's the conclusion of
  Best's Review after a seven-year study of HMOs that tracked 1,720 patients
  in three cities. Did Best's only follow the healthier HMO members, though?
  No. People suffering from high blood pressure and diabetes fared just as
  well in HMOs as in traditional medical practices.</P>
  <P>But, really, are Medicare HMOs for all of us, or only for those who
  can still swim like Johnny Weissmuller or Esther Williams?</P>
  <P>A qualified &quot;yes&quot; to both questions. That's why HMO members
  have grown from 6 million in 1976 to 53.3 million in 1995. A recent study
  reported in Newsweek projects that 103.2 million people will join HMOs
  by the year 2000. The huge number of HMO members forms such an enormous
  actuarial pool that the relatively few seriously ill seniors don't drag
  down HMO services or drive up costs for healthier members.</P>
  <P>Our &quot;yes&quot; is qualified for other reasons, too. First, remember
  this is a fairly new, growing business and may not yet be available in
  every part of the country. At last count, accredited Medicare HMOs operate
  in only 35 states. Second, some seniors retired with generous fee-for-service
  medical plans that supplement Medicare and pay for important benefits otherwise
  provided only by HMOs. Pundits predict an end to these generous benefits
  as former employers and Congress strive to contain costs. When coverage
  changes, these seniors must either buy so-called &quot;Medigap&quot; policies
  to cover lost benefits or join Medicare HMOs.</P>
  <P>So, all of us need to learn how to conduct the research to become savvy
  shoppers for quality HMOs. First, keep in mind that just as there are differences
  among doctors, so there are differences among HMOs. And dissatisfied members
  seldom hesitate to vote with their feet by switching to HMOs that better
  suit their needs. As membership shrinks, superior competitors quickly weed
  out those less responsive HMOs.</P>
  <P>But how can we find the better-rated HMOs in the first place? A good
  starting point is the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA),
  a nonprofit group in Washington, DC, that conducts accreditation reviews
  of HMOs. To measure the quality of health care at an HMO, trained professionals
  ask many of the same questions we might ask. Call NCQA at (202) 955-3515
  for information to help start your own screening of HMO candidates. NCQA
  can tell you which Medicare HMOs operate in your area and report on their
  accreditation status. The Committee has tough quality requirements: it
  has denied accreditation to 12 percent of HMOs in the United States.</P>
  <P>As of 1995, some 20 percent of the estimated 350,000 Medicare-qualified
  people in the Houston area have joined the 12 HMO plans available here.
  Enrollees doubled in 1994, which indicates strong word-of-mouth endorsement.
  Eileen Brown, head of OASIS, a seniors education program, agrees.</P>
  <P>&quot;Seniors that join HMOs like them, but others resist change because
  they don't know enough about how HMOs really work,&quot; Brown says. They
  tend to get over that hurdle when friends or neighbors receive notices
  from their former employers announcing changes in medical insurance programs.
  Once they join an HMO, they find they like the extra benefits &shy; like
  low-cost prescriptions and free medical screenings &shy; that come with
  it and urge their friends to look into joining, too.&quot;</P>
  <P>OK, now we're armed with data from NCQA, comments of friends and your
  current fee-for-service medical insurance plan for comparison purposes.
  The serious search &shy; a direct questioning of the Medicare HMOs in your
  area &shy; can begin. Here are just a few questions seniors might ask:</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>* &quot;How exactly will you help me maintain my good health?&quot;
    (In addition to frequent checkups and monitoring of medication, many HMOs
    also conduct classes on exercise and nutrition.)</P>
    <P>* &quot;Just how much can you save me over my current medical insurance
    plan?&quot; (HMOs should be able to itemize the reduced cost of prescriptions
    and lower out-of-pocket costs for doctor and hospital visits, routine checkups,
    immunizations, dental care, eyeglasses and hearing aids.)</P>
    <P>* &quot;Can I choose my own primary care physician (PCP) based on his
    or her qualifications?&quot; (Enlightened HMOs are encouraging patients
    to do just that, even setting up personal interviews to make sure the doctor-patient
    &quot;chemistry&quot; is right.)</P>
    <P>* &quot;How can I be sure the PCP will refer me to the right specialist
    if I need one?&quot; (HMOs can quickly put to rest the old &quot;restriction
    of choice&quot; bugaboo with specific data on the results of their referral
    procedures.)</P>
    <P>* &quot;Will you cover my medical expenses if I get sick while visiting
    my family out of state?&quot; (Many HMOs are beginning to establish reciprocal
    agreements with HMOs in popular vacation states to provide uninterrupted
    routine care.)</P>
    <P>* &quot;Just how satisfied are members of your HMO with your services?&quot;
    (HMOs hire outside firms to survey patient satisfaction and can provide
    recent results.)</P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Sure, there are lots of other questions we might ask an HMO administrator
  before joining, and remember, we can always switch to another provider
  if our first choice doesn't work. Just keep in mind one important point:
  HMOs have a vested interest in keeping us healthy, not just treating us
  when we get sick. And that's what we all want. So do your part to be healthy
  &shy; avoid climbing any more weak-limbed trees &shy; and do take advantage
  of the new options modern health care offers.</P>

  thought it was a good place to put our money.&quot; So says Lloyd J. Gregory
  Jr., MD, Executive Vice President and Medical Advisor of the John S. Dunn
  Research Foundation, when talking about The Methodist Hospital. But those
  few words don't convey the magnitude of the Dunn Foundation's gifts to
  Methodist &shy; millions of dollars since the mid-1980s &shy; that both
  organizations regard as extremely important for the future of medical research
  and education.</P>
  <P>According to Gregory, one major reason the Foundation considers the
  hospital such a good investment is that &quot;Methodist has probably one
  of the best all-inclusive, multi-specialty medical staffs in the city of
  Houston.&quot;</P>
  <P>That's high praise from a man whose own career as a general internist
  spanned decades and encompassed enough &quot;Chief of Service&quot; and
  &quot;Medical Director&quot; appointments to satisfy several dedicated,
  ambitious doctors.</P>
  <P>Gregory and the Dunn Foundation's trustees know what good doctors and
  researchers can accomplish if given the means to pursue their educational
  and research goals. For that reason, the Foundation has endowed two research
  chairs and one education chair &shy; all bearing John S. Dunn Sr.'s name
  &shy; at The Methodist Hospital and Baylor College of Medicine.</P>
  <P>The Dunn Research Chair in Cardiology is held by William L. Winters,
  MD, whom Gregory describes as a &quot;pioneer in echocardiography.&quot;
  The funding provides Winters with, among other things, personnel and supplies
  for echocardiography research that compares the hearts of people who've
  had heart attacks to those of people who haven't, to determine whether
  the attacks cause scarring to the heart muscle. He is also conducting a
  study of &quot;dizzy spells&quot; brought on by arrhythmia in elderly people,
  in which subjects are outfitted with devices that record such incidents
  when they happen and transmit the information directly to Winters' office
  via facsimile. This research could help discover what causes the potentially
  dangerous episodes and how they can be avoided.</P>
  <P>Winters says that the Dunn funds are especially important right now,
  because government grants for medical research are drying up.</P>
  <P>&quot;None of my current research and education projects were under
  way before the Dunn chair,&quot; says Winters. &quot;Since it's come along,
  our activities have grown each year.&quot;</P>
  <P>Another Methodist-Baylor chair endowed by the Dunn Foundation is allowing
  chairholder Philip C. Noble, PhD, the opportunity to, very simply, &quot;advance
  knowledge of orthopedics.</P>
  <P>&quot;My mission,&quot; Noble says, &quot;is to devise a way for applied
  and background research to come to bear on each subspecialty of orthopedics.&quot;</P>
  <P>Through a number of projects, Noble has applied advances in computing
  and engineering technology to measure the effects of orthopedic procedures
  on the way that human joints function. The research, he says, &quot;provides
  surgeons with a way to gauge the technical success of their procedures
  so that new methods may be developed to bring even better results to our
  patients.</P>
  <P>&quot;Without the endowment,&quot; he says, &quot;my efforts would not
  be as effective nor as focused. There would always be the distraction of
  looking for the extramural funds. With the support of the Dunn Foundation,
  I now have room to focus on core areas of research that can significantly
  impact patient care.&quot;</P>
  <P>The newest chair &shy; in General Internal Medicine &shy; was endowed
  just this year and is held by general internist Clifford C. Dacso, MD.
  The Dunn Foundation hopes the chair will increase the size and status of
  Methodist's general internal medicine service.</P>
  <P>&quot;We've got to have more internists who are primary care doctors,&quot;
  exhorts Gregory. &quot;Everyone needs a good primary care doctor, but they're
  hard to find nowadays.&quot;</P>
  <P>Dacso and Gregory both describe general medicine as an immensely rewarding
  career that allows physicians to form lifelong bonds with individuals and
  families as they oversee their care. The Dunn Chair, by funding post-graduate
  education in general internal medicine, will enable Dacso to promote the
  field as one that provides a great deal of personal and professional satisfaction.</P>
  <P>&quot;The Dunn Foundation and The Methodist Hospital wanted to make
  a statement about their commitment to the principles of general internal
  medicine,&quot; says Dacso. &quot;We want students and residents to understand
  the concepts of general practice and recognize that it's a great way to
  make a living. You can have a lot of fun doing it.&quot;</P>
  <P>Dacso is quick to point out that Methodist already has an excellent
  staff of internists, but he says that the educational funds provided by
  the Dunn Chair will allow Methodist and Baylor to increase their base of
  general internists.</P>
  <P>&quot;It will increase our effectiveness in attracting high-quality
  faculty, and high-quality faculty in general medicine are high-quality
  physicians,&quot; he emphasizes. &quot;That's what our faculty does. We
  don't work in a lab and we don't do cloning and we don't do gene transfer.
  We take care of folks.&quot;</P>
  <P>Training medical school graduates to &quot;take care of folks&quot;
  is an expensive prospect, especially since there are no guaranteed funds
  for graduate medical education. Undergraduate medical education is supported
  with tuition and some state monies, but the instruction of medical residents
  is tied to a Medicare-based funding program that doesn't cover the full
  costs of education.</P>
  <P>&quot;These endowed chairs and philanthropy, in general, are absolutely
  critical to medical education,&quot; Dacso says. Because of that, he regards
  his role as chairholder with great earnestness.</P>
  <P>&quot;The Dunn name has been very influential in medical care in this
  city,&quot; he says. &quot;I consider this to be not only an honor, but
  an obligation as well. I take that obligation very seriously.&quot;</P>
  <P>As a primary care physician, Dacso takes his relationships with patients
  just as seriously, and hopes to instill the same attitude in future doctors.</P>
  <P>&quot;It's really important to teach medical students that you've got
  to work hard to maintain a personal relationship with your patients,&quot;
  he says. &quot;Without that relationship, you're performing a technical
  service.&quot;</P>
  <P>With the help of the Dunn chairs, Dacso will be developing more primary
  care doctors &shy; not technicians &shy; while Winters and Noble work to
  advance understanding and treatment of cardiologic and orthopedic problems.</P>
  <P>And while the three men are direct recipients of the Dunn Foundation's
  generosity, the ultimate beneficiaries are patients, who will have greater
  access to proficient, compassionate doctors and improved medical care.</P>
  <H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#663399">One Man's Commitment, The Community's
  Health. </FONT></H3>
  <P>One person and a single decision can have an amazing impact. The late
  John S. Dunn Sr. surely knew this, for his legacy &shy; the John S. Dunn
  Research Foundation &shy; exemplifies the immeasurable good and countless
  lives touched by one person committed to a single decision.</P>
  <P>In 1977, Dunn established the Foundation &quot;to support organizations
  and programs engaged in biomedical educational and research activities
  that serve the people of Texas.&quot; But the official explanation of the
  Dunn Foundation's activities doesn't begin to describe its effect on health
  care in Houston. That's better left to Lloyd J. Gregory Jr., MD, Executive
  Vice President and Medical Advisor of the Foundation.</P>
  <P>&quot;We're a research foundation first and foremost,&quot; says Gregory.
  &quot;We're consciously trying to increase the number of good research
  people in various specialties and also turn out good doctors.&quot;</P>
  <P>That conscious effort is manifested through millions of dollars contributed
  to more than 100 programs at 55 institutions ranging from large teaching
  institutions researching heart disease and cancer in the Texas Medical
  Center to small neighborhood clinics serving uninsured and indigent patients.</P>
  <P>The Methodist Hospital is among those fortunate institutions, and has,
  in fact, received the Foundation's largest single endowment. (To honor
  the man whose decision made such generosity possible, Methodist's Dunn
  Tower is named for John S. Dunn Sr.)</P>
  <P>Since that first endowment to Methodist, the Dunn Foundation has continued
  to help fund research and education projects at the hospital. And while
  those projects represent the work of many people, their accomplishments
  can be attributed largely to one person, John S. Dunn Sr., and his decision
  to leave a legacy that will continue to strengthen the work of physicians
  and researchers for years to come.</P>

Welcome to Frequently Asked Questions About Health.  We're working to make this page an extensive resource of basic medical information with lots of handy links to related, in-depth articles.  <p>

If you have a medical question that is not yet covered on this page, please e-mail it to us at <i><a href=mailto:SBarnes@riskmgmt.tmh.tmc.edu>Webmaster@methodist.com</a></i>.  But please remember that this information is provided only to help promote a better understanding of health issues.  If you have a concern about your health, please consult your physician. <p> 

Be sure to check back with us periodically.  We'll be adding more Q&As all the time! <p>



<b>Q.  Is it safe to donate blood? <p></b>
<ul>

A.  One of the cornerstones of any community's medical services is the availability of an adequate volunteer blood supply.  This is important because a back-up of replacement blood must be kept on hand for a wide variety of surgical procedures.  Although many people do not receive blood during surgery, it has to be there in case of need. 

If you are currently a blood donor, or have been one in the past, you know that you cannot get AIDS or any other disease by giving blood, and the reason for this is simple:  in order to contract AIDS, there must be a transfer of blood or other body fluid from an infected person into the blood stream of another person.  This exchange is not possible in the blood donation process, because all of the supplies are sterile and disposable, used only once and then disposed of properly. <p>

</ul><b>
Q.  What is magnetic resonance imaging? <p></b>
<ul>
A.  Magnetic Resonance Imaging, or M.R.I., uses large, powerful electromagnets and radio frequency waves to produce computerized visual images of the human body, with nearly the photographic detail of medical textbooks.  The M.R.I. does not use X-Rays in the production of images, and there is not radiation hazard. 

Unlike X-Rays and computer tomography, or C.T. scans, M.R.I. can pinpoint lesions of the brain, spinal cord and all organs without requiring the injection of contrast materials or dye. 

And, since the M.R.I.'s visual image is the computerized reaction to radio frequency signals, the patient need not be moved during the procedure.  A computer can direct the signals to any desired location.  This aids in the handling and diagnosis of trauma or very ill patients.

This imaging system has tremendous immediate medical application, and long-ranging potential in the study of body chemistry and the understanding of disease, as it can actually detect chemical changes produced by disease within cells, even before symptoms are apparent.
<p>
</ul><b>
Q.  How should I deal with menopause? <p></b>
<ul>
Menopause is the time in a woman's life when ovulation and menstrual periods normally end, usually around age 50.

Whether or not a woman experiences any unpleasant symptoms of menopause, she should continue to have a gynecological exam once a year.  Based on the patient's medical history, the doctor may prescribe hormones. 

Hormone supplementation is commonly called "Estrogen Replacement Therapy", even though hormones other than estrogen may be used. 

Estrogen replacement therapy is used to treat several problems, such as hot flashes and vaginal irritation.  It is one of several methods used to slow down the loss of bone that results from osteoporosis, and it has recently been shown to have a possible effect on the development of cataracts and heart disease. 

Not every woman can take hormones.  If you have had breast cancer or another type of cancer involving reproductive organs, if you think that you might be pregnant, or if you have a blood clotting disorder, talk with your gynecologist about the other ways to deal with symptoms of menopause. 

You can make the best of the rest of your life by taking good care of yourself during this change. <p>
</ul><b>
Q.  How can I find a primary care physician? <p></b>
<ul>
Physicians in the medical specialties of general or family practice, internal medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, and pediatrics are traditionally considered to be providers of primary care.

Establishing a relationship with a primary care physician is extremely important for continuity of your health care, but how do you find one that's right for you? 

The old tried-and-true method of asking a friend or a neighbor to recommend a physician is still a favorite, and it still works. 

Or, if you or a family member have ever visited a local medical specialist, such as a dermatologist, psychiatrist or surgeon, call that doctor - he or she should be happy to give you the names of two or three good primary care physicians.
A third way to find a physician is through your county's medical society.  It's a voluntary professional association whose membership includes most of the physicians in the county.  Among the many services it provides is a referral service for patients seeking a physician.
<p>
<b></ul>
Q.  How can I choose the best doctor for me? <p>
<ul></b>
A.  It's best not to wait until you're sick to find a personal physician.  You should allow enough time to collect the information you'll need to make an informed choice.

Once you have the names of a few primary care physicians, you'll want to determine the one who will best suit your needs.  One way to do this is to make a list of questions, and then call each of the doctors' offices. 

First, find out the office location and hours.  Then ask about standard fees, and find out the average waiting room time for appointments.

You may want to ask which hospitals the doctor uses, in case you should have an emergency.  And perhaps get the name of the physician who handles patient emergencies when the doctor is unavailable.

If you think that it's important to know the physician's age and credentials, by all means, ask!  This could include the medical school attended and the year graduated, membership in national scientific medical societies, and if the doctor is certified by an examining board in a medical specialty.  Although this won't tell you about a doctor's bedside manner, it may make you feel more informed when making your decision.
Choosing a physician is an important step, and one that should be treated seriously.
<p>
<b></ul>
Q.  How can I tell if I have skin cancer? <p></b>
<ul>
A.  Skin cancer is the most prevalent form of cancer in the nation, and it is curable if diagnosed early.

Basal cell carcinoma is the most common form - usually appearing as slow growing, raised pearly nodules, which if untreated may crust, ulcerate, and sometimes bleed.  They occur most often on the head, neck, hands and middle body of people middle age and older. 

This form of skin cancer can cause serious damage if allowed to invade the skin to underlying structures.

The primary cause of skin cancer is overexposure to the sun's harmful ultraviolet rays.  Prevention is as simple as protecting yourself from the sun, by using a sun block or sun screen with a high protection factor, and wearing protective clothing and a hat.  Dermatologists also recommend self-examinations for changes in the skin's appearance, especially in existing moles or blemishes. 

If you have a suspicious spot on your skin.  See your dermatologist.  When detected early, there are various options available to effectively treat - and cure - skin cancer. <p>

</ul><b>
Q.  Can insect bites be dangerous? <p></b>
<ul>
A.  For many people, the sting of a wasp, yellow jacket, hornet or bee, or a fire ant bite can result in an anaphylactic reaction - the most severe type of allergic reaction. 

Symptoms are sever and include swelling of the eyes, difficulty breathing, and a drop in blood pressure causing fainting or a feeling of faintness -- all within minutes of the sting.  Extreme cases can result in death. 

Your allergist can teach you to self-administer prescription antihistamine, and how to use a tourniquet if stung. 

Thanks to recent medical advances, there are now skin tests and antivenin treatments available which can desensitize people with this problem, and significantly lower the severity of these reactions.

If you experience anything more than localized skin swelling and burning when stung by an insect, see your allergist. <p>

Q.  What is angioplasty? <p></b>
<ul>
A.  Coronary artery disease, or CAD, is the narrowing of the arteries that feed blood to the heart.  In the past, when medications failed to treat CAD, coronary artery bypass surgery, with months of recovery, was the only treatment option available. 

Now, selected patients can be treated with angioplasty, a non-surgical technique that uses a tiny balloon to improve blood flow to the heart.  Angioplasty is done under a local anesthetic, and takes about two hours.

Once the cardiologist has diagnosed CAD, a chest X-ray will be made to locate the blockage, which is made up mostly of cholesterol. 

In angioplasty, the doctor inserts a balloon-tipped catheter through a small incision in the arm or leg, positions the tip just inside the blockage, and inflates the balloon.  This stretches and cracks the blockage, allowing blood to flow unobstructed through the artery. 

The patient can be up in a matter of hours, and home in a matter of days. 

Angioplasty can treat the symptoms of CAD, but the best way to slow its progress is to stop smoking, control high blood pressure, eat less fat and cholesterol, and exercise regularly. <p>

Q.  What is important to look for in a nursing home? <p></b>
<ul>
A.  Circumstances may allow an elderly or disabled person to live at home.  But if continuous nursing care of a demanding nature is required, many families find that a nursing home is needed. 

The person who will be moving to the nursing home should be consulted about his or her wishes, and in a medical crisis it may not be possible to make these known.  So it might be wise to investigate nursing homes before anything happens to force a quick decision. 

First, determine the type of facility needed.  A residential care facility provides meals and sheltered living with housekeeping, and some medical monitoring.  An intermediate care facility provides room and board and nursing care by registered nurses, licensed practical nurses and nurse's aides. 

Shop around.  Talk to residents, their families, health care workers, and the administrator.  Check the home's certification to see that state standards are met.  And review the charges for affordability.  Any social security office can provide information about eligibility for Medicare and Medicaid.

Q.  What's so bad about smoking cigarettes?</b>
<p><ul>
A.  In recent years, much has been said about the dangers of cigarette smoking, but have you ever wondered what tobacco smoke does to your body?

Although there are many chemicals in tobacco smoke, the three most harmful are tar, carbon monoxide, and nicotine. 
Tar is carcinogenic, which means that it is capable of producing cancer in all tissues with which it comes in contact.  It is a mixture of several substances that condense into a sticky material in the lungs.  At the same time, lung tissue called cilia, the tiny hairs that sweep out the airways, is damaged by smoke, so the sticky tar is not removed from the lungs. 

Carbon monoxide lessens the ability of red blood cells to carry oxygen through the body.  It also  encourages the accumulation of plaque in the arteries, which is a contributing factor in many heart diseases. 

Nicotine causes an increase in heart rate and heightens the effects of high blood pressure.

Why, then, do so many people continue to smoke?  Because they are truly addicted to the nicotine, which acts mainly on the nervous system.

Like the American Cancer Society says, "If you smoke cigarettes, stop.  If you don't smoke, don't start."

Q.  What are the warning signs of colorectal cancer?
<p></b><ul>
A. Each year, colorectal cancer strikes 140,000 Americans between the ages of 35 and 70.  Half are cured, but another 35,000 could be cured if they recognized the warning signs and received prompt treatment.

The most important sign of colorectal cancer is blood in the stool, which can appear either bright red or black.  Other warning signs include abdominal discomfort or pain, weight loss, fatigue, change in bowel habits, and anemia as a result of intestinal bleeding.

Risk factors for developing colorectal cancer are:  a family history of colorectal cancer or polyps; polyps in your colon; ulcerative colitis, which is a chronic disease that causes inflammation of the colon; being older than 40; and, in women, cancer of the breast or reproductive organs.

If you are at risk or have noticed any of the warning signs, you may want to see your family doctor or an internist.  Early detection is crucial to a cure.

<p></ul><b>
Q.  How is colorectal cancer treated, and is it preventable?
<p></b><ul>
A. To determine if you have colorectal cancer, your physician may perform any of several examinations.

The first is a digital exam, where the physician uses a gloved finger to check for rectal abnormalities.  Or, a rigid instrument called a proctoscope may be used to view the inside of your rectum.  The doctor will probably want to run another test to check for blood in the stool. 
A sigmoidoscope or colonoscope permits viewing of the rectum and colon.  If polyps or other abnormalities are found, they can be removed in the same procedure.  If a cancerous tumor is found, it may need to be treated surgically.

Studies have shown that the risk of colorectal cancer can be reduced with certain dietary changes.  The national cancer institute recommends that Americans consume between 20 and 30 grams of crude dietary fiber daily.  To get more fiber in your diet, eat whole-grain breads and cereals, fresh fruit, and fresh vegetables.  Also, reduce the amount of fat in your diet to no more than 30 percent of total calories.

And get regular checkups.  They can be lifesavers. <p>

</ul><b>
Q.  How can I tell if a health advertisement is legitimate? <p></b>
<ul>
A.  Medical quackery is the promotion of remedies and devices that are scientifically unproven.  Each year Americans spend roughly 10 billion dollars on such ineffective and sometimes harmful products. 

About 60 percent of all quackery victims are older people.  This is because most people who purchase the quack's worthless and often dangerous treatments are desperate for some offer of hope.  And, since older people as a group have more chronic illnesses than younger people, they are likely targets for fraud. 

Three of the largest areas for health quackery are the aging process, arthritis, and cancer. 

One way to protect yourself is to question what you see or hear in advertisements.  Be aware that ads are not necessarily true just because they are presented by what may otherwise be a reputable source. 

If you have questions about what you think may be a quack product, ask your physician, or contact the association concerned with the disease that the product claims to treat, such as the American Cancer Society or the Arthritis Foundation.
</ul>
<p><b>
Q.  Is the loss of urine control a common problem? <p>
</b><ul>
A.  Loss of urine control, or urinary incontinence, is especially common in older women, but occurs in men, too.  At least one in ten people older than 65 has a problem of this nature.

Incontinence is not an inevitable result of aging.  It is caused by specific changes in body function, from diseases or use of medications.  In many cases, incontinence can be treated and controlled, if not totally cured.

Incontinence is sometimes the first and only symptom of a urinary tract infection, and curing the illness will usually clear up the problem. 

People having problems in controlling urine should seek prompt medical attention, from a family physician or a urologist, to determine the cause of the problem and to lessen the chance of complications.  Even in cases where the problem can't be completely cured, modern products and ways of managing the condition can ease the discomfort and inconvenience it causes.

</ul><b>
Q.  Is senility a normal part of growing older? <p>
</b><ul>
A.  Senility is not a normal sign of growing old.  In fact, it is not even a disease. 

"Senility" is the word commonly used to describe a large number of conditions, many of which respond to prompt treatment. 

The two most common incurable forms of mental impairment in old age are multi-infarct dementia, which is widespread death of brain tissue caused by a series of minor strokes; and Alzheimer's disease, which may account for as much as 60 percent of mental impairment in older people.

However, there are some 100 reversible conditions which may mimic these disorders, such as head injury, high fever, poor nutrition, or drug reactions.  Emotional problems such as depression, loss of self-esteem, loneliness, anxiety and boredom can produce similar symptoms. 

The best treatment comes only after a complete medical examination by a family physician, psychiatrist, neurologist, or internist.  Whether the diagnosis is that the problem is or isn't curable, the doctor will know how to treat it or will have ready access to the best resources or specialists.
<p>
<b></ul>
Q.  Is alcohol abuse a problem among older people? <p>
</b><ul>
A.  Alcohol abuse among older men and women is a more serious problem than people generally realize.

Alcohol slows down brain activity, impairing mental alertness, judgment, physical coordination, and reaction time, and increasing the chance of falls and accidents.

Alcohol can make some medical problems difficult to diagnose.  For example, it can mask pain that would normally serve as a warning sign of heart attack.  And it can produce symptoms of dementia, such as forgetfulness and confusion, which could lead to unnecessary institutionalization.

Alcohol mixes unfavorably with many prescription and over-the-counter drugs.  When mixed with alcohol, drugs such as major and minor tranquilizers, barbiturates, pain killers, and antihistamines will lead to very rapid intoxication.

Alcohol can cause other drugs, such as anticonvulsants, anticoagulants, and anti-diabetes drugs, to be metabolized more rapidly, and produce exaggerated results.

The good news is that, with the guidance of a family doctor or psychiatrist, older problem drinkers and alcoholics have an unusually good chance for recovery.
<p><b></ul>

Q.  What is a stroke and what are the symptoms?
<p></b><ul>
A.  Most people who have strokes are older than 65, are more often men than women, have blood vessels narrowed by atherosclerosis, or plaque, and have high blood pressure.

A stroke occurs when part of the brain is damaged because its blood supply is reduced.  As a result, the physical or mental functions controlled by the injured area deteriorate.  This condition may be permanent or temporary. 

The blood flow reduction may be due to a clot, caused by plaque in a vessel; it may de due to an embolism, which is a foreign object that may become wedged and obstruct blood flow; or it may be due to a rupture in a vessel wall. 

Many times, potential stroke victims receive warnings, in the form of transient ischemic attacks, or ministrokes.  Symptoms of a ministroke are the same as those of a stroke, but they last less than 24 hours.  They may include headache, dizziness, tingling, numbness, blurred or double vision, confusion, or partial loss of the use of one side of the body. 

If you think you have experienced symptoms of a ministroke, you may want to see your family physician or a neurologist for testing immediately.
<p><b></ul>
Q.  Can strokes be prevented? <p>
</b><ul>
A.  Almost one-third of all strokes could be prevented if risk factors were recognized and heeded.

A stroke occurs when the blood supply to part of the brain is reduced.  This is usually due to atherosclerosis, or a build-up of plaque in a blood vessel.  Plaque is made up mostly of cholesterol.

The primary risk factor for stroke is cigarette smoking. 

Obesity itself is a risk factor.  Related to it are high blood pressure, diabetes, and a lack of exercise. 

A diet high in polyunsaturated fats and cholesterol will promote formation of plaque in blood vessels, which is also a primary cause of heart disease.  So, obviously, the presence of heart disease is also a risk factor for stroke.

In many cases, the tendency toward stroke appears to be hereditary.  So, if anyone in your family has suffered a stroke, of if you have any of the risk factors, you should be evaluated by a neurologist immediately. 

The doctor will run tests to determine your condition, and can help you eliminate your risk factors by modifying your lifestyle, and with the possible prescription of drug therapy. <p>

<b></ul>
Q.  Can medication be bad for you? <p>
</b><ul>
A.  As you get older, even minor disorders often need treatment, at least in part, with pills or liquid medication.  As a result, you could be taking several different drugs at one time.  This is especially true of people who are under the care of several different physicians. 

This situation can be a disaster waiting to happen.  Medications can conflict with each other in many ways.  When taken together, some drugs can increase and some will decrease the effects of other drugs.  And, when combined, some can aggravate a health condition, or cause problems such as bleeding disorders.

Regardless of which physician prescribed what, each of your physicians needs to know about all of the medications that you are currently taking.  The best way to do this is to put all of your medicines in a bag and take them with you each time you visit your doctor.  Or, you could make your doctors a list of your medications, including the dosage schedules, and give them an update at each visit.

Your doctors want to keep you in the best health possible.  You can help them to do that by keeping them informed.

Q.  How often should a man have a complete physical? <p>
</b><ul>
Recent recommendations from most medical groups agree that a healthy adult does not need a complete physical and tests every year.  Past the age of 40, a man should have a complete physical every 5 years, and past the age of 60, every 2 years.  However, an annual checkup, including a few important medical tests, is a good idea for many reasons. 

The most important reason is that several health problems can be treated if discovered soon enough.  These include hypertension, colon cancer, prostate cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and the potential for stroke. 

An annual appointment also gives you and your doctor an opportunity to get to know one another.  These visits will allow you to develop a personal relationship with a doctor who will maintain your health and will know you in case you should ever have a serious illness. 

An annual checkup for a healthy man should always include a blood pressure check, a rectal exam, a prostate exam, a test for blood in the stool, and blood tests to check for diabetes, elevated cholesterol and triglyceride levels, and decreased liver function. <p>

<p></ul><b>
Q.  What is glaucoma? <p>
</b><ul>
A.  Glaucoma is one of the most common and severe eye disorders in people over 60.  Onset can be sudden, as in acute cases, or it can be gradual, as in chronic cases.  Early treatment is vital, because this disorder can lead to blindness. 

In glaucoma, the drainage channel for the fluid inside the eyeball becomes blocked.  This causes pressure in the eye to build, affecting the function of the retina and optic nerve, which are essential to vision.

In acute cases, this blockage occurs suddenly.  Vision will become blurred, and often there will be some pain or redness in the eye.

The development of chronic glaucoma is gradual, so the early symptoms are too slight to be noticed.  But at some point in the process, a partial loss of vision will become evident.

Whether the glaucoma is acute or chronic, the treatment is basically the same.  The first phase of treatment is with drugs, administered orally or as eye drops, to bring down the pressure.  In chronic glaucoma, these will be taken daily for life and should take care of the problem.  Acute glaucoma will require the surgical formation of a new fluid drainage channel. 

Regular exams by an ophthalmologist will detect glaucoma early enough to prevent serious vision loss.
<p>
</ul><b>
Q.  What is a cataract? <p>
</b><ul>
A  Cataract is a clouding of the normally clear lens of the eye.  Cataracts can occur from eye injury or diabetes, but the most common cause is deterioration of the lens with age.

The major symptom is a change in vision, such as blurring or problems seeing in bright light.  At night, an oncoming car's lights may appear to be scattered.  There may also be double vision, causing a problem in judging foot steps.

At first, your doctor will likely recommend a change in your eye glasses, but when the cataract has developed to the point where glasses no longer help, the cataract can be dissolved and removed in one quick, almost painless surgical procedure.  This procedure uses a tiny probe and ultrasonic vibration.

In almost every case, a synthetic lens is anchored in the eye during the same surgery.  This has replaced the thick glasses that cataract patients used to require.  If needed, you can be fitted for regular prescription glasses 3 to 6 weeks after your surgery. 

If you think you may have a cataract, see your ophthalmologist. <p>

</ul><b>
Q.  Why am I having trouble seeing the newspaper? <p>
<ul></b>
A.  Do you hold the newspaper at arm's length to read it?  If so, you probably have a very common vision problem known as presbyopia, which can be easily corrected.

Presbyopia is caused by aging of the eye, so most people first notice it in their mid-40s.  It is as much a part of the aging process as getting gray hair. 

When at rest, a normal eye is focused for distance vision.  For the eye to focus on closer objects, the muscles of the eye shorten and contract the lens, a process known as "Accommodation."  But the lens of the eye hardens with age, which reduces its ability to change shape to focus on close objects. 

When you find that close objects are beginning to appear slightly blurred unless you hold them away from you, you should consult an ophthalmologist, who will prescribe glasses or contact lenses. 

If you already wear glasses for another condition, you can avoid the need for two pairs by getting bifocals.

You will need slightly stronger glasses every few years, to compensate for the decreasing power of your eyes' lenses.  This will continue until about age 65, when the power of accommodation by the eyes stabilizes. <p>

<b></ul>
Q.  Should I be concerned about prostate cancer? <p>
</b><ul>
A.  The American Cancer Society estimates that 96,000 new cases of prostate cancer will be discovered this year in the U.S., and that 27,000 men will die of the disease. 

A large part of the problem is that prostate cancer is very hard to detect.  That's because the prostate gland is small, about the size of a walnut, and is inconveniently located between the rectum and the bladder, making it difficult to reach or feel.  By the time a prostate tumor can be discovered by touch, it has usually reached an advanced stage. 

The good news is that urologists around the country are having great success detecting prostate tumor early with a new, painless, ultrasound scanning device.  The machine projects sectional views of the prostate onto a screen, much like a radar scan on a T.V. weather report.  This method has increased the accuracy of diagnosing prostate tumors to near 95 percent. 

The most common symptom of prostate enlargement is a weak urinary stream.  While this does not necessarily mean cancer, you should see a urologist to be sure.  Just as it is with all other cancers, the most important point in the treatment of prostate cancer is early diagnosis. 
</ul><b>
Q.  What is osteoarthritis? <p>
</b><ul>
A.  Osteoarthritis is a rheumatic disease that affects joints, muscles and connective tissues of the body.  

As people get older, they are more likely to develop osteoarthritis, possibly because of the buildup of damage to joints from injuries and stress over time. 

In this disease, the cartilage and other joint tissues break down, resulting in pain and difficulty moving the joints.  Normally, this does not result in inflammation, but it can if pieces of the bone and cartilage float into the joint space. 

Probably every person over age 60 has osteoarthritis, but only a few notice symptoms.  Proper treatment can help relieve the symptoms and prevent or correct serious joint problems. 

Since this is a chronic condition, people with osteoarthritis are targets of advertising offering unproven treatments or products.  These can rob unsuspecting individuals of time, money and relief. 

Proven treatment programs are developed individually by family physicians or rheumatologists.  Most will be a combination of joint protection, weight loss, exercise, heat and cold treatments and medication. <p>

</ul><b>
Q.  What is gout? <p>
</b><ul>
A.  Gout belongs to the family of arthritis diseases, which generally involve inflammation of a joint.

The villain in gout is a substance in the blood called uric acid, which is a normal waste product of most foods.

Most people with gout either produce too much uric acid, or their kidneys don't get rid of it fast enough.  This can be an inherited condition, or it can be the result of using diuretics for quick weight loss or to control high blood pressure. 

In people with gout, the uric acid changes into crystals that deposit in joints and other tissues.  An attack of gout is extremely painful, and occurs when these crystals appear in a joint.  This leads to irritation of the joint lining, causing it to become inflamed.  Repeated attacks can damage the affected joints.

From 80 to 90 percent of people with gout are men with high blood pressure, who most commonly have their first attack between age 40 and 50.  Women who have gout usually develop it after menopause.

Your family doctor, orthopedic surgeon or rheumatologist can diagnose gout and treat it with medication and diet. <p>

<b></ul>
Q.  What are the symptoms of heart disease? <p>
</b><ul>
A.  There are several symptoms that can indicate heart disease. 

One of the most common is angina, which is an uncomfortable feeling of pressure in the chest.  This can feel like a squeezing under the breast bone, or like someone is standing on your chest.  The discomfort may radiate to the neck or down one or both arms. 

Many times, angina will be brought on by exertion or anxiety, and will go away with rest, and then reappear with exertion. 

Sometimes the only symptoms of heart trouble will be recurrent nausea and sweating, perhaps with a little dizziness. 

Unfortunately, for 50 percent of all heart attack victims, the first real symptom of heart disease is a heart attack.

Severe symptoms felt just before, or even during, a heart attack can include shortness of breath, sweating, nausea or vomiting, or a feeling of impending doom. 

If you have noticed any symptoms, and if you smoke cigarettes or have a family history of heart disease, you should see your family doctor immediately. <p>

</ul><b>
Q.  Can heart attacks be prevented?
<p></b><ul>
A. More than fifty percent of all deaths in Texas are from heart disease, and the fact is that most heart attacks are preventable. 

Heart disease can be impacted at any age, by simply recognizing and controlling risk factors.

First of all, if you smoke cigarettes, stop now.  Smoking contributes to a very high percentage of heart disease. 

If you have high blood pressure, work with your doctor to get it down to a normal level with diet and exercise or with medication.

Have your family doctor check your cholesterol level and, if it is over 200, lower it with diet or medication. 

If you have diabetes, follow your doctor's orders to keep it controlled. 

If you have close relatives who have had heart attacks, you should be particularly mindful of your health.  Your doctor will want to check your blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar levels, and will probably run a stress test to see if heart disease is present. 

Remember that for half of the people with heart disease, the first symptom is a heart attack. <p>

</ul><b>
Q.  How do I know if I need a hearing aid? <p>
</b><ul>
A.  Many people have trouble hearing, but won't seek medical help.  This is unfortunate, because increasing hearing loss may be due to an easily treatable cause such as an accumulation of wax in the ear.

Wax accumulates faster as you get older, so ask your family doctor or otolaryngologist about flushing out your ears whenever you notice that your hearing seems to be impaired.

Unfortunately, there is no easy cure for the gradual impairment of hearing that occurs with age and the natural deterioration of the ear's hearing mechanisms.  An otolaryngologist can examine your ears and test your hearing to determine the source of your hearing problem.  With so many types of hearing aids available today, chances are extremely good that your particular hearing problem can be helped.

You should not hesitate to ask your physician to prescribe a hearing aid, then keep using it until you have learned to make the most of it. 

But beware!  For the sake of your hearing and your pocketbook, it is very important that you not buy a hearing aid without first consulting your physician.  There are many untrained sales people ready to sell you a hearing aid that may not help your particular problem.
<p>
</ul><b>
Q.  Is a ringing in the ears unusual? <p>
</b><ul>
A.  Nearly 36 million Americans suffer from tinnitus, which may also be referred to as ringing in the ears, or head noises.  Tinnitus may come to go, or it may be a continuous sound. 

There are many possible causes of tinnitus.  It could be something as simple as a small plug of wax, or it could be a symptom of other, more serious middle ear problems, such as infection, a hole in the eardrum, or accumulation or fluid or stiffening of the middle ear bones.  It could also be caused by allergy, blood pressure irregularities, a tumor, diabetes, thyroid problems, or head traumas. 

The most common cause of tinnitus is trouble with the hearing nerve.  Unfortunately, age itself is accompanied by a certain amount of hearing nerve impairment. 

The treatment for tinnitus will be quite different in all cases.  Therefore, it is important that you see your physician to find out the exact cause of the tinnitus, and the best treatment. 

The doctor may be able to remove the cause, and thus eliminate the noise.  Or the condition may be best treated with medicine. <p>
</ul><b>
Q.  What causes sinus attacks? <p>
</b><ul>
A.  For some people, the only function that sinuses appear to have is to make them miserable. 

Problems start when mucous membranes of the sinuses become inflamed, which is a condition known as sinusitis.

This usually starts when the viral infection of a common cold is joined by a bacterial infection.  These organisms travel easily from the nose into the sinuses. 

Symptoms of sinusitis occur several days after a cold has begun - right about the time that it should be clearing up.  The nose may become blocked and have a heavy discharge.

Depending on which sinuses are affected, a person may have a headache over one or both eyes, and one or both cheeks may hurt. 

Self-treatment involves staying in a room with a fairly constant temperature and a vaporizer to add moisture, blowing the nose gently, and inhaling the steam from a sink of hot water. 

Your family doctor or otolaryngologist may prescribe an antibiotic or decongestant tablets, nose drops or a nasal spray.  Though further treatment is usually not necessary, a minor operation with local anesthesia can create a new passageway between the nose and sinuses.

</td><td valign=top width=420><font color="#0000A0"><strong>IMAGINE A BLACK HOLE </strong></font>that follows you everywhere. It 
sucks in everything you see. It takes the faces of everyone you love. 
It robs your job, your car, and throws you into an unknown world 
of darkness. You see just enough light around the edges to tease 
your senses. Your independence, your confidence have been 
stolen. You must share all that you know, all that you do, with the 
darkness.<p>When disease or simple deterioration impairs the eye, it clouds 
more than vision. The impairment rules the lives of its victims by 
destroying their ability to see close up. They can no longer focus, so 
they cannot read and they cannot drive. </p>
<p>Macular degeneration is a group of diseases that destroy the eye's 
macula, a part of the retina that we use to see details -- a stream of 
hot coffee pouring into a cup, words in a newspaper, brake lights 
on the car ahead, the face of a grandchild. </p>
<p>Age-related macular degeneration is the most common eye disease 
and a main cause of vision loss in adults over 50, followed only by 
glaucoma and cataracts. Medical advances have given doctors the 
ability to diagnose and treat those diseases early so that devastating 
effects to the patient can be reduced or eliminated. At The 
Methodist Hospital, progress in research and treatment brightens 
the future and promises to hold off the darkness.<br>
</p>
<p align=center><a name="Macular Degeneration"><em><strong><u>Macular Degeneration</u></strong></em></a> </p>
<p>The retina lines the back of the eye. The macula, which we need to 
see detail, makes up only 5 percent of the retina. The remaining 95 
percent of the retina is used for peripheral vision. </p>
<p>Macular degeneration normally starts when spots, or &quot;drusen,&quot; 
appear on the retina. A patient in his 20s or 30s may be diagnosed 
with macular degeneration when an ophthalmologist detects drusen, 
but the disease may not be devastating until age 50 or 60. </p>
<p>Macular degeneration occurs in two forms -- wet and dry. &quot;In the 
dry form, cells in the back of the eye -- the cells that do the seeing 
-- just stop functioning, atrophy, and die,&quot; says Michael Lambert, 
MD, a vitreo retinal surgeon at The Methodist Hospital. </p>
<p>The wet form of the disease goes a bit farther. Scar tissue and new 
vessels grow under the central part of the retina. As vessels bleed 
and fluid leaks, cells malfunction and scar tissue then destroys the 
functioning of the macula. </p>
<p>While doctors believe macular degeneration is hereditary, it's not a 
direct genetic link. </p>
<p>&quot;Every child of a parent with macular degeneration is not going to 
get macular degeneration,&quot; Lambert says. &quot;We think it's an inherited 
predisposition and that other factors come into play&quot; </p>
<p>Lambert has helped to pioneer a new surgery that restores vision in 
some patients with diseases of the retina. The procedure, called 
subfoveal neovascularsurgery, removes the vision-blocking 
membranes that have formed under the macula. </p>
<p>&quot;In patients with the same membrane, but with diseases other than 
macular degeneration, we've taken them from count-fingers vision 
(where you can only see your fingers in front of you) back to 
20/20,&quot; Lambert says. &quot;It's been very helpful for them.&quot; </p>
<p>Lambert believes one answer to the problems of age-related 
macular degeneration may lie in clues provided by two other retinal 
diseases. </p>
<p>In both diseases, vision-blocking membranes grow on the retina in 
the same way as in macular degeneration. One type is caused by 
unknown disease. The other, a fungus infection called 
histoplasmosis, affects mainly residents of the Mississippi and Ohio 
River valleys. </p>
<p>&quot;In macular degeneration, the whole back of the eye is sick. With 
these other two diseases, new membranes grow from a single focal 
point,&quot; Lambert says. &quot;Healthy tissue surrounds this point, which 
enables us to remove just the small part with the scar.&quot; </p>
<p>The surgery currently isn't as successful for macular degeneration 
cases, Lambert says, because the disease encompasses more of the 
eye. &quot;That patient wouldn't have as much working material to 
function again,&quot; Lambert explains. </p>
<p>Half of Lambert's macular degeneration patients who had subfoveal 
neovascular surgery did experience some improvement. &quot;But it's not 
to the level that we had hoped at this point,&quot; he adds. So he 
continues to seek new ways to stimulate the badly damaged 
photoreceptors to start working again. </p>
<p align=center><a name="Glaucoma"><font size=4><em><strong><u>Glaucoma</u></strong></em></font></a> </p>
<p>The second most common cause of blindness in the United States is 
glaucoma, occurring in 1 to 2 percent of the over- 40 population 
and reaching 10 percent of those 85 and older. </p>
<p>Glaucoma is a painless disease that has the opposite effect of 
macular degeneration. Instead of seeing a black hole with peripheral 
light, glaucoma sufferers see their world through a tunnel 
surrounded by darkness. Without treatment, that tunnel becomes 
progressively smaller. </p>
<p>The most common form of glaucoma is open-angle glaucoma, in 
which the fluid circulating in the eye drains improperly. The fluid, or 
aqueous humor, normally fills the space between the back of the 
cornea and the front of the iris and supplies nutrients that include 
vitamin C. </p>
<p>The fluid helps the cornea maintain its proper curve, and also 
removes waste products by draining through a circular channel 
called the Canal of Schlemm. </p>
<p>In a healthy eye, this flow maintains constant pressure over time. In 
a glaucoma-diseased eye, a blockage of the drainage system 
creates pressure. Eventually the pressure builds, damaging the optic 
nerve and causing total blindness. </p>
<p>Other forms of glaucoma include: </p>
<p>~ <b>acute closed-angle glaucoma: </b>a sudden buildup of pressure. 
This causes severe pain that can cause total blindness within a few 
days; </p>
<p>~ <b>congenital glaucoma: </b>a blockage or malformation of the eye 
that appears at birth or in the first year of life; and </p>
<p>~ <b>secondary glaucoma: </b>resulting from another disease, injury, 
tumor, cataract, or from taking steroids.</p>
<p>There is no way to restore vision after any type of glaucoma. Eye 
drops used several times a day to maintain pressure are the most 
common treatment, according to Methodist Ophthalmologist 
Ronald Gross. </p>
<p>&quot;The medications work by either slowing down the fluid output or 
assisting in drainage,&quot; Gross says. &quot;If the medications fail, we can 
lower the pressure with laser or conventional surgery.&quot; </p>
<p>Early detection will prevent severe visual impairment. &quot;To minimize 
damage from glaucoma, it is important to treat the disease at an 
early stage,&quot; Gross says. </p>
<p>Because there is normally no pain with glaucoma, it is important to 
have an ophthalmologist check eye pressure occasionally before the 
age of 35 and annually after age 40.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align=center><a name="Cataracts"><font size=4><em><strong><u>Cataracts</u></strong></em></font></a> </p>
<p>With cataracts, the eye's normally crystal-clear lens clouds in part 
or whole. Vision becomes blurry, hazy, or frosty, creating the sense 
of constantly peering through a window wet with condensation. </p>
<p>The lens is located behind the cornea and iris, near the front of the 
eye. Controlled by the brain, the lens helps to focus light rays from 
the viewed object onto the retina. The image is then instantaneously 
sent along the optic nerve to the brain. When the lens is clouded, 
the brain receives a distorted image. </p>
<p>There are four major types of cataracts: </p>
<p>~ <b>congenital: </b>present at birth; </p>
<p>~ <b>traumatic: </b>caused by injury; </p>
<p>~ <b>secondary: </b>caused by a systemic disease or medications; and </p>
<p>~ <b>age-related: </b>caused by a breakdown of the molecular structure 
of the protein in the lens. </p>
<p>Regardless of the type of cataract, symptoms are the same. And 
although doctors do not really know why cataracts form, they have 
some evidence that a vitamin-deficient diet or a significant amount 
of exposure to ultraviolet radiation are high risk factors for 
age-related cataracts. </p>
<p>Age-related cataracts are most common in aging eyes, occurring in 
30 to 50 percent of people over age 65. As baby boomers age and 
life expectancy rises, so will incidences of cataracts. For now, the 
number of cataract surgeries has leveled off at 1.2 million a year in 
the United States. And surgical removal is the only known effective 
treatment for cataracts<b>,</b> says Methodist Ophthalmologist Douglas 
Koch. </p>
<p>Koch is aware of the negative press ophthalmologists have received 
for allegedly overusing cataract surgery. But he emphasizes that 
surgery is the patient's decision, and there are no medications to 
dissolve cataracts. </p>
<p>&quot;I rely heavily on my patient's own concerns and needs in 
determining the timing of cataract surgery,&quot; he says. </p>
<p>Koch uses a small needle to direct ultrasonic waves that break the 
cataract into fragments. He then gently suctions them from the eye, 
leaving the posterior lens capsule intact. An artificial intraocular lens 
(IOL) is implanted during surgery to focus light into the retina. </p>
<p>Following this surgery, patients still need glasses in order to read. 
But the improvement of bifocal contact lenses will do away with the 
need for glasses. </p>
<p>Cataract surgery is recommended when the condition affects a 
patient's everyday life. &quot;The severity of cataract surgery will vary in 
patients,&quot; says Koch, &quot;because a cataract affects different patients 
in different ways.&quot; </p>
<p>There may be<b> </b>no miracle drugs to make cataracts disappear, but 
there is good news about their treatment. </p>
<p>&quot;We've got the advances in technology. The techniques are better. 
The materials we use in surgery are better. And the intraocular 
lenses are getting better as well,&quot; Koch says, referring to advances 
made in the past five years. </p>
<p>In fact, Koch has just completed a test on a new folding lens, which 
allows surgeons to insert it through a much smaller incision than that 
required for an unbendable lens. </p>
<p>&quot;Approximately 30 patients at Methodist have been implanted with 
that lens, and the results have been excellent,&quot; Koch says. </p>
<p>What the smaller incision means for patients is less astigmatism and 
a stronger eye after surgery. The potential for better<b> </b>vision without 
glasses, and<b> </b>for a more rapid recovery of vision immediately 
following surgery, both increase with the smaller incision. </p>
<p>Also, implants can now be more appropriately sized than they were 
five years ago because more is known about the internal structure 
of the eye. Lenses are smaller so that even those that can't be 
folded can still fit through a smaller incision. New implants have also 
been designed to allow for more complex surgeries to be 
performed in cases where the posterior capsular support would 
normally be inadequate for an implant. </p>
<p>Misleading advertising has helped fuel the misconception that 
cataracts are removed by lasers. Although ophthalmologists 
pioneered lasers in surgery and use them regularly, lasers can only 
be used in cataract surgery when a secondary cataract is being 
removed. Secondary cataracts occur in 50 percent of patients a 
few months to a few years after they have undergone age-related 
cataract surgery. </p>
<p>Secondary cataracts are a clouding of the posterior capsule. &quot;That 
clouding of the capsule can result in a loss of vision that really 
matches the loss of vision the patient originally experienced with a 
cataract,&quot; Koch says. </p>
<p>The YAG laser, which uses the crystal of an yttrium aluminum 
garnet to create tiny, accurate incisions, is the instrument of choice 
for opening the membrane of the posterior capsule. &quot;The opening in 
the membrane is what is referred to as laser cataract surgery, but 
it's really, in fact, laser surgery for a secondary cataract,&quot; Koch 
adds. </p>
<p>Koch says there occasionally can be problems when a cataract is 
left to go into very advanced stages. Glaucoma or inflammation 
inside the eye can occur, although very rarely. The cataract must 
also be removed when the retina cannot be examined through the 
cloudy lens. </p>
<p>&quot;By and large, for the vast majority of people the reason we do 
cataract surgery is simply to help them see better<b>,&quot; </b>Koch says. </p>
<p>&#160; </p>
<p align=center><font size=4><em><strong><u>Finding a Magic Bullet</u></strong></em></font> </p>
<p>The reasons why the aging eye develops macular degeneration, 
glaucoma, or cataracts are not fully understood. Heredity is 
believed to be one factor. And research is proving two more 
factors play a role in diseases of the eye -- antioxidants and 
ultraviolet radiation. </p>
<p>Antioxidants, including vitamins A, C, E, and beta carotene and 
selenium, fight the oxidation process and may someday prove to 
ward off strokes, neurological diseases, and cancers as well as 
diseases of the eye. Lambert recommends antioxidants to his 
macular degeneration patients. He believes a 10-year study of 
antioxidants administered to patients with age-related macular 
degeneration will shed light on their benefits. </p>
<p>Koch agrees that antioxidants may prove helpful in fighting a 
number of diseases. He says he takes daily supplements of vitamins 
C and E. </p>
<p>A recent study of Chesapeake Bay fishermen found that those who 
wore UV-blocking glasses and caps with bills had fewer incidents 
of age-related cataracts than those who did not. Koch and Lambert 
stress to their patients the importance of keeping eyes protected 
from the damaging rays of the sun. </p>
<p>&quot;I recommend to my patients that if they're going to be outdoors for 
any significant period of time, particularly between 10 a.m. and 2 
p.m., that they have an ultraviolet filter in their glasses. And I 
routinely prescribe that in my patients' spectacle lenses,&quot; Koch says. </p>
<p>Myths about the difficulty of eye surgery keep many patients from 
seeking treatment. Eye surgery today is virtually painless and is 
performed on an outpatient basis. Cataract removal, for example, 
takes less than an hour. Patients return home the same day and are 
seen by the ophthalmologist the following day. Often, patients play 
golf or perform their favorite activities within a week or two. </p>
<p>Regular eye examinations are vital. Early diagnosis and treatment of 
an eye disease can translate to a lifetime of good vision. </p>
<p>Gripping, white-knuckled, the edge of a black abyss; searching 
aimlessly through the fog; running fast through a dark tunnel while 
the light ahead shrinks -- <em>these</em><b> </b>are dreams that put you in a cold 
sweat. They are also what macular degeneration, cataracts, and 
glaucoma can do if you let yourself sleep. </p>
<p>The darkness can always be escaped. You can choose to look 
toward the light. </p>

<p><font color="#0000A0"><font size=4><strong>Cataract</strong></font></font> is a condition in which the lens of the eye becomes dense or opaque and does not 
properly transmit light. </p>
<p><font color="#0000A0"><font size=4><strong>Chalazion</strong></font></font> is a small bump that develops on the upper or lower eyelid. It is caused by 
inflamed meibomian glands that produce the oil in tears. </p>
<p><font color="#0000A0"><font size=4><strong>Conjunctivitis</strong></font></font>, sometimes called<font color="#FF0000"> pink eye</font>, is an inflammation of the blood vessels in the 
conjunctiva, the membrane that covers the sclera and inside of the eyelids. </p>
<p><font color="#0000A0"><font size=4><strong>Diabetic Retinopathy</strong></font></font> is a disorder of the retina resulting from changes in the eye blood 
vessels and found in some people who have diabetes. </p>
<p><font color="#0000A0"><font size=4><strong>Dry eye</strong></font></font> is caused when there are insufficient tears to lubricate the eye and provide the 
protection it needs. </p>
<p><font color="#0000A0"><font size=4><strong>Floaters</strong></font></font> appear as spots, dots or lines and affect or interrupt vision and are usually caused by 
bits of debris in the vitreus humor. </p>
<p><font color="#0000A0"><font size=4><strong>Glaucoma </strong></font></font>is a disease that impairs the optic nerve when fluid and pressure build up in the 
eye and damage the optic nerve. </p>
<p><font color="#0000A0"><font size=4><strong>Iritis</strong></font> </font>is an inflammation of the iris of the eye. </p>
<p><font color="#0000A0"><font size=4><strong>Macular Degeneration</strong></font></font> is the breaking down, or degeneration, of the macula area of the 
retina of the eye. </p>

annual physical, there are two types of doctors who actually specialize in eye care: <br>
<ul>
<li>An <font color="#000000"><font size=4><em><strong>ophthalmologist</strong></em></font></font><font size=4> </font>is a physician who specializes in comprehensive eye care. 
They examine, diagnose, and treat eye disorders. They are skilled in all facets of eye 
care, from prescribing eyeglasses or contact lenses to performing intricate eye 
surgery. It is important to be examined regularly by an ophthalmologist because 
many eye disorders show no warning signs. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>An <font color="#000000"><font size=4><em><strong>optometrist</strong></em></font></font> is not a physician, but an eye specialist who is trained to test 
vision in order to prescribe eyeglasses or contact lenses.</li>
</ul>

<li>Although they do not test vision for prescribing glasses or contact lenses, <font color="#000000"><font size=4><em><strong>family 
practitioners or general internists</strong></em></font></font> may medically treat patients for some 
eye conditions.</li>

<tr><td valign=top width=600><font color="#0000A0"><font size=5><em><strong>L</strong></em></font></font>eonard Harrison's lack of focus was more than just a vision problem. <p>As a homeless person, Harrison did not have the foresight or even the 
eyeglasses to see the &quot;light at the end of the tunnel&quot; -- that is until help 
arrived from The Methodist Hospital and S.E.A.R.C.H. (Service of the 
Emergency Aid Resource Center for the Homeless). Harrison got double 
help -- eyeglasses and a job! </p>
<p>A &quot;Vision Fair,&quot; the first of its kind, provided 350 homeless men, women 
and children with eyeglasses through a special grant from The Methodist 
Hospital and the resources of S.E.A.R.C.H. </p>
<p>&quot;When I went to get glasses, I thought the way they did the tests was 
interesting so I asked a lot of questions,&quot; says Harrison. 'The next day they 
asked me if I wanted to train with the optician. Now that I'm in a job 
training program I can live at S.E.A.R.C.H. Things are really looking up.&quot; </p>
<p>Houston's homeless population has dropped 15 percent since 1989. Part of 
the reason for this decrease can be attributed to S.E.A.R.C.H.'s unique 
approach. It brings under one roof the resources to meet participants' 
needs: medical care, laundry facilities, job training, housing, and other 
services. This &quot;one-stop shopping&quot; approach has been recognized 
nationally as one of the most effective ways of alleviating homelessness. </p>
<p>&quot;We want to provide the homeless community a way to enhance their 
dignity and self-worth so that they can successfully re-enter society,&quot; says 
John Jacobs, Community Resource Coordinator at S.E.A.R.C.H. &quot;We 
expected about 50<b> - </b>60 percent of those tested would actually need eye 
glasses. In reality the need was almost 94 percent. it clearly demonstrates 
the minimal access to eye care on the street.&quot; </p>
<p>With additional help from The Methodist Hospital, S.E.A.R.C.H. has 
provided medical, dental, vision, and hearing treatments and screening for 
hundreds of homeless men, women and children. Hopes for the future 
include an in-house dental clinic to provide necessary exams and 
treatments. </p>
<p align=center>********************* </p>
<p>For information about making a donation, arranging a tour, or volunteering 
your time to help break the cycle of homelessness in Houston, contact 
S.E.A.R.C.H. at (713) 739-7752. </p>
<p>The Methodist Hospital is deeply committed to providing superior, cost- 
effective health care. For more information about Methodist's services, call

Summary: <ul>
Where your body stores excess fat can make a difference in your risk of heart disease,
          many scientists say. ëAppleí shaped people, whose extra weight tends to settle around
          their middles, suffer from heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, and other
          ailments at a higher rate than their pear-shaped friends, whose additional pounds collect
          around their hips. For the complete story,
 keep reading.<br><p></ul><p><p><br hs=180><p>
Is your body shaped like an apple..or a pear?  When it comes to your health, does it really matter?<p>Where your body stores excess fat can make a difference in your risk of heart disease, many scientists say.<p>'Apple' shaped people, whose extra weight tends to settle around their middles, suffer from heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, and other ailments at a higher rate than their pear-shaped friends, whose additional pounds collect around their hips.<p>Research supports this theory.  'Apples' tend to have lower HDL (good) cholesterol, and higher triglyceride levels.  All of these are associated with a greater risk of cardiovascular disease, according to Henry Pownall, MD, professor of Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine.<p>"One reason for the difference in cardiovascular risk is that apple-shaped people carry portal fat, which is fed by the portal blood system that drains blood from the abdominal organs and transports it to the liver," Pownall says.<p>Scientists theorize that this fat sticks to the intestines, slows down the liver's clearance of extra insulin from the blood, and disrupts the balance of blood cholesterol.<p>How can you tell if you're an apple or a pear?  Find your waist-to-hip ratio by measuring your waist at its smallest part and your hips at their widest point.  Divide the waist number by the hip number.  For women, anything below .75 is a pear, and above .80 is an apple.  For men, anything below .80 is a pear, and greater than .95 is an apple.<p>Body shape is mainly determined by genetics and your gender.  If your mother is apple-shaped, chances are good that you will be, too.<p>Obese men tend to be apples, while overweight women often are inclined to be pears.  But women entering menopause sometimes experience a shift in their area of fat accumulation, and go from pears to apples.  If that happens, their risk of heart disease and other health problems that plague apples increases as well.<p>If it seems that you're an apple, don't despair.  "The important thing about all of this is that apples should be especially vigilant about watching their health and fitness levels and working with their doctors," Pownall says.<p>That's good advice for all of us, no matter what shape we're in.<p>

Summary: <ul>
New evidence shows that very low levels of cholesterol in the body can make you
          more likely to die from a number of causes including liver disease, lung disease, certain
          cancers, strokes, even suicide or homicide. For the complete story,
 keep reading.<br><p></ul><p><p><br hs=180><p>

Caution:  Lowering your cholesterol may be hazardous to your health.  <p>Just when you thought it was safe to jog out into the world again, mean old cholesterol rears its greasy head.  But with a twist - new evidence shows that very low levels of cholesterol in the body can make you more likely to die from a number of causes including liver disease, lung disease, certain cancers, strokes, even suicide or homicide. <p>Studies recently published report evidence that people with extra-low levels of cholesterol die just as quickly from these causes as those with high cholesterol die from heart disease.  The studies don't argue with conventional advice to keep one's cholesterol down; they warn against allowing cholesterol levels to get too low.<p>For example, a study of 9,000 people in China found that people with cholesterol levels under 137 had a high mortality rate for disease and brain hemorrhage.  Other studies make a level under 160 the culprit for those diseases and more, including alcoholism.<p>Cardiologist Antonio Gotto Jr., chief of Methodist's Internal Medicine Service, agrees these reports are interesting but warrant more study.<p>"Before we change any public policy toward cholesterol, we need to make sure we are not doing any harm," Gotto told The New York Times.  "The No. 1 killer is (still) coronary disease, and the major cause is high levels of cholesterol in the blood."<p>Gotto also pointed out that associating such ailments as liver cancer and strokes with low cholesterol doesn't necessarily mean that low cholesterol causes them.  Lowered levels of cholesterol in the body simply makes a person more susceptible to certain diseases, he explained.<p>As for other factors such as suicide and violent death, Gotto said "those are recurrent themes that I think would deserve further explanation."<p>Gotto and other experts warn that despite these reports, nothing changes the basic fact that lowering your fat intake also substantially lowers your cholesterol and your risk of contracting heart disease.<p>In other words: reduce amounts of saturated fat consumed and take in plenty of vitamins, minerals, vegetables, fruits and fiber-rich food.  Do that, and you should hit the happy medium.<p>And don't worry about reports in the popular press.  As the Times so succinctly warned, "Today's news does not always become tomorrow's advice."<p>Reprinted from The Journal, The Methodist Hospital's quarterly magazine.<hr size=4></font><center><b><A HREF="/~imagemap/mhsmall"><IMG SRC="/methodist/icon/m-menu.gif" ISMAP border=0></a>

Summary: <ul>
Many assume if a restaurant is ethnic, it's got to be healthy. Alas, it just isn't so. Eating
          out saves only dish-washing time, not calories or fat. For the complete article, keep
          reading. For the complete story,
 keep reading.<br><p></ul><p><p><br hs=180><p>
Ethnic restaurants often Americanize dishes, ladling on cheese, butter, meat, and other fats that smother the grains, legumes, and vegetables of their native fare.<p>So don't order a Caesar salad, fettuccine Alfredo, and tiramisu, then wait for your arteries to unclog.<p>Instead, you can make dining less lethal with these do and don't tips when taking culinary world tours:<p><b>Italian</b><p>Do:  Go for tomatoes, eggless pasta with tomato sauce and sherbert-do as Southern Italians do.<p>Don't:  Choose bologna, salami, cheese, creamy sauces, veal parmigiana, and ice cream.  Keep in mind that olive oil, while it's a healthier kind, is still high in fat and calories.<p><b>Chinese</b><p>Do:  Seek wonton soup, steamed vegetable dumplings, steamed rice, and steamed whole fish.  That's the staple of the Chinese diet, which is only 15 percent fat.<p>Don't:  Fall for deep-fried egg rolls and fried chicken wings-they were created for Americans, anyway.  Also, forgo barbecued pork ribs, fried rice, sweet-and-sour dishes and chow mein with crispy fried noodles and fried rice.<p><b>Mexican</b><p>Do:  Try soft corn tortillas, which are ground corn, lime and water-and only one-seventh the saturated fat of flour tortillas.  Salsa, ceviche, chicken fajitas, grilled fish, grilled skinless chicken breast and pico de gallo also are low in fat.<p>Don't:  Order crispy tacos, chorizo sausage, refried beans, tostadas, tortilla chips, sour cream, and cheese-all bloated with saturated fat.<p><b>Japanese</b><p>Do:  Look on the menu for "yakimono," which means broiled, and "nabermono," which means boiled.  Select miso soups, chicken teriyaki, menrui noodles, steamed rice, sashimi, and sushi.<p>Don't:  Ask for the deep-fried tempura and anything "agemono," or deep-fried.<p><b>Greek</b><p>Do:  Seek pita bread, plain rice, fish, chicken or tzatziki, a dish made of yogurt and cucumbers.  Ask that fat be trimmed off leg of lamb, which is higher in saturated fat than beef.<p>Don't:  Select flaky phyllo dough, cheese, nuts, olives, feta cheese, and anchovies.<p><b>Middle Eastern</b><p>Do:  Middle Eastern baked stuffed eggplant and stuffed grape leaves are lower in fat than meats.  End your meal with fruit rather than baklava and other pastries.<p>Don't:  Falafel - deep-fried patties of garbanzo and fava beans - are high-fat, as is hummus, a pureed bean, sesame-seed and lemon dip.  Avoid dough-wrapped dishes.<p><b>Indian</b><p>Do:  Sesame oil, which is unsaturated, is better for you than coconut oil, which is highly saturated.  Eat chapati, a baked bread, rather than poori, which is fried bread.<p>Don't:  Eat deep-fried appetizers, coconut milk, and high-fat sauces.<p><b>French</b><p>Do:  Your body will thank you for fresh vegetable salads; unbuttered bread; steamed or grilled vegetables; grilled, broiled or roasted meat; and fish and poultry.  Start with consomme, a clear broth, and end with fruit.<p>Don't:  Ask for creamy sauces, au gratin, sweetbreads, and croissants.  Though wine sauces tend to be lower in fat than creamy ones, ask for any sauce to be served on the side.<p>Call ahead to learn what low-fat items are offered.  Ask that dressings and sauces be served on the side.  Say no to cheese, sour cream, red meat, and butter.  Ask that veggies be steamed and fish be grilled or baked, with no fats added.<p>Reprinted from The Journal, The Methodist Hospital's quarterly magazine.<hr size=4></font><center><b><A HREF="/~imagemap/mhsmall"><IMG SRC="/methodist/icon/m-menu.gif" ISMAP border=0></a>

Radiofrequency ablation may sound like a fancy name for static on your radio, but it's
          actually a technique used to "tune in" the rhythm of the heart. For the complete article,
          keep reading. For the complete story,
  keep reading.<br><p></ul><p><p><br hs=180><p>
"Radiofrequency ablation is a revolutionary medical technique," says Antonio Pacifico, a cardiologist at The Methodist Hospital.  "It allows us to fix the cause of a patient's fast heartbeat in just one day, eliminating the need for more complex open-heart surgery."<p>Normally, a heartbeat originates with a small electrical signal in the heart's right upper chamber - an area that acts as a natural pacemaker.  The signal then travels down and continues through the bottom half of the heart.<p>If the signal is blocked or starts in an area outside the heart's natural pacemaker, the heart may beat too fast.  Common symptoms are shortness of breath, chest pain or heavy pressure in the chest, palpitations or pounding in the chest, fatigue and possibly even fainting.  "In a small percentage of patients, an untreated fast heartbeat could be fatal," says Pacifico.<p>Patients who have any or all of these symptoms may need to undergo an electrophysiology study.  Doctors make a small incision in the patient's leg and feed a catheter through a vein to the heart to determine what is disturbing the heart's natural rhythm.  The tip of the catheter picks up electrical impulses from the heart and transmits those signals to a monitor.<p>Once the origin of the irregular heartbeat is identified, an ablation catheter is inserted and a pulse of radiofrequency radiation is used to melt the patch of tissue disturbing the heart rhythm without stimulating nerve endings or muscle.  "In essence, the radiofrequency ablation destroys the extra electrical connection without making a hole in the heart," says Pacificio.<p>The treatment's name comes from the radiation wavelength used, 300 to 500 kHz - just below the AM band on your car radio.  An earlier effort employed electrical energy, but it was too powerful and risked burning a hole in heart tissue.  <p>The procedure takes three to five hours and patients may go home the next day.<p><hr size=4></font><center><b><<A HREF="/~imagemap/mhsmall"><IMG SRC="/methodist/icon/m-menu.gif" ISMAP border=0></a>

Women don't need to be statistics when it somes to heart attacks. They just need to
          take a lesson from Jennie. She knew her family history, she knew her chest pain wasn't
          ordinary, and she didn't have to have a heart attack before getting the attention she
          needed. For Jennieís story, keep reading. For the complete article, keep reading. For
          the complete story,

On a stand in her bathroom sits The Positive Thinker's Guide to Handling Tough Problems.  When they get too tough, she prays from the Bible setting next to it.  Right now she's reading both.<p>Jennie Boatright has heart disease.  According to any number of stories and research findings on heart disease, Jennie should have been another statistic.<p>Studies report that women typically  deny symptoms of heart disease, that they are treated less aggressively than men, that their symptoms are often ignored by their doctors, and that they fare worse after angioplasty or bypass surgery.  Jennie debunked those statistics.<p>I met Jennie five days before her scheduled open heart surgery at The Methodist Hospital.  Even though her cardiologist, Albert Raizner, told me she was energetic, bright as could be, I was expecting to meet someone fragile, someone who looked like she had heart disease.  I was unprepared for who answered the door.<p>This was no ordinary woman.  Jennie Boatright is a shooting star.  Her sparkling blue eyes greeted me with familiarity, intent and interest.  Flashing a dazzling smile, she darted off to get us some iced tea.  She is infused with energy, quicker and lighter on her feet at 77 than most 50-year-olds.<p>"This is my second childhood, and I'm having a good time," says Jennie, whose husband died of cancer four years ago.  "I like theaters and movies, and I love to go square dancing." She also teaches children-something she's done ever since college.<p>'I wanna tell you, old age has its drawbacks, but it has its advantages, too," says Jennie.  What are they?  <p>"You wouldn't want me to tell you," she says with a wink.  Then she confesses.  "You don't menstruate!"<p>Unfortunately, menopause isn't an advantage when it comes to heart disease.  Menstruation, or the monthly cycling of estrogen throughout a woman's body, somehow protects her from heart disease.  Only when estrogen production stops does heart disease finally threaten women, as Jennie experienced first-hand.<p>"Right when I thought everything was just fine, all of a sudden I hit the bottom.<p>"I was outside mowing my yard and pain hit me in the chest," Jennie recalls.  'I knew something was wrong, because I was so tired, and that's not typical for me.  I'm a workaholic."<p>While she hadn't had any problems with her heart, she had some aches in her chest and back the past year.  Now she had classic symptoms of angina, chest pain due to constricting blood vessels around the heart.  "It disappeared when I sat down, but I have no patience for being puny," she says.<p>A standard treadmill test showed nothing out of the ordinary.  The doctor was confused, yet he knew Jennie had been treated for hypertension, one risk factor for women.  More important, Jennie knew heart problems ran in their family, and she knew the pressing sensation in their chest wasn't ordinary.<p>"Most of my family have died from heart attacks," says Jennie.  "My mother had a cerebral hemorrhage.  She was a hard worker and never went to a doctor. I guess she always thought when it was time to die, she'd die."<p>But unlike many women who have chest pain, denial is not in Jennie's vocabulary.<p>"I've done for my child, my grandson, my husband, all the way down to my dog," Jennie says.  'I figured it's time for me."<p>She was referred to Methodist cardiologist Albert Raizner, who ran a thallium treadmill test to confirm Jennie's hunch.  It did.  Her main coronary artery was 95 percent blocked.  Raizner put her on medicine to thin the blood so it would flow easier through her clogged artery.  Then, to open Jennie's artery, Raizner performed angioplasty.<p>Angioplasty is one treatment option used in Methodist's Cardiac Catherization Lab, which Raizner oversees.  During angioplasty, a catheter with a balloon tip is threaded through an artery in the arm until it reaches the plaque-narrowed coronary artery.  The balloon inflates, pressing the plaque against the artery wall and restoring blood flow to the heart.  As is common with both men and women, there is a risk of restenosis, or reclosing of the artery.<p>Jennie's didn't hold.<p>"Dr. Raizner came in, and you could just see how sorry he was," Jennie says.  "He's so sweet.  You know it really bugs him."<p>Although she could have had another angioplasty, Raizner broached the option of bypass surgery.<p>"You don't often do a single vessel bypass," Raizner explains, "but because her disease was so extensive, restenosis with angioplasty is so high in her situation that any angioplasty would be temporary."<p>While Jennie could have lived without surgery, even possibly survived a heart attack, she couldn't walk 10 feet without getting tired.  For Jennie, Raizner says, the quality of life is as important as survival.<p>"I didn't want to be limited," Jennie stresses.  'And I don't want to just exist.  I've got a lot of living to do.  <p>"I'm scared," she admits, "but my doctor here told me I was in the best hands."<p>In her hospital room the night before her surgery, Jennie sits with her daughter, Julia, an elementary school principal.  Both are eating dinner; they're calm, even animated.  Jennie reminisces about her childhood, her family, the things she learned form her mother.  <p>"My momma never got to go to college," Jennie says, "so she made sure I did.  She was such a strong woman."  It's a legacy she's passed down to her daughter.<p>When Raizner walks in, they talk to each other with mutual admiration.<p>"How are you feeling?" Raizner asks.<p>"Just fine...now let's get this over with," Jennie retorts.  She doesn't like sitting around, wants to get back to her dog, her plants, her life.<p>Raizner looks at me.  "Didn't I tell you she's a terrific lady?"<p>Jennie, grinning, threatens to hug him.  Raizner takes her up on it.<p>"Save one for me tomorrow," says Raizner, "after your surgery."<p>"I hope I can," Jennie signs.  "I've done all I can.  Now it's up to God..and you."<p>If he's feeling any pressure, he hides it with a reassuring smile.<p>George Noon, MD, a cardiovascular surgeon, performs hundreds of bypass surgeries each year.  As far as risk go, Jennie was a breeze.<p>"Older patients in general don't do as well in surgery," says Noon, "but the thing that's important is physiologic age.  Jennie's heart muscle function is good, despite the blockage.  Her lungs and kidney function are fine, she doesn't have ulcers or severe peripheral vascular disease, or any other problems that would cause specific complications."<p>Jennie's surgery went without a hitch.  In fact, she claims she felt no pain, didn't need to take painkillers.<p>One reason for bypass surgery is to eliminate the host of drugs she would have to take if she hadn't had the operation, says Raizner.  The only drug she'll take long-term is aspirin, which works like an anti-coagulant to reduce potential clotting.<p>I check in to see how Jennie is feeling.  She's sitting in her chair, a few days from going home.  Her mended heart beats firmly, and the blood flowing easily through her arteries sends a faint blush to their cheeks.<p>"I just can't eat," she says.  "I can't eat anything."  Alarmed, I ask her if she's feeling queasy.<p>"No!" she says.  'I want a hamburger...with lots of onions."<p>Jennie Boatright is unique, but her story isn't.  Doctors are more alert than ever to women and their heart symptoms, and updated research will offer women even more options for treatment and prevention.<p>Women don't need to be statistics.  They just need to take a lesson from Jennie.<p>She knew her family history, she knew her chest pain wasn't ordinary, and she didn't have to have a heart attack before getting the attention she needed.<p>Jennie has a hard time believing all women are not like her, aggressive in their search for information, willing and ready to confront their health.<p>When I tell her that people may not believe she's a real person, that they'll think I made her up for this story, those comet-like eyes fix on me.<p>"I'm real, all right.  You tell them to call me."<p>Reprinted from The Journal, The Methodist Hospital's quarterly magazine.<hr size=4></font><center><b><A HREF="/~imagemap/mhsmall"><IMG SRC="/methodist/icon/m-menu.gif" ISMAP border=0></a>

Summary: <ul>
Heart disease robs more female lives than all cancers combined. Wo why has it taken
          more than 80 years to figure that out? For the complete article, keep reading. For the
          complete story,

At 77, Jennie Boatright is having the time of her life.  She dances, she teaches, she mows her own yard.  One night she's playing cards with a friend, and the next she's driving to Galveston for a play.<P>There's just one thing slowing her 100-mile-an-hour pace.  Jennie has heart disease.<P>Surprised?  So was she.<P>Jennie recently had bypass surgery at The Methodist Hospital, where her surgeon spliced a diseased artery near her heart and grafted in a healthy, working one.<P>Because Jennie isn't a man, she wasn't supposed to have surgery.  And because she isn't a man, the surgery probably shouldn't have gone as smoothly as it did.  Technically, she shouldn't even be recovering.<P>But Jennie doesn't know that.  She hasn't read any number of articles on women and heart diseases in the last few years, and that's good.  They may have scared her to death.<P>If you believe breast cancer poses the greatest threat to women, think again.  Heart disease robs more female lives that all cancers combined.  About half of the 500,000 annual deaths from heart attack alone are women.<P>When this news broke about four years ago., physicians were puzzled, researchers were embarrassed, and women were indignant.  Women die of stroke, cancer, or just old age.  Men die of heart disease.<P>Or so we thought.<P>While only one in nine American women display symptoms of heart disease between ages 45 and 65, their risk leaps to one in three--the same as men--from age 65 on.  Which makes it an equal opportunity killer.<P>But that's not why women are indignant.  After all, even women have to die from something.  It's the stories of medical discrimination that say women don't get the same care as men.<P>What makes the stories even more beguiling is the rampant finger-pointing.  If heart disease has been killing American women since the early 1900s, as the American Heart Association reports, why has it taken 80-plus years for the news to leak?  Women are blaming physicians, physician blame research, and researchers have nowhere to pass the buck.<P>As the pieces of the puzzle slowly come together, it looks more like a misdirected effort and lack of information than a blatant bias against women.<P>Truth is, no one's at fault.  Reality simply unveiled itself and medicine is scrambling to catch up.  Modern medicine isn't always as modern as we think.<P>For centuries, the earth thought it was the center of the universe, until Copernicus dreamed up the solar system.  People responded with righteous indignation back then, too.<P><b>"The Yentl Syndrome"</b><P>Yentl, a fictional character, disguised herself as a male to get an education.  An article called "The Yentl Syndrome"  - published two years ago in The New England Journal of Medicine - accused doctors of habitually neglecting women who report signs of coronary heart disease.  The conclusion of this medical metaphor: only when a woman proved to be "just like a man" by having a heart attack was she was treated as aggressively as a man.<P>The author was Bernadine Healy, the first woman to head the U.S. National Institutes of Health.  Her two years at the NIH helm sparked nationwide discussion over the dearth of research for and including women.  This, coupled with the reality that equal numbers of women and men die of heart attack, prompted medicine to take a long, hard look at what it did and didn't know about women and their hearts.<P>New research looked at how women were treated and how they responded to treatment.  New research looked at old research to see where the glitch was.<P>When the initial smoke cleared, red flags waved across the country.  Every woman's magazine, newspaper, and medical journal ran stories on women and heart disease.  All had the same slant: women were victims of medical discrimination.  The stories listed study upon study documenting how women's heart symptoms were ignored or treated less aggressively than men's, how women were dying from angioplasty and bypass surgery, treatments clinically tested on and developed for men and supposedly not applicable to women.<P>Is it a case of discrimination?  Is medicine - doctors and researchers - to blame?<P><b>Skewed From The Get Go</b><P>"Physicians have tended to underestimate the significant risk of coronary disease in women," concedes Antonio Gotto Jr., MD, chief of Internal Medicine at The Methodist Hospital.  He believes that this "benign neglect" was the result of an unfounded myth concerning women and heart disease.<P>"It isn't discrimination as much as a misunderstanding of the relative risks of women," he adds, "and the false notion that women just don't get coronary disease."<P>The fact is until recent decades, heart disease wasn't considered much of an issue with the other gender.<P>"When I graduated from medical school in 1953, textbooks had no more than a paragraph regarding the treatment of heart attacks," says William Winters, MD, a Methodist cardiologist and former president of the American College of Cardiology.<P>"Now there are whole textbooks on it," Winters adds.  "What we know about cardiovascular disease we've learned since the late 1950s.  And it's changing all the time."<P>In 1948, Framingham, Massachusetts, began a monumental and comprehensive study of heart disease by examining potential risk factors.  The Framingham Heart study charted the course of coronary heart disease in 5,200 women and men, ages 30 through 62, and reviewed their health status every two years.<P>The suspicion that heart disease affected primarily men in their prime was confirmed by Framingham's first report.  Men had far more serious cases of heart disease than women, and the majority of the 61 women (out of 2,844) experiencing some type of heart problem had angina, chest pain seen rarely in men and thought to be harmless at the time.<P>Women and physicians were lulled into a false sense of security.  Women are protected from heart disease until menopause, but two thirds of the women studied were premenopausal, which explains why so few incidents of heart disease were found among them.<P>A paradox was launched.  As research confirmed men to be at high-risk, subsequent research trials focused exclusively on finding treatments for men.  It wasn't an issue of deliberate discrimination, says Gotto, it was simply a case of focusing on those who were at higher risk.<P>	"You don't start testing in low-risk groups until you've defined the high-risk groups," he explains.<P>Only when cholesterol guidelines came out five years ago, based on studies with men, was the need for studies including women apparent, says Gotto.<P>But there were other reasons research didn't identify women.  For years, clinical trials excluded people over 65 years-the average age heart disease catches up to women.  Since men average heart attacks in their 50s, research showed a disproportionate number of male victims.<P>Health problems in the "elderly"-those over the cutoff age-weren't addressed because, as Winters points out, doctors expected to see problems as their patients aged.<P>"We used to laugh about a physician here who saw patients in their 80s and 90s."  Winter remembers.  "Now, I have patients over 100!"<P>While a woman's average life span has reached 79, a decade ago 70 would have been considered old, says Albert Raizner, MD, director of Methodist's Cardiac Catherization Lab.<P>"Doctors then may have been more tentative treating older people-which eliminated many women from certain therapies," Raizner says.  "Our perception of "old age" has changed, and it's brought a bigger population of women into therapeutic choices."  In the last 10 to 20 years, he adds, cardiologists have gotten more daring and aggressive in managing the health of older people in general.<P>The one obvious gender bias in research, Raizner points out, has been toward women of childbearing age.  Exposure to experimental drugs or therapies may cause birth defects, and some drugs are difficult to monitor during a woman's hormonal fluctuations.<P>"But it's almost moot," he says, "because women at childbearing age rarely come down with heart disease."<P>The Hoofbeats Of Horses<P>Barring research, there's another story behind the statistics.  While medicine may be a convenient scapegoat, the only accurate charge is it still has a lot to learn.<P>Any collective finger pointing should first be directed at Mother Nature.  She protected women from heart disease throughout their childbearing years and left them to fend for themselves after menopause.<P>It's not that premenopausal women are spared the underlying damage to coronary arteries: once they lose the mysterious protection afforded from ovulation, the hidden damage accelerates.  Because of that, heart disease almost exclusively preys on older women.<P>Yet the most highly publicized stories are various versions of the one 30-year-old anomaly whose symptoms slipped past doctors.<P>When younger women come in with chest pain, it is rarely due to heart disease.  <P>"Younger women are going to be assumed not to have heart disease unless there's some danger that makes the situation more suspicious-smoking, high blood pressure, diabetes," says Raizner.<P>"If they complain of chest pain yet have none of those risk factors, statistically they are not likely to have coronary artery disease," he explains.  "There's a different distribution in the types of problems we see for a given age group of women and men."<P>Chest pain can be attributed to a variety of factors other than the heart, Winters concurs.  Gastrointestinal disorders, the esophagus or stomach, inflammation within the chest wall, such as arthritis of the ribs, all present as chest pain.<P>While mitral valve prolapse is very common in young women, heart disease is not, and doctors must logically follow an old medical maxim:  "When you hear hoofbeats, think horses not zebras."<P>"We would be thrown out of the medical society if every young woman who came in with chest pain were to undergo a complete workup," says Raizner.  "It's not a gender bias...it's simply not appropriate."<P>Raizner muses over the paradox.  "It's an interesting twist to be accused of not doing enough testing or treatment when, as a rule, society thinks physicians do an excessive amount of both."<P><b>Nature Versus Nurture</b><P>While physicians are now sensitized to women and their symptoms, there's another paradox they can't control: they can't detect heart disease unless they're given the chance.<P>		"Women are often the impetus behind a man going to a doctor," says Raizner.  Yet a woman's nurturing instincts can backfire.  With the possible exception of their gynecologic health, many women fail to take their own health seriously.  In fact, women are more likely to put off seeking medical advice, paying more attention to their husband's chest pains than their own.<P>When it comes to heart attack, the average time lapse before a man calls for help is one hour.  A woman will wait four to eight hours.<P>She may not call at all.  Of those women stricken with a heart attack, 40 percent have the symptomless "silent" kind-they don't know they're having one.  The longer she waits before seeking help, the lower a woman's chances of receiving drugs that can halt a heart attack in its tracks.<P>Clot busters, like TPA and streptokinase, dissolve blood clots that close off blood vessels and restore blood flow and oxygen to the heart.  If the artery remains blocked, the heart tissue can't get enough oxygen and begins to die.  Once tissue dies, the heart is permanently damaged, so the timing of clot busters is crucial.<P>This may explain one bias statistic, that women are less likely to be given clot busters than men.  Clot busters are ineffective unless administered within two hours of the attack, making a woman's average six-hour waiting time detrimental to her recovery.<P>Then there's a biological paradox.  The first sign of heart disease in men is usually a heart attack, requiring immediate medical help with clot-busting drugs and often open heart surgery.<P>By contrast, a woman is usually forewarned of heart problems by angina, chest pain caused by constricted coronary vessels.  Roughly 56 percent of women have angina before a heart attack.<P>Angina can exist for years, indicating a slow progression of fatty buildup in arteries.  Chest pains in women are easily disguised, and many women experience angina without suspecting heart disease.  While for men the classic heart attack warning is a crushing sensation in the mid-chest that may radiate down the left arm, women often experience a more subtle, lingering pain or vague discomfort.  They may write it off as anxiety, an ulcer, even indigestion.<P>"Heart disease shows up in older women at a time when they may be less active than they were at 50," says Raizner.  Since symptoms usually show up after physical activity, he continues, older women may not exert themselves enough to bring on angina.  On the other hand, they may cut out strenuous activity, blaming their chest pain on exercise.<P>It may be a case of denial.  A study last May showed women to be four times more likely to refuse a heart transplant than men, even when it meant their only chance for survival.  This report has fueled a growing hypothesis that women in general may be less willing than men to accept aggressive testing and treatment.<P><b>Debunking the Myths</b><P>When heart disease is diagnosed, women should benefit from the same treatments as men.  Blood-thinning drugs and other medications, while clinically tested in men, seem to work well for women.<P>But research on two other options, angioplasty and coronary bypass surgery, is conflicting rates for women having angioplasty and higher mortality rates for bypass surgery.  Ironically, studies also report that women are not offered these lifesaving treatments as often as men, and they subtly blame physicians for the fact that more women, approximately 67 percent, die from their first heart attack than do men.<P>It's a Catch-22 with a catch.<P>"Women have smaller arteries, they're older when they present with symptoms, and they tend to have multiple risk factors by the time problems are detected," says Raizner.<P>The average age a woman develops symptoms of heart disease is around 65.  And age, regardless of gender, is a risk factor in itself. <P>"The average age for coronary artery bypass surgery in both men and women has been creeping up for a number of years," says Joseph Coselli, MD, a cardiologist surgeon at Methodist.  In the past, there may have been a slight tendency to offer less surgery to women because they're typically older than men, but now there is virtually no separation.<P>Surgeons now look at a person's physiologic age and the overall condition of their heart instead of chronological age, says Coselli.<P>Another factor is vessel size.  <P>"A woman's vessels are smaller than a man's, although they're very comparable relative to body size," Coselli says.<P>Does it make surgery technically more difficult?<P>"Yes, of course.  But surgically, there are risk factors far more important than gender and vessel size," Coselli says.  "Left ventricular function, the extent of the disease, one versus three blockages, history of congestive heart failure, and any prior heart attacks are all things we weigh with regard to risk for surgery, not so much whether they're male or female."<P>Because signs of heart disease can go undetected for years, it has often caused extensive damage by the time it catches up to a woman in her 70s.<P>Add the fact that women usually have more co-existing conditions than men, such as diabetes, obesity, hypertension, or atherosclerosis, and it's bound to make any treatment more challenging.<P>Risk factors may also be more detrimental in women.  An ongoing study of 10,000 women in Chicago found that those who smoke, have high blood pressure, and elevated blood cholesterol face five times the normal risk of sudden death versus men with the same risk factors.  <P>Of course, every published study is followed by another that contradicts it.<P>"There's some controversy as to whether or not those statistics pan out, because there are different ways of looking at data," says Raizner.  "If you try to match features, such as the number of disease arteries, you tend to balance out.  Women with triple-vessel disease get operated on as much as men with the same."<P>It also seems to depend on where the research was done.<P>Physicians at Methodist have reviewed  their angioplasty patients and found results in women and men to be similar.  However, an analysis of the risk classification of female patients at Methodist has not yet been done.<P>"There's no reason to think that any treatments benefiting men would not also benefit women, including the more drastic treatments such as bypass surgery or angioplasty," says Gotto.<P>In fact, a study of almost 5,000 men and women in Seattle found that while women were indeed older than men and had more severe heart disease when hospitalized for heart attack, angioplasty and clot-busting drugs were as safe and beneficial for them as for men.<P>Reports from a national angioplasty study confirmed that women leaving the hospital after angioplasty or bypass surgery had survival rates comparable to men.  It also found that four years after angioplasty, women were less likely to have suffered a heart attack, to have required another angioplasty, or to have needed bypass surgery.<P>Just last May, a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association reported that once angina was diagnosed in both men and women, the risk of heart attack or death was significantly lower in women.<P>There are enough studies to wallpaper your entire home.<P><b>Collective Keepers Of The Gate</b><P>As information on heart disease mounts with overwhelming speed, everyone with a stake in the health care process needs to be accountable.  Women need to be aware of unnatural symptoms and report them to their physician.  Doctors must rely on standard guidelines and be aware of new research to keep up with their area of expertise.  And researchers must study risk factors in men and women to seek the best possible treatment for both.<P>To its credit and the prompting of Bernadine Healy, the NIH has scrambled to redress research problems.  Healy's ardent challenge for more information on women's health problems birthed the Women's Health Initiative - a massive 14-year clinical study of disease in women as they age.<P>Several ongoing studies have already been launched to determine risks in women, and the NIH is stringently enforcing a nine-year rule requiring research funded by NIH to include women and minorities or have a clear reason why it shouldn't.<P>At Methodist, Gotto and fellow physician J. Alan Herd are testing a cholesterol-lowering drug soon to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration.  Its the biggest study of its kind to be published, says Herd, and 80 of the participants are women.<P>Another Methodist/Baylor researcher, John Foreyt, will work directly on studies for the Women's Health Initiative.  Foreyt and his colleagues are competing with other leading medical centers to have Methodist designated as one of the national centers for the study.<P>While it will take several years before current research yields a clearer picture, it's bound to eliminate many myths and misunderstandings.  For now, women and their doctors must rely on modern medicine until research catches up.<P>Actually, it almost has.  Punch in "women and heart disease" in the Texas Medical Center library's database and you'll get 1,522 studies and research reviews.  And those are only completed studies from the last five years.<P>Of course, there are some positive facts the daily "who's on first" research conundrums tend to obscure.  Namely, there are approximately 6,256,570 more women than men in the United States, all falling in the 65-and-older age group.  If you look at ratios, heart disease kills a smaller percentage of women than men.  But let's not quibble over minor statistics.<P>In the long run, women endure life much longer, and typically in better health, than men.<P>And if statistics for women and heart disease seem skewed and unsettling, maybe that's just the point.  Maybe what women need is a good scare to jolt them out of complacency before a heart attack does it first.<p>Reprinted from The Journal, The Methodist Hospital's quarterly magazine.<hr size=4></font><center><b><A HREF="/~imagemap/mhsmall"><IMG SRC="/methodist/icon/m-menu.gif" ISMAP border=0></a>

Summary: <ul>
When it comes to gender, heart disease is an equal-opportunity killer. While most
          studies on the disease have focused on men, women have risk factors of their own. For
          the complete article, keep reading.. For the complete story,
  keep reading.<br><p></ul><p><p><br hs=180><p>

For years, medical students were taught that being a man was a primary risk factor for heart disease.  Now they know better: no matter who wears the pants in the family, heart disease strikes men and women equally.<p>What isn't equal are studies that assess risk factors that, to date, have been conducted mostly on men.  Women have their own risks, and while many are the same as a man's, some are more threatening than others.<p>"Risk factor interventions have not been carried out and given a full evaluation in women," says Antonio Gotto Jr., MD, chief of Methodist's Internal Medicine Service, But, he says, the National Institutes of Health are redoing key trials to determine women's risk factors-looking at, for example, the role of cholesterol, diet and other therapies in halting or slowing the progression of heart disease.<p>Overall, physicians are becoming vigilant in addressing risk factors with their female patients, especially when it comes to their medical history.  According to Methodist cardiologist William Winters, a complete medical history can help physicians diagnose any problems, regardless of gender.<p>"It's a lot like reading a mystery novel," Winters says.  "Something happens, but you don't have the answer in the first chapter.  By the time you get three quarters through, you know where it's going."  <p>Here's what is known so far about a woman's risks:<p>AGE/MENOPAUSE: Heart disease usually strikes women after menopause, when they lose the protective effects of estrogen.  Estrogen doesn't prevent heart disease, it simply delays it.  Statistics from the American Hospital Association validate that fact - 73 percent of women who have heart attacks are 65 and older.  Post menopausal women at high risk for heart disease should discuss the pros and cons of estrogen replacement therapy with their physician.  They should also take responsibility for their health by paying attention to suspicious symptoms and reporting anything new to their physician.<p>HEREDITY: Family history accounts for approximately 35 percent of a person's overall risk of heart disease.  If family members have had heart disease, you're more prone to it yourself.  The key is to let your physician in on it.  Ask your doctor about stress testing as part of your routine check up.  Pay attention to recurring chest tightness, pressure, or shortness of breath.  These classic signs of angina can happen without exercise.<p>DIABETES: Diabetes cancels any positive effects of estrogen and puts both women and men at greater risk.  A female diabetic has three times the risk of heart disease as a nondiabetic woman.  Women with diabetes typically have high blood pressure and high cholesterol, doubling their risk.  Since adult-onset diabetes is linked to obesity, losing weight can greatly reduce the risk of both adult-onset diabetes and heart disease.<p>SMOKING: With the number of female smokers increasing, smoking is now the most significant risk factor for heart attack in women.  Female smokers raise their risks two to six times more than non-smokers.  Smoking raises blood pressure and feeds atherosclerosis-hardening of the arteries.<p>Smokers who take birth control pills play Russian roulette with heart attack, raising their risk 40 times.  The reason is unclear, but oral contraceptives are suspects in the formation of blood clots, and smoking constricts arteries; the combination can be deadly.  A year after quitting a pack-a-day habit, death risk from heart attack will be the same as if you never smoked.<p>CHOLESTEROL: People think cholesterol is synonymous with heart disease.  But a high cholesterol count may be misleading-simply a surplus of HDL, the "good" cholesterol.  It's the ratio of good to bad cholesterol (LDL) that really matters.<p>Although high cholesterol puts both men and women at risk, HDL is a better predictor of risk in women.  Low HDL in a woman with high total cholesterol puts her at particularly high risk for heart disease, but if HDL levels soar, her risk may be low even if her total cholesterol is high.<p>Other fats in the blood, namely triglycerides, are found to raise a woman's risk more so than a man's.<p>When it comes to cholesterol screening, screen the screener.  Most walk-in tabletop screening tests give you total cholesterol but can't tell you the ratio of good to bad cholesterol.  Nor do they measure triglycerides and other blood fats.  Blood tests should be done in a hospital lab equipped to measure all blood fat components.  Not only will it be more accurate, but you can get follow up advice from your doctor.<p>OBESITY: The nationally known Framingham study found that for every pound above ideal body weight, coronary death rates rise 2 percent.<p>While other studies confirm that obesity raises a woman's risk, where those love handles hang plays a role, too.  Women may complain of needing to lose a few in their hips and derrieres, but their pear-shaped bodies fare better with HDL levels than their beer-bellied brothers.  Regular aerobic exercise three times a week (for at least 30 minutes) and a low-fat eating plan, both under a doctor's supervision, will help lose and maintain weight.<p>HYPERTENSION: High blood pressure raises your risk of heart attack three to five times.  If your systolic measurement (the top number) is consistently more than 140, or if your diastolic (bottom) number is consistently more than 90, you have high blood pressure.  Recent studies show women may tolerate high blood pressure better than men.<p>STRESS: Some people theorize that women started developing heart disease when they entered the work force just a generation or two ago.  While the Framingham study failed to support that theory, it did find personality type to be a risk factor.  Women classified as "type A" - hypercritical, hostile, time-pressured - were twice as likely to suffer heart attacks as women with "type B" or relaxed personalities.<p>

show that cardiovascular disease, or heart disease, is 
America's leading health problem and the leading cause of 
death. Consider these statistics: </p>

<li>Coronary heart disease - 13,490,000</li>
<li>Stroke - 3,820,000</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Almost one out of every two Americans will die of cardiovascular

</ul>
<ul>
<li>Each year, more than one million Americans die from 
cardiovascular disease. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Nearly as many people die from cardiovascular disease as from

<p align=center><font color="#FF0000"><em><strong>Not knowing you're at risk for heart disease <br>
can be the biggest risk of all. </strong></em></font></p>
<p align=left>A heart attack may happen to anyone, but in general, 
according to the American Heart Association, there 
are certain people more at risk for a heart attack. 
Managing your risks for a heart attack begins with 
examining which of the risk factors apply to you, and 
then taking steps to eliminate or reduce them. Risk 
factors generally fall into two groups -- inherited (or 
genetic) and acquired: </p>
<p align=left><font color="#000080"><strong><u>Inherited or Genetic Risk Factors</u></strong></font> </p>
<p align=left>Inherited or genetic risk factors are those that you are 
born with. They can't be changed, but can be 
improved with medical management and lifestyle 
changes. People who fall into this risk-factor category 
include: </p>
<ul>
<li>Men, women, and children with a family history 
of heart disease before age 55 </li>
<li>Men, women, and children with diabetes 
mellitus </li>
<li>Men, women, and children with inherited 
hypertension &#151; high blood pressure </li>
<li>Men, women, and children with inherited low 
levels of <a href="mfatsin.htm#HDL (high-density lipoprotein) cholesterol">HDL (high-density lipoprotein)</a> or high 
levels of <a href="mfatsin.htm#LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol">LDL (low-density lipoprotein)</a> blood 
cholesterol </li>
<li>Aging men and women </li>
<li>Women, after the onset of menopause &#151; 
generally, men are at risk at an earlier age than 
women, but after the onset of menopause, women 
are equally at risk. </li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><font color="#000080"><strong><u>Acquired Risk Factors</u></strong></font> </p>
<p>Acquired risk factors are those caused by activities 
that we choose to include in our lives. They can be 
managed through lifestyle changes and clinical care. 
Those who fall into this risk-factor category include: </p>
<ul>
<li>People who smoke cigarettes </li>
<li>People who are overweight by 30 percent </li>
<li>People with acquired hypertension &#151; high 
blood pressure </li>
<li>People with acquired low levels of <a href="mfatsin.htm#HDL (high-density lipoprotein) cholesterol">HDL (high 
density lipoprotein)</a> or high levels of <a href="mfatsin.htm#LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol">LDL (low 
density lipoprotein)</a> blood cholesterol </li>
<li>People who are under stress </li>
<li>People with sedentary lifestyles </li>

<tr><td valign=top width=600>Current genetic research at The Methodist Hospital and Baylor College 
of Medicine may one day identify a gene that helps to cause a devastating 
and sometimes fatal heart disease.<br>
<br>
Investigators have mapped a genetic abnormality&#151;a signpost, if you 
will, that could point toward the source for an inherited disease called 
cardiomyopathy, a disease that causes the heart's ventricles to lose 
pumping strength.<br>
<br>
&quot;Dilated cardiomyopathy, whether inherited or acquired, accounts for 70 
percent of all heart failure,&quot; says Robert Roberts, M.D., chief of 
Cardiology at Methodist and Baylor. &quot;In line with that, our goal is to 
identify the precise gene that shows a part of development that is 
impaired, resulting in dilated cardiomyopathy.<br>
<br>
&quot;Although the inherited form accounts for about 20 percent of all dilated 
cardiomyopathy, it is likely that some common theme will emerge that 
can be transferred to patients who have the acquired form of the disease,&quot; 
adds Roberts.<br>
<br>
Identification of the culprit gene and mutation should provide important 
insight into the mechanisms of dilated cardiomyopathy. For example, a 
screening test can be developed for members of affected families.<br>
<br>
&quot;Patients can be screened early in life because we know that many 
people with dilated cardiomyopathy die early in life or die suddenly as 
young adults,&quot; says Roberts. &quot;If we can identify affected individuals, 
even with our routine symptomatic therapy and with use of defibrillators, 
we can probably prevent sudden death and buy time until a curative 
therapy can be found.&quot;<br>
<br>
The breakthrough findings emerged from a linkage analysis of 46 
members (and four generations) of a single family, 10 of whom have 
familial dilated cardiomyopathy. The work showed that the inherited 
form of the disease is an autosomal dominant condition.<br>
<br>
In the United States, dilated cardiomyopathy occurs in about 
36.5/100,000. Normally the disease typically appears early in life and 
has a 75 percent mortality within five years of diagnosis. Patients with 
dilated cardiomyopathy account for a large percentage of the heart 
transplantations performed in this country, and they make up a substantial 
portion of the national transplant waiting list.<br>

Treated at Methodist -- Twice</strong></font></font></p>
<div align=center><center>
<table cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 width=600>
<tr><td valign=top width=600>Never question the heart of a champion, goes the old saying, and nobody 
ever questions the heart of Houston Rockets center Hakeem Olajuwon.<p>But the basketball player had an occasion to question his own heart late in 
1996, as he was admitted to The Methodist Hospital twice in a two-week 
period. He suffered bouts of abnormal heart rhythm, or arrhythmia, that 
concerned Rockets team doctors enough to admit him to the hospital each 
time. </p>
<p>The first episode came during a game against the Minnesota 
Timberwolves on Nov. 19. Olajuwon was flown back to Houston and 
admitted into Methodist, where he was examined by doctors and given a 
defibrillation, an electric shock that returns the heart to its normal rhythm. 
He was released from the hospital two days later. </p>
<p>The second episode occurred Dec. 1, a few hours after the All-Star center 
played with his team against the Washington Bullets. Doctors monitored 
Olajuwon's heartbeat and assessed his reaction to rhythm-controlling 
medication, and he was released after a one-night stay. </p>
<p>The superstar player was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, a condition 
that causes the heart to beat faster than normal. Where the normal adult 
heart beats an average of 60 times per minute, atrial fibrillation can 
accelerate the pace up to 400 beats per minute. </p>
<p>Dr. Robert Roberts, chief of Cardiology at Methodist and Baylor College 
of Medicine, said the condition is generally caused by a malfunction of 
the electrical system that powers the heart. Normally, the heart's 
pacemaker (or SA node) keeps the atria contracting by sending fast or 
slow electrical signals, depending on how hard the person is exerting 
himself. </p>
<p>During atrial fibrillation, the atria is bombarded with electrical impulses 
from areas of the heart other than the SA node. This produces a fast, 
irregular heart beat which, in turn, makes the heart pump less efficiently. </p>
<p>Normally it is not a condition that could cause damage, if it is treated 
quickly, said Roberts. In Olajuwon's case, it was important to defibrillate 
him and return his heart rhythm to normal. If the errant rhythm had 
continued for days, he could have developed a clot that would cause a 
stroke </p>
<p>Dr. James Muntz, an internal medicine specialist at Methodist and one of 
the Rockets' team doctors, treated Olajuwon while he was in the hospital. 
He said Olajuwon's condition is fairly common and is not in any way 
life-threatening. He could have another episode tomorrow, or never have 
one again for the rest of his life said Muntz. But it shouldn't affect his 
career at all. </p>
<p>Olajuwon's condition, atrial fibrillation, should not be confused with 
ventricular fibrillation, which has been cited as causing the deaths of 
other professional and college basketball players. Those are two different 
conditions, said Muntz. Following a short rest after his second hospital 
visit, Olajuwon returned to his team and continues to be a standout player 
in the Rockets' bid for a third National Basketball Association 
championship. </p>
<p>The only player in the history of the league to win the regular-season and 
NBA finals Most Valuable Player and Defensive Player of the Year 
awards (1994) and the real Dream behind America's Olympic Dream 
Team in 1996, Olajuwon is the heart -- if not the soul -- of the two-time 
world champion Houston Rockets. His two hospital stays attracted 
attention from the international sports media. As he was released each 
time, television cameras followed Olajuwon as he walked to his parked 
car. I am flattered by everyone's concern, and I appreciate the care I 
received while at Methodist, he said. </p>

has had a heart attack, using a new test developed by researchers at The 
Methodist Hospital and Baylor College of Medicine's DeBakey Heart 
Center.<br>
<br>
The test gives doctors an answer within two hours, opposed to a 12- to 
14-hour time frame required by the currently used procedure.<br>
<br>
Researchers hope the new test will reduce the cost of treating heart 
attacks by allowing doctors to appropriately treat and discharge patients 
having &quot;false alarms.&quot;<br>
<br>
A team led by Robert Roberts, MD, chief of Cardiology at Methodist, 
developed the test along with Peter Puleo, MD, a former Methodist 
cardiologist now working at Allegheny General Hospital in Pittsburgh.<br>
<br>
The new test provides accurate results faster because it detects two 
forms of the enzyme MB creatine kinease, which is released by injured 
heart tissue. The amount of the enzyme in the bloodstream increases 
gradually for as long as 18 to 20 hours after a heart attack begins.<br>

<tr><td valign=top width=600>Timothy Erwin is an athlete and a coach in good physical condition. He 
was surprised to discover a heart defect left him out of breath after doing 
simple tasks like climbing stairs.<br>
<br>
Not quite as shocked, however, as he was when doctors told him his 
condition could possibly be cured by a shot of alcohol.<br>
<br>
Nothing that would make him intoxicated, mind you&#151;it's a new treatment 
for an inherited and potentially fatal heart condition that kills hundreds of 
young people every year. The new treatment is currently available at The 
Methodist Hospital, and Erwin was the first patient in the United States 
to receive it.<br>
<br>
Doctors inject a small amount of pure alcohol into blood vessels near the 
heart to remedy symptoms caused by an overgrown muscle between the 
heart's pumping chambers.<br>
<br>
Erwin, 38, suffers from hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. This 
genetic disorder causes the septum, a muscle dividing the right and left 
chambers of the heart, to become overgrown. Because of the extra 
muscle, the heart works harder and pumps blood too fast. The bulging 
muscle also blocks normal blood flow to the rest of the body.<br>
<br>
The new procedure involves a simple injection of 100 percent alcohol 
(ethanol) to the overgrown tissue, which causes cells in the excess 
muscle to die and shrink. To do this, doctors must send a catheter into 
blood vessels that feed the offending tissue. They then inject the ethanol 
into these selected blood vessels.<br>
<br>
Erwin is the first patient in the United States to receive this treatment. It 
was developed two years ago by Dr. Ulrich Sigwart, chief of Invasive 
Cardiology at the Royal Brompton Hospital in London. Sigwart flew to 
Houston to observe Erwin's treatment on Nov. 14.<br>
<br>
&quot;We hope this treatment will eventually be used instead of open-heart 
surgery, or a pacemaker that corrects the heart's rhythm,&quot; said Sigwart. 
&quot;In England, we have successfully performed the treatment in 30 people, 
ranging in age from 14 years old to 80 years old. It's a nice way to avoid 
major heart surgery.&quot;<br>
<br>
Dr. William Spencer, a cardiologist at Methodist and Baylor College of 
Medicine, performed the procedure on Erwin. He said that not every 
patient with this condition will qualify for the new procedure.<br>
<br>
&quot;It will work only for people whose extra heart tissue is confined to the 
septum,&quot; he said. &quot;And of course, the patient must be showing some 
symptoms.&quot;<br>
<br>
Although doctors have used the procedure in around 100 patients in 
Britain and Germany, Methodist is the only center in the United States 
that can offer it at this time. Patients who receive the treatment in Houston 
will be monitored for at least two and a half years to measure the 
effectiveness of the treatment.<br>
<br>
People who have hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy often have 
very few symptoms. They can quickly become breathless with minimal 
exertion, and could have chest pains or even fainting spells.<br>
<br>
Dr. Robert Roberts, chief of Cardiology at Methodist and Baylor College 
of Medicine, said this condition is most often seen in young athletes. 
&quot;People with this condition make very good athletes, because their heart 
works better than normal,&quot; Roberts said. &quot;But the condition does not 
usually become dangerous until they reach puberty. And it's tough to 
diagnose; often there are no symptoms. Often the first symptom is sudden 
death.&quot;<br>
<br>
Hundreds of young athletes die suddenly each year in the United States. 
Most of them die while playing football, basketball or other physically 
demanding sports. Occasionally a professional player will die suddenly; 
Roberts said the cause is almost always obstructive cardiomyopathy.<br>
<br>
He added that the condition becomes particularly dangerous when an 
athlete allows him or herself to become dehydrated. &quot;That's why more of 
these deaths occur in a sport such as football, and in the Southern region 
of the country,&quot; he said. &quot;Taking in a lot of fluids while playing a sport is 
important for other aspects of health, but for people who do not know 
they have this condition, it could save their lives.&quot;<br>

<tr><td valign=top width=600>Space-age technology has contributed to the development of a 
new-generation heart pump under evaluation at The Methodist Hospital 
and the DeBakey Heart Center at Baylor College of Medicine.<br>
<br>
The NASA/Baylor Axial Flow Ventricular Assist Device (VAD) 
addresses several issues that have emerged from experience with the 
currently available left ventricular assist devices.<br>
<br>
1) Borrowing from the space program's advances in miniaturization, the 
VAD is smaller than other heart pumps. The small size makes the device 
suitable for children as well as adults.<br>
<br>
2) The axial flow pump propels blood in only one direction, eliminating 
the need for inflow and outflow valves. The long-term durability of such 
3) The VAD is noiseless. Other devices, whether electromechanical or 
pneumatic, make very prominent noises.<br>
<br>
4) The VAD requires only six watts of power to operate.<br>
<br>
Despite its small size and minimal energy use, the VAD pumps 10 liters 
of blood per minute, comparable to larger pulsatile devices, says George 
Noon, M.D., a cardiovascular surgeon at Methodist and Baylor.<br>
<br>
The NASA/Baylor pump is in the midst of laboratory evaluation. 
Investigators will assess the pump's long-term performance in animals, 
beginning with one-month trials.</td></tr>

<p><a name="Cholesterol"><font color="#000080"><font size=4><em><strong>Cholesterol</strong></em></font></font></a><font color="#000000"><font size=4> </font></font><br>
The cholesterol in your blood comes from two sources: the foods you eat 
and your liver. <br>
<br>
Cholesterol, and other fats, are transported in your blood stream in the form 
of spherical particles called lipoproteins. <u>The two most commonly known 
lipoproteins are LDL, low-density lipoproteins and HDL, high-density 
lipoproteins.</u> </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a name="LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol"><strong><u>LDL </u></strong><em><u>(low-density lipoprotein</u></em><em><strong><u>)</u></strong></em><strong><u> cholesterol</u></strong></a>, commonly 
called the &#147;bad&#148; cholesterol, is a type of fat in the blood that 
contains the most cholesterol. It can contribute to 
atherosclerosis, the formation of plaque buildup in the 
arteries. <font color="#FF0000"><b><br>
<br>
You want your LDL to be low.</b></font> To help lower it, avoid 
foods high in saturated fat, exercise, lose weight, and stop 
smoking. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><a name="HDL (high-density lipoprotein) cholesterol"><strong><u>HDL </u></strong><em><u>(high-density lipoprotein</u></em><em><strong><u>)</u></strong></em><strong><u> cholesterol</u></strong></a><strong>,</strong> known as the 
&#147;good&#148; cholesterol, is a type of fat in the blood that 
scavenges the &#147;bad&#148; cholesterol and removes it from the 
bloodstream. <font color="#FF0000"><b><br>
<br>
You want your HDL to be as high as possible. </b></font>Some people 
can raise HDL by exercising for at least 20 minutes three 
times a week, kicking the cigarette habit, avoiding saturated 
fat intake, and decreasing body weight. For others, medicine 
may be needed. Because raising HDL is complicated, work 
with your doctor on a therapeutic plan to raise it. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>A <font color="#FF0000"><strong><u>cholesterol screening</u></strong></font> is an overall look at the fats in your blood. While 
screenings help identify people at risk of heart disease, screenings can't 
detect all those at risk. The National Cholesterol Education Program reports 
that it's important to have what's called a<b> </b><font color="#FF0000"><b><u>full lipid profile</u></b></font><b> </b>every five years 
after the age of 20 to show the actual levels of each type of fat in your blood: 
LDL, HDL, triglycerides, and others. </p>
<p><em><u>Healthy Blood Cholesterol Levels</u></em><u> </u><br>
The National Cholesterol Education Program also reports that high blood 
cholesterol is a significant risk factor in heart disease. Lowering blood 
cholesterol through increased physical activity, weight loss, smoking 
cessation, and proper diet lowers that risk. However, the report stresses that 
blood cholesterol is very specific to each individual and for that reason a 
full lipid profile is a important part of your medical history and important 
information for your physician to have. In general, </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="#LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol">LDL</a> - Should be less than 130 milligrams. If you have other 
risk factors, you should try to get the LDL below 100. </p>
<p><a href="#HDL (high-density lipoprotein) cholesterol">HDL</a> - Less than 35 milligrams puts you at higher risk for 
heart disease. </p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><strong>A </strong><strong><u>total</u></strong><strong> cholesterol level below 200 is considered 
desirable.</strong></font> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you <u>do</u> have elevated cholesterol levels, you're not alone. Consider these 
statistics: </p>
<ul>
<li>About 30 percent of Americans have total cholesterol levels between 
200 and 239, which is considered <em>borderline high risk</em>. </li>
<li>More than 25 percent of the adult U.S. population has blood cholesterol 
levels greater than 240, which is considered <em>high risk</em>. </li>
</ul>
<p>&#160; </p>
<p><a name="Triglycerides"><font color="#000080"><font size=4><em><strong>Triglycerides</strong></em></font></font></a><font color="#000000"><font size=4><em><strong> </strong></em></font></font><em><strong><br>
</strong></em>Triglycerides is another class of fat found in the bloodstream. The link 
between triglycerides and heart disease is under clinical investigation, but 
high levels of it are believed to be a significant risk factor. </p>
<p>High triglyceride levels may be caused by medical conditions like diabetes, 
hypothyroidism, kidney disease, or liver disease. Also, certain medicines 
also may raise the levels. The dietary causes of elevated triglyceride levels 
include obesity and high intakes of fat, alcohol, and concentrated sweets. </p>
<ul>
<li>A healthy triglyceride level on your full lipid profile <br>
should be less than 150 milligrams. </li>
</ul>

<li>If you take in fewer calories than you burn, 
you lose weight. </li>
<li>If you balance the two, you maintain your 
weight. </li>
</ul>
<p>Even when you're dieting, however, calories 
shouldn't be cut back so much that your energy 
needs aren't met. The <a href="mformula.htm">number of calories you need 
</a>depends primarily on age, gender and activity 
level. </p>
<p><font color="#000080"><font size=4><strong><u>Dietary Cholesterol</u></strong></font></font> <br>
<img src="images/bacon.gif" align=left hspace=10 width=150 height=66>Dietary cholesterol is a 
fat-like substance found in 
all foods of animal origin: 
egg yolks, meat, poultry, fish, milk and milk 
products. <img src="images/eggs.gif" align=right hspace=0 width=150 height=109> </p>
<p>Because our bodies make 
cholesterol, it is not required 
in our diets. However, 
because most people eat foods 
that contain cholesterol, it's 
important to avoid excessive amounts. The 
amount of cholesterol you consume can affect 
your <a href="mfatsin.htm#Cholesterol">blood cholesterol</a> levels. </p>
<p><a name="Fat "><font color="#000080"><font size=4><strong><u>Fat</u></strong></font><u> </u></font></a><br>
Fat is the most concentrated source of calories, 
supplying more than twice as many calories per 
gram as either carbohydrates or proteins. We tend 
to get far too much fat in their diets, which 
contributes to health problems such as obesity, 
high blood cholesterol, and heart disease. </p>
<p><font color="#000080"><em><strong>Types of Fats:</strong></em></font> <br>
Fatty acids are the basic chemical units in fat. 
They may be <font color="#FF0000"><strong><u>saturated, polyunsaturated, 
monounsaturated, or trans fats</u></strong></font>. These fatty 
acids differ in their chemical compositions and 
structures, and in the way in which they affect 
your blood cholesterol levels. Total fat intake 
should be no more than 30 percent of your daily 
calorie intake. </p>
<p><a name="Saturated"><font color="#FF0000"><em><strong>Saturated</strong></em></font></a> fat is used by the liver to manufacture 
cholesterol. It is considered the most dangerous 
kind of fat because it has been shown to raise 
blood cholesterol levels, particularly the <a href="fatsin.htm#LDL">LDL</a>. 
Saturated fat should comprise no more than 10 
percent of your daily calorie intake. <em>Examples 
include: meats, butter, cocoa butter, coconut 
and palm oils.</em><br>
<br>
<font color="#FF0000"><em><strong>Polyunsaturated</strong></em></font> fats, such as vegetable oils and 
margarines, don't appear to raise blood 
cholesterol levels. <em>Examples include: safflower, 
sunflower, corn, and soybean oils.</em> </p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><em><strong>Monounsaturated</strong></em></font> fats, such as olive oil, don't 
seem to have any affect on blood cholesterol. 
<em>Examples include olive and canola oils.</em> </p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><em><strong>Trans </strong></em></font>fat is a by-product of hydrogenation, a 
chemical process used to change liquid 
unsaturated fat to a more solid fat. Strucurally 
similar to saturated fat, trans fatty acids may have 
a great impact on raising total and LDL 
cholesterol levels. <em>Examples include stick 
margarine and fats found in commercially 
prepared cakes, cookies, and snack foods.</em> </p>
<p><font color="#000080"><font size=4><strong><u>Fiber</u></strong><strong> </strong><em><strong><br>
</strong></em></font></font>Fiber is the indigestible portion of food. There 
are two types of fiber: soluble and insoluble. </p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><em><strong>Soluble</strong></em></font><br>
Soluble fiber, which is found in such foods as oat 
bran and dried beans, can lower blood 
cholesterol in some people. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><img src="images/breads.gif" align=right hspace=0 width=150 height=139></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><font size=3><em><strong>Insoluble</strong></em></font></font><br>
Insoluble fiber, which 
is found in foods such 
as wheat bran, has 
many benefits. While it 
hasn't been found to lower cholesterol, it's useful 
in weight control because it creates a feeling of 
fullness. </p>
<p><font color="#000080"><font size=4><strong><u>Sodium</u></strong></font></font> <br>
Sodium is a mineral needed to maintain body 
fluids and proper nerve function. It occurs 
naturally in some <img src="images/salt_pep.gif" align=left hspace=0 width=145 height=150>foods, but most of the sodium 
in our diets comes from 
seasonings and ingredients we 
add to foods. Although sodium 
is essential, most of us 
consume more than we need. In 
some people, too much sodium 
in the diet can cause blood 
pressure to rise, putting us at risk for heart 
disease or stroke. </p>

<p>Diabetes is a general term for diseases that are characterized by excessive urination. The word 
diabetes is Greek for &quot;passing through&quot; or &quot;siphon.&quot; It may be pronounced DIa-BEE-teeze or 
DIa-BEE-tis. </p>
<p>The most common type of diabetes is <a href="mellitus.htm">diabetes mellitus</a>, which is caused by the inadequate 
production or use of insulin, a hormone secreted by in the pancreas. When you read or hear 
about diabetes, this is the type that is usually being referred to. </p>
<p>A less common kind of diabetes is <a href="insipid.htm">diabetes insipidus</a>, which caused by the inadequate secretion 
of vasopressin by the pituitary gland. There are other categories of diabetes that may be caused 
by damage to organs, medical therapies, illnesses, medications, or genetic defects. </p>
<p>Diabetes, in general, is a chronic and usually incurable disease. With proper medical care, 
clinical therapies, diet, hygiene, and exercise, however, symptoms and complications can be 
successfully treated and managed . </p>

<p><img src="../../icon/heiser.jpg" align=left hspace=20 width=212 height=272>When Jim Heiser was 13, he had the worst Thanksgiving of his 
life. One week before the holiday, he was diagnosed with 
juvenile diabetes and soon realized only he could prevent more 
ruined holidays in the future. Today Heiser, a design/space 
coordinator at Methodist and a <a href="mellitus.htm">Type I diabetic</a>, is training to run 
his first marathon January&#146;s <a href="http://www.chron.com/ads/display/m/methodist_marathon/index.html">Methodist Health Care Houston 
Marathon. </a>But before he can run, he&#146;s got to walk. And he&#146;ll do 
that Sunday, Nov. 3, at the <a href="walk.htm">Walk for the Cure</a> to benefit juvenile 
diabetes research, beginning at 8 a.m. in the Houston Astrodome 
parking lot. </p>
<p>When all those desserts were placed in front of him on that 
long-ago Thanksgiving, Heiser realized for the first time he 
couldn&#146;t eat everything the wanted. &quot;It made me realize right then that I had better listen to the 
doctor&#146;s orders,&quot; he says. &quot;I became careful about taking my insulin and monitoring my blood 
sugar levels every day. In time I knew my limitations and could continue playing sports and 
having desserts as well.&quot; </p>
<p>Diabetes prevents the body from maintaining healthy levels of sugar in the blood due to the lack 
of a chemical called insulin. When insulin is normally produced, it allows sugar to leave the 
bloodstream and enter the body&#146;s cells where it is used for energy. Type I diabetics produce 
very little or no insulin and must take it daily. Type II diabetics make insulin but cannot use it 
well. </p>
<p>&quot;<a href="complic.htm">Diabetes is a very serious condition</a>,&quot; says Dr. Alan Garber, chief of Endocrinology, Diabetes 
and Metabolism at Methodist. Twenty percent of people with diabetes will die or suffer a major 
health problem in the first six years after diagnosis. Diabetes is the <a href="statisti.htm">fourth leading cause of death 
</a>and the second leading cause of heart disease afflicting 14 million people in the United States. 
Garber says approximately half of the Americans who have diabetes do not even know it 
because there are no strong warning signs or symptoms that present themselves in the early 
stages of the disease. </p>
<p>Heiser has lived with diabetes for 23 years. He understands the precautions and limitations that 
exist for him but rarely lets anything stand in his way. When Methodist became the sponsor of 
the <a href="http://www.chron.com/ads/display/m/methodist_marathon/index.html">Houston Marathon</a>, &quot;I knew it was now or never,&quot; he declares. &quot;My doctor and family are 
very supportive and encourage me that I should not let my diabetes be an excuse not to do it.&quot; </p>
<p>For diabetics, exercise offers extra benefits. It lowers blood sugar, makes insulin work better, 
may decrease the amount of insulin needed, reduces stress which can affect blood sugar and can 
contribute to weight loss and lowering of blood pressure. </p>
<p>In training for the marathon, Heiser keeps careful watch on his blood sugar level. He faxes his 
glucose readings to his physician every three weeks. During this period of heavy exercise, the 
doctor offers different ways to regulate and balance his doses of insulin and food intake so as 
not to have a hyperglycemic attack.</p>
<p align=left>&quot;My father-in-law has run a few marathons, so he is helping me train,&quot; says Heiser. &quot;He plans to 
follow me on his bike with the glucose monitor and Power Bars. I plan on stopping at each 10K 
marker to test my levels and see how I&#146;m doing. I certainly don&#146;t expect to come in at first 
place, but to me, just crossing the finish line is winning.&quot; <em><strong>-- Angela McPike</strong></em></p>

<p>The most common form of diabetes, diabetes mellitus, results in inadequate production or use of 
insulin. (Mellitus is a Latin word meaning &quot;honey sweet.&quot; The proper Latin pronunciation is 
&quot;<i>mel-LI-tus&quot;, </i>although some people pronounce it <i>&quot;MELL-i-tus.&quot;</i> Insulin is a hormone produced 
in the pancreas that is essential to the proper metabolism of blood sugar (glucose). Some people 
refer to diabetes mellitus as &quot;juvenile,&quot; or &quot;sugar&quot; diabetes or &quot;the sugar.&quot; Although there is no 
known cure for diabetes mellitus, research and clinical trials are ongoing throughout the country 
searching for ways to treat or cure this mysterious disease. </p>
<p>Diabetes mellitus is a very complex disease composed of different syndromes. A syndrome is a 
group of symptoms and signs that collectively indicate a specific illness or disease. Diabetes 
mellitus is classified into four different types or syndromes. Because diabetes mellitus can have 
complications caused by the many different symptoms and signs, a person with diabetes should

<p>Diabetes insipidus is caused by the inadequate secretion of vasopressin (the antidiuretic 
hormone [ADH]) by the neurohypophysis, the main portion of the posterior lobe of the pituitary 
gland. Without the proper amount of ADH to stimulate the kidneys to absorb water from the 
urine, the body passes large quantities of urine. The most common cause of diabetes insipidus is 
damage to the pituitary gland, however, many cases have no known cause. Occasionally, when 
damage to the pituitary gland heals or is corrected, diabetes insipidus is cured. </p>
<p>Symptoms of diabetes may include some or all of the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>large quantities of colorless urine (30+ pints daily) </li>
<li>excessive thirst </li>
<li>dry skin </li>
<li>weakness </li>

<title>Interview with Dr. Quill</title>
<meta name="GENERATOR" content="Microsoft FrontPage 1.1">

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<p align=center><img src="diabetes/health.gif" align=bottom width=450 height=100></p>
<p align=left>&nbsp;</p>
<p align=center><font color="#0000FF"><font size=4>The Right to Die:</font></font></p>
<p align=center><font color="#0000FF"><font size=4>An Interview with Dr. Timothy Quill</font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>In 1991, a Rochester, N.Y., physician wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine that he prescribed enough pills 
for leukemia patient to kill herself. With that article, Dr. Timothy Quill became the first practicing physician in the 
United States to publicly admit aiding a patient's suicide. </em></p>
<p><em>Now he is the focus of a landmark case currently being decided by the United States Supreme Court. In 1993, Quill 
was interviewed by The Methodist Hospital after the publication of his book Death and Dignity: Making Choices and 
Taking Charge. The following transcript of the interview is provided as a public and educational service by the 
Methodist Health Care System; it is not intended to be an endorsement of any particular view or side of this social 
issue.</em> </p>
<p>Methodist: The first thing I wanted to ask, how has the response to the book been? </p>
<p>Quill: It's been very positive. I think people have found it thought-provoking, and interesting and I think they've found that the 
stories in the book really bring the issues to life. They make it very clear what are some of the issues in, I think, a more 
personal way than they're discussed in other places. </p>
<p>M: You sort of chuckled when you said `thought-provoking.' Who has been the most responsive? Physicians? Patients? Just 
general readers? </p>
<p>Quill: Actually, it's been read by both physicians and people in the ethics community and then many people in the lay 
community, patients and such, have been reading it as well. I think the public is much more aware of this issue and actually 
sophisticated than many people would guess...In many ways, they're struggling with it at the same level that physicians are, to 
some degree... </p>
<p>M: Do you think that the general public is becoming more aware of this issue because of the nature of what's happening in our 
society with the cost of health care? </p>
<p>Quill: No, I actually think it's because end-of-life suffering in some sense or another has really touched so many people's 
lives...I think if you look at how people come down on this issue, if there were one factor that will determine it, is personal 
experience with suffering at the end of life...So it cuts across traditional political lines, liberal, conservative, that kind of 
thing...And it separates more along experiencial lines. </p>
<p>M: So why do a book? Kevorkian is in the headlines again today. Why do a book that maybe won't get as much attention as 
Kevorkian or the Hemlock Society? </p>
<p>Quill: Well, people are really struggling for a coherent way to think about these issues, in my opinion. Kevorkian does not 
present a coherent, thoughtful, sensitive consideration of the issues. He is clearly challenging society in his own unique way. 
People need a way to think about it to make sense of it, to make sense of the fact that--to make meaning out of it, if you will. 
And that's why the book, to try to help people...Because I think I have a coherent way of thinking about these issues. And one 
that makes sense is intuitively appealing, and logical, and that can be presented in a personal way. I think people are very 
hungry for that. Everywhere I've gone to talk about this, people are extremely receptive once they really hear what I'm talking 
about. </p>
<p>M: How many of the people you treated or people who you've encountered have actually thought about it...It seems in you 
book that you focus on physicians and the role they play and how it's hard for them to change the way they think, but how 
many people you confront actually know what they want? </p>
<p>Quill: I would say, that's a complicated question, I'll give you a number of answers. One is that a fair number of people have a 
general idea of what they would want...They really want to be given some choice, some control over what's happening, and I 
think that group is growing. As a different generation is growing up, and also as people really encounter the medical system 
enough you start really striving to get back in control of your life. I see that as a very healthy process. Now, how many people 
really want to take control of their death? Well, I think there are a lot of people who are thinking about it, who want to talk 
about it. Maybe not everybody, but a large number of people who are very seriously ill really want to talk about issues. They 
think about the possibility of taking their lives. Very few will actually act on it. But I think they want to talk about it, and given 
the opportunity many people would talk about it. </p>
<p>M: do you find people change, make a decision and then, I've been so curious about this, will make a decision and sign an 
advance directive and then, right when death is imminent, suddenly they change their minds and feel like they would want to 
live longer with life support? </p>
<p>Quill: Well, I know there are reports of that happening. But my own view is that most of those are because people are asked 
the wrong questions. They're asked, &#147;Do you want to live?' Or, &#147;Do you want us to do everything?&#148; Well, what are the 
opposites? Nobody really wants to die. And the opposite of doing everything in that sense of it, if you're asked that at the 11th 
hour, is to do nothing. Well, nobody wants nothing. That's frightening. So I think people are asked the wrong questions at that 
time, as opposed to, &#147;We'll do everything that makes sense to do,&#148; and &#147;We'll do things to actively keep you comfortable,&#148; 
which is much more to the point. I don't think that many people really, truly change their minds, if you get to an understanding 
of what they're asking for. </p>
<p>M: I get the sense that it is very important to establish a good rapport with a physician, as it is for a physician to talk to his 
patient. But the nature of health care nowadays -- people are in better shape, for example -- doesn't that work against 
establishing a long-term relationship? People just show up when they're sick...And especially, since there are so few general 
practitioners and more specialists, so you don't tend to develop a long-term relationship... </p>
<p>Quill: I think those forces go against this kind of relationship. As we re-vamp the health care system...I think, with disastrous 
consequences, the notion that one could have five doctors, none of whom cares about you as a person or knows you as a 
person, is just a rescription for danger...for overtreatment, for inappropriate treatment, for not putting the whole package 
together...So I think it is something we need to re-vamp in the whole health care system...Now I also want to say, even though 
not everybody has a primary care doctor, a doctor who cares about them, actually there are many, many primary care 
doctors, in fact, internists, family care physicians, they share as a group the values that I outline in the book. And so because 
it's not as widespread as it should be, it's still out there. A lot of people have a doctor. In many communities, if one wants that 
and is willing to do some work to seek it out, it can be found. </p>
<p>M: Who is key to change? It is physicians? Patients? The Government? </p>
<p>Quill: now are you talking about in this narrow area of assisted dying or are you talking about in primary care? </p>
<p>M: Well, let's start in the narrow area. </p>
<p>Quill: In the narrow area, I don't think that change is going to come from physicians because they're afraid. They're afraid of 
being reviewed, you know, of being accused of all kinds of things, assisting in a death, I think that change is gonna come, if it is 
gonna come, from patients and the public. And the public has expressed a clear desire for some change in this area, although 
the form that's going to take, there is no consensus at this point. </p>
<p>M: Is that sort of a naive statement? Aren't you placing a lot of faith in the American public? </p>
<p>Quill: (Chuckle) I have some faith in the American public, maybe more than many people do. You look at the initiatives in 
California and Washington state, and you see that the majority of the public was in favor of some legislation but when they 
actually analyzed the legislation it was voted down narrowly. And I think that was probably a good move, because the 
legislation was imprecisely drawn. But I do think if legislation is put forth in those states and perhaps some others, that is 
precisely drawn, it has a reasonable chance of passing. </p>
<p>M: Do you think change will ver come around if it's driven by the public to where medical students, will be given some kind of 
curriculum course and tested, as you said in your book, about how to confront patients and how to communicate with them? </p>
<p>Quill: Oh, I think that's happening right now..That change is in process, it clearly needs to be accelerated...But yeah, we -- 
meaning the public -- pay in some sense for medical education. What we need to demand...that's not controversial, that's 
standard of care. We are graduating students and residents who don't know how to do basic palliative care. That's just not 
right. That must change. I think it probably will change, with all the health care systems that are in flux, if we don't see, for 
example, hospice care reimbursed in hospitals...if we don't see more emphasis in primary care, then that change will be slow in 
coming. </p>
<p>M: Reading your book, I get a sense that you are the kind of doctor who is very close to your patients no matter what their 
problem. Is that a hazard, personally? </p>
<p>Quill: I don't know that it's...I suppose it could be a hard, but I don't see it as that. I don't think I could take care of...When I 
was a hospice consultant, I really functioned as a consultant, I don't think I could care for 30 or 40 dying patients myself, in 
that close intense way that I describe in the book. But I can care for a small number in that way. Which is usually the way it is 
in my primary care practice. So I think I probably get as much out of those kinds of relationships as I put into them. So I don't 
see it as being hazardous. But it does require perhaps more openness, more conversation with colleagues, with other people, 
when you get into areas that you don't really know what to do, or when you start to feel something you don't really know what 
it's about. </p>
<p>M: And again, I guess the current climate where we sort of want to turn health care back into a commerce transaction, I guess 
that would work against that sort of... </p>
<p>Quill: totally. That's a disaster if we do that. If we don't...A primary health care system, and I'm extremely pleased they're at 
least talking in those terms, as they talk about re-doing the health care system...And reinforcing people to become general 
doctors, instead of more cardiologists or surgeons, which we clearly don't need. </p>
<p>M: I have a question, and it might seem real naive from a lay person's point of view, but it seems to me that if you were a 
physician and you were choosing a certain specialty like oncology or renal care, that you would assume that your role 
automatically embraces that kind of communication process with your patient, or you would be confronting death issues more 
than say, an OB/GYN, maybe... </p>
<p>Quill: I would say that (chuckle), one would think that. And there are some absolutely wonderful people in most communities in 
each of those fields. There are also those who go into oncology, for example, to fight death to the last drop. That's what 
motivates them, and I think that's what drives some of the other things we see, like people being treated to the last straw when 
they're clearly dying. We clearly want more balance. That's a training issue as well. I think if you're going into oncology, you 
need some training in death and dying, because you're going to see it. Same thing with kidney, if you're going to be a dialysis 
person. We know that 10 percent of people on dialysis eventually decide to stop. We have to be able to have that 
conversation to give people the option or to allow them to talk about it. </p>
<p>M: You talk a lot about your patient Diane and how with acute leukemia there's a 25 percent success rate. What about if the 
success standards are higher, the survival rate is say 50 percent? Where is there a line, if the patient says...If you present to the 
patient that there's a 75 percent chance of survival, to get there the patient chooses not to go through that amount of suffering. 
Is there some kind of limit that you draw, or how do you set boundaries? </p>
<p>Quill: That particular is a settled one ethically, and legally. That is that a person has the right to make decisions about what they 
do to themselves. It's a basic ethical principle, and people can say no, even if it's a 100 percent sure they would survive with 
treatment, and 1-- percent sure they would die without treatment. It doesn't mean that this decision is unchallenged, or that we 
don't make sure they really know what they are getting into or giving up. But people have the right to make those choices. 
That's a settled issue ethically right now. Again, I think when someone first raises something they don't want treatment, let's say 
they had a 75 percent success rate, one wouldn't just accept that at face value. You would really want to explore that, 
understand it, challenge it. But ultimately, it's the patient's decision, they're the ones who will have to experience whatever 
happens. </p>
<p>M: Do you think that realistically, these decisions, once they're a little more accepted, that these decisions may tend to go into 
the hands of family members, or ethics committees, groups of doctors, governments? Is there a danger of that? </p>
<p>Quill: I would not want...I actually think that the ideal group to do this would be the patient, the family, and the 
doctor...Probably with some external consultant to make sure that everything's been considered. But I think if you start getting 
a huge bureaucracy involved in individual decisions, that just doesn't work. </p>
<p>M: Could that happen? Is that really... </p>
<p>Quill: that could happen. Yeah. If they have, for example, if they say, &#147;Well, we're going to allow this but there has to be 
consultation with an ethics committee, for example, before you can do it.&#148; I think it's just plain unrealistic, these committees are 
not used t functioning in that way. And what does it mean to get a consult with them? Does it mean that everybody on the 
committee's going to see this terrible ill suffering person? It's just...unworkable. Now you can have an ethics committee review 
these decisions and make sure all the criteria is set out and have been met, providing they can do that in a timely way. They can 
review the paperwork supporting it in some sense, or the documentation supporting it. That might be a legitimate thing to ask 
of them. </p>
<p>M: Now is this book, Dr. quill, your ultimate statement on the subject? Are you going to get involved in any sort of political 
action, maybe? </p>
<p>Quill: No, I don't think it's the ultimate...I think you could look at it as a work in progress. I'll still do more writing on the topic. 
And I will become involved in different ways in this process. </p>
<p>M: Why did you feel compelled to write about Diane, originally? </p>
<p>Quill: A couple of things were happening at that point in time. I felt compelled to write about it because it was a remarkable 
experience and I tend to, if you look at the other things I write about, I tend to write about the things that affect me personally, 
strongly. That's one of the ways I do research if you will. Why I chose to publish it, was because I really felt the medical 
discussion on this topic was so abstract and impersonal that it was not addressing the reality that patients and their families and 
doctors are facing. I thought that we needed a more personal expression of that, so that people...was as if the problem didn't 
exist. If only we had comfort care better, it didn't exist. If only doctors did a better job, it wouldn't exist and I know that's not 
true. I really felt we needed something more personal to talk about and I think the climate was ready for a story like that. </p>
<p>M: In the subsequent backlash, did you ever regret publishing the story? </p>
<p>Quill: No, I don't think so. There were some adverse consequences, but most of the consequences were very positive. Most 
people were very supportive of me, and of the story, and of the need for discussion. And even though there was some 
backlash I had to go through a process...Now if I had had to go to a trial, more than a grand jury, I probably would have had 
some real serious second thoughts because that's such a public process. </p>
<p>M: So out of the book, what do you hope to come out of it? </p>
<p>Quill: I would say several things. I want people to think more deeply about this issue. If people read the book and they 
complete advance directives, that's terrific, as far as I'm concerned. If they have more empathy and understand of the struggle 
that patients and their families go through, that's a good outcome. If they will be more assertive on their own behalf, with 
doctors, with systems, that will be a good outcome. And I think if people get more politically active in all aspects of the health 
care system, I think that's a good outcome. And if it contributes to this debate, which I think it will, so that it occurs at a deeper 
level, that would be a good outcome. Now what the changes are in public policy that we need, I'm still not completely sure 
about that. There are...I think there's a risk and benefit on both sides. I'm quite clear that the kind of laws that are being 
enacted in Michigan don't address the right issues. </p>
<p>M: We're going to have to make a few mistakes before we get it right... </p>
<p>Quill: Sure. </p>

<p>Seasonal Affective Disorder, or SAD, is mood disorder characterized by mental depression 
related to a certain season of the year - especially winter. <img src="images/winterc.gif" align=right hspace=10 width=150 height=43>Onset usually occurs during 
adulthood, and it is four times more likely to happen to women. 
Approximately 11 million people are diagnosed with this disorder, which 
is incorrectly sometimes called &quot;winter blues.&quot; </p>
<p>SAD is a clinical diagnosis accepted in the medical community. <a href="http://infonet.welch.jhu.edu/departments/drada/articles/articl10.htm">Dr. Norman E. Rosenthal</a>, 
Chief of Environmental Psychiatry Branch of the National Institute of Mental Health is the 
researcher credited with discovering SAD.</p>
<p>Symptoms include: </p>
<ul>
<li>daytime drowsiness </li>
<li>fatigue, or low energy level </li>
<li>decreased sex drive </li>
<li>diminished concentration </li>
<li>difficulty thinking clearly </li>
<li>tendency to overeat sweets and carbohydrates causing weight gain </li>
</ul>
<p><img src="images/symb571.gif" align=bottom width=150 height=99>Decreased sunlight is thought to be part of cause of SAD, and is under 
clinical investigation. One treatment for SAD, which seems to improve the symptoms, is 
exposure to bright light, especially in the morning. </p>

        <p>Holidays are supposed to be a joyful time of good
        cheer and optimistic hopes. Yet, it is not unusual for
        many of us to feel sad or lonely during the holiday
        period -- a condition that has come to be called <font
        color="#000080"><em><strong>holiday blues</strong></em></font>
        or <font color="#000080"><em><strong>holiday depression</strong></em></font>. </p>
        <p>Holiday depression may occur at any holiday or
        vacation time, but most commonly happens during the <font
        color="#000000">December holidays</font> when, it may
        seem, just about everyone in the world is celebrating in
        some way. There are many <a href="causes.htm">causes for
        holiday blues</a>, and the <a href="symptoms.htm">symptoms</a>
        may mimic clinical depression. <img
        src="images/cane012.gif" align="right" hspace="2"
        vspace="2" width="97" height="150"> </p>
        <p>While they may be intense and unsettling, holiday
        blues are usually short-lived, lasting for a few days to
        a few weeks prior to or just after the holiday. The good
        news is, <font color="#000000">holiday blues usually
        subside after the holiday season is over</font> and daily
        routines are resumed. </p>
        <p>There is a long list of recommended <a
        href="dodont.htm">Dos and Don'ts</a> for managing your
        holiday blues. The most important things to remember are:
        it's a normal response to a stress-filled time of the
        year, and you don't have to suffer unnecessarily. Find
        someone to talk with who can help you through this
        difficult time -- a family member, friend, member of the
        clergy, or <a href="../diabetes/teleserve.htm">a physician or
        professional counselor</a>. </p>
        <p>Holiday blues, although serious, should not be
        confused with another condition called <a href="sad.htm">Seasonal
        Affective Disorder</a>, which is a clinically diagnosed
        mood disorder that usually occurs during the winter
        months. </p>

        <p><font size="3"><img src="images/xmas018.gif"
        align="bottom" width="150" height="103">Lisa Timmons did
        not look forward to the upcoming holiday season like she
        has in the past. </font></p>
        <p><font size="3">For as long as Lisa can remember,
        holidays usually included a trip to her father's home
        town and boyhood home, affectionately called &#147;the
        homeplace.&#148; But this year, and many like it, will be
        different. They will not include her dad. </font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Lisa's father Bill, died suddenly of a
        heart attack in May 1995. He was 64 years old and left
        behind a close family and group of friends who, for the
        first time, had to face a normally joyous time of year
        without him. </font></p>
        <p><font size="3">&#147;Daddy was like a kid during the
        holidays,&#148; says Timmons, 31, the middle daughter of
        three in the Timmons family. &#147;He loved going home so
        much that we decided to continue the tradition even
        though we knew it would be difficult. It turned out to be
        the right thing to do for us and was very
        comforting.&#148; </font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Surrounded by glittering reminders in
        what is a time of celebration, many people find
        themselves longing for a loved one who died -- perhaps
        recently or even many years ago. </font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Others may know someone who is reliving
        the grief of losing someone during the holiday season and
        want desperately to say and do the &#147;right
        thing.&#148; </font></p>
        <p><font size="3">&#147;There are no pat answers,&#148;
        admits Bob Kidd, a senior staff chaplain at The Methodist
        Hospital in Houston. Especially in the first holiday
        season after a loved one dies, he says, &#147; It's
        important to acknowledge that this is going to be a
        different year; don't try to wallpaper over the
        sadness.&#148; </font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Kidd also advises those who are
        searching for the right thing to say that &#147;if you're
        honest in your expressions of concern, people will
        recognize and appreciate that authenticity.&#148; </font></p>
        <p><font size="3">&#147;Now that we have gone through the
        first year of holidays without daddy, I think it will get
        easier,&#148; says Timmons. &#147;It was probably hardest
        for my mother but thoughtful friends and family made it
        much easier. People made a point of extending invitations
        and including her in all of the traditional festivities
        she and my father always enjoyed together.&#148; </font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Marlo Peterson, chaplain supervisor at
        Methodist, adds that it's important to scale down
        expectations of what the holidays <i>should</i> be like.
        And when you are around people, choose to be around those
        who will lift your spirits. </font></p>
        <p><font size="3"><img src="images/steeple.gif"
        align="bottom" width="66" height="150">Peterson suggests
        church as one place to be around people--and to get back
        in touch with the true meaning of the season.
        &#147;Church can put you in a frame of mind of service to
        others, and also points to something bigger than
        us,&#148; he says. </font></p>
        <p><font size="3">For those who want to help someone
        going through a time of grief, he has a simple
        suggestion. &#147;Call them! If someone is lonely or sad
        during the holidays, your presence is the most wonderful
        gift of all.&#148; </font></p>
        <p><font size="3">After Christmas is over, the new year
        presents an almost innate tendency to think about the
        year that's ending--and perhaps resurface those feelings
        of loss. Again, it's important to allow yourself to be
        sad, but concentrate on keeping a positive perspective,
        Kidd says. </font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Peterson agrees, but points out that
        the new year can be perceived as a time of new
        beginnings. While New Year's resolutions are made by many
        and achieved by few, the tradition is a valid one, he
        says, and can provide people an opportunity to assess
        their lives and start to make changes. </font></p>

        <p><font size="3">&#147;Remember the 'Good Old Days' are
        happening right now,&#148; Peterson adds. &#147;Ask
        yourself what you can do to have the kind of experience
        that you'll look back on with joy and satisfaction.&#148; </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3">&#147;My twin nieces still

        they are old enough to remember him,&#148; says Timmons.
        &#147;He enjoyed their excitement during the holidays so
        much that we will continue our family traditions and
        festivities. It's what dad would have wanted.&#148; <br>

<P>
May 20, 1996<P>  
Greetings,<P>  
As Secretary-General of the Model United Nations of the University of
Chicago, it is my pleasure to welcome you to the MUNUC World Wide Web  
homepage.  For those of you unfamiliar with our program, the Model   
United Nations of the University of Chicago is one of the premier high  
school MUN conferences in the world.  Our next conference, scheduled for  
<font color="#DD12G3"><STRONG>February 6-9, 1997</STRONG></font>, will 
once again 
bring over 1,800 high 
school students  
from across North America to Chicago in order to simulate 17 United  
Nations committees and other world bodies.<P>    

Actually, this page is only part of a much larger venture by MUNUC that 
will eventually revolutionize the way that our conference is run. 
Originally, 
we were rather hesitant about making those changes.  There was a 
considerable amount of doubt on our part as to the real world utility 
of this sort of system versus the amount of time required to produce and 
maintain it.  In addition, we were extremely concerned about any 
disadvantage that this system could possibly create for schools 
that do not have access to the Internet.  However, over the course of the 
past year, we have become convinced that this sort of venture holds 
great promise for not only improving our administrative functions but 
also enhancing the educational experience of all of our delegates.<P>  

During the coming year, this page will be gradually enlarged.   
Eventually, it should all but eliminate the need for participating  
schools to communicate with MUNUC via the U.S. mail,  should they choose 
to do so.  In addition, this new system should not only increase speed at 
which our committee staffs can communicate with individual delegates, but  
should open up whole new opportunities for research.  Finally, this  
on-line system will also allow MUNUC to make its publications  
(Background Books, Updates, Rules, etc.)  available significantly earlier  
than in previous years.  <P>  

It is our hope that you will find this page useful and informative.   
Please take the time before you go to leave us a few 
<A HREF="/munuc/suggest.html">comments</A> on what you  
think of it.  They are greatly appreciated.  <P>   

Massimo Capretta,<br>
Secretary General<br>

1997"></h1>

<IMG SRC="http://lpd.uchicago.edu/icons/Lines/bluebar.gif"><p>

For decades, the world's high school and college students have been the 
beneficiaries of a unique education in politics, diplomacy, and foreign 
affairs.  The experience of Model United Nations conferences, in which 
participants represent their assigned country's position in various 
committees and work towards writing resolutions to address debated 
topics, brings to life the problems that face the real world.<P>

Among the newest conferences in the country, the <strong>Model 
United Nations of the University of Chicago (MUNUC)</strong> 
has become one of the premier high 
school United Nations simulations in the country.  Only in its ninth 
year, MUNUC has already received considerable national praise for its 
professionalism.  Since its founding in 1988, MUNUC's purpose has 
been the following:<P>

<LI>to educate high school students in the arts of debate, negotiation, 
and public speaking by providing a forum in which they can hone their skills; 
<LI>to introduce high school students to the fascinating realities and 
complexities of international relations through simulations of 
international organizations; 
<LI>to demonstrate the potential of the <a href="http://www.un.org">United 
Nations</a> to 
resolve international problems while showing its limitations.</LI><P>

Although demanding on its staff and high school participants, 
MUNUC continues to be a thoroughly enjoyable and constructive experience 
for all involved.  For our part, the contribution we make to the education 
of the world's high school students is a reward in itself.  We cordially
 invite you to join the MUNUC experience.<P>

<IMG SRC="http://lpd.uchicago.edu/icons/Lines/bluebar.gif"><p>

MUNUC prides itself in providing unique services for participants at its 
conference.  A large <B>computer room</B> is maintained for composing 
and printing resolutions and amendments.  <B>Information Services</B> 
acts as a reference department in which students can look up last-minute
 facts to support their debating points and receive guidance on their 
country's positions.  In addition, MUNUC publishes a conference 
newspaper, <b>The Phoenix</b>, every day of the simulation.  
<b>The Phoenix</b> includes articles on late-breaking news from around
 the globe as well as information on the proceedings of the various 
committees.<P>
Before the conference, the MUNUC staff provides 
participating
schools with preparatory materials and guidance.  Those schools requiring 
assistance in establishing Model United Nations teams will be provided 
with advice and information to begin their programs.  Furthermore, MUNUC 
will attempt to accommodate those schools requesting personal visits.  
All schools participating in the conference will be supplied with our 
updated <a href="/munuc/info/guide.html">Guide to Delegate 
Preparation</a> to assist them in their 
pre-conference planning.  In addition, MUNUC publishes and distributes, 
to all participating schools, detailed background papers introducing 
the topics to be discussed at the forthcoming conference.  Moreover,
two weeks before conference all schools will receive updates which 
offer further information on the committee topics.<P>

<IMG SRC="http://lpd.uchicago.edu/icons/Lines/bluebar.gif"><p>
All MUNUC staff members are <a href="http://www.uchicago.edu">University 
of Chicago</a> students who volunteer 
their time and energy.  They hail from undergraduate, graduate, and 
professional schools and are pursuing degrees in mathematics, 
physics, sociology, economics, international relations, law, philosophy, 
political science,  and many other fields.  Their expertise in such a 
broad range of  disciplines brings a great deal of realism to many of the 
specialized  committees simulated at MUNUC.  While MUNUC is now beginning 
its eighth year, the University of Chicago is in its second century.</h3>

Your arrival at the <a href="/munuc/Palmer.html">Palmer House Hilton</a> 
on Thursday February 6, 1997 
brings you to the oldest continuously operating hotel in the United 
States.  MUNUC participants never cease to be impressed by the luxurious 
accommodations provided by the Palmer House Hilton.<p>

Friday morning of the conference has been left free for you to explore
 all that <a href="http://www.go-explore.com/GetCategories?stateList=...Chicago">Chicago</a> has to offer.  Known as the "Windy City", "The City 
of Broad Shoulders", and "The City that Works", <a href = "http://www.chiweb.com/">Chicago</a> is truly one

<P>

<li><b>January 8, 1997</b> - Hope you all had a wonderful break.  Our 
committee staff will be publishing updates to all topic areas.  Expect 
these updates to be on the web by the 13th if not earlier...<p>


<li><b>December 18, 1996</b> - Advisors: If you want to email position 
papers to MUNUC, please email them to <a 
href="mailto:admin@synergy.uchicago.edu">admin@synergy.uchicago.edu</a>.<P>  
Please do not mail individual position papers to the chairs because the 
administration staff keeps a record of all position papers submitted 
to MUNUC.<P>

<li><b>December 8, 1996</b> - The deadline for submitting Palmer House 
reservations through the MUNUC server has passed.  Please direct 
further reservation requests/corrections to the Palmer House.<P>


<li><b>November 22, 1996</b> - The administrative staff mailed appendices 
to all schools downloading background books.  Security Council will have a 
third topic, and this background paper is downloadable in the same manner 
as the other papers.<P>

<P>

<li><b>November 16, 1996</b> - The appendices for the committees have 
finally been scanned and placed on line.  Depending on the resolution of 
your monitor, you may or may not be able to read them.  However, when you 
print out the resolutions, they will be legible and clear.  Sorry about 
the inconvenience.<P>

<li><b>November 14. 1996</b> - The Rules for each committee are located 
on each of the committee pages.  We're finally located a quality 
scanner which will read in the appendices.  Expect the appendices to be 
online this weekend.<P> 

<li><b>November 9, 1996</b> - Due to our archaic method of publishing 
background books, we have encountered technological difficulties in 
converting
our background books onto the web by the date 
promised by our Secretary General.  
The Technology Staff is working diligently to scan in all the background 
material and to bring all the appendices online.<P>

The Secretary General offers his sincere apologies for promising that the 
background books would be available to schools sooner than by mail and 
for your delay in getting your hands on the background papers.  He 
did not foresee the amount of time to convert our books into files for 
the web.<P>

To remedy this problem, the administrative staff will fax copies of our 
appendices upon request until all the appendices are online.  Email <a 
href="mailto:admin@synergy.uchicago.edu">admin@synergy.uchicago.edu</a> 
with the subject heading: <i>Fax Appendices</i> and your school name/fax 
number/request for a specific appendix in the body of the message.  If 
you would rather receive the appendices by mail, please indicate that 
within your email.<p>

<a name="background"></a>
<li><b>November 5, 1996</b> - Background books are available 
individually on each of the individual committee sections and in Macintosh 
Microsoft Word 5.1 format, which can be read by Windows Microsoft Word and 
Windows Microsft Works.  <P>

Additional formats will be forthcoming, as well as the appendices to 
these books.<P>

The Country Assignment sheet is available on the same page as the rest of 
the forms which need to be filled out.<p>

Before you can read these Macintosh Word 5.1 files, you need stuffit 
expander to uncompress these files:<br>

<Center><FONT size=+4>Frequently Asked Questions</font></center>
<hr>

<B>1) How and when will I download materials from your machine?<p></b>

Background materials will be available in November.  These materials will 
be available on-line approximately when the background materials 
are distributed to the various delegations.<p>

The background material will be available on the committee pages in 
their respective sections.  You can either view the topic papers with your 
current web browser, or you can download the background materials from  
our server.  <P>

We will have the downloadable materials available in a 
variety of word processing formats.  <p>

These files will be available in compressed and 
uncompressed forms.  To view the compressed files, you will need 
software to uncompress the files, which we will make available to you.  

Once your files are uncompressed, you can view these files using your word 
processor.<p>

<b> 2) Do I send the delegation fees with the application?<p></b>

Please do not send any cash with your application.  The Administration 
staff will send you notices requesting fees.<p>

<b>3) I noticed that some sections of your web page require a password.  
When and how can I obtain this password?</b><p>

As of October 3, this information has been distributed to all delegations 
which have been accepted to our conference.  If you have problems using 
your passwords, please direct them to <a  
href="mailto:webmaster@synergy.uchicago.edu">
webmaster@synergy.uchicago.edu</a>.  We will remedy the situation as soon 
as possible.<p>

<b>4) When are you going to add links to help delegates with their 
reserach?</b><P>

If you're interested in finding out more sites about a specific committee 
or a specific topic, the best way to address this issue would be to 
contact the chair/president of the committee by email.  The email 
addresses of each of our chairs/presidents are located on the committee 
pages.<P>

<B>5) Will you post a list of what schools are attending and 
their assigned country?</b><P>

No, we will not post a list of what schools are attending and their 
assigned country.  This information will be provided to you at 
conference in the delegate handbook.<P> 

<b>6) Do I send all my fees by October 25, 1996?</b><P>

No, please send only your delegation fees.  <p>

<b>7) Do i have to pay delegate fees for advisors?</b><P>

No.<P>

<b>8) Do i have to assign at least one person in each committee that i 
have been allocated?</b><P>

<P>
27 October 1996<p>

Dear Delegates,<p>
	
	I am pleased to welcome you to the General Assembly Committees of 
MUNUC IX.  My name is Roby Khemani, and I will serve as the Undersecretary 
General for the General Assembly and Security Council for this years 
conference.  I  am a third year student in the college, majoring in 
statistics.  My ultimate goal is to get a masters degree in biostatistics 
and genetics, go to medical school, and eventually do research in human 
genetics.  I have been involved with  MUNUC as a delegate in high school, 
and in previous years I have been  on staff as a moderator and a chairman.  
<p>
	The General Assembly has always served as the premier discussion 
ground for global issues in the United Nations, for it is the only set of 
committees in which all member states are represented.  The Security 
Council, the United Nations' most treasured institution, consists of five 
permanent members and fifteen rotating members, and serves as the UN's 
chief committee to deal with emergency situations.  This year at MUNUC, we 
will be simulating the SC along with five General Assembly Committees: the 
GA Plenary, the Special Political and Decolonization Committee, the 
Disarmament Committee, the Legal Committee, and the Economic and Financial 
Committee.  I am confident that this broad range of committees, along with 
the unique topics which each of the committee chairmen have selected, will 
provide delegates with many options in making their committee choices.  
<p>
	As always we have an extremely hard working staff who has slaved 
endless hours over the summer and early fall of this year to prepare for 
Conference.  In an attempt to make your preparation as delegates easier, 
we have tried to create a comprehensive homepage on the world wide web, 
allowing you to have access to important research resources, along with 
giving you the option to contact staff easily.   I am confident that if 
you have access to the world wide web, you will take advantage of these 
resources.<p>
	To this end, it is imperative that you research your topic areas 
comprehensively before conference.  This research will not only improve 
the quality of your experience at conference, but it will make writing 
your position papers much easier.   As I am certain you have been 
instructed elsewhere, position papers must be <b>postmarked no later than 
December 20, 1996.</b>  At past MUNUC conferences, there has been a 
tendency 
for delegates not to take the position papers as seriously as they should.  
The reason we ask students to write these papers is so that they can gain 
a better understanding of the particular policies of their assigned 
countries.  A good position paper will be between 1-2 single-spaced typed 
pages per topic area, and will give a short description of the policies 
and goals of your assigned country on that particular topic.   <p>
	With that said, I wish you luck with  your school year, and hope 
your preparation for conference is enjoyable.  Please feel free to contact 
me if you have any questions about any of the General Assembly committees 
or the Security Council.  I look forward to hearing from you and seeing 
you at conference.  <p>


 Sincerely,<p>


Roby Khemani<br>
USGC-General Assembly<br>

<P>

<li><b>January 8, 1997</b> - Hope you all had a wonderful break.  Our 
committee staff will be publishing updates to all topic areas.  Expect 
these updates to be on the web by the 13th if not earlier...<p>


<li><b>December 18, 1996</b> - Advisors: If you want to email position 
papers to MUNUC, please email them to <a 
href="mailto:admin@synergy.uchicago.edu">admin@synergy.uchicago.edu</a>.<P>  
Please do not mail individual position papers to the chairs because the 
administration staff keeps a record of all position papers submitted 
to MUNUC.<P>

<li><b>December 8, 1996</b> - The deadline for submitting Palmer House 
reservations through the MUNUC server has passed.  Please direct 
further reservation requests/corrections to the Palmer House.<P>

<P>

<li><b>November 16, 1996</b> - The appendices for the committees have 
finally been scanned and placed on line.  Depending on the resolution of 
your monitor, you may or may not be able to read them.  However, when you 
print out the resolutions, they will be legible and clear.  Sorry about 
the inconvenience.<P>

<li><b>November 14. 1996</b> - The Rules for each committee are located 
on each of the committee pages.  We're finally located a quality 
scanner which will read in the appendices.  Expect the appendices to be 
online this weekend.<P> 

<li><b>November 9, 1996</b> - Due to our archaic method of publishing 
background books, we have encountered technological difficulties in 
converting
our background books onto the web by the date 
promised by our Secretary General.  
The Technology Staff is working diligently to scan in all the background 
material and to bring all the appendices online.<P>

The Secretary General offers his sincere apologies for promising that the 
background books would be available to schools sooner than by mail and 
for your delay in getting your hands on the background papers.  He 
did not foresee the amount of time to convert our books into files for 
the web.<P>

To remedy this problem, the administrative staff will fax copies of our 
appendices upon request until all the appendices are online.  Email <a 
href="mailto:admin@synergy.uchicago.edu">admin@synergy.uchicago.edu</a> 
with the subject heading: <i>Fax Appendices</i> and your school name/fax 
number/request for a specific appendix in the body of the message.  If 
you would rather receive the appendices by mail, please indicate that 
within your email.<p>

individually on each of the individual committee sections and in Macintosh 
Microsoft Word 5.1 format, which can be read by Windows Microsoft Word and

<h3>General Links</h3>
These site may generally help you prepare for the conference by helping 
you find out about your country's situation or policy, or just what's 
going on in the news.<P>

<B>CNN Interactive</b>	<a 
href="http://www.cnn.com">http://www.cnn.com</a><P>
<blockquote>
	From the people who brought you CNN, Headline News, CNNfn, the 
airport network, etc., this is the web page.  It's always up to date, and 
very complete.  Look for the special "Faces of Conflict" section which 
details ethnic conflicts and internal strife around the world.  Some of 
the conflicts have been impacted by mine use.  Also, look for pictures and 
biographies of your favorite CNN personalities (I like the weather guy 
whose name is Flip Spiceland)<P>
</blockquote>
<B>MSNBC</b>	<a href="http://www.msnbc.com">http://www.msnbc.com</a>
<blockquote>
	This is a lot like CNN, only with more multimedia stuff, a slicker 
interface, and Bill Gates pulling the strings instead of Ted Turner.  
Bottom line, same stuff, more glitz. <P>
</blockquote>
<B>Jane's</b>	<a 
href="http://www.thomson.com/janes/default.html"> 
http://www.thomson.com/janes/default.html</a><P>
<blockquote>
	OK, this is the definitive source for international defense news.  
If you can get your hands on a copy of Jane's , then you are going to be 
in good shape for conference.  Unfortunately, everything with the name 
Jane’s on it costs lots of money, and the web site doesn’t have much in 
the way of articles.  That’s a bit disappointing, but at least you’ll be 
able to see a bit of what’s going on around the world of defense 
industries.<P>
</blockquote>
<B>The Economist</b>	<a 
href="http://www.economist.com">http://www.economist.com</a><P>
<blockquote>
	In my opinion, this is the best weekly news publication around.  
It’s coverage of world news events dwarfs any US publication.  You can get 
this magazine at most any newsstand (and I recommend that you do), but the 
most important articles are posted weekly on this site.<P>
</blockquote>
<B>The New York Times</b>	<a 
href="http://www.nytimes.com">http://www.nytimes.com</a><P>
<blockquote>
	What can I say.  This is the premier newspaper in the country.  
Almost all of it is on the web, and it’s free.  You have to register, but 
it's worth it.<P>
</blockquote>
<B>Christian Science Monitor</b>	<a 
href="http://www.csmonitor.com"> http://www.csmonitor.com</a><P>
<blockquote>
	Again, pretty straight forward.   A good daily newspaper.<P>

<h3>Links for Topic A: Anti-Personnel Land Mines</h3>

This is a list of some of the various World Wide Web sites that I have
found on the issue of land mines.  Many are advocacy and lobbying
groups, so be a bit wary of objectivity.<p>

<b>Ban Land Mines Project</b> - <a
href="http://www.web.apc.org/~pgs/pages/ldmn0.html">
http://web.apc.org/~pgs/pages/ldmn0.html</a><p>

<blockquote>

This is an advocacy group, I think a Canadian one, which seeks a complete
ban on production, use, export, etc.  It has about 10 links, some of
which are a bit superficial.  There seems to be pretty good information
on the past conferences on the subject
in Vienna and Geneva.  Read about how the Dalai Lama supports a ban on 
mines.
</blockquote>

<b>Humanitarian Foundation of People Against Land Mines</b> -
<a
href="http://www.dsk.de/mgm/indexe.htm">http://www.dsk.de/mgm/indexe.htm</a>

<blockquote>This page is based in Germany, and it gives you a choice
of
English or German, which seemed strange to me at first, but this is byfar 
the best site I have found so far.  It is an advocacy group which was
started in January of 1996, but their web site is
 easy to get around and already has large amount of information.  They
include some well-written justifications for their positions and methods,
but the best part of this site is the links to related sites and its
comprehensive nature.  By far the best on the subject. </blockquote>

<b>United Nations Demining Database</b> - <a
href="http://www.un.org/Depts/Landmine">http://www.un.org/Depts/Landmine</a>

<blockquote>I thought that this would have more information than it does.
It
is mainly about the operations the UN sends along with and after its
peacekeepers to clear away mines.  It has data on their operations to
date, but the main interest is the "Country Reports" for nations like El
Salvador, Mozambique, Afghanistan, Yemen, etc., on the scope of the
problem with mines in those countries.  It seems to me to be a pretty
good indication of the limited role that the UN has taken to this
point.</blockquote>

<b>Minerats</b> - <a
href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/documents/minerats/index.html">
http://www.fourmilab.ch/documents/minerats/index.html</a><P>

<blockquote>This is a site for some lab which makes robots which clear
minefields, so it doesn't have very much on the strategic/tactical
situation.  It does, however, have a pretty extensive section on the
technical aspects of many of the mines which are used commonly today.
This has lots of graphics of mines, so you may want to skip it unless
you have a fast connection.</blockquote>

<b>United Nations Conference on Disarmament</b> - <a
href="http://www.unog.ch">http://www.unog.ch</a><p>

<blockquote>This is a UN body in Geneva, which has headed up the past UN
conferences on land mines.  It is also the site for  the UN Conference on
Disarmament.  It is important mainly as it is a UN body,  and thus has UN
documents on it, in their pure, unadulterated forms.  I found here a copy
of the Secretary-General's report on the
moratorium on land mine use, a GA document.</blockquote>

<b>UNICEF</b> - <a
href="http://www.unicef.org">http://www.unicef.org</a><p>

<blockquote>This page has some of the details on the UNICEF Anti-war
agenda,
part of which includes restrictions  on mine use.  There is a report here
on mine use and the effect on children, which is useful for, if nothing
else, reliable statistics.  At least, they
don't ask you for a donation before you leave.</blockquote>

<b>Arms Transfer Working Group</b> -
<a href="http://www.fas.org/pub/gen/atwg/index.html">
http://www.fas.org/pub/gen/atwg/index.html</a><p>

<blockquote>This is a good site, which is run by (I believe) the
Federation
of American Scientists, which sounds pretty reliable.  It had a bit of
information on the US position on mines and the congressional acts which
passed, but not much more else.  Still probably worth a visit.  This is
also definitely a place to go for information on the transfer of naval
armaments, and it is probably a good place to look for general security
issues.</blockquote>

<b>Oneworld News Service</b> -
<a href="http://www.oneworld.org/landmines/index.html">
http://www.oneworld.org/landmines/index.html</a><p>

<blockquote>I don't know who these people are, but they don't seem
objective
to me at all.  They do have lots of stuff here, including a good deal of
factual information.  There is also some weird stuff which seems
fictional or satirical, but it is presented so fact
ually, I'm not sure what to make of it.  I wouldn't use any of this data
without corroboration.</blockquote>

<b>International Red Cross</b> -        <a
href="http://www.icrc.org">http://www.icrc.org</a><p>

<blockquote>There is a bit of information here on the effects land mines
have
on health in peacetime and war.  One report pops out from the German
site.  See what you can find on the main web site then look at the next
one.</blockquote>

<b>International Red Cross Landmines Project</b> -
<a
href="http://www.icrc.ch/icrcnews/41f2.htm">
http://www.icrc.ch/icrcnews/41f2.htm</a><p>

<blockquote>Here is the bulk of the IRC information that I have found.
This
has not only some reports, but specific critiques on past UN action on
mines.  It has some reports on the most recent amendments.  The IRC was
very disappointed by the findings of the Review Conference, and I'm sure
that they will be very detailed in remaining
shortcomings in the UN's policy.</blockquote>

<b>World Health Organization</b> - <a
href="http://www.who.org">http://www.who.org</a><p>

<blockquote>There is a report published by WHO on the health effects of
mines,
which may or may not be here, since I have not had a chance to search very
hard for it.  It may be at the Reg too. The complete cite and information
can be found at a link on the Ban Land Mines Project page.</blockquote>

<b>Homepage of the Honorable Sen. Patrick Leahy</b> -
<a href="http://www.senate.gov/member/vt/leahy/general/landmine.html">
http://www.senate.gov/member/vt/leahy/general/landmine.html</a><p>

<blockquote>Senator Leahy was one of the big sponsors of the US moratorium
legislation, and there is a bit about the US legislation, including the
text of the bill.  Also, there are a bunch of cool links about
Vermont.</blockquote>

<hr>
<h3>Links for Topic B: The Transfer of Naval Armaments</h3>
This is a list of web sites I have found dealing with naval arms.  This 
isn’t as much a topic of international interest, but there is a bit of 
information out there if you know where to look.<P>

<b>The WWW Virtual Library of Naval and Maritime Studies </b> <a 
href="http://www.iit.edu/~ray/wwwvl/#Associations"> 
http://www.iit.edu/~ray/wwwvl/#Associations</a><P>
<blockquote>
	This site will help you find anything you want to know about this 
topic.  It has hundreds of links to all sorts of naval organizations and 
publications.  If your country has a navy of any substance, this page 
probably has a link to a page on it.  There is a lot of technical data, 
but much of it is understandable.  It is hard to be more specific about 
what you will find, but try it out, because there will probably be 
something of use.<P>
</blockquote>
<b>Stockholm International Peace Research Institute</b> <a 
href="http://www.sipre.se"> http://www.sipre.se</a>	<P>
<blockquote>
SIPRI is an organization in Swede which invites scholars from around the 
world to do research on arms transfers and general security issues.  This 
site will have some information on the two regions specified in the paper 
as being maritime trouble spots.  This may not be the best spot to find 
information on the arms races, but it does a good job just giving an 
overview of security issues.  These guys will also give you a graph of 
your countries military expenditures for the past decade – see if your 
neighboring countries are outspending you.<P>
</blockquote>
<b>The US Naval Institute</b>	<a href="http://www.usni.org"> 
http://www.usni.org</a><P>
<blockquote>
	The US Naval Institute is an organization affiliated with the US 
Navy which writes on issues of import to US navy personnel.  One of these 
issues is the state of the world's navies.  The USNI publishes many books 
(including The Hunt for Red October back when Tom Clancy was a nobody) and 
their magazine, Proceedings, is a good reference for what is going on on 
the high seas.  There are some excerpts on the web site.<P>
</blockquote>
<b>Naval Intelligence Professionals Home Page</b>	<a 
href="http:www.oss.net/nip"> http:www.oss.net/nip</a> <P>
<blockquote>
	I'm not sure who actually runs this site, but it is pretty good 
site.  NIP offers a lot in the way of general intelligence information.  
Particularly useful are the links to regional news agencies and sites.   
This is probably the best way to keep abreast of the current situation in 
South East Asia or in the Gulf.<P>
</blockquote>
<b>A Picture of a Kilo submarine</b>		<a 
href="http://www.thomson.com/janes/961002.jpg">http://www.thomson.com/janes/961002.jpg 
</a>
<P>
<blockquote>
	OK, you heard me talk about how these things are going to usher in 
the Armageddon, now take a look at one.  This is supposedly one of the 
subs to be sent to Iran, currently in dry-dock.  It is of little use to 
you for the committee, but it is kind of cool to see.<P>

October 28, 1996<p>

Dear Delegates,<p>

	My name is Siddesh Bale and I would like to welcome you to the 
ninth annual Model United Nations of the University of Chicago (MUNUC).  I 
have both the honor and privilege as serving as your Under-Secretary 
General for our EcoSoc committees for this upcoming conference.  To say a 
little about myself, I am a third year in the college who is attempting to 
double major in chemistry and economics.  So it is perhaps fitting that I 
be the Under Secretary General for the United Nations bodies that most 
directly deal with science and economic issues.  I have been involved in 
Model United Nations for six years both in high school and college and 
have attended well over 20 simulations.  However, I feel that this 
upcoming conference will be my best conference ever in terms of the 
comprehensive nature of the topics and the enthusiasm of the staff.<P>
	The Economic and Social Council will consist of six committees 
this year, each with its own sense of purpose and each with very pertinent 
and interesting topics.  Also, new to this year's conference are two 
committees: The Commission on the Status of Women (CSW), and the United 
Nations Committee on Science and Technology  for Development (UNCSTD).  I 
assure you, that although these committees are new to MUNUC, that their 
simulation will be commensurate with the past level of simulations of 
MUNUC committees.  The other four Economic and Social Council committees 
are: The International Court of Justice (ICJ), The United Nations 
Development Program (UNDP), The World Health Organization (WHO), and The 
United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP).  <P>
	The responsibility to represent your sovereign nation well rests 
in your hands.  Thus, I advise all of you to read through the background 
papers and acquaint yourself briefly with the topics at hand and their 
scope.  Of course, as always we are once again are asking that position 
papers be written on each of the topics.  These papers should be 
postmarked no later than <b>December 20, 1996</b>.  The papers submitted 
will be available at conference for examination. If you have any questions 
or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me or anyone else who is 
involved with the upcoming conference.  Remember the best delegate is an 
informed and knowledgeable delegate. The responsibility for this is 
yours.<P>
	I look forward to seeing each and every one of you next February 
for the ninth annual conference.  MUNUC has been a great part of my life 
here at the University and meeting new delegates every year is one of the 
benefits I value the most.  All of the chairs have enclosed contact 
information and if any problems arise, again, please do not hesitate to 
contact them.  So it is with great anticipation, that I wish you good luck 
in your research for committee and I hope that you will have an enjoyable 
time at MUNUC IX.  <P>


Sincerely,<p>

Siddesh Bale<br>

<P>
October 21, 1996<p>

Dear Delegates,<p>

	It is my pleasure to welcome you to Model United Nations at the 
University of Chicago and to our Regional Committees.  My name is Hal 
Constantine and I am the Undersecretary General for Regional Committees 
for MUNUC 1997.  I am a third year student in the college studying 
economics and statistics.  I'm from Rochester, New York and have been 
involved in Model United Nations for four years.  In high school I was a 
delegate and a committee chair.  Here at U of C, I have been an Assistant 
Chair and Chair as well as an Undersecretary General.  We here on MUNUC 
staff work hard to make this conference happen, and we hope that all of 
you will enjoy it.  I personally urge all of you to take advantage of this 
opportunity to learn more about international relations while 
strengthening your debating, negotiating, and teamwork skills.
	The Regional Committees here at MUNUC provide forums for 
discussion of important economic, policitical, and social issues in a 
regional context.  This year's committee topics are particularly complex 
but should lead to provocative and engrossing debate.  This year's 
Regional Committees are:  the Arab League, the Economic and Social 
Commission for Asia and the Pacific, the Organization of African Unity, 
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and the 
Organization of the Islamic Conference.  <P>
	This background book contains ten background papers, two for each 
of the international bodies that we will simulate at this year's MUNUC.  
As a delegate, you should read each of the papers for your committee and 
give careful thought to the available approaches to the problems and to 
your country's postions.  If you are having trouble researching your 
committee's topics, or find the papers unclear, please do not hesitate to 
contact myself or your committee Chair.  <P>
	<b>Please postmark all position papers by December 20, 1996.</b>  
This is important because our staff use the time between this date and the 
conference to read and correct the position papers.  During the 
conference, the dais staff of each committee will have all the background 
papers available in a binder.  Students will be able to look at these 
binders during committee session and learn other countries' position on 
the issues at hand.  These binders will also be a way for students to 
share the results of their research with one another.<P>
  	If you have any problems, please call or write me or your 
committee chair.  Good luck in your research efforts and in your speeches 
before the committee.  I look forward to seeing all of you at conference 
in February.<P>

 Sincerely,<p>

Hal Constantine<br>

<h3>Important Links</h3>
Here are a few links which might help you with your research on
these two topics.  If you have any questions, feel free to contact me at
<a 
href="mailto:osce@synergy.uchicago.edu"> OSCE@synergy.uchicago.edu</a>.<p>


<h3>I. Introduction</h3>
   The World Wide Web is unquestionably one of the greatest resources at
your disposal. Contained in the following websites is information that
would take you months to track down in a conventional library, especially
given the rather esoteric nature of the OSCE. Yet it must also be taken
with a grain of salt; it is not sufficient, by itself, to adequately
prepare you for Conference. You will find many articles and publications
on the following site, but for true, in-depth knowledge, nothing can beat
a university library or a UN depository. However, the Web will provide a
more than adequate base for your research. Remember, too, that all the
available information is not contained solely in these links. I encourage
you to use the many search engines of the web to find your own resources.
Happy hunting! <P>

<h3>II. Specific Research Links</h3>
<a href="http://www.fsk.ethz.ch/isn/swiss/osce_e.htm">The OSCE
Homepage(www.fsk.ethz.ch/isn/swiss/osce_e.htm)</a><P>

   This is your one-stop destination for information relating directly to
the OSCE. It contains information on all the member nations of the OSCE,
past presidents, etc. What is quite useful, however, are the back issues
of The Helsinki Monitor, the official OSCE publication, on this site. It
provides a great deal of information about the OSCE and the direction it
should move in the future, as well as the action it should be taking now
on certain problem areas. The authors have impeccable credentials, and the
articles are quite good themselves. There are several papers scattered
about this site as well; however, they are not all in English. There is
also a bibliography that will assist your research.<P>

<a href="http://www.fsk.ethz.ch/isn/">The International Security
Network(www.fsk.ethz.ch/isn/)</a><P>

   This is one of the finest resources available as far as online research
is concerned. The International Security Network has its resources divided
up in many ways; by region of the world, by subject, by security
institutions, by current events in international security, by specific
security search tool, etc. There are links on this homepage to virtually
every institution related to the United Nations in any way. This page
offers a comprehensive list of links to a vast amount of information. <P>

<a href="http://www.nato.int">The NATO Official
Homepage(www.nato.int)</a><P>

   This site is quite helpful as well; NATO has done a excellent job in
archiving their records. Of particular use is the NATO archive. It
contains the full text since 1991 of The NATO Review, the Alliances
bi-monthly publication; NATO fact sheets, which are responses to various
security issues around Europe for the past few years, and several other
important documents that will seriously enhance your knowledge of the
subject area. There are specific documents pertaining to the OSCE in here,
and links to related security sites.<P>

<a href="http://www.unisg.ch/~ipw/pko/intro.htm">The United Nations
Peacekeeping/ OSCE Field Missions
Homepage(www.unisg.ch/~ipw/pko/intro.html)</a><P>
   This site provides current, up-to-date information on all of the OSCE
Field Missions at this time and their long-term goals, as well as
information on UN Peacekeeping Missions in General. Excellent site to
understand exactly what the OSCE is doing.<P>

<h3>III. General Research Links</h3>

<a href="http://www.un.org">The United Nations Homepage(www.un.org)</a>
   Not a terribly useful page if you're looking for specific OSCE-related
information, but decent nonetheless. Provides a good overview of the
United Nations, current topics of interest, and the way that it breaks
down into various committees and organizations. It also will tell you the
closest UN Depository to your geographical location.<P>

<a href="http://www.library.yale.edu/un/unhome.htm">The United Nations
Scholars' Workstation(www.library.yale.edu/un/unhome.htm)</a><P>
   This is a very good site to search for information about general
subject areas like "Bosnia" or "disarmament". This site is indexed
extremely well and provides a good deal of links to peruse. It also
includes good maps, including some that detail UN peacekeeping operations
throughout the world. This site has an excellent search engine that is
quite useful to find various documents pertaining to the subject areas of
your research.<P>
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com">The New York
Times(www.nytimes.com)</a><P>
  If you want to keep yourself current on whats happening in the world on
a daily basis, The New York Times has an extremely good web newspaper,
with many articles taken from actual newsprint. Good to read every once in
a while.<p>


<a href="http://www.odci.gov/cia/publications/95fact/index.html">The CIA
World Factbook(www.odci.gov/cia/publications/95fact/index.html)</a>
   The CIA World Factbook is a handy reference to discover specific facts
about various countries, such as defense expenditures, type of government,
military strength, etc. Useful in appraising the situation of the country
you are representing.<P>

<a href="http://www.embassy.org">The Electronic
Embassy(www.embassy.org)</a><p>
   This site will provide you with the number of your countrys embassy in
Washington DC, who will hopefully be able to send you background
information on the nation you are representing. If you are lucky, your
country may have already established a Web site, and you will find the
link to it here as well.<P>

<P>
May 20, 1996<p>
Greetings,<p>

	As the Undersecretary General of Information, it 
is my pleasure to welcome you to 
the Information Services portion of the MUNUC homepage.  The Information 
Services 
homepage has been constructed with the sole purpose of enhancing your 
educational experience before and during MUNUC IX.<p>
  Research for Model United Nations involves 
gaining a working knowledge of the capabilities and history of the 
committee, the 
fundamental issues being discussed and the approach your country will 
take towards these 
issues.  Furthermore, successful interaction at conference depends on 
the ability to make 
instantaneous decisions while simultaneously staying in policy.  One of 
the best ways to 
gain this ability comes from an understanding of how the topic being 
discussed fits into the 
current trends and issues of the international community.  Information 
Services and its web 
page were designed to help meet the needs of motivated delegates ready 
to accept this 
challenge at MUNUC IX.  <P>
	The research conducted by Information Services falls into eight 
different subject 
areas.  These eight different subject areas include Security Issues, 
Economic Growth and 
 Development,  International Economics and Business, International Law, 
Policy and 
 Regional Issues, International Organizations and Institutions, Science 
and Technology and 
 Humanitarian and Cultural Issues.  By understanding the fundamentals of 
some or all of 
 these subject areas, you should be able to gain a deeper understanding 
of the topics 
discussed at conference.  Each subject area on our homepage will include 
databases, a 3-4 
page article covering the subjects fundamentals, references on both the 
subject and its 
application to MUNUC IX topics and a collection of links to other 
UN-related web pages.  
By cross-referencing between each subject and the 34 topic areas, we hope 
to enable 
you to explore the fundamental trends, ideas and issues that drive the 
topic areas debated at 
conference.  Only by seeking answers to today's most pressing problems will 
one be able to fully experience MUNUC IX.<P>
	Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions regarding 
Information 
Services and how it can assist you in preparation for MUNUC IX.  Our hope 
is to become 
one of the best U.N. research teams in the country so that delegates may 
find our services useful and interesting.  <P>

Sincerely,<p>


Phil Stephenson<br>

The background material will be available on the committee pages in 
their respective sections.  You can either view the topic papers with your 
current web browser, or you can download the background materials from  
our server.  <P>

We will have the downloadable materials available in a 
variety of word processing formats.  <p>

These files will be available in compressed and 
uncompressed forms.  To view the compressed files, you will need

<FONT Size=+3>Letter from the President of the Security Council</FONT>
<hr>
<p>


20 October 1996<p>

Dear Delegates,<p>

     I want to take this opportunity to extend a warm greeting to you as 
we approach the ninth coming of the Model United Nations of the University 
of Chicago. My name is Eido Walny and I will serve you as the 1997 
President of the Security Council. I will be a third-year student in the 
College during the 1996-97 academic year and I am a Political Science 
major.<P>
    MUNUC IX will be the 7th time I will have had the pleasure to work 
with this organization. For four years I served as a high school delegate 
to the conference and for the last three years, I have been on the 
opposite side of the dais. My first year at the College I was the Vice 
President of the Security Council and last year I was the Chairman of the 
Disarmament and International Security Committee. While I enjoy helping to 
run MUNUC, I have remained an active delegate on the college circuit and 
now also serve as the Vice President of the University of Chicago's own 
Model U.N. Team. The Vice Presidents for Security Council this year are 
Chris Tsai and Ying-Tao Ho. Together we hope to make the committee run 
smoothly while also being productive and enjoyable. We are very much 
looking forward to making the Security Council a great experience for all 
of the delegates. I do ask, however, that the you as a delegate research 
the topics so that the committee can run better and so that the level of 
debate can be high. As the Security Council is the U.N.'s most powerful 
committee, I expect that delegates will rise to a parallel level.<P>
     The Security Council will be addressing three very complex issues. 
First, we will take a look at the U.N.-imposed sanctions on Iraq and 
evaluate whether they should be continued, discontinued, or modified as we 
approach the 6-year anniversary of the end of the Gulf War. Next, the 
Security Council will look into the bloody civil war in Liberia. After 
many years of fighting, the war has entered a new phase in which embassies 
have been attacked, the capital has been set ablaze, and force reigns 
supreme. Finally the committee will examine the tension in the middle east 
between Israel and Lebanon, and what they can do as an international 
organization to permanently stabilize the area. <P>
     If you have any problems what-so-ever, please do not hesitate to 
contact me. I am quite sure that I can help you resolve almost any problem 
you might encounter as MUNUC IX approaches.<P>

 Sincerely,<p> Eido 
Walny<br>

15 October 1996<p>

Dear Delegates,<p>

Hello, and welcome to MUNUC IX.  My name is Max Leichtman and I am the 
Chairman of DIS this year.  I am a second-year student in the College from 
Topeka, Kansas, concentrating in Biology.  This is my second year in MUNUC 
as well, and while it has little to do with biology, it is an entertaining 
diversion from organic chemistry.  Aside from MUNUC and coursework, I am a 
member of the Model UN Team here at the University and I am an avid fan of 
baseball and college basketball. <p>
We are currently in the process of assembling an excellent committee staff 
for conference this year.  Our moderator this year is Ms. Jennifer 
Roberts, a first year student from Jefferson, Ohio.  Jennifer has been 
involved in MUNUC longer than I have, competing for several years as a 
delegate, and she is eagerly awaiting the opportunity to influence debate 
from the other side of the dais.  In addition to Jennifer and myself, DIS 
will have several assistant chairs this year, not all of whom have been 
assigned yet.  That, however, will soon be remedied and they will be duly 
introduced either in the updates or at conference.<p>
We have two fascinating topics for debate this year: land mine use and the 
sale of naval armaments.  The issue of land mines has been receiving 
increased attention in the past year from both the UN and the general 
public.  Though these weapons have not been widely used,  they are nearly 
perfect from the military perspective, and so their purchase and sale has 
continued.  Naval arms sales don’t happen as often, but when they do very 
bad things can happen.  These sales are broadly framed by some nations as 
commerce, but this type of commerce can have the unfortunate side effect 
of starting small regional wars.  Both topics ask you to deal more with 
the "disarmament" side of the committee rather than asking you to go make 
people stop fighting each other.  This means that debate may be a bit more 
abstract than dealing with a region of instability, but it also means both 
topics are truly of global interest and all nations will have a say in 
what happens in the committee.<p>
Hopefully, the background papers will help you to understand the 
intricacies of the various topics.  Both topics play different roles in 
the various regions of the world, so it is important for you to have an 
understanding of the various conflicts happening in you country's region 
and around the world.  I urge all of you to take a look at the newspaper a 
few times a week to see what’s going on.  As a general survey of world 
events, I have found The Economist to be an excellent survey of world 
affairs.  On the security issues, Jane's Defence Weekly and Jane's 
Intelligence Review are outstanding sources for current military news, 
plus they have lots of pictures of guns and bombs.  If you are having any 
difficulties finding information on either of the topics or your country’s 
position or something I said in the background papers doesn't make sense 
to you, please don't hesitate to call or write me.  Other than that, I 
look forward to reading your position papers and meeting you in 
February.<p>

 Sincerely,<p>


Max Leichtman<br>

18 Oct 1996<p>

Dear Delegates,<p>

	Welcome to the Economic and Financial Committee.  My name is 
Sudarshan Rajagopal, and I will be your chair at MUNUC IX.  I am a third 
year chemistry major and this is my second year participating in MUNUC.  
Our moderator is Ms. Jameela Raja, who is a third year as well.  The 
assistant chairs are Mr. David Cheng, Mr. Ravi Malli, Mr. Roy Anzaldua, 
Mr. Bill DeMarco, and Ms. Jean Chen.  Now that we have been introduced, 
let me move on to the most important aspect of conference, namely, the 
topics that you will be engrossed in before and during conference.<P>
	The two topic areas which we will be discussing are The United 
Nations Financial Crisis and The Effect of Environmental Trade Barriers on 
Developing Nations.  Both topic areas are extremely important today, 
having international economic and political ramifications.  The current 
United Nations financial crisis has caused major difficulties in the 
financing of many United Nations activities, such as the War Crime 
Tribunals in Rwanda and former Yugoslavia.  Discussions concerning the 
effect of environmental regulations on the products of developing 
countries has also received a great deal of attention over the past few 
years, highlighted by the Earth Summit in Rio di Janeiro in 1992, and the 
upcoming Earth Summit in New York in 1997.<P>
	I don't think that I have to stress the importance of being 
well-versed in the topic areas and your country's position in these areas.  
If you have any questions concerning either of the topic areas or your 
country's stance on either of them, please feel free to contact me.  
E-mail is the best way to reach me.  I look forward to seeing you all in 
February.<P>

 Sincerely,<p>

Sudarshan Rajagopal<br>

Dear Delegates,<p>

Greetings Delegates!  My name is Luke Barron and I am chair the General 
Assembly Plenary  Committee for MUNUC IX.  I am a second year in the 
College and intend on majoring in biology and possibly pursuing a career 
in scientific research.  I was a Vice President for the Security Council

College as well, will be the Moderator.  The Assistant Chairs will be Ms. 
Julie Chang, Ms. Sherry Hong, Mr. Nathan Cook, Ms. Wendy Chi, Mr. James 
Lo, Ms. Ji-Youn In, and Ms. Christina Lin.  Together we hope to make your 
experience on Plen a rewarding and worthwhile one.  <P>

I have chosen two topics to discuss:  Taiwan and the restructuring of the 
Security Council.  I feel these issues will lead to a lively and engaging 
debate and I hope each of you will find the conference to be interesting, 
informative, and above all, an enjoyable experience.  Please feel free to 
contact me at any time if you have any questions or concerns.  I look 
forward to seeing all of you at conference.<P>

 Sincerely yours,<p>

16 October 1996<p>


Dear Delegates, <p>

	 My name is Jennifer Golbeck, and I am very excited to be chairing 
the Legal Committee this year. Just so you know a bit about me, I am a 
second year in the College, concentrating in political science and 
economics. While here at the University, I am a member of our Model UN 
Team, and very involved with the College Democrats of America. I have been 
involved with MUNUC since my sophomore year in high school. This should be 
the best conference yet.<P>
        The staff for the committee this year is phenomenal. They are all 
very knowledgeable about the topics, and will help you with anything you 
need. Your Moderator is Mr. Devan Patel from. Your Assistant Chairs are 
Mr. Ying Tao Ho and Mr. Robert Du Boff.  I am totally confident that they 
will make committee run smoothly and enjoyably. If you have any questions 
in your preparation or at the conference, please feel free to call or 
email anyone of us.<P>
        We will be discussing two very interesting and exciting topics 
this year. They are the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former 
Yugoslavia and the Declaration on Measures to Eliminate International 
Terrorism. These are both complex and pressing issues. I expect a high 
level of debate from the committee, and strongly encourage you to do 
outside research. Being well informed of the issues and your country's 
position on them will make committee more exciting for you and everyone 
involved.<P>
        In writing these papers, I began preparing months in advance and I 
encourage you to begin your preparation right away. There is a great deal 
of information available to you.  It is important that you keep well 
informed for these topics are continually changing.
        I would once again like to welcome you to the committee. Please do 
not hesitate to call me or email anytime. Good luck in your preparation, 
and I'll see you in February.<P>


Sincerely,<p>


Jennifer Golbeck<br>

21 October 1996<p>

Dear Delegates,<p>

	Greetings, and welcome to MUNUC IX.  My name is Sam Jacob, and I 
will be chairing the Fourth Committee of the General Assembly, The 
Special, Political, and Decolonization Committee, for MUNUC IX.  <P>
	As a brief introduction, I am currently in my  second year student 
at the College, and I am expecting to graduate with a concentration in 
Linguistics.  This is my sixth MUNUC conference. I attended MUNUC four 
times in high school, including twice in Special, Political and 
Decolonization, and last year I served as a Moderator  for this committee.  
Aside from MUNUC, I am also a member of our Model UN Team, which means I 
also compete in other college Model UN Conferences as well.   Due to my 
past and present Model UN experience, I know how frustrating it can be 
being a delegate, so please feel free to contact me (preferably through  
electronic or regular mail) if you have any questions about the committee, 
the topics, or your country's positions.  Outside of Model UN, I am 
interested in traveling, and music.  Last year, I spent my third quarter 
studying in Weimar, Germany, which proved to be a wonderful experience.<P>
	Our topics are The Situation in Uganda and Resolution of the 
Status of Nagorno Karabakh.  Both topics have long histories of ethnic 
conflict and distrust, and are fairly complicated and interesting issues.  
I am looking forward to all the resolutions you will come up with.     <P>
	Your Moderator is Ms. Su Kwak, a third year, and your Assistant 
Chairs are Mr. Shadrack Scheirman, a second year, Ms. Christina Murdoch 
and Mr. Michael Tang, who are both in their first year here in the 
College.   <P>
	I hope that you all have a good year, and look forward seeing you 
all in the not so distant future, at MUNUC IX.  <P>

Sincerely,<p> 

Sam Jacob<br>

<p>


20 October 1996<p>

Dear Justices,<p>

	Welcome to the International Court of Justice!  My name is George 
Varghese and I will be serving as President of ICJ this year at Model 
United Nations of the University of Chicago. I am a fourth year student in 
the college studying economics.  I am originally from Washington, D.C. 
where I developed my interest in politics and international relations.  In 
addition to myself, there will be three Vice Presidents, including second 
year Mr. Mike Remillard, first years Mr. Victor Glowacki and Mr. Tim 
Crownhurst,  that will ensure that the Court runs smoothly.  I am here to 
make your experience serving on the court both enjoyable and interesting. 
<P>
	The two cases before the Court this session are both exciting and 
complex. I think both will provide for insightful and thoughtful debate.  
Your responsibility as justices is to make thoughtful decisions based on 
international law and customs.  The first case is Turkey vs. Greece over 
the status of the island of Lemnos.  The second case concerns an economic 
agreement made between Hungary and the former Czechoslovakia which 
Slovakia now wishes to uphold.     <P>
	I am sure that as experience justices you understand the value of 
research into these two topic areas. Unlike other committees at the UN, 
you do not represent countries, but rather yourselves, and your legal 
knowledge. I am sure that you will make informed decisions. The issues 
that are before you are great. Societies throughout the world have 
wrestled over the answers. I am sure that your abilities are up to the 
task. <P>
	Once again, welcome to the ICJ. I look forward to working with 
you. I am sure that it will be a rewarding experience. Also, do not 
hesitate to call or email me should have any questions. <P>

Yours Truly<p>

George Varghese<br>

Letter from the Chair of the United Nations Commission on Science and 
Technology for Development</FONT>
<hr>
<p>


20 Oct 1996<p>

Dear Delegates,<p>
	
	Hello!  My name is Julie Cidell, and I will be chairing the United 
Nations Commission on Science and Technology for Development at MUNUC IX.  
Besides having one of the longest names, UNCSTD is one of the newest 
committees in the United Nations, founded in 1993.  It has never before 
been simulated at MUNUC, and I'm looking forward to helping it get off to 
a good start.<P>
	I'm going into my fourth year at the University of Chicago, 
majoring in geography and mathematics.  This is my sixth year of 
involvement with MUNUC, having been a delegate twice, as well as an 
assistant chair, moderator, and last year's chair of UNEP.  While I am 
very interested in science, my interest lies not in the lab or the field 
so much as in education and policy-making.  For this reason, I'm excited 
to be chairing UNCSTD, to learn about the issues myself and to help you 
learn about both the science behind the problems we will be discussing and 
the politics involved in coming up with solutions.  Mr. Brian Dayton, a 
first year, will be the Moderator for UNCSTD this year and the Assistant 
Chairs are Ms. Reetu Agaruala, Mr. Perry Shieh, and Ms. Reda Karaliukas. 
<P>
	Our first topic is CFC substitution.  Nearly everyone has heard of 
the hole in the ozone layer, and how CFCs from air conditioners and 
aerosols are one of the big culprits.  The question remains of how to get 
rid of them.  Besides being an interesting issue in its own right, this 
topic serves as an example of the difficulties involved in transferring 
technology from developed to developing nations in order to minimize 
environmental damage down the road. <P>
	The second topic is the Global Information Infrastructure, or GII.  
The GII shows perhaps the widest gap between developed and developing 
nations of any issue currently facing the world.  While nations such as 
the United States struggle with questions of how to keep credit card 
numbers secure, there are millions of people around the world who do not 
even have access to a telephone.  Evening out this balance is a real 
challenge, but it is one of the issues UNCSTD was created to deal with.

<Font Size=+3>Letter From the Chair of the United Nations Commission on 
the Status of Women</Font>
<hr>
<p>

18 October 1996<p>

Dear Delegates,<p>
	Please allow me to welcome all of you to MUNUC IX.  My name is 
Julie Fitzgibbons, and I will be the Chair for the Commission on the 
Status of Women.  I am currently a second year in the college, pursuing a 
degree in the Biological Sciences.  I come to you with four previous years 
experience with MUNUC:  three as a high school delegate, and one as an 
Assistant Chair for the World Health Organization.  I am very excited 
about this year's conference, and I hope that all of you are eagerly 
awaiting its arrival as well.  If my past years in MUNUC serve as typical 
examples, I am sure that all of you will have a wonderfully educational 
(and fun!) experience here at MUNUC 1997.<P>
	Assisting me in committee will be the Moderator,  Mr. Phil Kirk, a 
second year in the college.  As Moderator, Mr. Kirk will monitor debate 
and appropriate use of parliamentary procedure.  Also working on the dais 
staff are four Assistant Chairs:  Ms. Zita Dubauskas, a fourth year;  Mr. 
Aaron Haas, a first year;  Ms. Pia Malkani, a first year; and Ms. Rula 
Alzadon, also a first year.  As Assistant Chairs, they will possess a 
thorough knowledge of the substantive debate topics and parliamentary 
procedure.  Please feel free to ask them, Mr. Kirk, or myself, any 
questions you may have during conference.<P>
	The issues being discussed within the Commission on the Status of 
Women are, I believe, crucial to the advancement of the human and civil 
rights of women.  These topics are female infanticide and the female slave 
trade.  Included in these documents are papers on each of these issues, 
which are meant to facilitate debate by providing information.  I strongly 
encourage all of you to research beyond these papers.  While they are as 
comprehensive as ten to twelve single-spaced pages can get, the more you 
know, the better an experience you will have.  Well-informed delegates 
always provide a source for good debate.  <P>
	Should you have any questions concerning these topics or your 
research on them, please do not hesitate to contact me.  I will be more 
than happy to assist you with any inquiries you might have.  I wish you 
all good luck in your research and preparation for conference, and I 
eagerly await the day we begin debate.<P>
 Sincerely, <p>

<FONT Size = +3>Letter from the Chair of the United Nations 
Development Program</FONT> <hr> <p>


1 Nov 1996<p>

Dear Delegates,<p>

	Welcome to MUNUC IX and the United Nations Development Programme. 
My name is Daniel Dona, and I will be serving as chair of UNDP this year.  
I guess I should tell you a little about myself, as I know that I will 
have ample opportunity to get to know each of you.  I am a fourth year in 
the college with a double major in philosophy and biology.  I play the 
violin in the University Symphony Orchestra, sing in the U of C Motet 
Choir and enjoy classical music in general. <P>
	The moderator for UNDP this year is Mr. Pete Albanis, a second 
year in the college.  There will be five Assistant Chairs for UNDP this 
year.  Ms. Lorelei Bassi is a third year majoring in Anthropology.  She is 
actively involved in WHPK, the campus radio station, and she hosts a show 
focusing on Filipino music.  Ms. Anna Lee is a third year majoring in 
Political Science.   Both Ms. Bassi and Ms. Lee were on the committee I 
chaired last year, so they are veterans and will be essential in running 
our committee smoothly this year.  Ms. Tina Cha is a fourth year majoring 
in Public Policy.  She is also actively involved in University Theater.  
Mr. Nick Nowicki is a third year majoring in Economics and Ms. Vienna 
Yeung is a first year. <P>
	The topics this year include bio-piracy and sewage treatment.  
Bio-piracy is a problem which robs many developing nations of potential 
income which could be very beneficial to their development.  Basically 
bio-piracy can be defined as the use by first-world pharmaceutical 
companies of intellectual ideas such as herbal treatments developed by the 
indigenous peoples of developing countries without giving the developers 
of those treatments any credit or reward for what is sufficiently their 
intellectual property.  The second topic, sewage treatment, is pretty 
self-explanatory; what we are trying to focus on, however, is how to 
provide adequate sewage treatment to rural areas.  This topic is both 
extremely important and timely today.  Though, most people do not realize 
it, sewage treatment is the most important infrastructure problem that 
many developing countries are facing today. <P>
	I hope that you enjoy reading these background papers that I have 
prepared on these two-topic areas.  I wish you the best of luck on your 
forthcoming research.  If you have any questions, feel free to e-mail me 
at UNDP@synergy.uchicago.edu or call me at (773)684-5945. <P> 
Sincerely,<p>

Daniel Dona<Br>

Environment Program</FONT> <hr>
<p>


14 October 1996<p>

Delegates,<p>
	
	Hello and welcome to MUNUC IX. My name is Josh Johnson and I will 
be serving as the Chairperson of the United Nations Environmental 
Programme at this year's conference. I am a fourth year and will receive 
degrees in Geophysics and Mathematics this spring. This is my third year 
in model UN.  I started as a assistant chair in the Organization of 
American States my second year and last year, I was the moderator for 
UNEP.  Ms. Vaani Kodali, a second year who worked with the International 
Court of Justice last year, will be serving as our Moderator.  There are 
also four Assistant Chairs for UNEP this year that will work to ensure 
that, with your help, you will have a rewarding experience at MUNUC IX.  
They are Ms. Tajani Farhan, Ms. Maureen Leddy, Ms. Nubia Chaidez, and Mr. 
Ted Lifset.   <P>
	This year I have chosen two topics for UNEP.  The first deals with 
problems of nuclear waste and defunct nuclear technology in the former 
Soviet Union and surrounding areas. Following the collapse of the Soviet 
Union, the Russian government began to disclose information detailing the 
horrendous environmental conditions which had resulted from mismanagement 
and carelessness in the Soviet nuclear program. As a result of countless 
nuclear abuses, Russia must now deal with nuclear waste strewn throughout 
its own waters and landscape, as well as international and foreign 
territory. However, because the nations of the former Soviet Union lack 
the resources necessary for the appropriate actions, most of the cleanup 
burden has fallen on the global community.<P>
	Our second topic looks to an important element of UNEP's global 
mission - the development of international environmental law.  UNEP 
adopted this mission as part of "Agenda 21" - the most recognizable body 
of policy created during the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment 
and Development (UNCED) in Rio de Janeiro.  The UNEP Programme of Work for 
1996-1997 more specifically addresses this mission.  At the conference, 
the environmental views of UNEP member states will be synthesized into one 
body of general environmental principles.  These principles will not 
address specific areas of the environment (ozone depletion, nuclear waste, 
ocean pollution, biodiversity, etc.), but rather will form a consistent 
strategy for the creation of environmental policy at local, national and 
international levels.  <P>
	In the process of researching your nation's position on these 
topics, you are encouraged to use a variety of sources in addition to 
those cited in my background papers including sources on the internet.   I 
look forward to hearing from you and seeing you at the conference in 
February.<P>
	
 Sincerely<p>

Josh Johnson<Br>

20 October 1996<p>

Delegates,<p>
	
	Hello, my name is Vasant Narasimhan, and I am the Chair of the 
World Health Organization for MUNUC IX.  I am currently third year at the 
University of Chicago with the intention of getting a degree in biology.  
I have worked on the Human Genome Project and am currently working on an 
independent research project in Immunology.  The Moderator for WHO this 
year is Ms. Grace Chae, a second year majoring in biology and East Asian 
Civilizations.  The Assistant Chairs are Mr. Mohammad Nayeri, Ms. Laura 
Kutianski, Mr. Dave Kazmirczak, Ms. Priti Kaur, and Ms. Mimi Chao.  <P>
	The topic areas I have chosen for the year's conference are of 
immediate importance to the world we live in and the problems that they 
present will have to be resolved soon or the world will face grave 
consequences.  The first topic area is the Tuberculosis Epidemic.  
Tuberculosis is the fastest growing disease in the world and will kill 30 
million people in the nest ten years.  The disease is airborne making it 
highly contagious which allows it to lead to a high mortality rate even 
though only 15% of those infected actually get clinical symptoms.  
Medication exists to cure tuberculosis but its improper use has led to a 
far greater problem, drug resistant strains of the bacteria.  The problem 
is worldwide and not limited to underdeveloped countries by any means.  It 
is a problem the world must deal with or it chances losing an 
unprecedented number of lives.<P>
	The second topic area is Primary Care in Third World Megacities.  
The rapid urbanization and high population in the third world has led to 
enormous slums where millions live in utter poverty and spread diseases 
that could be easily preventable.  As the world's population gets larger, 
and the disparity between the developed and developing nations increases, 
this problem can only become even more exacerbated if not resolved soon. 
Basic health care and sanitation are a necessity in these areas or 
diseases that were long thought to be under control will reemerge and 
ravage the populations.  This has already been the case in a number of 
underdeveloped nations.<P>
	I look forward to seeing each of you at conference.  Please 
consider the issues involved in these topic areas carefully as the issues 
can be complex.  I hope that you gain from the experience of exploring 
world health as much as I have and will.<P>

 Sincerely<p>

<P>
October 26, 1996<p>

Dear Delegates,<p>

	Hello, my name is Leah Bartelt, and I am the Chair of the League 
of Arab States for MUNUC 1997.  I served on this committee as a senior in 
high school, so I'm very happy to be back this time on the other side of 
the dais.  This is my third year on the staff on MUNUC, but before I 
entered the University of Chicago, I was a delegate three times with my 
high school team.  I'm originally from Worth, Illinois, a south suburb of 
Chicago, and I went to Polaris High School, which is still sending teams 
to MUNUC.  I am in my third year at the University, concentrating in 
Economics.  Outside of classes, I work as a research analyst for the 
Illinois Attorney General, and I compete with the Chicago Model United 
Nations Team.<P>
	Now that I've introduced myself, I'll tell you about the LAS 
staff.  Your moderator will be Mr. Matt Witting, a rather tall second-year 
in the college.  I also have two Assistant Chairs.  The first is Miss 
Renee McGarry, also a second-year.  My other Assistant Chair is Miss 
Francesca Mournonfly.  The staff and I have been working hard to organize 
the committee to the best of our abilities, and to prepare background 
papers that will provide you with substantial information.  Unfortunately, 
they are not all-inclusive.  You will have to do research on your own, 
especially to solidify your bloc positions and come up with new 
solutions.<P>
	The topics I have chosen for this conference are both challenging 
and involving.  I hope you will enjoy them and feel you have an important 
role in committee.  The first topic is the dispute over water and fluvial 
rights in the Middle East.  I want the committee to approach this issue as 
a general discussion, and to offer solutions that can deal with all past 
and future disputes like this in the region.  The second topic is the 
status of religious sites in Jerusalem.  Though this issue should have 
been resolved somewhere in the Middle East peace agreements, conflict has 
arisen again, and thus it is a perfect time to debate it.  <P>
	There is an enormous amount of information about these topics, but 
finding it can become quite difficult.  If you have any difficulties over 
the course of your research, call me and we can talk about it.  I and my 
staff will help you as much as we can.  I'm looking forward to meeting you 
all in February and I encourage you all to call or write me before then.  
<P>

 Sincerely,<p>

<FONT Size=+3>Letter from the Chair of the Economic and Social

<P>
October 21, 1996<p>

Dear Delegates,<p>

I am pleased to invite you to participate in the 1997 convening of the 
Economic and Social
Commission for Asia and the Pacific,[ESCAP] to be held this coming 
February in Chicago by the Model United Nations of the University of 
Chicago. This year, the conference promises to be bigger and better than 
any conference before, with expanded delegate services, top quality 
research facilities, and exciting and engaging topic areas. We hope that 
your experience at MUNUC 1997 will be as positive as those of our 
delegates in preceding years, if not better.<P>

Let me take this opportunity to introduce myself and write a little about 
ESCAP. My name is Bharath Dwarkanath and I am a third year student in the 
college. I am originally from Andover, Massachusetts. At the University of 
Chicago, I plan to pursue a double degree in a program called HiPSS, 
[History, Philosophy, and Social Studies of Science and Medicine] as well 
as South Asian Studies, while following a pre-medical curriculum. Aside 
from serving as your Chair, I will be glad to answer any questions you 
have about this University, should you be interested.<P>

The staff of ESCAP promises to be nothing less than excellent.  The 
moderator is Mr. Justin Jones.  Last year he was a Vice President for 
Security Council and this will be his first year with us.  The Assistant 
Chairs are Mr. David Low, Ms. Deepa Gupta, Ms. Elaine Chang, Mr. Thomas 
Anjali, and Mr. Adrian Chao.  Together we will provide an excellent 
setting for exciting debate.  If you have any problems before or during 
conference, please feel free to contact any of us any time.<p>
 
Your experience at MUNUC this year will be nothing short of excellent. The 
expansion of
MUNUC Information Services this year is sure to provide all of you with 
research capabilities far surpassing those at any other Model U.N. 
Conference in the nation. This year, I have chosen two topics for debate 
on the ESCAP floor, which I feel are sufficiently current, challenging, 
educational, and interesting to maintain a very high level of debate. The 
first pertains to development in the ESCAP region, with some focus on 
foreign investment, realization of market economies, and the need for 
infrastructure to sustain development. The second pertains to the labor 
force in the ESCAP region. We will examine the place of women in this 
labor force, focusing on dismantling any barriers they may face to an 
equal opportunity for entrance and sustenance within the labor force, with 
an eye towards promoting equity and non-exploitative practices.<p>

As you prepare for debate throughout these coming months, I encourage you 
to contact me with any questions or concerns you may have. I look forward 
to meeting all of you in February.<p>



With Regards,<p>

October 25, 1996<p>

Dear Delegates,<p>

	Welcome to another exciting year with the OAU!   My name is 
Carolina Herrera and I am currently a fourth-year in the College studying 
Political Science and East Asian Languages and Civilizations.  This will 
be my sixth MUNUC.  I attended twice in high school as a delegate and 
continued to attend Model United Nations conferences as a college student.  
It 's been great fun and I hope to bring all the experience I've to help 
make this a great conference.	 <P>
	Your staff this year is made up of some of the best MUNUC has to 
offer.  Your Moderator, Mr. Matt Thom, is a third year in the college 
concentrating in Public Policy.  He's a MUNUC veteran as are two of your 
Assistant Chairs Ms. Cassandra Grabarek and Mr. Jason Link.  The newest 
member of our staff is Ms. Georgia Angelkus, another Assistant Chair, who 
attended MUNUC throughout high school.<P>
	As you may have noticed, the topics this year concern peace in 
Africa. Warfare and internal disturbances hinder foreign investment, aid 
missions, education programs, and proper government which are necessary if 
the continent is ever going to contribute more than 2% of the world's 
trade.  Topic A, Mercenaries, looks at the "war" side of the problem.  The 
use of mercenaries to promote political and military agendas presents 
several dangers to African Unity.  Their presence promotes conflict, 
threatens other countries, and is illegal under the laws of the OAU.  
Topic B, Forced Migration and Rights of Repatriation, deals with the ways 
refugees are manipulated to serve countries' political agendas. Some 
countries permanently force political, religious, and ethnic groups out of 
their borders in order to achieve some political or economic goal.  The 
refugee crisis that this causes can lead to genocide, warfare, and 
destruction of the environment.  Since the OAU is the only African body 
which can address problems between African states and seek African 
solutions, it makes it the perfect forum to address these growing 
international crises. <P>
	I know Africa is a difficult subject to research, and that these 
problems are not simple to solve.  I hope, however, that you find them 
interesting and come to committee ready to defend your countries' 
policies.  Positions papers are vital in this, so please send me them so 
that we both know you're ready for conference.   I also want you enjoy 
committee.   If you need any help with your topics, or if you haven't 
beensense  to conference before, feel free to call or e-mail me.  See you 
in committee!<P>

 Sincerely,<p>

Carolina Herrera<br>

Dear Delegates,<p>

	My name is Faris Mansour and I will be Chairman of the 
Organization of the Islamic Conference for MUNUC 1997.  This will be the 
first year that we will be simulating the OIC at MUNUC and we are all very 
excited.  The OIC, as you may know, is the meeting where the delegates of 
each Islamic nation meet to discuss the most important current issues 
concerning Islamic nations. We will be dealing with two very diverse 
topics that are well within the jurisdiction of the OIC.  The first topic 
involves the duality of the legal traditions of Islamic nations.  Many of 
the Islamic nations in the OIC have a mixture of Islamic law and secular 
laws.  This is a very difficult topic for even the foremost scholars in 
the field, so it will require that you prepare for it accordingly.  The 
second topic concerns the drastic military buildup of Iran in recent 
times.  On the one hand, such a buildup threatens many nations in the OIC, 
conversely, many nations believe that the purchase of military arms is 
well within a nation's national sovereignty.  <P>
	We have a great staff for the OIC this year.  Your moderator will 
be Mr. Anthony Yim, and your assistant chairs will be Helen Hoguet, 
Samantha Anderson, Ted Delacruz, and Young-Ki Kim.  These are all very 
knowledgeable and skillful people with a lot of enthusiasm.  I am looking 
forward to meeting all of you and chairing MUNUC's first ever OIC.  If any 
delegate has any questions or concerns about this year's committee and/or 
topics, please do not hesitate to contact me either by phone or by 
e-mail.<P>


Sincerely,<p>



Faris Mansour<br>

<FONT Size=+3>Letter from the Chair of the Organization for Security and 
Cooperation in Europe</font>
<hr>

October 28, 1996<P>

Dear Delegates,<p>


	Welcome to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in 
Europe!  My name is Basil Cherian, and I will be chairing the Organization 
for Security and Cooperation (OSCE) this coming February at MUNUC IX.  I 
am currently a second-year student here at the University of Chicago, and 
as of yet, my major is undecided.  Your moderator will be Ms. Sunita Iyer, 
a third-year in the college and an anthropology major.  The assistant 
chairs for this committee are Shahnaz Chowdry, Kristen Davis, Mary-Lee 
Kimber, and Gary Tozbikian.<P>
	With the end of the Cold War and the advent of regional power 
disputes, the role of the OSCE has become more and more important in 
improving and supporting the European security structure. To that extent, 
the OSCE has been recently taking a more active role throughout Europe in 
many different functions, serving as peacekeepers, election monitors, 
utilizing "preventive diplomacy" measures, and strengthening treaties and 
existing multilateral organizations in Europe.  But the OSCE's work is far 
from over.
As you may know, the OSCE governs by consensus, meaning that for most 
issues, all countries in the body must ratify a resolution.  This poses 
some unique situations as far as alliance-building is concerned and 
challenges the delegates to create widespread cooperation.<P>
 One of the problems the OSCE will be dealing with in the near future is 
the question of modernizing the Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) 
Treaty, which was ratified before the fall of the former Soviet Union.  
Another problem the OSCE will consider is the question of nuclear 
materials smuggling and its impact on collective security in Europe. 
Debate continues over the extent of the problem and what an adequate 
solution would consist of.<P>
	I would like to wish you luck in your research efforts, and I look 
forward to meeting you this winter.  Please do not hesitate to contact me 
if you have any questions about your research, the topic areas, or the 
committee itself.<P>

Regards,<p>

Basil Cherian<br>

<h2>Powerful New Web Service Matches Startups, Experienced Managers, Investors and Innovative Companies; Membership Tops 300--</h2>

The Dreams to Reality Nexus (TM) membership topped 300 in July.  This personalized service is the Net's most powerful online matching center designed specifically to bring together entrepreneurs, "would-be" entrepreneurs, managers, investors and companies interested in startups and new product/service ideas.

<p><b>BALTIMORE, MARYLAND - JULY 23, 1996 - </b></p>

<p>Introduced on April 22, 1996, the Dreams to Reality Corporation Nexus has grown to over 300 members in the last 90 days, reflecting broad interest in the service's focus on the use of a sophisticated database-driven site to quickly and accurately match its members based on their interests.  This isn't an easy task, considering the Nexus includes members as diverse as an experienced manager with a leading company in Denmark, top-school MBAs, a biotechnology startup, an individual with an idea for a "deep news" multimedia network, a startup "GenX" magazine and an innovative new satellite company!

<p>Irfan A. Kamal, Dreams to Reality's President and Founder, founded this company in part from personal experience that suggests that "one of the hardest, and potentially very expensive, jobs in developing or growing a new company, product or service is finding qualified and experienced business partners and managers -- either to work for you or invest in you.  Similarly, persons or companies seeking such new ideas have found good ideas and companies very difficult to find.  The Nexus's goal is to radically improve this process through an affordable, user-friendly Web-based matching center."

<p>In brief, the service allows members who have new ideas or partnering opportunities to complete a profile outlining the details of their new ideas and/or opportunities, save their profiles and search for business partners or potential corporate partners with similar interests.   Similarly, individuals interested in exploring senior-level employment and/or investment in a new company or idea can save a profile outlining their interests.  Finally, companies interested in developing a new business idea or co-marketing, joint venture and investment opportunities, can save profiles and search for opportunities.  

<p>Dreams to Reality is located at 2809 Boston Street, Suite 218, Baltimore, Maryland 21224.  Phone number (410) 732-1990 and e-mail, info@dreamstoreality.com.  The company's Web service is located at http://www.dreamstoreality.com. Mr. Kamal, President and Founder of the Company, worked at Bechtel, Merrill Lynch and Boeing before founding Dreams to Reality.  He has an M.B.A. from Stanford Graduate School of Business and a B.S.E. from Princeton University.

<h2>New Web Service Matches New Product Ideas, Entrepreneurs, Managers,
Investors and Innovative Companies</h2>

The Dreams to Reality Nexus (TM) is an exciting new online matching
center designed specifically for entrepreneurs, &quot;would-be&quot; entrepreneurs
and companies or investors interested in developing new businesses and
new product/service ideas.

<p><b>BALTIMORE, MARYLAND - APRIL 22, 1996 - </b></p>

<p>Dreams to Reality Corporation has introduced the Dreams to Reality Nexus
(tm), a unique one-stop online matching service designed for senior-level
networking between entrepreneur/owners, &quot;would-be&quot; entrepreneur/owners
- specifically professionals and managers in large corporations-and and
companies or investors interested in partnering possibilities related to
new businesses and new product/service ideas. </p>

<p>Irfan A. Kamal, Dreams to Reality's President and Founder, notes that
&quot;one of the hardest jobs in developing a new company, product or service
is finding qualified business partners -- either to work for you or with
you. Similarly, persons or companies seeking such new ideas have found
good ideas very difficult to find. Our goal is to facilitate this process
through an affordable, accessible and user-friendly Web-based matching
center.&quot; </p>

<p>Dreams to Reality believes it will provide a &quot;be your own boss&quot;
alternative to both the hundreds of thousands of employees, many of them
professionals and managers, recently &quot;downsized&quot; from large corporations
<i>and</i> to current employees concerned about future income/job security,
rising pay differentials between company presidents and employees/managers,
and the increased stress faced by survivors at many large companies. </p>

<p>Dreams to Reality has also created a confidential environment in which
individual and corporate investors can enter investment profiles and search
periodically for matches. It is difficult at this time for individual investors
to find attractive early stage/private company investments (and vice versa);
the <i>Nexus</i> seeks to facilitate this matching process. </p>

<p>The service allows members who have new ideas or collaboration/licensing
opportunities to complete a profile outlining the details of their new
ideas and/or opportunities, save their profiles and search for business
partners or potential corporate partners with similar interests. Similarly,
individuals interested in exploring senior-level employment and/or investment
in a new company or idea can save a profile outlining their interests.
Finally, companies interested in developing a new business idea or co-marketing,
joint venture and investment opportunities, can save profiles and search
for opportunities. </p>

<p>The service preserves confidentiality by allowing members to control
disclosure of their idea(s) and/or name(s). &quot;The control members have
over the disclosure of both idea and personal information allows individuals
and 'idea owners' who might not otherwise explore new opportunities to
do so,&quot; observes Mr. Kamal. </p>

<p>Dreams to Reality believes the Web's wide reach, the explosion of interest
in entrepreneurial ideas and opportunities, and recent significant downsizing
of professionals and managers at major corporations all indicate this service
has tremendous potential to contribute to new business development. </p>

through the Internet and CD-ROM. The voyage begins with VR Trail's focus
on mountain biking - trail maps, travel information, photos and much more
for the biking enthusiast can be found at the site and on the company's

of free current articles arranged by topic, ranging from an evaluation
of incentive pay to a look at international credit data. The focus is on
finance, HR, and also some general management issues in particular industries.
If you get crazily excited by these topics, you can subscribe on a paid

<P><IMG SRC="realhot.gif" HEIGHT=100 WIDTH=80 ALIGN=ABSBOTTOM><A HREF="http://www.newspage.com">NewsPage.</A>
One of the most cost-effective (about $7 per month) and comprehensive business
news filtering services on the Net. Especially impressive is the breadth
of sources (over 600) that are drawn upon to provide news in up to 2,500
topic areas. In case you don't want information from all 2,500 topic areas,
you can set up a personalized news profile. While the depth is great, don't count on great customer service -- responses to the reviewer's e-mail questions were very slow.  Alternatives to NewsPage include IBM's InfoSage (great depth of resources, but pricier) and Pointcast (less depth of resources, but integrated with a fascinating screensaver).</P>

<P><A HREF="http://www.cnnfn.com">CNNfn.</A>
Good breadth of coverage of business and financial news, excellent integration
of audio and video clips into news summaries, and a useful collection of
editorial-style pieces of use to business managers. (June 1996)</P>

<P><BR CLEAR=BOTH>
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.wsj.com">Wall
Street Journal.</A> The Wall Street Journal, interactive edition. What
more can one say? Depth of coverage is unbeatable in print, let's hope
the interactive edition continues to reflect that style. The site's a little
slow, but apparently they've been overwhelmed by the volume. (June 1996)</P>

The Association's web site has detailed information on the use of arbitration,
including sample clauses. And this isn't just for unions -- it's an alternative
worth considering for use in a variety of businesses and business settings.
Also has information on international arbitration. Check it out! </P>

<P><BR>
<A HREF="http://www.thomson-thomson.com">Thomson

many links to articles relevant to both &quot;beginner&quot; information

<p><h2 align=center><IMG SRC="/reality/bluebull.gif" WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="13"> The Profile Manager</h2>
<p>
The profile manager is a powerful feature designed to simplify the creation and maintenance of several different objectives for the same user.  Profiles can be purchased (at a substantial discount to getting new memberships) -- data from each profile is stored separately and users can assign separate passwords to profiles if necessary.  The profiles features allow the following, as examples:
<ol>
<li>if you represent a company or investor(s) looking for an opportunity, you can create a separate profile for each of your objectives; for example: 
<ul><li>a biotech company might create several profiles for different types of products being sought for investment/partnering 
<li>an individual representing investors might create a separate profile for each investor's interests
<li>a company seeking managers for different areas can use separate profiles and descriptions to highlight each position's needs separately
</ul>
<li>if you're an individual, you can also create separate profiles for each of your objectives; for example:
<ul><li>if you're looking for more than one type of job, simplify the process by creating separate profiles for your different interests
<li>if you have an opportunity and are looking for different types of managers or different partnering relationships, specify these interests in separate profiles.
</ul>
</ol>
Each profile can be protected by a separate password!  It makes it exceptionally easy to monitor several areas of interest.  Additional profiles can easily be added to the main user's account.  
<p>
Profile pricing is shown <a href="/cgi-shl/dbml.exe?template=/reality/entremat/profpay.dbm">here</a>.

We are a small startup (presently two employees/owners) developing a number of diagnostic and
therapeutic medical devices. At present we are funded primarily through NIH SBIR (Small Business
Innovation Research) grants and consulting. We are well funded through the next year. Both
owners/employees have Ph.D.s and research experience in biomedical engineering. We are looking
for an employee with a similar but complementary background to aid in technology development.
Idealy this employee would bring some of his/her own ideas to the company and persue these ideas
through SBIR grants. We invision that an employee who is active in developing new technologies for
the company would become a full partner in the company. Because company funding is uncertian
after next year and any employee would be assuming some long term risk, we are open to
negotiating equity as part of the compensation package.

<P>
I want to be part of the senior management team that succeeds in building a company. I can contribute in the areas of marketing, product management, evangelical sales and operations. I have over ten years of successes in marketing, product management, sales and business development of networking products and software. I have spent much of the last three years working on Internet products and services and am up-to-speed on both the technical and business/marketing issues surrounding the Internet. Most recently, I was the director of marketing at a software startup (IPO Summer '95), where I was key to the formulation and successful implementation of the strategy to market both retail (shrink-wrapped) and OEM/bundled Internet software. I joined the company as the 23rd employee, and built the marketing department, launched the companyís first products and oversaw the outsourcing of production, fulfillment and customer support. Prior to that, I was the product manager of customer premises communication equipement at AT&T and sold computer systems and networking and database software for AT&T and two small companies. My academic background is an MBA from the MITís Sloan School and an EE degree from Cornell University.

<H3>DEFENSE CONSOLIDATION WILL CONTINUE THROUGH 1996, FEWER BLOCKBUSTER
DEALS, EMPHASIS ON INTEGRATION AND CONVERSION</H3>
</center>
<P>
&quot;The pace of defense industry mergers and acquisitions will
continue in 1996, although the size of the transactions are likely
to be somewhat more modest and designed to enhance and consolidate
industry niches,&quot; says Jim Schwendinger, National Practice
Director, Aerospace &amp; Defense Manufacturing for Deloitte &amp;
Touche Consulting Group.
<P>
&quot;Following the round of blockbuster aerospace and defense
transactions in the last two years, we expect 1996 will be a year
of smaller, more focused transactions. Instead, we expect that
many of the recent active players will be focused more on realizing
the synergies that were identified during acquisition,&quot; says
Schwendinger, adding that the processes essential to successful
merger integration are somewhat new to the management teams in
many defense firms.
<P>
As we approach the end of the year it appears likely that the
1996 Defense Budget will be $243 billion with a $7 billion increase
over last year. Schwendinger points out that &quot;the 1995 defense
budget represents less than 3% of the U.S. Gross Domestic Product
as compared to 6.3% in 1985. The new budget includes funding for
an additional seawolf submarine and advance funding for additional
B-2 bombers as well as three DDG-51 destroyers as incremental
items over last year's spending level. Thus far, the majority
of reductions have come in equipment procurement while funding
for personnel has changed little,&quot; according to Schwendinger.
<P>
Regarding the airline industry, Mr. Schwendinger predicts that
further combinations are possible. The airline industry is experiencing
healthy profits for the first time since 1989, triggering both
airline consolidation as well as an increase in orders for commercial
aircraft. &quot;Any one merger/acquisition will have broad scale
airline industry impact since it will likely create an imbalance
amongst the remaining competitors and may lead to other defensive
transactions,&quot; says Schwendinger.
<P>
Schwendinger expects that orders for new commercial aircraft will
be up in 1996. &quot;You're going to see a moderate recovery for
the commercial aircraft industry for the next couple of years.
It is not going to be a repeat of the boom period of the 1980's,
as both the airlines as well as the manufacturers will want to
be cautious to avoid the boom/bust cycle.&quot;
<P>
&quot;The U.S. commercial airline industry lost more money between
1990 and 1994 than it made in profits in the previous 30 years,
and the global airlines did likewise,&quot; observes Schwendinger.
&quot;The fundamental issues are that the cost of airplane ownership
is too burdensome, and the airlines have historically had problems
operating at reasonable profit margins consistently.&quot;
<P>
Schwendinger identified some key trends to watch in 1996:
<UL>
<LI><B>Defense Conversions To Commercial<BR>
</B>One of the defense industry's biggest challenges in the era
of shrinking national defense budgets has been converting technology
and production capabilities originally developed for the military
to producing products for non-defense sectors. While there have
been mixed results during the past decade, there are also some
success stories.<BR>
One opportunity for defense conversion is telecommunications in
emerging global economies. Several defense companies are planning
to launch satellite networks to support voice and data communications.
Many emerging countries in Africa, the Middle East and Asia are
making a quantum technological leap from radio communications
to cellular telephones. Instead of stringing together a land-based
cable infrastructure, emerging countries are skipping four generations
of telecommunications technology to go directly to satellite communications.
One of the hot trends in coming years will be aerospace companies
leveraging their expertise to penetrate these emerging markets.
<LI><B>Reengineering The Engineers<BR>
</B>For many years, the engineering function in aerospace and
defense has been somewhat of a sacred cow. As the industry has
evolved, so too must the engineers if their companies are to remain
competitive. Progressive companies are carefully evaluating their
engineering processes to identify ways to reduce design time,
utilize design tools to enhance productivity, incorporate design
for manufacturability, seek to create reusable designs and eliminate
engineering activities that are low value-added in nature. Many
firms are utilizing Integrated Product Teams (IPT) to drive these
initiatives, coupled with newly-designed metrics to establish
accountability for the needed changes.
<LI><B>Global Aerospace and Defense Downsizing<BR>
</B>U.S. companies have done a better job of preparing for the
industry's globalization than their European counterparts. In
the immediate future there will likely be some real stress in
the European aerospace and defense industries, because they have
not responded well to global downsizing.<BR>
There are crises on the horizon in the countries which have semi-nationalized
aerospace industries, such as France, Germany and Italy among
others. Many European companies suffer from cost structures that
are grossly out of line. It is a common practice in many European
countries to have their economies prop up the nationalized defense
firm by buying equipment from companies inside their national
boundaries. On a go-forward basis, the need for high quality equipment
at a low cost may force the European defense companies to create
their own multinational consortiums to compete against the mega
U.S. firms.
<LI><B>Russians Looking To Sell Capability<BR>
</B>As a sign of the times, the former Russian defense industry
is gearing up to become a global defense industry marketing force
to generate foreign cash. The CIS has 2,000 defense plants and
some 6 million defense workers who are among the best educated
in their society. While their progress has not been flashy or
spectacular, the Russians are becoming more of a factor in the
international hunt for foreign military sales. Their recent testing
of the Proton rocket to put spaceloads into low cost orbit is
the tip of the iceberg.
<LI><B>Defense Privatization<BR>
</B>Like the commercial sector, the defense industry -- including
the military itself -- is being challenged to assess the best,
lowest cost ways to get things done. In 1996, the DOD will most
likely begin to actively consider privatization of several areas,
as a way to do their part in improving the cost/performance of
several areas. Key areas under materials management, training,
housing, data center operations, food and laundry services, and
military base operations.
<LI><B>Improved Costing Systems<BR>
</B>As defense industry companies struggle to compete in the new
marketplace, these companies are being confronted with the need
for better insight about their costs to support the decisions
management must make. The historical cost systems were designed
to support the government's needs but fell short of the needs
to understand product and process costs. Understanding such costs
would be critical to evaluate which site was the lowest cost after
a merger, make/buy decisions, or identifying non-value added activities
for elimination. While several aerospace and defense companies
experimented with activity-based cost systems, the majority still
do not have access to these techniques. While the industry has
voiced concerns about new disclosure statements, the value of
meaningful management cost data should far outweigh the risk.
<LI><B>Adopting Commercial Practices<BR>
</B>Last year, the DOD announced its Acquisition Reform initiative
designed to change the way defense procurement is done to more
closely mirror the commercial industry. Anyone serious about this
initiative and the cultural barriers both within the government
and industry should not be surprised that the program has translated
more to rhetoric than results thus far. But progress is occurring
and will continue if maintained. The JDAM program, which is a
tailfin kit to convert general purpose bombs to smart bombs utilizing
Global Positioning System (GPS) technology, is a clear success.

<H2>Automotive</H2>
</center>

"Minivan, sport utilities and pick-up trucks will continue to drive Big Three profits through 1996.  But as the market remains soft and light truck demand finally shows signs of flattening out after years of non-stop growth, the automotive industry faces a very challenging year.  Add in the complexities of a UAW contract year, continued focus on international growth markets, and major organizational changes at nearly all the companies, and 1996 should be a bellwether year," reports Randall W. Miller, National Practice Director, Automotive Manufacturing for Deloitte & Touche Consulting Group.<P>

As North American production capacity grows for both the Japanese and Europeans, Miller anticipates greater price competition after several years of upward pricing movement -- good news for the U.S. consumer.<P>

"While the Big Three have been counting on truck sales to make or break their profitability, the Japanese are becoming more price competitive as they gradually build their North American car and truck capacity, insulated from a volatile yen," says Miller.  The Japanese have been forced to embrace the philosophy that they must manufacture where they sell.<P>

"But the other shoe has yet to drop for the Big Three," warns Miller.  The Japanese are beginning to successfully challenge their light truck domain.  New Japanese product entries in sport utilities, minivans and light trucks will be more on the mark with consumers than past efforts.  The resulting price pressure could erode margins for the Big Three.<P>

<H2>International Trade</H2>

In the end, 1995 resulted in a lessening of trade tensions between the U.S. and Japan, the Big Three are mounting full-fledged assaults on the Japanese market.  In 1996, we are likely to see a replay of trade tensions, only this time between the U.S. and South Korea.  As the Koreans continue their major export programs from their protected home markets, the Clinton Administration, which has shown itself to be aggressive on trade issues, is likely to take up the cause in an election year.<P>

The rapidly developing Asian markets, and others, continue to generate enthusiasm among the auto companies and their suppliers.  Here, there may be more questions than answers.  How fast will these markets really grow, and will any one manufacturer come to dominate?  Will Eastern Europe finally grow? The CIS?  Do India and China really warrant all the attention and investment they are receiving, or is the payback still too far off?  Will the massive investments underway in Brazil and Argentina produce overcapacity?  The developing markets are where much of the action is.<P>

<H2>U.S. Auto Manufacturers</H2>

The Big Three's supplier base has been undergoing a decade-long rationalization.  The bad news is it may only be half-way completed.  As the automakers continue to squeeze better pricing from their suppliers, there is incredible anxiety, particularly among the mid-size suppliers.  This is prompting a new round of consolidations domestically, and expansion internationally through acquisitions, joint ventures and virtual partnerships.  Suppliers know they can only survive by getting bigger, and 1996 will be a big merger and acquisition year.<P>

Automotive safety has clearly become market driven.  By the end of the year, consumers will have a choice of vehicles with side impact restraint systems.  Higher speed limits on U.S. highways may serve to further stimulate demand for safety features.<P>

One bit of good news for the auto manufacturers:  the electric vehicle -- the Zero Emission Vehicle -- is all but dead.  Technology and market realities are finally being acknowledged by the politicians and bureaucrats, and 1996 will surely see a lessening of pressure for electric-powered cars and trucks.<P>

Miller sees the following issues dominating the large U.S. manufacturers in 1996:<P>

<ul><li><b>Sales and Marketing</b> -- Many manufacturers are adopting brand management approaches for marketing.  In addition, they are rationalizing and strengthening their dealers in the field.  As 1996 produces more pricing pressures, how will the new organizations deal with the need for rebates and incentives?<P>

<li><b>Product Development</b> -- Today, success in the auto industry is driven by the best product development -- consistently bringing new products to market which the customer is willing to pay a fair price for.  All the manufacturers have been scrutinizing their product development processes to reduce the elapsed time and cost of launching new products.  1996 will be a year of implementing changes to these processes -- although we may not see the results for several years.<P>

<li><b>Labor Relations</b> -- This could be a difficult contract year for the Big Three and the UAW.  After some recent setbacks, the UAW leadership will want to reassert itself.  The Big Three have been profitable, the UAW wants more job security, and targeted labor actions by the UAW against the Big Three over the past few years have been effective.  Look for outsourcing to be the major stumbling block.<P>

<li><b>Globalization</b> -- Leveraging their size and tapping into the rapidly growing markets in developing countries will continue to be the key strategies of the car manufacturers and their top suppliers.  Execution will be the critical differentiator.<P>

<li><b>Cost Reduction</b> -- Cost pressures are more dramatic than ever.  As the North American market has become less cyclical, which manufacturers will best take advantage of steadier volume levels and achieve the greatest productivity and cost improvements.  Supplier executives lose a lot of sleep over this one;  annual price reductions continue to be the norm.</ul><P>

<H2>European Auto Manufacturers</H2>

Although many discussions are occurring among the European car manufacturers, intra-European mergers are not likely during 1996.  Instead, look for more, and expanded, cross linkings with the Europeans, Japanese and North Americans.  The Europeans will be challenged in 1996 to maintain their lead in China.<P>

Miller sees the following issues dominating the large European manufacturers in 1996:<P>

<ul><li><b>Cost Structures</b> -- The perennially high-cost European manufacturers must continue to reduce their costs.  Further shifting of production to Eastern Europe and North America is likely to continue.  Will Germany continue to see an erosion of its manufacturing base?  Almost certainly, the answer is yes.<P>

<li><b>Currency Impacts</b> -- Until European Monetary Union occurs, exchange rate fluctuations will continue to impact the relative levels of competitiveness among the Europeans.  Manufacturers with a manufacturing footprint in weak currency  countries (e.g., Italy) will continue to benefit in 1996.  Cross-border gray market sales, and the attempts by manufacturers to stifle them, will grab headlines in 1996.<P>

<li><b>Return of European Luxury Marquees</b> -- Aided by the strong yen, which has eroded the competitiveness of Japanese-built high-end products, and internal 
restructurings which have dramatically boosted productivity at home,  the European luxury manufacturers enter 1996 in their strongest competitive position in at least a decade.  Will they capitalize on the opportunity before the Japanese shift production offshore?</ul>

<H2>Japanese Auto Manufacturers</H2>

Miller gave an overview of the Japanese market, noting that the high yen, despite stabilizing near 100 to the dollar, remains a drag on the overall Japanese economy.  Japan's days as a major auto exporter are numbered.<P>

Miller sees the following issues dominating the large Japanese manufacturers in 1996:<P>


<ul><li><b>Excess Capacity</b> -- Although the Japanese home market should grow slowly in 1996,  major restructuring actions are still necessary to reduce domestic production capacity.  Miller gave an overview of the Japanese market, noting that in other countries, numerous plant closings have already occurred.  We might see a domino effect of closures during 1996.<P>

<li><b>Product Platform and Component Standardization</b> -- Generally speaking, the Japanese are two to three years ahead of North Americans in reducing product proliferation, standardizing componentry and reducing product development lead time.  This has mitigated the effects of the strong yen by enabling major product cost reductions.  Now, they must squeeze still more costs out to become more cost competitive.<P>

<li><b>Minivans/Sport Utility Vehicles</b> -- The surprising success of recent Japanese minivan and sport utility entries will encourage numerous additional new products and the addition of more offshore capacity, especially in North America.</ul>

<H2>Korean Auto Manufacturers</H2>

The South Korean auto manufacturers continue to make their presence felt in world markets.  Although the government corruption scandal will be a major distraction during 1996, this will not alter the long-term aggressiveness of the Korean car companies.<P>

Miller sees the following issues dominating the large Korean manufacturers in 1996:<P>

<ul><li><b>Target: U.S.</b> -- The Korean manufacturers will continue to gain U.S. market share in the entry level segments.  Here, they threaten both the Big Three and the Japanese.  Expect heated trade debates during 1996, centering on automotive import barriers into Korea.<P>

<li><b>Developing Markets</b> -- The Koreans will continue to be among the most aggressive competitors in less-developed markets (e.g., the CIS, Eastern Europe, Southeast Asia, South America).  Their products tend to be well-suited based upon lower costs.  Expect more significant investments by the Koreans in 1996, unless political fallout causes a delay.</ul>

<H2>Chemicals</H2>
<P>
<H3>U.S. CHEMICAL COMPANIES MUST RESIST ADDING CAPACITY IN 1996 AS DEMAND REACHES CYCLICAL PLATEAU, WARNS INDUSTRY EXPERT</H3>
</center>

Heading into 1996, U.S. chemical companies must resist the traditional urge to expand their capacity during a period of peak market demand -- demand which has now plateaued -- warns a leading industry consultant.<P>

"In developing their plans for the short and intermediate terms, chemical companies must remember that this, above all, is a cyclical industry," says Reynold Mooney, Associate Practice Director, Chemical Process Manufacturing for Deloitte & Touche Consulting Group.<P>

"The industry must learn from the mistakes of the past," says Mooney.  "Traditionally, when the industry gets to the top of the cycle, as it is now, companies add capacity to try and grow.  But, when the next downturn begins -- which might occur as early as 1997 -- the industry will be back in the same old boat, with a lot of capacity chasing a little bit of volume.  In short, another painful downturn, which could be avoided by better industry stewardship and by focusing company resources on other areas which help the bottomline."<P>

"It is critical for chemical companies to remain focused on driving costs down by implementing new methods and technology," says Mooney.  "An example of this is using technology to integrate processing technology with information systems so that management information is seamless and real time.  This enables a company to be more flexible and responsible to its customers."<P>

Mooney believes that 1996 will mark the beginning of a period where process industries will see greater benefits from their R&D investments.  "A good example is the steel industry.  Thin-slab 
castings is a major technological breakthrough.  It is going to allow mini-mills to compete effectively for business in the automotive and appliance markets.  Chemicals, and the paper industries, as well as other process competitors should learn from this example how innovations in process technology can give a new boost to sagging asset productivity."<P>

Companies must also change their approaches to new product development, suggests Mooney.   "Process industries must recognize a reality of the '90s: product life cycles are accelerating.  And 
too many companies ignore the fact that product innovation is an important way to dramatically  grow their business.  This is not just about a process to manage efficiently bringing new products to market; it's also about basic molecular research and the convergence of the chemical, biological, genetic and other life science disciplines."<P>

Globalization and competitive pressures may result in stepped-up merger activity during 1996, predicts Mooney.   "The chemical industry is very active right now.  Following chemicals is the paper industry.  The paper industry faces fundamental changes in its competitive dynamics.  Many paper companies are now facing the issue of how to compete and how to position themselves in the market."<P>

One of the most important priorities for process companies right now is creating sustainable value for the shareholders, says Mooney.  "Rather than broad diversification, companies should focus on positioning their existing core businesses.  Don't invest in new capacity - squeeze every ounce of throughput you can through your existing assets; seek creative ways to manage your process and maintain a zeal for cost-cutting; invest in high value-added process technology; and seek innovative approaches to growth.  These are fundamental keys to creating value in the 90's."<P>

<H1>Consumer Intensive Businesses</H1>
<P>
<H3>FOOD BUSINESS REENGINEERING HERALDS HIGH TECH SALES,
DATA WAREHOUSING AND CONSOLIDATED SHIPPING FOR 1996</H3>
</center>

Reengineering in the sales, marketing and distribution of consumer products, in particular the food business, will begin producing new cost efficiencies through technology, consolidations and new marketing strategies in 1996, predicts a leading expert in consumer intensive businesses.<P>

"Consumer goods manufacturers will tear down their old sales structure, and re-invent and computerize the selling process, as part of fundamental changes in their business process.  This will result in less brokers and a leaner, more technologically proficient sales force," says Richard D. Furash, National Practice Director, Consumer Intensive Businesses for Deloitte & Touche Consulting Group.<P>

In making his 1996 forecast for consumer spending, Furash suggests watching two key factors:  Pending income tax legislation before Congress which may loosen individuals' purse strings through capital gains tax cuts and child credits, or a decision by consumers to decrease their personal debt loads which will reduce spending.<P>

With consumer spending patterns reaching a crossroads, 1996 seems a sure bet for at least some retail sectors to consider reengineering their business processes. Using the grocery business as an example, Furash noted that sales calls at individual stores are not as important as decisions made at a supermarket chain's headquarters.<P>

"We see dramatic changes happening in the supply chain in the year ahead and beyond," predicts Furash. "There will be more strategic alliances with manufacturers and (wholesale) customers to strip out costs and improve the flow of goods.  Point of sale information will be relied on more heavily."<P>

"This is part of the new, closer manufacturer-customer relationship," explains Furash.  "Manufacturers will be going directly to retailers for advice on the market and new product introductions.  No longer will we see upwards of 18,000 new products in a given year.  The dynamics have changed -- there's no more shelf space."<P>

"One of the major strategic issues emerging in 1996 in the food business will be the rethinking of that old standby, push marketing," says Furash.  "The grocery business has swung too far in the direction of push marketing, and obviously any changes come at the risk of alienating the customer at a time when other facets of the relationship are also shifting. Weaning customers away from incentives to stock more products than they need may prove difficult."<P>

"Manufacturers are looking to re-establish their brand identity through pull marketing, which relies on stimulating consumer trial through advertising, couponing and other consumer direct promotions," notes Furash.  "Push marketing, to the contrary, results in excess inventory going through distribution channels, products that consumers may not want."<P>

"Consolidated shipping" will be hot buzz words for 1996.  Furash sees some dramatic changes in the works.  "The logistics of product distribution are changing.  We will see the growth of multiple products from different vendors delivered by the same truck, as manufacturers begin outsourcing transportation distribution."<P>

"As part of this reengineering process, manufacturers will be moving toward eliminating forward warehouses," says Furash.  "Instead, they will ship to a wholesaler or someone else who will consolidate the product for reshipment with other products.  It is more cost effective to deliver mixed loads from various manufacturers to retail warehouses or to storage."<P>

"When reengineering a capital-intensive area, there comes one setback -- it doesn't translate into instant savings on the corporate balance sheet," Furash observes.  "That's because of the heavy investment the industry has in warehousing and distribution center facilities, equipment and trucks.  The resulting need to sell or write-off facilities means that the immediate impact on the profit and loss statement could well be negative because of "restructuring," although the efficiencies gained in the long-term represent a boost to the bottom line."<P>

<H2>Energy and Utilities</H2>
<P>

<H3>U.S. UTILITIES UNDERGOING FUNDAMENTAL TRANSFORMATION
INTO CUSTOMER-FOCUSED PROVIDERS OF ENERGY NEEDS </H3>
</center>
<P>


In 1996, customer choice and deregulation will drive the transformation of U.S. utilities from sleepy monopolies to customer-focused, market-savvy competitors, according to John Higley, National Practice Director, Utilities for Deloitte & Touche Consulting Group.  Those utilities that can make the change will prosper, those that cannot will not be able to compete.<P>

The areas to watch in 1996, according to Higley, will be the following:<P>

<ul><li><b>Customer Choice</b><P>
Mirroring developments in the long distance telephone carrier arena, legislation from the federal level will establish time frames or levels for increasing competition, allowing all retail customers to have complete choice of providers/suppliers for all energy commodities such as electricity and natural gas.  Concurrently, more utilities will launch energy service and/or retail companies to establish customer relationships both inside and outside their service territory.<P>


<li><b>Mindset Shift</b><P>
	The new competitiveness of the utilities will necessitate a fundamental shift from a 	monopolistic mindset to one almost akin to a consumer products company.  As choice is 	offered to customers, utilities will be in the new position of having to convince customers 	that they are the best choice, which will necessitate marketing, market analysis, public 	relations, etc.<P>

<li><b>Convergence -- External and Internal</b><p>
Convergence in this industry is really running two ways.  Examples of convergence with forces external to the industry include information technology, telecommunications and wireless areas.  Internal to the industry, utilities must think of themselves as energy
providers.  From a customer-focused standpoint, it makes more sense to pay a single consolidated utility bill, rather than five separate ones for gas, electric, or water, etc.


<li><b>Regulatory</b><P>
The first, and probably most significant, event will be an open access ruling from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, (FERC), which will establish the regulations by which the wholesale market for power generation and the transport of power generation will operate.  The ruling's significance will be the tone it sets for the rest of deregulation.<P>


<li><b>Globalization</b><P>
U.S. utilities will continue to buy regional electric distribution companies as privatization proceeds in other countries.  U.S. utilities have the capital and know-how, and are looking for new ways to either maintain or increase their earnings growth.<P>


<li><b>Power Plant Purchases</b><P>
More power plants will be bought by U.S. utilities in 1996.  Utilities have been operating some of the world's most efficient and effective power plants, and should therefore be able to make productivity improvements that will ultimately increase earnings for stockholders.<P>


<li><b>Mergers and Acquisitions</b><P>
This past year there have been more mergers and acquisitions announcements than in any other year, and 1996 might see some acceleration in this area as companies jockey for critical mass and market positioning.<P>


<li><b>The Information Superhighway</b><P>
In 1996, utilities will solidify their plans as to whether they can or should participate in the information superhighway.  One scenario might be alliances or joint ventures with telecom companies that help position the utility to take advantage of their customer base.<p>


<li><b>High Tech Innovations</b><P>
In the coming years, more utilities will take advantage of technology and move, for example, to automated meter reading from a cable or a wireless. Wireless technologies will be used to enhance customer service and, therefore, customer satisfaction.<P>


<li><b>Downsizing vs. Productivity</b><P>
A number of utilities have already downsized, "rightsized, or wrongsized" but very few utilities have actually improved their processes and, consequently, actual productivity improvements.  This applies both in the power generation segment as well as in the distribution and customer segments.<P>

<li><b>Disaggregation and Restructuring</b><p>
The next thing to watch in our industry next year is going to be the disaggregation of the vertically-integrated utility.  Will a utility actually spin-off its power generation into a separate company or sell it outright?  That will be a significant issue as the industry moves forward in this "brave new world."</ul>

<P>
<H3>BANK MERGERS TO JUMP BY 50% IN 1996, EXPERT PREDICTS
PREMIUMS FOR ACQUISITIONS AS BANKS OPT FOR SCALE</H3></center>
<P>


"Nineteen ninety-six is the year of the buyer.  Banks are fired up about mergers, and targets are commanding a premium right now," says Frank Woosley, National Practice Director, Banking for Deloitte & Touche Consulting Group.<P>

Woosley predicts that the pace of bank mergers will jump 50% in 1996.  Following closely on the heels of the $8 billion or more mega mergers in '95, mergers will accelerate because of the mindset among financial executives to create scale.  Many in the banking community believe that bigger banks are better positioned to fund the investment in the technology that is required to stay competitive in today's market.<P>

But while banks are in a marrying mood, some at least are finding that the honeymoon with shareholders may be short lived.  "We are going to see a heightened militancy from the investor market," says Woosley.  "Not all of the mergers make sense, and some that have made sense have been mismanaged.  When you get down to the quadrant of the mergers that made sense and have been well-managed, the stocks of those banks will trade at a premium."<P>

"But the other three-quadrants are going to struggle," says Woosley.  "They're not going to able to achieve the economies that they've predicted and a growing number of shareholders are becoming disgruntled.  And this may be expected, since for the past few years we've seen heightened acquisition activity, but have yet to see substantially improved performance other than just the acquisitions.  The shareholders are beginning to say, 'Where's the beef?'"<P>

"Over the next two years, we will see who some of the winners and losers are in the bank merger process as the results become apparent," says Woosley.<P>

"The ideal merger is between two banks that combined can yield savings, reduce administrative expenses, and have great growth prospects," says Woosley.  "A bank combination that only reduces costs or only offers growth will have a difficult time making the merger work.  A successful merger will be driven by organizations that can do both, and can demonstrate value."<P>

"In the case of two banks covering the same market, there may be a rationale for a cost-reduction driven merger, such as the Chemical-Chase Manhattan merger," notes Woosley.  "So much of their infrastructure overlapped that they can turn this into an opportunity for cost reduction and can demonstrate a lot of savings.  The Fidelity and First Union merger doesn't demonstrate as much savings, perhaps, but shows real chances to increase revenue."<P>

Woosley says that the merger winners will be defined by their ability to create and grow revenue, a key to creating shareholder value.  "Banks must be able to focus on the customer base and customer segments.  <i>The bank that knows which customers will buy which products through which delivery channel, at a price that exceeds the banks' cost, will win.</i>  That will be the most dominant characteristic of the successful bank," says Woosley.<P>

As banks re-orient their marketing and operational strategies to do more with less people and meet the challenge of non-bank financial services, Woosley sees an accelerated transition to electronic delivery.  "Banks are beginning to entice customers to use electronic delivery and this will speed the transition," Woosley says.  "Ten years ago there were no cellular phones and today there are 23 million.  The biggest driver was the giveaway of cellular phones, at a cost of $300-$400.  That's an incentive to try the service, and once you have you can't live without it.  Both banks and non-bank providers 
of financial services are doing the same thing -- using incentives to transition customers into electronic services."<P>

"We'll see the non-bank competitors and the non-traditional delivery systems become much more aggressive about getting customers to try things outside the norm," Woosley adds.  "I don't  believe that the challenge is going to come from Microsoft, because they have their hands full in other areas.  Intuit/Quicken is making arrangements with banks to provide services."<P>

"While those non-traditional providers will have an impact, it's not a mega-trend," says Woosley.  "And the challenge to banking will emerge from organizations that we don't know right now.  The interesting thing about the networks is that the providers can be no name cottage industries or boutique banks.  An organization can step-up and grab a 20% market share and we still won't know their names, because it could actually be 650 different organizations doing a similar activity."<P>

Just as banks are changing their methods of service delivery, incorporating high tech and consolidating their ranks into operations of larger scale, one of the issues they are considering is how to use their big infrastructure to serve their customers.  Woosley believes that one way banks will go is to "open up their network and let other organizations provide products or provide customers to the network.  When that begins to happen, we'll see more highly specialized boutique firms participating in the design and delivery of banking services," Woosley adds, noting that this trend will escalate in the near future.<P>

"The new order in banking today is to learn and understand what customers want that banks can deliver, and for the banks to deliver it," says Woosley.  "If they want something a bank can't deliver, the bank should introduce them to somebody who can -- and take a transaction fee for doing it."<P>

As predicted in the firm's report, "The Future of Retail Banking," deregulation will continue to transform the landscape of retail banking -- fostering industry fragmentation, allowing new entrants to compete and forcing banks to focus their activities.  Moreover, banks will disaggregate into a series of businesses falling into three main categories: <b>Customer Gateways</b> (relationships and access channels), where banks source products from third parties and sell them into their client base; <b>Product Formulators</b>, divisions or stand-alone companies which focus exclusively on a narrow range of product categories such as mortgage or savings; and <b>Industry Servicers</b>, entities supplying specialty services such as debt collection and predictive modeling to the retail banking industries.<P>

Looking at the global banking scene, Woosley believes that American banks can make major inroads in Western European markets.  "With all of the false starts towards unification, the traditional European resistance to cross borders may now be overcome," says Woosley.  "The population's desensitized to cross-border banking, so the opening exists, yet there's no one currently set up to capitalize on it.  As a result, there's a tremendous amount of opportunity here in 1996."<P>

<P>
<H3>NEW HEALTH CARE INITIATIVES
FROM INDUSTRY AND GOVERNMENT IN 1996</H3></center>


"Health care reform issues will once again be at the top of the Washington legislative agenda in 1996 as Congress and the President wrestle with Medicare and Medicaid.  In the meantime, the private sector will speed ahead with its own market reform, particularly in managed care," predicts Robert Go, National Practice Director, Health Care for Deloitte & Touche Consulting Group.<P>

"There are two major fronts to watch in 1996," says Go.  "First, we should expect to see continued competitive intensity in the industry."  Go says that competition will be marked by the following trends:<P>

<ul><li>Relatively flat health care premiums with some markets continuing to experience premium decline;<P>
<li>Continued growth in managed care as commercial health plans seek to enter new markets in order to offset saturated positions in their existing markets; and<P>
<li>Public health facilities transforming themselves in order to compete in a more privatized environment.</ul><P>

With continued intensity of competition in managed care and the maturation of the industry, Go says many industry watchers are asking, "What is the next evolution of the health care industry?  Will managed care organizations progress from focusing on managing payments and financial incentives to developing new ways to manage clinical care?"<P>

"With the industry facing these challenges, we can expect to see new initiatives in the year ahead," says Go.  "One of the most significant business issues will be putting theories of managed care more fully into practice."<P>

"We will see changes which move beyond the development of new insurance product designs or payment methodologies," says Go.  "The goal now is real change in the cost infrastructure of the industry that will further rationalize supply imbalances and accelerate the development of clinical protocols and programs to improve accountability for quality of care."<P>

"Another major front to watch in 1996 is legislative reform," says Go.  "In Washington, Republicans have picked up the reform torch from President Clinton and are running with it.  The health care industry can expect a federal health care reform package, focused on Medicare and Medicaid, that is based upon elements of the current federal budget bill for fiscal year 1996."<P>

Elements of this package will likely include:<P>

<ul><li>Incentives for Medicare patients to join HMOs and other managed care programs;<P>
<li>Reduced and restructured Medicare payments to hospitals and physicians;<P>
<li>Shifting of administrative and financial management of the Medicaid program, with significant changes, to the states.</ul><P>

"An interesting development to follow is the inclusion of Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs) in the Medicare Program," says Go.  "Historically, MSAs have been a controversial type of coverage, with proponents espousing the virtues of consumer accountability for costs and opponents expressing concerns over the potential for adverse selection among health plans."<P>


"Hampered by tax laws which have not favored MSAs in the private sector and a Medicare program which has not included MSAs as an option for enrollees, MSAs have been in relatively limited use in the past," says Go.  "However, new legislation could catapult MSAs into the mainstream, beginning with Medicare."<P>

<H2>High Technology</H2>
<P>
<H3>MORE DEMAND, MORE CAPACITY FORECAST IN 1996 FOR HIGH TECH INDUSTRIES, SAYS DELOITTE & TOUCHE CONSULTING GROUP</H3></center>

The healthy outlook for high technology in 1996 is best symbolized by the construction of at least nine billion dollars worth of new semi-conductor fabrication plant capacity in the U.S.  The dramatic market growth of 1995 will carry through next year, assuring rising demand for these devices and their timely absorption into the market, predicts Darvis Cormier, National Practice Director, High Technology Manufacturing for Deloitte & Touche Consulting Group.<P>

"Industrial and private consumers will benefit from the continued downward spiral in the cost of technology and the concurrent advances in ever more powerful electronics componentry," says Cormier, adding, "While there will be major new product breakthroughs such as DVD (digital video discs) in 1996, there will be a continued escalation in using technological advances to improve functionality and broaden the applications of such products as home control systems, burglar alarm systems, automotive systems, consumer electronics, communications and appliances."<P>

Among the more important new high tech product introductions that are expected during 1996 is what Cormier calls the "personal network device," which offers a very basic screen, keyboard, limited computing power and a network interface.  He also foresees  more powerful versions of the PDA (personal digital assistant) coming to market.<P>

On the PC software side of the industry, the key trend is consolidation.  Many competitive developments are occurring around Internet products, suite software, and client server related software that will drive companies to rapidly acquire emerging technology.<P>

"On the business software side, we will see continued innovation in client server technology and the introduction of integrated enterprise systems, a family of integrated application systems on these platforms.  The marketplace for such integrated information systems, which offer broader solutions capability, will flourish in 1996," says Cormier.  The growth of these new products will partially come at the expense of point specific solutions -- also called "Best of Breed" although popular until now, offer solutions to only one specific set of business activities.<P>

Contrary to the views of many industry analysts, Cormier believes that the sale of computers will continue to grow in 1996, although the growth pace will not be as dramatic as it was during much of the '90s.<P>

"There's a tremendous market in the U.S. and overseas that has not yet been satisfied," says Cormier.  "We've only scratched the surface in home computer sales in the U.S.  A significantly larger portion of the home population will acquire their first home computer or add their second in 1996, while business use continues to expand.  Computers are a must for children and teenagers because they're becoming an integral part of their education and entertainment activities.  Home computers are critical for people taking work home from the office and are gaining popularity as a family educational and financial tool."<P>

"On the global side, sales for virtually every type of computing device will increase dramatically in the next few years," predicts Cormier.  "Computers will become ubiquitous, like televisions and autos."<P>

The speed of technological advances in the PC industry, combined with the compressed product/model life cycle to six months or less, has increased pressure on computer makers to stay on the cutting edge of the market.<P>

"The bottom line is that certain companies that will continue to excel and dominate the PC marketplace will be firms who can compress time to market and stay on top with the next "hot box" in each product wave," says Cormier, noting that a variety of aggressive business strategies are being deployed to gain competitive advantage.<P>

Cormier foresees continued demand, with slower growth rates for the mainframe computer business.  While the number of suppliers has consolidated, IBM's market share has increased dramatically and its mainframe sales grew ten percent during 1995.<P>

The global outlook for high tech is more promising for U.S. companies than it has been in decades because of very impressive advances in global competitiveness.<P>

Noting the "much higher cost of manufacturing in Japan and Germany, and the fact that productivity increases in the U.S. are taking place at a more rapid rate than they are in these two countries, we are rapidly moving ahead of them in the race for cost advantage," says Cormier, adding that the current yen valuation also hurts Japan trade.<P>

Cormier gives further credit to the fact that while U.S. companies have made productivity gains and cost efficiency gains, many Western European countries have placed a greater emphasis on a stable managed economy.  In Western Europe, employment equals economic stability.<P>

"In the U.S., by comparison, the economy is competitive.  Everybody who operates in  U.S. marketplaces understands that they have to be able to react to competitive pressures rapidly as a matter of survival," says Cormier.<P>

Competition and the quest for the next big breakthrough will continue to be a driver behind more U.S. companies making mergers, acquisitions and strategic alliances in "search of the complementary service or technology in 1996," Cormier predicts.<P>

Recalling the deregulation cycle in telecommunications (T-Comm) that swept the U.S. for the past decade, Cormier foresees the beginning of a wave of global deregulation, "one country at a time" that will in turn create overseas marketing opportunities for big, U.S.-based telecom equipment manufacturers.  As each country's T-Comm infrastructure is deregulated, the result will follow the trends found in the US; lower prices, competition,  and increased innovation.  This phenomenon will create new opportunities for U.S. and global T-Comm manufacturers.<P>

Looking further into the future, Cormier predicts that the once dominant IBM will re-emerge with new information technologies and competitive efficiency.<P>

"They are re-arming technologically and are now making significant structural and strategic changes in the enterprise," says Cormier.  "IBM is positioned to re-emerge as a dominant technology company, a reality that will hurt its competitors."<P>

"Some of the challenges for IBM include being able to migrate their proprietary AS400 server family -- the world's largest installed computer system to a UNIX-based system," Cormier notes.  "At the same time they must also grow their RS6000 family.  The successful positioning of one of these server product families would enable them to re-emerge as a major network client server solution provider and fend off the competitive challenges of other network computing companies."<P>

In other market developments, Cormier sees some traditional PC technology leaders becoming key network solution providers and focusing resources on becoming a major player in the enterprise application marketplace in the same way they pursued the desktop business.  The continued innovation of the 8086 architecture will continue to dominate.<P>

<HR size=1>
<H2>Manufacturing</H2>
<P>
<H3>U.S. MANUFACTURERS NEED TOP TALENT
TO MEET CHALLENGE OF GLOBAL COMPETITION</H3></center>
<P>


"In a world of ever-shorter product cycles and nimble global competitors who can quickly copy new technology innovations, it's the three T's -- talent, training and teamwork -- that win," says Michael J. Fradette, National Practice Director, Manufacturing for Deloitte & Touche Consulting Group, in presenting his outlook for U.S. manufacturing for the year ahead.  "There's only one differentiable element in global competition anymore -- who's got the better people."<P>

"Entering 1996, American industry is reaching a competitive crossroad," says Fradette.  "One of the keys to keeping America competitive with its global trading partners is raising the level of primary and secondary public education in this country. We must raise the bar and match our competitors, like Japan and the Pacific Rim tiger countries, which put a very high premium on public education."<P>

"While our graduate schools are the most advanced, and continue to attract students from abroad for our MBA-like training, American companies have a clear problem because our educational system does not produce a workforce that can run the factories.  Our ability to compete in the future depends on the strength of our workforce."<P>

Following the successful reengineering efforts of many manufacturers, Fradette says that one of the biggest questions facing the industrial sector in 1996 is, "Where to grow?"<P>

"American industry must place its bets and pick its spots carefully based on their strategies for growth," suggests Fradette.  "Sustaining growth is more complex than it was ten years ago.  Today, 
it requires a mastery of the human resources component and the ability to apply technology, after the reengineering and right-sizing is completed, to produce even greater cost efficiencies."<P>

Fradette addressed a number of areas vital to the growth of markets for manufactured goods and the expanding global infrastructure of industrial operations:<P>

<ul><li><b>U.S. Economy</b><P>
The 1996 economy is hostage to Washington's ability to get the budget deficit under control, the direction of interest rates and capital gains relief.  Under the best scenario, with a strong 
budget agreement supported by the financial markets and lower interest rates, the economy could heat up, with growth reaching as high as 4%, if rates drop 50 basis points.  However, a 
prolonged budget battle could slow growth, and if interest rates were to increase 150 basis points in the absence of an acceptable budget agreement, the economy could hit a slowdown with growth of 1% to 2%. The ideal economic model requires greater cooperation between government and industry, on the order of our global competitors.<P>

<li><b>Cross-Border Economics</b><P>
Global trade expansion is sometimes more concept than reality.  There is a natural tendency for companies to look to expand sales with neighboring countries, while many espouse global expansion for their sales plans. This is true of Japan's targeting China, and English companies looking to expand sales across the channel in Europe, for example.<P>

U.S. companies have expanded their sales and manufacturing foothold in Canada and Mexico to a greater extent than Asia or Europe.  The past year however, has been a watershed for our major cross-border trading partners, following the financial crisis in Mexico and the nearly successful vote for separating Quebec.<P>

Given the close U.S. economic ties with Mexico and Canada, any economic, political or social instability in either partner can hurt the U.S. or at least certain sectors or companies.  In Canada, 
for example, the vote is in but the jury is still out on the effects of the Separatist initiative.  Automotive and telecommunications companies, which have substantial investments in Canada, companies who depend on the supply of natural resources could feel a ripple effect in 
the year ahead, because markets react adversely to uncertainty.  The already deflated Canadian dollar could be further depressed, further slowing trade and putting more of a chill on 
the investment environment.  The outcome of negotiations between Quebec and Ottawa could hurt cross-border commerce.<P>

In Mexico, the biggest problem following the plummeting peso is credit and credibility.  The $50 billion U.S. bailout is a short-term band-aid.  After the political assassinations, social unrest and ill-conceived currency devaluation, it will take five years for Mexico to convince the financial markets that they are credit-worthy.<P>

<li><b>Technology Helps The Global Corporation</b><P>
While regionalization of trade will continue to accelerate, global activity will increase in 1996 as technology has simplified international manufacturing operations and the management infrastructure to support it through electronically linked supply chains.  Using satellite technology, a company can site its programming operations in India, engineering in Germany, production in Taiwan and marketing in the U.S.<p>

Information technology and such related technologies as satellite communication, telecommunications, PCs, client server architecture, and other applications are making the corporation of the future more flexible, adaptable and positioned for a new era in global corporate operations.</ul><P>

<H2>Pharmaceutical/Medical Devices</H2>
<P>
<H3>COST EFFECTIVE NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND CUSTOMER FOCUSED MARKETING PROGRAMS EMPHASIZED AS
PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES AIM FOR GROWTH IN 1996</H3></center>
<P>
Cost effective product innovation and customer focused marketing programs will be key components of the business strategy of many pharmaceutical companies as they enter 1996 poised for growth.  There will be less emphasis on the cost containment initiatives that were successfully implemented in recent years, report three leading experts in their annual industry forecast, Robert L. Andrews, Mark H. Mozeson and R. Thomas Swem of the Deloitte & Touche Consulting Group's Pharmaceutical/Medical Devices industry practice.<P>

"In 1995, pharmaceutical companies were still looking primarily to cut costs," says Mozeson.   "Over the next year they can be expected to expand their focus.  A new thrust will be to initiate strategies to sustain and enhance growth.  That's why we will see a strong focus on R&D, new product delivery in unsatisfied therapeutic areas, and a positioning against managed care -- these will be the initiatives for 1996 and beyond."  Andrews continues, "Don't forget too, that many of the companies in this industry have attempted to reengineer their R&D functions in the last few years.  It is now time for the implemented improvements to pay off.  If the benefits don't start soon, senior management should be asking some very tough questions of their reengineers."<P>

"The pharmaceutical industry will continue its effort to cost effectively develop new drugs using alliances with biotech companies as well as mergers with other pharmaceutical companies that possess specific therapeutic expertise.  There are still some major therapeutic areas such as osteoporosis, AIDS, Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis, that have not been fully served by pharmaceutical innovation," Mozeson observes.<P>

Swem notes that "pharmaceutical and medical device companies will also look to find ways to partner with their customers.  They will do this by helping suppliers and manufacturers to demonstrate the value of their products, develop innovative risk sharing and capitation-based pricing, structuring joint ventures and the like."<P>

Adds Andrews, "Growth will also come from rapid entry into new global markets, such as China and Russia.  Pharmaceutical firms with proven market entry techniques and agile sales forces will capture share and gain customer loyalty.  Such activities, however, are not for the 'faint of heart' and must be entered into with clear-cut objectives and well-defined results."<P>

The structure of the health care industry is changing and for this reason their customer base is changing as well.  "On the marketing front, pharmaceutical companies can be expected to continue to refine their market segmentation strategies.  Strategies to market to emerging and growing integrated delivery systems and the managed care industry will become even more important in the coming year," notes Swem.<P>

"US markets are changing and consolidating to a considerable degree," Swem continues.  "Many providers and payors are merging and as they do they are increasingly interested in dealing with fewer, more full service vendors.  Distributors are becoming more important for the niche players as are "carve out" strategies for specialized product areas."<P>

One of the growing areas in the years ahead for pharmaceuticals is the application of disease management, which is still an emerging concept, and such other new ideas as capitation, risk sharing and creative contracting, which Andrews explains is part of an effort by pharmaceuticals to deal with market forces, and in particular, managed care.<P>

Andrews notes that more successful pharmaceutical firms are making strategic efforts to provide their primary clients -- large institutions -- with service offerings which complement their ability to sell their traditional product line while serving to strengthen their client relationships.<P>

Such services are an outgrowth of earlier health care reform initiatives considered by the government but are being driven by the growth of managed care programs, which have reduced industry profit margins by encouraging the use of generics, Mozeson and Andrews explained.<P>

"A few years ago, the regulatory forces came in and simply stirred the pot, and that is all they had to do," Mozeson explains.  "What followed was a great deal of pressure to reduce health care costs.  This in turn created opportunities for organizations (such as PBM's), and initiatives (such as Disease Management), that are aimed at helping payers and providers manage costs," says Mozeson.<P>

Mozeson noted that one problems with services like disease management is that, in the universe of managed care, there is a very compartmentalized approach to treatment and cost control.  "Today's provider and payer typically look at cost one component at a time, (e.g., pharmaceuticals, hospitalization, physician costs, etc.).  Disease Management is designed for those managing the cost of a disease, (e.g., ulcers, diabetes, etc.).  Outside of staff model HMO's, there are not too many other people who do that.  Until this trend is reversed, Disease Management will remain an emerging concept."<P>

Mozeson, Andrews and Swem offered their views of other key industry trends:<P>

<ul><li><b>Technological Advances</b><P>
There's a big trend toward trying to develop new information technology which can improve the collection and management of data and automate the preparation of documents in the process of getting the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for a new drug.  Present requirements call for "Phase III Clinical Trials" which demonstrate the safety and efficacy of a new drug.  So unwieldy is the approval process, says Mozeson, that the trials account for a significant part of drug development costs.  Such costs could be reduced with the help of new technology known as CANDA (Computer Assisted New Drug Application Systems).<P>

Swem notes that systems that are based upon the new and more powerful laptop computers with extensive telecommunications capabilities and high quality audio/video are rapidly becoming the standard for a fully automated sales force.  Companies without sophisticated Sales Force Automation (SFA) that provide their sales people with the latest in pricing, product features, dosing requirements, competitive comparisons and the like will begin to lose in this increasingly competitive industry.<P>

"Improved information management has become the 20th century's Holy Grail," notes Andrews.  "The problem is not the technology, but the magnitude of the implementation that frightens even the most determined senior management group into analysis paralysis.  Don't study things to death; implement improvements quickly, as the half lives of fundamental, revolutionary change is now about 3-4 years."<P>

<li><b>Generics and Patent Expiration</b><p>
The industry faces the loss of $35 billion of patent protected drugs for the decade beginning in 1996, to the generic market.  The rise of managed care programs is accelerating the move toward generic drugs which usually cost 50% less than their brand counterparts.  A growing number of companies will be focusing on their off-patent strategies to find ways to protect their market share and price position.<P>

<li><b>Election Year 1996</b><p>
      The Presidential election year always has a major impact on corporate decision making in the pharmaceutical industry, and this year will be no different, notes Andrews.  He adds that sensitivity to Medicaid/Medicare, welfare and health care reform are making top executives pay even more attention to election and primary results and opinion polls.<P>

 <li><b>International Expansion</b><P>
	As managed care and other competitive pressures continue to constrain the US market, we will see increasing interest in international markets, notes Swem.  As new markets emerge in China, India, Korea and other locations, a large percentage of worldwide growth will be outside the US.  Pharmaceutical and medical device companies will take steps to evaluate and expand their penetration internationally.<P>

<H3>FEDERAL-STATE FUNDING SHIFT WILL CREATE STATE POLICY AND IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES IN 1996</H3></center>
<P>


There is good news and bad news for state governments entering 1996 regarding the block grant and budget proposals now before Congress.<P>

The good news is that states will have much more freedom in setting policies and rules for many functions and services.<P>

The bad news is that federal aid to states will be slowed significantly and as a result, states will bear a much larger share of the costs of future program growth.  In some areas, such as K-12 education, public assistance and workforce preparation programs, federal funds will be cut.<P>

Fundamental changes in federal financing will prompt states and localities to adopt new management approaches in 1996, according to Deloitte & Touche Consulting Group.  As the federal government revamps dozens of intergovernmental grant programs ranging from health and welfare to public safety and transportation, executives at the state and local levels will find they have less red tape to contend with, but also less federal funding to augment their own revenues.  And they will be more accountable for delivering worthwhile results for each dollar spent.<P>

"Governors, county executives, mayor, and their department heads will respond by putting new emphasis on defining what they can and can't achieve; by developing performance measurement systems that track progress against these more realistic expectations; and by reengineering their procedures, organization, and staffing to permit more effective service delivery" say Jim Bedenko, National Practice Director, Public Sector and Larry Gustafson, National Partner, Public Sector for Deloitte & Touche Consulting Group.<P>

"The bottom line is that the business of state government will undergo some very dramatic changes.  The challenge is to be certain that those changes are well managed and produce positive results," says Mr. Bedenko.<P>

"We believe 1996 will be the turning point for the states.  They must confront and solve major political, policy, and logistical challenges," notes Bedenko.  "Because of the 'Contract With America,' the public sector will be the most dynamically changing sector of the economy for the next two to three years.  If the current proposals become law, the public sector would implement an unprecedented shift in social responsibility from the Federal Government to the states for the medical system and human services.  The magnitude of these changes and the demands they will place on state leaders and state systems should not be underestimated.<P>

"These changes are clearly driven by the goal of a balanced federal budget, but they are also part of a major change in philosophy.  The Feds are saying that they don't have all the answers; that they will leave more decisions to the states."<P>

"While the states would be given increased policy setting responsibilities for such programs as employment training, children's services, day care, public assistance and Medicaid, the federal budget savings nationwide over the next seven years will approach $20-30 billion per year," adds Gustafson.  "That is money the governors, county executives and mayors will have to do without.  The states are faced with the choice of doing more with less, reducing services drastically or making up the funding gap with their own funds.  Faced with the difficult choices ahead, state government can no longer do business as usual, and the state government managers will have to drastically change their way of managing."<P>

"The scale and timing of change is unprecedented.  Never before in history has government attempted to reform such a broad range of programs at a single time.  These programs deal with 
massive quantities of transactions and large numbers of people," says Bedenko.  "New federal requirements and state fiscal constraints will require significant changes in program structure, 
service components and eligibility.  These changes must be implemented almost immediately and without new financial resources.  With limited resources, states will have to dramatically reengineer their processes to deliver services using more technology and less people."<P>

"However, labor-intensive areas such as social programs which rely on case workers, for example, will prove more difficult targets for technological efficiencies and privatization," explains Bedenko.<P>

"Cost benefit analysis, privatization and automation will become the mantra for state government executives hard pressed to achieve economics," says Bedenko.<P>

Both Bedenko and Gustafson anticipate problems resulting from cost-cutting measures that do not fully account for their broad impact when implemented.  As an example, Bedenko cites the pending welfare reform legislation, which requires that higher percentages of all welfare recipients participate in work while capping federal funding.  In order to provide the increased service planning, client tracking, and supervision needed to meet new federal targets, some states may be forced to reduce benefit levels or divert resources from other high priority areas, such as error reduction or fraud prevention.<P>

"Changes under consideration in the Medicaid and Medicare programs are designed to slow the growth of health care costs, but these changes could also affect the survivability of hospitals and clinics everywhere," warns Bedenko.<P>

Gustafson adds, "Under the present (old) system, Federal transfer payments come with detailed specifications and entitlement requirements and rules.  An individual meeting the requirements today gets benefits that are specifically defined and regulated.  Whatever the state spends to provide the service, the Federal Government reimburses a portion of it."<P>

"Under the new rules, a capped block grant payment is given to the state.  This amount is fixed.  Regardless of how many people use the service, there are no more payments.  States are going to be challenged to continue providing service-as-usual."<P>

"While meeting these challenges will not be easy, there are encouraging signs that modern management tools can help get the job done.  States will need to move quickly to adopt reengineering and redesign principles that are proving successful in the private sector.  They will also need to use private sector help and expertise with their financial operations and information systems to deal not only with these changes, but also with the new layer of performance-based reporting requirements that the Federal Government is imposing with the block grants."<P>

"Policy makers must think long-term, and understand the implications before implementing policy," states Bedenko.  "A seemingly simple thing such as how you're going to reimburse a medical institution for their services may affect the availability of all services in a short time."<P>

"In the year ahead and beyond we will see state legislators besieged by different groups who will be fighting to protect their share of shrinking government resources," says Gustafson.  "The states will be forced to consider tough trade-offs and to make hard choices.  Where will prevention investments be made?  Who will receive subsidized child care?  What services and activities best promote employment?  Will we concentrate on young infants at the expense of programs that help teenagers?"<P>

Gustafson predicts that states will adopt more private sector practices, while the movement toward privatization will accelerate:  Economic pressures will force consolidations, better focus on the mission, and generate a demand for extensive information on best practices.  Performance management -- knowing the effectiveness and impact of expenditures on people and programs -- mission accomplishment, and the development of best practices in the field, will become integral to the theory and practice of state government.<P>

There's a need for a natural feedback loop to tell managers how they're managing with the resources they have, today, there's no way to measure whether they're getting the most bang for the buck.  Competition in the private sector provides vital information, but you can't have two different fire departments to measure which one can put out fires more cost effectively.  The lack of this comparative information leads to inefficiencies.<P>

To help manage efficiently in the new era of block grants, Gustafson recommends that the states establish a performance baseline to help put the new systems in place and monitor the progress and the mission in a critical manner, to allow for proper evaluation and comparison: The Federal Government should also assist in this effort and play a larger role in identifying and disseminating best practices.<P>

As seen by Deloitte & Touche Consulting Group, states and localities are in for a 1996 characterized by cutbacks and reforms, innovation and restructuring, pressure and accomplishment.  The Republican agenda calls for a new approach to intergovernmental relations and asks state and local officials to play different roles.  The "Devolution Revolution" will give them more discretion while confronting them with hard choices.  Today many are still in the early stages of planning for the changes that will soon reconfigure the federal system, and most are not yet certain how best to cope with the demands of the new era.  The most effective state and local executives will be those who treat the changes as an opportunity to exercise leadership -- leadership in redefining program missions and objectives, in using advanced information technology and reengineering to provide improved management and operations, and in focusing government's efforts on producing tangible results.  One thing is certain about 1996:  Only by doing things differently will state and local governments be successful under the conditions prescribed by new federal legislation.<P>

<P>
<H3>TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY 1996 OUTLOOK:  NEW SERVICES,
NEW INFRASTRUCTURE, NEW COMPETITION, AND NEW REGULATIONS</H3></center>
<P>


Destined to be a year of chaos in the telecommunications industry, 1996 will see dramatic changes in markets, regulations, and technology.  Whether new communications legislation is signed or not, current telecommunications carriers will be challenged to find new markets and services capable of generating revenues that are sufficient not only to make up for unavoidable losses in core businesses, but also to register net gains in the future.  At the same time, new entrants into the industry will have to devise and implement plans to provide quality service at competitive prices in order to attain enough market share to remain in the game.<P>

"The revolution in telecommunications services will increase in 1996," says William H. Gaik, National Practice Director, Telecommunications at Deloitte & Touche Consulting Group.  "Every line of business in the whole arena of information, communications, and entertainment is likely to change.  It is crucial for telecommunications executives to invest the time to develop appropriate strategic assumptions."<P>

Dwight L. Allen, Jr., Associate National Director, Telecommunications and David J. Roddy, Ph.D., Chief Telecommunications Economist at Deloitte & Touche Consulting Group, also reflected on the telecommunications industry outlook for 1996.  "The competitive effect of legislation on local service providers and the convergence industries will be substantial," says Mr. Allen.  "The telecommunications landscape of 1996 will have fewer borders than ever before.  We will see the construction of new infrastructures, new communications hubs, and new webs to connect them."  Dr. Roddy added, "Wireless technologies continue to make explosive new inroads in the marketplace.  This part of the telecommunications industry is probably the fastest growing industry in the world.  Literally hundreds of players are vying for a piece of the action."<P>

Mr. Gaik, Mr. Allen, and Dr. Roddy offer these insights into the telecommunications industry for 1996:<P>


<ul><li><b>Communications Act Reform</b><P>

"I believe there is a 60 percent chance the President will sign new telecommunications legislation in the coming months," says Mr. Gaik.  "Congress knows that if it fails to act soon, it will be relegated to the sidelines -- the rules governing the telecommunications sector are going to be written by technology, competition, the states and the courts."<P>

"Even if legislation is passed, 1996 will see more regulatory proceedings and more litigation than actual competition," according to Mr. Gaik.  The new law will promote competition but not by deregulation.  Congress has defined certain standards and tests that have to be met and it will take a while for the regulators and the competitors to sort out what constitutes full compliance with these new rules.<P>

<li><b>MFJ Restrictions on Baby Bells</b><P>

The pending Communications Act reform legislation would override the remaining market restrictions imposed on the Bell companies by the 1982 antitrust decree known as the Modification of Final Judgment (MFJ).  Under the legislation, Bell companies meeting certain conditions would be permitted to offer long distance service.  Even without legislation, court decisions could bring about the liberalization of the controls.<P>

How will competition shape up in the long distance market once the MFJ provisions are lifted?  "Competition won't be entirely on a service-by-service basis," Mr. Allen contended.  "I expect that consumers and businesses increasingly will buy packages of services that include combinations of local and long distance telephone service, wireless service, cable TV service, and Internet service -- and perhaps electricity and home monitoring services as well."<P>

Long distance carriers, wireless carriers, cable TV operators, computer companies, and others are already forging alliances for this new form of competition.<P>

<li><b>Local Exchange Competition</b><P>

"The year 1996 will be a transitional period when the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the state public utility commissions (PUCs), and the industry define the specific rules and review procedures covering the interconnection of telephone company networks and the networks of their competitors," said Mr. Allen.  "There are already some examples of ad hoc agreements between telephone companies and competitors such as Teleport and Metropolitan Fiber Systems, and we will probably see some more of those, but the pace won't really pick up nationally until these rules are worked out."<P>

"Costs will be a crucial issue in 1996," added Dr. Roddy.  "There are two reasons for this.  First, regulators and competitors will demand that telephone companies charge fairly for connecting rivals to their networks, and in order to judge the reasonableness of their charges you have to define the relevant costs."  "Second," Dr. Roddy continued, "to compete effectively, telephone companies will have to understand their costs for specific services, organizational units, and geographic areas.  Defining costs in this industry is still extremely complicated and contentious, and there will be much debate about cost accounting both in the regulatory setting as well as inside telephone companies."<P>

<li><b>Universal Service</b><P>

"Universal service is going to be a major concern in 1996 whether the Communications Act reform goes through or not," said Mr. Gaik.  While the ultimate shape of the new universal service policy will not be known by the end of 1996, Mr. Gaik believes one aspect is a good bet.  "I think it's likely that the FCC and state commissions will overhaul the program to include both existing incumbents as well as new entrants," he said.  "The annual amount needed for subsidies will be computed and then the telephone companies and their competitors will be told how much they have to contribute to cover that amount."<P>

<li><b>Wireless Telephone</b><P>

1996 will be the year of wireless telephony.  Over the past five years, the wireless telecommunications industry has seen dramatic changes in most of the world.  In the United States, for example, cellular subscriber growth has far surpassed all expectations, with annual subscriber growth rates of 40 and 50 percent.  Dr. Roddy sees a strong and continuing demand for wireless telephony as a way to free residents from the tyranny of "waiting for an important call."  At the same time, wireless technology also offers a way for businesses to reengineer their operations to provide better service at lower cost.<P>

The highlight of 1996 will be the buildout of the wireless infrastructure which uses the new PCS radio frequencies which the FCC auctioned earlier this year for $8 billion.  This new spectrum capacity will lead to a variety of wireless telephone, paging, and wireless cable services by existing local, long distance, and cable TV companies.  A controversial issue involves the difficulties that some of the smaller new entrants will encounter as the government attempts to diversify the ownership of the communications infrastructure in the U.S.  The FCC is now involved in auctions of additional spectrum for smaller companies using both the PCS, SMR, and MDS technologies.  At the same time, there are discussions involving an auction or trade of broadcast TV spectrum.  "In 5 years, there could easily be an excess supply of spectrum," Roddy said, "and that will cause both prices and profits to decline; it is difficult to see a strong role for the small company in that scenario."<P>

<li><b>Globalization</b><P>

In 1996, telecommunications companies will dramatically increase their focus on non-U.S. markets.  Roddy notes that most global economic growth is forecast to take place outside of the U.S. in the next ten years.  For example, the rate of economic growth in the Pacific Rim alone is likely to be four times that of the U.S. for the next five years.  Roddy observed, "Half the people in the world have never made a phone call; this huge potential market abroad makes the U.S. look small in comparison."<P>

Other markets in Latin America and Eastern Europe are also expected to be hotbeds of telecommunications activity.  It is no wonder that U.S. based telecommunications companies are extremely active in setting up deals offshore.  We expect this trend to accelerate in 1996 and years following.<P>

<li><b>Video and Cable TV</b><p>

The video industries will continue their roller-coaster on-again, off-again ride in 1996.  Roddy observed, "Overall, we expect to see more telephone company acquisitions and alliances in the wireless cable and plain-vanilla cable TV marketplace as video dialtone is put on the back burner and telephone companies continue their diversification efforts.  We could see a mega-merger between cable and telco in 1996."<P>

At the same time, cable TV companies' plans for high speed data access to the Internet via coax are in full swing as cable jumps on the World Wide Web bandwagon.  And Direct Broadcast Satellite - which beams over 150 cable TV channels to small dishes on the roof - has accumulated more than a million customers in a record period of time.  Both of these markets should do well in 1996.<P>

Government regulation will play a continuing role.  Congress is considering changes in the cable TV rate regulations as part of new communications legislation; and the FCC will soon begin addressing how telephone companies should separate the costs of providing telephone service from the costs of the new video capabilities that they plan to offer consumers.<P>

<li><b>Internet</b><p>

As recently as a year ago the Internet's potential was hardly recognized.  "The popularity of the Internet was no more foreseen by anyone in the computer or telecommunications fields than the destruction of the Berlin Wall was foreseen by all the world's intelligence agencies," Mr. Allen said.  But the Internet is big today -- with an estimated 33 million users -- and he sees rapid growth in 1996 as well.  As businesses start to use the net as a medium for electronic commerce, and as credit card security issues are resolved, demand could easily continue at its current record pace for the next five years.<P>

But there will be a lot of competition as alternative access vendors attempt to jump on the Internet bandwagon.  Mr. Allen stated, "The telephone companies and cable TV operators will vie to be the solution to the big problem with the Internet: the time it takes for photos, songs, video clips, and other information-rich files to move from a network server to the home computer."  In 1996, customers in more and more markets will find themselves deciding whether to invest in a faster modem, subscribe to a new high-speed telephone service called ISDN, or turn to their cable TV providers for improved Internet connections.</ul><P>

<H3>NON-STORE RETAILING, CHAIN STORE CONSOLIDATION AND GLOBALIZATION, AND VALUE SHOPPING EXPECTED TO DRIVE RETAILING DURING 1996</H3></center>
<P>


"More consolidations among retail chain stores, driven both by bankruptcies and mergers mean that U.S. consumers will see fewer store names, while the winners continue searching abroad for new locations during 1996," predicts Harvey D. Braun, Co-Chairman and National Partner, Trade for Deloitte & Touche Consulting Group.<P>

"Today, more than ever, people in retail are eating each other's lunch," says Braun.  "There will continue to be extraordinary pressures on the marketplace as consumers choose from more efficient discounters such as price clubs, off-price outlet centers or non-store retailing such as mail order, home shopping TV channels and, increasingly, interactive shopping over the Internet."<P>

Braun targets the following areas which retailers must address to ensure their near-term profitability and competitiveness:<P>

<ul><li><b>Competitiveness</b><P>
      Stores can not survive by price alone.  It is essential to offer the best value but, as many have discovered, without an adequate profit margin, stores can discount themselves out of business. Reengineering "creating more operational cost efficiencies and using greater buying leverage with vendors" is a major survival tool.  While consumers demand bargains, they also expect merchandise selection, knowledgeable help and fast checkout service in addition to good lighting and store design.  Given the degree of competition, many retailers are searching for new merchandising formats to generate consumer excitement, including the use of more entertainment in the shopping experience and introducing new store formats.<P>

<li><b>Globalization</b><p>

Globalization will be the single biggest expansion opportunity for retailers in 1996, thanks in part to the combined economic effects of the GATT and NAFTA agreements.  U.S. stores will accelerate their expansion plans north and south of the border.  With Quebec remaining part of Canada, and the economic and political climate stabilizing in Mexico, we're going to see much more cross-border expansion.  There also will be more Canadian retailers going to Mexico.<P>

<li><b>Interactive Retailing</b><P>

Retailing on-line is swiftly moving from concept to reality.  A growing number of retailers are taking the plunge as they increase their focus on such areas as relationship and database marketing programs to reach their customers.  These programs also represent an opportunity for retailers to differentiate themselves from a service perspective.<P>

<li><b>High-end and Low-end Flourish</b><P>

The retail sector will continue undergoing the present bifurcation, as the high-end chains and the "value" stores experience growth at the expense of the sagging middle-market chains during 1996.<P>

<li><b>Reengineering the Supply Chain</b><P>

For many stores, there is a need to restructure many operational areas.  One of the most important is the supply chain.  It is important to examine everything from the source of goods to inventory 
management and controls all the way to the final sale of the product.  Every element of the process must be challenged, not just for 1996, but as part of an ongoing commitment to cost control and logistics management.<P>

<li><b>Help from Washington</b><P>

In the present retailing environment, consumers are holding back their spending, in part because of resistance to further debt spending.  The combination of a Federal income tax cut and a reduction in 
interest rates by the Federal Reserve would obviously provide a tremendous boost to retailers across the board in 1996.  Such a boost to the economy would also increase employment and raise consumer confidence.</ul><p>

<P>   You've entered a beautiful city with much to offer tourists and residents.  This Texas Gulf Coast city, is bathed in sunlight year-round.  Gulf breezes fill the air, as temperatures average in the mid sixties in winter, seventies in spring and the nineties in summer.<P>  
<P>Our city has a wide variety of attractions, natural beauty and culture.  Visit the many museums, the historic Lexington, the Texas State Aquarium, replicas of the Columbus ships and beautiful Padre Island National Seashore.  Hotels and condominiums offer waterfront views of the bay and the long rows of privately-owned boats docked at the bay front.<P>
<P>From water sports like sailing and windsurfing, to birding and deep-sea fishing, to world-class golf, the area is filled with activities for the entire family.  Rent a bicycle and ride along the seawall, or tour historic homes.  Shopping is a favorite activity with  quaint little shops along water street, and the upscale clothing boutiques on the Southside of town. There's plenty of activity at night too... local eateries offer regional seafood and authentic Mexican dishes, as well as many other interesting kinds of international cuisine.<P>
<P>For residents and visitors, Corpus Christi is a beautiful place to be!  For more information on Corpus Christi, please e-mail your request to woolford@trip.net, or look for e-mail addresses in the following pages of information on real estate and lodging, shopping and attractions.<P>

<H4>
<P>
Port Aransas has been selected a 
<A HREF="http://www.visit-usa.com"><iMG SRC="vacation.gif" align="center" border=0></IMG></A>
<BR>One of the best vacation sites on the World Wide Web!
</P>

<P>
On the Texas Coast, along the warm tropical beaches of the Gulf of Mexico <BR> sits an island paradise. It is a day's drive from nearly anywhere in Texas, and <BR>the Corpus Christi International Airport is less than fifty minutes away.
</H4>
</P>

<iMG SRC="map2.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></IMG>
<BR>

<P>The natives are friendly. The seaside village atmosphere is quaint and fun. The fishing is <BR>incredible, whether it's a blue marlin that you want, sailfish, redfish, snapper, tuna or trout.<BR>The waters teem with them, while dolphins do acrobatics to entertain you.</P>

<iMG SRC="strip1.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></IMG>
<BR>

<P>Sunbathers and beachcombers will find miles of white sandy beaches, while surfers, boaters <BR>and sailors ply the waters. And, after the beach, sightseeing, birdwatching (over 500 species call <BR>Port "A" home.) or deep sea fishing trip, you'll find plenty of shops, stores and restaurants to <BR>tempt your wallet and your appetite.</P>

<iMG SRC="strip2.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></IMG>
<BR>

<P>Other activities are boating excursions, sunset cruises, horseback riding along the beach, <BR>lighted fishing piers, the ship channel jetties, the free ferry transportation to the mainland and <BR>dance/music clubs. You can even hop the trolley and ride around town.</P>

<P>Port Aransas has it all for the summer vacations. And, the tropical weather is perfect for <BR>spending time during the off season, sampling the local wildlife, and fun. Accommodations range <BR>from luxury condominiums and hotels, to RV parks and camping areas.</P>

<P>Pagan Lewis Motors in Corpus Christi, the Lincoln, Mercury, Jeep and Eagle dealer, is know for the widest selection and the best deals in autos in the area.  New, used and program cars offer the choices that South Texans look for.  With their top-of-the line service center, Pagan Lewis Motors is a winner in customer satisfaction.

<P>Sable is about to revolutionize automotive design. Again. Our approach to recreating it went to the very soul of the car. The resulting all new Sable features a high level of craftsmanship and quality you can see, hear and feel. It has a fluid look and satisfyingly solid feel. In fact, Sable will leave you with the impression that it was formed from a single piece of steel. This is a car quite unlike anything you've ever driven before.</P>

<H3>
<P>&#183; Computer-Aided Engineering - to help Sable take a quantum leap forward in design, performance and quality.</P> 

<P>&#183; One-Piece Bodyside Stamping - This creates better door fit, reduced water and wind leaks, tighter tolerances and contributes to Sable's overall solid feeling.</P>

<P>&#183; Cross-Car Beam - for greater structural stiffness, a quieter, smoother ride, better handling, and an extra degree of safety, especially during a side impact.</P>

<P>&#183; Safety Cell - this integrates a network of steel beams into a protective, impact-absorbing system to make. Sable's body shell is 60% more rigid than previous models.</P>

<P>&#183; Triple Door Seals - reduce both wind noise and water leaks and give the door a quality, tight-fitting sound when it's shut.</P>

<P>&#183; No Adjust Build - raises Sable's dimensional integrity to a new level.

Texas Association of Realtors Honors Joe Adame for 
&quot;Deal of the Year&quot;
</H1>
<H4>
by Jeff Woolford, Editor
</H4>
<P>Native Corpus Christian and local commercial realtor Joe Adame was presented the William Jennings Lone Star<BR>
 Trophy Award for &quot;The Year's Outstanding Commercial Transaction&quot; at the Texas Association of Realtors<BR>
 annual statewide convention held in Corpus Christi in September. Adame is the first Corpus Christi realtor to<BR>
 win the title in the award's 13-year history.<BR>
<P>Beating out real estate dealmakers in Dallas, Fort Worth and Houston for the coveted distinction, Adame was
 selected based on his &quot;handshake deal&quot; to sell Corpus Christi's tallest, most prestigious, twin-tower office
 complex, One Shoreline Plaza.
<P>Adame, the son of a Corpus Christi pharmacist, called upon the resources of friends, a former teacher, twenty
 years of real estate business experience and his Christian faith to broker the on-again-off-again sale and creative
 financing of One Shoreline Plaza for Kumagai Gumi Co. Ltd, a Japanese construction company that owned the
 building. 
<P>One Shoreline Plaza, constructed at a cost of $60 million and opened in 1988, includes a 28-story tower and a
 22-story tower. The larger tower rises 411 feet to qualify as the tallest building in Corpus Christi. At the time of
 sale in March of this year, the office complex was reported to be about 53 percent occupied. More than 160,000
 square feet was then unoccupied, some unfinished.
<P>The new owners are TGFW, L.P. (Three Guys from Wichita), a Wichita investment partnership comprised of
 Dan Carney, owner of the original Pizza Hut; Ken Wagnon, one of the largest Pizza Hut franchisees; and Herb
 Krumsick, senior vice president of J. P. Weigand &amp; Sons, the largest commercial and residential real estate
 brokerage firm in Kansas. 
<P>Krumsick stated the new owners plan to spend about $5 million over the next three years to finish out vacant
 building interior space for new tenants. Joe Adame &amp; Associates, Inc. is the leasing agent. 
<P>Joe Adame began his real estate career in Corpus Christi in 1969 after graduating from Sam Houston State
 University. &quot;I had my real estate license two days and sold a three-bedroom house in Portland. My first commis
sion was $3,000 and that got me going,&quot; Adame said.
<P>Adame became involved in commercial real estate in 1972 leasing office space in Everhart Plaza Building for
 architect and developer Jack Solka. In 1974 he founded Joe Adame &amp; Associates, Inc. and has been involved in
 the sales and leasing of many local properties including the bayfront condominium project Marina Del Sol, in
 which he was a development partner; NationsBank South Tower; Commerce I and II; the Atlantic-Mobil Build
ing; the Wilson Building; Tejas Gas Building; 100 South Padre Business Park; Office Park South; Everhart
 Plaza; Pueblo Park Mall and others. He estimates he has been involved in leasing more than one million square
 feet of tenant space and selling more than $100 million worth of property during his career, before this sale. 
<P>While his career progressed over the years, the real estate market was not always kind to Joe Adame. Depressed
 market conditions in 1986 cast a heavy financial and personal burden on him. His struggles led to an awakening
 of Christian faith. Adame realized the importance of trusting in God for direction.
<P>&quot;I started building a foundation of religious faith, trusting in God daily for direction in my life. I rearranged the
 order of my priorities to put God first, then familiy, then business,&quot; Adame said. &quot;This gave me a tremendous
 sense of peace.&quot;
<P>&quot;Many people look for success in material things financial achievement possessions, but I discovered that
 if you put God first, peace and prosperity follow,&quot; Adame said.
<P>While having always dealt honestly in his business transactions before, Adame felt that his religious rebirth
 committed him to an even deeper level of service to his clients and a stronger sense of patience and confidence
 in the face of difficulties.
<P>&quot;If you have gone through tough times personally and professionally, it is easier  to relate to people who are
 struggling,&quot; Adame said.
<P>As the real estate market recovered, Adame carried forth renewed by faith and armed with commitment. And his
 career continued to flourish.  
<P>In 1993, a consultant hired by Kumagai contacted Adame concerning market conditions for One Shoreline
 Plaza. Joe Adame &amp; Associates, Inc. is considered to be experts in office and industrial data, annually surveying
 office and industrial markets in this area for the Society of Industrial and Office Realtors report.
<P>Realizing that other Japanese investors were, at that time, selling their holdings across the United States and
 sensing the opportunity to build credibility and a direct relationship with the Japanese owners, Adame told the
 consultant he could sell One Shoreline Plaza. He had a group of investors in mind.
<P>One week later, the Kumagai New York office called, agreeing to sign a confidentiality agreement and faxing
 Adame operating numbers on the building. The following week, Adame's investors arrived in Corpus Christi
 and he presented a deal to the Japanese for an all-cash purchase of One Shoreline Plaza. When they responded a
 week later, Kumagai said they were not ready to sell the building.
<P>&quot;Everybody went home disappointed,&quot; Adame said. &quot;But I kept my foot in the door, sending Kumagai updated
 office market information throughout 1993 and 1994.&quot;
<P>&quot;Finally, they called again in October of 1994,&quot; Adame continued. &quot;They wanted to know if I could obtain
 another offer on  the property and close by March 31, 1995.&quot; 
<P>&quot;There was now many challenges to overcome, but all were met and the investors and I flew to New York on
 October 31. Kumagai accepted the contract and put the property under a 45-day feasibility and closing set for
 March 15, 1995,&quot; Adame said.
<P>Due to the challenge of financing the project in such a short time period, the investors were unable to perform.
<P>&quot;An old friend of mine named Herb Krumsick happened to call. Herb had taught a course I took through the
 Society of Industrial and Office Realtors fourteen years ago. We became friends and stayed in contact over the
 years. After visiting for a few minutes, he asked if I had any good investment deals,&quot; Adame said. &quot;I told him
 about One Shoreline Plaza. He was very interested and flew down to look at the project during a raging rain
storm. He was impressed and we shook hands.&quot;
<P>&quot;I then called Kumagai, who was understandably cool to my new prospect. They reluctantly agreed to meet.
 Herb and I were in New York two days later. Herb trusted my expertise on the numbers and we came up with a
 calculated gamble. Herb offered to give Kumagai a specified amount of money they could keep if he would not
 sign a document to purchase the property in ten days! They accepted,&quot; Adame said.
<P>&quot;The deadline was met after a three-day marathon session with attorneys. Then Herb discovered he did not have
 all the funding necessary to close the deal on such short notice,&quot; Adame said. &quot;I responded quickly by contact
ing a friend in One Shoreline Plaza, Bill Dodge, President of Pacific Southwest Bank.&quot;
<P>Dodge had just become president of Pacific Southwest Bank in January, responsible for three Corpus Christi
 banks plus locations in Portland, Rockport, Aransas Pass and Port Aransas. Although the bank had not previ
ously been an active commercial lender locally, Dodge had recently been given a new mandate to  become more
 active and more visible. Adame's deal was well timed.
<P>&quot;Dodge sent a loan commitment draft for our approval within five days, but then another problem surfaced. The
 bank was not comfortable with the terms of the sale,&quot; Adame said. &quot;Herb and I went back to the drawing board
 and came up with another option which the bank approved. We went back to the Japanese, and after five days,
 they agreed, with only one week remaining to meet the new March 31, 1995 closing date!&quot;
<P>The closing took place in Herb's Wichita, Kansas office. It lasted four days.
<P>&quot;In the interim, we purchased cowboy hats for the Japanese entourage and showed them our western culture and
 hospitality. They loved it and the closing was smooth,&quot; Adame said.
<P>That's how a handshake deal led to the earning of a six-figure commission and the leasing management of the
 most prestigious building in South Texas.

Office Rental Market Update Released 
</H1>
<H4>
by David Cheek Appraisal Service
</H4>
<P>Corpus Christi area office occupancy rates have increased over the past 18 months, according to an Office
 Rental Market Update report, released by David Cheek of David Cheek Appraisal Service.
<P>Rental rates decreased slightly in the central business district, where occupancy is at about 72 per cent. On the
 southside, where occupancy runs about 89 per cent, rental rates have increased slighting.
<P>Data available for the Northwest and Six Points areas were considered too limited to be substantially evaluated.
<P>The Corpus Christi commercial office market encompasses approximately five million square feet of office
 space. The update report released by David Cheek Appraisal Service includes approximately 4.2 million square
 feet of the total in its analysis.
<P>&quot;Overall, the rental and occupancy rates are considered to be not yet strong enough to make construction of new
 office space viable,&quot; said David Cheek, president of David Cheek Appraisal Service.
<P>The central business district continues to house the most business tenants reporting 1,796,605 occupied square
 feet. The total occupied office space on the southside was reported to be 1,182,532 square feet.
<P>Annual rental rates were reported to be $10.28 per square foot for the central business district and $10.83 per
 square foot for the southside, which has less inventory available. 
<P>The survey to collect updated market information, conducted in cooperation with Joe Adame &amp; Associates, Inc.
 Realtors, was begun in May of 1995 and completed in August of 1995. The survey information and opinions
 furnished to David Cheek Appraisal Service and contained in the report were obtained from sources considered
 to be reliable and believed to be true and correct; however no guarantee of accuaracy can be assumed.<BR>

What You Need to Know About
<P>FAX BROADCAST ADVERTISING
</H1>
<P><i>When you plan your promotional mix in your marketing plan, do you consider fax broadcasting? Many companies do not, simply because they have misconceptions about this new method of promotion. We decided to go to a well-known source, and ask the questions that we hear about fax broadcasting. We interviewed Tim Baker, owner of FaxAccess. FaxAccess has been in business in Corpus Christi since January 1, 1995 and does business with over 50 business and non-profit organizations. We hope this article answers some  of your questions about this new promotional medium.</I>
<P>
<P><STRONG>Q: Tim, what kinds of people or companies are on your fax broadcast list?</STRONG>
<P>
<P>A: We have over 5,000 companies on our city wide list. We can break that up into sections of the city, or we
 can fax city wide. And, we only fax to people who want to receive the fax broadcast. Anyone who wishes to be
 removed from the list just calls and they are removed immediately.
<P>
<P><STRONG>Q: What kinds of response can a business expect when they fax broadcast out?</STRONG>
<P>
<P>A: There are several factors that impact results. First and fore-most is the offer. If you are a restaurant and you
 are offering lunch specials and it's good for the week, you will have a high response rate. Faxing out 2,000 in
 the restaurant's area, it's predictable to get a 10% plus return depending on the offer. We have gotten even
 higher than that. If you are a business and offering a small incentive, with a longer valid period, your response
 will come in over a longer period of time, but you will definitely get response. The strategy is to plan to get
 your message out more than once to the same audience. Just like in traditional advertising, you need consis
tency.
<P>
<P><STRONG>Q: What kinds of businesses get the best response?</STRONG>
<P>A: Really, we have had a good response for most of our advertisers. However, restaurants, car dealers, cellular
 phone stores, computer companies, furniture stores, entertainment and community events and retail companies
 have been the kinds of companies that have gotten really gangbuster business from faxing. A great deal de
pends on the offer and  the time period of the offer. It seems the longer people have to redeem an offer, the
 longer they wait. If you have an offer like the ones we mentioned for the restaurants, you will see response
 right away. This is a promotional medium.
<P>
<P><STRONG>Q: What are the costs associated with your service?</STRONG>
<P>A: Our fees for faxing run from $199 to $975, depending on how many people you want to reach and what
 kind of set-up and design you need.  We're not saying that you need to use only this method of advertising and
 promotion, but as part of your promotional mix, this method is certainly cost-effective.
<P>
<P><STRONG>Q: Why can't a business just broadcast fax from their own machine and save a little money?</STRONG>
<P>A: My investment in hardware, software and list acquisition is pretty substantial. If you are going to fax a
 couple of hundred from your machine, you are looking at the time to enter the numbers, the probability that
 your software will lock up when you hit a number that won't go through, and the time it takes to babysit the
 project.  All in all, we are set up to handle the volume.
<H2>
Myth &amp; Fact
</H2>
<P>myth: It's illegal to broadcast fax.
<P>Fact: It is illegal to send broadcast faxes to someone who  has asked not to receive them.
<P>
<P>Myth: People don't read a fax that is unsolicited.
<P>Fact: People respond to offers and incentives if they are interested, just like direct mail offers.<BR>

Doing Business on the Internet
</H1>
<H3>
How local companies are finding business on the Net.
</H3>
<P>Local companies are learning about the Internet and the ways to drum up new business on the World Wide Web.
 Real estate companies, hotels, software developers, entrepreneurs, and attorneys are just a few of the kinds of
 local companies going online in search of new business. 
<P>Our marketing and advertising firm has always enjoyed local business, but also outside business business that
 comes from other cities, other states and other countries. That outside business would not have been possible
 without contacts, and in the last couple of years, the Internet. 
<H3>
Internet takes a local business and opens it up to the world, allowing you to compete on a
 global scale.  
</H3>
<P>But, you might ask how would you get buying prospects outside the local area interested in your products and
 services, and then taking that step to buy from you. The answer is that you develop a good plan and just get out
 there and do it! Maybe you can't afford multiple pages on the Internet to tell your story. Then start with a single
 page and a response page directed back to you. I know of one local company that developed over $30,000 in
 business in one month that way. The point is that you get started  you get out there and get some market
 share. 
<P>Experts in the field of business and communications predict that in the next ten years more than 39 percent of
 all Fortune 500 companies' business will be done on the Internet. Their predictions for small and medium size
 business is that if companies or small firms do not learn to do business online, they are headed down the path of
 fewer sales and being left out of one of the strongestmainstreamsofmarketingandselling.
<P>How do you investigate the opportunities for your company? How do you get started? Start by giving us a call.
 We can help you get set up with a dial up service and e-mail. Then we can give you consultation on Web pages
 and an estimate of cost. It all starts with objectives and goals, and that develops into a plan. We are helping
 many local companies get on the Internet and companies in Port Aransas, and other area communities. We
 also work with clients in Austin, Houston, Dallas and San Antonio, Chicago, Miami, and out of the country. We
 have market tested our methods over the last couple of years, and we know what works. We also know what
 doesn't work. Both pieces of knowledge are important to success. 
<P>We have developed two Internet sites for business. One site is the Global Business Exchange, a site developed
 to promote domestic U. S. and international business networking and transactions. 
<H3>
The site can be found at:  http://www.globalbiz.com
</H3>
<P>Companies or individuals list in the site, and place advertising pages to show capabilities and services. When
 you visitGlobal Business Exchange you will find members and contacts from around the world. They are
 poised and ready to do business. As we add more information to the site, commercial marketing pages for
 companies will be added as well. 
<P>Go into the site and register yourself. See what kind of responses or inquiries you receive. But please, report
 your response to us. We love to hear about response. 
<H3>
Currently we are offering a free listing for 90 days.  
</H3>
<P>I recently returned from Mexico where I signed contracts for companies to list in the Global Business Ex
change site. Mexico may be suffering with the devaluation, but their hope for selling products and      services
 worldwide is renewed by the case studies and business activity they are seeing on Internet. 
<P>Right now we have about 15 companies contracted to join our Global Business site with multiple pages, from
 Houston, Austin, Chicago, Mexico and Corpus Christi and over 75 listed companies from around the world. By
 December we predict over 100 commercial pages and 200 listed companies in the site. Visit and sign up for a
 free business listing. Internet success stories are being written there. 
<P>We have also developed the &quot;Visit Corpus Christi&quot; Page on the Internet to showcase our beautiful city. The site
 contains visitor and relocation information about the city, attractions, accommodations, real estate, local com
panies, local media, the Christmas Wish List and a chance to Win a New Car! That's right, win a new Mercury
 Sable from Pagan Lewis Motors. 
<H3>
You'll have to go online to find out how easy it is to win a new Mercury Sable! 
<P>The address is http://www.trip.net  
</H3>
<P>The current sponsor for the site is Clifford B. Nelson of REMAX realty. Cliff decided to sponsor the site
 because his research shows that real estate sales have been quite successful on the 'Net. Cliff offers viewers
 Corpus Christi and Padre Island real estate, and is listing commercial properties as well as residential. World
wide marketing of property takes place all over the 'Net, just as selling of services and consultation does. 
<P>The Corpus Christi site will also list local hotels and give online users a chance to book rooms right over the
 Internet. Other cities have been successful in booking rooms, and often offer special room rates and packages
 to online users to prompt them to reserve rooms. We want to see our area get its share of the market. 
<P>Will you get that many &quot;hits&quot; to your site? Not right away, but just wait till you've been out there for a while.
 The inquiries will come. Just like traditional marketing, you have to develop a strategic plan like a business
 management consultant friend of mine says, &quot;Plan your work and work your plan.&quot; This is certainly good
 advice regarding Internet marketing.
<P>So let's say you have your advertising pages up and running on some site and you aren't getting hits. What can
 be the problem? There are over 40 million people on the Web and none of them are getting to your site! <i>
You have to market.</I> We make sure that part of the strategic plan is the marketing and listing in search engines,
 directories, and discussion groups. After working on the Net for so long, we have learned more than a few
 tricks about listing and marketing on the Net. These little tips and tricks can make a big difference in the num
ber of hits a site receives. If you have your site up somewhere else, and you aren't getting the traffic you ex
pected, give it some time. If after a month online you haven't received what you think you should be getting,
 we can help you analyze why and maybe help you get a better return. You can always track and measure the
 response. And even better, there are all kinds of ways to get better results.
<H3>
An interesting fact is that in the month of March, an investment firm received over
 250,000 requests about their services.  
</H3>
<P>The spirit of the Internet is that it is a medium of shared information. We should all endeavor to keep it that
 way. When we add companies to the Internet to market goods and services, one important point to always keep
 in mind is that you are building a relationship with the Internet community. That means you have to follow the
 rules, and give before you receive. You'll find the information you give, before you try to sell, will come back
 to you tenfold. The Internet is the wave of the future and surf is definitely &quot;up&quot;.

Do You Really Want Your &quot;Day in Court&quot; 
<P>or is Mediation in Your Best Interest?
</H1>
<P>Mediation can be a real solution to some legal problems for business owners. Yes, we all want and deserve our
 &quot;day in court&quot; but are you really prepared for the time and money that it takes to get there. Small disputes can
 be handled much better through mediation, and you should be fully aware of the benefits. 
<P>The acceptance of mediation by attorneys and clients has grown dramatically in recent years. They see the
 advantages of going into mediation with a real spirit of settling. The time and mental anquish expended by the
 business owner, coupled with mounting legal fees and deposition costs, gives a real justification to trying
 mediation. From a purely business perspective, the mental time it takes you to prepare and go through the steps
 of a lawsuit will probably keep you from going about your usual business. Your attention and your energies will
 be drawn upon as the trial date grows near. 
<P>As an option taken early-on in the lawsuit, mediation not only saves time, bu it saves money. Not only do you
 bypass the on-going attorney fees, filing fees and deposition fees, but you have a better chance of settling
 because neither side has so much expense weighing them down early on.
<P> Is mediation a 50/50 proposition? You, as a business owner, should not expect an equal &quot;split down the middle&quot;
 from the mediation process. Rather, you should expect that both sides will present their case to the other side
 and the mediator, and then negotiations will begin. The mediator is there to facilitate the process and to keep
 negotiatons from breaking down. The parties make the decisions and direct the negotiations. The mediation
 process is bargaining in its basic form. 
<P>If you go into the mediation with a clear mission of settlement, your attitude regarding negotiation will be be
 more positive. This is not to say that you won't have your side, and that your side won't be represented well.
 Your attorney basically prepares an opening statement, and has his arguments down for the mediation. He or          
 she will be well prepared to argue your points and present the case from your side. Selecting an attorney who
 has mediation experience in the area that is being mediated is a real plus. Your attorney will be by your side
 throughout this procedure, and therefore the more experience they have the better prepared they will be.
<P>When we spoke to one business owner who had recently gone through a successful mediation, he stated, &quot;This
 was the first time that I had ever experienced mediation. I had been involved in lawsuits before, and basically
 after large expenses and fees and time spent, wound up pretty much where I had started. Nobody really won
 from a cost standpoint. The mediation was much different. After one full day, both of us had reached a settle
ment that I thought was fair, and now we can both get on with our business without a lawsuit looming out        
 there.&quot; Who knows how a jury would have found the case. 
<P>Mediation is not binding. If you do not reach a settlement in mediation, you can still pursue the lawsuit. And,
 after mediation, both sides can get a quick snapshot of what they are facing from the other side.
<P>It just makes sense to give mediation a try. It is not just the answer to a crowded court docket system, but
 maybe the answer to lost time and revenue from small companies that cannot afford the loss.

Why Trademark?
</H1>
<P>If you are a small business, why should you spend the time and money to trademark a name? 
<P>Protection of your right to use the name you have chosen, protection of your investment to market that name and
 the reputation you build as you do business are key reasons for trademarking.
<P>Companies that have trademarked a name have a distinct advantage over others who haphazardly use a name
 without benefit of research or trademark. Let's say, for example, that you have developed soft-     ware that
 serves a very distinctive function in the banking industry. You are a small company but with this new software
 you will be able to open up the whole country of banks to your product. If you do not do your due diligence in
 searching and securing a trademark, you may have the best product out there, but by the time you have launched
 it, marketed it, and started selling it, one of your larger competitors may decide to trademark a name that is very
 close to yours knowing that you have not done your homework. In fact, in some instances, this may prevent you
 from getting your chosen name trademarked.
<P>A good Trademark and Copyright attorney is worth his weight in gold. But the fees he charges and the filing
 fees are really quite reasonable. When you have chosen a name that needs protection, you should consult a
 copyright and trademark attorney and get a consult about your name. The attorney will more than likely have a
 two-step process that he will work from. The first step is to research that the name you have chosen is not
 currently in use. In fact there are several criteria for this analysis.  
<H4>
A trademark cannot be so similar to another as to confuse the general public. 
</H4>
<P>That includes similarity to logos or to marks on like goods and services. The possibility of confusion during the
 sales process, and the familiarity and recall of similar or like logos, identities or names is forbidden.
<P>As well, you cannot take a common word in the vocabulary and trademark it. There must be distinction in your
 name.
<P>You are wise to have your name trademarked in both Texas and by the federal government office. Once you
 have gained the right to use the name, or mark, you must use it to prove that it  is yours. There are specific time
 limits on your intended use of the name, but for the most part your trademark is valid because you are using it in
 commerce.
<P>Your attorney will go through the process for you, first doing the research and then reporting back the results to
 you. Through the process, your attorney will keep you informed of the progress, the acceptance or denial. He or
 she might counsel you as to changing your name just a bit to be able to use it, if  there is conflict. 
<P>The attorney can also counsel you as to the notification of the mark being in use after the initial time period has
 run. This ensures that your mark will not be picked up by a competitor, just because you did not file paperwork.
 Not only is trademarking important to protecting your name, but it protects you from using a name or a mark
 that is already in use. There are horror stories of companies that blindly choose a name or a logo and later years
 in business, get notification of  a &quot;cease and desist&quot; order to stop using the name and identity. If they are lucky, a
 cease and desist order is all they are faced with. 
<P>It just makes sense to protect what you work so hard for. It takes a call to a competent attorney, and the time  to
 go through the steps. In the long run, it can be the best insurance you'll ever buy.

LesComm Is More
</H1>
<H3>
An Interview with Les Jernigan
<P>President of LesComm Computers &amp; Electronics
</H3>
<H4>
by Norma Lawson
</H4>
<P>LesComm Computers &amp; Electronics sells, services, and repairs computers, stereos, alarms, CB radios, scanners
 and other electical equipment in four branch locations: one in North Carolina, two in Arkansas, and one in
 Corpus Christi, Texas. <i>Bay Area Business</I> magazine's Norma Lawson interviewed LesComm Computers &amp;
 Electronics president Les Jernigan.
<H4>
<P>Your main business is computers.  Tell us about the ones you offer.
</H4>
<P>Most of our computer systems are partially assembled when they get here and we add the drives and peripher
als to make a specific configuration. They all come with a one-year, carry-in warranty. Homesite warranties are
 also available. Our computers are all IBM-compatible PCs. 
<P>We use top-quality products, not cheap desktop cases like you see in other computer stores. These cases are
 made by Inline &#173; it's a better case. Its easier to get into and sturdier. 
<P>All of the drives are on slides so they are easy to get in and out. The motherboard lays down so you can get to it
 easily. We use name brand components such as Relysis, Intel, AMD and Western Digital.
<H4>
<P>What makes you different from your competition &#173; prices?
</H4>
<P>Our prices are one thing, we'll beat any quote. But we also have a friendly, customer-oriented atmosphere and
 do not push things on you. You come in and tell us what it is that you want and we steer you to the right pack
age. If you don't want one of our packages, we'll beat any quote on someone else's bare-bones hardware. Just
 bring in any written quote or ad. We may not beat it by much, but we'll beat it. 
<H4>
<P>My sister just bought a computer with software included from a national discount store 
<P>Do you offer that type of package deal too?
</H4>
<P>We offer the essential hardware components at the best prices. Of course, everything comes with DOS &#173; that's    
 standard, and some of the CD packages come with an encyclopedia. Although it appears you may be getting
 stuff for free in other bundled deals, you are actually paying for it. At LesComm, we believe you want the best
 deal on your hardware, and with the money you save you can go buy exactly the software you want.
<H4>
<P>Do you compete favorably against the discount chains?
</H4>
<P>We don't carry a large line of manufacturers like they do, but our prices are definitely better. Our prices run the
 same as the computer magazines charge for the same machine. Our customers can get the best prices AND a
 local dealer in case they have a problem.
<H4>
<P>What kind of information do you need from a customer to recommend a compatible system?
</H4>
<P>We sit down with our customers and find out what you intend to do with it. If you are going to write letters
 from your home, keep up your checkbook or have children who need it for school, something like our little
 DX-2 package would be all you need. 
<P>But if you are a power-user or if you want to do graphics, you will need a Pentium computer, something with
 more power. In fact, we have a low-end Pentium package deal for $1295. It's a 60-megahertz Pentium.
<H4>
<P>What's the difference between DX and SX Systems?
</H4>
<P>The SX system does not have a built in math co-processor. The DX system does.
<H4>
<P>What's the price differential, and why would I want this?
</H4>
<P>In the past, there was a lot of price difference with systems, today there's not. If you are going to be doing
 CAD graphics work, you need the math co-processor. SX will do most anything you want to do &#173; it will even
 do CAD &#173; but it does it slower. Unless there's a big price difference between the SX and the DX, go with the
 DX. The Pentium includes a math co-processor.
<H4>
<P>What's the difference between a 486 that might be an 80 or 90 MHz, versus a Pentium that would be 75
 MHz?
</H4>
<P>There's more circuitry inside the Pentium CPU to process instruction.
<H4>
<P>What would be an optimum system?
</H4>
<P>A Pentium 75 MHz is a preferred system. There are two lower stages: the 66 and the 60. But the Pentium 75 is
 sort of midstream. 
<P>Then you can get a 100, 120 or 133 MHz if you are doing 64 million color graphics or things of that nature.
 That's when you would need the higher speed on the Pentium.
<H4>
<P>I read recently that if you are purchasing a computer, you should stick with a 486.  
Is the minimum that you sell a 486, or do you still sell a 386?
</H4>
<P>We still sell 386s, and there's a very good market for them. The 386 machines will run Windows. Some of the
 higher-end 386s will run Windows 95. The SXs won't. They are not fast enough, but they will run Windows
 3.1, and there is still a large variety of software available for 3.1. 
<P>The 386s are very affordable for people on a tight budget. They can buy a complete 386 system for about $800
 &#173; that includes the monitor and a CD-ROM drive.
<H4>
<P>On an average, how much memory does the home or business user need so they 
can open programs and use them?
</H4>
<P>A minimum of 4 megabtyes. And now the standard is 8 megabytes.
<H4>
<P>Will 8 megabytes be too small?
</H4>
<P>If you want to use Windows 95, you need 16. It will run on 8; it will even run on 4, but not very well. If you
 want to optimize it, where it runs best, you need 16 MB of memory and a big hard drive.
<H4>
<P>How much, on average, does extra memory cost for hard drives?
</H4>
<P>It depends on the size of the drive. The more popular drives are higher per megabyte than the older ones. 340s
 and 420s are starting to become outmoded, so they are becoming cheaper per megabyte. Your best buy, at this
 time, is an 850 MB hard drive &#173; the cost is lower per megabyte.
<H4>
<P>How does video memory differ from the regular memory?
</H4>
<P>Video memory deciphers the instruction the CPU sends to the video card. It basically loads them and stays
 ahead. It makes the video screen refresh faster, and it's totally independent from the system's memory, so you
 are not using the system's memory to do the tasks that the video memory does. All of our computers, except for
 the low-end computers like the 386s, come with 1 MB of video RAM; most are upgradable to 2 MB.
<H4>
<P>For most of the applications (playing games, CD's, etc.) is the 1 MB fine?
</H4>
<P>Yes. In fact, the more memory you have on the video card, the slower the video card becomes. Because you
 can get more resolution, and the more resolution, the longer it takes to refresh the screen.
<H4>
<P>What kind of support can your customers expect if they have a problem 
getting their software up and running?  Can they call you?
</H4>
<P>Absolutely. If it's something we've installed, we'll do our best to help you figure out how to get it up and use it.
 Plus, we also have a gentleman that will actually go out and tutor you. We offer a discount on tutorials. Your
 cost is approximately $15 per hour and we pick up the rest of the cost. That's an excellent value for software
 training, especially when you consider that he will tutor one or 30 people for the same $15 per hour. If you
 bought your computer through us, you get the discounted tutorial rate of $15 per hour. You can include the
 whole family, have the tutor over for a couple of hours and everything should work smoothly after that.
<H4>
<P>What about a printer?
</H4>
<P>We recommend Hewlett Packard (HP) and Panasonic. The HP are jet printers. If you want dot matrix, then we
 sell the Panasonics. Everyone seems to like HPs and HP is a very reliable printer. I have yet to have anyone call
 me with a problem on an HP. 
<P>When we do a package deal that includes a printer, we set the drivers up in the computer so that when you get
 home and plug it in, you can sit down and start using it. You don't have to load drivers. It's ready to use. The
 only thing you have to do is install any additional software.
<H4>
<P>What's the difference between a quad speed CD and a double speed CD drive?
</H4>
<P>Quad speed is twice as fast! It transfers information to the computer processor faster. You can buy a 2-speed
 CD-rom drive for about $79. For a 4-speed it's about $170.
<P>A lot of computers have built-in fax-modems. What can you tell us about them?
<P>Most of your services just got to 14.4, so right now, you really don't gain that much benefit from a 28.8. The
 28.8 modems are out, but they don't seem to be catching on that quickly, probably due to the price ($130 -
 $140 for a 28.8 vs. a 14.4 for $70).
<BR>
If you have Internet access and they let you sign on at 28.8, your benefit from the faster speed is worth the cost.
 If you use a local Bulletin Board Service &#173; some of them are still using 2400 baud.
<H4>
<P>Do you accept trade-ins?
</H4>
<P>No, but we do consignments. If you have a computer you want to sell, tell us what you want for it, and we get
 10%. We'll set it up and let people come look at it.
<H4>
<P>What is your background for this business?
</H4>
<P>I'm a Navy electronics technician. I used to be a training deviceman working on the aircraft simulators.
<H4>
<P>What about your other store managers?
</H4>
<P>Most of my managers are people I've worked with and known for quite a while. They are knowledgeable about
 computers and are friendly, people-oriented managers.
<H4>
<P>What other electonics do you carry?
</H4>
<P>We have radar detectors, CB radios, police scanners, car stereos, speakers, amplifiers. Our least expensive car
 stereo, with cassette, is $18. We also do a lot of antenna business.
<H4>
<P>Who does the repair/maintenance on the items you sell?
</H4>
<P>My son is the car stereo/alarm expert. I work with the computers.
<P>That's one thing that we have that  the discount stores don't &#173; knowledgeable employees.

Corpus Christi Business Leaders Predict 
</H3>
<H1>
&quot;SOFT LANDING&quot; FOR ECONOMY
</H1>
<P>Nearly two-thirds of local business leaders participating in the July 1995 <i>
Frost Bank Executive Forum </I>survey agreed with an economic prediction that the economy is headed toward a &quot;soft landing&quot; with solid growth and
 moderate inflation, according to survey results released recently.  Almost half of those polled reported in
creased profits in the first half of 1995, although the overall economic confidence level of respondents was
 slightly lower than in the January 1995 survey.  Almost 175 local business, education and civic leaders par
ticipated in the forum and shared opinions on a variety of local, state and national issues, such as local tour
ism, the OxyChem lawsuit, the &quot;hidden gun&quot; law and the federal budget and taxes.
<P>Survey respondents' expectations translated into a Confidence Index of 61 for their companies and 53 for
 their industries as a whole, down slightly from the January 1995 <i>
Executive Forum Survey</I> results of a Confidence Index of 67 for respondents' companies and 57 for their industries.  The Index is calculated by assign
ing each response a point value and determining the mean score for all respondents.  Point values range from
 100 for &quot;a lot better&quot; to 0 for &quot;a lot worse.&quot;  This method is also used by the U.S. Conference Board in com
puting the National Confidence Index.
<P>Almost two-thirds of respondents anticipated no change in employment within their companies and more than
 half indicated they would make no changes in capital spending.
<P>&quot;Although local business leaders remain cautious in their ecomonic outlook, the prediction of a 'soft landing'
 with solid growth and only moderate inflation reflects a steady, but positive direction,&quot; said Mike Carrell,
 president of Frost Bank-Corpus Christi.  &quot;Area leaders believe the dramatic increase in tourism and conven
tion business will generate increased revenues for many local businesses, as well as for the city, which indi
cates a good level of confidence locally.&quot;
<H3>
Impact of Federal Budget Cuts  
</H3>
<P>When asked about the proposed federal budget cuts and the impact on taxes, 85 percent of respondents
 expressed a belief that state and local taxes will rise, and 80 percent indicated that federal aid to local school
 districts will be reduced. An overwhelming 96 percent agreed that there will be a need to reduce the overlap
ping functions of all local governments.
<P>Sixty-two percent of those polled recommend a higher sales tax be considered as an alternative to property
 taxes to finance public education.
<H3>
Local and State Issues
</H3>
<P>When asked to address issues of local interest, almost three-fourths of the Corpus Christi business leaders
 who participated in the poll agreed that the city's investment in efforts to promote the tourism industry were
 justified by the dramatic increase in tourism and convention business in the city this summer, generating
 increased revenues for the city and many local businesses.
<P>Sixty-seven percent of those responding felt the resolution of the OxyChem lawsuit will have far-reaching
 effects on the growth of the petro-chemical industry in the local area. Regarding the local construction indus
try, 63 percent indicated that the increase in local homeowner insurance rates due to recent legislation at the
 state level will result in a trickle-down effect, slowing home construction and hurting spinoff business.
<P>The recent changes in the Coastal Management Plan were also addressed in this edition of the survey, with 41
 percent of participants stating that the change is wrong and should only be enforced for properties adjacent to
 the coastline.  Thirty-four percent felt that the new version of the plan is a good idea, but is too strong and
 should be restructured to allow private development throughout the county, but control (or limit) major busi
ness development in the area.
<P>Regarding statewide issues, 70 percent of those polled think Texans should be given the opportunity to vote
 on the issue of home equity loans and almost as many, 69 percent, felt that education reforms adopted by the
 Texas Legislature are on the right track to improving the quality of education in the state.  Opinions were split
 on the issue of the &quot;hidden gun&quot; law, with 42 percent agreeing that the law will lead to more violence and
 accidental shootings and 44 percent disagreeing.
<P>The Executive Forum is conducted twice a year by Frost Bank in conjunction with Gibson Research Group. 
 The next survey will be conducted in January 1996.

Spohn Health System Names 
</H2>
<H1>
Jake Henry, Jr. 
</H1>
<H4>
New President and CEO
</H4>
<P>Jake Henry Jr. assumes the duties of president and chief executive officer of Spohn Health System November
 1, replacing Sister Kathleen Coughlin who retired after fourteen years.
<P>Henry, a native Texan, is currently chief executive officer of Saint Francis Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee.
 He returns to Texas where he earned his bachelor of science degree at Texas Tech University in Lubbock, his
 master of science degree in health care administration from Trinity University in San Antonio.
<P>Selected by Spohn officials after a nationwide executive search, Henry has previously worked in increasingly
 responsible positions with the Saint Joseph Health System of Orange, California, a system owning hospitals in
 Texas and California. He has served as the president of their Saint Mary Hospital in Lubbock; as regional
 president of their hospitals in northern California in Napa, Santa Rosa, Fortuna and Eureka; and as executive
 vice president in charge of operations for the entire system.
<P>Henry has served as director of the Texas Conference of Catholic Health Facilities, the California Association
 of Catholic Hospitals, and the Hospital Council of Southern California. He is a Fellow of the American Col
lege of Healthcare Executives.
<P>According to Mrs. Patty Mueller, Spohn Health System board member and a member of the selection commit
tee, the executive search identified ten national candidates and then narrowed the search to three finalists, who
 were interviewed in Corpus Christi.
<P>&quot;I think Mr. Henry is a good choice. He'sanativeofwestTexasandbeganworking in hospitals in his teens,&quot;
 Mueller said.
<P>&quot;He impressed me as being a very dynamic person, good at communication and possessing an understanding
 of our transitional needs and an appreciation of our mission of caring,&quot; Mueller said. 
<P>&quot;We're making the transition from a sister CEO to a lay CEO. We have never had a lay CEO. This is a big step
 for us, so it is important that he share our mission of caring,&quot; Meuller said.
<P>&quot;Mr. Henry always has been in non-profit hospitals. He also has served beforein similar positions where his
 direct predecessor was a sister. He made those transitions to lay leadership smooth for everyone,&quot; Mueller
 said.
<P>According to Laura Popp, of the Marketing and Planning Department of Spohn Health System, Henry brings
 outstanding leadership expertise in developing peak performance management teams, managed care readiness,
 continuum of care services, medical staff relations, physician partnering and attention to efficiency and patient
 satisfaction. 
<P>&quot;He has a keen appreciation of the need to balance strategy, mission and stewardship, while recognizing the
 importance of aligning organizational and physician goals,&quot; Popp said.
<P>Doctor Glenn Bugay, current chief of the medical staff at Spohn Hospital and Spohn Hospital South, agrees
 with Popp's assessment. 
<P>&quot;I made it a point to talk to other physicians in Lubbock and San Angelo who have worked with Mr Henry.
 They reported that he works very well with doctors and is a good administrator,&quot; Bugay said.
<P>Doctor Bugay, also a member of the selection committee, stated: &quot;After meeting him personally, I was greatly
 impressed that Henry possesses the capabilities to be both a good manager and a good leader. There's a
 difference. And it's often hard to find one person with the qualities necessary for both jobs,&quot; 
<P>&quot;I think Henry is going to be very good and I look forward to his arrival,&quot; Bugay said.

First Northwest Health and Safety Fair to Become  Annual Event
</H1>
<P>Northwest area residents checked their health and learned safety tips at the first annual &quot;Northwest Health and
 Safety Fair&quot; held Saturday, October 21 at the Arlington Heights Church of Christ in Northwest Corpus
 Christi.
<P>Hundreds of people attended the fair from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., for free health screenings for blood pressure,
 glucose, cholesterol, hearing, glaucoma; immunizations; and CPR demonstrations.  Other health, wellness
 and safety information was provided, plus an appearance by Wally Wise demonstrating how to Shelter-In
-Place. 
<P>The new event was spearheaded bytheKochCommunityAdvisoryCouncil and coordinated by volunteers
 from Hoechst Celanese, OxyChem, Central Power and Light and the Steven's Water Plant. Additional support
 was provided by the Tuloso-Midway and Calallan Independent School Districts and the Northwest Business
 Association.
<P>According to Gary Lowe, Arlington Heights Church of Christ minister and member of the Koch Community
 Advisory Council, the idea for the health and safety fair grew out of discussions during the advisory council
 meetings on how to better serve the needs of the northwest community.
<P>&quot;We wanted to do something to benefit the folks who live around this area,&quot; Lowe said.  &quot;It has turned into an
 ambitious project involving a lot of other companies and organizations.  Next year, we won't have enough
 room for it here at the church.&quot;
<P>Nina Sisley, M.D., director of the Corpus Christi-Nueces County Health Department and community advisory
 council member compared the Northwest Health and Safety Fair to a similar Health Fair sponsored annually
 by the Nueces County Medical Society and the Alliance.
<P>&quot;The reason we are having the Northwest Health and Safety Fair is that we felt like the people in the north
west community did not have as much access to the other health fair,&quot; Sisley explained.  &quot;Koch Refining has
 been very generous in supporting not just a health fair, but a health and safety fair.  We have a lot of safety
 information particularly useful to the Northwest area residents who live near the refineries.&quot;
<P>Sponsors estimated that more than a thousand people attended the Saturday event.
<P>&quot;We are happy so many people could attend,&quot; said Mary Garrison, R.N., C.O.H.N., with Hoechst Celanese           
 Tech Center. &quot;We had something for everyone &#173; parents, young adults and children. Besides health and safety
 information, we had entertainment and door prizes.  Everyone was very pleased with the event.&quot;
<P>The winning entry in a poster contest involving elementary students from Tuloso-Midway and Calallen
 schools was selected to be used for the official poster for the 1996 Northwest Health and Safety Fair.  
<P>The Koch Community Advisory Council is a 40-member community group which was organized by Koch       
 two years ago, according to Rich Tuttle, director of Regional Public Relations for Koch Refining Company.
<P>&quot;The group meets monthly to discuss issues which concern industry and this area's community,&quot; Tuttle said. 
 &quot;We decided to emphasize both safety and health issues in our first Northwest area fair and we look forward
 to the Health and Safety Fair becoming an annual event.&quot;

Business Alliance and Ozone Task Force Plan Action to
 Avoid Costly Ozone Noncompliance
</H1>
<H4>
by Jeff Woolford, Editor
</H4>
<P>The Corpus Christi Ozone Task Force and the Greater Corpus Christi Business Alliance announced plans for
 avoiding costly federal regulations that could result from the city's being designated an ozone nonattainment
 area.
<P>The Corpus Christi Ozone Task Force asked the Alliance to support a change in the ozone standard to no lower
 than 100 parts per billion (ppb) for an eight-hour average, based on health effects and scientific data.
<P>A report released by Task Force Chairman Norman Renfro September 27th announced other ozone-reducing
 recommendations including the continuation of the Ozone Action Day program, the installation of vapor recov
ery systems at area industrial sites, rebates on the purchase of electric lawn mowers and trimmers, employer
 promotion of carpooling, and fleet operations use of clean-burning fuels in fleet vehicles.
<H3>
Ozone Action History
</H3>
<P>Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission (TNRCC) past-chairman John Hall met with the Mayor and
 the Board of Trade Industries leaders in May of 1994 to advise them of what he termed our &quot;near nonattainment
 status&quot; at that time. 
<P>Shortly afterwards, the Mayor asked the Board of Trade Industries to develop a task force to research the cause
 and identify corrective action measures that  could be implemented voluntarily to maintain compliance.
<P>In June of 1994, a task force was developed comprised of city, county, military and industry representatives. The
 Port of Corpus Christi Authority, Central Power and Light Company, area refineries, the Naval Air Station,
 TNRCC, Texas Department of Transportation, the Regional Transporation Authority, the Alliance and others
 began working on short-term and long-term solutions. Ozone Action Day notices and voluntary actions were
 developed by the committee. 
<P>In September, 1994 the Corpus Christi Ozone Task Force initiated a research project through Texas A&amp;M
 University &#173; Kingsville designed to review, analyze and evaluate what the sources of the ozone problem could
 be and to recommend corrective action. 
<P>Some of the Ozone Task Force recommendations were based on results of the study conducted by the environ
mental engineering program at Texas A&amp;M University &#173; Kingsville. The cost of the $45,029 study was paid for
 by the Board of Trade ($22,500), the Port of Corpus Christi Authority ($7,509), the City of Corpus Christi
 ($7,510) and Nueces County ($7,510). 
<P>The Task Force report further recommended that the Coastal Bend Council of Governments establish an air
 quality committee to study the concept of a &quot;flexible attainment package&quot; with the Environmental Protection
 Agency (EPA), similar to one obtained by Tulsa, Oklahoma. The EPA is considering the Tulsa Package           
 as a model for other cities. The flexible attainment package would keep Corpus Christi from being designated
 nonattainment with EPA for a five-year period (even if we exceed the standards), while agreed upon control
 strategies are being initiated to reduce ozone formation. Many of the TAMU &#173; Kingsville study recommenda
tions could be folded into such a program. 
<H3>
What is Ozone?
</H3>
<P>Ozone is a highly reactive form of oxygen that reacts with other ground level pollutants to form photochemical
 smog. While ozone can be beneficial (ozone is an excellent disinfectant for water and air), high concentrations
 at ground level can cause lung damage, plant damage, and damage to some materials like rubber.
<H3>
What is Nonattainment?
</H3>
<P>To protect human health and the environment, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has developed a
 maximum allowable one-hour ozone standard of 120 parts per billion (ppb) in the air. If this standard is ex
ceeded any more than three days in a consecutive three-year period, the area is designated nonattainment.
 Nonattainment simply means the area does not comply to federal standards and corrective actions must be
 undertaken to return to compliance or attainment. 
<P>Corpus Christi is perilously close to nonattainment designation. One monitoring station (CAM 21), located at
 West Guth Park and near the Ship Channel industries, has already registered the three allowable violations since
 September 1993. 
<H3>
What Will A Nonattainment Designation Mean to Corpus Christi?
</H3>
<P>If one more violation is registered at the CAM 21 monitor before September 9, 1996, the Environmental Protec
tion Agency will mandate varying degrees of control measures depending on the level of noncompliance. Con
trols could be inconvenient and costly  to industry, individual citizens and the general economy.
<P>At the very minimum, the EPA would require:
<P>1) an inventory of actual emissions from all sources;
<P>2) a vehicle inspection and maintenance program, where annual vehicle inspections could cost an estimated  
 $23 per vehicle and it is predicted that 20 percent of the vehicles inspected would require repairs costing an
 average of $525 before a license can be renewed;
<P>3) more stringent permit requirements fornewormodifiedstationarysources;
<P>4) new construction of major stationary sources or significant modifications to an existing major source will be
 required to offset pollution increases by a greater ratio than 1.0 to 1.0. 
<P>
<P>If an area designated nonattainment fails to adequately improve air quality, the EPA can mandate 2-to-1 emis
sion offset requirements from industry, more vigorous vehicle inspections, mandatory carpooling, and consumer
 limits on a variety of activities from lawn mowing to filling your car with gasoline.
<P>Nonattainment designation is strongly at odds with economic development goals because it can limit expansion
 and exclude certain industries entirely.
<P>Now, to make matters seemingly worse, the federal standards used to determine nonattainment may be getting
 even stricter.
<H3>
The Alliance Response to Possible Tighter Standards
</H3>
<P>According to Gary Bushell, executive vice president of the Greater Corpus Christi Business Alliance, the Clean
 Air Act standards for nonattainment are up for review in 1996 and the EPA is considering switching to an eight
-hour averaged standard which would supposedly allow for a fairer averaging. However, the limit being consid
ered for this new standard would be 70 to 80 parts per billion.  
<P>&quot;They think the eight-hour standard is better, and we agree. But they want to pull down the nonattainment level
 to only 70 or 80 parts per billion,&quot; Bushell said.
<P>&quot;The proposed 80 parts per billion standard for an eight-hour average is related to statistical modeling and is not
 supported by any of the currently available health studies. We feel the 70 to 80 parts per billion level is too low;
 that studies conducted to date don't support a health risk at those low levels. That level, however, would result in
 every near-nonattainment city in Texas becoming nonattainment,&quot; Bushell said. 
<P>There are currently four near non-attainment areas within Texas: Austin, San Antonio, Tyler/Longview and
 Corpus Christi, according to Bushell.
<H3>
Health Studies of Ozone
</H3>
<P>The Task Force has called for funding of a $654,000 study of the health effects on humans of ozone at different
 concentration levels. Results of the new study may be used to persuade legislators who are reviewing standards
 for federal nonattainment.
<P>&quot;If funds can be found, we think it is smart to examine the real health indications of going to an eight-hour
 averaged standard for determination of nonattainment. It makes sense to study the real health effects of          
 ozone concentration at different levels and to apply the standards that science supports,&quot; Bushell said.
<P>Rod Larson, an assistant professor of environmental engineering at Texas A&amp;M University &#173; Kingsville, told the
 Task Force a new study of health effects of ozone exposure in ranges from 70 ppb to 120 ppb could be con
ducted for a cost of $500,000  to $700,000.
<P>According to Larson, who has reviewed existing health studies, ozone at 160 ppb has an adverse effect on
 someone doing heavy exercise for extended periods of time. The existing studies also indicate that there is no
 health risk at 100 ppb levels for an eight hour period. There is even substantial evidence suggesting a positive
 health impact up to and including this level of ozone.
<P>&quot;A level of 100 parts per billion is safe even according to OSHA (the federal government's Occupational Safety
 and Health Administration) standards,&quot; Bushell said.
<P>According to an October 11, 1995 <i>Corpus Christi Caller-Times</I>
 &quot;Letters to the Editor&quot; response written by
 Bushell, &quot;Sampling done for 'Project Sea Breeze' conducted by the TNRCC in the 1970s indicates our area
 would exceed that 80 ppb standard even if we moved our air monitors to the island. It would seem that Mother
 Nature periodically creates ozone at that level or that it comes in from other areas over which we have no
 control.&quot;
<H3>
Manmade Sources of Ozone-Forming Emissions
</H3>
<P> While the Ozone Task Force report noted that major industry is the source of 62 percent of Nitrogen Oxide
 emissions (Nox) and 41 per cent of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs, a key component in the formation of
 ozone), motor vehicles were shown to contribute 37 percent of the Nox emissions and 41 percent of the      
 VOC emissions.
<P>Various VOC Reduction Rates and their associative costs per ton of abated VOC were included.  For example:
<P>Citywide Reformulated Gas Use
<P>     9.5% VOC reduction
<P>     $1,016/ton abated
<P>Gas Station Recovery System     
<P>     2.8% VOC reduction
<P>     $3,500/ton abated 
<P>Marine Loading Controls
<P>     17.0% VOC reduction
<P>     $4,519/ton abated
<P>Auto Inspection Program
<P>     4.3% VOC reduction
<P>     $3,000/ton abated
<P>Car Pooling
<P>     4.3% VOC reduction
<P>These figures show a significant VOC reduction could be achieved by installing vapor recovery systems at
 marine loading facilities and truck loading facilities, but at the highest cost.
<P>So what are local refineries doing about this?
<H3>
Valero Refinery      
</H3>
<P>According to John Hohnholt, Vice President and General Manager of Valero Refining Company, the TNRCC
 and local industries are already cooperating on proactive measures to reduce ozone-forming pollutants (Nox and
 VOC).
<P>&quot;The TNRCC is doing a good job of getting the industry interested in being proactive. TNRCC past chairman
 Hall came down to ask us to join Clean Texas 2000. The Clean Texas 2000 plan was designed to reduce toxic
 emissions by 50 percent by the year 2000. As an industrial company, we became a member of the Clean Texas
 2000 program to show our commitment to improving the quality of our environment,&quot; Hohnholt stated.
<P>&quot;The Board of Trade is comprised of 16 industries around our area. They're working together as a group. Each
 industrial group is participating on Ozone Action Days. We haven't made long-term VOC and Nox emission
 plans jointly, but each industry is doing so individually,&quot; Hohnholt said. 
<P>&quot;The Texas A&amp;M &#173; Kingsville study concluded that the largest VOC reduction (17.0 percent) could be achieved
 with marine loading controls.
<P>&quot;Some of the refineries have vapor control systems on their petrochemical loading facilities which consists of a
 vapor combustor that reduces VOC emission,&quot; Hohnholt said. &quot;Valero Refinery installed a Marine Vapor Recov
ery System (MVRU) designed to recover vapors from 100 percent of the gasoline and gasoline blend compo
nents loaded by barge or ship. The MVRU reduced plant VOC emissions by 50 percent. We have also installed,     
 throughout our plant, low-Nox burners to reduce Nox emission. Average Nox emission is currently 0.07 lb. per
 million BTUs released,&quot; Hohnholt said.
<P>&quot;We are committed to proactive environmental improvements, even though they are costly,&quot; Hohnholt stated.
 &quot;Valero is a long-term player, committed to our community.&quot;
<P>Valero's environmental commitment has been acknowledged. In April, 1995, Valero was named winner of the
 1995 Governor's Award for Environmental Excellence, in recognition of the company's voluntary pollution
 prevention efforts. The company was chosen from more than 350 applications which were reviewed and            
 scored by Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission staff members, representatives of industry, envi
ronmental groups, and others.
<P>Then TNRCC Chairman John Hall stated, &quot;Valero has continued to be an example of how industry can play a
 key role in helping lead the way to reducing air emissions and preserving valuable resources in Texas. This is of
 particular importance here in Corpus Christi because the city is one of the only heavy industry cities in the
 United States that is an attainment area for EPA air quality standards.&quot;
<H3>
CITGO Refinery     
</H3>
<P>Chuck Cazalas, spokesman for CITGO Corpus Christi Refinery, agrees that environmental improvements are a
 costly, but vital, investment that CITGO continues to make in Corpus Christi. 
<P>&quot;CITGO has spent millions of dollars in improving equipment to reduce emissions including Nox and VOCs.
 For example, when we take tanks out of service they are retrofitted with the latest seal technology to ensure that
 emissions are contained,&quot; Cazalas said.
<P> &quot;The company has spent millions of dollars controlling emissions at its refinery operations and is now finaliz
ing installation of vapor control systems on its marine loading operations here in Corpus Christi,&quot; Cazalas
 stated. &quot;We're in mid-stage and hope it will be online and operational sometime in 1996.&quot; 
<P>&quot;We are also very excited about our refinery's neural network system for heater controls,&quot; Cazalas continued.
 &quot;We believe we're ahead of the curve in our approach on this neural network, which in simple terms, is a com
puter program designed to monitor numerous actions during processing to help predict emissions and to                 
 take corrective and preventive action to minimize heater emissions.&quot;
<P> CITGO's Corpus Christi refinery has neural networks installed on two steam boilers. 
<P>While the 1990 Federal Clean Air Act Amendments require manfacturers to install Continuous Emission Moni
toring Systems (CEMs) to verify compliance with the emission limits, the Software CEM at CITGO goes
 beyond simple measurement of emissions to provide insight into the causes of emissions. 
<P>&quot;The models for both boilers were developed from process data such as steam rate, fuel gas rate, fuel composi
tion, steam pressure and temperatures to predict Nox levels,&quot; stated Valerie Minnix Pompa, Advanced Computer
 Applications Group Leader at CITGO. &quot;It can calculate optimal settings to reduce emissions.&quot; 
<P>CITGO has applied to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for this project to become a part of their En-        
 vironmental Regulation Excellence and Leadership Project, the purpose of which is to find cleaner, cheaper and
 smarter ways to protect the environment. If accepted, the EPA Region VI and possibly the TNRCC would each
 supply a person experienced in computer modeling to work with CITGO in verifying project results. 
<P>&quot;By working together on the project, the EPA, the TNRCC and the rest of the industry can see what is happen
ing at Corpus Christi,&quot; said Phil Vrazel, manager of environmental affairs at CITGO Corpus Christi refinery,
 &quot;and hopefully, the Software CEMs will be included in the revised EPA Title V, Enhanced Monitoring Regula
tions.&quot;
<P>CITGO is already planning to develop neural network models for the Saturate Gas Plant and to build additional
 models for the remaining boilers. 
<P>&quot;Our employees feel confident that we are committed to reducing emissions and improving the environment,&quot;
 Cazalas concluded, &quot;and we want the community to feel confident of our commitment too.&quot;
<H3>
Koch Refining Company
</H3>
<P>According to Rich Tuttle, Regional Public Affairs Director of Koch Industries, Koch Refining Company is a
 charter member of the Texas Clean Industries 2000 and is firmly committed to a policy that protects the environ
ment as well as the health and safety of residents and employees.
<P>&quot;Industry has done a good job in this initiative, but we must continue to improve our environmental steward
ship,&quot; Tuttle said.
<P>During the past seven years, Koch has invested nearly 100 million dollars in environmental systems and equip
ment that further reduce emissions and continues to improve its environmental commitment. Five years ago,
 Koch installed a marine vapor recovery system (MVRU) for loading ocean-going vessels and also has vapor
 recovery systems in place at its truck loading racks.
<P>&quot;Another important factor for Koch is that most of its refined products (gasoline, jet fuel and diesel) is trans
ported by pipeline to key markets in Texas including San Antonio, Austin, Waco and Dallas / Ft. Worth,&quot; Tuttle
 added. &quot;Pipeline trans portation has significant impact on reducing emissions, and further, Koch also uses          
 vapor recovery systems at terminal locations where the refined products are used.&quot; 
<P>Koch announced this past January that it will be expanding its Texas pipeline to key markets in Texas.
<P>&quot;Koch has installed best available technology on its expansion projects that further reduces emissions. The
 company also has installed low Nox burners on its processing units,&quot; Tuttle said.
<P>&quot;During Ozone Action days, Koch reviews operations to determine areas that can be eliminated or reduced and
 encourages its employees to take steps to help efforts to keep Corpus Christi an attainment city,&quot; Tuttle said.
<P>John Wadsworth, Koch Refining Company Vice President and Refinery Manager said, &quot;We are in a partnership             
 with our community and we recognize that we must demonstrate leadership in our commitment to responsible
 environmental policies that improve the quality of life in  the Coastal Bend.&quot;     
<H3>
The Mayor's Perspective:
</H3>
<P>Corpus Christi Mayor Mary Rhodes agrees that sacrifices are being made by industry and more need to be made
 by citizens to diminish ozone formation and to avoid the nonattainment designation.
<P>According to the Mayor, &quot;Industry has been the reason we have kept the attainment so far. They make the
 sacrifices on alert day, because they understand the consequences  to industry if we lose attainment.&quot;
&quot;The public needs to understand that they need to make sacrifices, because they will be hit hard if we lose
 attainment, both with inconveniences and personal dollars,&quot; Mayor Rhodes said.
<P>Other industries, as well as Central Power and Light Company, the City of Corpus Christi and Nueces County
 also are taking action to reduce ozone emissions, particularly on Ozone Action Days.
<H3>
Central Power and Light Company
</H3>
<P>Although Central Power and Light Company is not a major contributor to the air pollution problem, it is taking
 a leadership role in reducing smog-producing emissions.
<P>According to Ray Allen, an environmental consultant for Central Power and Light Company, &quot;CPL generates
 very little volatile organic compounds, but all combustion processes, including boiler processes, generate nitro
gen oxide.&quot;
<P>CPL spokesman Andy Heines said CPL has placed a communications plan into effect to advise supervisors
 through E-Mail and phone calls, when an Ozone Advisory is in effect. &quot;They alert employees to advise what
 they should and shouldn't do that day,&quot; Heines said.
<P>Some of the action steps CPL is committed to taking on Ozone Action Days according to the company's Ozone
 Alert Communication Plan include:
<P>&#183; Ban fueling of vehicles in morning hours (when ozone formation is more likely);
<P>&#183; Ban use of gas-powered lawnmowers and tree trimming activities in metropolitan areas;
<P>&#183; Postpone painting, construction or maintenance activities that generate air emissions;
<P>&#183; Encourage employees to drive less frequently and to carpool;
<P>&#183; Delay generator testing;
<P>&#183; Reschedule fuel deliveries.
<H3>
Benefits of Using Reformulated Gasoline
</H3>
<P>The Texas A&amp;M &#173; Kingsville study for the task force showed that citywide use of reformulated gasoline could
 provide a 9.5 percent VOC reduction at an estimated cost of $1,016/ton abated.
<P>While all City of Corpus Christi vehicles now operate on reformulated gasoline (RFG), a push is needed to
 promote greater RFG usage among citizens.
<P>RFG usage does not require any capital outlay to retrofit automobiles or infrastructure and the additional cost of
 RFG is expected to be only three or four cents per gallon more at the service station pump.
<P>RFG has a lower vapor pressure than conventional gasoline (7.2 psi for RFG versus 7.8 psi for conventional
 summertime gasoline), which means it will not evaporate as readily into the air from vehicle fuel tanks or
 service station pumps during refilling.
<P>With citywide use of RFG, Corpus Christi could expect reductions in ozone, air toxics, greenhouse gases,
 particulate matter, sulfur, lead and other pollutants at minimal coststotheconsumers'pocketbooksorlifestyle.
<H3>
Conclusion
</H3>
<P>Both automotive and industrial emissions must be reduced to have a significant impact on reducing ozone
 formation in Corpus Christi.
<P>Debate continues over what is an acceptable level of ozone for human health, but common sense and the city's
 economic well-being dictate that any new standard of measure to be used for determining nonattainment should
 be based on the best available, scientific, health research data and not on arbitrary politics. 
<P>While area industries have been addressing the problem of reducing ozone-forming emissions for more than a
 year and continue to spend millions of dollars on corrective and preventive actions, now is the time for more
 individual citizens to personally take enviromentally-responsible action.
<P>Your city needs you to learn what you can do about keeping our air clean and to start doing it.

Local Company Helps Industrial Businesses Maximize Handling of Bulk Products
</H1>
<P>In the industrial sector of the Bay Area, businesses looking for new opportunities are the ones which will
 succeed in the future and help Corpus Christi's Commerce and Trade Industry grow. Material Handling
 Services, Inc. is such a business.
<P>Material Handling Services, Inc. (MHS) is a local company who's expertise lies primarily in bulk handling
 and logistical management. MHS recognizes the need for value-added services that heavy industries must
 have in order to optimize their own core businesses. Thevalueaddedservices that MHS provides
 encompassspecialtyprocessing and throughput/transportation of solid fuels, ores, industrial ash, aggregates,
 etc.
<P>MHS looks to create bulk handling opportunities by utilizing a network of reliable companies dedicated to
 providing select services for MHS throughout the United States, particularly along the Gulf Coast, the East
 Coast and parts of Central and South America. 
<P>When working with a client, MHS initially conducts a situational assessment and problem analysis that
 eventually develops into a &quot;customized&quot; strategy involving traditionalaswellasnontraditionalsolutions.
<P><i>What are the expectations and boundaries of the customer's current objective? Have all systems been identi
fied? What resources are available? Who has what level of authority?</I>
 &#173; These types of questions are asked by Ron Enderle, president of MHS, in order to accurately identify and resolve the underlying problem instead of
 merely treating the symptoms. Enderle and the staff of MHS continually look for new opportunities that
 strengthen the client's core business, whether it is improving a process, providing a lower cost throughput
 alternative, or developing a program that maximizes utilization of the client's internal asset base.
<P>Enderle attributes his entrepreneurial spirit and creative drive to the environment he worked in for twelve
 years with Koch Industries. &quot;You had to have the attitude of an owner to survive at Koch,&quot; Enderle said.
 Koch's innovative and systematic surroundings taught him to search for and implement the most effective
 tools needed to improve and sustain business at hand. These teachings refined the &quot;attitude of an owner&quot; in
 Enderle; ultimately driving him to seek out new and more rewarding challenges &#173; MHS.
<P>As MHS was in the planning phase, Enderle determined that a strong staff would be necessary to exceed
 customers' expectations and for MHStogrowexpediently. Crickett Enderle, co-owner of MHS and formerly
 purchasing agent for a major gas compressor manufacturer, became the Projects Manager for MHS. An
 Accounts Manager was added to assist with the workload, as well as an Administrative Assistant. &quot;Crickett
 and I continuously challenge MHS to have an environment where sincerity, enthusiasm, and perfection are the
 cornerstones for employee success and customer satisfaction,&quot; Enderle said.
<P>A lean but proficient staff allows MHS to pursue opportunities for active clients and prospective clients alike.
 To do this, MHS continuously seeks out alternatives that are not always apparent at first glance. &quot;Corpus
 Christi has a great opportunity to capture new business that relates to dry bulk imports/exports and to improve
 service and cost for business already established,&quot; Enderle said.
<P>An example of an alternative MHS has helped bring to reality is the expansion of a marine/barge terminal
 owned by Bay, Inc. This terminal, known as &quot;Bay Dock&quot;, will soon be accepting deepwater vessels for                   
 the handling of various import/export dry bulk products. Bay Dock is a viable alter-    native for dry bulk users
 in Corpus Christi and offers import/export bulk handling services that should compliment the current services
 available through the Port of Corpus Christi.
<P>This is an example of what Enderle   envisions MHS doing for companies in the Bay Area and across the
 United States. Within three years, a MHS satellite office on the East Coast is highly probable. This will allow
 MHS to grasp bulk handling opportunitiesdawningeveryd
ayinthatregion.
<P>But with this vision, Enderle knows that there will be hardships along the way. &quot;Dealing with the perception
 by others that MHS is just a &quot;broker&quot; of services remains a real challenge,&quot; Enderle said.
<P>&quot;MHS is about solving problems and developing real opportunity. MHS is a total value provider who solves
 and prevents pro blems while bringing attention to otherwise missed opportunities,&quot; Enderle stated.
<H4>

Melvyn N. Klein Named Executive in Residence, Adjunct Professor of 
Business at Texas A&amp;M &#173; Corpus Christi
</H3>
<P>Melvyn N. Klein, international investor, attorney and entrepreneur will serve as Texas A&amp;M University &#173;
 Corpus Christi's first ever Executive in Residence and Adjunct Professor of Business.
<P>Klein is currently president of JAKK Holding Corporation, which is the managing general partner of GKH
 Partners, L.P. Klein is well known on Wall Street and in international financial circles. His firm GKH, was a
 major participant in the takeover battle for RJR Nabisco. GKH later effected the last major successful lever
aged-buy-out of the era of the 1980s, American Medical International. GKH also is a major investor in Santa Fe
 Energy Resources, Inc., Hanover Compressor Corporation, UGHC/Arcus and Cockrell Oil &amp; Gas, L.P. GKH
 was a co-founder of Savoy Pictures Enter tainment, Inc. and is its largest shareholder. Savoy is a major motion
 picture producer and distributor.
<P>As Executive in Residence and Adjunct Professor of Business, Klein will be a member of the faculty, serve as a
 guest lecturer, a mentor of younger faculty members in the College of Business and work with students on
 research projects. He will have an office on the TAMU-CC campus.
<P>&quot;Mr. Klein is the first person our university has appointed to the prestigious position of Executive in Residence,&quot;
 says TAMU-CC President Robert Furgason. &quot;Such a position involves individuals who have had notable careers
 and are agreeable to sharing with our students and faculty their expertise and experiences.&quot;
<H3>
<P>Marion Luna Brem Provides New Car for University Use
</H3>
<P>Dr. Robert R. Furgason, president of Texas A&amp;M University &#173; Corpus Christi, is driving in style thanks to
 Marion Luna Brem, owner of Love Chrysler Plymouth, who recently provided Furgason with a brand new 1996
 Chrysler Concorde.
<P>&quot;It's our customers who've made it possible for Love Chrysler Plymouth to share it's successes with Texas
 A&amp;M University &#173; Corpus Christi,&quot; Ms. Brem remarked. &quot;After all, the successes of 'our' University will
 naturally be shared with our entire community. Sharing, that's what 'love' is all about.&quot;
<P>&quot;Due to the generosity of Marion and Love Chrysler Plymouth, the University and the taxpayers save a substan
tial amount of money,&quot; said Furgason. The car dealership now provides TAMU-CC's president with a new car
 for business purposes, exchanging the vehicle approximately every six months. &quot;It would take the equivalent of
 a $100,000 endowment to obtain the same services Marion Luna Brem is providing the University,&quot; explained
 Furgason.
<H3>
<P>Del Mar College Named One of &quot;100 Top Associate Degree Producers&quot; in the United States
</H3>
<P>Del Mar College is included in three separate rankings in the <i>
Community College Week</I> special report issue of &quot;Top Associate Degree Producers.&quot; The analysis covers college-level associate degrees awarded for the 1991-92
 academic year. It provides rankings for the institutions which conferred the highest number of degrees out of
 3,402 post-secondary institutions in the U.S. and its outlying areas. The data for the study came from the U.S.
 Department of Education.
<P>&#183; Del Mar College ranks number 9 in the list of the 50 top Associate Degrees Conferred to Hispanic American
 Students in All Disciplines.
<P>&#183; Del Mar College ranks number 47 in the list of the 100 Top Associate Degrees Conferred to All Minority
 Students in All Disciplines.
<P>&#183; Del Mar College ranks number 68 in the list of Top Associate Degree Producers in Health Professions and
 Related Sciences.
<P>&quot;The 1991-92 degree analysis continues [<i>
Community College Week's</I>] tradition of bringing to light those U.S.
 colleges and universities that contribute the largest numbers of college-educated Americans,&quot; says analyst Victor
 M.H. Borden, Ph.D., director of Information Management and Institutional Research, Indiana University &#173;
 Purdue University at Indianapolis.
<H3>
<P>College to Announce Largest Single Endowment in Drama
</H3>
<P>A $50,000 scholarship fund has been established as a tribute to retired assistant professor of drama Sue Finley
 and her 18year career in theatre arts at Del Mar College. The fund is the largest single endowment in drama the
 College has received.
<P>Sophomore drama major Kelly Dahl is the first recipient of the newly created Sue Sellors Finley Endowed
 Theatre Scholarship. &quot;It couldn't have come at a better time,&quot; remarks Dahl of the $1,000 scholarship. &quot;Initially
 it was a shock,&quot; she says, &quot;I immediately felt honored to be the first student to receive Sue's scholarship.&quot;
<P>With the scholarship monies, Dahl, a 1994 King High School Graduate, plans to continue her drama studies at
 Columbia College in Chicago.
<P>Finley established the Del Mar Mime Crew in 1977, when she first began as a part-time instructor. Del Mar
 Drama's annual &quot;Mime Plus One Acts&quot; has attracted a devoted public ever since.
<P>Finley, who began teaching full-time in 1987, revived the drama program when she directed &quot;Our Town&quot; in
 1986, which kicked off the College's first full season of theater in more than 20 years. In 1990, she launched
 Del Mar's first annual summer Shakespeare Fest.
<P>Prior to her work at Del Mar, Finley had accumulated 15-plus years of experience as a creative dramatics
 teacher at such places as the Harbor Playhouse and St. James Episcopal School.
<P>An actor in her own right, Finley is probably best remembered for her original production, &quot;Legendary Ladies
 of Texas,&quot; which won a Sammy Award in 1969.
<P>In 1995, Finley received the &quot;Y Women in Careers&quot; award honoring her for 34 years of outstanding achieve
ment in the artistic field as actor, director and educator. She wrote, &quot;My greatest career satisfaction has been
 helping to develop a drama program at Del Mar from nothing. I have a love of and commitment to making plays
 and working with you people&quot;
<P>Finley received her bachelor's degree in social science from SMU in 1961, did graduate work at the Dallas
 Theatre Center and earned her master's degree in communication from Texas A&amp;I University at Corpus Christi
 in 1976.
<P>College drama director Frederick, who has worked closely with Finley on numerous productions, says the new
 fund will be used to award scholarships each year to Del Mar drama students in both fall and spring semesters.
 Amounts of the scholarship will vary.
<H3>
<P>Del Mar Receives Sought-After State Energy Conservation Grant
</H3>
<P>In January, Del Mar College will begin construction improvements on three East Campus Buildings made
 possible by a $100,000 matching grant from the Texas State Energy Conservation Office.
<P>The College applied for the grant, &quot;Energy Conservation Measures,&quot; funded by the US Department of Energy.
 The grant provides funds to state public institutionsthat comeupwithcreativeenergysavingmeasures.
<P>The College will spend $200,000 from its physical facilities budget but will be reimbursed $100,000 as costs are
 incurred. &quot;In essence, the College is doing $200,000 worth of improvements for only $100,000 because the
 grant is paying half,&quot; says Joe Alaniz, vice president of business and finance.
<P>Alaniz explains that the College is switching out old technology for more energy efficient equipment. Through
 energy savings, the College will recoup its investment within four years.

Economic Indicators
</H1>
<P>In the third quarter of 1995, the Corpus Christi economy maintained a distance runner's pace &#173; slightly ahead of
 last year's pace while being mindful not to get too far ahead too quickly and burn itself out.
<P>Local consumers kept buying goods at a respectable rate. Sales tax payments from the State Comptroller's
 Office to the city were almost dead even with 1994's year -to-date total. Totals were down just 0.1 percent
 through September, totaling $19,035,307 compared to 1994's year to date total of $19,055,163. And new car
 sales reached 12,727 &#173; an increase of 2.9 percent over the 12,367 new cars sold through September of 1994.
<P>The home market also continued to get healthy after getting slightly wounded early in the year. After a rocky
 start, existing home sales kept closing the gap between this year's and last year's sales. Through September,
 Realtors sold 1,978 existing homes, 10.4 percent behind last year's 2,207 homes sold through September.
 However, 3rd quarter sales continued to show the home market's resilience when compared to sales earlier this
 year &#173; 2nd quarter year-to-date sales were 19.4 percent behind the 1994 year to date totals. Ditto the improved
 outlook for single-family home starts. Through September, starts totaled 549, 21.5 percent down form 1994's
 year-to-date count of 699. But the month-to-month totals are increasingly positive. Consider this: home starts
 finished the 1st quarter of the year 28 percent behind last year's pace. Clearly, new home builders have closed
 the gap.
<P>In related activity, total new construction in Corpus Christi continues to do very well. Total construction valua
tions through September reached $155.3 million, 2.03 percent ahead of the 1994 year-to-date total of $152.2
 million.
<P>The employment picture continues to look bright. Through September, total employment in the Corpus Christi
 area reached 161,307, compared to 158,561 through September in 1994. Unemployment in September 1995
 totaled 15,076, or 8.5 percent. That's slightly higher than the unemployment total of 14,262 (8.3 percent) regis
ter last year through September. However, nearly 3,000 more people have been put to work this year as busi
nesses continue hiring while the available labor force continues to swell.
<P>Corpus Christi's outlook for hosting tourists and convention delegates remained good, despite relatively low
 numbers early in the fiscal year. Through the Alliance's Convention &amp; Visitors Department (CVD) first two
 months of their fiscal year, 15,471 delegates have been hosted in Corpus Christi. That's a 49 percent decrease
 from the 30,278 delegates hosted during the first two months last fiscal year, but the large conventions the CVD
 has booked aren't scheduled until later in the year, and the outlook remains positive. Year-to-date hotel tax
 receipts through September totaled $3,311,345, a 4.5 percent jump over the $3,169,617 collected through the
 3rd quarter of 1994.
<P>Hotel occupancy rate, however, was down 2.3 percent through August (September figures weren't yet available),
 at 66.8 percent compared to 68.4 percent through August 1994. But with several new hotels opening for busi
ness, local hotel room availability was up 3.5 percent, and room revenue increased to $55.4 million over last
 year's $52.82 million (a 4.9 percent increase). Airlines serving Corpus Christi moved more passengers in and
 out of Corpus Christi. Passenger traffic at Corpus Christi International Airport was up 0.8 percent, at 711,902
 passengers this year vs. 706,216 last year. Even more impressive is the fact that airlines offered fewer total seats
 this September than last year (68,555 total seats in September 1995 compared to 74,812 in 1994). Not only did
 airlines serve more passengers, but their planes left fuller than they did last year.
<P>Monthly activity at the port was slightly behind last year's pace during the third quarter, as is year-to-date
 tonnage. Through September, 57.4 million tons of goods went in and out of the Port of Corpus Christi, 1.06
 percent increase over last year's 56.8 million tons. Air freight moving through Corpus Christi International
 Airport is still behind last year, totaling 4.12 million pounds through September (30.4 percent below over last
 year's 5.92 million pounds). Again, airlines concentrated more commuter flights, which carry very little cargo,
 in and out of the city.
<H3>
ACCRA Second Quarter 1995 Cost of Living Index
</H3>
<P>No huge surprises came about when the ACCRA Cost of Living Index for the second quarter 1995 was released,
 which showed that Corpus Christi is still a very affordable place to call home. With the national cost of living
 average set at 100 percent, our town's cost of living came in with a composite rating of 94.4 percent &#173; a good
 5.6 percent below the average cost of the 323 United States urban areas listed.
<P>In fact, most cities in Texas fared very well in the index. Dallas rated as the most expensive with a rating of
 102.5 &#173; only 2.5 percent above the national average. San Marcos, in Austin's metro area, rated 99.8. San Anto
nio again registered slightly lower than Corpus Christi at 94.0, and Houston came in at 96.3. The least expensive
 area in Texas was Brownsville-Harlingen-San Benito, which rated at 89.4 percent. Overall, the majority of
 Texas cities proved to be below the rest of the country in affordability.
<P>Texas looks all the more inviting when compared to other large cities that topped the Index. New York City was
 by far the priciest place to live, coming in at 232.2 (NYC's housing index alone came in at 461.5). Moving
 along the Atlantic coast, Boston was listed at 139.8, Washington D.C. came in at 127.4, and Philadelphia rated
 127.1. On the West Coast, San Francisco rated 156.6, San Diego rated at 122.8 and Los Angeles rated at 122.2.
<P>The ACCRA Cost of Living Index measures relative differences between the cost of various consumer goods
 and services. At the beginning of each quarter, each participating urban area prices a standardized list of 59
 items. The index components include grocery items, housing costs (purchase and rental costs), utilities, health
 care, transportation, and miscellaneous goods and services.<BR>

<HR NO SHADE=2><P>
<P> Since the financial services industry would be directly affected by problems related to Year 2000 and subsequent millennium changes, in September of 1995, the Data Management Division (DMD) formed a <A HREF="sia09zf.htm">committee</A> to promote industry awareness of the business and technology issues.  The working committee comprised of member firms meets on a regular basis to identify common problems and define alternative solutions while insuring the development of efficient and uniform practices and procedures in the industry.<P>
The committee has accomplished a great deal in a short time, including:<P>
<UL>
<LI>identification of numerous issues resulting from the Year 2000 and millennium change<BR>
<LI>identification of specific manufacturers, machine models and software having the potential for failure<BR>
<LI>identification of several approaches addressing the issues and problems known so far<BR>
<LI>communication of all findings to members on a timely basis<BR>
<LI>conducting a detailed survey to solicit specific information from member firms to gauge industry readiness
</UL>
<P>
The committee is planning to:<P>
<UL>
<LI>conduct another survey aimed at industry service bureaus, exchanges and entities external to the industry<BR>
<LI>devise a method to confirm findings with entities of origin<BR>
<LI>conduct a controlled industry-wide test scenario with service bureaus, exchanges and other entities to ensure industry-wide compliance concerning the Year 2000 and the millenium change
</UL>
<P>
The DMD takes seriously the issue of being Year 2000 compliant.   It has devoted a substantial amount of resources to study the Year 2000 problem and will continue to devote the necessary resources to reduce any potential risk and ensure industry-wide compliance.  Every firm must decide for itself which approach to Year 2000 works best.  DMD will work with its members to help them address these problems in the manner that causes them and their customers the least disruption.  The Data Management Division is confident that the securities industry will be prepared for the Year 2000.<HR>

<FONT SIZE=+1>The <strong>Securities Industry Association</strong> (SIA) is the securities industry's trade association representing the business interests of more than <A HREF="sia01b.htm">700 member securities firms</A> throughout North America.</FONT><BR><BR>
<HR NOSHADE SIZE=1>
<FONT SIZE=5><IMG SRC="goldball.gif"> <STRONG>History</STRONG></FONT><P>
The Securities Industry Association (SIA) was formed in 1972 by the merger of two predecessor trade organizations -- the Investment Banker's Association <I>(founded in 1912)</I> and the Association of Stock Exchange Firms <I>(1913)</I>. SIA embodies a long history of industry service and representation.<P>
<HR NOSHADE SIZE=1>
<FONT SIZE=5><IMG SRC="goldball.gif"> <STRONG>Mission</STRONG></FONT><P>
SIA is the trade association for the securities industry. SIA members are securities organizations of virtually all types -- brokers, dealers, large national firms, investment banks, mutual fund companies, regional firms, local firms, money managers and others. SIA members are active in all exchange markets, in the over-the-counter market and in all phases of corporate and public finance. Collectively, they provide investors with a full spectrum of securities and investment services and account for about 90% of the securities firm revenue in the United States.<P>Through its member-composed <A HREF="sia01c.htm">Board of Directors</A>, its political <A HREF="sia03a.htm#Grass">Grassroots Network </A>of 5,000 volunteers and its 35 working <A HREF="sia01d.htm">committees</A>, SIA presents a strong, unified force;  represents members' interests  in Washington and serves as a liaison between the industry, the regulators and the exchanges;  offers a broad range of <A HREF="sia00.htm#serv">services</A>, enabling its members to operate more efficiently and effectively;  and serves as a medium through which ideas, experience and information can be exchanged for the benefit of members and for their clients.<P><BR><BR>
