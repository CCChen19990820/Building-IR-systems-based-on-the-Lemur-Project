<h2>HIRING SOMEONE TO WORK IN YOUR HOME</h2>
<p>Definition of &quot;employee&quot;</p>
<p>Anyone who performs services is an employee if you, as an employer, can control what is done and how it will be done. This is 
so even if the right to control the work is not exercised. It also does not matter whether the person works full-time or part- time, 
permanently or on a temporary basis.</p>
<p>A household worker is an employee who performs domestic services in a private home, local college club, or local college 
fraternity or sorority chapter. Household workers include:</p>
<p>o babysitters, companions for the elderly or infirm, maids, caretakers, nurses, housekeepers, cooks, butlers, family chauffeurs, 
and maintenance personnel.</p>
<p>Babysitting that is performed in the caretaker's home does not establish an employer-employee relationship, because the 
caretaker controls when and how the work is performed. Also, independent contractors, self-employed persons and 
representatives of an agency or au pair program who work in or around the home are not employees.</p>
<p>To determine whether an individual is an employee, file Form SS- 8, Determination of Employee Work Status for Purposes of 
Federal Employment Taxes and Income Tax Withholding, with the Local Internal Revenue Service (IRS). In addition, IRS 
Publication 15, Circular E, Employers Tax Guide, and Publication 937, Employment Taxes and Information Returns, provide 
guidelines for determining whether an employer-employee relationship exists.</p>
<h4>Initial Steps When Hiring</h4>
<p>One of the first steps to take when hiring a new employee is to establish the employee's identity and employment eligibility. This 
can be done by having the employee complete the Employment Eligibility Verification Form, Form I-9, at the time of hire. The 
employee must present documents from those listed on the form as acceptable to establish identity and employment eligibility. 
The employer must review these documents and attest that these documents appear to be genuine and relate to the individual 
hired. The employer retains the Form I-9 and must present it, if requested, to officers of the Immigration and Naturalization 
Service (INS), the Department of Labor, or the Office of Special Counsel for Immigration-Related Unfair Employment 
Practices.</p>
<p>Form I-9 can be found in the Handbook for Employers (M-274) available in limited quantities from the local office of the INS. 
In addition to containing the Form I-9, the Handbook answers many commonly asked questions regarding the employment 
verification procedures.</p>
<h4>Federal Insurance Contribution Act (FICA)</h4>
<p>The Federal Insurance Contribution Act (FICA) finances a Federal system of old age, survivors, disability, and hospital 
insurance that is generally referred to as social security and Medicare. Employers are required to withhold and pay social security 
and Medicare taxes for a private household employee, if $50 or more in cash wages are paid during a calendar quarter. The law 
does not apply to a worker who is a spouse, a child under age 21 or a parent working in the home. There are exceptions to a 
parent working in the home which can be found in the instructions for filing Form 942.</p>
<p>The 1993 FICA tax is 15.30 percent (an equal contribution of 7.65 percent from the employer and employee), which is remitted 
to the Internal Revenue Service on a quarterly basis, using Form 942, the Employer's Quarterly Federal Tax Return for 
Household Workers. More detailed information about FICA withholdings can be found in IRS Publication 926, Employment 
Taxes for Household Employers. Employers can voluntarily pay their employees' portion of FICA taxes and report the amount 
as a part of wages.</p>
<h4>Federal and State Unemployment Taxes</h4>
<p>The unemployment insurance program provides some income protection to domestic workers who have lost their jobs. The 
program is operated jointly by the Federal and State governments, with the State establishing standards for the payment of 
benefits. Under the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) employers are required to make quarterly tax payments on 
domestic wages of $1,000 or more during a calendar quarter for the current or previous year. State requirements differ from 
State to State; however, in most cases, an employer must also pay a State unemployment tax. Usually, the employer receives a 
credit for the State Unemployment Tax when filing the Federal Unemployment Tax. In jurisdictions where employers are not 
required by law to participate in a program, they may do so voluntarily.</p>
<h4>State Workers' Compensation</h4>
<p>Workers' compensation programs provide income and medical benefits to employees (and their survivors) when a work-related 
injury or death occurs. In many States (and in the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico) domestic workers are covered by 
workers' compensation. Coverage, however, will differ from State to State based on the number of employees to be covered, 
the amount of wages paid, or the number of hours worked. In States where there is no mandatory coverage, employers are 
permitted to provide voluntary coverage, except in Louisiana, Missouri, Virginia and Wyoming.</p>
<h4>Earned Income Credit (EIC)</h4>
<p>The EIC is a cash refundable Federal tax credit that can be collected in advance or at the end of the tax year. It is available to 
low-income working families with children under age 19 (or 24, if in school full-time). EIC is also available if the employee's child 
is permanently and totally disabled, regardless of age.</p>
<p>Form W-5, Earned Income Credit Advance Payment Certificate, must be completed if the employee requests the EIC during the 
year. An employer can also approach the employee about completing the Form W-5. Notice 797, &quot;Notice of a Possible Federal 
Tax Refund Due to the Earned Income Credit&quot;, explains the employee's right to request the EIC in advance.</p>
<p>In addition, an employee who does not have a Social Security number (SSN) can get one by completing Form SS-5, 
Application for a Social Security Card. This form can be obtained at local offices of the Social Security Administration or by 
calling 1- 800-SSA-1213.</p>
<p>The employer's identification number (EIN) is issued by the Internal Revenue Service. The EIN is used to complete quarterly and 
annual employer's tax forms. An employer can apply for an EIN by completing Form SS-4, Application for Employer 
Identification Number. The form can be ordered by calling 1-800- TAXFORM. If the employer's tax forms are being filed for 
the first time and the employer has not applied for an EIN, the employer should write &quot;NONE&quot; in the space provided for the 
EIN. The Internal Revenue Service will then assign an EIN.</p>
<h4>Federal and State Laws Related to Domestic Worker's Wages Minimum Wage and Overtime Pay</h4>
<p>Under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) domestic workers are entitled to minimum wages and overtime pay. However, 
casual babysitters and companions for the elderly and infirm are exempt from coverage. The 1993 Federal minimum wage is 
$4.25 an hour. Some States' minimum wage rates are higher than the Federal rate. The Federal law permits certain benefits, such 
as meals and lodging, to be counted as a part of wages. However, meals and lodging are not subject to social security and 
Medicare taxes if they are furnished for the employer's convenience, on the employer's premises, and as a condition of 
employment.</p>
<p>Domestic workers are also entitled to 1 1/2 times their regular rate of pay for hours in excess of 40 a week unless the employee 
resides in the household where employed. The Federal law does not require premium pay for weekends, holiday work or daily 
overtime; nor does it require rest periods, discharge notices, or severance pay. Also, FLSA does not limit the number of hours 
an employee may be required or scheduled to work, if the employee is age 16 or older. More detailed information about FLSA 
can be obtained from the Wage and Hour Division of the Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor. 
The address and phone number can be found under the Federal government section of the local telephone directory.</p>
<h4>Federal and State Income Tax Withholdings</h4>
<p>Income tax withholdings lessen the employee's burden of having to pay a lump sum tax at the end of the year. Employers are not 
required to withhold income tax on wages paid to a private household employee. However, if the household employee requests 
withholding payments and the employer agrees, the employer should give the employee the appropriate State and Federal 
withholding forms to complete. Form W-4, Employee's Withholding Allowance Certificate is the Federal form. IRS Publication 
15, Circular E, Employer's Tax Guide, contains withholding tables for computing the amount of Federal withholdings. Employers 
can obtain a booklet containing the State income tax withholding tables from a State tax office.</p>
<h4>Other Important Tax Forms</h4>
<p>An employer must furnish copies of Form W-2, Wage and Tax Statement, to an employee from whom income, social security, 
or Medicare taxes have been withheld or an Earned Income Credit has been paid in advance. If an employer has more than one 
Form W-2 to file, the information must be summarized on the Form W-3, Transmittal of Income and Tax Information.</p>
<p>Copies of Form W-2 must be furnished to employees shortly after December 31, but no later than January 31 of the following 
year. Form W-2 is processed by the Social Security Administration to update employees' earnings records. The Social Security 
Administration provides IRS with the income tax data it needs from the Form W-2.</p>
<p>Form 941, Employer Quarterly Federal Tax Return, can be used instead of Form 942, if an employer has both domestic and 
other types of employees.</p>
<p>Below is a list of Federal publications and tax forms to assist employers of household workers. They can also be ordered by 
calling the toll-free telephone numbers for the IRS or Social Security Administration, 1-800-TAXFORM and 1-800-SSA-1213 
respectively. For copies of State publications and tax forms, contact State local tax offices. Failure to comply with Federal and 
State wage and tax laws can result in civil monetary penalties.</p>

<h2 align=center>&quot;Home Buyer's Vocabulary&quot;</h2>
<h4>Preface </h4>
<p>The potential home buyer will find this Vocabulary helpful for understanding words and terms used in real estate transactions. 
There are, however, some factors that may affect these definitions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Terms are defined as they are commonly understood in the mortgage and real estate industry. The same terms may have 
different meanings in another context. </li>
<li>The definitions are intentionally general, non- technical and short. They do not encompass all possible meanings or nuances 
that a term may acquire in legal use. </li>
<li>State laws, as well as custom and use in various States or regions of the country, may modify or completely change the 
meanings of certain terms defined.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before signing any documents or depositing any money preparatory to entering into a real estate contract, the purchaser should 
consult with an attorney of his choice to ensure that his rights are properly protected.</p>
<dl>
<dd><h3>A </h3>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Abstract (Of Title)</strong> </dt>
<dd>A summary of the public records relating to the title to a particular piece of land. An attorney or title insurance company 
reviews an abstract of title to determine whether there are any title defects which must be cleared before a buyer can 
purchase clear, marketable, and insurable title. </dd>
<dt><strong>Acceleration Clause </strong></dt>
<dd>Condition in a mortgage that may require the balance of the loan to become due immediately, if regular mortgage 
payments are not made or for breach of other conditions of the mortgage. </dd>
<dt><strong>Agreement of Sale</strong> </dt>
<dd>Known by various names, such as contract of purchase, purchase agreement, or sales agreement according to location or 
jurisdiction. A contract in which a seller agrees to sell and a buyer agrees to buy, under certain specific terms and 
conditions spelled out in writing and signed by both parties. </dd>
<dt><strong>Amortization</strong> </dt>
<dd>A payment plan which enables the borrower to reduce his debt gradually through monthly payments of principal. </dd>
<dt><strong>Appraisal</strong> </dt>
<dd>An expert judgment or estimate of the quality or value of real estate as of a given date. </dd>
<dt><strong>Assumption of Mortgage</strong> </dt>
<dd>An obligation undertaken by the purchaser of property to be personally liable for payment of an existing mortgage. In an 
assumption, the purchaser is substituted for the original mortgagor in the mortgage instrument and the original mortgagor is 
to be released from further liability in the assumption, the mortgagee's consent is usually required.<p>The original mortgagor should always obtain a written release from further liability if he desires to be fully released under 
the assumption. Failure to obtain such a release renders the original mortgagor liable if the person assuming the mortgage 
fails to make the monthly payments</p>
<p>. An &quot;Assumption of Mortgage&quot; is often confused with &quot;purchasing subject to a mortgage.&quot; When one purchases subject to 
a mortgage, the purchaser agrees to make the monthly mortgage payments on an existing mortgage, but the original 
mortgagor remains personally liable if the purchaser fails to make the monthly payments. Since the original mortgagor 
remains liable in the event of default, the mortgagee's consent is not required to a sale subject to a mortgage.</p>
<p>Both &quot;Assumption of Mortgage&quot; and &quot;Purchasing Subject to a Mortgage&quot; are used to finance the sale of property. They 
may also be used when a mortgagor is in financial difficulty and desires to sell the property to avoid foreclosure.</p>
<h3>B </h3>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Binder or &quot;Offer to Purchase&quot;</strong> </dt>
<dd>A preliminary agreement, secured by the payment of earnest money, between a buyer and seller as an offer to purchase 
real estate. A binder secures the right to purchase real estate upon agreed terms for a limited period of time. If the buyer 
changes his mind or is unable to purchase, the earnest money is forfeited unless the binder expressly provides that it is to 
be refunded. </dd>
<dt><strong>Broker</strong> </dt>
<dd>(See real estate broker) </dd>
<dt><strong>Building Line or Setback</strong> </dt>
<dd>Distances from the ends and/or sides of the lot beyond which construction may not extend. The building line may be 
established by a filed plat of subdivision, by restrictive covenants in deeds or leases, by building codes, or by zoning 
ordinances. <h3>C </h3>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Certificate of Title</strong> </dt>
<dd>A certificate issued by a title company or a written opinion rendered by an attorney that the seller has good marketable 
and insurable title to the property which he is offering for sale. A certificate of title offers no protection against any hidden 
defects in the title which an examination of the records could not reveal. The issuer of a certificate of title is liable only for 
damages due to negligence. The protection offered a homeowner under a certificate of title is not as great as that offered in 
a title insurance policy. </dd>
<dt><strong>Closing Costs</strong> </dt>
<dd>The numerous expenses which buyers and sellers normally incur to complete a transaction in the transfer of ownership of 
real estate. These costs are in addition to price of the property and are items prepaid at the closing day. This is a typical 
list: <pre>

BUYER'S EXPENSES                     SELLER'S EXPENSES


Documentary Stamps on Notes          Cost of Abstract
Recording Deed and Mortgage          Documentary Stamps on Deed
Escrow Fees                          Real Estate Commission
Attorney's Fee                       Recording Mortgage
Title Insurance                      Survey Charge
Appraisal and Inspection             Escrow Fees
Survey Charge                        Attorney's Fee

The agreement of sale negotiated previously between the buyer and the seller may state in writing who will pay each of the above costs.</pre>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Closing Day</strong> </dt>
<dd>The day on which the formalities of a real estate sale are concluded. The certificate of title, abstract, and deed are 
generally prepared for the closing by an attorney and this cost charged to the buyer. The buyer signs the mortgage, and 
closing costs are paid. The final closing merely confirms the original agreement reached in the agreement of sale. </dd>
<dt><strong>Cloud (On Title)</strong> </dt>
<dd>An outstanding claim or encumbrance which adversely affects the marketability of title. </dd>
<dt><strong>Commission</strong> </dt>
<dd>Money paid to a real estate agent or broker by the seller as compensation for finding a buyer and completing the sale. 
Usually it is a percentage of the sale price- - 6 to 7 percent on houses, 10 percent on land. </dd>
<dt><strong>Condemnation</strong> </dt>
<dd>The taking of private property for public use by a government unit, against the will of the owner, but with payment of just 
compensation under the government's power of eminent domain. Condemnation may also be a determination by a 
governmental agency that a particular building is unsafe or unfit for use. </dd>
<dt><strong>Condominium</strong> </dt>
<dd>Individual ownership of a dwelling unit and an individual interest in the common areas and facilities which serve the multi- 
unit project. </dd>
<dt><strong>Contract of Purchase</strong> </dt>
<dd>(See agreement of sale) </dd>
<dt><strong>Contractor</strong> </dt>
<dd>In the construction industry, a contractor is one who contracts to erect buildings or portions of them. There are also 
contractors for each phase of construction: heating, electrical, plumbing, air conditioning, road building, bridge and dam 
erection, and others. </dd>
<dt><strong>Conventional Mortgage</strong> </dt>
<dd>A mortgage loan not insured by HUD or guaranteed by the Veterans' Administration. It is subject to conditions 
established by the lending institution and State statutes. The mortgage rates may vary with different institutions and 
between States. (States have various interest limits.) </dd>
<dt><strong>Cooperative Housing</strong> </dt>
<dd>An apartment building or a group of dwellings owned by a corporation, the stockholders of which are the residents of the 
dwellings. It is operated for their benefit by their elected board of directors. In a cooperative, the corporation or 
association owns title to the real estate. A resident purchases stock in the corporation which entitles him to occupy a unit 
in the building or property owned by the cooperative. While the resident does not own his unit, he has an absolute right to 
occupy his unit for as long as he owns the stock. <h3>D </h3>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Deed</strong> </dt>
<dd>A formal written instrument by which title to real property is transferred from one owner to another. The deed should 
contain an accurate description of the property being conveyed, should be signed and witnessed according to the laws of 
the State where the property is located, and should be delivered to the purchaser at closing day. There are two parties to 
a deed: the grantor and the grantee. (See also deed of trust, general warranty deed, quitclaim deed, and special warranty 
deed.) </dd>
<dt><strong>Deed of Trust</strong> </dt>
<dd>Like a mortgage, a security instrument whereby real property is given as security for a debt. However, in a deed of trust 
there are three parties to the instrument: the borrower, the trustee, and the lender, (or beneficiary). In such a transaction, 
the borrower transfers the legal title for the property to the trustee who holds the property in trust as security for the 
payment of the debt to the lender or beneficiary. If the borrower pays the debt as agreed, the deed of trust becomes void. 
If, however, he defaults in the payment of the debt, the trustee may sell the property at a public sale, under the terms of the 
deed of trust. In most jurisdictions where the deed of trust is in force, the borrower is subject to having his property sold 
without benefit of legal proceedings. A few States have begun in recent years to treat the deed of trust like a mortgage. </dd>
<dt><strong>Default </strong></dt>
<dd>Failure to make mortgage payments as agreed to in a commitment based on the terms and at the designated time set forth 
in the mortgage or deed of trust. It is the mortgagor's responsibility to remember the due date and send the payment prior 
to the due date, not after. Generally, thirty days after the due date if payment is not received, the mortgage is in default. In 
the event of default, the mortgage may give the lender the right to accelerate payments, take possession and receive rents, 
and start foreclosure. Defaults may also come about by the failure to observe other conditions in the mortgage or deed of 
trust. </dd>
<dt><strong>Depreciation</strong> </dt>
<dd>Decline in value of a house due to wear and tear, adverse changes in the neighborhood, or any other reason. </dd>
<dt><strong>Documentary Stamps</strong> </dt>
<dd>A State tax, in the forms of stamps, required on deeds and mortgages when real estate title passes from one owner to 
another. The amount of stamps required varies with each State. </dd>
<dt><strong>Downpayment</strong> </dt>
<dd>The amount of money to be paid by the purchaser to the seller upon the signing of the agreement of sale. The agreement of 
sale will refer to the downpayment amount and will acknowledge receipt of the downpayment. Downpayment is the 
difference between the sales price and maximum mortgage amount. The downpayment may not be refundable if the 
purchaser fails to buy the property without good cause. If the purchaser wants the downpayment to be refundable, he 
should insert a clause in the agreement of sale specifying the conditions under which the deposit will be refunded, if the 
agreement does not already contain such clause. If the seller cannot deliver good title, the agreement of sale usually 
requires the seller to return the downpayment and to pay interest and expenses incurred by the purchaser. </dd>
<dt><strong>Earnest Money</strong> </dt>
<dd>The deposit money given to the seller or his agent by the potential buyer upon the signing of the agreement of sale to show 
that he is serious about buying the house. If the sale goes through, the earnest money is applied against the downpayment. 
If the sale does not go through, the earnest money will be forfeited or lost unless the binder or offer to purchase expressly 
provides that it is refundable. </dd>
<dt><strong>Easement Rights</strong> </dt>
<dd>A right- of- way granted to a person or company authorizing access to or over the owner's land. An electric company 
obtaining a right- of- way across private property is a common example. </dd>
<dt><strong>Encroachment</strong> </dt>
<dd>An obstruction, building, or part of a building that intrudes beyond a legal boundary onto neighboring private or public 
land, or a building extending beyond the building line. </dd>
<dt><strong>Encumbrance</strong> </dt>
<dd>A legal right or interest in land that affects a good or clear title, and diminishes the land's value. It can take numerous 
forms, such as zoning ordinances, easement rights, claims, mortgages, liens, charges, a pending legal action, unpaid taxes, 
or restrictive convenants. An encumbrance does not legally prevent transfer of the property to another. A title search is all 
that is usually done to reveal the existence of such encumbrances, and it is up to the buyer to determine whether he wants 
to purchase with the encumbrance, or what can be done to remove it. </dd>
<dt><strong>Equity</strong> </dt>
<dd>The value of a homeowner's unencumbered interest in real estate. Equity is computed by subtracting from the property's 
fair market value the total of the unpaid mortgage balance and any outstanding liens or other debts against the property. A 
homeowner's equity increases as he pays off his mortgage or as the property appreciates in value. When the mortgage and 
all other debts against the property are paid in full the homeowner has 100% equity in his property. </dd>
<dt><strong>Escrow</strong> </dt>
<dd>Funds paid by one party to another (the escrow agent) to hold until the occurrence of a specified event, after which the 
funds are released to a designated individual. In FHA mortgage transactions an escrow account usually refers to the funds 
a mortgagor pays the lender at the time of the periodic mortgage payments. The money is held in a trust fund, provided by 
the lender for the buyer. Such funds should be adequate to cover yearly anticipated expenditures for mortgage insurance 
premiums, taxes, hazard insurance premiums, and special assessments. <h3>F </h3>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Foreclosure</strong> </dt>
<dd>A legal term applied to any of the various methods of enforcing payment of the debt secured by a mortgage, or deed of 
trust, by taking and selling the mortgaged property, and depriving the mortgagor of possession. <h3>G </h3>
</dd>
<dt><strong>General Warranty Deed</strong> </dt>
<dd>A deed which conveys not only all the grantor's interests in and title to the property to the grantee, but also warrants that if 
the title is defective or has a &quot;cloud&quot; on it (such as mortgage claims, tax liens, title claims, judgments, or mechanic's liens 
against it) the grantee may hold the grantor liable. </dd>
<dt><strong>Grantee</strong> </dt>
<dd>That party in the deed who is the buyer or recipient. </dd>
<dt><strong>Grantor</strong> </dt>
<dd>That party in the deed who is the seller or giver. <h3>H </h3>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Hazard Insurance</strong> </dt>
<dd>Protects against damages caused to property by fire, windstorms, and other common hazards. </dd>
<dt><strong>HUD</strong> </dt>
<dd>U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Office of Housing/Federal Housing Administration within HUD 
insures home mortgage loans made by lenders and sets minimum standards for such homes. <h3>I </h3>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Interest</strong> </dt>
<dd>A charge paid for borrowing money. (See mortgage note) <h3>L </h3>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Lien</strong> </dt>
<dd>A claim by one person on the property of another as security for money owed. Such claims may include obligations not 
met or satisfied, judgments, unpaid taxes, materials, or labor. (See also special lien.) <h3>M </h3>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Marketable Title</strong> </dt>
<dd>A title that is free and clear of objectionable liens, clouds, or other title defects. A title which enables an owner to sell his 
property freely to others and which others will accept without objection.</dd>
<dt><strong>Mortgage</strong> </dt>
<dd>A lien or claim against real property given by the buyer to the lender as security for money borrowed. Under government- 
insured or loan- guarantee provisions, the payments may include escrow amounts covering taxes, hazard insurance, water 
charges, and special assessments. Mortgages generally run from 10 to 30 years, during which the loan is to be paid off.</dd>
<dt><strong>Mortgage Commitment</strong> </dt>
<dd>A written notice from the bank or other lending institution saying it will advance mortgage funds in a specified amount to 
enable a buyer to purchase a house.</dd>
<dt><strong>Mortage Insurance Premium</strong> </dt>
<dd>The payment made by a borrower to the lender for transmittal to HUD to help defray the cost of the FHA mortgage 
insurance program and to provide a reserve fund to protect lenders against loss in insured mortgage transactions. In FHA 
insured mortgages this represents an annual rate of one- half of one percent paid by the mortgagor on a monthly basis.</dd>
<dt><strong>Mortgage Note</strong> </dt>
<dd>A written agreement to repay a loan. The agreement is secured by a mortgage, serves as proof of an indebtedness, and 
states the manner in which it shall be paid. The note states the actual amount of the debt that the mortgage secures and 
renders the mortgagor personally responsible for repayment.</dd>
<dt><strong>Mortgage (Open- End)</strong> </dt>
<dd>A mortgage with a provision that permits borrowing additional money in the future without refinancing the loan or paying 
additional financing charges. Open- end provisions often limit such borrowing to no more than would raise the balance to 
the original loan figure.</dd>
<dt><strong>Mortgagee</strong> </dt>
<dd>The lender in a mortgage agreement.</dd>
<dt><strong>Mortgagor</strong> </dt>
<dd>The borrower in a mortgage agreement.<h3>P </h3>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Plat</strong> </dt>
<dd>A map or chart of a lot, subdivision or community drawn by a surveyor showing boundary lines, buildings, improvements 
on the land, and easements.</dd>
<dt><strong>Points</strong> </dt>
<dd>Sometimes called &quot;discount points.&quot; A point is one percent of the amount of the mortgage loan. For example, if a loan is 
for $25,000, one point is $250. Points are charged by a lender to raise the yield on his loan at a time when money is tight, 
interest rates are high, and there is a legal limit to the interest rate that can be charged on a mortgage. Buyers are 
prohibited from paying points on HUD or Veterans' Administration guaranteed loans (sellers can pay, however). On a 
conventional mortgage, points may be paid by either buyer or seller or split between them.</dd>
<dt><strong>Prepayment</strong> </dt>
<dd>Payment of mortgage loan, or part of it, before due date. Mortgage agreements often restrict the right of prepayment 
either by limiting the amount that can be prepaid in any one year or charging a penalty for prepayment. The Federal 
Housing Administration does not permit such restrictions in FHA insured mortgages.</dd>
<dt><strong>Principal</strong> </dt>
<dd>The basic element of the loan as distinguished from interest and mortgage insurance premium. In other words, principal is 
the amount upon which interest is paid.</dd>
<dt><strong>Purchase Agreement</strong> </dt>
<dd>See agreement of sale.<h3>Q </h3>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Quitclaim Deed</strong> </dt>
<dd>A deed which transfers whatever interest the maker of the deed may have in the particular parcel of land. A quitclaim 
deed is often given to clear the title when the grantor's interest in a property is questionable. By accepting such a deed the 
buyer assumes all the risks. Such a deed makes no warranties as to the title, but simply transfers to the buyer whatever 
interest the grantor has. (See deed.)<h3>R </h3>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Real Estate Broker</strong> </dt>
<dd>A middle man or agent who buys and sells real estate for a company, firm, or individual on a commission basis. The 
broker does not have title to the property, but generally represents the owner.</dd>
<dt><strong>Refinancing</strong> </dt>
<dd>The process of the same mortgagor paying off one loan with the proceeds from another loan.</dd>
<dt><strong>Restrictive Covenants</strong> </dt>
<dd>Private restrictions limiting the use of real property. Restrictive covenants are created by deed and may &quot;run with the land,&quot; 
binding all subsequent purchasers of the land, or may be &quot;personal&quot; and binding only between the original seller and buyer. 
The determination whether a covenant runs with the land or is personal is governed by the language of the covenant, the 
intent of the parties, and the law in the State where the land is situated. Restrictive covenants that run with the land are 
encumbrances and may affect the value and marketability of title. Restrictive covenants may limit the density of buildings 
per acre, regulate size, style or price range of buildings to be erected, or prevent particular businesses from operating or 
minority groups from owning or occupying homes in a given area. (This latter discriminatory covenant is unconstitutional 
and has been declared unenforceable by the U.S. Supreme Court.)<h3>S </h3>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Sales Agreement</strong> </dt>
<dd>See agreement of sale.</dd>
<dt><strong>Special Assessments</strong> </dt>
<dd>A special tax imposed on property, individual lots or all property in the immediate area, for road construction, sidewalks, 
sewers, street lights, etc.</dd>
<dt><strong>Special Lien</strong> </dt>
<dd>A lien that binds a specified piece of property, unlike a general lien, which is levied against all one's assets. It creates a 
right to retain something of value belonging to another person as compensation for labor, material, or money expended in 
that person's behalf. In some localities it is called &quot;particular&quot; lien or &quot;specific&quot; lien. (See lien.)</dd>
<dt><strong>Special Warranty Deed</strong> </dt>
<dd>A deed in which the grantor conveys title to the grantee and agrees to protect the grantee against title defects or claims 
asserted by the grantor and those persons whose right to assert a claim against the title arose during the period the grantor 
held title to the property. In a special warranty deed the grantor guarantees to the grantee that he has done nothing during 
the time he held title to the property which has, or which might in the future, impair the grantee's title.</dd>
<dt><strong>State Stamps</strong> </dt>
<dd>See documentary stamps</dd>
<dt><strong>Survey</strong> </dt>
<dd>A map or plat made by a licensed surveyor showing the results of measuring the land with its elevations, improvements, 
boundaries, and its relationship to surrounding tracts of land. A survey is often required by the lender to assure him that a 
building is actually sited on the land according to its legal description.<h3>T </h3>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Tax</strong> </dt>
<dd>As applied to real estate, an enforced charge imposed on persons, property or income, to be used to support the State. 
The governing body in turn utilizes the funds in the best interest of the general public.</dd>
<dt><strong>Title</strong> </dt>
<dd>As generally used, the rights of ownership and possession of particular property. In real estate usage, title may refer to the 
instruments or documents by which a right of ownership is established (title documents), or it may refer to the ownership 
interest one has in the real estate.</dd>
<dt><strong>Title Insurance</strong> </dt>
<dd>Protects lenders or homeowners against loss of their interest in property due to legal defects in title. Title insurance may be 
issued to a &quot;mortgagee's title policy.&quot; Insurance benefits will be paid only to the &quot;named insured&quot; in the title policy, so it is 
important that an owner purchase an &quot;owner's title policy&quot;, if he desires the protection of title insurance.</dd>
<dt><strong>Title Search or Examination</strong> </dt>
<dd>A check of the title records, generally at the local courthouse, to make sure the buyer is purchasing a house from the legal 
owner and there are no liens, overdue special assessments, or other claims or outstanding restrictive convenants filed in the 
record, which would adversely affect the marketability or value of title.</dd>
<dt><strong>Trustee</strong> </dt>
<dd>A party who is given legal responsibility to hold property in the best interest of or &quot;for the benefit of&quot; another. The trustee 
is one placed in a position of responsibility for another, a responsibility enforceable in a court of law. (See deed of trust.)<h3>Z </h3>

<h4>Q. WHAT IS A &quot;HOME INSPECTION&quot;?</h4>
<p>A home inspection is an objective visual examination of the physical structure and systems of a home, from the roof to the 
foundation. The standard home inspector's report will include an evaluation of the condition of the home's heating system, central 
air conditioning system (temperature permitting), interior plumbing and electrical systems; the roof, attic, and visible insulation; 
walls, ceilings, floors, windows and doors; the foundation, basement, and visible structure.</p>
<p>Having a home inspected is like giving it a physical check&#169;up. If problems or symptoms are found, the inspector will refer you to 
the appropriate specialist or tradesperson for further evaluation.</p>
<h4>Q. Why do I need a home inspection?</h4>
<p>The purchase of a home is probably the largest single investment you will ever make. You should learn as much as you can about 
the condition of the property and the need for any major repairs before you buy, so that you can minimize unpleasant surprises 
and difficulties afterwards.</p>
<p>Of course, a home inspection will also point out the positive aspects of a home, as well as the maintenance that will be necessary 
to keep it in good shape. After the inspection, you will have a much clearer understanding of the property you are about to 
purchase, and will be able to make a confident buying decision.</p>
<p>If you have owned your home for a long time, a home inspection can identify problems in the making and recommend preventive 
measures which might avoid costly future repairs. In addition, home sellers may opt for having an inspection prior to placing the 
home on the market to gain a better understanding of conditions which the buyer's inspector may point out. This provides an 
opportunity to make repairs that will put the house in better selling condition.</p>
<h4>Q. What will it cost?</h4>
<p>The inspection fee for a typical one&#169;family house varies geographically, as does the cost of housing. Similarly, within a given 
area, the inspection fee may vary depending upon the size of the house, particular features of the house, its age, and possible 
additional services, such as septic, well, or radon testing. It is a good idea to check local prices on your own.</p>
<p>However, do not let cost be a factor in deciding whether or not to have a home inspection, or in the selection of your home 
inspector. The knowledge gained from an inspection is well worth the cost, and the lowest&#169;priced inspector is not necessarily a 
bargain. The inspector's qualifications, including his experience, training, and professional affiliations, should be the most 
important consideration.</p>
<h4>Q. Can't I do it myself?</h4>
<p>Even the most experienced home owner lacks the knowledge and expertise of a professional home inspector who has inspected 
hundreds, perhaps thousands, of homes in his or her career. An inspector is familiar with all the elements of home construction, 
their proper installation, and maintenance. He or she understands how the home's systems and components are intended to 
function together, as well as how and why they fail.</p>
<p>Above all, most buyers find it very difficult to remain completely objective and unemotional about the house they really want, and 
this may affect their judgement. For the most accurate picture, it is best to obtain an impartial third&#169;party opinion by an expert in 
the field of home inspection. </p>
<h4>Q. Can a house fail inspection?</h4>
<p>No. A professional home inspection is an examination of the current condition of your prospective home. It is not an appraisal, 
which determines market value, or a municipal inspection, which verities local code compliance. A home inspector, therefore, will 
not pass or fail a house, but rather describe its physical condition and indicate what may need repair or replacement.</p>
<h4>Q. How do I find a home inspector? </h4>
<p>The best source is a friend, or perhaps a business acquaintance, who has been satisfied with, and can recommend, a home 
inspector they have used. In addition, the names of local inspectors can be found in the Yellow Pages where many advertise 
under &quot;Building Inspection Service&quot; or &quot;Home Inspection Service&quot;. Real estate agents are also generally familiar with the service, 
and should be able to provide you with a list of names from which to choose.</p>
<p>Whatever your referral source, be sure to ascertain the home inspector's professional qualifications, experience, and business 
ethics before you make your selection. You can do this by checking with the local consumer affairs office or Better Business 
Bureau, as well as by verifying the inspector's membership in a reputable professional association.</p>
<p>Since there are no licensing requirements for home inspectors [except in Texas], you will want to make certain that such an 
association has a set of nationally recognized practice standards and a code of ethics. This provides members with professional 
inspection guidelines, and prohibits them from engaging in any conflict of interest activities which might compromise their 
objectivity, such as using the inspection as a means to obtain home repair contracts.</p>
<p>The association should also have rigorous membership and continuing education requirements to assure consumers of an 
inspector's experience and technical qualifications.</p>
<h4>Q. When do I call in the home inspector?</h4>
<p>A home inspector is typically called right after the contract or purchase agreement has been signed, and is often available within a 
few days. However, before you sign, be sure that there is an inspection clause in the contract, making your purchase obligation 
contingent upon the findings of a professional home inspection. This clause should specify the terms to which both the buyer and 
seller are obligated.</p>
<h4>Q. Do I have to be there?</h4>
<p>It's not necessary for you to be present for the inspection, but it is recommended. By following the home inspector around the 
house, by observing and asking questions, you will learn a great deal about the condition of the home, how its systems work, and 
how to maintain it. You will also find the written report easier to understand if you've seen the property first&#169;hand through the 
inspector's eyes.</p>
<h4>Q. What if the report reveals problems?</h4>
<p>No house is perfect. If the inspector finds problems, it doesn't necessarily mean you shouldn't buy the house, only that you will 
know in advance what to expect. A seller may be flexible with the purchase price or contract terms if major problems are found. 
If your budget is very tight, or if you don't wish to become involved in future repair work, this information will be extremely 
important to you.</p>
<h4>Q. What if I find problems after I move into my new home?</h4>
<p>A home inspection is not a guarantee that problems won't develop after you move in. However if you believe that a problem was 
already visible at the time of the inspection and should have been mentioned in the report, your first step should be to call and 
meet with the inspector to clarify the situation. Misunderstandings are often resolved in this manner.</p>
<p>If necessary, you might wish to consult with a local mediation service to help you settle your disagreement. Though many home 
inspectors today carry Errors &amp; Omissions liability insurance, litigation should be considered a last resort. It is difficult, 
expensive, and by no means a sure method of recovery.</p>
<h4>Q. If the house proves to be in good condition, did I really need an inspection?</h4>
<p>Definitely. Now you can complete your home purchase with peace of mind about the condition of the property and all its 
equipment and systems. You will also have learned a few things about your new home from the inspector's report, and will want 
to keep that information for future reference. Above all, you can feel assured that you are making a well&#169;informed purchase 
decision, and that you will be able to enjoy your new home the way you want to.</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Home Water Treatment Units -- August 1993</h2>
<p>Produced in cooperation with the Environmental Protection Agency</p>
<p>Whenever you turn on the tap at home, you may wonder if chemicals or particles are affecting the taste or appearance of your 
drinking water. You may even worry about harmful organisms, like bacteria, or chemical pollutants, like pesticides or industrial 
solvents.</p>
<p>If you suspect a problem with your drinking water, you may have thought about buying a home water treatment unit. This 
brochure discusses what to consider before buying a water treatment unit and the various types available. It also warns against 
high-pressure salespersons who use scare tactics or make false claims to sell you a unit -- whether or not you need one.</p>
<h4>How Do I Know if I Need a Unit?</h4>
<p>Consumers get their drinking water primarily from two sources: public water supplies and private wells.</p>
<p>Under the Safe Drinking Water Act, all public water supplies must meet the drinking water standards set by the Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA). Some states have even more stringent standards. For information about the quality of your public 
drinking water, contact your local water utility office.</p>
<p>In contrast, private well owners are subject only to state and local laws, and they are responsible for the quality of water from 
their wells. Most well water is safe; however, some may need treatment. For help with possible drinking water problems in a 
private well, contact your local health department.</p>
<p>If you want to have your water analyzed, use a state-approved testing laboratory. To find out where you can get a list of 
state-certified labs, call the EPA's Safe Drinking Water Hotline at 1-800-426-4791.</p>
<p>If you discover a problem with your drinking water, you may want to hire a competent water-quality contractor to help you 
select the appropriate water treatment unit.</p>
<h4>What Kind of Units Are Available?</h4>
<p>If you discover a problem with your water, select a unit specifically designed to treat it. No single unit will solve all water 
problems. This section describes some common types of water treatment units and explains how they work.</p>
<h4>Physical filters</h4>
<p>These simple units are designed to remove particles from the water, such as grit, sediment, dirt, and rust. They often are made of 
fabric, fiber, ceramic, or other screening material. Some filters can remove even small organisms like cysts and bacteria and small 
particles like asbestos fibers. The filters are inadequate for microbiologically unsafe water because they cannot remove all 
disease-causing organisms.</p>
<h4>Activated carbon filters</h4>
<p>These filters may improve the smell, taste and appearance of your drinking water by removing some organic chemical 
contaminants. They cannot remove most inorganic chemicals -- like salts or metals -- but may reduce some, like chlorine. Do not 
use these filters exclusively on water that contains harmful organisms. To remove lead from your drinking water, get a 
specially-prepared activated carbon filter. Ask the salesperson for a written assurance of its effectiveness against lead.</p>
<p>Carbon filters may become saturated with the chemical impurities they remove. This is especially true with activated carbon 
filters. Also, municipal drinking water usually carries harmless levels of bacteria even though it has been disinfected. These 
bacteria can collect and multiply on an activated carbon filter. Therefore, you should change the filter cartridge according to the 
manufacturer's instructions.</p>
<p>Before purchasing an activated carbon filter, ask whether the filter can be replaced. If so, find out how often it should be 
replaced; how to tell when it needs to be replaced; where you can buy replacement filters and how much they cost. Activated 
carbon filters are available in several forms: granular; powdered; powdered coated paper; and pressed carbon block.</p>
<p>Carbon filters, registered as bacteriostatic by the EPA, have the pesticide silver in the filter. Under the Federal Insecticide, 
Fungicide and Rodenticide Act, these filters must be registered with the EPA. This does not mean that the EPA recommends, 
approves, or endorses the product.</p>
<p>Studies on the effectiveness of bacteriostatic filters have shown unpromising results as to their ability to control bacterial growth. 
Further, a bacteriostatic carbon filter is not adequate to treat water that is microbiologically unsafe, such as fecally-contaminated 
water.</p>
<h4>Reverse osmosis (RO) units</h4>
<p>With these units, water passes through a membrane and is collected in a storage tank. RO units remove substantial amounts of 
most inorganic chemicals, such as salts, metals (including lead), asbestos, minerals, nitrates, and some organic chemicals. RO 
units alone are not recommended for use on microbiologically unsafe water.</p>
<p>RO units have several disadvantages. They typically waste about 75 percent of the tap water put into them. For one gallon of 
RO filtered water, it may take four gallons or more of tap water. Also, the tap on the storage tank flows more slowly than the tap 
on your regular faucet.</p>
<p>The membranes on RO units are subject to decay and failure and must be replaced periodically. Follow the manufacturer's 
recommendations about proper maintenance and use.</p>
<p>\plain \s1 \f20 \fs24 \b Distillation units\plain \s1 \f20 \fs24 </p>
<p>These units, which are available in many different shapes and sizes, vaporize water and then condense it. This process removes 
most dissolved solids, such as salts, metals, minerals, asbestos fibers, particles, and some organic chemicals. Distillation units, 
however, may not remove all chemical pollutants, and some bacteria may pass through in some instances. Although distillation 
may be an effective water treatment, the water heating will add to your energy use.</p>
<h4>Ultraviolet (UV) disinfection</h4>
<p>These units may destroy bacteria and inactivate viruses, without leaving a taste or odor in the water. UV units cannot remove 
most chemical pollutants. The EPA questions whether UV is effective against spores and cysts.</p>
<p>As with all water treatment units, UV disinfection units must be properly maintained. Dissolved and suspended solids from the 
water may build up on the unit, blocking the ultraviolet light from reaching the running water. To ensure that the water is 
adequately exposed to the light, UV units must be cleaned periodically.</p>
<h4>What Else Should I Consider?</h4>
<p>Once you determine which type of unit you need, comparison shop for costs, cancellation and refund policies, installation 
methods, maintenance requirements, and warranties.</p>
<p>Installation. Ask how the unit must be installed and who is responsible for doing it. If it must be done by a professional, ask 
whether the unit's purchase price includes installation Some units are installed under the kitchen sink and treat all cold water going 
into the tap. Other ones only treat water diverted from the cold water line and deliver it to a separate faucet. Some units are 
mounted on the faucet, while others rest on the counter top.</p>
<p>Maintenance. To be effective, water treatment units must be maintained properly. Some units require more maintenance than 
others.</p>
<p>Before you buy, ask about the unit's maintenance requirements and, if possible, review the owner's manual or manufacturer's 
recommendations. You might find out how often unit parts must be replaced, the cost of replacement parts, and where they can 
be bought -- whether from local stores or only from the manufacturer. After using a water treatment unit for a time, be aware of 
changes in sediment, water pressure, and taste in your water. Such changes may indicate that the filter should be replaced.</p>
<p>Warranties. If a filter comes with a written warranty, take the time to read what parts and costs are covered under the warranty, 
and, if you have problems with the unit, whether you can get a replacement or a refund. Ask where repairs would be done. If the 
unit needs to be repaired by the manufacturer, ask how long the repair usually takes and who pays shipping charges.</p>
<h4>How Can I Protect Myself From Deceptive Sales Practices?</h4>
<p>While many sellers of water treatment units are legitimate, some are not. Be wary if you're told:</p>
<p>&quot;The water in your area is contaminated.&quot;</p>
<p>As part of their sales pitches, some dealers may falsely claim that the drinking water in your area contains a harmful level of 
chemical contaminants, such as chlorine or lead. Verify the dealer's claims about your drinking water with your local or state 
department of health.</p>
<p>&quot;Our product is approved by the government.&quot;</p>
<p>Some sellers claim that certain government agencies require or recommend widespread use of water filters in homes or 
restaurants. They even may claim that the government has approved a particular unit. Both claims are false.</p>
<p>If you see an EPA registration number on a product label, it merely means that the manufacturer has registered its product with 
the EPA. It does not indicate that the EPA has tested or approved the product or substantiated the manufacturer's claims.</p>
<p>&quot;Our in-home test shows your water is unsafe.&quot;</p>
<p>To get a foot in the door, some sellers advertise free in-home test of your drinking water. While in-home testing may be a 
legitimate sales tool, some promoters use unsophisticated tests to convince you that you need to buy their product.</p>
<p>For example, a salesperson may test only for acidity/alkalinity, water hardness, iron, manganese, and color. None of these 
indicate the presence of harmful contaminants. Others may test only for chlorine, which may be present in your drinking water but 
not at harmful levels.</p>
<p>&quot;You have won a prize!&quot;</p>
<p>Some companies send out postcards saying that you have been selected to receive a prize. You must dial a phone number, 
usually toll-free, to get more details. If you call, you may discover that you must buy a water treatment unit to be eligible for a 
prize. The unit may cost hundreds of dollars, but the prize may be of little or no value.</p>
<p>&quot;Now, we just need your credit card number...&quot;</p>
<p>Sometimes telemarketers request your credit card number, saying they need to verify your eligibility for a prize or to bill your 
account. Be cautious about giving your credit card number over the phone to someone you do not know.</p>
<p>Many consumers who have purchased water treatment units from telephone salespersons have found later that the units do not 
remove contaminants from the water. In addition, they found it difficult -- or impossible -- to cancel an order or return the 
product for a refund.</p>
<h4>Where Can I Get More Information?</h4>
<p>Before you buy a water treatment device from a manufacturer unfamiliar to you, contact your state consumer affairs office or 
your local Better Business Bureau. Find out if they have received any complaints against the company. Other resources are listed 
below.</p>

<h4>What if I Have a Complaint?</h4>
<p>To resolve problems concerning a water treatment unit, first try settling your dispute with the company that sold you the product.</p>
<p>If you are not satisfied, contact your local consumer protection agency or state Attorney General. You also can contact your 
local Better Business Bureau (BBB).</p>
<p>To find the BBB office nearest you, check your telephone directory, or write: Council of Better Business Bureaus 4200 Wilson 
Boulevard Arlington, Virginia 22203</p>
<p>To report a complaint about possible sales misrepresentations, call: National Fraud Information Center Consumer Assistance 
Hotline 1-800-876-7060 9 a.m. - 5 p.m. EST, Monday -- Friday</p>
<p>You also can file a complaint with the FTC. Write: Correspondence Branch Federal Trade Commission Washington, D.C. 
20580</p>
<p>Although the FTC cannot intervene in individual disputes, for enforcement purposes, it is interested in learning about home water 
treatment sales practices you believe to be deceptive.</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Income Tax Preparation Services -- March 1993</h2>
<p>This is the time of year when many Americans consider getting help from an income tax preparation service. These services, 
however, may vary greatly in accuracy and cost. The following information may help you decide whether you need a tax 
preparer and, if so, how to select the one that best suits your needs.</p>
<h4>Do You Need a Tax Preparer?</h4>
<p>Before you decide to hire a tax preparer, make sure you really need to pay for assistance. With help from a computer software 
package or the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), you may be able to do the work yourself. Your local IRS office will help you 
prepare an income tax form, or you can get answers to questions by using IRS free information resources. (See Free Resources, 
pg. 4). However, if you are unsure about how to do your taxes, or if your situation is too complex, you may find you want to 
consult a commercial tax preparer. The following information may help you comparison shop for a suitable one.</p>
<h4>Types Of Preparers</h4>
<p>Tax preparers differ greatly in education and training, so choose one carefully to ensure you pay only for the services you need.</p>
<p>An enrolled agent is certified by the IRS after having worked five years as an IRS auditor or after passing a government exam. 
Enrolled agents are authorized to represent you before the IRS.</p>
<p>A certified public accountant (CPA) has passed a professional qualifying exam. CPA's are also authorized to represent you 
before the IRS. A public accountant may have special accounting training, but lacks certification and cannot represent you before 
the IRS.</p>
<p>An attorney has passed the bar exam but may or may not have special tax training. Attorneys are authorized to represent you 
before the IRS.</p>
<p>Any other individual described as a &quot;tax preparer&quot; may or may not have special training or experience. Some tax preparation 
firms require that their staffs have extensive training and experience, while others have less rigorous requirements.</p>
<h4>Choosing A Preparer</h4>
<p>The more complex your tax situation, the more you may want the advice of someone with specialized experience. However, you 
may be charged more for the advice of these professionals. Many taxpayers, such as retired people, owners of small businesses, 
professionals, and people with large amounts of income from sources other than wages and tips, may especially benefit from 
using a preparer with specific experience in their area. To find the preparer that best suits your needs, call several and ask:</p>
<p>What is your training or experience in preparing tax returns, especially in a specialized area?</p>
<p>How do you check for accuracy? Will my return be reviewed for arithmetic errors only or also for errors in tax-law 
interpretation?</p>
<p>Approximately how much will you charge to prepare my taxes?</p>
<p>Can you file my return electronically?</p>
<p>Where can you be reached later in the year, if I need help with an audit?</p>
<p>Can you represent me if the IRS audits my return? What will you charge?</p>
<h4>What To Expect</h4>
<p>When you visit the preparer, expect certain practices. A preparer should go through a checklist of deductions to see if any apply 
to you. A preparer also should sign your return and enter his or her name and social security number (or federal identification 
number).</p>
<p>A preparer should not guarantee you a refund before completing your return or suggest that you take nonexistent deductions or 
propose other improprieties. A preparer should not ask you to sign a blank return or one completed in pencil.</p>
<h4>It's Up to You</h4>
<p>Even though you have hired someone to prepare your return, it is your responsibility to make sure your return is accurate. You 
are personally liable for any additional tax, interest, or penalty, even if you have a written guarantee that the preparer will pay any 
interest or penalty you are assessed as a result of his or her work. Here are some ways to help you get the best possible work 
done on your returns:</p>
<p>Before you visit the tax preparer, read your tax booklet or the more comprehensive IRS publication Your Federal Income Tax 
(publication #17). It is available free from the IRS Forms Distribution Center in your area.</p>
<p>Before you visit the tax preparer, make a list of any tax-related questions that occur to you and ask about them.</p>
<p>Gather and bring to the preparer any information or documents that might apply to your taxes, including your last year's return. 
Remember, too much information is better than too little.</p>
<p>After your return is prepared, check it to make sure the information is correct.</p>
<p>You will have an advantage if you get your taxes prepared early. Your tax preparer will have more time to do a thorough job for 
you.</p>
<h4>Free Resources</h4>
<p>You may be able to take advantage of free tax preparation services in your area. The IRS provides tax assistance by phone and 
through many free publications. For more details, contact the IRS office in your area. The IRS also runs a Volunteer Income Tax 
Assistance (VITA) Program, which is designed to help the elderly, persons with disabilities, the non-English speaking, and 
low-income citizens. The IRS also operates a program, Tax Counseling for the Elderly (TCE), which is designed to assist those 
individuals 60 years of age and older. Call your local IRS office at 1-800-829-1040 to ask about the VITA or TCE location 
nearest you.</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Invention Promotion Firms -- January 1994</h2>
<p>You may have a great idea for a new product or service, but a great idea is not enough. You need to know how to develop and 
market it commercially. You could try to sell your idea or invention to a manufacturer who would market it and pay you royalties. 
But finding such a company could be an overwhelming task. You also could consider using the services of an invention 
promotion firm.</p>
<p>Some invention promotion firms may help you get your idea or invention into the marketplace. But be aware, some inventors 
have paid thousands of dollars to firms that promised to evaluate, develop, patent, and market inventions and got nothing for their 
money.</p>
<p>So be cautious. Your enthusiasm for your idea may make you vulnerable to promoters who make false or exaggerated claims 
about the market potential of your invention.</p>
<p>This brochure tells you how to spot some common signs of trouble, how to protect yourself, and what to do if you become a 
victim. It also lists government agencies and private organizations that offer additional information and assistance.</p>
<h4>How to Identify Legitimate Firms</h4>
<p>Often, it is difficult to distinguish between a fraudulent invention promotion firm and a legitimate one. This may be because 
unscrupulous and honest firms often use many similar advertising and sales techniques, market evaluations, and contract 
strategies. However, there are some comparisons made in the next three sections that may help you identify legitimate 
companies.</p>
<h4>Advertising and Sales Techniques</h4>
<p>Some invention promotion firms advertise through television and radio, and classified ads in newspapers and magazines. They 
target independent inventors, frequently offering free information to help them patent and market inventions. They also may 
advertise a toll-free &quot;800&quot; telephone number that inventors can call for written information. However, the information may consist 
only of brochures about the promoter.</p>
<p>If you respond to the ads, you may hear from a salesperson who will ask for information about yourself, your idea, and a sketch 
of the invention. As an inducement, the firm may offer to do a free preliminary review of your invention.</p>
<p>Also, some invention promotion firms may claim to know or have special access to manufacturers who are likely to be interested 
in licensing your invention. Further, some promotion firms may claim to have been retained by manufacturers who are looking for 
new product ideas. These kinds of claims often can be false or exaggerated. Therefore, before signing a contract with an 
invention promotion firm who claims special relationships with appropriate manufacturers, ask for some proof.</p>
<h4>A Market Evaluation</h4>
<p>After giving your invention a preliminary review, a firm might tell you it needs to do a market evaluation on your idea, which may 
cost several hundred dollars. Such reports from questionable firms often make vague and general statements and provide no hard 
evidence that there is a consumer market for your invention. Reputable company reports, on the other hand, deal with specifics. 
Before you pay for a report on your idea, ask what specific information you will receive.</p>
<h4>A Marketing and Licensing Contract</h4>
<p>Some invention promotion firms also may offer you a contract where they agree to act as your exclusive marketing and licensing 
agent. For this, a questionable firm may require you to pay an upfront fee of as much as $10,000 and to commit a percentage of 
the royalties the invention may earn. On the other hand, reputable licensing agents typically do not rely principally on large upfront 
fees. They normally rely on royalties from the successful licensing of client inventions and are very selective about which ideas 
and inventions they pursue. A request for an upfront fee frequently is another distinguishing characteristic of a questionable 
invention promotion company.</p>
<h4>How to Protect Yourself</h4>
<p>If you are interested in working with an invention promotion firm, consider taking the following precautions before you sign a 
contract and pay significant amounts of money.</p>
<p>Early in your discussions with a promotion firm, ask what the total cost of its services will be. Consider it a warning if the 
salesperson hesitates to answer.</p>
<p>Be careful of an invention promotion firm that offers to review or evaluate your invention but refuses to disclose details 
concerning its criteria, system of review, and qualifications of company evaluators. Without this information, you cannot assess 
the competence of the firm or make meaningful comparisons with other firms. Reputable firms should provide you with an 
objective evaluation of the merit, technical feasibility, and commercial viability of your invention.</p>
<p>Require the firm to check on existing invention patents. Because unscrupulous firms are willing to promote virtually any idea or 
invention with no regard to its patentability, they may unwittingly promote an idea for which someone already has a valid, 
unexpired patent. This could mean that even if the promotional efforts on your invention are successful, you may find yourself the 
subject of a patent infringement lawsuit.</p>
<p>If no valid, unexpired patent exists for your idea, seek advice from a patent professional before authorizing the public disclosure 
of your idea.</p>
<p>Be wary of an invention promotion firm that will not disclose its success and rejection rates. Success rates show the number of 
clients who made more money from their invention than they paid to the firm. Rejection rates reflect the percentage of all ideas or 
inventions that were found unacceptable by the invention promotion company. Check with your state and local consumer 
protection officials to learn if invention promotion firms are required to disclose their success and rejection rates in your locality.</p>
<p>In reality, few inventions make it to the marketplace and still fewer become commercial successes. According to experts used in 
FTC cases, an invention promotion firm that does not reject most of the inventions it reviews may be unduly optimistic, if not 
dishonest, in its evaluations.</p>
<p>Be wary of a firm that claims to have special access to manufacturers looking for new products, but refuses to document such 
claims. Legitimate invention promotion firms substantiate their claims, which you can check.</p>
<p>Be skeptical of claims and assurances that your invention will make money. No one can guarantee your invention's success.</p>
<p>Avoid being taken in solely on a firm's promotional brochures and affiliations with impressive-sounding organizations.</p>
<p>Beware of high-pressure sales tactics.</p>
<p>Investigate the company before making any commitments. Call your Better Business Bureau, local consumer protection agency, 
and Attorney General in your state and the state in which the company is located to learn if they know of any unresolved 
consumer complaints about the firm.</p>
<p>Make sure your contract contains all agreed upon terms, written and verbal, before you sign. If possible, have the agreement 
reviewed by an attorney.</p>
<p>If you do not get satisfactory answers to all of your questions with an invention promotion firm, consider whether you want to 
sign a contract. Once a dishonest company has your money, it is unlikely you will ever get it back.</p>
<h4>For More Information</h4>
<p>A number of government agencies and private organizations offer publications and assistance to independent inventors. You can 
call the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office at (703) 557-4636 and the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) at 
1-(800)-827-5722 for publications about inventions.</p>
<p>You also may want to call your SBA district office to learn about services available through the Small Business Development 
Centers program.</p>
<p>Inventor's clubs, associations, and innovation centers also can be valuable sources of information and services. For their locations 
contact the following organizations:</p>
<p>United Inventors Association of the United States of America (UIA-USA) P.O. Box 50305 St. Louis, Missouri 63105 
(stamped, self-addressed envelope required)</p>
<p>National Congress of Inventor Organizations (NCIO) 727 North 600 West Logan, Utah 84321 (801) 753-0888</p>
<p>Minnesota Inventors Congress P.O. Box 71 Redwood Falls, Minnesota 56283-0071 (507) 637-2344</p>
<h4>What to Do If You Are a Victim</h4>
<p>If you believe you are a victim of a fraudulent invention promotion, first contact the firm and try to get your money back.</p>
<p>If you are unsuccessful, report your problem to your Better Business Bureau, local consumer protection agency, and the 
Attorney General in your state and in the state where the company is located. Your information may help an ongoing investigation 
or demonstrate the need for one.</p>
<p>You also may file a complaint with the FTC by writing: Correspondence Branch, Federal Trade Commission, Washington, D.C. 
20580. The FTC generally does not intervene in individual disputes. However, the information you provide may indicate a 
pattern of possible law violations.</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumer from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Land Sales Scams -- November 1992</h2>
<p>Although buying land may seem like a safe investment, it sometimes can be highly speculative and risky. Many consumers have 
complained to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) that land they bought more than 20 years ago still is not worth the original 
selling price. In all that time, they have had to pay property taxes and, in some cases, association dues on land that remains 
vacant and undeveloped. More important, there is little, if any, resale market for the land.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, land sales scams continue even today. In some instances, the FTC has found that sellers overprice land as much 
as 400 percent.</p>
<p>This brochure describes land sales scams and tells you how to avoid them. It explains what protection you have under the 
Interstate Land Sales Full Disclosure Act, which is administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), 
and offers tips on selecting a lot.</p>
<h4>The Hard Sell</h4>
<p>Be wary of sellers who offer land primarily as a great investment opportunity. They may show you slick brochures and videos 
that promise &quot;nearby&quot; beaches or lakes, and locations &quot;convenient&quot; to tourist attractions, shopping malls, schools, and hospitals. 
Some sellers spin a tale of paradise, show you model homes, and all but &quot;guarantee&quot; that the land's value will increase rapidly. 
Prices will rise, they may claim, because a large number of planned housing communities and businesses will be moving to the 
area soon. As an incentive to visit the land site and attend a sales presentation, sellers may offer special discounts on lodging, 
meals, golf, or airfare.</p>
<h4>The Full Disclosure Act</h4>
<p>To help protect consumers against land sales scams, the Interstate Land Sales Full Disclosure Act was passed in 1968. This Act 
generally applies to developers selling or leasing--through interstate commerce--100 or more unimproved lots. Under the Act, 
developers must register their subdivisions with HUD. They also must give consumers a summary of that registration in a 
disclosure statement called a Property Report before a contract or agreement is signed.</p>
<p>The Report contains information about the property, such as distances to nearby communities over paved or unpaved roads; 
present and proposed utility services and charges; and soil and foundation conditions which could cause construction or septic 
tank problems. Read the Report carefully; it is meant to provide basic information about the property. However, the Federal 
Government does not inspect lots or prepare or verify the contents of the Property Report, so you may wish to question some of 
the information.</p>
<p>HUD has two publications, &quot;Buying Lots from Developers&quot; and &quot;Before Buying Land...Get the Facts,&quot; which discuss the Full 
Disclosure Act, the Property Report, and more. For free copies, write to HUD at the address on page 5. You also can write to 
HUD to find out if a seller is subject to the Full Disclosure Act.</p>
<h4>The Shopping Process</h4>
<p>Whether you are looking for an immediate home site or vacation/retirement land, know what you are buying before committing 
yourself to making a downpayment and years of monthly payments. Here is a checklist that may help you answer some important 
questions: how much is the property worth now; what could you resell it for in an emergency; and how much might the property 
appreciate over the next five to ten years?</p>
<p>Inspect the property. Do not buy &quot;site unseen.&quot; If possible, talk to people who live in the development and ask if they are 
satisfied. Also ask the subdivision's owners' association about the status of development in the subdivision.</p>
<p>Talk to local real estate agents to learn more about area land values and the resale market. You also can scan the classified ads 
of local newspapers to compare prices of similar properties. To find out about property appraisals and sales prices of area lots, 
check with the tax assessment and county recorder offices. Visit the county planning office to learn about future residential and 
commercial developments that may affect land values.</p>
<p>Contact the appropriate state or local offices to find out who is required to develop and maintain roads and put in utilities for 
water, electricity, and sewerage, if the land is undeveloped. Ask if there are any zoning regulations or environmental land-use 
restrictions that prohibit building on the property or make it costly.</p>
<p>Contact HUD, your local or state consumer protection office, Chamber of Commerce, or Better Business Bureau to find out if 
they have any information about the developer or sales agent. They may be able to tell you the number and kind of complaints 
that have been filed.</p>
<p>Consider the annual cost of property taxes and any assessment fees that may be required by the owners' association. Keep in 
mind, these probably will rise.</p>
<p>Check the clerk's office at the local court house to learn of any civil actions that have been brought by or against the seller or 
developer.</p>
<p>Check with HUD to determine whether the property is registered. Carefully read the con- tract and any disclosure documents, 
such as the Property Report, before making a commitment. You also may want a financial advisor or an attorney to review the 
documents.</p>
<h4>Cancellation Rights</h4>
<p>Ask about your cancellation rights before you sign a contract. If the lot is subject to the Full Disclosure Act, the contract should 
specify a &quot;cooling-off&quot; period of 7 days (or longer if allowed by state law). During this time, you may cancel the contract for any 
reason by contacting the developer, preferably in writing. Also, if the contract does not state that you will receive a warranty 
deed within 180 days after signing the contract, you may have up to two years to cancel.</p>
<p>If the land is not covered by the Full Disclosure Act, check the cancellation clause in the contract. In some contracts, the buyer 
has only three days to cancel the transaction.</p>
<p>Along with your contract, keep copies of promotional materials you received at the sales presentation, as well as any newspaper 
articles about the development. These materials would be important should you try to cancel your contract because of 
misrepresentations made at the time of purchase.</p>
<h4>A Special Alert For New Immigrants</h4>
<p>New immigrants who have difficulty understanding English may be the target of another kind of deceptive land-sales tactic. The 
new immigrant is paired with a salesperson of the same nationality, and the sales pitch is delivered in the immigrant's native 
tongue. When it is time to close the deal, however, the sales documents are written in English, which the buyer may find difficult 
to read and understand. Also, the sales documents may not include all the salesperson's oral promises.</p>
<p>Under the Full Disclosure Act, the seller must provide the buyer with sales documents and a Property Report in the same 
language as the sales presentation, or attach a translation to the documents. Failure to do so could void the contract.</p>
<h4>Complaint Handling</h4>
<p>If certain amenities, such as a swimming pool or tennis courts, are not being built as promised, or you believe false 
representations were made about the land, complain immediately in writing to the seller. If that does not solve the problem, write 
to your local or state consumer protection office. If the developer is not fulfilling the terms of your sales contract, you may want 
to ask an attorney to advise you of your rights. To determine whether you have any rights under the Full Disclosure Act, send 
details about your complaint to the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Interstate Land Sales Registration Division, 
451 - 7th Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20410. Include the name of the developer, name and location of the subdivision, and 
copies of the contract or any other documents you signed.</p>
<p>You also can file a complaint with the FTC. Write: Correspondence Branch, Federal Trade Commission, Washington, D.C. 
20580. Although the FTC usually does not handle individual cases, the information you provide may indicate a pattern of 
possible law violations requiring action by the Commission.</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Lawn Service Contracts -- January 1993</h2>
<p>Growing a green lawn takes time and energy. These days, some people prefer hiring lawn care services to take over a large part 
of the effort.</p>
<p>Lawn care services perform some of the time-consuming and complicated tasks of lawn maintenance. These may include 
analyzing, fertilizing, and seeding the soil; controlling and killing weeds and pests; and caring for trees and shrubs. These services 
may be provided an average of four to five times during the spring through fall. You also may want these firms to regularly mow 
and water your lawn.</p>
<p>Sometimes, in order to hire these companies, you must sign expensive and long-term contracts. It is important, therefore, to 
know exactly what you want from a lawn care firm. The following information may help you decide whether to hire a lawn care 
service and, if so, how to find the one right for you.</p>
<h4>How Do You Choose a Lawn Care Service?</h4>
<p>If you decide you want to hire a lawn care service, you may want to consider the following suggestions.</p>
<p>Talk with others in your neighborhood who have used lawn care services. Find out which companies have done a good job and 
why.</p>
<p>Talk with representatives from several lawn care firms and get estimates. The lowest estimate may not necessarily provide all the 
services you need.</p>
<p>Remember that each lawn is different and that your lawn does not necessarily need the same treatment as your neighbor's. Some 
companies may offer a free lawn analysis. Make sure you are getting &quot;custom&quot; service.</p>
<p>Even the best lawns have weeds and pests. Ask to see evidence of specific and real problems before you agree to any treatment.</p>
<p>Check to see if the company is licensed by your state. Licensing often requires employees to have special training, especially 
those who apply pesticides to lawns. Ask what specific lawn care training the employees have.</p>
<p>Check with your local consumer affairs office or Better Business Bureau to see if any complaints have been lodged against the 
company.</p>
<p>Find out if the company has liability insurance to cover any accidents that might happen while work is being performed in your 
yard or while pesticides are being applied.</p>
<p>Ask if the company belongs to a professional pest control association. This membership may help keep members better trained 
and informed.</p>
<h4>What Should You Look for in Your Contract?</h4>
<p>If you select a lawn care service, you should put all your agreements with the company into a written contract. You may want to 
keep the following information in mind before you sign any contract.</p>
<p>Read your contract carefully. Know what specific services and lawn problems are covered and what are not.</p>
<p>See if there are extra charges for special services, such as fertilizing, disease control, or reseeding.</p>
<p>Find out if the work is guaranteed. If it is, get the guarantee (or warranty) in writing. Know what the guarantee includes and 
excludes, and how long it lasts. For example, if you believe a seeding job produced little improvement, will the company come 
back and reseed for free during the same growing season?</p>
<p>Know how long the services will be performed. Must you renew annually or is service scheduled indefinitely? What are the costs 
of renewal and how much might they increase? Many lawn care service contracts require written notice to cancel. Find out how 
you can cancel the contract you are considering.</p>
<h4>If Pesticide Treatment is Offered, What Should You Look For?</h4>
<p>Lawn care companies often provide pest, disease, and weed control services. This usually means the company will use a 
pesticide on your lawn.</p>
<p>Pesticides are toxic chemicals used to destroy different kinds of lawn pests. For example, insecticides are used to kill bugs; 
herbicides kill weeds.</p>
<p>Lawn care companies generally maintain that the kind and strength of the pesticides they use are safe. Some organizations, 
however, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), have some health and safety concerns. Before you agree 
to pesticide treatment for your lawn, you may want to consider the following information.</p>
<p>Although pesticides can kill unwanted weeds and bugs, the treatment also may destroy the organisms that create a healthy soil for 
your lawn. Some people feel that a lawn that is overtreated will become dependent on chemicals to thrive.</p>
<p>If pesticides are going to be used on your lawn, find out what specific lawn problems are being addressed.</p>
<p>Get the name of the pesticide in writing. Ask to see the EPA label and read it carefully before any pesticide is applied to your 
lawn.</p>
<p>Find out about the harmful characteristics of the pesticide, especially to those most vulnerable to its effects: young children, 
pregnant women, older people, and household pets.</p>
<p>Inquire about the availability of less harmful compounds.</p>
<p>Inquire carefully about the training of anyone who applies the pesticide to your lawn.</p>
<p>Ask what kind of posting will be done to notify people in your neighborhood that pesticides are being applied to your lawn. A 
number of jurisdictions now require this notice. If your city or county does not require the notice, you still may want to let 
neighbors know to protect them from any problems that might arise from the pesticide application.</p>
<p>Find out what you need to do during the pesticide treatment and for how long. Should you stay indoors, keep your windows 
closed, bring in your outdoor lawn furniture and children's toys?</p>
<p>How long should you stay off treated areas?</p>
<p>Make sure pesticides are not applied in windy weather (over 10 miles an hour). This will prevent their spreading to other lawns.</p>
<p>Ask for alternatives to pesticide applications. Many companies now offer a more &quot;organic&quot; and less chemical approach to lawn 
care.</p>
<p>Ask about ecological effects, including danger to non-target species and the possibility of groundwater contamination. What Are 
Alternatives to Pesticide Controls? Good-looking lawns may take a year or more of care to get that way. Although you may 
choose to use chemical applications to quickly improve the appearance of your lawn, you also may want to consider longer-term 
approaches to lawn care that do not include pesticides.</p>
<p>One such approach is called &quot;integrated pest management.&quot; Basically, this involves planting several kinds of disease resistant 
grasses, properly conditioning your soil, and using new low-toxicity pest control materials.</p>
<h4>For More Information</h4>
<p>For more information about integrated pest management, you may want to contact your local county extension agency. For more 
information about specific lawn care companies in your area, contact your local consumer protection agency or Better Business 
Bureau.</p>
<p>If you need information beyond that given on a pesticide label, you can call the National Pesticide Telecommunications Network 
at 1-800-858-7378. If you have problems with the pesticide application of a lawn care company, contact your state or county 
environmental protection agency. To report contract or guarantee (warranty) problems with a lawn service company, write: 
Correspondence Branch, Federal Trade Commission, Washington, D.C. 20580. Although the FTC does not generally intervene 
in individual disputes, the information you provide may indicate a pattern of possible law violations requiring action by the 
Commission.</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Infomercials -- November 1992</h2>
<p>What looks like a TV show and sounds like a TV show -- but isn't? It's probably a new type of advertisement called an 
infomercial.</p>
<p>Seen increasingly on cable and independent television stations, many of these commercials have the look, feel, and duration of 
real TV programs, often imitating the format of genuine talk shows or investigative consumer news programs. The product being 
sold is often discussed as part of the program and touted by paid &quot;experts,&quot; &quot;moderators,&quot; or &quot;reporters.&quot; These &quot;shows&quot; may last 
15 minutes or longer and may even be interrupted by realistic-looking &quot;advertisements&quot; for the product with ordering information. 
Consumers may find it difficult to tell the difference between an infomercial and an independent TV program, where the content 
of the show and the advertisements are separately developed and paid for.</p>
<p>As part of its job monitoring national advertising, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) investigates infomercials that do not 
disclose their true advertising nature. The FTC has charged a company with misrepresenting that it was a TV consumer news 
program.</p>
<h4>How to Spot an Infomercial</h4>
<p>There is nothing illegal about advertisers paying for infomercials to sell products. But, it is important to remember that product 
claims made on such programs are those of the advertiser. They are not an objective or independent evaluation of the product. 
Here are some tips on how to spot a paid advertisement.</p>
<p>Look for commercials similar to the program content. Infomercials promote products or services in &quot;commercial breaks&quot; that 
relate to issues discussed on the rest of the show. For example, a &quot;program&quot; about credit problems may discuss services that 
promise to repair a consumer's low credit rating or a program about sunglasses may sell sunglasses. Ordering information, such 
as a toll-free number or a mail address, usually is shown during the &quot;program.&quot; Sometimes this is done as a &quot;program&quot; 
interruption. As a general rule, you should assume that any &quot;program&quot; which provides ordering information for a specific product 
or contains commercial interruptions to promote products related to the &quot;program's&quot; content is a paid advertisement.</p>
<p>Check for sponsor identification. The Federal Communications Commission requires television stations to disclose who is paying 
for an infomercial -- at the beginning or end of the show. Look for that identification to determine whether the program's sponsor 
has a financial interest in the products discussed.</p>
<p>Know that many infomercials advertise health or financial products. Health and financial products are two big areas where some 
advertisers feel consumers may spend their dollars for promising, but sometimes less than tried and true, products and services. 
So, infomercials devoted to weight loss, skin care, &quot;get rich quick,&quot; and similar schemes are popular with sponsors. These ads 
often promise great results with little effort or risk.</p>
<p>Be wary of programs where one product is selected as being better than others. Many legitimate television shows discuss and 
evaluate products and services. Sometimes, however, this format is used in infomercials that simulate the appearance of impartial 
evaluations of advertised items. For example, a &quot;talk show&quot; moderator may ask for an &quot;expert&quot; opinion or celebrity testimonials, 
or the advertised product may be selected as the &quot;best&quot; during an &quot;investigative&quot; segment. All of these techniques are just part of 
an overall sales pitch. If the product is treated in this manner and the show provides information about how to order it, you 
probably are watching a paid advertisement.</p>
<h4>How to Protect Yourself If You Buy Something</h4>
<p>If you decide to purchase a product advertised on an infomercial, you have certain protections under the law if you make your 
purchase by credit card or if you make your order or payment by mail.</p>
<h4>Charging by Credit Card: Disputing Errors</h4>
<p>If you charge an item on a credit card by either telephone or mail, the Fair Credit Billing Act may offer you some added 
protection. For example, if you disagree with a charge on your monthly credit card bill (such as a wrong amount), send the credit 
card issuer a letter right away using the special &quot;billing error address&quot; given on your monthly statement or credit card contract. 
Include your name and account number; the date, type, and dollar amount of the charge you question; and why you think there 
was a mistake. The credit card company must respond to your letter -- either correcting the mistake or explaining why the bill is 
believed to be correct.</p>
<h4>Charging by Credit Card: Disputing Quality</h4>
<p>If you purchase a product with a credit card and later have problems with the quality of the item, the Fair Credit Billing Act 
allows you to withhold payment of the disputed amount from the credit card issuer. First, however, you must make a good faith 
effort to resolve the matter with the seller. In most cases, you must have bought the item in your home state or within 100 miles of 
your current billing address, and the amount charged must be more than $50. Unfortunately, this may not be the case with most 
sales from infomercials.</p>
<h4>Ordering or Paying by Mail</h4>
<p>If you use the mail, rather than the telephone, to order or pay for a product, you have rights under the Mail Order Rule. 
Companies must ship your order within the time promised. If no time period is stated, the company must ship your order within 
30 days after receiving it. If there is a delay, the company must send you a notice, giving you the option of agreeing to the delay 
or canceling the order and getting a refund.</p>
<h4>For More Information</h4>
<p>If you have further questions about this issue or feel that an infomercial you have seen has not been properly identified, write to: 
Correspondence Branch, Federal Trade Commission, Washington, D.C. 20580. The information you provide may indicate a 
pattern of possible law violations requiring action by the Commission. For single free copies of the FTC brochures, Shopping by 
Phone and Mail and Fair Credit Billing, write: Public Reference, Federal Trade Commission, Washington, D.C. 20580.</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Layaway Purchase Plans -- November 1992</h2>
<p>Layaway purchase plans are designed for customers who want to buy merchandise without credit or paying the full price 
immediately. Layaway plans frequently are offered by discount department stores, or stores that specialize in stereo equipment, 
appliances, jewelry, or clothing.</p>
<h4>How Do Layaways Work?</h4>
<p>Layaways are different from credit purchases. When you buy on credit, you take the merchandise before you pay. When you 
use a layaway plan, you pay in full through installments before getting the merchandise.</p>
<p>The terms of layaway plans vary from store to store. With the usual plan, you make a deposit, usually a percentage of the 
purchase price, and pay over a period of time until you have paid for the item in full. In exchange, the retailer agrees to hold your 
selection during that time.</p>
<h4>How Can You Avoid Layaway Problems?</h4>
<p>To avoid any misunderstandings, get specific information about a store's layaway terms before you participate in its layaway 
program. Ask the sales clerk for a written description of the store's layaway plan or, if that is not available, get information 
concerning the important layaway matters discussed below. If any of the store's conditions are not acceptable to you, you may 
want to shop elsewhere for layaway merchandise.</p>
<p>Terms of the Layaway Plan. It is important to know how much time you will have to pay for the item; when the payments are 
due; what minimum payment is required; and what charges, if any, are added to the purchase price. For example, the seller may 
charge a service or layaway fee. Also, find out if there is a penalty for late payments, such as a charge, or possibly loss of the 
layaway merchandise.</p>
<p>Refund Policy. If you decide that you do not want the merchandise after making some or all of the payments, you may expect a 
refund. But, retailers' policies may differ about this. Some may give you all of your money back, but others may charge you a 
layaway service fee that is not refundable. Some retailers may only give you a credit to apply to a future purchase made in their 
store. Ask about the store's refund policy before you buy, and, if possible, get it in writing.</p>
<p>Location, Availability, and Identification of Layaway Merchandise. Stores often carry two types of merchandise -- items that are 
available for immediate sale and items on display that will be ordered upon request. If you are buying an item the store keeps in 
stock, ask if it will be physically set apart from the other merchandise when you begin payments. For example, some stores may 
have a separate area or section of their stockroom where they store merchandise being purchased on layaway. If the item you 
want must be ordered, ask the sales clerk if the item will be ordered in advance so it will be available to you when you make 
your final payment. This is especially important when you are ordering merchandise needed by a particular date.To ensure that 
you receive the exact item you are purchasing, ask the clerk to identify the merchandise in writing. For example, the merchandise 
could be described as -- &quot;One (1) blue 2-piece suit, Size 10, XYZ Manufacturer, Style No. 123.&quot; Many stores have a space on 
their sales receipt to identify the layaway merchandise.</p>
<h4>What Else Can You Do?</h4>
<p>Remember, until you finish paying for the layaway item, the retailer has your money and the merchandise. If the store goes 
bankrupt while you are still paying, your money and the merchandise may be lost. To help avoid this, and to find out if there are 
any complaints against the store, check the store's reputation with your local Better Business Bureau or consumer protection 
agency before you buy merchandise on layaway. In addition, if you have not shopped in that store before, you might start out by 
purchasing a relatively inexpensive item on its layaway plan.</p>
<p>Also, to avoid any confusion, keep good records of the payments you make on the layaway merchandise. Then, when each 
installment is due, you will have a reminder of the payments made. These records may be useful later, if you have any disputes 
with the store.</p>
<h4>What Laws Protect You?</h4>
<p>There is no federal law that specifically governs layaway plans. The Federal Trade Commission Act, however, makes illegal 
unfair or deceptive sales practices in or affecting commerce. There also may be state or local laws that cover layaway purchases 
in your area. To find out about appropriate state or local laws, check with your state or local consumer protection agency and 
your local Better Business Bureau.</p>
<p>To inquire about possible violation of the Federal Trade Commission Act, write to: Correspondence Branch, Federal Trade 
Commission, Washington, D.C. 20580. While the FTC cannot resolve individual disputes, the information you provide may 
indicate a pattern of practices requiring action by the Commission.</p>

<h2>PRIVACY RIGHTS CLEARINGHOUSE</h2>
<h3>A program of the Center for Public Interest Law University of San Diego School of Law</h3>
<h4>The Privacy Debate</h4>
<p>Privacy has been hailed a major consumer issue of the 1990s. Four out of five respondents to a 1993 Louis Harris poll 
expressed concern about threats to their personal privacy.</p>
<p>Advances in technology are at the heart of the privacy issue. They present consumers with a double-edged sword, offering 
exciting new services while at the same time posing serious threats to personal privacy.</p>
<h4>Educating Consumers</h4>
<p>The Privacy Rights Clearinghouse offers consumers a unique opportunity to learn how to protect their personal privacy. The 
Clearinghouse provides a toll-free hotline for Californians who seek information about technology-related privacy issues. It is the 
first endeavor of its kind in the nation.</p>
<p>The Clearinghouse is administered by the University of San Diego's Center for Public Interest Law. It is funded by the 
Telecommunications Education Trust, a program of the California Public Utilities Commission. It has been in operation since July 
1992.</p>
<h4>Clearinghouse Services</h4>
<p>A toll-free hotline for California consumers to report privacy abuses and request information on ways to protect their privacy. 
Assistance is available in English and Spanish. Since it was launched in October 1992, the hotline has received calls from 17,000 
consumers.</p>
<p>A series of free fact sheets on privacy issues, available in English and Spanish.</p>
<p>Online computer access via Internet and direct modem connection. Online services include the texts of all fact sheets, in English 
and Spanish, updates on state and federal privacy legislation, as well as other information.</p>
<p>Publication of an annual report that analyzes the data gathered by the project. The report is widely distributed to federal and state 
policymakers and consumer advocates.</p>
<h4>Purposes of the Clearinghouse</h4>
<p>Raise consumers' awareness of how technology affects personal privacy.</p>
<p>Empower consumers to take action to control their own personal information by providing practical tips on privacy protection.</p>
<p>Respond to specific privacy-related complaints from consumers and, when appropriate, refer them to the proper organizations 
for further assistance.</p>
<p>Documents the nature of Californians' concerns about privacy in regular reports and make them available to policymakers, 
industry representatives and consumer advocates.</p>

<h2>PROTECTING YOUR PRIVACY</h2>
<p>One in a series published by the ConsumerCard Information Service of the Consumer Affairs Office, American Express 
Company, in cooperation with the United States Office of Consumer Affairs. Copies may be reproduced for nonprofit 
educational use.</p>
<h4>Keep it handy...</h4>
<p>It can help you preserve your privacy as new technology expands existing capabilities to collect, store, and move information. </p>
<h4>Safeguarding your privacy</h4>
<p>The decade of the '90s will be marked by giant leaps in the ability to collect, store, and move information almost instantaneously 
around the world. Many businesses are use technology to improve customer service and to help target direct mail offers to those 
most likely to respond. New systems also speed up processing time for orders and help control the costs of doing business.</p>
<p>The expanded capability to collect, store, and use data about our personal, financial, and medical histories concerns some 
consumers who wonder how such information is protected and who has access to it. There are many ways you can help to 
protect your privacy.</p>
<h4>Credit records</h4>
<p>Credit bureaus compile records of individual consumers' credit habits to assist lenders, employers, and other businesses (such as 
retail stores and utilities) in assessing applicants' creditworthiness. You should check your credit bureau records periodically:</p>
<p>* Get a copy of your credit report and check for inaccuracies. Credit records are usually maintained by credit bureaus which 
normally operate on one of three national reporting systems: Equifax, Trans Union, and TRW. Checking for inaccuracies will 
enable you to correct mistakes before you apply for a job, credit, or insurance. Bureau systems charge a fee for a copy of your 
report. The law requires, if you have been denied credit within the last 30 days, the report is free from the bureau that supplied 
the report to the creditor.</p>
<p>* If you find inaccuracies, write the credit bureau and explain the error(s). The bureau is required to re-verify the information 
within a reasonable time or remove it from your file. You may wish to review information held by the other major credit bureaus 
as well.</p>
<p>* If there is negative information that must remain in your file, you can tell your side of the story. Send the bureau a brief letter of 
explanation which must be kept in your file. Negative information is kept for seven years; bankruptcy information, for ten.</p>
<h4>Medical records</h4>
<p>The Medical Information Bureau (MIB) is a data bank used by 750 insurance companies. Medical and some non-medical 
information about you is collected from insurers and, with your authorization, shared when you apply for individual life, health, or 
disability insurance. MIB may have a brief coded report on applicants who have significant underwriting risks. The MIB helps 
insurers guard against fraud, as the cost of fraud is passed on to consumers through higher premiums.</p>
<p>* You may obtain a translation of your MIB report free by writing to MIB.</p>
<p>* To verify its accuracy and completeness, discuss your MIB report and other medical records periodically with your doctor.</p>
<h4>Incentive programs</h4>
<p>Some retailers offer rebate, incentive, and warranty programs that benefit consumers. Ask who has access to information you 
provide to participate in these programs. Some companies use this data to create mailing lists that are sold to marketers. Many 
consumers find receiving such offers a benefit; others do not.</p>
<p>* Rebate and incentive program applications ask for your name, address, and phone number. Ask whether you can participate 
without providing additional, personal information.</p>
<p>* It is in your interest to return warranty cards to manufacturers so they can notify you about product warnings and recalls. You 
may leave blank those questions you feel are unnecessary for this purpose, and request in writing to opt out of marketing 
programs based on the type of personal information you provide.</p>
<h4>Telecommunications</h4>
<p>&quot;Caller ID&quot; is a service offered by telephone companies in a number of states. Subscribing to Caller ID allows you to see the 
number from which incoming calls are placed before you pick up the telephone.</p>
<p>* If you don't recognize a number, you have the choice of answering or not.</p>
<p>* If you choose not to answer, you can use an answering machine or service to avoid missing important calls from unfamiliar 
numbers.</p>
<p>* If you don't want your number revealed to those who have Caller ID, see whether your local telephone company offers 
blocking mechanisms to prevent it from being displayed. You also could call from a pay phone, or ask an operator to place the 
call and not reveal your number.</p>
<p>Companies with 800 and 900 numbers can use a similar number identification technology to record your telephone number when 
you call. Some firms use your number to help retrieve your records faster and improve the quality and speed of handling your 
call. Be aware when you call that firms may also match your number to your name and address to add to customer lists created 
for marketing or service purposes.</p>
<p>Cellular and cordless phone conversations are easily monitored. You may choose to avoid conducting confidential conversations 
on these phones.</p>
<h4>Direct Marketing</h4>
<p>Many companies use direct mail and telemarketing to reach consumers. If you do not wish to be solicited, some companies let 
you opt out of these programs.</p>
<p>* To reduce the number of direct mail or telephone solicitations you receive, write to the companies that are contacting you and 
ask to be removed from their lists. Also, watch for special billing inserts provided by some companies which let you exclude your 
name from their lists.</p>
<p>* Contact the Mail Preference Service and the Telephone Preference Service of the Direct Marketing Association (DMA). Your 
name can be removed from (or added to) the lists of DMA members who participate in these programs. You will still get some 
mail and calls, but this will help reduce the volume.</p>
<p>To control what information about you is kept, say &quot;no&quot; to telemarketers who want more information than you feel is necessary, 
and to those who refuse to send follow-up explanatory materials.</p>
<h4>Identification</h4>
<p>* Do not write your telephone number on credit or charge card purchase slips. Major credit and charge card providers do not 
require a telephone number for identification. (Where the merchant has no electronic or telephone connection with the card 
company to verify your account at the time of purchase, you may still be asked to provide a telephone number, however.)</p>
<p>* To avoid a common source of fraud, do not allow your credit or charge card account number to be written on your personal 
check-particularly if your driver's license number is being recorded as well.</p>
<p>* Some states forbid merchants to record credit or charge card account numbers. Merchants are permitted to simply note 
whether you have a major credit or charge card as an indicator of your creditworthiness. Exceptions are services like 
&quot;emergency check cashing,&quot; where you have preapproved the use of your card to guarantee your check. Be forewarned, 
however; merchants may still refuse to accept your check it you refuse to allow them to record your card number.</p>
<h4>Sources of information and help...</h4>
<p>You may wish to consult the consumer affairs office of the company involved, the Better Business Bureau, or your local or state 
consumer protection agency; or call or write any of the organizations listed below.</p>
<h4>To get a copy of your credit report: </h4>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Prize Offers -- April 1992</h2>
<p>Produced in cooperation with Call For Action, Inc., a Washington, D.C.-based international network of radio and television 
consumer hotlines.</p>
<p>Congratulations -- It's your lucky day! You have won one of the following fabulous prizes: a diamond pendant; a deluxe vacation 
for two; a food processor; a stereo system; or a six-foot grandfather clock.</p>
<p>If you receive a letter like this, you should be skeptical about the value of your &quot;fabulous&quot; winnings. The prize you win may not be 
worth the effort to collect it.</p>
<p>What could be wrong with these prizes? You need to see them to understand. The diamond is probably the size of a pin-head. 
The vacation for two might only be a certificate for inexpensive lodging, which might include so many restrictions as to be 
worthless. The food processor might be more accurately described as a hand-operated food chopper. The stereo system might 
be a plastic toy that fits in your hand; and the clock may turn out to be made of cardboard or plastic.</p>
<p>These deceptively-described prizes are sometimes used as an inducement to attract customers to sales meetings for land or for 
vacation &quot;timesharing&quot; (the use of a vacation home for a limited, pre-planned time). Other times, the promoter may be selling 
products like a year's supply of vitamins or a water purifier, and using the &quot;prizes&quot; as a way to encourage consumers to call the 
number listed on the postcard or letter.</p>
<p>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and local consumer protection officials have been receiving a growing number of 
complaints about promotions that use deceptively-advertised prizes. Many of these complaints concern the deceptive way in 
which the postcard, and then the telemarketers, described the awards. Other consumers are disappointed with the inferior quality 
and usefulness of the product they were required to buy in order to receive their &quot;award,&quot; claiming it cost far more than a similar 
product bought at a local department store. Many consumers also are upset about the high-pressure sales tactics used during the 
sales presentations.</p>
<p>The next time you get a computerized &quot;personal&quot; letter telling you it is &quot;your lucky day,&quot; keep these points in mind:</p>
<p>Do not be deceived by letters that look official or urgent. Some contest promoters use names that resemble official organizations, 
such as the lottery or a parcel delivery service, or use an envelope that looks like it contains a telegram or government check.</p>
<p>Read the letter carefully. In some cases, the letter may tell you the cash value of each prize or that you must attend a sales 
seminar as part of the contest. The fine print may be especially informative.</p>
<p>Think carefully before you attend the sales meeting for the sole purpose of winning an expensive prize. Your chances of winning a 
truly valuable prize are likely to be very slim. You also may be required to pay a handling charge that is equivalent to the value of 
your prize. Ask about any such charges before you attend any presentation or pay a charge.</p>
<p>Be cautious of contest promoters who use &quot;900&quot; numbers. You may call a free &quot;800&quot; number which then directs you to dial a 
&quot;900&quot; number. You pay for &quot;900&quot; number calls, of course, and the charges may be high.</p>
<p>Think carefully before sending a check to contest promotion companies. If a company urges you to use delivery systems other 
than the U.S. Postal Service, such as overnight or courier services, the company may be trying to avoid detection and 
prosecution by postal authorities.</p>
<p>Be cautious about disclosing your credit card number over the phone unless you know you are dealing with a reputable 
company.</p>
<p>Call your state or local consumer protection office to inquire about the seller's reputation. Be wary of offers that claim to be for a 
&quot;limited time&quot; only and efforts to make you &quot;buy on the spot.&quot; Although some state laws provide cancellation periods under 
certain circumstances, you should not count on being able to cancel and get your money back unless your right to do so is clearly 
spelled out in your contract.</p>
<p>Before signing any contract, make sure you read it carefully. If the salesperson makes claims that are not in the contract, 
remember it is the contract that counts.</p>
<h4>If You Have A Complaint</h4>
<p>Always try to resolve complaints with the company first. If that does not work and you believe you have been defrauded, contact 
your local consumer protection agency, state Attorney General, Better Business Bureau, and Call For Action (202/537-0585; 
TDD 202/537-1551) to report the company.</p>
<p>You also may file a complaint with the FTC by writing to: Correspondence Branch, Federal Trade Commission, Washington, 
D.C. 20580. Although the FTC generally does not intervene in individual disputes, the information you provide may help to 
indicate a pattern of possible law violations requiring action by the Commission.</p>
<h4>For More Information</h4>
<p>The FTC has a series of Facts for Consumers that explain fraudulent sales practices, precautions you can take to avoid 
becoming a victim, and your rights under federal credit protection laws. These and other brochures are listed in the FTC's Best 
Sellers for Consumers. To obtain a free copy, write to: Public Reference, Federal Trade Commission, Washington, D.C. 20580.</p>

<h4>Introduction:</h4>
<p>&quot;There's No Place Like Home&quot;</p>
<p>The cottage industry, an old- fashioned enterprise, is enjoying a revival so strong that it's difficult to find out just how many 
Americans are now working at home. Estimates range from two to five million and the numbers may double by 1990.</p>
<p>Because women now enter business at a rate five times faster than men, the trend of operating from home is growing. A natural 
starting place for many businesses seems to be the garage, basement, or den. A recent Census Bureau study showed that over 
300,000 women's businesses are operated out of the home.</p>
<p>Homemakers, hobbyists, retirees, people interested in a second income, and the disabled are just a few of the groups attracted 
to home enterprises. A young mother's craft business began when she started appliqueing decorations on her children's clothes. 
A retired government worker bought 36 beehives and sold honey to local health food stores and at craft fairs. A teacher did 
typing and secretarial jobs for her husband and friends until she realized the potential market and opened a full- time secretarial 
service from her apartment. Others have become home business owners by using their skills in catering, counseling, teaching, day 
care, sewing, writing, photography, consulting, market research, and landscape design.</p>
<p>The list of services that have been successfully operated from home is endless: chimney sweeping, maid services, messenger 
services, wake- up and answering services, home nursing, mail order businesses, party planning, dog grooming, kitchen and 
closet planning and organizing, and others too numerous to mention. As you explore the questions asked in the first chapter, 
&quot;Home Entrepreneurship: Is It For You,&quot; let your thoughts run freely through the possibilities until you can target exactly the right 
type of business for your skills, your home space, your market, and your part of the country.</p>
<h4>1 Home Entrepreneurship:</h4>
<p>Is It For You?</p>
<p>The first step in deciding whether to start a business is to ask yourself this important question: &quot;Do I have what it takes to be an 
entrepreneur?&quot; Studying the characteristics of successful business owners will help you to tell whether your personality traits, 
experiences, and values are similar to those who have succeeded. And assessing your experience, skills, and life goals will also 
help you decide if you want to invest the energy, time, and resources that successful entrepreneurship requires.</p>
<p>Who is the &quot;Typical&quot; Entrepreneur?</p>
<p>What makes an entrepreneur successful is a hotly debated and vigorously researched subject. In Success And Survival In The 
Family- Owned Business, Pat B. Alcorn, an expert on entrepreneurial problems, has developed the following questionnaire to 
help you determine your &quot;Entrepreneurial Quotient.&quot; Write your answers in the margin. Then read on to discover what she 
believes characterizes the typical entrepreneur:</p>
<p>Do you reconcile your bank account as soon as the monthly statement comes in?</p>
<p>Entrepreneurs are careful about money. They usually know how much money they have so they can seize opportunities on short 
notice. They know what things cost, whether prices are going up or down, and whether they are getting a bargain. Did you earn 
money on your own from some source other than your family before you were 10 years old?</p>
<p>Most people who are going to make money in business show an affinity for making money at an early age- - by babysitting, 
selling lemonade, delivering newspapers, or some such strategy.</p>
<p>Did you take part in competitive sports in school and do you continue to do so?</p>
<p>Entrepreneurs obviously have a competitive nature and many of them show this at an early age in sports activities. It is not so 
much that sports train people to be entrepreneurs; rather, the same inner drives push people to be athletes and entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>Do you get up early in the morning and find yourself at work before others are out of bed?</p>
<p>Entrepreneurs sleep and eat enough to keep up theirstrength, but they don't usually tarry at these pursuits.</p>
<p>Do you tend to trust your hunches rather than wait until you have a lot of information on hand?</p>
<p>Hunches are judgments based on factors that cannot be quantified. A big part of entrepreneurship seems to be risk- taking based 
on these hunches.</p>
<p>Do you keep new ideas in your head instead of writing them down?</p>
<p>Entrepreneurs keep a lot of things in their heads, including their most creative ideas.</p>
<p>Do you remember people's names and faces well?</p>
<p>Ease in remembering names and faces is very important in the business world.</p>
<p>Were you good in &quot;hard&quot; subjects- - mathematics, biology, engineering, accounting, and so forth- - in school?</p>
<p>People who major in business administration in college are more likely to be successful entrepreneurs than anyone else. They 
prefer subjects in which the answers are conclusive rather than open- ended conclusions full of contingencies.</p>
<p>In school, did you pretty much stay away from such organizations as Scouts and student government?</p>
<p>Most entrepreneurs tend to be loners rather than joiners, unless joining is a useful tactic for making contacts and gathering 
business information.</p>
<p>In courting the opposite sex, did you tend to go for one person at a time as opposed to playing the field?</p>
<p>Most entrepreneurs preferred one person because to play the field would have taken too much time away from business 
activities.</p>
<p>Do you close deals with a handshake rather than insisting on written contracts and guarantees?</p>
<p>Good entrepreneurs are often comfortable with something less binding than written contracts. When the only bond is a word, it 
becomes a matter of honor, and no entrepreneur can afford to lose honor.</p>
<p>Do you devote considerably more time and thought to work than to other activities, such as hobbies?</p>
<p>Entrepreneurs may have some leisure time activities, but their principal hobby is their work.</p>
<p>A similar test was developed by John Komives, director of Milwaukee's Center for Venture Management. Again, write your 
answers in the margin, then read on to see the expert's answers.</p>
<p>Was your parent an entrepreneur?</p>
<p>Having a close relative who was an entrepreneur is the single most telling indicator of a successful entrepreneur.</p>
<p>Are you an immigrant?</p>
<p>There is a high correlation between immigrants and entrepreneurs. In this sense, &quot;immigrant&quot; includes not only those who were 
born outside the United States, but also those who moved from farm to city or from the Midwest to the West Coast.</p>
<p>Did you have a paper route?</p>
<p>The entrepreneurial streak shows up early in life.</p>
<p>Were you a good student?</p>
<p>Typical entrepreneurs were anything but model students and often were expelled from school.</p>
<p>Do you have a favorite spectator sport?</p>
<p>The best answer is &quot;no.&quot; Entrepreneurs are poor spectators. They often excel at individual, fast- paced sports such as skiing or 
sailing.</p>
<p>What size company do you now work for?</p>
<p>The typical entrepreneur comes from a medium- sized company- - 30 to 500 employees.</p>
<p>Have you ever been fired?</p>
<p>Entrepreneurs make poor employees. That's why they become entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>If you had a new business going, would you play your cards close to the vest, or would you be willing to discuss problems with 
your employees?</p>
<p>Typical entrepreneurs have a secretive streak. If they confide in anyone, it is likely to be another entrepreneur.</p>
<p>Are you an inventor? A Ph.D.?</p>
<p>Not a positive indicator. Inventors fall in love with their products, Ph.D.s with their research.</p>
<p>How old are your?</p>
<p>The typical age for starting a business seems to be 32- 35.</p>
<p>When do you plan to retire?</p>
<p>Entrepreneurs don't retire. They may sell a business and think they will retire, but they are always out there starting a new 
business.</p>
<p>In still another study, Jeffry A. Timmons asserts that entrepreneurs are people who have high energy, feel self- confident, set 
long- term goals, and view money as a measure of accomplishment. They persist in problem solving, take moderate risks, learn 
from failures, seek and use feedback, take initiative, accept personal responsibility, and use all available resources. They 
compete with themselves and believe that success or failure lies within their personal control or influence. They can tolerate 
ambiguity.</p>
<p>Are You Ready, Willing, and Able?</p>
<p>Now that you have studied the characteristics of others who have succeeded, survey your reasons for wanting a home- based 
business. Are you dissatisfied with your current job? What are your skills? What is your business experience, especially in the 
business you want to start? What are your life goals? What resources do you have that might help?</p>
<p>Answering these questions will provide reality testing for ideas that can sound incredibly glamorous when chatting with friends or 
seductively attractive when you are irritated or bored by your present job.</p>
<p>Order a copy of the SBA pamphlet Checklist For Going Into Business, MA 2.016 (see For Further Information). Answer the 
questions and discuss your reactions with friends and family. Or better yet, ask several people close to you to think carefully 
about you and fill out the checklist for you. Have you underestimated your abilities? Overestimated them? Sometimes an 
evaluation by a friend is more useful than a self- evaluation.</p>
<p>How does your family react to the idea of a home business? Will you expect them to help out? What changes would your 
business use of the house mean for them? Will you have to remodel to create a usable business space?</p>
<p>What resources are available to you? Will you start by keeping your job and &quot;moonlighting&quot; for a while? Do you have a small 
nest egg, inheritance, or retirement income to live on until you get the business going? Do you already own tools or machines that 
will help (for instance, a word processor for a secretarial business or professional cameras and a darkroom for a commercial 
photography business)? Are you able to go back to school for training if necessary? Have you built up a network of contacts and 
possible customers through your previous lines of work or will you be starting from scratch? </p>
<p>Answering these questions honestly and completely will help you assess not only your chances for success but also which type of 
home- based business to choose. For instance, if your past professional life and contacts are all in the educational, teaching, 
child- oriented school area, then you should have powerful reasons for leaving that and opening a mail- order seed business. 
Possibly a tutoring business or a tot exercise franchise would use more of your resources and networks. On the other hand, if 
your assessment of your life goals and preferences helps you realize that you are burned out from working with kids, then 
perhaps a business planning birthday parties could later be built into a general party planning and catering business. You would 
be using your old contacts to build a long- range business plan that focuses on a service business for adults.</p>
<p>The Advantages of Home- Based Business</p>
<p>Why have millions of Americans chosen to work and live in the same place? Why are cottage industries sprouting faster than we 
can count them? Some home- based businesses start by accident rather than by conscious design. Secretarial services, day- care 
centers, craft ventures, and the like may start out as weekend activities in the recreation room. After a while their owners are 
surprised to see how profitable or enjoyable the venture has become. The glimpse of a healthy market lures them into a full- time 
venture. This low- risk, low- overhead, gradual kind of start- up is very attractive to new business people.</p>
<p>Many home- based business people cite decreased commuting time and other lessened business expenses as advantages for 
working at home. If your place of work is just 30 minutes away, that's five hours a week in commuting time, many dollars in 
gasoline and car maintenance or transit fares, and untold stress fighting traffic. Getting out of the high- fashion rat race is a plus for 
many who dislike having to dress up and continually buy new clothes to feel comfortable in settings outside the home.</p>
<p>Homemakers- - mostly women but also an increasing number of men- - are choosing a home- based business in order to have a 
more flexible lifestyle and to be closer to family. A parent who has a home office can eat lunch with the children or more easily 
attend special school or sports events. The home- based business person has more control over work hours than someone with 
a 9 to 5 job. Night owls who like to work until 3 a.m. can then sleep late (remembering, of course, to turn on the answering 
machine and let customers know the business hours). On the other hand, early birds can work without the usual disturbance from 
the telephones.</p>
<p>The tax advantages of operating a business from home are numerous but sometimes complicated. Wise business owners keep 
careful records and work with accountants, attorneys, and financial planners to make sure they are filing for the legal maximum 
write- offs and benefits.</p>
<p>The Disadvantages of a Home- Based Business</p>
<p>If you were hard at work in an office downtown, it is unlikely that three children would come storming in to ask for snacks or that 
you would end up using the ironing board for a bookshelf or have to think twice about hiring others because they might resent 
working at your kitchen table. These are just a few of the problems that make the glamour of working at home fade fast. Some 
disadvantages of working at home can be minimized by self- discipline, by setting clear limits with family and friends, and by 
projecting a professional image. Other disadvantages &quot;come with the turf&quot; and just have to be lived with. If a delivery man comes 
to the door, you will probably be the one to interrupt your work and sign for the package.</p>
<p>It takes time and discipline to establish steady, at- home work patterns. Often it seems easier to water the plants or do the 
laundry than to call a client, design a new brochure, or prepare bills for customers whose work you've completed. Without the 
deadlines imposed by supervisors or peers, it can be hard to do the least appealing jobs on your list. To make matters worse, 
others may not take you seriously. Neighbors may stop by to chat or friends may call your business number knowing you will 
answer. Without supervisors or managers, you are the one who must set limits and plan your time. There also is the problem of 
isolation. While you are now your own boss, you won't have the chats, the parties, the companionship of fellow workers. Losing 
such social contact requires adjustments.</p>
<p>As the business grows and changes, the home entrepreneur has to put up with cramped or inappropriate space. No more simply 
putting in a request for a bigger file cabinet or a new copy machine; now you must visit showrooms or garage sales, evaluate 
features, compare prices, and probably pick the item up yourself.</p>
<p>Your teenager may resent having to keep the stereo low because you're meeting with a client in the next room. Your spouse may 
be irritated by having to fry that freshly caught trout on the backyard grill so your office won't smell of fish. Your son may not 
want to give up the recreation room pool table so you can cut out 100 doll patterns this weekend. Neighbors may comment on 
the extra traffic your customers create on their quiet street. Family privacy and lifestyle patterns may be disturbed. And you will 
probably find yourself wrestling with laws and regulations you never dreamed could exist before you went into business.</p>
<p>Your Professional Image</p>
<p>Developing a professional image may be hard if you work out of your home. Projecting a businesslike image is an important part 
of building credibility with your customers and contributes to your own professional self- image. Design a logo or have one 
designed; order business cards and stationery. Set regular business hours. Use an answering machine or answering service. If 
other members of the family also answer the phone, make sure they know what to say. Have a businesslike office or &quot;showroom&quot; 
if you meet customers face to face. Consider referring to your apartment number as your &quot;suite number&quot; or rent a post office box 
rather than using your street address. Such practices might improve your chances of doing business with potential customers.</p>
<p>Your Next Steps</p>
<p>Now that you have reflected on the characteristics of successful entrepreneurship and assessed your skills, experience, and life 
goals, it's time to plan your next steps. Ask yourself: Given the disadvantages of working out of my home, do I still want to? 
Now that I know more about what's involved in starting a business, is it still for me? Do I need further training or experience? 
Should I begin part- time in order to test the waters, check our market potential, or refine my product or service? Do I need 
more time to research possible products or services? Have I decided on a particular business? The next chapter will help you 
define your business, the market, and the price to charge for your product or service.</p>
<p>Others Have Succeeded- - Why Not You?</p>
<p>A former teacher tells how she started her own tutoring business:</p>
<p>I taught languages in high school for seven years. Whenever I needed a little extra money, or during summer vacations, I tutored 
individual students. As my reputation grew, people began to ask me if I could recommend tutors in other subjects.</p>
<p>As my enthusiasm for teaching in public schools waned, I began to research the possibility of a tutoring business. I started one 
summer by turning my second bedroom into an office and having stationery printed. Summer is a peak time because parents hire 
tutors to help their kids catch up on subjects By the end of that summer I was managing 48 tutors in 23 different subjects or 
grade levels all over the metropolitan area. I hired a part- time assistant who worked at the kitchen table. We added other 
services, such as classes to help high- school students prepare for national exams. Operating from home was perfect for me since 
I needed to keep my overhead low and keep a good cash flow to be able to pay my tutors.</p>
<p>A computer programmer tells his story:</p>
<p>I longed to get enough work doing computer programming so that I could avoid the long commute to work and be closer to my 
two young boys as they grew up. I started working in an office I built in the basement doing small jobs and working for friends in 
the business who were up against tight deadlines. When I got my first big contract, I took the leap and gave notice. Now, two 
years later I've established a good track record with clients and have hired two others who work at terminals in my recreation 
room. I like being able to work late at night after the family is asleep. And I enjoy being around when the kids get home from 
school. I don't need a fancy downtown office. If I meet with a client, I make sure it's at his office, not mine.</p>
<h4>2 Answering The Big Question:</h4>
<p>What? Who? Where? How? and How Much?</p>
<p>What's the perfect home business for you? You've listed your skills. You've outlined your interests. You've described your 
family's preferred lifestyle. You've come up with a business idea. Next, consider such questions as: Are there customers for my 
product or service? How do I know? How will I find them? Who are my competitors? What will I charge? How will I promote 
my product or service? Finding the answers to these questions is the challenging and sometimes tedious homework that will help 
you determine your chances for success, and whether you should look for another more marketable idea.</p>
<p>What Is My Product?</p>
<p>&quot;I bathe and groom poodles and small dogs.&quot; &quot;I design, construct, and sell roll- top desks.&quot; &quot;I provide accounting services to 
small business clients.&quot; &quot;I make dried flower arrangements.&quot; &quot;I teach intermediate and advanced piano to children.&quot; &quot;I design and 
implement direct mail advertising campaigns for small businesses and nonprofit organizations.&quot; </p>
<p>The first step in creating a business is to decide what your product is. What are you selling? Practice writing a short, specific 
statement describing your product or service. Getting a clear idea of a business concept is one of the most difficult tasks in 
creating a business. Your statement may change several times as you experiment with the market and test your skills. Instead of 
&quot;I make toys,&quot; you may want to narrow your product line to &quot;I make wooden dolls.&quot; Instead of &quot;I write software programs for 
small business needs,&quot; you may decide to tap into a big market and &quot;provide training for employees of small businesses in the use 
of accounting packages.&quot; See how it feels to describe your product or service to family, friends, potential customers, and fellow 
business people. Is your description clear and brief? Can you say it with confidence and enthusiasm?</p>
<p>Who Will Buy It?</p>
<p>To develop and test your business idea, answer the question &quot;Who will buy my product or service?&quot; Make a list of potential 
customers: individuals, groups, segments of the population, or other businesses that need your product or service. If you are 
making fabric- covered lap boards for people confined to bed, how will you quickly and inexpensively find a market? Through 
hospitals or home nursing care organizations? Through craft stores by displaying them as gift items? In mail order catalogues? Is 
there a market avenue that will reach children? Ask friends and colleagues for help in brainstorming all the possible markets 
(customers) and uses for your product or service.</p>
<p>Who Is the Competition?</p>
<p>Your business planning must also include an up- to- date analysis of your competition. Why? Because you need to plan your 
market position- - how you will fit into the marketplace. Will your product or service be cheaper or more expensive than that of 
the major competitors? Will it be more durable? Will you be open during hours that your competitors are closed? What benefits 
can you build into your product or service that your competitors don't offer? Will you do rush jobs?</p>
<p>In planning your business, look for a unique niche that will give you freedom from strong competition or that will make your 
product or service more valuable than others in the market. If you plan to open a day- care center and find that none in your area 
is open before school, early opening might make your service more competitive. If you discover that local caterers have 
overlooked the office party market, you might highlight that in your brochure. The more you can learn about your competition, 
the better you'll be able to decide how to position yourself in the market.</p>
<p>Newspaper ads and trade magazines are other good sources of market information. Check also with the Chamber of 
Commerce, your county office of economic development, the Census Bureau, and business and professional organizations to 
gather market and pricing data.</p>
<p>Where Are the Buyers? How Can I Find Them?</p>
<p>As you become more familiar with the competition, you will also be discovering where and how to find buyers. Whatever the 
type of home business you want to open, you will need to do market research to determine if there are buyers for your idea, 
where they are, and how to find them. (And in the process, you will also be gathering information on pricing.)</p>
<p>Visit your local library to compile local and county statistics on the size and makeup of your market. (While you are at the library, 
check out some books on marketing research so you will know what you are getting into.) Also, check those of the following 
resources that might have data about your product or service or the people who would use it:</p>

<p>When your marketing research is completed you will have 1) identified your potential customers; 2) found out all you can about 
their habits, needs, preferences, and buying cycles; and 3) decided how to reach them to generate sales.</p>
<p>How Much Shall I Charge?</p>
<p>Four main factors will help you decide what to charge for your product or service: 1) your direct and indirect costs; 2) the profit 
you want to make; 3) your market research data on competitors' prices; and 4) the urgency of the market demand. There is 
rarely an exact &quot;right&quot; price but rather an acceptable price range within which you will want to fall. Avoid the common mistakes 
made by many new business owners- - charging too much or too little. Use several approaches to arrive at a cost and &quot;test&quot; the 
price. If your ego is too involved, your price may be too high. On the other hand, if you have the attitude that &quot;this is just a little 
something I do in my spare time&quot; or &quot;anybody could do this,&quot; then your price may be too low.</p>
<p>Here is a formula for setting a fair price. Calculate your price using other approaches, too, before you make a final decision on 
price:</p>
<p>Typical Pricing Formula</p>
<p>1. Direct Material Costs- - Figure the total cost of the raw materials you have to use to make up your item. Figure the cost of a 
group of items and then divide by the number of items to find the cost per item. If you can easily and immediately determine the 
material cost of a single item, fine. Some items are produced in batches, however, and it is easier to get an item cost by dividing 
the cost of a batch by the number of items eventually produced.</p>
<p>2. Direct Labor Costs- - Figure what you pay to employees to produce the item (whether or not you have employees now). You 
must assign a wage figure, even if you are the only one producing the item. Take the weekly salary you pay someone to produce 
the necessary number of items and divide it by the number of items. Add this figure to the Direct Material Costs total.</p>
<p>Materials + Labor = $________.</p>
<p>3. Overhead Expenses- - These expenses include rent, gas and electricity, business telephone calls, packing and shipping 
supplies, delivery and freight charges, cleaning, insurance, office supplies, postage, payroll taxes, repairs, and maintenance. The 
accuracy of your costing depends on estimating logical amounts for all categories of expenses. If you are working at home, figure 
a portion of your total rent or mortgage payment (in proportion to your work space and storage areas), or assign a reasonable, 
competitive rent figure for the same amount and type of space. List all overhead expense items and total them. Divide the total 
overhead figure by the number of items per month (or time period you used above). The answer is your overhead per item.</p>
<p>Overhead + Materials + Labor = Total Cost/Item </p>
<p>4. Profit- - Include an amount added to the cost of each item so you won't end up just breaking even or making the employees' 
wages. Check your competition and see what they are charging. (Retailers generally double the wholesale price.) If your product 
is a little better than the competition, charge a little more. If your product is comparable, price it similarly. Remember, you will get 
the profit from each sale, in addition to the salary figure. Add the profit figure you have chosen to the total cost per item to get 
your total price per item.</p>
<p>Profit + Total Cost/Item = Total Price/Item</p>
<p>Remember, the main purpose in operating a business is to make a profit. Don't undersell your product or service just because 
&quot;I'd be baking cakes anyway&quot; or &quot;I'm just starting out&quot; or &quot;I work out of my home.&quot; If you have a new, rare, handmade product 
or personalized service, the demand may be so high that customers are willing to pay a little more.</p>
<p>Promotion</p>
<p>Promotion is an overall, long- range plan designed to inform potential customers about what you have to sell. Advertising is 
usually thought of as the paid communication part of the promotion program.</p>
<p>To develop a total promotional campaign you must answer these questions: 1) What image or message do I want to promote? 2) 
What are the best media and activities for reaching my potential customers? 3) How much time and money can I spend on the 
effort?</p>
<p>Develop a long- range, consistent program for building image and reaching customers. Your image should be reflected in your 
business card, logo, stationery, brochure, newsletter, telephone answering service, signs, paid ads, and promotional activities.</p>
<p>Word- of- mouth recommendations from satisfied customers are the very best promotion any business can have. Consider which 
promotional tactics will build the confidence and image you are looking for- - giving speeches and interviews (often good for 
counselors, teachers, lawyers, consultants), having an open house or holiday home sale (for craftspeople), holiday recitals or 
shows (for music and dance teachers or day- care operators), free demonstrations and samples (for retailers, decorators, 
caterers).</p>
<p>Several small ads may have more impact than one large, splashy ad. Conduct a campaign rather than having a one- shot ad or 
event. If you hire a public relations firm, look for one that can give you personal attention and develop a total marketing plan for 
you, not just a couple of ads. The plan should include market research, a profile of your target audience, a clear description of 
the image they recommend you project, the written copy, and a list of media (including cost and scheduling calendars) that are 
best for your type of product or service. As a new small business owner, you will probably decide to set aside a certain dollar 
amount per year or a percentage of past, current, or projected sales for paid advertising.</p>
<h4>3 Managing Your Business:</h4>
<p>Structure, Recordkeeping, Taxes, and Insurance</p>
<p>You're The Boss.</p>
<p>A telling sign on a new businessowner's desk read: &quot;Yesterday I didn't even know how to spell ENTREPRENEUR and now I 
are one!&quot; Now that you have decided to open a home- based business, all decisions will be your responsibility, not just those 
you previously enjoyed because they involved your area of expertise. Of course, as a day- care operator you already knew how 
to soothe an upset child, but as the owner of that business, do you know when to file your taxes? As a consultant you have over 
20 years' experience advising organizations on personnel matters, but do you know if it's to your advantage to incorporate? You 
are an expert at word processing, but do you know how to develop an efficient recordkeeping and billing system? You are the 
boss now and the good health of your business depends on your management skills.</p>
<p>Choosing Your Form of Business Organization</p>
<p>One of the most important decisions you will make is how to set up the business as a 1) sole proprietorship, 2) partnership, or 3) 
corporation. Remember, the small business owner risks it all, no matter what form of organization.</p>
<p>The forming of a business organization depends on the following factors:</p>
<pre>
   * Legal restrictions
   * Need for capital
   * Liabilities assumed
   * Number of people associated in the venture
   * Kind of business or operation
   * Tax advantages or disadvantages
   * Intended division of earnings
   * Perpetuation of the business</pre>
<p>Most home- based businesses are sole proprietorships or partnerships, but a comparison of the advantages and disadvantages of 
each type of organization follows:</p>
<p>A sole proprietorship is the least costly way of starting a business. You can form a sole proprietorship by finding a location and 
opening the door for business. There are the usual fees for registering your business name and for legal work in changing zoning 
restrictions and obtaining necessary licenses. Attorney's fees for starting your business will be less than for the other forms 
because less document preparation is required.</p>
<pre> Sole Proprietorship
        Advantages                     Disadvantages

   * Easiest to get started       * Unlimited liability

   * Greatest freedom of action   * Death or illness endanger
                                    business

   * Maximum authority            * Growth limited to personal
                                    energies

   * Income tax advantages in     * Personal affairs easily
     very small firms               mixed with business

   * Social Security advantage to
     owner</pre>
<p>A partnership can be formed by simply making an oral agreement between two or more persons, but such informality is not 
recommended. Legal fees for drawing up a partnership agreement are higher than those for a sole proprietorship, but may be 
lower than incorporating. You would be wise, however, to consult an attorney to have a partnership agreement drawn up to help 
resolve future disputes.</p>
<pre>
     Partnership
     Advantages                     Disadvantages

   * Two heads better than one    * Death, withdrawal, or
                                    bankruptcy of one partner
   * Additional sources of          endangers business
     venture capital

   * Better credit rating than    * Difficult to get rid of bad
     corporation of similar size    partner

   * Hazy line of authority
</pre>
<p>You can incorporate without an attorney, but you would be unwise to do so. You may think a small family corporation does not 
need an attorney, but an attorney can save members of a family corporation from hard feelings and family squabbles. Attorney's 
fees may run high if organization problems are complex. The corporate form is usually the most costly to organize.</p>
<pre>
Corporation
     Advantages                     Disadvantages

   * Limited liability for        * Gives owner a false sense
     stockholders (while true       of security
     for big business, may not
     be for small business)       * Heavier taxes

   * Continuity                   * Power limited by Charter

   * Transfer of shares           * Less freedom of activity

   * Easier to raise capital      * Legal formalities

   * Possible to separate         * Expensive to launch
     business functions into
     different corporations</pre>
<p>Recordkeeping</p>
<p>Keeping accurate and up- to- date business records is, for many people, the most difficult and uninteresting aspect of operating a 
home- based business. If this area of business management is one that you anticipate will be hard for you, plan now how you will 
cope. Don't wait until tax time or until you are totally confused. Take a course at the local community college, ask a volunteer 
SCORE (Service Corps of Retired Executives) representative from the Small Business Administration to help you in the 
beginning, or hire an accountant to advise you on setting up and maintaining a recordkeeping system.</p>
<p>Your records will be used to prepare tax returns, make business decisions, and apply for loans. Set aside a special time each day 
to update your records. It will pay off in the long run with more deductions and fewer headaches.</p>
<p>If your business is small or related to an activity that is usually considered a hobby, it's even more important that you keep good 
records. The IRS may decide that what you are doing is only a hobby, and you won't be allowed to deduct expenses or losses 
from your home- produced income at tax time. So keep records of all transactions in which you spend or bring in money. Pick a 
name for your business and register it with local or state regulatory authorities. Call your city hall or county courthouse to find out 
how.</p>
<pre>
     Your records should tell you these three facts:

   * How much cash you owe,

   * How much cash you are due, and

   * How much cash you have on hand.

     You should keep five basic journals:

  1. Check register- - Shows each check disbursed, the date of
     disbursement, number of the check, to whom it was made out
     (payee), the amount of money disbursed, and for what
     purpose.
  2. Cash receipts- - Shows the amount of money received, from
     whom, and for what.
  3. Sales journal- - Shows the business transaction, date, for
     whom it was performed, the amount of the invoice, and the
     sales tax, if applicable. It may be divided to indicate
     labor and goods.
  4. Voucher register- - A record of bills, money owed, the date
     of the bill, to whom it is owed, the amount, and the   
     service.

  5. General journal- - A means of adjusting some entries in the
     other four journals.</pre>
<p>Choosing a Recordkeeping System</p>
<p>Set up your records to reflect the amount and type of activity in your particular business. There are a wide range of pre- 
packaged recordkeeping systems. The SBA's pamphlet Small Business Bibliography No. 15 (see &quot;For Further Information&quot;) lists 
many such systems. The most useful system for a small, home- based business is usually based on what is called the &quot;One- Write 
System.&quot; It captures information at the time the transaction takes place. These One- Write Systems are efficient because they 
eliminate the need for recopying the data and are compatible with electronic data processing if you should decide to computerize.</p>
<p>Even though you may be small and just beginning, it is probably wise to consult an accountant to help you decide which 
recordkeeping system is best for your business. Once it is set up, you can record the daily transactions or periodically have a 
bookkeeper post your daily transactions in your General Ledger and prepare your financial statements.</p>
<p>Be sure to establish a separate bank account for your business- - even before the first sale. Then you will have a complete and 
distinct record of your income and expenditures for tax purposes, and you won't have to remember which expenses were 
business and which were personal.</p>
<p>It is important to choose a recordkeeping system that you understand and will use. It will help you see how well the business is 
doing and is the first step in responsible financial management.</p>
<p>Tax Obligations and Benefits</p>
<p>Significant tax savings are available to the home- based businessowner in the form of deductions, credits, and depreciation 
allowances. The time, money, and energy you put into keeping good records and keeping current on tax laws will be worthwhile 
and ensure that you operate within the law. You will need to plan for income tax, social security (all self- employed persons must 
pay a federal self- employment tax), employees' taxes (if you hire anyone), property tax on your home and business- related 
taxes, such as sales tax, gross- receipts or inventory tax (in some states and localities), and excise or individual item taxes (on 
certain commodities).</p>
<p>The Internal Revenue Service supplies the following free booklets (and runs free workshops) to give you details on your specific 
obligations:</p>
<p>* Your Federal Income Tax (Publication 17)</p>
<p>* Tax Guide for Small Business (Publication 334)</p>
<p>* Business Use of Your Home (Publication 587)</p>
<p>* Employer's Tax Guide (Circular E)</p>
<p>* Self- Employment Tax (Publication 533)</p>
<p>* Tax Information on Retirement Plans for the Self- Employed (Publication 560)</p>
<p>* Tax Information on Depreciation (Publication 534)</p>
<p>* Information on Excise Taxes (Publication 510)</p>
<p>* Tax Withholding and Estimated Tax (Publication 505)</p>
<p>There are various federal and state forms you will need to fill out to start a small business. The federal government requires you 
to fill out several forms including the following:</p>
<p>* Application for Employer Identification Number (Form SS- 4) (If you have employees or are subject to excise tax)</p>
<p>* Employer's Annual Unemployment Tax Return (Form 940)</p>
<p>* Employer's Quarterly Federal Tax Return (Form 941)</p>
<p>* Employee's Withholding Allowance Certificate (W- 4)</p>
<p>* Employer's Wage and Tax Statement (W- 2)</p>
<p>* Reconciliation/Transmittal of Income and Tax Statements (W- 3)</p>
<p>As a home- based business owner you should be aware that every business decision- - each purchase and transaction you 
make- - has tax implications or built- in tax advantages or disadvantages. Deductions may be available for home maintenance 
and improvements; automobile expenses; telephone expenses; office and work space; inventory space; major purchases, such as 
a computer; and a wide variety of other items such as uniforms, coffee service, trademarks, a safe deposit box, credit bureau 
fees, and business cards.</p>
<p>Each business situation is different and tax laws change, so consult up- to- date references, a trusted attorney, and an accountant 
who can advise you on your particular obligations and benefits.</p>
<p>Insurance</p>
<p>Insurance helps to safeguard your business against losses from fire, illness, and injury. You cannot operate without it. Talk with 
an insurance representative about your business needs. Check with the insurance carriers on your home policy and make sure 
business use of your home is compatible with your homeowner's policy. In addition to a homeowner's policy (personal plan), 
now that you have a business, you will need a commercial policy for full protection. Discuss these other possible needs with your 
agent:</p>
<p>* Product Liability Coverage- - to protect you in case your product causes injury to the user</p>
<p>* Auto Liability and &quot;Non- owned&quot; Auto Liability Insurance- - if a car is ever used to support the business in any way</p>
<p>* Medical Payments Insurance- - payable if someone is injured in your home whether or not it was your fault</p>
<p>* Worker's Compensation- - if you have employees</p>
<p>* Business Interruption Insurance or Earnings Insurance- - in case your business is damaged by fire or some other cause and you 
must totally or partially suspend operations</p>
<p>* Disability Income Protection- - a form of health insurance in case you become disabled</p>
<p>* Business Life Insurance- - to provide funds for transition if you die</p>
<p>Be sure to keep all your insurance records and policies in a safe place- - either with your accountant or in a safe deposit box. If 
you keep them at home for convenience sake, then give your policy numbers and insurance company names to your accountant 
or lawyer or put it in your safe deposit box.</p>
<p>Final advice for the wise business person is to read and understand the fine print in all policies and to reevaluate business 
insurance needs about every six months.</p>
<p>Other Considerations</p>
<p>Another aspect of planning is sheltering tax dollars through a Keogh Plan or corporate pension and profit- sharing plans, if your 
business is incorporated, or a retirement plan.</p>
<p>If you have a partnership, consider making a Buy and Sell Agreement with your partner(s). This agreement requires the surviving 
partner(s) to buy, and the heirs to sell, the deceased partner's interest. The surviving partner(s) then becomes the sole owner(s) 
and the heirs receive cash for their share of the business.</p>
<h4>4 Dealing With Laws:Zoning, Licensing, Permits, and Others</h4>
<p>Unfortunately, many home- based business people try to &quot;slide&quot; into business, saying &quot;I'll just try it for a few months and see how 
things go&quot; or &quot;It's not really a business. I have only ten clients.&quot; This attitude can lead to a lack of planning and big 
disappointments. If you set up your studio, print business cards and flyers announcing classes, and then find that regulations make 
it illegal to operate out of your home, you may have to start all over.</p>
<p>Zoning</p>
<p>Before you start your home- based business, do a thorough investigation of the zoning laws in your community. Zoning 
regulations spell out activities permitted and prohibited in specific portions of a city or county. Call your town hall, zoning office, 
or local library to get a copy of zoning laws. Find out the structure of your local zoning groups. Most areas have Planning, 
Zoning, and Appeals Boards.</p>
<p>If the home business you are planning conforms to zoning regulations, then all you need to do is keep abreast of new proposals 
that may affect your situation. It's a good idea to stay in touch with others operating from their homes by joining business 
organizations or neighborhood groups in case you ever need to band together to propose or oppose new regulations. 
Maintaining a low profile and friendly relations with your neighbors will result in more support from them should adverse 
regulations affecting your business ever be proposed. If through your research you discover that the home business you are 
planning would violate the zoning code, there are several possible ways to proceed. You might wish to check with an attorney 
who specializes in zoning law to look for a legal way around the regulation. You might decide to apply to the Zoning Board for a 
variance or exception. Or you may be able to change your business enough to make the operation fit the law. </p>
<p>If the regulation outlaws businesses that employ people other than the owner at home, maybe you can have employees take 
work to their own homes. If your business will create too much traffic, consider another strategy for product distribution. If your 
business will create too much noise, maybe you can soundproof your house. At last resort, ask yourself &quot;Is it worth it to organize 
a drive to change the law?&quot; Considering the rapid growth in the number of home- based businesses, you just might find other 
entrepreneurs who are also interested in submitting a change in the regulations to the Zoning Board. Go to meetings of the Board 
and try to identify the person who appears most active and most sympathetic to your position.</p>
<p>In the unfortunate and unlikely (most zoning officers don't have time to chase people who aren't bothering anybody) event that 
you are issued a &quot;cease and desist&quot; order, you should: 1) file an appeal immediately with the Appeals Board (if you interpret the 
regulations differently than they do); or 2) submit a change in the regulation to the Zoning Board to allow your business, which 
may enable you to continue to operate without fines until the Board reaches a decision. You may need a lawyer if you are not 
entirely familiar with the regulations and the workings of the Board.</p>
<p>Cultural and national trends point in the direction of zoning regulations that allow quiet, nonpolluting, low- traffic kinds of home 
businesses. More and more corporations are employing people to work at home. Most neighborhoods will adopt a &quot;live and let 
live&quot; attitude if you keep your premises neat and quiet and don't create traffic and parking problems.</p>
<p>Keeping Up With Zoning Legislation</p>
<p>There are two ways to keep up with zoning legislation in your community (and with other topics of interest to home- based 
entrepreneurs). One way is to read local newspapers, especially the business section and the local or &quot;neighborhood&quot; sections. 
Be sure you notice local items about such things as proposed subway stations or the county's plan for revitalization. Changes like 
these could eventually influence zoning in your area. The other way to keep abreast of trends and zoning issues is to join the local 
chapter of a business group, such as the Rotary Club, the National Association of Women Business Owners, the National Family 
Business Council, or a Business and Professional Women's Club. Through newsletters, meetings, and friendships that develop, 
you will hear all the latest local (and national) issues discussed while you learn valuable business skills and make useful contacts.</p>
<p>Working With Professionals</p>
<p>Even the smallest and newest business needs help from at least two kinds of specialists: an attorney and an accountant. 
Depending on your type of business and your skills you may, from time to time, ask the advice of other professionals, such as a 
direct mail or marketing specialist, an insurance representative, management consultant, a computer specialist, a realtor, a public 
relations expert. </p>
<p>Several guidelines will hold true no matter what type of expert you are dealing with: 1) Interview professionals to see if you will 
be comfortable working with them. Make sure they have served other small businesses similar to yours. Find out ahead of time 
exactly what service you are buying, what the working relationship will be, and what fees will be charged. 2) Be completely 
honest about your business situation. Advice based on partial or incorrect information is no advice at all. If you are having 
problems, don't be embarrassed. If your sales are down, give the experts all the information you have and work as a team to 
solve the problem. If business is good, don't be afraid that professionals will steal your idea or expect a raise. Build a trusting, 
businesslike relationship. 3) Expect the professionals you hire to spend at least some of their time teaching you and explaining 
complex concepts. But don't expect to be spoon- fed or delegate all decisions to them. Take a course at the local community 
college in recordkeeping and taxes or public relations to develop more skill in areas where you are inexperienced. 4) Keep your 
appointments and pay your bills promptly.</p>
<p>Your Lawyer</p>
<p>To find a lawyer who is familiar with businesses of your size and type, ask for a referral from a business colleague, your 
accountant, the local Chamber of Commerce, your banker, or some other trusted source. Some local bar associations run a 
lawyer referral and information service. Some just give you names; others actually give information on experience and fees to 
help you match your needs to the lawyer's background and charges.</p>
<p>A lawyer can help you decide which is the most advantageous business structure (sole proprietorship, partnership, or 
corporation). He or she can help you with zoning, permit, or licensing problems; health inspection problems; unpaid bills; 
contracts and agreements; patents, trademarks, copyright protection; and some tax problems. Because there is always the 
possibility of a lawsuit, claim, or other legal action against your business, it is wise to have a lawyer who is already familiar with 
your business before a crisis arises. A lawyer experienced with your type of venture should also advise you on laws, programs, 
and agencies- - (federal, state, and local)- - that help small businesses through loans, grants, procurement set- asides, counseling, 
and other ways. He or she will tell you about unexpected legal opportunities and pitfalls that may affect your business.</p>
<p>In choosing a lawyer, experience and fee should be related. One lawyer may charge an hourly rate that, at first, looks cheaper 
than another lawyer's. However, because of a lack of experience in some area, the less expensive lawyer may charge a larger fee 
in the long run. Ask for a resume and check references. If you feel overwhelmed, take a trusted friend to the initial meeting to 
help you keep on track as you interview the lawyer about services and fees.</p>
<p>If you retain a law firm, be sure you understand who will work on your case and who will supervise the work. If junior lawyers 
handle your work, the fees should be lower. That's fine as long as you know an experienced attorney will be reviewing the case 
periodically.</p>
<p>Let your lawyer know that you expect to be informed of all developments and consulted before any decisions are made. You 
may also want to receive copies of all documents, letters, and memos written and received in your case or have a chance to read 
them in the lawyer's office.</p>
<p>Ask the attorney to estimate the timetable and costs of your work. You may wish to place a periodic ceiling on fees, after which 
he or she would call you before proceeding to do work that would add to your bill. Always have a written retainer agreement, 
describing just what you and the lawyer expect of each other.</p>
<p>Your Accountant</p>
<p>Most businesses fail not for lack of good ideas or good will, but rather for lack of financial expertise and planning. Look for an 
accountant as you would an attorney. Get referrals from trusted friends, business associations, or professional organizations. 
Discuss fees in advance and draw up a written agreement about how you will work together. Your accountant (along with your 
lawyer) can advise about initial business decisions, such as the form of the business. Your accountant will help set up your books, 
draw up and analyze profit and loss statements, advise on financial decisions (e.g., buying a computer), and give advice on cash 
requirements for your start- up phase. He or she can make budget forecasts, help prepare financial information for a loan 
application, and handle tax matters.</p>
<p>Accounting firms offer a variety of services. If this is not an easy area for you, the fees you pay will be well worth it. Most firms 
will maintain books of original entry, prepare bank reconciliation statements and post the general ledger, prepare balance sheets 
and income statements on a quarterly or semi- annual basis, and design and implement various accounting and recordkeeping 
systems.</p>
<p>They will also get your federal and state withholding numbers for you, give instructions on where and when to file tax returns, 
prepare tax returns, and do general tax planning for the small business person.</p>
<p>Your accountant is your key financial advisor. He or she should alert you to potential danger areas and advise you on how to 
handle growth spurts, how to best plan for slow business times, and how to financially nurture and protect your business future.</p>
<p>State and Federal Laws That May Apply to Your Business</p>
<p>Most localities have registration and licensing requirements that will apply to you. A license is a formal permission to practice a 
certain business activity, issued by a local, state, or federal government. You may have the type of business that requires a permit 
from the local authorities. There is often a small fee for licenses and permits (usually $15- 25). A license may require some kind 
of examination to certify that the recipient is qualified. Your business name must be registered and a sales tax number must be 
obtained. Separate business telephones and bank accounts are usually required. Of course, you will want to have the latter 
anyway for accurate bookkeeping purposes. If you have employees, you are responsible for withholding income and Social 
Security taxes. You must also pay worker's compensation and unemployment insurance and comply with minimum wage and 
employee health laws.</p>
<p>If your operations are intrastate, you will be concerned primarily with state and local, rather than federal, licensing. Businesses 
frequently subject to state or local control are retail food establishments, drinking places, barber shops, beauty shops, plumbing 
firms, and taxi companies. They are primarily service businesses and are subject to regulations for the protection of public health 
and morals. Your attorney can help you make sure you have complied with all licensing and permit requirements. Depending on 
your type of business you may have to comply with building and safety codes, too.</p>
<p>Think twice about the liabilities of operating without proper licenses and registrations. If you begin to advertise or are fortunate 
enough to &quot;make the news&quot; in some way, you will probably hear from a local official. You will pay with embarrassment, time, and 
money if your business is not properly licensed.</p>
<p>If you find legal regulations, permits, and licenses confusing, make sure you find some way to get the information you need to 
operate legally. Get help from your lawyer, accountant, business partner, or even your local librarian. This is not an aspect of 
business operations that can be delayed until you &quot;get around to it.&quot; Your business reputation and financial standing are at stake.</p>
<h4>5 Understanding the Financial Side</h4>
<p>Who Needs Financial Planning? You do! All businesses run on money for the purpose of making money. A major reason for 
business failure is the lack of financial planning. Although it is nearly impossible to make exact estimates, approximate ones will 
help. The very process of thinking through these financial questions will develop your business acumen and lead to solid planning. 
Get your accountant involved in reviewing your plans and advising you, too. </p>
<p>Estimating Start- Up Costs</p>
<p>Begin your financial planning by estimating your initial or start- up costs. Include all items of a nonrecurring nature such as fees, 
licenses, permits, franchise fees, insurance, telephone deposit, tools, equipment, office supplies, fixtures, installation of fixtures 
and equipment, remodeling and decorating, funds for your opening promotional event if you plan to have one, signs, and, of 
course, professional fees for your attorney and accountant. </p>
<p>Depending on your type of operation, the amount of money you invest, and the energy you expect to put in (part- time to full- 
time) can determine how much working capital you will need. Many business experts say if you expect a profit in six months, 
double that time and be ready to operate without profits for twelve months to give yourself a cushion in case of unanticipated 
expenses or delays. Study the growth patterns of other similar business and ask for advice from your accountant and attorney.</p>
<p>Projecting Operating Income and Expenses</p>
<p>Next, estimate the &quot;working&quot; capital you will need to keep operating for six to twelve months. Operating expenses include 
salaries; expenses for telephone, light, heat, office supplies, and other supplies or materials; debt interest; advertising fees; 
maintenance costs; taxes; legal and accounting fees; insurance fees; business membership fees; and special services expenses, 
such as secretarial, copying, and delivery service.</p>
<p>It is a good idea to obtain typical operating ratios for the kind of business in which you are interested. Among the sources for 
such ratios are Robert Morris Associates, Dun &amp; Bradstreet, Inc., the Accounting Corporation of America, trade associations, 
publishers of trade magazines, specialized accounting firms, industrial companies (for example, National Cash Register Co.), and 
colleges and universities. The typical ratios for your type of business combined with your estimated sales volume will serve as 
benchmarks for estimating the various items of expense. However, do not rely exclusively on this method for estimating each 
expense item. Modify these estimates through investigation and quotations in the particular market area where you plan to 
operate.</p>
<p>In addition to business operating capital, you will need to plan for reserve capital to cover personal expenses. This estimate will 
include all your normal living expenses, such as food, household expenses, car payments, rent or mortgage, clothing, medical 
expenses, entertainment, and taxes for you and your family.</p>
<p>After you have estimated start- up costs, working or operating capital needed for six to twelve months, and personal expenses 
and obligations, you may see that you need more start- up capital than you thought. What will you do? Discuss this with your 
accountant, attorney, and trusted business associates and family. Entrepreneurs secure needed capital in a variety of ways. You 
can:</p>
<pre>
   * Get loans or gifts from family members or friends. Make
     businesslike, written agreements and be sure to disclose
     fully the potential risk as well as the possible profit.
   * Apply for a bank loan. For this you will need a
     comprehensive statement of your personal financial
     condition and a business plan with financial projections
     to present to the loan officer. If you need help in
     preparing your loan application, take a course for small
     business people at a local community college or visit your
     nearest SBA office to get assistance from a SCORE
     counselor.
   * Apply for an SBA loan guarantee. The SBA is not a bank,
     but it does extend guarantees and may rarely participate
     in a loan when the bank is unable or unwilling to provide
     the entire financing itself. The SBA loan officer will ask
     you the same hard questions as a loan officer in a
     commercial bank and require the same carefully considered
     data on your personal finances, start- up costs, and
     business projections.

   * Search for some sort of venture capital. For start- up
     entrepreneurs some prior managerial or entrepreneurial
     track record is usually necessary in order to get venture
     capital. The main disadvantage of venture capital is that
     you will probably have to give up between 50 to 90 percent
     ownership of the new business in return for the capital. A
     home business is extremely unlikely to attract venture
     capital.</pre>
<p>Understanding Your Balance Sheet</p>
<p>Your Balance Sheet is a summary of the status of your business- - i.e., its assets, liabilities, and net worth- - at an instant in time. 
By reviewing your Balance Sheet along with the Profit and Loss Statement and Cash- Flow Statement, you will be able to make 
informed financial and business planning decision.</p>
<p>The Balance Sheet is drawn up using the totals from the individual accounts kept in your General Ledger. It shows what you 
have left when you pay all your creditors. Assets less liabilities equal capital or net worth. The assets and liabilities sections must 
balance- - hence the name Balance Sheet. It can be produced quarterly, semi- annually, or at the end of each calendar or fiscal 
year.</p>
<p>While your accountant will be most helpful in drawing up your Balance Sheet, it is you who must understand it. Current assets 
are anything of value you own such as cash, inventory, or property that the business owner can convert into cash within a year; 
fixed assets are things such as land and equipment. Liabilities are debts the business must pay. They may be current (such as 
amounts owed to suppliers or your accountant) or they may be long- term (such as notes owed to the bank). Capital (also called 
equity or net worth) is the excess of your assets over your liabilities.</p>
<p>Prepare a Balance Sheet for your new business during the planning phase to estimate its financial condition at that time and also a 
projected one for the first year of business. This will help you decide on the feasibility of your venture and make modifications to 
ensure profitability. You can also use these statements as part of the documentation in a loan application.</p>
<p>Understanding Your Profit and Loss Statement</p>
<p>Your Profit and Loss Statement is a detailed, month- by- month tally of the income from sales and the expenses incurred to 
generate the sales. It is a good assessment tool because it shows the effect of your decision on profit. It is a good planning tool 
because you can &quot;try out&quot; decisions on paper before actually going ahead.</p>
<p>The Profit and Loss Statement includes four kinds of information:</p>
<pre>
   * The Sales information lists the number of units sold and
     the total revenues generated by the sales.
   * The Direct Expenses category includes the cost of labor,
     materials, and manufacturing overhead (but not normal
     overhead).
   * Indirect Expenses are the costs you have even if the
     product is not produced or the service is not delivered.
     They include the fixed costs or normal overhead of
     salaries, rent, utilities. insurance, depreciation, office
     supplies, taxes, and professional fees for your lawyers
     and accountant.
   * Income or Profit is the last category on the Profit and
     Loss Statement. It is shown both as pre- tax and after- tax
     or net income. The IRS will look at your pre- tax figure,
     whereas your loan officer and you are more concerned with
     your after- tax figure.</pre>
<p>Your Profit and Loss Statement should be prepared at the very minimum once a year- - and more often in the beginning or 
growth stages of your business. It is a key document from which the economic health of a business can be determined. Make 
certain you do it properly and understand its meaning.</p>
<p>Understanding Your Cash Flow Statement</p>
<p>Your business must have a healthy cash flow to survive. Cash flow is the amount of money available in your business at any given 
time. To keep tabs on cash flow, forecast the funds you expect to disburse and receive over a given period of time. Then you 
can predict deficiencies or surplus in cash and decide how to respond.</p>
<p>A cash flow projection serves one other very useful purpose in addition to planning. As the actual information becomes available 
to you, compare it to the monthly cash flow estimates you previously made to see how accurately you are estimating. As you do 
this, you will be giving your self on- the- spot business training in making more accurate estimates and plans for the coming 
months. As your ability to estimate improves, your financial control of the business will increase.</p>
<p>The creative business owner works with his or her accountant to use the information gleaned from all of these financial tools to 
make a variety of managerial decisions- - decisions on buying supplies, expansion, when to hire more employees, how to get the 
best tax breaks, and many other important steps that will shape the future of the business.</p>
<h4>6 Make It Easy On Yourself</h4>
<p>Successful home- based business owners learn from experience- their own and that of others. In Jeffry A. Timmon's study of 
entrepreneurial personality characteristics (New Venture Creation: A Guide to Small Business Development), he notes that 
entrepreneurs are disappointed but not discouraged by failure. They use failures as learning experiences and try to understand 
their role in causing the failure in order to avoid similar problems in the future. Furthermore, Timmons asserts, entrepreneurs seek 
and use feedback on their performance in order to take corrective action and improve.</p>
<p>How to Learn From Experience</p>
<p>You can learn from experience in several ways:</p>
<p>First, work closely and creatively with professional advisors, such as your lawyer and your accountant. As you continually review 
your business records, you will see &quot;mistakes,&quot; but you will also begin to develop skill in planning and managing.</p>
<p>Second, continue to learn about all areas of business operations, constantly acquiring new ideas. Most community colleges have 
short, inexpensive, practical courses for business owners in topics like &quot;Financing a Small Business,&quot; &quot;Choosing a Small Business 
Computer,&quot; and &quot;Starting and Operating a Home- Based Business.&quot;</p>
<p>Third, get to know other business owners with similar needs or problems. Talking with others may be a way to avoid repeating 
the mistakes they have made and benefitting from their experience. Local and national organizations offer membership, social 
events, networking opportunities, newsletters, and seminars for home- based business owners. Through these organizations you 
can often advertise your product or service to other business owners. They also provide a way to learn about services you may 
need, such as accounting, public relations, or a responsible secretarial service. These organizations offer updates in such areas as 
taxes and zoning in their newsletters and workshops.</p>
<p>Finding and Using Resources, Networks, and Support Groups</p>
<p>Start out with the attitude &quot;Whatever my current business problem, I can find the solution. Somewhere there is information, a 
book, a person, an organization, or a government agency that can help.&quot; A word of warning though: finding resources and 
building networks can be very time- consuming. Joining organizations can turn out to be expensive, especially if you are too busy 
to use their services and support once you join. So use this list to organize your search for resources useful to you, then pick and 
choose carefully what you decide to read, join, buy, or attend:</p>
<p>Your Public Library: Visit your local library. Get to know its resources. In addition to books, many libraries offer free 
workshops, lend skill- building tapes, and become a central place to pick up catalogues and brochures describing continuing 
education opportunities for business owners. Ask the librarian for current copies of zoning regulations. Get familiar with new 
books and resources in your field (computers, health care, crafts, etc.) as well as in business skills (advertising techniques, 
financing, etc.) Look for magazines such as In Business, Black Enterprise, Venture, or The Journal of Small Business 
Management. Reading selectively is free. Subscribing to too many magazines may be expensive. </p>
<p>Organizations: A wide variety of local and national organizations have sprung up to serve the informational, lobbying, and 
networking needs of business entrepreneurs. Through meetings, services, or newsletters, groups such as the National Association 
of Women Business Owners, American Entrepreneurs Association, Business and Professional Women's Club, National Alliance 
of Home- based Businesswomen, and the National Association for Cottage Industry offer members everything from camaraderie 
to valuable &quot;perks,&quot; such as group rates on health insurance. David Gumpert's book, The Insider's Guide to Small Business 
Resources, has addresses of many of these groups and other information on such resources.</p>
<p>Government Resources: Contact your local or district office of the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) to learn about 
SBA services and publications. The SBA also offers free or inexpensive workshops and counseling through SCORE, SCORE is 
a volunteer program sponsored by the SBA through which retired executives who have management expertise are linked with 
owners/managers of small business or prospective entrepreneurs who need help.</p>
<p>The Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, Department of Defense (procurement), Department of Labor, IRS (ask 
for the free &quot;Business Tax Kit&quot;), Federal Trade Commission, and the Government Printing Office all have publications and 
services to inform and support you. Local and state government offices may also have services to help you. Addresses will be 
available in your telephone book, under U.S. Government, at your public library, or at the SBA office near you.</p>
<p>Community colleges: Most community colleges now have short, inexpensive, noncredit programs for entrepreneurs. The classes 
usually are convenient to business owners and are taught by experienced owners and managers.</p>
<p>As a home- based business person you can overcome feelings of isolation and give and receive valuable information if you tap 
into networks and resources. Being active in professional and trade associations will help to build a good marketing network for 
your service or product. Take the time and invest the money for memberships. Then continually evaluate which organizations and 
resources best serve your business information and networking needs.</p>
<p>Managing Time and Stress</p>
<p>Expect to encounter stress and time problems similar to those of other business owners but accentuated by the fact that you 
work at home. Follow these guidelines to make it a little easier on yourself:</p>
<p>1) Plan your time and establish priorities on a daily &quot;to do&quot; list. Decide what your &quot;prime time&quot; is and do your most important or 
difficult tasks then. Set &quot;business hours,&quot; specific times when you are at work and times when you turn on the answering machine 
because you are &quot;on duty but off call.&quot; You, your customers, and your family will appreciate knowing your set routine, even 
though you know that for special events or emergencies you can break that schedule.</p>
<p>2) Notice what your four or five big time- wasters are and learn techniques to eliminate them or compensate for them. Some 
common ones are: telephone interruptions, visitors, socializing, excessive paperwork, lack of policies and procedures, 
procrastination, failure to delegate, unclear objectives, poor scheduling, lack of self- discipline, and lack of skill in a needed area.</p>
<p>3) Stay in contact with people. Even though you prefer to work at home, you should plan work- related or social activities that 
provide frequent contact with others. This will help your morale if you feel isolated. Even for home- based business owners who 
like feeling isolated, keeping up with business and professional contacts is a must.</p>
<p>4) Build a fitness program into your day. Many successful entrepreneurs exercise in order to think creatively because physical 
activity sends oxygen to the brain and helps the mind function better. With regular exercise your health will improve, your stress 
level will go down, and your trim look will inspire people to have confidence in your abilities.</p>
<p>5) Give your home business as much of a separate and distinct physical identity as possible. Although you might save a few 
dollars by using the ironing board as a bookshelf and a cardboard box as a file cabinet, the stress and strain of operating without 
proper space and supplies will take its toll. Have a separate room or area for your business, with a separate entrance if 
customers or suppliers visit. Consider soundproofing so your family won't be bothered by your noise and vice versa. (In addition 
to the psychological and physical comfort of having a separate office, the IRS requires it in order for you to make a legitimate 
claim for tax deductions.)</p>
<p>6) Take care of your major business asset: YOU. Being the boss can be exciting, fulfilling, and rewarding. It can also be lonely, 
stressful, and demanding. Learn to balance your professional and personal life. Go on vacation. Get a weekly massage. Join a 
health club. Take a class in meditation. Attend a business owner's breakfast club. Your business depends on you to be at your 
best.</p>
<p>Profile: Jeanette's Day- Care Center</p>
<p>Jeanette wanted to return to work when her two children started school. Since her degree was in child psychology, she applied 
for a job as an assistant at a neighborhood day- care center. When she heard the salary, she decided there must be a better way. 
After several months of planning and researching, she decided to open her own day- care center in her basement recreation 
room. With remodeling she could accommodate the children and meet the zoning and licensing regulations. Four years later, her 
center has an excellent reputation and a long waiting list. She likes being &quot;at home&quot; and working in the business half- days while 
attending school for a graduate degree in business administration.</p>
<p>Profile: Wallflowers, A Wallpapering Partnership</p>
<p>Thirteen years ago Jane and Rachel bought a van together and formed &quot;Wallflowers,&quot; a wallpapering and painting business. 
When they started, Rachel was recently divorced and wanted to test her entrepreneurial wings. She had quite a reputation with 
her friends for doing beautiful wallpapering and was often asked by them to help out on weekend remodeling jobs. Jane had little 
wall- papering experience but had handled all the accounting for her uncle's contracting firm and knew local suppliers and 
business owners. </p>
<p>They have never had to advertise. Word- of- mouth referrals have kept them busy ten months of the year. They close for two 
months in the summer so Jane can be with her kids and Rachel can go to Maine. Jane likes working &quot;around&quot; her family; if a child 
is sick or has a school program she'd like to attend, she doesn't have to apply for leave or fear losing her job. Her clients, mostly 
family- oriented people such as herself, understand that her children come first and the job will get done.</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Service Contracts -- April 1992</h2>
<p>If you are buying a car or major appliance, you may be offered a service contract. To many consumers, buying a service contract 
is like buying &quot;peace of mind&quot; from repair hassles. An estimated 50% of all new car buyers, and many used-car and major 
appliance buyers, purchase service contracts. The cost can range from $50 to $500, depending on the length and amount of 
coverage provided. Some consumers, however, may be paying for more protection than they need.</p>
<p>Before you buy a service contract, consider the following:</p>
<h4>What does the service contract offer?</h4>
<p>A service contract, like a warranty, provides repair and/or maintenance for a specific time period. Warranties, however, are 
included in the price of the product, while service contracts cost extra and are sold separately.</p>
<h4>What is covered by the service contract?</h4>
<p>A service contract may cover only certain parts of the product or specific repairs. Read the contract carefully and, if it does not 
list something as specifically covered, assume that it is not. Service contracts do not cover repairs resulting from misuse or failure 
to maintain the product properly. Also, you may be obligated to take certain action, such as notifying the company of problems, 
to insure the service contract is not voided.</p>
<h4>What will the service contract give you that the warranty will not?</h4>
<p>Before considering a service contract, make sure you know what your warranty coverage is. Carefully compare the coverage of 
your warranty to the coverage offered by the service contract to decide if the service contract is worth the additional expense. 
For more information about warranties, send for Warranties, a free brochure from the Federal Trade Commission, by writing to: 
Public Reference, Federal Trade Commission, Washington, D.C. 20580. You also may write to this address to receive a free 
copy of Best Sellers, a listing of all the FTC's consumer publications.</p>
<h4>Is the product likely to need repairs?</h4>
<p>You may not benefit from a service contract if the product is unlikely to need servicing or if the potential cost of repairs is very 
low.</p>
<h4>What other costs will you have?</h4>
<p>You may have other expenses after you buy a service contract. Service contracts, like insurance policies, often have deductible 
amounts. Or, you may be charged each time the item is serviced. Some expenses are limited or excluded. For example, auto 
service contracts may not completely cover towing or rental car expenses. In addition, you may have to pay cancellation or 
transfer fees if you sell the covered product or wish to end the contract.</p>
<h4>Where can you get service?</h4>
<p>If the service contract is offered by a local retailer or dealer, you may only be able to get local service. Consider the possibility 
that problems may develop while you are traveling or after you move away from the area.</p>
<h4>Who is responsible for the contract?</h4>
<p>The Federal Trade Commission often gets letters from consumers who ask what they can do about a service contract company 
that has gone out of business and cannot repay claims. Unfortunately, there is little recourse available to these consumers. The 
best way to avoid this situation is to consider, before you sign a contract, whether the company is reputable. Ask your local or 
state consumer protection office, Better Business Bureau, or state insurance commission if they have any complaints against the 
company.</p>
<h4>Can you purchase a service contract later?</h4>
<p>You may be better able to decide if you need a service contract after you have owned the product for some time. Consider 
waiting until your warranty period expires to buy a service contract. Although the Federal Trade Commission cannot represent 
you directly in a dispute with a company, it wants to know if companies are not meeting their service contract obligations.</p>
<p>Send your complaint to: Correspondence Branch, Federal Trade Commission, Washington, D.C. </p>
<p>20580.</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Shopping by Phone or Mail -- March 1994</h2>
<p>Produced in cooperation with the Direct Marketing Association and the American Association of Retired Persons</p>
<p>Shopping by telephone or mail is often a convenient alternative to shopping at a store. When you shop by phone or mail, you 
should know how you're protected by law.</p>
<p>The Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) new Mail or Telephone Order Rule covers goods you order by mail, telephone, 
computer, and fax machine. If you pay by credit card, you also get protection under the Fair Credit Billing Act (FCBA).</p>
<h4>Mail or Telephone Order Rule</h4>
<p>By law, a company should ship your order within the time stated in its ads. If no time is promised, the company should ship your 
order within 30 days after receiving it.</p>
<p>If the company is unable to ship within the promised time, the company must give you an &quot;option notice.&quot; This notice gives you 
the choice of agreeing to the delay or canceling your order and receiving a prompt refund.</p>
<p>There is one exception to the 30-day Rule. If a company doesn't promise a shipping time, and you are applying for credit to pay 
for your purchase, the company has 50 days after receiving your order to ship.</p>
<h4>Fair Credit Billing Act (FCBA)</h4>
<p>When you use your credit card to pay for purchases, whether by phone, mail, or in the store, you are protected by the FCBA.</p>
<h4>Billing Errors</h4>
<p>If you find a billing error on your monthly credit or charge card statement, you may dispute the charge and withhold payment on 
the disputed amount during the dispute period. The error might be a charge for the wrong amount, or for something you did not 
accept or was not delivered as agreed.</p>
<p>If you decide to dispute the charge, follow the steps below. Of course, you still must pay for any part of the bill that is not 
disputed, including finance charges on the undisputed amount. To be protected by the FCBA, you must:</p>
<p>Write to the creditor at the special address indicated on the monthly statement for &quot;billing inquiries.&quot; Include your name, address, 
and credit card number, and describe the billing error.</p>
<p>Send your letter soon. It must reach the creditor within 60 days after the first bill containing the error was mailed to you.</p>
<p>The creditor must acknowledge your complaint in writing within 30 days after receiving it, unless the problem has been resolved. 
The creditor must resolve the dispute within two billing cycles (but not more than 90 days) after receiving your letter.</p>
<h4>Unsatisfactory goods or services</h4>
<p>If you bought an unsatisfactory product, you also may dispute the charge for that product and withhold payment on the disputed 
amount during the dispute period. Again, you must pay for any part of the bill that is not disputed, including finance charges on 
the undisputed amount. To take advantage of this protection regarding the quality of goods, you must:</p>
<p>Have bought the item in your home state or within 100 miles of your current billing address. The amount charged must be more 
than $50.</p>
<p>Make a good faith effort first to resolve the dispute with the seller. You are not required to use any special procedure.</p>
<p>There are certain exceptions to this protection. The dollar and distance limitations don't apply if the seller is also the card issuer 
or if a special business relationship exists between the seller and card issuer.</p>
<h4>Precautions</h4>
<p>Before ordering by phone or mail, consider your experience with the company or its general reputation. Determine the 
company's refund and return policies, the product's availability, and the total cost of your order.</p>
<h4>Contacts for Resolving Problems</h4>
<p>If you have problems with mail or phone order purchases, first try to resolve your dispute with the company. If that doesn't 
work, the following resources may be helpful.</p>
<p>The Better Business Bureau (BBB). Contact the BBB in your area or near the company.</p>
<p>State and local consumer protection offices. Contact the offices near you and near the company.</p>
<p>Action-line and consumer reporters. Check with your local newspaper, TV, and radio stations for a contact.</p>
<p>The Direct Marketing Association (DMA). Write: DMA Mail Order Action Line, 1101 17th Street, NW, Washington, DC 
20036</p>
<p>Postal Inspectors. Call your local post office and ask for the Inspector-in-Charge.</p>
<p>You may want to have your name removed from direct mail or telephone lists. Be aware, however, that if you purchase goods 
by mail after your name is removed, it may be added again. You may want to make a new request to have your name removed 
every few years. You also may want to ask mail or telephone order companies to retain your name on in-house lists only.</p>
<p>To remove your name from many national direct mail lists, write:</p>
<p>DMA Mail Preference Service P.O. Box 9008 Farmingdale, NY 11735-9008</p>
<p>To avoid unwanted telephone sales calls from many national marketers, send your name, address, and telephone number to:</p>
<p>DMA Telephone Preference Service P.O. Box 9014 Farmingdale, NY 11735-9014</p>
<h4>For More Information</h4>
<p>To learn more about your credit billing rights, send for the FTC's free brochure Fair Credit Billing or Best Sellers, which lists 
more than 100 free publications on credit and other consumer topics. Contact: Public Reference, Federal Trade Commission, 
Washington, DC 20580; 202-326-2222. TDD: 202-326-2502.</p>
<p>If you have complaints about mail or telephone order companies, write: Division of Enforcement, Federal Trade Commission, 
Washington, DC 20580. Although the FTC does not usually resolve individual disputes, your comments can be useful in its law 
enforcement efforts.</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Smart Buying for Young Consumers -- November 1993</h2>
<p>Whether you are trying to stretch your allowance or your paycheck, you will find that smart buying can help you hang on to more 
of your money. One place to start learning how to buy smart is to find out what protection consumer laws offer. Those laws may 
be Federal, state, or local.</p>
<p>This brochure explains some Federal laws that are enforced by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). It tells you about some 
products you might be inclined to buy and about smart ways to buy them. More information about the topics described below is 
provided in individual FTC brochures, which you can receive free by writing to the address given at the end of this publication. 
Other Federal, state, and local agencies also enforce consumer protection laws and offer consumer assistance. Those resources 
are listed at the end of this brochure.</p>
<h4>How Consumer Laws Can Help You Buy Smart</h4>
<p>Knowing your legal rights can give you power in the marketplace. This brochure gives you some tips about how to buy things. 
For example, it includes suggestions about buying a used car (which may be the most expensive decision you've ever had to 
make). It also contains tips for understanding clothing care labels, shopping by mail, and protecting yourself against mail and 
telephone fraud. In addition, the brochure offers you advice about how to comparison shop for warranties on your major 
purchases and how to understand credit laws. Finally, the publication covers several health topics, such as the Eyeglasses 
Prescription Release Rule, indoor tanning claims, buying a sunscreen, and separating fact from fiction about health-care and 
beauty products.</p>
<h4>Buying a Used Car</h4>
<p>If you intend to buy a used car from a dealer, not a private party, look for the &quot;Buyers Guide&quot; sticker on the window of each 
used car. The Buyers Guide, which the FTC's Used Car Rule requires dealers to put on their cars, will give you important 
information and suggestions about making the purchase. For example, the Buyers Guide will tell you:</p>
<p>Whether the car comes with a warranty and, if so, what the warranty covers and for how long</p>
<p>That you should have the car inspected by an independent mechanic before you buy</p>
<p>That you should get all promises in writing and</p>
<p>What major problem areas to look for that are common to all cars.</p>
<p>Before you buy a used car or a new car, you can get some smart buying tips by reading the FTC's car brochures suggested on 
page 8.</p>
<h4>Buying Clothes</h4>
<p>When you shop for clothes, read the care labels before you buy. Then you will know how to care for the clothes and will 
understand what that care may cost you. The FTC's Care Labeling Rule requires that most textile clothing must have a care label 
attached. These labels must give at least one satisfactory method of care and also must give a warning if any particular cleaning 
method would harm the garment or if no cleaning method is safe. For further information about care labels and your clothes, 
write for the free FTC brochure noted on page 8.</p>
<h4>Buying By Mail</h4>
<p>When you buy by mail, that is, when you use the mail to place your order or to make your payment, your purchase will be 
covered by the FTC's Mail Order Rule. The Rule requires mail-order companies to ship your order within the time period they 
advertise. If the company cannot ship as promised, it must offer you an option to cancel the order and to receive your money 
back. If no time period is advertised, most merchandise must be shipped within 30 days.</p>
<p>In September 1993, the FTC amended the Rule to include telephone orders. The amendments become effective March 1, 1994. 
Until then, the current Rule, which applies only to mail order sales, remains in effect.</p>
<p>Remember, when ordering by mail, you are sending payment to a company you may not know, for something you have not seen. 
Therefore, before you buy, it's smart to find out something about the company, if you can, and to ask about its return policy by 
calling its toll-free 800 number, if one's available. In addition, read the item descriptions; don't just rely on pictures. It's also smart 
to keep notes about what you ordered, the date, the order number, and the company's name, address, and telephone number. 
Later, if you have any problems about your order, that information may be useful.To learn more about shopping by mail and 
phone, send for the free FTC brochures listed on the last page.</p>
<h4>Telefraud and Mail Fraud</h4>
<p>When your telephone rings and the caller offers you a &quot;free,&quot; &quot;prepaid,&quot; or &quot;special deal&quot; on a vacation, beauty aid, magazine 
subscription, or anything else, be careful. Do not give out any personal information over the phone about you or your family, 
especially the ID numbers of your credit card or bank account. Also, a hurried &quot;yes&quot; to the caller may obligate you or your family 
to pay for nonexistent, overpriced, or unwanted products. Of course, not all telephone offers involve fraud, so you may want to 
ask callers to contact you by mail, so you can see the offer in writing.</p>
<p>In addition to telephone fraud, some mail offers also may be deceptive and fraudulent. For example, you may get a notice that 
you won a prize -- a diamond ring or a trip. Before you pay a fee or spend time driving to get your prize, be sure it is worth 
winning. The &quot;diamond&quot; you won might be the size of a pin-head and the vacation award may include only discount coupons for 
inexpensive lodging. You can learn more about telephone and mail-order fraud by getting the FTC's free brochures. See page 8.</p>
<h4>Warranties</h4>
<p>Before you make a major purchase, it's smart to read what warranty protection the product manufacturer offers you. So, just as 
you compare the style and price of products before you buy, you also can compare warranties. The Magnuson-Moss Act of 
l975, which the FTC enforces, requires companies that offer warranties to make those warranties available to you before you 
make a purchase. The warranties must provide information that clearly states what product parts are covered, for how long, who 
pays for repairs, and whom to contact to obtain warranty service. For more details about warranty protection, see page 8 to 
order the free FTC brochure.</p>
<h4>Credit Laws</h4>
<p>You may be able to get your first credit card with your name on it through your parents. With that credit card comes 
responsibility, but also protection under the consumer credit laws. You may have some questions, such as: If there's a mistake on 
my credit card bill, what should I do? If my credit card is stolen, whom should I call? If I pay some bills late, will it be on my 
credit record? To get answers to these and other credit questions, send for the FTC's free credit brochures.</p>
<h4>Eyeglass Prescription Release Rule</h4>
<p>Eyeglasses. Under this FTC Rule, you have a legal right to your eyeglass prescription, at no extra cost, immediately after an eye 
exam. So request the prescription if it is not provided. With prescription in hand, you can shop for eyeglasses just as you would 
for any other product and service, looking for the best quality at the best price.</p>
<p>Contact lenses. Although not required by federal law, many eye care specialist will give you a copy of your contact lens 
specifications. In fact, some states require it. It is essential to have a copy of these specifications if you want to buy your contact 
lenses, replacements or duplicate lenses from a different specialist. Otherwise, you may have to pay for another fitting exam.To

<h4>Indoor Tanning</h4>
<p>You may have heard claims like &quot;Tan indoors with absolutely no harmful side effects&quot; and wonder whether indoor tanning 
devices are safe. Whether you tan outdoors in natural sunlight or indoors in a tanning parlor, tanning is not risk-free. You are 
increasing your chances of: developing skin cancer later in life; suffering cataracts and retinal damage; and developing premature 
skin wrinkling. If you have questions about possible side effects associated with tanning, check with your doctor or nurse and 
write for the free FTC brochure.</p>
<h4>Sunscreens</h4>
<p>When you buy a sunscreen, you will get the greatest benefit from a sunscreen with a high sun protection factor (SPF) number, 
such as 15 or greater. The SPF number gives you some idea how long you can remain in the sun before burning. If, for example, 
you would normally burn in 10 minutes without sunscreen, applying a 15 SPF sunscreen may provide you with about 150 
minutes in the sun before burning. Swimming and perspiration, however, will reduce the actual SPF value for many sunscreens.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, even sunscreens with high SPF numbers offer you less than full protection. Sunlight exposes you to two kinds of 
ultraviolet light, called UVA and UVB. Both can cause skin damage, including wrinkling and skin cancer. Although virtually all 
sunscreens provide some level of protection against UVB rays, no product yet screens out all UVA rays. SPF sunscreen 
numbers indicate sunburn protection from UVB rays only. So, even if you use high SPF number sunscreens, your skin still can be 
damaged from the sun's UVA rays. For more information about sunscreens, send for the free FTC brochure.</p>
<h4>Health and Beauty Products</h4>
<p>Unfortunately, fraudulent promoters of health-care and beauty products often thrive on the wishful thinking of those who want 
short-cuts to weight loss, beautiful bodies, or other appearance improvements. There are ways to tell which health and beauty 
aid products are legitimate and which are not smart buys. Learn to recognize worthless products by the typical phrases 
advertisers use to promote them.</p>
<p>Does the product promise &quot;a quick and easy fix&quot;?</p>
<p>Does the ad use key words such as miraculous, exclusive, secret, or ancient?</p>
<p>Does the ad mention undocumented case histories that sound too good to be true?</p>
<p>Also remember some basic facts:</p>
<p>If you want to lose weight, lower your calories intake and/or increase your calorie use by exercise. Claims that you can eat 
everything you want and lose weight effortlessly are not true.</p>
<p>If you want to lose weight and tone up as well, exercise. Without exercise, fat cells, called &quot;cellulite&quot; by some advertisements, do 
not shrivel up.</p>
<p>No amount of rubbing, wrapping, massaging, or scrubbing will get rid of &quot;cellulite&quot; (or increase your biceps or your bust size).</p>
<h4>Where to Find More Information</h4>
<p>There are many places where you can get consumer information, ask questions, or make complaints. However, before sending 
your complaint to a Federal, state, or local consumer protection agency or the Better Business Bureau, always try to resolve 
complaints with the company first.</p>
<p>To locate Federal, state, and local consumer protection agencies, national consumer organizations, local Better Business 
Bureaus, trade associations, and many companies, send for the Consumer's Resource Handbook, published by the U.S. Office 
of Consumer Affairs. It is available free from the Consumer Information Center, Pueblo, Colorado 81009. You also can get 
telephone numbers for your state and local consumer protection offices or local Better Business Bureau by looking in your 
telephone directory or by asking your librarian.</p>

<h2>STRIPPING PAINT FROM WOOD</h2>
<h4>MATERIALS YOU'LL NEED</h4>
<h4>Protective Equipment</h4>
<p>1. Safety goggles (completely covering the eye).</p>
<p>2. Rubber gloves (not the dish-washing kind) that are chemical&#169;resistant, such as neoprene or butyl.</p>
<p>3. Clothing that covers all skin: long-sleeved shirts, pants, socks, and shoes. If working at eye-level or above, wear a cap or hat.</p>
<h4>Materials to do the Job</h4>
<p>1. Paint Brushes. An old, wide brush will do. Use a natural-bristle brush, as synthetic bristles will deteriorate rapidly.</p>
<p>2. Scraper. A dull, flexible-blade putty knife is usually best. If necessary, dull both the cutting edge and the corners of the blade 
with a metal file; otherwise, you might gouge the wood.</p>
<p>3. Toothbrush, ice pick, cotton swabs. These come in handy for getting into tiny crevices or when working with intricate designs 
in the wood.</p>
<p>4. Steel Wool pads (#2). Helpful for removing the stripper or old finish from pores in opengrained woods such as walnut, oak, 
or mahogany. Also, use to prepare the surface for a new finish.</p>
<p>5. Metal cans. Large coffee cans are good both for holding the paint remover while work is in process, and for collecting the 
waste (sludge) when the work is done. Whatever type of metal container you use, make sure it has a securely fitting lid.</p>
<p>6. Burlap, twine, or coarse string. Handy for removing sludge from leg turnings (using shoe shine or back-and-forth rubbing 
motion).</p>
<p>7. Stiff-bristle scrub brush. Useful for removing old finish in places inaccessible to a scraper.</p>
<p>8. Disposable pie pans or some other suitable container. Place under legs of furniture to catch drippings.</p>
<p>9. Dropcloth, newspapers, cardboard, and old rags. Try to gather as much material as possible to catch drippings and sludge to 
protect the surface underneath the work. Paint removers can damage linoleum, asphalt, plastic, and vinyl.</p>
<h4>COVERAGE</h4>
<p>The amount of paint remover you will need depends on what you are stripping and how many coats of old surface must be 
removed. As a general rule, however, you can figure that one gallon of remover will strip 75 to 100 square feet. Thus, for a chair 
or small end table with a clear finish on it, you will need about one quart. Stripping a dining room table with a clear finish will 
probably require two quarts. Buy only what you will use to avoid storing paint-removing chemicals in the home.</p>
<h4>WORK SITE AND SETUP</h4>
<p>The single most important consideration in selecting a work site is the availability of fresh air. The best location is outdoors, 
preferably in a shaded area, a carport, or under some type of cover to shield the work from the sun. The sun unduly speeds up 
the evaporation of the remover. A garage with windows and doors on two sides to create adequate cross ventilation also can be 
used. Avoid working indoors if at all possible.</p>
<p>If you must work indoors, open all windows and, if possible, all doors to achieve a strong flow of fresh air through the work 
area. It is advisable to use forced ventilation (fan) to improve the flow of fresh air. Because some removers are flammable, 
however. be sure to read the instructions on the label before using forced ventilation (fan) as the friction between metal parts may 
spark and ignite the vapors. The label is the key. It will advise you on proper ventilation.</p>
<p>Do not allow children to play in the wet area to avoid exposure to paint-removing chemicals.</p>
<p>Some physical symptoms that indicate overexposure are eye irritation, dizziness, light-headedness, and/or headache. As soon as 
you experience any of these, take a break and get some fresh air. Do not resume the project until you have increased the 
ventilation through the work area. For your comfort and safety, take fresh-air breaks frequently and leave the work site 
whenever you are not actually applying or removing stripper.</p>
<p>when setting up your work area, it is a good idea to elevate the work by using sawhorses or some equally sturdy support, This 
accomplishes two things: first, by having the work slightly above waist level, you will reduce the chance of getting a backache that 
often comes from prolonged bending; second, for best results, the work should not touch the floor.</p>
<h4>THE PROCEDURE</h4>
<p>1. For best results work in warm weather. A good working temperature range is from 65 to 85 degrees. As mentioned earlier, 
try to work in the shade even if it means moving the work as the sun moves.</p>
<p>2. Remove as much hardware as possible from the piece. Use masking tape to cover any hardware that can't be removed. You 
may even want to polish handles, rings, or other ornamental hardware while you're waiting for the remover to do its work.</p>
<p>3. Wear chemical-resistant gloves and safety goggles to avoid contact with the skin and eyes. Chemicals in paint removers can 
be painful and irritating if splashed into the eyes or onto the skin.</p>
<p>4. When you're ready to use the paint remover, STOP! Read the entire label before opening the container. Some removers 
should be handshaken before use. Cover the container with a cloth and open the cap slowly to allow for the gradual release of 
pressure buildup.</p>
<p>5. Carefully pour the remover into one of the metal cans you have collected. Replace the container cap tightly each time you pour 
some remover. Store the container in a cool place when not in use. Dip your brush into the metal can and bring out a generous 
helping of remover.</p>
<p>6. Don't apply the remover as you would paint. In fact, don't &quot;brush&quot; on the remover in the usual sense; rather, &quot;lay&quot; it on in much 
the same way as you would ice a cake. Working in one direction, preferably on a flat surface, apply the remover to an area of 
about two square feet at a time. If you are working on a vertical surface, such as a table leg, start at the top and work down. In 
about five minutes you will see the remover working--the surface will begin to peel and blister.</p>
<p>[Graphic Omitted]</p>
<p>7. You will have to wait while the remover is working. The time required for the stripper to remove the old finish varies among 
products. The label will specify the time required, but generally it is from 15 to 20 minutes. As the stripper penetrates the old 
finish, it forms airtight &quot;layers.&quot; If you try to rush the scraper, the result will be a sticky goo that is next to impossible to remove.</p>
<p>8. While the remover is working, bide your time. Get some fresh air, away from the worksite, to reduce your exposure to the 
paint-removing chemicals.</p>
<p>9. When the remover has done its work, it's time to remove the resulting sludge. A gentle scraping with a dull putty knife will take 
the residue right off. Scrape away from you, and go with the grain to minimize the effect of any scratches made with the blade. 
On carved or grooved surfaces, a toothpick, coarse twine, or old toothbrush can greatly aid the removal process. Wipe off your 
tools frequently on newspaper.</p>
<p>[Graphic Omitted]</p>
<p>10. The first section or two will be a trial-and-error process until you determine how many coats of paint you are trying to 
remove. The object is to remove all the old finish from one section at a time. On very old furniture with many coats of paint, 
several soak-and-scrape operations may be required. Wait the full time for each layer you add, and be equally generous with 
each successive coat. As you are probably beginning to realize, stripping isn't hard at all, but it does take patience.</p>
<p>11. As you remove the paint, wrap the residue in plenty of newspaper and place outdoors, in the open air, so the remover will 
evaporate completely before sealing all materials in one of the clean metal containers for disposal (more on this later). After 
removing the bulk of the sludge from the piece, use the old rags or burlap to wipe away any remaining residue. Place these 
outdoors as well.</p>
<p>[Graphic Omitted]</p>
<p>12. All traces of the stripper must be removed for the new finish to adhere properly. To remove the last residue of stripper or old 
finish it will be necessary to wipe the piece with a rag, stiff-bristle scrub brush, or steel wool pad, rubbing with the grain. This is 
especially true for open-grained woods like walnut, oak, or mahogany. Allow the piece to dry overnight before continuing with 
the refinishing.</p>
<h4>CLEANUP AND DISPOSAL</h4>
<p>As you finish a section, wrap the remover/old finish in a thick fold of newspaper and place outdoors, where the liquid will 
evaporate more quickly. After each work session, place all other papers, rags, applicators, and waste (old-finish residue) 
outdoors. Be sure to collect all of the residue, as the old paint may contain toxic materials.</p>
<p>When the liquid has evaporated (it typically evaporates very fast), place all these materials into a metal container that has a 
secure lid. You can then dispose of the material according to local waste disposal requirements. Contact your local sanitation 
department or waste disposal contractor for more information.</p>
<h4>SAFETY FIRST</h4>
<p>Preparing furniture for a new finish should be a rewarding experience. Knowing the proper use of chemical paint remover, and 
how to avoid potentially adverse effects from overexposure, will make the experience that much more enjoyable. Moreover, the 
confidence that comes from such knowledge will no doubt have a positive effect upon the quality of your work. Below are 
general discussions related to short-term (acute) and long-term (chronic) health effects pertaining to the use of chemical paint 
removers. Last, a summary is given of safety guidelines that you should consult before and during your refinishing project. Any 
potential health risk from exposure to paint removing chemicals depends on the amount and duration of exposure.</p>
<h4>Short-term (Acute) Health Effects</h4>
<p>Exposure to high levels of paint removers over short periods of time can cause irritation to the skin, eyes, mucous membranes, 
and respiratory tract. Other symptoms of high exposure are dizziness, headache, and lack of coordination. The occurrence of 
any of these symptoms indicates that you are being exposed to an excessive amount of the substance. At the onset of any of 
these symptoms, you should leave the work area and get some fresh air. Do not resume the project until you have increased the 
ventilation through the work area.</p>
<p>A portion of inhaled methylene chloride in paint stripper is converted by the body to carbon monoxide, which can lower the 
blood's ability to carry oxygen. When the solvent is used properly, however, the levels of carbon monoxide should not be 
hazardous. Individuals with cardiovascular or pulmonary health problems should check with their physician prior to use of the 
paint stripper. Individuals experiencing severe symptoms such as shortness of breath or chest pains should obtain proper medical 
care immediately.</p>
<h4>Long-term (Chronic) Health Effects</h4>
<p>Methylene chloride has been shown to cause cancer in certain laboratory animal tests. The available human studies do not 
provide the necessary information to determine whether methylene chloride causes cancer in humans. However, as a result of the 
animal studies, methylene chloride is considered a possible human carcinogen. It is prudent to minimize exposure to solvent 
vapors.</p>
<h4>HEALTH HAZARD</h4>
<p>Paint removers contain chemicals that may be harmful if misused. Always use in well-ventilated areas. Read and observe all 
cautions and directions on the individual container. Keep Out of Reach of Children.</p>
<p>Depending on the composition of the paint remover you are using, the Consumer Product Safety Commission requires labeling 
cautions similar to the following wording:</p>
<p><strong>DANGER: FLAMMABLE CAUTION: HARMFUL OR FATAL IF SWALLOWED.</strong><br>
<strong>Skin and Eye Irritant.</strong></p>
<p><strong>CAUTION: Vapor Harmful. Read Other Cautions and HEALTH HAZARD INFORMATION on Back Panel.</strong></p>
<p>Contains methylene chloride, which has been shown to cause cancer in certain laboratory animals. Risk to your health depends 
on level and duration of exposure.</p>
<p>Use this product outdoors, if possible. If you must use it indoors, open all windows and doors or use other means to ensure fresh 
air movement during application and drying. Do not use in basement or other unventilated areas.</p>
<p>Open container carefully and close after each use. Clean up rags, papers, and waste promptly. Allow solvent to evaporate, then 
dispose of in metal containers.</p>
<p>The label also will include information on the first aid measures to be taken in the event of ingestion.</p>
<p>Do-it-yourselfers often put off restoring furniture or other woodwork for one reason: they simply don't know the ins and outs of 
the first step--removing the old finish. This brochure will show you step-by-step how to remove old finishes, from the materials 
you'll need to get started to tips on how to use paint remover safely.</p>
<p>So read on, and in a matter of a few minutes you'll know all you need to know to restore that prized piece of furniture to its 
original beauty.</p>
<h4>WHAT IS PAINT REMOVER?</h4>
<p>Paint removers, or strippers, are not merely one chemical, but a combination of them, each with a specific job to do. This 
brochure provides information on solvent-based removers, those that use chemical solvents to remove the old finish.</p>
<p>Solvent-based strippers come in two forms: liquid and semi-paste. In general, the liquid works faster. The semi-paste is best for 
all-around work, however, because it doesn't run and drip when applied to vertical surfaces as the liquid tends to do. The active 
ingredient in many solvent-based strippers is a chemical called methylene chloride. Methylene chloride is present in the paint 
remover to penetrate, blister, and finally lift the old finish. Other chemicals in paint removers work to accelerate the stripping 
process, to retard evaporation, and to act as thickening agents.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that any chemical or combination of chemicals with the potency to lift off old paint should be treated with 
respect in terms of safety. So, while solvent-based strippers work fast and are harmless to wood, they may pose health hazards 
to humans and should be used in strict accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. A complete discussion of safety and 
health-risk issues follows the &quot;how-to&quot; section of this brochure. No brochure, article, or book can take the place of The 
manufacturer's recommended use of any product. There are simply too many aspects to consider. It is vital, therefore, to read 
individual product labels and to follow them exactly.</p>
<h4>SAFETY RULES</h4>
<p>1. Read carefully and familiarize yourself with the safety precautions printed on the manufacturer's label. Refer to it periodically 
during the project.</p>
<p>2. Provide maximum fresh air flow through the work area. Avoid inhaling solvent vapors.</p>
<p>3. Wear safety goggles while handling the remover. If any remover gets into the eyes, wash with water. Keep your eyelids open, 
even if you have to hold them open with your fingers. (Keeping the eyelids open allows air in to evaporate the substance). If 
burning sensation persists after about ten minutes, see a physician.</p>
<p>4. Cover all skin areas: wear chemical-resistant rubber gloves made of neoprene or butyl. Also wear long-sleeved shirt, pants, 
socks, shoes, and a hat or cap (especially if you're working at or above eye level). If any of the remover gets on the skin, wash 
off with soap and water.</p>
<p>5. Avoid smoking or working in an area where there is a possibility of sparks or flames.</p>
<p>6. When you first open a container of remover, cover it with a cloth and open the cap slowly to allow the gases to escape 
gradually. Pour enough remover for your immediate working needs into a metal can and replace the cap tightly. Repeat this 
procedure each time you reopen the container. Store the container in a cool place when not in use.</p>
<p>7. Do not store unused paint remover around the house. Buy only what you need.</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Sweepstakes Scams: When &quot;Winners&quot; Lose Money -- September 1993</h2>
<p>If someone calls to say that you've won a trip or valuable prize in a major sweepstakes, it may sound like a dream come true. 
But listen carefully.</p>
<p>If you're told to send money immediately to collect the prize, don't do it. Instead of winning something, the Federal Trade 
Commission (FTC) warns that you could lose hundreds of dollars. This brochure explains how you can tell whether you truly are 
a sweepstakes winner or the target of a scam.</p>
<h4>Recognizing a Scam</h4>
<p>In recent months, fraudulent telemarketers have been posing as representatives of the major sweepstakes, such as American 
Family Publishers, Publishers Clearing House, and Reader's Digest. If you become a target, you may receive an official-looking 
letter that instructs you to call an '800' number. Or, you may receive an unexpected phone call.</p>
<p>You may think the notification means you've won a prize, especially if you've already entered one or more sweepstakes. 
However, watch out if you're told to:</p>
<p>Pay money upfront</p>
<p>You may be asked to send several hundred dollars -- by overnight delivery services or Western Union -- to &quot;prepay taxes,&quot; 
make a &quot;refundable&quot; deposit, or cover shipping and handling costs. This is a clue to a questionable offer. With legitimate 
sweepstakes, you do not have to pay anything to collect your prize. If you have won merchandise, like a necklace or car, the 
sweepstakes promoter will pay the delivery charges. If you win cash, the sweepstakes promoter either will withhold taxes from 
the cash award or report the winnings to the Internal Revenue Service.</p>
<p>Overnight delivery services may be used in fraudulent schemes for several reasons. The scam operators may want to get your 
money before you become suspicious and change your mind. They also may avoid mail fraud charges by using a courier.</p>
<p>Give a credit card number</p>
<p>To show your eligibility, you may be asked for your credit card number. Never give your credit card number over the phone to 
someone you do not know. The number may be used to make unauthorized charges on your account. Legitimate sweepstakes 
do not need your credit card number to award a prize.</p>
<p>Take action immediately</p>
<p>High pressure tactics may be used to get your money quickly and give you little or no time to verify the caller's identity. Be 
especially wary if you're called during evenings or on weekends when you will not be able to call legitimate sweepstakes 
promoters.</p>
<h4>Checking it Out</h4>
<p>If you are contacted by someone who says you have won a major sweepstakes -- and they ask for money or your credit card 
number -- call the sweepstakes promoter yourself to verify any winnings. For the phone numbers of some major sweepstakes, 
see the box below.</p>
<p>Publishers Clearing House 1-800-645-9242</p>
<p>American Family Publishers 1-800-237-2400</p>
<p>Million Dollar Dream Sweepstakes (Time, Inc.) 1-800-541-1000</p>
<p>Reader's Digest Sweepstakes 1-800-234-9000</p>
<p>Getting More Information or Filing a Complaint</p>
<p>If you have questions about a sweepstakes promotion -- or if you think you've been victimized by a sweepstakes scam -- call the 
National Fraud Information Center at 1-800-876-7060 (9 a.m. - 5 p.m. EST, Monday - Friday). Also contact your local 
consumer protection agency or attorney general's office.</p>
<p>In addition, the FTC would like to hear from you. Write: Correspondence Branch, Federal Trade Commission, Washington, DC 
20580. Although the FTC does not handle individual disputes, the information you provide may help the agency in its 
enforcement efforts.</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Unordered Merchandise -- November 1992</h2>
<p>... A woman responds to a newspaper advertisement offering a free &quot;trial&quot; pair of pantyhose. She is surprised when she receives 
a package of four, with a bill.</p>
<p>... A man receives a pocket knife that he never ordered. Despite his objections, the company continues to send him dunning 
notices, threatening his credit rating.</p>
<p>Thousands of people are placed in similar situations every year. Fortunately, they do not have to pay for merchandise they did 
not order because federal laws prohibit mailing unordered merchandise to consumers and then demanding payment.</p>
<p>Here are answers to some questions you may have about unordered merchandise.</p>
<p>Q. I received an item of clothing that I never ordered. Am I obligated to pay for the merchandise or return it?</p>
<p>A. No. If you are sent clothing, cookware, linens, office supplies, or any other merchandise that you did not order, you have a 
legal right to keep the shipment as a free gift.</p>
<p>Q. If I keep unordered merchandise for free, must I notify the seller?</p>
<p>A. While you have no legal obligation to do so, sending a letter stating your intention to keep the shipment as a free gift is an 
advisable precaution. Your letter may discourage the seller from sending you repeated bills or dunning notices, or it may help to 
clear up an honest error. You may want to send your letter by certified mail and keep the return receipt and a copy of the letter. 
This will help you to establish later, if necessary, that you did not order the merchandise.</p>
<p>If you ever receive bills or dunning notices for unordered merchandise, you can use the same approach. Write a letter to the 
company stating that you never ordered the item and, therefore, you have a legal right to keep the merchandise for free. Again, 
you may wish to send your letter by certified mail and keep the return receipt and a copy of the letter.</p>
<p>Q. The unordered merchandise I received was apparently the result of an honest shipping error. What should I do?</p>
<p>A. Write the seller and offer to return the merchandise provided the seller pays for postage and handling. Give the seller a 
specific and reasonable amount of time (i.e., 30 days) in which to pick up the merchandise or arrange to have it returned at no 
expense to you. Inform the seller that after the specified time period has passed, you reserve the right to keep the merchandise or 
to dispose of it as you wish.</p>
<p>Q. Is there any merchandise that may be sent legally without my consent?</p>
<p>A. Yes. Free samples that are clearly and plainly marked as such, and merchandise mailed by charitable organizations asking for 
contributions may be sent legally without an order from you. In either case, you may keep such shipments as free gifts.</p>
<p>Q. Is there any way to protect myself from shippers of unordered merchandise?</p>
<p>A. When participating in sweepstakes or ordering goods advertised as &quot;free,&quot; &quot;trial,&quot; or &quot;unusually low priced,&quot; be especially 
cautious. Read all the fine print to determine if you are joining a &quot;club,&quot; with regular purchasing or notification obligations.</p>
<p>Also, if you are considering a purchase from a mail order company, learn as much as possible about the company's reputation 
and return policies to avoid a substitution problem. When placing an order by phone, keep a record of the name of the clerk who 
takes your order; the company's name, street address, and phone number; the price, description, and item numbers of the 
merchandise you ordered; the total cost of the order; the method of payment you used (e.g., check, the credit card, C.O.D.); the 
method of shipment and anticipated delivery date; and the date you placed the order. When ordering by mail, make a copy of 
the order form, which should contain comparable information.</p>
<p>With either method of ordering, it also is useful to keep a copy of the advertisement or catalog that led you to place the order. 
This may make it easier to contact the company if a problem arises.</p>
<p>Q. Where can I go for help in dealing with unordered merchandise problems?</p>
<p>A. Always start by trying to resolve your dispute with the company itself. If this is unsuccessful, you can seek assistance from 
your local U.S. Postal Inspector, your state or local consumer protection office, the Better Business Bureau in your area, or the 
Direct Marketing Association, 6 East 43rd Street, New York, New York 10017.</p>
<p>You also can contact the Federal Trade Commission. Although the FTC cannot resolve your individual complaint, the agency 
can take action against the company if it finds evidence of a pattern of deception, unfair practices, or statutory violations. Send 
your letter to: Correspondence Branch, Federal Trade Commission, Washington, D.C. 20580.</p>
<p>For information about shopping by mail or phone, you can request the following free publications: Shopping by Phone and Mail, 
and Shopping by Mail. Write to: Public Reference, Federal Trade Commission, Washington, D.C. 20580.</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Warranties -- November 1992</h2>
<p>Before you make a major purchase, there is an important promise you should read. It is called the warranty -- the manufacturer's 
or seller's promise to stand behind a product. Warranties vary in the amount of coverage they provide. So, just as you compare 
the style, price, and other characteristics of products before you buy, you also can compare their warranties. The 
Magnuson-Moss Act of 1975 requires that warranties be available for you to read before you make a purchase.</p>
<h4>Written Warranties</h4>
<p>Written warranties come with most major purchases, although this is not legally required. The protection offered by written 
warranties varies greatly, so it is important to compare warranties before making a purchase. Here are some questions to keep in 
mind when comparing warranties.</p>
<p>What parts and repair problems are covered by the warranty?</p>
<p>Check to see if any parts of the product or types of repair problems are excluded from coverage.</p>
<p>Are any expenses excluded from coverage?</p>
<p>Some warranties require you to pay for labor charges.</p>
<p>How long does the warranty last?</p>
<p>Check the warranty to see when it expires.</p>
<p>Does the warranty cover &quot;consequential damages&quot;?</p>
<p>Many warranties do not cover consequential damages. This means that the company will not pay for any damage the product 
caused, or your time and expense in getting the damage repaired. For example, if your freezer breaks and the food spoils, the 
company will not pay for the food you lost.</p>
<p>Are there any conditions or limitations on the warranty?</p>
<p>Some warranties only provide coverage if you maintain or use the product as directed. For example, a warranty may cover only 
personal uses -- as opposed to business uses -- of the product. Make sure the warranty will meet your needs.</p>
<p>Who do you contact to obtain warranty service?</p>
<p>It may be the seller or the manufacturer who provides you with service.</p>
<p>What will you have to do to get repairs?</p>
<p>Look for conditions that could prove expensive, such as a requirement that you ship a heavy object to a factory for service.</p>
<p>What will the company do if the product fails?</p>
<p>Find out if the company will repair it, replace it, or return your money.</p>
<h4>Spoken Warranties</h4>
<p>Sometimes a salesperson will make an oral promise, for example, that the seller will provide free repairs. However, if this claim is 
not in writing, you may not be able to get the promised service. Have the salesperson put the promise in writing, or do not count 
on the service.</p>
<h4>Service Contracts</h4>
<p>When you buy a car, home, or major appliance you may be offered a service contract. Although often called &quot;extended 
warranties,&quot; service contracts are not warranties. Warranties are included in the price of the product. Service contracts come 
separately from the product, at an extra cost. To decide whether you need a service contract, you should consider several 
factors; whether the warranty already covers the repairs that you would get under the service contract; whether the product is 
likely to need repairs and their potential costs; how long the service contract is in effect; and the reputation of the company 
offering the service contract. To learn more about buying a service contract, write: &quot;Service Contracts,&quot; Public Reference, 
Federal Trade Commission, Washington, D.C. 20580.</p>
<h4>Implied Warranties</h4>
<p>Although warranties are not required by law, there is another type of warranty that is. It is called an &quot;implied&quot; warranty. Implied 
warranties are created by state law, and all states have them. Almost every purchase you make is covered by an implied 
warranty. The most common type of implied warranty is called a &quot;warranty of merchantability.&quot; This means that the seller 
promises the product will do what it is supposed to do. For example, a car will run, a toaster will toast.</p>
<p>Another type of implied warranty is the &quot;warranty of fitness for a particular purpose.&quot; This applies when you buy a product on the 
seller's advice that it is suitable for a particular use. For example, a seller who suggests that you buy a certain sleeping bag for 
zero-degree weather warrants that the sleeping bag will be suitable for zero degrees.</p>
<p>If your purchase does not come with a written warranty, it is still covered by implied warranties unless the product is marked &quot;as 
is,&quot; or the seller otherwise indicates in writing that no warranty is given. Several states, including Kansas, Maine, Maryland, 
Massachusetts, Mississippi, Vermont, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia, do not permit &quot;as is&quot; sales. If problems arise 
that are not covered by the written warranty, you should investigate the protection given by your implied warranty.</p>
<p>Implied warranty coverage can last as long as four years, although the length of the coverage varies from state to state. A lawyer 
or a state consumer protection office can provide more information about implied warranty coverage in your state.</p>
<h4>Preventing Problems</h4>
<p>To minimize the chance of a problem with your warranty, take these precautions.</p>
<p>Consider the reputation of the company offering the warranty. If you are not familiar with the company, ask your local or state 
consumer protection office or Better Business Bureau if they have any complaints against the company. A warranty is only as 
good as the company that offers it.</p>
<p>Before you buy, read the warranty. See exactly what protection the warranty gives you.</p>
<p>Save the sales slip and file it with your warranty. You may need it later to document the date of your purchase or, in the case of a 
warranty limited to the first purchaser, that you were the original buyer.</p>
<p>Perform any maintenance or inspections required by the warranty.</p>
<p>Use the product according to the manufacturer's instructions. Abuse or misuse of the product may cancel your warranty 
coverage.</p>
<h4>Resolving Disputes</h4>
<p>If you are faced with any problems with a product or with obtaining the promised warranty service, here are some steps you can 
take.</p>
<p>Read your product instructions and warranty carefully. Do not expect features or performance that your product was not 
designed to give, or assume warranty coverage that was never promised. Having a warranty does not mean that you 
automatically get a refund if the product is defective. The company may be entitled to try to fix it first. In addition, if you reported 
a defect to the company during the warranty period and the product was not fixed properly, the company must correct the 
problem, even if your warranty has expired.</p>
<p>Discuss your complaint with the seller. Disputes usually can be resolved at this level. But if you cannot reach an agreement, write 
the manufacturer. Your warranty should list the company's mailing address. Send all letters by certified mail and keep copies.</p>
<p>If you cannot get satisfaction from either the seller or manufacturer, contact your local consumer protection agencies. They may 
be able to help.</p>
<p>Inquire about dispute resolution organizations. They arbitrate disagreements when both you and the company are willing to 
participate. The company or local consumer protection office can suggest organizations to contact. Consult your warranty; 
dispute resolution may be a required first step before going to court.</p>
<p>To learn more about dispute resolution programs, write: &quot;How to Resolve Consumer Disputes&quot; and &quot;Road to Resolution: 
Handling Customer Disputes,&quot; Public Reference, Federal Trade Commission, Washington, D.C. 20580.</p>
<p>Most states have small claims courts. If the amount of money in dispute is relatively small, usually less than $750, you can file a 
lawsuit in small claims court. The costs are low, procedures are simple, and lawyers usually are not needed. The clerk of the 
small claims court can tell you how to bring your lawsuit and what the dollar limits are in your state.</p>
<p>If none of these actions resolves your dispute, you may want to consider a lawsuit. The Magnuson-Moss Act allows you to sue 
for damages or for any other type of relief the court awards, including legal fees. A lawyer will be able to advise you whether to 
proceed with a lawsuit.</p>
<p>Although the FTC cannot represent you directly in a dispute with a company, it wants to know if companies are meeting their 
warranty obligations. To report violations of the Warranty Act, or other warranty-related problems, send your complaints to: 
Correspondence Branch, Federal Trade Commission, Washington, D.C. 20580.</p>

Questions and Answers on the Freedom of Information Act and the Privacy 
Act, 1992</h2>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>This brochure provides basic guidance about the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and the Privacy Act of 1974. A 
question-and-answer format is used to present information about these laws in a clear, simple manner to assist members of the 
public in exercising their rights. This publication is not intended to be a comprehensive treatment of the complex issues associated 
with the FOIA and the Privacy Act.</p>
<p>The questions answered in this brochure are those frequently asked by persons who contact the Federal Information Center 
(FIC) for information on the FOIA and the Privacy Act. The answers were compiled by the FIC and the Consumer Information 
Center (CIC) of the U.S. General Services Administration. They were reviewed by the Department of Justice, the agency 
responsible for coordinating administration of the FOIA and encouraging agency compliance. The Office of Management and 
Budget, which has a similar responsibility for the Privacy Act, reviewed the answers to questions on the Privacy Act.</p>
<p>The FOIA, enacted in 1966, generally provides that any person has a right of access to federal agency records. This right of 
access is enforceable in court except for those records that are protected from disclosure by the nine exemptions to the FOIA, 
which are discussed in the text.</p>
<p>Closely related to the Freedom of Information Act is the Privacy Act, another federal law regarding federal government records. 
The Privacy Act establishes certain controls over how the executive branch agencies of the federal government gather, maintain, 
and disseminate personal information. The Privacy Act can also be used to obtain access to information, but it pertains only to 
records the federal government keeps on individual citizens and lawfully admitted resident aliens. The FOIA, on the other hand, 
covers all records under the custody and control of federal executive branch agencies.</p>
<p>This brochure contains information about the most significant provisions of the FOIA and the Privacy Act. We hope you find it 
helpful.</p>
<h4>The Freedom of Information Act</h4>
<p>What information is available under the FOIA? The FOIA provides access to all federal agency records (or portions of those 
records) except those which are protected from release by nine specific exemptions (reasons an agency may withhold records 
from a requester). The exemptions cover such material as (1) classified national defense and foreign relations information, (2) 
internal agency personnel rules and practices, (3) material prohibited from disclosure by another law, (4) trade secrets and other 
confidential business information, (5) certain inter-agency or intra-agency communications, (6) personnel, medical, and other files 
involving personal privacy, (7) certain records compiled for law enforcement purposes, (8) matters relating to the supervision of 
financial institutions, and (9) geological information on oil wells. The Freedom of Information Act, as most recently amended in 
1986, is printed in its entirety later in the text.</p>
<p>The FOIA does not apply to Congress or the courts, nor does it apply to records of state or local governments. However, 
nearly all state governments have their own FOIA-type statutes. You may request information about a state's law by writing the 
attorney general of the state.</p>
<p>The FOIA does not require a private organization or business to release any information directly to the public, whether it has 
been submitted to the government or not. However, information submitted by private firms to the federal government may be 
available through a FOIA request provided that the information is not a trade secret, confidential business information, or 
protected by some other exemption.</p>
<p>Under the FOIA, you may request and receive a copy of any record that is in an agency's official files and is not covered by one 
of the exemptions. For example, suppose you have heard that a certain toy is being investigated as a safety hazard and you want 
to know the details. In this case, the Consumer Product Safety Commission could probably help you. Perhaps you want to read 
the latest inspection report on conditions at a nursing home certified for Medicare. Your local Social Security office keeps such 
records on file. Or, you might want to know if the Federal Bureau of Investigation has a file that includes you. In all these 
examples, you may use the FOIA to request information from the appropriate federal agency. (See discussion below on how to 
find the right agency and address.) When you make a FOIA request, you must describe the material you want as specifically as 
possible. If the agency cannot identify what you have requested with a reasonable amount of effort, it is under no obligation to 
you. The FOIA does not require agencies to do research for you, to compile or analyze data, or to answer questions.</p>
<p>Whom do I contact in the federal government with my request? How do I get the right address?</p>
<p>No one office handles all FOIA requests. Each request for information must be made to the particular agency that has the 
records sought. For example, if you want to know about an investigation of motor vehicle defects, write to the Department of 
Transportation. If you want information about a work-related accident at a nearby job site or manufacturing plant, write to the 
Department of Labor (at its office in the region where the accident occurred). Some of the larger departments and agencies have 
several Freedom of Information offices. Some have one for each major bureau or component; others have one for each region of 
the country.</p>
<p>You may have to do a little research to find the proper office to handle your inquiry, but you will save time in the long run if you 
send your request directly to the appropriate office. For assistance, you can contact the Federal Information Center (FIC). With 
telephone numbers throughout the country, the FIC is specially prepared to help you find the right agency, the right office, and 
the right address. The FIC is administered by the U.S. General Services Administration. See later text for information on how to 
contact the FIC. Also, a booklet called the Consumer's Resource Handbook tells what federal agencies are responsible for 
specific consumer problems and where to write for assistance. (The Handbook is free; to order, send your name and address to: 
Handbook, Pueblo, CO 81009). The U.S. Government Manual, the official handbook of the federal government, may also be 
useful. It describes the programs within each federal agency and lists the names of top personnel and agency addresses. The 
Manual is available at most public libraries or can be purchased from the Superintendent of Documents. (Ordering instructions 
appear later in the text).</p>
<p>How do I request information under the FOIA?</p>
<p>When you get the agency's name and address, write a letter of request to the agency's Freedom of Information Office. (Note on 
the envelope and at the top of the letter &quot;Freedom of Information Act Request.&quot;) Identify the records you want as accurately as 
possible. Although you do not have to give the document's name or title, your request must reasonably describe the records 
sought. Any facts or clues which you can furnish about the time, place, persons, events, subjects, or other details of the 
information or records you seek will be helpful to agency personnel in deciding where to search and in determining which records 
pertain to your request. This can save you and the government time and money and also improve your prospects for getting what 
you want.</p>
<p>A sample request is shown below. Keep a copy of your request. You may need it in the event of an appeal or if your original 
request is not answered.</p>
<p>If you are not sure whether the information you want falls under one of the nine exemptions, you may request it anyway. It might 
help your case to state your reason(s) for such a request, even though the FOIA does not require you to do so. (A requester 
should, however, always provide the reason(s) for requesting a waiver of fees.) Agencies usually have discretion to release 
material that falls under these exemptions. Stating your reason(s) for a request may persuade an agency to give you access to 
records it might otherwise deny as legally exempt. In addition, giving reasons for a request might help the agency to locate 
information which is useful to you.</p>
<p>What about costs for getting records under the FOIA?</p>
<p>An agency may charge only for the actual cost of searching for the material and the cost of making copies for you. Search fees 
usually range from $10 to $30 per hour; the rates generally reflect salary levels of the personnel needed for the search. The 
charge for copying letter-size and legal-size pages can be as much as 25 cents apiece, but 10 cents per page is common in most 
agencies. Actual costs can vary from agency to agency. For noncommercial requests, agencies will not charge for the first two 
hours of search time or for the first 100 pages of photocopies. Agencies also will waive further charges if the total cost is minimal. 
If fees are charged, you may receive a waiver or reduction of fees if you request it and can show that the information you are 
seeking will, when released, contribute significantly to the public understanding of the operations or activities of the government.</p>
<p>How long will it take to answer my request?</p>
<p>Federal agencies are required to answer your request for information within 10 working days of receipt (excluding Saturdays, 
Sundays, and holidays). If you have not received a reply by the end of that time (be sure to allow for mailing time), you may write 
a follow-up letter or telephone the agency to ask about the delay. Sometimes an agency may need more than 10 working days to 
find the records, examine them, possibly consult other persons or agencies, and decide whether it will disclose the records 
requested. If so, the agency is required to inform you before the deadline. Agencies have the right to extend this period up to 10 
more working days. A few agencies, particularly law enforcement agencies, receive large numbers of requests, some of which 
involve massive numbers of pages or require particular care to process correctly. If an agency has a backlog of requests that 
were received before yours and has assigned a reasonable portion of its staff to work on the backlog, the agency usually will 
handle requests on a first-come, first-served basis and may not respond to all requests within the statutory period.</p>
<p>What happens if the agency refuses to give me the information?</p>
<p>An agency ordinarily will deny a FOIA request, in whole or in part, only if it has a serious practical problem with granting it, 
supported by a legal reason for denial (an exemption). If an agency denies your request, it must be able to prove that the 
information is covered by one of the nine exemptions listed in the Act. The agency must give you the reason (the exemption) for 
denial in writing and inform you of your right to appeal the decision. How do I appeal a denial?</p>
<p>You should promptly send a letter notifying the agency that you want to appeal. Most agencies require that appeals be made 
within 30 to 45 days after you get a notification of denial. The denial letter should tell you to whom your appeal letter should be 
addressed. To appeal, simply ask the agency to review your FOIA request and change its decision. It is a good idea also to give 
your reason(s) for believing that the denial was wrong. Be sure you refer to all communications you have had on the matter. It 
will save time in acting on your appeal if you include copies of the original request for information and the agency's letter of 
denial. You do not need to enclose copies of any documents released to you. The agency has 20 working days after it receives 
your appeal letter to respond. Under certain circumstances, it may also take an extension of up to 10 working days. If, however, 
an agency took 10 extra days to deny your initial request, it would not be entitled to an extension on the appeal.</p>
<p>What can I do if my appeal is rejected?</p>
<p>If you are willing to invest the time and money, you may take the matter to court. You can file a FOIA lawsuit in the U.S. District 
Court where you live, where you have your principal place of business, where the documents are kept, or in the District of 
Columbia. In court, the agency will have to prove that the withheld records, or the withheld portions of them, are covered by one 
of the exemptions listed in the Act. If you win a substantial portion of your case, the court may require the government to pay 
court costs and reasonable attorney's fees for you. </p>
<h4>The Privacy Act</h4>
<p>What is the Privacy Act?</p>
<p>The federal government compiles a wide range of information on individuals. For example, if you were ever in the military or 
employed by a federal agency, there should be records of your service. If you have ever applied for a federal grant or received a 
student loan guaranteed by the government, you are probably the subject of a file. There are records on every individual who has 
ever paid income taxes or received a check from Social Security or Medicare.</p>
<p>The Privacy Act, passed by Congress in 1974, establishes certain controls over what personal information is collected by the 
federal government and how it is used. The Act guarantees three primary rights: (1) the right to see records about yourself, 
subject to the Privacy Act's exemptions, (2) the right to amend that record if it is inaccurate, irrelevant, untimely, or incomplete, 
and (3) the right to sue the government for violations of the statute including permitting others to see your records unless 
specifically permitted by the Act.</p>
<p>It also provides for certain limitations on agency information practices, such as requiring that information about a person be 
collected from that person to the greatest extent practicable; requiring agencies to ensure that their records are relevant, accurate, 
timely, and complete; and prohibiting agencies from maintaining information describing how an individual exercises his or her First 
Amendment rights unless the individual consents to it, a statute permits it, or it is within the scope of an authorized law 
enforcement investigation.</p>
<p>What information may I request under the Privacy Act?</p>
<p>The Privacy Act applies only to documents about individuals maintained by agencies in the executive branch of the federal 
government. It applies to these records only if they are in a &quot;system of records,&quot; which means they are retrieved by an individual's 
name, social security number, or some other personal identifier. In other words, the Privacy Act does not apply to information 
about individuals in records that are filed under other subjects, such as organizations or events, unless the agency also indexes 
and retrieves them by individual names or other personal identifiers. Like the FOIA, the Privacy Act mainly applies to records 
held by federal agencies.</p>
<p>There are 10 exemptions to the Privacy Act under which an agency can withhold certain kinds of information from you. 
Examples of exempt records are those containing classified information on national security or those concerning criminal 
investigations. Another exemption often used by agencies is that which protects information that would identify a confidential 
source. For example, if an investigator questions a person about your qualifications for federal employment and that person 
agrees to answer only if his identity is protected, then his name or any information that would identify him can be withheld. The 
10 exemptions are set out in the Act.</p>
<p>If you are interested in more details, you should read the Privacy Act in its entirety. Though the Act is too lengthy to publish as 
part of this brochure, it is readily available. It is printed in the U.S. Code (Section 552a of Title 5), which can be found in many 
public and school libraries. You may also order a copy of the Privacy Act of 1974, Public Law 93-579, from the Superintendent 
of Documents. (Ordering instructions appear later in the text.)</p>
<p>Whom do I contact in the federal government with my request? How do I get the right address?</p>
<p>As with the FOIA, no one office handles all Privacy Act requests.</p>

<h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>
<p>Does this home fit my needs and those of my family? Is this a safe, secure home, free from potential hazards? Is this home a 
good investment and will it retain and increase its value in the years ahead?</p>
<p>These are among the hundreds of questions that home buyers ask themselves as part of the home- buying thought process. It is a 
good policy, this questioning, a means of gathering hard facts that can be used to balance the emotional feelings that are so much 
a part of buying a home.</p>
<p>In ever- increasing numbers, home buyers today find it necessary to add new kinds of questions to their quest for information. 
Environmental concerns are becoming an element of the home- buying thought process.</p>
<p>Although it is unrealistic to expect that any home you are considering purchasing will be free of all forms of environmental 
influences, most homes (and the areas surrounding most homes) in the United States generally do not contain materials and 
substances that pose a health threat. However, in recent years, new concerns have been raised as our understanding of the 
natural environment has increased. Substances, such as radon gas and asbestos, have provoked new questions about how and 
where we build homes and manage their upkeep.</p>
<h4>HOME- BUYING CONSIDERATIONS</h4>
<p>For the majority of Americans, the purchase of a home is the single greatest investment of a lifetime. Will the presence of an 
undetected environmental hazard have a long- term negative impact on that investment? Does the presence of a hazard have the 
potential to affect the health of the occupants? If hazards can be safely removed or mitigated, will the process alter the 
homeowner's lifestyle? These questions- - and others like them- - are, and should be, part of the home buyer's thought process 
today.</p>
<p>As our knowledge of the natural environment evolves, the body of law governing potentially harmful environmental hazards and 
their effect on real estate transactions also is evolving. The rights and responsibilities of buyers and sellers are determined by state 
and local laws or terms negotiated into the sales contract between the buyer and seller.</p>
<p>Thus, before buying a home, prudent home buyers may want to obtain information about the potential impact of environmental 
hazards. Local, county, or state health or environmental departments are sources of such information. And while builders, real 
estate appraisers, real estate sales licensees, and lenders are not experts about the environment, these individuals may be of 
assistance in locating additional sources of information regarding environmental matters. Private home inspectors also may be 
useful in detecting the existence of potentially hazardous conditions if the sales contract provides for such an inspection.</p>
<p>The pages that follow provide general information about some of the environmental hazards that have the potential to affect the 
home environment. While this information is believed to be accurate, it is not meant to be comprehensive or authoritative. This 
publication provides introductory information to help home buyers understand the possible risk of exposure to potentially harmful 
environmental hazards in and around the home.</p>

any of these parties- - do not make any warranty, guarantee, or representation (express or implied) with respect to the usefulness 
or effectiveness of any information, method, or process disclosed in this material or assume any liability for the use of (or for

<h4>RADON</h4>
<p>WHAT IS RADON AND WHERE IS IT FOUND?</p>
<p>Radon is a colorless, odorless, tasteless gas that occurs worldwide in the environment as a byproduct of the natural decay of 
uranium present in the earth. Radon is present in varying quantities in the atmosphere and in soils around the world.</p>
<p>HOW DOES RADON ENTER A HOME?</p>
<p>Radon that is present in surrounding soil or in well water can be a source of radon in a home. Radon from surrounding soil enters 
a home through small spaces and openings, such as cracks in concrete, floor drains, sump pump openings, wall/floor joints in 
basements, and the pores in hollow block walls. It also can seep into ground water and remain entrapped there. Therefore, if a 
home is supplied with water taken from a ground water source (such as a well), there is greater potential for a radon problem. 
The likelihood of radon in the water supply is greatly reduced for homes supplied with water from a municipal water supply.</p>
<p>IS RADON FOUND THROUGHOUT A HOME, OR JUST IN CERTAIN ROOMS OR AREAS?</p>
<p>Radon generally concentrates most efficiently in the areas of a home closest to the ground. Radon levels generally decrease as 
one moves higher up in the structure.</p>
<p>HOW CAN I TELL IF A HOME HAS A RADON PROBLEM?</p>
<p>The only way to know whether or not a home has a radon problem is to test it. Radon levels vary from house to house 
depending on the construction of the house and the soil surrounding it. There are several ways to make a preliminary screening 
test for radon. Preliminary screening test kits can be bought over- the counter in many hardware, grocery, and convenience 
stores. Tests that measure the amount of radon in water normally require you to send a sample of tap water to a laboratory for 
analysis. State agencies should be consulted if the home water supply is suspected as a source of radon.</p>
<p>When purchasing a radon detection kit, you should examine the package for indications that the kit has been approved by federal 
or state health, environmental protection, or consumer protection agencies. Directions should be followed carefully when using a 
radon detection kit to assure that proper measurements are obtained. Short- term testing (ranging from a few days to several 
months) is one way to determine if a potential problem exists. Long- term testing (lasting for up to one year) is a more accurate 
way to determine if radon is present. Both short- and long- term testing devices are easy to use and relatively inexpensive.</p>
<p>WHY IS RADON HARMFUL?</p>
<p>Radon gas breaks down into radioactive particles (called decay products) that remain in the air. As you breath these particles, 
they can become trapped in your lungs. As these particles continue to break down, they release bursts of energy (radiation) that 
can damage lung tissue. This damage can cause lung cancer. When radon gas and its decay products enter your home, they 
remain in circulation the enclosed air. Out of doors, radon is not a problem for human beings because the surrounding air allows 
the gas to diffuse in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>WHAT HEALTH RISKS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH RADON?</p>
<p>The health risk associated with prolonged inhalation of radon decay products is an increased risk of developing lung cancer. 
There are indications that risk increases as the level of radon concentration and duration of exposure increase. The U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has determined that short- - term exposure to a high concentration of radon is not as 
severe a risk as long- term exposure to a lower level of the gas.</p>
<p>WHAT IS AN ACCEPTABLE LEVEL OF INDOOR RADON?</p>
<p>The concentration of radon in air is measured in units of picocuries per liter of air (pCi/L). Estimates suggest that most homes will 
contain from one to two picocuries of radon per liter of air. If preliminary tests indicate radon levels greater than four picocuries 
per liter of air in livable areas of the home, the EPA recommends that a follow- up test be conducted. No level of radon is 
considered safe; there are risks even at very low levels. To put this into perspective, the EPA estimates that the risk of dying 
from lung cancer as the result of an annual radon level of four picocuries is equivalent to the risk from smoking ten cigarettes a 
day or having 200 chest x- rays a year. A picocurie level of 40 equates to smoking two packs of cigarettes a day, while a level 
of 100 equates to 2000 chest x- rays a year.</p>
<p>HOW ARE RADON RISK LEVELS CALCULATED?</p>
<p>The EPA's risk assessments assume an individual is exposed to a given concentration of radon over a lifetime of roughly 70 
years, and spends 75 percent of his or her time in the home.</p>
<p>CAN THE LEVEL OF CAN RADON IN A HOME BE REDUCED?</p>
<p>Yes, there are many effective and relatively inexpensive methods of reducing radon levels in a home. The method used will vary 
from house to house and from region to region. The techniques used will depend on the source of the gas, the ways in which it 
enters the home, and the kind of construction used in the home. If radon is present in water supplies, it can be removed 
altogether or reduced by the installation of special filter systems.</p>
<p>WHAT WILL IT COST TO REDUCE THE LEVEL OF RADON IN A HOME?</p>
<p>The costs for radon reduction will depend on the number of sources, the amount of radon in the surrounding land or in the water 
supply, and the kind of construction used in the home. Normally, the costs of installing radon reduction equipment range from 
several hundred dollars to several thousand dollars. If the system chosen involves fans, pumps, or other appliances, operating 
costs for these devices may cause increases in monthly utility bills.</p>
<p>IS RADON REMOVAL A &quot;DO IT YOURSELF PROJECT&quot;?</p>
<p>Not usually. In some cases, homeowners should be able to treat the problem themselves; however, it is not always possible for 
homeowners to diagnose the source of radon or to install systems that will reduce the level. Radon source diagnosis and 
mitigation normally require skills, experience, and tools not available to the average homeowner; therefore, it is always prudent to 
consider the use of trained personnel. When seeking a contractor to assist with a radon problem, you should first consult local, 
county, or state government agencies for recommendations of qualified radon- reduction contractors.</p>
<p>WHAT IS THE GOVERNMENT DOING ABOUT RADON?</p>
<p>The federal government has undertaken an extensive public outreach effort to encourage individuals to test their homes. This 
effort includes a national hotline, 1- 800 SOS- RADON, for obtaining further information on radon testing. EPA also is working 
closely with state and local governments and the private sector to research and demonstrate cost- effective methods for reducing 
indoor radon levels and with builders to develop radon resistant new construction techniques.</p>

<h4>ASBESTOS</h4>
<p>WHAT IS ASBESTOS AND WHERE IS IT FOUND?</p>
<p>Asbestos is a fibrous mineral found in rocks and soil throughout the world. Asbestos has been used in architectural and 
construction applications because it is strong, durable, fire retardant, and an efficient insulator. Alone or in combination with other 
materials, asbestos can be fashioned into a variety of products that have numerous applications within the building industry- - 
such as flooring, walls, ceiling tiles, exterior housing shingles, insulation or fire retardant for heating and electrical systems, etc.</p>
<p>IS ASBESTOS DANGEROUS?</p>
<p>Asbestos has been identified as a carcinogen. Once ingested, asbestos fibers lodge in the lungs. Because the material is durable, 
it persists in tissue and concentrates as repeated exposures occur over time. It can cause cancer of the lungs and stomach among 
workers and others who have experienced prolonged work related exposure to it. The health effects of lower exposures in the 
home are less certain; however, experts are unable to provide assurance that any level of exposure to asbestos fibers is 
completely safe.</p>
<p>UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES DO ASBESTOS- CONTAINING PRODUCTS IN THE HOME BECOME A 
HEALTH RISK?</p>
<p>Home health risks arise when age, accidental damage, or normal cleaning, construction, or remodeling activities cause the 
asbestos- containing materials to crumble, flake, or deteriorate. When this happens, minute asbestos fibers are released into the 
air and can be inhaled through the nose and mouth. The fibers can cling to clothing, tools, and exposed flesh; cleanup operations 
can then dislodge the fibers and free them to circulate in the air.</p>
<p>CAN I EXPECT TO FIND ASBESTOS IN NEWER HOMES, AND WHERE IN THE HOME SHOULD I LOOK FOR 
ASBESTOS?</p>
<p>According to the EPA, many homes constructed in the United States during the past 20 years probably do not contain asbestos 
products. Places where asbestos sometimes can be found in the home include: around pipes and furnaces in older homes as 
insulating jackets and sheathing; in some vinyl flooring materials; in ceiling tiles; in exterior roofing, shingles, and siding; in some 
wallboards; mixed with other materials and troweled or sprayed around pipes, ducts, and beams; in patching compounds or 
textured paints; and in door gaskets on stoves, furnaces, and ovens.</p>
<p>HOW CAN I IDENTIFY ASBESTOS IN THE HOME?</p>
<p>You may hire a qualified professional who is trained and experienced in working with asbestos to survey the home. A 
professional knows where to look for asbestos, how to take samples properly, and what corrective actions will be the most 
effective. EPA regional asbestos coordinators can provide information on qualified asbestos contractors and laboratories. In 
addition, the manufacturer of a product may be able to tell you, based on the model number and age of the product, whether or 
not the product contains asbestos.</p>
<p>WHAT SHOULD I DO IF I THINK THERE IS ASBESTOS IN A HOME I HAVE PURCHASED?</p>
<p>Generally, if the material is in good condition and is in an area where it is not likely to be disturbed, leave the asbestos- containing 
material in place. Extreme care should be exercised in handling, cleaning, or working with material suspected of containing 
asbestos. If the material is likely to be banged, rubbed, handled, or taken apart- especially during remodeling- - you should hire a 
trained contractor and reduce your exposure as much as possible. Common construction and remodeling operations can release 
varying amounts of asbestos fibers if the material being worked on contains asbestos. These operations include hammering, 
drilling, sawing, sanding, cutting, and otherwise shaping or molding the material. Routine cleaning operations (such as brushing, 
dusting, vacuum cleaning, scraping, and scrubbing) can also release hazardous fibers from asbestos- containing materials. Vinyl 
flooring products that contain asbestos can be cleaned in a conventional manner, but these products can release some asbestos 
fibers if they are vigorously sanded, ground, drilled, filed, or scraped.</p>
<p>The repair or removal of asbestos- containing products from a home is generally a complicated process. It depends on the 
amount of these products present, the percentage of asbestos they contain, and the manner in which asbestos is incorporated into 
the product. Total removal of even small amounts of asbestos- containing material is usually the last alternative. You should 
contact local, state, or federal health or consumer product agencies before deciding on a course of action. To assure safety and 
elimination of health hazards, asbestos repair or removal should be performed only by properly trained contractors.</p>
<p>Many home repair or remodeling contractors do not yet have the requisite tools, training; experience, or equipment to work 
safely with asbestos or to remove it from a home. Furthermore, asbestos removal workers are protected under federal 
regulations that specify special training, protective clothing, and special respirators for these workers.</p>
<p>ARE EXTERIOR ASBESTOS SHINGLES A HEALTH RISK?</p>
<p>When properly installed on the exterior of a home, asbestos- containing products present little risk to human health. However, if 
siding is worn or damaged, spray painting it will help seal- in the fibers.</p>
<p>WHAT IS BEING DONE ABOUT THE POTENTIAL PROBLEM OF EXPOSURE TO ASBESTOS IN THE HOME?</p>
<p>Over the years, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) have 
taken several steps to reduce the consumer's exposure to asbestos. Most recently these steps include requiring labeling of 
products containing asbestos and announcing a phased- in ban of most asbestos products by 1996. The following sources and 
publications can provide additional information about asbestos in the home.</p>

Recent research has shown that lead represents a greater hazard at lower levels of concentration than had been thought. 
Airborne lead enters the body when an individual breathes lead particles or swallows lead dust. Until recently, the most important 
source of airborne dust was automobile exhaust.</p>
<p>When ingested, lead accumulates in the blood, bones, and soft tissue of the body. High concentrations of lead in the body can 
cause death or permanent damage to the central nervous system, the brain, the kidneys, and red blood cells. Even low levels of 
lead may increase high blood pressure in adults.</p>
<p>Infants, children, pregnant women, and fetuses are more vulnerable to lead exposure than others because the lead is more easily 
absorbed into growing bodies and their tissues are more sensitive to the damaging effects of the lead. Because of a child's smaller 
body weight, an equal concentration of lead is more damaging to a child than it would be to an adult.</p>
<p>WHAT ARE THE SOURCES OF LEAD IN AND AROUND THE HOME</p>
<p>Lead can be present in drinking water, in paint used to decorate the interior or exterior of a home, in the dust within a home, and 
in soil around the home.</p>
<p>LEAD IN DRINKING WATER</p>
<p>ARE THERE ACCEPTABLE LEVELS OF LEAD IN DRINKING WATER?</p>
<p>The EPA Office of Drinking Water has proposed regulations under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) that establish a 
maximum contaminant level for lead in drinking water of five micrograms per liter and a maximum contaminant level goal of zero. 
[Note: One microgram per liter is equal to one part per billion (ppb).] These levels or goals are set by EPA to control 
contamination that may have an adverse effect on human health. Nonenforceable health- based goals are intended to protect 
against known or anticipated adverse health effects with an adequate margin of safety. Both the current maximum contamination 
level and goal are 50 micrograms per liter. Although the Public Health Service first set these levels in the 1960s before much of 
the current knowledge about the harmful effects of lead at low levels was gained, the EPA included them unchanged in the Safe 
Drinking Water Act of 1985. EPA, however, is now revising these standards to reflect its increased concern.</p>
<p>I HAVE HEARD THAT MATERIALS CONTAINING LEAD HAVE BEEN BANNED FROM USE IN PUBLIC WATER 
SUPPLIES. IF THIS IS TRUE, HOW DOES LEAD ENTER DRINKING WATER IN THE HOME?</p>
<p>In 1986, amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act banned any further use of materials containing lead in public water supplies 
and in residences connected to public water supplies. In 1988, the U. S. Congress banned the use of lead- based solder in 
plumbing applications within homes and buildings. However, many homes built prior to 1988 contain plumbing systems that use 
lead- based solder in pipe connections. In such systems, lead can enter drinking water as a corrosion byproduct when plumbing 
fixtures, pipes, and solder are corroded by drinking water. In these instances, lead levels in water at the kitchen tap can be far 
higher than those found in water at treatment plants.</p>
<p>The combination of copper pipes connected with lead- based solder is found in many homes and can result in high levels of lead 
in water. In these circumstances, galvanic corrosion between the two metals releases relatively large amounts of lead into the 
water. The amount of lead in this ind of home water system will be higher when water has been at rest in the pipes for a period of 
time.</p>
<p>The EPA has determined that newly installed solder is most easily dissolved. As the home ages, mineral deposits build up on the 
inner walls of water pipes and act as an insulating barrier between the water and the solder. Data compiled by the EPA indicates 
that during the first five years following home construction, water in the home may have high levels of lead, with the highest levels 
recorded during the first 24 months.</p>
<p>CAN I TELL BY LOOKING AT PIPES AND PLUMBING FIXTURES WHETHER OR NOT WATER IN THE HOME 
WILL CONTAIN HARMFUL LEVELS OF LEAD?</p>
<p>No. Visual inspection of pipe joints and solder lines is not an accurate means of determining whether or not decaying solder is a 
source of lead.</p>
<p>A simple chemical test can determine whether the solder used in a home is lead containing or not. Many jurisdictions make use of 
this test as a regular procedure in plumbing inspections. And while many newer homes rely on nonmetallic plumbing lines, the 
majority of faucets and plumbing fixtures used today can contribute some lead to home water supplies. However, these 
contributions can be eliminated effectively by running the faucet for 15 seconds before drawing drinking water.</p>
<p>HOW CAN I TELL IF A HOME HAS A PROBLEM WITH LEAD IN THE WATER?</p>
<p>The only way to determine lead levels in water is to test a sample of the water. Should you suspect that lead is present in drinking 
water, or if you wish to have water tested, contact local, county, or state health or environmental departments for information 
about qualified testing laboratories.</p>
<p>IS LEAD IN WATER A CONCERN IN NEWLY RENOVATED OLDER HOMES?</p>
<p>If the renovation included replacement of aging water pipes with copper or other metal piping, you should check with the 
renovating contractor to ensure that lead solder was not used in pipe joints. Further, some old homes contain water systems 
made of pipes that can contain high levels of lead. If the original water lines remain in the house, you should question the 
renovating contractor regarding his or her knowledge of pipe composition.</p>
<p>LEAD- BASED PAINT</p>
<p>HOW PREVALENT IS LEAD- BASED PAINT?</p>
<p>According to the EPA, it is estimated that lead- based paint was applied to approximately two- thirds of the houses built in the 
U.S. before 1940; one- third of the houses built from 1940 to 1960; and to an indeterminate (but smaller) portion of U.S. houses 
built since 1960.</p>
<p>HOW CAN I TELL WHETHER THE PAINT IN A HOME CONTAINS LEAD?</p>
<p>The only accurate way to determine if paint in a home contains lead is to remove a sample of the paint and have it tested in a 
qualified laboratory. Should you suspect that lead is present in paint, or if you wish to have paint tested, contact local, county, or 
state health or environmental departments for information about qualified testing laboratories.</p>
<p>I HAVE HEARD ABOUT PROBLEMS WHEN CHILDREN EAT CHIPS OF LEAD- BASED PAINT, BUT ARE THERE 
ANY OTHER WAYS THAT LEAD- BASED PAINT CAN BE HARMFUL?</p>
<p>While the health hazards to children from eating lead- based paint chips have been known for some time, other sources of 
exposure to lead in household air and dust have been documented only recently. Lead can enter the air within a home when 
surfaces covered with lead- based paint are scraped, sanded, or heated with an open flame in paint- stripping procedures. Once 
released into the home atmosphere, lead particles circulate in the air and can be inhaled or ingested through the mouth and nose. 
Lead particles freed in fine dust or vapors settle into carpet fibers and fabric and can be recirculated in the air by normal 
household cleaning (such as sweeping and dusting) and through the normal hand- to- mouth behavior of young children, which 
results in the ingestion of potentially harmful amounts of any lead present in household dust. Fine lead particles penetrate the filter 
systems of home vacuum cleaners and are recirculated in the exhaust air streams of such appliances. Lead also can enter 
household air from outdoor sources (such as contaminated soil) and from recreational activities that require the use of solder or 
materials containing lead.</p>
<p>HOW CAN I GET RID OF LEAD- BASED PAINT SAFELY?</p>
<p>It is best to leave lead- based paint undisturbed if it is in good condition and there is little possibility that it will be eaten by 
children. Other procedures include covering the paint with wallpaper or some other building material, or completely replacing the 
painted surface.</p>
<p>Pregnant women and women who plan to become pregnant should not do this work. Professional paint removal is costly, time- 
consuming, and requires everyone not involved in the procedure to leave the premises during removal and subsequent clean up 
operations. In addition, if the house was built prior to 1950, there is a good chance that lead from exterior surface paint has 
accumulated in surrounding soils. Keep the yard well vegetated to minimize the likelihood of children being exposed to 
contaminated dust. Clean the floors, window- sills, and other surfaces regularly, preferably with wet rags and mops. Practice 
good hygiene with your children, especially frequent hand washing.</p>

<h4>HAZARDOUS WASTES</h4>
<p>WHAT ARE HAZARDOUS WASTES?</p>
<p>Hazardous wastes are those waste products that could pose short- or long- term danger to personal health or the environment if 
they are not properly disposed of or managed. These wastes can be produced by large business and industries (such as chemical 
and manufacturing plants), by some small businesses (such as drycleaners and printing plants), and by individuals who improperly 
apply, store, or dispose of compounds that contain potentially toxic ingredients (which can be found in chemical fertilizers, 
pesticides, and household products).</p>
<p>Concentrations of hazardous wastes occur in the environment when these wastes are handled, managed, or disposed of in a 
careless or unregulated manner. For many decades, hazardous industrial wastes were improperly disposed of on land, and their 
toxic components remained in the earth or seeped into ground water and drinking water supplies. The widespread use of 
pesticides and other agricultural chemicals also has resulted in the seepage and run- off of toxic compounds into land and water 
supplies. In addition, EPA estimates that as many as two million of the more than five million underground storage tanks in the 
United States may be leaking- - discharging gasoline, petroleum products, and other hazardous liquids into the soil and, 
potentially, into ground water sources.</p>
<p>WHAT IS BEING DONE TO LOCATE AND CLEAN UP HAZARDOUS WASTE SITES?</p>
<p>During the past 20 years, the U.S. Congress has enacted a body of interlocking laws and regulatory procedures aimed at the 
abatement of environmental hazards. The Superfund Act was enacted in 1980 (and amended in 1986) to provide more than $10 
billion for the detection and cleanup of sites where hazardous waste is a problem.</p>
<p>The revenue for Superfund is raised through taxes on petrochemical companies and other manufacturers. Under the law, the 
EPA, other federal agencies, and individual states may draw the necessary funds to allow them to react in hazardous waste 
emergency situations and to conduct long- term, permanent cleanups of hazardous waste sites.</p>
<p>HOW CAN I DETERMINE IF A HOME IS AFFECTED BY A HAZARDOUS WASTE SITE?</p>
<p>Generally, testing for hazardous waste involves skills and technology not available to the average homeowner or home 
remodeling contractor.</p>
<p>The EPA has identified more than 30,000 potentially contaminated waste sites nationwide and has completed a preliminary 
assessment of more than 27,000 of these sites. The Agency publishes a National Priorities List of sites that will require action 
through the Superfund.</p>
<p>Sites suspected of containing hazardous wastes are mapped at the time of the EPA preliminary assessment and communities 
likely to be affected by the site are notified. Thus, the nearest regional office of the EPA should have information on the location 
and status of local hazardous waste sites. The addresses and telephone numbers of these regional offices are listed in the back of 
this publication.</p>
<p>Furthermore, local and state governments maintain offices and agencies for locating and managing hazardous waste sites, which 
are often good sources for current information about the location and possible effects of these sites.</p>
<p>WHAT ARE THE PRIMARY HEALTH HAZARDS ASSOCIATED WITH HAZARDOUS WASTES?</p>
<p>The specific health hazards in homes contaminated by hazardous wastes are determined by the kinds and amounts of toxic 
substances present. Some hazardous wastes can cause death even when ingested in small amounts. Other hazardous wastes 
have been linked to elevated risks of cancer, permanent damage to internal body organs, respiratory difficulties, skin rashes, birth 
defects, and diseases that attack the central nervous system.</p>
<p>CAN HAZARDOUS WASTE CONCENTRATIONS BE REMOVED FROM MY PROPERTY OR REDUCED TO NON 
HAZARDOUS LEVELS?</p>
<p>The ability to remove or mitigate hazardous wastes will depend of the kinds, amounts, and sources of the wastes that are present. 
Generally, the removal of hazardous wastes from a property is beyond the capability of an individual homeowner.</p>

<h4>GROUND WATER CONTAMINATION</h4>
<p>WHAT CAUSES GROUND WATER CONTAMINATION?</p>
<p>Ground water contamination occurs when hazardous chemical wastes, pesticides, or other agricultural chemicals (such as 
fertilizer) seep down through the soil into underground water supplies. Faulty private septic systems, improperly managed 
municipal sewer systems, and leaking industrial injection wells can also contribute to ground water contamination. In recent years, 
leaking underground storage tanks also have posed a threat to ground water. Half of all Americans and 95 percent of rural 
Americans use ground water for drinking water.</p>
<p>IS GROUND WATER CONTAMINATION HARMFUL?</p>
<p>The U.S. Center for Disease Control reports an average of approximately 7,500 cases of illness linked to drinking water in the 
United States each year. This estimate generally is thought to be considerably lower than the actual figures because drinking 
water contaminants are not always considered in the diagnoses of illnesses.</p>
<p>HOW CAN I TELL IF THE WATER IN A HOME IS CONTAMINATED?</p>
<p>The only way to know whether or not the water in a home is contaminated is to test it. Since 1977, federal law has required 
water suppliers to periodically sample and test the water supplied to homes. If tests reveal that a national drinking water standard 
has been violated, the supplier must move to correct the situation and must also notify the appropriate state agency of the 
violation. Customers must be notified also, usually by a notice in a newspaper, an announcement on radio or television, or a letter 
from the health department that supervises the water supplier. If the home is supplied with water from its own private well, 
laboratory testing of a water sample is the only way to determine if the water supply is contaminated. Should you suspect that 
water is contaminated, or if you wish to have water tested, contact local, county, or state health or environmental departments for 
information about qualified testing laboratories.</p>
<p>WHAT CAN BE DONE TO DECONTAMINATE A HOME WATER SUPPLY?</p>
<p>If the home is supplied by an outside water supply source, federal law requires the provider to correct any contamination 
problems. When homes are supplied by private wells, analysis and treatment of the contaminated water may solve the problem.</p>
<p>WHAT WILL IT COST TO DECONTAMINATE A HOME WATER SUPPLY?</p>
<p>Normally, consumers bear no direct financial responsibility for eliminating contamination from water supplied by an outside 
source (if the water was contaminated when it was delivered); the supplier bears the primary responsibility for correcting 
contamination problems. In the case of contaminated water supplied from a private well (or water from an outside source that 
becomes contaminated after it is received from the supplier), the cost of decontamination will depend on the kinds and amounts 
of contaminants present.</p>
<p>In the majority of cases, decontamination of a private water source involves technology and knowledge beyond the scope of the 
average homeowner. State and local environmental and water quality officials may be able to provide additional information and 
assistance for decontamination of private water sources.</p>
<p>WHAT IS BEING DONE ABOUT GROUND WATER CONTAMINATION?</p>
<p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has the lead responsibility for assuring the quality and safety of the nation's ground 
water supply. The EPA's approach is focused in two areas: minimizing the contamination of ground water and surface waters 
needed for human consumption, and monitoring and treating drinking water before it is consumed.</p>
<p>In 1986, the U. S. Congress passed a set of amendments that expanded the protection provided by the Safe Drinking Water Act 
of 1974. These amendments streamlined the EPA's regulation of contaminants, banned all future use of lead pipe and lead solder 
in public drinking water systems, mandated greater protection of ground water sources, and authorized EPA to file civil suits or 
issue administrative orders against public water systems that are in violation of the Act.</p>
<p>Working with the states, EPA has set national standards for minimum levels of a number of contaminants and is mandated to set 
such standards for additional contaminants by 1991. In addition, EPA and the states are working to devise a national strategy for 
the monitoring and management of ground water supplies.</p>

<h4>FORMALDEHYDE</h4>
<p>WHAT IS FORMALDEHYDE?</p>
<p>Formaldehyde is a colorless, gaseous chemical compound that is generally present at low, variable concentrations in both indoor 
and outdoor air. It is emitted by many construction materials and consumer products that contain formaldehyde- based glues, 
resins, preservatives, and bonding agents. Formaldehyde also is an ingredient in foam that was used for home insulating until the 
early 1980s.</p>
<p>WHERE IS FORMALDEHYDE FOUND IN THE HOME?</p>
<p>Sources of formaldehyde in the home include smoke, household products, and unvented fuel- burning appliances (like gas stoves 
or kerosene space heaters). Formaldehyde, by itself or in combination with other chemicals, serves a number of purposes in 
manufactured products. For example, it is used to add permanent press qualities to clothing and draperies, as a component of 
glues and adhesives, and as a preservative in some paints and coating products.</p>
<p>In homes, the most significant sources of formaldehyde are likely to be in the adhesives used to bond pressed wood building 
materials and in plywood used for interior or exterior construction. Urea- formaldehyde (UF) resins are found in wood products 
that are intended for indoor use.</p>
<p>Phenol- formaldehyde (PF) resins are used inproducts intended for exterior uses. UF resins emit significantly more formaldehyde 
gas than PF resins. Certain foam insulating materials once widely used in housing construction (urea formaldehyde foam or UFFI) 
also contain large amounts of formaldehyde. While contractors have voluntarily stopped using UFFI foam insulation, the material 
is present in many homes that were originally insulated with UFFI.</p>
<p>WHAT HEALTH RISKS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH FORMALDEHYDE?</p>
<p>Formaldehyde has been shown to cause cancer in animals, but there is no definitive evidence linking the chemical to cancer in 
humans. Higher- than- normal levels of formaldehyde in the home atmosphere can trigger asthma attacks in individuals who have 
this condition. Other health hazards attributed to formaldehyde include skin rashes; watery eyes; burning sensations in the eyes, 
throat, and nasal passages; and breathing difficulties. Most persons will first react to formaldehyde when the levels are in the 
range of 0.1 to 1.1 parts per million. Some individuals acquire a reduced tolerance to formaldehyde following their initial 
exposure to the gas. In these instances, subsequent exposures to even small amounts of formaldehyde will cause reactions.</p>
<p>DO SOME KINDS OF HOMES CARRY A GREATER FORMALDEHYDE HEALTH RISK THAN OTHERS?</p>
<p>Yes, materials containing formaldehyde were used extensively in the construction of certain prefabricated and manufactured 
homes. Since 1985, the federal government, through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, has enforced 
regulations that sharply curtail the use of materials containing formaldehyde in these types of housing to the lower- emitting 
products. However, use of formaldehyde compounds is still widespread in the manufacture of furniture, cabinets, and other 
building materials.</p>
<p>WHAT CAN BE DONE TO REDUCE FORMALDEHYDE LEVELS IN A HOME?</p>
<p>Reducing formaldehyde levels in the home can be a simple or complex task depending on the source of the gas. Initial 
procedures often include steps to increase ventilation and improve circulation of outside air through the home. If new furniture, 
drapery, or other sources are contributing to higher- than- normal levels of formaldehyde, removal of these items (or limiting the 
number of new items introduced into the home) may be all that is needed.</p>
<p>In some instances, home subflooring or walls may be the source of formaldehyde, or foam insulation between inner and outer 
walls may be emitting the gas. If increased ventilation does not produce acceptable results in these instances, homeowners may 
be required to remove the formaldehyde- bearing material. Such procedures will be costly, time- consuming, and temporarily 
disruptive of life in the home.</p>
<p>HOW CAN I TELL IF THE HOME I WISH TO BUY CONTAINS FORMALDEHYDE- BEARING MATERIALS?</p>
<p>In the case of a new home, you should consult with the builder before you purchase the house if you suspect the presence of 
materials that emit high levels of formaldehyde. Most builders will be able to tell you if construction materials contain urea- 
formaldehyde or they may direct you to manufacturers who can provide information about specific products. In the case of an 
older home, formaldehyde- emitting materials may not be visually evident and the current owners may not have specific product 
information. Because formaldehyde emissions from building materials decrease as the materials age (particularly over the first two 
or three years), older urea- formaldehyde building materials most probably will not be a significant source of formaldehyde 
emissions.</p>
<p>If you suspect the presence of formaldehyde, you may wish to hire a qualified building inspector to examine the home for the 
presence of formaldehyde- emitting materials. In addition, home monitoring kits are currently available for testing formaldehyde 
levels in the home. Be sure that the testing device will monitor for a minimum of 24 hours to assure that the sampling period is 
truly representative.</p>

<h4>A Message About Your Child's Health</h4>
<p>Preventive care is as important for your child's health as treatment is when he or she is sick This care includes immunizations, 
tests, and health guidance. Your child receives preventive care from the doctor or other health care provider at check-up visits 
and at other times. Proper preventive care helps keep your child healthy.</p>
<p>As a parent, you should know what preventive care your child needs. Work with your child's doctor or other health care 
provider to assure that he or she gets proper care.</p>
<p>The Child Health Guide has information on needed preventive care and on good health habits. Use it as a permanent record to 
help you keep track of your child's health and care through the years. This guide can help your child get a healthy start on life.</p>
<p>M. Joycelyn Elders, M.D.<br>
Surgeon General<br>
U.S. Public Health Service <br>
</p>
<h4>How to Use The Child Health Guide</h4>
<p>Each page of the Child Health Guide covers an important health care topic.</p>
<p>* Read each page carefully and ask your child's doctor or other health care provider to answer any questions that you may have.</p>
<p>* The Preventive Care Timeline in the center of this booklet gives an overview of care your child may need at each age.</p>
<p>* Use the records throughout the Child Health Guide to keep track of the immunizations (shots), tests, exams, and other types of 
health care that your child gets. Use these records to remind you when your child needs to be seen next.</p>
<p>* Take the Child Health Guide home and keep it in a safe place. Check it often to make sure that your child is getting the 
preventive care that he or she needs. Keep the Child Health Guide up-to-date.</p>
<p>* Bring the Child Health Guide every time your child goes to a doctor or other health care provider-such as a nurse, nurse 
practitioner, or physician assistant.</p>

<h4>Check-Up Visits</h4>
<p>Your child's doctor or other health care provider may want to see your child for check-up visits even when shots or test are not 
due. Some authorities recommend check-up visits at the following ages: 2-4 weeks; 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18 months; and 2, 3, 
4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16 and 18 years. Your child's doctor or other health cam provider will discuss with you increasing or 
decreasing the number of these visits to meet the individual needs of your child.</p>

<h4>Immunizations</h4>
<p>Your child needs immunizations. Immunizations (shots) protect your child from many serious diseases. Below is a list of 
immunizations and the ages when your child should receive them. Immunizations should be given at the recommended ages--even 
if your child has a cold or minor illness at the time. Ask your health care provider about when your child should receive these 
important shots. Ask also if your child needs additional immunizations.</p>
<p>* Polio (OPV): At 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, and 4-6 years.<br>
* Diphtheria-Tetanus-Pertussis (DTP, DTP): At 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, 15 months, and 4-6 years. Tetanus-Diphtheria 
(Td) at 14-16 years.<br>
* Measles-Mumps Rubella (MMR) At 12-15 months and EITHER 4-6 years OR 11-12 years.<br>
* Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib): At 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, and 12-15 months; OR 2 months, 4 months, and 
12-15 months, depending on the vaccine type.<br>
* Hepatitis B (HBV): At birth, 1-2 months and 6-18 months; OR 1-2 months, 4 months, and 618 months.<br>
* Chickenpox (VZV): At 12-18 months.<br>
</p>
<h4>Immunization Record</h4>
<p>Use this chart or an official immunization card to keep track of your child's immunizations. Significant reactions should be 
recorded and reported to your Health care provider immediately.</p>
<h4>Growth Record</h4>
<p>Your child's doctor or other health care provider will measure your child's height and weight regularly. Your child's head size will 
also be measured during the first 2 years of life. These measurements will help you and your health care provider know if your 
child is growing properly. Use this record or the growth charts on pages 10-13 to keep track of your child's growth. If you need 
help using these charts, ask your doctor or other health care provider.</p>

<h4>High Blood Pressure</h4>
<p>Your child should have blood pressure measurements regularly, starting at around 3 years of age. High blood pressure in children 
needs medical attention. It may be a sign of underlying disease and, if not treated, may lead to serious illness.</p>
<p>Check with your child's doctor or health care provider about blood pressure measurements.</p>
<h4>Anemia</h4>
<p>Your child should be tested for anemia (&quot;low blood&quot;) when he or she is still a baby (usually around the first birthday) and also 
may need anemia tests as he or she gets older. Anemia may cause your child to grow slowly, tire easily, and get infections more 
often. Anemia in children is usually caused by too little iron in the diet. Your child needs to eat iron-rich foods such as meats, 
green leafy, vegetables, and iron-fortified cereals.</p>
<p>Check with your child's doctor or health care provider about anemia testing.</p>
<p>Record test results on pages 18-19.</p>
<h4>Lead</h4>
<p>Lead can harm your child, slowing physical and mental growth and damaging many parts of the body. The most common way 
children get lead poisoning is by being around old house paint that is chipping or peeling. Some authorities recommend lead tests 
at 1 and 2 years of age.</p>
<p>Use a (+) to mark &quot;yes&quot; answers to the questions below. Any &quot;yes&quot; answers may mean that your child needs lead tests earlier 
and more often than other children.</p>
<h4>HAS YOUR CHILD:</h4>
<p>* Lived in or regularly visited a house with peeling or chipped paint built before 1960? (This could include a day care center, 
preschool, the home of a babysitter, etc.)</p>
<p>* Lived in or regularly visited a house built before 1960 with recent, ongoing, or planned renovation or remodeling?</p>
<p>* Had a brother or sister, housemate, or playmate with lead poisoning?</p>
<p>* Lived with an adult whose job or hobby involves exposure to lead (such as refinishing furniture, making pottery or stained 
glass, or working in any of the industries listed in the next question)?</p>
<p>* Lived near a lead smelter, battery plant, car repair shop, glass or pipe factory, or other industry likely to release lead?</p>
<h4>Vision and Hearing</h4>
<p>Your child's vision should be tested before starting school, at about 3 or 4 years of age. Your child may also need vision tests as 
he or she grows. Some authorities recommend hearing testing beginning at 3 to 4 years of age.</p>
<p>If at any age your child has any of the vision or hearing warning signs listed below, be sure to talk with your doctor or other 
health care provider.</p>
<p>Vision Warning Signs</p>
<p>* Eyes turning inward (crossing) or outward<br>
* Squinting<br>
* Headaches<br>
* Not doing as well in school work as before<br>
* Blurred or double vision</p>
<p>Hearing Warning Signs</p>
<p>* Poor response to noise or voice<br>
* Slow language and speech development<br>
* Abnormal sounding speech<br>
SPECIAL WARNING: Listening to very loud music, especially with earphones, can permanently damage your child's hearing.</p>
<p>Record test results on pages 18-19.</p>
<h4>Additional Tests</h4>
<p>Your child may need other tests to prevent health problems. Check this list with your child's doctor or other health care provider.</p>
<p>Newborn Screening (for PKU, thyroid and other inherited/metabolic diseases)--If your child did not receive this blood test 
before coming home from the hospital, or received it before 24 hours of age. Some states require a repeat test during the first 
month of life.</p>
<p>Sickle Cell or Thalassemia Test--If your child has an African-American, Mediterranean, Asian, or Middle Eastern family 
background.</p>
<p>Tuberculosis (TB) Skin Test--If your child has had close contact with a person having TB, lives in an area where TB is more 
common than average (such as a Native American reservation, a homeless shelter, or an institution), or has recently moved from 
Asia, Africa, Central America, South America, the Caribbean, or the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Cholesterol Test--If your child has a parent with high cholesterol or a parent or grandparent with heart disease before age 55.</p>
<p>Urinalysis Test--If your child is less than 5 years of age, particularly if your child has had a bladder or kidney infection.</p>
<p>Record test results on pages 18-19.</p>
<p>Test and Exam Record</p>
<h4>Child Preventive Care Timeline</h4>
<p>Check-up visits are important for your child's health. Some authorities recommend these visits at the following ages: 2-4 weeks; 
2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18 months; and 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16 and 18 years. Your child's doctor or other health care 
provider will discuss with you the individual needs of your child. At check-up visits, your child may receive a physical 
examination and the types of preventive care shown below.</p>
<h4>Development</h4>
<p>Children grow and develop at different rates. This table shows the ages by which most young children develop certain abilities. It 
is normal for a child to do some of these things later than the ages noted here. If your child fails to do many of these at the ages 
given, or you have questions about his or her development, talk with your child's doctor or other health care provider.</p>

<h4>Nutrition</h4>
<p>What your child eats is very important for his or her health. Follow the nutrition guidelines below.<br>
</p>
<h2>Guidelines for a Healthy Diet</h2>
<h4>0-2 YEARS OLD:</h4>
<p>* Breast milk is the best single food for infants from birth to 6 months of age. It provides good nutrition and protects against 
infection. Breast feeding should be continued for at least the first year, if possible.<br>
* If breast feeding is not possible or not desired, iron-enriched formula (not cow's milk) should be used during the first 12 
months of life. Whole cow's milk can be&quot; used to replace formula or breast milk after 12 months of age.<br>
* Breast-fed babies, particularly if darkskinned, who do not get regular exposure to sunlight may need to receive Vitamin D 
supplements.<br>
* Begin suitable solid foods at 4-6 months of age. Most experts recommend ironenriched infant rice cereal as the first food.<br>
* Start new foods one at a time to make it easier to identify problem foods. For example, wait one week before adding each 
new cereal, vegetable, or other food.<br>
* Use iron-rich foods, such as meats, ironenriched cereals, and other grains.<br>
* Do not give honey to infants during the first 6-12 months of life.<br>
* Do not limit fat during the first 2 years of life.<br>
</p>
<h4>2 YEARS AND OLDER:</h4>
<p>* Provide a variety of foods, including plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.<br>
* Use salt (sodium) and sugars in moderation.<br>
* Encourage a diet low in fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol.<br>
* Help your child maintain a healthy weight by providing proper foods and encouraging regular exercise.<br>
</p>
<h4>Dental/Oral Health</h4>
<p>Your child needs regular dental care starting at an early age. Talk with your dentist to schedule the first visit. Good oral health 
requires good daily care. Follow these guidelines.<br>
</p>
<h4>FOR BABIES:</h4>
<p>* If most of your child's nutrition comes from breast feeding, or if you live in an area with too little fluoride in the drinking water 
(less than .3 ppm for children less than 2 years old, less than .7 ppm for children over 2 years old), your child may need fluoride 
drops or tablets. Ask your health care provider or local water department about the amount of fluoride in your water and note it 
here:____ ppm.<br>
* Don't use a baby bottle as a pacifier or put your child to sleep with a baby bottle. This can cause tooth decay and ear 
infections.<br>
* Keep your infant's teeth and gums clean by wiping with a moist cloth after feeding.<br>
* When multiple teeth appear, begin gently brushing your infant's teeth using a soft toothbrush and a very small (pea-sized) 
amount of toothpaste with fluoride.<br>
</p>
<h4>FOR OLDER CHILDREN:</h4>
<p>* Talk with your dentist about dental sealants. They can help prevent cavities in permanent teeth.<br>
* Using dental floss can help prevent gum disease. Talk with your dentist about when to start.<br>
* Do not permit your child to smoke or chew tobacco. Set a good example and don't smoke yourself.<br>
* If a permanent tooth is knocked out, rinse it gently and put it back into the socket or into a glass of cold milk or water. See a 
dentist immediately.<br>
</p>
<h4>Physical Activity</h4>
<p>Your child needs regular physical activity through play and sports to stay fit. Good exercise habits learned early can help your 
child become an active and healthy adult. Adults who are physically active are less likely to be overweight or to have heart 
disease, high blood pressure, and other diseases. Set a good example for your child-get regular physical exercise yourself.<br>
</p>
<h4>Physical Activity Tips for Children</h4>
<p>* Encourage your child to walk or ride a bicycle to school and to visit friends.<br>
* Plan physical activities with family or friends; exercise is more fun with others.<br>
* Limit the time your child spends watching TV to less than 2 hours per day. Encourage going out to a playground, park, gym, or 
swimming pool instead.<br>
* Encourage your child to be actively involved in sports, rather than only being an observer.<br>
* Find out about exercise or sports programs at your child's school and in your community.<br>
* Encourage children with disabilities to participate in physical activities as much as possible.<br>
* Exercise should be fun. Don't make winning the only goal.<br>
</p>
<h4>Smoking</h4>
<p>Smoking is very harmful to your health (causing lung cancer, heart disease, and other serious illnesses) and to your child's health. 
If you smoke, your child is more likely to get infections of the ears, sinuses, and lungs. Smoking in the home may also cause lung 
cancer in family members who do not smoke.<br>
Do not permit your child to smoke. Set a good example and don't smoke yourself. If you do smoke, talk with your doctor or 
other health care provider about getting help with quitting.</p>
<p>Quit Date: I will stop smoking on: (fill in) ________<br>
_________________________________________________________ <br>
The three reasons that I should stop smoking are: (fill in)<br>
1._______________________________________________________<br>
2._______________________________________________________<br>
3._______________________________________________________ <br>
</p>
<h4>Safety</h4>
<p>More children die from injuries than any other cause. The good news is that most injuries can be prevented by following simple 
safety guidelines. Talk with your doctor or other health care provider about ways to protect your child from injuries. Fill out this 
safety checklist.<br>
</p>
<h4>Safety Guidelines Checklist</h4>
<p>Read the list below and check off (+) each guideline that your family already follows. Work on those you don't.<br>
</p>
<h4>FOR ALL AGES:</h4>
<p>* Use smoke detectors in your home. Change the batteries every year and check to see that they work once a month.<br>
* Keeping a gun in your home can be dangerous. If you do, make sure that the gun and ammunition are locked up separately and 
kept out of reach.<br>
* Never drive after drinking alcohol.<br>
* Teach your child traffic safety. Children under 9 years of age need supervision when crossing streets.<br>
* Learn basic life-saving skills (CPR).<br>
* Keep a bottle of ipecac at home to treat poisoning. Talk with a doctor or the local Poison Control Center before using it. Post 
the Poison Control Center number near your telephone and write it in the space provided on the inside front cover.<br>
</p>
<h4>INFANTS AND YOUNG CHILDREN:</h4>
<p>* Use a car safety seat at all times until your child weighs at least 40 pounds. When possible, secure it in the center of the back 
seat.<br>
* Keep medicines, cleaning solutions, and other dangerous substances in childproof containers, locked up and out of reach.<br>
* Use safety gates across stairways (top and bottom) and guards on windows above the first floor.<br>
* Keep hot water heater temperatures below 120 F.<br>
* Keep unused electrical outlets covered with plastic guards.<br>
* Baby walkers can be dangerous. Children using them should be closely supervised. Access should be blocked to stairways 
and to objects that can fall (such as lamps) or cause burns (such as stoves).<br>
* Keep objects and foods that can cause choking away from your child, such as coins, balloons, small toy parts, hot dogs 
(unmashed), peanuts, and hard candies.<br>
* Use fences that go all the way around pools and keep gates to pools locked.<br>
</p>
<h4>A SPECIAL MESSAGE ABOUT SIDS</h4>
<p>Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) is the leading cause of death for infants. Some authorities believe that placing sleeping 
infants on the side or back, instead of the stomach, decreases the risk of SIDS.<br>
</p>
<h4>FOR OLDER CHILDREN:</h4>
<p>* Use car safety belts at all times. Use with a booster seat if your child weighs less than 70 lbs. The lap belt should be snug and 
low on the hips. The shoulder belt should cross the chest, not the face, neck, or stomach. If it does not fit properly, tuck it behind 
the shoulders instead.<br>
* Make sure your child uses a safety helmet while riding on a bicycle or motorcycle.<br>
* Make sure your child uses protective equipment (such as mouth guards, pads, sports goggles, and helmets) when playing 
contact sports, rollerskating, or skateboarding.<br>
* Don't let your child use alcohol or illegal drugs. Many driving, sports, and violence-related injuries are caused by the use of 
alcohol or drugs.<br>
* Read all instructions for safe handling of household tools, such as saws and lawn mowers. Teach your child to use these tools 
safely.<br>
* Don't allow your child to ride on or drive heavy farm equipment, such as tractors, without special training.<br>
* Teach your child to deal with anger and conflict without using violence. Set a good example for your child.<br>
</p>
<h4>Child Abuse</h4>
<p>Child abuse is a hidden, serious problem. It can happen in any family. The scars, both physical and emotional, can last for a 
lifetime. Because children can't protect themselves, we must protect them.<br>
</p>
<h4>Ways to Prevent Child Abuse</h4>
<p>* Teach your child not to let anyone touch his or her private parts.<br>
* Tell your child to say &quot;No&quot; and run away from sexual touches.<br>
* Take any reports by your child of physical or sexual abuse seriously. Report any abuse to your local or state child protection 
agency. Local Hotline:______________________________________<br>
* If you feel angry and out of control, leave the room, take a walk, take deep breaths, or count to 100. Don't drink alcohol or 
take drugs. These can make your anger harder to control.<br>
* If you are afraid you might harm your child, get help now! Call someone and ask for help. Talk with a friend or relative, other 
parents, or your health care professional. Take time for yourself. Share child care between parents, trade baby-sitting with 
friends, or use day care.<br>
</p>
<h4>As Your Child Grows Up</h4>
<p>As your child grows up, he or she will have to begin dealing with many important health issues not included in the Child Health 
Guide. Some examples of these issues are:<br>
* Alcohol<br>
* Drugs<br>
* Tobacco<br>
* Sexuality<br>
* AIDS<br>
* Birth Control<br>
Talk to your child's doctor or other health care provider about these important issues even while your child is still young. You 
may also get assistance from authorities listed on the next two pages.<br>
Start early to teach your child to make responsible choices--not mistakes that can have a lifelong effect. Take the time to &quot;be 
there for your child--listening, advising, and supporting. The rewards will be well worth the effort.<br>
</p>
<h4>For More Information</h4>
<p>If you would like more information about how to help your child stay healthy, talk with your child's doctor or other heath care 
provider. You can also get information by calling your local health department (look in the phone book) or the authorities listed 
below, many of which have toll-free numbers.<br>
</p>
<h4>AIDS</h4>

<h3>A Reprint from FDA Consumer Magazine Printed December 1993. PUBLICATION NO. 
(FDA) 94-1213</h3>
<h2>CHOOSING A CONTRACEPTIVE</h2>
<p>(This article originally appeared in the September 1993 FDA Consumer.)<br>
Choosing a method of birth control is a highly personal decision, based on individual preferences, medical history, lifestyle, and 
other factors. Each method carries with it a number of risks and benefits of which the user should be aware.</p>
<p>Each method of birth control has a failure rate--an inability to prevent pregnancy over a one-year period. Sometimes the failure 
rate is due to the method and sometimes it is due to human error, such as incorrect use or not using it at all. Each method has 
possible side effects, some minor and some serious. Some methods require lifestyle modifications, such as remembering to use 
the method with each and every sexual intercourse. Some cannot be used by individuals with certain medical problems.</p>
<h4>Spermicides Used Alone</h4>
<p>Spermicides. which come in many forms--foams, jellies, gels, and suppositories-work by forming a physical and chemical barrier 
to sperm. They should be inserted into the vagina within an hour before intercourse. If intercourse is repeated. more spermicide 
should be inserted. The active ingredient in most spermicides is the chemical nonoxynol-9. The failure rate for spermicides in 
preventing pregnancy when used alone is from 20 to 30 percent.</p>
<p>Spermicides are available without a prescription. People who experience burning or irritation with these products should not use 
them.</p>
<h4>Barrier Methods</h4>
<p>There are five barrier methods of contraception: male condoms, female condoms, diaphragm, sponge, and cervical cap. In each 
instance, the method works by keeping the sperm and egg apart. Usually, these methods have only minor side effects. The main 
possible side effect is an allergic reaction either to the material of the barrier or the spermicides that should be used with them. 
Using the methods correctly for each and every sexual intercourse gives the best protection. For many people, the prevention of 
sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), including HIV (human immunodeficiency virus), which leads to AIDS, is a factor in 
choosing a contraceptive. Only one form of birth control currently available--the latex condom, worn by the man--is considered 
highly effective in helping protect against HIV and other STDs. FDA has approved the marketing of male condoms made from 
polyurethane as also effective in preventing STDs, including HIV. However, at press time, they were not yet being sold in this 
country. Reality Female Condom, made from polyurethane, may give limited protection against STDs but has not been proven as 
effective as male latex condoms. People who use another form of birth control but who also want a highly effective way to 
reduce their STD risks, should also use a latex condom for every sex act, from start to finish.</p>
<p>In April 1993, FDA announced that birth control pills, Norplant, Depo-Provera, IUDs, and natural membrane condoms must 
carry labeling stating that these products are intended to prevent pregnancy but do not protect against HIV infection and other 
sexually transmitted diseases. In addition, natural membrane condom labeling must state that consumers should use a latex 
condom to help reduce the transmission of STDs. The labeling of latex condoms states that, if used properly, they will help 
reduce transmission of HIV and other diseases. Most condom failures can be traced to improper use.</p>
<h4>Male Condom</h4>
<p>A male condom is a sheath that covers the penis during sex. Condoms on the market at press time were made of either latex 
rubber or natural skin (also called &quot;lambskin&quot; but actually made from sheep intestines). Of these two types, only latex condoms 
have been shown to be highly effective in helping to prevent STDs. Latex provides a good barrier to even small viruses such as 
human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis B. Each condom can only be used once. Condoms have a birth control failure rate 
of about 15 percent. Most of the failures can be traced to improper use.</p>
<p>Some condoms have spermicide added. This may give some additional contraceptive protection. Vaginal spermicides may also 
be added before sexual intercourse.</p>
<p>Some condoms have lubricants added. These do not improve birth control or STD protection. Non-oil-based lubricants can also 
be used with condoms. However, oil-based lubricants such as petroleum jelly (Vaseline) should not be used because they 
weaken the latex. Condoms are available without a prescription.</p>
<h4>Female Condom</h4>
<p>The Reality Female Condom was approved by FDA in April 1993. It consists of a lubricated polyurethane sheath with a flexible 
polyurethane ring on each end.</p>
<p>One ring is inserted into the vagina much like a diaphragm, while the other remains outside, partially covering the labia. The 
female condom may offer some protection against STDs, but for highly effective protection, male latex condoms must be used. 
(The female condom should not be used at the same time as the male condom because they will not both stay in place.)</p>
<p>FDA Commissioner David A. Kessler, M.D., in announcing the approval, said, &quot;I have to stress that the male latex condom 
remains the best shield against AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases. Couples should go on using the male latex 
condom.&quot;</p>
<p>In a six-month trial, the pregnancy rate for the Reality Female Condom was about 13 percent. The estimated yearly failure rate 
ranges from 21 to 26 percent. This means that about 1 in 4 women who use Reality may become pregnant during a year.</p>
<h4>Sponge</h4>
<p>The contraceptive sponge, approved by FDA in 1983, is made of white polyurethane foam. The sponge, shaped like a small 
doughnut, contains the spermicide nonoxynol-9. Like the diaphragm, it is inserted into the vagina to cover the cervix during and 
after intercourse. It does not require fitting by a health professional and is available without prescription. It is to be used only 
once and then discarded. The failure rate is between 18 and 28 percent. An extremely rare side effect is toxic shock syndrome 
(TSS), a potentially fatal infection caused by a strain of the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus and more commonly associated 
with tampon use.</p>
<h4>Diaphragm</h4>
<p>The diaphragm is a flexible rubber disk with a rigid rim. Diaphragms range in size from 2 to 4 inches in diameter and are designed 
to cover the cervix during and after intercourse so that sperm cannot reach the uterus. Spermicidal jelly or cream must be placed 
inside the diaphragm for it to be effective.</p>
<p>The diaphragm must be fitted by a health professional and the correct size prescribed to ensure a snug seal with the vaginal wall. 
If intercourse is repeated, additional spermicide should be added with the diaphragm still in place. The diaphragm should be left 
in place for at least six hours after intercourse. The diaphragm used with spermicide has a failure rate of from 6 to 18 percent.</p>
<p>Barrier methods, which work by keeping the sperm and egg apart, usually have only minor side effects.</p>
<p>In addition to the possible allergic reactions or irritation common to all barrier methods, there have been some reports of bladder 
infections with this method. As with the contraceptive sponge, TSS is an extremely rare side effect.</p>
<h4>Cervical Cap</h4>
<p>The cervical cap, approved for contraceptive use in the United States in 1988, is a dome-shaped rubber cap in various sizes that 
fits snugly over the cervix. Like the diaphragm, it is used with a spermicide and must be fitted by a health professional. It is more 
difficult to insert than the diaphragm, but may be left in place for up to 48 hours. In addition to the allergic reactions that can 
occur with any barrier method. 5.2 to 27 percent of users in various studies have reported an unpleasant odor and/or discharge. 
There also appears to be an increased incidence of irregular Pap tests in the first six months of using the cap, and TSS is an 
extremely rare side effect. The cap has a failure rate of about 18 percent.</p>
<h4>Hormonal Contraception</h4>
<p>Hormonal contraception involves ways of delivering forms of two female reproductive hormones--estrogen and 
progestogen--that help regulate ovulation (release of an egg), the condition of the uterine lining, and other parts of the menstrual 
cycle. Unlike barrier methods, hormones are not inert, do interact with the body, and have the potential for serious side effects, 
though this is rare. When properly used, hormonal methods are also extremely effective. Hormonal methods are available only by 
prescription.</p>
<h4>Birth Control Pills</h4>
<p>There are two types of birth control pills: combination pills, which contain both estrogen and a progestin (a natural or synthetic 
progesterone), and &quot;mini-pills,&quot; which contain only progestin. The combination pill prevents ovulation, while the mini-pill reduces 
cervical mucus and causes it to thicken. This prevents the sperm from reaching the egg. Also, progestins keep the endometfium 
(uterine lining) from thickening. This prevents the fertilized egg from implanting in the uterus. The failure rate for the mini-pill is 1 
to 3 percent; for the combination pill it is 1 to 2 percent.</p>
<p>Combination oral contraceptives offer significant protection against ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, iron-deficiency anemia, 
pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), and fibrocystic breast disease. Women who take combination pills have a lower risk of 
functional ovarian cysts.</p>
<h4>Birth Control Pills</h4>
<p>The decision about whether to take an oral contraceptive should be made only after consultation with a health professional. 
Smokers and women with certain medical conditions should not take the pill. These conditions include: a history of blood clots in 
the legs, eyes, or deep veins of the legs; heart attacks, strokes, or angina; cancer of the breast, vagina, cervix, or uterus; any 
undiagnosed, abnormal vaginal bleeding; liver tumors; or jaundice due to pregnancy or use of birth control pills. Women with the 
following conditions should discuss with a health professional whether the benefits of the pill outweigh its risks for them:</p>
<ul>
<li>high blood pressure </li>
<li>heart, kidney or gallbladder disease </li>
<li>a family history of heart attack or stroke </li>
<li>severe headaches or depression </li>
<li>elevated cholesterol or triglycerides &Agrave;&Agrave; epilepsy &Agrave;&Agrave; diabetes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Serious side effects of the pill include blood clots that can lead to stroke, heart attack, pulmonary embolism, or death. A clot 
may, on rare occasions, occur in the blood vessel of the eye, causing impaired vision or even blindness. The pills may also cause 
high blood pressure that returns to normal after oral contraceptives are stopped. Minor side effects, which usually subside after a 
few months' use, include: nausea, headaches, breast swelling, fluid retention, weight gain, irregular bleeding, and depression. 
Sometimes taking a pill with a lower dose of hormones can reduce these effects.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of birth control pills may be reduced by a few other medications, including some antibiotics, barbiturates, and 
antifungal medications. On the other hand, birth control pills may prolong the effects of theophylline and caffeine. They also may 
prolong the effects of benzodiazepines such as Librium (chlordiazepoxide), Valium (diazepam), and Xanax (alprazolam). 
Because of the variety of these drug interactions, women should always tell their health professionals when they are taking birth 
control pills.</p>
<p>Methods of hormonal contraception, when used properly, are extremely effective.</p>
<h4>Norplant</h4>
<p>Norplant--the first contraceptive implant-was approved by FDA in 1990. In a minor surgical procedure, six matchstick-sized 
rubber capsules containing progestin are placed just underneath the skin of the upper arm. The implant is effective within 24 
hours and provides progestin for up to five years or until it is removed. Both the insertion and the removal must be performed by 
a qualified professional.</p>
<p>Because contraception is automatic and does not depend on the user, the failure rate for Norplant is less than 1 percent for 
women who weigh less than 150 pounds. Women who weigh more have a higher pregnancy rate after the first two years.</p>
<p>Women who cannot take birth control pills for medical reasons should not consider Norplant a contraceptive option. The 
potential side effects of the implant include: irregular menstrual bleeding, headaches, nervousness, depression, nausea, dizziness, 
skin rash, acne, change of appetite, breast tenderness, weight gain, enlargement of the ovaries or fallopian tubes, and excessive 
growth of body and facial hair. These side effects may subside after the first year.</p>
<h4>Depo-Provera</h4>
<p>Depo-Provera is an injectable form of a progestin. It was approved by FDA in 1992 for contraceptive use. Previously, it was 
approved for treating endometrial and renal cancers. Depo-Provera has a failure rate of only 1 percent. Each injection provides 
contraceptive protection for 14 weeks. It is injected every three months into a muscle in the buttocks or arm by a trained 
professional. The side effects are the same as those for Norplant and progestin-only pills. In addition, there may be irregular 
bleeding and spotting during the first months followed by periods of amenorrhea (no menstrual period). About 50 percent of the 
women who use Depo-Provera for one year or longer report amenorrhea. Other side effects, such as weight gain and others 
described for Norplant, may occur.</p>
<h4>Intrauterine Devices</h4>
<p>IUDs are small, plastic, flexible devices that are inserted into the uterus through the cervix by a trained clinician. Only two IUDs 
are presently marketed in the United States: ParaGard T380A, a T-shaped device partially covered by copper and effective for 
eight years; and Progestasert, which is also T-shaped but contains a progestin released over a one-year period. After that time, 
the IUD should be replaced. Both IUDs have a 4 to 5 percent failure rate.</p>
<p>It is not known exactly how IUDs work. At one time it was thought that the IUD affected the uterus so that it would be 
inhospitable to implantation. New evidence, however, suggests that uterine and tubal fluids are altered, particularly in the case of 
copper-bearing IUDs, inhibiting the transport of sperm through the cervical mucus and uterus.</p>
<p>The risk of PID with IUD use is highest in those with multiple sex partners or with a history of previous PID. Therefore, the IUD 
is recommended primarily for women in mutually monogamous relationships.</p>
<p>In addition to PID, other complications include perforation of the uterus (usually at the time of insertion), septic abortion, or 
ectopic (tubal) pregnancy. Women may also experience some short-term side effects--cramping and dizziness at the time of 
insertion; bleeding, cramps and backache that may continue for a few days after the insertion; spotting between periods; and 
longer and heavier menstruation during the first few periods after insertion.</p>
<h4>Periodic Abstinence</h4>
<p>Periodic abstinence entails not having sexual intercourse during the woman's fertile period. Sometimes this method is called 
natural family planning (NFP) or &quot;rhythm.&quot; Using periodic abstinence is dependent on the ability to identify the approximately 10 
days in each menstrual cycle that a woman is fertile. Methods to help determine this include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The basal body temperature method is based on the knowledge that just before ovulation a woman's basal body 
temperature drops several tenths of a degree and after ovulation it returns to normal. The method requires that the woman 
take her temperature each morning before she gets out of bed. There are now electronic thermometers with memories and 
electrical resistance meters that can more accurately pinpoint a woman's fertile period. </li>
<li>The cervical mucus method, also called the Billings method, depends on a woman recognizing the changes in cervical 
mucus that indicate ovulation is occurring or has occurred.</li>
</ul>
<p>Periodic abstinence has a failure rate of 14 to 47 percent. It has none of the side effects of artificial methods of contraception.</p>
<h4>Surgical Sterilization</h4>
<p>Surgical sterilization must be considered permanent. Tubal ligation seals a woman's fallopian tubes so that an egg cannot travel to 
the uterus. Vasectomy involves closing off a man's vas deferens so that sperm will not be carried to the penis.</p>
<p>Vasectomy is considered safer than female sterilization. It is a minor surgical procedure, most often performed in a doctor's office 
under local anesthesia. The procedure usually takes less than 30 minutes. Minor post-surgical complications may occur.</p>
<p>Tubal ligation is an operating-room procedure performed under general anesthesia. The fallopian tubes can be reached by a 
number of surgical techniques, and, depending on the technique, the operation is sometimes an outpatient procedure or requires 
only an overnight stay. In a minilaparotomy, a 2-inch incision is made in the abdomen. The surgeon, using special instruments, lifts 
the fallopian tubes and, using clips, a plastic ring, or an electric current, seals the tubes. Another method, laparoscopy, involves 
making a small incision above the navel, and distending the abdominal cavity so that the intestine separates from the uterus and 
fallopian tubes. Then a laparoscope--a miniaturized, flexible telescope--is used to visualize the fallopian tubes while closing them 
off.</p>
<p>Both of these methods are replacing the traditional laparotomy.</p>
<p>Major complications, which are rare in female sterilization, include: infection, hemorrhage, and problems associated with the use 
of general anesthesia. It is estimated that major complications occur in 1.7 percent of the cases, while the overall complication 
rate has been reported to be between 0.1 and 15.3 percent.</p>
<p>The failure rate of laparoscopy and minilaparotomy procedures, as well as vasectomy, is less than 1 percent. Although there has 
been some success in reopening the fallopian tubes or the vas deferens, the success rate is low, and sterilization should be 
considered irreversible.</p>

States and developing countries, for the last 25 years.</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Cosmetic Surgery -- September 1992</h2>
<p>In the quest to look better, millions of Americans are turning to cosmetic surgery. Each year, more consumers elect to have their 
faces lifted, their stomachs &quot;tucked,&quot; or their thighs slimmed. In response to this growing demand, many doctors now widely 
advertise their ability to surgically correct the less-than-perfect parts of one's anatomy. The majority of surgeons performing 
cosmetic surgery are qualified and perform successful operations. However, doctors with insufficient training or experience or 
questionable credentials also are attracted to this field because of the millions of consumer dollars spent annually on cosmetic 
surgery.</p>
<p>As with all surgical procedures, cosmetic surgery carries with it certain risks. If performed poorly, it can be disfiguring or even 
life-threatening. It is essential, therefore, to select a doctor who is well-trained and experienced in performing the specific 
procedure you want. The following information may help you if you are considering cosmetic surgery.</p>
<h4>How Do You Choose the Right Doctor?</h4>
<p>Before beginning your search, you may want to learn more about surgical options by reviewing books on cosmetic surgery that 
can be found in your local library and discussing your plans with your family physician. If you decide to pursue cosmetic surgery, 
ask your physician for the names of qualified surgeons. You also can obtain names of appropriate physicians by calling your local 
hospital or consulting the ABMS Compendium of Certified Medical Specialists or the Directory of Medical Specialists available 
in most libraries.</p>
<p>Plan to consult with several surgeons who specialize in the type of cosmetic surgery procedure you want. While this may seem a 
considerable investment of time and money (most physicians will charge a consultation fee), remember that if the operation is not 
performed properly, you could carry the scars for life.</p>
<p>Be wary of physicians who suggest that you have features &quot;fixed&quot; that do not bother you, use a hard sell to obtain your business, 
or brush aside your concerns about safety. In addition, no responsible doctor should mind your asking the following questions.</p>
<p>What is your area of specialty and what training do you have in the specific cosmetic surgery procedure I want?</p>
<p>Make sure the doctor you choose is well-trained to perform the type of surgery you want. Ask where the doctor earned a 
medical degree and in what specialty the doctor completed an accredited residency program. Ask for information on how this 
training relates to the specific procedure you want, as well as what fellowships, workshops, and other education programs 
pertinent to your operation the physician has completed.</p>
<p>Finally, find out if the doctor is certified by an appropriate medical board. A board tests the level of physicians' knowledge in 
specific specialties. Normally, before qualifying to take the exams in a particular specialty, physicians must first complete a formal 
residency training program in that field. Those who pass the voluntary exams are considered &quot;certified&quot; in that area of expertise. 
Confirm the physician's credentials and board affiliation with your county medical society or state medical board.</p>
<p>Do you have hospital privileges?</p>
<p>Even if the surgery you want will be performed in the doctor's office or clinic, ask if the doctor is on staff at a local hospital and 
has privileges there to perform that procedure. Hospital privileges generally assure that the physician you select has been 
reviewed by his or her peers.</p>
<p>How many operations like mine have you performed in the past year? During your career?</p>
<p>No matter how good the doctor's credentials, a doctor skilled in facial surgery may not be the best one to perform breast surgery 
or hair transplants. Find a doctor who has experience specifically in the procedure you want.</p>
<p>How many of your patients have needed additional surgery?</p>
<p>Additional surgery is sometimes needed to correct problems arising from the original operation. An ethical surgeon will answer 
this question. He or she also will answer questions about the probability of problems and tell you whether there will be an 
additional charge in the event more surgery is required.</p>
<p>How safe is this operation?</p>
<p>Nobody can guarantee an absolutely successful outcome to any surgical procedure--and you should be suspicious of anyone 
who does. All surgery involves some risk and unpredictability. Although rare, people have been known to die or suffer from 
life-limiting disabilities after cosmetic surgery. The physician should explain all the possible risks and complications associated 
with the procedure, as well as their degree of probability.</p>
<p>What are the potential side effects of my surgical procedure? How long will these last?</p>
<p>Many doctors agree that patients are often unprepared for the side effects that may occur after cosmetic surgery. These include 
pain, scarring, swelling, bruising, bleeding, infection--or worse. Some patients may not be able to resume their normal activities 
for weeks after their operation. Be certain to have the physician you choose explain the potential side effects of your procedure.</p>
<p>What should I expect before, during, and after my operation?</p>
<p>Have your doctor and nursing staff explain in detail what to expect at every stage of the procedure. If they are not willing to 
spend the time needed to address all of your questions and concerns, then you should probably look elsewhere.</p>
<p>Information materials such as brochures and videotapes should be available for you to read or view. If your physician uses 
&quot;computer imaging&quot; to show what changes you can expect from surgery, note that drawing on a &quot;TV screen&quot; can be very 
different from working with real flesh and bone. The computerized image you see may not be exactly what you get.</p>
<p>The same is true of pre- and post-operative photographs of other patients. Before-and-after photos may give you some feel for 
the surgeon's skill, but every patient's physical characteristics and experience are different.</p>
<p>Will you perform the operation yourself? Who will administer the anesthesia? Where will my operation take place?</p>
<p>Make sure that you talk to the doctor who will perform your surgery and ask who will take care of you after the operation. Find 
out what type of anesthesia will be used and who will administer it. Be certain the individual is qualified to administer the 
anesthesia.</p>
<p>Where will your surgery take place?</p>
<p>If your physician suggests his or her office or clinic, ask about the facility's equipment for life-support and other emergencies. If 
you are having major surgery, you may want to seek extra protection by making sure the facility is approved by one of the three 
accrediting organizations listed under For More Information.</p>
<p>What are your fees?</p>
<p>Find out in advance what the procedure and follow-up care will cost. If your surgery will be performed in a hospital or 
ambulatory surgical center, remember that in addition to your doctor's fee, there will be a charge for use of the facility and the 
services of the anesthesiologist.</p>
<p>Insurance usually does not cover costs for elective cosmetic surgery, and many doctors require payment in advance. Therefore, 
you may want to compare fees. But just because a surgeon charges higher prices does not mean he or she is better than other 
physicians.</p>
<p>How realistic are my own expectations for this operation?</p>
<p>Most doctors consider the best candidates for elective cosmetic surgery to be those who are well-adjusted and emotionally 
secure. Ideal patients desire the operation to enhance their own self-esteem--not to influence the opinions of others. Although 
greater self-confidence may lead to other enhancements in life, consumers who hope cosmetic surgery will help add excitement 
to their social lives, win back a spouse, or obtain a promotion at work are often disappointed. Discuss with your doctor what 
you hope to accomplish with surgery and whether your goals are realistic.</p>
<p>Can I contact former patients who have had the same surgical procedure I want?</p>
<p>Talking to former patients who have had the same procedure you desire is one way to learn more about the operation and your 
doctor. But keep in mind that each patient has different physical characteristics and expectations. Although a physician may have 
good results with one person, that does not guarantee your surgery will turn out the same.</p>
<h4>What Are Some Common Cosmetic Surgery Procedures and Their Potential Risks?</h4>
<p>Before having any operation, it is important to have realistic expectations about the benefits that can be achieved and understand 
the possible risks and side effects. Those issues should be discussed thoroughly with your surgeon. Below is a brief, simplified 
overview of some of the potential complications and side effects of common cosmetic surgery procedures. It cannot substitute 
for a consultation with a properly-trained physician.</p>
<p>Any of these operations can result in infection or blood collecting beneath the skin, conditions requiring additional treatment and, 
in a few cases, further hospitalization. In rare instances, permanent and conspicuous scarring can result. Further, although many 
of these operations are not done under general anesthesia, those that are carry additional risks.</p>
<p>Face lift (rhytidectomy): Although a face lift can improve some signs of aging, surgery will not stop the aging process. Following 
the operation, there may be significant puffiness and bruising for several weeks, and some individuals may feel a temporary 
numbness or tightness in the face or neck. Nerve damage that causes permanent loss of sensation or movement in the facial 
muscles can occur in rare instances.</p>
<p>The scars resulting from a face lift are normally in the hairline and folds of the ear, and usually lighten with time until they are 
barely visible. The kind of scars cannot be predicted with total accuracy, because everyone heals differently.</p>
<p>Nose surgery (rhinoplasty): Changing the shape of the nose is one of the most complex procedures, even for a skilled surgeon. If 
too much cartilage or bone is removed, the nose can look misshapen. Additionally, if care is not taken with the internal structure 
of the nose, you can end up with a nose that does not function correctly. Before the operation, make sure you and your doctor 
thoroughly discuss what kinds of changes you would like and how the changes will &quot;fit in&quot; with your other facial features.</p>
<p>It can take several weeks for bruising around the eyes to go away and several months for any swelling that occurs to completely 
disappear. You may experience some difficulty breathing for some weeks following the procedure.</p>
<p>Eyelid surgery (blepharoplasty): Performed to remove excess skin and fat above and below the eyes, this procedure usually 
causes bruising that fades within a week to ten days. However, discoloration can last for several weeks. The physician must be 
very careful not to remove too much skin, which could cause too much &quot;white of the eye&quot; to show. In addition, though rare, risks 
include dry eye syndrome (the eyes stop making tears) and drooping of the lower lid.</p>
<p>Hair transplants: The most common of these procedures, called punch grafting, is performed by transplanting small pieces of skin 
with healthy hair follicles to bald spots. This process may be repeated several times over a period of 8 to 18 months. Common 
temporary aftereffects include pain, swelling, bruising, and the formation of crusts on the scalp. In another technique, called scalp 
reduction, part of the bald scalp's skin is removed, and the skin with hair is stretched and sutured together over this area. Some 
discomfort, including headaches and scalp tightening, may follow for a short time. Less frequently, flap surgery is performed by 
rotating wide strips of skin with hair to cover areas where bald skin has been removed. In another procedure, the hair-bearing 
scalp tissue may be expanded so that the enlarged tissue can replace the bald area. The latter two procedures require general 
anesthesia, and more serious complications, such as damage to tissue, can result.</p>
<p>Breast augmentation (enlargement): In this procedure, silicone envelopes filled with salt water (saline solution), silicone gel, or a 
combination of both can be implanted to enlarge the breasts.</p>
<p>In April 1992, the FDA announced that because it continues to be concerned about the safety of silicone gel-filled breast 
implants, all patients to receive these implants must be enrolled in clinical studies. Silicone implants for the purpose of breast 
augmentation will be available only to a very limited number of women. (Women who need the implants for breast reconstruction 
will be assured access to the studies.) The FDA made this decision because it determined that manufacturers of silicone implants 
have not proven that these devices are safe. As of May 1992, saline-filled implants continue to be freely available. In the future, 
manufacturers of saline-implants will be required to submit data to the FDA to prove that these devices are safe and effective in 
order to continue marketing these devices. Known risks of saline-filled implants include the possibility of infection, hardening of 
the scar tissue surrounding the implant, formation of calcium deposits in the surrounding tissues, implant rupture, and interference 
with the detection of early breast cancer. Evaluating the risks and benefits of breast implants can be a difficult issue. Discuss this 
issue thoroughly with your doctor. You also may want to contact the FDA at the address or telephone number listed underFor 
More Information.</p>
<p>Breast reduction: With breast reduction or lift surgery (mastopexy), there will be some degree of scarring, and there may be 
unevenness in breast size. You will want to ask your physician about this and other possible effects, such as a temporary or 
permanent change in nipple sensation or a decreased ability to breast-feed.</p>
<p>Tummy tuck&quot; (abdominoplasty): The common nickname for this procedure--which removes excess, sagging skin and underlying 
fat from the abdomen--belies the fact that it is major surgery normally done under general anesthesia. An incision is made from 
hip bone to hip bone and, although it is located low along the &quot;bikini line,&quot; a significant scar results. Full recovery, as with other 
major surgery, may take a couple of months or longer.</p>
<p>Injections: Facial wrinkles may be treated by injecting them with collagen or fat. Neither substance produces permanent results, 
and the longevity of the results depends on the patient's skin and reaction to the substance. People may be allergic to collagen 
and not know it. Also, the FDA is investigating whether there is a cause-and-effect relationship between having collagen 
treatments and later developing &quot;PM/DM&quot; (chronic, progressive, sometimes fatal inflammatory disorders) or similar diseases.</p>
<p>The injection of liquid silicone has not been approved by the FDA for any purpose, and the FDA prohibits manufacturers and 
doctors from marketing or promoting this product.</p>
<p>Chemical Peels and Dermabrasion: These two techniques may be used to treat scarring (such as those from acne or skin injury), 
skin wrinkles, or splotchy pigmentation. To perform chemical peels, an acid or other agent is applied to destroy the top layers of 
skin. Temporary pain, swelling, and redness may result. Dermabrasion is performed by using machines that remove the top layers 
of skin. This helps smooth skin irregularities. Treated skin may be sensitive to sunlight. Risks include scarring and uneven 
pigmentation which, in rare cases, may be long-term or permanent.</p>
<p>Liposuction (suction-assisted lipectomy): To perform this very popular procedure, a doctor inserts a thin tube into a fatty part of 
the body and, using a special vacuum pump, suctions out unwanted fat, leaving a flattened area with little scarring. The growing 
popularity of the procedure has attracted many physicians with widely varying training and experience. There have been reports 
of blood clots, fluid loss, infection, and even death following liposuction. Make certain the doctor you choose is well-trained and 
experienced in performing this procedure. Contrary to popular belief, liposuction is:</p>
<p>Not a substitute for good routines of diet and exercise. Ideal candidates are close to their ideal weight, but have pockets of 
resistant fat on their hips, thighs, abdomens, or chin.</p>
<p>Not a cure for &quot;cellulite,&quot; the popular term for the dimpled skin often found on the thighs.</p>
<p>Not a solution for people with stretched-out, inelastic skin that cannot redrape around body contours.</p>
<p>If you are a good candidate and proceed with the surgery, you will need to wear a girdle or other compression garment until any 
bruising and swelling disappear.</p>
<h4>For More Information</h4>
<p>The FDA can provide further detailed information about breast implants, collagen injections, and liquid silicone injections. To 
obtain this information, send a postcard to: &quot;Breast Implants&quot; or &quot;Collagen and Liquid Silicone Injections,&quot; FDA, HFE-88, 5600 
Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857. The FDA also has a toll-free hotline on breast implants: 1-800-532-4440. For the hearing 
impaired, the number is 1-800-688-6167.</p>
<p>If the physician you choose suggests that your operation be performed in his or her office, check with one of the following 
organizations to see if the facility has passed an inspection: the Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care, Inc. 
(708-676-9610); the American Association for Accreditation of Ambulatory Plastic Surgery Facilities (708-949-6058); or the 
Joint Commission for the Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (312-642-6061).</p>
<p>After surgery, if you have a problem that cannot be resolved with the physician, contact your county medical society, state 
medical board, or your local consumer protection agency.</p>
<p>You may also report any problems to the Federal Trade Commission. Write: Service Industry Practices, FTC, 6th and 
Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20580. Although the FTC does not generally intervene in individual disputes, the 
information you provide may indicate a pattern of possible law violations requiring action by the Commission or referral to state 
authorities.</p>

<p>Are you looking for a way to lose weight -- quickly and easily? You may be tempted to try one of the widely advertised 
weight-loss programs that use liquid diets, require special diet regimens, or claim to have medically-qualified staff.</p>
<p>But, before you pay for any weight-loss program, take note: while many diet programs may help you lose weight, there is little 
published evidence that most people maintain that weight loss for any significant time.</p>
<p>Being obese has serious health consequences and losing weight can help reduce these risks. Some experts suggest that losing 
even 30 percent of excess weight can significantly decrease some obesity-related consequences.</p>
<p>If you want to lose weight permanently, scientific evidence suggests it is important to make lifelong changes in how you eat and 
exercise. The Council on Scientific Affairs of the American Medical Association says that only through gradual long-term 
changes like these can you effectively lose weight and keep it off.</p>
<p>Be skeptical, then, of approaches that promise easy, quick, or permanent weight loss. Such loss is likely to be short-term.</p>
<h4>The Diet Programs</h4>
<p>Dieting in the United States is a big business. A multi-billion dollar industry caters to approximately 34 million overweight 
American adults, millions of whom are dieting at any given time. As most dieters know, to lose a pound of weight, you need to 
reduce caloric intake or increase caloric demand by 3,500 calories. To help dieters do this, many professional weight-control 
programs offer special dietary and exercise plans, as well as psychological support. Many such programs are independently 
operated through local hospitals, clinics, and physician-specialists. Two widely-advertised programs are:</p>
<p>Very low calorie diet (VLCD) programs. VLCD programs generally use 400 to 800 calorie-a-day liquid diet formulas as part of 
a 12 to 16 week supplemented fast. They are often called &quot;semi-starvation&quot; diets. Available only through physicians in their 
offices or through hospital-based programs, VLCD programs require careful medical screening and constant medical 
supervision.</p>
<p>Most VLCD programs are targeted to people who are severely obese, those about 30 percent or more above their ideal body 
weight. Some VLCD programs now also accept individuals who are 20 percent or more above their ideal body weight. Typical 
weight loss may be around 3 pounds per week for women and 5 pounds per week for men. VLCD programs cost about $2,000 
to $3,000, but some expenses may be reimbursed through health insurance.</p>
<p>Diet clinics/food plans. Many of these programs are 1,000 to 1,500 calorie-a-day diets, where weight loss averages one or two 
pounds a week. You usually follow a carefully controlled menu plan. In some cases, you may be required to purchase 
specially-packaged meals available only from the company -- and not reimbursable through health insurance. The costs for these 
programs vary considerably, ranging from $250 to $1,000 or more. Be wary of initial low-price offers that may not include all 
costs.</p>
<h4>The Health Consequences</h4>
<p>Being obese has serious health consequences. Complications include increased risk of heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, 
diabetes, gallstones, some forms of cancer, and other illnesses.</p>
<p>Losing weight can help reduce these risks. In general, the more slowly you lose weight and the longer you maintain that weight 
loss, the safer that diet will be for you.</p>
<p>But dieting itself is not without risk. Studies have reported that patients on VLCD or other rapid-weight loss programs may run 
an increased chance of developing gallstones. Less severe consequences of dieting include: dizziness, diarrhea, constipation, 
fatigue, muscle cramps, bad breath, temporary hair loss, headaches, potassium deficiencies, and irregular menstrual cycles.</p>
<p>Because of the possible health complications associated with dieting, you may wish first to ask your physician whether a 
particular program is right for you. This is particularly important for those with diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart, liver, or 
gallbladder disease. In addition, parents may want to check with their physician before placing their children on a diet program. 
Pregnant women generally are advised not to go on a diet program.</p>
<h4>Questions to Ask</h4>
<p>If you are thinking of trying a diet program, getting answers to the following questions may be helpful.</p>
<p>What does the diet program require you to do?</p>
<p>Decide whether the diet program's requirements such as calorie restrictions are acceptable to your level of commitment. Find out 
what the diet regimen includes. Are counseling and exercise included? Must you purchase special foods or vitamins from the 
company sponsoring the program? Decide if a diet program that requires using only selected products will be practical or 
affordable in the long run.</p>
<p>How much does the program cost? How do you pay for it? You can judge costs of programs by adding up all fees and charges, 
including prices for initial membership and/or weekly fees, food, supplements, maintenance, and counseling. Then, compare 
costs. Find out how payment is required. Some programs charge large upfront fees that you may not get back if you drop out. 
Others allow you to pay as you go. Be aware that many people who begin diet programs drop out early.</p>
<p>What are the health risks associated with the diet program? The National Council Against Health Fraud cautions consumers 
about diet programs that do not reveal risks about the specific program, as well as about weight loss in general. Some diet 
programs are riskier than others, and some are better suited for certain kinds of people. For example, only those significantly 
overweight should consider enrolling in a VLCD program.</p>
<p>What kind of maintenance program is provided and at what cost? Learning how to keep weight off through a maintenance 
program -- is just as important as losing weight. While many diet programs can help you lose weight, the track record for helping 
customers maintain weight loss is not nearly as good. Ask if the maintenance program is offered as part of the total package or 
optional at additional cost. Find out what the maintenance program consists of, how long it lasts, and what you must do.</p>
<p>Inquire whether counseling, exercise, and group meetings are included. Remember that the longer the program focuses on helping 
you change your eating and exercise patterns, the greater the chances of long-term success. If the diet program is not seriously 
committed to helping you maintain a sensible eating and exercise program possibly for the rest of your life you may want to look 
elsewhere.</p>
<h4>For More Information</h4>
<p>There are additional resources available to help you lose weight. For example, you may want to contact a registered dietician or 
clinical psychologist. If you have complaints about the way a diet program is advertised or operated, you may want to contact 
your local consumer protection agency, Better Business Bureau, or state attorney general's office.</p>
<p>In addition, you may want to file a complaint with the FTC. Write: Correspondence Branch, Federal Trade Commission, 
Washington, DC 20580. Complaints about unfair or deceptive practices by diet programs help the FTC in its law enforcement 
efforts.</p>

<h2>Don't lose sight of glaucoma:<br>
Information for people at risk</h2>
<h4>1. What is glaucoma ?</h4>
<p>Glaucoma is an eye disease in which the normal fluid pressure inside the eyes slowly rises, leading to vision loss-or even 
blindness. This brochure is about open-angle glaucoma, the most common form of the disease.</p>
<h4>2. What causes it?</h4>
<p>At the front of the eye, there is a small space called the anterior chamber. Clear fluid flows in and out of the chamber to bathe 
and nourish nearby tissues. In glaucoma, for still unknown reasons, the fluid drains too slowly out of the eye. As the fluid builds 
up, the pressure inside the eye rises. Unless this pressure is controlled, it may cause damage to the optic nerve and other parts of 
the eye and loss of vision.</p>
<h4>3. Who is most likely to get it?</h4>
<p>Nearly 3 million people have glaucoma, a leading cause of blindness in the United States. Although anyone can get glaucoma, 
some people are at higher risk. They include:</p>
<p>* Blacks over the age of 40.<br>
* Anyone over the age of 60.<br>
* People with a family history of glaucoma.<br>
* Among Blacks, studies show that glaucoma is:<br>
* Five times more likely to occur in Blacks than in Whites.<br>
* About four times more likely to cause blindness in Blacks than in Whites.</p>
<p>* Fifteen times more likely to cause blindness in Blacks between the ages of 45-64 than in Whites of the same age group.<br>
</p>
<h4>4. What are the symptoms?</h4>
<p>At first, there are no symptoms. Vision stays normal, and there is no pain. However, as the disease progress, a person with 
glaucoma may notice his or her side vision gradually failing. That is, objects in front may still be seen clearly, but objects to the 
side may be missed. As the disease worsens, the field of vision narrows and blindness results.<br>
</p>
<h4>5. How is it detected?</h4>
<p>Many people may know of the &quot;air puff&quot; test or other tests used to measure eye pressure in an eye examination. But, this test 
alone cannot detect glaucoma. Glaucoma is found most often during an eye examination through dilated pupils. This means drops 
are put into the eyes during the exam to enlarge the pupils. This allows the eye care professional to see more of the inside of the 
eye to check for signs of glaucoma.</p>
<h4>6. How can it be treated?</h4>
<p>Although open-angle glaucoma cannot be cured, it can usually be controlled. The most common treatments are:</p>
<h4>Medications</h4>
<p>These may be either in the form of eyedrops or pills. Some drugs are designed to reduce pressure by slowing the flow of fluid 
into the eye. Others help to improve fluid drainage.</p>
<p>For most people with glaucoma, regular use of medications will control the increased fluid pressure. But, these drugs may stop 
working over time. Or, they may cause side effects.</p>
<p>If a problem occurs, the eye care professional may select other drugs, change the dose, or suggest other ways to deal with the 
problem.</p>
<h4>Laser Surgery</h4>
<p>During laser surgery, a strong beam of light is focused on the part of the anterior chamber where the fluid leaves the eye. This 
results in a series of small changes, which makes it easier for fluid to exit the eye. Over time, the effect of laser surgery may wear 
off. Patients who have this form of surgery may need to keep taking glaucoma drugs.</p>
<h4>Surgery </h4>
<p>Surgery can also help fluid escape from the eye and thereby reduce the pressure. However, surgery is usually reserved for 
patients whose pressure cannot be controlled with eyedrops, pills, or laser surgery.</p>
<h4>7. What research is being done?</h4>
<p>A large amount of research is being done in the U.S. to learn what causes glaucoma and to improve its diagnosis and treatment. 
For instance, the National Eye Institute (NEI) is funding a number of studies to find out what causes fluid pressure to increase in 
the eye. By learning more about this process, doctors may be able to learn the exact cause of the disease and learn better how to 
prevent and treat it. The NEI also supports clinical trials of new drugs and surgical techniques that show promise against 
glaucoma.</p>
<h4>8. What can you do to protect your vision</h4>
<p>Studies have shown that early detection and treatment of glaucoma, before it causes major vision loss, is the best way to control 
the disease. So, if you fall into one of the high-risk groups for the disease, make sure to have your eyes examined through dilated 
pupils every two years by an eye care professional.</p>

<h4>EMF IN YOUR ENVIRONMENT</h4>
<p>What are electric and magnetic fields (EMFs)? What common EMF sources do we encounter during a typical day? This 
publication compares the strength of 60 hertz magnetic fields produced by common electrical items and shows you how their 
strength diminishes as you move farther away from them.</p>
<p>We still have a great deal to learn about electric and magnetic fields (EMFs). We really don't know if typical, everyday 
exposures to EMFs affect human health. Some studies indicate that they might -- others suggest otherwise. Most of the recent 
research on possible biological effects of 60 hertz EMFs suggests that the magnetic, rather than the electric, fields are more likely 
to produce significant effects. Therefore, this publication focuses on them. The information presented here has to do with the 
strength of the magnetic field; however, we aren't certain that the strength of the field is the only important consideration. It may 
turn out that other factors are also important, such as how long the exposure lasts or whether particular characteristics of the field 
change rapidly. Future research is likely to reveal that the information given in this publication is only part of the story -- that is the 
chance we take in providing a public information document this early in the study of a complex environmental health issue.</p>
<h4>What Are Electric and Magnetic Fields?</h4>
<p>Electric charges create electric fields. Electric charges which move (i.e., electric current) create magnetic fields. An appliance that 
is plugged in, and therefore connected to a source of electricity, has an electric field even when the appliance is turned off. To 
produce a magnetic field, however, the appliance must be not only plugged in, but also operating, so that the current is flowing.</p>
<p>This illustrates the point that the higher the frequency, the shorter the wavelength. The wavelengths are infinitely long at the 
bottom and infinitessimally short at the top of the spectrum so, obviously, the drawing cannot be done to scale.</p>
<p>The electric current we use in our everyday life produces certain kinds of electric and magnetic fields. There are many other 
kinds of electric and magnetic fields as well, found throughout nature. The term &quot;electromagnetic&quot; field implies that the electric 
and magnetic fields are interrelated.</p>
<p>These fields can be characterized by either their wavelength or their frequency, which are related. The amount of energy an 
electric or magnetic field can carry depends on the frequency and wavelength of the field. The wavelength describes how far it is 
between one peak on the wave and the next peak. The frequency, measured in hertz, describes how many wave peaks pass by 
in one second of time.</p>
<h4>The Electromagnetic Spectrum</h4>
<p>If you take all the different kinds of electromagnetic fields we know about and place them on a chart, from the lowest frequency 
(i.e., lowest energy) to the highest, you have a chart of the electromagnetic spectrum. (See chart on the previous page.) The low 
end of the spectrum includes electric and magnetic fields produced by everyday electrical appliances. At the top of the spectrum 
are X-rays and gamma rays.</p>
<p>When you hear about &quot;EMFs&quot; in the newsmedia, the term usually refers to electric and magnetic fields at the extremely low 
frequency (or ELF) end of the spectrum, such as those associated with our use of electric power. The term &quot;EMF&quot; can be used 
in a much broader sense as well, encompassing electromagnetic fields across the spectrum. When we use &quot;EMF&quot; in this brochure 
we mean extremely low frequency (ELF) electric and magnetic fields. We should note that in the ELF range, electric and 
magnetic fields are not coupled or interrelated in the same way that they are at higher frequencies, so it is actually more accurate 
to refer to them as &quot;electric and magnetic fields&quot; rather than as &quot;electromagnetic fields.&quot; In the popular press, however, you will 
see both terms used, abbreviated as &quot;EMF.&quot;</p>
<p>Electric fields from most appliances primarily create charges or current on or near the surface of the body and not in the internal 
organs. Magnetic fields, however, pass through the body and actually induce electrical currents within the body. We don't know 
exactly what effect, if any, this has on the different internal organs, but many studies are now underway to find out.</p>
<h4>60 Hertz Electric And Magnetic Fields</h4>
<p>It is relatively easy to shield people from exposure to electric fields using commonly available materials. Magnetic fields, 
however, can pass through anything. Even though both are present around appliances and power lines, more recent interest and 
research have focused on potential health and biological effects of magnetic fields of various strengths.</p>
<p>This publication presents information regarding magnetic fields associated with 60 hertz alternating current (AC) electric power -- 
that is, the kind of electric power we use in North America which flows back and forth or alternates at a rate of 60 times per 
second (60 hertz). We will not focus here on equipment that is powered by &quot;direct current&quot; (DC) such as battery-operated 
appliances. The magnetic fields created by direct current are primarily static; that is, they do not vary with time as do AC fields. 
Direct current (DC) magnetic fields have not raised as many questions about potential health concerns as have the time-varying 
fields created by alternating current (AC). We should point out, however, that some DC-powered equipment can produce 
alternating magnetic fields, but these are usually not 60 hertz fields.</p>
<h4>Other Electromagnetic Frequencies</h4>
<p>Although the information presented here has to do with the low frequency magnetic fields associated with 60 hertz electrical 
current, we should note that some appliances, such as microwave ovens, baby monitors, and video display terminals, use 60 
hertz electrical energy to create other electromagnetic frequencies.</p>
<p>The measurements we give for microwave ovens, for example, describe the magnetic field that results from the 60 hertz electrical 
current used to operate the oven. We are not describing the magnetic field associated with the approximately three billion hertz 
microwaves inside the oven which heat the food and from which people are protected when the door is secured properly.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, we can be easily shielded from the higher frequency microwaves' magnetic fields, but not from the 60 hertz 
magnetic fields. This is because even though the microwave's frequency is higher, its length is much, much shorter (about 1 cm) 
than the wavelength of a 60 hertz field (about 5000 kilometers). The shorter wave can be blocked by materials such as thin metal 
sheets, whereas the much longer wave cannot.</p>
<h4>Potential Health Concerns Associated With Electric and Magnetic Fields</h4>
<p>Electric and magnetic fields from 60 hertz electric power (as well as microwaves and radiowaves) are sometimes called 
non-ionizing radiation. The term &quot;radiation&quot; simply means energy transmitted by waves. &quot;Ionizing&quot; radiation has enough energy to 
strip electrons from atoms. (X-rays are a form of ionizing radiation.) Extremely low frequency EMF cannot do this. Higher 
frequency non-ionizing radiation, such as microwaves, can heat up biological tissue by vibrating molecules. The lower frequency 
60 hertz EMFs cannot. Because of their relatively lower energy, 60 hertz EMFs were not, until recently, thought to be connected 
with any potential health problems.</p>
<p>There are no national standards in the United States for exposure to 60 hertz electromagnetic fields. Several states have formally 
adopted standards to limit the permissible magnetic strength along rights of way of electric transmission lines. Federal legislation 
has been enacted to establish and support national EMF research and public information programs, but no exposure standards 
have been proposed.</p>
<p>Some recent scientific studies have suggested a link -- a statistical association -- between exposure to 60 hertz EMFs and 
specific types of cancer, primarily leukemia and brain cancer. Other studies have found no such association (see Appendix B). In 
a sense, this can be compared to circumstantial evidence in a court of law. Laboratory studies have shown electromagnetic fields 
to affect cells in various ways, but whether these effects are important in terms of human health is still not clear. Almost everyone 
involved in EMF research agrees that much more needs to be learned before conclusions can be reached about the relative 
safety or harm of 60 hertz EMF exposure.</p>
<p>Some people doubt that the EMFs generated by 60 hertz electrical appliances and internal household wiring have any significant 
effect on human health, because they know that the earth's magnetic field, to which we are all constantly exposed, is stronger 
(sometimes over 100 times stronger) than the magnetic fields produced by many of the appliances listed in this publication. 
However, the earth's magnetic field is primarily a DC field rather than a time-varying field. Our bodies seem to react differently to 
these different types of fields so comparing them can be misleading.</p>
<p>At this point, we are not at all sure that exposure to EMFs such as we find in our everyday environment has an adverse effect on 
our health. However, we cannot say with certainty that such exposure is safe for us, either. More research is needed -- and is 
underway. Meanwhile, many people have expressed an interest in having information about everyday sources of EMF exposure. 
This booklet is in response to that interest.</p>
<h4>MAGNETIC FIELD MEASUREMENTS OF EVERYDAY ELECTRICAL DEVICES</h4>
<p>This publication gives information about the strength of the magnetic fields generated by everyday 60 hertz electrically powered 
equipment. It shows how the magnetic field strength diminishes with increased distance from the object.</p>
<h4>Appliances and Magnetic Field Strengths</h4>
<p>Magnetic fields from individual appliances can vary considerably, depending on the way they were designed and manufactured. 
One brand of toaster, for example, may generate a much stronger magnetic field than another. The strength of the magnetic field 
is measured in units of gauss (G) or milligauss (mG). A milligauss is 1/1000th of a gauss. (The international standard unit is 
microtesla which is the same as 10 milligauss.)</p>
<p>It is important to keep in mind that a typical American home has a background magnetic field level (away from any appliances) 
ranging from 0.5 mG to 4 mG. The actual strength of the field at a given place in a room depends upon the number and kinds of 
sources, how far away they are, and how many are operating at one time. Walls generally do not block magnetic fields. An 
electrical appliance located near a wall extends its magnetic field into the room on the other side of the wall as well.</p>
<h4>How Magnetic Field Measurements Were Taken</h4>
<p>The data in the tables (beginning on page 13) came from three different organizations: the Electric Power Research Institute 
(EPRI), the Illinois Institute of Technology Research Institute (IITRI), and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 
What we present here will give you an idea of the relative strength of magnetic fields produced by electrical items you are likely 
to use in your home or at work.</p>
<p>The strength of the magnetic fields has been measured at 6 inches from the item, and then at distances of 1, 2, and 4 feet. These 
distances do not, in every case, correspond to the distance you would typically be from the appliance when you use it, but we 
kept the measurements consistent so that the magnetic field strength could be compared from appliance to appliance. It should 
also be mentioned that different body parts will be exposed to different magnetic field levels from the same appliance, depending 
on how far that part of the body is from the appliance when it is in use. An electric shaver when used, for example, may be three 
inches from the brain and two feet from the liver. Notice in the chart below how the strength of the magnetic field diminishes 
dramatically just a foot or two away from the appliance.</p>
<h4>TABLES</h4>
<p>In the following tables, you will see three numbers listed for each appliance at each distance. First is the lowest measurement we 
have, followed by the median, and then the highest measurement taken. For some appliance categories, hundreds of individual 
items were measured. In other cases, the data gathering was less extensive. The median measurement is simply the middle 
number in a series of measurements.</p>
<p>The appliances are organized according to where you might encounter them during the day (in the kitchen, the office, the 
bedroom, etc). The magnetic field strength is measured in milligauss (mG).</p>
<p>For a detailed description of the methodology used by each of the three groups that conducted these measurements, please refer 
to Appendix A. Also in Appendix A is a reference chart showing the source of the data.</p>

<p>The above graph presents information regarding magnetic fields produced by electric blankets, including conventional 110 volt 
electric blankets as well as the newer model PTC (Positive Temperature Coefficient) Low Magnetic Field blankets. The fields 
were measured at a distance of five centimeters (a little less than 2 inches) from the surface of the blanket, roughly approximating 
the distance from the blanket to the users' internal organs. Because of the way blankets are wired, magnetic field strengths vary 
from point to point on the blanket. The graph reflects this and gives you both the peak as well as the average measurement.</p>

Magnetic field measurements in units of milligauss (mG)
</pre>
<p>Although the U.S. has set no standards for magnetic fields from video display terminals (VDTs), the Swedish government has. Its 
standard of 2.5 milligauss (mG) at a distance of 50 centimeters (about 1.8&quot;) from the VDT has become a de facto standard in the 
VDT industry.</p>
<h4>ELECTRICAL POWER LINES</h4>
<p>Another obvious source of everyday exposure to 60 hertz EMFs is from electrical power lines.</p>
<p>From Carnegie Mellon brochure: Electric and Magnetic Fields from 60 Hertz Electric Power, 1989.</p>
<p>Substations: Some people are particularly concerned about the magnetic fields generated by electrical substations. In fact, as with 
appliances,the fields produced by substation equipment quickly diminish in strength a short distance away and do not extend 
beyond the substation boundaries. However, magnetic fields near substations can be stronger than those in other parts of the 
neighborhood because the power lines drop down closer to the ground as they go in and out of the substation, bringing their 
accompanying magnetic fields closer to people on the ground.</p>
<p>The next table gives typical magnetic field measurements for several types of single circuit electric power lines at varying 
distances from the lines, both at times of average electricity usage and at peak usage times. A single circuit power line is actually 
a set of three lines. If you see more than three lines, it means that more than one circuit runs along the same right-of-way (ROW), 
in which case higher fields are possible. The first measurement on the table gives the maximum magnetic field strength measured 
within the power line ROW. The next four measurements are at distances of 50', 100', 200', and 300'. Power line ROW widths 
vary among utilities. All measurements were taken at a height of one meter above the ground.</p>
<p>The measurements shown here are from electric &quot;transmission&quot; lines, which use very high voltages and go long distances. The 
electrical lines you see in typical neighborhoods are &quot;distribution&quot; lines, which usually carry less voltage than transmission lines. 
Voltage is not, however, the critical issue with regard to magnetic field strength. Rather, magnetic field strength is directly 
proportional to current, which can be high in distribution lines as well as in transmission lines. Residential exposures to distribution 
lines are usually under 5 mG, but have been reported to be as high as 50 mG where the lines pass within a few feet of living 
space in densely populated areas.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that the highest magnetic field strength measurement we have directly on the fight of way of 500 kV 
transmission lines during peak usage is lower than the median measurement we have for magnetic field strength within 6 inches of 
many household appliances, such as hair dryers and vacuum cleaners. However, the duration of exposure to EMFs from power 
lines near a home is typically much longer than the duration of exposure to EMFs from most appliances. Is this an important 
distinction? We just don't know yet.</p>

<p>Buying power lines underground often does reduce their magnetic fields. This is not because they are underground, however, 
since dirt does not act as a shield. Instead, the lower magnetic field is due to the way lines are arranged and encased when they 
are buried, which can have the effect of canceling part of the field. Underground power lines are still capable of exposing you to 
magnetic fields if you are very close to them.</p>
<h4>TRANSPORTATION SOURCES: CARS AND TRAINS</h4>
<p>Inside a car, the dominant sources of 60 hertz magnetic field exposure are those you pass by (or under) as you drive, such as 
power lines. Car batteries involve direct current (DC), rather than alternating current (AC). Car phones are also 
battery-powered and are therefore not sources of 60 hertz magnetic fields, although they do transmit and receive fields in the 
radio frequency range. Some car components, such as alternators, can create alternating fields, but not necessarily in the 60 hertz 
frequency.</p>
<p>Trains present a more complicated picture. Some electrically powered trains operate on alternating current, such as the New 
York City subway and the Baltimore/Washington commuter train. Measurements taken on the Baltimore/Washington train in 
1991* showed 25 hertz magnetic field strengths as high as 500 mG in the passenger areas at seat height. Other trains, such as 
the Washington D.C. Metro and the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART), run on direct current, but even these trains 
are not free of AC fields. Areas of strong AC magnetic fields have been measured on the Washington D.C. Metro, close to the 
floor, presumably near equipment located underneath some train cars. Train motors and other equipment create some very 
intense alternating fields at higher than 60 hertz frequencies. In addition to sources of magnetic field exposure from the train itself, 
train passengers are exposed to magnetic fields from sources the train passes on its route.</p>
<p>* 24-Hour Exposure Measurements to 60 Hertz Magnetic Fields: A Pilot Project, presented by Lynne Gillette, U.S. EPA, at the 
Air and Waste Management Association Annual Meeting, June 1992.</p>
<h4>HOW CAN I USE THIS INFORMATION?</h4>
<p>Many people are surprised when they compare magnetic field measurement data from appliance to appliance and see that 
magnetic field strength does not depend on how large, complex, powerful or noisy the appliance is. In fact, the magnetic fields 
near large appliances are often weaker than those near smaller devices. There are many reasons why this can happen, all of them 
related to product design. The stronger magnetic fields from smaller appliances tend to diminish in strength more quickly as 
distance increases than do the fields from larger appliances, however.</p>
<p>If you are trying to determine your potential exposure to a magnetic field from a particular appliance, it is important that you 
consider how close you are to the appliance and how long you use it. The electric alarm clock at the head of your bed may 
expose you to a magnetic field of 15 mG for 7 or 8 hours each night. The electric can opener in the kitchen is also capable of 
producing a magnetic field of 15-20 mG at a distance of one foot away, but your potential exposure to that field is for a much 
shorter duration.</p>
<p>Does it matter how long we are exposed to a magnetic field? We don't know. Magnetic fields that are cycled on and off 
repeatedly, such as those from photocopiers, may have a different kind of effect on us than those from appliances that run 
constantly, such as alarm clocks.</p>
<p>Obviously, many remaining questions about EMF need to be answered before we can say what is safe or unsafe. The 
government and the private sector are currently working together to sponsor research that attempts to answer some of these 
questions.</p>
<p>This publication presents what we hope are some helpful pieces of the EMF puzzle -- information about how magnetic field 
strengths of various everyday appliances compare with each other and how their strength diminishes the farther away you are 
from the appliances. In many instances, you can substantially reduce your exposure to magnetic fields by simply putting more 
distance between yourself and EMF sources.</p>
<h4>APPENDIX A</h4>
<h4>Technical Notes</h4>
<p>The data in the tables came from three different organizations: the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), J.R. Gauger of the 
Illinois Institute of Technology Research Institute (IITRI), and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Each set of 
data was collected in a different manner.</p>
<h4>EPRI DATA</h4>
<p>The EPRI data comes from the September 1992 Interim Report of EPRI's nationwide Survey of Residential Magnetic Field 
Sources. (EPRI TR100194, Project 2942-06.) The survey involved 707 homes. Data was collected with Star magnetic field 
instruments at different distances from the appliances' front surfaces, at a height of 3 feet from the ground. The Star magnetic field 
meter measures only 60 hertz magnetic fields. EPRI did not measure magnetic field strengths at a distance of 6 inches from the 
appliance, as did IITRI and EPA. Therefore, the missing 6 inch measurements for appliances covered in the EPRI survey was 
provided either by ITTRI or by the EPA. It is important to note that although the tables in this publication give measurements at 
distances of 6 inches, 1 foot, 2 feet, and 4 feet from the source, the EPRI measurements were actually made at slightly closer 
distances from the appliances: approximately 10.5&quot;, 22.3&quot;, and 46&quot;. The number of appliances of each type measured by EPRI 
ranged from 60 to 400. EPRI researchers collected information on manufacturer and model of the appliances they measured, but 
they did not report that information.</p>
<h4>IITRI DATA</h4>
<p>The IITRI data set is from a 1984 report by J.R. Gauger of IITRI, prepared for the U.S. Naval Electronic Systems Command, 
entitled &quot;Household Appliance Magnetic Field Survey&quot; Technical Report E06549-3, Contract No. N00039-84-C-0070. IITRI 
used measurement equipment of their own design. They measured the maximum 60 hertz magnetic field for appliances in the 
location in which they were normally used, and turned off or otherwise minimized all other EMF sources in the vicinity of the 
appliance being measured. The IITRI data set is based on a smaller sample of appliances than EPRI used. About five appliances 
of each type were measured. </p>
<h4>EPA DATA</h4>
<p>EPA staff conducted measurements of commonly used electrical appliances for which data had not already been collected. At 
least five different types of a given appliance were measured. The measurement protocol used by the EPA in its data collection 
was the following:</p>
<p>1) Equipment consisted of a measuring tape and an Emdex II magnetic field meter measuring in the broadband magnetic field 
resultant mode every 1.5 seconds.</p>
<p>2) Sources being measured were left in their original positions in the environment. Other operating sources within 3 feet of the 
object source were turned off when the measurements were taken.</p>
<p>3) Measurement sites were at given distances from the center of the source surface closest to the most likely source user 
position. The measurement sites were on a line from the center of this surface, in the direction of the user position and parallel to 
the floor.</p>
<p>4) For each of the measurement sites, before turning on the source to be measured, an initial measurement of the background 
EMF was taken. This measurement was based on the average of ten consecutive Emdex II readings, rounded to the nearest 
tenth of a milligauss. With the source operating at its maximum output, the measurements were taken with the same averaging 
technique. Background measurements were taken again after the source was turned off.</p>
<p>5) In cases where the source field changed periodically (such as with some copy machines) the measurements were taken during 
the period of operation when the field was strongest.</p>
<p>The following chart shows, for each appliance listed in the publication, which organization provided the data.</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Eye Wear -- May 1994</h2>
<p>Produced in cooperation with the American Academy of Ophthalmology, the National Association of Optometrists and 
Opticians, and the Opticians Association of America</p>
<p>If you, like many Americans, wear eyeglasses or contact lenses, you probably know that comparison shopping can help you find 
quality eye wear that meets your budget. In fact, your ability to comparison shop for eyeglasses is aided by a Federal Trade 
Commission Regulation. Under federal law, you have a right to a copy of your eyeglass prescription so that you can shop for the 
best value in eye wear. If you are buying contact lenses, comparison shopping also can help you find an eye care specialist who 
offers products and services suited for you.</p>
<p>This fact sheet explains what rights you have under the law and gives you information about various types of eye care 
professionals. It also gives some suggestions about selecting an eye care specialist and shopping for eye exams, eyeglasses, and 
contact lenses.</p>
<h4>Your Legal Rights</h4>
<h4>Eyeglasses</h4>
<p>The Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) &quot;Prescription Release Rule&quot; requires eye doctors to give you your eyeglass prescription, 
at no extra cost, immediately after an eye exam that includes a refraction (a test that determines the prescription needed to 
correct your vision). Your eye doctor may withhold your eyeglass prescription until you have paid for your eye exam, but only if 
your eye doctor requires immediate payment whether or not a visual correction is needed.</p>
<p>With prescription in hand, you can shop for eyeglasses just as you would for other health-related products and services, looking 
for the best quality at the best price. You have a legal right to your eyeglass prescription, so request it if it is not provided 
immediately after an eye examination in which a refraction is performed.</p>
<h4>Contact lenses</h4>
<p>Although not required by federal law, many eye care specialists will give you a copy of your contact lens specifications. Some 
states require eye care specialists to give you a copy of your contact lens specifications. It is important to have a copy of these 
specifications if you want to buy your contact lenses, especially replacement or duplicate lenses, from a different specialist. 
Otherwise, you may have to pay for another lens fitting exam.</p>
<h4>Selecting An Eye Care Specialist</h4>
<p>Price is not your only consideration in choosing someone to examine your eyes, fill your prescription, or fit you for contact lenses. 
You also might be concerned about: the type of eye care specialist you wish to visit; the quality of eye care and eye wear you 
may receive; and the service that is promised, especially if some adjustments or modifications prove necessary.</p>
<h4>Eye Professionals</h4>
<p>Before selecting an eye care specialist, you should know the difference among the three types of eye care specialists -- 
ophthalmologists, optometrists, and opticians -- and the services each is qualified to perform. Only ophthalmologists and 
optometrists may issue eyeglass and contact lens prescriptions. Ophthalmologists are physicians who are either medical doctors 
(M.D.'s) or osteopathic physicians (D.O.'s). They specialize in diagnosing and treating diseases of the eyes. They can prescribe 
drugs, perform examinations and eye surgery, and dispense eyeglasses and contact lenses.</p>
<p>Optometrists have doctor of optometry degrees (O.D.'s). Though they are not medical doctors, they can examine eyes for vision 
problems and eye diseases and dispense eyeglasses and contact lenses. State law determines the extent to which optometrists 
may diagnose and treat eye diseases and prescribe drugs, and laws vary from state to state. In states where optometrists are not 
permitted to provide certain treatments, they will normally refer you to an ophthalmologist or other appropriate medical 
practitioner for such treatments.</p>
<p>Opticians fill prescriptions for eye wear written by ophthalmologists and optometrists. They may not examine eyes or prescribe 
lenses. They dispense eyeglasses and in some states are permitted to fit and dispense contact lenses. About half the states require 
opticians to be licensed.</p>
<h4>Quality of Eye Care and Eye Wear</h4>
<p>It may be difficult to predict the quality of the eye care, eye wear, and related services you will receive. Studies show that price 
and the type of practitioner are not necessarily indications of quality.</p>
<p>To help ensure quality care, you might ask for recommendations from your friends. You also might want to check with local 
consumer affairs offices and consumer organizations to see if any complaints have been lodged against the eye care specialist you 
are considering.</p>
<h4>Services</h4>
<p>Investigate what kind of service eye care providers will give you, especially if you have a problem. You may want to consider the 
following information.</p>
<p>Eye Exams: A thorough eye examination includes a refraction, tests for other vision conditions, and an eye health exam. An eye 
exam also can reveal whether you are a good candidate for contact lenses. Remember, only M.D.'s, D.O.'s and O.D.'s may 
perform eye exams.</p>
<p>Eyeglasses: If your eye exam shows you need a visual correction, you may decide you want eyeglasses. Ask about the delivery 
time for eyeglasses, any refund policy, and who pays for replacement lenses or frames if there are problems with either the lenses 
or the frames.</p>
<p>Contact Lenses: Contact lenses are important health care devices that require proper fitting and care. Thus, if you decide you 
want to buy contact lenses, additional steps are necessary beyond the basic eye exam -- the contact lens evaluation and the 
fitting. They include measuring the curvature of your eye and determining which lens is best for you. The evaluation and fitting 
may be performed by ophthalmologists, optometrists, and, in some states, opticians.</p>
<h4>Comparison Shopping For Contacts</h4>
<p>Because buying contact lenses is more complicated than buying eyeglasses, here are some questions you might ask eye care 
specialists.</p>
<p>What do you charge for an eye exam, lenses, a contact lens evaluation, fittings, a lens care kit, follow-up visits, and &quot;insurance&quot; 
service agreements?</p>
<p>These items may be priced individually or sold as a package. Some advertisements for contact lenses quote bargain prices for 
the contact lenses alone. But bargain-priced contact lenses may not be the best purchase if the other essential goods and services 
are not included in the price.</p>
<p>If you are a first-time wearer of contact lenses, you will need services like fittings and follow-up visits in addition to lenses. Even 
experienced contact wearers may require several appointments before they get a proper fit.</p>
<p>So before you select an eye care specialist, ask about the total cost of care, including what tests are included in the eye exam. A 
reasonably-priced package may be a better deal than bargain-priced goods that do not include free follow-up visits.</p>
<h4>What is your refund policy?</h4>
<p>Not everyone who wants to wear contacts is able to adapt to them. With a good refund policy, you will not lose your entire 
investment if you cannot wear the contacts.</p>
<p>How many types and brands of contacts do you sell?</p>
<p>It may take several visits to find the right contact lenses for your eyes. If the specialist carries a large selection of contact lenses, it 
can increase your chances of getting a good fit.</p>
<p>How much do you charge for replacement lenses?</p>
<p>It is possible to lose or damage contact lenses. Find out how much you will be charged and how long you will have to wait if you 
need a replacement lens. Many providers offer service agreements, also known as &quot;insurance&quot; arrangements, that will cover the 
full or partial cost of replacing lost or damaged lenses. Find out whether such an agreement is available, what it covers, and how 
much it costs compared to the cost of replacement lenses.</p>
<p>What is your policy on the release of my contact lens specifications?</p>
<p>Under the FTC Rule, the eye care specialist must provide you with your eyeglass prescription, but not your contact lens 
specifications. Without these measurements, comparison shopping for contact lenses is difficult, if not impossible. Ask about the 
doctor's policy before you make an appointment for an eye exam. If you want a copy of your contact lens specifications, shop 
for an eye care provider who will release it to you.</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Food Advertising Claims -- April 1992</h2>
<p>If you're interested in a healthy diet, you probably look for foods advertised as &quot;low in fat,&quot; &quot;no cholesterol,&quot; or &quot;light.&quot; But these 
claims don't always guarantee that the food is good for you.</p>
<p>In fact, the Federal Trade Commission has challenged use of these claims in specific food advertisements. The Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) also is defining these terms to clear up confusion in food labeling. FDA's definitions go into effect as early 
as May 1993.</p>
<p>To help you shop wisely, you may want to learn more about the following food advertising claims.</p>
<h4>Fat Claims</h4>
<p>The Surgeon General of the United States, along with many prestigious health organizations, has recommended that no more than 
30% of Americans' daily calories come from fat. Fat has been implicated in heart disease the nation's number one killer as well as 
in cancer, diabetes, and other serious illnesses. Fat claims in food ads take various forms. Among the most confusing may be 
those claiming a food is, say, &quot;93% fat-free.&quot;</p>
<p>At first glance, the product may look like a good choice. But, in most cases, this percentage is based on weight, not on calories 
from fat. Foods advertised with fat-free claims based on weight still can be relatively high in fat.</p>
<p>Instead, focus on the number of grams of fat and the percentage of calories from fat in each serving. Only then will you know 
how the food measures up against the Surgeon General's guidelines. To figure out the percentage of calories from fat, check the 
nutrition label for the number of grams of fat in a serving. A gram of fat has 9 calories. Simply multiply the number of grams of fat 
in a serving by 9 and compare that to the total number of calories in a serving.</p>
<p>For example, a serving size of food might have 100 calories and 7 grams of fat. To find out the number of calories from fat, you 
would multiply 7 grams by 9 to get 63 calories of fat. That means 63 out of 100 calories, or 63% of this food is fat -- which is 
high. Even if a particular food's fat content is reasonable, you still need to be careful about eating too many grams of fat in your 
overall diet. The FDA has suggested limiting one's fat intake to no more than 75 grams a day.</p>
<p>The FDA has recently proposed food labeling regulations that will allow &quot;percentage fat-free&quot; claims to be made only on foods 
meeting the definition for a low-fat food. Before then, be cautious of claims that a food is low in fat or is some percentage 
fat-free. Check the food label yourself to see if the claim is accurate.</p>
<h4>No or Low Cholesterol Claims</h4>
<p>Some food ads include no or low cholesterol claims. Too much cholesterol in a diet, like too much fat, has been associated with 
health risks.</p>
<p>Cholesterol and fat are not the same thing. Some foods with no or low cholesterol are, in fact, very high in fat. For example, you 
might see no or low cholesterol ads for such foods as potato chips or peanut butter. Vegetable products like these don't contain 
cholesterol anyway. They may contain, however, large amounts of fat.</p>
<h4>&quot;Light&quot; Claims</h4>
<p>Some food ads include &quot;light&quot; or &quot;lite&quot; claims. No matter how it is spelled, the implication usually is that the food is better for you 
by having less fat or fewer calories.</p>
<p>There currently is no standard definition for &quot;light.&quot; Some light claims mean fewer calories in a serving. Others indicate smaller 
serving sizes or that the color of the food is lighter than similar products.</p>
<p>New federal labeling regulations will define &quot;light.&quot; In the meantime, read the food label carefully. Try to determine what &quot;light&quot; 
means for each particular product.</p>
<h4>For More Information </h4>
<p>If you have concerns about food advertising claims, write: Correspondence Branch, Federal Trade Commission, Washington, 
DC 20580. Information about these issues helps the FTC in its law enforcement efforts.</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Generic Drugs -- March 1993</h2>
<p>While medical expenses generally continue to go up, your pharmacist can probably help you lower the cost of purchasing 
prescription drugs. Your state has a drug product selection law that permits pharmacists to select less costly generic drugs 
instead of brand-name products when filling some of your prescriptions.</p>
<h2>What Does The Drug Product Selection Law Mean To You?</h2>
<p>The purpose of this law is to give you the opportunity to save money on prescription drugs. Here's how it works. Instead of a 
prescribed brand-name drug, your pharmacist frequently can select a less expensive generic equivalent. However, if your doctor 
writes on the prescription form that a specific brand-name drug is necessary, the prescription must be filled exactly as written. 
Many people can save money under their state's drug product selection law. Those who can benefit the most are generally those 
with the greatest need -- older persons and the chronically ill on long-term drug therapy.</p>
<h4>What Is A Generic Drug?</h4>
<p>A generic drug is called by its basic chemical name instead of a registered brand-name chosen by the manufacturer. Generic 
drugs have the same active ingredients as brand-name drugs. One difference between them is the name; another, usually, is the 
price. If your pharmacist gives you a generic drug in place of a brand-name product, good standard practice and most state laws 
require that it be generically and therapeutically equivalent.</p>
<h4>What Does Generically Equivalent Mean?</h4>
<p>A generically equivalent drug product is one that has the same active ingredients, strength, and dosage form as its brand-name 
counterpart.</p>
<h4>What Does Therapeutically Equivalent Mean?</h4>
<p>For a drug to be therapeutically equivalent, it must be chemically the same and also must have the same medical effect.</p>
<h4>Are There Generic Equivalents For All Drugs?</h4>
<p>No. Some drugs are protected by patents and are supplied by only one pharmaceutical company. After the original patent 
expires, other manufacturers may be permitted to produce a generic equivalent, often sold at a lower cost. Presently, about half 
the drugs on the market are available generically, offering you the possibility of savings.</p>
<h4>Will I Get The Medicine My Doctor Prescribed If The Pharmacist Selects A Generic Equivalent?</h4>
<p>Your pharmacist is required by law to give you the medicine prescribed by your doctor. However, he or she may select a 
generic equivalent unless your doctor has asked for a specific brand-name drug as medically necessary.</p>
<h4>How Can I Use The Drug Product Selection Law?</h4>
<p>You can ask your doctor to write a prescription permitting substitution of a generic drug product, whenever appropriate. You 
can ask your doctor and your pharmacist whether a generic product will be as effective, and less costly. Or, of course, you can 
request that only brand-name products be used to fill your prescriptions.</p>
<h4>What Is The Pharmacist's Role In Drug Product Selection?</h4>
<p>Having studied drugs, their use, and their effects, your pharmacist is highly qualified to compare and evaluate drug products.</p>
<h4>Who Should I Talk To About The Drug Product Selection Law?</h4>
<p>Talk to your doctor and explain that you want the most effective drug at the best price. Contact your pharmacist and discuss the 
quality, effectiveness, and the cost of the drug product you will be using. As a trained health care professional, your pharmacist is 
in an excellent position to explain your prescription and instruct you on how to take it for the best results. If you have any 
questions about drug product selection, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.</p>

<h4><a name="intro">SECRETARY'S INTRODUCTION</a></h4>
<p>--Lamar Alexander, Secretary of Education</p>
<p>As a parent of school-aged children, I share with all Americans concern about illegal drug and alcohol use and the threat these 
substances pose to the welfare of our Nation's youths. Recent surveys give us hope that the intensive education e forts of the last 
few years are paying off. The 1990 survey of high school seniors, for example, showed that these young people are less tolerant 
of drug use and more knowledgeable about the risks of using drugs. For the first time in many years, fewer than half of them have 
tried an illicit drug. Many factors contribute to these encouraging trends. As President Bush has reminded us, parents have an 
especially vital part to play:</p>
<p>Schools, churches, synagogues, community groups, law enforcement--all can help us turn the tide on drug and alcohol abuse. But 
none can take a parent's place. Drug education must begin at home and in the neighborhood long before the classroom. 
Statement from the White House, February 26, 1990.</p>
<p>The standards of behavior we establish in our families provide our children with the strongest inducements to stay off of drugs. 
This handbook helps families learn about drugs, including the drugs most children use first--alcohol and tobacco. It gives 
important information on child development at four key stages of growth and suggests activities to reinforce drug prevention 
messages in the home.</p>
<p>Growing Up Drug Free is based on the best available information about how children learn and what works to prevent drug 
abuse. There is nothing difficult about this information, and the only qualification needed to use it is a loving concern for the 
welfare of our children and families.</p>
<p>Concern for the welfare of children and families underpins every one of the national education goals that form the basis of 
President Bush's AMERICA 2000 education strategy. One of these goals is that every school in America will be free of drugs 
and violence and will offer a discipline environment conducive to learning. The AMERICA 2000 strategy recognizes that our 
schools, our workplaces, and our communities cannot be places where education comes first unless and until they are drug free. 
Our role as parents is to do our part to help make drug-free schools and communities a reality by the year 2000. What Parents 
Can Do.</p>
<h4><a name="intro2">INTRODUCTION</a></h4>
<p>Child rearing is one of the most important tasks anyone ever performs, and the one for which there is the least preparation. Most 
of us learn how to be parents through on-the-job training and by following the example that our parents set. Today the 
widespread use of alcohol and other drugs subjects our children, families, and communities to pressures unheard of 30 or 40 
years ago. Frankly, many of us need help to deal with this frightening threat to our children's health and well-being. Recent 
surveys show that we are making progress in our national battle against some drugs. Casual use is declining, attitudes are 
changing, and we know more about what works to prevent drug use by our young people.</p>
<p>As parents, we can build on that progress in our own families by having strong, loving relationships with our children, by teaching 
standards of right and wrong, by setting and enforcing rules for behavior, by knowing the facts about alcohol and other drugs, 
and by really listening to our children.</p>
<h4><a name="teaching">TEACHING VALUES</a></h4>
<p>Every family has expectations of behavior that are determined by principles and standards. These add up to &quot;values.&quot; Children 
who decide not to use alcohol or other drugs often make this decision because they have strong convictions against the use of 
these substances-convictions that are based in a value system. Social, family, and religious values give young people reasons to 
say no and help them stick to their decisions.</p>
<p>Here are some ways to help make your family's values clear:</p>
<p>* Communicate values openly. Talk about why values such as honesty, self-reliance, and responsibility are important, and how 
values help children make good decisions. Teach your child how each decision builds on previous decisions as one's character is 
formed, and how a good decision makes the next decision easier.</p>
<p>* Recognize how your actions affect the development of your child's values. Simply stated, children copy their parents' behavior. 
Children whose parents smoke, for example, are more likely to become smokers. Evaluate your own use of tobacco, alcohol, 
prescription medicines, and even over-the-counter drugs. Consider how your attitudes and actions may be shaping your child's 
choice about whether or not to use alcohol or other drugs. This does not mean, however, that if you are in the habit of having 
wine with dinner or an occasional beer or cocktail you must stop. Children can understand and accept that there are differences 
between what adults may do legally and what is appropriate and legal for children. Keep that distinction sharp, however. Do not 
let your children be involved in your drinking by mixing a cocktail for you or bringing you a beer, and do not allow your child to 
have sips of your drink.</p>
<p>* Look for conflicts between your words and your actions. Remember that children are quick to sense when parents send signals 
by their actions that it's all right to duck unpleasant duties or to be dishonest. Telling your child to say that you are not at home 
because a phone call comes at an inconvenient time is, in effect, teaching your child that it is all right to be dishonest.</p>
<p>* Make sure that your child understands your family values. Parents assume, sometimes mistakenly, that children have 
&quot;absorbed&quot; values even though they may be rarely or never discussed. You can test your child's understanding by discussing 
some common situations at the dinner table; for example, &quot;What would you do if the person ahead of you in line at the theater 
dropped a dollar bill?&quot;</p>
<h4><a name="setting">SETTING AND ENFORCING RULES AGAINST THE USE OF ALCOHOL AND OTHER DRUGS</a></h4>
<p>As parents, we are responsible for setting rules for our children to follow. When it comes to alcohol and other drug use, strong 
rules need to be established to protect the well-being of a child. Setting rules is only half the job, however; we must be prepared 
to enforce the penalties when the rules are broken.</p>
<p>* Be specific. Explain the reasons for the rules. Tell your child what the rules are and what behavior is expected. Discuss the 
consequences of breaking the rules: what the punishment will be, how it will be carried out, how much time will be involved, and 
what the punishment is supposed to achieve.</p>
<p>* Be consistent. Make it clear to your child that a no- alcohol/no-drug-use rule remains the same at all times--in your home, in a 
friend's home, anywhere the child is.</p>
<p>* Be reasonable. Don't add new consequences that have not been discussed before the rule was broken. Avoid unrealistic 
threats such as, &quot;Your father will kill you when he gets home.&quot; Instead, react calmly and carry out the punishment that the child 
expects to receive for breaking the rule.</p>
<h4><a name="getting">GETTING THE FACTS</a></h4>
<p>As parents, we need to know about alcohol and other drugs so that we can provide our children with current and correct 
information. If we have a working knowledge of common drugs--know their effects on the mind and body, and the symptoms of 
their use we can discuss these subjects intelligently with our children. In addition, well informed parents are better able to 
recognize if a child has symptoms of alcohol or drug-related problems: At a minimum, you should:</p>
<p>--know the different types of drugs and alcohol most commonly used and the dangers associated with each;</p>
<p>--be able to identify paraphernalia associated with each drug; be familiar with the street names of drugs; know what drugs look 
like;</p>
<p>--know the signs of alcohol and other drug use and be alert for changes in your child's behavior or appearance;</p>
<p>--know how to get help promptly if you suspect your child may be using alcohol and other drugs.</p>
<p>For current information on alcohol and other drug use, the resource section in this guide can help direct parents to 
clearinghouses, drug and alcohol prevention organizations, and parent groups--to name a few.</p>
<h4><a name="children">CHILDREN AND ALCOHOL</a></h4>
<p>Parents who are clear about not wanting their children to use illicit drugs may find it harder to be tough about alcohol. After all, 
alcohol is legal for adults, many parents drink, and alcohol is a part of some religious observances. As a result, we may view 
alcohol as a less dangerous substance than other drugs. The facts say otherwise:</p>
<p>* 4.6 million teenagers have a drinking problem.,<br>
* 4 percent of high school seniors drink alcohol every day.<br>
* Alcohol-related accidents are the leading cause of death among young people 15 to 24 years of age.<br>
* About half of all youthful deaths in drowning, fires, suicide, and homicides are alcohol related.<br>
* Young people who use alcohol at an early age are more likely to use alcohol heavily and to have alcohol-related problems; 
they are also more likely to abuse other drugs and to get into trouble with the law.<br>
* Young people whose body weight is lower than adults reach a higher blood alcohol concentration level than adults and show 
greater effects for longer periods of time.</p>
<h4><a name="facts">FACTS ON TOBACCO</a></h4>
<p>We know that smokers are 10 times as likely as nonsmokers to develop lung cancer and 3 times as likely to die at early ages 
from heart attack. In fact, in 1985, smoking was the leading cause of early death among adults. Nicotine, the active ingredient in 
tobacco, is as addictive as heroin, and fewer than 20 percent of smokers are able to quit the first time they try. Despite these 
facts, many children use these products.</p>
<p>* 18 percent of high school seniors are daily smokers; 11 percent smoke 10 or more cigarettes per day. </p>
<p>* Young people who use cigarettes are also at great risk for all other drug use. </p>
<p>* 70 percent of all children try cigarettes, 40 percent of them before they have reached high school. </p>
<p>* Cigarettes contain more than 4,000 harmful substances, several of which cause cancer. </p>
<p>* 12 percent of boys and 1 percent of girls have chewed tobacco or used snuff. Smokeless tobacco is just as addictive and 
harmful as tobacco that is smoked. </p>

can cause very aggressive behavior and depression.</p>
<p>10. (d) Medical researchers have not established any safe limits for alcohol intake during pregnancy.</p>
<h4><a name="talking">TALKING WITH AND LISTENING TO YOUR CHILD</a></h4>
<p>Many parents hesitate to discuss alcohol and other drug use with their child. Some of us believe that our children couldn't 
become involved with illegal substances. Others delay because we don't know what to say or how to say it, or we are afraid of 
putting ideas into our children's heads.</p>
<p>Don't wait until you think your child has a problem. Many young people in treatment programs say that they had used alcohol 
and other drugs for at least two years before their parents knew about it. Begin early to talk about alcohol and other drugs, and 
keep the lines of communication open.</p>
<p>Don't be afraid to admit that you don't have all the answers. Let your child know that you are concerned, and that you can work 
together to find answers. Some references that may help are listed later in this text of this guide.</p>
<p>Here are some basic hints for improving your ability to talk with your child about alcohol and other drugs:</p>
<p>* Be a good listener. Make sure your child feels comfortable bringing problems or questions to you. Listen closely to what your 
child says. Don't allow anger at what you hear to end the discussion. If necessary, take a 5 minute break to calm down before 
continuing. Take note of what your child is not saying, too. If the child does not tell you about problems, take the initiative and 
ask questions about what is going on at school or in other activities.</p>
<p>Be available to discuss even sensitive subjects. Young people need to know that they can rely on their parents for accurate 
information about subjects that are important to them. If your child wants to discuss something at a time when you can't give it full 
attention, explain why you can't talk, set a time to talk later, and then carry through on it!</p>
<p>* Give lots of praise. Emphasize the things your youngster is doing right instead of always focusing on things that are wrong. 
When parents are quicker to praise than to criticize, children learn to feel good about themselves, and they develop the self- 
confidence to trust their own judgment.</p>
<p>* Give clear messages. When talking about the use of alcohol and other drugs, be sure you give your child a clear no-use 
message, so that the child will know exactly what is expected. For example, &quot;In our family we don't allow the use of illegal drugs, 
and children are not allowed to drink.&quot;</p>
<p>* Model good behavior. Children learn by example as well as teaching. Make sure that your own actions reflect the standards of 
honesty, integrity, and fair play that you expect of your child.</p>
<h4><a name="communication">COMMUNICATION TIPS</a></h4>
<p>Effective communication between parents and children is not always easy to achieve. Children and adults have different 
communication styles and different ways of responding in a conversation. In addition, timing and atmosphere may determine how 
successful communication will be. Parents should make time to talk with their children in a quiet, unhurried manner. The following 
tips are designed to make communication more successful.</p>
<ul>
<li><h4>LISTENING * Pay attention.<br>
* Don't interrupt.<br>
* Don't prepare what you will say while your child is speaking.<br>
* Reserve judgment until your child has finished and has asked you for a response.<br>
</h4>
<h4>LOOKING * Be aware of your child's facial expression and body language. Is your child nervous or 
uncomfortable--frowning, drumming fingers, tapping a foot, looking at the clock? Or does your child seem 
relaxed--smiling, looking you in the eyes? Reading these signs will help parents know how the child is feeling.<br>
* During the conversation, acknowledge what your child is saying- -move your body forward if you are sitting, 
touch a shoulder if you are walking, or nod your head and make eye contact.<br>
</h4>
<h4>RESPONDING * &quot;I am very concerned about....&quot; or &quot;I understand that it is sometimes difficult ....&quot; are 
better ways to respond to your child than beginning sentences with &quot;You should,&quot; or &quot;If I were you,&quot; or 
&quot;When I was your age we didn't....&quot; Speaking for oneself sounds thoughtful and is less likely to be considered 
a lecture or an automatic response.</h4>
<p>* If your child tells you something you don't want to hear, don't ignore the statement.</p>
<p>* Don't offer advice in response to every statement your child makes. It is better to listen carefully to what is being said 
and try to understand the real feelings behind the words.</p>
<p>* Make sure you understand what your child means. Repeat things to your child for confirmation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The preceding sections have outlined some general guidelines for talking with children about alcohol and other drugs. We can 
make these messages more effective by taking into account the knowledge youngsters already have and their readiness to learn 
new information at different ages.</p>
<h4><a name="preschoolers">PRESCHOOLERS</a></h4>
<p>Drug education may seem unnecessary for preschoolers, but the attitudes and habits learned early can have an important bearing 
on the decisions children make later.</p>
<p>Three- and four-year-olds are not yet ready to learn complex facts about alcohol and other drugs, but they can learn the 
decision-making and problem-solving skills that they will need to refuse alcohol and other drugs later. Remember that children in 
this age group are not able to listen quietly for very long; they are more interested in doing things for themselves.</p>
<p>It's tempting for busy parents to do things for young children because it's quicker and easier. With a little planning, however, you 
can use the learn-by-doing approach to teach your preschooler how to make decisions. Let your child pick from a range of 
options that are acceptable to you. When the choice is made, make sure your child sticks with it.</p>
<h4>Suggested Activities</h4>
<ul>
<li>* Set aside regular times when you can give your child your full attention. Playing together, reading a book, and taking a 
walk are special times that help to build strong bonds of trust and affection between you and your child.<p>* Point out to your child poisonous and harmful substances that can be found in your home. Household products such as 
bleach, lye, and furniture polish all have warning labels that you can read to your child. Keep all household products that 
could harm a small child away from the place you store foods and out of your child's reach.</p>
<p>* Explain how medicine can be harmful if used incorrectly. Teach your child not to take anything from a medicine bottle 
unless you give it to the child yourself or specify someone else who can give it, such as a babysitter or grandparent.</p>
<p>* Explain why children need good food and should put only good things into their bodies. Have your child name several 
good foods that he or she eats regularly, and explain how those foods will make your child strong and healthy.</p>
<p>* Provide guidelines that teach your child what kind of behavior you expect. Teach your child the basic rules of how to get 
along with other children: Play fair. Share toys. Tell the truth. Treat others the way you want them to treat you.</p>
<p>* Encourage your child to follow instructions. For example, invite your child to help you cook; following a 
recipe--measuring ingredients, cracking eggs, kneading dough--can help children have fun while learning about 
step-by-step procedures. Playing simple board games with your child can give practice in following instructions and rules.</p>
<p>* Take advantage of opportunities to use play as a way to help your child handle frustrating situations and solve simple 
problems. A tower of blocks that continuously collapses can drive a child to tears. You can offer a few suggestions to 
keep the tower up, but at the same time you should ask your child what he or she thinks is the best way to do it. Turning a 
bad situation into a success reinforces a child's self-confidence.</p>
<p>* To help your child learn decision making in a practical way, lay out some clothing from which the child can select what 
he or she wishes to wear. Don't worry if the choices don't quite match. Let your child know that you think he or she is 
able to make good decisions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="kindergarten">KINDERGARTEN-GRADE 3</a></h4>
<p>Five- to nine-year-olds usually feel good about themselves. They like growing up, and they generally like school and all the new 
opportunities it provides. They still think and learn primarily by experience, and they don't have a good understanding of things 
that will happen in the future. Fact and fantasy mingle easily; the world is seen as the child wishes it to be, and not as it actually is. 
Children of this age need rules to guide their behavior and information to make good choices and decisions.</p>
<p>Discussions about alcohol and other drugs must be in the here and now, and related to people and events the child knows about. 
Most children are very interested in how their bodies work, so discussions should focus on maintaining good health and avoiding 
things that might harm the body.</p>
<p>Adults are very important both as teachers and as role models. Children are generally trusting, and they believe that the decisions 
adults make for them are right. Helping your child know whom to trust is important. They need to understand that just because 
someone tells them to do something, it is not always right to do it. By the end of the third grade, your child should understand:</p>
<p>--what an illicit drug is, why it is illegal, what it looks like, and what harm it can do:</p>
<p>--how foods, poisons, medicines, and illicit drugs differ;</p>
<p>--how medicines may help during illness, when prescribed by a doctor and administered by a responsible adult, but also how 
medicines are drugs that can be harmful if misused:</p>
<p>--why it is important to avoid unknown and possibly dangerous objects, containers, and substances;</p>
<p>--which adults, both at school and outside, you want your child to rely on for answers to questions or help in an emergency;</p>
<p>--which foods are nutritious and why exercise is important;</p>
<p>--what the school and home rules are about alcohol and other drug use; and</p>
<p>--how using alcohol and other drugs is illegal for all children.</p>
<h4>Suggested Activities</h4>
<ul>
<li>* Children in this age group need to understand the family's rules. You can explain the need for rules by talking about 
traffic safety rules and school rules with which your child is already familiar.<p>* Emphasize the importance of good health by talking about things people do to stay healthy, such as brushing teeth after 
each meal, washing hands, eating good foods, getting plenty of rest and sleep. You can use this discussion to contrast the 
harmful things that people do, such as taking drugs, smoking, or drinking to excess.</p>
<p>* Discuss how TV advertisers try to persuade children to buy their products, including high sugar/additives-loaded 
cereals, candy bars, and toys named after characters in cartoon shows that children find appealing.</p>
<p>* Discuss illnesses with which your child is familiar and for which prescription drugs are often necessary. Many children 
have had strep throat, ear infections, flu, and colds. Discussing such illnesses can help your child understand the difference 
between medicine and illicit drugs.</p>
<p>* Practice ways to say no with your child. Describe situations that may make your child feel uncomfortable: being invited 
to ride a bike where you do not allow your child to go, for example, or being offered medicine or other unfamiliar 
substances. Give your child some responses to use in these situations.</p>
<p>* Develop a &quot;helpers&quot; file of people your child can rely on. Put together a phone list of relatives, family friends, neighbors, 
teachers, religious leaders, and the police and fire departments. Illustrate the list with photos. Talk with your child about 
the kind of help each person on the list could provide in case of various unexpected situations, such as being approached 
by strangers or losing a house key.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="grades4">GRADES 4-6</a></h4>
<p>This is a period of slowed physical growth when typically a lot of energy goes into learning. Children 10 to 12 years old love to 
learn facts, especially strange ones, and they want to know how things work and what sources of information are available to 
them. Friends--a single best friend or a group of friends--become very important. What children this age are interested in or will 
be committed to often is determined by what the group thinks. Children's self-image is determined in part by the extent to which 
they are accepted by peers, especially popular peers. As a result, a lot of &quot;followers&quot; are unable to make independent decisions 
and choices.</p>
<p>This age is perhaps the most important time for parents to focus on increased efforts at drug prevention. These late elementary 
school years are crucial to decisions about the use of alcohol and other drugs. The greatest risk for starting to smoke comes in 
the sixth and seventh grades. Research shows that the earlier youngsters begin to use alcohol and other drugs, the more likely 
they are to have real trouble.</p>
<p>Your child will need a clear no-use message, factual information, and strong motivation to resist pressures to try alcohol and 
other drugs and to reinforce the determination to remain drug free. Appropriate new information could include:</p>
<p>--ways to identify specific drugs, including alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, inhalants, and cocaine in their various forms;<br>
--the long- and short-term effects and consequences of use;<br>
--the effects of drugs on different parts of the body, and the reasons why drugs are especially dangerous for growing bodies; and<br>
--the consequences of alcohol and other illegal drug use to the family, society, and the user.<br>
</p>
<h4>Suggested Activities</h4>
<ul>
<li>* Create special times when you are available to talk to your child. Try to give your child undivided attention. A walk 
together, dinner in a quiet place, or a visit to the ice cream parlor after a movie are some ways to make talking together a 
little easier.<p>* Encourage your child to participate in wholesome activities that will allow the child to form new friendships and have fun. 
Sports, Scouts, religious-sponsored youth programs, and community-sponsored youth organizations are excellent ways 
for children to meet others of their own age.</p>
<p>* Teach your child to be aware of how drugs and alcohol are promoted. Discuss how children are bombarded with 
messages--from TV, song lyrics, billboards, and advertisements--that using alcohol and other drugs is very glamorous. 
Clearly separate the myths from the realities of alcohol and other drug use.</p>
<p>* Continue to practice ways to say no with your child, emphasizing ways to refuse alcohol and other drugs. It is not 
uncommon for sixth graders to be offered beer and cigarettes and to know other children who smoke and drink alcohol.</p>
<p>* Encourage your child to join a local anti-drug club or peer assistance group that encourages drug-free activities.</p>
<p>* Ask your child to scan the morning newspaper and to circle any article that has to do with alcohol and other drug use. 
No doubt there will be articles about drug-related murders, strife in other countries due to drug trafficking, and 
alcohol-related auto accidents. Talk with your child about the tremendous loss of lives and resources because of the use of 
alcohol and other drugs.</p>
<p>* Make friends with the parents of your child's friends so that you can reinforce one another's efforts in teaching good 
personal and social habits. A neighborhood social gathering, sporting event, or school assembly are good places to meet. 
* Join with other parents in providing supervised activities for young people to limit &quot;free time,&quot; which often leads to 
experimentation with alcohol and other drugs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="grades7">GRADES 7-9</a></h4>
<p>During the early teens &quot;fitting in&quot; with friends is a controlling influence. In some ways, the onset of puberty is like a &quot;rebirth.&quot; 
Children want and need to let go of the past and to find their own unique identity. This often means letting go of old friendships 
and ties with teachers and other adults, as well as old ways of doing things. The decision-making and problem- solving methods 
that they learned as young children are still helpful, but young teens will be making new decisions based on new information and 
new goals.</p>
<p>Young people this age can begin to deal with abstractions and the future. They understand that their actions have consequences, 
and they know how their behavior affects others. They sometimes have a shaky self-image: they are not sure whether they are 
growing and changing adequately, they are often in conflict with adults, they are not sure where they are headed, and they tend to 
see themselves as not &quot;okay.&quot; Strong emotional support and a good model of adult behavior are particularly important now.</p>
<p>Young people who use alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs typically begin before leaving the ninth grade. Be sure that family 
discussions about drugs emphasize the immediate, unpleasant effects of alcohol and other drug use. Telling junior high school 
students who are smoking that they will get lung cancer or heart disease in several decades is less likely to make an impression 
than talking about bad breath, stained teeth and fingers, and burned clothing.</p>
<p>Many young people use drugs because their friends use drugs. A large portion of your prevention efforts during these years 
should be spent reinforcing your child's motivation to avoid alcohol and other drugs. Here are some important steps:</p>
<p>* Counteract peer influence with parent influence. Reinforce your no-alcohol/no-drug-use rules and expectations so that your 
child clearly understands that drinking and using drugs are unacceptable and illegal. Children may argue that &quot;everyone is doing it&quot; 
and not experiencing any harmful effects. Inform your child that alcohol and other drug use is illegal for children and that 
&quot;everyone is not doing it.&quot; Emphasize how unpredictable the effects of alcohol and other drugs can be, so that although many 
drug users may appear to function properly, drug use is extremely risky, and all it takes is one bad experience to change a life.</p>
<p>* Get to know your child's friends and their parents. Meet your child's friends. Invite them to your home frequently. Share your 
expectations about behavior with other parents. Work together to develop a set of rules about curfews, unchaperoned parties, 
and other social activities.<br>
* Monitor your child's whereabouts. If your child is at &quot;a friend's house,&quot; be sure that you know the friend and the parents. If 
your child is at the movies, be sure you know what film is playing and at which theater. Last-minute changes in plans, such as 
visiting a different friend or going to a different movie, should not be permitted unless the child checks with Mom, Dad, or 
another designated adult. </p>
<p>By the end of ninth grade your child should know:<br>
--the characteristics and chemical nature of specific drugs and drug interactions;<br>
--the physiology of drug effects on the circulatory, respiratory, nervous, and reproductive systems;<br>
--the stages of chemical dependency and their unpredictability from person to person;<br>
--the ways that drug use affects activities requiring motor coordination, such as driving a car or participating in sports; and<br>
--family history, particularly if alcoholism or other drug addiction has been a problem.</p>
<h4>Suggested Activities</h4>
<ul>
<li>* Continue to practice ways to say no with your child. Teach your child to recognize problem situations, such as being at a 
house where no adults are present and young people are smoking or drinking beer. Make up situations in which your child 
may be asked to try alcohol and other drugs and let the child practice saying no using the steps outlined. Try many 
variations until you are confident that your child knows how to say no.<br>
* Children this age are very concerned about how others see them. You can help your child develop a positive self-image 
by making sure that the child looks good and feels healthy. In addition to providing well-balanced meals, keep your 
refrigerator and pantry stocked with appealing alternatives to junk food.<br>
* Continue to spend private time with your child to discuss what your child feels is important in his or her life right now. 
Your child's fears about emerging sexuality, appearing different from friends, and going on to high school are real problems 
and deserve your concern and attention.<br>
* Periodically review and update, with your child's participation, your house rules and your child's responsibilities 
regarding chores, homework, time limit on TV watching, and the curfew on school and weekend nights. Discuss these 
questions with your child: Are the rules fair and the consequences appropriate? Is it time to switch to some new chores? 
Should there be fewer or different chores because of added homework assignments or after- school activities? Should the 
curfew be adjusted?<br>
* Talk with your child about friendship. Make the point that true friends do not ask each other to do things they know are 
wrong and risk harm to themselves, their friends, or their families.<br>
* Plan supervised parties or other activities for your child in your home which reflect a no alcohol/no-drug-use rule. For 
example, have your child invite friends to share a pizza and watch TV.</li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="grades10">GRADES 10-12</a></h4>
<p>High school students are future-oriented and can engage in abstract thinking. They have an increasingly realistic understanding of 
adults. Young people therefore want adults to discuss their concerns and the ways they solve problems and make decisions. You 
may have a tremendous new opportunity to help your children at this age. At the same time, the teenagers continue to be 
group-orientated, and belonging to the group motivates much of their behavior and actions. During these years, young people 
often develop a broader outlook and become more interested in the welfare of others.</p>
<p>By the end of high school, your child should understand:</p>
<p>--both the immediate and long-term physical effects of specific drugs;<br>
--the possibly fatal effects of combining drugs;<br>
--the relationship of drug use to other diseases and disabilities;<br>
--the effects of alcohol and other drugs on the fetus during pregnancy;<br>
--the fact that drug use is not a victimless crime;<br>
--the effects and possible consequences of operating equipment while using alcohol and other drugs;<br>
--the impact that drug use has on society; and<br>
--the extent of community intervention resources.</p>
<p>You may want to focus on the potential long-term effects of alcohol and other drugs during these years: drugs can ruin your 
teen's chances of getting into college, being accepted by the military, or being hired for certain jobs. Your teen may also be 
impressed by the importance of being seen as a good role model for a younger brother or sister.</p>
<p>Although young people long for independence it is particularly important to keep them involved in the family and family activities. 
They should join the rest of the family for dinner regularly, be part of family vacations, and remain part of family routines.</p>
<h4>Suggested Activities</h4>
<ul>
<li>* Continue to talk with your teenager about alcohol and other drug use. Chances are your teen has friends who use 
alcohol and other drugs or knows people who do. Talk about how alcohol and other drug use threatens lives and may 
limit opportunities for the future.<p>* Plan strategies to limit your teen's unsupervised hours at home, while you are at work. Researchers have found that 
lunchtime and 3:00 - 6:00 p.m. are periods teenagers are likely to experiment with alcohol and other drugs.</p>
<p>* Encourage your teenager to work on behalf of a drug prevention program by being trained as a volunteer to answer 
hot-line calls or as a peer counselor.</p>
<p>* Talk with your teenager about joining a sports club, drama club, arts and crafts center, or dance studio or about 
volunteering to work for a church group or community organization. The busier your teenager is, the less likely he or she is 
to be bored and to seek an outlet in alcohol or other drugs. Volunteer with your teenager, if you have time.</p>
<p>* Plan alcohol- and drug-free activities with other families during school vacations and major holidays, which can be high- 
risk idle times for teens.</p>
<p>* Make sure your teen has access to up-to-date information on alcohol and other drugs and their effects. Make an effort 
to be informed about any new drugs that are popular, and know their effects. (For suggested reading, see the resources 
section at the end of this booklet.)</p>
<p>* Cooperate with other parents to make sure that the parties and social events your teenager attends are alcohol- and 
drug-free. Some families choose to draw up a contract holding adults responsible for parties given in their homes; the 
contract specifies that all parties will be supervised and that there is to be no use of alcohol or other drugs. (See &quot;Safe 
Homes&quot; in the resource section.)</p>
<p>* Help plan community-sponsored drug-free activities such as alcohol- and drug-free dances and other recreational 
activities such as &quot;midnight basketball.&quot;</p>
<p>* Talk with your teenager about the future. Discuss your expectations and your teenager's ambitions. Collect college or 
vocational catalogs for your teenager, and discuss different educational and career options. Plan a family outing to local 
colleges and universities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Young people use drugs for many reasons that have to do with how they feel about themselves, how they get along with others, 
and how they live. No one factor determines who will use drugs and who will not, but here are some predictors:</p>
<ul>
<li>* low grades or poor school performance, <br>
* aggressive, rebellious behavior;<br>
* excessive influence by peers;<br>
* lack of parental support and guidance; and<br>
* behavior problems at an early age.</li>
</ul>
<p>Being alert to the signs of alcohol and other drug use requires a keen eye. It is sometimes hard to know the difference between 
normal teenage behavior and behavior caused by drugs. Changes that are extreme or that last for more than a few days may 
signal drug use. Consider the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>* Does your child seem withdrawn, depressed, tired, and careless about personal grooming?<br>
* Has your child become hostile and uncooperative?<br>
* Have your child's relationships with other family members deteriorated?<br>
* Has your child dropped his old friends?<br>
* Is your child no longer doing well in school-- grades slipping, attendance irregular?<br>
* Has your child lost interest in hobbies, sports, and other favorite activities?<br>
* Have your child's eating or sleeping patterns changed?</li>
</ul>
<p>Positive answers to any of these questions can indicate alcohol or other drug use. However, these signs may also apply to a child 
who is not using drugs but who may be having other problems at school or in the family. If you are in doubt, get help. Have your 
family doctor or local clinic examine your child to rule out illness or other physical problems.</p>
<p>Watch for signs of drugs and drug paraphernalia as well. Possession of common items such as pipes, rolling papers, small 
medicine bottles, eye drops, or butane lighters may signal that your child is using drugs.</p>
<p>Even when the signs are clearer, usually after the child has been using drugs for a time, parents sometimes do not want to admit 
that their child could have a problem. Anger, resentment, guilt, and a sense of failure as parents are common reactions.</p>
<p>If your child is using drugs, it is important to avoid blaming yourself for the problem and to get whatever help is needed to stop it. 
The earlier a drug problem is detected and faced, the more likely it is that your child can be helped.</p>
<p>First, do not confront a child who is under the influence of alcohol or other drugs, but wait until the child is sober. Then discuss 
your suspicions with your child calmly and objectively. Bring in other members of the family to help, if necessary.</p>
<p>Second, impose whatever discipline your family has decided on for violating the rules and stick to it. Don't relent because the 
youngster promises never to do it again.</p>
<p>Many young people lie about their alcohol and drug use. If you think your child is not being truthful and the evidence is pretty 
strong, you may wish to have your child evaluated by a health professional experienced in diagnosing adolescents with alcohol- 
and drug-related problems.</p>
<p>If your child has developed a pattern of drug use or has engaged in heavy use, you will probably need help to intervene. If you 
do not know about drug treatment programs in your area, call your doctor, local hospital, or county mental health society for a 
referral. Your school district should have a substance abuse coordinator or a counselor who can refer you to treatment 
programs, too. Parents whose children have been through treatment programs can also provide information.</p>
<p>The most promising drug prevention programs are those in which parents, students, schools, and communities join together to 
send a firm, clear message that the use of alcohol and other drugs will not be tolerated.</p>
<h4><a name="school">SCHOOL-PARENT COOPERATION</a></h4>
<p>The development of strong policies that spell out rules governing use, possession, and sale of alcohol and other drugs is a key 
part of any school-based prevention program. Learn what your school's policies are and actively support them. If your school 
has no policy, work with teachers, administrators, and community members to develop one. Good school policies typically 
specify what constitutes an alcohol or other drug offense, spell out the consequences for violating the policy, describe procedures 
for handling violations, and build community support for the policy.</p>
<p>Visit your child's school and learn how drug education is being taught. Are the faculty members trained to teach about alcohol 
and other drug use? Is drug education a regular part of the curriculum or limited to a special week? Is it taught through the health 
class, or do all teachers incorporate drug education into their subject area? Do children in every grade receive drug education, or 
is it limited to selected grades? Is there a component for parents?</p>
<p>If your school has an active program to prevent drug use, ask to see the materials that are being used. Do they contain a clear 
message that alcohol and other drug use is wrong and harmful? Is the information accurate and up-to-date? Does the school 
have referral sources for students who need special help?</p>
<p>Let other parents know about the school's policies through meetings of the parent-teacher organization. At least one meeting 
each year should be devoted to issues of alcohol and other drug use. Knowledgeable local physicians and pharmacists can be 
invited to discuss how drugs affect the growth and development of children, police officers can outline the scope and severity of 
the drug problem in your community, and substance abuse counselors can discuss symptoms of alcohol and other drug use and 
treatment options.</p>
<h4><a name="parent">PARENT-COMMUNITY ACTIVITIES</a></h4>
<p>Help your child to grow up alcohol and drug free by supporting community efforts to give young people healthy alternatives. 
Alcohol- and drug-free proms and other school-based celebrations are growing in popularity around the country. You can help 
to organize such events, solicit contributions, and serve as a chaperon.</p>
<p>Local businesses are also an excellent source of support for alternative activities such as athletic teams and part-time jobs. Shops 
and restaurants in one community in Texas, for example, now offer discounts to young people who test negative for drugs in a 
voluntary urinalysis.</p>
<h4><a name="support">PARENT SUPPORT GROUPS</a></h4>
<p>Other parents can be valuable allies in your effort to keep your child drug free. Get to know the parents of your child's friends. 
Share expectations about behavior and develop a set of mutually agreed upon rules about such things as curfews, unchaperoned 
parties, and places that are off-limits. Helping youngsters stay out of trouble is easier when rules of conduct are clearly known 
and widely shared.</p>
<p>Build a network of other adults with whom you can talk. Join a parent organization in your community, or talk informally with 
your friends about common concerns in rearing children. Sharing experiences can provide insights that help you deal with your 
child's behavior. It also helps to know that other parents have faced similar situations.</p>
<p>Despite the grim stories that fill our newspapers and dominate the evening news, most young people do not use illicit drugs, they 
do not approve of drug use by their friends, and they share their parents' concern about the dangers posed by drugs. Successful 
prevention efforts, whether in a family, school, or community setting, have many elements in common: a concern for the welfare 
and well being of young people, dedicated adults who are willing to devote their time and energy, and an unwavering 
commitment to being drug free.</p>
<p>That commitment led a small group of parents in Bowling Green, Kentucky, to form Bowling Green Parents for Drug-Free 
Youth. The organization has worked closely with the local schools and community to provide training and education for all 
members of the community, and it has raised more than $35,000 to help finance its efforts. Questionnaires administered to 
students in grades 7-12 for 6 consecutive years have shown a steady decline in the use of alcohol and other drugs.</p>
<p>Gail Amato, president of the Bowling Green Parents for Drug- Free Youth, speaks persuasively about why parents must be 
involved in helping to prevent alcohol and other drug use: People often ask me why I think parents are the answer, and I think it's 
because we have the most to lose. Schools can help, churches can help, law enforcement can help, but no one can replace the 
family. Being involved with drug and alcohol prevention lets our children know that we care. It strengthens the family and helps us 
to be the kind of parents our children need us to be.</p>
<p>A similar commitment leads parents of students in Commodore Stockton Skills School in Stockton, California, to donate more 
than 400 volunteer hours each month helping in the classrooms. Last year a family picnic held during Red Ribbon Week, a 
national drug awareness week, drew 500 participants for a day of games and activities focused on prevention of drug use.</p>
<p>In addition to helping in the classroom, Stockton parents work to maintain discipline, to reinforce students' respect for other 
people, and to foster personal responsibility at home. As a result, behavioral problems in the school are infrequent, attendance is 
high, and area police report juvenile drug arrests from every school in the city except Commodore Stockton.</p>
<p>Successful efforts to rid a neighborhood of drugs are often joint efforts. Two years ago in New Haven, Connecticut, the residents 
of six housing projects joined forces to solve a neighborhood problem--drugs. The residents were afraid for the safety of their 
children and sick of the murders and other nightly violence related to drug deals.</p>
<p>Representing more than 1,400 families from the six projects, the group drafted an action plan to rid the neighborhood of drugs. 
The residents asked the local police to conduct &quot;sting&quot; operations periodically. Members of the New Haven news media have 
been invited to the project, where residents speak openly about the problems they encounter. The residents have invited local 
community groups and the Greater New Haven Labor Council to join in the fight. In addition, the mayor has become directly 
involved in their struggle.</p>
<p>One member, speaking on behalf of the residents, stated its main objective: &quot;We are banding together to stop this madness so 
that we can have a peaceful and livable neighborhood and community.&quot; Today, drug sales have decreased, and members of the 
community feel safer and more hopeful about the future.</p>
<h4><a name="alcohol">ALCOHOL</a></h4>
<p>Alcohol consumption causes a number of changes in behavior. Even low doses significantly impair the judgment and coordination 
required to drive a car safely. Low to moderate doses of alcohol can increase the incidence of a variety of aggressive acts, 
including spouse and child abuse. Moderate to high doses of alcohol cause marked impairments in higher mental functions, 
severely altering a person's ability to learn and remember information. Very high doses cause respiratory depression and death.</p>
<p>Continued use of alcohol can lead to dependence. Sudden cessation of alcohol intake is likely to produce withdrawal symptoms, 
including severe anxiety, tremors, hallucinations, and convulsions. Long-term effects of consuming large quantities of alcohol, 
especially when combined with poor nutrition, can lead to permanent damage to vital organs such as the brain and the liver. In 
addition, mothers who drink alcohol during pregnancy may give birth to infants with fetal alcohol syndrome. These infants may 
suffer from mental retardation and other irreversible physical abnormalities. In addition, research indicates that children of 
alcoholic parents are at greater risk than other children of becoming alcoholics.</p>
<h4><a name="tobacco">TOBACCO</a></h4>
<p>The smoking of tobacco products is the chief avoidable cause of death in our society. Smokers are more likely than nonsmokers 
to contract heart disease some 170,000 die each year from smoking-related coronary heart disease. Lung, larynx, esophageal, 
bladder, pancreatic, and kidney cancers also strike smokers at increased rates. Some 30 percent of cancer deaths (130,000 per 
year) are linked to smoking. Chronic, obstructive lung diseases such as emphysema and chronic bronchitis are 10 times more 
likely to occur among smokers than among nonsmokers.</p>
<p>Smoking during pregnancy also poses serious risks. Spontaneous abortion, preterm birth, low birth weights, and fetal and infant 
deaths are all more likely to occur when the pregnant woman is a smoker.</p>
<p>Cigarette smoke contains some 4,000 chemicals, several of which are known carcinogens. Perhaps the most dangerous 
substance in tobacco smoke is nicotine. Nicotine is the substance that reinforces and strengthens the desire to smoke. Because 
nicotine is highly addictive, addicts find it very difficult to stop smoking. Of 1,000 typical smokers, fewer than 20 percent 
succeed in stopping on the first try.</p>
<h4><a name="cannabis">CANNABIS</a></h4>
<p>All forms of cannabis have negative physical and mental effects. Several regularly observed physical effects of cannabis are a 
substantial increase in the heart rate, bloodshot eyes, a dry mouth and throat, and increased appetite.</p>
<p>Use of cannabis may impair or reduce short-term memory and comprehension, alter sense of time, and reduce ability to perform 
tasks requiring concentration and coordination, such as driving a car. Motivation and cognition may be altered, making the 
acquisition of new information difficult. Marijuana can also produce paranoia and psychosis.</p>
<p>Because users often inhale the unfiltered smoke deeply and then hold it in their lungs as long as possible, marijuana is damaging to 
the lungs and pulmonary system. Marijuana smoke contains more cancer-causing agents than tobacco smoke. Long-term users 
of cannabis may develop psychological dependence and require more of the drug to get the same effect. The drug can become 
the center of their lives.</p>

<h4><a name="inhalants">INHALANTS</a></h4>
<p>The immediate negative effects of inhalants include nausea, sneezing, coughing, nosebleeds, fatigue, lack of coordination, and loss 
of appetite. Solvents and aerosol sprays also decrease the heart and respiratory rates and impair judgment. Amyl and butyl nitrite 
cause rapid pulse, headaches, and involuntary passing of urine and feces. Long-term use may result in hepatitis or brain damage.</p>
<p>Deeply inhaling the vapors, or using large amounts over a short time, may result in disorientation, violent behavior, 
unconsciousness, or death. High concentrations of inhalants can cause suffocation by displacing the oxygen in the lungs or by 
depressing the central nervous system to the point that breathing stops.</p>
<p>Long-term use can cause weight loss, fatigue, electrolyte imbalance, and muscle fatigue. Repeated sniffing of concentrated 
vapors over time can permanently damage the nervous system.</p>

<h4><a name="cocaine">COCAINE</a></h4>
<p>Cocaine stimulates the central nervous system. Its immediate effects include dilated pupils and elevated blood pressure, heart 
rate, respiratory rate, and body temperature. Occasional use can cause a stuffy or runny nose, while chronic use can ulcerate the 
mucous membrane of the nose. Injecting cocaine with contaminated equipment can cause AIDS, hepatitis, and other diseases. 
Preparation of freebase, which involves the use of volatile solvents, can result in death or injury from fire or explosion.</p>
<p>Crack or freebase rock is extremely addictive, and its effects are felt within 10 seconds. The physical effects include dilated 
pupils, increased pulse rate, elevated blood pressure, insomnia, loss of appetite, tactile hallucinations, paranoia, and seizure. The 
use of cocaine can cause death by cardiac arrest or respiratory failure.</p>

<h4><a name="other">OTHER STIMULANTS</a></h4>
<p>Stimulants can cause increased heart and respiratory rates, elevated blood pressure, dilated pupils, and decreased appetite. In 
addition, users may experience sweating, headache, blurred vision, dizziness, sleeplessness, and anxiety. Extremely high doses 
can cause a rapid or irregular heartbeat, tremors, loss of coordination, and even physical collapse. An amphetamine injection 
creates a sudden increase in blood pressure that can result in stroke, very high fever, or heart failure.</p>
<p>In addition to the physical effects, users report feeling restless, anxious, and moody. Higher doses intensify the effects. Persons 
who use large amounts of amphetamines over a long period of time can develop an amphetamine psychosis that includes 
hallucinations, delusions, and paranoia. These symptoms usually disappear when drug use ceases.</p>

<h4><a name="depressants">DEPRESSANTS</a></h4>
<p>The effects of depressants are in many ways similar to the effects of alcohol. Small amounts can produce calmness and relaxed 
muscles, but larger doses can cause slurred speech, staggering gait, and altered perception. Very large doses can cause 
respiratory depression, coma, and death. The combination of depressants and alcohol can multiply the effects of the drugs, 
increasing the risks.</p>
<p>Regular use of depressants over time can result in physical and psychological addiction. People who suddenly stop taking large 
doses can experience withdrawal symptoms, including anxiety, insomnia, tremors, delirium, convulsions, and death. Babies born 
to mothers who abuse depressants may also be physically dependent on the drugs and show withdrawal symptoms shortly after 
they are born. Birth defects and behavioral problems also may result.</p>

<h4><a name="hallucinogens">HALLUCINOGENS</a></h4>
<p>Phencyclidine (PCP) interrupts the functions of the neocortex, the section of the brain that controls the intellect and keeps 
instincts in check. Because the drug blocks pain receptors, violent PCP episodes may result in self-inflicted injuries. The effects 
of PCP vary, but users frequently report a sense of distance and estrangement. Time and body movement are slowed down. 
Muscular coordination worsens and senses are dulled. Speech is blocked and incoherent. In later stages of chronic use, users 
often exhibit paranoid and violent behavior and experience hallucinations. Large doses may produce convulsions and coma, as 
well as heart and lung failure.</p>
<p>Lysergic acid (LSD), mescaline, and psilocybin cause illusions and hallucinations. The physical effects may include dilated pupils, 
elevated body temperature, increased heart rate and blood pressure, loss of appetite, sleeplessness, and tremors. The user may 
experience panic, confusion, suspicion, anxiety, and loss of control. Delayed effects, or flashbacks, can occur even when use has 
ceased.</p>

<h4><a name="narcotics">NARCOTICS</a></h4>
<p>Narcotics initially produce a feeling of euphoria that often is followed by drowsiness, nausea, and vomiting. Users also may 
experience constricted pupils, watery eyes, and itching. An overdose may produce slow and shallow breathing, clammy skin, 
convulsions, coma, and possible death.</p>
<p>Tolerance to narcotics develops rapidly and dependence is likely. The use of contaminated syringes may result in disease such as 
AIDS, endocarditis, and hepatitis. Addiction in pregnant women can lead to premature, stillborn, or addicted infants who 
experience severe withdrawal symptoms.</p>

<h4><a name="designer">DESIGNER DRUGS</a></h4>
<pre>Illegal drugs are defined in the terms of their chemical
formulas. To circumvent these legal restriction underground
chemists modify the molecular structure of certain illegal drugs
to produce analogs known as designer drugs. These drugs can be
several hundred times stronger than the drugs they are designed
to imitate.</pre>
<p>The narcotic analogs can cause symptoms such as those seen in Parkinson's disease: uncontrollable tremors, drooling, impaired 
speech, paralysis, and irreversible brain damage. Analogs of amphetamines and methamphetamines cause nausea, blurred vision, 
chills or sweating, and faintness. Psych logical effects include anxiety, depression, and paranoia. As little as one dose can cause 
brain damage The analogs of phencyclidine cause illusions, hallucinations, and impaired perception.</p>

<h4><a name="anabolic">ANABOLIC STEROIDS</a></h4>
<pre>Anabolic steroids are a group of powerful compounds closely
related to the male sex hormone testosterone. Developed in the
1930's, steroids are seldom prescribed by physicians today.
Current legitimate medical uses are limited to certain kinds of
anemia, severe burns, and some types of breast cancer.</pre>
<p>Taken in combination with a program of muscle-building exercise and diet, steroids may contribute to increases in body weight 
and muscular strength. Steroid users subject themselves to more than 70 side effects ranging in severity from liver cancer to acne 
and including psychological as well as physical reactions. The liver and cardiovascular and reproductive systems are most 
seriously affected by steroid use. In males, use can cause withered testicles, sterility, and impotence. In females, irreversible 
masculine traits can develop along with breast reduction and sterility. Psychological effects in both sexes include very aggressive 
behavior known as &quot;roid rage&quot; and depression. While some side effects appear quickly, others, such as heart attacks and 
strokes, may not show up for years.</p>
<p>Signs of steroid use include quick weight and muscle gains (when used in a weight training program); aggressiveness and 
combativeness; jaundice; purple or red spots on the body; swelling of feet and lower legs; trembling; unexplained darkening of 
the skin; and persistent unpleasant breath odor.</p>

</p>
<h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>
<p>Health insurance programs allow workers and their families to take care of essential medical needs. These programs can be one 
of the most important benefits provided by your employer. There was a time when group health coverage was available only to 
full-time workers and their families. That changed in 1985 with the passage of health benefit provisions in the Consolidated 
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA). Now, terminated employees or those who lose coverage because of reduced 
work hours may be able to buy group coverage for themselves and their families for limited periods of time. If you are entitled to 
COBRA benefits, your health plan must give you a notice stating your right to choose to continue benefits provided by the plan. 
You have 60 days to accept coverage or lose all rights to benefits. Once COBRA coverage is chosen, you are required to pay 
for the coverage. This booklet is designed to:</p>
<p>* Outline the rules that apply to health plans for employees in the private sector<br>
* Provide a general explanation of COBRA requirements<br>
* Spotlight your rights to benefits under this law<br>
</p>
<h4>WHAT IS THE CONTINUATION HEALTH LAW?</h4>
<p>Congress passed the landmark Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA){1} health benefit provisions in 
1985. The law amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), the Internal Revenue Code and the Public 
Health Service Act to provide continuation of group health coverage that otherwise would be terminated.</p>
<p>COBRA contains provisions giving certain former employees, retirees, spouses and dependent children the right to temporary 
continuation of health coverage at group rates. This coverage, however, is only available in specific instances. Group health 
coverage for COBRA participants is usually more expensive than health coverage for active employees, since usually the 
employer formerly paid a part of the premium. It is ordinarily less expensive, though, than individual health coverage.</p>
<p>The law generally covers group health plans maintained by employers with 20 or more employees in the prior year. It applies to 
plans in the private sector and those sponsored by state and local governments.{2} The law does not, however, apply to plans 
sponsored by the Federal government and certain church- related organizations.</p>
<p>Group health plans sponsored by private sector employers generally are welfare benefit plans governed by ERISA and subject 
to its requirements for reporting and disclosure, fiduciary standards and enforcement. ERISA neither establishes minimum 
standards or benefit eligibility for welfare plans nor mandates the type or level of benefits offered to plan participants. It does, 
though, require that these plans have rules outlining how workers become entitled to benefits.</p>
<p>For COBRA purposes, a group health plan ordinarily is defined as a plan that provides medical benefits for the employer's own 
employees and their dependents through insurance or otherwise (such as a trust, health maintenance organization, self-funded 
pay-as-you-go basis, reimbursement or combination of these). Medical benefits provided under the terms of the plan and 
available to COBRA beneficiaries may include:</p>
<p>* Inpatient and outpatient hospital care<br>
* Physician care<br>
* Surgery and other major medical benefits<br>
* Prescription drugs<br>
* Any other medical benefits, such as dental and vision care<br>
Life insurance, however, is not a benefit that must be offered to individuals for purposes of health continuation coverage.<br>
</p>
<p>{1} The original continuation health provisions were contained in Title X of COBRA, which was signed into law (Public Law 
99-272) on April 7, 1986.<br>
{2} Provisions of COBRA covering state and local government plans are administered by the U.S. Public Health Service within 
the Department of Health and Human Services.<br>
</p>
<h4>WHO IS ENTITLED TO BENEFITS?</h4>
<p>There are three elements to qualifying for COBRA benefits. COBRA establishes specific criteria for plans, beneficiaries and 
events which initiate the coverage.<br>
</p>
<h4>PLAN COVERAGE</h4>
<p>Group health plans for employers with 20 or more employees on at least 50 percent of the working days in the previous calendar 
year are subject to COBRA. &quot;Employees&quot; include full-time and part-time workers, agents, independent contractors and 
directors, and certain self-employed individuals eligible to participate in a group health plan.</p>
<p><h4.BENEFICIARY COVERAGE</h4.> A qualified beneficiary generally is any individual covered by a group health plan on the day before a qualifying event. A 
qualified beneficiary may be an employee, the employee's spouse and dependent children, and in certain cases, a retired 
employee, the retired employee's spouse and dependent children.<br>
</p>
<h4>QUALIFYING EVENTS</h4>
<p>&quot;Qualifying events&quot; are certain types of events that would cause, except for COBRA continuation coverage, an individual to lose 
health coverage. The type of qualifying event will determine who the qualified beneficiaries are and the required amount of time 
that a plan must offer the health coverage to them under COBRA. A plan, at its discretion, may provide longer periods of 
continuation coverage.<br>
The types of qualifying events for employees are:</p>
<p>* Voluntary or involuntary termination of employment for reasons other than &quot;gross misconduct&quot;<br>
* Reduction in the number of hours of employment</p>
<p>The types of qualifying events for spouses are:</p>
<p>* Termination of the covered employee's employment for any reason other than &quot;gross misconduct&quot;<br>
* Reduction in the hours worked by the covered employee<br>
* Covered employee's becoming entitled to Medicare<br>
* Divorce or legal separation of the covered employee<br>
* Death of the covered employee</p>
<p>The types of qualifying events for dependent children are:</p>
<p>* Termination of covered employee's employment for any reason other than &quot;gross misconduct&quot;<br>
* Reduction in the hours worked by the covered employee<br>
* Loss of &quot;dependent child&quot; status under the plan rules<br>
* Covered employee's becoming entitled to Medicare<br>
* Divorce or legal separation of the covered employee<br>
* Death of the covered employee<br>
</p>

<p>{3} The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 contained amendments to the Internal Revenue Code and ERISA affecting 
retirees and family members who receive post-retirement health coverage from employers involved in bankruptcy proceedings 
begun on or after July 1, 1986. This booklet does not address that group.<br>
{4} In the case of individuals who qualify for Social Security disability benefits, special rules apply to extend coverage an 
additional 11 months.</p>
<hr>
<h4>YOUR RIGHTS: NOTICE AND ELECTION PROCEDURES</h4>
<p>COBRA outlines procedures for employees and family members to elect continuation coverage and for employers and plans to 
notify beneficiaries. The qualifying events contained in the law create rights and obligations for employers, plan administrators and 
qualified beneficiaries.</p>
<p>Qualified beneficiaries have the right to elect to continue coverage that is identical to the coverage provided under the plan. 
Employers and plan administrators have an obligation to determine the specific rights of beneficiaries with respect to election, 
notification and type of coverage options.</p>
<h4>NOTICE PROCEDURES</h4>
<p>General Notices<br>
An initial general notice must be furnished to covered employees, their spouses and newly hired employees informing them of 
their rights under COBRA and describing provisions of the law. COBRA information also is required to be contained in the 
summary plan description (SPD) which participants receive. ERISA requires that SPDs containing certain plan information and 
summaries of material changes in plan requirements be furnished to participants in modified and updated SPDs. Plan 
administrators must automatically furnish the SPD booklet 90 days after a person becomes a participant or beneficiary or within 
120 days after the plan is subject to the reporting and disclosure provisions of the law.</p>
<h4>Specific Notices</h4>
<p>Specific notice requirements are triggered for employers, qualified beneficiaries and plan administrators when a qualifying event 
occurs. Employers must notify plan administrators within 30 days of an employee's death, termination, reduced hours of 
employment, entitlement to Medicare or a bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Multiemployer plans may provide for a longer period of time. The employee, retiree or family member should notify the plan 
administrator within 60 days of events consisting of divorce or legal separation or a child's ceasing to be covered as a dependent 
under plan rules.</p>
<p>Disabled beneficiaries must notify plan administrators of Social Security disability determinations. A notice must be provided 
within 60 days of a disability determination and prior to expiration of the 18-month period of COBRA coverage. These 
beneficiaries also must notify the plan administrator within 30 days of a final determination that they are no longer disabled.</p>
<p>Plan administrators, upon notification of a qualifyingevent, must automatically provide a notice to employees and family members 
of their election rights. The notice must be provided in person or by first class mail within 14 days of receiving information that a 
qualifying event has occurred.</p>
<p>There are two special exceptions to the notice requirements for multiemployer plans. First, the time frame for providing notices 
may be extended beyond the 14- and 30-day requirements if allowed by plan rules. Second, employers are relieved of the 
obligation to notify plan administrators when employees terminate or reduce their work hours. Plan administrators are responsible 
for determining whether these qualifying events have occurred.</p>
<h4>ELECTION</h4>
<p>The election period is the time frame during which each qualified beneficiary may choose whether to continue health care 
coverage under an employer's group health plan. Qualified beneficiaries have a 60-day period to elect whether to continue 
coverage. This period is measured from the later of the coverage loss date or the date the notice to elect COBRA coverage is 
sent. COBRA coverage is retroactive if elected and paid for by the qualified beneficiary.</p>
<p>A covered employee or the covered employee's spouse may elect COBRA coverage on behalf of any other qualified 
beneficiary. Each qualified beneficiary, however, may independently elect COBRA coverage. A parent or legal guardian may 
elect on behalf of a minor child.</p>
<p>A waiver of coverage may be revoked by or on behalf of a qualified beneficiary prior to the end of the election period. A 
beneficiary may then reinstate coverage. Then, the plan need only provide continuation coverage beginning on the date the waiver 
is revoked.</p>
<h4>HOW COBRA COVERAGE WORKS</h4>
<p>Example 1:</p>
<p>John Q. participates in the group health plan maintained by the ABC Co. John is fired reason other than gross misconduct and 
his health coverage is terminated. John may elect and pay for a maximum of 18 months of coverage by the employer's group 
health plan at the group rate. (See Paying for COBRA Coverage.)</p>
<p>Example 2:</p>
<p>Day laborer David P. has health coverage through his wife's plan sponsored by the XYZ Co. David loses his health coverage 
when he and his wife become divorced. David may purchase health coverage with the plan of his former wife's employer. Since 
in this case divorce is the qualifying event under COBRA, David is entitled to a maximum of 36 months of COBRA coverage.</p>
<p>Example 3:</p>
<p>RST, Inc. is a small business which maintained an insured group health plan for its 10 employees in 1987 and 1988. Mary H., a 
secretary with six years of service, leaves in June 1988 to take a position with a competing firm which has no health plan. She is 
not entitled to COBRA coverage with the plan of RST, Inc. since the firm had fewer than 20 employees in 1987 and is not 
subject to COBRA requirements.</p>
<p>Example 4:</p>
<p>Jane W., a stock broker, left a brokerage firm in May 1990 to take a position with a chemical company. She was five months 
pregnant at the time. The health plan of the chemical company has a pre-existing condition clause for maternity benefits. Even 
though Jane signs up for the new employer's plan, she has the right to elect and receive coverage under the old plan for COBRA 
purposes because the new plan limits benefits for preexisting conditions.</p>
<h4>COVERED BENEFITS</h4>
<p>Qualified beneficiaries must be offered benefits identical to those received immediately before qualifying for continuation 
coverage.</p>
<p>For example, a beneficiary may have had medical, hospitalization, dental, vision and prescription benefits under single or multiple 
plans maintained by the employer. Assuming a qualified beneficiary had been covered by three separate health plans of his 
former employer on the day preceding the qualifying event, that individual has the right to elect to continue coverage in any of the 
three health plans.</p>
<p>If a plan provides both core and non-core benefits, individuals may generally elect either the entire package or just core benefits. 
Individuals do not have to be given the option to elect just the non-core benefits unless those were the only benefits carried under 
that particular plan before a qualifying event.</p>
<p>Non-core benefits are vision and dental services, except where they are mandated by law in which case they become core 
benefits. Core benefits include all other benefits received by a beneficiary immediately before qualifying for COBRA coverage. 
Beneficiaries may change coverage during periods of open enrollment by the plan.</p>
<h4>DURATION OF COVERAGE</h4>
<p>COBRA establishes required periods of coverage for continuation health benefits. A plan, however, may provide longer periods 
of coverage beyond those required by COBRA. COBRA beneficiaries generally are eligible to pay for group coverage during a 
maximum of 18 months for qualifying events due to employment termination or reduction of hours of work. Certain qualifying 
events, or a second qualifying event during the initial period of coverage, may permit a beneficiary to receive a maximum of 36 
months of coverage.</p>
<p>Coverage begins on the date that coverage would otherwise have been lost by reason of a qualifying event and can end when:</p>
<pre>
* The last day of maximum coverage is reached
* Premiums are not paid on a timely basis
* The employer ceases to maintain any group health plan
* Coverage is obtained with another employer group health plan
    that does not contain any exclusion or limitation with respect
  to any pre-existing condition of such beneficiary
* A beneficiary is entitled to Medicare benefits</pre>
<p>Special rules for disabled individuals may extend the maximum periods of coverage. If a qualified beneficiary is determined under 
Title II or XVI of the Social Security Act to have been disabled at the time of a termination of employment or reduction in hours 
of employment and the qualified beneficiary properly notifies the plan administrator of the disability determination, the 18-month 
period is expanded to 29 months.</p>
<p>Although COBRA specifies certain maximum required periods of time that continued health coverage must be offered to 
qualified beneficiaries, COBRA does not prohibit plans from offering continuation health coverage that goes beyond the COBRA 
periods.</p>
<p>Some plans allow beneficiaries to convert group health coverage to an individual policy. In this case, you must be given the 
option to enroll in a conversion health plan. You usually must enroll in the plan within 180 days before your COBRA coverage 
ends. The premium is generally not at a group rate. The conversion option, however, is not available if you end COBRA 
coverage before reaching the maximum period of entitlement or it is unavailable under the plan.</p>
<h4>PAYING FOR COBRA COVERAGE</h4>
<p>Beneficiaries may be required to pay the entire premium for coverage. It cannot exceed 102 percent of the cost to the plan for 
similarly situated individuals who have not incurred a qualifying event. Premiums reflect the total cost of group health coverage, 
including both the portion paid by employees and any portion paid by the employer before the qualifying event, plus two percent 
for administrative costs.</p>
<p>For disabled beneficiaries, the premium may be increased after 18 months to 150 percent of the plan's total cost of coverage for 
the last 11 months of continuation coverage.</p>
<p>Premiums due may be increased if the costs to the plan increase but generally must be fixed in advance of each 12-month 
premium cycle. The plan must allow you to elect to pay premiums on a monthly basis if requested by you.</p>
<p>The initial premium payment must be made within 45 days after the date of the COBRA election by the qualified beneficiary. 
Payment must cover the period of coverage from the date of COBRA election retroactive to the date of the qualifying event. 
Premiums for successive periods of coverage are due on the date stated in the plan with a minimum 30-day grace period for 
payments. No payment, however, need be made earlier than 45 days after the date of the election.</p>
<p>The due date may not be prior to the first day of the period of coverage. For example, the due date for the month of January 
could not be prior to January 1 and coverage for January could not be cancelled if payment is made by January 31.</p>
<p>Premiums for the rest of the COBRA period must be made within 30 days of the due date for each such premium or such longer 
period as provided by the plan.</p>
<p>COBRA beneficiaries remain subject to the rules of the plan and therefore must satisfy all costs related to deductibles, 
catastrophic and other benefit limits.</p>
<h4>CLAIMS PROCEDURES</h4>
<p>Health plan rules must explain how to obtain benefits and must include written procedures for processing claims. Claims 
procedures are to be included in the SPD booklet.</p>
<p>You should submit a written claim for benefits to whomever is designated to operate the health plan (employer, plan 
administrator, etc.). If the claim is denied, notice of denial must be in writing and furnished generally within 90 days after the claim 
is filed. The notice should state the reasons for the denial. any additional information needed to support the claim and procedures 
for appealing the denial.</p>
<p>You have 60 days to appeal a denial and must receive a decision on the appeal within 60 days after that unless the plan:</p>
<ul>
<li>provides for a special hearing, or </li>
<li>the decision must be made by a group which meets only on a periodic basis. Contact the plan administrator for more 
information on filing a claim for benefits. Complete plan rules are available from employers or benefits offices. There can 
be charges up to 25 cents a page for copies of plan rules.</li>
</ul>
<h4>ROLE OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT</h4>
<p>Continuation coverage laws are administered by several agencies. The Departments of Labor and the Treasury have jurisdiction 
over private sector health plans. The United States Public Health Service administers the continuation coverage law as it affects 
public sector health plans.</p>
<p>The Labor Department's interpretative and regulatory responsibility is limited to the disclosure and notification requirements. If 
you need further information on your election or notification rights with a private sector plan, write to:</p>
<ul>
<li>U.S. Department of Labor<br>
Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration<br>
Division of Technical Assistance and Inquiries<br>
200 Constitution Ave., N.W.<br>
(Room N-5658)<br>
Washington, D.C. 20210<br>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Internal Revenue Service, which is in the Department of the Treasury, is responsible for publishing regulations on COBRA 
provisions relating to eligibility and premiums. Both Labor and Treasury share jurisdiction for enforcement.</p>
<p>The U.S. Public Health Service, located in the Department of Health and Human Services, has published Title XXII of the Public 
Health Service Act entitled &quot;Requirements for Certain Group Health Plans for Certain State and Local Employees.&quot; Information 
about COBRA provisions concerning public sector employees is available from the:</p>
<p>U.S. Public Health Service<br>
Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health<br>
Grants Policy Branch (COBRA)<br>
5600 Fishers Lane<br>
(Room 17A-45)<br>
Rockville, Maryland 20857</p>
<p>Federal employees are covered by a law similar to COBRA. Those employees should contact the personnel office serving their 
agency for more information on temporary extensions of health benefits.</p>
<h4>CONCLUSION</h4>
<p>Rising medical costs have transformed health benefits from a privilege to a household necessity for most Americans. The 
COBRA law creates an opportunity for persons to retain this important benefit.</p>
<p>Workers need to be aware of changes in health care laws to preserve their benefit rights. A good starting point is reading your 
plan booklet. Most of the specific rules on COBRA benefits can be found there or with the person who manages your plan.</p>
<p>Be sure to periodically contact the health plan to find out about any changes in the type or level of benefits offered by the plan.</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Health Claims: Separating Fact from Fiction -- April 1992</h2>
<p>Although health care may well be the number one interest in the country today, health fraud has become a major cause for 
concern. Billions of consumer dollars are wasted on useless remedies and devices. Even worse, consumers with medical 
problems may waste valuable time before getting proper treatment. That delay may do serious harm and endanger lives.</p>
<p>But there are ways to tell which health-related products are legitimate and which are not. This brochure tells you how to spot 
worthless claims and explains how the fraud business works. It describes some typical areas where fraud flourishes and suggests 
what you can do to help stop the problem.</p>
<h4>How You Can Spot Worthless Claims</h4>
<p>Being well-informed enables you to spot health fraud. Learn to recognize worthless products by the typical phrases often used to 
promote them.</p>
<p>Does the ad promise &quot;a quick and easy cure&quot;?</p>
<p>Is the product advertised as effective for a wide range of ailments or for an undiagnosed pain?</p>
<p>Does the promoter use key words such as &quot;miraculous,&quot; &quot;exclusive,&quot; &quot;secret,&quot; or &quot;ancient&quot;?</p>
<p>Is the product advertised as available from only one source, requiring payment in advance?</p>
<p>Does the promoter use undocumented case histories that sound too good to be true?</p>
<p>In addition, don't rely on promises of a &quot;money-back guarantee.&quot; Be aware that many fly-by-night operators will never be there 
to respond to a refund request.</p>
<h4>Why Health Fraud Schemes Work</h4>
<p>Health fraud, or quackery, is a business that sells false hope. It preys on persons who are victims of diseases that have no 
complete medical cures, such as arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and certain forms of cancer. It also thrives on the wishful thinking of 
those who want short-cuts to weight loss or improvements to personal appearance. It makes enormous profits because it claims 
to offer quick cures and easy solutions to better health and personal attractiveness.</p>
<p>Health fraud operators have always been quick to exploit trends. While legitimate medical science is continually advancing, 
unscrupulous promoters are quick to market useless concoctions as medical &quot;breakthroughs.&quot; Recently, for example, fraudulent 
promoters have taken advantage of the fitness movement by selling a variety of useless &quot;weight-loss&quot; products, such as special 
&quot;weight-reducing&quot; garments.</p>
<p>While the health fraud business causes widespread economic harm, the most harmful frauds of all are the ones that turn people 
away from proper medical diagnosis and treatment of serious illnesses. In addition, some bogus products themselves may be 
harmful.</p>
<h4>Where Health Fraud Schemes Occur</h4>
<p>Consumers can avoid problems and save money by learning some basic facts about health fraud. The following sections discuss 
five areas where health fraud commonly occurs. This is not an exhaustive list, but it may help you become better informed and 
spend your health-care dollars more effectively.</p>
<h4>Arthritis</h4>
<p>If you or a family member are one of the estimated 37 million Americans who suffer from one of the many forms of arthritis, be 
aware that this disease invites a flood of fraudulent products. This is because, so far, medical science has found no cure for 
arthritis. The Arthritis Foundation estimates that $1 billion is spent annually on unproven arthritis remedies.</p>
<p>Thousands of dietary and natural &quot;cures&quot; have been sold for arthritis -- mussel extract, vitamin pills, desiccated liver pills, and 
honey and vinegar mixtures. According to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), no herb, either by itself or in combination 
with other ingredients, is a cure for any form of arthritis. In addition, there is no medical evidence to suggest that a lack of 
vitamins or minerals causes arthritis or that taking vitamin or mineral supplements will give relief.</p>
<p>If you have arthritis and are searching for a cure, you should know that arthritis is a serious condition that should be treated by a 
doctor. Miracle &quot;cures,&quot; copper bracelets, and even self-prescribed over-the-counter pain-relieving products cannot take the 
place of appropriate medical advice and treatment. The Arthritis Foundation advises that arthritis symptoms should be monitored 
by a doctor because the problem can worsen if not properly treated.</p>
<p>For a free brochure about unproven remedies, call the Arthritis Foundation, toll-free, 1-800-283-7800 (9:00 a.m. - 7:00 p.m., 
Eastern Time, Monday - Friday), or write: Arthritis Foundation, P.O. Box 19000, Atlanta, Georgia 30326.</p>
<h4>Cancer</h4>
<p>Because the diagnosis of cancer can bring feelings of fear and hopelessness, many people who have been diagnosed as having a 
form of cancer may be tempted to turn to unproven remedies or clinics that promise a cure. As an aid in evaluating cancer-cure 
claims, keep in mind that there is no one device or remedy capable of diagnosing or treating all types of cancer. Cancer is a name 
given to the wide range of diseases requiring different forms of treatment determined by a doctor. Medical science has been able 
to help many cancer patients, but use of a bogus remedy can delay proper diagnosis and treatment by your doctor. For more 
information about the seven early warning signs of cancer, contact the American Cancer Society office listed in your Yellow 
Pages. To order free publications on cancer research and treatment, call the National Cancer Institute's Cancer Information 
Service: 1-800-422-6237.</p>
<h4>Weight Loss</h4>
<p>If you, or others you know, are attempting to lose weight, consider these basic facts:</p>
<p>If you want to lose weight you must lower your calorie intake or increase your calorie use by exercise. Claims that you can eat all 
you want and lose weight effortlessly are not true. There are no products that will let you lose weight effortlessly. Be skeptical 
about any such claims. For example, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) obtained a consent order against a promoter that 
claimed its $300 device, custom fitted to the purchaser's ear, stimulated acupuncture points and controlled hunger. The consent 
order settled FTC charges that the advertising was deceptive. Every diet that works requires reducing your calorie intake or 
increasing your calorie use through exercise. The FTC has specifically held that it is deceptive to advertise otherwise.</p>
<p>If you want to lose weight and tone up as well, you must exercise. If you want to look fit, particularly as you grow older, you 
must exercise. Any product that promises to trim you down and tone you up effortlessly is a fraud.</p>
<h4>Fat Deposits</h4>
<p>&quot;Cellulite&quot; is a name advertisers sometimes use for the fat that some people accumulate around their thighs, buttocks, and 
stomachs. Before you buy products advertised to dissolve &quot;cellulite,&quot; here are some important things to keep in mind:</p>
<p>No amount of rubbing, wrapping, massaging, or scrubbing will get rid of fat deposits. The best way to reduce fat deposits is by 
dieting to lose weight and exercising to improve muscle tone.</p>
<p>No special vitamin or mineral supplement can dissolve fat deposits. Again, the best way to lose weight -- including fat on thighs, 
buttocks, and stomach -- is to follow a sensible diet and exercise program.</p>
<p>For more information about nutrition, diet, health, and exercise, write to the American Heart Association, Suite 200, 2233 
Wisconsin Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20007.</p>
<h4>Baldness</h4>
<p>If you are bald or your hair is thinning, you may be a target for health fraud. You should know that:</p>
<p>No over-the-counter cream, lotion, or device can prevent baldness, induce new hair to grow, or cause hair to become thicker. 
Over-the-counter (non-prescription), do-it-yourself &quot;remedies&quot; are ineffective because most baldness is hereditary. Ninety 
percent of all baldness is due to the inherited trait known as &quot;male pattern baldness.&quot; Also, no over-the-counter cream, lotion, or 
device can treat other types of baldness, including those caused by ringworm, systemic disease, glandular defects, or local 
infection. For a proper diagnosis of the cause of baldness and to discuss possible treatment, see your physician.</p>
<p>Artificial hair implants are dangerous and will not stimulate natural hair growth. The implanting of polyester or modacrylic fibers 
into the scalp can cause serious infections, bleeding, and loss of natural hair. According to a complaint brought by the FTC 
against one company, such implants are generally recognized by doctors as unsafe and ineffective treatment for baldness, thinning 
hair, the loss of hair, or for the replacement of lost hair. Synthetic implanted hairs fall out or break off shortly after being inserted. 
Such treatment has a high probability of discomfort and pain and a high risk of infection, skin disease, and scarring.</p>
<p>For additional information about baldness, write to the American Academy of Dermatology, P.O. Box 3116, Evanston, Illinois 
60204-3116.</p>
<h4>What Federal Agencies Do To Stop Health Fraud And What You Can Do To Help</h4>
<p>Although the government requires that over-the-counter drugs satisfy established standards of safety and effectiveness before 
being marketed, many unscrupulous companies advertise and sell products without meeting these requirements. There are, 
however, laws that prohibit health fraud in the marketplace and those laws can be enforced against sellers and advertisers of 
bogus products. At the federal level, three agencies have principal responsibility for monitoring the sale and advertising of 
fraudulent health products. By being aware of the health fraud problem and by reporting suspicious products to the appropriate 
agency, you can help get dangerous or worthless products off the market.</p>
<h4>The Food and Drug Administration</h4>
<p>The FDA has jurisdiction over the content and labeling of foods, drugs, medical devices, and cosmetic products. The FDA can 
take law enforcement action to seize and prohibit the sale of products that are falsely labeled. If you have questions or wish to 
report a fraudulent company, contact an FDA field office (listed in your phone book under Department of Health and Human 
Services), or write to: FDA Headquarters, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, Maryland 20857.</p>
<h4>The Federal Trade Commission</h4>
<p>The FTC has jurisdiction over the advertising and marketing of foods, non-prescription drugs, cosmetics, medical devices, and 
health care services. Under the FTC Act, unfair or deceptive acts or practices, in or affecting commerce, are illegal. The FTC 
has the authority to prohibit such acts or practices. It can seek federal court injunctions to halt fraudulent claims quickly and to 
obtain redress for injured consumers. If you have questions about claims made in advertising or in other promotions for health or 
cosmetic products or services, write to: Correspondence Branch, Federal Trade Commission, Washington, D.C. 20580.</p>
<h4>United States Postal Service</h4>
<p>The USPS has jurisdiction over fraudulent health care products that are advertised or sold through the mail. To complain about 
fraudulent mail order products, write to: Chief Postal Inspector, United States Postal Service, Washington, D.C. 20260-2112.</p>
<h4>Where To Get More Information</h4>
<p>In general, ask questions and seek information from a wide variety of sources. In addition to the FDA, FTC, and USPS 
contacts, you may want to use these other resources.</p>
<p>When you have a question about the value of a product, ask your pharmacist or doctor.</p>
<p>Contact officials in your state Attorney General's office or your local consumer agency to get more information or to report 
problems. These offices will be listed in your telephone directory.</p>
<p>Write or call the Better Business Bureau for information or to report a problem. Check your telephone directory for the office 
nearest you, or write to: Council of Better Business Bureaus, 4200 Wilson Boulevard, Arlington, Virginia 22203.</p>
<p>Check your local library for books on health care and particular health issues, including fraud and quackery.</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Health Spas: Exercise Your Rights -- November 1992</h2>
<p>Looking for a way to get in shape? You may be considering joining a health spa, a place where members work to improve their 
physical condition through exercise, weight control, and other treatments. While many people regularly use and enjoy health spas, 
others have written the Federal Trade Commission with complaints. The most frequent complaints concern high pressure sales 
tactics, misrepresentations about facilities and services, spas that go out of business, and failure to honor cancellation and refund 
clauses. You may avoid disappointment, however, if you find out about the spa's fees, contractual requirements, and facilities 
before you join. Here are some suggestions for comparison shopping for a health spa.</p>
<h4>Inspect the Spa</h4>
<p>Visit during the hours you would normally use the spa to see if it is overcrowded during that period. Notice whether the facilities 
are clean and well-maintained and note the condition of the equipment. You also may want to ask questions like these.</p>
<p>&quot;Is there a trial period during which I can sample services free of charge?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How many members do you have? Is there a limit to the number of people who can join?&quot; Many spas set no membership limit. 
So while the spa may not be crowded during your visit, this condition may change -- especially if the spa is new.</p>
<p>&quot;What hours will I be able to use the spa?&quot; A spa may be open all week, but may be limited to men on some days and women 
on others.</p>
<p>&quot;What qualifications or special training do your instructors have?&quot;</p>
<h4>Consider Contracts Carefully</h4>
<p>Some spas ask you to join right away. You might be offered special time-limited rates as an incentive. But if you wait a few days, 
you may make a better decision. Take the contract home and read it carefully. Before you sign it, see if you can answer these 
questions:</p>
<p>Is everything the salesperson promised written in the contract? If a problem arises after you join, the contract will probably 
govern the dispute. If something is not written in the contract, do not count on it being resolved.</p>
<p>Is there a &quot;cooling-off&quot; period? Some spas give you several days to reconsider your decision to join after you have signed the 
contract.</p>
<p>Can you get a refund if you need to cancel? If you move, become disabled, or just want to stop using the spa, can you get a 
refund or get out of your contract. This is especially important if you choose a long-term membership.</p>
<p>Can you join for a short time only? It may be to your advantage to pay a little more money and join for only a few &quot;trial&quot; months. 
That way, if you are not enjoying the membership or using it as much as you planned, you will not be committed to many years of 
payments.</p>
<p>Can you afford the payments? Take into consideration the finance charges and annual percentage rates when you figure the total 
cost of your membership. Figure this cost per week and per day to give you a better idea of what it will cost to use the spa.</p>
<h4>For More Information</h4>
<p>Before you join a spa, you may want to contact your local consumer protection office, state Attorney General, or Better 
Business Bureau to find out if they have received any complaints about the spa or if there are state laws regulating health spa 
sales. If problems arise after you join, you also can contact these offices for assistance.</p>
<p>Although the FTC cannot intervene in individual cases, the staff monitors health spa practices and would like to receive a copy of 
any consumer complaints. Write to: Correspondence Branch, Federal Trade Commission, Washington, D.C. 20580.</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Hearing Aids -- November 1992</h2>
<p>Produced in cooperation with the American Association of Retired Persons</p>
<p>More than 21 million Americans suffer from some type of hearing impairment. Fortunately, many of these people can benefit 
from the use of a hearing aid. However, hearing aids cannot work for everyone. Those who can be helped need to be carefully 
fitted. This brochure provides information about hearing loss and things to look for when shopping for a hearing aid. It stresses 
the importance of a medical exam and the value of a trial period.</p>
<h4>Types of Hearing Loss</h4>
<p>The two basic types of hearing loss are conductive and sensorineural. Conductive hearing loss involves the outer and middle ear. 
It can result from a blockage of wax, a punctured eardrum, birth defects, ear infections, or heredity. Usually, conductive hearing 
loss can be corrected medically or surgically. Sensorineural, or &quot;nerve&quot; hearing loss involves damage to the inner ear. It can be 
caused by aging, prenatal and birth-related problems, viral and bacterial infections, heredity, trauma (such as a severe blow to 
the head), exposure to loud noises, the use of certain drugs, fluid buildup in the inner ear, or a benign tumor in the inner ear. Only 
in rare cases can sensorineural hearing loss be medically or surgically corrected. It is the type of hearing loss that is most 
commonly managed with a hearing aid. Sensorineural hearing loss can affect selective portions of a person's range of hearing. 
Therefore, the degree of hearing loss and the specific levels of pitch (frequencies) affected will vary from person to person. Even 
in instances where the pattern of the loss is the same, the degree of sound clarity may vary from person to person or may differ 
between ears for one individual. As a result, individuals suffering from sensorineural hearing loss often require a hearing aid 
tailored to the specific sensitivity and the pattern of hearing loss.</p>
<h4>Purchase Suggestions</h4>
<p>A hearing aid is an electronic device that picks up sound waves with a tiny microphone. The microphone makes weaker sounds 
louder and sends them to the ear through a tiny speaker. Because a hearing aid is an amplification device, a person must have 
some hearing to benefit from its use. In addition, because hearing loss has a variety of patterns and degrees of severity and 
affects people in different ways, no single hearing aid is right for everyone.</p>
<p>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) offers the following suggestions if you are considering the purchase of a hearing aid.</p>
<h4>Consider getting an ear examination</h4>
<p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends that you have your ears examined by a licensed physician. Ear 
examinations are universally recommended by the medical community to ensure there are no underlying diseases or medical 
problems causing the hearing loss. A hearing loss may be a symptom of another medical problem that needs a doctor's attention. 
Also, the cause and severity of a hearing loss vary widely from person to person. Be wary of any advertisements for hearing aids 
that play down the need for a medical examination and a hearing test. Dispensers or providers that encourage you to sign a 
waiver for a medical examination may be selling products that do not meet industry standards.</p>
<p>Get a hearing evaluation from a dispenser or an audiologist Have your hearing tested to assess your ability to hear with and 
without a hearing aid. This test will enable a dispenser or audiologist to select and fit a hearing aid to your individual needs. (The 
term &quot;dispenser&quot; refers to anyone selling hearing aids, whether the person is a hearing aid dealer or an audiologist.)</p>
<h4>Check out the dispenser</h4>
<p>Before you buy, check the reliability of local hearing aid dispensers with your local Better Business Bureau (BBB), consumer 
protection agency, or state attorney general. You also may want to verify the reliability of dispensers and physicians with their 
licensing boards in your state capital. Ask if there are any complaints on file, and how the company or professional has 
responded to the complaint.</p>
<h4>Ask the dispenser or audiologist about a trial period</h4>
<p>Many manufacturers, hearing specialists, and consumer groups recommend, and some state laws require, that consumers be 
given at least a 30-day trial period with only a small service fee (varying from five to 20 percent of the purchase price) if the 
consumer returns the product. In fact, manufacturers routinely make adjustments and permit hearing aid returns within 60 to 90 
days at no charge to the dispenser. A trial period is strong protection for such an important purchase, so ask before you buy. 
Remember, if you purchase a hearing aid from a door-to-door salesperson you have the right under the FTC's Door-to-Door 
Sales Rule to cancel within three business days of any sale for $25 or more. The sale may take place in your home, or at a 
location that is not the seller's regular place of business. If you are thinking of buying a hearing aid through the mail, consider the 
difficulty of getting the right hearing aid for your needs and a proper fit. Although there is no federal law against the mail order 
sale of hearing aids, several states have banned hearing aid sales by mail. In states that do allow the sale of aids by mail, the 
transaction is subject to the FTC's Mail Order Rule. This rule requires companies to ship purchases made by mail when 
promised or give consumers the option to cancel their order for a refund.</p>
<h4>Be aware of sales practices</h4>
<p>Avoid being pressured into buying a hearing aid. As with any other medical decision, you should be given the opportunity to seek 
additional information or a second opinion. Sales personnel using high-pressure approaches demonstrate little concern for your 
well being.</p>
<h4>Purchase Agreements</h4>
<p>The hearing aid purchase agreement, or contract, should contain all terms of the transaction in writing, including an explanation of 
all verbal promises. In reviewing your agreement, remember to consider the following:</p>
<h4>Is there a written warranty?</h4>
<p>Is the warranty honored by the manufacturer or by the dispenser? (In some cases warranties by the manufacturer may not be 
recognized unless the hearing aid is purchased from a seller authorized by the manufacturer.)</p>
<p>What services, if any, will be provided free of charge, and how long will they be provided?</p>
<p>Will you receive a &quot;loaner&quot; if your hearing aid needs to be repaired?</p>
<p>Do business with a dispenser who will clarify these details and put all verbal commitments into the written contract.</p>
<h4>Federal Standards for Sales</h4>
<p>The FTC is responsible for monitoring the business practices of hearing aid dispensers and vendors. Under the Federal Trade 
Commission Act, the FTC can take action against a company that misleads or deceives consumers. Such a company may use 
misleading sales and advertising practices -- giving inaccurate information about hearing loss, performance of a hearing aid, 
refund policies, or warranty coverage. The Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, which the FTC enforces, provides consumers with 
certain protections relating to warranties. This act requires a company offering a warranty to fully disclose all its terms and 
conditions.</p>
<p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) enforces regulations that deal specifically with the manufacture and sale of hearing 
aids, because these products are recognized as medical devices. FDA regulations have the force of federal law. According to the 
FDA, the following conditions must be met by all dispensers before selling a hearing aid:</p>
<p>Dispensers must obtain a written statement from the patient signed by a licensed physician. It must be dated within the previous 
six months, state that the patient's ears have been medically evaluated, and state that the patient is cleared for fitting with a 
hearing aid.</p>
<p>A patient, age 18 or older, can sign a waiver for a medical examination, but dispensers must advise the patient that waiving the 
examination is not in the patient's best health interest.</p>
<p>Dispensers must avoid encouraging the patient to waive the medical evaluation requirement.</p>
<p>Dispensers must advise patients who appear to have a hearing problem to consult promptly with a physician.</p>
<p>The FDA regulations require that an instruction brochure be provided with the hearing aid that illustrates and describes its 
operation, use, and care. The brochure also must list sources for repair and maintenance and include a statement that the use of a 
hearing aid may be only part of a rehabilitative program.</p>
<h4>State Standards for Sales</h4>
<p>In addition to federal regulation, many states have laws that apply to the sale of hearing aids. Most states license hearing aid 
dispensers, and several states prohibit the sale of hearing aids through the mail. Purchasers also may be protected by implied 
warranties, created by state law. Your state Attorney General's Office can provide you with particular information about state 
laws that apply to the sale of hearing aids. The state Attorney General's Office also will have information on whether hearing aid 
dispensers must be licensed or certified by the state. Some hearing professionals, such as physicians and audiologists, may be 
licensed by a state regulatory agency. These agencies may provide helpful information for individuals considering a hearing aid 
purchase.</p>
<h4>Where to Complain</h4>
<p>If you have questions or complaints concerning the sales practices of a hearing aid dispenser, contact your state Attorney 
General's Office, local consumer protection agency, the Better Business Bureau, and write: Correspondence Branch, Federal 
Trade Commission, Washington, D.C. 20580. Although the FTC usually does not resolve individual disputes, the agency may 
take action against a company if there is evidence of a pattern of deceptive or unfair practices.</p>

<h2>Hearing Loss and the Hard of Hearing: Identifying, Understanding and 
Coping</h2>
<p>Do you know: </p>
<ul>
<li>24 million people in the U.S. have a hearing loss. </li>
<li>30 of every one thousand school age children have a hearing loss. </li>
<li>By age 65, one out of three people has a hearing loss. </li>
<li>78% of hard of hearing people experience their loss in adulthood. </li>
<li>75% of people who could benefit from hearing aids are not using them. </li>
<li>People with hearing loss wait for an average of seven years before seeking help? </li>
<li>Isolation, withdrawal, and depression are common reactions to hearing loss. </li>
<li>Hearing impaired people have a much higher divorce rate than hearing people. </li>
</ul>
<p>Common signs of hearing loss: </p>
<ul>
<li>You may hear but not understand people. </li>
<li>You may have difficulty understanding radio, television or public address systems. </li>
<li>You need to watch a person's lips in order to understand. </li>
<li>You find yourself asking people them to repeat what they have said. </li>
<li>You may pretend to understand. </li>
<li>You may avoid people and isolate yourself. </li>
<li>You may find it emotionally and physically exhausting to communicate. </li>
<li>It appears that you are the only one who has these difficulties. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Hearing Aids</h3>
<p>Hearing aids are too often a last resort, tried long after experiencing much frustration, withdrawal, denial, bluffing and avoiding.</p>
<p>Contrary to some advertisements, hearing aids do not make your hearing normal; they are just part of the solution. Many people 
give up when the hearing aid doesn't solve the problem immediately. Coping successfully with hearing loss requires many 
adjustments and changes, giving up old habits and learning new ones. This learning process cannot be accomplished in isolation; 
you need support, information, and resources. </p>
<h3>Assistive Listening Devices</h3>
<p>Hearing aids alone are not adequate in many environments, such as cars, airplanes, restaurants, theatres, hospitals, churches, and 
classrooms, due to background noise, proximity to speaker, volume, and acoustics.</p>
<p>In addition, hearing aids alone are often inadequate for understanding speech on the telephone and television.</p>
<p>Fortunately, electronic technology and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) have combined to effectively increase access 
to public accommodations, television closed captioning, and telephone devices, all free of charge to the hearing impaired. There 
are a variety of assistive listening devices (ALDs) for different situations and settings and many offer ALDs upon request. 
However, many settings that are required by law to provide ALDs don't have them yet, partially because not enough people 
have requested them. Only a small percentage of hearing impaired people are knowledgeable about ALDs and assertive about 
asking for them. All hospitals, churches, theatres, etc., will provide ALDs when people demand them.</p>
<p>If you are hard of hearing, you need to know </p>
<ul>
<li>Why you don't hear well. </li>
<li>How to tell others. </li>
<li>How to get help. </li>
<li>How to use and protect your hearing. </li>
<li>How to use Assistive Listening Devices. </li>
<li>How to use your hearing aids successfully. </li>
<li>How hearing loss affects you and your relationships. </li>
<li>How to create an environment where you can hear. </li>
<li>What the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) means to you </li>
<li>How to assert your ADA rights in public places and on the job </li>
</ul>
<p>The consequences of hearing loss are many. </p>
<ul>
<li>First, the emotional consequences are anxiety, depression, negativism, irritability, embarrassment, frustration, anger, low 
self-esteem, and impatience. </li>
<li>The social consequences are avoidance, silence, rejection, loss of intimacy, boredom, withdrawal, misunderstandings, 
conflict, and misinformation. </li>
<li>Last, the physical consequences are indigestion, tension, headaches, high blood pressure, fatigue, heart disease, low 
tolerance for loud noises, and endangerment. </li>
</ul>
<p>You need to teach others how to communicate with a hearing impaired person: </p>
<ul>
<li>Do not shout. </li>
<li>Stand in clear light. </li>
<li>Face the person directly. </li>
<li>Speak slowly and clearly. </li>
<li>Rephrase a misunderstood sentence. </li>
<li>Move away from background noise. </li>
<li>Do not obscure your mouth with hands, food, etc. </li>
<li>Ask what you can do to make conversation easier. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Help</h3>
<p>Self Help for Hard of Hearing People Inc. [SHHH] is a volunteer, international organization of people with hearing loss, their 
relatives and friends. It is a nonprofit, nonsectarian, educational organization devoted to the welfare and interests of those who 
cannot hear well but are committed to participation in the hearing world. </p>
<p>SHHH is the largest international consumer organization dedicated to the well being of people who do not hear well. </p>
<p>SHHH believes that people can help one another, be helped, and participate successfully in society. Its primary mission is to 
educate about hearing loss and what can be done about it. Members work to develop options for themselves and open doors for 
others. SHHH encourages self-help to bridge the gap between those who can't hear well and those who can. </p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Indoor Tanning -- March 1993</h2>
<p>&quot;Tan indoors with absolutely no harmful side effects&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No burning, no drying, and no sun damage&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Unlike the sun, indoor tanning will not cause skin cancer or skin aging&quot;</p>
<p>You may have heard claims like these about indoor tanning and wondered whether indoor tanning devices are truly a safe 
alternative to outdoor tanning. But whether you tan outdoors in natural sunlight or indoors in a suntan salon, tanning is not 
risk-free. Overexposure can cause eye injury, premature aging and wrinkling of the skin, and increase your chances of 
developing skin cancer.</p>
<p>According to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), consumers can be harmed if advertising leads them to believe that they can 
get a tan without the harmful effects of the sun. The information in this factsheet may help you understand how tanning devices 
work and why the same health risks associated with outdoor tanning are associated with indoor tanning. To help you minimize 
risks, including those posed by indoor tanning, a checklist is provided at the end of this factsheet.</p>
<h4>What the Risks Are</h4>
<p>Whether you tan outdoors during the summer months or tan indoors exclusively, you are increasing your chances of:</p>
<p>* developing skin cancer later in life</p>
<p>* suffering cataracts and retinal damage</p>
<p>* developing premature skin wrinkling</p>
<p>* developing ultraviolet light-induced skin rashes when you eat certain foods or take some common medications, such as birth 
control pills or antihistamines.</p>
<p>If you tan year 'round, you obviously will increase your skin's exposure to the dangers of ultraviolet rays. Being informed about 
how tanning devices work can help you spot misleading claims and avoid skin damage.</p>
<h4>How Tanning Devices Work</h4>
<p>The most popular device used in salons is a clamshell-like tanning bed. The customer lies down on a Plexiglas surface and 
relaxes as lights from above and below reach the body. Older devices generally used light sources that emitted shortwave 
ultraviolet rays (UVB), often advertised as &quot;tanning&quot; rays, that actually caused burning. Aware of the harmful effects of UVB 
radiation, including the increased risk of skin cancer, salon owners began using tanning beds that emit mostly longwave (UVA) 
light sources, which some claimed to be safe. But the UVA rays also can be harmful to the skin because they penetrate so 
deeply, as explained below.</p>
<h4>Why Certain Advertising Claims May Be False</h4>
<p>You can make a more informed decision about indoor tanning if you learn how to spot misleading tanning claims. The following 
section discusses why each of four claims sometimes made about indoor tanning is misleading.</p>
<p>False Claim #1: &quot;You can achieve a deep year-round tan with gentle, comfortable, and safe UVA light.&quot;</p>
<p>To understand why doctors are concerned about tanning salons, you need to understand how ultraviolet rays can affect your 
skin. Shortwave ultraviolet rays called UVB can burn the outer layer of skin; longwave ultraviolet rays called UVA penetrate 
more deeply and can weaken the skin's inner connective tissue.</p>
<p>Long-term exposure to the sun, to artificial sources of ultraviolet light, or to both, contributes to the risk of the three kinds of skin 
cancer: basal cell, an otherwise benign skin cancer that can cause scarring; squamous cell, which is usually benign but which can 
spread through the body if left untreated; and melanoma, one of the most fatal kinds of cancer.</p>
<p>False Claim #2: &quot;No harsh glare, so no goggles or eye shades are necessary.&quot;</p>
<p>Studies show that too much exposure to ultraviolet rays, including UVA rays, can damage the retina. Over-exposure can burn 
the cornea, and repeated exposure over many years can change the structure of an eye lens so that it begins to cloud, forming a 
cataract. If left untreated, cataracts result in blindness. The Food and Drug Administration requires tanning salons to direct all 
customers to wear protective eye goggles. Closing your eyes, wearing ordinary sunglasses, or using cotton wads are not strong 
enough measures to protect the cornea from the intensity of UV radiation in tanning devices.</p>
<p>Long-term exposure to natural sunlight also can result in eye damage, but, in the sun, you will be more aware that your eyelids 
are burning than when you tan indoors. The skin exposed to indoor UV lights remains cool to the touch. In addition, the intensity 
of lights used in tanning devices is much greater--and potentially more hazardous to your eyes--than the intensity of UV rays in 
natural sunlight.</p>
<p>False Claim #3: &quot;Tan year 'round without the harmful side effects often associated with natural sunlight.&quot; Exposure to tanning 
salon rays increases the damage caused by sunlight. This occurs because ultraviolet light actually thins the skin, making it less able 
to heal.</p>
<p>Too much exposure to ultraviolet rays also results in premature aging. A &quot;healthy&quot; looking tan is, in fact, damaged skin that is 
more likely to wrinkle and sag than skin that has not been tanned. Over time, you may notice certain undesirable changes in the 
way your skin looks and heals. According to some skin specialists, skin that has a dry, wrinkled, leathery appearance early in 
middle age is a consequence of UV exposure that occurred in youth.</p>
<p>False Claim # 4: &quot;No danger in exposure or burning.&quot; Whether you tan indoors or outdoors, studies show the combination of 
ultraviolet rays and some medicines, birth control pills, cosmetics, and soaps may accelerate skin burns or produce painful 
adverse skin reactions, such as rashes. In addition, tanning devices may induce such common light-sensitive skin ailments as cold 
sores.</p>
<h4>How to Minimize Risks: A Checklist</h4>
<p>If you do choose to tan, either outdoors or indoors, at a salon or at home, you may want to use this checklist to help you 
minimize some of the associated risks.</p>
<h4>Exposure Limits</h4>
<p>If you do choose to tan, it is important to limit your exposure to avoid burning. If you tan with a device:</p>
<p>Does the device manufacturer or the salon staff provide recommended exposure limits for your skin type?</p>
<p>Is there a timer you can set on the tanning device that automatically shuts off the lights or somehow signals you regarding your 
exposure time?</p>
<p>Remember: Exposure time affects burning. Total UV dosage, whether received in a few large doses or in many smaller ones over 
a long period of time, can cause skin cancer and premature aging. Your age at the time of exposure also is a critical factor 
relative to burning. Studies suggest that children and teens are harmed more by equivalent amounts of UVB rays than are adults. 
The earlier you start tanning, the earlier skin injury may occur.</p>
<h4>Eye Protection</h4>
<p>When using a tanning device, it is important to use eye protection because UV light can harm the corneas without your being 
aware of any injury.</p>
<p>Are safety goggles provided and is their use mandatory?</p>
<p>Do the goggles fit snugly?</p>
<p>Does the salon sterilize the goggles after each use to prevent the spread of eye infection?</p>
<p>Remember: Artificial UV light is more intense and, therefore, potentially more damaging than that found in sunlight.</p>
<h4>Medical Histories</h4>
<p>Whether you choose to tan indoors or outdoors, it is important to consider your medical history.</p>
<p>Are you undergoing treatment for lupus or diabetes, or are you susceptible to cold sores? These conditions can be severely 
aggravated if you are exposed to ultraviolet radiation from tanning devices, sunlamps, or natural sunlight.</p>
<p>Do you use antihistamines, tranquilizers, birth control pills, and other medications that are known to increase the likelihood of 
rashes, sunburns, and other allergic-type reactions when used with the sun or artificial light?</p>
<p>If you tan at a salon, does it maintain such information about the medications and the treatment you are taking on a file with your 
medical history and does the staff update it periodically?</p>
<p>Remember: Check with your personal physician or other health-care provider if you have questions about possible side effects 
associated with tanning.</p>
<h4>A Special Note About Sunscreens</h4>
<p>If you tan indoors, you also may spend some time in the sun. If you do, you may benefit from using sunscreens with high sun 
protection factor (SFP) numbers, such as 15 or greater. The SPF number gives you some idea how long you can remain in the 
sun before burning. If, for example, you would normally burn in 10 minutes without sunscreen, applying a 15 SPF sunscreen may 
provide you with about 150 minutes in the sun before burning. Swimming and perspiration reduce the actual SPF value for many 
sunscreens.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, even sunscreens with high SPF numbers offer you less than full protection. Sunlight exposes you to two kinds of 
ultraviolet light, called UVA and UVB. Both can cause skin damage, including wrinkling and skin cancer.</p>
<p>SPF sunscreen numbers indicate sunburn protection from UVB rays only. There is no way, then, to tell how much UVA 
protection you are getting. Some researchers estimate that the level of protection in many products advertising UVA protection, 
even those with high SPF numbers, may be equivalent to an SPF 3 or 4. To learn more about sunscreen protection, ask for a 
free copy of the FTC's brochure, Sunscreens. Write: Public Reference, Federal Trade Commission, Washington, DC 20580.</p>
<h4>What Federal Agencies are Doing About Deceptive Tanning Claims</h4>
<p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) share responsibilities in the regulation of 
sunlamps and tanning devices. FDA is responsible for the labeling of the devices; the FTC is responsible for investigating false, 
misleading, and deceptive advertising claims. When these agencies determine that labels or advertisements are not based on valid 
scientific facts, they have the jurisdiction to take corrective action. The FDA also can remove the products from the salon or 
from the marketplace.</p>
<p>If you have questions or complaints about claims made in tanning device advertising, write: Correspondence Branch, Federal 
Trade Commission, Washington, D.C. 20580.</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Infertility Services -- October 1993</h2>
<p>About one in six U.S. couples is infertile. If you are among them, you may have considered contacting a health care provider that 
offers advanced infertility services.</p>
<p>Most infertility service providers will tell you what their record has been in helping couples. But in talking with or writing to 
different providers, you may find that success rates are calculated differently--making it confusing to select among the more than 
200 programs offering these advanced services. In addition, a particular infertility service may have a lower success rate than 
others, but specialize in more difficult cases. Or, a service may have a very good overall success rate, but not be the best one to 
treat your particular problem. Infertility experts emphasize that your chances for success depend on many factors, such as age 
and cause of infertility.</p>
<p>The staff at the Federal Trade Commission has reviewed how success-rate claims are calculated by infertility services. The 
following information may help in evaluating these claims and selecting the best program for your specific needs.</p>
<h4>Terms You Need To Know</h4>
<p>In vitro fertilization (IVF): In this procedure, a woman's eggs are retrieved and combined with sperm to fertilize in the laboratory. 
Any fertilized eggs, called embryos, are returned to the uterus.</p>
<p>The steps in IVF are:</p>
<p>Step 1 Egg Stimulation Step 2 Egg Retrieval Step 3 Fertilization Step 4 Embryo Transfer</p>
<p>If all goes well, the next two steps are:</p>
<p>Step 5 Clinical Pregnancy Step 6 Live Birth</p>
<p>Gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT): This procedure differs from IVF in that retrieved eggs and sperm are injected into a 
woman's fallopian tubes where fertilization can take place. Because fertilization does not take place outside the body, there is no 
embryo transfer step in GIFT.</p>
<p>Egg Stimulation: This refers to the administration of fertility drugs to a woman to &quot;stimulate&quot; and increase egg production.</p>
<p>Egg Retrieval: This process involves the removal of an egg from the ovaries and follicles for subsequent fertilization through IVF 
or GIFT.</p>
<p>Fertilization: The retrieved egg is mixed with sperm, after which the egg becomes fertilized and forms what then becomes an 
embryo.</p>
<p>Embryo Transfer: After an egg and sperm fertilize in the laboratory, the newly formed embryo is transferred to the uterus.</p>
<p>Clinical Pregnancy: This is a pregnancy which has been confirmed by ultrasound or other clinical means. Prior to this point, a 
blood test or a urinary pregnancy test may indicate a pregnancy. Such tests look for human chorionic gonadotropin or hCG. If 
the blood or urinary tests indicate a positive reading, then the pregnancy is referred to as a &quot;chemical pregnancy.&quot; Infertility 
service providers generally do not accept chemical pregnancies as anything more than an indicator because conditions other than 
pregnancy can account for a positive reading.</p>
<p>Live Birth: This refers to the actual live birth of one or more babies. In determining success-rate date using live births, the industry 
standard is to count a &quot;live birth&quot; as a single delivery, regardless of how many babies were born.</p>
<h4>How Success Rates are Advertised</h4>
<p>As you contact infertility service providers, consider carefully how success rates are calculated. Make sure to ask for the success 
rate for people who fit your particular patient profile, such as your age and cause of infertility.</p>
<p>Ask which specific procedures are included or omitted in the figures. This information can be difficult to understand, so ask for it 
in &quot;plain English.&quot;</p>
<p>Included here are explanations of some frequently used success-rate calculations. For help in understanding these definitions, 
please refer to &quot;Terms You Need to Know&quot; on pages 3-4.</p>
<h4>Live Birth Rate per Egg Stimulation</h4>
<p>This figure tells how many births occurred in relation to the number of egg-stimulation procedures performed. Experts say this 
figure is the most meaningful overall success-rate statistic, because it includes live births as well as all procedures performed, 
including those that failed.</p>
<h4>Live Birth Rate per Embryo Transfer</h4>
<p>This figure refers to the percentage of births from all embryo transfer procedures. Although this number reflects live births--which 
may be the most meaningful figure--it does not include those instances where the attempt at egg stimulation, egg retrieval, and 
fertilization did not succeed.</p>
<h4>Pregnancy Rate per Attempted Egg Stimulation</h4>
<p>This rate refers to the number of clinical pregnancies resulting from all egg-stimulation attempts. This figure does not tell you 
whether these pregnancies resulted in live births, but does include the women who received multiple treatments.</p>
<h4>Pregnancy Rate per Woman in the Program</h4>
<p>This rate refers to how many clinical pregnancies occurred per woman in the program. Excluded from this figure are the number 
of births and the number of times an individual woman may have undergone the procedure prior to achieving a pregnancy.</p>
<h4>Pregnancy Rate per Attempted Egg Retrieval</h4>
<p>This rate reflects the number of clinical pregnancies resulting from all egg-retrieval attempts. This statistic does not tell whether 
these pregnancies resulted in live births and does not include instances where egg stimulation did not produce an egg to retrieve.</p>
<h4>Pregnancy Rate per Embryo Transfer</h4>
<p>This usually refers to how many clinical pregnancies occurred in relation to the number of embryo-transfer procedures 
performed. This figure does not say how many births occurred or how successful the program was in stimulating egg production, 
in obtaining egg retrieval, and in fertilizing eggs retrieved.</p>
<p>It takes time for new infertility service providers to establish success rates based on live births. For this reason, some providers 
cite only national statistics in discussing success rates. Be wary of any claims not based on a provider's own experience. Experts 
say it is fair for new providers to report anticipated births by including those pregnancies that have progressed beyond 26 
weeks--at which point the pregnancy is highly likely to continue to term.</p>
<p>Some providers also favor reporting &quot;cumulative&quot; pregnancy and birth rate claims. Cumulative rates suggest the overall 
probability of a pregnancy or birth occurring based on women undergoing several successive procedures. You may want to ask 
how such calculations are made and what percentage of patients were able to go through multiple treatments. Evaluate all claims 
of success carefully.</p>
<h4>How to Select an Infertility Service</h4>
<p>You may want to begin your search for fertility specialists by asking your gynecologist, obstetrician, family doctor, or friends and 
relatives for recommendations. Ask your local hospital or medical society for names. In addition, you may want to contact local 
infertility support groups, which can provide you with both information and emotional support.</p>
<p>Plan to talk with several providers of infertility services before taking any particular course of action. By doing so, you can 
compare programs, gain more information about the field, and learn about different treatments applicable to your situation.</p>
<p>You may want to contact infertility programs first by telephone, study any literature sent to you and, then, visit those that most 
interest you. Try to select an infertility provider that you feel comfortable with and is convenient for you. Here are some questions 
to ask providers.</p>
<p>What is your infertility service's success rate and how is it calculated? For established programs: What is your live birth rate per 
egg stimulation attempted? For new programs: What is your live birth rate plus ongoing pregnancies past 26 weeks per egg 
stimulation?</p>
<p>You will want to examine how each infertility service tabulates its success rate and consider how meaningful these figures are. 
What is your success rate with couples who have problems similar to ours?</p>
<p>Most importantly, find out how successful an infertility service has been in helping couples with your specific problems. Tell the 
staff your individual circumstances. Then ask: &quot;Given our particular medical history, what are our chances of having a baby after 
undergoing a single egg stimulation procedure?&quot;</p>
<p>How long has your infertility service been in existence? How many patients have you treated? What is the specific training of your 
medical personnel?</p>
<p>You probably will want to select a program that is well established, has worked with many patients, and has a highly-trained 
medical staff.</p>
<p>Is your infertility service associated with a medical board specializing in infertility?</p>
<p>You may wish to determine whether the infertility service has a doctor who is board-certified by the American Board of 
Obstetrics and Gynecology in the subspecialty of Reproductive Endocrinology.</p>
<p>This board certification provides recognition of tested expertise in IVF and GIFT procedures.</p>
<p>Can you send me written material about the particular procedure you are recommending?</p>
<p>It is helpful to get written information about any medical procedures you may undergo. IVF and GIFT treatments should be 
explained to you in detail so that you fully understand the nature of these procedures.</p>
<p>What are the fees for these procedures? How much will drugs cost?</p>
<p>What is typically covered by insurance?</p>
<p>Costs for infertility procedures are relatively expensive, and coverage by health insurance plans varies. Ask the cost of each step 
in the IVF or GIFT procedure. Most infertility services charge you as you advance through each step of the procedure rather 
than require a payment-in-full prior to the start of a treatment. You should review your health insurance to see which parts, if any, 
of the IVF or GIFT procedures are covered and discuss the matter with the provider of your choice.</p>
<p>Can we talk with several former or current patients who have had problems similar to ours?</p>
<p>Talking with a provider's patients can help confirm your impressions of an infertility program, particularly the way in which 
patients are treated. You frequently can get an idea of a program's strengths and weaknesses from those who have participated 
in it.</p>
<h4>Where to Go for More Information</h4>
<p>For help in researching or checking possible complaints about particular infertility programs, you may want to contact the state 
medical board or county medical society. For more information about infertility, write: American Fertility Society, 2140 Eleventh 
Avenue South, Suite 200, Birmingham, AL 35205. An infertility support group such as RESOLVE--with national headquarters 
in Arlington, Massachusetts and numerous local chapters--may be of immediate help to you.</p>
<p>If you have further questions or want to discuss possible problems about this issue, write: Correspondence Branch, Federal 
Trade Commission, Washington, DC 20580. Although the FTC does not usually intervene in individual cases, the information 
you provide may indicate a pattern of possible law violations requiring action by the Commission.</p>
<p>For a list of all the FTC's consumer publications, contact: Public Reference, Federal Trade Commission, Washington, DC 
20580; (202) 326-2222. Ask for a free copy of 'Best Sellers'.</p>

<h2>MEDICARE and ADVANCE DIRECTIVES</h2>
<p>You can decide in advance what medical treatment you want to receive in the event you become physically or mentally unable to 
communicate your wishes.</p>
<h4>Your rights as a patien</h4>
<p>All adults in hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, and health care settings have certain rights. For example, you have a right to 
confidentiality of your personal and medical records and to know what treatment you will receive.</p>
<p>You also have another right. You have the right to prepare a document called an &quot;advance directive.&quot; In one type of advance 
directive, you state in advance what kind of treatment you want or do not want if you ever become mentally or physically unable 
to choose or communicate your wishes. In a second type, you authorize another person to make those decisions for you if you 
become incapacitated. Federal law requires hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, hospices, home health agencies and health 
maintenance organizations (HMOs) serving persons covered by either Medicare or Medicaid to give you information about 
advance directives and explain your legal choices in making decisions about medical care.</p>
<p>The law is intended to increase your control over medical treatment decisions. Be mindful, however, that state laws governing 
advance directives do differ. The health care provider is required to give to you information about the laws with respect to 
advance directives for the state in which the provider is located. If you reside in another state, you may wish to gather information 
about your state laws from another source such as the office of the state attorney general.</p>
<h4>What is an advance directive?</h4>
<p>Generally, an advance directive is a written document you prepare stating how you want medical decisions made if you lose the 
ability to make decisions for yourself. The two most commonly prepared advance directives are:</p>
<p>* a &quot;Living Will&quot;; and<br>
* a &quot;Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care.&quot;<br>
The value of an advance directive is that it allows you to state your choices for health care or to name someone to make those 
choices for you, if you become unable to make decisions about your medical treatment. In short, an advance directive ensures 
your right to accept or refuse medical care. You can say &quot;yes&quot; to treatment you want, or &quot;no&quot; to treatment you don't want.</p>
<h4>Living Will</h4>
<p>A living will generally states the kind of medical care you want (or do not want) if you become unable to make your own 
decision. It is called a living will because it takes effect while you are still living. Most states have their own living will forms, each 
somewhat different. It may also be possible to complete and sign a pre&#169;printed living will form available in your own community, 
draw up your own form, or simply write a statement of your preferences for treatment. You may also wish to speak to an 
attorney or your physician to be certain you have completed the living will in a way that your wishes will be understood and 
followed.</p>
<h4>Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care</h4>
<p>In many states, a durable power of attorney for health care is a signed, dated, and witnessed paper naming another person, such 
as a husband, wife, daughter, son, or close friend, as your authorized spokesperson to make medical decisions for you if you 
should become unable to make them for yourself. You can also include instructions about any treatment you want to avoid. 
Some states have specific laws allowing a health care power of attorney, and provide printed forms.</p>
<h4>Which is better.. A living will or a durable power of attorney for health care?</h4>
<p>In some states, laws may make it better to have one or the other. It may also be possible to have both, or to combine them in a 
single document that describes treatment choices in a variety of situations (ask your doctor about these) and names someone 
(called your &quot;agent&quot; or &quot;proxy&quot;) to make decisions for you, should you be unable to make decisions for yourself.</p>
<p>The law on honoring an advance directive from one state to another is unclear. However, because an advance directive specifies 
your wishes regarding medical care, it may be honored wherever you are, if you make it known that you have an advance 
directive. But if you spend a great deal of time in a state other than your home state, you may wish to consider having your 
advance directive meet the laws of both states, as much as possible.</p>
<h4>Advance directives are not required and may be cancelled at any time </h4>
<p>You do not have to prepare an advance directive if you do not want one. If you do prepare one, you have the right to change or 
cancel it at any time. Any change or cancellation should be written, signed, and dated in accordance with state law, and copies 
should be given to your doctor, or to others to whom you may have given copies of the original. In addition, some states allow 
you to change an advance directive by oral statement.</p>
<p>If you wish to cancel an advance directive while you are in the hospital, you should notify your doctor, your family, and others 
who may need to know. Even without a change in writing, your wishes stated in person directly to your doctor generally carry 
more weight than a living will or durable power of attorney, as long as you can decide for yourself and can communicate your 
wishes. But be sure to state your wishes clearly and be sure that they are understood.</p>
<p>Make sure that someone, such as your lawyer or a family member, knows that you have an advance directive and knows where 
it is located. You might also consider the following:</p>
<p>* If you have a durable power of attorney, give a copy or the original to your agent or proxy.</p>
<p>* Ask your physician to make your advance directive part of your permanent medical record.</p>
<p>* Keep a copy of your advance directive in a safe place where it can be found easily, if it is needed.</p>
<p>* Keep a small card in your purse or wallet stating that you have an advance directive, where it is located and who your agent or 
proxy is, if you have named one.</p>
<h4>Who should prepare an advance directive?</h4>
<p>You may want to consider preparing an advance directive if:</p>
<p>* you want your physician or other health care provider to know the kind of medical care you want or don't want if you become 
incapacitated.</p>
<p>* you want to relieve your family and friends of the responsibility for making decisions regarding life-prolonging actions.</p>
<h4>Additional information</h4>
<p>If you need help in preparing an advance directive, or if you would like more information, you may want to contact a lawyer, a 
nearby hospital, hospice or long-term care facility, or your state attorney general's office.</p>

<h2 align=center>REYE SYNDROME: The Decline of a Disease</h2>
<p>Each year between March 1951 and March 1962, the Royal Alexandra Hospital for Children in New South Wales, Australia, 
admitted one or two children in such a critical state that most of them could not be saved, despite the most advanced medical 
care.</p>
<p>The cases had a number of unusual features in common. When admitted, all but two of the 21 children were in a coma or stupor, 
although their illness had started out a few days or weeks earlier with only common childhood upper respiratory 
symptoms--usually cough, sore throat, runny nose, or earache. Some children had even appeared to be recovering before the 
more serious phase of the illness began, with fever, relentless vomiting, convulsions, wild delirium, screaming, intense irritability, 
and violent movements.</p>
<p>Seventeen of the children died within an average of 27 hours after admission. At autopsy, all were found to have brain swelling, a 
slightly enlarged, firm and uniformly bright yellow liver, and a change in the appearance of the kidneys. Douglas Reye, M.D., the 
hospital's director of pathology, and his colleagues believed this set of symptoms represented a distinct disease, which they called 
fatty degeneration of the viscera (internal organs) of unknown cause. Though they suspected that ingestion of drugs or poisons 
may have been responsible for the condition, an investigation into the children's homes revealed they had no access to these 
substances. In 1963, George Johnson, M.D., and his co-workers reported an epidemic of 16 fatal cases of an encephalitis-like 
disease occurring within a four-month period during an outbreak of influenza B in a small North Carolina community. Although 
children in this group were older than those studied by Reye, and their preceding illness was flu, it was subsequently theorized 
from Johnson's description of the symptoms and postmortem findings that several of the children who died may have also had the 
syndrome described by Reye. It became known as Reye-Johnson syndrome, though it's usually referred to as Reye (pronounced 
rye) syndrome.</p>
<p>After the Reye-Johnson reports were published, numerous reports came in from the United States and other parts of the world 
showing that the syndrome was both more widespread and more common than was thought. Though this was not a new 
disease--it had been reported as early as 1929--for the first time it had been identified and characterized as a distinct entity.</p>
<p>During the 1960s and 70s, when regional and then national surveillance of Reye syndrome was established by the Atlanta-based 
Centers for Disease Control (now the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), scientists observed that the syndrome 
occurred in association with outbreaks of the flu, especially influenza B. They also noted that it followed chickenpox, with 
children aged 5 to 15 most often affected. Less often it was associated with other viruses and acute respiratory and diarrheal 
illnesses.</p>
<h4>When Is It Reye?</h4>
<p>Many toxic substances (such as carbon tetrachloride, phosphorus and alcohol) and other diseases (such as acute hepatitis and 
viral encephalitis) can produce symptoms like Reye syndrome. Since most physicians were completely unfamiliar with the 
syndrome at the time, they needed to know what constituted a positive diagnosis.</p>
<p>CDC established case definitions for regional surveillance and outbreak investigations in the late 1960s. Criteria for a case 
included mental status changes, such as delirium or coma, and a liver biopsy (tissue sample) showing fat accumulation in the liver 
(or high levels of liver enzymes and ammonia in the blood). There also needed to be no other more reasonable explanation for 
the brain or liver abnormalities.</p>
<p>Records show that Reye syndrome has affected an infant as young as 4 days old and has occurred in a 59-year-old man; 
however, more than 90 percent of reported cases are in children under 15. About 2 percent are in adults over 20.</p>
<h4>How the Illness Progresses</h4>
<p>The course of the illness is variable. Reye syndrome can be mild and self-limiting, or it can progress rapidly, causing death within 
hours of onset, usually from brain swelling. But the progression may also stop at any stage, with complete recovery in 5 to 10 
days and the quick return of normal liver function.</p>
<p>Doctors classify stages of Reye syndrome based on the level of the patient's consciousness and corresponding physical signs: 
Stages 0 to 2 are pre-comatose, with lethargy or delirium, and sometimes combativeness, but with the child still responding to 
stimuli. Coma progressively deepens in stages 3 to 5; the child is unresponsive to stimuli, and heart and lung function begin to shut 
down.</p>
<p>The earlier the diagnosis and treatment, the better the chance for survival. Intense supportive care in a hospital experienced in 
dealing with Reye syndrome also improves odds. Children who survive but experience the most severe stages of the 
illness--especially infants-are sometimes left with neurological abnormalities, often mental retardation or disorders of voice and 
speech.</p>
<p>The earlier the diagnosis and treatment of Reye syndrome, the better the chance for survival.</p>
<p>Fatality rates when national surveillance began on a regular basis in 1976 were as high as 40 percent, declined to between 20 
and 30 percent from 1978 to 1987, but rose in 1988 and have stayed between 40 and 53 percent ever since. CDC experts 
speculate that these higher death rates despite fewer reports each year may reflect decreasing interest in the syndrome--because 
of its rarity--resulting in the reporting of only the most serious cases.</p>
<h4>The Aspirin Connection</h4>
<p>Just as Reye suspected that a drug or poison may have triggered the disease's development, investigators in the United States 
looked for some common factor among children who developed the syndrome. They found it in aspirin taken during flu or 
chickenpox.</p>
<p>In 1980, results of studies conducted in Ohio, Michigan and Arizona demonstrated an association between Reye syndrome and 
aspirin use during a preceding respiratory tract or chickenpox infection.</p>
<p>&quot;It was those initial studies that we reviewed in 1980 that first led CDC to report in its Morbidity and Mortality), Weekly Report 
[MMWR] that there was an association,&quot; states Lawrence B. Schonberger, M.D., an epidemiologist with the agency. In 1981, 
CDC reported in MMWR results of a fourth study that revealed the same association. In 1982, the Surgeon General of the U.S. 
Public Health Service issued a warning against giving aspirin to children with flu or chickenpox.</p>
<p>The public was quick to pick up on the association. &quot;A kind of natural study was occurring, because once people heard about 
the results [of the studies], they started to lower the use of aspirin in their children,&quot; says Schonberger. &quot;If aspirin had nothing to 
do with it [Reye syndrome], then one might anticipate that there would be no clear decrease in the incidence of Reye syndrome.&quot;</p>
<h4>Reye Syndrome Symptoms</h4>
<p>In most cases, children seem to be recovering from a viral illness when the following symptoms occur:</p>
<p>* nausea<br>
* vomiting, usually very severe<br>
* fever<br>
* lethargy<br>
* stupor or coma, sometimes followed by convulsions<br>
* wild delirium and unusual restlessness noted in about half of patients*<br>
That's not what happened. Aspirin use in children under 10 declined by at least 50 percent from 1981 to 1988, and the number 
of Reye syndrome cases went down correspondingly. In the opinion of Peter C. Rowe, M.D., assistant professor of pediatrics, 
Children's Hospital of Eastern Canada, Ottawa, Ontario, the declining use of aspirin and the decreasing incidence of Reye 
syndrome represent a &quot;natural ecological experiment.&quot;</p>
<h4>Other Government Actions</h4>
<p>The federal government made other moves. To confirm the preliminary findings of the state studies, in 1985-1986 the 
government sponsored the &quot;Public Health Service Study of Reye's Syndrome and Medications.&quot; Twenty-seven children who 
developed Reye syndrome after a preceding respiratory illness or chickenpox were matched with 140 children who had had the 
same illnesses at the same time, but did not develop Reye syndrome. More than 96 percent of the Reye syndrome cases, 
compared with 38 percent of the controls (the children who did not develop Reye syndrome), had received aspirin (or other 
salicylates) to treat the preceding illness. The study was prematurely ended because not enough Reye syndrome children who 
had not been exposed to aspirin could be found to justify the expense of continuing the investigation, in itself an indication of a 
public health triumph.</p>
<p>In 1986, FDA adopted a preliminary rule requiring aspirin manufacturers to add warnings to product labels about the possible 
association between aspirin use and the development of Reye syndrome. The permanent rule became final in 1988, and the 
labeling reads: Children and teenagers should not use this medicine for chicken pox or flu symptoms before a doctor is consulted 
about Reye syndrome, a rare but serious illness reported to be associated with aspirin.</p>
<p>The number of Reye syndrome cases, which reached a high in 1980 with 555 cases, has steadily decreased, compared with 
years in which there has been similar types of influenza activity. The decline has been most dramatic among children from 5 to 10 
years of age. According to CDC, since 1985, 40 to 65 percent of reported Reye syndrome patients have been older than 10. 
Because this age group often self-medicates, recent educational efforts have been geared to reach them.</p>
<h4>Other Factors?</h4>
<p>Some questions about the relationship between aspirin and Reye syndrome still remain. Although figures show that 90 to 95 
percent of Reye syndrome patients in the United States have taken aspirin during a preceding viral illness, it is estimated that less 
than 0.1 percent of children having a viral infection and treated with aspirin develop the syndrome. Are other factors involved?</p>
<p>Apparently so. Reye syndrome has always been a puzzling disease. Research on possible causes has been hampered because no 
one can come up with a simple specific diagnostic test for the syndrome. The waters are further muddied by the existence of at 
least 19 viruses, including the chickenpox and flu viruses, which cause infectious illnesses that can precede Reye syndrome 
development. Some experts have proposed that Reye syndrome develops from the interaction of a viral illness, genetic 
susceptibility to the disease, and exposure to chemicals, such as salicylates, pesticides and aflatoxin. Others speculate that 
unidentified viruses or other infectious agents are involved.</p>
<p>That some children may be more susceptible to Reye syndrome than others has been shown by cases appearing among children 
in the same family and by recurrent episodes of the illness in the same child. It is possible that more than one type of Reye 
syndrome exists, or that some of these cases may not be Reye syndrome at all.</p>

<p>(Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)</p>
<h4>Reye-Like Disorders</h4>
<p>In the light of what we know now, it is questionable whether all of Dr. Reye's cases were true Reye syndrome. Recent research 
indicates that some children diagnosed in the past with Reye syndrome, particularly those under 5, may have had underlying 
metabolic abnormalities that produce similar symptoms.</p>
<p>&quot;There may well be certain cases that come in even today--in the very young--that five years from now we'll find are really some 
other abnormal congenital problem--where they have a metabolic defect and it expresses itself in a form that looks much like 
Reye syndrome,&quot; says CDC's Schonberger. Because these children require different treatment, proper diagnosis can be a matter 
of life or death. In children 5 or older, a Reye syndrome diagnosis is more conclusive--especially when symptoms occur during 
flu and chickenpox epidemics--since few other diseases in this age group mimic common Reye syndrome symptoms.</p>
<p>Metabolic disorders may prove some day to be the chief cause of Reye syndrome. Until then, it's important to remember that 
aspirin use during flu or chickenpox is asking for trouble.</p>
<p>In Schonberger's words: &quot;The association between aspirin and Reye syndrome is so strong that it has now become literally 
foolhardy to act as if no etiologic [cause-and-effect] relationship exists.&quot; *</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Sunscreens -- July 1994</h2>
<p>TRUE OR FALSE:</p>
<p>Sunscreens labeled &quot;15&quot; and higher do not protect you against all the sun's rays.</p>
<p>A tan may protect you against some sunburn, but not against all wrinkling or skin cancer.</p>
<p>You can endanger your skin by using too little sunscreen or not applying it one-half hour before going out in the sun.</p>
<p>Infants under six months probably should not be in the sun at all.</p>
<p>Sunlight coming through a window can damage your skin.</p>
<p>Even if you are more careful than ever about going out in the sun nowadays, you may be surprised at the answers to the above 
questions. All of them are true.</p>
<p>While you may be used to warnings about limiting sun exposure and using sunscreens, researchers are becoming ever more 
cautious about how much sun is good for you. The following questions and answers may help you decide how much sun you 
should be exposed to and what precautions you can take to protect yourself and your family.</p>
<h4>Is any sun exposure safe?</h4>
<p>Although sunlight is essential for human life, daily exposure to the sun over a lifetime is a major cause of skin damage, including 
wrinkling and skin cancer. Many of the skin changes attributed to aging are in fact signs of sun-induced skin damage.</p>
<p>Every year, more than 700,000 people in the United States get skin cancer. It is the most common form of cancer, with rates 
growing three to five percent annually. Left untreated, skin cancer can be life-threatening.</p>
<h4>Is tanning safe?</h4>
<p>Any tan indicates skin damage. Although a tan may give you some protection against sunburning, it will not fully protect you 
against wrinkling or skin cancer. Some people are especially vulnerable to the effects of the sun, such as fair-skinned individuals 
who burn easily and tan poorly or not at all. Of those who do tan well, the deeper the color of the tan, the more extensive the 
skin damage.</p>
<h4>What is the best protection against the sun?</h4>
<p>Staying indoors is the best protection against getting sun-damaged skin. The hours between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. are the worst 
times to be outside. To help reduce the risk of skin damage from sunlight, wear tight-weave clothing that covers the body, wear a 
hat, and use maximum protection sunscreens.</p>
<h4>What kind of sunscreen protection do you need?</h4>
<p>Most people benefit from sunscreens with high sun protection factor (SPF) numbers, such as 15 or greater. The SPF number 
gives you some idea how long you can remain in the sun before burning. If, for example, you would normally burn in 10 minutes 
without sunscreen, applying a 15 SPF sunscreen may provide you with about 150 minutes in the sun before burning. Swimming 
and perspiration, however, will reduce the actual SPF value for many sunscreens.</p>
<p>Sunscreens with SPF numbers greater than 15 may benefit those who want to minimize their exposure to the sun, especially 
those who are fair-skinned, live in climates close to the equator or at high altitudes, work or play outdoors, or perspire heavily. 
Because skin irritations may result from various sunscreen ingredients, you may want to first test a product by applying a small 
amount to a limited area of your skin.</p>
<h4>Do high SPF number sunscreens fully protect you?</h4>
<p>Unfortunately, even sunscreens with high SPF numbers offer you less than full protection. Sunlight exposes you to two kinds of 
ultraviolet light, called UVA and UVB. Both can cause skin damage, including wrinkling and skin cancer.</p>
<p>Although virtually all sunscreens provide some level of protection against UVB rays, no product yet screens out all UVA rays. 
SPF sunscreen numbers only indicate the amount of time you can stay in the sun without burning. Even if you don't burn, the sun's 
rays still may be damaging your skin.</p>
<p>No rating system yet exists for UVA. There is no way, then, to tell how much UVA protection you are getting. Some researchers 
estimate that the level of protection in many products advertising UVA protection, even those with high SPF numbers, is 
probably equivalent to an SPF 3 or 4. So, even if you use high SPF number sunscreens, you still are vulnerable to skin damage 
from the sun's UVA rays.</p>
<h4>How much sunscreen should you use?</h4>
<p>You will not get the full protection offered by the sunscreen unless you apply the recommended liberal amount on your skin. 
Unfortunately, many people use much less. A sunscreen with an SPF of 15 may give only half that protection if you don't use 
enough of it.</p>
<p>If you are at the beach, for example, use about an ounce of sunscreen over your whole body for one application. That means you 
should plan to buy about one 8-ounce container or more of sunscreen per person for each week you are at the beach.</p>
<p>If you frequently go swimming or perspire, use a waterproof product for the best protection. Apply the sunscreen before going 
outdoors and be sure to reapply it as needed -- after perspiring, swimming or toweling off. Otherwise, you are not getting the 
protection you need from the sun's rays.</p>
<h4>When should you use sunscreen?</h4>
<p>Skin damage does not occur only on the beach or the ski slopes. Most people who are going to be out in the sun for more than 
10 minutes would benefit from daily use of sunscreen on the parts of the body exposed to the sun. Even casual exposure to 
sunlight -- while driving a car, walking to the store, taking an outdoor lunch break -- contributes to the cumulative lifetime 
exposure that may lead to skin damage.</p>
<p>Make sure you apply the sunscreen about one-half hour before going out in the sun to give your skin a chance to fully absorb it.</p>
<p>If you're taking medications, ask your doctor or pharmacist if these medications will sensitize your skin to the sun and aggravate 
sunburn or rashes. Common drugs that may do this include: certain antibiotics; birth control pills; diuretics; antihistamines; and 
antidepressants.</p>
<h4>Are all sunscreens basically the same?</h4>
<p>Sunscreens contain a variety of ingredients. Although some sunscreens may provide more moisturizers, for example, those with 
identical SPF numbers give you equivalent sunburn protection from UVB rays. Because of the cost of buying sunscreen products 
year-round, you may want to shop for competitively-priced brands of sunscreen offering the level of protection you need.</p>
<h4>How effective are sunblocks?</h4>
<p>Do not be misled by sunscreen products that claim they are sunblocks. Only opaque substances, such as zinc oxide or titanium 
dioxide, totally block the sunlight. These products are most practical to use on specific areas of the body most exposed to the 
sun, such as the nose or lips.</p>
<p>Are there special precautions you should take with children? Parents should see that sunscreens of SPF 15 or greater are applied 
routinely when children go outdoors. Because sunscreens may irritate baby skin, and babies' developing eyes are particularly 
vulnerable to sunlight, experts recommend that infants less than six months old should be kept out of the sun altogether.</p>
<p>Experts estimate that about 50 percent of an individual's sun exposure occurs by age 18. Some have suggested that schools, 
child care centers, and camps rearrange outdoor play times to minimize exposure to the midday sun.</p>
<h4>Are indoor tanning devices safe?</h4>
<p>Tanning devices, like natural sunlight, emit ultraviolet rays. These UVA or UVB rays, whether from artificial or natural sources, 
can cause skin damage.</p>
<h4>Where can you go for more information?</h4>
<p>Your doctor or dermatologist may have additional material on tanning and sunscreens. For a free brochure on Indoor 
Tanning,contact: Public Reference, Federal Trade Commission, Washington, DC 20580; 202-326-2222. TDD (202)

<h3 align=left>BY DODI SCHULTZ</h3>
<h2 align=left>THAT SPRING FEVER MAY BE CHICKENPOX</h2>
<p>A number of the classic childhood diseases so called because they inevitably struck each new generation of youngsters are now 
unfamiliar to most Americans. Today, polio, rubella, diphtheria, pertussis (whooping cough), and measles are preventable by 
timely vaccination.</p>
<p>But there's one major exception: chickenpox or, as it's known medically, varicella (a diminutive of variola, the technical term for 
smallpox). Some 3.5 million Americans, mostly children, come down with this viral illness each year.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the disease, while highly contagious, is generally mild and, normally, not life-threatening. Some individuals, however, 
are at higher risk of serious illness; according to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), there are more than 4,500 
hospitalizations for chickenpox annually, with 50 to 100 deaths. Recently, the Food and Drug Administration has approved the 
use of some products to lessen the impact of the illness.</p>
<h4>The Usual Course</h4>
<p>Varicella occurs chiefly, though not exclusively, in early spring (March through May) and often spreads rapidly through families, 
neighborhoods, and such sites as day-care centers. Three- to 6-year-olds who have started school or preschool and have begun 
to socialize with other children are most vulnerable, although anyone of any age who has never had the disease is susceptible.</p>
<p>After a 10- to 20-day incubation period (the time between exposure to the virus and the onset of illness), an infected. youngster 
begins to feel draggy and usually runs a low fever; uncommonly, the fever may be high or, occasionally, there's none at all. Within 
a day or two, a characteristic rash appears, often first on the back, chest or scalp and gradually spreading to the rest of the body 
over three or four days, during which the fever abates. The tiny pimple-like eruptions eventually turn into small blisters and form 
crusts, which fall away. And that's that; about a week elapses from start to finish.</p>
<p>In this normal course, the disease is not a serious health threat. The rash, however, can be intensely itchy and, since scratching 
can lead to secondary infection by bacteria on the skin, such as staphylococcus (staph), doctors advise parents to cut youngsters' 
nails very short and do everything possible to relieve the itch. Calamine lotion may be helpful; so may immersing the child in a 
cornstarch or baking-soda bath. As the crusty scabs form, the itching subsides. At that point, it's wise to keep the child 
occupied, since idle hands may turn to picking at the scabs, causing scarring.</p>
<p>No other treatment is necessary. If, however, the child complains of headache, fever, or general malaise, a non-aspirin pain 
reliever and fever reducer such as acetaminophen (Datril, Liquiprin, Tempra, Tylenol, and others) can alleviate discomfort. (See 
accompanying article.)</p>
<p>Chickenpox can be transmitted to others through fluid from broken blisters, as well as by droplet infection coughing or sneezing. 
A child is contagious from the day before the rash appears until the lesions have all crusted over. The AAP advises that a child 
who has had chickenpox can go back to school six days after the onset of the rash or even sooner, if all the lesions are crusted 
over.</p>
<p>Although it occurs far less often, a child can also catch chickenpox from an adult with a different condition by contact with the 
lesions on the skin of a person with shingles. Shingles, which involves a painful, rather than itchy, localized eruption following 
nerve pathways, may develop in a person who has had chickenpox when the virus, which has remained latent in the body, is 
reactivated; usually, this happens in older people whose immune systems operate less efficiently. (See Shingles Or Chickenpox, 
Part Two, in the July-August 1991 issue of FDA Consumer.) The virus that causes both chickenpox and shingles is known 
medically as the varicella-zoster virus (VZV).</p>
<h4>Help for High-Risk Kids</h4>
<p>Although chickenpox represents nothing more than temporary discomfort for most children, it can pose more serious problems 
for children who are immunocompromised a medical term describing those whose immune systems are not working normally. In 
such children, varicella can even be life-threatening, since under these circumstances, it can progress to pancreatitis, hepatitis, 
encephalitis (inflammations of the pancreas, liver and brain, respectively), or pneumonia.</p>
<p>Some children are born with immune-system deficiencies. Sometimes such deficiencies result from serious illness such as infection 
with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which causes AIDS. Among the prominent causes of immune-system suppression 
in children are cancers and the side effects of cancer treatments, observes Paul Albrecht, M.D., director of the division of 
virology in FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research: Children under treatment for malignancies, especially leukemias, 
could suffer severe disease with VZV infection. If these compromised children are exposed, they should receive VZIG, 
varicella-zoster immune globulin.</p>
<p>Still another group of youngsters who may be at increased risk are those taking long-term or high-dose corticosteroids for such 
chronic conditions as asthma or arthritis. (This refers to steroids that are either inhaled, taken orally, or injected, not to topical 
medications applied to the skin.) These drugs include prednisone, prednisolone, methylprednisolone, dexamethasone, 
triamcinolone, and others. They suppress the immune system to a certain extent, so that children taking them may be at higher 
risk of complications if they come down with chickenpox.</p>
<p>FDA warned of this risk in December 1991 but stressed that stopping the drugs without medical consultation could be very 
dangerous. Corticosteroids may themselves be lifesaving. And since they disrupt the body's normal hormone production system, 
even when stopping therapy is considered advisable, they are not withdrawn abruptly but tapered off under medical supervision.</p>
<p>That message is underscored by Herbert Behrens, a scientist with the pilot drug evaluation staff of FDA's Center for Drug 
Evaluation and Research.</p>
<p>There is no question, says Behrens, that the benefits of corticosteroids far outweigh the potential risk of a severe case of 
chickenpox. We would hope no parent would take a child off corticosteroids because of this. If a child taking corticosteroids is 
exposed to chickenpox, the parent should immediately call the doctor to seek advice on what protective steps, if any, need to be 
taken.</p>
<p>He added that the form of the drug, as well as the dosage, duration of therapy, and route of administration may affect the risk, 
but how these differences may affect the risk has not been clearly established. Also not known is how the underlying condition 
and treatment history might contribute to the risk. At this writing, revised labeling for the various corticosteroids is being 
developed.</p>
<p>As with youngsters undergoing cancer treatment, the physician may decide in some instances that the child taking corticosteroids 
should receive varicella-zoster immune globulin, or VZIG.</p>
<p>FDA licensed VZIG (doctors pronounce it vee-zig) in 1981, after it was developed in the 1970s by the Center for Disease 
Control (now the national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). It is one of a number of specific immune globulins 
produced for passive immunization. Vaccines active immunization work by introducing a bit of virus or other infectious agent, 
thereby stimulating the body to produce antibodies against that particular agent. Immune globulins, derived from human plasma, 
already contain such antibodies, produced by other people in response to vaccination or the disease itself. VZIG, like most 
immune globulins, is given by intramuscular injection.</p>
<p>Why not give all children VZIG? Unlike vaccines, which are designed to confer duration of immunity equal to having the disease 
itself, VZIG gives only temporary protection.</p>
<p>Normally, as Albrecht points out, the disease is minor, and having it provides good lifelong immunity against chickenpox. After 
receiving VZIG which provides protection that lasts only about three months the individual remains susceptible to [chickenpox] 
infection. And the later [in life] chickenpox occurs, the worse it is.</p>
<h4>A Medicine for Some</h4>
<p>While an array of effective antibiotics are available to treat bacterial and fungal infections, effective therapy for viral infections, 
including varicella, has been elusive. One drug, however, has been found effective against VZV, and in February 1992, FDA 
approved the use of oral Zovirax (acyclovir) available in capsules, tablets, and banana-flavored liquid for the treatment of 
chickenpox in otherwise healthy children. (The drug has been previously approved for genital herpes and shingles.)</p>
<p>But oral Zovirax would not be the treatment of choice, for example, if a child at very high risk of complications fell ill with 
chickenpox, says Dianne Murphy, M.D., assistant director for medical affairs with the Center for Drug Evaluation and 
Research's division of antiviral drug products: If a child is immunocompromised, intravenous acyclovir would be the treatment of 
choice, since pneumonia could develop fairly rapidly. Administering the drug by intravenous injection speeds its action, and 
another consideration is that the oral form's bioavailability the degree to which it is actually useable by the body is lower.</p>
<p>Just what good does oral Zovirax do? And who should receive it? In clinical trials with patients from 2 years old through the 
teens, the drug has been shown to shorten recovery time by a day or so, as well as to reduce the number of lesions. Side effects 
have been uncommon; in one series of three trials involving almost 1,000 patients, the main adverse effect was diarrhea, reported 
by 3.2 percent of the 495 receiving the drug and also by 2.2 percent of those who received a placebo.</p>
<p>Should all otherwise healthy kids with chickenpox receive oral Zovirax? Probably not, says Janet Arrowsmith-Lowe, M.D., 
reviewing medical officer in the division of antiviral drug products: FDA has approved this use because it's been found to be safe 
and has met efficacy criteria. You have to realize that effectiveness depends on starting the medication early, preferably within 24 
hours. That means the patient must get to the doctor fast, the doctor has to recognize the illness and write the prescription, and 
the parent must quickly obtain the medicine and start to administer it. Of course, to a parent who must stay home from work with 
the child, cutting a full day off the length of the illness may be worth it.</p>
<p>Murphy also notes the well-known all-in-the-family effect, as well as the impact of age: While most normal children won't need 
acyclovir for chickenpox, it's available in those cases where the physician feels it's desirable. The child who has caught 
chickenpox from another family member, someone in the same household, is frequently sicker not in a life-threatening sense, but 
certainly in terms of discomfort and the drug can help. An even more important group are adolescents; adolescents who come 
down with chickenpox might be considered candidates for acyclovir, since they do get sicker with chickenpox, and are also at 
higher risk of complications such as pneumonia, than younger children.</p>
<p>Aside from those special instances, says Murphy, This is a medical-care issue, a decision to be made by the physician. Most 
children get over chickenpox without any complications. Acyclovir appears to be a fairly safe drug. We must remember, though, 
that all drugs have side effects. The basic rule, as with all drugs, is: Don't take it if you don't need it.</p>
<p>The AAP, which issued a policy statement on the question several months after FDA's approval of the drug, concurs, stating that 
oral acyclovir is not recommended routinely for treating uncomplicated varicella-zoster infections in otherwise healthy children.</p>
<p>The AAP recommends that oral acyclovir be considered for: teenagers, since they are at higher risk of more severe illness and 
complications of the disease</p>
<p>children over 1 year who have a chronic skin or lung disorder children receiving chronic aspirin treatment, as well as those 
receiving short, intermittent or aerosolized steroid therapy.</p>
<h4>What About a Vaccine?</h4>
<p>Couldn't we avoid these questions, as well as the potential complications of chickenpox (not to mention the down-the-road 
agony of shingles), with a simple shot in the arm? Is there any hope of a vaccine?</p>
<p>The promise of a vaccine has been with us for at least 15 years, since the development in the mid-1970s of a Japanese vaccine.</p>
<p>There have been multiple studies and a number of clinical trials in Japan, in the United States, and in other countries, but none 
have met FDA criteria for vaccine licensing.</p>
<p>Albrecht, whose division reviews the data when applications for vaccine approval are submitted, reports that the latest 
submission applying for licensure of a varicella-zoster vaccine was received by FDA from a U.S. manufacturer in November 
1992. It was under review when this issue of FDA Consumer went to press.</p>
<p>Until a vaccine is licensed, parents of children at high risk should seek a medical opinion about the appropriateness of VZIG and 
Zovirax for their children. And parents of healthy children who get chickenpox can continue to care for them by taking simple 
steps to prevent skin infection, and by remembering not to give them aspirin.</p>
<p>Dodi Schultz is a New York-based freelance writer and a contributing editor of Parents magazine. FDA requires all aspirin 
-containing products to bear labeling warning that they should not be given to children or teenagers with chickenpox or flu 
symptoms before a doctor is consulted. This is because Reye syndrome, a rare but serious illness, has been found to develop 
more frequently in children and teenagers who have taken aspirin or products that contain aspirin while they are ill with 
chickenpox or flu.</p>
<p>Since the mid-1980s, when FDA began requiring the label warning, the incidence of the syndrome has fallen dramatically. (See 
Reye Syndrome: The Decline of a Disease in the November 1990 FDA Consumer.)</p>

<h2>The Spine Curves</h2>
<p>The young girl's spine was not growing straight. In her shoulder area it curved to the right. In her lower back it curved to the left. 
Instead of forming a straight line from neck to hips, the spine was taking on the contours of a top-heavy letter S.</p>
<p>The doctor's diagnosis was scoliosis--an abnormal curvature of the spine that usually shows up during adolescence. In most 
people the curvature is so mild that no treatment is needed. In her case, however, the spine would continue to grow in a curve 
unless it could be coaxed along a straighter path.</p>
<p>At 13, the girl was fitted with a body brace that she would wear almost constantly for the next four years. She kept it on 22 
hours of every day, tapering off only in the last year. By the time she reached 17 her spine had stopped growing, the 
susceptibility to curvature had passed, and the brace could be abandoned. It had been a difficult time, but the alternatives would 
have been worse--surgery or, if untreated, a possible deformity and a lifetime of pain and other health problems.</p>
<p>Scoliosis is more common than people may realize. It generally appears between the ages of 10 and 15, when a child's spine is 
growing rapidly, and it affects 5 to 10 percent of all adolescents to some degree. Very mild scoliosis occurs at the same rate in 
both sexes, but adolescent girls are seven to nine times more likely to develop clinically detectable spinal curvature that requires 
treatment. The reason for this is not known.</p>
<p>Everyone's spine has normal curves that produce a slight rounding of the shoulder area and an inward curve of the lower back, 
but in scoliosis the spine also curves laterally (sideways). It may resemble a letter &quot;S&quot; or a long letter &quot;C,&quot; depending on the 
number and types of curves involved. The curvature described above is the most common type.</p>
<p>Another problem in scoliosis is that as the spine grows, it gradually rotates (twists) on its own axis. The rotation slowly pulls the 
rib cage around so that, in the back, one side of the rib cage becomes higher and sticks out farther than the other. Furthermore, 
the ribs on the inward (concave) side of the spinal curve are gathered together, while those on the outward (convex) side are 
spread apart. This distortion of the rib cage can restrict the lungs, causing breathing problems and possibly heart disease in later 
years.</p>
<p>Progressive scoliosis may produce a cosmetic deformity and incapacitating back pain during adult life. Research has shown that, 
on the average, adults with advanced (untreated) scoliosis tend to retire earlier and die younger than the general population.</p>
<p>Most adolescent scoliosis is &quot;idiopathic,&quot; which means the causes are unknown. It is also a mystery why some curves increase 
rapidly while most remain stable. A tendency toward scoliosis can be inherited, and the disorder frequently runs in families. If one 
child is diagnosed, all other growing children in the family should be examined. A few special cases of scoliosis can be traced to 
neurological disorders such as polio, spinal cord injuries, cerebral palsy and muscular dystrophy.</p>
<p>It is important that scoliosis be identified as early as possible, since prompt treatment of progressing curves provides the best 
chance of slowing or halting a progressive curvature. The most common treatment is a body brace worn until the child reaches 
physical maturity and bone growth has stopped, at about age 16 or 17. As an alternative, some physicians are using a new 
technique that employs an electrical muscle stimulator. If the curvature continues to increase despite these efforts, corrective 
surgery is called for.</p>
<p>Many states have established school screening programs to monitor students around the ages of 10 to 15 for scoliosis. In 
addition, parents may notice signs, particularly when the child is wearing underwear or a bathing suit.</p>
<p>An adolescent with a spinal curvature may appear to lean or list to one side, and even when standing as straight as possible, his 
or her spine is still not &quot;straight.&quot; A shoulder blade may be prominent on one side, with one shoulder higher than the other. One 
hip can also appear higher or be more prominent. From the back, the rib cage may appear to stick out or form a hump on one 
side of the spine (usually the right side). When the arms are hanging loosely at the sides, there may be more space between the 
arm and body on one side. Other clues are repeated tilting of the head to one side, uneven hems and waistbands, uneven bra 
straps, or one pant leg hem riding higher than the other.</p>
<p>An easy test for scoliosis--done in school screening programs--is to have the adolescent bend forward from the waist. This 
makes both the sideways curve of the spine, plus any rib protrusions, more visible. It helps differentiate scoliosis from poor 
posture, which can be corrected merely by straightening up. (The bending test can also reveal a condition called kyphosis, a 
rounded back caused by excessive curving of the upper spine. Kyphosis is found in about 10 percent of the population. Some 
people with kyphosis also have mild scoliosis.)</p>
<p>Parents who suspect something may be wrong with their child's spinal development should talk to a doctor. If scoliosis is indeed 
the problem, the child should be referred to an orthopedic surgeon who specializes in the disorder.</p>
<p>If scoliosis is suspected in a growing patient, X-rays are usually taken to determine the type and extent of curvature. In mild 
scoliosis--a curve that measures 20 degrees or less and does not progress--regular observation by a physician may be all that is 
required. Most adolescents with scoliosis fit into this category.</p>
<p>However, adolescents with spinal curvatures of approximately 20 to 40 degrees are usually candidates for a body brace. Studies 
have shown that the greater the curve, the more likely and the more rapidly it will progress. The main function of a brace in 
scoliosis therapy is to guide the spine while it is still growing. Most braces must be worn day and night for several years until 
maturity (depending on the age of the patient), with one or two hours off daily for exercise and bathing. Patients are encouraged 
to participate in virtually all physical activities except competitive contact sports.</p>
<p>A brace is preventive medicine. It will usually keep an existing curve from worsening and may help reduce it to some extent, thus 
avoiding the need for surgery. Some braces are more cumbersome than others, but the choice is based on the type of curvature 
being treated. For instance, the first successful brace for scoliosis was the &quot;Milwaukee&quot; brace, introduced in 1945 and still used 
today. It has a leather or plastic pelvic girdle, straps, and a ring that circles the patient's neck to hold the support bars of the 
brace in position. However, some newer types of braces made from molded plastic are less obtrusive because they hug the torso 
beneath the underarm and can be concealed by normal clothing. These appear to be effective with moderate spinal curvatures 
involving the lower thoracic and lumbar portions of the spine.</p>
<p>Instead of wearing a brace virtually 24 hours a day, some patients with moderate scoliosis are spending their nights wired to an 
electrical muscle stimulator. This form of therapy for scoliosis became available in 1983 following approval by the Food and 
Drug Administration. The electrical muscle stimulator causes muscles near the spine to contract several times a minute. These 
muscles, located on the outer or convex side of the spinal curve, provide a counteracting force against other muscles that are 
pulling the spine out of line.</p>
<p>An electrical muscle stimulator is used only at night while the patient sleeps. Like the more widely used brace, it must be 
continued until the patient reaches bone maturity. FDA is requiring manufacturers of electrical muscle stimulators to conduct 
follow-up studies of some patients to assess long-term safety and effectiveness.</p>
<p>When a spinal curvature measures 40 to 45 degrees or more, surgery is usually required to prevent future health problems and to 
correct any spinal deformity. Some curvatures may not be detected until they become this severe; in other cases, a moderate 
curve continues to progress despite bracing or other treatment. In addition to adolescent patients, a growing number of adults 
who have severe curvatures are undergoing surgery to help relieve back pain and improve their appearance.</p>
<p>The most common surgical procedure involves attachment of a thin stainless steel rod to straighten the spine, along with fusion to 
hold the spine in a corrected position. The rod--called a Harrington rod after its inventor--is attached to the exposed spine with 
hooks. One or more rods may be used. Then fusion is effected by grafting small strips of bone, usually taken from the back of 
the pelvis, over the affected vertebrae (sections of the spinal column). As this heals, the fused section of spine becomes solid in a 
straightened position while the rest of the spine stays flexible.</p>
<p>Other types of instruments may be used instead of Harrington rods, depending on the patient's needs. Since problems rarely 
result from permanent implantation of these instruments in the back, they are removed at a later date only if necessary.</p>
<p>Generally, the patient must wear a body cast around the ribs and pelvis for about six months after surgery, succeeded by a brace 
worn for another three months. Once the spine is completely healed, a brace is no longer needed. The patient is left with few 
limitations on his or her physical activity.</p>
<p>Scoliosis surgery, and the subsequent recovery period, can be traumatic. It carries certain risks, as does any major surgical 
procedure. Early detection and preventive treatment are obviously preferable. Unfortunately, scoliosis is painless in its beginning 
stages and parents may not be aware their child has a spinal problem until it has progressed to a significant curvature.</p>
<p>School screening programs often pick up scoliosis cases that parents miss, and they can catch them early enough for nonsurgical 
treatment to be successful. The screening programs in the United States and Sweden have been so successful that there has been 
a significant reduction in the number of children who required surgery recently for &quot;idiopathic&quot; scoliosis, according to the Scoliosis 
Research Society, an association of physicians and scientists. &quot;Their curves have been detected early and have been managed 
successfully by appropriate bracing.&quot;</p>
<p>An FDA study ascertained that some or all school districts in 18 states and the District of Columbia have mandatory school 
screening programs that generally cover grades 5 through 9. In addition, more than 20 of the remaining states have voluntary 
scoliosis screening programs at the state, county or local level.</p>
<p>&quot;Screening programs have dramatically reduced both the number and complexity of surgical procedures that are performed for 
scoliosis,&quot; notes the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons. &quot;The real benefit of school screening programs for scoliosis, of 
course, can be expressed in more human terms: the increase in psychological and physical well-being for the children who do not 
progress to spinal deformity.&quot;</p>
<p>Louise Fenner is a member of FDA's publications staff.</p>
<h4>Scoliosis X-Rays</h4>
<p>The growing emphasis on school screening for scoliosis has probably led to an increase in the number of X-ray examinations of 
the spine. After an initial physical examination, suspected cases are generally referred to a health practitioner to confirm the 
diagnosis and to evaluate the condition. Many children with mild curvatures who do not require treatment are periodically 
monitored using X-rays to ensure that curvatures are not increasing. Scoliosis patients are usually examined at least once a year 
and some as often as every three or six months. One or more X-rays may be needed each time.</p>
<p>Health professionals are becoming increasingly aware of the need to minimize radiation exposure during these X-ray 
examinations, especially for girls. Past studies indicate that developing breast tissue is particularly sensitive to the effects of 
radiation and that repeated exposure of the breast during adolescence can increase a woman's risk of breast cancer in later life.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are ways to significantly reduce radiation exposure of the breast without compromising the quality of the X-ray 
picture. These include the use of compensating filters, fast screen/film combinations, and breast shields. Each of these techniques 
by itself can lower radiation exposure markedly. When they are used together, the exposure reduction is even greater.</p>
<h4>Compensating Filter</h4>
<p>This filter is made of aluminum, stainless steel, or transparent lead acrylic. It fits onto the X-ray tube by means of magnets, special 
holders, or slots. The filter absorbs much of the X-ray beam directed to the chest area, improves the X-ray image and, most 
importantly, reduces breast tissue exposure by two to five times.</p>
<h4>Fast Screen/Film Combinations </h4>
<p>The &quot;faster&quot; or more sensitive the film and intensifying screen used, the lower the radiation exposure of the patient. A particular 
type of fast screen/film combination, called &quot;rare-earth,&quot; is frequently used in scoliosis X-rays because it requires less radiation 
exposure without significantly affecting image quality. This technique reduces breast tissue exposure from two to six times.</p>
<h4>Breast Shielding</h4>
<p>There are two types of shields that can be used to protect the breast during an X-ray examination. Contact shields are vests or 
stole-like garments with lead inserts that are worn by the patient to cover the breast area. Shadow shields are adjustable metal 
plates attached to the X-ray machine and cast a &quot;shadow&quot; over the breast area. Breast shielding reduces radiation exposure to 
the breast tissue by three to 10 times. Another method of breast shielding is to turn the patient around so that she faces away 
from the X-ray machine. The body then acts as a shield for the breast tissue.</p>
<p>If your child needs an X-ray examination for scoliosis, remember the importance of radiation exposure reduction. Although there 
is less cause for concern about breast cancer when the patient is a boy (and thus no need for a special breast shield), it makes 
good sense to keep radiation exposure to a minimum for all patients.</p>
<h4>So Ask Your Doctor</h4>
<p>* &quot;What radiation-reduction techniques will be used when my child is X-rayed? Will you use a compensating filter? A fast 
screen/film combination?&quot;</p>
<p>* And, for girls, &quot;Will you use breast shielding?&quot;</p>
<p>If you or your doctor would like more detailed information on reducing radiation exposure, you may request a copy of the 
technical pamphlet Reducing Patient Exposure During Scoliosis Radiography by writing to: FDA, HFZ-240, Rockville, Md. 
20857.</p>
<h4>&quot;Growing The Wrong Way&quot;</h4>
<p>Dr. Moravia smiled. &quot;Now Deenie . . . I'd like you to bend over and touch your hands to your toes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My gym teacher made me do the same thing.&quot;</p>
<p>Dr. Moravia pressed his hand against my side.</p>
<p>&quot;I really do try to stand up straight,&quot; I said.</p>
<p>&quot;It has nothing to do with that,&quot; he told me. &quot;You can come up now, Deenie. &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's not my posture?&quot; I asked, straightening my clothes.</p>
<p>&quot;No. It's your spine, I think. . . . Something might be growing the wrong way.</p>
<p>&quot;I heard all about your spine.</p>
<p>&quot;Who told you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A lot of kids.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I guess practically everyone knows.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, I guess so. Now I know what you meant when you said you had a lot on your mind. Does [the brace] hurt?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, it's just a little uncomfortable.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You can take that thing off sometimes, can't you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm supposed to wear it all the time,&quot; I told him. &quot;Except for swimming.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You even have to sleep in it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; I kind of smiled then, to show how brave I am.</p>

<h2>Lead Threats Lessen,But Mugs Pose Problem</h2>
<p>Throughout history, lead in food and drink has been synonymous with disaster. Historians suspect that some ancient empires 
rambled when leaders became deranged or died of poisoning because they used lead to sweeten wine, drank from lead&#169;lined 
aqueducts, and used utensils made with lead&#169;based clays and paints.</p>
<p>These days, knowledge of the dangers of lead poisoning keeps manufacturers and governments vigilant about the amounts that 
get into food. Small amounts of lead leach from glazes and decorative paints on ceramic dinnerware, from lead crystal. and. less 
frequently, from pewter and silver-plated hollowware. Also, because lead is generally in the environment, it makes its way into 
food through soil and water.</p>
<p>The levels of lead in food and drink today are the lowest in history--90 percent lower than 12 years ago. This is mostly due to 
the U.S. food industry's voluntary elimination of lead solder to seal the seams of food cans and the removal of lead from 
automobile gasoline that settled on crops and in water</p>
<p>. But concern still remains about lead leaching into food from ceramic ware, especially mugs. While analyzing risks from dietary 
lead, FDA scientists found that about 80 percent of adult exposure to lead from food in contact with ceramic hollowware comes 
from frequent or daily use of mugs for hot beverages.</p>
<p>For pregnant women, plain glass or plastic mugs may be a safer bet than ceramic mugs when drinking hot acidic beverages on a 
daily basis.</p>
<h4>Risk to Fetus</h4>
<p>In a February 1992 report to the Society of Toxicology, FDA scientists Clark D. Carrington, Ph.D., P. Michael Bolger, Ph.D., 
and Robert J. Scheuplein, Ph.D., said there can be a substantial incremental risk to a developing ferns from lead leaching into 
food from ceramic hollow-ware. (See accompanying article, &quot;Danger-Even at Low Levels.&quot;)</p>
<p>Antiques and other collectibles may look attractive, but this type of dinner ware is more likely to leach lead than that made more 
recently.</p>
<p>Consumers can guard against exposure to lead in food by observing the following guidelines:</p>
<p>* If you are pregnant, avoid the daily use of ceramic mugs when drinking hot beverages such as coffee or tea, and avoid the daily 
use of lead crystal ware.</p>
<p>* Do not feed babies from lead crystal bottles.</p>
<p>* Do not store acidic foods such as fruit juices in ceramic containers.</p>
<p>* Do not store beverages in lead crystal containers.</p>
<p>* Limit the use of antique or collectible housewares for food or beverages to special occasions.</p>
<p>* Stop using items that show a dusty or chalky gray residue on the glaze after they are washed</p>
<p>* Follow I label directions on any ornamental product with a warning such as, &quot;Not for Food Use -- Plate May Poison Food. 
For Decorative Purposes Only.&quot;</p>
<p>* If your wine is sealed with a foil capsule, wipe the rim of the bottle with a cloth dampened with water or lemon juice before 
removing the cork.</p>
<p>FDA is aware of three kits to test for lead leaching from ceramic ware that consumers can use at home. These kits are not 
always sensitive enough to detect lead at the new lower levels, but they can be valuable for identifying items that release larger 
amounts of lead. For information about these kits and other questions about lead, contact the local FDA office, listed in the blue 
pages of the phone directory, or call FDA headquarters at (301) 443-4667.</p>
<p>The National Safety Council, under a grant from the federal government, maintains a National Lead Information Center with a 
toll-free number -- (1-800) LEAD-FYI, or (1-800) 532-339 -- where callers may request a Spanish or English language 
information package. Also, most U.S. ceramic manufacturers maintain toll-free lines through which consumers may obtain 
information about lead levels in their products. Public affairs specialists in FDA district offices can provide consumers with these 
numbers.</p>
<p>Once lead enters the body, it is assimilated in the bloodstream in the same manner as calcium.</p>
<p>Hot acidic beverages such as coffee and tea, both caffeinated and decaffeinated, cause the greatest leaching. FDA toxicologists 
agree that pregnant women should avoid daily drinking of hot coffee or tea or other hot acidic beverages, such as tomato soup, 
from lead-glazed ceramic cups or mugs. However, the occasional use of these pieces is not a problem, even during pregnancy.</p>
<p>Consumers also need to be aware of the potential for lead to leach from ceramic plates, bowls and pitchers. Glaze, improperly 
formulated or fired, can leach large quantifies of lead into food. Consumers who suspect a ceramic product has been improperly 
glazed or fired, should avoid using it for food, or should test the piece for excessive lead leaching before using it (see 
accompanying article, &quot;Advice for Consumers&quot;).</p>
<p>Responsible manufacturers of ceramic ware use all the proper precautions, but even with properly glazed pieces, low amounts of 
lead may migrate into food. FDA advises consumers to avoid storing acidic beverages, such as fruit juices and iced tea, in 
lead-glazed pitchers because, even cold, acidic beverages have a greater tendency than other foods to cause leaching of lead.</p>
<h4>New Action Levels</h4>
<p>Recent studies on the effects of lead on the fetus, infants, toddlers, and adults in amounts well below those previously believed 
harmful prompted FDA to reduce its action levels (guidelines telling industry at what point FDA may take regulatory action) for 
lead leaching from all ceramic hollowware. The action levels specify how much lead may leach from the ceramic piece into a 
special test solution during a 24-hour test at room temperature. This was the third reduction since action levels for lead leaching 
from ceramic ware were first set in 197 1.</p>
<p>The new action levels are based primarily on how frequently a type of ceramic ware is used, the type of food it holds, the 
temperature of the food, and how long the food comes in contact with the ceramic ware. For example, a coffee mug is generally 
used every day to hold a hot acidic beverage, often several times a day, and a pitcher could be used to store fruit juice. Cups 
and mugs were put into a separate category, and they, along with pitchers, were given an action level of 0.5 parts per million, the 
lowest for all ceramic ware.</p>
<p>Manufacturers of materials used by ceramic hobbyists and handicrafters are aware of lead contamination problems, and label 
their products with special instructions. Public affairs specialists in FDA district offices work with state health officials and 
organizations to develop special education materials for handicraft and pottery associations to avoid potential sources of lead 
exposure that fall beyond FDA regulatory control.</p>
<p>In addition, FDA has notified embassies in Washington, D.C., of the new action levels so that foreign manufacturers and 
exporters will have the necessary information to meet the new levels. FDA samples and tests for lead leaching from imported and 
domestic ceramic ware sold in this country, but the agency cannot check it all. For example, products that enter the country 
through informal channels, such as those brought by travelers from abroad, are not monitored by FDA.</p>
<p>Because of its heightened focus on ceramic ware, in February 1992, FDA inspectors in every port in the country conducted a 
short-term intense surveillance of ceramic products used for food, ranging from fine bone china to inexpensive imported pottery. 
Assisted in many cases by state authorities, FDA inspectors examined more than 5,000 lots of ceramic ware from 29 countries. 
Nearly 700 lots of domestic ceramic ware from approximately 90 firms were also examined. The results were encouraging. 
Using the best screening methods available, FDA examiners found that only about 1 percent of imported and 3 percent of 
domestic ceramic ware exceeded the action levels. (See &quot;New Initiatives for Import Safety,&quot; FDA Consumer, October 1992.)</p>
<p>FDA also has taken new regulatory steps to ensure that lead continues to stay at lowest possible levels in food. On Nov. 25, 
1992, the agency published in the Federal Register a proposed regulation that would prohibit the use of tin-coated lead foil 
capsules (coverings for the cork and neck area) on wine bottles because lead from the capsule may get into the wine. Another 
proposal, published Jan. 5, 1993, would set a limit for lead in bottled water of no more than 5 parts per billion. And FDA 
intends to propose a regulation that would prohibit lead solder in food cans. The prohibition would also apply to imports-food in 
lead-soldered cans would not be allowed to enter the country.</p>
<p>On April 1, 1993, FDA published interim action levels for lead in food packaged in lead-soldered containers. Products that 
exceed these levels are subject to regulatory action, including recalls. The interim action levels will be in effect until FDA can 
permanently ban lead-soldered food cans.</p>
<h4>Lead and Cans</h4>
<p>Before the U.S. canning industry voluntarily eliminated the use of lead in solder to seal food cans, FDA estimates that from 14 to 
45 percent of lead in food came from such seals. During the food packaging process, the can body, with its side seam 
mechanically crimped together, passed over a pot of molten solder, where a rotating roll transferred solder to the seam. The 
excess solder was then wiped from the can, and the can was cooled until the solder was set. Although solder was not applied to 
the inside of the can, some of it had to bleed through the ends of the side seam to make a strong, leakproof can. The minute 
amount of solder that bled through the seam later leached into the food inside. Sometimes, more lead would contaminate the 
can's inner surface from the solder dust in the vicinity of the solder pot or splashes from the wiping station.</p>
<p>As more information on lead toxicity became available, the canned food industry consulted with FDA on ways to make a safer 
product. In response, industry voluntarily switched to unseamed cans and to sealing can seams with nonlead-solder techniques, 
such as forge and wire welding.</p>
<p>The industry voluntarily stopped packaging infant formula in lead-soldered cans in 1982, according to information submitted to 
FDA by the Infant Formula Council. As for all of the other canned foods, the Can Manufacturers Institute informed FDA that as 
of November 1991, lead-soldered cans were no longer produced in the United States. But lead-soldered cans are permitted in 
some countries that export canned food to us.</p>
<p>The interim action levels published this April primarily affect imported food. FDA estimates that up to 10 percent (some 230 
million pounds) of food imported each year may be packaged in lead-soldered cans. Some ethnic groups use imported canned 
foods as staples in their diets. Also, food in lead-soldered cans may enter the United States through individual purchases outside 
the United States. A 1991 San Diego County screening program for lead in children's blood led to detection by the Board of 
Health of a dangerously high blood-lead level in a 1-year-old child whose parents had brought back fruit juice in lead-soldered 
cans from a grocery store across the Mexican border. Investigators found that the same product had entered the United States 
through import channels. The juice products were recalled nationwide (see 'Toddler's Blood Test Leads to Juice Recall&quot; in the 
Investigators' Reports section of the December 1992 FDA Consumer.</p>
<p>To decrease the possibility of lead leaching from coated foil capsules into wine, wipe the bottle rim and top of the cork with a 
cloth dampened with water or lemon juice.</p>
<p>The upcoming FDA proposal to prohibit the use of lead-soldered food cans would prevent such incidents. As an additional 
measure, FDA has sent letters to more than 65 countries to inform them of FDA's concerns and to learn about their regulations 
on lead-soldered food cans. Many of the countries that responded are aware of the problems with lead solder in food cans and 
have established their own lead limits or have adopted those set by the World Health Organization. FDA urges exporters to stop 
manufacturing lead-soldered food cans, and has made its concerns known through these letters and other discussions at world 
forums over the last few years.</p>
<h4>Foil Capsules on Wine Bottles </h4>
<p>Many imported and domestic wines have lead foil capsules (coated on both sides with a thin layer of tin) covering the cork and 
neck of the bottle. The capsule is used to prevent insect infestation of the cork area and as an oxygen barrier. It's also used to 
impart an image and feel that are perceived as important to product differentiation and to the marketing of fine wines.</p>
<p>Data on the lead content in wine with lead foil seals were developed by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms 
(ATF). Higher lead levels were found in samples of wines poured from the bottle than in unpoured samples. The ATF report 
concluded that &quot;significant lead contamination&quot; could result if the wine seeps between the cork and the wrap or capsule, causing 
the foil seal to corrode and leave lead salt deposits on the rim. Although the lead levels found do not pose a short-term health 
hazard, FDA's concern is with long-term exposure for individuals who regularly consume wine.</p>
<p>Based on these findings, FDA proposed a regulation to declare lead foil wraps for wines to be a food additive that is unsafe, and 
further to prohibit the use of such wraps on wine bottles. Many wine producers in the United States and Europe have already 
stopped using them.</p>
<p>FDA advises consumers to wipe the rim and top of the cork of wine bottles sealed with foil with a cloth dampened with water or 
lemon juice before removing the cork. Pregnant and lactating women have long been advised to avoid alcoholic beverages, 
including wine. Lead contamination is another good reason for pregnant women to refrain from drinking wine.</p>
<p>Even at low levels, lead not excreted through the digestive system accumulates in the body and is absorbed directly into blood 
and soft tissues, including the kidney, bone marrow, liver, and brain. When lead leaves the bloodstream, it is stored in bone, 
along with other minerals, where it continues to build over a lifetime.</p>
<p>In average adults, 10 to 15 percent of lead that reaches the digestive tract is absorbed. Young children and pregnant women, 
however, absorb as much as 50 percent. The body cannot distinguish between calcium and lead. Once lead enters the body, it is 
assimilated in the bloodstream in the same manner as calcium, and, because young children and pregnant women absorb calcium 
more readily to meet their extra needs, they also absorb more lead. Those with calcium deficiencies absorb even more. And 
lead, even in small amounts, may become toxic wherever it settles. (See &quot;Getting the Lead Out of Just About Everything,&quot; FDA 
Consumer, August 1991.)</p>
<p>Lead also gets into the blood of pregnant women from their own bone stores. During a period of physiological stress, such as in 
pregnancy or lactation, bone-stores of minerals, including the normally inert lead, can be mobilized back into a woman's blood 
and increase her blood-lead level. As this blood circulates, it is picked up by the ferns.</p>
<p>FDA considers children and pregnant women at highest risk for lead poisoning. FDA toxicologists say that for pregnant women, 
lead exposure is an actual, rather than potential, problem. Besides potentially harming her own health, lead can damage the 
developing ferns because it crosses the placental barrier.</p>
<p>A 1987 report in the New England Journal of Medicine shows that as little as 10 micrograms of lead per deciliter of fetal blood 
could damage a fetus early in pregnancy during its most vulnerable period of nervous system development. It can also cause 
premature birth or lower birth weight. In adults, 30 micrograms of lead per deciliter of blood can cause high blood pressure and 
damage nerves and red blood cells.</p>
<p>FDA toxicologists have set provisional total tolerable retake levels (PTTILs) of lead from all sources at 25 micrograms per day 
for pregnant women, and 6 micrograms per day for infants and children up to 6 years. For every microgram per day of lead 
intake, blood lead levels increase 0.16 micrograms per deciliter of blood in children and 0.04 micrograms per deciliter of blood 
in adults.</p>
<p>PTTILs represent the intake level FDA believes provides a reasonable margin of protection from the measurable toxic effects of 
lead from all food and nonfood sources. Scientists have not found a no-effect level of toxicity from lead. If additional research 
shows that lower blood-lead levels cause measurable adverse health effects, the PTTILs would be reduced even further.</p>
<h4>Crystal Ware </h4>
<p>Recent studies have found that lead can leach into food from lead crystal hollowware. The International Crystal Federation has 
provided FDA a report of its research on lead leaching into food and alcoholic beverages, and the industry has started a program 
in which manufacturers share technological developments to reduce lead leaching. Also, FDA has initiated studies of its own on 
lead leaching from crystal.</p>
<p>Until FDA reviews all the data and determines what further actions, if any, need to be taken, the agency advises consumers not 
to store alcoholic beverages in lead crystal decanters, and pregnant women not to routinely drink from lead crystal glasses. 
Infants should not be fed with lead crystal baby bottles.</p>
<p>Because lead is ubiquitous, FDA recognizes that no effort will totally eliminate lead from the food supply, however desirable that 
may be. But FDA and many other federal, state and local governments are working together through all available means to 
reduce exposure to lead. The initial focus is on the sources likely to result in the greatest exposure.</p>
<p>FDA uses as many sources as it can to get the story of lead to consumers, both of the harm it causes, and about how to prevent 
poisoning. Careful attention to consumer advisories can prevent unnecessary exposure to this age-old health problem. </p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Tobacco Products -- November 1992</h2>
<p>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has jurisdiction to enforce laws against false and deceptive advertising, including 
advertising for tobacco products. The FTC also has responsibility under various federal laws to insure the proper display of 
health warnings in advertising and on packaging of tobacco products sold in the United States. Further, the agency collects and 
reports to Congress information concerning cigarette and smokeless tobacco advertising, sales expenditures, and the tar, 
nicotine, and carbon monoxide content of cigarettes. This brochure provides an overview of tobacco-product laws and explains 
the FTC's role in enforcement.</p>
<h4>Warning Labels and Advertising for Cigarettes</h4>
<p>The Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act was designed to make Americans more aware of the adverse health effects 
of smoking. As enacted in 1965, the law required health warnings only on cigarette packages. In 1984, the law was amended to 
require that one of the four warning labels listed below appears in a specific format on cigarette packages and in most related 
advertising.</p>
<p>SURGEON GENERAL'S WARNING: Smoking Causes Lung Cancer, Heart Disease, Emphysema, And May Complicate 
Pregnancy.</p>
<p>SURGEON GENERAL'S WARNING: Quitting Smoking Now Greatly Reduces Serious Risks to Your Health.</p>
<p>SURGEON GENERAL'S WARNING: Smoking By Pregnant Women May Result in Fetal Injury, Premature Birth, and Low 
Birth Weight.</p>
<p>SURGEON GENERAL'S WARNING: Cigarette Smoke Contains Carbon Monoxide.</p>
<p>There are a few exceptions in the Federal law on tobacco advertising and labeling:</p>
<p>Health warning labels on outdoor-billboard advertisements are allowed to be somewhat abbreviated from those appearing in 
newspaper, magazine, and product packaging.</p>
<p>Warning labels are not required on specialty advertising items (such as pens, pencils, clothing, and sporting goods) that carry 
cigarette company logos, brand names, or other promotional messages. These items must bear warning labels, however, if they 
promote smokeless tobacco products.</p>
<p>Warning labels are not required for cigars, pipe tobacco, and roll-your-own cigarette tobacco.</p>
<h4>Warning Labels and Advertising for Smokeless Tobacco Products</h4>
<p>The FTC also enforces regulations that require health warnings to appear on all packaging and in advertising for smokeless 
tobacco products. These requirements are authorized under the Comprehensive Smokeless Tobacco Health Education Act of 
1986, enforced jointly by the FTC and the Department of Justice. Smokeless tobacco products such as chewing tobacco, moist 
snuff, and plug tobacco are used orally. The Act requires manufacturers, packagers, and importers to place one of the following 
warning labels on smokeless tobacco packages.</p>
<p>WARNING: THIS PRODUCT MAY CAUSE MOUTH CANCER</p>
<p>WARNING: THIS PRODUCT MAY CAUSE GUM DISEASE AND TOOTH LOSS</p>
<p>WARNING: THIS PRODUCT IS NOT A SAFE ALTERNATIVE TO CIGARETTES</p>
<p>The Act requires that the respective warnings be placed in a circle and arrow format on all forms of advertisements except 
billboards. The FTC has issued regulations to determine the size and format of the health warning in relation to the size of the 
package.</p>
<h4>FTC Responsibilities for the Cigarette and Smokeless Tobacco Acts</h4>
<p>The Cigarette Act and the Smokeless Tobacco Act require manufacturers and importers to submit a packaging and advertising 
plan for FTC approval. The plan must provide for appropriate label rotation on packages and in advertising for each brand of 
cigarette or smokeless product, whether manufactured in the United States or imported here. The law requires that a health 
warning appear in a conspicuous location on advertisements and packaging, and the manufacturer's plan must assure an even 
distribution of the warning statements in all parts of the U.S. where the product is sold.</p>
<p>Both of these laws require the FTC to report to Congress. Under the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act, the FTC 
reports annually the current practices and methods of cigarette advertising and promotion. The Comprehensive Smokeless 
Tobacco Health Education Act of 1986 contains the same reporting requirements -- but on a two-year basis. This Act also 
requires the FTC to compile for Congress current sales figures for smokeless tobacco products.</p>
<p>Amendments to the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act in 1971 and 1973 banned advertisements for cigarette and 
little cigar products from radio and television. The Comprehensive Smokeless Tobacco Health Education Act of 1986 extended 
the broadcast advertising ban to smokeless tobacco products.</p>
<h4>Disclosure of Tobacco Product Contents</h4>
<p>For many years, the FTC has obtained and publicized information about the constituents of tobacco smoke, such as tar, nicotine, 
and carbon monoxide. Through these disclosures, consumers who smoke have been able to choose brands with tested lower 
concentrations of such substances. In addition, since 1971, all manufacturers have been voluntarily disclosing the tar and nicotine 
content of cigarette brands in their advertisements.</p>
<h4>For More Information</h4>
<p>A single copy of the 1992 &quot;Report on Tar, Nicotine, and Carbon Monoxide of the Smoke of 534 Varieties of Domestic 
Cigarettes&quot; is available free of charge. Requests may be sent to: Public Reference, Federal Trade Commission, Washington,

<h4>-NOTICE -</h4>

     Listed in the back of this brochure are the addresses and
telephone numbers of each of the state agencies on aging and
the state insurance departments. They are available to assist
you with any questions you may have about private insurance to
supplement Medicare.<p>

     Suspected violations of the laws governing the marketing
of insurance policies should generally be reported to your
state insurance department since states are responsible for the
regulation of insurance within their boundaries.<p>

     There are, however, federal penalties for certain
violations concerning Medicare supplement insurance ("Medigap")
policies. It is, for example, a federal offense for an
insurance agent to indicate that he or she represents the
Medicare program or any other federal agency in order to sell a
policy. It is also illegal for an insurance company or agent to
sell you a policy that duplicates coverage you already have.<p>

     The federal toll-free telephone number for filing
complaints is: 1-800-638-6833<p>

<h4>DEFINITIONS OF SOME MEDICARE TERMS</h4>

    <dl>
 <dt> Actual Charge:
<dd> The amount a physician or supplier actually bills for a particular medical service or supply.
 <dt>Approved Amount: 
<dd>The amount Medicare determines to be
reasonable for a service that is covered under Part B of
Medicare. It may be less than the actual charge. For physician
services the approved amount is taken from a national fee
schedule that assigns a dollar value to all physician services
covered by Medicare.
   <dt>  Assignment: 
<dd>An arrangement whereby a physician or medical
supplier agrees to accept the Medicare-approved amount as the
total charge for services and supplies covered under Part B.
Medicare usually pays 80% of the approved amount directly to
the provider after the beneficiary meets the annual Part B
deductible of $100. The beneficiary pays the other 20%.

<dt>  Benefit Period: 
<dd>A benefit period is a way of measuring a
beneficiary's use of hospital and skilled nursing facility
services covered by Medicare. A benefit period begins the day
the beneficiary is hospitalized and ends after the beneficiary
has been out of the hospital or skilled nursing facility for 60
days in a row. If the beneficiary is hospitalized after 60
days, a new benefit period begins and most Medicare Part A
benefits are renewed. There is no limit as to the number of
benefit periods a beneficiary can have.
 <dt>  Coinsurance: 
<dd>The portion or percentage of Medicare's
approved amounts for covered services that a beneficiary is
responsible for paying. 
 <dt> Deductible: 
<dd>The amount of expense a beneficiary must first
incur before Medicare begins payment for covered service's. 
<dt>   Excess Charge:
<dd> The difference between the
Medicare-approved amount for a service or supply and the actual
charge, if the actual charge is more than the approved amount.
<dt>  Limiting Charge:
<dd> The maximum amount a physician may charge
a Medicare beneficiary for a covered physician service if the
physician does not accept assignment of the Medicare claim. The
limit is 15% more than the fee schedule amount for
nonparticipating physicians. Limiting charge information
appears on Medicare's Explanation of Medicare Benefits (EOMB)
form.
<dt>     Medicare Carrier: 
<dd>An insurance organization under contract
to the federal government to process Medicare Part B claims
from physicians and other health care providers. The names and
addresses of the carriers and areas they serve are listed in
the back of The Medicare Handbook, available from any Social
Security Administration office.
<dt>     Medicare Hospital Insurance: 
<dd>This is Part A of Medicare.
It helps pay for medically necessary inpatient care in a
hospital, skilled nursing facility or psychiatric hospital, and
for hospice and home health care.
 <dt>    Medicare Medical Insurance: 
<dd>This is Pan B of Medicare.
This pan helps pay for medically necessary physician services
and many other medical services and supplies not covered by
Part A.
<dt>     Participating Physician and Supplier: 
<dd>A physician or
supplier who agrees to accept assignment on all Medicare
claims.
</dl>

<h4>SOME BASIC THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW</h4>

     If you are like most older Americans covered by Medicare,
there are aspects of the federal health insurance program that
you find complex and confusing. You may be uncertain about what
Medicare covers and doesn't cover and how much it pays toward
your medical expenses. And, like many other beneficiaries, you
want to know what, if any, additional health insurance you
should buy.<p>

     This booklet will give you a better understanding of your
Medicare benefits, identify the gaps in your Medicare coverage,
and provide tips on shopping for private health insurance to
fill those gaps. As a Medicare beneficiary, you probably are
already aware that Medicare does not cover all of your
potential health care costs. For example, you are responsible
for Medicare's deductibles and coinsurance and for charges for
services not covered by Medicare.<p>

     Few people can afford to pay all of those expenses out of
their own funds, so many rely on supplemental insurance to
cover some of the costs. As you seek to limit your
out-of-pocket costs for health care services, you will find
that there are three basic ways of doing so:<p>

  1. Through the purchase of Medicare supplement insurance,
     which is also called "Medigap" or "MedSup" insurance;<p>

  2. By enrolling in a managed care plan, such as a health
     maintenance organization (HMO) that has a contract to
     serve Medicare beneficiaries; and,<p>

  3. By continuing coverage under an employer-provided health
     insurance policy, if you are eligible for such protection.<p>

     In addition, for beneficiaries who qualify, some costs may
be covered by state Medicaid programs (see page 17).<p>

     Each of these ways will be discussed in subsequent
sections. Special attention will be devoted to employer plans
and Medigap insurance, which most Medicare beneficiaries
purchase.<p>

<h4>Insurance Counseling</h4>

     Although the information in this booklet will help you to
be a better informed and more careful purchaser, you may wish
to obtain additional information before buying health
insurance. Information about insurance to supplement Medicare
is available from various senior citizen advocacy organizations
and governmental agencies.<p>
     You first may want to turn to your state government for
help, as all states now offer insurance counseling in
one-on-one confidential sessions with trained counselors. In
these sessions, you will be able to clarify insurance issues
that you find confusing and receive assistance in evaluating
your insurance needs. These services are provided at no charge
to you.<p>
     The telephone number for your state insurance counseling
office is listed in the directory of state insurance
departments and agencies on aging beginning on page 27.<p>

<h4>WHAT IS MEDICARE</h4>

     Before discussing Medigap and the other types of private
insurance available to supplement Medicare, it will be helpful
to review your Medicare benefits and identify the payment gaps.<p>

     Medicare is a federal health insurance program for people
65 or older, people of any age with permanent kidney failure,
and certain disabled people under 65. It is administered by the
Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) of the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The Social
Security Administration, also a part of HHS, provides
information about the program and handles enrollment.<p>


<h4>Two Parts of Medicare</h4>


     Medicare has two parts--Hospital Insurance (Part A) and
Medical Insurance (Part B). Part A is financed through part of
the Social Security (FICA) tax paid by workers and their
employers. You do not have to pay a monthly premium for
Medicare Pan A if you or your spouse is entitled to benefits
under either the Social Security or Railroad Retirement systems
or worked a sufficient period of time in federal, state, or
local government employment to be insured.<p>

     If you do not qualify for premium-free Part A benefits,
you may purchase the coverage if you are at least age 65 and
meet certain requirements. You also may buy Part A if you are
under age 65, were previously entitled to Medicare under the
disability provisions and you still have the same disabling
impairment but your disability benefits were terminated because
of your work and earnings. If you do not qualify for
premium-free Part A but had at least 30 quarters of covered
employment, the Pan A monthly premium in 1994 is $184. If you
had fewer than 30 quarters or no quarters of covered employment
the premium is $245 per month in 1994.<p>

     Part B is optional and is offered to all beneficiaries
when they become entitled to Part A. It also may be purchased
by most persons age 65 or over who do not qualify for
premium-free Part A coverage. The Part B premium, which most
Medicare beneficiaries have deducted from their monthly Social
Security check, is $41.10 per month in 1994.<p>

     You are automatically enrolled in Part B when you become
entitled to Part A unless you state that you don't want it.
Although you do not have to purchase Part B, it is a good buy
because the federal government pays about 75 percent of the
program costs.<p>

     Your Medicare card shows the coverage you have [Hospital
Insurance (Part A), Medical Insurance (Part B), or both] and
the date your coverage started. If you only have one part of
Medicare, you can get information about getting the other part
from any Social Security office.<p>


<h4>MEDICARE HOSPITAL INSURANCE BENEFITS (PART A)</h4>


     When all program requirements are met, Medicare Part A
helps pay for medically necessary inpatient care in a hospital,
skilled nursing facility or psychiatric hospital, and for
hospice care. In addition, Part A pays the full cost of
medically necessary home health care and 80 percent of the
approved cost for wheelchairs, hospital beds, and other durable
medical equipment (DME) supplied under the home health care
benefit.<p>


<h4>Benefit Periods</h4>


     Medicare Part A hospital and skilled nursing facility
benefits are paid on the basis of benefit periods. A benefit
period begins the first day you receive a Medicare-covered
service in a qualified hospital. It ends when you have been out
of a hospital or skilled nursing or rehabilitation facility for
60 days in a row. It also ends if you remain in a skilled
nursing facility but do not receive any skilled care there for
60 days in a row.<p>

     If you enter a hospital again after 60 days, a new benefit
period begins. With each new benefit period, all Part A
hospital and skilled nursing facility benefits are renewed
except for any lifetime reserve days or psychiatric hospital
benefits that were used. There is no limit to the number of
benefit periods you can have for hospital or skilled nursing
facility care.<p>


<h4>Inpatient Hospital Care</h4>


     If you are hospitalized, Medicare will pay all charges for
covered hospital services during the first 60 days of a benefit
period except for the deductible. The Pan A deductible in 1994
is $696 per benefit period. You are responsible for the
deductible. In addition to the deductible, you are responsible
for a share of the daily costs if your hospital stay lasts more
than 60 days. For the 61st through the 90th day, Part A pays
for all covered services except for coinsurance of $174 a day
in 1994. You are responsible for the coinsurance.<p>

     Under Part A, you also have a lifetime reserve of 60 days
for inpatient hospital care. These lifetime reserve days may be
used whenever you are in the hospital for more than 90
consecutive days. When a reserve day is used, Part A pays for
all covered services except for coinsurance of $348 a day in
1994. Again, the coinsurance is your responsibility. Once used,
reserve days are not renewed.<p>


Gaps in Medicare Inpatient Hospital Coverage:<p>

<ul>
   <li> You pay $696 deductible on first admission to hospital in
     each benefit period.

   <li> You pay $174 daily coinsurance for days 61 through 90.

   <li> No coverage beyond 90 days in any benefit period unless
     you have "lifetime reserve" days available and use them.

   <li> You pay $348 daily coinsurance for each lifetime reserve
     day used.

   <li>No coverage for the first 3 pints of whole blood or units
     of packed cells used in each year in connection with
     covered services. To the extent the 3-pint blood
     deductible is met under Part B, it does not have to be met
     under Part A.

   <li> No coverage for a private hospital room, unless medically
     necessary, or for a private duty nurse.

   <li>No coverage for personal convenience items, such as a
     telephone or television in a hospital room.

   <li> No coverage for care that is not medically necessary or
     for non-emergency care in a hospital not certified by
     Medicare.

   <li.> No coverage for care received outside the U. S. and its
     territories, except under limited circumstances in Canada
     and Mexico.
</ul>

<h4>Skilled Nursing Facility Care</h4>


     A skilled nursing facility (SNF) is a special kind of
facility that primarily furnishes skilled nursing and
rehabilitation services. It may be a separate facility or a
distinct part of another facility, such as a hospital. Medicare
benefits are payable only if you require daily skilled care
which, as a practical matter, can only be provided in a skilled
nursing facility on an inpatient basis, and the care is
provided in a facility certified by Medicare. Medicare will not
pay for your stay if the services you receive are primarily
personal care or custodial services, such as assistance in
walking, getting in and out of bed, eating, dressing, bathing
and taking medicine.<p>

     To qualify for Medicare coverage for skilled nursing
facility care, you must have been in a hospital at least three
consecutive days (not counting the day of discharge) before
entering a skilled nursing facility. You must be admitted to
the facility for the same condition for which you were treated
in the hospital and the admission generally must be within 30
days of your discharge from the hospital. Your physician must
certify that you need, and receive, skilled nursing or skilled
rehabilitation services on a daily basis.<p>

     Medicare can help pay for up to 100 days of skilled care
in a skilled nursing facility during a benefit period. All
covered services for the first 20 days of care are fully paid
by Medicare. All covered services for the next 80 days are paid
by Medicare except for a daily coinsurance amount. The daily
coinsurance in 1994 is $87. You are responsible for the
coinsurance. If you require more than 100 days of care in a
benefit period, you are responsible for all charges beginning
with the 101st day.<p>

Gaps in Medicare Skilled Nursing Facility, Coverage:<p>

<ul>
 <li>  You pay $87 daily coinsurance for days 21 through 100 in
     each benefit period.

<li>   No coverage beyond 100 days in a benefit period.

  <li> No coverage for care in a nursing home, or in a SNF not
     certified by Medicare, or for just custodial care in a
     Medicare-certified SNF.

  <li> No coverage for 3-pint blood deductible (see list of gaps
     under inpatient hospital care).</ul>


<h4>Home Health Care</h4>


     Medicare fully covers medically necessary home health
visits if you are homebound, including parttime or intermittent
skilled nursing services. A Medicare-certified home health
agency can also furnish the services of physical and speech
therapists. Should you require speech-language pathology,
physical therapy, continuing occupational therapy or
intermittent skilled nursing services, are confined to your
home, and are under the care of a physician, Medicare can also
pay for medical supplies, necessary part-time or intermittent
home health aide services, occupational therapy, and medical
social services. Coverage is also provided for a portion of the
cost of wheelchairs, hospital beds and other durable medical
equipment (DME) provided under a plan-of-care set up and
periodically reviewed by a physician.<p>


<h4>Gaps in Medicare Home Health Coverage</h4>
<ul>
 <li>   No coverage for full-time nursing care.

  <li>  No coverage for drugs or for meals delivered to your home

<li>   You pay 20% of the Medicare-approved amount for durable
     medical equipment, plus charges in excess of the approved
     amount on unassigned claims.

  <li>  No coverage for homemaker services that are primarily to
     assist you in meeting personal care or housekeeping needs.
</ul>

<h4>Hospice Care</h4>

     Medicare beneficiaries certified as terminally ill may
choose to receive hospice care rather than regular Medicare
benefits for their terminal illness. Part A can pay for two
90-day hospice benefit periods, a subsequent period of 30 days,
and a subsequent extension of unlimited duration. If you enroll
in a Medicare-certified hospice program, you will receive
medical and support services necessary for symptom management
and pain relief. When these services which are most often
provided in your home-are furnished by a Medicare-certified
hospice program, the coverage includes: physician services,
nursing care, medical appliances and supplies (including drugs
for symptom management and pain relief), short-term inpatient
care, counseling, therapies, home health aide and homemaker
services.<p>

     You do not have to pay Medicare's deductibles and
coinsurance for services and supplies furnished under the
hospice benefit. You must pay only limited charges for
outpatient drugs and inpatient respite care. In the event you
require medical services for a condition unrelated to the
terminal illness, regular Medicare benefits are available. When
regular benefits are used, you are responsible for the
applicable Medicare deductible and coinsurance amounts.<p>


<h4>Gaps in Medicare Hospice Coverage:</h4>
 <ul>
<li> You pay limited charges for inpatient respite care and
     outpatient drugs.

  <li>You pay deductibles and coinsurance amounts when regular
     Medicare benefits are used for treatment of a condition
     other than the terminal illness.
</ul>
<h4>Psychiatric Hospital Care</h4>

     Part A helps pay for up to 190 days of inpatient care in a
Medicare-participating psychiatric hospital in your lifetime.
Once you have used 190 days (or have used fewer than 190 days
but have exhausted your inpatient hospital coverage), Part A
doesn't pay for any more inpatient care in a psychiatric
hospital. However, psychiatric care in general hospitals,
rather than in free-standing psychiatric hospitals, is not
subject to this 190-day limit. Inpatient psychiatric care in a
general hospital is treated the same as other Medicare
inpatient hospital care. If you are a patient in a psychiatric
hospital on the first day of your entitlement to Medicare,
there are additional limitations on the number of hospital days
that Medicare will pay for.<p>

<h4>Gaps in Medicare Inpatient Psychiatric Hospital Care:</h4>

   * No coverage for care after you have received 190 days of
     such specialized treatment in your lifetime (even if you
     have not yet exhausted your inpatient hospital coverage).<p>

<h4>MEDICARE MEDICAL INSURANCE (PART B) BENEFITS</h4>

    Part B helps pay for medically necessary physician
services no matter where you receive them--at home, in the
doctor's office, in a clinic, in a nursing home, or in a
hospital. It also covers related medical services and supplies,
medically necessary outpatient hospital services, X-rays and
laboratory tests. Coverage is also provided for certain
ambulance services and the use at home of durable medical
equipment, such as wheelchairs and hospital beds.<p>

     Additionally, Part B covers medically necessary physical
therapy, occupational therapy, and speech-language pathology
services in a doctor's office, as an outpatient, or in your
home. Mental health services are covered as are mammograms and
Pap smears. And if you qualify for home health care but do not
have Part A, then Part B pays for all covered home health
visits.<p>

     Outpatient prescription drugs generally are not covered by
Part B. The exceptions include certain drugs furnished to
hospice enrollees, non-self administrable drugs provided as
part of a physician's services, and special drugs, such as
drugs furnished during the first year after an organ
transplantation, erythropoetin for home dialysis patients, and
certain oral cancer drugs.<p>

     When you use your Part B benefits, you will be required to
pay the first $100 (the annual deductible) each calendar year.
The deductible must represent charges for services and supplies
covered by Medicare. It also must be based on the Medicare
approved amounts, not the actual charges billed by your
physician or medical supplier.<p>

     After you meet the deductible, Part B generally pays 80
percent of the Medicare-approved amount for covered services
you receive the rest of the year. You are responsible for the
other 20 percent. If you require home health services, you do
not have to pay a deductible or coinsurance. You do, however,
have to pay 20 percent of the Medicare-approved amount for any
durable medical equipment! supplied under the Medicare home
health benefit.<p>

     You may also have other out-of-pocket costs under Part B
if your physician or medical supplier does not accept
assignment of your Medicare claim and charges more than
Medicare's approved amount. The difference to be paid is called
the "excess charge" or "balance billing." You should be aware,
however, that there are certain charge limitations mandated by
federal law (discussed below) and that some states also limit
physician charges.<p>

<h4>Medicare-Approved Amount</h4>

     The Medicare-approved amount for physician services
covered by Part B is based on a national fee schedule. The
schedule assigns a dollar value to each physician service based
on work, practice costs and malpractice insurance costs. Under
this payment system, each time you go to a physician for a
service covered by Medicare, the amount Medicare will recognize
for that service will be taken from the national fee schedule.
Medicare generally pays 80 percent of that amount.<p>

     Because you cannot tell in advance whether the approved
amount and the actual charge for covered services and supplies
will be the same, always ask your physicians and medical
suppliers whether they accept assignment of Medicare claims.<p>

<h4>Accepting Assignment</h4>

     Those who take assignment on a Medicare claim agree to
accept the Medicare-approved amount as payment in full. They
are paid directly by Medicare, except for the deductible and
coinsurance amounts that you must pay.<p>

     For example, for your first annual visit, if you go to a
participating physician, or if you go to a nonparticipating
physician who accepts assignment, and the Medicare-approved
amount for the service you receive is $200, you will be billed
$120: $100 for the annual deductible plus 20 percent of the
remaining $100, or $20. Medicare would pay the other $80.
Having met the deductible for the year, the next time you used
Part B services furnished by a physician or medical supplier
who accepts assignment, you would be responsible for only 20
percent of the Medicare-approved amount.<p>
     Physicians and suppliers who sign Medicare participation
agreements accept assignment on all Medicare claims. Their
names and addresses are listed in The Medicare Participating
Physician/Supplier Directory, which is distributed to senior
citizen organizations, all Social Security and Railroad
Retirement Board offices, hospitals, and all state and area
offices of the Administration on Aging.<p>

     It also is available free by writing or calling the
insurance company that processes Medicare Pan B claims for your
area. Called a Medicare "carrier," the company's name, address
and telephone number are listed in the back of The Medicare
Handbook, available from any Social Security office.<p>

     Even if your physician or supplier does not participate in
Medicare, ask before receiving any services or supplies whether
he or she will accept assignment of your Medicare claim. Many
physicians and suppliers accept assignment on a case-by-case
basis. If your physician or supplier will not accept
assignment, you are responsible for paying all permissible
charges.<p>

     Medicare will then reimburse you its share of the approved
amount for the services or supplies you received. Regardless of
whether your physician or supplier accepts assignment, they are
required to file your Medicare claim for you.<p>

     In certain situations nonparticipating providers of
services are required by law to accept assignment. For
instance, all physicians and qualified laboratories must accept
assignment for Medicare-covered clinical diagnostic laboratory
tests. Physicians also must accept assignment for covered
services provided to beneficiaries with incomes low enough to
qualify for Medicaid payment of their Medicare cost-sharing
requirements (see page 18).<p>

<h4>Physician Charge Limits</h4>

     While physicians who do not accept assignment of a
Medicare claim can charge more than physicians who do, there is
a limit as to the amount they can charge you for services
covered by Medicare. Under the law, they are not permitted to
charge more than 115 percent of the Medicare-approved amount
for the service. Physicians who knowingly, willfully, and
repeatedly charge more than the legal limit are subject to
sanctions. If you think you have been overcharged, or you want
to know what the limiting charge is for a particular service,
contact the Medicare carrier for your area. Limiting charge
information also appears on the Explanation of Medicare
Benefits (EOMB) form that you generally receive from the
Medicare carrier when you go to a physician for a
Medicare-covered service. You do not have to pay charges that
exceed the legal limit.<p>

     If you think your physician has exceeded the charge limit,
you should contact the physician and ask for a reduction in the
charge, or a refund, if you have paid more than the charge
limit. If you cannot resolve the issue with the physician, you
can call your Medicare carrier and ask for assistance.<p>

<h4>More Charge Limits</h4>

     Another federal law requires physicians who do not accept
assignment for elective surgery to give you a written estimate
of your costs before the surgery if the total charge will be
$500 or more. If the physician did not give you a written
estimate, you are entitled to a refund of any amount you paid
in excess of the Medicare-approved amount. Any nonparticipating
physician who provides you with services that he or she knows
or has reason to believe Medicare will determine to be
medically unnecessary and thus will not pay for, is required to
so notify you in writing before performing the service. If
written notice is not given, and you did not know that Medicare
would not pay, you cannot be held liable to pay for that
service. However, if you did receive written notice and signed
an agreement to pay for the service, you will be held liable to
pay.<p>

<h4>Medicare Benefit Charts</h4>

     The charts on pages 8 and 9 describe Medicare benefits
only. The "You Pay" column itemizes expenses you are
responsible for and must pay out of your own pocket or through
the purchase of some type of private insurance as described in
this booklet.<p>

<h4>TYPES OF PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE</h4>

     Whether you need health insurance in addition to Medicare
is a decision that only you can make. As you saw from the
review of your Medicare benefits, Medicare does not offer
complete health insurance protection. Private health insurance
can help fill many of the gaps. But before buying insurance to
supplement your Medicare benefits, make sure you need it. Not
everyone does (see page 17). In general it is advisable to buy
the additional protection that private health insurance can
provide. If you decide to buy supplemental insurance, shop
carefully and buy a policy that offers the kind of additional
help you think you need most.<p>

     A variety of private insurance policies is available to
help pay for medical expenses, services and supplies that
Medicare covers only partly or not at all. The basic types of
policies include:<p>
<ol>
 <li> Medigap, which pays some of the amounts that Medicare does
     not pay for covered services and may pay for certain
     services not covered by Medicare.<p>

 <li> Managed care plans [these include health maintenance
     organizations (HMOs) and competitive medical plans
     (CMPs)], from which you purchase health care services
     directly for a fixed monthly premium;<p>

 <li>Continuation or conversion of an employer-provided or
     other policy you have when you reach 65;<p>

  <li>Nursing home or long-term care policies, which pay cash
     amounts for each day of covered nursing home or at-home
     care;<p>
 

  <li> Hospital indemnity policies, which pay only when you need
     treatment for the insured disease.<p>


 <li> Specified disease policies, which pay only when you need
     treatment for the insured disease.<p>

</ol>

<h4>Medigap</h4>

     Medigap insurance is regulated by federal and state law
and must be clearly identified as Medicare supplement
insurance. Unlike other types of health insurance, it is
designed specifically to supplement Medicare's benefits by
filling in some of the gaps in Medicare coverage.<p>

     To make it easier for consumers to comparison shop for
Medigap insurance, nearly all states, U.S. territories, and the
District of Columbia have adopted regulations that limit the
number of different Medigap policies that can be sold in any of
those jurisdictions to no more than 10 standard benefit plans.
The plans, which have letter designations ranging from "A"
through "J", were developed by the National Association of
Insurance Commissioners and incorporated into state and federal
laws. See pages 22-24 for descriptions and comparisons of the
10 plans.<p>

     Plan A of the 10 standard Medigap plans is the "basic"
benefit package. Each of the other nine plans includes the
basic package plus a different combination of benefits. The
plans cover specific expenses either not covered or not fully
covered by Medicare, with "A" being the most basic policy and
"J" the most comprehensive. Insurers are not permitted to
change the combination of benefits in any of the plans or to
change the letter designations.<p>

     Each state must allow the sale of Plan A, and all Medigap
insurers must make Plan A available. Insurers are not required
to offer any of the other nine plans, but most offer several
plans, and some offer all 10. Insurers can independently decide
which of the nine optional plans they will sell as long as the
plans they select have been approved for sale in the state in
which they are to be offered.<p>

     Some states have limited the number of plans available in
the state. Delaware does not permit Plans C, F, G and H to be
sold in the state. Pennsylvania and Vermont do not permit the
sale of Plans F, G and I. (As this guide was being prepared for
printing, however, Pennsylvania was considering a proposal that
would permit the sale of all 10 plans.)<p>

     Residents of Minnesota, Massachusetts and Wisconsin will
find that their Medigap plans are different than those sold in
other states. This is because those states had alternative
Medigap standardization programs in effect before the federal
legislation standardizing Medigap was enacted. Therefore, they
were not required to change their benefit plans. If you live in
Minnesota, Massachusetts or Wisconsin, you should contact the
state insurance department to find out what Medigap coverage is
available to you.<p>

     The only areas where standardization is not in effect are
Guam, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern
Mariana Islands.<p>

     Comparing Medigap Plans: To make it easier for consumers
to compare plans and premiums, the same format, language, and
definitions must be used in describing the benefits of each of
the plans. A uniform chart and outline of coverage also must be
used by the insurer to summarize those benefits for you.<p>

     As you shop for a Medigap policy, keep in mind that each
company's products are alike, so they are competing on service,
reliability and price. Compare benefits and premiums and be
satisfied that the insurer is reputable before buying. And in
selecting the benefits that meet your needs, remember that
Medicare pays only for services it determines to be medically
necessary and only the amount it determines to be reasonable.<p>

     Medigap policies pay most, if not all, Medicare
coinsurance amounts and may provide coverage for Medicare's
deductibles. Some of the 10 standard plans pay for services not
covered by Medicare and some pay for charges in excess of
Medicare's approved amount. Look for the plan that best meets
your needs.<p>

     All standard Medigap plans must have a loss ratio of at
least 65 percent for individual policies and 75 percent for
group policies. This means that on average either 65 cents or
75 cents of each premium dollar goes for benefits.<p>


     Unlike some types of health coverage that restrict where
and from whom you can receive care, Medigap policies generally
pay the same supplemental benefits regardless of your choice of
health care provider. If Medicare pays for a service, wherever
provided, the standard Medigap policy must pay its regular
share of benefits. The only exception is Medicare SELECT
insurance, discussed on page 13.<p>

     Besides the standardized benefit plans, federal law
permits states to allow an insurer to add "new and innovative
benefits" to a standardized plan that otherwise complies with
applicable standards. Any such new or innovative benefits must
be cost-effective, not otherwise available in the marketplace,
and offered in a manner that is consistent with the goal of
simplification. Check with your state insurance department to
find out whether such benefits are available in your state.<p>

     Your Right To Medigap Coverage: If you are 65 or older,
state and federal laws guarantee that for a period of 6 months
from the date you first enroll in Medicare Part B, you have a
right to buy the Medigap policy of your choice regardless of
your health conditions.<p>

     During this 6-month open enrollment period, you have the
choice of any of the different Medigap policies sold by any
insurer doing Medigap business in your state. The company
cannot deny or condition the issuance or effectiveness, or
discriminate in the pricing of a policy, because of your
medical history, health status, or claims experience. The
company can, however, impose the same preexisting condition
restrictions (see page 19) that it applies to Medigap policies
sold outside the open enrollment period.<p>

     Many individuals are enrolled automatically in Pan
B as soon as they rum 65, or they sign up during an initial
7-month enrollment period that begins 3 months before they turn
65. If you are in this group, your Part B coverage generally
starts in the month you turn 65 or shortly thereafter,
depending on when you applied for Part B. Your Medigap open
enrollment period starts as soon as your Part B coverage
starts.<p>

     Others may delay their enrollment in Part B. For example,
if after turning 65, you continue to work and choose to be
continuously covered by an employer insurance plan, or if you
are continuously covered under a spouse's employment related
insurance instead of Medicare Part B, you will have a special
7-month enrollment period for Part B. It begins with the month
your or your spouse's work ends or when you are no longer
covered under the employer plan, whichever comes first. Your
6-month Medigap open enrollment period starts when your Part B
coverage begins.<p>

     If you are covered under an employer group health plan
when you become eligible for Part B at age 65, carefully
consider your options. Once you enroll in Part B the 6-month
Medigap open enrollment period starts and cannot be extended or
repeated.<p>

     If you cannot defer Part B enrollment as described above,
but are 65 or older and are eligible for Part B but never
signed up for it, you may buy Part B during Medicare's annual
general enrollment period. It runs from January 1 through March
31. If you sign-up during an open enrollment period, both your
Part B coverage and Medigap open enrollment period begin the
following July 1.<p>

     Your Medicare card shows the effective dates for your Part
A and/or Part B coverage. To figure whether you are in your
Medigap open enrollment period, add 6 months to the effective
date of your Part B coverage. If the date is in the future and
you are at least 65, you are eligible for open enrollment. If
the date is in the past, you are not eligible.<p>

     If you are under age 65, disabled, and enrolled in
Medicare Part B, you are not eligible for Medigap open
enrollment unless your state requires open enrollment for
persons under 65 who qualify for Medicare because of a
disability. Moreover, unless your state requires otherwise, you
will not be eligible for the Medigap open enrollment period
when you turn 65 because you will not be enrolling in Part B
for the first time.<p>

     Older Medigap Policies: Current federal requirements
generally do not apply to Medigap policies in force in a state
before the requirements which took effect in that state in
1992. Depending on which state you live in, you will not have
to switch to one of the 10 standard plans if you have an older
policy that is guaranteed renewable.<p>

     Some states, however, have specific requirements that
affect existing non-standard policies. For example, some states
require or permit insurers to convert older policies to the
standardized plans. Check with your state insurance department
to find out what state-specific requirements are in force. Even
if you are not required to convert an older policy, you may
want to consider switching to one of the standardized Medigap
plans if it is to your advantage and an insurer is willing to
sell you one.<p>

     If you do switch, you will not be allowed to go back to
the old policy. Before switching, compare benefits and
premiums, and determine if there are waiting periods for any of
the benefits in the new policy. Some of the older policies may
provide superior coverage, especially for prescription drugs
and extended skilled nursing care.<p>

     If you had the old Medigap policy at least 6 months and
you decide to switch, the new policy is not permitted to impose
a waiting period for a preexisting condition if you satisfied a
waiting period for a similar benefit under your old policy. If,
however, a benefit is included in the new policy that was not
in the old policy, a waiting period of up to 6 months unless
prohibited by your state may be applied to that particular
benefit.<p>

     Because it is unlawful for anyone to sell you insurance
that duplicates coverage you already have, and because you do
not need more than one Medigap policy, you must sign a
statement that you intend to replace your current policy and
will not keep both policies. Do not cancel the old policy until
the new one is in force and you have decided to keep it (see
"Free Look," page 20).<p>

     Medigap Insurance Defined: Under state and federal laws,
Medigap policies are policies designed to supplement your
Medicare benefits. They must provide specific benefits that
pay, within limits, some or all of the costs of services either
not covered or not fully covered by Medicare. The definition
does not include all insurance products that may help you cover
out-of-pocket costs. For example, neither a health plan offered
by a company for current or former employees, nor by a labor
organization for current or former members, is Medigap
insurance. Nor are limited benefit plans such as hospital
indemnity insurance. They do not qualify because they are not
required. to provide the same benefits that the 10 standard
Medigap plans must provide.<p>

     Similarly, coverage provided to individuals enrolled in
managed care plans, such as health maintenance organizations
(HMOs) under contracts or agreements with the federal
government, does not meet the definition of Medigap insurance
even though some of the coverage may be similar. On the other
hand, an HMO's supplemental insurance product sold to an
individual Medicare beneficiary who is not enrolled under
either an employer plan or a federal contract or agreement,
does qualify as Medigap insurance.<p>

     Medicare SELECT. A Medicare supplement health insurance
product called "Medicare SELECT" is permitted to be sold in
Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Illinois, Indiana,
Kentucky, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, Noah Dakota,
Ohio, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin. Medicare SELECT, which
may be offered in the designated states by insurance companies
and HMOs, is the same as standard Medigap insurance in nearly
all respects. If you buy a Medicare SELECT policy, you are
buying one of the 10 standard Medigap plans (see page 22).<p>

     The only difference between Medicare SELECT and standard
Medigap insurance is that Medicare SELECT policies will only
pay or provide full supplemental benefits if covered services
are obtained through specified health care professionals and
facilities. Medicare SELECT policies are expected to have lower
premiums because of this limitation. The specified health care
professionals and facilities, called "preferred providers," are
selected by the insurance company or HMO. Each issuer of a
Medicare SELECT policy makes arrangements with its own network
of preferred providers.<p>

     If you have a Medicare SELECT policy, each time you
receive covered services from a preferred provider, Medicare
will pay its share of the approved charges and the insurer will
pay or provide the full supplemental benefits provided for in
the policy. Medicare SELECT insurers must also pay supplemental
benefits for emergency health care furnished by providers
outside the preferred provider network. In general, Medicare
SELECT policies deny payment or pay less than the full benefit
if you go outside the network for non-emergency services.
Medicare, however, will still pay its share of approved charges
if the services you receive outside the network are services
covered by Medicare.<p>

     Medicare SELECT will be evaluated through 1994 to
determine if it should be continued and made available
throughout the nation. Companies selling Medicare SELECT
policies are required to provide for the continuation of
coverage if the policies are discontinued. If the program is
not extended, Medicare SELECT policyholders will have the
option to purchase any standard Medigap policy that the
insurance company or HMO offers, if in fact it issues Medigap
insurance other than Medicare SELECT. To the extent possible,
the replacement policy would have to provide similar benefits.<p>

     Carrier Filing of Medigap Claims. Under certain
circumstances, when you receive medical services covered by
both Medicare and your Medigap insurance, you may not have to
file a separate claim with your Medigap insurer in order to
have payment made directly to your physician or medical
supplier. By law, the Medicare carrier that processes Medicare
claims for your area must send your claim to the Medigap
insurer for payment when the following three conditions are met
for a Medicare Part B claim:<p>

  1. Your physician or supplier must have signed a
     participation agreement with Medicare to accept assignment
     of Medicare claims for all patients who are Medicare
     beneficiaries:<p>

  2. Your policy must be a Medigap policy: and<p>

  3. You must instruct your physician to indicate on the
     Medicare claim form that you wish payment of Medigap
     benefits to be made to the participating physician or
     supplier. Your physician will put your Medigap policy
     number on the Medicare claim form.<p>

     When these conditions are met, the Medicare carrier will
process the Medicare claim, send the claim to the Medigap
insurer and generally send you an Explanation of Medicare
Benefits (EOMB). Your Medigap insurer will pay benefits
directly to your physician or medical supplier and send you a
notice that they have done so. If the insurer refuses to pay
the physician directly when these three conditions are met, you
should report this to your state insurance department. For more
information on Medigap claim filing by the carrier, contact the
Medicare carrier. Look in The Medicare Handbook for the name
and telephone number of the carrier for your area.<p>

<h4>Managed Care Plans That Contract With Medicare</h4>

     Managed care plans, also called coordinated care and
prepaid plans, include health maintenance organizations (HMOs)
and competitive medical plans (CMPs). They might be thought of
as a combination insurance company and doctor/hospital. Like an
insurance company, they cover health care costs in return for a
monthly premium, and like a doctor or hospital, they arrange
for health care.<p>

     As a Medicare beneficiary, you can choose how you will
receive hospital, doctor, and other health care services
covered by Medicare. You can receive them either through the
traditional fee-for-service delivery system or through a
managed care plan that has a contract with Medicare. If you
choose fee-for-service care, you should consider purchasing
Medigap insurance.<p>

     If you enroll in a Medicare-contracting HMO or CMP, you
will not need a Medigap policy. In fact, insurers are
prohibited from issuing you one because it would duplicate your
HMO or CMP benefits. If you have a Medigap policy and decide to
enroll in a plan, you will be asked to provide an assurance
that you will give up the Medigap policy.<p>

     Should you enroll in a managed care plan and later
disenroll and return to fee-for-service care, you likely will
be able to buy a Medigap policy, but you may not get the
policy; of your choice, especially if you have a health
problem. On the other hand, both disabled and aged Medicare
beneficiaries generally may enroll in a Medicare-contracting
HMO or CMP without regard to any health problems they may have.
For this and other reasons, managed care can be an attractive
option for many beneficiaries.<p>

     A managed care plan generally arranges with a network of
health care providers (doctors, hospitals, skilled nursing
facilities, etc.) to offer comprehensive, coordinated medical
services to plan members on a prepaid basis. If you enroll in
an HMO or CMP with a Medicare contract; services usually must
be obtained from the professionals and facilities that are part
of the plan, except in a medical emergency.<p>

     The plan must provide or arrange for all Part A and B
services (if you are covered under both parts of Medicare).
Some plans also provide benefits beyond what Medicare covers,
such as preventive care, prescription drugs, dental care,
hearing aids and eyeglasses.<p>

     Medicare makes a monthly payment to the plan to cover
Medicare's share of the cost of the services you receive.
Additionally, most plans charge enrollees a monthly premium and
nominal copayments as services are used. Usually there are no
other charges--no matter how many times you visit the doctor,
are hospitalized, or use other covered services. Medicare's
deductibles and coinsurance do not apply to beneficiaries
enrolled in plans with Medicare contracts.<p>

     If you enroll in an HMO or a CMP that has a "risk"
contract with Medicare, Medicare will not pay for non-emergency
services you receive from providers outside of the HMO or CMP.
That is, you must receive all your health care benefits (except
in an emergency) from the HMO or CMP in order to be covered.<p>

     If you enroll in a plan that has a "cost" contract with
Medicare, you can receive covered services either through the
plan or outside the plan. If you go outside the plan for
non-emergency services, Medicare will still pay but the plan
will not. You would be responsible for the same charges that
you would be liable for if you were only covered by Medicare,
but you would no longer have a Medigap policy to cover those
charges.<p>

     You are eligible to enroll in a managed care plan with a
Medicare contract if you live in the plan's service area, are
enrolled in Medicare Part B, do not have permanent kidney
failure, and have not elected the Medicare hospice benefit. The
plan must enroll Medicare beneficiaries in the order of
application, without health screening, during at least one open
enrollment period each year.<p>


     Before joining a plan, be sure to read the plan's
membership materials carefully to learn your rights and the
nature and extent of your coverage. If you live in an area that
is served by more than one managed care plan, compare benefits,
costs and other features to determine which plan meets your
needs. Also, determine which type of contract the plan has with
Medicare.<p>


<h4>Group Insurance</h4>

     There are two principal sources of group insurance:
employers and voluntary associations.<p>

     Employer Group Insurance for Retirees. Many people have
private insurance when they reach age 65 that often is
purchased through their or their spouse's current employer or
union membership. If you have such coverage, find out if it can
be continued when you or your spouse retires. Check the price
and the benefits, including benefits for your spouse.<p>

     Group health insurance that is continued after retirement
usually has the advantage of having no waiting periods or
exclusions for preexisting conditions, and the coverage is
usually based on group premium rates, which may be lower than
the premium rates for individually purchased policies. One note
of caution, however. If you have a spouse under 65 who was
covered under the prior policy, make sure you know what effect
your continued coverage will have on his or her insurance
protection.<p>

    Furthermore, since employer group insurance policies do
not have to comply with the federal minimum benefit standards
for Medigap policies, it is important to determine what
coverage your specific retirement policy provides. While the
policy may not provide the same benefits as a Medigap policy,
it may offer other benefits such as prescription drug coverage
and routine dental care.<p>

     Special Rules for Working People Age 65 or Over. If you
are 65 or over and you or your spouse works, Medicare may be
secondary payer to any employer group health plan (EGHP)
coverage you have. This means that the employer plan pays first
on your hospital and medical bills. If the employer plan does
not pay all of your expenses, Medicare may pay secondary
benefits for Medicare-covered services to supplement the amount
paid by the employer plan.<p>


     Employers who have 20 or more employees are required to
offer the same health benefits, under the same conditions, to
employees age 65 or over and to employees' spouses who are 65
or over, that they offer to younger employees and spouses. EGHP
coverage of employers of 20 or more employees is primary to
Medicare.<p>

     You may accept or reject coverage under the EGHP. If you
accept the employer plan, it will be your primary payer. If you
reject the plan, Medicare will be the primary payer for
Medicare-covered health services that you receive. If you
reject the employer plan, you can buy supplemental insurance
but an employer cannot provide you with a plan that pays
supplemental benefits for Medicare-covered services or
subsidize such coverage. An employer may, however, offer a plan
that pays for health care services not covered by Medicare,
such as hearing aids, routine dental care, and physical
checkups.<p>

     Special Rules for Certain Disabled Medicare Beneficiaries.
Medicare is also secondary for certain people under age 65 who
are entitled to Medicare based on disability (other than those
with permanent kidney failure) and who have large group health
plan (LGHP) coverage. An LGHP is a plan of, or contributed to
by, an employer or employee organization that covers the
employees of at least one employer with 100 or more employees.<p>

     This requirement applies to those who have LGHP coverage
as an employee, employer, self-employed person, business
associate of an employer, or a family member of any of these
people. An LGHP must not treat any of these people differently
because they are disabled and have Medicare.<p>

     The term "employee" here includes both those who are
actively working despite their disability (such as disabled
Medicare beneficiaries engaged in a trial work period) and
those who are not actively working, but whom the employer
treats as employees. Medicare determines whether an individual
is considered to be an employee.<p>

     Disabled persons also have the option of accepting or
rejecting LGHP coverage. If they reject the plan, Medicare
becomes their primary payer and the employer may not provide or
subsidize supplemental coverage, except for items and services
not covered by Medicare.<p>

     Special Rules for Medicare Beneficiaries with Permanent
Kidney Failure. Medicare is secondary payer to EGHPs for 18
months for beneficiaries who have Medicare solely because of
permanent kidney failure. This requirement applies only to
those with permanent kidney failure, whether they have their
own coverage under an EGHP or are covered under an EGHP as
dependents. EGHPs are primary payers during this period without
regard to the size of the EGHP or the number of employees. The
18-month period begins with the earlier of:<p>

   * The first month in which the person becomes entitled to
     Medicare Part A or<p>

   * The first month in which an individual would have been
     entitled to Part A if he had filed an application for
     Medicare benefits.<p>

     However, EGHPs may be primary for an additional 3 months,
or a total of up to 21 months: the first three months of
dialysis (a period during which an individual generally is not
eligible for Medicare benefits) plus the first 18 months of
Medicare eligibility or entitlement. After the period of up to
21 months expires, Medicare is primary payer for entitled
individuals and the EGHP is secondary.<p>

     The Health Care Financing Administration pamphlet entitled
Medicare Coverage of Kidney Dialysis and Kidney Transplant
Services contains more information about Medicare and kidney
disease. You can get a free copy from the Social Security
Administration or the Consumer Information Center, Department
59, Pueblo, CO 81009.<p>

     Association Group Insurance. Many organizations, other
than employers, offer group health insurance coverage to their
members. Just because you are buying through a group does not
mean that you are getting a low rate. Group insurance can be as
expensive as or more costly than comparable coverage under
individual policies. Be sure you understand the benefits
included and then compare prices. Association group Medigap
insurance must comply with the same rules that apply to other
Medigap policies.<p>

     The following types of coverage are generally limited in
scope and are not substitutes for Medigap insurance or managed
care plans.<p>

<h4>Long-Term Care Insurance</h4>

     Nursing home and long-term care insurance are available to
cover custodial care in a nursing home. Some of these policies
also cover care in the home, and others are available to pay
for care in a skilled nursing facility (SNF) after your
Medicare benefits run out (see page 3 for an explanation of the
Medicare benefit for skilled nursing facility care).<p>

     If you are in the market for nursing home or longterm care
insurance, be sure you know which types of nursing homes and
services are covered by the different policies available. And
if you buy a policy, make sure it does not duplicate skilled
nursing facility (SNF) coverage provided by any Medigap policy,
managed care plan, or other coverage you have.<p>

     It is important to remember that custodial care (the type
of care most persons in nursing homes require) is not covered
by Medicare or most Medigap policies. The only care of this
nature that Medicare covers is skilled nursing care or skilled
rehabilitation care that is provided in a Medicare-certified
skilled nursing facility.<p>

     For more information about long-term care insurance,
request a copy of A Shopper's Guide to Long-Term Care Insurance
from either your state insurance department or the National
Association of Insurance Commissioners, 120 W. 12th Street,
Suite 1100, Kansas City, MO 64 105-1925. You may also obtain a
copy of the Guide to Choosing a Nursing Home by writing to
Medicare Publications, Health Care Financing Administration,
6325 Security Boulevard, Baltimore, MD 21207.<p>

<h4>Hospital Indemnity Insurance</h4>

     Hospital indemnity coverage is insurance that pays a fixed
cash amount for each day you are hospitalized up to a
designated number of days. Some coverage may have added
benefits such as surgical benefits or skilled nursing home
confinement benefits. Some policies have a maximum number of
days or a maximum payment amount. Generally, a hospital
indemnity policy will pay the specified daily amount regardless
of any other health insurance coverage you have, but other
group health insurance may coordinate benefits with hospital
confinement indemnity insurance sold on a group basis.<p>

<h4>Specified Disease Insurance</h4>

     Specified disease insurance, which is not available in
some states, provides benefits for only a single disease, such
as cancer, or a group of specified diseases. The value of such
coverage depends on the chance you will get the specific
disease or diseases covered. Benefits are usually limited to
payment of a fixed amount for each type of treatment. Benefits
are not designed to fill gaps in Medicare coverage.<p>

<h4>DO YOU NEED MORE INSURANCE?</h4>

     Before buying insurance to supplement Medicare, ask
yourself whether you need private health insurance in addition
to Medicare. Not everyone does.<p>

Medicaid Recipients<br>

     Low-income people who are eligible for Medicaid usually do
not need additional insurance. They also qualify for certain
health care benefits beyond those covered by Medicare, such as
long-term nursing home care. If you become eligible for
Medicaid, and you have Medigap insurance purchased on or after
November 5, 1991, you can request that the Medigap benefits and
premiums be suspended for up to two years while you are covered
by Medicaid. Should you become ineligible for Medicaid benefits
during the two years, your Medigap policy will be reinstated if
you give proper notice and begin paying premiums again. You do
not, however, have to suspend your Medigap policy, and
suspension is not always to a Medicaid recipient's advantage.
You may want to discuss your options with your state Medicaid
representatives.<p>

<h4>Qualified Medicare Beneficiary Program: Assistance for  Low-Income Elderly</h4>

     Limited financial assistance is available through Medicaid
for paying Medicare premiums, deductibles, and coinsurance
amounts for certain low-income elderly and disabled
beneficiaries. If your annual income is at or below the
national poverty level and your cash and savings are very
limited, you may qualify for state assistance in paying
Medicare's monthly premiums, deductibles and coinsurance. This
is called the "Qualified Medicare Beneficiary" (QMB) program.<p>

     To have qualified in 1993, your income could not have been
more than $601 per month for one person or $806 per month for a
couple, except in Alaska and Hawaii. In Alaska the income
limits were $745 per month for one person and $1,002 per month
for a couple. In Hawaii they were $690 per month for one person
and $925 per month for a couple. The limits for 1994 will be
announced in February 1994. Financial resources such as bank
accounts, stocks, and bonds cannot exceed $4,000 for one person
or $6,000 for a couple.<p>

     Financial assistance also is available for Medicare
beneficiaries under the "Specified Low-Income Medicare
Beneficiary" (SLMB) program. This program is for beneficiaries
whose incomes exceed the poverty level by not more than 10
percent and who meet certain resource limitations. To have
qualified for this program in 1993, your income could not have
been more than $659 a month for one person or $884 a month for
a couple, except in Alaska and Hawaii. In Alaska the income
limits were $818 per month for one person and $1,100 per month
for a couple. In Hawaii they were $758 per month for one person
and $1,016 per month for a couple. Individuals in this category
are eligible only for Medicaid payment of their Medicare Pan B
premium, which is $41.10 per month in 1994. If you think you
qualify for state assistance in paying your Medicare expenses
under either of these two programs, contact your state or local
social service agency. If you cannot find a telephone number
for the state agency, call 1-800638-6833 for assistance.<p>


<h4>Federally Qualified Health Center</h4>

     Medicare pays for some health services, including
preventive care, when provided by a federally qualified health
center (FQHC). These facilities are typically community health
centers, migrant health centers and health centers for the
homeless. They are generally located in inner-city and rural
areas. The services covered by Medicare at FQHCs include
routine physical examinations, screenings, and diagnostic tests
for the detection of vision and hearing problems and other
medical conditions, and the administration of certain vaccines
for immunization against influenza and other diseases.<p>

     When those services are furnished at a FQHC, the $100
annual Part B deductible does not apply (see page 5). However,
if other services are provided, such as X-rays or screening
mammograms, the FQHC may bill the Medicare carrier. In that
case, you would be responsible for any unmet portion of the Pan
B annual deductible of $.100. As for the 20 percent Part B
coinsurance, it is applicable for all FQHC services but Public
Health Service guidelines allow the FQHC to waive it in some
instances. Any Medicare beneficiary may seek services at an
FQHC.<p>

     To find out whether one of these centers serves your area,
call 1-800-638-6833.<p>


<h4>TIPS ON SHOPPING FOR HEALTH INSURANCE</h4>

     Shop Carefully Before You Buy. Policies differ as to
coverage and cost, and companies differ as to service. Contact
different companies and compare the premiums before you buy.<p>

     Don't Buy More Policies Than You Need. Duplicate coverage
is expensive and unnecessary. A single comprehensive policy is
better than several policies with overlapping or duplicate
coverage. Federal law prohibits issuing duplicative coverage to
Medicare beneficiaries even if both policies would pay full
benefits. The law generally prohibits the sale of a Medicare
supplement policy to a person who has Medicaid or another
health insurance policy that provides coverage for any of the
same benefits.<p>

     Similarly, the sale of any other kind of health insurance
policy is generally prohibited if it duplicates coverage you
already have. When you buy a replacement Medigap policy, the
insurer is required to obtain your written statement that you
intend to cancel the first policy after the new policy becomes
effective. If you are on Medicaid, insurers may not sell you a
Medigap policy unless the state pays the premium. Anyone who
sells you a policy in violation of these anti-duplication
provisions is subject to criminal and/or civil penalties under
federal law. Call 1-800-638-6833 to report suspected
violations.<p>

     Consider Your Alternatives. Depending on your health care
needs and finances, you may want to consider continuing the
group coverage you have at work; joining an HMO, CMP or other
managed care plan; buying a Medigap policy; or buying a
longterm care insurance policy.<p>

     Check For Preexisting Condition Exclusions. In evaluating
a policy, you should determine whether it limits or excludes
coverage for existing health conditions. Many policies do not
cover health problems that you have at the time of purchase.
Preexisting conditions are generally health problems you went
to see a physician about within the 6 months before the date
the policy went into effect.<p>

     Don't be misled by the phrase "no medical examination
required." If you have had a health problem, the insurer might
not cover you immediately for expenses connected with that
problem. Medigap policies, however, are required to cover
preexisting conditions after the policy has been in effect for
6 months.<p>

    Beware of Replacing Existing Coverage. Be careful when
buying a replacement Medigap policy. Make sure you have a good
reason for switching from one policy to another--you should
only switch for different benefits, better service, or a more
affordable price. On the other hand, don't keep inadequate
policies simply because you have had them a long time. If you
decide to replace your Medigap policy, you must be given credit
for the time spent under the old policy in determining when any
preexisting conditions restrictions apply under the new policy.
You must also sign a statement that you intend to terminate the
policy to be replaced. Do not cancel the first policy until you
are sure that you want to keep the new policy.<p>

     Prohibited Marketing Practices. It is unlawful for a
company or agent to use high pressure tactics to force or
frighten you into buying a Medigap policy, or to make
fraudulent or misleading comparisons to get you to switch from
one company or policy to another. Deceptive "cold lead"
advertising also is prohibited. This lactic involves mailings
to identify individuals who might be interested in buying
insurance. If you fill in and return the card enclosed in the
mailing, the card may be sold to an insurance
agent who will try to sell you a policy.<p>

     Be Aware of Maximum Benefits. Most policies have some type
of limit on benefits. They may restrict either the dollar
amount that will be paid for treatment of a condition or the
number of days of care for which payment will be made. Some
insurance policies (but not Medigap policies) pay less than the
Medicare-approved amounts for hospital outpatient medical
services and for services provided in a doctor's office. Others
do not pay anything toward the cost of those services.<p>

     Check Your Right to Renew. States now require that Medigap
policies be guaranteed renewable. This means that the company
can refuse to renew your policy only if you do not pay the
premiums or you made material misrepresentations on the
application. Beware of older policies that let the company
refuse to renew on an individual basis. These policies provide
the least permanent coverage.<p>

     Even though your policy may be guaranteed renewable. the
company may adjust the premiums from time to time. Some
policies have premiums which increase as you grow older.<p>

     Be A ware That Policies to Supplement Medicare Are Neither
Sold Nor Serviced by the State or Federal Governments. State
insurance departments approve policies sold by insurance
companies but approval only means the company and policy meet
requirements of state law. Do not believe statements that
insurance to supplement Medicare is a government-sponsored
program.<p>

     If anyone tells you that they are from the government and
later tries to sell you an insurance policy, report that person
to your state insurance department or federal authorities. This
type of misrepresentation is a violation of federal and state
law. It is also unlawful for a company or agent to claim that a
policy has been approved for sale in any state in which it has
not received state approval, or to use fraudulent means to gain
approval.<p>

     Know With Whom You're Dealing. A company must meet certain
qualifications to do business in your state. You should check
with your state insurance department to make sure that any
company you are considering is licensed in your state. This is
for your protection. Agents also must be licensed by your state
and may be required by the state to carry proof of licensure
showing their name and the company they represent. If the agent
cannot verify that he or she is licensed, do not buy from that
person. A business card is not a license.<p>

     Keep Agents' and/or Companies' Names, Addresses and
Telephone Numbers. Write down the agents' and/or companies'
names, addresses and telephone numbers or ask for a business
card that provides all that information.<p>

     Take Your Time. Do not be pressured into buying a policy.
Principled salespeople will not rush you. If you are not
certain whether a program is worthy, ask the salesperson to
explain it to a friend. Keep in mind, however, that there is a
limited time period in which new Medicare Part B enrollees can
buy the Medigap policy of their choice without conditions being
imposed (see page 11). Once this open enrollment period
elapses, you may be limited as to the Medigap policies
available to you, especially if you have a preexisting health
condition.<p>

     If You Decide To Buy, Complete the Application Carefully.
Do not believe an insurance agent who tells you that your
medical history on an application is not important. Some
companies ask for detailed medical information. If you leave
out any of the medical information requested, coverage could be
refused for a period of time for any medical condition you
neglected to mention. The company also could deny a claim for
treatment of an undisclosed condition and/or cancel your policy.<p>

    Look For an Outline of Coverage. You must be given a
clearly worded summary of the policy... READ IT CAREFULLY.<p>

     Do Not Pay Cash. Pay by check, money order or bank draft
made payable to the insurance company, not to the agent or
anyone else. Get a receipt with the insurance company's name,
address and telephone number for your records.<p>

     Policy Delivery or Refunds Should be Prompt. The insurance
company should deliver a policy within 30 days. If it does not,
contact the company and obtain in writing the reason for the
delay. If 60 days go by without a response, contact your state
insurance department.<p>

     Use the "Free-Look" Provision. Insurance companies must
give you at least 30 days to review a Medigap policy. If you
decide you don't want the policy, send it back to the agent or
company within 30 days of receiving it and ask for a refund of
all premiums you paid. Contact your state insurance department
if you have a problem getting a refund.<p>

For Your Protection<br>
     As noted above, federal criminal and civil penalties can
be imposed against anyone who sells you a policy that
duplicates coverage you already have unless you sign a
statement declaring that the first policy will be cancelled, or
unless you have Medicaid and the state Medicaid agency pays the
premium for your Medigap policy. Penalties may also be imposed
for claiming that a policy meets legal standards for federal
certification when it does not, and for using the mail for the
delivery of advertisements offering for sale a Medigap policy
in a state in which it has not received state approval.<p>

     Additionally, it is illegal under federal law for an
individual or company to misuse the names, letters, symbols or
emblems of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,
the Social Security Administration, or the Health Care
Financing Administration. It also is illegal to use the names.
letters, symbols or emblems of their various programs.<p>

     This law is aimed primarily at mass marketers who use this
information on mail solicitations to either imply or claim that
the product they are selling whether it be insurance or
something else--has either been endorsed or is being sold by
the U.S. government. The advertising literature used by these
organizations is often designed to look like it came from a
government agency.<p>

     If you believe you have been the victim of any unlawful
sales practices, contact your state insurance department
immediately. If you believe that federal law has been violated,
you may call 1-800-638-6833. In most cases, however, your state
insurance department can offer the most assistance in resolving
insurance related problems.<p>

<ol>
<li> a "basic" benefit with $250 annual deductible, 50%
     coinsurance and a $1,250 maximum annual benefit (Plans H
     and I above), and

<li> an "extended" benefit (Plan J above) containing a $250
     annual deductible, 50% coinsurance and a $3,000 maximum
     annual benefit.</ol>

     Each of the 10 plans has a letter designation ranging from
"A" through "J". Insurance companies are not permitted to
change these designations or to substitute other names or
titles. They may, however, add names or titles to these letter
designations. While companies are not required to offer all of
the plans, they all must make Plan A available if they sell any
of the other 9 in a state.<p>

<p>Urinary tract infections are a serious health problem affecting millions of people each year.</p>
<p>The urinary tract is a vital, finely balanced system whose task is to extract and dispose of the body's liquid wastes. Infections of 
the urinary tract are among the most common in the human body--so common that only respiratory infections occur more often. 
Each year, patients with symptoms of a urinary tract infection (UTI) account for 5 million visits to a doctor's office. Among 
women, UTI's are especially troublesome; it is estimated that up to 20 percent of women develop a UTI sometime in their lives.</p>
<p>The urinary system, made up of the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra, eliminates liquid waste products and helps maintain a 
stable balance of salts and other dissolved substances in the blood. The key players in the system are the kidneys, a pair of 
purplish-brown organs located below the ribs toward the middle of the back. These highly complex organs remove liquid waste 
material from the bloodstream in the form of urine and produce a hormone that regulates the formation of red blood cells. Two 
narrow tubes called ureters carry urine from the kidneys to the bladder, a triangle-shaped chamber in the lower abdomen. Urine 
is stored in the bladder and emptied through another passageway, the urethra.</p>
<p>The average adult passes about 1,500 milliliters (about a quart and a half) of urine each day. The amount of urine varies, 
depending on the amount and type of food and fluids consumed. The volume formed at night is about half as much as that formed 
in the daytime.</p>
<h4>Causes</h4>
<p>Normal urine is sterile. It contains fluids, salts, and waste products, but it is free of microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, or 
fungi. An infection occurs when microorganisms, usually bacteria from the digestive tract, adhere to the opening of the urethra 
and begin to multiply. Most infections can be traced to one type of colon bacteria, called Escherichia coli.</p>
<p>Recently, microorganisms called Chlamydia and Mycoplasma have been found to cause urinary tract infections in both men and 
women, but these tend to remain limited to the urethra and genital system. Unlike the majority of UTI' s, infections caused by 
these two microbes are sexually transmitted, are not detected by standard culturing methods, and require treatment of both 
sexual partners.</p>
<p>As they reproduce, bacteria colonize the urethra. An infection that is limited to the urethra is called urethritis. Often the bacteria 
migrate from the urethra to the bladder, causing cystitis (a bladder infection). It is important to treat the infection promptly, before 
bacteria that invade the lower urinary tract have a chance to travel upward, causing a kidney infection (pyelonephritis) and 
possibly kidney damage.</p>
<p>The urinary system is structured in a way that helps guard against infection. For instance, the ureters normally prevent the backup 
of urine toward the kidneys, and the flow of urine from the bladder helps wash harmful bacteria out of the body. In men, the 
prostate gland produces secretions that kill or inhibit infection-causing bacteria. In both sexes, various immune defenses also play 
a role in keeping infection at bay. Despite these and other safeguards, infections still occur. Scientists are not sure why women 
have more urinary infections than men.</p>
<h4>Risk Factors</h4>
<p>Some people are more prone to getting a urinary infection than others. Any abnormality of the urinary tract that obstructs or 
slows the flow of urine makes it easier for bacteria to grow. When the urine does not empty freely, it may stagnate in the bladder. 
A stone in the kidney or any part of the urinary tract can form such a blockage, creating the conditions for a UTI. In men, an 
enlarged prostate gland can obstruct urine flow and make infection difficult to treat.</p>
<p>One of the most common sources of infection is catheters, or tubes, placed in the bladder. Patients who cannot void, are 
unconscious, or critically ill, often need a catheter that remains in place for a period of time. Because of the risk that bacteria 
inhabiting the catheter can enter and infect the bladder, hospital staff take special care to prevent the catheter from becoming 
contaminated. Also, physicians try to remove the catheter as soon as possible. Some patients, especially the elderly or those with 
diseases of the nervous system who lose bladder control, may need a catheter for life.</p>
<p>People who have diabetes mellitus have a higher risk of a UTI because of changes of the immune system. Any disorder that 
involves suppression of the immune system sets the stage for urinary infection.</p>
<p>UTI's occur in a small percentage of infants due to congenital abnormalities that sometimes require surgery. They are rarely seen 
in boys and young men, but the rate of UTI's in females gradually increases as they age. Scientists are not sure why women have 
more urinary infections than men. One factor may be that in women the urethra is short, allowing easy migration of bacteria to the 
bladder. Also, a woman's urethral opening is near sources of bacteria from the anus and vagina. For many women, sexual 
intercourse seems to precipitate an infection. The reasons for this association are unclear, but some doctors think that, in women 
predisposed to vaginal colonization of bacteria, intercourse may propel bacteria in to the urethra.</p>
<p>Yet another factor is the method of birth control: according to several studies, women who use the diaphragm are more likely to 
develop a UTI than women who use other forms of contraception.</p>
<p>UTI's are a recurrent problem for many women, also for reasons that are poorly understood. In the vast majority of cases, the 
new infection stems from a strain or type of bacteria that is different from the infection that preceded it. (Even when several 
infections in a row are traced to E. coli, there are usually slight differences in the bacteria, indicating that each infection was 
caused by a distinct strain.)</p>
<p>Researchers at Tulane University in New Orleans, supported by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney 
Diseases, suggest that one factor behind recurrent UTI's may be the ability of bacteria to adhere to the mucous tissue of the 
urinary tract. Another may be that local immune responses in some women are less effective in preventing the growth of bacteria.</p>
<p>Pregnant women seem no more susceptible to UTI's than nonpregnant women. However, when an infection does occur, it may 
be more serious because it is more likely to travel to the kidneys. According to some reports, about 2 to 4 percent of pregnant 
women develop a urinary tract infection. Scientists think that hormonal changes and shifts in the positioning of the urinary tract 
during pregnancy make it easier for bacteria to travel up the ureters to the kidneys. For this reason, many doctors recommend 
periodic testing of the urine. A pregnant woman who develops a UTI should be treated promptly to avoid premature delivery of 
her baby and other risks such as high blood pressure and toxemia. In selecting an antibacterial drug, the physician considers both 
its effectiveness and toxic effects to the fetus.</p>
<h4>Symptoms</h4>
<p>Not everyone with a urinary tract infection has symptoms, but most people get at least some. Such symptoms include a frequent 
urge to urinate and a painful, burning feeling during urination. It is not unusual to feel bad all over--tired, shaky, washed out--and 
to feel pain even when not urinating. Often, women feel an uncomfortable pressure above the pubic bone, and some men 
experience a fullness in the rectum. It is common for a person with a urinary infection to complain that, despite the urge to urinate, 
only a small amount of urine is passed. The urine itself may appear milky or cloudy--even reddish if blood is present. A fever 
may indicate that the infection has reached the kidneys. Other symptoms of a kidney infection include pain in the back or side 
below the ribs, nausea, or vomiting.</p>
<p>In children, symptoms of urinary infection often are not noticed, or they may be attributed to some other disorder. A UTI should 
be considered when a child, or infant, seems irritable, is not eating normally, vomits, has incontinence or loose bowels, or is not 
thriving. The child should be seen by a doctor if there are any questions about these symptoms, especially when accompanied by 
increased frequency of urination.</p>
<h4>Diagnosis</h4>
<p>A urinary infection can easily be diagnosed by testing a sample of urine for the presence of pus and bacteria. A &quot;clean catch&quot; 
urine sample is obtained by washing the genital area and collecting a &quot;midstream&quot; sample of urine in a sterile container. (This 
method of collecting a urine sample helps prevent bacteria around the genital area from contaminating the urine and confusing the 
test results.) Usually, the sample is sent to a laboratory, although some doctors' offices are equipped to do the testing on site. 
First, the urine is examined for white and red blood cells and bacteria in a test called urinalysis. The bacteria then are grown in a 
culture and tested against various antibiotics to determine which drug most effectively destroys the bacteria. This step is called a 
sensitivity test.</p>
<p>Some microbes, like Chlamydia and Mycoplasma, require special bacterial cultures in order to be detected. A doctor should 
suspect one of these infections if the patient has symptoms of a UTI and has pus in the urine, but a laboratory culture fails to 
grow any bacteria. When a patient has a persistent infection-one that does not clear up with appropriate treatment and is traced 
to the same strain of bacteria--the doctor orders an intravenous pyelogram (IVP). This examination gives x-ray images of the 
bladder, kidneys, and ureters. An opaque dye visible on x-ray film is injected into a vein, and a series of x-rays are taken. The 
film shows an outline of the urinary tract, revealing even small changes in the contours of these organs that might contribute to 
infection.</p>
<p>Some doctors may also recommend an IVP for women patients who have five or more infections in a year. (As stated before, 
most recurring infections are caused by a different strain or type of bacteria.) Another test that may be useful for patients with 
recurring infections is a cystoscopy. A cystoscope is an instrument made of a hollow tube with several lenses and a light source, 
which allows the doctor to see the inside of the bladder.</p>
<h4>Treatment</h4>
<p>Urinary tract infections are treated with antibacterial drugs. The choice of drug and length of treatment depends on the patient's 
history and the urine tests that identify the offending bacteria. The sensitivity test is especially useful in helping the doctor select 
the most effective drug.</p>
<p>An uncomplicated infection in women can often be cured with 1 or 2 days of treatment.</p>
<p>Several clinical trials have shown that an uncomplicated infection in women can be cured with 1 or 2 days of treatment. 
However, many physicians prefer to have their patients take antibiotics for a longer period (e.g., 7 to 14 days) to assure that the 
infection has been cured. Single-dose treatment is not recommended for certain groups of patients, for example, those who have 
delayed treatment or have signs of bacterial invasion of tissue, patients with diabetes or structural abnormalities, or men who have 
infections in the prostate gland. Lengthier treatment is also needed by patients with infections caused by Mycoplasma or 
Chlamydia, who are usually treated with tetracycline, trimethoprim/ sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMZ), or doxycycline. A follow-up 
urinalysis helps to confirm that the urinary tract is infection free. It is important to take the full course of treatment, even after 
symptoms disappear.</p>
<p>Severely ill patients with kidney infections may be hospitalized until they are able to take fluids and needed drugs on their own. 
The consensus among physicians is that kidney infections require several weeks of antibiotic therapy. A recent clinical trial at the 
University of Washington found that 2-week therapy with TMP/SMZ was as effective as 6 weeks of treatment with the same 
drug in women with &quot;uncomplicated&quot; kidney infections. (Uncomplicated infections are those in which there is no underlying 
obstruction or nervous system disorder. In such cases, kidney infections rarely lead to kidney damage or kidney failure unless 
they go untreated.) Moreover, the research showed that 2-week TMP/SMZ treatment was more effective and better tolerated 
than either 2- or 6-week treatment with ampicillin.</p>
<p>Various drugs are available to relieve the pain of a UTI. A heating pad or a warm bath may help. Physicians have different 
opinions on the importance of drinking extra fluids, but most suggest that drinking plenty of water helps cleanse the urinary tract 
of harmful bacteria. Others feel that increasing fluid intake is unnecessary because the infection is so quickly cured by antibiotics. 
For the time being, it is best to avoid irritants like coffee, alcohol, and spicy foods. (And one of the kindest favors a smoker can 
do for his or her bladder is to quit smoking. Smoking is the most important known risk factor for bladder cancer.)</p>
<p>Women who have frequent recurrences may benefit from preventive therapy.</p>
<h4>Recurrent Infections in Women</h4>
<p>About four out of five women who have a UTI get another one within 18 months. Many women have them even more frequently. 
Women who have frequent recurrences (e.g., three or more a year) may benefit from preventive therapy. Doctors use several 
approaches to manage these patients after the most recent infection has been eradicated. One of the most common is for the 
patient to take low doses of an antibiotic daily for 6 months or longer. (If taken at bedtime, the drug remains in the bladder longer 
and may be more effective.) Another is to take a single dose of an antibiotic after sexual intercourse. Even after long-term 
treatment, however, some women continue to have recurrent infections.</p>
<p>Many doctors suggest steps that a woman can take on her own to avoid an infection:</p>
<p>* Drink plenty of water every day; (Some doctors suggest drinking cranberry juice, which in large amounts inhibits the growth of 
some bacteria by acidifying the urine.) * Don't put off urinating when you feel the need;</p>
<p>* Wipe from front to back to prevent bacteria around the anus from entering the vagina or urethra;</p>
<p>* Cleanse the genital area before sexual intercourse;</p>
<p>* Empty the bladder shortly before and after sexual intercourse; and</p>
<p>* Avoid using feminine hygiene sprays and scented douches.</p>
<h4>Complicated Infections</h4>
<p>In both sexes, curing &quot;complicated&quot; infections--those involving an obstruction of urine or disorder of the nervous system-depends 
on finding and correcting the underlying problem, sometimes with surgery. If the root cause is not treated effectively, this group of 
patients is at risk of kidney damage. Also, such infections tend to arise from a wider range of bacteria, and occasionally from 
more than one organism at a time, so choosing the best antibiotic therapy can be a more complex process.</p>
<p>As discussed earlier, UTI's are unusual in men. When they do occur, it is likely that the patient has some kind of obstruction--for 
example, a urinary stone or enlarged prostate--or recently had a medical procedure involving a catheter. The first step is to 
identify the infecting organism and the drugs to which it is sensitive. Usually, doctors recommend lengthier therapy in men than in 
women, in part to prevent infection of the prostate gland. When infection does involve the prostate (prostatitis), it is harder to 
cure' because antibacterial drugs are unable to penetrate prostatic tissue very well. For this reason, men with prostatitis often 
need long-term treatment with a carefully selected antibiotic.</p>
<h4>Research in Urinary System Disorders</h4>
<p>The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) was established by Congress in 1950 as an 
institute of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), whose mission is to improve human health through biomedical research. The 
NIH is the research arm of the Public Health Service under the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.</p>
<p>The NIDDK conducts and supports a variety of research in diseases of the kidney and urinary tract. Much of the research 
targets disorders of the lower urinary tract, including urinary tract infection, urinary obstruction, vesicoureteral reflux, prostatitis, 
urinary stones, and other urinary disorders. The knowledge gained from these studies is advancing scientific understanding of why 
UTI's develop and may lead to improved methods of diagnosing, treating, and preventing urinary infections.</p>
<p>In one such study, researchers at the University of Wisconsin have developed a vaccine, until now tested only in animals, that 
stimulates a strong immune response against bacteria entering the bladder. The scientists found that this vaginal immunization 
elicited an immune response that protected the entire lower urinary tract. The investigators are conducting further studies to 
determine the safety of this technique before their vaccine can be tested in humans.</p>
<p>Recently, the NIDDK established six new research centers around the country with the goal of reducing the major causes of 
kidney and urinary tract diseases through innovative research. The lead investigators, their institutions, and research focus are 
listed on the following pages.</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Varicose Vein Treatments -- January 1994</h2>
<p>Thousands of people every year consider getting treatment for varicose veins and spider veins. Advertisements for treating 
venous disease often tout &quot;unique,&quot; &quot;permanent,&quot; &quot;painless,&quot; or &quot;absolutely safe&quot; methods -- making it difficult to decide on the 
best treatment. If you are considering this procedure, the following information may help.</p>
<p>Remember, though, this cannot substitute for a consultation with a properly-trained physician.</p>
<h4>What are varicose veins?</h4>
<p>Veins can become enlarged with pools of blood when they fail to circulate the blood properly. These visible and bulging veins, 
called varicose veins, are often associated with symptoms such as tired, heavy, or aching limbs. In severe cases, varicose veins 
can rupture, or open sores (called &quot;ulcers&quot;) can form on the skin. Varicose veins are most common in the legs and thighs.</p>
<h4>What are spider veins?</h4>
<p>Small &quot;spider veins&quot; also can appear on the skin's surface. These may look like short, fine lines, &quot;starburst&quot; clusters, or a web-like 
maze. Spider veins are most common in the thighs, ankles, and feet. They may also appear on the face.</p>
<h4>Who gets varicose and spider veins?</h4>
<p>Varicose and spider veins can occur in men or women of any age but most frequently affect women of childbearing years and 
older. Family history of the problem and aging increase one's tendency to develop varicose and spider veins.</p>
<h4>What causes varicose and spider veins?</h4>
<p>The causes of varicose and spider veins are not entirely understood. In some instances, the absence or weakness of valves in the 
veins, which prevent the backward flow of blood away from the heart, may cause the poor circulation. In other cases, 
weaknesses in the vein walls may cause the pooling of the blood.</p>
<p>Less commonly, varicose veins are caused by such diseases as phlebitis or congenital abnormalities of the veins. Venous disease 
is generally progressive and cannot be prevented entirely. However, in some cases, wearing support hosiery and maintaining 
normal weight and regular exercise may be beneficial.</p>
<h4>Is treatment always necessary?</h4>
<p>No. Varicose and spider veins may be primarily a cosmetic problem. Severe cases of varicose veins, especially those involving 
ulcers, typically require treatment. Check with a doctor if you are uncertain.</p>
<h4>What procedures are available to treat varicose and spider veins?</h4>
<p>Varicose veins are frequently treated by eliminating the &quot;bad&quot; veins. This forces the blood to flow through the remaining healthy 
veins. Various methods can be used to eliminate the problem veins, including, most commonly, surgery or sclerotherapy. Less 
commonly, laser or electro-cautery treatments have been used to treat the smallest spider veins, especially on the face.</p>
<p>Surgery to treat varicose veins, commonly referred to as &quot;stripping,&quot; is usually done under local or partial anesthesia, such as an 
&quot;epidural.&quot; Here, the problematic veins are &quot;stripped&quot; out by passing a flexible device through the vein and removing it through an 
incision near the groin. Smaller tributaries of these veins also are stripped with this device or removed through a series of small 
incisions. Those veins that connect to the deeper veins are then tied off. This stripping method has been used since the 1950's.</p>
<p>Spider veins cannot be removed through surgery. Sometimes, they disappear when the larger varicose veins feeding the spider 
veins are removed. Remaining spider veins also can be treated with &quot;sclerotherapy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sclerotherapy&quot; uses a fine needle to inject a solution directly into the vein. This solution irritates the lining of the vein, causing it to 
swell and the blood to clot. The vein turns into scar tissue that fades from view. Some doctors treat both varicose and spider 
veins with sclerotherapy. Today, the substances most commonly used in the United States are hypertonic saline or Sotradecol 
(sodium tetradecyl sulfate). Polidocanol (aethoxyskerol) is undergoing FDA testing but has not yet been approved in the U.S. for 
sclerotherapy.</p>
<p>During sclerotherapy, after the solution is injected, the vein's surrounding tissue is generally wrapped in compression bandages 
for several days, causing the vein walls to stick together. Patients whose legs have been treated are put on walking regimens, 
which forces the blood to flow into other veins and prevents blood clots. This method and variations of it have been used since 
the 1920's. In most cases, more than one treatment session will be required.</p>
<h4>Do these procedures hurt?</h4>
<p>For all of these procedures, the amount of pain an individual feels will vary, depending on the person's general tolerance for pain, 
how extensive the treatments are, which parts of the body are treated, whether complications arise, and other factors. Because 
surgery is performed under anesthesia, you will not feel pain during the procedure. After the anesthesia wears off, you will likely 
experience pain near the incisions.</p>
<p>For sclerotherapy, the degree of pain will also depend on the size of the needle used and which solution is injected. Most people 
find hypertonic saline to be the most painful solution and experience a burning and cramping sensation for several minutes when it 
is injected. Some doctors mix a mild local anesthetic in with the saline solution to minimize the pain.</p>
<h4>What types of doctors provide treatments for varicose and spider veins?</h4>
<p>Doctors providing surgical treatment include general and vascular surgeons. Sclerotherapy is often performed by dermatologists. 
Some general, vascular, and plastic surgeons also perform sclerotherapy treatments. You may want to consult more than one 
doctor before deciding on a method of treatment. Be sure to ask doctors about their experience in performing the procedure you 
want.</p>
<p>What are the side effects of these treatments?</p>
<p>Carefully question doctors about the safety and side effects for each type of treatment. Thoroughly review any &quot;informed 
consent&quot; forms your doctor gives you explaining the risks of a procedure. For surgical removal of veins, the side effects are those 
for any surgery performed under anesthesia, including nausea, vomiting, and the risk of wound infection. Surgery also results in 
scarring where small incisions are made and may occasionally cause blood clots.</p>
<p>For sclerotherapy, the side effects can depend on the substance used for the injection. People with allergies may want to be 
cautious. For example, Sotradecol may cause allergic reactions, occasionally severe. Hypertonic saline solution is unlikely to 
cause allergic reactions. Either substance may burn the skin (if the needle is not properly inserted) or permanently mark or &quot;stain&quot; 
the skin. (These brownish marks are caused by the scattering of blood cells throughout the tissue after the vein has been injected 
and may fade over time). Occasionally, sclerotherapy can lead to blood clots.</p>
<p>Laser and electro-cautery treatments can cause scarring and changes in the color of the skin.</p>
<h4>How long do results last?</h4>
<p>Many factors will affect the rate at which treated veins recur. These include the diagnosis, the method used and its suitability for 
treating a particular condition, and the skill of the physician. Sometimes the body forms a new vein in place of the one removed 
by a surgeon. An injected vein that was not completely destroyed by sclerotherapy may reopen, or a new vein may appear in the 
same location as a previous one. Many studies have found that varicose veins are more likely to recur following sclerotherapy 
than following surgery. However, no treatment method has been scientifically established as free from recurrences. For all types 
of procedures, recurrence rates increase with time. Also, because venous disease is typically progressive, no treatment can 
prevent the appearance of new varicose or spider veins in the future.</p>
<h4>Is one treatment better than another?</h4>
<p>The method you select for treating venous disease should be based on your physician's diagnosis, the size of the veins to be 
treated, your treatment history, your age, your history of allergies, and your ability to tolerate surgery and anesthesia, among 
other factors. As noted above, small spider veins cannot be surgically removed and can only be treated with sclerotherapy. On 
the other hand, larger varicose veins may, according to many studies, be more likely to recur if treated with sclerotherapy. Be 
wary of claims touting &quot;major breakthroughs,&quot; &quot;permanent results,&quot; &quot;unique treatments,&quot; &quot;brand-new,&quot; &quot;painless,&quot; or &quot;absolutely 
safe&quot; methods. Always ask for specific documentation for claims made about particular recurrence rates or fewer health risks or 
cosmetic side effects.</p>
<h4>How expensive is the procedure?</h4>
<p>Sclerotherapy can cost anywhere from a few hundred dollars to several thousand dollars, depending on the number of injections 
and treatment sessions required and the area of the country where the procedure is performed.</p>
<p>Surgery can cost approximately $600 - $2,000 per leg for the surgeon's fee, plus charges for anesthesia and hospitalization. 
Most vein surgery can be performed on an out-patient basis. Costs can vary depending on how many veins must be removed 
and the area of the country where the procedure is performed. You may want to check to see if the procedure is covered under 
your medical insurance. Many policies do not cover costs for elective cosmetic surgery.</p>
<h4>For More Information</h4>
<p>If you need to resolve a problem with a doctor regarding treatment for varicose veins, you may want to contact your county 
medical society, state medical board, or local consumer protection agency.</p>
<p>You also may want to report any concerns about advertising claims to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Write: 
Correspondence Branch, Federal Trade Commission, Washington, DC 20580. Although the FTC does not generally intervene 
in individual disputes, the information you provide may indicate a pattern of possible law violations requiring action by the 
Commission or referral to state authorities.</p>

<h2>What You Need To Know About Periodontal (Gum) Diseases</h2>
<p>How you say it: Periodontal (pear ee oh don tal) Diseases The word 'periodontal' comes from the two Greek words that mean 
&quot;around the tooth.&quot;</p>
<h4>What are periodontal diseases?</h4>
<p>Infections of the gum and bone that hold the teeth in place. They are commonly called gum diseases.</p>
<h4>What causes these diseases? </h4>
<p>Dental plaque--a sticky mass of harmful germs. Dental scientists have found that about a half dozen of the nearly 300 germs 
found in the mouth can cause gum diseases.</p>
<h4>Can I prevent gum diseases?</h4>
<p>Yes! You can prevent them by removing dental plaque.</p>
<p>How?</p>
<p>* Brush your teeth twice a day</p>
<p>* Floss your teeth once a day</p>
<p>* Have your teeth cleaned professionally at least once a year</p>
<p>* Also once a year: have a check&#169;up by the dentist to make sure any signs of gum diseases are caught early.</p>
<h4>How can I tell if I'm removing all the plaque? </h4>
<p>Dental plaque is hard to see unless it's stained. You can stain plaque by chewing red &quot;disclosing tablets,&quot; found at grocery stores 
and drug stores, or by using a cotton swab to smear green food coloring on your teeth. The red or green color left on the teeth 
will show you where there is still plaque--and where you have to brush again to remove it. Ask your dentist or dental hygienist if 
your plaque removal techniques are o.k.</p>
<p>If plaque is not removed, you may develop gingivitis, a condition that can be the first step toward the breakdown of your gums 
and bone that hold teeth in place.</p>
<p>Poor Oral Hygiene -&gt; Plaque Build-Up -&gt;<br>
Gingivitis -&gt; Periodontitis -&gt; Possible Tooth Loss</p>
<p>Gingivitis is an infection of the gums. As a result of the infection, the gums become red, inflamed and can bleed during brushing.</p>
<p>It is a mild form of gum disease that does not include any loss of the bone and tissue that hold teeth in place. Gingivitis can usually 
be reversed with regular brushing and flossing.</p>
<p>Gingivitis is the first sign that something is wrong with your gums. If it is not treated it can progress to a more destructive type of 
gum disease called periodontitis.</p>
<p>Periodontitis is an infection of the tissues that help anchor the teeth. The infection can lead to loss of the bone that holds the tooth 
in its socket and might lead to tooth loss.</p>
<p>Since periodontitis affects more than just the gums, it is not controllable with regular brushing and flossing. Periodontitis must be 
treated by a dentist or periodontist (a dentist who specializes in treating gum diseases).</p>
<p>In its early stages, periodontitis usually does not have obvious symptoms. Pain, loosening of teeth, and abscess do not occur until 
the disease is very advanced. So it's important to visit the dentist on a regular basis so he or she can check for early signs of gum 
diseases. If gum diseases are not treated, the teeth may loosen and fall out. Will my dentist refer me to a periodontist? Your 
dentist might refer you to a periodontist if you have an advanced case of a gum disease, or if you have a milder form that is not 
responding to regular treatment.</p>
<h4>Who gets gum diseases?</h4>
<p>People usually don't show signs of advanced gum diseases until they are in their 30s or 40s. But it is not uncommon for teenagers 
to have gingivitis, the early stage of gum disease. The most common types of gum diseases develop as a result of neglect--poor 
brushing and no flossing.</p>
<h4>Special Cases</h4>
<p>Teenagers can develop a very severe form of gum disease called juvenile periodontitis. Scientists think this rare but aggressive 
type of gum disease might be inherited. Pregnancy, diabetes and other medical conditions also may trigger gum diseases. 
Smoking can make you prone to gum diseases. In fact, one study showed that smokers are five times more likely than 
nonsmokers to have gum diseases.</p>
<h4>Diagnosis</h4>
<p>Three ways a dentist can tell if you have periodontitis:</p>
<p>* By looking at the gums to see if they are red, swollen, and inflamed and by checking for tartar--hardened plaque---beneath the 
gumline. The dentist also will check for gum recession.</p>
<p>* By using an instrument called a probe to see if the gums bleed when they are probed and by checking for and measuring the 
periodontal pockets--spaces that form when unhealthy gums pull away from teeth. Usually, there is a space of 1&#169;3mm between 
healthy gums and teeth. Deeper pockets may signal advanced disease.</p>
<p>* By taking mouth x-rays to check for any loss of the bone that helps anchor teeth, another sign of periodontitis.</p>
<p>The dentits uses the probe to measure the periodontal pocket. Most people find probing only midly uncomfortable.</p>
<h4>Treatment</h4>
<p>How are gum diseases treated?</p>
<p>By controlling the infection.</p>
<p>To control the infection...</p>
<p>* the dentist or hygienist removes the plaque that contains harmful germs</p>
<h4>How?</h4>
<p>By scaling and root planing</p>
<p>These are deep-cleaning procedures that get rid of the plaque.</p>
<p>Scaling means scraping off the tartar from above and beneath the gumline. Planing the tooth root until it is smooth gets rid of 
rough spots where. germs gather and allows the gums to heal closer to the teeth.</p>
<h4>Scaling &amp; Planing</h4>
<p>* Your dentist might also prescribe a special anti&#169;germ mouthrinse containing a chemical called chlorhexidine. These are the only 
mouthrinses approved for treating periodontitis.</p>
<p>* Sometimes, the dentist will prescribe an antibiotic that will help kill the germs that are causing periodontitis.</p>
<p>After the dentist scales and planes your teeth, you must brush and floss at home to keep the plaque from returning. You also will 
have to have a checkup with the dentist to see if the treatment has helped. Scaling and planing may need to be repeated every 
three to four months.</p>
<h4>What About Gum Surgery? </h4>
<p>Surgery might be necessary if: 1) scaling and planing do not bring the gum disease under control, or 2) the gum disease is very 
advanced and includes bone loss around the teeth.</p>
<h4>Flap Surgery</h4>
<p>A local anesthetic is given so the patient will not feel any pain or discomfort. Flap surgery involves lifting back the gums, removing 
the tartar, and then sewing the gums back in place.</p>
<h4>Can baking soda help periodontitis? </h4>
<p>Although baking soda and most toothpastes can be used to remove dental plaque, there is no evidence that they can stop or 
reverse tissue and bone loss caused by periodontitis.</p>
<h4>I've heard a lot about lasers recently. How do they work and can they be used to treat periodontal diseases?</h4>
<p>Simply put, a surgical laser works by emitting a concentrated beam of light strong enough to cut through tissue. Lasers can be 
used on soft tissue for certain surgical procedures related to the treatment of periodontal diseases. At this time, through, the Food 
and Drug Administration has not approved lasers for use on hard tissue--teeth and bone.</p>
<p>Research is under way to see if lasers can be used on teeth and bone.</p>
<p>Remember:</p>
<p>Prevent gum diseases by . . .</p>
<p>Flossing, Brushing, Having regular dental cleanings and check-ups</p>
<h4>Diagnosis</h4>
<h4>On The Horizon:</h4>
<h4>New X-Ray Technology</h4>
<p>* Computer-linked probes. A computer attached to the probe regulates the probing pressure so it is always the same. The 
computer also can compare the results of the current test to the previous one, since it stores measurements from each reading.</p>
<p>* Temperature probe. Detects temperature of the periodontal pockets to 1/100th of a degree centigrade. The hotter the site, the 
more likely there is gum disease. * New X-ray technology:</p>
<p>* Taking x-rays. Taking x-rays with an instrument similar to that found in a home video camera uses much less radiation than 
does the standard x-ray.</p>
<p>* Reading x-rays. The computer can compare two x-rays and highlight even the smallest changes in bone surrounding the teeth. 
Using the computer allows dentists to see details that would not be visible on a regular x-ray.</p>
<p>* Determining which germ is causing the infection. Knowing what type of bacterium is causing the infection could help determine 
the best treatment. Some bacteria can be removed by scraping plaque off the teeth, a process known as scaling. Others are 
harder to get rid of and may require an antibiotic--a medicine that can kill germs.</p>
<p>* Quick test for identifying active gum disease. The dentist takes a sample of fluid leaked from the gums that is found at the base 
of the teeth. It is analyzed for substances associated with active tissue and bone destruction.</p>
<h4>Treatment</h4>
<p>On The Horizon:</p>
<p>* Slow-release: antibiotics placed directly: into periodontal pockets. Tiny fibers or gels containing antibiotics are put into the 
pockets next to the tooth root where the medication seeps onto the affected area.</p>
<p>* Barrier membranes. During flap surgery, the dentist inserts these small, mesh-like pieces of fabric between the gum flap and the 
affected teeth. The mesh helps the soft tissue and bone grow back in place. A second surgery is needed to remove the mesh. 
The newest mesh will be able to break down and be absorbed by the body, eliminating the need for the second surgical 
procedure.</p>
<h4>Barrier Membrane</h4>
<p>* High-powered ultrasonic cleaning. A cleaning instrument that uses high-frequency sound waves is useful in breaking up tartar 
and removing plaque.</p>
<h4>Ultra Cleaning Instrument</h4>
<p>* Chemically modified antibiotics. These drugs lack the antibiotic property but have the ability to inhibit tissue destruction. They 
should help stop gum disease and should be safe for long-term use, without causing bacterial resistance.</p>
<p>* Low-Dose antibiotics. Researchers have found that low doses of doxycycline can slow the destruction of tissue and bone. At 
low doses, the drug doesn't seem to encourage the development of antibiotic-resistant germs.</p>
<p>* NSAIDs--Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs. These aspirin-like medicines have been shown to slow bone loss in 
patients with periodontitis. Researchers are testing these medications.</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Art Fraud -- April 1994</h2>
<p>Every year, American consumers lose hundreds of millions of dollars purchasing supposedly valuable commodities that do not 
live up to their billing. You should be aware that counterfeit art prints are included in these items.</p>
<p>Among the most frequently counterfeited prints are ones purportedly done by famous artists such as Salvador Dali, Pablo 
Picasso, Marc Chagall, and Joan Miro. Consumers from all walks of life are targeted in these scams. Recent FTC cases indicate 
that those buying counterfeit art work include doctors, farmers, stockbrokers, housewives, and even other artists.</p>
<p>If you are taken in by a false art sales pitch, what you get is often much less than promised. After paying anywhere from $500 to 
$10,000 or more, you may get art work valued at no more than $50 _ the equivalent of a poster you might buy at a museum.</p>
<p>Many of these bogus pieces are copies of images created by well-known artists, which are produced without the artist's 
knowledge or authorization and carry a forged signature of the artist's name. Others are counterfeit art pieces produced in the 
style of well-known artists. In still other instances, the art work is authentic but its value and investment potential are far less than 
what you are led to believe. </p>
<h4>How the Scam Works</h4>
<p>The scenario for trapping consumers into paying inflated prices for counterfeit art works varies. One common tactic is to send 
you a letter describing a contest or drawing giving away a free original lithograph by a famous artist. You are asked to return the 
postcard with your name, address, and phone number. Your post card probably will trigger a telephone call from the scam 
operator, who tries to convince you to buy a valuable work of art. The caller may claim to be offering a &quot;fabulous opportunity&quot; to 
obtain a limited-edition print that will be an &quot;excellent investment.&quot; You may be told that a famous artist is near death and that you 
should buy now, since the value of the art work will increase after the artist's death. You will likely be offered a &quot;certificate of 
authenticity&quot; attesting to the genuineness of the work. And, often you are promised a trial examination period with a 30-day 
money-back guarantee. There are as many variations to this basic sales pitch as there are con artists.</p>
<p>Fake art prints are not just sold over the telephone. They also may be sold at seemingly reputable art galleries in your own 
community. You may find authentic works by contemporary artists hanging side by side with fake Dalis and Chagalls. Sometimes 
the dealer will pitch the print as an investment opportunity. The dealer also may downplay the investment angle and try to sell the 
print as a valuable collectible.</p>
<h4>How To Protect Yourself</h4>
<p>Although there is no foolproof way to protect yourself if you decide to invest in art, the following suggestions may be helpful.</p>
<p>Get professional advice. Counterfeit prints are often so well produced that few laypersons can tell the real thing from a fake. 
Therefore, it is very important to consult a reputable expert, such as an art appraiser or museum curator, before finalizing the 
purchase of any artwork attributed to a well-known artist. Ask the seller for specific information about the piece, including the 
edition size, the print medium (such as lithograph, etching, silkscreen, or woodcut), the year of publication, and the 
printer/publisher -- all of which will help an expert evaluate the work. Some states have disclosure laws that require the dealer to 
give you such information. These include Arkansas, California, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New 
York, Oregon, South Carolina, and Wisconsin.</p>
<p>Tell the dealer you want the sale to be conditioned on an appraisal of the piece by an expert of your choice. Make sure that you 
have the right to get your money back in case the work is found to be a fake. Be sure to read the fine print. Some sales invoices 
only give you the right to exchange your print for another and do not provide a money-back guarantee.</p>
<p>Be extremely careful about buying art work over the telephone. It is very difficult for consumers to gauge the value and 
authenticity of a work of art or the credentials of an art firm by telephone. You may want to check with your local or state 
consumer protection agencies, the Better Business Bureau, or your state Attorney General to determine whether complaints have 
been lodged against the company contacting you. Be aware, however, that many fraudulent telemarketing companies frequently 
change their names, so there may be no complaints registered against them.</p>
<p>Be skeptical of authenticity claims. Art dealers often provide &quot;certificates of authenticity&quot; or written appraisals with the prints they 
sell to support their claims of authenticity. You should be wary of any art dealer who refuses to put his authenticity claims in 
writing. Keep in mind, however, that such documents are only as reliable as the firm that backs them. Don't be taken in by 
dealers who refer you to &quot;art appraisers&quot; who are on the dealer's payroll.</p>
<p>Be suspicious of promises of great investment returns and high-pressure sales tactics. Fraudulent offers often revolve around the 
idea that, unless you act now, you will be passing up a terrific investment opportunity. But remember -- no offer is so good that it 
cannot wait for a cool professional examination. Ask yourself: if this offer is so good, why is a total stranger making the effort to 
sell me this investment?</p>
<p>Do not give out your credit card number over the phone or by mail. Without your credit card number, salespeople have minimal 
access to your money. They may say they need your card number for &quot;verification purposes&quot; and not for payment. Be careful. 
You risk big losses when you give your credit or charge card numbers or other personal information (such as bank account 
numbers) to unfamiliar salespeople who make unsolicited calls.</p>
<h4>What to Do If You Have Problems</h4>
<p>If you buy a work of art and discover that it is a fake, first try to resolve your dispute with the company that sold you the piece. If 
you are not satisfied, contact your local consumer protection agency, Better Business Bureau, or state Attorney General to 
report the company. You also can contact the National Fraud Information Center at 1- 800-876-7060 (9:00 am - 5:30 pm, 
EST, Monday - Friday).</p>
<p>The Center will forward your complaint to the Federal Trade Commission, Washington, D.C. 20580. Although the FTC 
generally does not intervene in individual disputes, the information you provide may help establish a pattern of law violations by a 
company that could result in legal action by the FTC.</p>

Commission, Washington, DC 20580; 202- 326-2222. Ask for a free copy of Best Sellers.</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Canadian Gemstone Scams -- June 1993</h2>
<p>Before you invest in gemstones that are sold by Canadian telemarketing firms, you may want to think twice. The Federal Trade 
Commission (FTC), Jewellers Vigilance Canada Inc., and the National Fraud Information Center report a sharp increase in the 
number of consumer complaints regarding the practices of some telemarketing firms located in Canada. The FTC estimates that 
consumers could be losing tens of millions of dollars annually to these firms.</p>
<p>This brochure describes the deceptive sales practices used by the Canadian telemarketing firms that have been the source of 
most of the consumer complaints. It also lists resources you can use to direct any inquiries or complaints.</p>
<h4>Watch Out for Deceptive Sales Tactics</h4>
<p>The suspect Canadian companies often use high pressure tactics to sell gemstones. A salesperson may claim that you will realize 
big profits with little risk. You also may be told that the stones can be bought at or near their wholesale price, and that, once 
purchased, they easily can be liquidated through the company's own &quot;rebrokerage&quot; services.</p>
<p>The gemstones usually are accompanied by seemingly bona fide grading certificates or appraisals, which make the gemstones 
seem more valuable than they really are. If the gemstones are sealed in plastic, you may be told that if the seal is broken, their 
resale value cannot be guaranteed. This ploy makes it difficult to examine the stones and determine their quality and their value.</p>
<p>If you buy gemstones over the telephone, you later may receive a second call. This time, a salesperson may try to convince you 
that buying more stones will make your &quot;gemstone portfolio&quot; more attractive for sale to outside &quot;investors&quot; or at alleged auctions.</p>
<p>A salesperson also may call with the promise of a buyer for your stones. Before a buyer can be introduced, however, you may 
have to pay money upfront. The money is needed, you are told, to cover a finder's fee, commission, examination fee, or 
&quot;required&quot; duties or taxes. As part of the deal, you may have to buy additional stones before you can sell any. After sending your 
money, you may receive stones of questionable value, but no word of a buyer. Whatever the approach, consumers inevitably end 
up with gemstones worth only a small fraction of what they paid. In addition, the promises of easy resale, outside buyers, and 
upcoming auctions have all proven false. Consumers who believe these promises can expect to lose all their investment money.</p>
<h4>Use Extreme Caution</h4>
<p>Few consumers profit from investing in gemstones. In fact, FTC investigations have found that most consumers lose a large 
percentage of the money they invest. The chances of recovering losses are even less for U.S. consumers dealing with foreign 
companies, such as those in Canada.</p>
<p>If a company calls you offering to buy or sell gemstones, watch out. You may well lose every dollar you invest.</p>
<h4>For More Information</h4>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Dirt-Pile Scams: Mining for Gold -- December 1993</h2>
<p>Among the endless number of telephone investment frauds going on around the country, one variety is called the &quot;dirt-pile scam.&quot; 
With this, a caller offers you the opportunity to invest in a gold mining operation. What you would buy is a quantity of 
unprocessed dirt from the mine, &quot;guaranteed&quot; to contain enough gold to more than cover your investment. In reality, the mine 
contains little if any gold, and your investment is nearly worthless.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, consumers from all walks of life have invested in these dirt-pile scams and were cheated out of millions of dollars. 
This fact sheet tells you how to recognize the scam, how to protect yourself, and what to do if you become a victim.</p>
<h4>How Dirt-Pile Scams Work</h4>
<p>Although there are many versions of this scheme, most dirt-pile scams have similar features. Typically, a promoter will either 
lease or buy a mining claim (a tract of land that legally can be mined) in one state and then set up &quot;boiler room&quot; sales operations 
in several other states.</p>
<p>The mining claim, company headquarters, and boiler rooms are purposely located in different states to make it more difficult for 
law-enforcement officials to locate and investigate the company's activities.</p>
<p>Usually, a boiler room is a rented space filled with desks and telephones, where experienced salespeople call hundreds of 
potential investors like you. These callers use high pressure tactics to sell you unprocessed dirt, also called &quot;ore.&quot; Preying on most 
people's limited knowledge of &quot;ore,&quot; they make false and exaggerated claims about the precious-metal content.</p>
<p>A central feature of the dirt-pile scam is that you will be asked to invest several thousand dollars upfront, but will not be entitled 
to a return on your investment for at least one to three years. This gives the promoters time to get money from many investors, 
before anyone suspects foul play.</p>
<p>There are a number of twists to this scam. In one variation, you buy the ore from the mining claim for one fee, then, for a second 
fee, you buy the services of an &quot;independent&quot; mining contractor who will process the ore and extract the precious metal. You will 
not be told, of course, that the contractor is also part of the scam.</p>
<p>In another variation, you pay one fee for both mining and refining the ore. Some investment schemes allow you to make monthly 
installment payments to the mining company. The sales pitch may change slightly, but the basic message is the same--pay now 
and receive a substantial return later.</p>
<p>If you express interest in investing, the salesperson will follow up the phone call with a prospectus or a company publication. It 
often is a slick-looking brochure, which promoters hope will increase the credibility of their offering. The brochure may contain 
photographs of the mining site with mining equipment on it, a map of the area, pictures and resumes of company officials, and 
references for you to call.</p>
<p>The brochure also may include a report from an assayist, one who analyzes a sample of dirt from the mining claim to determine 
the precious-metal content. Often the report will be from either a fraudulent assayist who inflates the amount of precious metal 
found in the ore, or from a legitimate assayist who is given a &quot;salted&quot; sample, one that contains added amounts of the precious 
metal. The packet may include a contract for you to sign and return, locking you into the investment.</p>
<p>If the caller senses any reluctance, you may be offered a &quot;risk-free&quot; investment to clinch the deal. Your investment will be 
&quot;guaranteed&quot; to contain a minimum quantity of precious metal per ton of ore, and, if your claim does not produce the specified 
amount of precious metal, the company will refine additional ore to satisfy the terms of the guarantee. Some companies or 
salespersons even will promise to make up the difference out of their own pocket.</p>
<p>Once you have invested money in a dirt-pile scam, you may receive periodic progress reports or &quot;lull letters.&quot; Their purpose is to 
keep you up-to-date on the fictitious progress of the mining operation and to keep you content with your investment.</p>
<p>Because the mines often are not located in the state where you live, it is unlikely that you will visit the mine. If you do visit, you 
may recognize the worthless value of your investment and demand a refund. Promoters may willingly refund your money, 
possibly with newly invested money, in order to avoid complaints to law-enforcement officials. In some cases, promoters actually 
haul equipment out to the mining site and hire temporary employees to make it look as if work is in progress.</p>
<p>Finally, when it is time for a return on your investment, if the promoters are still around, they will conveniently blame faulty 
equipment, bad weather, a labor shortage, or even the Government for any delay. They will assure you that they will resolve all 
problems quickly. Since you have already put considerable time and money into this investment, you may be satisfied to wait for 
a while. In the meantime, the promoters try to get more money from new customers or to get safely out of town.</p>
<p>No matter how these scams unfold, they always end the same way: You are left with nothing--no capital and no profit.</p>
<h4>How To Protect Yourself</h4>
<p>The typical dirt-pile scam involves a highly sophisticated interstate network of swindlers. By the time you suspect the investment 
may be phony, it could be difficult to locate the promoter, the project manager, the salespeople, or anyone else connected with 
the company. Because the crux of the scam requires you to wait at least a year to realize a return on your investment, promoters 
are often long gone by the time law-enforcement officials are alerted to the scheme and can begin an investigation.</p>
<p>The best protection you have is not to invest in a dirt-pile scam in the first place. The following suggestions may help you avoid 
losing money in a dirt-pile scam:</p>
<p>Be wary of unsolicited investment opportunities.</p>
<p>If this is such a great investment, why isn't the company getting traditional financing from a bank instead of from you, a total 
stranger?</p>
<p>Be suspicious of guaranteed, high-return, risk-free investments in precious metals.</p>
<p>The market for gold and other precious metals is unstable; be wary of any exaggerated claims. Few legitimate companies can 
afford to substantially undercut the market price for precious metals.</p>
<p>Be skeptical of extraordinary claims, such as &quot;secret formulas&quot; for extracting otherwise unrecoverable precious metals from dirt.</p>
<p>Ask yourself, why am I hearing about this for the first time over the telephone?</p>
<p>Don't let telephone salespeople convince you to invest on the spot.</p>
<p>A person selling a legitimate investment opportunity will allow you to take some time to look over the company literature and to 
check out the credibility of the claims with someone whose financial advice you respect.</p>
<p>Don't be taken in by slick brochures and reports by so-called experts.</p>
<p>The claims made in the brochure are only as good as the company that makes them.</p>
<p>Don't be impressed by statements that the mining claim is on land managed by the Bureau of Land Management or the Forest 
Service.</p>
<p>It is relatively simple to file a claim on federally managed land, but that does not mean the land is worth mining.</p>
<p>Check out all the claims made in the sales call and in the written materials.</p>
<p>Call the state Bureau of Mines in the state where the mine is located to get general information about the mineral content in the 
area to be mined. Get an independent, credentialed geologist to inspect the written materials. Call the state securities office in 
your state or in the state where the mine is located. They can tell you if the promoter has violated state securities laws in the past.</p>
<p>When in doubt, say no.</p>
<p>If you are not completely confident that you are investing in a legitimate offer, do not take a chance. Once a swindler has your 
money, it is very hard to recover it.</p>
<h4>What To Do If You Are A Victim Of A Dirt-Pile Scam</h4>
<p>If you thought you were investing in a legitimate mining operation and it turned out to be a dirt-pile scam, speak up. First, try to 
contact the mining company and attempt to get your money back. If you are not successful, report your problem to the state 
securities agency, state mining agency, Better Business Bureau, and Attorney General's office in your state and in the state where 
the mine is located. If law enforcement agencies are already looking into the company, your information will help in an 
investigation. If they do not know about the problem, your information may alert them to the need for one.</p>
<p>You also may contact the Federal Trade Commission. Write: Correspondence Branch, Federal Trade Commission, Washington, 
D.C. 20580. Although the FTC generally does not intervene in individual disputes, the information you provide may indicate a 
pattern of possible law violations requiring action by the Commission.</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Investing in Indium and Other &quot;Strategic Metals&quot;</h2>
<p>What is indium? You may learn the hard way if someone calls and says, &quot;This metal is the hottest investment today. Invest 
immediately!&quot;</p>
<p>If you do invest, you may join a growing number who have lost thousands of dollars to telemarketing firms that sell &quot;strategic 
metals,&quot; such as indium, germanium, selenium, or cadmium. Many of these firms are located in Canada. The telemarketers have 
sold the metals at prices that far exceed their worth.</p>
<p>This brochure explains the sales tactics of the fraudulent telemarketing firms and how to protect yourself from them. It also lists 
resources you can use for inquiries or complaints.</p>
<h4>Part I: &quot;Buy Now!&quot;</h4>
<p>The scam unfolds like this. A telemarketer calls offering you indium as an investment that promises little risk and high returns. If 
you're reluctant to buy, the telemarketer may send you an impressive-looking brochure or even a video cassette that exaggerates 
indium's worth.</p>
<p>Indium is a byproduct of zinc. It's used in digital screens (on watches and computers), architectural glass, and fire sprinklers. 
Because indium also is used by the defense industry, it sometimes is called a &quot;strategic metal.&quot;</p>
<p>The term &quot;strategic metal&quot; may be confusing to the average investor. It may sound glamorous, and the fraudulent telemarketer 
may capture your attention by talking about new high-tech applications for indium.</p>
<p>These telemarketers may claim that the demand for indium is growing while the supply is dwindling. They may explain that the 
U.S. imports most of its indium and that the overseas producers are threatened by political or economic problems.</p>
<p>These claims are false. There is no shortage of indium, and there are no forces that are driving up the price. Foreign suppliers of 
indium include countries like France, Italy, and Canada. Indium currently is selling for about $5 per ounce, but telemarketers 
have sold it for $80 or more for that amount. Worse yet, it's unlikely investors could ever resell their indium at any price.</p>
<p>First, indium is an industrial-use metal, not an investment metal. It is not traded like a commodity or stock. Second, even if you 
found a company that uses indium, it probably would not be interested in buying your small supply. Because you would not be 
able to guarantee the quality of your indium, a company probably would not want to pay to do their own analysis.</p>
<h4>Part II: &quot;Buy More!&quot;</h4>
<p>If you buy some indium, your name may be traded on what is called a &quot;sucker's list.&quot; The telemarketing firm that sold you the 
indium -- or a different one -- will call to give you updates on indium's latest selling price. Of course, each update will show a 
higher selling price. Because you believe the price of indium is rising, you may not suspect any problems with your investment. 
Most likely, one or more companies will try to pressure you into buying more indium to close a deal with an alleged buyer of 
your supply. For example, if you have 300 ounces of indium, you may be told that the &quot;buyer&quot; only wants to purchase quantities 
of 500 or more. However, if you buy more indium, you will only lose more money. The so-called &quot;buyer&quot; will disappear.</p>
<h4>Part III: &quot;Good-by&quot;</h4>
<p>If you ever discuss selling your indium with the telemarketers, they may stall your action by telling you the price hasn't peaked yet 
or that you still need more indium for your portfolio. If, at some point, you discover you paid too much for the indium, you may 
find that the sales representative who was so eager to sell you indium before is no longer available to talk to you. Your phone 
calls may not be forwarded or your messages returned. Some companies often ask for the purchase money by wire because it's 
difficult to trace who receives the transfer. Others may shut down quickly, running with the money that investors have paid. It 
may be impossible to get your money back, especially if you're dealing with a foreign company.</p>
<h4>Before Parting with Your Money</h4>
<p>Be extremely cautious if someone calls offering to sell you indium or any other strategic metal as an investment. For general 
information, or to register a complaint against a telemarketing company, you may contact:</p>
<p>National Fraud Information Center Consumer Assistance Hotline 1-800-876-7060 9:00 a.m. - 5:30 p.m. EST, Monday-Friday</p>

<p>You also may file a complaint with the agencies listed on the next page. When writing to register a complaint, include a complete 
history of your involvement with the company. You should enclose copies of all letters, brochures, or other material you received

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Investing in Wireless Cable TV -- November 1992</h2>
<p>The lottery for wireless cable TV licenses has been suspended, pending revision of current FCC rules. It is not known when the 
lottery will resume. Until then, beware of companies soliciting lottery applications.</p>
<p>Is a wireless cable TV station a good investment? Some companies say it is and, for a fee, will help you prepare an application to 
obtain a license to build and operate one. Before you invest, you should understand that licenses for wireless cable--Multichannel 
Multipoint Distribution Service (MMDS)--are awarded on a lottery basis by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). 
But even if you win an MMDS lottery, you still could lose your entire investment. This brochure tells you why. It explains what a 
wireless cable TV station is, how the FCC lottery works, and what risks are involved. It also warns you against claims made by 
some application preparation services.</p>
<h4>The Wireless Cable Station</h4>
<p>A wireless cable TV station uses microwave technology to transmit video programming to the rooftop antennas of subscribers. 
Its signal operates via a line of sight transmission, which means obstacles such as hills, woods, and large buildings can interfere 
with it. Although no wires need to be laid, it can cost over $100,000 to build a wireless cable system and $400 or more per 
rooftop antenna to hook up subscribers.</p>
<h4>The FCC Lottery</h4>
<p>To participate in an MMDS lottery, you must file an application with the FCC. A license application is lengthy and complex. It 
must include detailed engineering and interference studies for the station you propose to construct. This is why many investors 
hire companies to prepare their application documents.</p>
<p>The FCC awards two MMDS licenses in each market area, and each license is for 4 channels. You can file in as many markets 
as you wish. However, for each 4-channel group, you must file a separate application with the FCC, paying a $155 fee.</p>
<p>To be eligible for the lottery, the FCC must receive your application within 24 hours after it has accepted the first qualified 
application for a particular market. After that, the market is closed. Because of this short time period, it may not be possible to 
find out if the market you want to file for has been closed.</p>
<p>Most likely, there will be competing applications for the same 4-channel group in a market. The FCC conducts a random chance 
lottery to choose a tentative selectee. The lottery &quot;winner&quot; is awarded a conditional license if it survives possible challenges by 
lottery losers and if it remedies any deficiency in its application.</p>
<p>Competing applicants can form an alliance, or a settlement group, after applications have been filed, but before a lottery is held. 
Alliance members agree to share a license and have as many chances to win a lottery as its members would have had 
individually. If there are no holdouts (applicants who refuse to join an alliance), the alliance is granted a conditional license once it 
forwards a single application acceptable to the FCC. A license is automatically forfeited if the wireless cable station is not 
constructed and made operational within a maximum of one year, or as specified.</p>
<h4>MMDS Markets</h4>
<p>There may be thousands of market areas for wireless cable. However, most of the biggest markets in the country were closed in 
1983 when the FCC opened filing for one day only and received more than 16,000 applications. Since 1988, when the FCC 
again started accepting applications for the remaining open markets, more than 13,000 applications have been filed.</p>
<p>Unlike FCC cellular telephone lotteries, where markets remained open for a fixed period regardless of how many qualified 
applications were filed, MMDS markets can close at any time. As stated earlier, an open market closes at midnight on the day 
the first acceptable application is submitted.</p>
<p>However, because of the time required to process applications and the volume of applications that the FCC receives, it could be 
months before the public learns a formerly open market has been closed. Applications filed for a closed market will be rejected 
and the $155 filing fee will not be returned.</p>
<h4>Application Preparation Services</h4>
<p>Companies that sell application services for MMDS licenses use the telephone, mail, and TV and radio advertisements to reach 
potential investors, and they usually charge thousands of dollars for their services. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC), in 
cooperation with the FCC, is investigating claims made by some of these companies. The FTC has brought three separate 
lawsuits alleging that the companies misrepresented the value of an MMDS license, the likelihood of winning the license, and the 
risk involved.</p>
<p>\plain \s1 \f20 \fs24 \b Investment Risks\plain \s1 \f20 \fs24 </p>
<p>In addition to the risk of having competition from other applicants, you may be paying thousands of dollars to a company to 
prepare your application for a market that is closed. Even if you win the lottery, you still may lose your investment if you are 
challenged by lottery losers and found to be unqualified to receive an MMDS license. A wireless cable license also may be 
worthless for other reasons.</p>
<p>It may be difficult, or even impossible, to secure financing to construct and operate the station.</p>
<p>Many small communities would not have enough subscribers to support a wireless cable TV station.</p>
<p>There may be no buyers for a wireless cable TV station once it is made operational.</p>
<h4>Other Considerations</h4>
<p>Make sure you understand exactly what it means to invest in an application for wireless cable. Before you apply for a wireless 
cable license, consider these points.</p>
<p>It could take months before the FCC is able to process your application.</p>
<p>Although 33 channels are possible for use in an MMDS system, a successful MMDS applicant wins only four. To get more, you 
may have to negotiate with as many as 26 other licensees.</p>
<p>A wireless cable system is not likely to return profits for at least the first several years of operation.</p>
<p>Wireless cable TV has heavy competition from conventional cable and TV stations, home satellite dishes, Direct Broadcast 
Satellite, and other wireless cable TV channels in the same market.</p>
<p>The value of a wireless cable TV station is not comparable to that of a cable TV station. Cable TV has approximately 50 million 
subscribers whereas wireless cable TV has about 350,000 subscribers. The biggest wireless cable operator in the country--with 
licenses in Detroit, New York, and Washington, D.C.--filed for bankruptcy in December 1989.</p>
<h4>For More information</h4>
<p>If you have questions about the wireless cable lottery, write to the FCC, 1919 M Street, Washington, D.C. 20554. If you have a 
complaint about an application service, write to: Correspondence Branch, Federal Trade Commission, Washington, D.C. 
20580.</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Leveraged Investments of Precious Metals -- March 1994</h2>
<p>Every year consumers lose billions of dollars to fraudulent telemarketing investments. Under one scheme, telemarketing 
companies may use high-pressure sales tactics to persuade consumers to make leveraged investments in precious metals, such as 
silver, gold and platinum. The companies may falsely claim such investments carry low risk and can be expected to generate high 
profits. However, the price of precious metals is volatile and an investment in these commodities is speculative and risky.</p>
<p>And by leveraging, borrowing money to make the investment, the degree of risk is magnified. During recent years, many 
consumers who have invested in these programs have lost a high percentage of their investments.</p>
<p>Before you agree to make a leveraged purchase of precious metals, read this brochure.</p>
<h4>How the Scams Works</h4>
<p>A salesperson may call urging you to invest in precious metals. The caller may predict that the market price of metals is about to 
skyrocket during the next few days or weeks and that if you don't act now, your investment opportunity may be lost. Claims may 
be made that your investment can be expected to generate substantial profits, with little risk, in as little as six months.</p>
<p>The salesperson may explain that, under their investment plan, you are to pay a portion of the cost of the metal in cash, often 20 
percent, and a financial institution will loan you the balance. The financial institution will arrange for your metal to be held as 
collateral for the loan.</p>
<p>During the sales pitch, you also may be given information about program fees and commissions. But, in fact, FTC cases against 
such telemarketers suggest that many of the fees and commissions charged were misrepresented or concealed and that fees ate 
up the majority of the money that the consumers actually paid into the program. In addition, consumers often do not receive 
written account statements that completely disclose program fees.</p>
<p>Besides potentially losing your initial cash outlay to commissions and fees, a highly leveraged investment increases the risk of an 
equity call. An equity call occurs when changes in the price of the metals or program fees causes the value of your investment to 
fall to where the financing company considers your metal insufficient collateral to secure the loan. Upon receiving an equity call, 
you must decide whether to put more money into the investment or have the financing company sell the metal in order to pay off 
the loan. Either way, you are likely to lose some or all of your investment.</p>
<p>\plain \s1 \f20 \fs24 \b How to Avoid Losing Your Money\plain \s1 \f20 \fs24 </p>
<p>Consider the following precautions if you receive an investment solicitation.</p>
<p>l Be skeptical about any unsolicited phone calls about investments. You may be on a list that contains the names, addresses, 
phone numbers, and descriptions of people who have responded before to telephone solicitations regarding questionable 
schemes.</p>
<p>Avoid high-pressure sales tactics. Sales presentations that urge you to buy now or you'll lose your investment opportunity are 
clues to a possible fraud. If you feel pressured, simply hang up the phone.</p>
<p>Ask the caller to send you information about the company and its operation and verify the data. Check out the company's offer 
with someone whose financial advice you trust.</p>
<p>Contact the consumer protection agency, Attorney General, and Better Business Bureau in your state and in the state where the 
company is located to learn if they know of any consumer complaints against the firm.</p>
<h4>What to Do If You Feel Victimized</h4>
<p>If you believe you are a victim of a fraudulent precious metals investment, first contact the company and try to get your money 
back. Write a complaint letter to the company that sold you the metal and to the company that financed the transaction. If 
possible, direct your complaint personally to the highest ranking officials in the company. Also, report your problem to your local 
consumer protection agency, state Attorney General, and the Better Business Bureau.</p>
<p>In addition, you may wish to contact the National Fraud Information Center (NFIC), Consumer Assistance Hotline at 
1-800-876-7060, 9 a.m. - 5:30 p.m. EST, Monday - Friday, to report the company. The NFIC is a private, non-profit 
organization that operates a hotline to provide services and assistance in filing complaints.</p>
<p>You also may file a complaint with the FTC by writing to: Correspondence Branch, Federal Trade Commission, Washington, 
D.C. 20580. Although the FTC generally does not intervene in individual disputes, the information you provide may help to 
indicate a pattern of possible law violations requiring action by the Commission.</p>
<h4>Where to Go For More Information</h4>
<p>The FTC has a series of Facts for Consumers that explain fraudulent sales practices and precautions you can take to avoid 
becoming a victim. Titles include:</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Mobile Radio Investment Scams -- January 1994</h2>
<p>Television commercials, program-length infomercials, and newspaper ads throughout the country have touted the high profits to 
be made from investing in Specialized Mobile Radio systems (SMR) or from licenses to operate these systems. Some ads 
promote SMRs as an alternative to cellular telephone systems. SMR refers to a set of radio frequencies or channels allocated by 
the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) primarily to transmit and receive paging, data communications, and voice 
transmission -- such as radio dispatch and mobile telephone -- over distances of less than 40 miles. The FCC issues licenses for 
SMR systems consisting of one or more channel pairs.</p>
<p>SMR systems have significant technological limitations that may hamper their commercial competitiveness with cellular telephone 
systems. Prospective investors should consider some limiting aspects of SMR systems as telephone systems. First, a 
conventional SMR system must be combined with other SMR systems into a network to achieve sufficient transmission capacity. 
In addition, to compete with the call-carrying capacity of cellular telephone systems, an SMR would have to be upgraded with 
more advanced digital equipment that could cost in excess of several million dollars. Further, most SMR systems use &quot;analog&quot; 
technology which, among other things, limits an SMR channel to a single user at a time, much like the old-fashioned telephone 
&quot;party line.&quot; This could result in a higher percentage of &quot;busy signals&quot; than a user would encounter on a cellular system. Another 
limitation of analog technology is the lack of compatibility of SMR equipment made by different manufacturers.</p>
<p>This could result in breaks in call transmission when customers &quot;roam&quot; into neighboring service areas. This also may make it 
difficult for SMR license holders to guarantee call services to customers once they travel beyond the immediate SMR provider's 
service area.</p>
<h4>SMR License Scams</h4>
<p>Telemarketers are soliciting consumers to invest thousands of dollars to purchase a government license to operate an SMR 
system. However, for between $250 and $1,000 -- including the $35 FCC application fee and legal expenses -- individuals can 
apply for an SMR license directly from the FCC. Licenses are granted on a &quot;first-come, first-serve&quot; basis and, according to the 
FCC, are available in many areas of the country.</p>
<h4>SMR Network Scams</h4>
<p>In a related scheme, telemarketers also are soliciting consumers to invest in partnerships to develop a network of SMR systems 
to compete with cellular telephone services. Some telemarketers have promised investors annual returns of several thousand 
dollars per year within 18 months of the startup of the network.</p>
<p>Given the significant technological limitations of SMR systems, such profits are unlikely due to the high costs of upgrading the 
system with digital equipment to compete &quot;head-on&quot; with cellular and other large SMR operators.</p>
<h4>Tips for Investors</h4>
<p>Before investing in an SMR partnership, consider taking the following steps to help protect yourself:</p>
<p>Find out the specific location of the proposed SMR license, system, or network. Beware of any company that refuses to provide 
this information.</p>
<p>Verify that the proposed location contains enough users to support an SMR telephone system.</p>
<p>Conduct a financial analysis of the project. Include projections for start-up costs, operating capital, cash flow, and income.</p>
<p>Investigate the financial representations made by the salesperson and ask questions. Consider getting advice concerning the 
viability of the investment from your attorney, accountant, or other business professional.</p>
<p>Be skeptical of a company that promotes partnerships as a way to put SMR networks in operation. Such partnerships may not 
comply with state securities laws. Check with your state securities agency.</p>
<p>Be cautious of a telemarketing company that promises to build and manage an SMR system. You should verify whether the 
company has the technical and business expertise to do so. Also, under FCC rules, a licensee must be actively involved in the 
management of the business or the license may be revoked.</p>
<p>Be suspicious of any company that claims that an SMR license may be sold immediately after being granted. The FCC prohibits 
the sale of a license until the license is placed in operation.</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Telephone Investment Fraud -- May 1992</h2>
<p>Every year tens of thousands of consumers put some of their money in investments. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) 
estimates that every year American consumers from all walks of life lose $1 billion or more in investments that turn out to be 
fraudulent.</p>
<p>Between 1983 and 1992, the FTC put a variety of such fraudulent companies out of business. It brought suit against 325 
defendants and recovered almost $100 million for injured consumers.</p>
<p>But if you invest in what turns out to be a fraudulent scheme, the chance of getting all of your money back is slim. Even in cases 
where money is recovered, consumers often get back less than 10 cents on every dollar invested. That is because companies 
engaged in fraud often operate a particular scam for a short time, quickly spend the money they take in, and frequently close 
down before they can be detected. Then they reopen under another name selling another investment scam.</p>
<p>Investment frauds are sold in a variety of ways print and television advertising, for example but three-quarters of the investment 
scams the FTC investigates are sold by the telephone. There has been a dramatic increase in telemarketing investment fraud 
because of the ease of establishing fraudulent operations and the popularity of telephone selling. Everyone with a telephone is 
vulnerable.</p>
<h4>How Telephone Investment Fraud Works</h4>
<p>To be sure, many investment plans are sound. Ones that are not take many forms. Typical investments sold by fraudulent 
operators have included coins, gemstones, art, oil and gas leases, interests in oil wells, application services related to cellular 
telephone licenses, precious metals such as gold and silver, or strategic metals such as chromium, used in defense and high-tech 
industries. Fraudulent companies often choose to sell investments that may fluctuate substantially in response to world events. For 
example, fraudulent sellers may offer you an investment based on the scarcity of a foreign metal after news of a trade embargo, 
or they might offer you an investment in a new, widely publicized high-tech product. The fraudulent seller's goal is to make it 
difficult for consumers to scrutinize their overinflated value claims.</p>
<p>The heart of the telemarketing operation is usually centered in a &quot;boiler room,&quot; a setting filled with desks, telephones, and 
salespeople who spend their days calling hundreds of prospects all over the country. You may be contacted by one of these 
boiler room operators if you respond to a newspaper ad or fill out a card asking for more information about an investment, or 
you might be called &quot;cold.&quot; Some fraudulent investment sellers target investors who have been victims of an earlier scam. These 
sellers know that investors who have been tricked once often have a certain vulnerability because they hope to recoup their 
losses.</p>
<h4>Who Are The Fraudulent Salespersons?</h4>
<p>Salespersons in boiler room operations often spend years going from fraud to fraud. Their years of selling experience and natural 
sales talent make them very good at what they do. They use persuasive sales pitches that weave together facts and half-truths in 
ways that are likely to deceive all but the most experienced investor. Their sales pitches are directed to the universal desire to get 
great financial return for very little risk.</p>
<p>In addition to being glib, these sales operators are resourceful. They use a wide variety of reasons why their investment 
opportunity is a sure thing. They may say, for example, that they: have high-level financial connections; are privy to inside 
information; will guarantee the investment; or will buy back the investment after a certain period. To close the sale quickly, these 
fraudulent sellers may offer you phony statistics, misrepresent the significance of a current event, or stress the uniqueness of their 
offerings to try to dissuade you from verifying the story.</p>
<h4>What Is Their Typical Sales Pitch?</h4>
<p>Often, fraudulent salespersons will:</p>
<p>Say you have been specially selected to participate in an unusual investment opportunity;</p>
<p>Present a popular, believable message mixed with truth and lies;</p>
<p>Guarantee large and rapid profits;</p>
<p>Claim that virtually no risk is involved; and</p>
<p>Require that money be paid immediately because the &quot;market is moving.&quot; The salesperson even may give price quotations to 
&quot;document&quot; the rise.</p>
<h4>How To Avoid Losing Your Money</h4>
<p>Because it is so difficult to recover money paid to fraudulent sellers, the best thing you can do is refuse to give them money in the 
first place. If you are approached by anyone selling an investment opportunity, remember the following cautions. They may help 
you avoid investing in a bogus firm.</p>
<p>If it sounds too good, it probably is a scam. No legitimate salesperson will ever claim to offer a risk-free investment. Big returns 
usually mean big risks. Any claim that there is little or no risk should act as a red flag.</p>
<p>Do not be pressured into buying. High-pressure sales tactics that urge you to buy now or forever lose your opportunity to profit 
are tip-offs to possible fraudulent operations. If you are being pressured, you can simply hang up the phone. Once you send a 
fraudulent investment seller your money, it may be gone forever.</p>
<p>Invest in business opportunities you know something about. It is unlikely you will make money in a business deal that you cannot 
understand and verify. You especially should be wary of any investment where you need to rely exclusively on the seller's 
representation of the investment's value.</p>
<p>Be skeptical about any unsolicited phone calls about investments. Think twice before you buy investments from out-of-state 
salespeople you do not know. You may find it very hard to get your money back if the deal sours.</p>
<p>Get all the information you can about the company and verify the data. Before you invest with any company, check the seller's 
prospectus with someone whose financial advice you trust. Also check the company's reputation with appropriate references. 
Many are listed at the end of this brochure.</p>
<p>Any resistance you get from a seller when you seek additional investment information or references should make you suspect. 
But if you do receive additional references, keep in mind that these may not provide reliable information about the investment or 
the company. For example, a bank may tell you that an investment company has an account, but this does not mean the company 
is legitimate.</p>
<p>Beware of testimonials. Fraudulent companies sometimes hire references to claim that the firm's investments brought them sudden 
wealth. And Ponzi schemes, where promoters use the money from new investors to pay high returns to early investors, may 
explain why the company is praised.</p>
<p>If in doubt, do not invest. Before you invest, ask questions and seek information from a variety of sources. If you cannot get solid 
information about the company and the investment, you may not want to risk your money.</p>
<h4>Where To Go For More Information</h4>
<p>Listed here are government agencies and business organizations that register, regulate, investigate, or monitor companies and 
individuals who offer investment opportunities. If you have questions about a company or an individual, or you wish to make a 
complaint, contact one or more of these offices, as appropriate. When you seek information, understand that the absence of 
complaints filed with governmental and private agencies does not mean that a company or an investment is necessarily sound.</p>
<p>The Federal Trade Commission is a law enforcement agency that investigates and prosecutes a variety of investment frauds. If 
you have questions or complaints about claims made in advertising or in telephone promotions for investment services, write to: 
Federal Trade Commission, Investment Fraud Project, Room 200, Bureau of Consumer Protection, Washington, D.C. 20580.</p>
<p>Your State Attorney General's office and your local District Attorney's office investigate and prosecute fraud cases. You can find 
their telephone numbers by checking your local directory in the state and local government section.</p>
<p>Your State Securities Commission, Securities Department, or Department of Corporations regulates the public offer and sale of 
securities by companies in your state. You can get the name and telephone number by calling the operator in your state capital.</p>
<p>The Chief United States Postal Inspector, United States Postal Service, Washington, D.C. 20260-2112, handles complaints 
about bogus mail-order investment services. The USPS has jurisdiction over fraudulent business operations that use, advertise, 
or sell through the mail. The Federal Bureau of Investigation also has jurisdiction when investment offerings constitute mail or wire 
fraud, or other violations of criminal law.</p>
<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission regulates most firms that deal in commodity futures markets. Futures trading 
markets include petroleum products, U.S. government securities, foreign currencies, options on futures contracts, and dealer 
options. Write the Commodity Futures Trading Commission at 2033 K Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20581.</p>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission is a federal agency that regulates the public offer and sales of securities. Contact the 
Securities and Exchange Commission at 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549, or call (202) 272-7440.</p>
<p>The Better Business Bureau mediates disputes between consumers and businesses and may be able to inform you about 
complaints lodged against local investment firms. Contact the BBB in the city in which the firm is located for information or to 
report a problem. For the phone number of an out-of-state BBB, write to the Council of Better Business Bureaus, 4200 Wilson 
Boulevard, Arlington, VA 22203.</p>
<p>The National Association of Securities Dealers is a self-regulatory organization that governs stock brokers. Check your phone 
directory for a local district office of the National Association of Securities Dealers, or contact its Washington office at 1735 K 
Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20006, or call (202) 728-8221.</p>
<p>The National Futures Association is a self-regulatory organization for all registered individuals or brokerage firms. Contact the 
National Futures Association at 200 West Madison Street, Suite 1600, Chicago, IL 60606, or call (800) 621-3570. In Illinois, 
call (800) 572-9400.</p>

<h2>Treasury Investors..... Make the Smart Exchange</h2>
<p>Do you still hold Treasury securities in paper form? If you do, you may be taking the unnecessary risk that your securities could 
be lost, stolen, or destroyed.</p>
<p>You can reduce these risks by joining millions of other Treasury investors in making the Smart Exchange from paper Treasury 
certificates to a book-entry account. Book-entry accounts provide a number of benefits which make investing in Treasury 
securities a safer and easier decision than ever before. These benefits include:</p>
<h4>Safety</h4>
<p>* Since book-entry accounts are paper-less, there is no risk that your Treasury securities could be lost, stolen, or destroyed.</p>
<p>* With a book-entry account, your holdings are safely kept on account at the U.S. Treasury, a financial institution, or a 
brokerage house.</p>
<h4>Convenience</h4>
<p>* With a book-entry account, the interest and maturity payments for your Treasury securities are credited to your account 
automatically on the payment date. You don't need to go to a financial institution or Federal Reserve Bank to cash checks, clip 
coupons, or redeem matured certificates.</p>
<p>* In most cases, information about your Treasury account is immediately available to you at the time of an inquiry, regardless of 
where your account is established. You can also review the status of your holdings at home simply by reviewing your statement 
of account.</p>
<p>Many investors have switched from paper Treasury investments to book-entry. Now it's your turn to experience the advantages 
of book-entry Treasuries.</p>
<h4>Now It's Your Turn...</h4>
<p>The first step in exchanging your Treasury securities for a book-entry account is to choose the book-entry system that is best for 
you. Your choice of systems should be based on how active you want to be in the management of your Treasury securities 
portfolio.</p>
<p>The Treasury offers two types of book-entry systems:</p>
<p>* Commercial book-entry, offered through financial institutions and brokers; and</p>
<p>* TREASURY DIRECT, offered by the U.S. Treasury's Bureau of the Public Debt.</p>
<h4>Commercial Book-Entry</h4>
<p>Commercial book-entry, available through most financial institutions and brokers, may be most appropriate if you want a third 
party to manage your account, or if you plan to sell your securities prior to maturity. In the commercial book-entry system, your 
account records are maintained on the books of the third party you select. Interest and maturity payments are made directly to 
the third party who disburses the funds to your account. These third parties may charge a fee for the services they provide.</p>
<h4>TREASURY DIRECT</h4>
<p>TREASURY DIRECT, the Department of the Treasury's automated book&#169;entry system, is ideal if you plan to keep your 
securities from the purchase to maturity, and if you wish to manage your own account. Securities held in a TREASURY 
DIRECT account are maintained directly on the records of the Bureau of the Public Debt. Since 1986, all new issues of Treasury 
bills, notes, and bonds have been issued only in book-entry form.</p>
<p>TREASURY DIRECT offers you the following benefits:</p>
<p>* TREASURY DIRECT is offered free of charge at Federal Reserve offices throughout the country.</p>
<p>* All interest and maturity payments are deposited on time and automatically into an account of your choice through direct 
deposit. Direct deposit eliminates the possibility of destroyed, lost, or stolen checks.</p>
<p>* TREASURY DIRECT provides a single master account for all Treasury securities holdings having the same registration, 
simplifying your record-keeping. You are mailed a statement of account after any transaction or change that affects your master 
account, including reinvestments.</p>
<p>* With TREASURY DIRECT, you have the option of reinvesting in other Treasury securities being offered at the same time your 
current holdings mature. Now that you know about the different book-entry systems available, it's time to exchange the paper 
securities you've been holding for a book-entry account. You Know It Makes Sense The sooner you exchange your Treasury 
securities for a book-entry account, the sooner you will enjoy the benefits that book-entry systems offer. So, make the Smart 
Exchange. You'll have peace of mind knowing your Treasury investments are safer and more convenient than ever.</p>

<h4>YOUR GUARANTEED PENSION</h4>
<h4>Q. What is the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation?</h4>
<p>The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) is a U.S. Government agency established by the Employee Retirement 
Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). PBGC administers two insurance programs that guarantee the payment of basic 
retirement benefits, within limits set by law, to participants of private defined benefit pension plans. PBGC programs are financed 
by premiums paid by employers sponsoring covered plans, in, vestment returns on PBGC assets, and recoveries from employers 
responsible for underfunded terminated plans.</p>
<h4>Q. What is a defined benefit pension plan?</h4>
<p>A defined benefit pension plan is one that promises a specified monthly benefit at retirement. The amount of the defined benefit 
usually is based on factors such as age, earnings, and years of service. The plan may state this promised benefit as a specific 
dollar amount (for example, $100 per month at retirement), or through a formula used to calculate the benefit (for example, $10 
per month for every year of service with your employer)</p>
<h4>Q. What private pension plans are insured by PBGC?</h4>
<p>The PBGC insurance program described in this booklet covers most defined benefit pension plans sponsored either by a single 
employer or, if the plan is not collectively bargained, by a group of employers. PBGC also administers another insurance 
program -- not covered here -- for multiemployer pension plans, which are collectively bargained plans to which two or more 
unrelated employers are required to contribute.</p>
<h4>Q. How can I find out id my pension plan is insured by PBGC?</h4>
<p>Ask your plan administrator. Although PBGC insures most defined benefit plans, ERISA does exclude certain ones from PBGC 
coverage. For example, plans sponsored by &quot;professional service employers&quot; (such as doctors and lawyers) with fewer than 26 
employees, by church groups, or by Federal, state or local governments usually are not insured. In addition, PBGC does not 
insure defined contribution plans such as profit sharing, stock bonus, 401(k)'s or thrift plans.</p>
<h4>Q. How does PBGC's insurance program work?</h4>
<p>If your plan is insured by PBGC, your plan administrator or employer must pay premiums to PBGC for insurance coverage as 
long as the plan continues. However, failure to pay these premiums does not cancel a plan's legally required insurance coverage. 
When an insured plan terminates with insufficient assets to pay guaranteed benefits, PBGC guarantees payment of benefits under 
the plan, subject to certain limitations described in more detail later in this booklet. PBGC steps in to pay benefits only when a 
plan does not have enough assets to pay at least the PBGC-guaranteed benefits.</p>
<h4>PLAN TERMINATION</h4>
<h4>Q. How is a plan terminated?</h4>
<p>Pension plans are terminated generally for business reasons or to substitute another plan. The law restricts the ways in which a 
termination may occur. However, your employer may terminate your plan in a &quot;standard&quot; or &quot;distress&quot; termination if certain legal 
requirements are met. In addition, PBGC may initiate termination of an underfunded plan when necessary to protect the interests 
of the plan participants, of the plan, or of PBGC.</p>
<h4>Q. What is a standard termination?</h4>
<p>A standard termination is a process through which an employer may end a fully funded plan. The plan administrator must first 
demonstrate to PBGC that the plan has enough money to provide all the pension benefits that, as of the date of plan termination, 
participants have earned under the plan. This amount is called the plan's &quot;benefit liability.&quot;</p>
<h4>Q. What happens in a standard termination? </h4>
<p>If the plan qualifies for a standard termination, PBGC allows the administrator to complete the termination and distribute the plan 
assets by purchasing annuities from an insurance company, which pays benefits to each participant upon retirement, or by making 
lump-sum or other distributions provided by the plan. Whether you receive an annuity or a lump-sum payment, you will receive 
full payment of your earned benefit, including non-vested amounts. Once promised benefits are provided through the purchase of 
an annuity or through a lump-sum or other distribution, the PBGC guarantee ends. Plan participants must be informed of the 
identity of the insurer that will provide annuities 60 days before the proposed date of termination, if known at that time, but no 
later than 45 days before assets are distributed.</p>
<h4>Q. What is a distress termination?</h4>
<p>A distress termination is a process through which an employer may end a plan that does not have enough assets to pay all 
benefits. To do so, however, the employer must prove to PBGC that it and each of its corporate affiliates meet one of four strict 
financial distress tests. Basically, employers must show that they are in such poor financial condition, or that the pension costs are 
so burdensome, that the employer cannot continue in business and support the plan.</p>
<h4>Q. What happens in a distress termination?</h4>
<p>If the plan can pay at least the PBGC-guaranteed benefits, PBGC authorizes the administrator to distribute the plan assets as in a 
standard termination, although participants may not receive all benefits. If the plan does not have enough money to pay the 
PBGC-guaranteed benefits, PBGC will step in, take the plan over, and use PBGC funds to make sure that the guaranteed 
benefits due to participants are paid. PBGC, as trustee of the plan, will seek to recover plan underfunding from the employer; 
any recovery may increase the amount participants receive above the guarantee level.</p>
<h4>Q. How will I know if my pension plan is being terminated?</h4>
<p>In either a standard or distress termination, your plan administrator must inform you in writing that your pension plan is being 
terminated. This notice, called the Notice of Intent to Terminate, must be sent to each plan participant, beneficiary of a deceased 
participant, union representing plan participants, and alternate payee under a Qualified Domestic Relations Order, at least 60 and 
not more than 90 days before the proposed termination date. When PBGC initiates the termination of an underfunded pension 
plan, PBGC usually publishes a notice of the termination in legal advertisements in newspapers.</p>
<h4>Q. What other information should I expect from my plan administrator?</h4>
<p>In a standard termination, your plan administrator must send you a second notice, called the Notice of Plan Benefits, no later than 
when PBGC is notified of the termination. This notice must be written in plain language and generally must tell you the amount of 
your benefit, the form in which your benefit has been valued, and the personal data and assumptions used in calculating your 
benefit. In a distress termination, full information concerning your benefits will be sent to PBGC, which will then notify you about 
the benefits payable to you under the insurance program.</p>
<h4>Q. What information will I receive from PBGC if it has to take over my plan?</h4>
<p>If PBGC has to step in and use its funds to pay guaranteed benefits, PBGC will become trustee of your plan and notify all plan 
participants of this, action. When PBGC becomes trustee, it takes over the records of plan participants, continues benefit 
payments to current retirees without interruption, and begins benefit payments to new retirees. PBGC also will notify you of the 
benefit amount you will receive from PBGC and of your right to appeal PBGC's benefit determination.</p>
<h4>Q. How does PBGC determine the amount I will receive?</h4>
<p>The provisions of your plan, your age, and the form in which your benefit is paid determine the amount of your benefit. If you 
have been receiving monthly pension payments and PBGC becomes trustee of. your plan, PBGC initially will continue payments 
based on an estimate of the benefit you should receive under the insurance program.. PBGC will then examine the provisions of 
your plan and your personal data in detail, calculate your benefit, and notify you of the benefit amount you are due.</p>
<h4>Q. What happens if PBGC's initial estimate of my benefit is too high or too low?</h4>
<p>If you are underpaid, you will receive the amount underpaid plus interest in a lump sum when your final benefit is determined. If 
you are overpaid, you will have to pay back the overpayments. Generally, PBGC recovers overpayments by reducing the 
monthly benefit payment, but by no more than 10 percent of the monthly benefit amount.</p>
<h4>Q. Will my deductions stay the same?</h4>
<p>PBGC only withholds Federal income taxes, not state taxes. You will have to make arrangements to pay other amounts now 
being withheld.</p>
<h4>BENEFIT GUARANTEES</h4>
<h4>Q. What kinds of benefits are guaranteed by PBGC?</h4>
<p>PBGC guarantees &quot;basic benefits&quot; -- those vested monthly pension benefits that provide income when you retire. Basic benefits 
include pension benefits beginning at normal retirement age, certain early retirement and disability benefits, and certain benefits for 
survivors of deceased plan participants. The type of benefit guaranteed by PBGC depends on the benefit you are entitled to 
receive as of the date of plan termination. However, all benefits that a pension plan provides may not be basic benefits and, 
therefore, may not be guaranteed under the insurance program. For example, health and welfare benefits and vacation pay are 
not guaranteed.</p>
<h4>Q. What survivors' benefits does PBGC pay?</h4>
<p>If you retire before plan termination and your benefit includes a survivor's benefit, or you are receiving a survivor's benefit before 
plan termination,n, the survivors benefit will be paid by PBGC. If you begin receiving a benefit after plan termination, PBGC will 
pay you a &quot;joint-and-survivor&quot; annuity if you are married at retirement, unless you waive the annuity with your spouse's consent. 
A joint-and-survivor annuity generally provides a reduced benefit for the participant's life, with a portion of the benefit continuing 
to the surviving spouse. Between plan termination and your retirement, PBGC also provides you with &quot;preretirement survivor 
annuity&quot; coverage for any period during which you were married, unless you waive the coverage with your spouse's consent. This 
coverage provides a survivor benefit if you die before retiring. Monthly benefits for the participant and beneficiary generally will 
be reduced for this coverage.</p>
<h4>Q. How much money will I receive in monthly pension benefits if PBGC becomes trustee of my plan?</h4>
<p>The amount you receive will depend on how long you worked under the plan, the provisions of your pension plan, on funding by 
the employer prior to plan termination, on PBGC's recoveries from the employer after plan termination, on PBGC's maximum 
guarantee limit on the date of plan termination, and on the extent to which pre-termination benefit increases are guaranteed. 
Benefit amounts will vary from participant to participant: The amount you receive will never be more than you would have 
received if your pension plan had remained in operation and will never be less than the amount guaranteed by PBGC.</p>
<h4>Q. What is the maximum limit on PBGC's guarantee?</h4>
<p>Benefits guaranteed by PBGC are subject to a maximum limit set annually by law, under provisions of ERISA. For pension plans 
terminating in 1994, the maximum guaranteed amount is $2,556.82 per month ($30,681.84 yearly) for a participant who retires 
at age 65. This maximum monthly payment must be reduced if your benefit is paid or payable to you before age 65, or is paid to 
you in a form other than an annuity for your life alone, such as a form that provides for survivors' benefits. Examples of the 
maximum guarantee appear in the table on the last page.</p>
<h4>Q. Is PBGC's guarantee of basic benefits limited in other ways?</h4>
<p>Yes. If your plan has been amended to increase basic benefits and is terminated within five years after the adoption or effective 
date of the amendment, whichever is later, the increase may not be fully guaranteed. In such a case, PBGC must apply a &quot;phase 
in rule,&quot; guaranteeing the larger of 20% or $20 per month of the increase in benefits for each whole year since the amendment. 
There are other limitations as well, including a special rule for participants who own more than 10% of the company sponsoring 
the pension plan.</p>
<p>Q. What if my pension plan provides benefits other than guaranteed benefits, or my benefits are more than PBGC guarantees -- 
will I receive these benefits if my underfunded plan terminates?</p>
<p>If your plan contains enough money at termination to pay the additional benefits, you should receive them. If your plan does not 
have enough money at termination to pay all promised benefits but does have sufficient assets to pay some non-guaranteed 
benefits, or if PBGC recovers sufficient amounts from your employer, some participants may receive a portion of their 
nonguaranteed benefit in addition to their guaranteed benefit.</p>
<h4>Q. Will I receive my benefit in a lump-sum payment or as a monthly annuity?</h4>
<p>If your plan terminates with enough money to cover at least guaranteed benefits and it doesn't rule out lump-sum distributions, 
then you may choose a lump-sum option. If your plan is trusteed by PBGC and the plan allowed or required employee 
contributions, you may elect a lump-sum return of these contributions with interest. If you choose a refund of these contributions, 
PBGC will reduce the amount of your monthly benefit to reflect the refund. If the value of your benefit is $3,500 or less as of the 
date your plan terminated, and PBGC trustees your plan, PBGC., pays your benefit in a lump-sum payment if you were not 
retired when the plan terminated.</p>
<h4>Q. If I am entitled to receive a lump-sum settlement from my pension plan when it terminates, can I put this money 
into an Individual Retirement Account without paying taxes on it immediately?</h4>
<p>Yes. You can make a &quot;tax-free rollover&quot; into an Individual Retirement Account (IRA), but under the new tax provisions it must 
be in a direct rollover from your plan to the IRA. By choosing this rollover, you can defer taxes on your distribution until you 
begin receiving benefits from your IRA. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) administers the laws controlling IRA's. For more 
information, call or write the IRS office nearest you.</p>
<h4>Q. Does the benefit paid to me by PBGC include annual Cost of Living Adjustments (COLA's)?</h4>
<p>No. PBGC does not have an annual COLA provision. Although the maximum amount guaranteed is adjusted yearly for inflation, 
the maximum amount applicable to a particular plan is fixed as of that plan's date of termination. (See table on last page for 
maximum guarantee levels.) However, COLAs provided by your plan that were effective prior to plan termination are 
guaranteed subject to the maximum guarantee and &quot;phase-in&quot; limits described on pages 9 and 10.</p>
<h4>Q. When will I begin receiving benefits if PBGC becomes trustee of my plan?</h4>
<p>If you have already retired when PBGC becomes trustee of your plan, you will continue receiving at least your estimated 
guaranteed pension on a monthly basis. If you have not yet retired, PBGC will begin paying your benefits when you become 
eligible and apply.</p>
<h4>Q. As a retiree, is there anything I am required to do in order to continue receiving my pension benefits if my plan is 
trusteed?</h4>
<p>PBGC will make every effort to assure that your benefit payments continue without interruption until PBGC assumes control of 
the plan. You are not required to do anything until you receive a letter from PBGC requesting the information it needs in order to 
maintain plan records. PBGC, also will notify you if adjustments are necessary in the amount of your benefits because of the 
limitations on PBGC's guarantees.</p>
<h4>Q. What if I have not yet retired when PBGC becomes trustee of my plan?</h4>
<p>When PBGC becomes trustee of a terminated plan, it obtains a list of plan participants from the plan administrator. If you have 
changed your name or address, or if you believe that the plan administrator does not have the information PBGC will need to get 
in touch with you, send the plan administrator or PBGC the correct information. You may contact PBGC at the address in the 
front of this booklet. Please be sure to identify the name of your pension plan in all correspondence to PBGC. PBGC will 
contact you to let you know it has become trustee of your plan. You also will be informed of the amount of your benefit that 
PBGC will pay and the procedure for filing an application for benefits when you are ready to retire.</p>
<h4>Q. If I have further questions about PBGC and what it does for me, how can I find the answers?</h4>
<p>PBGC will be glad to answer questions you may have about its insurance programs or retirement guarantees. Write or call 
PBGC at the address or telephone number listed in the front of this booklet. However, for specific questions concerning your 
plan, contact your plan administrator. If PBGC has trusteed your plan, then PBGC will provide you with the name of a person to 
contact.</p>
<h4>PBGC MAXIMUM MONTHLY GUARANTEES </h4>
<p>Examples of the maximum guarantee for a single life annuity with no survivor benefits are shown for retirement at ages 65, 62, 60 
and 55. The maximum is further reduced if the benefit is paid in a form other than annuity for a single life alone such as a form that 
provides for survivor benefits. The actual guarantee limit will depend on a participant's date of birth and plan provisions.</p>

<p>The Federal Reserve Board and the Office of Thrift Supervision prepared this booklet on mortgage lock-ins in response to a 
request from the House Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs and in consultation with many other agencies and 
trade and consumer groups. It is designed to help consumers understand an important aspect of home financing.</p>
<p>We believe a fully informed consumer is in the best position to make a sound financial choice. This booklet will provide useful 
basic information about obtaining the terms of credit you really want. It cannot provide all the answers you will need, but we 
believe it is a good starting point.</p>
<h4>A Consumer's Guide to Mortgage Lock-Ins</h4>
<p>When you're looking for a mortgage, you're likely to shop among lenders for the most favorable interest rate, and the lowest 
points and other up-front charges. When you find the most favorable terms and the lender that you want, you'll apply to that 
lender. But when you get to settlement, will you actually receive the terms you applied or bargained for? Or will you find that the 
rate has changed-and that your costs have gone up?</p>
<p>Lock-ins on rates and points might offer you a way to ensure that what you shop for is what you get. This brochure explains 
what these arrangements mean.</p>
<h4>All About Lock-Ins</h4>
<p>In most cases, the terms you are quoted when you shop among lenders only represent the terms available to borrowers settling 
their loan agreement at the time of the quote. The quoted terms may not be the terms available to you at settlement weeks or 
even months later. Therefore, you should not rely on the terms quoted to you when shopping for a loan unless a lender is willing 
to offer a lock-in.</p>
<p>What Is a Lock-In? A lock-in, also called a rate-lock or rate commitment, is a lender's promise to hold a certain interest rate 
and a certain number of points for you, usually for a specified period of time, while your loan application is processed. (Points 
are additional charges imposed by the lender that are usually prepaid by the consumer at settlement but can sometimes be 
financed by adding them to the mortgage amount. One point equals one percent of the loan amount.) Depending upon the lender, 
you may be able to lock in the interest rate and number of points that you will be charged when you file your application, during 
processing of the loan, when the loan is approved, or later.</p>
<p>A lock-in that is given when you apply for a loan may be useful because it's likely to take your lender several weeks or longer to 
prepare, document, and evaluate your loan application. During that time, the cost of mortgages may change. But if your interest 
rate and points are locked in, you should be protected against increases while your application is processed. This protection 
could affect whether you can afford the mortgage. However, a locked-in rate could also prevent you from taking advantage of 
price decreases, unless your lender is willing to lock in a lower rate that becomes available during this period.</p>
<p>It is important to recognize that a lock-in is not the same as a loan commitment, although some loan commitments may contain a 
lock-in. A loan commitment is the lender's promise to make you a loan in a specific amount at some future time. Generally, you 
will receive the lender's commitment only after your loan application has been approved. This commitment usually will state the 
loan terms that have been approved (including loan amount), how long the commitment is valid, and the lenders conditions for 
making the loan such as receipt of a satisfactory title insurance policy protecting the lender.</p>
<p>Will Your Lock-In Be in Writing? Some lenders have preprinted forms that set out the exact terms of the lock-in agreement. 
Others may only make an oral lock-in promise on the telephone or at the time of application. Oral agreements can be very 
difficult to prove in the event of a dispute.</p>
<p>Some lenders' lock-in forms may contain crucial information that is difficult to understand or that is in fine print. For example, 
some lock-in agreements may become void through some unrelated action such as a change in the maximum rate for Veterans 
Administration guaranteed loans. Thus, it is wise to obtain a blank copy of a lenders lock-in form to read carefully before you 
apply for a loan. If possible, show the lock-in form to a lawyer or real estate professional. It is wise to obtain written, rather than 
verbal, lock-in agreements to make sure that you fully understand how your lender's lock-ins and loan commitments work and to 
have a tangible record of your arrangements with the lender This record may be useful in the event of a dispute.</p>
<p>Will You Be Charged for a Lock-In? Lenders may charge you a fee for locking in the rate of interest and number of points for 
your mortgage. Some lenders may charge you a fee up-front, and may not refund it if you withdraw your application, if your 
credit is denied, or if you do not close the loan. Others might charge the fee at settlement. The fee might be a flat fee, a 
percentage of the mortgage amount, or a fraction of a percentage point added to the rate you lock in. The amount of the fee and 
how it is charged will vary among lenders and may depend on the length of the lock-in period.</p>
<p>What Options Are Available for Setting the Mortgage Terms? Lenders may offer different options in establishing the interest rate 
and points that you will be charged, such as:</p>
<p>* Locked-In Interest Rate-Locked-In Points. Under this option, the lender lets you lock in both the interest rate and points 
quoted to you. This option may be considered to be a true lock-in because your mortgage terms should not increase above the 
interest rate and points that you've agreed upon even if market conditions change.</p>
<p>* Locked-In Interest Rate-Floating Points. Under this option, the lender lets you lock in the interest rate, while permitting or 
requiring the points to rise and fall (float) with changes in market conditions. If market interest rates drop during the lock-in 
period, the points may also fall. If they rise, the points may increase. Even if you float your points, your lender may allow you to 
lock-in the points at some time before settlement at whatever level is then current. (For instance, say you've locked in a 10 1/2 
percent interest rate, but not the 3 points that went with that rate. A month later, the market interest rate remains the same, but 
the points the lender charges for that rate have dropped to 2 1/2. With your lender's agreement, you could then lock in the lower 
2 1/2 points.) If you float your points and market interest rates increase by the time of settlement, the lender may charge a greater 
number of points for a loan at the rate you've locked in. In this case, the benefit you might have had by locking in your rate may 
be lost because you'll have to pay more in upfront costs.</p>
<p>* Floating Interest Rate-Floating Points. Under this option, the lender lets you lock in the interest rate and the points at some time 
after application but before settlement. If you think that rates will remain level or even go down, you may want to wait on locking 
in a particular rate and points. If rates go up, you should expect to be charged the higher rate.</p>
<p>Because practices vary, you may want to ask your lender whether there are other options available to you.</p>
<p>How Long Are Lock-Ins Valid? Usually the lender will promise to hold a certain interest rate and number of points for a given 
number of days, and to get these terms you must settle on the loan within that time period. Lock-ins of 30 to 60 days are 
common. But some lenders may offer a lock-in for only a short period of time (for example, 7 days after your loan is approved) 
while some others might offer longer lock-ins (up to 120 days). Lenders that charge a lock-in fee may charge a higher fee for the 
longer lock-in period. Usually, the longer the period, the greater the fee.</p>
<p>The lock-in period should be long enough to allow for settlement, and any other contingencies imposed by the lender, before the 
lock-in expires. Before deciding on the length of the lock-in to ask for, you should find out the average time for processing loans 
in your area and ask your lender to estimate (in writing, if possible) the time needed to process your loan. You'll also want to 
take into account any factors that might delay your settlement. These may include delays that you can anticipate in providing 
materials about your financial condition and, in case you are purchasing a new house, unanticipated construction delays. Finally, 
ask for a lock-in with as few contingencies as possible.</p>
<p>What Happens if the Lock-In Period Expires? If you don't settle within the lock-in period, you might lose the interest rate and 
the number of points you had locked in. This could happen if there are delays in processing whether they are caused by you, 
others involved in the settlement process, or the lender. For example, your loan approval could be delayed if the lender has to 
wait for any documents from you or from others such as employers, appraisers, termite inspectors, builders, and individuals 
selling the home. On occasion, lenders are themselves the cause of processing delays, particularly when loan demand is heavy. 
This sometimes happens when interest rates fall suddenly.</p>
<p>If your lock-in expires, most lenders will offer the loan based on the prevailing interest rate and points. If market conditions have 
caused interest rates to rise, most lenders will charge you more for your loan. One reason why some lenders may be unable to 
offer the lock-in rate after the period expires is that they can no longer sell the loan to investors at the lock-in rate. (When lenders 
lock in loan terms for borrowers, they often have an agreement with investors to buy these loans based on the lock-in terms. 
That agreement may expire around the same time that the lock-in expires and the lender may be unable to afford to offer the 
same terms if market rates have increased.) Lenders who intend to keep the loans they make may have more flexibility in those 
cases where settlement is not reached before the lock-in expires.</p>
<p>How Can You Speed Up the Approval of the Loan? While the lender has the greatest role in how fast your loan application is 
processed, there are certain things you can do to speed up its approval. Try to find out what documentation the lender will 
require from you.</p>
<p>Much of the information required by your lender can be brought with you when you apply for a loan. This may help to get your 
application moving more quickly through the process. When you first meet with your lender, be sure to bring the following 
documents:</p>
<p>* The purchase contract for the house (if you don't have the contract, check with your real estate agent or the seller).</p>
<p>* Your bank account numbers, the address of your bank branch and your latest bank statement, plus pay stubs, W-2 forms, or 
other proof of employment and salary, to help the lender check your finances.</p>
<p>* If you are self-employed, balance sheets, tax returns for 2-3 previous years, and other information about your business.</p>
<p>* Information about debts, including loan and credit card account numbers and the names and addresses of your creditors.</p>
<p>* Evidence of your mortgage or rental payments, such as cancelled checks.</p>
<p>* Certificate of Eligibility from the Veterans Administration if you want a VA-guaranteed loan. Your lender may be able to help 
you obtain this.</p>
<p>Be sure to respond promptly to your lender's requests for information while your loan is being processed. It is also a good idea 
to call the lender and real estate agent from time to time. By calling occasionally, you can check on the status of your application, 
and offer to help contact others such as employers who may need to provide documents and other information for your loan. It is 
also helpful to keep notes on your contacts with the lender so that you will have a record of your conversations.</p>
<h4>Ask About Lock-Ins</h4>
<p>When you're ready to settle on your loan, you'll want to get the loan terms that you've locked in. To increase that likelihood, it is 
important to learn as much as you can about what the lender is promising you before you apply for a loan. Ask for the following 
information when you shop for a loan:</p>
<h4>Lock-Ins and Fees</h4>
<p>* Does the lender offer a lock-in of the interest rate and points?</p>
<p>* When will the lender let you lock in the interest rate and points? When you apply? When the loan is approved?</p>
<p>* Will the lock-in be in writing? If the lock-in is not in writing, you will have no record of the lender's agreement with you in case 
of a dispute.</p>
<p>* Does the lender charge a fee to lock in your interest rate? Does the fee increase for longer lock-in periods? If so, how much?</p>
<p>* If you have locked in a rate, and the lender's rate drops, can you lock in at the lower rate? Does the lender charge you an 
additional fee to lock in the lower rate?</p>
<p>* Can you float your interest rate and points for now, and lock them in later?</p>
<h4>Loan Processing Time</h4>
<p>* How long does the lender expect to take to process your loan?</p>
<p>* What has been the lender's average time for processing loans recently?</p>
<p>* Has the lender's loan volume increased? Heavy volume might increase the lender's average processing time</p>
<p>. </p>
<h4>Expiration of Lock-Ins</h4>
<p>* What rate will be charged if the lock-in expires before settlement-the rate in effect when the lock-in expires?</p>
<p>* If you don't settle within the lock-in period, will the lender refund some or all of your application or lock-in fees if you decide to 
cancel the loan application?</p>
<p>* If your lock-in expires and you want to get another lock-in at the rate in effect at the time of the expiration, will the lender 
charge an additional fee for the second lock-in?</p>
<h4>Complaints About Lock-Ins</h4>
<p>Knowing what to look for puts you in a better position to decide whether, when, and how long to lock in mortgage terms. Also, 
by helping to keep the loan process moving, you can lessen the chance that your lock-in will run out before settlement.</p>
<p>But what if your lock-in does lapse? If you believe that the lapse was due to delays caused by the lender or someone else 
involved in the loan process, you should try first to reach a mutually satisfactory agreement with the lender. If that effort fails, 
consider writing to the appropriate state or federal regulatory agency.</p>
<p>Some lender actions, such as offering lock-in terms which are impossible to fulfill, failing to process your loan diligently, or 
causing your lock-in to expire are improper--and may even be illegal. In addition, because you may have contractual rights under 
your lock-in or loan commitment, you may want to consult with an attorney. Be aware, though, that complaints may not be 
resolved as quickly as may be necessary for a home purchase.</p>
<p>Depending upon their authority under applicable state or federal law, regulatory agencies may either attempt to help you resolve 
your complaint directly or record your complaint and recommend other action.</p>
<h4>State Agencies</h4>
<p>State consumer protection offices, banking authorities, and offices of the attorney general can be contacted regarding complaints 
against many lenders doing business in the state. (Some states have enacted legislation to specifically address complaints about 
mortgage lock-ins.)</p>
<h4>Federal Agencies</h4>

<p>The Federal Reserve Board and the Office of Thrift Supervision prepared this booklet on refinancing your mortgage in response 
to a request from the House Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs and in consultation with many other agencies and 
trade and consumer groups. It is designed to help consumers understand an important aspect of home financing.</p>
<p>We believe a fully informed consumer is in the best position to make a sound financial choice. If you are considering refinancing 
your home loan, this booklet will provide useful basic information about refinancing. It cannot provide all the answers you will 
need, but we believe it is a good stoning point.</p>
<h4>A Consumer's Guide to Mortgage Refinancings</h4>
<p>If you are a homeowner who was lucky enough to buy when mortgage rates were low, you may have no interest in refinancing 
your present loan. But perhaps you bought your home when rates were higher. Or perhaps you have an adjustable&#169;rate loan 
and would like to obtain different terms.</p>
<p>Should you refinance? This brochure will answer some questions that may help you decide. If you do refinance, the process will 
remind you of what you went through in obtaining the original mortgage. That's because, in reality, refinancing a mortgage is 
simply taking out a new mortgage. You will encounter many of the same procedures&#169;and the same types of costs-the second 
time around.</p>
<h4>Would Refinancing Be Worth It?</h4>
<p>Refinancing can be worthwhile, but it does not make good financial sense for everyone. A general role of thumb is that 
refinancing becomes worth your while if the current interest rate on your mortgage is at least 2 percentage points higher than the 
prevailing market rate. This figure is generally accepted as the safe margin when balancing the costs of refinancing a mortgage 
against the savings.</p>
<p>There are other considerations, too, such as how long you plan to stay in the house. Most sources say that it takes at least three 
years to realize fully the savings from a lower interest rate, given the costs of the refinancing. (Depending on your loan amount 
and the particular circumstances, however, you might choose to refinance a loan that is only 1.5 percentage points higher than the 
current rate. You may even find you could recoup the refinancing costs in a shorter time.)</p>
<h4>Refinancing can be a good idea for homeowners who:</h4>
<p>* want to get out of a high interest rate loan to take advantage of lower rates. This is a good idea only if they intend to stay in the 
house long enough to make the additional fees worthwhile.</p>
<p>* have an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) and want a fixed-rate loan to have the certainty of knowing exactly what the 
mortgage payment will be for the life of the loan.</p>
<p>* want to convert to an ARM with a lower interest rate or more protective features (such as a better rate and payment caps) 
than the ARM they currently have.</p>
<p>* want to build up equity more quickly by converting to a loan with a shorter term.</p>
<p>* want to draw on the equity built up in their house to get cash for a major purchase or for their children's education.</p>
<p>If you decide that refinancing is not worth the costs, ask your lender whether you may be able to obtain all or some of the new 
terms you want by agreeing to a modification of your existing loan instead of a refinancing.</p>
<h4>Should You Refinance Your ARM?</h4>
<p>In deciding whether to refinance an ARM you should consider these questions:</p>
<p>* Is the next interest rate adjustment on your existing loan likely to increase your monthly payments substantially? Will the new 
interest rate be two or three percentage points higher than the prevailing rates being offered for either fixed-rate loans or other 
ARMs?</p>
<p>* If the current mortgage sets a cap on your monthly payments, are those payments large enough to pay off your loan by the end 
of the original term? Will refinancing to a new ARM or a fixed-rate loan enable you to pay your loan in full by the end of the 
term?</p>
<h4>What Are the Costs of Refinancing?</h4>
<p>The fees described below are the charges that you are most likely to encounter in a refinancing.</p>
<p>* Application Fee. This charge imposed by your lender covers the initial costs of processing your loan request and checking your 
credit report.</p>
<p>* Title Search and Title Insurance.<br>
This charge will cover the cost of examining the public record to confirm ownership of the real estate. It also covers the cost of a 
policy, usually issued by a title insurance company, that insures the policy holder in a specific amount for any loss caused by 
discrepancies in the title to the property.</p>
<p>Be sure to ask the company carrying the present policy if it can re-issue your policy at a re-issue rate. You could save up to 70 
percent of what it would cost you for a new policy.</p>
<p>Because costs may vary significantly from area to area and from lender to lender, the following are estimates only. Your actual 
closing costs may be higher or lower than the ranges indicated below.</p>
<p>Application Fee $75 to $300<br>
Appraisal Fee $150 to $400<br>
Survey Costs $125 to $300<br>
Homeowner's Hazard Insurance $300 to $600<br>
Lender's Attorney's<br>
Review Fees $75 to $200<br>
Title Search and<br>
Title Insurance $450 to $600<br>
Home Inspection Fees $175 to $350<br>
Loan Origination Fees 1% of loan<br>
Mortgage Insurance 0.5% to 1.0%<br>
Points 1% to 3%<br>
* Lender's Attorney's Review Fees.<br>
The lender will usually charge you for fees paid to the lawyer or company that conducts the closing for the lender. Settlements 
are conducted by lending institutions, title insurance companies, escrow companies, real estate brokers, and attorneys for the 
buyer and seller. In most situations, the person conducting the settlement is providing a service to the lender. You may also be 
required to pay for other legal services relating to your loan which are provided to the lender. You may want to retain your own 
attorney to represent you at all stages of the transaction including settlement.</p>
<p>* Loan Origination Fees and Points.</p>
<p>The origination fee is charged for the lenders work in evaluating and preparing your mortgage loan. Points are prepaid finance 
charges imposed by the lender at closing to increase the lender's yield beyond the stated interest rate on the mortgage note. One 
point equals one percent of the loan amount. For example, one point on a $75,000 loan would be $750. In some cases, the 
points you pay can be financed by adding them to the loan amount. The total number of points a lender charges will depend on 
market conditions and the interest rate to be charged.</p>
<p>* Appraisal Fee. This fee pays for an appraisal which is a supportable and defensible estimate or opinion of the value of the 
property.</p>
<p>* Prepayment Penalty. A prepayment penalty on your present mortgage could be the greatest deterrent to refinancing. The 
practice of charging money for an early pay-off of the existing mortgage loan varies by state, type of lender, and type of loan. 
Prepayment penalties are forbidden on various loans including loans from federally chartered credit unions, FHA and VA loans, 
and some other home-purchase loans. The mortgage documents for your existing loan will state if there is a penalty for 
prepayment. In some loans, you may be charged interest for the full month in which you prepay your loan.</p>
<p>* Miscellaneous. Depending on the type of loan you have and other factors, another major expense you might face is the fee for 
a VA loan guarantee, FHA mortgage insurance, or private mortgage insurance. There are a few other closing costs in addition to 
these.</p>
<p>In conclusion, a homeowner should plan on paying an average of 3 to 6 percent of the outstanding principal in refinancing costs, 
plus any prepayment penalties and the costs of paying off any second mortgages that may exist.</p>
<p>One way of saving on some of these costs is to check first with the lender who holds your current mortgage. The lender may be 
willing to waive some of them, especially if the work relating to the mortgage closing is still current. This could include the fees for 
the title search, surveys, inspections, and so on.</p>
<p>The information contained in this brochure is intended to help you ask the right questions when considering a possible refinancing 
of your loan. It is not a replacement for professional advice. Talk with mortgage lenders, real estate agents, attorneys, and other 
advisors about lending practices, mortgage instruments, and your own interests before you commit to any specific loan.</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Advance-Fee Loan Scams -- October 1993</h2>
<p><i>Produced in cooperation with Call For Action, Inc., a Washington, D.C.-based international network of radio and 
television consumer hotlines</i></p>
<p>Beware of advertisements for &quot;advance-fee&quot; or &quot;guaranteed&quot; consumer and small-business loans. This brochure tells how to 
recognize ads for advance-fee loan scams and how to distinguish them from offers by legitimate credit grantors. It also tells you 
how to protect yourself, what to do if you are a victim, and where you can find low-cost help in dealing with credit problems.</p>
<h4>How to Recognize an &quot;Advance-Fee&quot; Loan Scam</h4>
<p>Advertisements that promise loans generally appear in the classified section of local and national newspapers, magazines, and 
tabloids. They also may appear in mailings, radio spots and on local cable channels. Often &quot;900&quot; numbers that result in charges 
on your phone bill, or toll-free &quot;800&quot; numbers, are featured in the ads. However, simply advertising through recognized media 
outlets does not ensure the legitimacy of the company behind an ad. In addition, such companies often use delivery systems other 
than the U.S. Postal Service, such as overnight or courier services, to avoid detection and prosecution by postal authorities.</p>
<p>Some companies claim they can guarantee you a loan for a fee paid in advance. The fee may range from $100 to several 
hundred dollars. Small businesses have been charged as much as several thousand dollars as an advance fee for a loan. But 
whether you are an individual consumer or a small business owner, the result is the same: once the con artists have your money, 
they disappear and you never get your loan.</p>
<p>Do not confuse advance-fee loan schemes with legitimate offers of credit from mortgage brokers, banks, savings and loans, and 
credit unions. Legitimate credit grantors may charge fees to process your loan application, but they will not guarantee that you 
will qualify for a loan. Illicit advance-fee loan schemes, on the other hand, either promise or strongly suggest that a loan will be 
provided in exchange for an up-front fee. Salespeople for such companies also may verbally promise that some or all of your 
advance fee will be refunded if your application is unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Some fraudulent companies also may claim that your advance fee will be credited toward repayment of the loan. Usually none of 
these claims is true.</p>
<h4>How to Protect Yourself</h4>
<p>The FTC suggests the following precautions before you respond to ads for advance-fee loans.</p>
<p>Be wary of advertising that claims that bad credit is no problem in getting you a loan. If money is not available to you through 
traditional lending institutions, it is unlikely to become available in response to a classified ad.</p>
<p>Be cautious of lenders who use &quot;800&quot; and &quot;900&quot; numbers. You may call an &quot;800&quot; number which then directs you to dial a &quot;900&quot; 
number. You pay for &quot;900&quot; number calls, of course, and the charges may be high.</p>
<p>Check out the company. Contact your local consumer protection agency and the state Attorney General's Office to learn if they 
have received any complaints about companies offering advance-fee loans. Keep in mind, however, that suspect companies 
often establish their operations in one state, advertise heavily for only a few months, collect their loan fees, only to close up shop 
and move on to another state before complaints are registered and local authorities have a chance to act. Therefore, just because 
your local consumer protection agency has no complaints on file does not mean that an advance-fee loan business is legitimate.</p>
<h4>Be careful about making any loan agreements over the telephone.</h4>
<p>Do not give your credit card, checking account, or Social Security numbers over the phone unless you are familiar with the 
company. This information can be used against you with other frauds. For example, if you give your checking account number 
over the phone to a stranger for &quot;verification&quot; or &quot;computer purposes,&quot; the number may be used to debit (withdraw) money from 
your checking account.Ask to review any company's offer in writing, and make sure you understand the terms of the agreement 
before you complete the transaction.</p>
<h4>What to Do if You Are a Victim</h4>
<p>If you believe you have been victimized by a fraudulent advance-fee loan operation, contact your local consumer protection 
agency, Better Business Bureau (BBB), state Attorney General and Call For Action (202/537-0585; TDD 202/537-1551) to

<p>You also may file a complaint with the FTC by writing to: Correspondence Branch, Federal Trade Commission, Washington,

<h4>Where to Find Low-Cost Help for Credit Problems</h4>
<p>First, try to solve your debt problems with your creditors as soon as you realize you will not be able to make your payments. If 
you cannot resolve your credit problems yourself or need additional assistance, you may want to contact a Consumer Credit 
Counseling Service (CCCS) office -- a nonprofit organization with more than 850 offices located in 50 states that counsels 
indebted consumers. CCCS counselors will try to arrange a repayment plan that is acceptable to you and your creditors. They 
also will help you set up a realistic budget and plan for expenditures. These counseling offices, funded by contributions from 
credit-granting institutions, are offered at little or no cost to consumers. Check the White Pages of your telephone directory to 
get the number for the CCCS office nearest you, or call 1-800-388-2227 using a touch-tone phone. If you have other questions, 
write or call:</p>
<p>National Foundation for Consumer Credit 8611 Second Avenue, Suite 100 Silver Spring, MD 20910 (301) 589-5001</p>
<p>In addition, non-profit counseling programs sometimes are operated by universities, military bases, credit unions, and housing 
authorities. They are likely to charge little or nothing for their assistance. Or, you can check with your local bank or consumer 
protection office to see if it has a listing of reputable, low-cost financial counseling services.</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Cosigning a Loan -- November 1992</h2>
<p>What would you do if a friend or relative asked you to cosign a loan? Before you give your answer, make sure you understand 
what cosigning involves. Under a Federal Trade Commission rule, creditors are required to give you a notice to help explain your 
obligations. The cosigner's notice says:</p>
<p>You are being asked to guarantee this debt. Think carefully before you do. If the borrower doesn't pay the debt, you will have 
to. Be sure you can afford to pay if you have to, and that you want to accept this responsibility.</p>
<p>You may have to pay up to the full amount of the debt if the borrower does not pay. You may also have to pay late fees or 
collection costs, which increase this amount.</p>
<p>The creditor can collect this debt from you without first trying to collect from the borrower.* The creditor can use the same 
collection methods against you that can be used against the borrower, such as suing you, garnishing your wages, etc. If this debt 
is ever in default, that fact may become a part of your credit record.</p>
<p>This notice is not the contract that makes you liable for the debt.</p>
<p>*Depending on your state, this may not apply. If state law forbids a creditor from collecting from a cosigner without first trying to 
collect from the primary debtor, this sentence may be crossed out or omitted on your cosigner notice.</p>
<h4>Cosigners Often Pay</h4>
<p>Some studies of certain types of lenders show that for cosigned loans that go into default, as many as three out of four cosigners 
are asked to repay the loan. That statistic should not surprise you. When you are asked to cosign, you are being asked to take a 
risk that a professional lender will not take. The lender would not require a cosigner if the borrower met the lender's criteria for 
making a loan.</p>
<p>In most states, if you do cosign and your friend or relative misses a payment, the lender can collect from you immediately without 
pursuing the borrower first. And the amount you owe may be increased -- by late charges or by attorneys' fees -- if the lender 
decides to sue to collect. If the lender wins the case, he or she may be able to take your wages and property.</p>
<h4>If You Do Cosign</h4>
<p>Despite the risks, there may be times when you decide to cosign. Perhaps your son or daughter needs a first loan, or a close 
friend needs help. Here are a few things to consider before you cosign.</p>
<p>Be sure you can afford to pay the loan. If you are asked to pay and cannot, you could be sued or your credit rating could be 
damaged.</p>
<p>Before you cosign a loan, consider that even if you are not asked to repay the debt, your liability for this loan may keep you from 
getting other credit you may want.</p>
<p>Before you pledge property, such as your automobile or furniture, to secure the loan, make sure you understand the 
consequences. If the borrower defaults, you could lose these possessions.</p>
<p>You may want to ask the lender to calculate the specific amount of money you might owe. The lender does not have to do this, 
but some will if asked. You also may be able to negotiate the specific terms of your obligation. For example, you might want to 
have your liability limited to paying the principal balance on the loan, but not late charges, court costs, or attorneys' fees. In this 
case, ask the lender to include a statement in the contract like this: &quot;The cosigner will be responsible only for the principal balance 
on this loan at the time of default.&quot;</p>
<p>You may want to ask the lender to agree, in writing, to notify you if the borrower misses a payment. In this way, you will have 
time to deal with the problem or make back payments without having to repay the whole amount immediately.</p>
<p>Make sure you get copies of all important papers, such as the loan contract, the Truth-in-Lending Disclosure Statement, and any 
warranties if you are cosigning for a purchase. You may need these if there is a dispute between the borrower and the seller. 
Because the lender is not required to give you these papers, you may have to get copies from the borrower.</p>
<p>Check your state law. Some states have laws giving you additional rights as a cosigner.</p>
<p>The Federal Trade Commission enforces a number of federal laws involving consumer credit for which free publications are 
available. If you would like additional information concerning debt, ask for the following FTC publications: Credit Practices Rule 
and Solving Credit Problems. Write to: Public Reference, Federal Trade Commission, Washington, D.C. 20580.</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Getting a Loan: Your Home as Security -- February 1992</h2>
<p>If you need a personal loan and are thinking about using your home as security, you should know about a credit law that gives 
you extra time to reconsider the loan agreement. When you use your home as collateral for a loan, you generally have the right to 
cancel the credit transaction within three business days. This is called your &quot;right of rescission,&quot; and it is guaranteed by the 
Federal Truth in Lending Act.</p>
<p>The right of rescission gives you three extra days to reconsider whether you want to use your home to guarantee repayment for a 
personal loan. The right applies even if your home is a condominium, mobile home, or house boat, as long as it is your principal 
residence. The right applies to certain installment loans where you borrow a fixed amount and repay the debt on an agreed 
payment schedule as well as to home equity credit lines -- a form of revolving credit in which your home serves as collateral.</p>
<h4>What Rescinding a Credit Transaction Means</h4>
<p>Rescinding a credit transaction means you are canceling the deal. In other words, you decide that you do not want the loan or the 
service being financed.</p>
<p>You can rescind the credit transaction within three days for any reason. For example, you may find better credit terms, such as a 
loan that offers a lower interest rate or does not require the use of your home as collateral.</p>
<h4>How to Rescind a Credit Transaction</h4>
<p>Unless you waive your right of rescission, you have until midnight of the third business day after the transaction to cancel the 
contract. The first day after all three of the following events occurs counts as Day One:</p>
<p>1. You sign the credit contract.</p>
<p>2. You receive a Truth in Lending disclosure form containing certain important disclosures about the credit contract. These 
disclosures explain the key terms of the credit being offered: the annual percentage rate; the finance charge; the amount financed; 
the total of payments; and the payment schedule.</p>
<p>3. You receive two copies of a notice explaining your right to rescind.</p>
<p>You should be aware that for rescission purposes, business days include Saturdays, but not Sundays or legal public holidays. For 
example, if the last of the above three events occurs on a Friday, you have until midnight on the following Tuesday to rescind.</p>
<p>During this waiting period, your creditor should not take any action on your transaction. For example, the creditor should not 
give you the money from the loan or, if your are dealing with a home improvement loan, the contractor should not deliver any 
materials or start work.</p>
<p>If you decide to exercise your right of rescission, you must notify the creditor in writing that you are canceling the contract. You 
may use the form provided to you by the creditor, a letter, or a telegram. Whatever form of written notice you use, make sure it 
is delivered, mailed, or filed for telegraphic transmission before midnight of the third business day.</p>
<p>Remember: You cannot rescind just by telephoning or visiting the creditor.</p>
<p>If you never receive the disclosures or the notice of rescission from the creditor (see numbers 2 and 3 above), you can cancel at 
any time during the first three years after you sign the credit contract, or before you sell your home -- whichever occurs first.</p>
<h4>What Happens When You Rescind</h4>
<p>Within 20 days after a creditor receives your notice of rescission, all money or property you paid as part of the credit transaction 
must be returned to you. The creditor also must release any security interest in your home.</p>
<p>If you have received money or property (such as building materials) from the creditor, keep it until the creditor proves that your 
home is no longer being held as collateral and returns any money you already have paid. For example, the creditor may show 
you a release of a lien previously filed with your city or county clerk's office to prove your house is no longer collateral. You must 
then offer to return the creditor's money or property. If the creditor does not claim the money or property within 20 days, you 
may keep it.</p>
<h4>Waiving Your Right to Rescind</h4>
<p>Sometimes you may have a financial emergency and not be able to wait for the creditor to slow the loan process by suspending 
action for three business days. For example, you may need to borrow money quickly to have a damaged roof or house 
foundation repaired.</p>
<p>The law allows you to waive your right of rescission if you have a &quot;bona fide personal financial emergency.&quot; This enables you to 
have the loan process speeded up to meet the emergency situation. To avail yourself of this right, you must give the creditor your 
own written statement (pre-printed forms are not allowed) describing the emergency and clearly stating that you are waiving your 
right to rescind. The statement must be dated and signed by you and anyone else who shares in the ownership of the home. 
Consider your decisions carefully: If you waive your right to rescind, you must go ahead with the credit transaction.</p>
<h4>Typical Situations With No Right of Rescission</h4>
<p>The right of rescission does not apply in all cases where your home is used as collateral for the loan. You do not have the right of 
rescission when:</p>
<p>you apply for a loan to purchase or build your principal home;</p>
<p>you consolidate or refinance with the same creditor a loan that is already secured by your home, and no additional funds are 
borrowed; or a state agency is the creditor for the loan.</p>
<p>Even in these cases, however, you may have cancellation or &quot;cooling-off&quot; rights under state or local law.</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Home Equity Credit Lines -- June 1992</h2>
<p>Using a credit line to borrow against the equity in your home has become a popular source of consumer credit. And lenders are 
offering these home equity credit lines in a variety of ways. You will find most loans come with variable interest rates, some come 
with attractive low introductory rates, and a few come with fixed rates. You also may find most loans have large one-time upfront 
fees, others have closing costs, and some have continuing costs, such as annual fees. You can find loans with large balloon 
payments at the end of the loan, and others with no balloons but with higher monthly payments.</p>
<p>No one loan is right for every homeowner. The challenge, then, is to contact different lenders, compare options, and select the 
home equity credit line best tailored to your needs.</p>
<p>Be sure to review the home equity contract carefully before you sign it. Do not hesitate to ask questions about the terms and 
conditions of your financing. To help you do this, you may want to consider the following questions and to use the checklist at the 
end of this brochure. (We apologize that the checklist is not available on-line. To obtain a copy of the checklist, please request a 
free copy of the brochure by contacting: Public Reference, Federal Trade Commission, Washington, D.C. 20580; (202) 
326-2222. TDD call (202) 326-2502.)</p>
<h4>Is a Home Equity Credit Line for You?</h4>
<p>If you need to borrow money, home equity lines may be one useful source of credit. Initially at least, they may provide you with 
large amounts of cash at relatively low interest rates. And they may provide you with certain tax advantages unavailable with 
other kinds of loans. (Check with your tax adviser for details.) At the same time, home equity lines of credit require you to use 
your home as collateral for the loan. This may put your home at risk if you are late or cannot make your monthly payments. 
Those loans with a large final (balloon) payment may lead you to borrow more money to pay off this debt, or they may put your 
home in jeopardy if you cannot qualify for refinancing. And, if you sell your home, most plans require you to pay off your credit 
line at that time. In addition, because home equity loans give you relatively easy access to cash, you might find you borrow 
money more freely.</p>
<p>Remember too, there are other ways to borrow money from a lending institution. For example, you may want to explore second 
mortgage installment loans. Although these plans also place an additional mortgage on your home, second mortgage money 
usually is loaned in a lump sum, rather than in a series of advances made available by writing checks on an account. Also, second 
mortgages usually have fixed interest rates and fixed payment amounts.</p>
<p>You also may want to explore borrowing from credit lines that do not use your home as collateral. These are available with your 
credit cards or with unsecured credit lines that let you write checks as you need the money. In addition, you may want to ask 
about loans for specific items, such as cars or tuition.</p>
<h4>How Much Money Can You Borrow on a Home Equity Credit Line?</h4>
<p>Depending on your creditworthiness (your income, credit rating, etc.) and the amount of your outstanding debt, home equity 
lenders may let you borrow up to 85% of the appraised value of your home minus the amount you still owe on your first 
mortgage. Ask the lender about the length of the home equity loan, whether there is a minimum withdrawal requirement when you 
open your account, and whether there are minimum or maximum withdrawal requirements after your account is opened. Inquire 
how you gain access to your credit line -- with checks, credit cards, or both. Also, find out if your home equity plan sets a fixed 
time -- a draw period -- when you can make withdrawals from your account. Once the draw period expires, you may be able to 
renew your credit line. If you cannot, you will not be permitted to borrow additional funds. Also, in some plans, you may have to 
pay your full outstanding balance. In others, you may be able to repay the balance over a fixed time.</p>
<h4>What is the Interest Rate on the Home Equity Loan?</h4>
<p>Interest rates for loans differ, so it pays to check with several lenders for the lowest rate. Compare the annual percentage rate 
(APR), which indicates the cost of credit on a yearly basis. Be aware that the advertised APR for home equity credit lines is 
based on interest alone. For a true comparison of credit costs, compare other charges, such as points and closing costs, which 
will add to the cost of your home equity loan. This is especially important if you are comparing a home equity credit line with a 
traditional installment (or second) mortgage, where the APR includes the total credit costs for the loan. In addition, ask about the 
type of interest rates available for the home equity plan. Most home equity credit lines have variable interest rates. These variable 
rates may offer lower monthly payments at first, but during the rest of the repayment period the payments may change and may 
be higher. Fixed interest rates, if available, may be slightly higher initially than variable rates, but fixed rates offer stable monthly 
payments over the life of the credit line.</p>
<p>If you are considering a variable rate, check and compare the terms. Check the periodic cap, which is the limit on interest rate 
changes at one time. Also, check the lifetime cap, which is the limit on interest rate changes throughout the loan term. Ask the 
lender which index is used and how much and how often it can change. An index (such as the prime rate) is used by lenders to 
determine how much to raise or lower interest rates. Also, check the margin, which is an amount added to the index that 
determines the interest you are charged. In addition, inquire whether you can convert your variable rate loan to a fixed rate at 
some future time.</p>
<p>Sometimes, lenders offer a temporarily discounted interest rate -- a rate that is unusually low and lasts only for an introductory 
period, such as six months. During this time, your monthly payments are lower too. After the introductory period ends, however, 
your rate (and payments) increase to the true market level (the index plus the margin). So, ask if the rate you are offered is 
&quot;discounted,&quot; and if so, find out how the rate will be determined at the end of the discount period and how much larger your 
payments could be at that time.</p>
<h4>What Are the Upfront Closing Costs?</h4>
<p>When you take out a home equity line of credit, you pay for many of the same expenses as when you financed your original 
mortgage. These include items such as an application fee, title search, appraisal, attorneys' fees, and points (a percentage of the 
amount you borrow). These expenses can add substantially to the cost of your loan, especially if you ultimately borrow little from 
your credit line. You may want to negotiate with lenders to see if they will pay for some of these expenses.</p>
<h4>What Are the Continuing Costs?</h4>
<p>In addition to upfront closing costs, some lenders require you to pay continuing fees throughout the life of the loan. These may 
include an annual membership or participation fee, which is due whether or not you use the account, and/or a transaction fee, 
which is charged each time you borrow money. These fees add to the overall cost of the loan.</p>
<h4>What Are the Repayment Terms During the Loan?</h4>
<p>As you pay back the loan, your payments may change if your credit line has a variable interest rate, even if you do not borrow 
more money from your account. Find out how often and how much your payments can change. You also will want to know 
whether you are paying back both principal and interest, or interest only. Even if you are paying back some principal, ask 
whether your monthly payments will cover the full amount borrowed or whether you will owe an additional payment of principal 
at the end of the loan. In addition, you may want to ask about penalties for late payments and under what conditions the lender 
can consider you in default and demand immediate full payment.</p>
<h4>What Are the Repayment Terms at the End of the Loan?</h4>
<p>Ask whether you might owe a large payment at the end of your loan term. If so, and you are not sure you will be able to afford 
the balloon payment, you may want to renegotiate your repayment terms. When you take out the loan, ask about the conditions 
for renewal of the plan or for refinancing the unpaid balance. Consider asking the lender to agree ahead of time and in writing to 
refinance any end-of-loan balance or extend your repayment time, if necessary.</p>
<h4>What Safeguards Are Built Into the Loan?</h4>
<p>One of the best protections you have is the Federal Truth in Lending Act, which requires lenders to inform you about the terms 
and costs of the plan at the time you are given an application. Lenders must disclose the APR and payment terms and must 
inform you of charges to open or use the account, such as an appraisal, a credit report, or attorneys' fees. Lenders also must tell 
you about any variable-rate feature and give you a brochure describing the general features of home equity plans. The Truth in 
Lending Act also protects you from changes in the terms of the account (other than a variable-rate feature) before the plan is 
opened. If you decide not to enter into the plan because of a change in terms, all fees you paid earlier must be returned to you.</p>
<p>Because your home is at risk when you open a home equity credit account, you have three days to cancel the transaction, for any 
reason. To cancel, you must inform the lender in writing. Following that, your credit line must be cancelled and all fees you have 
paid must be returned.</p>
<p>Once your home equity plan is opened, if you pay as agreed, the lender, in most cases, may not terminate your plan, accelerate 
payment of your outstanding balance, or change the terms of your account. The lender may halt credit advances on your account 
during any period in which interest rates exceed the maximum rate cap in your agreement, if your contract permits this practice.</p>
<h4>For More Information</h4>
<p>If you have questions about home equity credit lines, write to: Correspondence Branch, Federal Trade Commission, 
Washington, D.C. 20580. Although the FTC generally does not intervene in individual disputes, the information you provide may 
indicate a pattern or practice that requires action by the Commission.</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Home Financing Primer -- December 1993</h2>
<p>Prepared in cooperation with the Mortgage Bankers Association of America</p>
<p>If you are thinking about buying a house, especially your first one, you may have some basic questions about the home-financing 
process. The following answers may help. You also may want to obtain some of the free or low-cost information listed at the end 
of this brochure.</p>
<h4>How large a mortgage will you be able to get?</h4>
<p>A general rule is that you usually can qualify for a mortgage loan of two to two and one-half times your household's income. For 
example, if your family has an income of $30,000 a year, you can usually qualify for a mortgage of $60,000 to $75,000. Lenders 
use many other factors to determine how large a mortgage they will give you. For example, lenders generally prefer that your 
housing expenses (including mortgage payments, insurance, taxes, and special assessments) not exceed 25 to 28 percent of your 
gross monthly income. Other long-term debt (monthly payments extending more than 10 months) added to your housing 
expenses should not exceed 33 to 36 percent of your gross monthly income. Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and 
Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) mortgage loan percentages may vary.</p>
<p>In addition, lenders want to know about your employment and credit history. This includes finding out about your job and income 
and how well you handled and repaid loans in the past. Legal safeguards exist to ensure this information is used fairly. For 
example, the Fair Credit Reporting Act states that lenders must certify to the credit bureau the purpose for which this information 
is sought and that it will be used for no other purpose. The Equal Credit Opportunity Act prohibits discrimination in lending 
based on sex, marital status, race, national origin, religion, age, or because someone receives public assistance.</p>
<p>How much money will you need for a downpayment and closing costs? Lenders usually expect you to be able to make a 
downpayment of between 10 and 20 percent of the house's price and to pay closing costs, often three to six percent of the loan 
amount. If you make a downpayment of as little as five percent but less than 20 percent, the lender will require you to pay for 
private mortgage insurance. (Requirements for VA or FHA loans may differ.) Under the federal Real Estate Settlement 
Procedures Act, the lender must provide you with information on known and estimated closing costs.</p>
<h4>How do you shop for mortgage loans?</h4>
<p>Mortgage packages vary widely, and it is important to investigate several options to find the one best for you. If, for example, 
you are using a real estate agent or broker to shop for a home, you may want to consider their suggestions about lenders and 
mortgage packages. Check real estate or business newspaper sections, which may include brief tables on mortgage availability. 
Look in the Yellow Pages under &quot;Mortgages&quot; for a list of mortgage lenders in your area. Call several lenders for rates and terms 
on the type of mortgage you want. In addition, consider trying a commercial &quot;computerized mortgage shopping service,&quot; although 
such a list may reflect only a selection of lenders and you may be charged a fee.</p>
<p>Compare the mortgages offered by several lenders before you apply for a loan. Most lenders require you to pay a fee when you 
file your loan application. The amount of this fee varies, but it can be $100 to $300. Some lenders do not refund this fee if you 
are not approved for the loan, or if you decide not to accept the loan terms offered. Before you apply, ask the lender whether 
they charge an application fee, how much it is, and under what circumstances and to what extent it is refundable.</p>
<h4>What kind of mortgage should you select?</h4>
<p>There are two major types of mortgage loans -- those with fixed interest rates and monthly payments and those with changing 
rates and payments. However, there are many variations of these plans on the market, and you should shop carefully for the 
mortgage that best suits your needs.</p>
<p>Common fixed-rate mortgages include 30-year, 15-year, and bi-weekly mortgages. The 30-year mortgage usually offers the 
lowest monthly payments of fixed-rate loans, with a fixed monthly payment schedule.</p>
<p>The 15-year fixed-rate mortgage enables you to own your home in half the time and for less than half the total interest costs of a 
30-year loan. These loans, however, often require higher monthly payments.</p>
<p>The bi-weekly mortgage shortens the loan term from 30 years to 18 to 19 years by requiring a payment for half the monthly 
amount every two weeks. While you pay about 8 percent more a year towards the loan's principal than you would with the 
30-year, one-payment-per-month loan, you pay substantially less interest over the life of the loan. Keep in mind, however, that 
with shorter-term loans, you trade lower total costs for smaller mortgage interest deductions on your income tax. Mortgages with 
changing interest rates and/or monthly payments exist in many forms. The adjustable rate mortgage (ARM) is probably the most 
common, and there are many types of ARM loans available. The ARM usually offers interest rates and monthly payments that 
are initially lower than fixed-rate mortgages. But these rates and payments can fluctuate, often annually, according to changes in a 
pre-determined &quot;index&quot; -- commonly the rate of return on U.S. Government Treasury bills.</p>
<p>Some adjustable loans, for a fee, contain a provision permitting you to convert later to a fixed-rate loan. Another type of 
mortgage loan carries a fixed-interest rate for a number of years, often seven, before adjusting to a new interest rate for the 
remainder of the loan. A &quot;buydown&quot; or &quot;discounted mortgage&quot; is another type of loan with an initially reduced interest rate which 
increases to a higher fixed rate or to an adjustable rate usually within one to three years. For example, in a &quot;lender buydown,&quot; the 
lender offers lower monthly payments during the first few years of the loan.</p>
<h4>What features should you compare with different mortgage loan packages?</h4>
<p>Probably the single most important factor to look for when shopping for a home mortgage is the annual percentage rate, or the 
&quot;APR.&quot; The APR includes all the costs of credit, including such items as interest, &quot;points&quot; (fees often charged when a mortgage is 
closed), and mortgage insurance (when included in the loan). Lenders must disclose the APR under the Truth in Lending Act. 
The lower the APR, generally the lower the cost of your loan. Advertisements that state other rates such as &quot;simple&quot; interest 
rates, do not include all the costs of the loan. If you shop for a mortgage loan with interest rates or payments that change, be sure 
to compare:</p>
<p>initial interest rates;</p>
<p>the &quot;cap&quot; -- or how much the interest rate can increase/decrease over the life of the loan, and how much the rate can change at 
each adjustment;</p>
<p>how often the interest rate can change;</p>
<p>how much and how often the monthly payments and term of the loan can change;</p>
<p>what index is used to determine the rate changes;</p>
<p>what &quot;margin&quot; is used -- or how much additional a lender can add to the adjusted interest rate;</p>
<p>the limits, if any, on &quot;negative amortization&quot; -- the loss of equity in your home when low monthly payments do not cover fully the 
interest rate charges agreed upon in the mortgage contract; and</p>
<p>any &quot;balloon&quot; payments -- a large payment at the end of your loan term, often after a series of low monthly payments.</p>

<h2>HOME MORTGAGES: Understanding the Process and Your Right to Fair 
Lending </h2>
<p>&quot;Just Right!&quot; You've been looking at houses for months and months, and you have finally found it--the house that's just right. 
Now, you're anxious to buy your new home, move in, and get settled. But you still have an important task ahead of you-getting a 
mortgage loan.</p>
<p>This brochure explains about dealing with mortgage lenders. It tells you where to look, what to look for, and what takes place 
when you apply for a mortgage. Knowing what to expect, especially if you are a firsttime homebuyer, may make it easier for you 
to get through the process.</p>
<p>You'll also learn about your legal rights to fair lending and what you have a right to expect in fair treatment. The Fair Housing Act 
and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act make it unlawful for a lender to decide whether you qualify for a loan, or to offer less 
favorable terms, for reasons such as your race, national origin or sex and other prohibited factors.</p>
<p>If you believe you have been unlawfully discriminated against by a lender, or have questions about the treatment you have 
received, this brochure also tells you where to file a complaint.</p>
<p>Shop for the mortgage package that best meets your financial needs. If you apply for a mortgage and the lender says you don't 
qualify, keep in mind that some lenders have stricter credit standards than others. Try someone else. Don't stop shopping after 
one discouraging experience--or even several.</p>
<h4>Where to Shop and What to Look For</h4>
<p>Once you have found the home of your choice, you may think that your shopping days are over. Actually, only the first phase has 
been completed. Next comes finding a mortgage and payment terms that fit your budget. Where you shop and what you look for 
are important.</p>
<p>You might start by looking for a mortgage at the bank where you have your checking or savings account. But don't limit yourself. 
A wide variety of institutions make home mortgage loans, including savings and loan associations, commercial banks, mutual 
savings banks, and mortgage companies. The mortgages these institutions offer will have varying features. One way to find the 
creditor with the most attractively priced loan is to look in your local newspaper~ check to see if it publishes a shoppers guide to 
mortgage credit. These shoppers guides are available in many localities and can be used to identify the lenders with low rates. 
But, basically, the way to find the loan with the most attractive terms is to shop around.</p>
<p>You should have in mind some of the things to look for in a mortgage loan. For example, what types of loans are available from a 
given institution? Does the lender make privately or federally insured or guaranteed loans? Some lenders offer mortgage loans 
backed by a federal agency such as the Federal Housing Administration (FHA loans) or the Department of Veterans Affairs 
{VA loans. Loans that are not government- insured are called conventional mortgages. Insured mortgages may be more 
attractive than conventional mortgages in some ways-such as lower downpayment requirements. But they may be more 
restrictive in other ways~ for example, they may be available only for certain kinds of homes, or for properties whose value is 
below a specified price.</p>
<p>Other factors important to your mortgage decision are the length of the loan and the downpayment required by the lender. The 
longer the term and the larger the downpayment, the smaller your monthly payments will be. The interest rate is important too, 
and in some cases the amount of the downpayment will influence the interest rate that you pay {the larger the downpayment, the 
lower the interest rate}. In addition, mortgage loans may have interest rates that will stay fixed for the life of the loan (fixed rate 
mortgages), that may change (adjustable rate mortgages or ARMs), or that represent a combination of fixed and variable rates 
{convertible mortgages}. The initial rate of an ARM is generally lower than the rate available on a fixed-rate mortgage~ but 
remember, the rate may change during the lifetime of the loan. Don't hesitate to ask the lender how one loan differs from another, 
how the different features of the loan will affect the mortgage, or whether your chances to qualify would improve if you made a 
higher downpayment.</p>
<p>When you're shopping around, you will find that some home mortgage lenders have special programs to assist veterans, 
lowincome or first-time homebuyers. Ask the lender if such programs are available.</p>
<h4>The Mortgage<br>
Application Process:<br>
Some Things to Expect<br>
</h4>
<p>The mortgage application process requires considerable paperwork. First there is the application form, which asks for detailed 
information about you, your employment record, the house you want to purchase, etc. The lender will need documentation 
pertaining to your personal finances-your earnings, your monthly expenses, and your debts--to help gauge your willingness and 
ability to repay the mortgage.</p>
<p>Lenders also will examine your file at the credit bureau to learn if you pay your bills on time. A lender may reject your application 
if the report shows that you have a poor credit history. Thus, you may want to make sure your credit file is accurate before you 
apply for your mortgage. You have a right to know what information is contained in your credit report and to have someone from 
the credit bureau help you understand what the report says. The names of credit bureaus can be found in the phone book.</p>
<p>You can prepare for questions about your financial condition by using the worksheets in this brochure. Worksheet 1 helps 
determine how much money you might have available for a monthly payment--just list all items of income and payments required 
on debts that won't be paid off within ten months. There's also a place for the estimated mortgage payment quoted by the lender.</p>
<p>To figure the mortgage payment, the lender will begin by asking how much you want to borrow. The maximum loan amount will 
be determined by the value of the property and your personal financial condition. To estimate the value of the property, the 
lender will ask a real estate appraiser to give an opinion about its value. The appraiser's opinion can be an important factor in 
determining whether you qualify for the size mortgage you want. Lenders usually will lend the borrower up to a certain 
percentage of the appraised value of the property, such as 80 or 90 percent, and will expect a downpayment making up the 
difference. If the appraisal is below the asking price of the home, the downpayment you planned to make and the amount the 
lender is willing to lend you may not be enough to cover the purchase price. In that case, the lender may suggest a larger 
downpayment to make up the difference between the market value (asking price) of the house and the property's appraised 
value.</p>
<p>When looking at your projected mortgage payment and existing debt, some lenders might use ratios such as &quot;28 and 36&quot; to 
determine whether you qualify for the loan. These are commonly used ratios. In this formula, the 28 refers to the percentage of 
your gross income (before taxes) that may be spent on housing expenses, including principal and interest on the mortgage, real 
estate taxes, and insurance. The 36 refers to the income that may be spent for payments on all your debts (including the 
mortgage): the monthly payments on your outstanding debts, when added to the monthly housing expenses, may not exceed 36 
percent of your gross income. When you talk to a lender, find out what ratios will be used to evaluate your application. Then use 
Worksheet 2 to calculate whether you are within the lender's guidelines.</p>
<p>Be prepared to provide certain documentation about your income (W2s for prior years and year-to-date pay stubs), current 
debts (account number, outstanding balance, and creditor's address for each), and the purchase contract for the home you want 
to buy.</p>
<p>When you file your application, ask the lender how long the approval process will take. The time may vary depending on the 
complexity of your mortgage, current market conditions, and whether you have to provide additional information. It's common 
for a decision to be made within 30 days after the lender receives all the necessary information. Applications for FHA or VA 
loans may take longer.</p>
<h4>If Your Loan Is Denied</h4>
<p>If your application is turned down, federal law requires the lender to tell you, in writing, the specific reasons for the denial. Make 
sure you understand the reasons given--you may be able to find answers or alternatives that will satisfy the institution's lending 
standards. Even if that doesn't happen, understanding fully why the loan was denied may improve your chances with the next 
lender you visit. Factors that may affect the loan decision include:</p>
<p>Downpayment. Is your proposed downpayment sufficient? If not, perhaps the lender offers other types of mortgages with lower 
downpayment requirements.</p>
<p>Loan amount. Is the size of the mortgage you need too high, given the property's appraised market value? If similar houses in the 
neighborhood have sold at prices comparable to yours, maybe the appraiser undervalued the property. Suggest that the lender 
re-examine the appraisal, and ask to see a copy.</p>
<p>Credit history. Is the lender doubtful--because of your level of debt or credit history--about your ability to make the monthly 
payment? Ask how your debt ratios compare to the lender's standards. If there were special circumstances surrounding old 
credit problems, ask for a chance to explain.</p>
<h4>Understanding<br>
Your Rights<br>
to Fair Lending</h4>
<p>Federal law protects every homebuyer looking for a mortgage loan against discrimination on the basis of race, color, national 
origin, religion, sex, marital status, age,receipt of public assistance funds, familial status (having children under the age of 18), 
other consumer credit protection laws. Lenders may not take any of these factors into account in their dealings with you.</p>
<p>For instance, lenders may not discourage you because of your race or national origin from applying for a mortgage loan. What 
ever your color, they must offer you the same credit terms as other applicants with similar loan requests. They may not treat your 
application differently because of your sex or marital status or familial status. In short, they are barred from taking into account 
any of the factors listed here in their dealings with applicants or with potential applicants. They should:</p>
<p>* willingly give you an application and other information you need on how to apply for a loan.</p>
<p>* willingly discuss with you the various mortgage loans they offer and give you an idea whether you can qualify for them.</p>
<p>* diligently act to make a decision--without undue delay-- once you provide all the information asked for (including, for example 
written evidence of how much you make or how much you have in savings), and once they receive other paperwork required for 
processing the application(such as a property appraisal).</p>
<p>* not be influenced by the racial or ethnic composition of the neighborhood where the home you want to buy is located.</p>
<p>If you apply for a mortgage and are turned down, remember that not all institutions have the same lending standards. Shop 
around for another lender. But if the way you were treated suggests the possibility of unlawful discrimination, you might talk to:</p>
<p>Private Fair housing groups. Often these groups can walk you through the mortgage process. They can also help you understand 
whether your experience suggests that the lender is discriminating unlawfully, and can help you decide. whether to file a 
complaint.</p>
<p>Human rights agencies. These are government agencies ;set up by a city, county, or state to deal with discrimination.</p>
<p>Attorneys. They can advise you whether treatment you received gives you legal grounds for bringing a lawsuit against the lender. 
They can tell you about monetary damages and other types of relief available to individuals who can prove that illegal 
discrimination occurred.</p>
<p>Federal or state enforcement agencies. They can check the activities of mortgage lenders to make sure they complied with the 
laws against lending discrimination. When you write, include your name and address; name and address of the lending institution 
you are complaining about; address of the house involved; and a short description and the date of the alleged violation.</p>
<h4>Federal Laws Against<br>
Discrimination in Home Financing</h4>
<p>The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in housing sales or loans on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, sex, 
familial status (having children under the age of 18), or handicap.</p>
<p>The Equal Credit Opportunity Act prohibits discrimination in any aspect of a credit transaction on the basis of race, religion, age, 
color, national origin, receipt of public assistance funds, sex, marital status, or the exercise of any right under the Consumer 
Credit Protection Act.</p>

<h2>Mortgage Servicing</h2>
<p>* Your current servicer usually must notify you at least 15 days before the effective date of the transfer of your loan servicing.</p>
<p>* During a 60-day grace period, you cannot be charged a late fee if you mistakenly send your mortgage payment to the old 
servicer</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>* The new servicer cannot report to a credit bureau that payments were late.</p>
<p>* Write to the servicer if you think there are any problems with your account.</p>
<p>* Within 60 business days of receiving your inquiry, the servicer must correct your account or determine it is accurate.</p>
<p>* Do not subtract any disputed amount from your mortgage payment. The servicer may consider this different amount to be a 
partial payment and declare the mortgage in default.</p>

<p>When you apply for a home mortgage, you may think that the lender, or loan originator, will service the loan until it is paid off or 
your house is sold. This is not always true. In today's market, mortgage servicing rights often are bought and sold.</p>
<p>If you are notified that your home mortgage servicing has been sold to another company, you may wonder how it will affect your 
loan terms and monthly payments. Some consumers have complained that they were not given enough notice of loan servicing 
transfers and were unfairly charged late fees and penalties.</p>
<p>In 1990, the National Affordable Housing Act was passed to address some of these concerns. This brochure explains what a 
mortgage servicer does and what your rights are under the Housing Act It also tells what you can do if you have a complaint 
about the transfer of your loan servicing.</p>
<h4>What are the responsibilities of a Mortgage Servicer?</h4>
<p>The mortgage servicer collects your monthly payments and handles your escrow account. An escrow account is a fund that your 
lender establishes in order to pay property taxes and hazard insurance as they become due on your home during the year. In this 
way, the lender uses the escrow account to guard its investment in your home.</p>
<p>When your escrow account is first established, your mortgage servicer must give you a statement telling you the estimated taxes, 
insurance premiums and other charges that are anticipated over the next 12 months and the expected totals of those payments.</p>
<p>The mortgage servicer also is required to give you an annual statement that details the activity of your escrow account. This 
statement shows your account balance and reflects payments for property taxes and homeowners insurance.</p>
<h4>What does the Housing Act Require Lenders or Servicers To Do?</h4>
<p>To protect consumers, the National Affordable Housing Act requires lenders or servicers to do the following.</p>
<p>Provide a disclosure statement.</p>
<p>The disclosure statement says whether the lender intends to sell the mortgage servicing immediately; whether the mortgage 
servicing can be sold at any time during the life of the loan; and the percentage of loans the lender has sold previously. During 
1992, lenders must disclose the percentage of loans for which the servicing was sold in 1990 and 1991. This will change 
beginning in 1993, when lenders will have to report figures for the previous three years. The percentages will be noted in the 
ranges 0-25%, 26-50%, 51-75%, and 76-100%. The lender also must provide information about servicing procedures, transfer 
practices, and complaint resolution.</p>
<p>If you have a face-to-face interview with a lender, you must receive the disclosure statement at the time of the loan application. If 
you apply for a loan by mail, the lender has three business days to send you the disclosure statement after receiving your 
application. If you do not return a signed disclosure statement, the lender cannot fund a mortgage for you.</p>
<h4>Give proper notification when the loan servicing is going to be sold</h4>
<p>If your current servicer plans to sell your loan servicing, you must be notified at least 15 days before the effective date of the 
transfer unless you received a written transfer notice at settlement. The effective date is when the first mortgage payment is due at 
the new servicer's address. Under certain circumstances, the current servicer has up to 30 days after the effective date of the 
transfer to send you notification. These circumstances include:</p>
<p>* The lender terminates the contract because, for example, you have defaulted on the loan.</p>
<p>* The servicer files for bankruptcy.</p>
<p>* The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or the Resolution Trust Corporation begins proceedings to take over the servicer's 
operations.</p>
<h4>Include certain information in the notice.</h4>
<p>If your loan servicing is going to be sold, you should receive two notices-one from the current servicer and one from the new 
mortgage servicer. The new servicer must notify you not more than 15 days after the transfer has occurred. The notices must 
include the following information:</p>
<p>* the name and address of the new servicer.</p>
<p>* the date the current servicer will stop accepting mortgage payments, and the date the new servicer will begin accepting them.</p>
<p>* free or collect call telephone numbers for both the current servicer and the new servicer that you can call for information about 
the transfer of service.</p>
<p>* Information that tells whether you can continue any option insurance, such as mortgage life or disability insurance, and what 
action, if any, you must take to maintain coverage. You also must be told whether the insurance terms will change.</p>
<p>* A statement that the transfer will not affect any terms or conditions of the contract you signed with the original mortgage 
company, other than terms directly related to the servicing of such loan. For example, if your old lender did not require an 
escrow account, but allowed you to pay property taxes and insurance premiums on your own, the new servicer cannot demand 
that you establish such an account.</p>
<h4>Grant a grace period during the transfer of the loan servicing.</h4>
<p>After the transfer, there is a 60-day grace period. During this time you cannot be charged a late fee if you mistakenly send your 
mortgage payment to the old mortgage servicer instead of the new one. In addition, the fact that your new servicer may have 
received your payment late cannot be reported to a credit bureau.</p>
<h4>Respond promptly to written inquiries.</h4>
<p>If you believe you have been improperly charged a penalty or late fee, or there are other problems with the servicing of your 
loan, contact your servicer in writing. Be sure to include your account number and explain why you believe your account is 
incorrect.</p>
<p>Within 20 business days of receiving your inquiry, the servicer must send you a written response acknowledging your inquiry. 
Within 60 business days, the servicer must either correct your account or determine it is accurate. The servicer must send you a 
written notice of what action it took and why.</p>
<p>Do not subtract any disputed amount from your mortgage payment. Many mortgage servicers will refuse to accept what they 
consider to be partial payments. They may return the check and charge a late fee, or declare the mortgage is in default and start 
foreclosure proceedings.</p>
<h4>What Can You Do If You Have a Complaint?</h4>
<p>If you believe the servicer has not responded appropriately to your written inquiry, contact your local or state consumer 
protection office. If your lender is certified by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), you may want to file 
a complaint with HUD. Write: Office of Single Family Housing, HUD, Room 9282, Washington, D.C. 20410.</p>
<p>You also can send your complaint to the FTC. Write to: Correspondence B ranch, Federal Trade Commission, Washington, 
D.C. 20580. Although the FTC generally does not intervene in individual cases, the information you provide may indicate a 
pattern of possible law violations requiting action by the Commission.</p>
<p>You also may want to contact an attorney to advise you of your legal rights. Under the National Affordable Housing Act, 
consumers can initiate class action suits and obtain actual damages, plus additional damages, for a pattern or practice of 
noncompliance. In successful actions, consumers also may obtain court costs and attorneys fees.</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Mortgage Servicing -- April 1993</h2>
<p>When you apply for a home mortgage, you may think that the lender, or loan originator, will service the loan until it is paid off or 
your house is sold. This is not always true. In today's market, mortgage servicing rights often are bought and sold.</p>
<p>If you are notified that your home mortgage servicing has been sold to another company, you may wonder how it will affect your 
loan terms and monthly payments. Some consumers have complained that they were not given enough notice of loan servicing 
transfers and were unfairly charged late fees and penalties.</p>
<p>In 1990, the National Affordable Housing Act was passed to address some of these concerns. This brochure explains what a 
mortgage servicer does and what your rights are under the Housing Act. It also tells what you can do if you have a complaint 
about the transfer of your loan servicing.</p>
<h4>What are the responsibilities of a Mortgage Servicer?</h4>
<p>The mortgage servicer collects your monthly payments and handles your escrow account. An escrow account is a fund that your 
lender establishes in order to pay property taxes and hazard insurance as they become due on your home during the year. In this 
way, the lender uses the escrow account to guard its investment in your home.</p>
<p>When your escrow account is first established, your mortgage servicer must give you a statement telling you the estimated taxes, 
insurance premiums and other charges that are anticipated over the next 12 months and the expected totals of those payments.</p>
<p>The mortgage servicer also is required to give you an annual statement that details the activity of your escrow account. This 
statement shows your account balance and reflects payments for property taxes and homeowners insurance.</p>
<h4>What does the Housing Act Require Lenders or Servicers To Do?</h4>
<p>To protect consumers, the National Affordable Housing Act requires lenders or servicers to do the following.</p>
<p>Provide a disclosure statement.</p>
<p>The disclosure statement says whether the lender intends to sell the mortgage servicing immediately; whether the mortgage 
servicing can be sold at any time during the life of the loan; and the percentage of loans the lender has sold previously.</p>
<p>During 1992, lenders had to disclose the percentage of loans for which the servicing was sold in 1990 and 1991. Beginning in 
1993, lenders must report figures for the previous three years. The percentages should be noted in the ranges 0-25%, 26-50%, 
51-75%, and 76-100%. The lender also must provide information about servicing procedures, transfer practices, and complaint 
resolution.</p>
<p>If you have a face-to-face interview with a lender, you must receive the disclosure statement at the time of the loan application. If 
you apply for a loan by mail, the lender has three business days to send you the disclosure statement after receiving your 
application. If you do not return a signed disclosure statement, the lender cannot fund a mortgage for you.</p>
<p>Give proper notification when the loan servicing is going to be sold.</p>
<p>If your current servicer plans to sell your loan servicing, you must be notified at least 15 days before the effective date of the 
transfer unless you received a written transfer notice at settlement. The effective date is when the first mortgage payment is due at 
the new servicer's address.</p>
<p>Under certain circumstances, the current servicer has up to 30 days after the effective date of the transfer to send you 
notification. These circumstances include:</p>
<p>The lender terminates the contract because, for example, you have defaulted on the loan.</p>
<p>The servicer files for bankruptcy.</p>
<p>The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or the Resolution Trust Corporation begins proceedings to take over the servicer's 
operations.</p>
<p>Include certain information in the notice.</p>
<p>If your loan servicing is going to be sold, you should receive two notices--one from the current servicer and one from the new 
mortgage servicer. The new servicer must notify you not more than 15 days after the transfer has occurred. The notices must 
include the following information:</p>
<p>The name and address of the new servicer.</p>
<p>The date the current servicer will stop accepting mortgage payments, and the date the new servicer will begin accepting them.</p>
<p>Free or collect call telephone numbers for both the current servicer and the new servicer that you can call for information about 
the transfer of service.</p>
<p>Information that tells whether you can continue any option insurance, such as mortgage life or disability insurance, and what 
action, if any, you must take to maintain coverage. You also must be told whether the insurance terms will change.</p>
<p>A statement that the transfer will not affect any terms or conditions of your mortgage documents, except the terms that are 
directly related to the servicing of the loan. For example, if under your contract, you specifically were allowed to pay property 
taxes and insurance premiums on your own, the new servicer cannot demand that you establish an escrow account. However, if 
your contract was neutral on this issue or merely limited the actions of your old lender, the new servicer may be able to require 
such an account.</p>
<p>Grant a grace period during the transfer of the loan servicing.</p>
<p>After the transfer, there is a 60-day grace period. During this time you cannot be charged a late fee if you mistakenly send your 
mortgage payment to the old mortgage servicer instead of the new one. In addition, the fact that your new servicer may have 
received your payment late cannot be reported to a credit bureau.</p>
<p>Respond promptly to written inquiries.</p>
<p>If you believe you have been improperly charged a penalty or late fee, or there are other problems with the servicing of your 
loan, contact your servicer in writing. Be sure to include your account number and explain why you believe your account is 
incorrect. Within 20 business days of receiving your inquiry, the servicer must send you a written response acknowledging your 
inquiry. Within 60 business days, the servicer must either correct your account or determine it is accurate.</p>
<p>The servicer must send you a written notice of what action it took and why.</p>
<p>Do not subtract any disputed amount from your mortgage payment. Many mortgage servicers will refuse to accept what they 
consider to be partial payments. They may return the check and charge a late fee, or declare the mortgage is in default and start 
foreclosure proceedings.</p>
<h4>What Can You Do If You Have a Complaint?</h4>
<p>If you believe the servicer has not responded appropriately to your written inquiry, contact your local or state consumer 
protection office. You also should contact the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to file a complaint under 
the National Affordable Housing Act. Write: Office of Single Family Housing, HUD, Room 9282, Washington, DC 20410.</p>
<p>You also can send your complaint to the FTC. Write: Correspondence Branch, Federal Trade Commission, Washington, DC 
20580. Although the FTC generally does not intervene in individual cases, the information you provide may show a pattern of 
possible violations of laws that are enforced by the Commission.</p>
<p>You also may want to contact an attorney to advise you of your legal rights. Under the National Affordable Housing Act, 
consumers can initiate class action suits and obtain actual damages, plus additional damages, for a pattern or practice of 
noncompliance. In successful actions, consumers also may obtain court costs and attorneys fees.</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Refinancing Your Home -- September 1993</h2>
<p>Should you refinance your home mortgage? That's a question many homeowners are asking, given the lower mortgage rates that 
are currently available.</p>
<p>But, how do you decide if refinancing makes sense in your particular case? The answer depends on many factors, including your 
tax bracket, the length of time you plan to stay in your home, and the additional costs and charges you must pay for the 
refinancing.</p>
<p>What follows is information to help you decide whether to refinance your home mortgage and how to go about doing it. You may 
want to refer to the charts on pages 9 and 10 to see how much money you might save if you refinanced your mortgage. (We 
apologize that the charts are not available on-line. To obtain a copy of the charts, please request a free copy of the brochure by 
contacting: Public Reference, Federal Trade Commission, Washington, D.C. 20580; (202) 326-2222. TDD call (202) 
326-2502.)</p>
<h4>How Much Will It Cost To Refinance Your Mortgage?</h4>
<p>When you refinance your mortgage, you usually pay off your original mortgage and sign a new loan. With a new loan, you again 
pay most of the same costs you paid to get your original mortgage. These can include settlement costs, discount points, and other 
fees. You also may be charged a penalty for paying off your original loan early, although some states prohibit this.</p>
<p>The total expense for refinancing a mortgage depends on the interest rate, number of points, and other costs required to obtain a 
loan. To obtain the lowest rate offered by the lender, most lenders will charge several points, and the total cost can run between 
three and six percent of the total amount you borrow.</p>
<p>So, for example, on a $100,000 mortgage, the lender might charge you between $3,000 and $6,000. However, some lenders 
may offer zero points at a higher interest rate, which may significantly reduce your initial costs, although your payments may be 
somewhat higher.</p>
<h4>Is The Interest Rate Low Enough To Save You Money?</h4>
<p>Talk to some lenders to determine the available rates and the costs associated with refinancing. These costs include appraisals, 
attorney's fees, and points. Then determine what your new payment would be if you refinanced. You can estimate how long it 
will take to recover the costs of refinancing by dividing your closing costs by the difference between your new and old payments 
(your monthly savings). However, the ultimate amount you may save depends on many factors, including your total refinancing 
costs, whether you sell your home in the near future, and the effects of refinancing on your taxes.</p>
<p>The old rule of thumb used to be that you shouldn't refinance unless the new interest rate is at least two percentage points lower. 
However, many lenders are now offering zero point loans and low-cost refinancing. Therefore, even if your rate change is less 
than one percentage point, you may be able to save some money by refinancing.</p>
<p>How Many &quot;Points&quot; Must You Pay To The Lender To Obtain The Loan? In refinancing, lenders usually offer a range of interest 
rates at different amounts of points. A point equals one percent of the loan amount. For example, three points on a $100,000 
mortgage loan would add $3,000 to the refinancing charges.</p>
<p>Shopping for points as well as interest rates may save you money. As a rule of thumb, each point adds about one-eighth to 
one-quarter of one percent to the interest rate the lender is offering.</p>
<p>Generally, the lower the interest rate on the loan, the more points the lending institution will charge. Some lenders offer 
refinancing with no points, but generally charge higher interest rates.</p>
<p>To decide what combination of rate and points is best for you, balance the amount you can pay up front with the amount you can 
pay monthly. The less time that you keep the loan, the more expensive points become. If you plan to stay in your house for a long 
time, then it may be worthwhile to pay additional points to obtain a lower interest rate.</p>
<p>Some lenders may offer to finance the points so that you do not have to pay them up front. This means that the points will be 
added to your loan balance, and you will pay a finance charge on them. Although this may enable you to get the financing, it also 
will increase the amount of your monthly payments.</p>
<h4>What Other Settlement Costs Will The Lender Require You To Pay At Closing?</h4>
<p>Settlement costs typically include fees for the loan application, title search, appraisal, loan origination, credit check, and lawyer's 
services. You also may be required to pay recordation fees or transfer taxes. If you are shopping for a lender, ask each one for a 
list of charges and costs you must pay at closing. Some lenders may require that some of these costs be paid at the time of 
application.</p>
<h4>How Would Refinancing Affect The Taxes You Owe?</h4>
<p>With a lower interest rate on your home loan, you will have less interest to deduct on your income tax return. That, of course, 
may increase your tax payments and decrease the total savings you might obtain from a new, lower-interest mortgage. You 
should be aware of an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) ruling with respect to points paid solely for refinancing your home 
mortgage. IRS regulations require that interest (points) paid up front for refinancing must be deducted over the life of the loan not 
in the year you refinance unless the loan is for home improvements. This means that if you paid a certain number of points, you 
would have to spread the tax deduction for those points over the life of the loan. If, however, the refinancing is for home 
improvements or a portion of the loan is for this purpose you may be able to deduct the points or a portion of the points under 
certain circumstances. Check with the IRS regarding the current rulings on refinancing, particularly if you are using the new loan 
to make home improvements.</p>
<h4>Should You Also Consider A Different Type Of Mortgage?</h4>
<p>If you are thinking about refinancing your mortgage, you might want to consider other types of mortgages. For example, you 
might want to look into a 15-year, fixed-rate mortgage. In this plan, your mortgage payments are somewhat higher than a 
longer-term loan, but you pay substantially less interest over the life of the loan and build equity more quickly. (Of course, this 
also means you have less interest to deduct on your income tax return.)</p>
<p>You also might want to consider refinancing if you have an adjustable rate mortgage with high or no limits on interest rate 
increases. You might want to switch to a fixed-rate mortgage or to an adjustable rate mortgage that limits changes in the rate at 
each adjustment date as well as over the life of the loan. If you decide to apply for refinancing with a particular lender, and if you 
do not want to let the interest rate &quot;float&quot; until closing, get a written statement guaranteeing the interest rate and the number of 
discount points that you will pay at closing.</p>
<p>This binding commitment or &quot;lock-in&quot; ensures that the lender will not raise these costs even if rates increase before you settle on 
the new loan. You also may consider requesting an agreement where the interest rate can decrease but not increase before 
closing. If you cannot get the lender to put this information in writing, you may wish to choose one who will.</p>
<p>Most lenders place a limit on the length of time (say, 60 days) they will guarantee the interest rate. You must sign the loan during 
that time or lose the benefit of that particular rate. Because many people are refinancing their mortgages, there may be a delay in 
processing the papers. Therefore, you may want to contact your loan officer periodically to check on the progress of your loan 
approval and to see if additional information is needed.</p>
<h4>What Do You Look For When Shopping For A Home Mortgage?</h4>
<p>If you decide to refinance your mortgage, shopping around by calling several lending institutions to ask each one what interest 
and fees they charge will help you get the best deal available. Also ask each about their &quot;annual percentage rate&quot; (APR) and 
compare them. The APR will tell you the total credit costs of the refinancing, including interest, points, and other charges.</p>
<p>Remember, you do not have to refinance your mortgage with the same lender that provided your original mortgage. However, to 
keep your business, some lenders will offer their original mortgage customers the incentive of lower mortgage interest rates, 
sometimes with reduced closing costs.</p>
<h4>What Disclosure Must The Lender Give You?</h4>
<p>For a refinancing, the lender must give you a written statement of the costs and terms of the financing before you become legally 
obligated for the loan, as required by the Truth in Lending Act. You usually will receive the information around the time of 
settlement, although some lenders provide it earlier. You will want to review this statement carefully before you sign the loan. The 
disclosure tells you the APR, finance charge, amount financed, payment schedule, and other important credit terms. If you 
refinance with a different lender, or if you borrow beyond your unpaid balance with your current lender, you also must be given 
the right to rescind the loan. In these loans, you have the right to rescind or cancel the transaction within three business days 
following settlement, receipt of your Truth in Lending disclosures, or receipt of your cancellation notice, whichever occurs last.</p>
<h4>Will The Lender Refund Your Application Fees If You Do Not Sign The Mortgage?</h4>
<p>When you apply for a mortgage, some lenders require you to pay a special charge to cover the costs of processing your 
application. The amount of this fee varies, but it may be $100 to $200. Usually, you must pay this charge at the time you file the 
application.</p>
<p>Some lenders do not refund this application fee if you are not approved for the loan or if you decide not to take it. So, before 
you apply for a mortgage, ask lenders whether they charge an application fee. If they do, find out how much it is and under what 
circumstances and to what extent it is refundable. However, if you elect to cancel the transaction within three business days after 
you close the loan, as discussed above, you are entitled to a refund of all costs and charges imposed for the credit transaction.</p>
<h4>Where Can You Go For More Information?</h4>
<p>If you have further questions about refinancing or problems with financing companies, you may write to: Correspondence 
Branch, Federal Trade Commission, Washington, D.C. 20580. While the FTC cannot resolve individual disputes, it can act 
when it sees a pattern of possible law violations.</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Reverse Mortgages -- October 1993</h2>
<p>Produced in cooperation with the American Association of Retired Persons</p>
<p>If you are age 62 or older and are &quot;house-rich, cash-poor,&quot; a reverse mortgage (RM) may be an option to help increase your 
income. However, because your home is such a valuable asset, you may want to consult with your family, attorney, or financial 
advisor before applying for an RM. Knowing your rights and responsibilities as a borrower may help to minimize your financial 
risks and avoid any threat of foreclosure or loss of your home.</p>
<p>This brochure explains how RMs work. It describes similarities and differences among the three RM plans available today: 
FHA-insured; lender-insured; and uninsured. It also discusses the benefits and drawbacks of each plan. Each plan differs slightly, 
so be careful to choose the plan that best meets your financial needs. Organizations and government agencies that offer additional 
information about RMs are listed at the end of this brochure.</p>
<h4>How Reverse Mortgages Work</h4>
<p>A reverse mortgage is a type of home equity loan that allows you to convert some of the equity in your home into cash while you 
retain home ownership. RMs works much like traditional mortgages, only in reverse. Rather than making a payment to your 
lender each month, the lender pays you. Unlike conventional home equity loans, most RMs do not require any repayment of 
principal, interest, or servicing fees for as long as you live in your home. Funds obtained from an RM may be used for any 
purpose, including meeting housing expenses such as taxes, insurance, fuel, and maintenance costs.</p>
<h4>Requirements and Responsibilities of the Borrower</h4>
<p>To qualify for an RM, you must own your home. The RM funds may be paid to you in a lump sum, in monthly advances, through 
a line-of-credit, or in a combination of the three, depending on the type of RM and the lender. The amount you are eligible to 
borrow generally is based on your age, the equity in your home, and the interest rate the lender is charging.</p>
<p>Because you retain title to your home with an RM, you also remain responsible for taxes, repairs, and maintenance. Depending 
on the plan you select, your RM becomes due with interest either when you permanently move, sell your home, die, or reach the 
end of the pre-selected loan term. The lender does not take title to your home when you die, but your heirs must pay off the loan. 
The debt is usually repaid by refinancing the loan into a forward mortgage (if the heirs are eligible) or by using the proceeds from 
the sale of your home.</p>
<h4>Common Features of Reverse Mortgages</h4>
<p>Listed below are some points to consider about RMs.</p>
<p>RMs are rising-debt loans. This means that the interest is added to the principal loan balance each month, because it is not paid 
on a current basis. Therefore, the total amount of interest you owe increases significantly with time as the interest compounds.</p>
<p>All three plans (FHA-insured, lender-insured, and uninsured) charge origination fees and closing costs. Insured plans also charge 
insurance premiums, and some impose mortgage servicing charges. Your lender may permit you to finance these costs so you 
will not have to pay for them in cash. But remember these costs will be added to your loan amount.</p>
<p>RMs use up some or all of the equity in your home, leaving fewer assets for you and your heirs in the future.</p>
<p>You generally can request a loan advance at closing that is substantially larger than the rest of your payments.</p>
<p>Your legal obligation to pay back the loan is limited by the value of your home at the time the loan is repaid. This could include 
increases in the value (appreciation) of your home after your loan begins.</p>
<p>RM loan advances are nontaxable. Further, they do not affect your Social Security or Medicare benefits. If you receive 
Supplemental Security Income, RM advances do not affect your benefits as long as you spend them within the month you receive 
them. This is true in most states for Medicaid benefits also. When in doubt, check with a benefits specialist at your local area 
agency on aging or legal services office.</p>
<p>Some plans provide for fixed rate interest. Others involve adjustable rates that change over the loan term based upon market 
conditions.</p>
<p>Interest on RMs is not deductible for income tax purposes until you pay off all or part of your total RM debt.</p>
<h4>How Reverse Mortgages Differ</h4>
<p>This section describes how the three types of RMs -- FHA-insured, lender-insured, and uninsured -- vary according to their 
costs and terms. Although the FHA and lender-insured plans appear similar, important differences exist. This section also 
discusses advantages and drawbacks of each loan type.</p>
<p>FHA-insured. This plan offers several RM payment options. You may receive monthly loan advances for a fixed term or for as 
long as you live in the home, a line of credit, or monthly loan advances plus a line of credit. This RM is not due as long as you live 
in your home. With the line of credit option, you may draw amounts as you need them over time. Closing costs, a mortgage 
insurance premium and sometimes a monthly servicing fee is required. Interest is charged at an adjustable rate on your loan 
balance; any interest rate changes do not affect the monthly payment, but rather how quickly the loan balance grows over time.</p>
<p>The FHA-insured RM permits changes in payment options at little cost. This plan also protects you by guaranteeing that loan 
advances will continue to be made to you if a lender defaults. However, FHA-insured RMs may provide smaller loan advances 
than lender-insured plans. Also, FHA loan costs may be greater than uninsured plans.</p>
<p>Lender-insured. These RMs offer monthly loan advances or monthly loan advances plus a line of credit for as long as you live in 
your home. Interest may be assessed at a fixed rate or an adjustable rate, and additional loan costs can include a mortgage 
insurance premium (which may be fixed or variable) and other loan fees.</p>
<p>Loan advances from a lender-insured plan may be larger than those provided by FHA-insured plans. Lender-insured RMs also 
may allow you to mortgage less than the full value of your home, thus preserving home equity for later use by you or your heirs. 
However, these loans may involve greater loan costs than FHA-insured, or uninsured loans. Higher costs mean that your loan 
balance grows faster, leaving you with less equity over time. Some lender-insured plans include an annuity that continues making 
monthly payments to you even if you sell your home and move. The security of these payments depends on the financial strength 
of the company providing them, so be sure to check the financial ratings of that company. Annuity payments may be taxable and 
affect your eligibility for Supplemental Security</p>
<p>Income and Medicaid. These &quot;reverse annuity mortgages&quot; may also include additional charges based on increases in the value of 
your home during the term of your loan.</p>
<p>Uninsured. This RM is dramatically different from FHA and lender-insured RMs. An uninsured plan provides monthly loan 
advances for a fixed term only -- a definite number of years that you select when you first take out the loan. Your loan balance 
becomes due and payable when the loan advances stop. Interest is usually set at a fixed interest rate and no mortgage insurance 
premium is required.</p>
<p>If you consider an uninsured RM, carefully think about the amount of money you need monthly; how many years you may need 
the money; how you will repay the loan when it comes due; and how much remaining equity you will need after paying off the 
loan.</p>
<p>If you have short-term but substantial cash needs, the uninsured RM can provide a greater monthly advance than the other plans. 
However, because you must pay back the loan by a specific date, it is important for you to have a source of repayment. If you 
are unable to repay the loan, you may have to sell your home and move.</p>
<h4>Reverse Mortgage Safeguards</h4>
<p>One of the best protections you have with RMs is the Federal Truth in Lending Act, which requires lenders to inform you about 
the plan's terms and costs. Be sure you understand them before signing. Among other information, lenders must disclose the 
Annual Percentage Rate (APR) and payment terms. On plans with adjustable rates, lenders must provide specific information 
about the variable rate feature. On plans with credit lines, lenders also must inform you of any charges to open and use the 
account, such as an appraisal, a credit report, or attorney's fees.</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Second Mortgage Financing -- October 1992</h2>
<p>If you are like most homeowners, you probably have a first mortgage loan on your home. Typically, such loans are for 25 to 30 
years, with the monthly payments adjusted so that the loan is paid in full at the end of the term.</p>
<p>As you make monthly mortgage payments and the value of the home increases, your interest in the property (called &quot;equity&quot;) 
grows. After a while, some homeowners may wish to borrow against the equity in their home to get cash, to make home 
improvements, to educate their children, or to consolidate personal debts. Because such loans are in addition to the first 
mortgage on the home, they are commonly called &quot;second mortgage&quot; loans.</p>
<p>Second mortgage loans are different from first mortgages in several ways. They often carry a higher interest rate, and they usually 
are for a shorter time, 15 years or less. In addition, they may require a large single payment at the end of the term, commonly 
known as a balloon payment.</p>
<p>Traditionally, second mortgage loans are offered with a fixed loan amount and a predetermined repayment schedule. Some 
lenders now offer lines of credit that allow you to obtain cash advances with a credit card or to write checks up to a certain 
credit limit. These often are called &quot;home equity lines&quot; because the equity in your home is collateral for the amount of credit you 
request. As you pay off the outstanding balance, you can reuse the line of credit during the loan period.</p>
<p>This brochure provides answers to some common questions people ask when they begin shopping for a second mortgage or 
home equity loan. It discusses choosing a lender, the meaning of some mortgage terms, costs, disclosure documents, and 
contacts for resolving problems.</p>
<h4>How do I Choose a Lender?</h4>
<p>When you are looking for a lender, shop around and make comparisons. Interest rates, repayment terms, and origination fees 
may vary substantially. Ask your local banks, savings and loans, credit unions, or finance companies about their loan terms. 
Although you will want to select the lender who offers you terms most suited to your needs, be sure to ask and compare the 
annual percentage rates (APR) because they will give you the total cost of the loan, including financing charges.</p>
<p>If you have not done business with the lender before, or if the lender is unfamiliar to you, you may wish to ask your local Better 
Business Bureau or consumer protection office if they have any complaints against the lender.</p>
<h4>How Long Will I Have to Repay the Loan?</h4>
<p>Some second mortgage loans may extend for as long as 15 or 20 years; others may require repayment in one year. You will 
need to discuss the repayment terms with the lenders and select one who offers terms that best suit your needs. For example, if 
you need to borrow $20,000 to make repairs on your home, you may not want a loan that requires you to repay the entire 
amount in one or two years because the monthly payments may be too high.</p>
<h4>Will My Interest Rate Change?</h4>
<p>If you have a fixed-rate loan, the interest rate is set for the life of the loan. However, many lenders offer variable rate mortgages, 
also known as adjustable rate mortgages or ARMs. These provide for periodic interest-rate adjustments. If your loan contract 
allows the lender to adjust or change the interest rate, be sure you understand when the lender has the right to change the interest 
rate, whether there are any limits on how much the interest or payments can change, and how often the lender can change the 
rate. You also should know what basis the lender will use to determine a new rate of interest.</p>
<h4>How Much Will My Monthly Payments Be and Will They Pay Off the Loan?</h4>
<p>Be sure you understand how much your monthly payments will be and what they cover. Your lender should be able to give you 
this information in advance. With some loans, you will be required to make monthly payments on the principal and interest. With 
other loans, you may be required to pay interest only on the borrowed amount; in these loans, your monthly payments will not 
reduce the principal amount of the loan. With such a loan, you will be required to pay back the entire borrowed amount at the 
end of the loan period. These loans are popularly known as &quot;balloon loans.&quot;</p>
<p>If your loan has a balloon payment, you should consider how you will arrange to repay the entire amount when it becomes due. 
On &quot;home equity lines,&quot; the lender does not have to give you the exact amount of the monthly payment, but must explain how it is 
figured. This is because the borrowed amount will vary and your outstanding balance will change if you use the line of credit. 
However, if your monthly payment term is 5% of the outstanding balance and your outstanding balance is $5,000, your minimum 
monthly payments would be $250.</p>
<h4>Will I Have to Pay Any Fees to Get This Loan?</h4>
<p>Many companies will charge a fee for lending you money. The fee is usually a percentage of the loan and is sometimes referred to 
as &quot;points.&quot; One point is equal to one percent of the amount you borrow. For example, if you were to borrow $10,000 with a 
fee of eight points, you would pay $800 in &quot;points.&quot; The number of points lenders charge varies, so it may be worthwhile to shop 
around. If the fee seems too high, you may be able to bargain for or find a lower fee. Be sure to get the amount of the fee in 
writing before you take the loan. Many states limit the amount of fees a lender may charge on a second mortgage loan. You may 
want to check with your state's consumer protection office or banking commissioner to determine whether there is a limit in your 
state.</p>
<h4>What Should I Get in Writing?</h4>
<p>If your loan is primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, the lender is required to give you a federal Truth in Lending 
disclosure form before you sign the customary loan documents, such as a note or deed of trust. This Truth in Lending form will 
tell you the actual cost of the loan. It includes the annual percentage rate, the finance charge, and the fees included in the loan. 
For &quot;home equity lines,&quot; your lender also is required to send you a periodic statement, usually monthly. The lender also is 
required to give you a notice of your right of rescission. The right of rescission gives you three business days after signing for the 
loan and receiving the Truth in Lending Act disclosures to reconsider whether you want to take the loan. For additional 
information about the right of rescission, ask for the free FTC brochure, Getting a Loan: Your Home as Security, at the address 
listed at the end of this brochure.</p>
<p>If your lender makes any promises, such as saying you can &quot;automatically&quot; get the loan refinanced at the end of the term, be sure 
your lender puts these promises in writing. In this way, you may avoid any future disputes.</p>
<h4>What Should I Do if I Have a Problem?</h4>
<p>If you ever have a problem making your loan payments, talk to your lender as soon as possible. Some lenders will work with you 
to arrange a temporary payment plan. Also, call the lender if you have any questions about your loan.</p>
<p>However, if you have problems with your lender, you may want to contact your state, county, or local consumer protection 
office. If they cannot help you, they can refer you to the office that can.</p>
<p>The Federal Trade Commission is responsible for enforcing laws such as the Truth in Lending Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity 
Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. It also provides free brochures explaining these 
laws. For these or credit-related publications, such as: Home Equity Credit Lines, Using Ads to Shop for Home Financing, and 
Refinancing Your Home, write to: Public Reference, Federal Trade Commission, Washington, D.C. 20580.</p>
<p>If you believe your lender may be violating a law that the FTC administers, you can send complaints or questions to: 
Correspondence Branch, Federal Trade Commission, Washington, D.C. 20580. Although the FTC cannot resolve individual 
consumer disputes, it can take action if there is evidence of a pattern of deceptive or unfair practices.</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Using Ads to Shop for Home Financing -- January 1993</h2>
<p>For many home buyers, shopping to find the best home financing is as important as shopping to find the right house. After all, a 
small difference in the mortgage rate can make a big difference in monthly payments.</p>
<p>Many consumers learn about available credit terms for new homes from newspaper advertisements. But consumers may not 
know what to look for when they compare credit terms in home advertisements. Here are answers to some questions you may 
have about home credit advertising.</p>
<h4>What terms must a home financing ad contain?</h4>
<p>There is no federal requirement that ads for homes provide information about credit terms. But the Federal Truth in Lending Act 
requires that if an ad includes certain credit terms, such as the amount or percentage of the downpayment (in a credit sale), the 
amount of the monthly payment, the length of the loan, or the amount of the finance charge, it also must include all of the following 
information:</p>
<p>the amount or the percentage of the downpayment (in a credit sale);</p>
<p>the terms of repayment (i.e., the amount of the monthly payment and the length of the mortgage); and</p>
<p>the rate of finance charge, expressed as the &quot;annual percentage rate.&quot; (See next section for definition.)</p>
<p>If an ad includes any interest rate, such as the simple interest rate or rates that apply for a limited period of time, the law requires 
that the annual percentage rate also be advertised. If an ad says &quot;10% financing,&quot; &quot;the equivalent of 6%,&quot; or simply &quot;8%,&quot; the 
advertised rate is probably not the annual percentage rate. The actual cost of the credit is likely to be higher. Therefore, you 
should ask for the annual percentage rate and compare terms.</p>
<h4>What is the difference between the annual percentage rate and other interest rates?</h4>
<p>The annual percentage rate (APR) includes all the costs of credit; other interest rates do not. For example, the &quot;simple&quot; interest 
rate is the one usually shown on the mortgage document. It does not reflect additional costs to cover such items as &quot;points&quot; (fees 
charged when the mortgage is closed) or mortgage insurance. If an ad does not include the APR, it does not tell you everything 
you need to know about the cost of credit. For example, suppose you had to choose between a 9 percent simple interest rate 
and a 9 percent APR on a 30-year loan. Also suppose the house cost $110,000 and you made a $10,000 downpayment, 
leaving $100,000 to be financed. Because of the small downpayment, many lenders would require you to buy mortgage 
insurance, often costing one half of one percent of the loan balance. With a 9 percent simple interest rate, the extra cost for the 
mortgage insurance, and other loan origination fees, your monthly payments might be as high as $841. But with a 9 percent APR, 
which includes the cost of mortgage insurance and other loan origination fees, your monthly payments should not exceed $805. 
The difference between these two rates could be $36 a month and thousands of dollars over the loan.</p>
<h4>What should I look for in ads offering &quot;creative financing&quot;?</h4>
<p>Creative financing plans typically include lower payments in the earlier years of the financing plan, interest rates that can change 
during the entire term of the loan, or some combination of these features. Look for the following information in the ad, or ask the 
lender these questions:</p>
<p>Will the interest rate or the monthly payments change during the term of the loan? In some loans, a below-market rate and lower 
payments apply only for the first few years, but higher rates and payments follow for the remainder of the loan term.</p>
<p>How will the new interest rate or the monthly payments be calculated? The increased rate and payments are stated in advance in 
some mortgages. In others, they are tied to certain indexes and depend on future market conditions. In these loans, the amount 
and frequency of the changes in your interest rate and payments also depends on the terms of your loan agreement.</p>
<p>Will the advertised monthly payments be large enough to pay off the mortgage? Some mortgage plans offer low monthly 
payments even though the interest rate is fairly high. If these monthly costs are not enough to repay the loan amount and the 
interest charges, the difference may be added to the principal. In some plans, you could owe more at the end of the mortgage 
term that at the beginning.</p>
<p>Will you have to refinance the mortgage after a few years? If a large or &quot;balloon&quot; payment is due after a few years and you do 
not have the necessary cash, you may have to refinance the mortgage. If you do refinance and interest rates have risen, you may 
have to make much higher monthly payments than you had planned.</p>
<h4>How can I tell if the advertised credit includes monthly payments or interest rates that will change?</h4>
<p>Phrases such as &quot;effective rate,&quot; &quot;adjustable rate,&quot; or &quot;flexible payments&quot; indicate that the credit terms may change. If you see any 
of these phrases in an ad, find out more about the credit terms. For example, if an ad offers a &quot;7% effective rate,&quot; look for other 
information, such as the APR, to tell you the full cost of credit.</p>
<h4>Where can I get more information about home financing?</h4>
<p>While credit advertising can help you compare financing plans, it is important to get more detailed information before deciding on 
a mortgage, especially if creative financing plans are involved. It may be worthwhile to consult a professional, such as an 
attorney, accountant, or banker for help in understanding various home mortgage plans.</p>
<p>You also may wish to request two free publications from the FTC: Home Financing Primer and Mortgage Money Guide. Write 
to: Public Reference, Federal Trade Commission, Washington, D.C. 20580.</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Care Labels -- December 1993</h2>
<p>Puckered seams. Shrunken size. Smeared colors. You may get these results after washing a garment or having it drycleaned. 
Don't pitch the garment just yet. If you followed the cleaning instructions on the care label, return the garment to the store and 
ask for a replacement or refund.</p>
<p>By law, manufacturers must tag their clothing with at least one safe cleaning method. Garments that are made without a care 
label--or ones that have inaccurate washing instructions--may violate the Care Labeling Rule.</p>
<p>This brochure explains what is required under the Care Labeling Rule. It also tells what to do if clothing is damaged even though 
you followed the care label.</p>
<h4>When is a Care Label Required?</h4>
<p>Care labels are required on most textile clothing, including hosiery. This excludes clothing made primarily of suede or leather. 
Also exempt: items for the head and hands (such as hats and gloves); footwear; and household items (such as linen).</p>
<h4>What Should the Care Label Say?</h4>
<p>In addition to giving one safe cleaning method, care labels must include any necessary warnings. If any part of the recommended 
care method could harm the garment or others washed with it, the care label must say so.</p>
<h4>What if You Follow the Label and a Problem Develops?</h4>
<p>You follow the care label only to find that your red-and-white shirt has turned pink or your long pants are now knickers. If this 
happens, return the garment to the store. If the store will not resolve the problem, ask for the manufacturer's name and address 
and write to the company.</p>
<p>In your letter, fully describe the garment and give all the information that is on the labels and tags. Estimate how many times the 
garment has been washed or drycleaned and give the full name and address of the store where you bought it.</p>
<p>You can also contact the FTC. Write: Correspondence Branch, Federal Trade Commission, Washington, DC 20580, or call: 
202-326-3693. Although the FTC cannot resolve your individual problem, the information you supply may reveal a pattern or 
practice requiring action by the Commission. You may be contacted if the FTC decides to investigate.</p>
<p>The FTC also would like to hear from you if you have bought clothing that has no care label attached. Give the name and 
address of the store and the manufacturer.</p>
<h4>What Else Does the Rule Require?</h4>
<p>Care labels must be firmly attached to clothing so that the two will not become separated. You should be able to see the label or 
find it easily. Care labels must remain legible during the useful life of the product.</p>
<p>Sometimes garments have two or more pieces. If the pieces are sold separately--or they require different care procedures--each 
must have its own label. Otherwise, only one label is necessary.</p>
<h4>Does &quot;Washable&quot; Mean it Also Can be Drycleaned?</h4>
<p>Not necessarily. A manufacturer or importer is required to list only one method of safe care for the garment--no matter how 
many other safe methods could be used. Further, the manufacturer or importer does not have to warn about care procedures 
that may be unsafe. So clothing labeled &quot;washable&quot; may not dryclean satisfactorily. The reverse also may be true.</p>
<h4>What About Trim?</h4>
<p>The care instruction on the label applies to all permanently attached parts of the garment, such as buttons, lining, or other 
decorative trim.</p>
<p>Labels that state &quot;Dryclean Only, Exclusive of Decorative Trim&quot; are unacceptable. They do not explain that the trim must be 
removed before the garment is cleaned. Also, they do not specify a separate care method for the trim.</p>
<h4>May I Remove the Care Label?</h4>
<p>At the time of purchase, care labels must be attached. This is important because you may take the care instructions into 
consideration when buying clothes.</p>
<p>Occasionally, you may wish to remove the care label. If you do, remember that you risk losing information about proper care of 
the garment.</p>

<h2>&quot;Green&quot; Advertising Claims</h2>
<h4>Green Advertising Claims: Points to Consider </h4>
<p>Like many consumers, you may be interested in buying products that are less harmful to the environment. You've probably seen 
products with such &quot;green&quot; claims as &quot;environmentally safe,&quot; &quot;recyclable,&quot; &quot;degradable,&quot; or &quot;ozone friendly.&quot;</p>
<p>But what do these claims really mean? How can you tell which products really are less harmful to the environment? This fact 
sheet offers some pointers to help you decide.</p>
<h4>Look for environmental claims that are specific.</h4>
<p>To evaluate environmental claims, look for product labels with specific information about the product or its packaging. For 
example, if a label says &quot;recycled,&quot; check how much of the product or packaging is recycled.</p>
<p>A growing number of labels on &quot;recycled&quot; products tell where the recycled material comes from. &quot;Post-consumer&quot; material 
comes from previously used business or consumer products, such as newspapers, plastic bottles, glass containers, or aluminum 
cans. &quot;Pre-consumer&quot; material, in contrast, is basically manufacturing waste. For example, an envelope manufacturer might 
recycle the clippings left over when envelopes are cut from paper. These clippings could be made into other paper products 
instead of being thrown away.</p>
<p>Some products and packages state that they use less material in the first place than previous or competing products. Make sure 
the claim says exactly what has been reduced, by how much, and compared to what. A claim such as &quot;20 percent less waste&quot; 
does not tell the whole story. Instead, look for claims such as &quot;20 percent less packaging than our previous package.&quot;</p>
<p>Labels with &quot;recyclable&quot; claims mean that these products can be collected and made into useful products. This is relevant to you, 
however, only if this material is collected for recycling in your community. Contact your local recycling office, trash hauler, or 
scrap dealer for this information.</p>
<p>Look for claims that clearly state whether they apply to the product, its packaging, or both. For example, the claim &quot;recycled 
content&quot; alone may not give you this information.</p>
<h4>Be wary of overly broad or vague environmental claims.</h4>
<p>Just as specific information about the environmental merits of products can be helpful, overly general or vague claims provide 
little information to help you make purchasing decisions. Labels with unqualified claims that a product is &quot;environmentally 
friendly,&quot; &quot;eco-safe,&quot; or &quot;environmentally safe&quot; have little meaning, for two reasons.</p>
<p>First, all products have some environmental impact, though some may have less impact than others. Second, these phrases alone 
do not provide the specific information needed to compare products and packaging on their environmental merits.</p>
<p>Similarly, claims like &quot;safe in a landfill&quot; or &quot;safe for incineration&quot; provide little help in choosing among products. Most consumer 
products pose little environmental risk when disposed of in properly designed and operated landfills or incinerators. Disposal 
safety depends more on how a waste facility is designed and managed than on the characteristics of any single material that is 
disposed.</p>
<h4>Degradable materials will not help save landfill space.</h4>
<p>Some products claim to be &quot;degradable.&quot; Biodegradable materials, like food and leaves, break down and decompose into 
elements found in nature when exposed to air, moisture, and bacteria or other organisms. Photodegradable materials, usually 
plastics, disintegrate into smaller pieces when exposed to enough sunlight.</p>
<p>Either way, however, degradation of any material occurs very slowly in landfills, where most garbage is sent. That's because 
modern landfills are designed, according to law, to minimize the entry of sunlight, air, and moisture into the landfill. This helps to 
prevent pollutants from the garbage from entering the air and drinking water supplies, but also greatly slows decomposition. Even 
organic materials like paper and food may take decades to decompose in a landfill.</p>
<p>In contrast to landfills, composting takes advantage of degradability. It turns degradable materials into usable 
compost--humus-like material that enriches the soil and returns nutrients to the earth. Some people compost yard trimmings and 
some food scraps in their backyards. Many communities collect leaves, grass, and other yard trimmings for composting. A very 
small number of communities are experimenting with large-scale composting of all the organic materials in collected garbage. 
When you see a &quot;compostable&quot; claim on a product or package, be sure you have access in your community to a facility that 
accepts that material for composting.</p>
<p>Cleaning products like detergents and shampoos often display &quot;biodegradable&quot; claims. In general, most of these products will 
degrade in wastewater systems--which has been true for years.</p>
<h4>Check &quot;ozone friendly&quot; and &quot;CFC-free&quot; claims carefully.</h4>
<p>CFCs are chemical substances called chlorofluorocarbons that can deplete the earth's protective ozone layer. They are used to 
provide coolant in air conditioners and refrigerators, to clean electronic parts, and to make certain plastic foam products. In 
1978, CFCs were banned for use as propellants in nearly all consumer aerosol products.</p>
<p>HCFCs, or hydrochlorofluorocarbons, are sometimes used as substitutes for CFCs. While HCFCs are much less damaging to 
the ozone layer than CFCs, they still cause some ozone depletion and are thus not safe for the ozone layer.</p>
<p>By law, CFCs, HCFCs, and other ozone-depleting substances are being phased out in all products and manufacturing processes 
over the next several years. Beginning in 1993, products containing or made with the most harmful ozone-depleting substances 
must be labeled to indicate this. Until then, you may not be able to tell from the label whether a product contains or is made with 
an ozone-depleting substance unless you contact the manufacturer.</p>
<h4>Think about ground level ozone, too.</h4>
<p>Don't confuse the ozone layer with ozone at the ground level. The ozone layer in the upper atmosphere is needed to prevent the 
sun's harmful radiation from reaching the earth. When ozone develops at the ground level, it forms smog, which can cause serious 
breathing problems.</p>
<p>One factor contributing to the formation of ground level ozone, or smog, is the release of substances called VOCs, or volatile 
organic compounds. Common VOC substances are alcohols, butane, propane, and isobutane. Although emissions from cars and 
factories are the major source of VOC releases to the environment, some consumer products also contribute to the problem. 
Products such as household cleaning products, floor polishes, charcoal lighter fluid, windshield washer fluid, and hair styling 
spray, gel, and mousse--whether in aerosol cans or spray pumps--may contain VOCs.</p>
<h4>Did you know...</h4>
<p>The Federal Trade Commission recently issued guides, with the cooperation of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and 
the Office of Consumer Affairs, for manufacturers and others who wish to make claims about the environmental features of 
products. These guides explain various circumstances in which the Federal Trade Commission considers use of &quot;green&quot; 
advertising claims to be misleading.</p>
<h4>For More Information</h4>
<h4>Contact the Environmental Protection Agency:</h4>
<p>If you would like information about EPA's publications on source reduction, recycling, and other waste management issues 
(including &quot;The Consumer's Handbook for Reducing Solid Waste&quot;), call the RCRA Hotline at 800-424-9346. (In the 
Washington, DC, area, call 703-412-9810.) If you would like information about EPA's publications on air pollution issues, call 
the National Air Toxics Information Clearinghouse at 919-541-0850.</p>
<h4>Contact the Federal Trade Commission:</h4>
<p>If you have questions or concerns about environmental advertising claims, write: Correspondence Branch, Federal Trade 
Commission, Washington, DC 20580, or call 202-326-2222. If you would like a copy of the &quot;Guides for the Use of 
Environmental Marketing Claims,&quot; call 202-326-3753.</p>
<h4>Contact the U.S. Office of Consumer Affairs: </h4>
<p>If you would like more information about &quot;green&quot; advertising claims and other consumer topics that are included in the

<p>This publication contains recommendations for responsible business practices in managing consumer complaints. Its objectives 
are to define and encourage exemplary standards of business conduct and to heighten business sensitivity to consumer needs and 
preferences, objectives that contribute to customer loyalty and good will.</p>
<p>While the recommendations are clearly applicable to the entire business community, they reflect a special effort to provide a 
service to small and medium-sized businesses.</p>
<p>The guide was developed under the sponsorship of the U.S. Department of Commerce's Office of Consumer Affairs. It was 
reviewed by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the agency charged with protecting the general public, consumers and 
businesses against anti-competitive behavior and unfair and deceptive business practices; and by members of the National 
Coalition for Consumer Education (NCCE). NCCE is a coalition of educators, government consumer officials, business 
consumer affairs professionals, and consumer group representatives whose common goal is to further consumer education 
efforts. This cooperative effort produced a publication which represents the perspective of consumers, business, educators, and 
government. Representatives spoke for themselves rather than for the organizations, agencies, or businesses with which they are 
affiliated.</p>
<p>This publication is one in a series of Consumer Affairs Guides for Business. It builds on publications issued in 1980-1984. The 
original reports were produced by the Society of Consumer Affairs Professionals in Business, an international professional 
organization of individuals with consumer affairs responsibilities in their respective companies, and by the National Association of 
Consumer Agency Administrators, which represents State and local consumer protection agencies.</p>
<p>This new edition updates the recommendations which are basic to an effective company complaint handling system. In an era of 
intense competition in international as well as domestic markets, customer satisfaction is the key to success. An effective 
mechanism for addressing complaints is essential to customer satisfaction, a major ingredient of a company's total quality 
process.</p>
<p>The Department of Commerce is grateful to the FTC, NCCE, and the individuals who contributed their time and expertise to 
review this report.</p>

<p><a name="introduction"><strong>Introduction</strong></a></p>
<p>Today's consumers seek more than price bargains--they want useful purchasing information, high quality, reliable and safe 
products, dependable servicing, and fair sales practices. Above all, they want to know that companies are trading in good faith. 
A company's failure to fulfill these expectations can breed dissatisfaction and antipathy, unless that business helps resolve 
resulting consumer complaints fairly and promptly.</p>
<p>In our global marketplace, where businesses compete both nationally and internationally, effective complaint management must 
be a priority for every business. The way a company reacts to complaints is a measure of its concern for the quality of its 
merchandise and services and of its desire for consumer satisfaction.</p>
<p>Markets are becoming more culturally diverse, more global in nature, and customers' expectations are changing. As the 
marketplace changes, staying close to the consumer is of increasing importance. Complaints are a critical form of communication 
between buyer and seller. They offer business an opportunity to correct immediate problems and they frequently provide 
constructive ideas for improving products, adapting marketing practices, upgrading servicing, or modifying promotional material 
and product information.</p>
<p>Government agencies encourage businesses to settle their own disputes directly and, if necessary, to make supplemental use of 
third-party complaint systems that often enlist the participation of business, consumers, and government. Then consumer 
protection agencies and the courts can devote their time and resources to responding to serious violations of law and problems 
solvable only by government action.</p>
<p>Recognizing the importance of responding fairly and efficiently to buyer disappointment in the marketplace, many businesses have 
established effective and innovative systems for resolving consumer complaints. However, not all companies have made effective 
complaint management a routine part of their business operations. Within any industry, those companies with a positive 
philosophy and reputation for fair complaint management have a competitive edge. Effective complaint management leads to 
increased customer satisfaction, which in turn, yields greater brand loyalty.</p>
<p>This publication discusses why it is in business' own interest to give a high priority to effective complaint management. It 
recommends practical procedures for reviewing and resolving consumer complaints and for using them as management and 
marketing tools.</p>
<p>The first six recommendations address in-house complaint management systems. They focus on important elements such as 
management commitment, style, staffing, procedures, and recordkeeping. Recommendation 7 encourages businesses to use 
third-party dispute resolution systems to supplement company complaint programs. It identifies procedural safeguards that help 
insure fair dispute resolution. The publication concludes with a complaint management checklist to help businesses evaluate and 
refine their own complaint management strategies.</p>
<p><a name="recommend"><strong>Recommendations For Managing Consumer Complaints</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>RECOMMENDATION 1</strong></p>
<p><strong>Every company, regardless of its size or the price of its products, needs an effective strategy for managing consumer 
complaints and inquiries.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Effective complaint management enhances a company's reputation, builds consumer confidence and loyalty, and 
attracts new customers.</strong></p>
<p>By talking back when they believe they have not received their money's worth, consumers give business an opportunity to 
correct the immediate problem and restore good will. Experience shows that consumers who complain about products and 
services continue to shop with the businesses and buy the products they complain about--if they believe the complaint was 
resolved fairly.</p>
<p>Conversely, consumers who do not complain directly to business may simply withdraw their patronage and criticize the company 
or the product to others. Research into complaint behavior reveals that only a fraction of dissatisfied consumers complains to 
business and thereby gives the company an opportunity to correct the problem. There is evidence that some consumers do not 
complain because they are skeptical about business' willingness or ability to resolve disputes fairly. Others don't report problems 
because they don't know where or how to complain, or they don't believe it is worth the inconvenience.</p>
<p>Such findings underscore the importance to business of a complaint management system that is well publicized and easily 
accessible. An unregistered complaint may do as much harm as one that is mismanaged or unresolved.</p>
<p><strong>Effective complaint management can result in increased sales, better products, improved personnel performance, 
and business economies.</strong></p>
<p>Complaints are an inexpensive source of market research. When properly compiled, complaint data can indicate how consumers 
interpret company advertising, how products and services meet (or do not meet) consumer expectations, how instruction 
manuals and other consumer information can be improved, and how products can be designed better.</p>
<p>Complaints may signal a need for better systems of quality control at the production level. They may tell management of 
improvements that can be made in training and supervision of sales and service personnel.</p>
<p>Careful complaint management can save business unwanted costs. For example, negative word-of-mouth publicity from 
dissatisfied consumers means lost revenue and necessitates additional investment in advertising to attract replacement customers. 
Also, careful complaint analysis may reveal product defects that could lead to expensive recalls, if uncorrected. The possibility of 
costly lawsuits over warranty performance or product liability provides an additional financial incentive to use complaints as one 
means of identifying problems early.</p>
<p>Finally, it is to business' advantage to settle complaints promptly and equitably when they are first brought to the attention of 
business. It is more costly to resolve complaints that have been taken to outside parties, such as State or Federal agencies, or the 
courts.</p>
<p><strong>Effective complaint management strategies can involve the use of tollfree numbers.</strong></p>
<p>Increasingly, companies are finding that toll-free numbers are an effective tool for achieving the goals listed above. Toll-free 
numbers give consumers an uncomplicated, immediate, personal, and free means of resolving problems or getting answers to 
questions. Barriers which might otherwise prevent consumers from complaining are overcome. In short, toll-free numbers can 
mean increased customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>Because toll-free numbers make company services so accessible, more consumers are likely to contact those businesses that use 
them for customer relations. Increased contact by phone can yield more detailed marketing information, including the 
identification of the causes of problems and ideas for new products.</p>
<p>While establishing toll-free numbers involves costs to a business, the ability to respond immediately to consumer complaints and 
inquiries may reduce expenses and increase profits in the long run. Such direct customer contact provides business with 
opportunities for consumer education to prevent problems from escalating or occurring in the future. It also enables business to 
introduce other products to consumers, thereby increasing sales.</p>
<p><strong>Effective complaint management helps business meet its responsibility to cooperate with Federal and State 
regulatory agencies.</strong></p>
<p>When business solves easily-remedied problems with individual consumers, it reduces the possibility of government intervention 
into routine buyer/seller relations and allows public agencies to devote their limited resources to correcting violations of law. In 
cases where business has an obligation to report problems to the government, effective complaint management procedures are 
critical. For example, the Consumer Product Safety Act requires business to report promptly to the Consumer Product Safety 
Commission when it learns of safety defects in consumer products. (See companion guide, CONSUMER PRODUCT 
SAFETY.) Also, consumer complaints may contain evidence of fraud, which both consumers and business have a duty to report 
to law enforcement officials.</p>
<p>It is a good policy for business to work with consumer protection officials at the State and Federal levels to remedy complaints 
and correct any patterns of unfair business practice that become apparent through complaint trends. Most Federal agencies do 
not have authority to remedy individual consumer complaints, although many can enact regulations to control industry-wide 
problems and can bring enforcement actions against companies whose conduct violates consumer protection laws.</p>
<p>At the State level, however, statutes generally assign responsibility for complaint investigation to particular State agencies--usually 
the Office of Consumer Protection, or Department of Consumer Affairs. It is advisable for consumer relations personnel within 
business organizations to have good working relationships with their counterparts in consumer protection agencies.</p>
<p><strong>RECOMMENDATION 2</strong></p>
<p><strong>Company management should establish the capacity, policies, and procedures necessary to provide effective 
complaint review and resolution.</strong></p>
<p>Management attitudes are reflected in the conduct of employees and the performance of the company. <strong>Top level commitment 
to effective complaint management establishes the motive and incentives for all personnel to strive for consumer 
satisfaction.</strong></p>
<p>Because every employee has responsibility for satisfying customers, all staff must be well trained and empowered to quickly and 
fairly resolve complaints and handle inquiries. Although companies have reason to locate the consumer relations and complaint 
management functions centrally within the organization, each interaction the consumer has with an employee of the business is an 
opportunity to build customer loyalty through effective complaint management.</p>
<p>Management's responsibility begins with the preparation of written policies and procedures for speedy and fair complaint 
resolution. The complaint management strategy and company policy on refunds, exchanges, and repairs will vary, of course, 
depending on the nature of the product or service, the terms of purchase, and other factors.</p>
<p><strong>These policies and procedures should be put in writing and communicated to all departments, </strong>with emphasis on the 
accountability of individual employees for courteous and fair resolution of complaints. Guidelines should clearly state cases where 
front-line employees are empowered to resolve complaints on the spot. If clear lines of authority are established by management, 
consumer problems should be solved effectively. In addition, when employees understand management's philosophy and their 
own responsibility for putting it into effect, they can save consumers the frustration of repeatedly filing the same complaint or 
having to turn to outside agencies for assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Management should regularly review and, when necessary, find ways to improve complaint management procedures. 
</strong>Particular attention should be given to refining communication and coordination between complaint management and operating 
departments. Periodic surveys of consumers will reveal whether they feel they have been well served by the complaint processing 
procedures, and whether they find the company's policies on refunds, repairs, exchanges, and other forms of redress to be fair.</p>
<p><strong>Short- and long-range planning should include adequate budget and staff allocations for consumer service and 
complaint management. </strong>The administrative costs of complaint management should be borne by business, not by the individual 
consumers who register the complaints. Retailers and manufacturers may want to agree on a formula for sharing costs of 
complaint resolution.</p>
<p>Sometimes costs are associated with providing a remedy. By law, products under full warranty must be repaired or replaced at 
no cost to the consumer, even if this involves transportation and reinstallation. (See companion publication on PRODUCT 
WARRANTIES &amp; SERVICING for additional guidance.) Company policy toward returns of products not under full warranty 
should avoid placing unreasonable costs or burdens upon consumers. For example, it may be reasonable to ask customers to 
pay the postage to mail small items back to the manufacturer for repairs, but it would be unreasonable to require customers to 
transport heavy or cumbersome items. To minimize cost and inconvenience, manufacturers might arrange to have retailers accept 
returns and make exchanges for which they are reimbursed by the manufacturer.</p>
<p><strong>Company management should closely supervise complaint review and resolution. </strong>In small companies, owners and 
managers can be personally involved in consumer relations on a regular basis. In larger companies, reporting and review 
procedures enable management to monitor the operation of the complaint management system and to stay in touch with 
consumer response to products and services.</p>
<p><strong>While all employees must be responsive to consumer complaints and inquiries, day-to-day responsibility for 
complaint processing and resolution should be assigned to individuals who are both accessible to consumers and able 
to follow complaints through to final resolution. </strong>All staff should be prepared to receive and, if possible, resolve consumer 
complaints regardless of their primary position in the company. When complaint management is centered in a specific area of the 
organization, all employees should quickly follow through to see that consumer complaints are correctly referred and handled. 
Independent authority for complaint management avoids possible conflicts within the company. Employees whose primary 
responsibility is sales or servicing, for example, may have difficulty resolving complaints objectively if they feel their performance 
rating could be adversely affected.</p>
<p><strong>Staff should be selected carefully for this sensitive consumer relations function. </strong>Consumers with complaints can be 
upset or angry. Therefore, employees need to be patient, articulate, and able to balance fairly the interests of the company and 
those of the consumer. They also should be able to communicate legitimate consumer complaints to management with the 
objective of helping to determine if changes in company policies or procedures are needed.</p>
<p>All staff should be familiar with the operations of the company and with its products and services. Training can strengthen 
interviewing and communications skills and heighten the staff's awareness of special needs of consumers from different cultural, 
economic, or educational backgrounds. Also, complaint management staff should be familiar with consumer protection laws and 
with the operations of third-party dispute resolution mechanisms to which particularly difficult complaints may need to be 
referred.</p>
<p>Finally, customer relations personnel should have professional status, adequate salaries, and opportunities for advancement 
consistent with the importance management assigns to consumer satisfaction.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>RECOMMENDATION 3</strong></p>
<p><strong>The basic steps of the complaint management strategy can be adapted to the resources and needs of individual 
businesses.</strong></p>
<p>Basic principles of sound complaint management apply regardless of com- pany type or size. (See Appendix A for Complaint 
Management Checklist.) Actual operating procedures can be adapted to the needs and resources of a particular company. (See 
Appendix B for additional sources of guidance.) The system need not be costly or elaborate, so long as the essential functions 
are performed efficiently, courteously, and fairly.</p>
<p>BASIC STEPS FOR EFFECTIVE COMPLAINT MANAGEMENT:</p>
<p><strong>Designate Location(s) to Receive Complaints</strong> Consumers need to know where and how to file complaints or make 
inquiries. Therefore: </p>
<ul>
<li>Select places and means (such as a toll-free number) to receive complaints that are visible and accessible to consumers. </li>
<li>Publicize the complaint system to encourage consumers to voice their dissatisfactions and to make apparent the good 
intentions of the company. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Develop a System for Recordkeeping</strong></p>
<p>Computerization can streamline the complaint management process, de- creasing response times for consumers, eliminating the 
need for extensive paper files, and speeding report generation and analyses for top management. </p>
<ul>
<li>Develop computerized or paper forms for recording, categorizing, and filing complaint records. </li>
<li>Design the system and/or use software to perform functions including: <ul>
<li>communicating complaint data and analyses to top management; </li>
<li>permitting swift identification and response when complaints should be reported to other departments or companies 
in the distribution network, or to law enforcement or regulatory agencies; </li>
<li>providing market research through complaint trends; </li>
<li>enabling management to monitor the efficiency and effectiveness of the complaint management system. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Process and Record Complaints</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Log in the complaint and relevant data. </li>
<li>Categorize it for resolution and recordkeeping. Categories must be clearly defined and exclusive of one another. </li>
<li>Assign the complaint to one person for handling. </li>
<li>Forward the complaint to another level of authority, only when necessary. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Acknowledge Complaint</strong></p>
<p>Consumers do not register complaints with only a casual interest in their disposition. Complaining involves some inconvenience 
and, possibly, ex- pense. Loyal customers with strong feelings are often involved. Therefore: </p>
<ul>
<li>Talk directly to the customer by phone or in person whenever possible. </li>
<li>Use mailgrams or letters when necessary, but avoid impersonal form letters. </li>
<li>Take extra time, if needed, to help consumers with special needs, such as language barriers or disabilities. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Investigate and Analyze the Complaint</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Be fair. </li>
<li>Get both sides of the story. </li>
<li>Keep records of all meetings, conversations, or findings in the complaint database or file. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Resolve the Problem in a Manner Consistent with Established Goals for Customer Satisfaction</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Empower front-line employees to authorize satisfactory solutions to problems. </li>
<li>Forward the complaint to another level of authority for resolution only when absolutely necessary. </li>
<li>Act swiftly, keeping the consumer informed through progress reports. </li>
<li>Notify the consumer promptly of a proposed settlement.. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Follow Up</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Find out if the consumer is satisfied with the resolution. Was it carried out? </li>
<li>Refer the complaint to a third-party dispute resolution mechanism, if necessary. </li>
<li>Cooperate with the third-party mechanism. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Prepare and File a Report on the Disposition of the Complaint; Periodically Analyze and Summarize Complaints</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Circulate complaint statistics and action proposals to appropriate departments. </li>
<li>Develop an action plan for complaint prevention. </li>
<li>Make sure the consumer viewpoint is given appropriate consideration in company decision-making. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>RECOMMENDATION 4</strong></p>
<p><strong>Complaint management systems should be publicized and explained to employees, consumers, and the public.</strong></p>
<p>A complaint management system must be visible and accessible in order to serve consumers and accomplish company goals. 
Management, sales, service and public relations personnel should all cooperate to make the complaint system accessible to 
consumers. There are many ways to publicize the system, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>On posters and signs in the sales and service area. On contract forms and sales slips. </li>
<li>In charge account mailings. </li>
<li>In use and care manuals. </li>
<li>In advertising--your company's complaint system could be the theme of an advertising campaign. </li>
<li>On product packaging and labeling, or on products themselves, if feasible. </li>
<li>Through consumer information programs such as videotapes, booklets, and educational activities. </li>
</ul>
<p>Instructing consumers of their responsibilities can help avoid misunderstandings and unnecessary complaints. Educating and 
informing consumers establishes realistic expectations and increases customer satisfaction. Include advice in the material that 
advertises your complaint system and have sales and service personnel encourage consumers to: </p>
<ul>
<li>Carefully read promotional material and product literature before buying. </li>
<li>Follow instructions in use and care manuals. </li>
<li>Understand the terms of sale (warranties and guarantees, contracts, credit terms, refund policies, and so on).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>RECOMMENDATION 5</strong></p>
<p><strong>Effective complaint management should serve to reduce the causes for consumer complaints.</strong></p>
<p>Complaints and complaint trends tell business how to do its job better by alerting management to problems which need prompt 
attention and correction. Furthermore, they indicate long-range opportunities for product innovation and problem prevention. A 
well-planned system for screening and recording complaint data can provide answers to such important questions as: </p>
<ul>
<li>Are products &quot;over-sold&quot; or &quot;over-advertised&quot;? Is advertising clearly understood? </li>
<li>Are salespeople overzealous? </li>
<li>Do product disclosures (such as labeling, warranty information, and service agreements) need to be improved? </li>
<li>Are user's manuals clear, complete, and easy-to-read? </li>
<li>Would alterations in warranty coverage reduce complaints? </li>
</ul>
<p>Complaints also provide information about product quality: </p>
<ul>
<li>Are there opportunities for product improvements or better quality control? </li>
<li>Are there indications of safety defects that should be reported and corrected, or that justify a recall? </li>
</ul>
<p>To get this valuable feedback, complaint reporting must generate information swiftly and systematically to the appropriate 
manager or departments. Initial screening should trigger immediate action, when necessary, and statistical summaries should 
identify trends and long-range courses of action.</p>
<p><strong>RECOMMENDATION </strong>6</p>
<p><strong>Complaints should be resolved by the retailer. If that proves difficult or impossible, the manufacturer should aid in 
the resolution.</strong></p>
<p>Direct, swift, and informal complaint resolution is advantageous to all concerned--consumers, business, government, and the 
courts. Consumers are likely to turn first to the place of purchase--retail store, service establishment, contractor, and so on. 
Resolving complaints at this level avoids unnecessary consumer frustration and preserves the direct buyer/seller relationship. 
Moreover, it is likely to be relatively easy, quick, and economical.</p>
<p>Still, it is important that companies coordinate complaint management with others in their distribution network. Retailers, 
manufacturers, and service outlets mutually benefit from keeping one another informed of complaints and complaint trends and 
cooperating when necessary to see that complaints are fully and satisfactorily resolved.</p>
<p>Some laws (warranty and product safety laws, for example) assign overlapping responsibilities to all businesses in the distribution 
chain for disclosing information to consumers and for identifying and correcting problems associated with products and services. 
Also, government regulatory agencies may step in if businesses themselves do not correct problems that result in recurring 
patterns of complaints.</p>
<p>Manufacturers should encourage consumers and retailers to contact them when a dispute cannot be resolved at the place of 
purchase. Complaint systems at the retail level should be structured to isolate those matters which need the immediate attention 
of manufacturers. These include complaints which suggest possible design or production defects that affect product safety and 
performance. Also, complaints forwarded from the retail level can help manufacturers evaluate their own policies toward 
warranty coverage, for example, or identify advertising or labeling which needs to be clarified, or learn things about product 
performance or marketing that are revealed only after wide distribution.</p>
<p><strong>RECOMMENDATION 7</strong></p>
<p><strong>Businesses should use third-party dispute resolution mechanisms to supplement in-house complaint management.</strong></p>
<p>If complaints cannot be resolved directly between the consumer and retailer or manufacturer, they should be referred to 
third-party dispute resolution. Third-party mechanisms use the services of unbiased individuals to resolve disputes through 
conciliation, mediation, and/or arbitration.</p>
<p><strong>Conciliation: </strong>A neutral conciliator brings the parties together and encourages them to find a mutually acceptable resolution of 
the dispute.</p>
<p><strong>Mediation: </strong>A neutral mediator becomes actively involved in negotiations between the parties. The mediator can propose a 
resolution, but cannot dictate a settlement of the dispute.</p>
<p><strong>Arbitration: </strong>An independent individual or panel hears the facts on both sides of a dispute and reaches a decision by which both 
parties have previously agreed to abide. In some systems, only the business agrees in advance to abide by the outcome of the 
arbitration.</p>
<p>Third-party dispute resolution is advantageous to business because it enables expeditious, economical, and fair complaint 
resolution without government regulation or legal action. In fact, government agencies encourage the use of third-party 
mechanisms when complaints cannot be resolved directly between buyer and seller. Proponents of third-party systems point out 
that their use can help make manufacturers and retailers more responsive to consumer problems. By submitting disputes to a 
neutral decision-maker, business can demonstrate its good will in the form of a willingness to seek unbiased solutions to 
consumer complaints.</p>
<p>The number of third-party dispute mechanisms has grown. For some time, government offices of consumer protection in many 
jurisdictions have used mediation to settle disputes between business and consumers. The Better Business Bureau was one of the 
pioneers in the use of arbitration to settle consumer disputes. Better Business Bureaus in all metropolitan areas now offer this 
service. Arbitration has been written into several consent agreements between the Federal Trade Commission and businesses 
subject to frequent consumer complaints.</p>
<p>Because their value has been proven, third-party dispute resolution programs have been established by trade associations and 
some individual companies to resolve complaints involving a particular industry or product brand.* Also, some State legislatures 
have established arbitration procedures for certain types of disputes, such as medical malpractice or automobile lemon law 
complaints.</p>
<p>*(One of oldest privately-sponsored third-party programs is the Major Appliance Consumer Action Panel (MACAP), organized 
in 1969. Dispute resolution programs now exist in several industries, including automobile, funeral services, and home 
construction. Some corporations, including major auto manufacturers, sponsor their own third-party complaint systems).</p>
<p>Accumulated experience has enabled the government and business organizations to refine the procedures followed by third-party 
mechanisms to better insure due process and settlements that are fair to both parties. Businesses considering the use of a 
third-party system should evaluate it against criteria and standards developed by the government and the more advanced 
privately-sponsored mechanisms. (See Appendix B for a list of organizations that can provide additional information and 
guidance.)</p>
<p>The Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act has a section which requires that informal dispute settlement procedures which are 
voluntarily incorporated into the terms of a written warranty must comply with the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) Rule on 
Informal Dispute Settlement Procedures (16 C.F.R. 703). The FTC will advise businesses on selecting in-house and third-party 
complaint resolution procedures. (See Appendix C for more detail on the essential attributes of effective and fair third-party 
complaint resolution mechanisms.) In addition, the FTC has recently published a booklet, <i>Road to Resolution: Settling 
Consumer Disputes</i>, which provides consumers with detailed information on the types of dispute resolution programs that are 
available, and how to use them.</p>
<p>A small percentage of consumers and businesses seek more formal thirdparty complaint resolution in small claims court. Use of 
the courts can be cumbersome and costly for both sides and usually can be avoided if a good faith effort is made to resolve 
disputes at the company level or through informal dispute resolution.</p>
<p>Many State and local offices of consumer protection have the power to enter into litigation on behalf of consumers. In addition to 
the cost, the adverse publicity associated with being sued by a consumer protection agency is a powerful incentive to business to 
use efficient, informal complaint management and to study complaint trends to be sure that company practices are well within the 
boundaries defined by consumer protection laws.</p>
<p><a name="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></a></p>
<p>Complaint management systems and company policies on refunds, exchanges, and product servicing vary widely depending on 
the nature of the product or service, the terms of purchase, consumer use patterns, and so on. There is no single formula that will 
provide universal relief for dissatisfied consumers. However, industry and government experience with complaint management 
has shown that the procedures and safeguards recommended here provide a sound basis for an efficient and fair complaint 
program.</p>
<p>The commitment and continuing involvement of company management is critical to successful complaint resolution and to the 
optimum use of complaints as a management tool. Management involvement and review will help discover new ways to improve 
both the complaint management system and the fairness of remedies offered to consumers.</p>
<p><a name="a"><strong>APPENDIX A</strong></a></p>

<p>Characteristics of Third-Party Complaint Resolution Mechanisms</p>
<p>Availability and Convenience:</p>
<ul>
<li>Written information about how to contact the system and how it works; </li>
<li>Access to the system as soon as a reasonable attempt has been made to settle the dispute directly; </li>
<li>Convenient hours of operation. </li>
</ul>
<p>Fair Procedures: </p>
<ul>
<li>Meetings open to the public or to public officials; </li>
<li>Sufficient financing so there is no cost (or minimal cost) to the consumer; </li>
<li>Agreement in advance about who will be bound by the decision; </li>
<li>Guidelines to insure the impartiality of staff and decision-makers and thereby inspire consumer confidence; <ul>
<li>Rules to insure the fairness of investigations; </li>
<li>Opportunities for oral or written presentations by the parties; </li>
<li>Reasonable timetables for decision-making; </li>
<li>Annual independent audits of complaint management records or public access to records; </li>
<li>Periodic independent audits and self-evaluation of the system; </li>
<li>Disclosure to the disputing parties of additional avenues of redress, including small claims court. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Follow-through: </p>
<ul>
<li>Verification that the agreed-upon resolution has been carried out; </li>
<li>Identification and reporting of complaint patterns to affected businesses for voluntary corrective action and, if necessary, 
to government agencies for investigation. </li>
</ul>
<p>Either public scrutiny or access by public officials is essential to insure the system is working as it should. Independent audits are 
absolutely necessary when public access is limited in any way. Even the very best written rules have little meaning unless they are 
conscientiously and consistently followed. There have been instances in which State law enforcement officials have had to 
intervene to make sure third-party systems properly follow their own procedures.</p>
<p>Additional information about third-party complaint resolution is available from the Division of Marketing Practices at the Federal 
Trade Commission. Copies of the FTC publication <i>The Road to Resolution: Settling Consumer Disputes</i> are available from 
the Office of Public Reference at the Commission.</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Negative Option Plans for Books, Records, Videos -- October 1992</h2>
<p>If you are looking for a convenient way to build your book, audio, or video collections, you may be eyeing advertisements that 
promise to deliver popular books, recordings, or films right to your door on a regular basis. Before signing up with any &quot;club&quot; that 
periodically delivers such merchandise--and uses a negative option plan--read the contract carefully.</p>
<p>This brochure describes how negative option plans work and explains your rights under the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) 
Negative Option Rule. It also offers some tips to consider before subscribing to a negative option plan.</p>
<h4>How the Plan Works</h4>
<p>An ad for a book, audio, or video club may read, &quot;Five selections for $1.00!&quot; If you agree to accept the merchandise, you also 
may be agreeing to buy additional selections under the club's negative option plan.</p>
<p>Under a negative option plan, the seller periodically sends you announcements that describe the current selection and the newest 
offerings from the seller's inventory. Once you receive an announcement, you can decide whether you want to receive the 
selection or not.</p>
<p>If you want the selection, do nothing; the seller will ship it to you automatically. If you do not want the selection, you must tell the 
seller not to send it. You do this by returning the announcement card to the seller by a certain date.</p>
<p>You also may use the announcement card to order an alternate offering. Under the terms of your contract, you may be required 
to buy a certain number of selections over a specified period of time.</p>
<h4>What the Seller Must Tell You</h4>
<p>Under the Negative Option Rule, sellers must clearly and conspicuously give you certain information about their plan in any 
promotional materials. For example, the seller must tell you:</p>
<h4>How many selections you must buy, if any</h4>
<p>Sometimes sellers offer substantial discounts on your first selections, but then require you to buy a certain number of additional 
selections at the club's regular prices.</p>
<h4>How and when you can cancel your membership</h4>
<p>Once you have satisfied any minimum purchase requirements, you can cancel your club membership. After the seller receives 
your written request to cancel, your membership must be cancelled promptly.</p>
<h4>How to notify the seller when you do not want the selection</h4>
<p>Look for a &quot;negative option&quot; form that comes with, or is part of, an announcement telling you about the selection. Return this 
form to the seller to cancel shipment of the &quot;selection,&quot; or to choose a different offering.</p>
<h4>When to return the &quot;negative option&quot; form to cancel shipment of a selection</h4>
<p>You have ten days to decide whether you wish to receive the selection. The form will mention either a &quot;return date,&quot; which is the 
date the form must be received by the seller, or a &quot;mailing date,&quot; which is the date the form must be mailed to the seller.</p>
<h4>When you can get credit for the return of a selection</h4>
<p>If you have not had at least ten days to decide--and you receive an unwanted shipment--you can return the selection to the seller 
for a full credit to your account. The seller must guarantee return postage. The FTC's Negative Option Rule also states that you 
are entitled to a credit when:</p>
<p>The seller received your negative response by the &quot;return date,&quot; or you mailed the form before the &quot;mailing date&quot;</p>
<p>The seller received your form after the &quot;return date&quot; but the form was postmarked at least three days before the &quot;return date&quot;</p>
<p>The seller received a written letter cancelling your membership and you have completed the terms of your club membership. You 
only need to return the first selection that is sent after the seller receives your written cancellation notice.</p>
<p>If the seller sends additional selections, you may consider them unordered merchandise and may keep them as a gift. However, 
in order to avoid dunning notices, it is best to inform the seller that you are no longer a member. Send the seller a copy of your 
letter cancelling the membership.</p>
<h4>How postage and handling costs are charged</h4>
<p>Postage and handling may be charged for each item that is shipped to you. The seller must disclose that you will be billed for 
postage and handling.</p>
<h4>How often you will receive announcements and forms</h4>
<p>The seller must tell you how often announcements and forms will be mailed to you. The seller also must specify the maximum 
number of announcements that will be sent in a 12-month period.</p>
<h4>If the Seller Offers &quot;Bonus&quot; Merchandise</h4>
<p>To attract new subscribers, some sellers offer special introductory merchandise. Under the Rule, the seller must ship this 
merchandise within 30 days of receiving an order.</p>
<p>If the merchandise cannot be shipped due to circumstances beyond the seller's control, the seller may offer an equivalent 
alternative. If you do not want to accept any substitutes, you have the option of cancelling your membership. The seller must 
comply with your cancellation request, as long as you return any other introductory merchandise you may have received.</p>
<h4>How to Protect Yourself</h4>
<p>Although the negative option plan may offer &quot;free&quot; or &quot;discounted&quot; merchandise to new subscribers, be sure to consider the 
overall cost of the plan, including any shipping charges. If you are required to buy additional merchandise, you may want to 
compare the club's regular prices against those of other sellers.</p>
<p>If you are unfamiliar with the seller, you may want to contact your local consumer protection agency or Better Business Bureau 
to find out if they have any information on the seller. If you subscribe, keep copies of the seller's promotional materials as well as 
any &quot;negative option&quot; forms you return to the seller and the dates that you mail them.</p>
<h4>If You Have a Complaint</h4>
<p>If you have a problem with your plan, try to resolve it with the seller. If that does not work, you can report any problems to the 
FTC. Write: Correspondence Branch, Federal Trade Commission, Washington, DC 20580. Although the FTC usually does not 
intervene in individual cases, the information you provide may indicate a pattern of possible law violations requiring action by the 
Commission .</p>
<p>Further, if your problem involves a billing dispute with the seller and the payment was charged to a credit card, you may be able 
to resolve the dispute using the Fair Credit Billing Act (FCBA). To learn more about FCBA, ask for a free copy of the FTC's 
brochure, Fair Credit Billing. Write: Public Reference, Federal Trade Commission, Washington, DC 20580. You also may write 
to this address to receive a free copy of Best Sellers, a listing of all the FTC's consumer publications.</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Personal Emergency Response Systems -- March 1993</h2>
<p>Produced in cooperation with the American Association of Retired Persons</p>
<p>A Personal Emergency Response System (PERS) is an electronic device designed to let you summon help in an emergency. If 
you are a disabled or an older person living alone, you may be thinking about buying a PERS (also called a Medical Emergency 
Response System). This brochure describes how a PERS works, and what to consider when shopping for a system.</p>
<h4>How a PERS Works</h4>
<p>A PERS has three components: a small radio transmitter (a help button carried or worn by the user); a console connected to the 
user's telephone; and an emergency response center that monitors calls.</p>
<p>When emergency help (medical, fire, or police) is needed, the person presses the transmitter's help button. It sends a radio signal 
to the console. The console automatically dials one or more pre-selected emergency telephone numbers. Most systems can dial 
out even if the phone is in use or off the hook. (This is called &quot;seizing the line.&quot;)</p>
<p>Most PERS are programmed to telephone an emergency response center where the call is identified and handled. The center will 
try to determine the nature of the emergency. Center staff also will review your medical history and check to see who is to be 
notified.</p>
<p>If the center cannot contact you or determine whether an emergency exists, it will alert emergency service providers to go to your 
home. With most systems, the center will monitor the situation until the crisis is resolved.</p>
<h4>Transmitters</h4>
<p>Transmitters are light-weight, battery-powered devices that are activated by pressing one or two buttons. They can be worn on a 
chain around the neck or on a wrist band, or they can be carried on a belt or in a pocket. Because help buttons are battery 
powered, the batteries must be checked periodically to ensure they work. Some units have an indicator to help you know when 
to change batteries.</p>
<h4>The Console</h4>
<p>The console acts as an automatic dialing machine and sends the emergency alert through the phone lines. It works with any 
private telephone line and generally does not require rewiring. If you have more than one phone extension, a special jack or 
wiring may be required to enable the console to seize the line.</p>
<h4>The Emergency Response Center</h4>
<p>There are two types of emergency response centers _ provider-based and manufacturer-based. Provider-based centers usually 
are located in the user's local area and are operated by hospitals or social service agencies. Manufacturer-based operations 
usually have one national center. Sometimes, consumers who purchase systems can choose between provider-based and 
manufacturer-based centers, but consumers who rent systems from a PERS manufacturer generally must use its national center.</p>
<h4>Purchasing, Renting, or Leasing a PERS</h4>
<p>A PERS can be purchased, rented, or leased. Neither Medicare nor Medicaid, in most states, will pay for the purchase of 
equipment, nor will most insurance companies. The few insurance companies that do pay require a doctor's recommendation. 
Some hospitals and social service agencies may subsidize fees for low-income users. Purchase prices for a PERS normally range 
from $200 to more than $1,500. However, some consumers have reported paying $4,000 to $5,000 for a PERS. Therefore, it 
is important to know and compare prices. In addition to the purchase price, you must pay an installation fee and a monthly 
monitoring charge which ranges from $10 to $30.</p>
<p>Rentals are available through national manufacturers, local distributors, hospitals, and social service agencies. Monthly fees may 
range from $15 to $50 and usually include the monitoring service.</p>
<p>Lease agreements can be long-term or lease-to-purchase. If you lease, review the contract carefully before signing. Make special 
note of cancellation clauses, which may require you to pay a cancellation fee or other charges.</p>
<p>Before purchasing, renting, or leasing a system, check the unit for defects. Ask to see the warranty and service contract and get 
any questions resolved. Ask about the repair policy. Find out how to arrange for a replacement or repair if a malfunction occurs.</p>
<p>If a PERS salesperson solicits you by phone, and you are interested in the device, use the call to find out about the product. If 
you want more information, ask the salesperson to send you material to learn about prices, system features, and services. You 
can then use this information to comparison shop among other PERS providers. If the salesperson is reluctant to provide 
information except through an in-home visit, you may not want to do business with the company. In-home sales visits can expose 
you to high-pressure salespersons who may urge you to buy before you are ready to make a decision.</p>
<p>Before doing business with companies selling PERS, you may want to contact your local consumer protection agency, state 
Attorney General's Office, and Better Business Bureau (BBB). Ask if any complaints have been filed against the companies you 
are considering. You also may want to get recommendations from friends, neighbors, or relatives who use emergency response 
systems.</p>
<h4>Shopping Checklist</h4>
<p>To help you shop for a PERS that meets your needs, consider the following suggestions:</p>
<p>Check out several systems before making a decision.</p>
<p>Find out if you can use the system with other response centers. For example, can you use the same system if you move?</p>
<p>Ask about the pricing, features, and servicing of each system and compare costs.</p>
<p>Make sure the system is easy for you to use.</p>
<p>Test the system to make sure it works from every point in and around your home. Make sure nothing interferes with 
transmissions.</p>
<p>Read your purchase, rental, or lease agreement carefully before signing.</p>
<h4>Questions to Ask the Response Center</h4>
<p>You also may want to ask questions about the response center:</p>
<p>Is the monitoring center available 24 hours a day?</p>
<p>What is the average response time?</p>
<p>What kind of training does the center staff receive?</p>
<p>What procedures does the center use to test systems in your home? How often are tests conducted?</p>
<h4>Where to Complain</h4>
<p>If you have a problem with your PERS, try to resolve it first with the company and the response center. If you are not satisfied, 
contact your local consumer protection agency, state Attorney General's Office, and your BBB. You also may file a complaint 
with the Federal Trade Commission. Write: Correspondence Branch, Federal Trade Commission, Washington, D.C. 20580. 
Although the Commission cannot resolve individual disputes, the information you provide may indicate a pattern of possible law 
violations requiring action by the Commission.</p>
<h4>For More Information</h4>
<p>To learn more about Personal Emergency Response Systems, you may send for &quot;Product Report: PERS&quot; from the American 
Association of Retired Persons (AARP). The Report lists features of 20 PERS brands and offers shopping tips. To obtain a free 
copy, send a postcard with the title and stock number D12905 to: AARP (EE0281), P.O. Box 22796, Long Beach, CA

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Toy Ads on TV -- April 1993</h2>
<p>Produced in cooperation with the Children's Advertising Unit Council of Better Business Bureaus</p>
<p>Toys advertised on television are often important parts of a child's birthday and holiday &quot;wish lists.&quot;</p>
<p>Television advertisements are an important source of information about toys. Ads show children new products and help illustrate 
how those products perform.</p>
<p>Some children, particularly younger ones, may have trouble discerning in an ad how a toy works outside its imaginary setting or 
whether toy parts are sold separately.</p>
<p>To prevent disappointments, you may want to help children better understand what they see in television ads. As with all 
products, toys advertised on TV are made to appear as appealing as possible. You should point out that the purpose of 
advertising is to sell products; not all information about a toy may be contained in an ad.</p>
<h4>Evaluating Television Ads</h4>
<p>To help children evaluate toy advertisements, consider discussing the following points.</p>
<p>Toy ads may exaggerate a toy's performance.</p>
<p>A toy on TV may appear to make elaborate sounds or move by itself when, in fact, it cannot. You could discuss how special 
sound effects, production techniques, camera work, or editing can be used to enhance a toy's operation. Many ads show toys 
being used in make-believe settings in ways that are unrepresentative of how they work in real life. You may want to help 
children focus on the part of an ad showing a toy's real-life operation.</p>
<p>Toys may require special skills or extensive practice.</p>
<p>In some ads, toys may look easy to play with or operate. In fact, they may require hours of practice before they can be used as 
shown. In addition, you may want to remind children that, because of differing levels of skills and talents, not all toys are 
appropriate for all children.</p>
<p>Toys may not be sold with all the pieces displayed in the ad.</p>
<p>You may want to help a child determine what pieces actually come with a toy. Some toys may be shown with parts from more 
than one package while others may be depicted in elaborate play settings not readily duplicated at home. Children may want to 
watch and listen for such key phrases as &quot;pieces sold separately&quot; or &quot;no batteries included.&quot;</p>
<p>Toys may have to be assembled.</p>
<p>Toys in ads may look ready to play with when, in fact, they require assembly. In some cases, the assembly may be difficult or 
time-consuming. Children may want to note whether an ad states &quot;some assembly required.&quot;</p>
<h4>Evaluating Toys</h4>
<p>To enhance toy purchasing and gift-giving occasions for everyone, you may want to consider the following.</p>
<p>Talk with children about advertising. Encourage them to discuss with you the ads they see on TV. After you buy a toy, discuss 
whether it performs the way they thought it would. Ask what additional information they need about a toy before purchasing it or 
whether another toy would be a better buy.</p>
<p>As with any product, find out information about a toy before purchasing it. Carefully examine the toy and its packaging in the 
store or ask friends for their experiences. Try to determine how the toy actually performs, what pieces come with it, and how 
much assembly is required.</p>
<p>Check the recommended age level on the toy packaging. This is the manufacturer's guide to the appropriateness of the toy and 
skill level required.</p>
<h4>For More Information</h4>
<p>The Federal Trade Commission Act requires all toy advertising to be truthful and non-misleading. If you have questions or 
concerns about toy advertisements, write to: Correspondence Branch, Federal Trade Commission, Washington, DC 20580. 
These comments help the FTC in its law enforcement efforts. For additional information about children and advertising, you may 
want to write to: Children's Advertising Review Unit (CARU), Council of Better Business Bureaus, Inc., 845 Third Avenue, 
New York, N.Y. 10022. CARU was established by the advertising industry to review and evaluate children's advertising.</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h3>Video Games -- December 1993</h3>
<p>Video games are a popular pastime for children of all ages. Some video games, because of their violent content or mature 
themes, may be inappropriate for children, especially younger ones. If you are shopping for video games for children, be aware 
that some games appropriate for older children or adults may be advertised and marketed together with games for younger ones.</p>
<p>If you are buying a video game for a child, you may want to: look for ratings that now appear on some video games; ask a 
salesperson about the content suitability of various games; or check consumer publications, which may evaluate video games.</p>
<p>In addition, be aware that:</p>
<p>At least one video game manufacturer rates many of its games to indicate whether they are appropriate for general audiences 
(GA), persons over 13 (MA-13), or adults only (MA-17). These ratings are found on the front of some video games. In some 
advertisements for the games, however, the ratings may not be present or may be obscured.</p>
<p>Some manufacturers restrict the content of their games. There may be differences in some of the action sequences, even among 
video games with the same name, depending on the manufacturer.</p>
<p>The industry is now moving to establish an industry-wide rating system.</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Water Testing Scams -- December 1993</h2>
<p>Worried about the safety of your drinking water? You are not alone. Fears about the purity of our water have increased 
dramatically in recent years, along with news reports of leaking landfills, corroding lead pipes, and crumbling gasoline storage 
tanks tainting water supplies. These reports paint a gloomy picture of toxic wastes, pesticides, and other chemicals seeping into 
both well and ground water.</p>
<p>Although most households using water from public sources should have few concerns, potentially harmful contaminants have 
been found in some water supplies. If you have serious questions about the safety of your drinking water, you can take the 
suggestions described in this fact sheet to have your water tested and, if necessary, buy a water treatment unit. This fact sheet 
also warns you about some home water testing scams, where unscrupulous salespeople use scare tactics and fraudulent methods 
to sell their water treatment devices.</p>
<h4>Some Fraudulent Promotions</h4>
<p>Not all companies offering water tests are legitimate. For example, fraudulent sellers that advertise &quot;free home water testing&quot; may 
only be interested in selling you a water treatment device, whether you need it or not. Because there is no charge for the &quot;testing,&quot; 
you may be willing to allow a company representative into your home to check your water for impurities.</p>
<p>In doing the test, the representative may add tablets or drops of chemicals to your tap water, telling you the water will change 
color or particles will form if it is contaminated. When your water changes before your eyes, the representative may warn you 
that the water is polluted and may cause cancer. The best solution, you are told, is to buy the company's water treatment device. 
You should understand, however, that even spring mineral water would &quot;fail&quot; the company's test.</p>
<p>Others will try to sell you a water treatment device without testing your drinking water or without even suggesting it be tested. 
They may offer water purifiers as part of a prize promotion--notifying you, either by mail or telephone, that you have been 
selected to win an expensive prize.</p>
<p>To qualify for the prize, you are required to buy a water treatment device, costing hundreds of dollars. Unfortunately, you may 
discover later that both the prize and the water purifier are of very little value. And you probably cannot cancel your order or 
return the prize and water purifier for a refund.</p>
<p>If you are invited to participate in such a prize promotion, do not be pressured into making a decision on the spot. Ask for a 
copy of the offer in writing and read it carefully. Sometimes sellers will tell you that they need your credit-card number for 
identification or verification, while in reality they want your number to make unauthorized charges to your account. Remember, 
never give your credit-card number over the telephone to someone you do not know.</p>
<h4>Some FTC Cautions</h4>
<p>The Federal Trade Commission suggests that you take the following steps before you have your water tested or you purchase 
any type of water treatment system.</p>
<h4>Avoid &quot;Free&quot; Home Water Tests</h4>
<p>Offers to test the tap water in your home for free are almost always part of a sales promotion. More important, in-home testing 
does not provide the specific, in-depth analysis that is required to determine if your water needs treatment and what kind of 
system is suited to your needs. For example, in-home water tests may only check for acidity/alkalinity, water hardness, iron, 
manganese, and color, but none of these is harmful. Avoid dealing with salespersons who tell you strictly on the basis of their 
in-home testing that your drinking water is polluted, contaminated, or bad for your family's health.</p>
<h4>Be Wary of Claims of Government Approval</h4>
<p>Fraudulent sellers use many different sales techniques. Some fraudulent sellers claim that certain government agencies require or 
recommend widespread use of purification systems. Others claim that the government has approved a particular method for 
in-home water testing. Still others claim that the government has approved or licensed a particular water treatment unit or 
purification system. All of those claims are false.</p>
<p>The government does not endorse water tests or water treatment products. If you see an Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA) registration number on a water treatment product label, it merely means that the manufacturer has registered its product 
with the EPA. A registration number does not mean the EPA has tested or approved the product.</p>
<h4>Determine the Quality of Your Water Independently</h4>
<p>To learn about the quality of your water, ask your local water superintendent for the latest test results of the public water supply 
and then compare them to state and federal standards available from your state government and the EPA. If you use well water, 
ask your local or state health department if it offers free water testing. Most will for bacterial contaminants.</p>
<h4>Arrange for An Independent Test</h4>
<p>If you are concerned about the results you got from your local water superintendent or are worried about possible contaminants 
in your water supply, have your water tested by a private laboratory that is certified by your state health department or 
environmental agency. To find out where you can get a list of state-certified laboratories, call the EPA's Safe Water Drinking 
Hotline at 1-800-426-4791.</p>
<p>When having your water tested, deal with the laboratory directly. Some fraudulent sellers ask for a sample of your water to send 
to an independent laboratory for testing, and then alter or misrepresent the laboratory's test results.</p>
<p>You should understand that the costs of different water tests vary widely. Tests for bacteria range from $15 to $45, while tests 
for chemical contamination can cost hundreds, even thousands of dollars, depending on the depth of the analysis.</p>
<h4>Decide What You Need</h4>
<p>If tests on your water indicate problems, the next step is to determine what type of system you need to treat the water. This can 
be a difficult decision because there is a wide variety of water treatment devices on the market today. Water purifiers range from 
relatively low-cost, simple filter devices for a kitchen faucet to more expensive, sophisticated systems that treat water from its 
point of entry into a home.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, no one water treatment device can solve every problem. Some systems only soften water by removing calcium 
and magnesium, while others eliminate virtually all minerals and other foreign matter present in the water. Ask the testing firm or 
local government officials what kind of water treatment or purification system will suit your needs.</p>
<h4>Comparison Shop</h4>
<p>Remember, first you need to identify the water problem, and then you need to shop for the right device or filter to correct the 
problem. Once you decide to purchase a particular type of water treatment system, you will have to make choices in terms of 
price, installation, maintenance, and warranties. To become familiar with the most commonly available treatment methods and 
devices, ask for a free copy of the FTC's brochure &quot;Home Water Treatment Units,&quot; developed in cooperation with the EPA. 
Contact: Public Reference, Federal Trade Commission, Washington, DC 20580; 202-326-2222. You also may request Best 
Sellers, which lists all of the FTC's consumer publications.</p>
<h4>If You Have a Complaint</h4>
<p>To report problems about fraudulent sales practices, call:</p>
<p>National Fraud Information Center Consumer Assistance Hotline 1-800-876-7060 9 a.m. - 5:30 p.m. EST, Monday -- Friday</p>
<p>You also may file a complaint with the FTC. Write: Correspondence Branch Federal Trade Commission Washington, DC 
20580</p>
<p>Although the FTC cannot intervene in individual disputes, it needs to learn about home water treatment sales practices you 
believe to be deceptive.</p>

<h3>Facts for Business from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Yellow Pages Invoice Scams -- August 1992</h2>
<p>Produced in cooperation with the Yellow Pages Publishers Association and the United States Postal Inspection Service</p>
<p>Businesses across the country are receiving what appear to be invoices for ad space in the familiar, locally distributed, Yellow 
Pages directories. But, in fact, some of these &quot;invoices&quot; are solicitations for listings in alternative business directories that differ 
from the well-known Yellow Pages. These alternative directories often are not widely distributed, or may not be published at all. 
Businesses are being deceived into paying for what they erroneously believe to be their usual Yellow Pages ad.</p>
<h4>What Causes the Confusion?</h4>
<p>The familiar &quot;walking fingers&quot; logo and the name &quot;Yellow Pages&quot; are not protected by any federal trademark registration or 
copyright. Therefore, you may be led to believe that anyone who uses the logo and the name is affiliated with the publisher that 
distributes the telephone books and Yellow Pages directories to all households and businesses in a particular geographic area. 
There is no connection between publishers of alternative directories and those of the well-known Yellow Pages.</p>
<p>Alternative directories differ significantly from the traditional Yellow Pages directories primarily because of distribution. 
Alternative business directories generally are not available or distributed to the public. Therefore, they provide little, if any, benefit 
to businesses who pay to advertise in them.</p>
<h4>Characteristics of a Phony Yellow Pages Invoice</h4>
<p>The solicitation from an alternative business directory may have the appearance of an invoice. It may bear the &quot;walking fingers&quot; 
logo and feature the name &quot;Yellow Pages.&quot; It also may falsely suggest that the publisher is affiliated with your local telephone 
company or with another bona fide Yellow Pages publisher you recognize. Further, the solicitation may lead you to believe that 
your business already has been listed in the telephone directory and you are now being billed when, in fact, you are only being 
solicited for placing an ad.</p>
<p>Typical language used on the ad solicitations, such as &quot;present listing information,&quot; &quot;prompt payment is necessary to guarantee ad 
placement in the directory,&quot; &quot;renewal payment stub,&quot; and &quot;directory listing renewal invoice&quot; also may appear on Yellow Pages 
invoices. This adds to the confusion.</p>
<h4>How To Protect Yourself</h4>
<p>Examine the piece of mail you have received and determine whether it is a solicitation or an invoice. If it is a solicitation, you 
should see a disclaimer required by the U.S. Postal Service. It states, THIS IS NOT A BILL. THIS IS A SOLICITATION. 
YOU ARE UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO PAY THE AMOUNT STATED ABOVE UNLESS YOU ACCEPT THIS 
OFFER. But whether you see this solicitation disclaimer or not, be wary.</p>
<p>Consider taking the following additional precautions:</p>
<p>* Investigate the company and its product before responding.</p>
<p>* Ask for a copy of a previous directory edition.</p>
<p>* Ask the publisher for written information about its directories. Ask for distribution figures, the method of distribution, and the 
directory's life span.</p>
<p>* Ask where the directories are distributed and whether they go to all local telephone customers.</p>
<p>* Ask if directories are available free. If there is a fee, ask for the cost.</p>
<p>* Call your local Yellow Pages publisher to learn if it is associated with the company soliciting your business. If more than one 
Yellow Pages publisher distributes directories in your area, call the publishers whose books you are considering for your ad; ask 
if they are associated with the company that sent you the solicitation.</p>
<p>* Check with consumer protection officials in your state and in the state where the company is located to learn if they have 
received any complaints about the publisher. Keep in mind, however, that suspect companies often leave before complaints are 
registered or before local authorities have a chance to act. Just because your local consumer protection agency has no 
complaints on file against a company, that does not mean the business is legitimate.</p>
<h4>What To Do if You Are a Victim</h4>
<p>If you believe you have been the victim of this misrepresentation scheme, contact your Postmaster or local Postal Inspector. 
Look in your telephone directory under &quot;U.S. Government, Postal Service U.S.&quot; for local listings. If there is no listing, write: 
Chief Postal Inspector, United States Postal Service, Washington, D.C. 20260-2100, or call (202) 268-4267.</p>
<p>You also may direct questions about Yellow Pages directory publishers to the Yellow Pages Publishers Association (YPPA), a 
private trade association representing over 140 Yellow Pages publishers throughout the United States. Write: Yellow Pages 
Publishers Association, 340 E. Big Beaver Road, 5th Floor, Troy, MI 48083, or call (313) 680-8880.</p>
<h4>For More Information</h4>
<p>To learn how to protect yourself from other fraudulent sales practices that may affect your business, send for the free brochure, 
Buying by Phone. Write: Public Reference, Federal Trade Commission, Washington, D.C. 20580. You also may write to this 
address for a free copy of Best Sellers, which lists all the FTC's consumer and business publications.</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Dance Studios -- November 1992</h2>
<p>Although dance lessons may offer opportunities for fun, entertainment, and companionship, they also may be more expensive 
than planned, especially if you do not know how to protect yourself against some dance studio sales practices. For example, 
beware of:</p>
<p>Signing long-term contracts and prepaying thousands of dollars for dance lessons or clubs that you may be unable to complete or 
cancel;</p>
<p>Signing additional contracts before the current one expires;</p>
<p>Making large prepayments to studios that may be unable to give refunds should they suddenly close or go bankrupt.</p>
<p>In an effort to make consumers aware of certain sales practices used by some dance studios, the Federal Trade Commission 
(FTC) has prepared this brochure. It also suggests ways in which you can protect yourself.</p>
<h4>Sales Techniques</h4>
<p>If you are thinking about or are already taking dance lessons, you should understand the sales techniques that some dance 
studios may use to persuade you to take lessons, or to take additional lessons.</p>
<p>Relay Salesmanship. Some studio instructors use the technique of relay salesmanship -- consecutive sales talks by more than one 
representative in a single day -- to try to persuade students to buy lessons or buy more lessons. This tactic may put you under 
heavy pressure to sign a contract, encouraging you to buy lessons you may later realize you do not want or cannot afford.</p>
<p>Overlapping Contracts. Some studio instructors try to convince their students during lesson time to sign additional contracts 
before completing the current lessons. In some instances, you may unwittingly be buying additional lessons that extend beyond 
your interest, your physical fitness, or even your life expectancy.</p>
<p>High-pressure Sales. Some studio instructors, using high-pressure sales tactics, exploit student emotions or personal 
vulnerabilities to oversell lessons. Sometimes, when students refuse to buy additional prepaid lessons, instructors will neglect 
them in classes, embarrass them in public, or transfer them to a less skilled instructor.</p>
<h4>Precautions</h4>
<p>Awareness about the possible use of these sales techniques can help you avoid potential problems. In addition, you may avoid 
some potential problems if you comparison shop for dance lessons.</p>
<p>Finally, before signing or renewing a contract for dance lessons, consider taking the following measures.</p>
<p>Pay in advance for only a certain number of lessons to see if you like them. You may get a discount if you make a large 
prepayment on a long-term contract, but it will have little value if later you are unable to take the classes, you want to cancel 
them, or the studio closes before your lessons are completed. At this time, only a few states require studios to post bonds to 
protect consumers' prepayments.</p>
<p>Insist that the following items are clearly stated in writing:</p>
<ul>
<li>any oral promises;<p>the cost per hour of private and group lessons;</p>
<p>your cancellation and refund rights; (These are important in case you change your mind about lessons, move, or become 
ill.)</p>
<p>any prepayment protections, if required by state law.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can ask about these important items when you comparison shop.</p>
<p>Do not sign a contract immediately, especially if you have concerns about the stability of the studio or are asked to prepay a 
large amount of money for a lifetime membership, an exclusive club membership, or dance cruise offer. Take time to think about 
the matter and talk it over with a friend, a family member, or an attorney. Even if your contract offers you a refund or cancellation 
option, you may be unable to get your money back if the studio closes or its refund check bounces. Prepay only as much as you 
can afford to lose if the studio closes.</p>
<p>As an additional precaution, you might wish to contact your local or state consumer protection office to learn what rights you 
may have under local or state law with regard to maximum costs for contracts, cancellation and refund rights, studio bonding 
requirements, and a &quot;cooling off&quot; period, which may give you a few days to reconsider your decision after you sign your contract. 
Also, by contacting your local Better Business Bureau office, you may be able to learn if there are any current complaints 
registered against the dance studio you are considering.</p>
<h4>Complaints</h4>
<p>If you have a problem with a dance studio and cannot resolve it, send a letter describing your complaint to your local or state 
consumer protection agency and your local Better Business Bureau. (Check your phone directory for addresses.) Also, send a 
copy of your letter to: Correspondence Branch, Federal Trade Commission, Washington, D.C. 20580. Although the FTC 
generally cannot intervene in individual disputes, the information you provide may indicate a pattern of possible law violations 
requiring action by the Commission.</p>

<h3>Facts for Business from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Buying by Phone -- April 1994</h2>
<p>If you work at a small business or charity, you probably order some of your supplies by phone. Such business-to-business 
transactions are covered by the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) Mail or Telephone Order Rule.</p>
<h4>Mail or Telephone Order Rule</h4>
<p>Under the Rule, companies are required to have a reasonable basis for being able to ship your order within the time promised in 
their advertisements or their solicitation for your order. If no time period is promised, the company must ship your order within 
30 days after they receive it. The only exception to this 30-day requirement is if you are applying for credit to pay for your 
purchase. In that case, the company is allowed 50 days to ship. Whenever the company later learns it cannot ship in the time 
originally promised or 30 days, it must notify you of the shipping delay and give you the alternative of agreeing to the delay or 
canceling your order and receiving a prompt refund.</p>
<h4>WATS-Line Hustlers</h4>
<p>You probably find most telephone salespeople are honest and from reputable companies. Unfortunately, this is not always the 
case. The FTC has received complaints indicating that businesses and charities have problems with some telephone solicitors 
who use illegal tactics to make sales or who send unordered merchandise.</p>
<p>These solicitors often are called &quot;WATS-line hustlers&quot; because they operate using long-distance phone lines, such as Wide Area 
Telecommunication Service (&quot;WATS- lines&quot;), to sell to businesses and charities.</p>
<p>Even though most companies using long-distance phone lines do not engage in illegal practices, telephone sales schemes are 
increasing. This brochure describes how you can protect your business or organization from these illegal practices and what to 
do if you have a problem with a WATS-line hustler.</p>
<h4>Typical WATS-Line Hustler Tactics</h4>
<p>WATS-line hustlers target all kinds of businesses and charities, from restaurants, professional offices, and religious groups to 
schools and hospitals. They sell products that must be replaced continually, such as office supplies (pens, typewriter ribbons, 
copy machine ink, toner, etc.) and maintenance supplies (light bulbs, cleaning compounds, etc.).</p>
<p>While WATS-line hustlers use many different ploys, these are the common tactics:</p>
<p>They rarely deal with the authorized purchasing agent. WATS-line hustlers usually try to talk with an employee unfamiliar with 
purchasing procedures -- for example, an inexperienced clerk, secretary, or maintenance person.</p>
<p>They may mislead you to get orders. WATS-line hustlers usually mislead you into thinking that they are your regular supplier. For 
example, they may call pretending to conduct a &quot;survey&quot; of office equipment or to &quot;update their records.&quot; Once you give them the 
information they want (perhaps the model numbers of your copying machines), they may pose as &quot;your new supplier&quot; or 
&quot;authorized&quot; dealer for whatever products you use.</p>
<p>They may pressure you into placing an immediate order. WATS-line hustlers may offer you &quot;bargain prices&quot; if you order right 
away -- but their prices may be no bargain. They often make up stories to explain why certain goods are available for a limited 
time at so-called low prices. For example, they may falsely claim that prices are going up tomorrow, that someone was forced 
out of business, that a warehouse is overstocked, or that a limited supply of government surplus is available. They may claim that, 
because of some computer foul-up, you were not notified of a recent price increase, so they have reserved an order for you at 
your regular or &quot;old&quot; price. These stories are designed to force you into making a quick purchase.</p>
<p>They may offer free gifts. WATS-line hustlers may offer to send a free gift to your home to induce you to place an order. Often 
the gift never arrives or is worth less than promised.</p>
<p>They may misrepresent merchandise. WATS-line hustlers may misrepresent the quality, type, package size, price, and brand 
name of their products. For example, contrary to what you believe, ribbons &quot;for your I.B.M. typewriter&quot; might not be I.B.M. 
brand ribbons, or toner &quot;for your Xerox copier&quot; might not be Xerox brand toner. Some hustlers even package their products to 
look like brand name products. Others will sell you a carton of toner at the price you normally pay, but their carton may contain 
only half as much toner as you normally get for that price.</p>
<p>They may call you over and over again. If you pay once for the goods they ship you, some hustlers will call again soon after, 
telling you that &quot;the balance of your order&quot; is ready for shipment. They will keep doing this as long as you continue to pay.</p>
<p>They may refuse to accept returned merchandise. If you complain about receiving misrepresented or unordered goods, 
WATS-line hustlers may try to get you to keep the shipment at a so-called discount price. They are usually reluctant to accept 
returned merchandise or pay for return shipments. To discourage you from returning merchandise, they may charge an exorbitant 
&quot;restocking fee.&quot; To induce you to make a purchase, some may continue to send you partial shipments, which only increase the 
&quot;bill.&quot;</p>
<h4>Unordered Merchandise Problems</h4>
<p>If you ever have unordered merchandise problems with WATS-line hustlers, you can deal with them more effectively if you 
understand your legal rights.</p>
<p>If you receive unordered merchandise, federal law, as interpreted by the FTC, says you may keep it as a free gift. The same law 
makes it illegal to send you bills or dunning notices for unordered merchandise, or to ask you to return unordered merchandise 
even if the seller offers to pay for your out-of-pocket shipping expenses. If, without your express agreement, the seller substitutes 
merchandise differing from the merchandise you ordered with respect to the brand name, type, quantity, size or quality, the 
substitute merchandise can be treated as unordered merchandise.</p>
<p>You also may refuse a shipment arriving by U.S. mail if you do not open it. Some private carriers provide return service as well.</p>
<p>To avoid misunderstandings with the company sending you such merchandise, contact them, preferably by certified letter with a 
return receipt requested.</p>
<p>If you are not certain whether you ordered goods, send the company a letter (preferably certified with a return receipt requested) 
and ask for proof of your order. If you are sure the merchandise was never ordered, write the company stating that you have a 
legal right to keep it as a free gift. Say you are sending a copy of your letter to the FTC -- and do so. Keep a copy for your 
records.</p>
<p>If you believe the sender made an honest mistake, you can offer to return the goods at the sender's expense. Of course, if a bona 
fide order was placed and you receive exactly what you ordered, you are responsible for paying the bill.</p>
<p>The point is: if you are billed for something you did not order or receive, always demand proof of your order and of delivery. Do 
not pay for any merchandise until you have proof of both. If you pay for something you did not order or receive, it may be hard 
to get your money back.</p>
<h4>Precautions Against WATS-Line Hustlers </h4>
<p>In addition to knowing your legal rights, you can protect yourself against WATS-line hustlers by making sure that you:</p>
<p>Ask the name of the company the caller represents. Never order goods by phone if you have doubts about the salesperson or 
company. If you are unfamiliar with the firm calling, ask for local references so you can check them out before you buy.</p>
<p>Use only authorized purchasing agents for ordering, receiving, and paying for supplies. Use written purchase orders whenever 
possible.</p>
<p>If you do order over the phone, make sure you understand the quantity you are ordering, and whether you will be getting a brand 
name or a generic product. Also, ask if there will be any added charges (e.g., shipping, handling, etc.) and exactly how much 
they will be.</p>
<p>Inform all employees about your organization's purchasing, receiving, and paying systems. </p>
<p>Never accept or pay for shipments without being sure they were authorized. Examine both the invoice and the merchandise 
carefully before you pay.</p>
<h4>Where to Complain</h4>
<p>If you have any problems with a purchase made by phone or with WATS-line hustlers, first try to resolve your dispute with the 
company. If the problem is not readily corrected, contact your local Better Business Bureau or state consumer protection office 
for assistance. </p>
<p>You also can contact the Federal Trade Commission. Although it cannot resolve individual disputes, the Commission wants to 
know if you have had trouble with WATS-line hustlers. The Commission can take action if there is evidence of a pattern of 
deceptive or unfair practices. Send your complaint to: Correspondence Branch, Federal Trade Commission, Washington, D.C. 
20580.</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Cellular Telephone Lottery Update -- January 1993</h2>
<p>Prepared in cooperation with the Federal Communications Commission</p>
<p>An estimated 9 million subscribers now use cellular telephones to place calls on 1,500 systems around the nation. The Federal 
Communications Commission (FCC) issues licenses, by lottery, to build and operate cellular telephone systems. If you are 
considering investing in a cellular telephone license for an unserved area when new applications are accepted in 1993, you may 
first want to read this alert. Applying for a cellular telephone license is a high-risk investment. Even if you win a license, you could 
lose all of the money you invest.</p>
<p>This brochure explains how the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) licensing process works, what risks are involved, 
and how to avoid being misled by some application preparation services.</p>
<h4>Cellular Telephone System Licenses</h4>
<p>The FCC has designated 734 cellular telephone markets within the United States. Two cellular systems are licensed to operate 
within each market. Licensees have a five-year period during which they may expand their system within the market, free of 
competition. After five years, licensees forfeit their rights to the unserved areas, also known as &quot;fill-in&quot; markets.</p>
<p>Unserved areas are not found in all parts of the country; in fact, most are located in low population regions. Therefore, it is 
important to get information about the specific location of the unserved area before you invest. You may want to conduct a 
market study of the area's population density and traffic volume to determine whether the area can support a cellular telephone 
system.</p>
<h4>The Application and Licensing Process</h4>
<p>A cellular license application is a lengthy and complex document. Your application must include detailed engineering information 
and a written assurance that you will fulfill the FCC's financial requirements for issuing a license. Typically, this requires a financial 
commitment from a lending institution. The lender also must certify to a review of your financial condition and to the economic 
viability of the proposed system.</p>
<p>You must apply during the FCC's one-day filing window and pay a $230 application fee for each unserved area. The FCC 
issues public notices announcing application dates.</p>
<p>During the first stage of the FCC's cellular lottery process, applicants could form partial &quot;settlement groups&quot; or &quot;alliances&quot; to file 
for a fraction of a license. However, current FCC rules require that all applicants for an unserved area must agree to share a 
license. If even one applicant for an unserved area refuses to share a license, a lottery for that area must be held. Also, FCC 
rules prohibit anyone, with the exception of publicly traded corporations, from having an interest in more than one application in 
an unserved area.</p>
<p>After an application is selected, challenges to the winner's qualifications may be filed with the FCC. If a challenge is filed, the 
FCC reviews the legal and engineering aspects of the application and investigates any issues raised before accepting or rejecting 
the application. If a question of fact exists, a hearing is scheduled. If the application is found defective and dismissed, another 
lottery will be held to select an application from those already on file.</p>
<p>A successful licensee must construct a system and provide service within one year of receiving a license. A license may not be 
sold or transferred during the system's first year of operation. The FCC is adopting strict standards to deter speculators and 
encourage licensees that will build and operate cellular systems.</p>
<h4>Application Preparation Companies</h4>
<p>For a fee, some companies will prepare and file an application with the FCC for you to obtain a license. Companies that sell 
application services use the telephone, mail, and TV and radio advertisements to reach potential investors. Typically, they charge 
thousands of dollars for their services.</p>
<p>During an earlier phase of the FCC's cellular licensing process, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) investigated the 
promotional claims made by some application filing services. Subsequently, the FTC brought two lawsuits alleging that certain 
companies did not disclose to investors that the cellular lottery is a high-risk investment. Also, a number of state securities 
agencies moved against major cellular application preparation services accused of making misleading claims in order to attract 
investors.</p>
<h4>Tips for Applicants</h4>
<p>Before purchasing application services, consider taking the following steps to help protect yourself:</p>
<p>Find out the specific location of the proposed cellular system. Beware of an application service company that refuses to provide 
this information.</p>
<p>Verify that the proposed system contains enough users to support a cellular telephone system. Many proposed systems in 
unserved areas rely primarily on projected income from &quot;roaming traffic&quot; -- cellular telephone use in vehicles. You may want to 
consider a traffic count before you invest if you are considering an unserved area where the income is likely to come from 
roaming traffic.</p>
<p>Conduct a financial analysis of the project. Include projections for start-up costs, operating capital, cash flow, and income.</p>
<p>If the application preparation service you are using claims it can provide financing for you, make sure it complies with FCC rules 
concerning financial requirements.</p>
<p>Do not rely solely on the financial representations of an application service company salesperson. Investigate the salesperson's 
claims. Ask questions. If the answers don't check out, you may want to consider other investment opportunities.</p>
<p>Be skeptical of an application service company that promotes membership in partnerships as a way to assure your success in 
obtaining a license or eliminating financial risk. Such memberships do not increase the chances of winning a license or of assuring 
financial success and may even be in violation of FCC rules.</p>
<p>Be cautious of an application service company that promises to build and manage a system for you. You should verify whether 
the company has the technical and business expertise to do so. Also, under FCC rules, a licensee must be actively involved in the 
management of the business or the license may be revoked.</p>
<p>Be cautious of an application service company that promotes settlement groups or alliances as a way to increase your chances of 
winning a fraction of a cellular license. Joining a settlement group or alliance will not necessarily better your possibility of winning 
and may actually increase your chances of losing.</p>
<p>Be suspicious of an application service company that claims a cellular license may be sold immediately after being granted. 
Current FCC rules prohibit the sale of a license during the system's first year of operation.</p>
<p>Consider getting advice concerning the viability of the investment from your attorney, accountant, or other business professional.</p>

service, write: Correspondence Branch, Federal Trade Commission, Washington, D.C. 20580.</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Magazine Telephone Scams -- November 1992</h2>
<p>If a telephone caller offers you a &quot;free,&quot; &quot;prepaid,&quot; or &quot;special deal&quot; on magazine subscriptions, listen carefully before you answer. 
A hurried &quot;yes&quot; to the caller may obligate you to years of monthly payments for magazines you may not really want or could 
purchase elsewhere for less. In some states, once you orally agree to receive these magazines, you may be legally obligated to 
pay for them. When buying magazines over the phone, you do not have the advantage or protection of first seeing the written 
terms of the sales agreement.</p>
<p>Of course, thousands of consumers buy magazine subscriptions from legitimate salespeople over the telephone every year. Yet, 
according to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), some consumers are tricked by unscrupulous salespeople into paying 
hundreds of dollars for multi-year subscriptions. Fraudulent sellers make presentations so slick that many consumers are unaware 
they have purchased magazines until they receive the written agreement. The information in this brochure may help you avoid 
becoming entangled in a magazine subscription contract you do not want and which is difficult to escape.</p>
<h4>How To Recognize Deceptive Sales Techniques</h4>
<p>Sales techniques for these magazine subscriptions vary. Sometimes, instead of an initial phone call, you may receive a postcard 
that mentions nothing about magazine subscriptions. The postcard may ask you to call a telephone number about a contest, prize, 
or sweepstakes entry. If you call, you may be told about contest prizes or drawing dates. However, you soon may find that the 
telephone conversation turns into a sales talk about buying magazine subscriptions.</p>
<p>Listed below are some other questionable sales tactics deceptive telephone salespeople use.</p>
<p>They may avoid identifying themselves as magazine subscription salespeople or may fail to give you their name or that of their 
company. They may imply that they represent major credit card companies or magazine publishers or that their purpose in calling 
is something other than selling magazine subscriptions.</p>
<p>They may encourage you to make purchases without giving you total costs. For example, they may offer you magazines for just a 
few dollars a week. This may sound like a bargain until you realize that you could be paying hundreds of dollars for subscriptions 
that regularly may sell for less.</p>
<p>They may say you will be purchasing multiple-year subscriptions for a package of magazines, when, in fact, many of these 
subscriptions may be sent to you for a much shorter time.</p>
<p>They may say they are &quot;approved&quot; or &quot;regulated&quot; by the federal, state, or local government; in fact, no governmental body 
actually approves magazine-selling operations.</p>
<h4>What To Do If You Get a Telephone Call From a Magazine Subscription Salesperson</h4>
<p>You should listen carefully to the initial telephone sales presentation. If you are not interested in the offer, you simply may want to 
reject the offer and hang up the phone. If you are interested but busy when the call comes, you might ask the caller to contact 
you when you can focus more carefully on the sales offer. Some sellers may ask to tape your telephone conversation with them, 
saying it is for your protection. In reality, they might use this recording to &quot;prove&quot; you agreed to buy the magazines, selected a 
method of payment, and understood all the terms of the agreement. Remember, your verbal agreement to buy may become an 
immediate legal contract in some states.</p>
<p>The best way to protect yourself from unscrupulous sales presentations is to be suspicious when anyone tries to sell you a 
&quot;bargain&quot; or give you something &quot;free&quot; over the phone. Ask questions so you will have adequate information about what is being 
sold and the total costs involved. If your questions are not being answered completely, dismiss the caller.</p>
<p>Listed below are some questions to ask and tips to follow when you receive a telephone sales presentation regarding magazines.</p>
<p>Ask callers for their name, and the name, address, and phone number of the company they represent. Ask whether they are 
salespersons and what magazines they are selling. You may want to contact the company for verification before you place an 
order.</p>
<p>Ask for the total yearly cost of each magazine and for the whole package. Decide if this represents a real bargain over the regular 
magazine subscription prices you can obtain elsewhere.</p>
<p>Ask to receive a written copy of the sales terms offered over the telephone before you agree to buy anything. Then, read the 
sales agreement carefully and make sure you understand what you will be receiving and what it will cost.</p>
<p>Do not give your credit card number over the phone unless you initiate the call or you are familiar with the company. If you give 
your credit card number over the phone to an unknown salesperson for &quot;verification&quot; or &quot;computer purposes,&quot; that person may 
use it improperly to charge your account for unwanted magazine subscriptions or other purchases.</p>
<p>If you initially ordered magazines in response to a telephone solicitation, you may be called again. Although you may think you 
are being called to find out if you are satisfied with your order, the caller may be trying to sell you additional subscriptions or to 
renew existing ones. Listen carefully to subscription offers and make sure you understand the terms.</p>
<p>Be cautious about giving your bank account number or sending your signature to telemarketers. Fraudulent sellers sometimes say 
they need such identification to send you a &quot;gift.&quot; However, they may use such a deceptive tactic only to get your bank account 
number and signature, and once they have both, they can debit your checking account.</p>
<h4>How To Cancel Magazine Subscriptions Ordered by Telephone</h4>
<p>Although there is no federal law governing cancellation of telephone agreements, certain local and state laws require sellers to 
provide a cancellation period for telephone sales. But once you agree to buy magazine subscriptions over the phone, you cannot 
simply call the company to cancel your order if you change your mind. Magazine subscription companies do not honor oral 
cancellations. Where cancellation notices are honored, they must be in writing and occur within a limited time period. If you want 
to cancel magazine subscriptions you have purchased over the telephone, you will need to take following steps.</p>
<p>Watch for the arrival of your sales agreement, which may come in a plain or &quot;junk mail&quot; type envelope. Look for the provision in 
the agreement that allows you to cancel your subscription; generally it is within three days of receipt. The cancellation notice may 
be difficult to find. Often it is attached to an inside page of multiple copies of the sales agreement.</p>
<p>Sign and return the cancellation notice to the proper address, which also may be difficult to find because several addresses may 
be listed. Send the cancellation by certified or registered mail to be able to provide proof of your mailing date. If you are unable 
to send the cancellation notice by certified mail, photocopy the signed and dated notice and keep it for your records.</p>
<p>When you send the cancellation form, immediately contact your bank or credit card company to stop any unauthorized 
payments.</p>
<p>If your contract is beyond the cancellation period and you have paid in full, the magazine company may not be required to refund 
your money if you want to cancel your subscription. If you fail to meet the contract terms regarding payment(s), you may receive 
dunning notices and calls from collection agencies, or you may be threatened with legal action and a bad credit rating.</p>
<h4>Where You Can Go For Help</h4>
<p>If you ordered magazine subscriptions by telephone and believe you have been victimized, notify your state Attorney General or 
local consumer protection office. You also may file a complaint with the FTC. Write: Correspondence Branch, Federal Trade 
Commission, Washington, D.C. 20580. Although the FTC does not intervene in individual disputes, the information you provide 
may indicate a pattern of possible law violations requiring action by the Commission. If you have been contacted about paying 
for magazine subscriptions you did not authorize, you may want to get the FTC brochures Fair Credit Billing and Fair Debt 
Collection to learn your legal rights. For a free copy of these publications, write: Public Reference, Federal Trade Commission, 
Washington, D.C. 20580.</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Scams by Phone -- April 1994</h2>
<p>Telemarketing can be a convenient way to learn about products and services and to make purchases without leaving the comfort 
of your home. But consumers should be aware: while many telemarketers represent honest, reputable companies, there are 
others who will attempt to take your money.</p>
<p>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) estimates that fraudulent telemarketers swindle American consumers out of more than 
one billion dollars each year. They promote everything from useless water purifiers to interests in nonexistent oil wells.</p>
<p>This brochure tells you how fraudulent telemarketing operations work and other ways you may be contacted by a scam artist. It 
describes some common frauds and offers precautions about how to avoid becoming a victim. More information about the 
scams described here is provided free in individual brochures listed at the end of this publication. Other government agencies and 
private organizations that offer consumer assistance also are listed at the end of this brochure.</p>
<h4>How Telemarketing Scams Work</h4>
<p>The heart of the telemarketing operation is usually centered in a &quot;boiler room,&quot; a rented office space filled with desks, telephones, 
and experienced salespeople. These people spend their days talking to hundreds of potential victims all across the country. Older 
consumers, who may be lonely and trusting and may have savings, may be particularly vulnerable to con artists. Fraudulent 
telemarketers and sellers may reach you in several ways, but the telephone always plays an important role.</p>
<p>Cold calls. You may get a telephone call from a stranger who got your number from the telephone directory or a mailing list. A 
telemarketer calling from a boiler room may know, through a mailing list, your age, income, hobbies, marital status, and other 
information -- all to help personalize the call. This is the classic telemarketing scam.</p>
<p>Direct mail. You may receive a letter or a postcard saying you have won a prize or contest, which often is a front for a scam. 
You are told to return the postcard with particular information. If you do, you will be called by a salesperson using persuasive 
sales pitches, scare tactics, and exaggerated claims to deceive you and take your money.</p>
<p>Broadcast and print advertisements. You may make the telephone call yourself in some cases, in response to a television, 
newspaper, magazine advertisement, or a direct mail solicitation. However, just because you make the call does not mean the 
business is legitimate or that you should be any less cautious about buying or investing over the phone.</p>
<p>A con artist may try to get your credit card or checking account numbers using any one of these methods. Remember, do not 
give your credit card number or your checking account number. over the phone unless you are familiar with the company and 
know it is reputable. A fraudulent telemarketer may put a charge against your credit card without your authorization. Or the 
telemarketer may do an automatic debit scam.</p>
<h4>Automatic Debit Scams</h4>
<p>These scams involve unauthorized debits (withdrawals) from your checking account. You may get a postcard or a telephone call 
saying you have won a free prize or can qualify for a major credit card. If you respond to the offer, the caller may ask you to 
read off all of the numbers at the bottom of your check. Sometimes you may not be told why this information is needed. Other 
times you may be told this account information will help ensure that you qualify for the offer. And, in some cases, the caller may 
explain this information will allow them to debit your account and ship the prize.</p>
<p>The fraudulent telemarketer places your checking account information on a &quot;demand draft,&quot; which is processed much like a 
check. However, unlike a check, the draft does not require your signature. Your bank then pays the telemarketer's bank. And, 
you may not learn of the transaction until you receive your bank statement.</p>
<h4>How to Protect Yourself</h4>
<p>Automatic debit scams involve a fraud that is hard to detect, but there are some precautions you can take. Do not give your 
checking account number over the phone in response to solicitations from people you do not know. If anyone asks for your 
checking account number, ask them why they need this information. And, ask to review the company's offer in writing before you 
agree to a purchase. For more information on this scam, write for the free FTC brochure, Automatic Debit Scams.</p>
<h4>'900' Numbers</h4>
<p>The use of &quot;900&quot; telephone numbers is a new twist in telemarketing. By dialing a &quot;900&quot; number you can: order products; get 
financial tips; talk to a willing stranger; and more.You usually pay a flat fee for the entire call or are charged for each minute you 
stay on the phone.</p>
<p>Using &quot;900&quot; numbers can be a good way to do business or get information if you know exactly what you are getting and how 
much you will be charged. Nonetheless, the FTC is receiving and investigating complaints that some consumers have been 
charged excessively for &quot;900&quot; number services or have not received the services advertised.</p>
<h4>How to Protect Yourself</h4>
<p>Be wary of &quot;900&quot; number advertisements, usually found in newspapers or on television, that fail to disclose clearly the cost of the 
call or make it difficult to determine the total cost. Also be cautious of appeals that entice you to call a &quot;900&quot; number for a &quot;free&quot; 
gift. Check your phone bill carefully for any &quot;900&quot; number charges.You can learn more about such telemarketing scams by 
writing the FTC for the free brochure, '900' Numbers: New Rule Helps Consumers.</p>
<h4>'Gold' and 'Platinum' Cards</h4>
<p>Marketers of &quot;gold&quot; or &quot;platinum&quot; cards may promise in their ads that by participating in their credit programs, which might have 
an initiation fee of $50, you will be able to get major credit cards and improve your credit rating. But generally, this is not the 
case. Many of these credit card marketers -- who often target people in lower-income areas through direct mail, television, or 
newspaper ads featuring &quot;900&quot; numbers -- do not report to credit bureaus. And rarely can they help you to secure lines of credit 
with other creditors. In fact, some of these cards only allow you to purchase merchandise from the marketer's own catalogue -- 
and only after you have paid an extra charge.</p>
<h4>How to Protect Yourself</h4>
<p>Be skeptical of plans promising to secure major credit cards or erase bad credit. Contact your local consumer protection agency 
or the local Better Business Bureau (BBB) to learn if any complaints have been lodged against a particular marketer of &quot;gold&quot; or 
&quot;platinum&quot; cards. And be aware that unless marketers subscribe to credit bureaus, they are unable to report any information 
about your credit experience. For more information about &quot;gold&quot; and &quot;platinum&quot; credit card scams, write for the free FTC 
brochure, 'Gold' and 'Platinum' Cards.</p>
<h4>Land Sales Scams</h4>
<p>Con artists may entice you to buy undeveloped or partially developed land through newspaper advertisements that promise 
attractive vacation or retirement locations. If you call the advertised number, high pressure sales agents also may &quot;guarantee&quot; that 
the land's value soon will increase. And to pressure you into making a quick buying decision, sellers may warn you about rising 
prices or competition from other buyers. However, once you sign a contract, you may discover that the seller's promises about 
the value of your land were greatly exaggerated.</p>
<h4>How to Protect Yourself</h4>
<p>Inspect any piece of property before buying. Contact local real estate agents, the county recorder of deeds, and the tax 
assessment office to learn more about local land values. Also, contact the local or state consumer protection office where the 
land is located to find out if any complaints have been filed against the real estate developer or sales agent. You can learn more 
about fraudulent land sales schemes and ways to avoid becoming a victim by writing for the free FTC brochure, Land Sales 
Scams.</p>
<h4>Telemarketing Travel Fraud</h4>
<p>These scams have many variations and often involve travel packages that sound legitimate. You may get a phone call or a 
postcard saying that you have been selected to receive a free trip. The card will tell you to call a toll-free or &quot;900&quot; number for 
details. On the phone, skilled salespeople will tell you, to be eligible for the free trip, you must join their travel club. Later, you 
may find another fee is required to make your reservation and you will have a telephone charge if you used the &quot;900&quot; line. In the 
end, you may never get your &quot;free&quot; trip because your reservations are never confirmed or you must comply with hard-to-meet or 
expensive conditions.</p>
<p>While it is sometimes difficult to tell a legitimate travel offer from a fraudulent one, there are some precautions you can take. 
Always be wary of &quot;great deals,&quot; and before you pay for the trip, ask detailed questions that should give you clear answers. Ask 
for the travel offer in writing, so you can check details. You can try to check the reliability of the travel company by calling your 
local consumer protection office or the local BBB, but remember, they cannot vouch for the company, but only can tell you if 
they have any complaints logged under the company name. Learn more by writing for the free FTC brochure, Telemarketing 
Travel Fraud.</p>
<h4>Telephone Investments</h4>
<p>Typical investments sold by fraudulent telemarketers include coins, gemstones, interests in oil wells and gold mining operations, 
oil and gas leases, and the sale of precious metals such as gold and silver. Con artists direct their sales pitches to the universal 
desire to make money with little risk. A caller usually will say that you have been specially selected to participate in an unusual 
investment opportunity. The caller often requires that money, sometimes thousands of dollars, be transferred immediately 
because the &quot;market is moving.&quot;</p>
<h4>How to Protect Yourself</h4>
<p>Be wary of telephone investment opportunities that are guaranteed to be risk-free and provide a high return. Before you give 
anyone your money, it is best to get written information about an investment, to invest in businesses you know something about, 
and to discuss the matter with a knowledgeable person. You can learn more about individual investment frauds and ways to 
protect yourself by sending for the free FTC brochures, Telephone Investment Fraud and Dirt-Pile Scams: Mining for Gold.</p>
<h4>Magazine Telephone Scams</h4>
<p>With this scam, an unscrupulous telemarketer may use a variety of methods to trick you into purchasing multiple-year magazine 
subscriptions you really may not want or could purchase elsewhere for less. Initially you may receive a postcard that asks you to 
call a telephone number about a contest, prize, or sweepstake entry. When you call, you may get some information about contest 
prizes, but you also may find the conversation turns into a sales pitch about buying magazine subscriptions.</p>
<p>Be aware that telemarketers may avoid identifying themselves as magazine subscription salespeople. They also may encourage 
you to make magazine purchases without giving you total costs. Further, they may say they are &quot;approved&quot; or &quot;regulated&quot; by the 
government when, in fact, no government agency approves magazine-selling operations.</p>
<h4>How to Protect Yourself</h4>
<p>The best precaution against unscrupulous sales presentations is to be suspicious when anyone tries to sell you a &quot;bargain&quot; or give 
you something &quot;free&quot; over the phone. Ask for what individual subscriptions cost, the total cost of your order, and the length of 
subscription times. Before you buy, check their subscription cost against another seller. To learn more about ways to protect 
yourself, write for the free FTC brochure, Magazine Telephone Scams.</p>
<h4>Water Testing Scams</h4>
<p>Some fraudulent telemarketers may get you to buy a water treatment unit by questioning the safety of your drinking water through 
advertising or direct mail. Others may offer you water purifiers as part of a prize promotion. They may notify you, either by mail 
or telephone, that you have been selected to win an expensive prize. However, in order to qualify for the prize, you need to buy 
a water treatment unit, which sometimes costs hundreds of dollars. Later, you may discover that both the prize and water purifier 
are of little value.</p>
<h4>How to Protect Yourself</h4>
<p>Learn about the quality of your water before purchasing any type of water treatment system. Check with your local water 
superintendent. Avoid &quot;free&quot; home water tests as they are almost always part of a sales promotion. Be wary of sales claims about 
government approval. The government does not endorse water tests or water treatment products. For more information about 
ways to protect yourself, write for the free FTC brochure, Water Testing Scams.</p>
<h4>Art Fraud</h4>
<p>This scam involves the sale of counterfeit art prints of famous artists. You may get something in the mail describing a contest or a 
drawing for a free original lithograph by a famous artist. To participate, you are asked to return an enclosed postcard with 
particular information. Later, when you are contacted for more information, the caller will talk to you about buying art as an 
investment. If you agree, you may pay anywhere from $500 to $3,500 to receive art work valued at no more than $50 or the 
equivalent of a poster.</p>
<h4>How to Protect Yourself</h4>
<p>Get professional advice before purchasing any work of art and do not buy any art work sight unseen. Be suspicious of 
&quot;guaranteed&quot; investment returns, authenticity claims, and high-pressure sales tactics. For more information about fraudulent art 
scams and ways to avoid becoming a victim, write for the free FTC brochure, Art Fraud.</p>
<h4>If You Have a Complaint</h4>
<p>Always try to resolve complaints with the company first. If that does not work and you believe you have been defrauded, contact 
your local consumer protection agency or the BBB to report the company. You can find telephone numbers in the Consumer's 
Resource Handbook. To receive a free copy, write to: Consumer Information Center, Pueblo, Colorado, 81009. You also can 
get telephone numbers for your state and local consumer protection offices or local BBB by looking in your telephone directory. 
You also may contact the National Fraud Information Center at 1-800-876-7060, 9 a.m. - 5:30 p.m. EST, Monday - Friday. 
The Center is a private, non-profit organization that operates a consumer hotline to provide services and assistance in filing 
complaints. It forwards appropriate complaints to the FTC. In addition, you can file a complaint with the FTC yourself by writing 
to: Correspondence Branch, Federal Trade Commission, Washington, D.C. 20580. Although the FTC does not generally 
intervene in individual disputes, the information you provide may indicate a pattern of possible law violations requiring action by 
the Commission.</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Telemarketing: Reloading &amp; Double-Scamming Frauds -- March 1994</h2>
<p>Prepared in cooperation with Call For Action, Inc., a Washington, D.C.-based international network of radio and television 
consumer hotlines</p>
<p>If you've taken the bait and lost money to a telemarketer, expect that the same or another telemarketer will try to hook you 
again. Consumers who have been victimized often are placed on what is known in the trade as &quot;sucker lists&quot; and then victimized 
again. &quot;Sucker lists&quot; contain the names, addresses, phone numbers, and sometimes other information of people who have 
responded to bogus telephone solicitations. These lists, which are created, bought, and sold by some telemarketers, are 
invaluable because unscrupulous promoters know that consumers who have been tricked once are vulnerable to additional 
scams. These telemarketers hope that consumers believe that &quot;this time&quot; they will win the &quot;grand prize.&quot; Most often, however, 
these consumers simply lose more money.</p>
<p>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is investigating complaints about some telemarketing firms that take your money, not just 
once, but repeatedly. Such activity is known as &quot;reloading&quot; or &quot;double-scamming.&quot;</p>
<p>This brochure explains how reloading scams work, what precautions you can take to avoid becoming a victim, and where to go 
if you have a complaint about a telemarketer.</p>
<h4>How the Scam Works</h4>
<p>&quot;Reloaders&quot; or &quot;double-scammers&quot; use a variety of approaches to retarget consumers. For example, if you have lost money to a 
telemarketer you may be contacted by an individual claiming to represent a government agency, private company, or consumer 
organization that works, for a fee, to recover lost money or a product or prize. The problem is that the second caller may be just 
as bogus as the first. And, if you've paid the recovery fee -- you guessed it -- you've been double-scammed. In some instances, 
the second caller works for the firm that took your money in the first place.</p>
<p>Understand that some local government agencies and consumer organizations do provide assistance to consumers who have lost 
money. But they will not guarantee to get back your money and they will not charge a fee.</p>
<p>In another approach, a telemarketer may use prize incentives to persuade you to purchase merchandise. If you buy, you may get 
a call back saying that you now qualify for a more valuable prize. They lead you to believe that making an additional purchase 
could increase your chances of winning. If you buy a second time, the telemarketer may contact you yet a third time, repeating 
the same sales pitch. The only change is that you are now a &quot;grand prize&quot; finalist and, by buying more merchandise you could win 
the &quot;grand prize.&quot;</p>
<p>Of course the telemarketer wants payment when you agree to the purchase usually by a credit card phone order or the delivery 
of a check by courier service. However, it may be several weeks or more before you get your products and prizes. When your 
merchandise or prizes do arrive, you may discover that you paid too much for inferior products and that you did not win the 
&quot;grand prize&quot; after all. By that time your credit card account has been charged and your checks cashed.</p>
<h4>How to Protect Yourself</h4>
<p>To avoid being victimized by a reloading operation, consider the following precautions.</p>
<p>Beware of individuals claiming to represent companies, consumer organizations, or government agencies that will recover your 
lost money for a fee. National, state, and local consumer enforcement agencies, such as your Attorney General and consumer 
protection offices and non-profit organizations, such as Call For Action, or the National Fraud Information Center, do not charge 
for their services.</p>
<p>Before you make a purchase by phone from a company you do not know, ask the company to send you written materials about 
its operation. You may be on a &quot;sucker list.&quot; Even if you don't get information, you can still check out the organization with your 
state or local consumer protection office before you send any money.</p>
<p>Be skeptical of promoters who repeatedly contact you, stating that if you purchase more of their merchandise, you have a better 
chance of winning valuable prizes.</p>
<p>Make sure you receive and inspect your original purchase or prize before making additional purchases.</p>
<h4>If You Have a Complaint</h4>
<p>Always try to resolve complaints with the company first, but be careful. Don't let the company representative persuade you to 
accept a substitute product or award if this truly isn't what you want. If you want your money back, say so and don't accept less.</p>
<p>If that does not work and you believe you have been defrauded, contact the National Fraud Information Center at 
1-800-876-7060, 9 a.m. - 5:30 p.m. EST, Monday - Friday; Call For Action (CFA) at (202) 537-0585; TDD (202) 
537-1551; your state Attorney General; local consumer protection office; and Better Business Bureau, to report the company.</p>
<p>The National Fraud Information Center is a private, non-profit organization that operates a consumer assistance hotline to 
provide services and assistance in filing complaints. Call For Action (CFA) is a Washington, D.C.-based international network of 
radio and television consumer hotlines. The CFA Network of 800 volunteers helps consumers retrieve money or services.</p>
<p>In addition, you may wish to file a complaint with the FTC by writing to: Correspondence Branch, Federal Trade Commission, 
Washington, D.C. 20580. Although the FTC generally does not intervene in individual disputes, the information you provide may 
help to indicate a pattern of possible law violations requiring action by the Commission.</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Telemarketing Fraud: How to Spot It, How to Avoid It -- April 1994</h2>
<p>Prepared as a public service by the Federal Trade Commission and the National Association of Attorneys General</p>
<p>Fraudulent telemarketers swindle American consumers out of more than a billion dollars each year. These professional con artists 
peddle everything from overpriced and useless water &quot;purifiers&quot; to &quot;gold mines&quot; that are nothing more than piles of dirt.</p>
<p>Of course, selling products or services by phone is not in itself a crime. Most telemarketers represent honest, reputable 
businesses. But because so many customers enjoy the ease and convenience of shopping by phone, it is an attractive tool for 
unscrupulous salesmen.</p>
<p>Anyone with a telephone is vulnerable to the high-pressure sales tactics and enticing offers of the dishonest telemarketer. 
Stockbrokers have been lured into phony investment schemes. Real estate professionals have bought into worthless land deals.</p>
<p>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC), state Attorneys General, and others are working hard to put fraudulent telemarketers out 
of business. Unfortunately, though, fraudulent telemarketers are hard to track down. Most are &quot;fly by night&quot; operators working 
out of so-called &quot;boilerrooms&quot; -- leased space with banks of telephones staffed by professional scam artists. Once under 
investigation, they can easily shut down and move -- virtually overnight -- to another town or state. They may even change their 
name -- anything to cover their tracks.</p>
<p>Because enforcement is so difficult, it is essential that today's consumer be an informed telephone shopper. The following tips 
suggest how you can detect telemarketing fraud and avoid becoming a victim.</p>
<h4>Investments</h4>
<p>&quot;Get rich quick&quot; schemes involving rare coins, gemstones, real estate, securities, oil and gas leases, and precious metals are 
commonly pushed on the unsuspecting consumer. Most are worthless. Frequent targets are those who have been victimized 
before, since they are often eager to recoup losses from previous deals.</p>
<h4>Water Purifiers</h4>
<p>Capitalizing on growing environmental awareness, some businesses are selling so-called water purification or filtration systems. 
Callers use scare tactics to convince you that your tap water is filled with impurities or cancer-causing substances. You may end 
up paying $300 to $500 for a device that is worth less than $50.</p>
<h4>Charities</h4>
<p>Some unscrupulous telemarketers will say they're calling on behalf of a charity. They may ask you to buy tickets for a benefit 
show, make a donation toward sending handicapped children to the circus, or purchase light bulbs or other household items at 
inflated prices, to cite a few examples. If you are not careful, your generosity may be exploited and little or none of your 
contribution will actually go to the charity.</p>
<h4>Travel </h4>
<p>So-called &quot;free&quot; or &quot;low-cost&quot; vacations often come with extra charges, hidden restrictions, and hard-to-meet conditions. You 
might be required to join a travel club. A vacation-for-two may only include airfare for one. You could be charged extra for 
&quot;peak season&quot; reservations. As a result, your vacation ends up costing two to three times what you would have paid had you 
made your own arrangements.</p>
<h4>Vitamins</h4>
<p>Some health conscious consumers fall prey to telemarketers selling vitamins. As with many other scams, the sales pitch may 
include a prize offer to get you to pay as much as $600 for a six-month supply of vitamins that are worth as little as $40.</p>
<h4>Tips on Spotting Fraud</h4>
<p>As the examples in this brochure illustrate, there are many kinds of telemarketing scams, and new ones are invented every day. 
But certain elements are common to most of these scams.</p>
<p>Beware of:</p>
<p>&quot;Free&quot; gifts that require you to pay &quot;shipping and handling&quot; charges, &quot;redemption&quot; fees, or &quot;gift taxes&quot; before delivery.</p>
<p>&quot;High-profit, no-risk&quot; investments. No high-profit investment is free of any risk.</p>
<p>High-pressure sales tactics and demands for you to &quot;act now.&quot;</p>
<p>A request for your credit card number for &quot;identification&quot; purposes or to &quot;verify&quot; that you have won a prize.</p>
<p>Refusal to provide written materials or even the most basic details about the organization, such as its exact location or names of 
its officers.</p>
<p>Organizations that are unfamiliar to you or that have only a P.O. Box for an address. (Some organizations use a P.O. Box so you 
will not know their location.)</p>
<h4>Don't Be a Victim!</h4>
<p>To avoid being swindled, follow these precautions.</p>
<p>Don't give out your credit card number over the phone unless you know the organization is reputable.</p>
<p>Insist on getting written information about the organization. At the same time, don't assume an organization is legitimate solely on 
the basis of impressive-looking brochures or enthusiastic testimonials.</p>
<p>Find out if any complaints have been registered against the company with your state Attorney General or local Better Business 
Bureau. But remember that scam artists frequently change names and locations. Just because there are no complaints on file does 
not mean a business is trustworthy.</p>
<p>In the case of charitable organizations, you have the right to know if the caller is a volunteer or a professional 
telemarketer/fundraiser. Don't commit yourself over the telephone. Ask for written information about how much of your donation 
will actually go to the charity and how much will be spent on administrative costs.</p>
<p>Take time to make a decision before investing. Consult someone whose financial advice you trust -- a banker, lawyer, 
accountant, or friend. Have them review any contract or prospectus before you commit yourself.</p>
<p>If a caller is uncooperative in answering your questions, simply hang up the phone. Remember, you have a right to know 
specifics. They have no right to your money.</p>
<p>Above all, follow the advice: &quot;If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is!&quot;</p>
<h4>If You are Victimized</h4>
<p>The nation's leading consumer protection enforcers, the FTC and the state Attorneys General, have declared telemarketing fraud 
as a high priority. Together they are working to end this problem that robs American consumers of more than a billion dollars 
each year.</p>
<p>If you get swindled by a telemarketer, don't be embarrassed to report it or assume it's not worth your time. By reporting the 
incident, you can help ensure that others aren't victimized.</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Telemarketing Travel Fraud -- February 1993</h2>
<p>Produced in cooperation with the American Society of Travel Agents</p>
<p>Have you ever been tempted to buy one of those bargain-priced travel packages sold over the telephone? Be careful. Your 
dream adventure may be a misadventure if you fall victim to one of the travel scams sold over the phone. While some of these 
travel opportunities are legitimate, many of them are scam operations that are defrauding consumers out of millions of dollars 
each month.</p>
<h4>How The Scams Work</h4>
<p>These schemes take many forms. Often, schemes involve vacation travel packages. A consumer pays hundreds of dollars or 
more to receive a travel package that includes round-trip air transportation for one person and lodging for two people in Hawaii, 
London, or another vacation place for a week. The catch?</p>
<p>You must purchase a high-priced, round-trip ticket for the second person from the fraudulent travel operation or you must pay 
for costly accommodations in less-than-ideal timeshares or resorts. You may end up paying more than what it would cost if you 
purchased your own tickets in advance or bought them through an airline or reputable travel agency.</p>
<p>Another scam starts by sending you a postcard stating: &quot;You have been specially selected to receive a free trip.&quot; The postcard 
instructs you to call a phone number, usually toll-free, for details about the trip. Once you call, you are given a sales pitch for a 
supposedly luxurious trip that is not free at all. Sometimes, a credit card number is requested so that your account can be billed 
for the package. Only after you pay are you sent the vacation package with instructions on requesting reservations for your trip. 
Usually, your reservation request must be accompanied by yet another fee. The catch here? New charges are being added at 
every step of the way. And, you never get your &quot;free&quot; trip because your reservations are not confirmed or you must comply with 
hard-to-meet hidden or expensive &quot;conditions.&quot; Telemarketing travel scams usually originate out of &quot;boiler rooms.&quot; Skilled 
salespeople, often with years of experience selling dubious products and services over the phone, pitch travel packages that may 
sound legitimate, but often are not.</p>
<p>These sales pitches usually include some of the following techniques:</p>
<p>Oral Misrepresentations. Whatever the particular scheme may be, telephone salespeople are likely to promise you a &quot;deal&quot; they 
cannot deliver. Unfortunately, you often do not realize this until after you have paid your money.</p>
<p>High Pressure/Time Pressure Tactics. These scam operators are likely to tell you they need your commitment to buy right away 
or that this special offer will not be available tomorrow. Often, they will brush aside your questions with vague answers.</p>
<p>&quot;Affordable&quot; Offers. Unlike telephone fraud operators who try to persuade people to spend thousands of dollars on a particular 
investment scheme, travel scam operators usually pitch their membership or vacation offers in the range of hundreds of dollars. 
Because this amount is often in the price range of those planning vacations, offers may appear to be reasonably-priced.</p>
<p>Contradictory Follow-up Material. Some firms may agree to send you written confirmation of the deal. You will find, however, 
that the literature bears little resemblance to the offer you accepted. Often, the written materials will disclose additional terms, 
conditions, and costs.</p>
<h4>How To Protect Yourself</h4>
<p>No one wants unpleasant surprises on a vacation. Therefore, it pays to thoroughly investigate a travel package before you 
commit to purchase. While it is sometimes difficult to tell a legitimate sale pitch from a fraudulent one, there are some things you 
can do to protect yourself.</p>
<p>Be wary of &quot;great deals.&quot; One tip-off to a scam is that the offer is very low-priced. Few legitimate businesses can afford to give 
away things of real value or to undercut substantially everyone else's price.</p>
<p>Do not be pressured into buying -- NOW. Generally, a good offer today will remain a good offer tomorrow. Legitimate 
businesses do not expect you to make an instant decision.</p>
<p>Ask detailed questions. Find out exactly what the price covers -- and does not cover. Ask if there will be any additional charges 
later. Find out the names of the specific hotels, airports, airlines, and restaurants that your package includes. You may wish to 
contact these places yourself to double-check arrangements. Find out exact dates and times. Ask about cancellation policies and 
refunds. If the salesperson cannot give you detailed answers to these questions, this is not the deal for you.</p>
<p>Get all information in writing before you agree to buy. Before purchasing a travel package, ask for detailed written information. 
Once you receive the information, make sure the written material confirms everything you were told by phone.</p>
<p>Do not give your credit card number over the phone. One easy way for a scam operator to close a deal is to get your credit card 
number and then charge your account. Sometimes scam operators say they need the number for verification purposes only. 
Never give your credit or charge card numbers -- or any other personal information (such as bank account numbers) -- to 
unsolicited telephone salespeople.</p>
<p>Do not send money by messenger or overnight mail. Instead of asking for your credit card number, some scam operators may 
ask you to send a check or money order right away -- or offer to send a messenger to pick these up. If you use money rather 
than a credit card in the transaction, you lose your right to dispute fraudulent charges under the Fair Credit Billing Act. (See 
following section, &quot;What To Do If You Have Problems.&quot;)</p>
<p>Check out the company. Before buying any travel package, check first with various government and private organizations to see 
if any complaints have been lodged against the travel firm calling you. A list of some of these organizations is included on page 5. 
Be aware that fraudulent firms change their names frequently to avoid detection.</p>
<p>If in doubt, say &quot;no.&quot; Sometimes an offer appears legitimate, but you still have doubts. In that case, it is usually better to turn 
down the offer and hang up the phone. Remember, if something goes wrong, the likelihood of your receiving any money back is 
very slim.</p>
<h4>What To Do If You Have Problems</h4>
<p>If you have problems with a travel package, try resolving your disputes first with the company that sold you the package. If you 
are not satisfied, try contacting your local consumer protection agency, Better Business Bureau, or state Attorney General. In 
addition, you may want to write to the American Society of Travel Agents, Consumer Affairs, at 1101 King Street, Alexandria, 
Virginia 22314, which may be able to mediate your dispute. You also may contact the National Fraud Information Center, 
1-800-876-7060 (9:00a.m. - 5:30 p.m.. EST, Monday - Friday). Or, write to the Federal Trade Commission, 6th Street and 
Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20580. Although the FTC generally does not intervene in individual consumer 
disputes, the information you provide may indicate a pattern of possible law violations requiring action by the Commission.</p>
<p>If you charged your trip to a credit card, you may dispute the charges by writing to your credit card issuer at the address 
provided for billing disputes. Try to do this as soon as you receive your statement, but no later than 60 days after the bill's 
statement date. In some circumstances under the Fair Credit Billing Act, your credit card issuer may have to absorb the charges 
if the seller does not resolve your dispute. If you did not authorize the charge, you are not responsible for its payment.</p>

addition, for single free copies of Timeshare Tips, Timeshare Resales, or Fair Credit Billing contact: Public Reference, Federal

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission </h3>
<h2>Timeshare Resales -- November 1992</h2>
<p>If you own a vacation timeshare, be cautious about people who offer to help you resell your timeshare for a fee. Some sales 
programs of this type may be bogus. Be careful to deal only with legitimate sales companies.</p>
<p>A vacation timeshare gives you the right to use a vacation home for a limited, pre-planned period over a number of years. 
Consumers own about 1.5 million timeshares. One survey estimates that about 870,000 of these timeshares currently are 
available for resale. Some of these owners could get taken in by timeshare resale scams.</p>
<h4>How Bogus Timeshare Resale Companies Operate</h4>
<p>Companies that use questionable practices operate like many other telemarketing scams. You might be contacted by a telephone 
salesperson or through a postcard asking you to call a particular telephone number about your timeshare. The salespeople are 
likely to tell you that the market for resales of timeshares is &quot;hot&quot; and that their company has a high success rate in reselling these 
units. They may claim they have extensive lists of sales agents and potential buyers for timeshares. For an advance &quot;listing&quot; fee, 
often around $300 to $500, these salespeople promise to sell your timeshare for a price equal to or greater than the amount you 
originally paid. To entice you, these companies may offer a money-back guarantee or a $1,000 government bond if they cannot 
sell your timeshare within a year.</p>
<p>The market for resales is poor because there is no secondary market for timeshares. In fact, a survey found that only 3.3% of 
owners reported reselling their timeshares during the last 20 years. Also, the market for resales may vary considerably, 
depending on the location and season of the year for the unit. The lists of sales agents and buyers may consist of people who 
have never heard of the company or have no interest in buying a timeshare. It may be unlikely that the company can sell the 
timeshare at all, let alone at a price equal to or greater than the consumer's original purchase price. In addition, many consumers 
whose timeshares are not resold after a year may find that either their fee is not returned or they are presented with a bond worth 
as little as $60 or $70.</p>
<h4>What to Do If Your are Interested in Reselling Your Timeshare</h4>
<p>If you want to resell your timeshare and are approached by a company offering to help, you may want to take the following 
precautions:</p>
<p>Do not agree to anything over the telephone until you have had a chance to check out the company.</p>
<p>Ask the person to send you written materials to study.</p>
<p>Ask for company references, such as the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of several consumers who have used their 
services.</p>
<p>Ask where the company is located and in what states it does business.</p>
<p>Ask if the company's salespeople are licensed to sell real estate by the state where your timeshare is located, and check with the 
state licensing board if this is so.</p>
<p>Be cautious of any company charging an advance &quot;listing&quot; fee for its services. Consider opting for a company that offers to sell 
for a fee only after the timeshare is sold.</p>
<p>Ask the Better Business Bureau, state Attorney General's office, and local consumer protection agencies in the vicinity of the 
sales company whether any complaints have been lodged against the company.</p>
<p>If you are interested in reselling your timeshare, you have several other options. You may want to try selling it yourself, by placing 
an advertisement in a newspaper or magazine read by potential timeshare buyers. Or, you may want to contact a real estate 
agent familiar with the area where your timeshare is located. As an alternative, you may want to contact an organization that will 
try to exchange your timeshare with someone who has a unit you might find more useful or attractive.</p>
<h4>Where to Complain</h4>
<p>If you have complaints about a company that offers to resell timeshares, write to: Correspondence Branch, Federal Trade 
Commission, Washington, D.C. 20580. Although the FTC usually does not resolve individual complaints, the agency can take 
action against a company if there is evidence of a pattern of deceptive or unfair practices.</p>

<h3>Facts for Consumers from the Federal Trade Commission</h3>
<h2>Timeshare Tips -- October 1992</h2>
<p>Planning your next vacation? You may have considered &quot;vacation timesharing,&quot; the use of a vacation home for a limited, 
pre-planned time. It has become a popular way to take vacations. Sales in 1985 exceeded $1.5 billion. Many timeshare 
programs are highly regarded, but problems occasionally occur. You should consider the risks as well as the benefits before 
signing a contract or a check.</p>
<p>There are two main types of timesharing plans: deeded and non-deeded. With the deeded type, you buy an ownership interest in 
a piece of real estate. In the non-deeded plan, you buy a lease, license, or club membership that lets you use the property for a 
specific amount of time each year for a stated number of years. With both types, the cost of your unit is proportionate to the 
season and the length of time you want to buy. Obviously, a winter week in a warm climate is worth more than a summer week. 
As with any purchase that costs thousands of dollars, you should understand what you are getting before you sign any papers or 
pay any fees. The general information here should be accompanied by careful analysis and possibly professional advice 
concerning all aspects of a particular timeshare purchase.</p>
<p>The Federal Trade Commission suggests that you consider the following points before you purchase any type of timeshare.</p>
<h4>Practical Factors</h4>
<p>A major reason people buy timeshares is for the convenience of having pre-arranged vacation facilities. You might consider 
whether you will be able to use a timeshare facility regularly. For example, are your vacation plans sometimes subject to 
last-minute changes, or do they vary in length and season from year to year? Check to see if the properties have flexible use 
plans that you may consider. If you are evaluating a timeshare plan with units in several locations, also consider whether the club 
has sufficient units at the sites you prefer to give you the opportunity to use them.</p>
<h4>Investment Potential</h4>
<p>Question any investment claims made by the seller. The future value of a timeshare depends on many factors. Resales of the 
timeshare may be difficult. You may face competition from the firm that sold you the timeshare, or from local real estate brokers 
who may not want to include the timeshare unit in their listings. Closing costs, broker commissions, and financing charges also 
should be considered as part of your investment costs.</p>
<h4>Total Costs</h4>
<p>The total cost of your timeshare includes mortgage payments and expenses, such as travel costs and annual maintenance fees. 
The maintenance fees may rise at rates that equal or exceed inflation. Annual maintenance and exchange fees can add $300 to 
$500 to the purchase price. You may want to ask if limits exist on maintenance increases at the project. To help evaluate the 
purchase, compare your total timeshare costs with rental costs for similar accommodations and amenities for the same time and 
in the same location.</p>
<h4>Document Review</h4>
<p>Do not act on impulse or under pressure. Review all documents or have someone familiar with timesharing review them before 
you make a purchase. Find out if the contract provides a &quot;cooling-off&quot; period during which you can cancel the contract and get a 
refund. The majority of states where timeshares are located require such a cooling-off period. If there is such a provision, you 
can use that time to reconsider your decision. If there is no cooling-off period, be sure you understand all aspects of the purchase 
and review all materials before you sign.</p>
<h4>Oral Promises</h4>
<p>Be sure everything the salesperson promised orally is written into the contract. Be especially cautious and question any verbal 
claims that contradict the contract.</p>
<h4>Exchange Programs</h4>
<p>Remember that exchange programs, which offer the opportunity to arrange trades with other resort units in different locations, 
usually cannot be guaranteed. There also may be some limits on exchange opportunities. You may need to request the use of 
another facility far in advance. Or, even at additional cost, you may not be able to &quot;trade up&quot; to a larger, better unit at a popular 
time of the year in an exotic location. When you trade your vacation unit for another, expect one of approximately the same 
value.</p>
<h4>Gift Giveaways</h4>
<p>Many sellers offer gifts to potential buyers who will listen to a timeshare sales presentation. Consider the value of these &quot;gifts&quot; and 
&quot;prizes.&quot; If the only reason you are going to a sales presentation is to receive a gift, then be aware that common promotional 
giveaways include gems with little or no value as jewels; &quot;gold&quot; ingots, with minimal gold content and worth no more than a few 
dollars; or &quot;vacation awards,&quot; which do not cover major costs such as travel and food. It may be to your advantage to attend a 
sales presentation only if your are interested in the program.</p>
<h4>Reputation Research</h4>
<p>Your resort will be a good place to vacation only if it runs properly. Therefore, you should consider researching the track record 
of the seller, developer, and management company before you make your purchase. Visit the facilities and, if possible, talk to 
other owners. Ask for a copy of the current maintenance budget. Learn what will be done to manage and repair the property, 
replace furnishings as needed, and give you the promised services. Will these arrangements be adequate? If so, will these 
arrangements extend over a long period of time, or just for the near future? Local real estate agents, Better Business Bureaus, 
and consumer protection offices are often good sources of additional information.</p>
<h4>Unfinished Facilities</h4>
<p>If you are considering buying a timeshare on property where the facilities have not been completed, get a written commitment 
from the sellers that the facilities will be finished as promised. One way to protect your financial investment during this waiting 
period is to require that a certain amount of your money be held in escrow. This may provide some protection for your funds if 
the developer defaults.</p>
<h4>Default protection</h4>
<p>Find out what your rights are if the builder or management company has financial problems or in some way defaults. See if your 
contract includes two clauses concerning &quot;non-disturbance&quot; and &quot;non-performance.&quot; A non-disturbance provision should ensure 
that you will continue to have the use of your timeshare unit in the event of default and subsequent third party claims against the 
developer or management firm. A non-performance protection clause should allow you to keep all your ownership rights, even if 
a third party, such as a bank, is required to buy out your contract. An attorney can provide you with more information about 
these provisions.</p>
<h4>State Protection</h4>
<p>Most states now regulate timesharing, either under existing state land sale laws or under laws that were specifically enacted for 
timesharing. The regulating authority is usually the Real Estate Commission in the state where your timeshare property is located. 
Contact that office if you have questions.</p>
<p>If you have questions or complaints about vacation timesharing, write to: Correspondence Branch, Federal Trade Commission, 
Washington, D.C. 20580. While the FTC cannot resolve individual complaints, the agency can take action against a company if 
it finds evidence of a pattern of deceptive or unfair practices. To learn about reselling timeshares, send for a free copy of

<p><font size=5>O</font>n April 15, 1996, Chrysler Corporation, facing a barrage of consumer complaints, a government investigation and a class 
action lawsuit, agreed to fix 275,000 1991-93 minivans [Caravan C-V, Dodge Caravan, Grand Voyager, and Town and 
Country], 67,000 Chrysler New Yorkers, Imperials and Dynasties, and 4,000 1991-92 Earle Premier and Dodge Monacos 
with Bendix ABS brakes manufactured by AlliedSignal. </p>
<p><font size=5>T</font>he Bendix 10 ABS system utilizes a hydraulic pump that is erratic and results in reduced braking power assistance that causes 
a wide range of &quot;unusual&quot; responses under different braking conditions. </p>
<p><font size=5>A</font>s part of its agreement, Chrysler will repair, free of charge, defective ABS brakes, will extend the warranty to 100,000 miles 
on ABS brake parts, and will &quot;buy back&quot; from owners the cost of previous brake repairs. The terms of the &quot;reimbursement&quot; 
program are still being negotiated. </p>
<p><font size=5>T</font>he agreement to pay owners for money they were induced into paying for repairs to defective vehicle is a key provision of the 
class action lawsuit Chrysler has been defending and has precedence in the 1994 buy back of 33,000 minivans by Nissan at an 
estimated cost of $200,000,000. 1987-90 Nissan minivans had been the subject of three recalls because of engine failures and 
fires before The Alexander Law Firm filed suit in April 1993. </p>
<p><font size=5>O</font>n February 2, 1994, one week before the hearing on plaintiff's motion to certify a national class action, Nissan negotiated a 
settlement of the class action, stipulated to the certification of a national class, and resolved a federal investigation by the National 
Highway Traffic and Safety Administration by voluntarily agreeing to the first known buy back of defective vehicles, in this case 
33,000 vans at fair market value [$5,000 to $7,000]. For additional details see Johnson v.Nissan Motor Company Inc., U.S.A., 
Santa Clara County Superior Court No. 730558. Wall Street Journal, February 4, 1994, page A2. San Jose Mercury, C1, San 
Francisco Chronicle, A5. </p>
<p><font size=5>I</font>n November, 1995 The Alexander Law Firm of San Jose, California and Berman, Devallerio, Pease &amp; Tabacco of San 
Francisco filed Villarreal v. Chrysler. Santa Clara CV 753706 arising from the sale or lease of thousands of vehicles 
manufactured by Chrysler Corporation from 1990 through 1995 which are equipped with defective anti-lock brake systems 
which can cause the brakes to unpredictably fail when the brake pedal is depressed. These defective ABS systems were 
manufactured by the Bendix division of the AlliedSignal Corporation, and are commonly known as the &quot;Bendix 10 ABS.&quot; </p>
<p><font size=5>A</font>ll of the Chrysler vehicles which contain these defective ABS systems were sold or leased with express and implied 
warranties. These warranties assured consumers that these Chrysler vehicles were free from defects and were properly equipped 
for the use for which they were intended. In violation of these warranties, the Chrysler vehicles were equipped with defective 
ABS systems that were prone to failure. By equipping its vehicles with the defective Bendix 10 ABS systems, Chrysler breached 
its express and implied warranties. </p>
<p><font size=5>D</font>efendant Chrysler has been aware of the serious problems with its Bendix 10 ABS system for years, and has known of the 
possible injuries and deaths that could result from ABS brake failure. Since early 1990, and perhaps even earlier, Chrysler began 
to receive numerous complaints and requests for brake repairs by consumers. Indeed, internal Chrysler memorandum, written by 
Chrysler's senior staff supervisor Rick Cortright, state that Chrysler has seen an increase in consumer calls about the Bendix 10 
system. </p>
<p><font size=5>N</font>otwithstanding notice of the defect, Chrysler, until April 15, 1996, has denied any obligation to its customers in all of its public 
statements and in its defense of this class action. Rather than honor its warranties, Chrysler has sought to forestall complaints 
arising from Bendix 10 ABS brakes through a deliberate and active public relations campaign of misrepresentations. </p>
<p><font size=5>R</font>ather than admitting to the defects in these vehicles, and seeking to repair them, Chrysler has repeatedly denied that the Bendix 
10 ABS systems are prone to failure and has affirmatively misled its consumers with respect to the safety of its vehicles. 
Fortunately that has now changed. </p>
<p><font size=5>A</font>s a result of Chrysler's previous failure to respond to consumer complaints, many consumers complained to various consumer 
or governmental groups, including the Center for Auto Safety (&quot;CAS&quot;) and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration 
(&quot;NHTSA&quot;). Virtually thousands of such complaints have been received by NHTSA, leading to its ongoing investigation into the 
ABS systems in various minivan and other car models manufactured by Chrysler. </p>
<p><font size=5>T</font>he class action lawsuit filed in Santa Clara County is not a personal injury case. Plaintiffs and members of the Class brought 
this action for equitable relief to require Chrysler, at its expense, to warn all California consumers of the defects in its ABS 
systems and to require Chrysler, at its expense, to retrofit all vehicles with ABS in California before the brake systems fail and 
injure more people. Under Chrysler's announced action, some of the damage done by Chrysler will be corrected, but partially, 
incompletely and not for all owners. </p>
<p><font size=5>T</font>hrough this class action lawsuit, Plaintiffs, and members of the Class, have demanded that Chrysler be compelled to recall and 
retrofit all vehicles manufactured between 1990 and 1995 which contained Bendix 10 ABS system, be ordered to replace the 
existing Bendix 10 ABS systems with a non-defective braking system and pay restitution of all costs incurred by Plaintiffs in 
connection with the replacement or repair of the Bendix 10 ABS systems installed in their vehicles. The class action also seeks 
economic damages for the diminution in value of Chrysler vehicles and punitive damages to ensure that Chrysler never again 
callously disregards the safety of its customers and the public. </p>
<p><font size=5>T</font>he complaint is based on Chrysler's breach of its written warranty and the implied warranty provisions of California's Uniform 
Commercial Code, breach of the implied warranty and fitness provisions of California's Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act, 
unfair and fraudulent business practices under California Business and Professions Code &#167;&#167;17200 et seq., negligent 
misrepresentation, and equitable relief. </p>
<p>The Alexander Law Firm is studying the proposal, and will be monitoring Chrysler's implementation of the recall and 
payback program. As further information develops, we will post it here. <!--
    <FONT SIZE=+2>B</FONT>ecause Chrysler's announcement extends only to certain 1991 to
1993 models years and does not include all relief demanded by the class,
the class action will continue to assure all owners full and complete
restitution and repairs.
<P>
        <FONT SIZE=+2>O</FONT>wners of 1990-95 Chrysler cars, vans and recreational vehicles
have reported mysterious brake failures in which the brake pedal would not
respond to foot pressure; brakes seemed to work normally at slow speeds but
failed at speeds higher than about 25-30 MPH; the ABS warning light would
come on on briefly and then go out; and partial and complete brake
failures.
<P>
        <FONT SIZE=+2>O</FONT>thers have complained of flashing warning lights, odd sounds, rear
brake lockup, front brake lockup, stiff brake pedal, soft brake pedal,
smoking brakes, loss of power assistance in braking, partial loss of
braking, brake pedal going to the floor with little or not braking, and
total loss of braking without warning.
<P>
        <FONT SIZE=+2>M</FONT>any failures involve fluid leaking from the ABS hydraulic
components, which are expensive to repair but relatively easy to diagnose.
But many other ABS failures occur intermittently, and mechanics cannot
reproduce them. Intermittent failures should be recorded in the ABS
computer chip, but are not, making it difficult or impossible to diagnose
the malfunction.
<P>
        <FONT SIZE=+2>A</FONT>BS is designed so that even if it fails, a vehicle's regular
brakes remain operable. But this safeguard is failing with some Chrysler
vehicles. When ABS fails, many drivers say regular brakes fail as well.
Chrysler denies this, but drivers confirm it sometimes happens.

<FONT SIZE=+1>
<FONT SIZE=+2>AACI, </FONT>the Association of Americans & Canadians in Israel, is a volunteer organization with headquarters in Jerusalem. We are thousands of North American Olim; all of us have made Israel our home.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2>AACI</FONT> has served North American Olim for over 40 years.
 Established in 1951 as the first "self help" immigrant organization in 
Israel, AACI is a unique and integral part of the Israeli absorption system. 
Serving some 50,000 adult members currently in
 Israel and a further 3,000 newcomers yearly, AACI acts as advocate for 
the entire North American Community in Israel. <P>


<FONT SIZE=+2>AACI's</FONT> varied range of activities reflects our 
cost-effective, efficient operation. We offer the most comprehensive 
absorption assistance in Israel, maintaining a staff of professional 
counselors across the country. These counselors provide expert 
information and guidance on <A HREF="employ.htm">employment</A>, 
<A HREF="apartmnt.htm">housing</A>, culture shock, 
<A HREF="timetabl.htm"> oleh rights</A>, customs & shipping,  
<A HREF="ben&serv.htm#Education"> education</A> & <A HREF="adventur.htm"> adventures in learning</A>, 
<A HREF="volunt.htm#aaci">volunteerism </A> and 
<A HREF="ben&serv.htm"> other information</A>. They also arrange
 <A HREF="sprogram.htm"></A> Events for Seniors
 and <A HREF="youth.htm"></A> Young Olim.  <P>

<FONT SIZE=+2>V</FONT>olunteers and Lay-Leaders are at the heart of 
AACI's effectiveness. We have developed a comprehensive system which 
helps Olim help each other. Volunteers meet new 
Olim at the airport, welcome them into their homes and help them 
find their way through the bureaucratic maze. Our Lay/Professional 
structure nurtures a participatory democracy. The 
partnership of professional staff and active volunteers carry out 
the policies set by membership.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2>W</FONT>e are a true service organization in the best 
North American traditions. Our emphasis is on Volunteerism, 
Professionalism and dynamic Zionism. Through our efforts towards 
successful absorption and retention of Olim, we serve as a beacon for increased Aliyah and a stronger Israel.

<FONT SIZE=+1>F</FONT>inding satisfactory employment is a key to successful 
aliyah.  AACI plays an important role in the oleh's job search and 
professional growth in Israel, and also assists potential olim in 
planning their aliyah.<P>
AACI maintains a computerized data base of contacts, referrals 
and job listings in over 90 categories;  new information is entered 
daily and all material is regularly renewed and updated.  This data 
base is the foundation for the employment services offered.<P>
<STRONG>PRE-ALIYAH EMPLOYMENT SERVICES</STRONG><P>
<FONT SIZE=+1>J</FONT>ob Developers arrange individual Pilot Trips 
for potential olim who come to explore employment opportunities prior to 
their aliyah.  This service includes circulation of resumes, appointments 
with employers, networking meetings with North American professionals, 
and counseling sessions with AACI Regional Counselors regarding olim 
rights, medical services, schools, etc.<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1>T</FONT>he Job Developers also respond to inquiries from 
abroad on employment subjects such as market trends,  licensing  and 
certification requirements, and networking options.<P>

AACI also provides up to date information on professions and employment 
opportunities to the Shlichim in the Israel Aliyah Centers in the 
US and Canada, including a periodic list of actual job openings taken 
from the Israeli press and AACI's own sources.<P>
<STRONG>SERVICES TO OLIM AND AACI MEMBERS</STRONG><P>
<FONT SIZE=+1>N</FONT>etworking is the key to discovering the "hidden 
job market".  AACI staff cultivate a wide network of employment contacts 
who are available to guide olim in their occupations, introduce them to 
potential employers and fellow professionals, take them to professional 
meetings, tell them about job openings, etc.  This information is 
provided to olim during individual counseling sessions with AACI 
Regional Counselors.<P>
AACI members are also referred to job openings listed with AACI 
through our contacts in various companies throughout Israel.<P>
AACI encourages the oleh to assume responsibility for his/her own 
job search.  Periodic workshops and regular counseling sessions focus 
on giving the oleh the tools and knowledge to conduct a successful 
job search by introducing him to the use of resource materials, 
directories, professional associations and journals.  Resume writing 
workshops and self-guided resume writing kits teach the oleh to write 
his/her own effective resume and to edit and revise an outdated one.  
Interviewing techniques are also reviewed and practiced when necessary.<P>
<STRONG>PROFESSIONAL GROUPS</STRONG><P>
AACI sponsors monthly Business Forums and Professional Networks 
throughout Israel, an opportunity for small business owners, the 
self-employed and other professionals to make important contacts, 
share experiences with others, "learn the ropes" and benefit from 
experts in their field.<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1>A</FONT> Computer Club meets monthly in Jerusalem, 
providing up to date computer related information to professionals 
and hobbyists and an opportunity to share job leads and developments 
in the field.<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1>A</FONT> women's professional network, a business and 
professional group meet monthly in Tel Aviv. Professional groups also 
meet regularly in Haifa  and Pardes Hannah area.

<FONT SIZE=+1>A</FONT>lthough AACI does not offer business advise, 
we do provide initial counseling and referrals fo those interested in 
starting their own business.

<H3>SOURCES</H3>
<OL TYPE=1, 2, 3, ...>

<LI><H4>REALTORS</H4><P>
Realtors will charge a fee - usually one month's rent for rental property 
and a percentage of the cost of property if purchased.<P>
If you work with more than one Realtor, you should avoid seeing the 
same property with two separate agents.  This would result in having 
to pay Realtors' fees to both agents.<P>

<LI><H4>COMPUTERIZED APARTMENT LISTINGS</H4>
There are two services in Jerusalem which will allow you access 
to their lists and provide you with periodic updates for a monthly fee.  
The lists provided will be based on the neighborhoods you are interested 
in and your budget.<P>

<OL TYPE=a, b, c, ...>
<LI>Shaal - 21 King George Street.  Tel: 02-6256919  Fax: 02-6254457
<LI>Ma'agar Meida - 5 Dorot HaRishonim.  Tel: 02-6253728  Fax: 02-6255424<P>
<LI>For realtor services in other cities contact your AACI regional office.
Please note:  The above do not have overseas services.
</OL><P>

<LI>NEWSPAPERS are a good source of apartment hunters.  The Hebrew 
press (especially  Kol ha'ir) generally has more ads of this type than 
the Jerusalem Post.<P>

<LI>Cities in Israel, some fairly large, still works on many levels 
like a small town.  Often apartment information can be gathered by 
asking neighborhood residents, grocery shop owners and by placing home 
made handbills in individual mailboxes.  Community bulletin boards can 
also give some good leads.  Check supermarkets and the university boards 
as well.<P>
</OL>

<H3>GENERAL ADVICE</H3>
<OL TYPE=1, 2, 3, ...>
<LI>Before renting or buying visit the neighborhood at various times 
of day and night - notice the noise levels, presence of children, 
gardens - and the general appearance of the neighborhood. To avoid 
future damage claims by owners include in the 

contract who is responsible for which repairs. Note the accessability 
of English speaking neighbors.<P>

<LI>Bruto refers to the total size of your apt. including porches, 
walls percentage of halls, elevators etc..  Netto 
refers to the actual living space of your apartment. These figures 
affect the amount of Arnona, municipal tax, paid.<P>

Adventures in learning called STUDY VACATIONS are a  significant and 
impressive part of AACI's programming for both new and veteran Olim.<BR> Under 
the Continuing Education Committee of AACI, the Study Vacation program is 
entering its second decade and has attracted over 2000 AACI members from 
all parts of Israel, since its inception in February 1986. <P>The short term 
educational experience of three or four days is open to all ages. Lectures, 
tours and "hands-on" activities combine to provide participants with a 
unique learning experience through which they discover new and exciting 
facets of Israel, understand better its problems, explore its history and 
geography and, in the bargain, meet and make new friends. <BR>Topics covered in 
the past have included archaeology; ecology and the environment; political, 
social and economic issues and challenges; arts and culture; and 
technological advances and discoveries.

</FONT></CENTER>
<HR WIDTH=60% ALIGN=center>
<P>


Here we are, AACI, once again MAKING A DIFFERENCE.
Over the years, AACI has assisted tens of thousands of North American Olim in making their home in Israel. It has enabled many of these olim to make an impact on Israeli Society.It is AACI that initiated the legislation to stop smoking in public places in Israel and to assure health benefits for Senior Citizens from abroad. It is AACI that brought the concept of beginning in schools to educate about ecology and environment.  It is AACI that is currently leading the battle against reckless driving that is killing more Israelis than terror or war.
<P>
AACI can be active in all of these areas because AACI has brought the spirit of volunteerism to Israel.  Across the country, thousands of volunteers are active in a score of activities. Volunteers meet new olim at the airport.  Volunteers assist newcomers to settle in. Volunteers run programs to meet the needs of our consituency. Volunteers organize successful lobbying. AACI volunteers have taught the concept of volunteerism to native born Israelis. 
<P>
And now,in our ongoing effort to provide the most comprehensive service to our members and prospective olim, we invite you visit our Home Page, your first stop on the way home...to Israel.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2><EM><STRONG>THE WHY? WHERE? WHAT? and HOW?</STRONG></EM></FONT></CENTER><P>
<FONT SIZE=+1>O</FONT>ne of the most difficult challenges of life in Israel is the Insurance industry. AACI members have been culturally challenged by the differences between the Israeli and the North American insurance industries.<P>
<UL TYPE=disc>
<LH><H3>Why AACINSURANCE Ltd.?</H3></LH><P>
<LI>Israeli insurance law and practice are different than in North America. 
Even if one were fluent in Hebrew, the policies are hard to understand.<P>
<LI>The variety of insurance policies that are standard in North 
America were not available in Israel.<P>
<LI>The small size of the insurance base, as compared to much larger 
populations in Canada and the USA, means that there is a constant 
fluctuation in the price of policies. Preferential treatment is 
given to special groups.<P>
<LI>The "WAR ZONE" clause increases the cost of many policies.<P>
</UL>
AACI took control by establishing our own agency to cater to the 
"critical requirements" of North American Olim.<P>
<STRONG>Where did AACI get the idea to develop its own Insurance 
Agency?</STRONG><P>
The idea to develop such an agency came right out of our North American 
Heritage.<P>
It is common practice in North America for non-profit organizations 
like AACI to develop their own insurance programs to meet the needs of 
their membership. Bnei Brith, AARP (American Association of Retired People) 
are  two examples of organizations offering large insurance programs 
of this type. Like these organizations the profits from AACINSURANCE Ltd. 
are directed to AACI to help increase services to you the member.<P>
<STRONG>What is AACINSURANCE Ltd.</STRONG><P>
AACINSURANCE Ltd. integrates all four essential insurance elements --- <BR>
The Agents, The Policies, The Collective, And The Claims Collection. 
The result is a symbol of quality insurance service for AACI members.<P>
The number one issue for AACI members is the basic need to TRUST their 
Insurance <STRONG>Agent</STRONG>. Agents are admitted to the 
AACINSURANCE Ltd. program only if they can prove themselves on these 4 
critical requirements;  <STRONG>Integrity, Professionalism, Client 
orientation and Communication.</STRONG><BR>
AACINSURANCE Ltd. agents are located all across Israel.<P>
AACI members wanted policies similar to the ones available in North 
America and tailored to their needs. AACINSURANCE Ltd. has developed, and 
is continuing to develop, the widest range of value-added policies, 
made specially for AACI members.<P>
A goal of AACINSURANCE Ltd. is to have all policies and other 
documents in English. Most documents are now in English and translation 
assistance is available at no extra cost.<P>
AACI stands behind you the member, in providing the easiest, most 
efficient and unique claims system in Israel. In cases of a problem 
AACI acts as your champion to protect your rights.<P>
AACINSURANCE Ltd. identified as a particular area of focus Marine 
Insurance and Claims handling in Israel.<P>
Marine or air cargo Insurance protects your household goods while 
they are on the move from your North American home  to the local port 
where your shipment will be assembled, across sea to the Israeli 
port, possibly to warehouse storage and ultimately to your new home in 
Israel. Each move is a multiplication of many opportunities for 
your goods to be damaged, lost or stolen. To the credit of the shipping 
industry, there is very little damage or theft compared to the 
volume of shipment and handling on the way.<BR>
<EM>AACI can't pack your personal belongings or accompany them 
safely to your home in Israel. We can provide you with "peace of mind" 
so if something does go wrong, you are well protected.</EM><P>
<STRONG>How do I contact AACINSURANCE Ltd.</STRONG><P>
For all your insurance needs be in touch Toll free in Israel with 
AACINSURANCE LTD. 177-022-5670, your local AACI regional office, and 
in the USA 1-800-922-2465.<P>

mortgages. Through these funds, administered by AACI, communities in the 
United States and Canada can provide tangible, ongoing support for 
North American Olim.<P>


AACI currently administers loan and mortgage funds totaling  over 
$2,500,000. Each fund has a volunteer committee in Israel composed 
of former residents of the sponsoring community or former members of the 
sponsoring organization. Most funds are geared to a specific target 
group. All details are available from AACI COUNSELORS.<P>

<OL type=I>

<LI><STRONG>What size Loans are available?</STRONG><BR>

per annum. The tenth year is forgiven if all payments over the first 
nine years were made consistently and on time. Payment is made in 
Israeli Shekels, linked to the U.S. Dollar.<BR>

<LI>Always bring your Teudat Oleh and Teudat Zehut.<P>
<LI>Bring original documents when possible, but never give these originals 
to anyone. Have photocopies to submit with files and applications 
when necessary.<P>

<LI>Bring photographs.

<LI>Always carry some "significant" cash as you never know when you 
will need to pay a fee.<P>

<LI>It is preferable to call ahead in advance to find out what 
documents to bring, with whom you need to speak, if there is a 
fee, etc.  You can save hours of unnecessary waiting by calling first.  
Be sure to clarify the hours that the office is open to receive 
the public.<P>
<LI>Make sure your information is complete.  A good question to ask 
is "what else do I need to bring?"<P>
<LI>Always get the name of the clerk with whom you are speaking.  
It's also a good idea to get their phone/extension number so 
you can get back to them easily if any problem arises.<P>
<LI>Be patient and keep calm.  Many clerks are willing to explain 
and be helpful to you, but obviously communication is a two-way 
street and they are responding to you.  A smile and friendly attitude 
on your part can go a long way!<P>
<LI>For discounts and benefits always carry your AACI membership card.<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+3><EM><STRONG>AACI - Post Aliyah Checklist</STRONG></EM></FONT></CENTER><HR WIDTH=60% ALIGN=center><P>
<STRONG>Have you made an appointment with an AACI counselor?</STRONG><BR>
AACI is an organization of former Americans and Canadians ready to 
help and guide you.  AACI's aliyah counselors can assist you with 
both general aliyah issues and your individual concerns.<P>
<STRONG>Have you received your complimentary membership?</STRONG><BR>
All new olim from North America are entitled to a free initial three-month 
membership in AACI. Visit or call your local regional office and 
join today!<P>
<STRONG>Have you received your teudat oleh?</STRONG><BR>
Every newcomer must have a teudat oleh (immigrant certificate) to 
facilitate all absorption processes.  This document is usually issued 
upon arrival at the airport if you process your aliyah abroad through 
the Israel Aliyah Center in North America.  If you change your status 
in Israel, go to your local Ministry of Absorption office.<P>
<STRONG>For all official transactions, it is advisable to carry with 
you: passport photos, teudat oleh, passports of all family members 
and teudat zehut (identity card) and application form where 
required.</STRONG><P>
<STRONG>Have you received your teudat zehut?</STRONG><BR>
Every Israeli carries a teudat zehut (identity card), which is your 
I.D. in many daily transactions.  Apply for a teudat zehut at your 
local Ministry of Interior office.<P>
<STRONG>Have you received your Israeli driver's license?</STRONG><BR>
An Israeli driver's license is needed to clear your car from customs. 
Make sure you get your Israeli license soon after arrival.  Apply for one 
at your local licensing bureau.  Bring along a copy of your foreign 
driver's license, passport, 2 photos, teudat oleh plus results of 
an eye examination performed by a qualified optometrist in Israel.  
Senior citizens may be asked for a medical examination report.  A 
driving test is part of the procedure.<P>
<STRONG>Have you opened bank accounts as an oleh or temporary 
resident?</STRONG><BR>
Bank accounts should be opened immediately.  Many employers, 
as well as National Insurance (Bituach Leumi) pay directly into 
your shekel account.  Foreign currency cash and travelers' checks can 
be deposited only within 45 days of your arrival in Israel as an Oleh.<P>
<STRONG>Have you registered at Bituach Leumi?</STRONG><BR>
If you have any independent children under 18 living with you, you 
may be entitled to monthly payments from National Insurance 
(Bituach Leumi).  Bring you bank account number.<P>
<STRONG>Have you registered your children in school or kindergarten?
</STRONG><BR>
You can register your children for school and kindergarten at the 
local municipality or school registration office.  Bring birth 
certificates, teudot zehut of both parents, teudat oleh and proof 
of residence.  You must also know your children's Hebrew dates of birth.  
You may be asked for other documents as well.<P>
<STRONG>Have you investigated rent subsidies at a local 
mortgage bank?</STRONG><BR>
Most newcomers are entitled to a rent subsidy when renting on 
the open market.  Bring your teudat oleh, teudat zehut and money 
for fees when you visit the bank<P>
<STRONG>Have you taken advantage of your rights to buy locally 
made goods without tax?</STRONG><BR>
Newcomers can buy many locally made articles, including 
appliances, tax free.  Before paying, bring your teudat oleh and 
the purchase order from the retailer to the local customs office 
in order to receive a tax exemption slip.<P>
<STRONG>Have you arranged for your income tax reduction?</STRONG><BR>
As a newcomer you are entitled to a reduction on your income tax.

<P>
<B>Everything You Always Wanted to Know</B>
<P>
In order to enjoy your rights as a new immigrant to purchase a vehicle, you must apply to the Regional Bureau of Motor Vehicles  (Misrad HaRishui) in your area for an Israeli Drivers' License.  Application may be made within three years of aliyah, although it is important to note that
one may not drive legally in Israel  with a foreign license three months after obtaining Oleh status and temporary resident.
<P>
Once you have received your license and are ready to purchase, this is the procedure to follow: 
<ol>
<li>Contact the car dealer and describe exactly what you want.  Be sure to specify what extras  you want and make certain they are written into the sale agreement.
<li>Usually, you must pay the full purchase price in advance (including the additions you requested) plus a fee for taking the car out of the port and registering it with the Bureau of Motor Vehicles .  Be sure that each sum is specified as there are set fees for some of these services, and if you are overcharged you will be entitled to your money back.
<li>Be sure to ask how long you will have to wait to receive your car.  If the dealer gives you some idea (one week, one month, etc.)  you will be able to keep calling him to ask when it will arrive (but be prepared for it to take longer than expected).
<li>You will need the following documents to give to your agent:
<br>	Teudat Oleh, identity card (Teudat Zehut), passport, and letter obtainable upon request at the time of application for driver's license indicating that you received your Israeli Driver's license based on your foreign license.
<li>When the vehicle has been cleared by the Tax Authorities at the port and has been registered, you will be contacted by the dealer.
<li>The car dealer will give you the Chassis No. (Mispar Shilda) and the license plate number (Mispar Rishum) of the vehicle.  In order to pick up the car, you must bring a compulsory insurance certificate (Teudat Bituach Chova) which is issued by an insurance agent and paid for at the bank.  <br>You must supply the insurance agent with the following information:
<br>	Chassis number, plate number, manufacturer of car and model,
year of manufacture and engine size (cc).
<li>You are required by law to carry compulsory insurance (which protects against body injury) and your insurance agent will explain the various optional coverage's, i.e., full comprehensive, fire and theft or third party only.  <br>You should also carry with you your Teudat Zehut, driver's license, and car registration papers.
<li>You are required to have the vehicle inspected and to renew the car license every year (except for a new car, which is after two years).  If you do not receive a renewal notice in the mail shortly before renewal date, you should contact your local Bureau of Motor Vehicle  in order to be sure your car is registered in their computer.  Always notify the Bureau of Motor Vehicles  of any address change.
<li>You may sell a vehicle purchased with Olim rights only after 5 years have elapsed from date of purchase without paying outstanding taxes, provided that the owner has been in Israel for the full five-year period.  Any vacations taken abroad during the time may or may not be added to the 5 years; this decision is made at the discretion of the Customs Authority.
<li>When you are ready to sell the car you must go to the Customs Authority in the city closest to your residence with your passport, immigrant's card, identity card and car license, and they will give you a letter canceling the restriction.  You must then take this letter to the Bureau of Motor Vehicles  who will cancel the restriction from your car license.
<li>Do not accept a personal check in payment for the car.  Suggest instead that they give you cash or a bank check which can be cashed at the same time you transfer the car ownership.
<li>When you sell the car, you and the prospective buyer together must take the transfer of ownership form (haaverat ba'alut) which is attached to the car license to your local bank.  There, you must both sign the form and pay a small sum and have the form stamped by the bank.  Do not hand over the transfer of ownership form without making sure it has been paid in the bank.  Often, the buyer will avoid or forget about transferring ownership, and you will find yourself getting parking tickets and other traffic violations long after you have sold the vehicle.
<li>There are two things to remember when purchasing a car from another new immigrant, i.e. passport to passport - Oleh to Oleh.
<BR>	The seller must open a file at Customs and be given permission by them to sell his car passport to passport, and the buyer should verify that this has been done before committing himself to purchase.
<P>	When the vehicle is transferred by the Customs from seller's passport to buyer's passport, the same 5-year restriction begins again for the new owner.
<li>When purchasing a used car, you will be required to pay the full Israeli market price.  It is important to first check one of the local price books to get a general idea of the price and then have the car checked by a special checking station.  <br>For a reasonable fee they will check the car thoroughly and will advise if any repairs are necessary.  You are then in a position to demand that the seller repair the car before you buy it or to reduce the selling price by the sum of the repairs.
<li>Follow the transfer of ownership procedure above and keep the temporary ownership form signed by the previous owner until you get a permanent form in the mail.
<li>When you get the annual inspection notice you must pay it in the bank and take it with your driver's license, identity card, car license and compulsory insurance certificate to a local testing station where they will test the brakes, wheel alignment and lights and stamp your papers accordingly.  There could be a fine if the vehicle is not tested by the date specified on the form.  Again, if you do not receive your inspection notice, car license or other pertinent papers, contact your local Bureau of Motor Vehicles.
<p>
 Remember, buying and selling a car in Israel can be done with a minimum of fuss and discomfort if you follow the old adage let the buyer beware and are careful of what you are doing.
<p>
Check that the above information has not changed with your regional AACI counselor.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+3><EM><STRONG>DRIVING IN ISRAEL - 1996</STRONG></EM></FONT></CENTER>
<P>
<B>Driving in Israel without a valid drivers' license in illegal.</B><P>

A recent decision by the Israel Supreme Court has highlighted a problem affecting some drivers who may not be driving with an Israeli driver's license.  The drivers potentially affected included long-term tourists, academics on sabbatical, new immigrants, temporary residents, returning Israelis and possibly foreign diplomats, foreign clergy and UN personnel.
<P>
The law, as is presently interpreted, permits  new immigrants and temporary residents to drive in Israel with a foreign or international driver's license for no more than 3 months.  Beyond that they are permitted to drive only with an Israeli driver's license.  Other foreign residents, including tourists, who have resided in Israel for more than 1 year, (even if that year was interrupted by trips abroad), are also permitted to drive in Israel only with an Israeli driver's license.  Any other license is not valid for driving in Israel. 
<P>
It was previously understood by many, that regular interruptions of residence in Israel, which may suffice to maintain tourist status in Israel, would also allow one to continue to drive in Israel with a foreign or international driver's license.  The Bureau of Motor Vehicles, now gives tourists the option upon passing a practical (road) drivers' test of receiving an Israeli license.  This is only for tourists who are in the country for less than 3 years continously.  
<P>
The ramification of the law is that:
<ol>
<li>The insurance policies of drivers without a valid license are not in force.  Both the compulsory insurance which covers bodily injury to drivers, passengers and pedestrians as well as comprehensive and third party insurance which covers damage and loss related to cars and other property.
</ol><br>
Recommendations:
<p>
We recommend, therefore, to all new immigrants and temporary residents to apply for an Israeli drivers' license as soon as possible and to complete the procedure within the first three months of arrival in Israel.
<p>
If you are an immigrant or temporary resident who has been in Israel for more than 3 months, driving on anything other than an Israeli drivers' license is illegal.
<p>
For tourists who are planning to remain in Israel for more than 3 months,  we recommend that you obtain an Israeli license as soon as possible in order to be driving legally in Israel
<p>
<B>PROCEDURE FOR CONVERTING  LEVEL 2 DRIVER'S LICENSE FOR PRIVATE OR COMMERCIAL VEHICLES UP TO 4000 KGS.</B>
<p>
For holders of a valid foreign or international license an abbreviated application procedure applies.  Please note: converting a foreign driver's license does not require surrendering your foreign driver's license.
<ol>
<li>Go to your local Bureau of Motor Vehicles, with your valid non-Israeli license and photocopy (both sides), your teudat oleh and teudat zehut or passport and 2 passport photos.  (Returning Israelis may convert their license on condition that the foreign license was issued at least three months prior to entering Israel.)  Please note: you must meet the minimum age of 17 and 6 months.
<li>Fill out the application, receive authorization for conversion of a foreign license and receive a payment form.
<li>Take the payment form to any Post Office and pay the fee.
<li>Go to a certified optometrist or optician to take an eye test.  (There is no optometrist at the Bureau of Motor Vehicles.)   Some optometrists do not charge for this especially if you have purchased glasses there.  Senior Citizens require a medical exam as well; women from age 60, and men from age 65.  Forms for the examination may be obtained at all offices or branches of the Licensing Bureau.
<li>Take a minimum of one lesson with an driving instructor.  (Sometimes certain driving schools insist on at least two.)
<li>Schedule and take the practical examination (road test).  You must use a driving instructor's car for this.  You schedule the road test throughout the instructor.  The test may take place at any branch of the  Bureau .of Motor Vehicles (listed below).  Bring with you a) foreign driver's license + photocopy (both sides), b) eye test certificate,  c) teudet oleh and teudat zehut, d) foreign passport, e) 2 passport photos.  The road test is conducted by an examiner from the  Bureau of Motor Vehicles.
<li>If you do not pass the road test you may take it again. 
<li>If you do not pass the road test on the second try, you will be required to pass a theoretical examination (written test) as well as an additional road test.
<p>

<DL>
<LH><H4>In Israel there are three types of car insurance:</H4></LH>
<DT><STRONG>Compulsory</STRONG> (biutach hova)<dd>Covers injuries 
to individuals.  This type of insurance is mandatory and a prerequisite 
for renewing the car's yearly registration.  The actual certification 
proving payment must remain in the car at  all times.  Compulsory 
insurance is paid for at a bank at the time of registration renewal.

<DT><STRONG>Third-party</STRONG> (bituach tzad shlishi)<dd>Covers 
property damage caused by the policyholder's car (but not the damage 
sustained by his or her car).  The insurance premium is paid to an 
insurance company.

<DT><STRONG>Comprehensive</STRONG> (bituach makif)<dd>Covers theft, 
fire and property damage in case of an accident to the policyholder's 
vehicle, as well as third-party insurance.  This insurance premium is 
also paid to an insurance company.
</DL><P>


<H4>DEDUCTIBLE</H4>
Most insurance policies include a provision requiring policyholders 
to pay for a portion of any damages to their car.  The size of the deductible is 
specified in the policy and is generally linked to the Consumer Price 
Index.  A claim paid by the insurance company to the policyholder is 
the amount remaining after subtracting the deductible.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+1>F</FONT>or 30 years following the date of entry 
into Israel as a new immigrant or temporary resident (NI/TR) you can 
continue to hold assets abroad, and can also hold foreign currency 
in Israel and transfer unlimited foreign currency to and from Israel.  
This is done through a free foreign currency account in an authorized 
bank in Israel ("Patach").<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1>I</FONT>nterest received in such an account is 
exempt from tax for the first 20 years.  From the 21st to the 30th

NI/TR must be deposited at an authorized bank within 10 days of

<FONT SIZE=+1>F</FONT>oreign currency legally converted into Shekels 
may be reconverted in the first 20 years after entry, provided at least 12 
months have passed since the original conversion.  The original bank 
documents showing the conversion into Shekels must be produced and 
surrendered to the bank.  From the 21st to the 30th year you can

It is very easy and quite legal to avoid this tax by simply having the

becomes your money and when you write a check on your foreign account, 
you are making a non-taxable transfer of your own capital.<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1>A</FONT>t the end of the 30 year period, your free

<FONT SIZE=+1>D</FONT>ue to the confusion and varied information 
regarding the National Health Law and payments, we compiled the following 
information in an attempt to clarify the new changes.<P>
<STRONG>The National Health Law:</STRONG> Guarantees equal medical 
care to all residents of Israel regardless of their age and medical 
state, and guarantees the full basket of medical services.<P>
<STRONG>What Should You Do?</STRONG>  Anyone already a member of a 
Kupat Cholim is not required to re-register with a Kupat Cholim.  
If you are registered with more than one Kupat Cholim, you will be 
considered to be registered with the Kupat Cholim fund with which you 
last registered.  In an emergency, when a resident requires urgent 
medical treatment and is not registered, this resident will be 
entitled to receive medical health services from a Kupat Cholim 
determined by the Director General of the Ministry of Health.<P>
<STRONG>If You Are a Resident but Not a Member of Any Kupat Cholim:</STRONG>  
You will be registered with a Kupat Cholim chosen by the Ministry 
of Health.  After 6 months, you will be able to transfer in accordance 
with normal procedures.<P>
<STRONG>New Immigrants (olim):</STRONG>  Will receive an exemption on 
paying the health tax during their first six months of Aliyah provided 
that they are unemployed or that their income is not higher than 50% 
of the average pay.  New immigrants receiving pensions in Israel will 
start paying the health tax after six months free if they receive a 
living allowance (d'mei kiyum).<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1>U</FONT>pon arrival in Israel, new immigrants will be 
provided with a medical insurance from which they should use to register at 
the Kupat Holim of their choice.<P>
<STRONG>Couples & Children:</STRONG>  Married may be registered 
with different Kupat Cholim.  Children under age 18 will be registered 
with the Kupat Cholim of the parents.<P>
<STRONG>Transferring to Another Sick Fund:</STRONG>  Anyone registered with 
a Kupat Cholim for at least one year is entitled to transfer to another 
Kupat Cholim. A transfer request may be submitted at any time, 
but transfers only come into effect once every 6 months (Jan. 
1st and July 1st).  Transfer Forms will be at the new Kupah that 
you wish to join.<P>
<STRONG>Supplementary Insurance:</STRONG>  May be offered by a Kupat 
Cholim for medical services not included in the basic services basket.  
Some of the Kupot have requested that their members not cancel their 
bank's standing order for supplementary insurance.  Call you Kupah 
to find out what their instructions are.<P>
<STRONG>Western Retirees:</STRONG>  For pensioners who are receiving 
Bituach Leumi allotments, your health insurance payments and 
pensions will be deducted from this.  For seniors not receiving Bituach 
Leumi payments, Bituach Leumi will be sending out an "igeret" (notice) 
in the mail telling them how to proceed.  If a notice does not arrive, 
contact Bituach Leumi.<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1>I</FONT>ncome from abroad will not affect health tax 
rates, so Western seniors who come to Israel after pension age should 
have nothing to fear by going to Bituach Leumi.  Young Western pensioners 
who arrive before their pension years, will have to go into 
Bituach Leumi to arrange payments.<P>
<STRONG>Returning Residents:</STRONG>  If a returning resident is abroad 
under 5 years he/she will be able to get immediate coverage.  If abroad 
over 5 years he/she will most likely need to pay from the date of 
return to Israel but may not be able to get coverage for 6 months.  
Check this out with Bituach Leumi.<P>
<STRONG>Self-Employed:</STRONG>  Should coordinate their payments 
through Bituach Leumi just as they coordinated regular Bituach Leumi 
payments.<P>
<STRONG>Students & Yeshiva Students:</STRONG>  Will pay NIS 49.  
Unemployed wives and children of yeshiva students do not pay.<P>
<STRONG>Salaried Workers:</STRONG>  All workers have their health 
tax deducted automatically from their salaries.  They pay 3.1% on the 
first NIS 2000 and 4.8% on the next NIS 2,000 to NIS 16,000.<P>
Above information was compiled in February 1995.  Expect prices 
to increase.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+3><EM><STRONG> Private Supplemental Health Insurance
</STRONG></EM></FONT></CENTER><HR WIDTH=60% ALIGN=center><P>




On January 1, 1995 the <A HREF="health.htm">National Health Insurance</A> Law went into effect.
While statutory  health care coverage including hospitalization now 
provides a basic basket of services for all citizens and residents, the 
demand for private supplemental health insurance has if anything increased. 
The 4 Kupot Holim (literally sick funds but in effect are similar to  
American HMO's) are reputed to provide adequate primary care (family 
practitioner and pediatrician) but do not allow freedom of choice for 
surgical care and easy access to top specialists for out-patient and 
ambulatory care.  People who pay privately tend to get quicker access to 
the most sought-after specialists.  To cope with this problem each of the 
Kupot have developed their own group supplemental programs.  These are 
relatively inexpensive and provide some coverage for private care.  
However, as elsewhere, you tend to get what you pay for, and the coverage 
is not total.  The only way to be sure of having maximum choice over 
<UL>
<LI>who will be providing the service such as surgery 
<LI>when it will be done
<LI>where (some private hospitals are not covered by the Kupot)
</UL>
is by purchasing full private supplementary health insurance such as the
programs marketed through <A HREF="http://www.aaci.org.il/insure.htm">AACINSURANCE.</A>  <p>

The description below is of the most popular program <I>Kaf HaKesef</I> - The
Silver Line, of the Israel Phoenix Assurance Co., Ltd.<P>

<H3><U>Features</U></H3>
                     

1. Prevention <br>
  A bi-annual periodic examination starting after two years. <P>


2. Surgery<BR>      
This includes expenses connected with surgery including surgeon's fee,
anesthesiologist's fee, operating expenses including implants, 
pathological exam, private nurses, private hospitalization, ambulance to 
the hospital.  This gives you private level of care and most importantly 
the right to choose who performs surgery, when, and where.  Unlike the 
Kupot group supplemental programs, it will cover all or almost all expenses
involved.  The vast majority of the top surgeons in Israel will accept 
payment by the insurance company.  Otherwise the insurance company will
reimburse the insured up to the company table for maximum amount per
specific procedure. If the Kupat Holim pays for hospitalization the
insurance plan pays you a per day hospitalization payment equivalent to 
about half of the charge for hospitalization.   There is no deductible or 
co-payment for this part of the program.<P>

3. Out-patient and ambulatory care <BR>

This includes visits to specialists and diagnostic services even if not
connected with surgery.  Co-payment of 20%.<P>

4.Implants/transplants and medical procedures which have not been 
performed in Israel<BR>
                                
Coverage for operating team fee, examinations, medications, laboratory
services, hospitalization costs, travel expenses abroad for the patient 
and a companion, costs of special medical air transportation if needed,
reasonable expenses for the stay abroad by the patient and companion, and
the costs of bringing a specialist from abroad for performing the 
transplant or for special treatment.  Total costs are covered up to 
$1,000,000 for implants/transplants and up to $100,000 for other medical 
procedures not performed in Israel. No deductible or co-payment.<P>

5. Alternative medicine       <BR>

Treatment in approved clinics for acupuncture, homeopathy, chiropractic
treatments, shiatsu, reflexology, osteopathy, clinical dietician, 
Alexander and Feldenkreis methods.
20% co-payment.<P>

<LI>The insurance company is not obliged to accept a candidate under regular 
or any other conditions.  Pre-existing conditions are excluded.

<LI>There is a more expensive plan which covers general practitioners, family
doctors, pediatricians, fertility procedures, private deliveries, elective
hospitalization for diagnostic purposes, pharmaceuticals, etc.  

<LI>There are also less expensive plans which cover a fixed list of surgical
procedures.
  
<LI>Limited long-term care coverage may be added for a very low cost.


<LI>Rates are related to age.  The insurance company is not obliged to accept a
candidate under regular or special conditions.  Pre-existing conditions are
excluded.  The descriptions included here are for general interest and are

<FONT SIZE=+1>A</FONT> person who comes to Israel on an "Oleh" visa 
or changes to the status of Oleh while in Israel automatically 
acquires Israeli citizenship unless he files a declaration refusing 
it within three months of his arrival or change of status.  In the 
latter case he becomes a permanent resident, non-citizen.  Otherwise, 
he automatically acquires Israeli citizenship at the end of the 
three months, retroactive to the date of arrival in Israel or change 
of status.  It is also possible to waive the 3 month waiting period, 
but that is not recommended.<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1>I</FONT>n order to lose U.S. citizenship, one must 
voluntarily perform an expatriatory act, and such performance must 
be coupled with an intent to give up citizenship.  Citizenship is not 
lost if there is an expatriatory act with no such intent.<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1>T</FONT>he U.S. Supreme Court has held that the act itself 
cannot be accepted as proof of intent -- there must be extraneous 
proof, and the burden of proof is on the U.S. Government to establish 
the intent to give up citizenship.<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1>T</FONT>he U.S. State Department does not regard automatic 
acquisition of Israeli citizenship (Par. 2 of the Nationality Law 
of Israel) as an expatriatory act so the issue of intent does not 
even arise.  However, if someone acquires Israeli citizenship by 
naturalization upon his application (Par. 5 of the Nationality Law) 
that can be regarded as a potential expatriating act.  But, if the 
State Department cannot prove that the person intended thereby to give 
up his U.S. citizenship, the citizenship is not lost.<P>
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Naturalized U.S. Citizens:</FONT></CENTER><P>
<FONT SIZE=+1>I</FONT>f a naturalized U.S. citizen leaves the U.S.A 
within one year of naturalization and takes up permanent residence 
abroad, this can serve as prima facie evidence in court proceedings 
to revoke the American citizenship.  However, if there were countervailing 
reasons to leave the U.S.A. and move to Israel, they can be presented 
in order to avoid loss of citizenship.  Usually a well drafted affidavit 
setting forth the reasons will be accepted by the Consul, the passport 
will be issued and the matter will go not further.<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1>I</FONT>t is recommended that if a naturalized U.S. 
citizen wishes to be in Israel during the first year after the 
naturalization, he should remain on a tourist or temporary resident's 
visa during this year.  Then, before the end of the year, he should 
return to the U.S.A. and only leave when the 12 months following 
naturalization are over.<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+3><EM><STRONG>OBLIGATION OF AMERICANS TO FILE US INCOME TAX RETURNS WHILE LIVING IN ISRAEL</STRONG></EM></FONT></CENTER><HR WIDTH=80% ALIGN=center>
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>February 1996</FONT></CENTER><P>
American tax law requires all citizens and permanent residents of the 
United States to file annual income tax returns and to pay any income 
tax or social security tax which may be due.  There is an exception for 
persons whose total gross income is so low that they would not have to 
file a Federal tax return even if they were living in the U.S.<P>
Since taxpayers permanently residing outside the United States are 
entitled to an exemption for up to $70,000 of earned income, many or 
most taxpayers do not owe any income tax.<P>
However, this exemption does not apply to social security tax so that 
self-employed persons and employees of American employers are required 
to pay social security tax on income which is exempt from income tax.<P>
The 70% exemption is only for income earned from employment or profit 
from an active business.  It does not apply to passive income such as 
interest on bank deposits, dividends, rents, etc.<P>
To sum up, most Americans residing in Israel should file annual American 
income tax returns although few of them will actually owe any tax.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+1>I</FONT>t is up to the oleh to register for an ulpan.  Information on the various ulpanim can be received at the regional AACI offices.  There are intensive Ulpanim 
run by the government or municipalities which generally run Sundays through 
Thursdays, from 8 or 8:30am to 12:30 or 13:00pm.  ....The Ministry of Absorption will 
often provide a subsidy for studies in one of the intensive Ulpanim.  Check with your 
local Ministry of Absorption to see if you will be eligible to receive this subsidy and 
tuition free, and whether or not you will be entitled to enroll.  Generally speaking, an 
Oleh needs to be within his first year in Israel to get this subsidy.  Many of the 
Absorption Centers offer an Ulpan.  There are also some private intensive Ulpanim in 
various cities where you may not be eligible for the subsidy.<P>
 
<FONT SIZE=+1>N</FONT>on-intensive Ulpanim are mostly run in the mornings, afternoons, or evening 2 to 3 
times a week depending on the individual Ulpan.  No living subsidy is available for 
attending them, the individual Ulpanim may offer tuition discounts for olim.   These 
Ulpanim can either be private or municipally/government run.  Although no living 
subsidy can be received while studying in an non-intensive Ulpan, often olim, who have 
found a job right away, attend the non-intensive evening Ulpanim in order to be able to 
work at the same time.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+1>I</FONT>ntensive and non-intensive Ulpanim may have a set time of year when they begin new 
classes, but often many of them accept people on a rolling admissions.<P>

Most school registration is done through the Education Departments of 
the individual municipalities. The educational department will let you 
know if you need to register your child at the school directly or with 
them.  Tourists coming for Sabbatical year to Israel must register 
through the municipalities and pay a charge or fee that Israeli or 
Olim children do not pay. Check with the individual municipality what 
the charges are. In general, these charges go up annually.<P>
Most municipalities require some of or all of the following documents 
for the registration process:<P>
<UL>
<LI>"Teudat Zehut" of both parents, or passport numbers
<LI>Birth certificate and birth date of child
<LI>School records of child
<LI>Inoculation records of child
<LI>Rental or purchase contract of residence of family
<LI>Last report cards
<LI>"Teudat Oleh" of family
<LI>Details of other children in the family
<LI>Year of birth of parents, occupation etc.
<LI>For ganim or first grade children, municipal form, mailed to the parents.

Israel, how do you  leave Israel for a temporary visit abroad?<P>
<STRONG>Passports\ Travel Documents</STRONG><P>
<FONT SIZE=+1>T</FONT>o prevent problems, make sure that both your 
Israeli passports\ travel documents, and American\Canadian passports 
are always up to date.<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1>I</FONT>f you are not yet an Israeli citizen, that is, 
3 months have not passed since you became an Oleh, make sure that you 
speak to your local Ministry of Interior to arrange an Israeli travel 
letter, "michtav maavar". In cases of EXTREME emergencies, airport 
officials at Border Police have been known to permit olim to leave on 
their Foreign Passport, but, officially, you must have a "michtav maavar"   
Once you become an Israeli citizen, arrange your first Israeli Travel 
Document. Keep it up to date.<P>
<STRONG>Army Exit Permit</STRONG><P>
<FONT SIZE=+1>F</FONT>rom the time that you become an Oleh, if you are 
eligible for the Army, make sure that you have arranged an Army Exit 
Permit, "heter yetziah", to leave the country.   Before you have served 
in the army, this must be arranged at the local Army Induction Office, 
"Lishkat Ha'Gius". After serving in the army, you must arrange your 
exit permit with your individual division. For some units, this pass 
is stamped in your passport and is good for the duration of 
the passport. If you have an extreme emergency, there is an Army 
Representative ("Netzigut Tzahal") at the Airport, Tel 03-9710111.<P>
<STRONG>"Chevrat Idud"</STRONG><P>
<FONT SIZE=+1>M</FONT>ake sure of the following information if you 
are amongst olim that have availed themselves of funds\loans from 
"Chevrat Idud".   Make sure that "Chevrat Idud" always has your current 
address.  Any change of address should always be sent to them.   When 
you apply to the Ministry of Interior for an Israeli Travel document or 
passport, " Chevrat Idud" is automatically informed.<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1>T</FONT>heir assumption, whether correct or not, is that 
you are leaving the country.  They will send you a Hebrew letter, 
saying that they understand that you are intending to exit Israel, and 
they are requesting that you come into their office closest to where you 
reside, to arrange either repayment or to provide guarantees for the loan. 
Even if you are not leaving the country, you must go into the office, 
otherwise, "Chevrat Idud" may take out a court order preventing you from 
leaving Israel. This court order can be revoked by a lawyer and is a 
complicated and costly procedure.<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1>O</FONT>ur recommendation to avoid problems is : For people 
who have taken out "Chevrat Idud" loans, approach them when applying for 
an Israeli travel document or passport. Do not ignore the letters 
from "Chevrat Idud" if you receive one.<P>


<STRONG>Travel Agent</STRONG><P>
<FONT SIZE=+1>F</FONT>ind your self a good, trust worthy Travel Agent. 
Try  Ophir Tours' <A HREF="ophir.htm">The AACI Travel Experience</A> for 
your convenience!<BR>
Arrange Travel Insurance!<P>
<STRONG>Foreign Currency</STRONG><P>
<FONT SIZE=+1>B</FONT>efore you leave, if you wish to take out dollars 
from your Foreign Currency Account, make sure that you bring your airline 
ticket and passports to the Bank. Check with your bank to see what the 
limit of dollars you can withdraw is. Remember, after your trip, if you 
wish to put dollars back into your account, an Oleh who travels overseas 
can deposit foreign cash in a "Patach" account for 10 days only from his 
date of return.   (However, you may deposit cash in "Patach" accounts 
within 45 days from your date of Aliyah.)<P>
<STRONG>Other Bits of Advice</STRONG><P>
<FONT SIZE=+1>K</FONT>eep your old expired passports and all your 
documents as well as photo copies of them, as proof of exits and 
entrances to Israel, in case you leave, and want to inquire about 
freezing of rights.<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1>S</FONT>peak to your AACI Counselor if you would like 
to go over these details or to check if anything has changed.<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1>W</FONT>hen buying your tickets don't 
forget <A HREF="ophir.htm"> THE AACI TRAVEL EXPERIENCE OPERATED BY

<H3>Bezek Update
<BR>

There have been several changes in phone numbers over the last year or two in Israel, but there are more changes scheduled for this year. Bezek has told us that by the end of 1996, all phone numbers in Israel will be 7 digits.<P>
The additional digit will be added to the beginning of the telephone number. This will advance Bezek's telephone system technologically. If you receive any information sheet with telephone numbers on it, make sure you also look at this telephone update.<P>

According to the Bezek Information sheet in our hands, the following schedule of changes have taken or will take place:
<P>

PNAI is an all-volunteer, non-profit, non-fundraising organization.  Besides 
parents, we also welcome as members children, siblings, grandparents, and other 
close relative of North American Israelis.<P>

Formed in 1974 by a core of 12 families in the NYC area led by Nahum and Sylvia 
Weissman (z"l), our purpose, then and now, is to be a strong bridge of support to 
our children, grandchildren and close relatives in Israel, to the State of Israel and 
among ourselves.  Our membership is diverse regarding religious practices, 
political preferences, socio-economic status, etc., and we never impose a uniform 
outlook.  We are bound together by a common hope and concern for our families' 
future.<P>

PNAI provides a platform for sharing the interest and excitement of having family 
members actively participating in the challenging task of building a Jewish State.  
It also offers support and a sympathetic shoulder to lean on when separation from 
loved ones  becomes too difficult to deal with alone.  Even though many of us are 
involved in other organizations, our special group has a tie that binds us in an 
exclusive way.<P>

We strive to keep thoroughly well-informed about all issues concerning Israel. We 
are working to assist our children, and all olim, to achieve successful absorption, 
surmount the difficult problems of housing, make travel to and from Israel easier, 
to promote the increased purchase of Israeli products, and establish landsmanshaft 
groups in Israel in cooperation with the Association of Americans and Canadians in 
Israel (AACI).  The AACI also administers our interest-free Emergency <A HREF="loan&mor.htm">Loan Fund</A> 
available to offspring of members.<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+3><EM><STRONG>Kibbutz Division</STRONG></EM></FONT></CENTER><HR WIDTH=60% ALIGN=center>
The National Kibbutz Committee of the AACI came into being about 25 years 
ago in an attempt to answer the needs of members who chose a rural and a 
collective lifestyle. As opposed to their city cousins, the kibbutz 
member's concerns had nothing to do with mortgages, professions, income 
tax, schools etc. since all these 
matters were handled by their respective kibbutzim.<P>

What kibbutz members wanted was to be associated with an oleh 
organization which gave additional impetus to his or her desire to 
live on a kibbutz and give further 
expression to their Zionism and Judaism.<P>

We make a special effort to work with those that are seriously 
considering the kibbutz way of life as a meaningful alternate and 
do our utmost in helping them adjust not only to this shared venture 
but if the necessity arises and the kibbutz is not the answer, then 
to find their place in the greater Israel society.<P>

To this end the Inter Kibbutz Committee periodicly publishes a 
'bulletin'. In addition, seminars, conferences and forums are held 
to discuss the burning issues of today such as:<OL>
<LI>Changes on the kibbutz
<LI>Religous Issues
<LI>Problems of the single kibbutz member
<LI>Ecology, energy and the environment
<LI>Equality of women.<P>
</OL>

This is only a brief outline of some of the issues covered. Our aim 
is to inform, educate and give guidance. We are not an alternative to 
the information that is given out by the shlichim of the various 
Zionist bodies, the Jewish Agency or the Kibbutz Movements. Instead, 
we give supplemental information based on all of us living on kibbutzim 
anywhere from five to over thirty years and representative of different 
kibbutz movements and ideology.<P>
FAQ
<OL>
<LI>Have all the kibbutzim reverted to family sleeping arrangements?
<LI>Can I work off the kibbutz?
<LI>What is the attitdue towards owning and operating private cars?
<LI>What about private funds?
<LI>What has happened in the field of education, mainly from grades 
one and higher?
<LI>On certain kibbutzim the dining room has been closed down, 
partially and fully. How does this affect community living?
<LI>Holiday celebrations, have they been affected?
<LI>How large are the apartments?
<LI>How has the recent health law affected the kibbutz?
<LI>Pensions on the kibbutz?
</OL>


This is but a few of the FAQ's that we get. We don't claim to have all 
the answers but we may be able to guide you. THERE'S NOTHING BETTER THAN 
TO EXPERIENCE KIBBUTZ LIFE.<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>RECOGNIZING THE NEED</FONT></CENTER>
<P>

AACI, in establishing 
<A HREF="insure.htm"> AACINSURANCE</A>
, recognized the need for an advisory service on Insurance matters for prospective Olim. There are many insurance factors one must consider before making Aliyah. Such as, which policies to cancel, which are better than the Israeli policy, and what policies are  really need.
<P>

AACI, together with 
<A HREF="insure.htm">AACINSURANCE </A> 
and 
<A HREF=#TOP>RBI</A>
Brokerage, Inc., has created the Aliyah Insurance 
<A HREF=#TOP>Advisory Service</A>
(AIAS) to provide insurance information to those making or planning to make Aliyah.
<P>

The service will provide you with the following FREE services;
<UL>
<LI> An evaluation of the insurance policies you currently hold
<LI> Suggestions on what to do with such policies upon Aliyah 
<LI> Suggestions on what, if any, other policies you should consider purchasing prior to, or after Aliyah, both in North America and in Israel.
</UL>

A summary of the issues can be found below.
<P>

This service is available to Olim and members of the AACI and may be accessed by:
<P>

</TABLE>
<P> 
Ask for Paul Wolf
<P><BR>


There are basically two categories of insurance policy:

 <UL>
<LI> Those which <FONT SIZE=+1><B>PROTECT</B></FONT> your property (Property & Casualty)
<LI> Those which <FONT SIZE=+1><B>PROTECT</B></FONT>your person (Life & Health)
</UL>
<BR>

<U><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Property & Casualty Policies</B></FONT></U><BR>
(Known in Israel as "Elementary Insurance")
<P>
<U>
<FONT SIZE=+1>THESE</FONT> <FONT SIZE=+2>PROTECT:</FONT></U><BR>
<B>Your Property risks</B> - Homeowners insurance and<BR> 
<B>Your Casualty risks</B> - Automobile or Liability Insurance.
<P>

This type of policy is purchased to insure a specific piece of property or liability. Therefore, such a policy is usually not continued once the property is sold, or the liability no longer exists. These policies are normally renewable each year and may be subject to adjustments in premium at each renewal.
<P>

<UL>Q: What should I do with my Property & Casualty Policies during the Aliyah process?</UL
<P>

Upon vacating your residence, cancel all homeowners policies. If you are keeping your home in North America you may need to insure the building. however, insuring the contents will depend on what is left in the house. Speak to your North American Agent about this.
<P>
Automobile policies should be canceled when selling or returning your car.
<P>

<U><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Life & Health Policies</B></FONT></U><BR>
These policies PROTECT you and your family in case of:
 <UL>
<LI> Death - Life Insurance
<LI> Sickness - Health Insurance
<LI> Disability - Disability & Long Term Care Insurance
</UL>


These policies are generally portable, and may frequently be purchased in one country and still cover you in another. In general they automatically continue <B>as long as the premium is paid.</B>
<P>

<UL>
<U><B>Q:	What do I do with these Policies when I make Aliyah ?</B></U>
</UL>


<U><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Life Insurance:</B></FONT></U>
 <UL>
<LI> When you purchase life insurance in North America, you will generally be asked whether or not you intend to live outside the United States or Canada. 
<LI> The premiums payable, under most Life Insurance policies are directly affected by where you intend to live. 
<LI> Many insurance companies will not issue a policy to someone who, at time of purchase, is not living nor intending to live in North America.
</UL>

However, if you do purchase a policy and then decide at some later stage to leave North America, the policy will normally not be invalidated. Some policies may have restrictions on place of residence, while the majority of policies are free from such restrictions. If you purchase a policy with no restriction and decide later to "make Aliyah" you will not jeopardize the policy and can continue to pay premiums from Israel.
<P>

<U><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Health Insurance:</B></FONT></U><BR>
Most health policies cover you for only 60 or 90 days when out of the country. The exact amount of time will vary according to insurer. Don't assume that "they will never know" - remember that the insurer may overlook time out of the country when the claim is small, BUT, when you have a large claim,
they may look for any reason not to pay the claim. All they need to do is ask for your passport and or ticket.
<P>

Get in writing (from your insurer) the exact details of any time or other limitation on your Health Care Coverage while you are outside of North America.
<P>

<U><FONT SIZE=+1><B>World-Wide Health Policies:</B></FONT></U><BR>
There are health policies available which will cover you for private care, anywhere in the world. In Israel these policies will pay for a private doctor and hospital. They will also cover you for care in the United States, Canada or anywhere else you may decide to travel to have the care performed outside of Israel. 
<P>

You can apply for these policies at anytime - either prior to or post Aliyah.
<P>

<U><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Disablility Insurance</B></FONT></U><BR>
These policies are generally purchased in connection with a specific profession or employment. If your disability insurance can be continued after leaving a specific employer, you should check to see whether it covers you. Some of these policies may have a "war zone" exclusion, which may invalidate the policy in Israel. 
<A HREF="insure.htm">AACINSURANCE </A>
has found that the cost of such policies in Israel compare favorably with the equivalent policies in North America. We suggest that your current policy is checked by our 
<A HREF="#TOP">Advisory Service</A>
 to see whether your policy can be replaced by a new one purchased in Israel.
<P>

<U><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Long Term Care Insurance:</B></FONT></U><BR>
Most long-term care (nursing) policies, purchased in North America, will only pay benefits in North America. There are, however, a few policies that  will pay benefits anywhere in the world. Check with our 
<A HREF="#TOP">Advisory Service</A>
 for details of such policies.
<P>

<U><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Special Aliyah Coverage :</B></FONT></U>
<UL>
<LI>Shipping Insurance is available from 
<A HREF="insure.htm">AACINSURANCE </A>
 to cover your shipments which specialize in insuring Aliyah shipments. 
<P>
	<UL>
    <I>AACI can't pack your personal belongings or accompany 
	them ensuring their safe arrival to you in Israel. But we 
	can provide you with the peace of mind" so that  If 
	something does go wrong, you are well protected."</I>
     </UL>
<P>
<LI> You should also consider travel insurance for your accompanying baggage.
<LI>  Please remember that you are not covered by Israel's health insurance system until you arrive in Israel as an Oleh. Therefore you should ensure that you have adequate health coverage until that point of time.
</UL>


<U><FONT SIZE=+1><B>To sum it up :</B></FONT></U>
 <UL>
<LI> Your Property and Casualty policies can probably be canceled on relinquishing the property, but check with your agent or broker before doing so.
<LI> Life and Health Policies should always be reviewed by an insurance expert knowledgeable in insurance matters in both Israel and North America. 
</UL>


AACI and 
<A HREF="insure.htm">AACINSURANCE </A>
offers you as an Oleh this free service. We are pleased to offer the services of Paul Wolf,  of

One must obtain an Israeli CPA license to work as a certified accountant 
in Israel.  This is done through the Auditors Council.  CPAs from the US 
and Canada are exempt from all exams except for Laws of Bodies Corporate; 
Taxation; Commercial, Labor and other Laws.  Exams are mostly multiple 
choice with a few essays.  The exam may be taken in English.  Olim 
accountants who are not CPAs must take additional exams.  Exams are 
given twice a year, in the spring and fall, and registration takes 
place a few months beforehand.  Preparatory courses are given by 
the Ministry of Absorption and by private accountants.  It is possible 
that in the future a Hebrew proficiency exam may also be required.  
Depending on one's work experience, a minimum of a six month internship 
is also necessary.<P>
Be sure to bring with you your original license plus clear copies, 
a letter from your licensing body indicating that your license is in 
good standing and specifying the period of your work experience, 
letters of recommendation from employers detailing your work experience, 
and a curriculum vitae.<P>
The Institute of CPAs is a voluntary body for the advancement of 
the accounting profession and has a committee to assist olim.<P>

To be registered as an architect one must be recognized by the Director 
of Licensing and Registration of Engineers and Architects.   You are 
required to hold a degree from a recognized institution of higher learning.  
Generally speaking, recognition of one's credentials is sufficient in 
order to practice in Israel.  However, additional evaluation procedures 
may be implemented if you hold a diploma that is not from a recognized 
institution of higher learning or if you have a diploma in a specialty 
not recognized in Israel.  You can apply to the Registrar from abroad 
to clarify your status.<P>
To be licensed as an architect you must have worked in your field 
for at least three consecutive years after completing your studies 
and must provide proof of such employment.  Employment outside Israel 
is recognized but it is necessary to have one year's work experience in 
Israel before being granted a license.  If you worked for less than 
three years you must complete the remainder in Israel;  your experience 
outside of Israel will count if you submit your application within one  
year of your aliyah.<P>


Be sure to bring with you your original diploma and notarized copies, 
a complete transcript of courses taken and documented proof of your 
employment history.<P>
The Association of Engineers and Architects is a professional organization 
with information on the field in Israel;  it also publishes a professional
