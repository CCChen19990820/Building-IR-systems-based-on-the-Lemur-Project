<P><B>R</B>eed Smith Shaw  & McClay is a Mid-Atlantic firm founded more than 100 years ago in Pittsburgh. It is currently made up of more than 350 lawyers practicing in seven cities,  and offers legal services in all traditional areas of the law. For at least the last decade,  the Firm has maintained a very active practice in the area of alleged white collar crime.
<P>
<CENTER><H3 ALIGN=CENTER>White Collar Crime Group</H3></CENTER>

<P>Five former prosecutors working in three of the Firm's offices devote a significant portion of their practices to criminal matters. Their successes in recent years have included securing acquittals or dismissals for: a former federal cabinet officer charged with fraud on a minority set-aside program; an executive director of a major state agency charged with public corruption; a steel company charged with price-fixing; an officer/director of a major savings and loan charged with fraud and conspiracy; and a retailing consultant charged with `racketeering.' Numerous other clients,  both corporate and individual,  have been counseled successfully through labyrinthian criminal investigations. The Firm has also conducted numerous internal corporate investigations directed toward determining the existence of,  and appropriate response to,  alleged misconduct by corporate officers or employees.<BR><P>Reed Smith's approach to such matters often teams an experienced trial lawyer with other members of the Firm familiar with the substantive area of the law involved. The breadth of the Firm's practice almost always ensures the availability of appropriate legal expertise.<BR>
<BR><P>In counseling clients facing allegations of criminal misconduct,  Reed Smith remains alert to the collateral consequences of those allegations,  including the potential for civil liability,  debarment,  suspension,  or forfeiture. Similarly,  the Firm recognizes and accounts for the reputational damage a client can sustain even in cases where the underlying allegations prove to be unfounded.<BR>

<P><B>S</B>eyfarth,  Shaw,  Fairweather  & Geraldson is an international,  full-service firm consisting of more than 334 lawyers with offices in Chicago,  Los Angeles,  New York,  San Francisco,  Sacramento,  Houston,  Washington,  D.C.,  and Brussels. Eight of our attorneys practice white collar criminal law nationwide. Our resources assure our clients that their white collar criminal law needs will be met. Seyfarth Shaw's attorneys are accustomed to the high stakes and rapid pace of criminal litigation. We are also sensitive to the public relations and political considerations that criminal investigations often carry. Corporate and individual clients are given close,  attentive service during what are often very difficult circumstances.
<P><BR><P>SSF &G's criminal practice group has handled numerous complex criminal cases and achieved superior results for its clients. Those cases have ranged from high-profile cases such as the independent counsel investigations of the Iran-Contra affair and the Clinton passport matters,  and the FBI's `Ill Wind' defense contractor investigation to less-publicized cases in a variety of subject-matter areas which have come to be criminalized in recent years.<BR><P>SSF &G's substantial criminal practice has developed experience in a number of areas,  including health care,  the environment,  money laundering,  antitrust and government contracts,  and others. We are sensitive to the interrelatedness of criminal matters with parallel civil and administrative proceedings. The modern trend favoring internal investigations,  voluntary disclosure,  and self-compliance requires that a criminal practice be capable of providing structured guidance in each of these areas. Because of the extensive trial experience of Seyfarth Shaw's criminal lawyers,  our clients are well-represented should a court appearance become necessary. The Firm's guiding principles are careful analysis,  intense preparation,  and forceful presentation.<BR>

The Firm likewise has advised a number of banking and nonbanking organizations in connection with RTC-assisted dispositions of failed thrifts' assets and liabilities.<BR>
<BR><P>We have extensively advised and represented companies that are policyholders of financially troubled or insolvent domestic and foreign liability insurers. We advise companies that have various kinds of claims against insolvent insurers,  including products liability,  asbestos-related,  mass tort,  and environmental claims. We have advised companies considering bankruptcy on the procedural and substantive impact of bankruptcy on claims against insurance carriers for mass toxic tort or environmental liability,  and represent debtors in litigation against insurers with respect to such claims.<BR>
<BR><P>Our lawyers have developed substantial experience regarding the effect of bankruptcy on environmental obligations as part of advising clients and litigating on their behalf regarding environmental obligations,  particularly cleanup of hazardous wastes,  and contribution claims against other potentially responsible parties. The Firm has substantial experience in providing advice about,  and conducting negotiations and litigation over,  pension and other employee-benefit claims against insolvent enterprises. We have advised banks and other participants in the derivatives industry on the enforceability of swap agreements in the event of the insolvency or bankruptcy of a counterparty.<BR>

Restructuring and bankruptcy work entails teamwork and is multidisciplinary. One of the firm's great strengths is the ability to bring to our matters a wide array of expertise in addition to bankruptcy,  we have substantial expertise in litigation,  corporate finance,  M &A,  securities law,  tax,  employee benefits and real estate. Kramer Levin's practice groups work fluidly with each other we have access to the best talent within the firm and draw upon our full breadth as needed for each matter.<P><BR><P>Our diverse bankruptcy practice includes representations of debtors,  creditors' committees,  banks,  bondholders,  investors,  DIP lenders,  and acquirors. We find this diversity of experience immensely valuable in helping our clients to understand,  and effectively deal with,  the mentality of other constituents. Our work in these varied contexts also has earned us the respect of a wide range of parties; our credibility with adversaries inures to our clients' benefit.<BR><P>We have particular experience resolving intercreditor issues within the many groups of committees we have represented; these representations have been a primary focus of our work in recent years. Our style is to inform and mediate the debate and help all parties reach workable solutions.<BR><BR><P>Special mention should be made of our experience in the tax area. Tax issues typically are very material to reorganizations. Because of our integral role in many complex cases,  we have a truly outstanding familiarity with the tax rules applicable to reorganizations a depth that few firms in the country can match.<BR><BR><P>We also have developed unusual familiarity with litigation issues germane to bankruptcy and reorganizations. Although many lawyers give advice regarding fraudulent conveyance law,  we have had real-case experience representing a number of clients in actual and potential fraudulent-conveyance litigations. We also have extensive experience in a wide array of bankruptcy cases negotiating and litigating all aspects of asset sale transactions,  including issues relating to the terms and conditions of an auction,  valuing bids,  break-up fees,  and expense reimbursements.<BR><BR><P>Our national reputation has been most recently evidenced by our selection as general bankruptcy counsel for the Official Committee of Tort Claimants in the Dow Corning bankruptcy case,  the largest pending reorganization case in the U.S.<BR><BR><P><I>Group Representations</I> Buddy L (creditors' committee),  New Valley (preferred stockholders),  Integrated Resources (senior public debt and commercial paperholders),  Mobile Technologies (subordinated bondholders),  Feuer Leather (bank syndicate),  Lexington Precision (bondholders),  Kinder-Care (new investors,  bank committee),  Financial News Network (creditors committee),  Rexene (noteholders' committee),  The Company Store (stockholders),  Interco (subordinated bondholders' committee),  Webcraft (subordinated bondholders' committee),  G.

<P><B>F</B>rom secured lenders,  bondholders,  and official creditors' committees to debtors,  examiners,  and acquirors of assets from distressed entities,  Latham  & Watkins regularly represents major players on every side of restructuring transactions,  both in and out of court. The matters routinely handled by its insolvency team span the spectrum of transaction types,  from the largest and most complex Chapter 11 cases in history to regional single-asset bankruptcies. Nationally recognized partners who have practiced in the insolvency area since the early 1970s lead teams representing creditors and debtors in major matters in a wide range of industries,  including airlines (Continental Airlines,  Midway Airlines),  banking (MCorp,  First RepublicBank Corp.),  retail (Federated Department Stores,  Best Products Co.,  Inc.),  insurance (First Executive Corporation,  First Capital Holdings Corp.),  entertainment and media (Weintraub Entertainment Group,  Vestron,  Inc.,  SCI Television,  Inc.,  Fair Lanes,  Inc.),  hotels (Northview Corporation,  Imperial),  government (Orange County Official Subcommittee of Bondholders),  financial services (New Valley Corporation,  formerly Western Union Corporation),  and agriculture (Sun World). Also,  through its active international practice,  Latham has represented the administrators of Polly Peck International,  the agent for a bank syndicate in the Olympia  & York cases,  and numerous foreign clients in U.S. ancillary cases in aid of foreign insolvency proceedings.
<P><BR><P>In addition to its traditional bankruptcy and workout practice,  Latham,  the country's ninth largest law firm,  has extensive experience in out-of-court restructurings,  including exchange offers and tender offers for outstanding debt securities,  pre-packaged and pre-negotiated Chapter 11 reorganizations,  and other innovative restructuring transactions. Major pre-packaged bankruptcies in which Latham has played a significant role include those of: Cherokee,  Inc.; Kash N' Karry Food Stores,  Inc.; The Southland Corporation; Price Communications; JPS Textile Group,  Inc.; Munsingwear; MB Holdings; Intermark; Triton Group; Charter Medical; SPI Holding; and The Restaurant Enterprises Group,  Inc. In the past three years,  Latham has represented issuers,  financial advisors,  and dealer managers in over 75 debt tender offers,  exchange offers,  and consent solicitations involving over $29 billion in debt. The firm is also active in representing investment bankers,  commercial banks,  and institutional investors in the purchase and sale of interests in distressed bank credits.<BR><BR><P>Latham's lawyers practicing nationally in the insolvency area are led by well-known members in the bankruptcy bar. <B>Robert J. Rosenberg</B> (New York),  co-head of Latham's Insolvency Practice Group,  has,  for a number of years,  chaired the Practising Law Institute Advanced Bankruptcy Workshop and the Workshop on Bankruptcy Developments for Workout Officers and Lenders' Counsel. He is a leading commentator on fraudulent conveyance issues and is an author of <I>Collier Bankruptcy Practice Guide</I>. Rosenberg,  along with his partners,  Insolvency Practice Group co-heads <B>Michael S. Lurey</B> (Los Angeles) and <B>Martin N. Flics</B> (New York),  co-authored <I>Collier Lending Institutions and the Bankruptcy Code</I> (1985). Lurey and Rosenberg are frequent lecturers on bankruptcy subjects for the Practising Law Institute,  the Institute for International Research,  the American Bar Association,  and numerous other continuing legal education organizations. <B>Ronald W. Hanson</B> (Chicago) has lectured and written extensively in the areas of bankruptcy and lender liability for the American Bankruptcy Institute,  the Banking Law Institute,  the Practising Law Institute,  the American Law Institute-American Bar Association,  and the <I>Commercial Lending Review</I>.<BR>
<BR><P>Under Rosenberg's leadership,  Latham  & Watkins has represented the creditors' committees in the Continental Airlines and MCorp Chapter 11 cases,  the subordinated debtholders' committees in First RepublicBank Corp. and Harvard Industries,  and the debtor in Work Wear Corporation. Flics has represented the secured noteholders' committee in New Valley Corporation (formerly Western Union Corporation),  the creditors' committee in Vestron,  Inc. and the bondholders in Divi Hotels N.V. In addition,  the firm's New York office frequently represents major creditors in significant Chapter 11 cases,  including Credit Lyonnais in the Dow Corning Corporation case and Metropolitan Life Insurance Company in the Federated Department Stores and Best Products Co. cases. In California,  Lurey is serving as counsel to Sun World as a debtor in possession,  has served as counsel to First Executive Corporation as a debtor in possession and has represented the creditors' committee of Northview Corp. and the bank lenders in the Glen Ivy Resorts case. The Los Angeles office is also representing the Bondholder Subcommittee (whose constituency holds over $7 billion in bonds) in the Orange County Chapter 9 bankruptcy case. In Chicago,  Hanson regularly represents Citicorp and Heller Financial in insolvency matters and has handled the Appletree Markets,  OTASCO,  Inc.,  William Stoecker,  Washington Industries,  and Mercury Stainless Chapter 11 cases. The Chicago office has recently represented Congress Financial in the Value Merchants,  Inc./Everything's A Dollar,  Inc. case and the Teacher Retirement System of Texas in the One Financial Place bankruptcy. The firm also represents various lenders in Los Angeles,  Chicago,  and New York (including Continental Bank,  Congress Financial Corporation,  Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan,  and Bank America Business Credit) in providing debtor-in-possession financing.<BR>

<P>Editor's Note: A three judge panel ruled that the Communications Decency Act 
 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, is unconstitutional.</P>

<P><B>SLOVITER, Chief Judge, Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit:</B></P>


<P>A.</P>

<P>Statutory Provisions</P>

<P>As noted in Part I, Introduction, the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary
injunction is confined to portions of two provisions of the Communications
Decency Act of 1996, Section 223(a) and Section 223(d), which they contend
violate their First Amendment free speech and Fifth Amendment due process
rights.  To facilitate reference, I set forth those provisions in full.  Section
223(a), the "indecency" provision, subjects to criminal penalties of
imprisonment of no more than two years or a fine or both anyone who:</P>

<P>1) in interstate or foreign communications . . .</P>

<P>(B) by means of a telecommunications device</P>

<P>knowingly --</P>

<P>(i) makes, creates, or solicits, and</P>

<P>(ii) initiates the transmission of,</P>

<P>any comment, request, suggestion, proposal, image, or other communication which
is obscene or indecent, knowing that the recipient of the communication is under
18 years of age, regardless of whether the maker of such communication placed
the call or initiated the communication; . . .</P>

<P>(2) knowingly permits any telecommunications facility under his control to be
used for any activity prohibited by paragraph (1) with the intent that it be
used for such activity.</P>

<P>(emphasis added).</P>

<P>The term "telecommunications device" is specifically defined not to include "the
use of an interactive computer service," as that is covered by section
223(d)(1).</P>

<P>Section 223(d), the "patently offensive" provision, subjects to criminal
penalties anyone who:</P>

<P>(1) in interstate or foreign communications knowingly--</P>

<P>(A) uses an interactive computer service to send to a specific person or persons
under 18 years of age, or</P>

<P>(B) uses any interactive computer service to display in a manner available to a
person under 18 years of age,</P>

<P>any comment, request, suggestion, proposal, image or other communication that,
in context, depicts or describes, in terms patently offensive as measured by
contemporary community standards, sexual or excretory activities or organs,
regardless of whether the use of such service placed the call or initiated the
communication; or</P>

<P>(2) knowingly permits any telecommunications facility under such person's
control to be used for an activity prohibited by paragraph (1) with the intent
that it be used for such activity.</P>

<P>(emphasis added).</P>

<P>Two aspects of these provisions stand out.  First, we are dealing with criminal
provisions, subjecting violators to substantial penalties.  Second, the
provisions on indecent and patently offensive communications are not parallel.</P>

<P>The government uses the term "indecent" interchangeably with "patently
offensive" and advises that it so construes the statute in light of the
legislative history and the Supreme Court's analysis of the word "indecent" in
FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S. 726 (1978).  However,  the CDA does not
define "indecent."  Notwithstanding Congress' familiarity with Pacifica, it
enacted Section 223(a), covering "indecent" communications, without any language
confining "indecent" to descriptions or depictions of "sexual or excretory
activities or organs," language it included in the reference to "patently
offensive" in Section 223(d)(1)(B).  Nor does Section 223(a) contain the phrase
"in context," which the government believes is relevant.</P>

<P>The failure to define "indecent" in Section 223(a) is thus arguably a negative
pregnant and subject to "the rule of construction that an express statutory
requirement here, contrasted with statutory silence there, shows an intent to
confine the requirement to the specified instance." Field v. Mans, 116 S.Ct.
437, 442 (1995).  See also Gozlon-Peretz v. United States, 498 U.S. 395, 404
(1991) ("'[W]here Congress includes particular language in one section of a
statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally
presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate
inclusion or exclusion'") (quoting Russello v. United States, 464 U.S. 16, 23
(1983)).</P>

<P>Plaintiffs note the difference but do not press this as a basis for
distinguishing between the two sections in their preliminary injunction
arguments and therefore I will also use the words interchangeably for this
purpose, leaving open the issue for consideration at the final judgment stage if
it becomes relevant.</P>


<P>B.</P>

<P>Preliminary Injunction Standard</P>

<P>To obtain a preliminary injunction, plaintiffs must establish that they are
likely to prevail on the merits and that they will suffer irreparable harm if
injunctive relief is not granted.  We also must consider whether the potential
harm to the defendant from issuance of a temporary restraining order outweighs
possible harm to the plaintiffs if such relief is denied, and whether the
granting of injunctive relief is in the public interest. See Campbell Soup Co.
v. ConAgra, Inc., 977 F.2d 86, 90-91 (3d Cir. 1992); Bradley v. Pittsburgh Bd.
of Educ., 910 F.2d 1172, 1175 (3d Cir. 1990).</P>

<P>In a case in which the injury alleged is a threat to First Amendment interests,
the finding of irreparable injury is often tied to the likelihood of success on
the merits.  In Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347 (1976), the Supreme Court
emphasized that "the loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even minimal periods
of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury." Id. at 373 (citing New
York Times Co. v. United States, 403 U.S. 713 (1971)).</P>

<P>Subjecting speakers to criminal penalties for speech that is constitutionally
protected in itself raises the spectre of irreparable harm. Even if a court were
unwilling to draw that conclusion from the language of the statute itself,
plaintiffs have introduced ample evidence that the challenged provisions, if not
enjoined, will have a chilling effect on their free expression.  Thus, this is
not a case in which we are dealing with a mere incidental inhibition on speech,
see Hohe v. Casey, 868 F.2d 69, 73 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 848 (1989),
but with a regulation that directly penalizes speech.</P>

<P>Nor could there be any dispute about the public interest factor which must be
taken into account before a court grants a preliminary injunction.  No long
string of citations is necessary to find that the public interest weighs in
favor of having access to a free flow of constitutionally protected speech. See,
e.g., Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 114 S. Ct. 2445, 2458 (1994);
Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, 425 U.S. 748,
763-65 (1976).</P>

<P>Thus, if plaintiffs have shown a likelihood of success on the merits, they will
have shown the irreparable injury needed to entitle them to a preliminary
injunction.</P>


<P>C.</P>

<P>Applicable Standard of Review</P>

<P>The CDA is patently a government-imposed content-based restriction on speech,
and the speech at issue, whether denominated "indecent" or "patently offensive,"
is entitled to constitutional protection.  See Sable Communications of
California, Inc. v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115, 126 (1989).  As such, the regulation is
subject to strict scrutiny, and will only be upheld if it is justified by a
compelling government interest and if it is narrowly tailored to effectuate that
interest.  Sable, 492 U.S. at 126; see also Turner Broadcasting, 114 S. Ct. at
2459 (1994).  "[T]he benefit gained [by a content-based restriction] must
outweigh the loss of constitutionally protected rights." Elrod v. Burns, 427
U.S. at 363.</P>

<P>The government's position on the applicable standard has been less than pellucid
but, despite some references to a somewhat lesser burden employed in
broadcasting cases, it now appears to have conceded that it has the burden of
proof to show both a compelling interest and that the statute regulates least
restrictively.  Tr. of Preliminary Injunction Hearing at 121 (May 10, 1996).  In
any event, the evidence and our Findings of Fact based thereon show that
Internet communication, while unique, is more akin to telephone communication,
at issue in Sable, than to broadcasting, at issue in Pacifica, because, as with
the telephone, an Internet user must act affirmatively and deliberately to
retrieve specific information online.  Even if a broad search will, on occasion,
retrieve unwanted materials, the user virtually always receives some warning of
its content, significantly reducing the element of surprise or "assault"
involved in broadcasting.  Therefore, it is highly unlikely that a very young
child will be randomly "surfing" the Web and come across "indecent" or "patently
offensive" material.</P>

<P>Judge Dalzell's separate opinion fully explores the reasons for the differential
treatment of radio and television broadcasting for First Amendment purposes from
that accorded other means of communication.  It follows that to the extent the
Court employed a less than strict scrutiny standard of review in Pacifica and
other broadcasting cases, see, e.g., Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U.S.
367 (1969), there is no reason to employ a less than strict scrutiny standard of
review in this case.</P>


<P>D.</P>

<P>The Nature of the Government's Interest</P>

<P>The government asserts that shielding minors from access to indecent materials
is the compelling interest supporting the CDA.  It cites in support the
statements of the Supreme Court that "[i]t is evident beyond the need for
elaboration that a State's interest in 'safeguarding the physical and
psychological well-being of a minor' is 'compelling,'"  New York v. Ferber, 458
U.S. 747, 757 (1982)(quoting Globe Newspaper Co. v. Superior Court, 457 U.S.
596, 607 (1982)), and "there is a compelling interest in protecting the physical
and psychological well-being of minors.  This interest extends to shielding
minors from the influence of literature that is not obscene by adult standards."
 Sable, 492 U.S at 126.  It also cites the similar quotation appearing in
Fabulous Assoc., Inc. v. Pennsylvania Public Utility Comm'n, 896 F.2d 780, 787
(3d Cir. 1990).</P>

<P>Those statements were made in cases where the potential harm to children from
the material was evident.  Ferber involved the constitutionality of a statute
which prohibited persons from knowingly promoting sexual performances by
children under 16 and distributing material depicting such performances.  Sable
and Fabulous involved the FCC's ban on "dial-a-porn" (dealing by definition with
pornographic telephone messages).  In contrast to the material at issue in those
cases, at least some of the material subject to coverage under the "indecent"
and "patently offensive" provisions of the CDA may contain valuable literary,
artistic or educational information of value to older minors as well as adults. 
The Supreme Court has held that "minors are entitled to a significant measure of
First Amendment protection, and only in relatively narrow and well-defined
circumstances may government bar public dissemination of protected materials to
them." Erznoznik v. City of Jacksonville, 422 U.S. 205, 212-213 (1975)(citations
omitted).</P>

<P>In Erznoznik, the Court rejected an argument that an ordinance prohibiting the
display of films containing nudity at drive-in movie theatres served a
compelling interest in protecting minor passersby from the influence of such
films.  The Court held that the prohibition was unduly broad, and explained that
"[s]peech that is neither obscene as to youths nor subject to some other
legitimate proscription cannot be suppressed solely to protect the young from
ideas or images that a legislative body thinks unsuitable for them."  422 U.S.
at 213-14.  As Justice Scalia noted in Sable, "[t]he more pornographic what is
embraced within the . . .  category of 'indecency,' the more reasonable it
becomes to insist upon greater assurance of insulation from minors." Sable, 492
U.S. at 132 (Scalia, J., concurring).  It follows that where non-pornographic,
albeit sexually explicit, material also falls within the sweep of the statute,
the interest will not be as compelling.</P>

<P>In part, our consideration of the government's showing of a "compelling
interest" trenches upon the vagueness issue, discussed in detail in Judge
Buckwalter's opinion but equally pertinent to First Amendment analysis. Material
routinely acceptable according to the standards of New York City, such as the
Broadway play Angels in America which concerns homosexuality and AIDS portrayed
in graphic language, may be far less acceptable in smaller, less cosmopolitan
communities of the United States.  Yet the play garnered two Tony Awards and a
Pulitzer prize for its author, and some uninhibited parents and teachers might
deem it to be material to be read or assigned to eleventh and twelfth graders. 
If available on the Internet through some libraries, the text of the play would
likely be accessed in that manner by at least some students, and it would also
arguably fall within the scope of the CDA.</P>

<P>There has been recent public interest in the female genital mutilation routinely
practiced and officially condoned in some countries.  News articles have been
descriptive, and it is not stretching to assume that this is a subject that
occupies news groups and chat rooms on the Internet.  We have no assurance that
these discussions, of obvious interest and relevance to older teenage girls,
will not be viewed as patently offensive - even in context - in some
communities.</P>

<P>Other illustrations abound of non-obscene material likely to be available on the
Internet but subject to the CDA's criminal provisions.  Photographs appearing in
National Geographic or a travel magazine of the sculptures in India of couples
copulating in numerous positions, a written description of a brutal prison rape,
or Francesco Clemente's painting "Labirinth," see Def. Exh. 125, all might be
considered to "depict or describe, in terms patently offensive as measured by
contemporary community standards, sexual or excretory activities or organs."  47
U.S.C. Section 223(d)(1).  But the government has made no showing that it has a
compelling interest in preventing a seventeen-year-old minor from accessing such
images.</P>

<P>By contrast, plaintiffs presented testimony that material that could be
considered indecent, such as that offered by Stop Prisoner Rape or Critical Path
AIDS project, may be critically important for certain older minors.  For
example, there was testimony that one quarter of all new HIV infections in the
United States is estimated to occur in young people between the ages of 13 and
20, an estimate the government made no effort to rebut.  The witnesses believed
that graphic material that their organizations post on the Internet could help
save lives, but were concerned about the CDA's effect on their right to do so.</P>

<P>The government counters that this court should defer to legislative conclusions
about this matter.  However, where First Amendment rights are at stake,
"[d]eference to a legislative finding cannot limit judicial inquiry." Sable, 492
U.S. at 129 (quoting Landmark Communications, Inc. v. Virginia, 435 U.S. 829,
843 (1978)).  "[W]hatever deference is due legislative findings would not
foreclose our independent judgment of the facts bearing on an issue of
constitutional law."  Id.</P>

<P>Moreover, it appears that the legislative "findings" the government cites
concern primarily testimony and statements by legislators about the prevalence
of obscenity, child pornography, and sexual solicitation of children on the
Internet.  Similarly, at the hearings before us the government introduced
exhibits of sexually explicit material through the testimony of Agent Howard
Schmidt, which consisted primarily of the same type of hard-core pornographic
materials (even if not technically obscene) which concerned Congress and which
fill the shelves of "adult" book and magazine stores.  Plaintiffs emphasize that
they do not challenge the Act's restrictions on speech not protected by the
First Amendment, such as obscenity, child pornography or harassment of children.
 Their suit is based on their assertion, fully supported by their evidence and
our findings, that the CDA reaches much farther.</P>

<P>I am far less confident than the government that its quotations from earlier
cases in the Supreme Court signify that it has shown a compelling interest in
regulating the vast range of online material covered or potentially covered by
the CDA.  Nonetheless, I acknowledge that there is certainly a compelling
government interest to shield a substantial number of minors from some of the
online material that motivated Congress to enact the CDA, and do not rest my
decision on the inadequacy of the government's showing in this regard.</P>


<P>E.</P>

<P>The Reach of the Statute</P>

<P>Whatever the strength of the interest the government has demonstrated in
preventing minors from accessing "indecent" and "patently offensive" material
online, if the means it has chosen sweeps more broadly than necessary and
thereby chills the expression of adults, it has overstepped onto rights
protected by the First Amendment.  Sable, 492 U.S. at 131.</P>

<P>The plaintiffs argue that the CDA violates the First Amendment because it
effectively bans a substantial category of protected speech from most parts of
the Internet.  The  government responds that the Act does not on its face or in
effect ban indecent material that is constitutionally protected for adults. Thus
one of the factual issues before us was the likely effect of the CDA on the free
availability of constitutionally protected material.  A wealth of persuasive
evidence, referred to in detail in the Findings of Fact, proved that it is
either technologically impossible or economically prohibitive for many of the
plaintiffs to comply with the CDA without seriously impeding their posting of
online material which adults have a constitutional right to access.</P>

<P>With the possible exception of an e-mail to a known recipient, most content
providers cannot determine the identity and age of every user accessing their
material. Considering separately content providers that fall roughly into two
categories, we have found that no technology exists which allows those posting
on the category of newsgroups, mail exploders or chat rooms to screen for age.
Speakers using those forms of communication cannot control who receives the
communication, and in most instances are not aware of the identity of the
recipients.  If it is not feasible for speakers who communicate via these forms
of communication to conduct age screening, they would have to reduce the level
of communication to that which is appropriate for children in order to be
protected under the statute.   This would effect a complete ban even for adults
of some expression, albeit "indecent," to which they are constitutionally
entitled, and thus would be unconstitutional under the holding in Sable, 492
U.S. at 131.</P>

<P>Even as to content providers in the other broad category, such as the World Wide
Web, where efforts at age verification are technically feasible through the use
of Common Gateway Interface (cgi) scripts (which enable creation of a document
that can process information provided by a Web visitor), the Findings of Fact
show that as a practical matter, non-commercial organizations and even many
commercial organizations using the Web would find it prohibitively expensive and
burdensome to engage in the methods of age verification proposed by the
government, and that even if they could attempt to age verify, there is little
assurance that they could successfully filter out minors.</P>

<P>The government attempts to circumvent this problem by seeking to limit the scope
of the statute to those content providers who are commercial pornographers, and
urges that we do likewise in our obligation to save a congressional enactment
from facial unconstitutionality wherever possible.  But in light of its plain
language and its legislative history, the CDA cannot reasonably be read as
limited to commercial pornographers.  A court may not impose a narrowing
construction on a statute unless it is "readily susceptible" to such a
construction.  Virginia v. American Booksellers Ass'n, 484 U.S. 383, 397 (1988).
 The court may not "rewrite a . . . law to conform it to constitutional
requirements."  Id.  Although we may prefer an interpretation of a statute that
will preserve the constitutionality of the statutory scheme, United State v.
Clark, 445 U.S. 23, 27 (1980), we do not have license to rewrite a statute to
"create distinctions where none were intended."  American Tobacco Co. v.
Patterson, 456 U.S. 63, 72 n.6 (1982); see also Consumer Party v. Davis, 778
F.2d 140, 147 (3d Cir. 1985).  The Court has often stated that "absent a clearly
expressed legislative intention to the contrary, [statutory] language must
ordinarily be regarded as conclusive."  Escondido Mut. Water Co. v. La Jolla
Band of Mission Indians, 466 U.S. 765, 772 (1984)(quoting North Dakota v. United
States, 460 U.S. 300, 312 (1983)).</P>

<P>It is clear from the face of the CDA and from its legislative history that
Congress did not intend to limit its application to commercial purveyors of
pornography. Congress unquestionably knew how to limit the statute to such
entities if that was its intent, and in fact it did so in provisions relating to
dial-a-porn services.  See 47 U.S.C. Section 223(b)(2)(A) (criminalizing making
any indecent telephone communication "for commercial purposes").  It placed no
similar limitation in the CDA. Moreover, the Conference Report makes clear that
Congress did not intend to limit the application of the statute to content
providers such as those which make available the commercial material contained
in the government's exhibits, and confirms that Congress intended "content
regulation of both commercial and non-commercial providers."  Conf. Rep. at 191.
 See also, 141 Cong. Rec. S8089 (daily ed. June 9, 1995) (Statement of Senator
Exon).</P>

<P>The scope of the CDA is not confined to material that has a prurient interest or
appeal, one of the hallmarks of obscenity, because Congress sought to reach
farther.  Nor did Congress include language that would define "patently
offensive" or "indecent" to exclude material of serious value. It follows that
to narrow the statute in the manner the government urges would be an
impermissible exercise of our limited judicial function, which is to review the
statute as written for its compliance with constitutional mandates.</P>

<P>I conclude inexorably from the foregoing that the CDA reaches speech subject to
the full protection of the First Amendment, at least for adults.(1)  In
questions of the witnesses and in colloquy with the government attorneys, it
became evident that even if "indecent" is read as parallel to "patently
offensive," the terms would cover a broad range of material from contemporary
films, plays and books showing or describing sexual activities (e.g., Leaving
Las Vegas) to controversial contemporary art and photographs showing sexual
organs in positions that the government conceded would be patently offensive in
some communities (e.g., a Robert Mapplethorpe photograph depicting a man with an
erect penis).</P>

<P>We have also found that there is no effective way for many Internet content
providers to limit the effective reach of the CDA to adults because there is no
realistic way for many providers to ascertain the age of those accessing their
materials.  As a consequence, we have found that "[m]any speakers who display
arguably indecent content on the Internet must choose between silence and the
risk of prosecution."  Such a choice, forced by sections 223(a) and (d) of the
CDA, strikes at the heart of speech of adults as well as minors.</P>


<P>F.</P>

<P>Whether CDA is Narrowly Tailored</P>

<P>In the face of such a patent intrusion on a substantial category of protected
speech for adults, there is some irony in considering whether the statute is
narrowly tailored or, as sometimes put, whether Congress has used the least
restrictive means to achieve a compelling government interest.  See Sable, 492
U.S. at 126.  It would appear that the extent of the abridgement of the
protected speech of adults that it has been shown the CDA would effect is too
intrusive to be outweighed by the government's asserted interest, whatever its
strength, in protecting minors from access to indecent material. Nonetheless,
the formulation of the inquiry requires that we consider the government's
assertion that the statute is narrowly drafted, and I proceed to do so.</P>

<P>In this case, the government relies on the statutory defenses for its argument
of narrow tailoring.  There are a number of reasons why I am not persuaded that
the statutory defenses can save the CDA from a conclusion of facial
unconstitutionality.</P>

<P>First, it is difficult to characterize a criminal statute that hovers over each
content provider, like the proverbial sword of Damocles, as a narrow tailoring. 
Criminal prosecution, which carries with it the risk of public obloquy as well
as the expense of court preparation and attorneys' fees, could itself cause
incalculable harm.  No provider, whether an individual, non-profit corporation,
or even large publicly held corporation, is likely to willingly subject itself
to prosecution for a miscalculation of the prevalent community standards or for
an error in judgment as to what is indecent.  A successful defense to a criminal
prosecution would be small solace indeed.</P>

<P>Credit card and adult verification services are explicitly referred to as
defenses in Section 223(e)(5)(B) of the CDA. As is set forth fully in the
detailed Findings of Fact, these defenses are not technologically or
economically feasible for most providers.</P>

<P>The government then falls back on the affirmative defense to prosecution
provided in Section 223(e)(5)(A) for a person who "has taken, in good faith,
reasonable, effective, and appropriate actions under the circumstances to
restrict or prevent access by minors to a communication specified in such
subsections . . . including any method which is feasible under available
technology."  The government emphasizes that "effective" does not require 100%
restriction, and that this defense is "open-ended" and requires only reasonable
efforts based on current technology.</P>

<P>But, as the evidence made clear, there is no such technology at this time. The
government proffered as one option that would constitute a valid affirmative
defense under Section 223(e)(5)(A) a "tagging" scheme conceived by Dr. Olsen in
response to this lawsuit whereby a string of characters would be imbedded in all
arguably indecent or patently offensive material.  Our Findings of Fact set
forth fully the reasons why we found that the feasibility and effectiveness of
tagging in the manner proposed by the government has not been established.  All
parties agree that tagging alone does nothing to prevent children from accessing
potentially indecent material, because it depends upon the cooperation of third
parties to block the material on which the tags are embedded.  Yet these third
parties, over which the content providers have no control, are not subject to
the CDA.  I do not believe a statute is narrowly tailored when it subjects to
potential criminal penalties those who must depend upon third parties for the
effective operation of a statutory defense.</P>

<P>Most important, the government's "tagging" proposal is purely hypothetical and
offers no currently operative defense to Internet content providers.  At this
time, there is no agreed-upon "tag" in existence, and no web browsers or
user-based screening systems are now configured to block tagged material.  Nor,
significantly, has the government stipulated that a content provider could avoid
liability simply by tagging its material.</P>

<P>Third, even if the technology catches up, as the government confidently
predicts, there will still be a not insignificant burden attached to effecting a
tagging defense, a burden one should not have to bear in order to transmit
information protected under the constitution.  For example, to effect tagging
content providers must review all of their material currently published online,
as well as all new material they post in the future, to determine if it could be
considered "patently offensive" in any community nationwide.  This would be
burdensome for all providers, but for the many not-for-profit entities which
currently post thousands of Web pages, this burden would be one impossible to
sustain.</P>

<P>Finally, the viability of the defenses is intricately tied to the clarity of the
CDA's scope.  Because, like Judge Buckwalter, and for many of the reasons he
gives, I believe that "indecent" and "patently offensive" are inherently vague,
particularly in light of the government's inability to identify the relevant
community by whose standards the material will be judged, I am not persuaded by
the government that the statutory defenses in Section 223(e) provide effective
protection from the unconstitutional reach of the statute.</P>

<P>Minors would not be left without any protection from exposure to patently
unsuitable material on the Internet should the challenged provisions of the CDA
be preliminarily enjoined. Vigorous enforcement of current obscenity and child
pornography laws should suffice to address the problem the government identified
in court and which concerned Congress.  When the CDA was under consideration by
Congress, the Justice Department itself communicated its view that it was not
necessary because it was prosecuting online obscenity, child pornography and
child solicitation under existing laws, and would continue to do so.(2)  It
follows that the CDA is not narrowly tailored, and the government's attempt to
defend it on that ground must fail.</P>

<P>Preliminary Injunction</P>

<P>When Congress decided that material unsuitable for minors was available on the
Internet, it could have chosen to assist and support the development of
technology that would enable parents, schools, and libraries to screen such
material from their end.  It did not do so, and thus did not follow the example
available in the print media where non-obscene but indecent and patently
offensive books and magazines abound.  Those responsible for minors undertake
the primary obligation to prevent their exposure to such material.  Instead, in
the CDA Congress chose to place on the speakers the obligation of screening the
material that would possibly offend some communities.</P>

<P>Whether Congress' decision was a wise one is not at issue here.  It was
unquestionably a decision that placed the CDA in serious conflict with our most
cherished protection - the right to choose the material to which we would have
access.</P>

<P>The government makes what I view as an extraordinary argument in its brief. It
argues that blocking technology needed for effective parental control is not yet
widespread but that it "will imminently be in place." Government's Post-hearing
Memorandum at 66.  It then states that if we uphold the CDA, it "will likely
unleash the 'creative genius' of the Internet community to find a myriad of
possible solutions."  I can imagine few arguments less likely to persuade a
court to uphold a criminal statute than one that depends on future technology to
cabin the reach of the statute within constitutional bounds.</P>

<P>The government makes yet another argument that troubles me. It suggests that the
concerns expressed by the plaintiffs and the questions posed by the court
reflect an exaggerated supposition of how it would apply the law, and that we
should, in effect, trust the Department of Justice to limit the CDA's
application in a reasonable fashion that would avoid prosecution for placing on
the Internet works of serious literary or artistic merit.  That would require a
broad trust indeed from a generation of judges not far removed from the attacks
on James Joyce's Ulysses as obscene.  See United States v. One Book Entitled
Ulysses, 72 F.2d 705 (2d Cir. 1934); see also Book Named "John Cleland's Memoirs
of a Woman of Pleasure" v. Attorney General of Mass., 383 U.S. 413 (1966).  Even
if we were to place confidence in the reasonable judgment of the representatives
of the Department of Justice who appeared before us, the Department is not a
monolithic structure, and individual U.S. Attorneys in the various districts of
the country have or appear to exercise some independence, as reflected by the
Department's tolerance of duplicative challenges in this very case.</P>

<P>But the bottom line is that the First Amendment should not be interpreted to
require us to entrust the protection it affords to the judgment of prosecutors.
Prosecutors come and go. Even federal judges are limited to life tenure. The
First Amendment remains to give protection to future generations as well.  I
have no hesitancy in concluding that it is likely that plaintiffs will prevail
on the merits of their argument that the challenged provisions of the CDA are
facially invalid under both the First and Fifth Amendments.</P>

<P>(1)It also probably covers speech protected by the First Amendment for some
minors a well, because it fails to limit its reach to that which is harmful for
minors, an issue which it is not necessary to decide in light of the other
conclusions reached.</P>

<P>Editor's Note: A three judge panel ruled that the Communications 
Decency Act of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, is 
unconstitutional.</P>


<P><B>BUCKWALTER, District Judge</B></P>


<P>A.</P>

<P>I believe that plaintiffs should prevail in this
litigation.</P>

<P>My conclusion differs in part from my original memorandum
filed in conjunction with the request for a Temporary
Restraining Order.  As part of the expedited review (per
Section 561 of the CDA), and in contrast to the limited
documentation available to me at the time of the T.R.O.
hearing, we have now gathered voluminous evidence presented
by way of sworn declarations, live testimony, demonstrative
evidence, and other exhibits.(1)  Based upon our findings
of fact derived from careful consideration of that
evidence, I now conclude that this statute is overbroad and
does not meet the strict scrutiny standard in Sable
Communications of California, Inc. v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115
(1989).</P>

<P>More specifically, I now find that current technology is
inadequate to provide a safe harbor to most speakers on the
Internet.  On this issue, I concur in Chief Judge
Sloviter's opinion.  In addition, I continue to believe
that the word "indecent" is unconstitutionally vague, and
I find that the terms "in context" and "patently offensive"
also are so vague as to violate the First and Fifth
Amendments.</P>

<P>It is, of course, correct that statutes that attempt to
regulate the content of speech presumptively violate the
First Amendment.  See e.g. R.A.V. v. City of Saint Paul,
505 U.S. 377, 381 (1992).  That is as it should be.  The
prohibition against Government's regulation of speech
cannot be set forth any clearer than in the language of the
First Amendment itself.  I suspect, however, that it may
come as a surprise to many people who have not followed the
evolution of constitutional law that, by implication at
least, the First Amendment provides that Congress shall
make no law abridging the freedom of speech unless that law
advances a compelling governmental interest.(2) Our
cherished freedom of speech does not cover as broad a
spectrum as one may have gleaned from a simple reading of
the Amendment.(3)</P>

<P>First Amendment jurisprudence has developed into a study of
intertwining standards and applications, perhaps as a
necessary response to our ever-evolving culture and modes
of communication.(4)</P>

<P>Essentially, my concerns are these:  above all, I believe
that the challenged provisions are so vague as to violate
both the First and Fifth Amendments, and in particular that
Congress' reliance on Pacifica is misplaced. In addition,
I believe that technology as it currently exists -- and it
bears repeating that we are at the preliminary injunction
phase only -- cannot provide a safe harbor for most
speakers on the Internet, thus rendering the statute
unconstitutional under a strict scrutiny analysis.  I refer
to Chief Judge Sloviter's more detailed analysis of this
issue.</P>

<P>While I believe that our findings of fact clearly show that
as yet no defense is technologically feasible, and while I
also have found the present Act to be unconstitutionally
vague, I believe it is too early in the development of this
new medium to conclude that other attempts to regulate
protected speech within the medium will fail a challenge. 
That is to say that I specifically do not find that any and
all statutory regulation of protected speech on the
Internet could not survive constitutional scrutiny.  Prior
cases have established that government regulation to
prevent access by minors to speech protected for adults,
even in media considered the vanguard of our First
Amendment protections, like print, may withstand a
constitutional challenge.  See e.g. Ginsberg v. New York,
390 U.S. 629, 635 (1968) ("'Material which is protected for
distribution to adults is not necessarily constitutionally
protected from restriction upon its dissemination to
children.'") (quoting Bookcase Inc. v. Broderick, 18 N.Y.2d
71, 75, 271 N.Y.S.2d 947, 952, 218 N.E.2d 668, 671 (1966),
appeal dismissed, sub nom Bookcase, Inc. v. Leary, 385 U.S.
12 (1966)).  It should be noted that those restrictions
that have been found constitutional were sensitive to the
unique qualities of the medium at which the restriction was
aimed.</P>


<P>B.</P>

<P>This statute, all parties agree, deals with protected
speech, the preservation of which has been extolled by
court after court in case after case as the keystone, the
bulwark, the very heart of our democracy. What is more, the
CDA attempts to regulate protected speech through criminal
sanctions, thus implicating not only the First but also the
Fifth Amendment of our Constitution.  The concept of due
process is every bit as important to our form of government
as is free speech.  If free speech is at the heart of our
democracy, then surely due process is the very lifeblood of
our body politic; for without it, democracy could not
survive.  Distilled to its essence, due process is, of
course, nothing more and nothing less than fair play.  If
our citizens cannot rely on fair play in their relationship
with their government, the stature of our government as a
shining example of democracy would be greatly diminished. 
I believe that an exacting or strict scrutiny of a statute
which attempts to criminalize protected speech requires a
word by word look at that statute to be sure that it
clearly sets forth as precisely as possible what
constitutes a violation of the statute.</P>

<P>The reason for such an examination is obvious.  If the
Government is going to intrude upon the sacred ground of
the First Amendment and tell its citizens that their
exercise of protected speech could land them in jail, the
law imposing such a penalty must clearly define the
prohibited speech not only for the potential offender but
also for the potential enforcer.  Kolender, 461 U.S. 352;
Hoffman Estates, 455 U.S. 489; Smith v. Goguen, 415 U.S.
566 (1974); Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U.S. 104
(1972); Winters v. New York, 333 U.S. 507 (1948).</P>

<P>In dealing with issues of vagueness and due process over
the years, the Supreme Court has enunciated many notable
principles.  One concern with vague laws relates to the
issue of notice.  The older cases have used phrases such as
"a statute which either forbids or requires the doing of an
act in terms so vague that men of common intelligence must
necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its
application violates the first essential of due process of
law," Connally v. General Const. Co., 269 U.S. 385, 391
(1926) (citations omitted); "it will not do to hold an
average man to the peril of indictment for the unwise
exercise of his . . . knowledge involving so many factors
of varying effect that neither the person to decide in
advance nor the jury to try him after the fact can safely
and certainly judge the result," Cline v. Frink Dairy Co.,
274 U.S. 445, 465 (1927); and "[n]o one may be required at
peril of life, liberty or property to speculate as to the
meaning of penal statutes.  All are entitled to be informed
as to what the State commands or forbids," Lanzetta v. New
Jersey, 306 U.S. 451, 453 (1939).  Second, the Court has
said that laws must provide precise standards for those who
apply them to prevent arbitrary and discriminatory
enforcement, because "[w]hen the legislature fails to
provide such minimal guidelines, a criminal statute may
permit 'a standardless sweep [that] allows policemen,
prosecutors, and juries to pursue their personal
predilections.'"  Kolender, 461 U.S. at 358 (citing Goguen,
415 U.S. at 575).  Finally, when First Amendment concerns
have been implicated, a stricter standard of examination
for vagueness is imperative.  "[T]his court has intimated
that stricter standards of permissible statutory vagueness
may be applied to a statute having a potentially inhibiting
effect on speech; a man may the less be required to act at
his peril here, because the free dissemination of ideas may
be the loser."  Smith v. California, 361 U.S. 147, 151
(1959). See also Hoffman Estates, 455 U.S. at 499
("[P]erhaps the most important factor affecting the clarity
that the Constitution demands of a law is whether it
threatens to inhibit the exercise of constitutionally
protected rights.  If, for example, the law interferes with
the right of free speech..., a more stringent vagueness
test should apply.") (citations omitted).</P>

<P>A case which sums up vagueness as it relates to due process
as succinctly as any other is Grayned v. City of Rockford. 
Here the court said:</P>

<P>It is a basic principle of due process that an enactment is
void for vagueness if its prohibitions are not clearly
defined.  Vague laws offend several important values. 
First, because we assume that man is free to steer between
lawful and unlawful conduct, we insist that laws give the
person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to
know what is prohibited, so that he may act accordingly. 
Vague laws may trap the innocent by not providing fair
warning.  Second, if arbitrary and discriminatory
enforcement is to be prevented, laws must provide explicit
standards for those who apply them.  A vague law
impermissibly delegates basic policy matters to policemen,
judges, and juries for resolution on an ad hoc and
subjective basis, with the attendant dangers of arbitrary
and discriminatory application.  Third, but related, where
a vague statute "abut[s] upon sensitive areas of basic
First Amendment freedoms," it "operates to inhibit the
exercise of [those] freedoms."  Uncertain meanings
inevitably lead citizens to "'steer far wider of the
unlawful zone' . . . than if the boundaries of the
forbidden areas were clearly marked."</P>

<P>Grayned, 408 U.S. at 108-109 (citations omitted).</P>

<P>At the same time, in considering the vagueness issue, as
the Government correctly points out, "[C]ondemned to the
use of words, we can never expect mathematical certainty
from our language." Grayned, 408 U.S. at 110.  See also
Hoffman Estates, 455 U.S. 489; Hynes v. Mayor & Council of
Oradell, 425 U.S. 610 (1976); Goguen, 415 U.S. 566.   In
addition, it will always be true that the fertile legal
"imagination can conjure hypothetical cases in which the
meaning of [disputed] terms will be in nice question." 
American Communications Assn. v. Douds, 339 U.S. 382, 412
(1950).  Thus, as I considered the vagueness issue I have
kept in mind the observation of Justice Holmes, denying a
challenge to vagueness in Nash v. United States, 229 U.S.
373 (1913). To Justice Holmes, "the law is full of
instances where a man's fate depends on his estimating
rightly, that is, as the jury subsequently estimates it,
some matter of degree.  If his judgment is wrong, not only
may he incur a fine or a short imprisonment . . ., he may
incur the penalty of death."  Nash, 229 U.S. at 377.  Even
more recently the court has stated that "due process does
not require 'impossible standards' of clarity."  Kolender,
461 U.S. at 361, (quoting United States v. Petrillo, 332
U.S. 1, 7-8 (1947)).  It is with all of these principles in
mind, as they interplay with the unique features of the
Internet, that I have reached my conclusion.</P>

<P>The fundamental constitutional principle that concerns me
is one of simple fairness, and that is absent in the CDA. 
The Government initially argues that "indecent" in this
statute is the same as "patently offensive."  I do not
agree that a facial reading of this statute supports that
conclusion.  The CDA does not define the term "indecent,"
and the FCC has not promulgated regulations defining
indecency in the medium of cyberspace.   If "indecent" and
"patently offensive" were intended to have the same
meaning, surely section (a) could have mirrored section
(d)'s language.(5)  Indecent in this statute is an
undefined word which, standing alone, offers no guidelines
whatsoever as to its parameters.  Interestingly, another
federal crime gives a definition to indecent entirely
different from that proposed in the present case.(6)  While
not applicable here, this example shows the indeterminate
nature of the word and the need for clear definition,
particularly in a statute which infringes upon protected
speech.  Although the use of different terms in Section
223(a) and (d) suggests that Congress intended that the
terms have different meanings, the Conference Report
indicates an intention to treat Section 223(a) as
containing the same language as Section 223(d).  Conf. Rep.
at 188-89 ("The conferees intend that the term indecency...
has the same meaning as established in FCC v. Pacifica
Foundation, 438 U.S. 726 (1978) and [Sable] and "New
section 223(d)(1) codifies the definition of indecency from
[Pacifica] . . . . The precise contours of the definition
of indecency have varied . . . .  The essence of the phrase
-- patently offensive descriptions of sexual and excretory
activities -- has remained constant, however."). 
Therefore, I will acknowledge that the term indecency is
"reasonably susceptible" to the definition offered in the
Conference Report and might therefore adopt such a
narrowing construction if it would thereby preserve the
constitutionality of the statute.  See Virginia v. American
Booksellers Association, 484 U.S. 383, 397 (1988); 
Erznoznik v. City of Jacksonville, 422 U.S. 205 (1975).
Accepting these terms as synonymous, however, provides no
greater help to a speaker attempting to comply with the
CDA.  Contrary to the Government's suggestion, Pacifica
does not answer the question of whether the terms pass
constitutional muster in the present case.  In Pacifica,
the Court did not consider a vagueness challenge to the
term "indecent," but considered only whether the Government
had the authority to regulate the particular broadcast at
issue -- George Carlin's Monologue entitled "Filthy Words." 
In finding in the affirmative, the Court emphasized that
its narrow holding applied only to broadcasting, which is
"uniquely accessible to children, even those too young to
read."  438 U.S. at 749.  Thus, while the Court sanctioned
the FCC's time restrictions on a radio program that
repeatedly used vulgar language, the Supreme Court did not
hold that use of the term "indecent" in a statute applied
to other media, particularly a criminal statute, would be
on safe constitutional ground.</P>

<P>The Supreme Court more recently had occasion to consider a
statute banning "indecent" material in the dial-a-porn
context in Sable, 492 U.S. 115, and found that a complete
ban on such programming violated the First Amendment
because it was not narrowly tailored to serve the purpose
of limiting children's access to commercial pornographic
telephone messages.  Once again, the Court did not consider
a challenge to the term "indecent" on vagueness grounds,
and indeed has never directly ruled on this issue.</P>

<P>Several other courts have, however, upheld the use of the
term in statutes regulating different media.  For example,
in Information Providers' Coalition v. FCC, 928 F.2d 866
(9th Cir. 1991), the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals
considered whether the term "indecent" in the 1989
Amendment to the Communications Act regulating access to
telephone dial-a-porn services and the FCC's implementing
regulations was void for vagueness.  The FCC had defined
"indecent" as "the description or depiction of sexual or
excretory activities or organs in a patently offensive
manner as measured by contemporary community standards for
the telephone medium."  928 F.2d at 874.  Although
recognizing that the Supreme Court had never explicitly
ruled on a vagueness challenge to the term, the court read
Sable and Pacifica as having implicitly accepted the use of
this definition of "indecent."  The court further stated
that the FCC's definition of "indecent" was no less
imprecise than was the definition of "obscenity" as
announced in Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 25 (1973),
and thus concluded that "indecent" as pertained to
dial-a-porn regulations must survive a vagueness challenge.
See also Dial Information Services v. Thornburgh, 938 F.2d
1535 (2d Cir. 1991), (upholding the use of "indecent" in
the same amendment to the Communications Act and FCC
regulations.); Action for Children's Television v. FCC, 932
F.2d 1504, 1508 (D.C.Cir. 1991) (rejecting vagueness
challenge to "indecency" provision in broadcast television
regulations).(7)</P>

<P>Notably, however, in these telephone and cable television
cases the FCC had defined indecent as patently offensive by
reference to contemporary community standards for that
particular medium.  See, e.g., Pacifica, 438 U.S. at 732
(defining "indecent" by reference to terms "patently
offensive as measured by contemporary community standards
for the broadcast medium"); Dial Information Services, 938
F.2d at 1540 (defining indecency by reference to
contemporary community standards for the telephone medium).
Here, the provision is not so limited.  In fact, there is
no effort to conform the restricting terms to the medium of
cyberspace, as is required under Pacifica and its progeny.</P>

<P>The Government attempts to save the "indecency" and
"patently offensive" provisions by claiming that the
provisions would only be used to prosecute pornographic
works which, when considered "in context" as the statute
requires, would be considered "indecent" or "patently
offensive" in any community.  The Government thus contends
that plaintiffs' fears of prosecution for publishing
material about matters of health, art, literature or civil
liberties are exaggerated and unjustified.  The
Government's argument raises two issues:  first is the
question of which "community standards" apply in
cyberspace, under the CDA; and second is the proposition
that citizens should simply rely upon prosecutors to apply
the statute constitutionally.</P>

<P>Are the contemporary community standards to be applied
those of the vast world of cyberspace, in accordance with
the Act's apparent intent to establish a uniform national
standard of content regulation?  The Government offered no
evidence of any such national standard or nationwide
consensus as to what would be considered "patently
offensive".  On the contrary, in supporting the use of the
term "indecent" in the CDA, the Government suggests that,
in part, this term was chosen as a means of insulating
children from material not restricted under current
obscenity laws.  This additional term is necessary, the
Government states, because "whether something rises to the
level of obscene is a legal conclusion that, by definition,
may vary from community to community."  Govt. Brief at 31. 
In support of its argument, the Government points to the
Second Circuit's decision in United States v. Various
Articles of Obscene Merchandise, Schedule No. 2102, 709
F.2d 132, 134, 137 (2d Cir. 1983), which upheld the
district court's conclusion that "detailed portrayals of
genitalia, sexual intercourse, fellatio, and masturbation"
including the film "Deep Throat" and other pornographic
films and magazines, are not obscene in light of the
community standards prevailing in New York City."  What
this argument indicates is that as interpretations of
obscenity ebb and flow throughout various communities,
restrictions on indecent material are meant to cover a
greater or lesser quantity of material not reached by each
community's obscenity standard.  It follows that to do
this, what constitutes indecency must be as open to
fluctuation as the obscenity standard and cannot be rigidly
constructed as a single national standard if it is meant to
function as the Government has suggested.  As Justice
Scalia stated, "[t]he more narrow the understanding of what
is 'obscene,' . . . the more pornographic what is embraced
within the residual category of 'indecency.'"  Sable, 492
U.S. at 132 (Scalia, J. concurring).  This understanding is
consistent with the case law, in which the Supreme Court
has explained that the relevant community is the one where
the information is accessed and where the local jury sits.
See Sable, 492 U.S. at 125; Hamling v. United States, 418
U.S. 87 (1974); Miller, 413 U.S. at 30 ("[O]ur nation is
simply too big and too diverse for this Court to reasonably
expect that such standards [of what is patently offensive]
could be articulated for all 50 states in a single
formulation.").  However, the Conference Report with regard
to the CDA states that the Act is "intended to establish a
uniform national standard of content regulation."  Conf.
Rep. at 191.  This conflict inevitably leaves the reader of
the CDA unable to discern the relevant "community
standard," and will undoubtedly cause Internet users to
"steer far wider of the unlawful zone" than if the
community standard to be applied were clearly defined.  The
chilling effect on the Internet users' exercise of free
speech is obvious.  See Baggett v. Bullitt, 377 U.S. 360,
372 (1964).  This is precisely the vice of vagueness.</P>

<P>In addition, the Government's argument that the challenged
provisions will be applied only to "pornographic"
materials, and will not be applied to works with serious
value is without support in the CDA itself.  Unlike in the
obscenity context, indecency has not been defined to
exclude works of serious literary, artistic, political or
scientific value, and therefore the Government's suggestion
that it will not be used to prosecute publishers of such
material is without foundation in the law itself.  The
Government's claim that the work must be considered
patently offensive "in context" does nothing to clarify the
provision, for it fails to explain which context is
relevant.  "Context" may refer to, among other things, the
nature of the communication as a whole, the time of day it
was conveyed, the medium used, the identity of the speaker,
or whether or not it is accompanied by appropriate
warnings.  See e.g., Pacifica, 438 U.S. at 741 n.16, n.17
(referring to "the context of the whole book," and to the
unique interpretation of the First Amendment "in the
broadcasting context").</P>

<P>The thrust of the Government's argument is that the court
should trust prosecutors to prosecute only a small segment
of those speakers subject to the CDA's restrictions, and
whose works would reasonably be considered "patently
offensive" in every community.  Such unfettered discretion
to prosecutors, however, is precisely what due process does
not allow.  "It will not do to say that a prosecutor's
sense of fairness and the Constitution would prevent a
successful . . . prosecution for some of the activities
seemingly embraced within the sweeping statutory
definitions.  The hazard of being prosecuted...
nevertheless remains . . . .  Well-intentioned prosecutors
and judicial safeguards do not neutralize the vice of a
vague law."  Baggett, 377 U.S. at 373-74; see also
Keyishian v. Board of Regents, 385 U.S. 589, 599
(1967)("[i]t is no answer" to a vague law for the
Government "to say that the statute would not be applied in
such a case.").  And we cannot overlook the vagaries of
politics.  What may be, figuratively speaking, one
administration's pen may be another's sword.</P>

<P>The evidence and arguments presented by the Government
illustrate the possibility of arbitrary enforcement of the
Act.  For example, one Government expert opined that any of
the so-called "seven dirty words" used in the Carlin
monologue would be subject to the CDA and therefore should
be "tagged," as should paintings of nudes displayed on a
museum's web site.  The Government has suggested in its
brief, however, that the Act should not be so applied. See
Govt. Brief at 37 (suggesting that "seven dirty words" if
used "in the context of serious discussions" would not be
subject to the Act).  Even Government counsel was unable to
define "indecency" with specificity.  The Justice
Department attorney could not respond to numerous questions
from the court regarding whether, for example, artistic
photographs of a nude man with an erect penis, depictions
of Indian statues portraying different methods of
copulation, or the transcript of a scene from a
contemporary play about AIDS could be considered "indecent"
under the Act.</P>

<P>Plaintiffs also argue that section 223(e)(5)(A) of the CDA,
offering a defense for speakers who take "good faith,
reasonable, effective and appropriate actions under the
circumstances to restrict or prevent access by minors to a
communication" covered by the Act, is unconstitutionally
vague because it fails to specify what would constitute an
effective defense to prosecution.  The plain language of
the safe harbor provision indicates an effort to ensure
that the statute limits speech in the least restrictive
means possible by taking into account emerging technologies
in allowing for any and all "reasonable, effective and
appropriate" approaches to restricting minors' access to
the proscribed material.  But, the statute itself does not
contain any description of what, other than credit card
verification and adult identification codes -- which we
have established remain unavailable to most content
providers -- will protect a speaker from prosecution. 
Significantly, although the FCC is authorized to specify
measures that might satisfy this defense, the FCC's views
will not be definitive but will only "be admitted as
evidence of good faith efforts" that the defendant has met
the requirements of the defense.  47 U.S.C. Section
223(e)(6).  Thus, individuals attempting to comply with the
statute presently have no clear indication of what actions
will ensure that they will be insulated from criminal
sanctions under the CDA.</P>


<P>C.</P>

<P>The consequences of posting indecent content are severe.(8) 
I recognize that people must make judgments each and every
day, many times in the most intimate of relationships and
that an error in judgment can have serious consequences. 
It is also true that where those consequences involve penal
sanctions, a criminal law or statute has more often than
not carefully defined the proscribed conduct.  It is not so
much that the accused needs these precise definitions, as
it has been said he or she rarely reads the law in advance.
What is more important is that the enforcer of statutes
must be guided by clear and precise standards.  In statutes
that break into relatively new areas, such as this one, the
need for definition of terms is greater, because even
commonly understood terms may have different connotations
or parameters in this new context.(9)   Words cannot define
conduct with mathematical certainty, and lawyers, like the
bright and intelligent ones now before us, will most
certainly continue to devise ways by which to challenge
them.  This rationale, however, can neither support a
finding of constitutionality nor relieve legislators from
the very difficult task of carefully drafting legislation
tailored to its goal and sensitive to the unique
characteristics of, in this instance, cyberspace.</P>

<P>(1)If by virtue of the statute's authorization of expedited
review of its constitutionality, "on its face," 47 U.S.C.
Section561(a), we were strictly limited to looking at the
words of the statute, I would stand by my T.R.O. opinion. 
However, in light of the procedures which are required by
47 U.S.C. Section 561(a) and 28 U.S.C. Section 2284, and
were followed by this court in establishing an extensive
record in this case, to ignore the evidence presented would
be to ignore what an action for injunctive relief is all
about.</P>

<P>Section 561 reads as follows:</P>

<P>Section 561.  EXPEDITED REVIEW.</P>

<P>(a) THREE-JUDGE DISTRICT COURT HEARING -- Notwithstanding
any other provision of law, any civil action challenging
the constitutionality, on its face, of this title or any
amendment made by this title, or any provision thereof,
shall be heard by a district court of 3 judges convened
pursuant to the provisions of section 2284 of title 28,
United States Code. Section 2284 states, in relevant part:</P>

<P>Section 2284.  Three-judge court; when required;
composition; procedure</P>

<P>(b) In any action required to be heard and determined by a
district court of three judges under subsection (a) of this
section, the composition and procedure of the court shall
be as follows:  . . .</P>

<P>(3) A single judge may conduct all proceedings except the
trial . . . . He may grant a temporary restraining order on
a specific finding, based on evidence submitted, that
specified irreparable damages will result if the order is
not granted, which order, unless previously revoked by the
district judge, shall remain in force only until the
hearing and determination by the district court of three
judges of an application for a preliminary injunction....</P>

<P>(2)Justice Kennedy argues in his opinion in Simon &
Schuster v. New York Crime Victims Bd., 502 U.S. 105, 120
(1991), that "[t]he regulated content has the full
protection of the First Amendment and this, I submit, is
itself a full and sufficient reason for holding the statute
unconstitutional.  In my view it is both unnecessary and
incorrect to ask whether the state can show that the
statute 'is necessary to serve a compelling state interest
and is narrowly drawn to achieve that end.'"  In the
present case, there is no disagreement that indecent and
patently offensive speech have the full protection of the
First Amendment.</P>

<P>(3)Not only has speech been divided up and given values --
with some types of speech given little or no protection
(obscenity, fighting words, possibly commercial speech) --
but also, by court decisions over the years, it has been
decided that the content of speech can indeed be regulated
provided that the regulation will directly and materially
advance a compelling government interest, and that it is
narrowly tailored to accomplish that interest in the least
restrictive manner.  However, any content-based restriction
must survive this most exacting scrutiny.  Sable, 492 U.S.
115; Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397 (1989).</P>

<P>(4)The plaintiffs have made facial challenges to the
disputed provisions of the CDA on grounds of both vagueness
and overbreadth.  The approach taken and language used in
evaluating a statute under each of these doctrines
commingles, and frequently is treated as a single approach. 
"We have traditionally viewed vagueness and overbreadth as
logically related and similar doctrines."  Kolender v.
Lawson, 461 U.S. 352, 358 n.8 (1983) (citing Keyishian v.
Board of Regents, 385 U.S. 589, 609, (1967); NAACP v.
Button, 371 U.S. 415, 433 (1963)). Even in cases where the
court attempts to distinguish these two doctrines, it
acknowledges some interplay between them.  See e.g. Village
of Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., 455
U.S. 489, 494, and n. 6 (1982).</P>

<P>In addition, when discussing overbreadth, one cannot avoid
reference to the same language used to describe and apply
the strict scrutiny standard to constitutionally protected
activities.  See e.g. Sable, 492 U.S. at 131; Roberts v.
Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609, 623 (1984).  While there are
occasional attempts to argue for clear distinctions among
these doctrines, see e.g. Kolender, 461 U.S. at 369 (White,
J., Rehnquist, J. dissenting), such bright lines simply
have not been, and most likely cannot be, drawn in this
area.</P>

<P>(5)Comparing a different portion of each of these two
provisions suggests that different terms are not to be read
to mean the same thing.  As written, section (a) pertains
to telecommunications devices, and section (d) to
interactive computer services.  While we have not entirely
resolved the tension between these definitions at this
stage, it has been established that these terms are not
synonymous, but are in fact intended to denote different
technologies.  This, together with the rule of statutory
construction set forth in Chief Judge Sloviter's opinion,
seems to suggest on the face of the statute that indecent
and patently offensive also are not to be read as
synonymous.</P>

<P>(6)18 U.S.C. Section1461 states, "The term 'indecent' as
used in this section includes matter of a character tending
to incite arson, murder or assassination."</P>

<P>(7)Although the Supreme Court may rule on the vagueness
question in the context of cable television regulation in
Alliance for Community Media v. FCC, 56 F.3d 105 (D.C. Cir.
1995), currently pending on certiorari before the Court, we
will not defer adjudication of this issue as the
constitutionality of the term in the cable context may not
be determinative of its use in cyberspace.</P>

<P>(8)Each intentional act of posting indecent content for
display shall be considered a separate violation of this
subsection and carries with it a fine, a prison term of up
to two years, or both.  47 U.S.C. Section 223(a),(d) and
Conf. Rep. at 189.</P>

<P>(9)As I have noted, the unique nature of the medium cannot
be overemphasized in discussing and determining the
vagueness issue.  This is not to suggest that new
technology should drive constitutional law.  To the
contrary, I remain of the belief that our fundamental
constitutional principles can accommodate any technological
achievements, even those which, presently seem to many to
be in the nature of a miracle such as the Internet.</P>

<P>Editor's Note: A three judge panel ruled that the Communications 
Decency Act of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, is 
unconstitutional.</P>


<P><H3>DALZELL, District Judge
</H3></P>

<P><B>A. Introduction</B></P>

<P>I begin with first principles:  As a general rule, the
Constitution forbids the Government from silencing speakers
because of their particular message. R.A.V. v. City of
Saint Paul, 112 S. Ct. 2538, 2542 (1992).  "Our political
system and cultural life rest upon this ideal."  Turner
Broadcasting Sys. v. FCC, 114 S. Ct. 2445, 2458 (1994). 
This general rule is subject only to "narrow and
well-understood exceptions".  Id.  A law that, as here,
regulates speech on the basis of its content, is
"presumptively invalid". R.A.V., 112 S. Ct. at 2542.</P>

<P>Two of the exceptions to this general rule deal with
obscenity (commonly understood to include so-called
hardcore pornography), Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15
(1973), and child pornography, New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S.
747 (1982). The Government can and does punish with
criminal sanction people who engage in these forms of
speech.  18 U.S.C. Sections 1464-65 (criminalizing obscene
material); id. Sections 2251-52 (criminalizing child
pornography).  Indeed, the Government could punish these
forms of speech on the Internet even without the CDA. 
E.g., United States v. Thomas, 74 F.3d 701, 704-05 (6th
Cir. 1995) (affirming obscenity convictions for the
operation of a computer bulletin board).</P>

<P>The Government could also completely ban obscenity and
child pornography from the Internet.  No Internet speaker
has a right to engage in these forms of speech, and no
Internet listener has a right to receive them.  Child
pornography and obscenity have "no constitutional
protection, and the government may ban [them] outright in
certain media, or in all."  Alliance for Community Media v.
FCC, 56 F.3d 105, 112 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (citing R.A.V., 112
S. Ct. at 2545), cert. granted sub nom. Denver Area Educ.
Telecommunications Consortium, 116 S. Ct. 471 (1996); see
also Ferber, 458 U.S. at 756.  As R.A.V. notes, "'the
freedom of speech' referred to by the First Amendment does
not include a freedom to disregard these traditional
limitations."  R.A.V., 112 S. Ct. at 2543.</P>

<P>The cases before us, however, are not about obscenity or
child pornography. Plaintiffs in these actions claim no
right to engage in these forms of speech in the future, nor
does the Government intimate that plaintiffs have engaged
in these forms of speech in the past.</P>

<P>This case is about "indecency", as that word has come to be
understood since the Supreme Court's decisions in FCC v.
Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S. 726 (1976), and Sable
Communications v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115 (1989).  The legal
difficulties in these actions arise because of the special
place that indecency occupies in the Supreme Court's First
Amendment jurisprudence.  While adults have a First
Amendment right to engage in indecent speech, Sable, 492
U.S. at 126; see also Pacifica, 438 U.S. at 747-48, the
Supreme Court has also held that the Government may,
consistent with the Constitution, regulate indecency on
radio and television, and in the "dial-a-porn" context, as
long as the regulation does not operate as a complete ban. 
Thus, any regulation of indecency in these areas must give
adults access to indecent speech, which is their right.</P>

<P>The Government may only regulate indecent speech for a
compelling reason, and in the least restrictive manner. 
Sable, 492 U.S. at 126.  "It is not enough to show that the
Government's ends are compelling; the means must be
carefully tailored to achieve those ends."  Id.  This "most
exacting scrutiny", Turner, 114 S. Ct. at 2459, requires
the Government to "demonstrate that the recited harms are
real, not merely conjectural, and that the regulation will
in fact alleviate these harms in a direct and material
way."  United States v. National Treasury Employees Union,
115 S. Ct. 1003, 1017 (1995) (citing Turner, 114 S. Ct. at
1017).  Thus, although our analysis here must balance ends
and means, the scales tip at the outset in plaintiffs'
favor.  This is so because "[r]egulations which permit the
Government to discriminate on the basis of the content of
the message cannot be tolerated under the First Amendment." 
Simon & Schuster, Inc. v. Members of the New York State
Crime Victims Board, 502 U.S. 105, 116 (1991) (citation
omitted).</P>

<P>The Government argues that this case is really about
pornography on the Internet.  Apart from hardcore and child
pornography, however, the word pornography does not have a
fixed legal meaning.  When I use the word pornography in my
analysis below, I refer to for-profit purveyors of sexually
explicit, "adult" material similar to that at issue in
Sable.  See 492 U.S. at 118.  Pornography is normally
either obscene or indecent, as Justice Scalia noted in his
concurrence in Sable.  Id. at 132.  I would avoid using
such an imprecise (and overbroad) word, but I feel
compelled to do so here, since Congress undoubtedly had
such material in mind when it passed the CDA.  See S. Rep.
No. 230, 104th Cong., 2d Sess. 187-91 (1996), reprinted in
1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. 10, 200-05 [hereinafter Senate Report]. 
Moreover, the Government has defended the Act before this
court by arguing that the Act could be constitutionally
applied to such material.</P>

<P>Plaintiffs have, as noted, moved for a preliminary
injunction.  The standards for such relief are
well-settled.  Plaintiffs seeking preliminary injunctive
relief must show (1) "[a] reasonable probability of
eventual success in the litigation" and (2) "irreparabl[e]
injur[y] pendente lite" if relief is not granted.  Acierno
v. New Castle County, 40 F.2d 645, 653 (3d Cir. 1994).  We
must also consider, if appropriate, (3) "the possibility of
harm to other interested persons from the grant or denial
of the injunction", and (4) "the public interest".  Id.;
see also Opticians Ass'n v. Independent Opticians, 920 F.2d
187, 192 (3d Cir. 1990).</P>

<P>In a First Amendment challenge, a plaintiff who meets the
first prong of the test for a preliminary injunction will
almost certainly meet the second, since irreparable injury
normally arises out of the deprivation of speech rights,
"for even minimal periods of time".  Elrod v. Burns, 427
U.S. 347, 373-74 (1976); Hohe v. Casey, 868 F.2d 69, 72 (3d
Cir.), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 848 (1989).  Of course,
neither the Government nor the public generally can claim
an interest in the enforcement of an unconstitutional law. 
Thus, I focus my legal analysis today primarily on whether
plaintiffs have shown a likelihood of success on their
claim that the CDA is unconstitutional.  The issues of
irreparable harm to plaintiffs, harm to third parties, and
the public interest all flow from that determination.(1)</P>

<P>Plaintiffs' challenge here is a "facial" one.  A law that
regulates the content of speech is facially invalid if it
does not pass the "most exacting scrutiny" that we have
described above, or if it would "penalize a substantial
amount of speech that is constitutionally protected".
Forsyth County v. Nationalist Movement, 112 S. Ct. 2395,
2401 (1992).  This is so even if some applications would be
"constitutionally unobjectionable".  Id.; see also National
Treasury Employees Union v. United States, 990 F.2d 1271,
1279-80 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (Randolph, J., concurring), aff'd,
115 S. Ct. 1003 (1995).  Sometimes facial challenges
require an inquiry into a party's "standing" (i.e., whether
a party may properly challenge a law as facially invalid). 
See, e.g., Ferber, 458 U.S. at 767-79.  At other times a
facial challenge requires only an inquiry into the law's
reach.  See, e.g., R.A.V., 112 S. Ct. at 2547.(2)  As I
describe it in part C below, I have no question that
plaintiffs here have standing to challenge the validity of
the CDA, and, indeed, the Government has not seriously
challenged plaintiffs' standing to do so.  See, e.g.,
Virginia v. American Booksellers Assoc., 484 U.S. 383, 392
(1988).  Thus, the focus is squarely on the merits of
plaintiffs' facial challenge.(3)</P>

<P>I divide my legal analysis below into three parts.  In Part
B, I examine the traditional definition of indecency and
relate it to the provisions of the CDA at issue in this
action.  From this analysis I conclude that Section 223(a)
and Section 223(d) of the CDA reach the same kind of
speech.  My analysis also convinces me that plaintiffs are
unlikely to succeed in their claim that the CDA is
unconstitutionally vague.  In Part C, I address the
Government's argument that plaintiffs are not the CDA's
target, nor would they likely face prosecution under the
Act.  Here, I conclude that plaintiffs could reasonably
fear prosecution under the Act, even if some of their fears
border on the farfetched.  In Part D, I consider the legal
implications of the special attributes of Internet
communication, as well as the effect that the CDA would
have on these attributes.  In this Part I conclude that the
disruptive effect of the CDA on Internet communication, as
well as the CDA's broad reach into protected speech, not
only render the Act unconstitutional but also would render
unconstitutional any regulation of protected speech on this
new medium.</P>


<P><H4>B.  Defining Indecency</H4></P>

<P>Although no court of appeals has ever to my knowledge
upheld a vagueness challenge to the meaning of "indecency",
several recent cases have grappled with the elusive meaning
of that word in the context of cable television and
"dial-a-porn".  Alliance for Community Media v. FCC, 56
F.3d 105 (D.C. Cir. 1995), cert. granted, 116 S. Ct. 471
(1996); Dial Information Serv. Corp. v. Thornburgh, 938
F.2d 1535 (2d Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 1072
(1992); Information Providers Coalition for Defense of the
First Amendment v. FCC, 928 F.2d 866 (9th Cir. 1991).</P>

<P>In Alliance for Community Media, 56 F.3d at 123-25, for
example, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals
addressed prohibitions on indecent programming on certain
cable television channels.  That court noted that the FCC
has codified the meaning of "'indecent' programming" on
cable television as "programming that describes or depicts
sexual or excretory activities or organs in a patently
offensive manner as measured by contemporary community
standards for the cable medium."  Id. at 112 (citing what
is now 47 C.F.R. Section 76.701(g)).</P>

<P>The FCC took a similar approach to the definition of
"indecency" in the "dial-a-porn" medium.(4)  In Dial
Information Services, 938 F.2d at 1540, the Second Circuit
quoted the FCC's definition of indecent telephone
communications in that context:</P>

<P>[I]n the dial-a-porn context, we believe it is appropriate
to define indecency as the description or depiction of
sexual or excretory activities or organs in a patently
offensive manner as measured by contemporary community
standards for the telephone medium.</P>

<P>Id. at 1540 (citation omitted); see also Information
Providers' Coalition for Defense of the First Amendment v.
FCC, 928 F.2d 866, 876 (9th Cir. 1991).</P>

<P>These three cases recognize that the FCC did not define
"indecency" for cable and dial-a-porn in a vacuum.  Rather,
it borrowed from the Supreme Court's decision in FCC v.
Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S. 726 (1978).  In that case
(which I describe in greater detail below), the Supreme
Court established the rough outline from which the FCC
fashioned its three-part definition.  For the first two
parts of the test, the Supreme Court emphasized the
"importance of context" in examining arguably indecent
material.  Id. at 747 n.25.  "Context" in the Pacifica
opinion includes consideration of both the particular
medium from which the material originates and the
particular community that receives the material.  Id. at
746 (assuming that the Carlin monologue "would be protected
in other contexts"); id. at 748-51 (discussing the
attributes of broadcast); see also Information Providers'
Coalition, 928 F.2d at 876 (discussing the "content/context
dichotomy").  Second, the opinion limits its discussion to
"patently offensive sexual and excretory language",
Pacifica, 438 U.S. at 747, and this type of content has
remained the FCC's touchstone.  See, e.g., Alliance for
Community Media, 56 F.3d at 112.(5)</P>

<P>We have quoted from the CDA extensively above and I will
only briefly rehearse that discussion here.  Section 223(a)
of the CDA criminalizes "indecent" speech on the Internet. 
This is the "indecency" provision.  Section 223(d) of the
CDA addresses speech that, "in context, depicts or
describes, in terms patently offensive as measured by
contemporary community standards, sexual or excretory
activities or organs".  This is the "patently offensive"
provision.  The foregoing discussion leads me to conclude
that these two provisions describe the same kind of speech. 
That is, the use of "indecent" in Section 223(a) is
shorthand for the longer description in Section 223(d).
Conversely, the longer description in Section 223(d) is
itself the definition of "indecent" speech.  I believe
Congress could have used the word "indecent" in both
Section 223(a) and Section 223(d), or it could have used
the "patently offensive" description of Section 223(d) in
Section 223(a), without a change in the meaning of the Act. 
I do not believe that Congress intended that this
distinction alone would change the reach of either section
of the CDA.(6)</P>

<P>The CDA's legislative history confirms this conclusion. 
There, the conference committee explicitly noted that
Section 223(d) "codifies the definition of indecency from
FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S. 726 (1978)....  The
conferees intend that the term indecency (and the rendition
of the definition of that term in new section 502) has the
same meaning as established in FCC v. Pacifica Foundation,
438 U.S. 726 (1978) and Sable Communications of California,
Inc. v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115 (1989)."  Senate Report at 188,
reprinted in 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 201-02.  The legislative
history makes clear that Congress did not intend to create
a distinction in meaning when it used the generic term
"indecency" in Section 223(a) and the definition of that
term in Section 223(d).(7)</P>

<P>There is no doubt that the CDA requires the most stringent
review for vagueness, since it is a criminal statute that
"threatens to inhibit the exercise of constitutionally
protected rights".  Colautti v. Franklin, 439 U.S 379, 391
(1979); see also Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S. 352, 358 n.8
(1983); Grayned, 408 U.S. at 108-09.  My analysis here
nevertheless leads ineluctably to the conclusion that the
definition of indecency is not unconstitutionally vague. 
The Miller definition of obscenity has survived such
challenges, see, e.g., Hamling v. United States, 418 U.S.
87, 118-19 (1974); Fort Wayne Books, Inc. v. Indiana, 489
U.S. 46, 57 (1989), and the definition of indecency
contains a subset of the elements of obscenity.  If the
Miller test "give[s] the person of ordinary intelligence a
reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited, so that
he may act accordingly", Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408
U.S. 104, 108 (1972), the omission of parts of that test
does not warrant a contrary conclusion.  See Dial
Information Services, 938 F.2d at 1541-42. Similarly, since
the definition of indecency arose from the Supreme Court
itself in Pacifica, we may fairly imply that the Court did
not believe its own interpretation to invite "arbitrary and
discriminatory enforcement" or "abut upon sensitive areas
of basic First Amendment freedoms". Grayned, 408 U.S. at
108-109 (citations and alterations omitted).  Sable, while
not explicitly addressing the issue of vagueness,
reinforces this conclusion. See Information Providers'
Coalition, 928 F.2d at 875-76 (citing Sable, 492 U.S. at
126-27).  It follows, then, that plaintiffs' vagueness
challenge is not likely to succeed on the merits and does
not support preliminary injunctive relief.</P>

<P>The possible interpretations of the defenses in Section
223(e) do not alter this conclusion.  As a matter of
statutory construction, Section 223(e)(5)(B) could not be
clearer.  This section, which imports the dial-a-porn
defenses into the CDA, creates "specific and objective"
methods to avoid liability. See Roberts v. United States
Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609, 629 (1984).  Section 223(e)(5)(A) is
more suspect, since it arguably "fail[s] to describe with
sufficient particularity what a suspect must do in order to
satisfy" it. Kolender 461 U.S. at 361.(8)  Yet even though
the defenses in both sections are unavailable to many
Internet users, their unavailability does not render the
liability provisions vague.  Rather, their unavailability
just transforms Section 223(a) and Section 223(d) into a
total ban, in violation of Butler v. Michigan, 352 U.S.
380, 383 (1957), and Sable, 492 U.S. at 127, 131.  I am
sensitive to plaintiffs' arguments that the statute, as
written, does not create safe harbors through which all
Internet users may shield themselves from liability.
Transcript of May 10, 1996, at 37-38.  Here again, however,
the absence of safe harbors relates to the (over)breadth of
a statute, and not its vagueness.  See Sable, 492 U.S. at
127, 131.</P>


<P><H4>C.  Plaintiffs' Likelihood of Prosecution Under the Act</H4></P>

<P>The Government has consistently argued that the speech of
many of the plaintiffs here is almost certainly not
indecent.  They point, for example, to the educational and
political content of plaintiffs' speech, and they also
suggest that the occasional curse word in a card catalogue
will probably not result in prosecution.  See Senate Report
at 189, reprinted in 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 203 ("Material
with serious redeeming value is quite obviously intended to
edify and educate, not to offend.").  In this section I
address that argument.</P>

<P>I agree with the Government that some of plaintiffs' claims
are somewhat exaggerated, but hyperbolic claims do not in
themselves weigh in the Government's favor.  In recent
First Amendment challenges, the Supreme Court has itself
paid close attention to extreme applications of
content-based laws.</P>

<P>In Simon & Schuster, Inc. v. Members of the New York State
Crimes Victim Board, 502 U.S. 105 (1991), the Court
addressed the constitutionality of a law that required
criminals to turn over to their victims any income derived
from books, movies, or other commercial exploitation of
their crimes.  Id. at 504-05.  In its opinion, the Court
evaluated the argument of an amicus curiae that the law's
reach could include books such as The Autobiography of
Malcolm X, Civil Disobedience, and Confessions of Saint
Augustine, and authors such as Emma Goldman, Martin Luther
King, Jr., Sir Walter Raleigh, Jesse Jackson, and Bertrand
Russell.  Id. at 121-22.  The Court credited the argument
even while recognizing that it was laced with "hyperbole":</P>

<P>The argument that [the] statute . . . would prevent
publication of all of these works is hyperbole -- some
would have been written without compensation -- but the...
law clearly reaches a wide range of literature that
does not enable a criminal to profit from his crime while
a victim remains uncompensated.</P>

<P>Id. at 122.  If a content-based law "can produce such an
outcome", id. at 123 (emphasis added), then Simon &
Schuster allows us to consider those outcomes in our
analysis.</P>

<P>Even more recently, in United States v. National Treasury
Employees Union, 115 S. Ct. 1003 (1995), the Court
addressed the constitutionality of a law that banned
federal employees from accepting honoraria for publications
unrelated to their work.  Id. at 1008.  The Court noted
that the law would reach "literary giants like Nathaniel
Hawthorne and Herman Melville, . . . Walt Whitman, . . .
and Bret Harte".  Id. at 1012.  This concern resurfaced
later in the opinion, see id. at 1015 ("[W]e cannot ignore
the risk that [the ban] might deprive us of the work of a
future Melville or Hawthorne."), even though a footnote
immediately renders this concern at least hyperbolic:</P>

<P>These authors' familiar masterworks would survive the
honoraria ban as currently administered.  Besides exempting
all books, the [regulations implementing the ban] protect
fiction and poetry from the ban's coverage, although the
statute's language is not so clear.  But some great artists
deal in fact as well as fiction, and some deal in both.</P>

<P>Id. n.16 (citations omitted).</P>

<P>Here, even though it is perhaps unlikely that the Carnegie
Library will ever stand in the dock for putting its card
catalogue online, or that the Government will hale the ACLU
into court for its online quiz of the seven dirty words, we
cannot ignore that the Act could reach these activities. 
The definition of indecency, like the definition of
obscenity, is not a rigid formula.  Rather, it confers a
large degree of autonomy to individual communities to set
the bounds of decency for themselves.  Cf. Sable, 492 U.S.
at 125-26.  This is as it should be, since this flexibility
recognizes that ours is a country with diverse cultural and
historical roots.  See, e.g., Hamling, 418 U.S. at 104 ("A
juror is entitled to draw on his own knowledge of the views
of the average person in the community or vicinage from
which he comes for making the required determination, just
as he is entitled to draw on his knowledge of the
propensities of a 'reasonable' person in other areas of the
law.").</P>

<P>Putting aside hyperbolic application, I also have little
doubt that some communities could well consider plaintiffs'
speech indecent, and these plaintiffs could -- perhaps
should -- have a legitimate fear of prosecution.  In Action
for Children's Television v. FCC, 58 F.3d 654 (D.C. Cir.
1995), the District of Columbia Court of Appeals summarized
three broadcasts that the FCC found indecent in the late
1980s:</P>

<P>The offending morning broadcast . . . contained "explicit
references to masturbation, ejaculation, breast size, penis
size, sexual intercourse, nudity, urination, oral-genital
contact, erections, sodomy, bestiality, menstruation and
testicles."  The remaining two were similarly
objectionable.</P>

<P>Id. at 657 (citing In re Infinity Broadcasting Corp., 3 FCC
R. 930, 932 (1987)).  In Infinity Broadcasting, one of the
broadcasts that the FCC found indecent was an excerpt of a
play about AIDS, finding that the excerpts "contained the
concentrated and repeated use of vulgar and shocking
language to portray graphic and lewd depictions of
excretion, anal intercourse, ejaculation, masturbation, and
oral-genital sex".  3 FCC R. at 934.(9)  To the FCC, even
broadcasts with "public value . . . addressing the serious
problems posed by AIDS" can be indecent if "that material
is presented in a manner that is patently offensive".  Id.
(emphasis in original).(10)</P>

<P>Yet, this is precisely the kind of speech that occurs, for
example, on Critical Path AIDS Project's Web site, which
includes safer sex instructions written in street language
for easy comprehension.  The Web site also describes the
risk of HIV transmission for particular sexual practices. 
The FCC's implication in In the Matter of King Broadcasting
Co., 5 FCC R. 2971 (1990), that a "candid discussion[] of
sexual topics" on television was decent in part because it
was "not presented in a pandering, titillating or vulgar
manner" would be unavailing to Critical Path, other
plaintiffs, and some amici.  These organizations want to
pander and titillate on their Web sites, at least to a
degree, to attract a teen audience and deliver their
message in an engaging and coherent way.(11)</P>

<P>In In re letter to Merrell Hansen, 6 FCC R. 3689 (1990),
the FCC found indecent a morning discussion between two
announcers regarding Jim Bakker's alleged rape of Jessica
Hahn.  Id.  Here, too, the FCC recognized that the
broadcast had public value.  Id. (noting that the broadcast
concerned "an incident that was at the time 'in the
news'").  Yet, under the FCC's interpretation of Pacifica,
"the merit of a work is 'simply one of the many variables'
that make up a work's context".  Id. (citation omitted).</P>

<P>One of the plaintiffs here, Stop Prisoner Rape, Inc., has
as its core purpose the issue of prison rape.  The
organization creates chat rooms in which members can
discuss their experiences.  Some amici have also organized
Web sites dedicated to survivors of rape, incest, and other
sexual abuse.  These Web sites provide fora for the
discussion and contemplation of shared experiences.  The
operators of these sites, and their participants, could
legitimately fear prosecution under the CDA.</P>

<P>With respect to vulgarity, the Government is in a similarly
weak position. In Pacifica, the Supreme Court held that
multiple repetition of expletives could be indecent. 
Pacifica, 438 U.S. at 750.  Although the FCC did not follow
this rationale with respect to a broadcast of "a bona fide
news story" on National Public Radio, Letter to Mr. Peter
Branton, 6 FCC R. 610 (1991), aff'd on other grounds sub
nom. Branton v. FCC, 993 F.2d 906, 908 (D.C. Cir. 1993),
the ACLU, a plaintiff here, could take little comfort from
that administrative decision.  It would need to discern,
for example, whether a chat room that it organized to
discuss the meaning of the word fuck was more like the
Carlin monologue or more like a National Public Radio
broadcast.(12)  Plaintiffs' expert would have found
expletives indecent in a community consisting only of
himself,(13) and his views undoubtedly -- and reasonably --
reflect the view of many people.</P>

<P>In sum, I am less confident than the Government that
societal mores have changed so drastically since Pacifica
that an online equivalent of the Carlin monologue, or the
Carlin monologue itself online, would pass muster under the
CDA.  Under existing precedent, plaintiffs' fear of
prosecution under the Act is legitimate, even though they
are not the pornographers Congress had in mind when it
passed the CDA.(14)   Cf. City of Houston v. Hill, 482 U.S.
451, 459 (1987). My discussion of the effect and reach of
the CDA, therefore, applies both to plaintiffs' hyperbolic
concerns and to their very real ones.</P>


<P><H4>D.  A Medium-Specific Analysis</H4></P>

<P>The Internet is a new medium of mass communication.(15)  As
such, the Supreme Court's First Amendment jurisprudence
compels us to consider the special qualities of this new
medium in determining whether the CDA is a constitutional
exercise of governmental power.  Relying on these special
qualities, which we have described at length in our
Findings of fact above, I conclude that the CDA is
unconstitutional and that the First Amendment denies
Congress the power to regulate protected speech on the
Internet.  This analysis and conclusions are consistent
with Congress's intent to avoid tortuous and piecemeal
review of the CDA by authorizing expedited, direct review
in the Supreme Court "as a matter of right" of
interlocutory, and not merely final, orders upholding
facial challenges to the Act.  See Section 561(b) of the
Telecommunications Act of 1996.(16)</P>


<P>1.  The Differential Treatment of Mass Communication Media</P>

<P>Nearly fifty years ago, Justice Jackson recognized that
"[t]he moving picture screen, the radio, the newspaper, the
handbill, the sound truck and the street corner orator have
differing natures, values, abuses and dangers.  Each... is
a law unto itself".  Kovacs v. Cooper, 336 U.S. 77, 97
(1949) (Jackson, J., concurring).  The Supreme Court has
expressed this sentiment time and again since that date,
and differential treatment of the mass media has become
established First Amendment doctrine.  See, e.g., Turner
Broadcasting Sys., Inc. v. FCC, 114 S. Ct. 2445, 2456
(1994) ("It is true that our cases have permitted more
intrusive regulation of broadcast speakers than of speakers
in other media."); Pacifica, 438 U.S. at 748 ("We have long
recognized that each medium of expression presents special
First Amendment problems."); City of Los Angeles v.
Preferred Communications, Inc., 476 U.S. 488, 496 (1974)
("Different communications media are treated differently
for First Amendment purposes.") (Blackmun, J., concurring);
Metromedia, Inc. v. City of San Diego, 453 U.S. 490, 500-01
(1981) (plurality opinion) ("This Court has often faced the
problem of applying the broad principles of the First
Amendment to unique forums of expression.").  Thus, the
Supreme Court has established different rules for print,
Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo, 418 U.S. 241
(1974), broadcast radio and television, see, e.g., Red Lion
Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U.S. 367 (1969), cable
television, Turner, 114 S. Ct. at 2456-57, and even
billboards, Metromedia, 453 U.S. at 501, and drive-in movie
theaters, Erzoznik v. City of Jacksonville, 422 U.S. 205
(1975).</P>

<P>This medium-specific approach to mass communication
examines the underlying technology of the communication to
find the proper fit between First Amendment values and
competing interests.  In print media, for example, the
proper fit generally forbids governmental regulation of
content, however minimal. Tornillo, 418 U.S. at 258.  In
other media (billboards, for example), the proper fit may
allow for some regulation of both content and of the
underlying technology (such as it is) of the communication. 
Metromedia, 453 U.S. at 502.</P>

<P>Radio and television broadcasting present the most
expansive approach to medium-specific regulation of mass
communication.  As a result of the scarcity of band widths
on the electromagnetic spectrum, the Government holds broad
authority both to parcel out the frequencies and to
prohibit others from speaking on the same frequency:</P>

<P>As a general matter, there are more would-be broadcasters
than frequencies available in the electromagnetic spectrum. 
And if two broadcasters were to attempt to transmit over
the same frequency in the same locale, they would interfere
with one another's signals, so that neither could be heard
at all. The scarcity of broadcast frequencies thus required
the establishment of some regulatory mechanism to divide
the electromagnetic spectrum and assign specific
frequencies to particular broadcasters.</P>

<P>Turner, 114 S. Ct. at 2456 (citing FCC v. League of Women
Voters, 468 U.S. 364 (1984)).</P>

<P>This scarcity also allows the Government to regulate
content even after it assigns a license:</P>

<P>In addition, the inherent physical limitation on the number
of speakers who may use the broadcast medium has been
thought to require some adjustment in traditional First
Amendment analysis to permit the Government to place
limited content restraints, and impose certain affirmative
obligations, on broadcast licensees.</P>

<P>Id. at 2457 (citing Red Lion, 395 U.S. at 390-95; National
Broadcasting Co. v. United States, 319 U.S. 190 (1943)).</P>

<P>The broadcasting cases firmly establish that the Government
may force a licensee to offer content to the public that
the licensee would otherwise not offer, thereby assuring
that radio and television audiences have a diversity of
content.  In broadcasting, "[i]t is the right of the public
to receive suitable access to social, political, esthetic,
moral, and other ideas and experiences which is crucial". 
Red Lion, 395 U.S. at 390; see also CBS, Inc. v. FCC, 453
U.S. 367, 395 (1981) ("A licensed broadcaster is 'granted
the free and exclusive use of a limited and valuable part
of the public domain; when he accepts that franchise it is
burdened by enforceable public obligations.'") (citation
omitted); Columbia Broadcasting Sys., Inc. v. Democratic
Nat'l Comm., 412 U.S. 94, 110-11 (1973).  These content
restrictions include punishing licensees who broadcast
inappropriate but protected speech at an impermissible
time.  Pacifica, 438 U.S. at 750-51.</P>

<P>In this case, the Government relies on the Pacifica
decision in arguing that the CDA is a constitutional
exercise of governmental power.  Since the CDA regulates
indecent speech, and since Pacifica authorizes governmental
regulation of indecent speech (so the Government's argument
goes), it must follow that the CDA is a valid exercise of
governmental power.  That argument, however, ignores
Pacifica's roots as a decision addressing the proper fit
between broadcasting and the First Amendment.  The argument
also assumes that what is good for broadcasting is good for
the Internet.</P>


<P>2.  The Scope of the Pacifica Decision</P>

<P>In FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S. 726 (1978), the
Supreme Court first decided whether the Government had the
power to regulate indecent speech.  Id. at 729.  In
Pacifica, a radio listener complained about the broadcast
of George Carlin's "Filthy Words" monologue at 2:00 p.m. on
a Tuesday afternoon.  Id. at 729-30.  The Carlin monologue
was replete with "the words you couldn't say on the public...
airwaves . . . , ever", and the listener had tuned in
while driving with his young son in New York.  Id.  The FCC
issued a declaratory order, holding that it could have
subjected the Pacifica Foundation (owner of the radio
station) to an administrative sanction.  Id. at 730.  In
its order the FCC also described the standards that it
would use in the future to regulate indecency in the
broadcast medium.  Id. at 731.  The Supreme Court upheld
the FCC's decision and confirmed the power of that agency
to regulate indecent speech.  Id. at 750-51.</P>

<P>The rationale of Pacifica rested on three overlapping
considerations. First, using as its example the Carlin
monologue before it, the Court weighed the value of
indecent speech and concluded that such speech "lie[s] at
the periphery of First Amendment concerns."  Id. at 743. 
Although the Court recognized that the FCC had threatened
to punish Pacifica based on the content of the Carlin
monologue, id. at 742, it found that the punishment would
have been permissible because four-letter words "offend for
the same reasons that obscenity offends."  Id. at 746
(footnote omitted).  The Court then described the place of
four-letter words "in the hierarchy of first amendment
values":</P>

<P>Such utterances are no essential part of any exposition of
ideas, and are of such slight social value as a step to
truth that any benefit that may be derived from them is
clearly outweighed by the social interest in order and
morality.</P>

<P>Id. at 746 (citing Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U.S.
568, 572 (1942)).</P>

<P>Second, the Court recognized that "broadcasting . . . has
received the most limited First Amendment protection."  Id.
at 748.  The Government may regulate broadcast consistent
with the Constitution, even though the same regulation
would run afoul of the First Amendment in the print medium. 
Id. (comparing Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U.S.
367 (1969) with Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo,
418 U.S. 241 (1974)).  This is so because broadcasting has
a "uniquely pervasive presence in the lives of all
Americans" and "is uniquely accessible to children, even
those too young to read."  Pacifica, 438 U.S. at 748-49.</P>

<P>Third, the Court found the FCC's sanction -- an
administrative sanction -- to be an appropriate means of
regulating indecent speech.  At the outset of the opinion,
the Court disclaimed that its holding was a "consider[ation
of] any question relating to the possible application of
Section 1464 as a criminal statute."  Id. at 739 n.13. 
Later in the opinion, the Court "emphasize[d] the
narrowness of [its] holding", and explicitly recognized
that it had not held that the Carlin monologue would
justify a criminal prosecution.  Id. at 750.  Instead, the
Court allowed the FCC to regulate indecent speech with
administrative penalties under a "nuisance" rationale --
"like a pig in the parlor instead of the barnyard."  Id. at
750 (citation omitted).</P>

<P>Time has not been kind to the Pacifica decision.  Later
cases have eroded its reach, and the Supreme Court has
repeatedly instructed against overreading the rationale of
its holding.</P>

<P>First, in Bolger v. Young Drug Products Corp., 463 U.S. 60
(1983), the Supreme Court refused to extend Pacifica to a
law unrelated to broadcasting.  In that case, a federal law
prohibited the unsolicited mailing of contraceptive
advertisements.  Id. at 61.  The Government defended the
law by claiming an interest in protecting children from the
advertisements.  The Court rejected this argument as
overbroad:</P>

<P>In [Pacifica], this Court did recognize that the
Government's interest in protecting the young justified
special treatment of an afternoon broadcast heard by adults
as well as children.  At the same time, the majority
"emphasize[d] the narrowness of our holding", explaining
that broadcasting is "uniquely pervasive" and that it is
"uniquely accessible to children, even those too young to
read."  The receipt of mail is far less intrusive and
uncontrollable.  Our decisions have recognized that the
special interest of the Federal Government in regulation of
the broadcast media does not readily translate into a
justification for regulation of other means of
communication.</P>

<P>Id. at 74 (citations and footnotes omitted) (emphasis in
original) see also id. at 72 ("[T]he 'short, though
regular, journey from mail box to trash can . . . is an
acceptable burden, at least so far as the Constitution is
concerned.'") (citation omitted) (alterations in original).</P>

<P>Second, in Sable Communications v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115
(1989), the Supreme Court again limited Pacifica.  In that
case, the Court considered the validity of a ban on
indecent "dial-a-porn" communications.  Id. at 117-18.(17) 
As in Bolger, the Government argued that Pacifica justified
a complete ban of that form of speech.  The Supreme Court
disagreed, holding instead that Pacifica's "emphatically
narrow" holding arose out of the "unique attributes of
broadcasting".  Id. at 127.  The Court held that the ban
was unconstitutional.  Id. at 131.</P>

<P>Sable narrowed Pacifica in two ways.  First, the Court
implicitly rejected Pacifica's nuisance rationale for
dial-a-porn, holding instead that the Government could only
regulate the medium "by narrowly drawn regulations designed
to serve those interests without unnecessarily interfering
with First Amendment freedoms".  Id. at 126 (citation
omitted).  Under this strict scrutiny, "[i]t is not enough
to show that the Government's ends are compelling; the
means must be carefully tailored to achieve those ends."
Id.; see also Fabulous Assoc. v. Pennsylvania Pub. Util.
Comm., 896 F.2d 780, 784-85 (3d Cir. 1990).</P>

<P>Second, the Court concluded that the law, like a law it had
struck down in 1957, "denied adults their free speech
rights by allowing them to read only what was acceptable
for children".  Sable, 492 U.S. at 126 (citing Butler v.
Michigan, 352 U.S. 380 (1957)).  Thus, any regulation of
dial-a-porn would have to give adults the opportunity to
partake of that medium.  Id.  This conclusion echoes
Bolger.  See Bolger, 463 U.S. at 74 ("The level of
discourse reaching a mailbox simply cannot be limited to
that which would be suitable for a sandbox.").(18)</P>

<P>Finally, in Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 114 S.
Ct. 2445 (1994), the Supreme Court implicitly limited
Pacifica once again when it declined to adopt the broadcast
rationale for the medium of cable television.  The Court
concluded that the rules for broadcast were "inapt" for
cable because of the "fundamental technological differences
between broadcast and cable transmission".  Id. at 2457.</P>

<P>The legal significance to this case of Turner's refusal to
apply the broadcast rules to cable television cannot be
overstated.  Turner's holding confirms beyond doubt that
the holding in Pacifica arose out of the scarcity rationale
unique to the underlying technology of broadcasting, and
not out of the end product that the viewer watches.  That
is, cable television has no less of a "uniquely pervasive
presence" than broadcast television, nor is cable
television more "uniquely accessible to children" than
broadcast.  See Pacifica, 438 U.S. at 748-49.  From the
viewer's perspective, cable and broadcast television are
identical:  moving pictures with sound from a box in the
home.  Whether one receives a signal through an antenna or
through a dedicated wire, the end result is just television
in either case.  In declining to extend broadcast's
scarcity rationale for cable, the Supreme Court also
implicitly limited Pacifica, the holding of which flows
directly from that rationale.(19)</P>

<P>Turner thus confirms that the analysis of a particular
medium of mass communication must focus on the underlying
technology that brings the information to the user.  In
broadcast, courts focus on the limited number of band
widths and the risk of interference with those frequencies. 
See, e.g., Turner, 114 S. Ct. at 2456-57.  In cable, courts
focus on the number of channels, the different kinds of
cable operators, and the cost to the consumer. Id. at 2452.</P>

<P>I draw two conclusions from the foregoing analysis.  First,
from the Supreme Court's many decisions regulating
different media differently, I conclude that we cannot
simply assume that the Government has the power to regulate
protected speech over the Internet, devoting our attention
solely to the issue of whether the CDA is a constitutional
exercise of that power.  Rather, we must also decide the
validity of the underlying assumption as well, to wit,
whether the Government has the power to regulate protected
speech at all.  That decision must take into account the
underlying technology, and the actual and potential reach,
of that medium.  Second, I conclude that Pacifica's holding
is not persuasive authority here, since plaintiffs and the
Government agree that Internet communication is an abundant
and growing resource.  Nor is Sable persuasive authority,
since the Supreme Court's holding in that case addressed
only one particular type of communication (dial-a-porn),
and reached no conclusions about the proper fit between the
First Amendment and telephone communications generally. 
Again, plaintiffs and the Government here agree that the
Internet provides content as broad as the imagination.</P>


<P>3.  The Effect of the CDA and the Novel Characteristics of
Internet Communication</P>

<P>Over the course of five days of hearings and many hundreds
of pages of declarations, deposition transcripts, and
exhibits, we have learned about the special attributes of
Internet communication.  Our Findings of fact -- many of
them undisputed -- express our understanding of the
Internet.  These Findings lead to the conclusion that
Congress may not regulate indecency on the Internet at all.</P>

<P>Four related characteristics of Internet communication have
a transcendent importance to our shared holding that the
CDA is unconstitutional on its face. We explain these
characteristics in our Findings of fact above, and I only
rehearse them briefly here.  First, the Internet presents
very low barriers to entry.  Second, these barriers to
entry are identical for both speakers and listeners. 
Third, as a result of these low barriers, astoundingly
diverse content is available on the Internet.  Fourth, the
Internet provides significant access to all who wish to
speak in the medium, and even creates a relative parity
among speakers.</P>

<P>To understand how disruptive the CDA is to Internet
communication, it must be remembered that the Internet
evolved free of content-based considerations. Before the
CDA, it only mattered how, and how quickly, a particular
packet of data travelled from one point on the Internet to
another.  In its earliest incarnation as the ARPANET, the
Internet was for many years a private means of access among
the military, defense contractors, and defense-related
researchers.  The developers of  the technology focused on
creating a medium designed for the rapid transmittal of the
information through overlapping and redundant connections,
and without direct human involvement.  Out of these
considerations evolved the common transfer protocols,
packet switching, and the other technology in which today's
Internet users flourish.  The content of the data was,
before the CDA, an irrelevant consideration.</P>

<P>It is fair, then, to conclude that the benefits of the
Internet to private speakers arose out of the serendipitous
development of its underlying technology.  As more networks
joined the "network of networks" that is the Internet,
private speakers have begun to take advantage of the
medium.  This should not be surprising, since participation
in the medium requires only that networks (and the
individual users associated with them) agree to use the
common data transfer protocols and other medium-specific
technology.  Participation does not require, and has never
required, approval of a user's or network's content.</P>

<P>After the CDA, however, the content of a user's speech will
determine the extent of participation in the new medium. 
If a speaker's content is even arguably indecent in some
communities, he must assess, inter alia, the risk of
prosecution and the cost of compliance with the CDA. 
Because the creation and posting of a Web site allows users
anywhere in the country to see that site, many speakers
will no doubt censor their speech so that it is palatable
in every community.  Other speakers will decline to enter
the medium at all.  Unlike other media, there is no
technologically feasible way for an Internet speaker to
limit the geographical scope of his speech (even if he
wanted to), or to "implement[] a system for screening the
locale of incoming" requests.  Sable 492 U.S. at 125.</P>

<P>The CDA will, without doubt, undermine the substantive,
speech-enhancing benefits that have flowed from the
Internet. Barriers to entry to those speakers affected by
the Act would skyrocket, especially for non-commercial and
not-for-profit information providers.  Such costs include
those attributable to age or credit card verification (if
possible), tagging (if tagging is even a defense under the
Act(20)), and monitoring or review of one's content.</P>

<P>The diversity of the content will necessarily diminish as
a result.  The economic costs associated with compliance
with the Act will drive from the Internet speakers whose
content falls within the zone of possible prosecution. Many
Web sites, newsgroups, and chat rooms will shut down, since
users cannot discern the age of other participants.  In
this respect, the Internet would ultimately come to mirror
broadcasting and print, with messages tailored to a
mainstream society from speakers who could be sure that
their message was likely decent in every community in the
country.</P>

<P>The CDA will also skew the relative parity among speakers
that currently exists on the Internet.  Commercial entities
who can afford the costs of verification, or who would
charge a user to enter their sites, or whose content has
mass appeal, will remain unaffected by the Act.  Other
users, such as Critical Path or Stop Prisoner Rape, or even
the ACLU, whose Web sites before the CDA were as equally
accessible as the most popular Web sites, will be
profoundly affected by the Act.  This change would result
in an Internet that mirrors broadcasting and print, where
economic power has become relatively coterminous with
influence.</P>

<P>Perversely, commercial pornographers would remain
relatively unaffected by the Act, since we learned that
most of them already use credit card or adult verification
anyway.  Commercial pornographers normally provide a few
free pictures to entice a user into proceeding further into
the Web site.  To proceed beyond these teasers, users must
provide a credit card number or adult verification number. 
The CDA will force these businesses to remove the teasers
(or cover the most salacious content with cgi scripts), but
the core, commercial product of these businesses will
remain in place.</P>

<P>The CDA's wholesale disruption on the Internet will
necessarily affect adult participation in the medium.  As
some speakers leave or refuse to enter the medium, and
others bowdlerize their speech or erect the barriers that
the Act envisions, and still others remove bulletin boards,
Web sites, and newsgroups, adults will face a shrinking
ability to participate in the medium.  Since much of the
communication on the Internet is participatory, i.e., is a
form of dialogue, a decrease in the number of speakers,
speech fora, and permissible topics will diminish the
worldwide dialogue that is the strength and signal
achievement of the medium.</P>

<P>It is no answer to say that the defenses and exclusions of
Section 223(e) mitigate the disruptive forces of the Act. 
We have already found as facts that the defenses either are
not available to plaintiffs here or would impose excessive
costs on them.  These defenses are also unavailable to
participants in specific forms of Internet communication.</P>

<P>I am equally dubious that the exclusions of Section 223(e)
would provide significant relief from the Act.  The "common
carrier" exclusion of Section 223(e)(1), for example, would
not insulate America Online from liability for the content
it provides to its subscribers.  It is also a tricky
question whether an America Online chat room devoted to,
say, women's reproductive health, is or is not speech of
the service itself, since America Online, at least to some
extent, "creat[es] the content of the communication" simply
by making the room available and assigning it a topic. 
Even if America Online has no liability under this example,
the service might legitimately choose not to provide fora
that led to the prosecution of its subscribers.  Similarly,
it is unclear whether many caching servers are devoted
"solely" to the task of "intermediate storage".  The
"vicarious liability" exclusion of Section 223(e)(4) would
not, for example, insulate either a college professor or
her employer from liability for posting an indecent online
reading assignment for her freshman sociology class.</P>

<P>We must of course give appropriate deference to the
legislative judgments of Congress.  See Sable, 492 U.S. at
129; Turner, 114 S. Ct. at 2472-73 (Blackmun, J.,
concurring).  After hearing the parties' testimony and
reviewing the exhibits, declarations, and transcripts, we
simply cannot in my view defer to Congress's judgment that
the CDA will have only a minimal impact on the technology
of the Internet, or on adult participation in the medium. 
As in Sable, "[d]eference to a legislative finding cannot
limit judicial inquiry when First Amendment rights are at
stake."  Sable, 492 U.S. at 129 (citation omitted). 
Indeed, the Government has not revealed Congress's
"extensive record" in addressing this issue, Turner, 114 S.
Ct. at 2472 (Blackmun, J., concurring), or otherwise
convinced me that the record here is somehow factually
deficient to the record before Congress when it passed the
Act.</P>


<P>4.  Diversity and Access on the Internet</P>

<P>Nearly eighty years ago, Justice Holmes, in dissent, wrote
of the ultimate constitutional importance of the "free
trade in ideas":</P>

<P>[W]hen men have realized that time has upset many fighting
faiths, they may come to believe even more than they
believe the very foundations of their own conduct that the
ultimate good desired is better reached by free trade in
ideas -- that the best test of truth is the power of the
thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the
market . . . .</P>

<P>Abrams v. United States, 250 U.S. 616, 630 (1919) (Holmes,
J., dissenting).</P>

<P>For nearly as long, critics have attacked this
much-maligned "marketplace" theory of First Amendment
jurisprudence as inconsistent with economic and practical
reality.  Most marketplaces of mass speech, they charge,
are dominated by a few wealthy voices.  Miami Herald
Publishing Co. v. Tornillo, 418 U.S. 241, 248-50 (1974). 
These voices dominate -- and to an extent, create -- the
national debate.  Id.  Individual citizens' participation
is, for the most part, passive.  Id. at 251.  Because most
people lack the money and time to buy a broadcast station
or create a newspaper, they are limited to the role of
listeners, i.e., as watchers of television or subscribers
to newspapers.  Id.</P>

<P>Economic realities limit the number of speakers even
further.  Newspapers competing with each other and with
(free) broadcast tend toward extinction, as fixed costs
drive competitors either to consolidate or leave the
marketplace. Id. at 249-50.  As a result, people receive
information from relatively few sources:</P>

<P>The elimination of competing newspapers in most of our
large cities, and the concentration of control of media
that results from the only newspaper's being owned by the
same interests which own a television station and a radio
station, are important components of this trend toward
concentration of control of outlets to inform the public.</P>

<P>The result of these vast changes has been to place in a few
hands the power to inform the American people and shape
public opinion.</P>

<P>Id. at 249.</P>

<P>The Supreme Court has also recognized that the advent of
cable television has not offered significant relief from
this problem.  Although the number of cable channels is
exponentially greater than broadcast, Turner, 114 S. Ct. at
2452, cable imposes relatively high entry costs, id. at
2451-52 (noting that the creation of a cable system
requires "[t]he construction of [a] physical
infrastructure").</P>

<P>Nevertheless, the Supreme Court has resisted governmental
efforts to alleviate these market dysfunctions.  In
Tornillo, the Supreme Court held that market failure simply
could not justify the regulation of print, 418 U.S. at 258,
regardless of the validity of the criticisms of that
medium, id. at 251. Tornillo invalidated a state
"right-of-reply" statute, which required a newspaper
critical of a political candidate to give that candidate
equal time to reply to the charges.  Id. at 244.  The Court
held that the statute would be invalid even if it imposed
no cost on a newspaper, because of the statute's intrusion
into editorial discretion:</P>

<P>A newspaper is more than a passive receptacle or conduit
for news, comment, and advertising.  The choice of material
to go into a newspaper, and the decisions made as to
limitations on the size and content of the paper, and
treatment of public issues and public officials -- whether
fair or unfair -- constitute the exercise of editorial
control and judgment.</P>

<P>Id. at 258.</P>

<P>Similarly, in Turner, the Supreme Court rejected the
Government's argument that market dysfunction justified
deferential review of speech regulations for cable
television.  Even recognizing that the cable market
"suffers certain structural impediments", Turner, 114 S.
Ct. at 2457, the Court could not accept the Government's
conclusion that this dysfunction justified broadcast-type
standards of review, since "the mere assertion of
dysfunction or failure in a speech market, without more, is
not sufficient to shield a speech regulation from the First
Amendment standards applicable to nonbroadcast media."  Id.
at 2458.  "[L]aws that single out the press, or certain
elements thereof, for special treatment 'pose a particular
danger of abuse by the State,' and so are always subject to
at least some degree of heightened First Amendment
scrutiny."  Id. (citation omitted).(21)  The Court then
eloquently reiterated that government-imposed,
content-based speech regulations are generally inconsistent
with "[o]ur political system and cultural life":</P>

<P>At the heart of the First Amendment lies the principle that
each person should decide for him or herself the ideas and
beliefs deserving of expression, consideration, and
adherence.  Our political system and cultural life rest
upon this ideal.  Government action that stifles speech on
account of its message, or that requires the utterance of
a particular message favored by the Government, contravenes
this essential right.  Laws of this sort pose the inherent
risk that the Government seeks not to advance a legitimate
regulatory goal, but to suppress unpopular ideas or
information or manipulate the public debate through
coercion rather than persuasion.  These restrictions
"rais[e] the specter that the Government may effectively
drive certain ideas or viewpoints from the marketplace."</P>

<P>Id. (citation omitted).</P>

<P>Both Tornillo and Turner recognize, in essence, that the
cure for market dysfunction (government-imposed,
content-based speech restrictions) will almost always be
worse than the disease.  Here, however, I am hard-pressed
even to identify the disease.  It is no exaggeration to
conclude that the Internet has achieved, and continues to
achieve, the most participatory marketplace of mass speech
that this country -- and indeed the world -- has yet seen. 
The plaintiffs in these actions correctly describe the
"democratizing" effects of Internet communication: 
individual citizens of limited means can speak to a
worldwide audience on issues of concern to them. 
Federalists and Anti-Federalists may debate the structure
of their government nightly, but these debates occur in
newsgroups or chat rooms rather than in pamphlets. 
Modern-day Luthers still post their theses, but to
electronic bulletin boards rather than the door of the
Wittenberg Schlosskirche.  More mundane (but from a
constitutional perspective, equally important) dialogue
occurs between aspiring artists, or French cooks, or dog
lovers, or fly fishermen.</P>

<P>Indeed, the Government's asserted "failure" of the Internet
rests on the implicit premise that too much speech occurs
in that medium, and that speech there is too available to
the participants.  This is exactly the benefit of Internet
communication, however.  The Government, therefore,
implicitly asks this court to limit both the amount of
speech on the Internet and the availability of that speech. 
This argument is profoundly repugnant to First Amendment
principles.</P>

<P>My examination of the special characteristics of Internet
communication, and review of the Supreme Court's
medium-specific First Amendment jurisprudence, lead me to
conclude that the Internet deserves the broadest possible
protection from government-imposed, content-based
regulation.  If "the First Amendment erects a virtually
insurmountable barrier between government and the print
media", Tornillo, 418 U.S. at 259 (White, J., concurring),
even though the print medium fails to achieve the hoped-for
diversity in the marketplace of ideas, then that
"insurmountable barrier" must also exist for a medium that
succeeds in achieving that diversity.  If our Constitution
"prefer[s] 'the power of reason as applied through public
discussion'", id. (citation omitted), "[r]egardless of how
beneficent-sounding the purposes of controlling the press
might be", id., even though "occasionally debate on vital
matters will not be comprehensive and . . . all viewpoints
may not be expressed", id. at 260, a medium that does
capture comprehensive debate and does allow for the
expression of all viewpoints should receive at least the
same protection from intrusion.</P>

<P>Finally, if the goal of our First Amendment jurisprudence
is the "individual dignity and choice" that arises from
"putting the decision as to what views shall be voiced
largely into the hands of each of us", Leathers v. Medlock,
499 U.S. 439, 448-49 (1991) (citing Cohen v. California,
403 U.S. 15, 24 (1971)), then we should be especially
vigilant in preventing content-based regulation of a medium
that every minute allows individual citizens actually to
make those decisions.  Any content-based regulation of the
Internet, no matter how benign the purpose, could burn the
global village to roast the pig.  Cf. Butler, 352 U.S. at
383.</P>


<P>5.  Protection of Children from Pornography</P>

<P>I accept without reservation that the Government has a
compelling interest in protecting children from
pornography.  The proposition finds one of its clearest
expressions in Mill, who recognized that his exposition
regarding liberty itself "is meant to apply only to human
beings in the maturity of  their faculties":</P>

<P>We are not speaking of children or of young persons below
the age which the law may fix as that of manhood or
womanhood.  Those who are still in a state to require being
taken care of by others must be protected against their own
actions as well as against external injury.</P>

<P>John Stuart Mill, On Liberty 69 (Gertrude Himmelfarb ed.,
Penguin Books 1982) (1859), cited in Harry Kalven Jr., A
Worthy Tradition 54 (Jamie Kalven ed. 1988).</P>

<P>This rationale, however, is as dangerous as it is
compelling.  Laws regulating speech for the protection of
children have no limiting principle, and a well-intentioned
law restricting protected speech on the basis of its
content is, nevertheless, state-sponsored censorship. 
Regulations that "drive certain ideas or viewpoints from
the marketplace" for children's benefit, Simon & Schuster,
502 U.S. at 116, risk destroying the very "political system
and cultural life", Turner, 114 S. Ct. at 2458, that they
will inherit when they come of age.</P>

<P>I therefore have no doubt that a Newspaper Decency Act,
passed because Congress discovered that young girls had
read a front page article in the New York Times on female
genital mutilation in Africa, would be unconstitutional.
Tornillo, 418 U.S. at 258.  Nor would a Novel Decency Act,
adopted after legislators had seen too many pot-boilers in
convenience store book racks, pass constitutional muster. 
Butler, 352 U.S. at 383.  There is no question that a
Village Green Decency Act, the fruit of a Senator's
overhearing of a ribald conversation between two adolescent
boys on a park bench, would be unconstitutional.  Perry
Education Ass'n v. Perry Local Educators' Ass'n, 460 U.S.
37, 45 (1983).  A Postal Decency Act, passed because of
constituent complaints about unsolicited lingerie
catalogues, would also be unconstitutional.  Bolger, 463
U.S. at 73.  In these forms of communication, regulations
on the basis of decency simply would not survive First
Amendment scrutiny.</P>

<P>The Internet is a far more speech-enhancing medium than
print, the village green, or the mails.  Because it would
necessarily affect the Internet itself, the CDA would
necessarily reduce the speech available for adults on the
medium. This is a constitutionally intolerable result.</P>

<P>Some of the dialogue on the Internet surely tests the
limits of conventional discourse.  Speech on the Internet
can be unfiltered, unpolished, and unconventional, even
emotionally charged, sexually explicit, and vulgar -- in a
word, "indecent" in many communities.  But we should expect
such speech to occur in a medium in which citizens from all
walks of life have a voice.  We should also protect the
autonomy that such a medium confers to ordinary people as
well as media magnates.</P>

<P>Moreover, the CDA will almost certainly fail to accomplish
the Government's interest in shielding children from
pornography on the Internet.  Nearly half of Internet
communications originate outside the United States, and
some percentage of that figure represents pornography. 
Pornography from, say, Amsterdam will be no less appealing
to a child on the Internet than pornography from New York
City, and residents of Amsterdam have little incentive to
comply with the CDA.(22)</P>

<P>My analysis does not deprive the Government of all means of
protecting children from the dangers of Internet
communication.  The Government can continue to protect
children from pornography on the Internet through vigorous
enforcement of existing laws criminalizing obscenity and
child pornography.  See United States v. Thomas, 74 F.3d
701, 704-05 (6th Cir. 1995).  As we learned at the hearing,
there is also a compelling need for public education about
the benefits and dangers of this new medium, and the
Government can fill that role as well.  In my view, our
action today should only mean that the Government's
permissible supervision of Internet content stops at the
traditional line of unprotected speech.</P>

<P>Parents, too, have options available to them.  As we
learned at the hearing, parents can install blocking
software on their home computers, or they can subscribe to
commercial online services that provide parental controls. 
It is quite clear that powerful market forces are at work
to expand parental options to deal with these legitimate
concerns.  More fundamentally, parents can supervise their
children's use of the Internet or deny their children the
opportunity to participate in the medium until they reach
an appropriate age. See Fabulous, 896 F.2d at 788-89
(noting that "our society has traditionally placed" these
decisions "on the shoulders of the parent").</P>


<P><H4>E.  Conclusion
</H4>
Cutting through the acronyms and argot that littered the
hearing testimony, the Internet may fairly be regarded as
a never-ending worldwide conversation. The Government may
not, through the CDA, interrupt that conversation.  As the
most participatory form of mass speech yet developed, the
Internet deserves the highest protection from governmental
intrusion.</P>

<P>True it is that many find some of the speech on the
Internet to be offensive, and amid the din of cyberspace
many hear discordant voices that they regard as indecent. 
The absence of governmental regulation of Internet content
has unquestionably produced a kind of chaos, but as one of
plaintiffs' experts put it with such resonance at the
hearing:</P>

<P>What achieved success was the very chaos that the Internet
is.  The strength of the Internet is that chaos.(23)</P>

<P>Just as the strength of the Internet is chaos, so the
strength of our liberty depends upon the chaos and
cacophony of the unfettered speech the First Amendment
protects.</P>

<P>For these reasons, I without hesitation hold that the CDA
is unconstitutional on its face.</P>



<P><H3>ENDNOTES</H3></P>

<P><font size=-1></P>

<P>(1)By Order dated March 13, 1996, we asked the parties to
submit their views on questions regarding allocation of the
burdens of proof in these cases.  Since I believe that the
outcome of these cases is clear regardless of the
allocation of proof between the parties, none of my
conclusions in this opinion requires me to choose between
the arguments that the parties have presented to us.</P>

<P>(2)Although I do not believe the statue is
unconstitutionally vague, I agree with Judge Buckwalter
that the Government's promise not to enforce the plain
reach of the law cannot salvage its overbreadth.  Even
accepting the Government's argument that prosecution of
non-obscene pornography would be a "legitimate application"
of the CDA, City of Houston v. Hill, 482 U.S. 451, 459
(1987), it is clear that the Act would "make unlawful a
substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct",
id.  As in Hill, the Government's circular reasoning --
that the law is constitutional because prosecutors would
only apply it to those against whom it could
constitutionally be applied -- must fail.  See id. at
464-67.</P>

<P>(3)Plaintiffs have argued that we may consider their
challenge under the standards governing both "facial" and
"as-applied" challenges.  That is, they suggest that we may
pass judgment on the decency of the plaintiffs' speech,
even if we are unable to conclude that the act is facially
unconstitutional.  Surely this procedural confusion arises
out of the three opinions of the D.C. Circuit in National
Treasury Employees Union v. United States, 990 F.3d 1271,
1279-80 (D.C. Cir. 1993), aff'd, 115 S. Ct. 1003.</P>

<P>I doubt that we could undertake an as-applied inquiry,
since we do not know the exact content of plaintiffs'
speech.  Indeed, it is impossible to know the exact content
of some plaintiffs' speech, since plaintiffs themselves
cannot know that content.  America Online, for example,
cannot know what its subscribers will spontaneously say in
chat rooms or post to bulletin boards.  In any event, I
need not address this issue, in the light of our
disposition today.</P>

<P>(4)"Dial-a-porn" is a shorthand description of "sexually
oriented prerecorded telephone messages".  Sable, 492 U.S.
at 117-18.</P>

<P>(5)In turn, Pacifica's definition of indecency has its
roots in the Supreme Court's obscenity jurisprudence. 
Indecency includes some but not all of the elements of
obscenity.  See, e.g., Alliance for Community Media, 56
F.3d at 113-14 n.4.</P>

<P>(6)The reach of the two provisions is not coterminous,
however.  As we explain in the introduction to this
Adjudication, Section 223(a) reaches the making, creation,
transmission, and initiation of indecent speech.  Section
223(d) arguably reaches more broadly to the "display" of
indecent speech.  I conclude here only that both sections
refer to the identical type of proscribed speech.</P>

<P>(7)At oral argument, counsel for the Government candidly
recognized that "there's nothing quite like this statute
before", and that the CDA's novelty raised some
"legislative craftsmanship problem[s]".  Transcript of May
10, 1996, at 81-82.  I believe that my analysis here makes
sense in the light of the legislative history and the
jurisprudence on which Congress relied in enacting the CDA. 
See Senate Report at 188, reprinted in 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. at
201-02.</P>

<P>(8)The counterargument is that Section 223(e)(5)(A), when
read together with Section 223(e)(6), merely confers
jurisdiction on the FCC to prescribe the "reasonable,
effective, and appropriate actions" that count as defenses. 
Congress employed a similar scheme for dial-a-porn.  See
Dial Information Servs., 938 F.2d at 1539 (citing 47 U.S.C.

<P>(9)The play was "critically acclaimed and long-running in
Los Angeles area theaters".  Infinity Broadcasting, 3 FCC
R. at 932.</P>

<P>(10)Analytically, it makes sense that indecent speech has
public value. After all, indecent speech is nevertheless
protected speech, see, e.g., Sable, 492 U.S. at 126, and it
must therefore have some public value that underlies the
need for protection.  Obscenity, by contrast, has no public
value, id. at 124, and thus has no protection from
proscription.</P>

<P>(11)Internet technology undercuts the Government's argument
that the "in context" element of Sections 223(a) and 223(d)
would insulate plaintiffs such as Critical Path from
liability.  See, e.g., Transcript of May 10, 1996, at
89-91.  A user who clicks on a link in the Critical Path
database (see Findings 33, 77-78) might travel to a highly
graphic page in a larger HTML document.  The social value
of that page, in context, might be debatable, but the use
of links effectively excerpts that document by eliminating
content unrelated to the link.</P>

<P>(12)Moreover, because of the technology of Internet relay
chat, it would need to make this determination before it
organized the chat room, since it could not pre-screen the
discussion among the participants.  Thus, it would need to
predict, in advance, what the participants were likely to
say.  The participants would need to make a similar
determination, unaided (I expect) by First Amendment
lawyers.</P>

<P>(14)In this section I do not imply that the FCC has
jurisdiction to process Internet complaints in the same
manner as it does for broadcast.  The extent of the FCC's
jurisdiction under the CDA is a sticky question not
relevant here. See Senate Report at 190-91, reprinted in
1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 204.  Because the administrative
decisions cited above arose out of citizens' complaints to
the FCC, however, they provide a kind of surrogate insight
into the kinds of speech that citizens have charged as
indecent in the past.</P>

<P>(15)See Finding of fact 81.  See also Symposium, Emerging
Media:  Technology and the First Amendment, 104 Yale L.J.
1613 (1995).</P>

<P>(16)A narrow holding for this new medium also will not
eliminate the chill to plaintiffs, who could well stifle
the extent of their participation in this new medium while
awaiting a future iteration of the CDA.  Such a holding
would also lead Congress to believe that a rewritten CDA
(using, for example, a "harmful to minors" standard, see
Senate Report at 189, reprinted in 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. at
202) would pass constitutional muster.  In my view, a
holding consistent with the novel qualities of this medium
provides Congress with prompt and clear answers to the
questions that the CDA asks.</P>

<P>(17)The history of dial-a-porn regulation both before and
after Sable is tortuous, and involves the intervention of
all three branches of government.  I will not rehearse that
history here, deferring instead to the other courts that
have recounted it. See, e.g., Sable, 492 U.S. at 118-23;
Dial Information Serv., 938 F.2d at 1537-40; Information
Providers Coalition, 928 F.2d at 870-73.</P>

<P>(18)Sable is arguably not a decision about mass
communication.  Unlike Red Lion, Tornillo, or Turner, the
Court in Sable reached no conclusions about the proper fit
between the First Amendment and governmental regulation of
the telephone.  The case also includes no discussion of the
technology of the telephone generally.  The plaintiff in
that case, a purveyor of dial-a-porn, challenged the
statute only with respect to that type of content.  Sable,
492 U.S. at 117-18.  Thus, the Court's opinion discussed
only the "dial-in services".  Id. at 128.  Since every
telephone call at issue was, by definition, dial-a-porn,
every telephone call was, by definition, either obscene or
indecent.  Id. at 132 (Scalia, J., concurring). Here,
however, plaintiffs represent forty-seven different
speakers (including educational associations and consortia)
who provide content to the Internet on a broad range of
topics.  The limited reach of the Sable holding renders it
inapt to the Internet communications of the plaintiffs in
these actions.</P>

<P>(19)I note here, too, that we have found as a fact that
operation of a computer is not as simple as turning on a
television, and that the assaultive nature of television,
see Pacifica, 438 U.S. at 748-49, is quite absent in
Internet use.  See Findings 87-89.  The use of warnings and
headings, for example, will normally shield users from
immediate entry into a sexually explicit Web site or
newsgroup message.  See Finding 88.  The Government may
well be right that sexually explicit content is just a few
clicks of a mouse away from the user, but there is an
immense legal significance to those few clicks.</P>

<P>(20)In a May 3, 1996 letter to a three-judge court in the
Southern District of New York, John C. Keeney, Acting
Assistant Attorney General in the Criminal Division of the
Department of Justice, has advised that tagging would be
"substantial evidence" in support of a Section 223(e)(5)(A)
defense:</P>

<P>Under present technology, non-commercial content providers
can take steps to list their site[s] in URL registries of
covered sites, register their site[s] with the marketplace
of browsers and blocking software (including listing an IP
address), place their material in a directory blocked by
screening software, or take other similarly effective
affirmative steps to make their site[s] known to the world
to allow the site[s] to be blocked.  Under present
technology, it is the position of the Department of Justice
that, absent extraordinary circumstances, such efforts
would constitute substantial evidence that a content
provider had taken good faith, reasonable, effective, and
appropriate actions under the circumstances to restrict or
prevent access by minors to the covered material.  The same
would be true for tagging by content providers coupled with
evidence that the tag would be screened by the marketplace
of browsers and blocking software.</P>

<P>Letter of May 3, 1996 from Acting Assistant Attorney
General John C. Keeney to Hons. Denise L. Cote, Leonard B.
Sand, and Jose A. Cabranes, attached to Defendants' Motion
for Leave to File Supplemental Statement.  On May 8, 1996,
the Government moved to file the Kenney letter in this
action, and we granted the motion as unopposed the next
day.</P>

<P>The letter certainly raises more questions than it answers. 
I wonder, for example, whether it is consistent with the
plain language of the Act simply for content providers to
"make their site[s] known to the world" and thereby "to
allow [them] to be blocked", even though this form of
notice alone would not reduce the availability of indecent
content.  Cf. Senate Report at 178, 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. at
201 (noting that Section 223(d) "applies to content
providers who post indecent material for online display
without taking precautions that shield that material from
minors").  It is also an unanswered question whether the
Keeney letter would eliminate any of the CDA's chill, since
the Government acknowledged that the letter would not
prohibit a United States Attorney from taking a contrary
position in a particular prosecution.  See Defendants' May
9, 1996 Response to the May 8, 1996 Order of Court.  The
letter also fails to mention how users who participate in
chat rooms, newsgroups, listservs, and e-mail might take
advantage of Section 223(e)(5)(A).  Finally, it is
undisputed that neither PICS nor the hypothetical "-L18"
tag are available to speakers using the World Wide Web
today, whom the Government has explicitly reserved its
right to prosecute should the CDA ultimately be found
constitutional.  See Stipulation and Order of February 26,
1996, quoted supra.</P>

<P>(21)Turner examined certain "must-carry" provisions under
an intermediate scrutiny, since those laws imposed
incidental burdens on speech but did not directly regulate
content.  Turner, 114 S. Ct. at 2469.  The Court remanded
the case to the district court without passing on the
constitutionality of the must-carry provisions.  Id. at
2472.</P>

<P>(22)Arguably, a valid CDA would create an incentive for
overseas pornographers not to label their speech. If we
upheld the CDA, foreign pornographers could reap the
benefit of unfettered access to American audiences.  A
valid CDA might also encourage American pornographers to
relocate in foreign countries or at least use anonymous
remailers from foreign servers.</P>

There is an enormous volume ofmaterial available on the topic of tobacco advertising, and while it is notnecessary to examine ]<tt>all of the evidence, the British Studyrelied only "on a handful of articles and books which largely support itsconclusion."</tt>"fn688" [442  The failure toaddress some of the more significant works written specifically on the topic ofthe tobacco advertising controversy443 accounts for some of the Study's mostsignificant weaknesses.<p>	One of the decisive weaknesses in the British Study is its treatment of thequestion of causality.  Because the question of causality is central to thecontroversy, it is especially important that conclusions as to causality bewell evidenced.  However, the British Study fails to do this.  For example,"the Report is able to arrive at its conclusion that advertising does affectconsumption only by `pooling' studies of widely different quality into somecrude outcome table which is itself an unacceptable statistical practice andfrom which any conclusion is meaningless."444<p>	The British Study concludes that the preponderance of the evidence from theeconometric studies supports the finding that advertising has a positive effecton consumption.445  Yet, the report also points out flaws in thesestudies-- ]<tt>i.e., bad methodology, reliance onincomplete or incorrect data, and the bias introduced by the failure to testfor effects of certain variables likely to affect consumption-- and thuscalls into question their findings.</tt>"fn699" [446  Perhaps most significantly, the authors'own research using data on advertising and consumption in Britain indicates nostatistically significant relationship between consumption and advertising.447Yet, the authors offer no convincing explanation why their own asserted resultsshould be given any weight.448  The authors reach their "preponderance of theevidence" conclusion by arguing that, notwithstanding the flaws in the studiesthey have reviewed, if advertising truly had no effect on consumption, thenumber of studies finding no effect and the number of those finding a positiveeffect would be approximately equal.449  Finding that this equality in numbersof reported studies does not obtain, the authors conclude that advertising musthave some effect on consumption. <p>	The premise of this reasoning is simply incorrect.  Scientific journalsgenerally do not publish studies that fail to find an effect; grant-givingagencies generally do not fund studies that are likely not to report an effect;and, therefore, scientists (including social scientists) generally do notdesign or conduct studies that are likely not to find an effect, and generallydo not write up or submit for publication studies that have failed to find aneffect.  In the scientific community, the bias in favor of studies that reportan effect and against studies that do not report an effect is well known.Therefore, the premise that, if advertising did not affect aggregateconsumption, there would be equal numbers of studies finding and not findingsuch an effect is baseless.450  Moreover, as noted by Dr. Laurence W. Hagan:<p>"[Smee] utilizes a simple, but arbitrary and defective method of evaluating thetotal set of studies.  The report lists a summary of all the published resultscited tallying the balance of positive and negative findings, but excludingresults from equations which the authors report as misspecified. . . . Thisapproach by [Smee] of regarding econometric studies as sample observations froma universe is novel, but has no valid scientific basis.  Different analyticalapproaches of various degrees of statistical rigor, often applied to the samedata, cannot be regarded as randomized observations."451<p><p>	The basic approach of simply counting studies is fundamentally flawed.  Somestudies use accurate data; others use data that are incomplete or erroneous.Some employ appropriate statistical techniques, others do not.  Some employlarge amounts of data spanning a considerable period of time; others examinerelatively short time periods.  Surely the conclusions of studies usingappropriate statistical techniques on accurate data over a lengthy period oftime are entitled to greater weight.  Any reasonable assessment of the weightof the evidence must consider the differences in study design and reliability.The British report assumed that all studies are created equal, and gives themall equal weight.  It then compounded the error by examining not just theoverall conclusion of the study, but rather each individual statisticalanalysis within the article.  Thus, a study that failed to find a significanteffect of advertising on consumption, but searched for such an effect byrunning numerous statistical models, was given greater weight than a study thatreports a single, well-specified model that finds no effect.<p>	Professors Leeflang and Reuyl,452 who authored one of the studies relied uponin the British study, stated that "[w]e strongly disagree with [the Britishstudy's] conclusion that advertising has a positive effect on tobaccoconsumption....  We are astonished that [the British study]formulate[s] such ill-founded conclusions."453  Leeflang and Reuyl admonishedthe authors of the British study for several reasons, but the most telling istheir criticism that the British study simply drew the wrong conclusions fromthe evidence presented.  <p>]<p><tt><b>			(5)	The Studies FDA Cites Do Not</b></tt><p><tt><b>				Support the Claimed Relationship</b></tt><p><tt><b>				Between Advertising Expenditures</b></tt><p><tt>				<b>and Consumption                 </b></tt><p><tt></tt><p><tt>	FDA asserts that a number of studies provide evidence that changes inadvertising expenditures can have an effect on youth smoking behavior.  Theerrors in these studies as they relate to FDA's proposed rule are discussedbelow.</tt><p><tt><b>				1.  Laugesen and Meads II</b></tt>"fn708" [454 <p>	The authors measured the effects of changing several variables on movementsaway from an "equilibrium" demand for cigarettes.455  Their variables were:changes in weekly expenditures for advertising of cigarettes in newspapers;changes in price of cigarettes, income, appearance of newspaper articles onsmoking-relatedissues; and the number of shopping days in the week.  Data on purchases ofcigarettes from 60 New Zealand supermarkets were collected for a 42-weekperiod (November 1988 to August 1989).  During this period, tax increases ledto three different price increases.  The authors divided advertisingexpenditures into three categories: upmarket (high price brands), regularmarket, and downmarket (low price brands).<p>	The authors found that changes in newspaper advertising expenditures fordownmarket brands were correlated with changes in total demand for allcigarettes.456  Proceeding on the assumption that youths smoke low-pricedor downmarket cigarettes, the authors concluded that there was a positiverelationship between advertising expenditures and consumption of tobaccoproducts by youths.457]<p><tt><b>					(a)</b>  <b>Sample Is Not Representative</b></tt><p><tt>	The survey collected data from supermarkets, but did not explain whysupermarkets are a representative data collection point.  As the authors noted,supermarkets account for only twenty percent of cigarette purchases in NewZealand.</tt>"fn712" [458  <p>	Further, the authors offered no evidence or explanation for the assumptionthat youths purchase their cigarettes at supermarkets.  If youths do not make asignificant level of purchases at supermarkets, the authors' findings thatadvertising affects the level of cigarettes purchased at supermarkets can notbe applied to youths.  The authors simply ]<tt>assumed that youthspurchase less expensive cigarettes because their elasticity of demand isgreater than that of adults.  That, however, is not necessarily or eveninevitably so.</tt><p><tt>	Even with respect to adults, the limitation of the data to supermarketsales is critical.  Different retail outlets are likely to have differentpricing structures.  In a short study period with three tax-inducedprice increases, one might expect to see consumers shift their purchases towardlower priced retail outlets --i.e., supermarkets.  Moreover, L&amp;M note that downmarket brandadvertising was particularly heavy in the weeks around a price increase.</tt>"fn713" [459  That is hardly surprising, since priceincreases should increase the attractiveness of low price brands compared toother brands.  Thus, L&amp;M's conclusion --that advertising of downmarket brands increased supermarket sales of allcigarettes --may simply reflect the fact that higher prices led more consumers to purchasefrom relatively lower priced retail outlets.<p>	L&amp;M cited other evidence that cigarette sales may well have shifted towardsupermarkets.  They noted that during the study period, the fraction of adultsmokers in the population fell 9.1 percent.  Supermarket sales of cigarettesfell only 1.6 percent.460  This is exactly what one would expect if smokersincreased their purchases from supermarkets at the expense of other retailoutlets.  It does not imply, however, any increase in the total demand forcigarettes.]<p><tt><b>					(b)	The Study Does Not Collect</b></tt><p><tt>						<b>Data on Sales toYouths</b></tt><p><p><tt>	Even more troubling than the problems with sampling technique, the authorsoffered no justification for the assumption that young people purchasedownmarket cigarettes at a higher rate than the general population.  Unlessthis questionable assumption is accurate, the study is without merit.  L&amp;Mreasoned that less expensive brands will have more appeal to those with lowerincomes, and that the young tend to have lower incomes.  The main downmarketbrand, however, was reportedly used by only four percent of 10-to 19-year-oldsmokers,</tt>"fn715" [461 a fact that hardlysupports the greater appeal of low price brands to the young.  In the UnitedStates, low price brands clearly do not have any noticeable youth appeal.  TheTAPS-IIdata indicate that young people, as a group, purchase a greater portion ofhigher priced cigarettes than do adults.462  ]<p><tt><b>					(c)  The Authors Ignore Contradictory</b></tt><p><tt><b>						Findings                        </b></tt><p><p><tt>	The evidence cited in the study does not support the general hypothesisthat advertising affects consumption.  L&amp;M's regression analysis indicatesthat changes in advertising of upmarket and regular market brands isnegatively correlated with changes in total cigarette consumption, aresult that is directly contrary to FDA's rationale for its proposedregulations --the notion that advertising of full-priced brands induces teens tosmoke.</tt>"fn718" [463  <p>	Another plausible scenario, however, is that purchasers of upmarket brandsswitched to lower priced cigarettes in response to the increased price ofupmarket cigarettes --not increased advertising.  ]<p><tt><b>					(d)	Laugesen and Meads Fail To Include</b></tt><p><tt>						<b>Relevant Variables in Their Model </b></tt><p><p><tt>	The authors failed to account for the particular warning on advertisementsand cigarette packets, a variable that has changed over time.  As the authorsnote, in 1988 New Zealand began to require that cigarette advertisements andcigarette packets carry health warnings that varied.</tt>"fn718" [464  The authors did not attempt to modelchanges in consumption that are related to different health warnings inadvertisements and in cigarette packets.  If these warnings were rotated onsome set schedule, for instance, changes from the "equilibrium" demand levelmay be related to the changing warnings and not to changing advertisingexpenditures. ]<p><tt><b>				2.  Chetwynd et al. and Harrison et al.</b></tt>"fn719" [465<p>	To test the proposition that advertising has a positive effect on consumptionof tobacco products, the authors studied the relationship between cigaretteconsumption and cigarette advertising for the period 1973 to 1985 in NewZealand.  A regression model (log form) was used to determine the effect thatadvertising expenditures had on consumption levels of cigarettes.  Theresearchers included as independent variables the price of a packet ofcigarettes, income, and print media advertising expenditures.  Advertisingexpenditures per month were estimated from available industry data thatincluded a weighted index for readership and circulation.466<p>	The researchers found a significant correlation between advertising andconsumption based on quarterly data, but not on annual data.467  They attemptedto explain this development by noting that the interpurchase time forcigarettes is relatively short, and that annualized data may mask significantrelationships occurring within a short-termhorizon.468  This explains nothing, however, because the trends that count arelonger term; short-termfluctuations are bound to be misleading.  Such reasoning also is contrary toFDA's contention that long-termexposure to advertising induces teens to become smokers.]<p><tt><b>					(a)	The Analysis Fails To Account for</b></tt><p><tt><b>						Common Trends Resulting from</b></tt><p><tt><b>						the Diffusion of Information </b></tt><p><tt>						<b>About Health Risks</b>/tt><p><p><tt>	Over the time period of the Chetwynd et al. study (1973-1986),cigarette consumption was declining in New Zealand,</tt>"fn724" [469 as it was in the United States.Researchers examining U.S. data have attributed a significant portion of thatdecline to the diffusion of information about the potential health risks ofcigarettes.470  Presumably, a similar phenomenon was at work in New Zealand,but the study makes no attempt to control for the spread of information, orotherwise allow for the declining trend in per capita cigarette consumption.<p>	Over the same time period, however, cigarette advertising was apparentlydeclining as well.471  With both advertising and consumption moving in the samedirection, the statistically inevitable result is a positive correlationbetween the two.  In fact, however, the downward trends in both consumption andadvertising may have been more closely related to this third variable, thediffusion of health risk information.  As the dissemination of this informationled to a decline in demand for tobacco products (a direct effect), advertisingefforts were reduced (an indirect effect).  Because the study failed to makeany allowance for this third, trend causing, variable, the claimed effect ofadvertising is not reliable.]<p><tt><b>					(b)	Measuring Consumption Using a</b></tt><p><tt><b>						Moving Average Distorts the</b></tt><p><tt>						<b>Results</b></tt><p><p><tt>	Chetwynd et al. constructed their measures of quarterly and annualcigarette consumption from monthly data.  Rather than using actual monthlyconsumption, however, they used a five-monthmoving average of monthly data.  The averaging process tends to emphasize theunderlying trends, rather than the actual variations in the data.  Indeed, thatis the rationale for averaging --it smooths out month-to-monthvariability in the data to highlight the trends.  Thus the moving averagesimply exacerbates the problem of a common downward trend in advertising andconsumption discussed above.</tt><p><tt>	The moving average creates another problem as well.  A significant portionof the cigarette consumption that the statistical model attributes to currentadvertising actually occurred before the advertising that allegedly caused it.For example, the consumption measure for the month of June could be calculatedas the average of consumption in April, May, June, July and August.  If this"June" consumption is matched with June advertising data, which was notaveraged, 40 percent of the consumption allegedly explained by the Juneadvertising expenditures actually occurred before the advertising.  Addingthree "months" to obtain quarterly data reduces the problem, but does noteliminate it; with quarterly data, some 20 percent of the current quarter'smeasured consumption actually occurred before the advertising.  With annualdata, based on adding up 12 months, the problem is substantially reduced.  Inannual data, however, Chetwynd et al. find no relationship between advertisingand consumption.  Thus, as the distortion introduced by the moving average isreduced, the significance of their results is reduced as well.</tt><p><tt><b>					(c)	The Model May Contain Built-In</b></tt><p><tt>						<b>Errors</b></tt><p><p><tt>	Because they use average cigarette consumption data over a five monthperiod to measure effects of advertising over only a three month period, theauthors' model is susceptible to problems of spurious correlation.  In simplestterms, the moving average for cigarette consumption will represent, in someway, smoking behavior which occurred prior to the advertising against which itis being tested.  Accordingly, we know that some of what went into determiningthe average consumption figure includes data absolutely unrelated to theadvertising.  In other words, suppose the effects of advertising implemented inJanuary, February and March were measured against smoking data collected formonths December through April.  We know that December cigarette consumption isunaffected by January's ads.  Because they failed to control for this fact, theauthor's results are questionable.</tt>"fn728" [472]<p><tt><b>					(d)	The Chetwynd Model Indicates</b></tt><p><tt>						<b>Correlation But Not Causation</b></tt><p><p><tt>	Even if the authors' results indicate correlation, they fail to establishcausation.  Because changes in advertising expenditures will enter into asupplier's product cost base, in addition to potentially affecting demand, itis difficult (though not impossible) to model a simultaneous equation with asingle equation.  Response coefficients determined by the model may beattributable to the actions of producers.  Thus, causation is difficult toestablish.</tt><p><tt><b>					(e)	The Model Suffers from Poor Data and Fails To Take into AccountChanging Social Mores                        </b></tt><p><p><tt>	As the authors themselves note, a number of other variables were alsoconsidered for inclusion in the model, but had to be rejected because of a lackof data.  For example, the effects of antismoking campaigns are not estimated.Since these missing variables may have a strong effect on cigaretteconsumption, the model is misspecified,i.e.--inappropriately designed.  This means that allof the estimates of the effects of price, income, and advertising onconsumption are biased and inconsistent because they fail to account for theexplanatory variables.  The authors apparently neglected to test for any sourceof model misspecification.  </tt><p><tt>	Further, the use of newspaper advertising data as a proxy for"advertising" may lead to biased results.  As the authors note, newspaperadvertising is only one part of cigarette promotion.</tt>"fn731" [473  Thus, the data are incomplete.  Itcannot be assumed that more complete data would support conclusions based onseriously incomplete data.  Further, newspaper advertising as a ratio of totaladvertising will change over time.  It is, of course, unclear how this changewould affect the model, but as a proxy for "advertising" the fact that itsratio is changing can affect the reliability of results.474]<p><tt><b>				3.  Raferty</b></tt>"fn732" [475<p>	This paper is simply a short review of the literature on the effect ofadvertising on tobacco consumption.  FDA cannot legitimately rely on it assupport for its proposition that advertising affects consumption.<p>	Raferty performs no empirical analysis, but rather merely repeats the findingsof studies already criticized.

Roberts &amp; Samuelson</b></tt>"fn733" [476<p>	The authors studied whether increased advertising expenditures for low-"tar"cigarette products increased overall cigarette consumption by analyzing therole of advertising competition in U.S. markets for high-"tar" and low-"tar"cigarettes during the 1971 to 1982 period.477  Their model includes equationsfor demand for the products of a particular firm, production cost, and theoptimal level of advertising.478  The authors measure the level of advertisingin "messages," not in expenditures.479  This study is one of the most complexof its type, but it "must be considered an ambitiousfailure....  [I]nadequacies in some of the assumptionsand the data make the results of the study generally unreliable."480Theoretically, the authors seek to determine whether producers' decisions to"supply" advertising were responsive to their competitors' decisions to supplyadvertising.  If they were, that fact indicates that advertising affectsgeneral demand, as opposed to simply demand for a particular firm's product. <p>	The authors conclude (1)that low-"tar"cigarette advertising has an effect on market demand for both high-"tar" andlow-"tar" products, (2)that that result suggests advertising forlow-"tar" products increases the demand for cigarettes in general, and(3)that advertising for high-"tar"brands does not have a significant effect on total consumption.481  Thedifference in the effects of high-"tar" and low-"tar" advertising cannot bereconciled, and had the authors performed a "statistical test of whether theown-effect of high-"tar" advertising was at least as large as the cross-effectof low-"tar" advertising[,] . . . they almost surely would have found thattheir results had failed."482  The TAPSII data indicate that 65 percentof respondents age 17 and under smoke the regular version of their brand ofchoice, not the low-"tar" version.  In the case of Marlboro, Newport andCamel-- the three most popular brands among young smokers-- theregular version of these brands falls within Roberts' and Samuelson'sdefinition of high-"tar" cigarettes.]<p><tt><b>					(a)	The Study Does Not Support FDA'sProposition </b></tt><p><p><tt>	The authors find that advertising for high-"tar" brands--i.e., advertising not emphasizing "tar" levels-- does nothave a significant effect on total consumption.  What effect there is isnegative.  This finding directly contradicts FDA's proposition that advertisingaffects the level of youth consumption of tobacco products, at least withrespect to advertising not focused on the product's low-"tar" level.  </tt><p><tt><b>					(b)	Population Growth May Account for</b></tt><p><tt><b>						the Finding of a Relationship Between</b></tt><p><tt><b>						Advertising and Consumption          </b></tt><p><tt></tt><p><tt>	The authors test whether the level of total tobaccoconsumption is a function of (i.e., driven by), in part, thenumber of advertising messages.</tt>"fn740" [483Total consumption was growing for most of the period the authors studied, anddeclined only in 1982.  However, because the measuring of advertising isdependent, in part, upon increases in the population, the increase in totaltobacco consumption "found" might simply be attributable to an expandingpopulation.  Thus, in the model, it is questionable whether it is theadvertising or the increased population that is affecting consumption.  Becausethe authors do not isolate changes in advertising messages due to changes inpopulation from other determinants of the level of messages, changes in theconsumption of tobacco products cannot be uniquely attributed to changes inadvertising.<p>	Roberts and Samuelson seek to explain total cigarette consumption, rather thanconsumption per capita.  Over the period they study, the difference iscritical.  Total cigarette consumption increased until the last year of theirstudy period, and has declined ever since.  Per capita consumption, however,peaked in 1973, and declined thereafter.484  Clearly, an important part of thereason for increases in total consumption over this period was substantialincreases in the adult population as baby boomers reached adulthood. Between1970 and 1980, the population over age 18 increased by 29 million, butpopulation in younger age groups actually declined.485<p>	The authors do not account for the influence of this significant change inpopulation.  It is, however, implicitly reflected in their advertising measure.Because they seek to measure advertising messages, increases in the audience ofa particular advertisement will increase measured advertising.  As populationgrew, and, presumably, circulation of magazines and audiences of billboardsgrew, Roberts and Samuelson effectively measure more advertising.  Both theincrease in measured advertising and the increase in aggregate consumption aredriven by the same common cause --growth in population.<p>	The role of population also accounts for the different results between the high-"tar"and the low-"tar"markets.  Although low-"tar"advertising was increasing, advertising in the high-"tar"market was actually declining over this period as the market shifted towardlower "tar" brands.  Thus, low-"tar"advertising effectively measures the increase in population, but high-"tar"advertising does not.]<p><tt><b>					(c)	Misallocation of Advertising Expenditures May Bias theResults</b></tt><p><p><tt>	In allocating general advertising expenditures, i.e.,expenditures on advertising that cannot be classified as uniquely related tohigh-"tar"or low-"tar"products, the authors make the allocation in proportion to sales.</tt>"fn740" [486  Assuming advertising expenditures wereclassified correctly, the authors' model imposes a constraint that virtuallyguarantees an effect of low-"tar"advertising on the high-"tar"market.  Advertising the low-"tar"version of a particular brand is likely to affect the sales of high-"tar"versions of that same brand as well.  Thus, for example, advertising forMarlboro Lights may well have spillover effects on the demand for Marlbororegulars (a high-"tar"brand in the Roberts and Samuelson classification), even if the only effect ofadvertising is on brand choice.  <p>	Roberts and Samuelson, however, assume that there are no spillover effects onmarket share.  Indeed, their estimates impose that assumption as aconstraint-- Marlboro's low-"tar"advertising (or general advertising) is not allowed, in their estimates, toinfluence its share of the high-"tar"market.487  As a result, this effect shows up in the only place it can--as an effect of low-"tar"advertising on the demand for high-"tar"cigarettes.  Other brands with both high-and low-"tar"varieties are subject to the same effect.  The effect is particularly marked inthe case of Marlboro, however, because its sales were growing in both the high-"tar"and low-"tar"markets.<p>	The authors' incorrect classification of advertising data for generaladvertising expenditures may have a significant effect on the results.  Themodel itself was artificially constrained because the model allowed low-"tar"advertising to have an effect on high-"tar"sales, but did not allow a particular low-"tar"brand to have an effect on a particular high-"tar"brand's market share.  Because several manufacturers offer both high- and low-"tar"versions of particular brands, general advertising expenditures will affectboth.  Combined with the restriction noted above, the extent of cross-effectswas lost.]<p><tt><b>				5.

The court found theevidence in this regard "deficient, if not non-existent."491 The court thus found "no rational connection" between the means chosen and thelegislation's objective of reducing smoking.492  <p>	The court concluded that neither the TSB Report nor any other scientificevidence demonstrates that a ban on advertising would affect consumption.Specifically with regard to the TSB Report (on which, as discussed above, FDArelies), the court observed that "it contains serious methodological errors anda lack of scientific rigor which renders it for all intents and purposes devoidof any probative value."493  The court concluded that the government's attemptto ban tobacco advertising, with no probative evidence that doing so wouldreduce consumption, was contrary to the Charter of Rights and Freedoms andincompatible with the principles that should guide any free and democraticsociety.494<p>	"There is no evidence that advertising as such entails a danger to publichealth," the court observed.

See 60 Fed. Reg. 41,336(text-onlyformat "would effectively reduce the appeal of tobacco products to children andadolescents").

Reg.41,335).

Moreover, while FCLAA prohibits cigarettes from beingadvertised on "any medium of electronic communications subject to thejurisdiction of the Federal Communications Commission," 15U.S.C.[[section]]1335, it permits cigarette advertising in any othermedium (subject to the applicable health warning requirements).  See 15U.S.C. [[section]][[section]]1331, 1334.  FDA thus cannot further limitthe media in which cigarettes may be advertised.  </tt><p><tt><b>		4.  Unconstitutional</b></tt><p><tt>	For the reasons discussed above, the basic premise ofSection897.30(a)(1)-- that image advertising influences orpredisposes young people to smoke-- is unfounded.  FDA thus cannotdemonstrate that restricting or forbidding such cigarette advertising "will infact" reduce underage smoking.  See Edenfieldv.Fane, 113S.Ct.1792 (1993).  FDA also cannotdemonstrate that the goal of reducing underage smoking requires restrictions oncigarette advertising.  See Rubinv. Coors,115S.Ct. 1585 (1995).  For these reasons, Section897.30(a)(1)would violate the First Amendment.  </tt><p><tt>	Section897.30(a)(1) would also violate the First Amendment becauseFDA has offered no evidence for its assumption that cigarette advertising inany media not "currently used" by cigarette manufacturers would influence orpredispose children to begin smoking-- even cigarette advertising inmedia to which children are not exposed to any significant extent.  Under theFirst Amendment, the government may not ban commercial speech prophylactically.See Zaudererv. Office of Disciplinary Counsel,471U.S. 626, 646-47 (1985); NAACPv.

FCLAA expresslycontemplates that cigarettes may be advertised on billboards, subject tospecified health warning requirements.  15 U.S.C. [[section]]1333.Although it restricts advertising in other media, the FCLAA places nolimitations on billboard advertising.  See 15 U.S.C.[[section]]1335.  The limitation on cigarette advertising on electronicmedia is the only limit Congress has imposed on the media through whichcigarettes may be advertised.</tt><p><tt><b>		4.</b>  <b>Not Factually Supported</b></tt><p><tt>	FDA asserts that Section897.30(b) "is a reasonable restriction"because the cigarette industry's voluntary advertising guide contains a similarprovision.  60Fed. Reg.41,334.  But Section897.30(b) in factis not "similar" to the industry's voluntary code.  It is far morerestrictive.</tt><p><tt>	Applies to More Media.  The industry code applies to outdoor</tt><p><tt>advertising on billboards; Section897.30(b) would apply to alloutdoor signage, including signage on the exterior of retail establishmentsthat sell tobacco, and conceivably even to advertising on buses, taxis andother vehicles that might venture within the 1000-footzone.  The proposed rule by its terms would prevent retail establishmentswithin the 1000-footzone from informing potential customers that cigarettes (or particular brandsthereof) are available for purchase therein (and at what prices).  This notonly would hurt the retailers but would increase, in turn, the search costs foradult smokers.  Retailers in the small slivers of a city in which outdooradvertising would continue to be permitted would be afforded an unfaircompetitive advantage vis-&aacute;-visthose unlucky enough to be situated in a "forbidden zone"-- perhaps justacross the street.  </tt><p><tt>	Scope of "Playground" Unclear.  As indicated, the industry coderefers to "children's playgrounds" (i.e., playgrounds designedprimarily for use by children); Section 897.30(b) refers to "any playground," aterm that is not defined in the proposed regulations or the preamble.  The termconceivably could be construed to include literally any place of outdoorrecreation where children may play-- even places used primarily bypersons 18 years of age or older.  </tt><p><tt>	Imposes De Facto Ban.  The industry code prohibits outdoorbillboard advertising within 500 feet of schools and "children'splaygrounds"; Section 897.30(b) would prohibit all outdoor advertisingwithin 1000 feet of schools and "any playground"-- evenbillboards facing away from schools and playgrounds or overlooking highways,freeways and other commuter routes.</tt><p><tt>	Placing around each school and playground a circle with a radius of 1000feet drawn from the perimeter of the facility would establish a "forbiddenzone" that would be at least 2000 feet in diameter -- that is well overone-third of a mile.  In many, if not most, communities, this would betantamount to a general ban, for there would be virtually no outdoor locationthat could escape the rule's prohibition.</tt><p><tt>	As illustrated in the maps on the pages that follow, even if the 1000-footrule applied to outdoor advertising only near schools (and not"playgrounds"), the effect in many major metropolitan areas would be to placethe vast majority of outdoor locations off-limitsto cigarette advertising.  If applied to outdoor advertising not only nearschools but also near "playgrounds" (if that term were to be given,unreasonably, its broadest conceivable meaning), the effect would be virtuallyindistinguishable from an outright ban. </tt><p><tt>	The maps on the pages that follow illustrate the application of the 1000-footrule in nine major metropolitan areas --Boston, Detroit, Manhattan, Miami, Oakland, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh,Providence, and Seattle.  Because the term "playground" is undefined, two mapshave been prepared for each city.  One illustrates the effect of the rule if itdid not apply to any "playgrounds"; the other illustrates the effect ofthe rule if "playgrounds" were interpreted (unreasonably) to include parks aswell as discrete playground facilities.  </tt><p><tt>	We assume that the definition of "playground" is not meant to be so broad,and thus that the effect of the 1000-footrule would fall somewhere in between these two extremes.  As the maps reveal,however, the effect would be tantamount to a ban, wherever the line isdrawn.</tt><p><tt>	In Manhattan, between 88.4 percent and 94.8 percent of the landarea would be off-limitsto outdoor cigarette advertising under Section 897.30(b).  In Boston,between 82 percent and 90 percent would be off-limits. In Oakland, between 84.7 percent and 88.3 percent would be off-limits. In Seattle, between 83 percent and 87.7 percent would be off-limits. In the five other metropolitan areas for which maps have been prepared, theeffect of Section 897.30(b) would be only slightly less drastic.  The whiteareas on the maps show where outdoor cigarette advertising would remainpossible under the 1000-footrule:  </tt><p><tt>	The fact that members of an industry have elected to submit to a code ofadvertising practices does not, ipso facto, make it "reasonable"for the government to impose mandatory advertising restrictions backed,inter alia, by criminal sanctions.</tt><p><tt>	First, private parties may voluntarily take many actions that theConstitution forbids the government to mandate.  An agency such as FDA may onlyexercise authority delegated to it by Congress.  The fact that members of anindustry have voluntarily taken particular actions cannot free FDA fromconstitutional limitations on its power or expand the authority delegated to itby statute.  The fact that private parties have taken such actions voluntarilydoes not make those actions "reasonable" for the government to require.</tt><p><tt>	Second, as a matter of policy, it plainly is ill-advised for anagency to use an industry's decision to adopt a system of self-regulation as anexcuse for the imposition of government controls.  Few industries will risk anyself-regulation if their decision to do so may be made the predicate for evengreater federal regulation.</tt><p><tt>	Third, the rationale for the cigarette industry's voluntary code isentirely different from FDA's rationale for its proposed rules.  FDA assertsthat cigarette advertising must be restricted because it believes thatadvertising influences or predisposes young people to smoke.  The cigarettemanufacturers, on the other hand, have voluntarily limited their advertising todemonstrate their responsiveness to societal concerns about cigaretteadvertising and youth -- even though the manufacturers believe that thoseconcerns are not well-founded for the reasons set forth supra.  Asexplained in the statement of Professor Timothy Meyer of the University ofWisconsin (Volume VIII), outdoor advertising is among the least effective mediafor reaching young people.</tt><p><tt><b>		5.  Unconstitutional</b></tt><p><tt>	For the reasons stated in connection with Section897.30(a)(1), inour general First Amendment comments on Subpart D, and in VolumeIX,Section897.30(b) would violate the First Amendment.  In addition, becausethe text-onlyrequirement itself would render the advertising unattractive to young people,according to FDA, the "protection" offered by the 1000-footrule would be wholly gratuitous.  The rule therefore cannot even be claimed toserve a "substantial" governmental interest under the Central Hudsontest. </tt><p><tt><b>[[section]] 897.32--Format and Content Requirements forLabeling</b></tt><p><tt><b>          andAdvertising&nbp;</b></tt><p><tt></tt><p><tt><b>	[[section]] 897.32(a)</b></tt><p><p><tt>	Section897.32(a) would require labeling and most advertising ofcigarettes to consist of "only black text on a white background," and wouldthus forbid the use of colors and images.

It is not aregulation of the "sale, distribution, or use" of the product itself, and,contrary to FDA's interpretation (as discussed above), Section 520(e) does notauthorize regulation of the "offer of sale" of a restricted device.  </tt><p><tt>	FDA's only authority to regulate the graphic elements of device labelingis to ensure that required information is presented with sufficient prominenceto be seen by the consumer and to ensure that labeling is not false ormisleading.  21 U.S.C. [[section]]352(a), (c).  FDA's only authority overdevice advertising-- which exists only for restricted devices-- isto ensure that such advertising is not false or misleading and that it containsprescribed information.  21 U.S.C. [[section]]352(q), (r).  FDA does notassert, and it could not show, that advertising in color and with imagery isfalse or misleading.  </tt><p><tt>	Instead, the Agency argues that the text-only, black-and-white format isthe only format that would "reduce the attraction and appeal that cigarette andsmokeless tobacco product advertising have for young people."  60 Fed. Reg.41,335.  No provision of the FDCA gives FDA authority to regulate advertisingor labeling to make it less "appealing."  The proposed regulation is,accordingly, beyond FDA's authority.  </tt><p><tt>	In addition, the proposal is overbroad because numerous kinds of colortext, pictures, or designs could be used in advertising that would have nospecial "appeal" to young people (e.g., pictures of olderpersons, or text-only color printing).  As discussed above, there is noprecedent in the history of food and drug law that supports FDA regulation ofadvertising and labeling in order to  "reduce the appeal" of a lawful product,even to persons who are not intended to be users of the product.  </tt><p><tt>	FDA attempts to justify its proposal by claiming that the prohibitedadvertising techniques (i.e., anything other than text-only,black-and-white advertising) would "encourage an unauthorized use of theseproducts and thus cause them to be misbranded."  60 Fed. Reg. 41,350.  Thistheory is insupportable for several reasons.  </tt><p><tt>	First, FDA's theory is wrong as a matter of law.  No provision inthe misbranding section (Section502) prohibits the promotion ofunauthorized uses.</tt>"1" [5  FDA cannotinvoke Section502's prohibitions on false or misleading labeling oradvertising to justify its proposal, because the advertising FDA would prohibit(]<tt>e.g., advertising with color and images) is not falseor misleading.  Moreover, FDA's theory is wrong as a matter of fact.  There isno evidence that advertising with color or images generally or commonlyrecommends, "encourages," or even mentions unauthorized use.  </tt><p><tt>	Second, FDA's proposal is discriminatory.  The Agency has notattempted to impose a ban on the use of color or graphic material in thelabeling or advertising of other medical products in order to discourage theirunauthorized use.  Under FDA's theory, unapproved uses of all products couldincrease with increasing physician awareness that comes with color and graphicadvertising techniques.  FDA must apply the same legal standards to cigarettesthat it applies to other regulated products.  United Statesv.Diapulse, 748 F.2d 56, 62 (2d Cir. 1984).  To treat cigarettesdifferently would be arbitrary and illegal.  "Consistency [is required] fromthe government ....  In every context, the overridingprinciple of fairness is always the same:  the government must govern with aneven hand."  United Statesv. Article ofDrug*** Exachol, 716 F.Supp. 787, 795 (S.D.N.Y.1989) (citing Airmark Corp.v. FAA, 758 F.2d 685, 692 (D.C.Cir. 1985)).</tt><p><tt>	Third, as discussed below, FDA's proposal also lacks factualsupport.  For example, FDA fails to establish that the advertising formats itproposes to prohibit appeal uniquely or predominantly, or even significantly,to people under age 18.  FDA has not presented any rationale that is a basisunder the FDCA for authority to prohibit advertising that is attractive toadult smokers and may be only incidentally attractive (if at all) tononadults.</tt><p><tt><b>		2.  Violates the APA</b></tt><p><tt>	FDA claims that it considered prohibiting "youth-oriented"images but was "unable to define the subset of advertising and labelingdirected to young people based upon the media selected or the location of theadvertising."  60 Fed. Reg. 41,336.  This is a non sequitur.  FDAhas confused two questions --(a) whether all image advertising is "appealing" (or equally "appealing") toyoung people in the sense FDA holds to be pernicious, and (b) whetheradvertising can be considered to be "directed to young people" based on themedium and location in which the advertising appears.</tt><p><tt>	FDA purports to have no answer to the first question because it was unableto answer the second; but the two are logically distinct.  FDA's failure toconsider limitations on image advertising short of banning such advertising inmedia to which more than a nominal number of young people is exposed isarbitrary and capricious.  The Agency's invitation for comment on "otherpotential methods that may exist for curbing advertising's appeal to youngpeople" (60 Fed. Reg. 41,336) is not a substitute for the notice and commentrequired by the APA.</tt><p><tt><b>		3.</b>	<b>Precluded by ADAMHA and FCLAA</b></tt><p><tt>	For the reasons stated in connection with Section 897.30(a)(1), Section897.32(a) is precluded by the ADAMHA Reorganization Act of 1992 and the FederalCigarette Labeling and Advertising Act.</tt><p><tt><b>		4.

See our comments on Section 897.34.</tt><p><tt>	Because FDA has not demonstrated that cigarette advertising influences orpredisposes persons under the age of 18 to smoke, the Agency cannot demonstratethat any of its proposed advertising restrictions "will in fact" reduce youthsmoking.  For that reason, Section897.32(a) fails the third prong of theCentral Hudson test.  Section 897.32(a) also cannot be defended as"narrowly tailored" for purposes of applying the fourth prong of the CentralHudson test because, notwithstanding FDA's attempt to cast the proposedregulation as narrowly tailored to address the specific "harm" said to flow tochildren from exposure to image advertising, the regulation would operate as aban on virtually all cigarette advertising.</tt><p><tt>	To be sure, FDA asserts that Section897.32(a) is a narrowly tailoredalternative to an advertising ban (1)because the text-onlylimitation would supposedly allow "informative advertising" to continue toreach persons 18 years of age even in media to which children are exposed, and(2)because the text-onlylimitation would not apply in media to which children are not exposed --"adult" publications.  Both of these reasons, however, evaporate uponexamination.</tt><p><tt>	First, for the reasons given in the statement of Professor TimothyMeyer in Volume VIII of these comments, images and colors themselves impartimportant information to consumers.  Moreover, as discussed above, a text-onlylimitation would render cigarette advertising invisible and preclude amanufacturer from distinguishing its brands from those of its competitors, andtherefore would be tantamount to a ban.</tt>"1" [6  In short, proposed Section 897.32(a) wouldoperate as an advertising ban, which cannot be defended as "narrowly tailored"under ]<tt>Central Hudson.</tt><p><tt>	Second, even if the First Amendment permitted FDA to ban imageadvertising that young people find "appealing" (and it does not), the FirstAmendment would still preclude FDA from banning image advertising that youngpeople do not find "appealing" --since such a ban on such advertising could not be said to serve the Agency'spurpose.  The First Amendment prohibits the government from banning commercialspeech that does not cause the harm which the government seeks to address.Central Hudson Gas &amp; Electric Corp. v. Public Service Comm'n,447 U.S. 557, 563-564(1980).</tt><p><tt>	As noted above, FDA failed to consider whether all image advertising is"appealing" to young people (or equally "appealing" to young people) in thesense the Agency holds to be pernicious, and therefore must be banned across-the-board. The First Amendment does not allow FDA to impose an across-the-boardban merely because the line-drawingrequired to distinguish image advertising that young people find "appealing"from image advertising they do not find "appealing" is difficult or complex.See Zauderer v.

Thus, a declaration of intended use as a nicotinedelivery device would be untrue (thereby forcing a violation of Section897.36).</tt><p><tt>	The information required under Section502(r)(2) essentially is thesame as that required for prescription drugs under Section502(n)(3).Section502(n)(3) requires advertising of a drug to include a "statementof information in brief summary relating to...effectiveness."  21 U.S.C.

FDA indicated that the design, format, andcontent of the additional warning required by Section 897.32(c) would be basedon Macro International's report and comments thereon.  60 Fed. Reg. 61,670.</tt><p><p><tt><b>COMMENT</b></tt><p><tt><b>		1.  Beyond FDA's Statutory Authority</b></tt><p><tt>	FDA states that Section 897.32(c) implements the "brief statement"requirement for restricted devices, under which a restricted device isconsidered misbranded unless the manufacturer includes in "all advertisementsand other descriptive printed matter issued... with respectto that device... a brief statement of the intended uses ofthe device and relevant warnings, precautions, side effects, andcontra-indications."  21 U.S.C. [[section]]352(r).</tt><p><tt>	The proposed "warning" requirement for cigarettes, however, is not a"warning," nor is it part of a "brief statement," as those terms are used inthe FDCA.  The misbranding provision on which FDA relies is among the "generalcontrols" applicable to a medical device that may be "sufficient to providereasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device."  21 U.S.C.[[section]]360c(a)(1)(A)(i).  If general controls by themselves areinsufficient to provide such assurance, a device may be required to comply with"special controls" or with the premarket approval procedure for devices.Id. [[section]]360c(a)(1)(B) and (C).</tt><p><tt>	FDA proposes to allow cigarettes to be marketed as devices subject only togeneral controls, one of which is the "brief statement" provision.  Therefore,the "brief statement" must be capable of providing-- with other generalcontrols-- reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness ofcigarettes.  Yet FDA regards cigarettes as having "dangerous healthconsequences," 60 Fed. Reg. 41,349, and does not believe that cigarettes are"safe and effective" for anyone, no matter which, or how many, general devicecontrols are applied to them.  It follows that the "brief statement," includingany words characterized by FDA as a "warning," are not, in fact, within thescope of the brief statement provision.</tt><p><tt>	More broadly, it is apparent from the underlying purpose of the deviceregulation provisions of FDCA that all requirements for a device that islawfully marketed presuppose that the device, if marketed in accordance withthe requirements, is a safe and effective therapeutic product.  Construing the"warning" in Section502(r) in accordance with that purpose, the wordrefers to a strong precautionary statement needed to allow a device to bemarketed safely.  But FDA does not believe any warning will make cigarettessafe for anyone to use.  The only "warning" that is consistent with FDA's viewwould be one that warned against anyone using the device at all.  But if thatwarning were required as a general control, it would follow that cigarettesshould not be marketed.  That would mean they would be subject to being bannedunder Section516 of the FDCA.</tt><p><tt>	Even assuming FDA could validly require a "brief statement" for cigarettesas an exercise of its FDCA authority, the imposition of a "warning" requirementas part of the brief statement is invalid for the further reason thatadvertisements for cigarettes are already required to bear a "Surgeon General'sWarning" consisting of one of four statements, which the manufacturer isrequired to rotate.  15 U.S.C. [[section]]1333(a)(2) and (3).  Themisbranding requirement of the FDCA applies if the advertisement for arestricted device fails to bear a statement of "relevant warnings,precautions, side effects, and contraindications."  In the case of cigarettes,Congress has determined that the required warnings under the FCLAA constitutethe only "relevant" information that is necessary for potential users to know.Accordingly, no cigarette product whose advertisements comply with the FCLAA's"Surgeon General's Warning" requirement can be deemed by FDA to be misbrandedfor failure to bear a "brief statement of... relevantwarnings."  FDA is not free to require additional "brief" information simplybecause the Agency believes it is within the limitless universe of what may, bysome standards, be considered "relevant," or because FDA disagrees withCongress' determination that the statutory warnings are "adequate."  See15 U.S.C. [[section]]1331.  See discussion of FCLAA preclusion ofFDA's proposed regulations in Volume VI.</tt><p><tt>	Even assuming FDA could require any "brief statementof... warning" information at all, the Agency is notauthorized to require that the information be presented in a lurid fashion toachieve an ulterior purpose.  The warning requirements prescribed under theFDCA are intended to identify noteworthy risks arising from the use of a drugor device that is otherwise safe and effective for the patient under theintended conditions of use.  The warning information, therefore, is meant onlyfor the purposes of enabling the physician or patient to make a rationalrisk/benefit judgment.</tt>"10" [8  Informationnot of that character is not within the meaning of "warning," as that word isused in the FDCA.<p>	What FDA proposes to require is thus not a "warning" but a kind of visualdenaturement --not a warning intended to provide information compatible with the safe use of alegal product, but instead a kind of threat designed to scare people into notusing a product FDA thinks should not be sold at all.  This improperpurpose--which prevents any of the so-called"warning" statements under consideration from being within the meaning of theword "warning" under the FDCA --is especially prominent in the "AIDS, alcohol, ... combined"statement that the focus groups are said to have identified as "effective."  Itmay be "effective," in the sense of being dramatic, but the statement does notconstitute a "brief statement of... warning." <p>	There is no evidence in the record to support any conclusion that either thestatement FDA included in the regulation or any of the ones favored by theparticipants in the FDA focus groups would be an "effective" warning.  Indeed,these statements could prove to be counterproductive.9  The "AIDS, alcohol, . .. combined" statement is not, in fact, intended to provide information tofacilitate a rational decision.  Instead, as an arbitrary list of frighteningevents, it is an attempt to overcome the human thought process completely toachieve an agenda FDA has set for itself.  FDA is not legally permitted toengage in this sort of propaganda by calling it a "brief statement."]<p><tt><b>		2.  Precluded by ADAMHA and FCLAA</b></tt><p><tt>	For the reasons stated in connection with Section 897.30(a)(1),Section897.32(c) is precluded by the ADAMHA Reorganization Act of 1992and the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act.  FDA's attempt togather information through the focus group studies about adolescents'perceptions of the adequacy of the Surgeon General's warning for use indesigning its own additional warning, see 60 Fed. Reg. 61,672-73,only underscores the direct conflict between FCLAA and the proposedregulation.</tt><p><tt>	Moreover, the contention that the Surgeon General's warning is"ineffective" is without merit.  As Young &amp; Moschis have commented in theircritique of a study that advanced a similar thesis:</tt><p><tt>"We do not see much practical difference between knowing that one of theSurgeon General's warnings is in an advertisement and knowing which one it is.One could analogize the warning box to an oversized `union bug' that instantlymarks the work as a product of union labor but requires closer scrutiny toidentify the union local that did the job.  Another analogy, though perhapsironic, might be to the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval.  You know it themoment you see it, and you know what it signifies --without necessarily knowing what it actually says."</tt><p><p><tt>"One could not reasonably conclude that the Surgeon General's warnings are`ineffective' (in the authors' terms) simply because, confronted with anuninterrupted sequence of tobacco advertisements, the subjects in the studyfocused on the warning only in the initial exposures and then stopped once they`got the idea.' </tt><p><p><tt>	*   *   * </tt><p><p><tt>"Since nearly all adolescents believe smoking is dangerous, and presumablyrecognize the warning box in tobacco advertisements, one would not expect themto focus specifically on the Surgeon General's warning in every tobaccoadvertisement to which they are exposed.  To the contrary, given their nearlyuniversal awareness of the warning messages, it would be surprising ifadolescents paused to read the messages anew each time they saw a tobaccoadvertisement --regardless of any sequence used.  It simply is not an efficient use of one'stime to study a message with which one is already familiar.  Our research hasconsistently shown that material familiar to readers tends to be quicklybypassed.</tt><p><p><tt>"The fact that relatively little time was spent focusing on the SurgeonGeneral's warnings therefore can be understood to signify that the warnings areindeed extremely `effective.'  The subjects did not need to linger on thewarnings because their message already was familiar.  The fact that theadolescents participating in the study focused specifically on the SurgeonGeneral's warning in 56.4 percent of the exposures can be interpreted asindicating that they examined the advertisements with special care."</tt>"12" [10 <p>]<p><tt><b>		3.  First Amendment</b></tt><p><tt>	Section 897.32(c) would violate the First Amendment because its purposeand function are not to prevent cigarette advertising from being deceptive, butrather to enlist cigarette advertising as a vehicle for disseminating FDA-sponsoredmessages that are intended to dissuade children from smoking.  In effect,Section 897.32(c) is a complement to Section897.29.  The former wouldrequire cigarette manufacturers to propagandize against the use of theirproducts within the four corners of their advertising; the latter would requirethe manufacturers to propagandize against the use of their products in stand-alonemessages.</tt><p><tt>	Both requirements would violate the First Amendment.  Indeed, the SecondCircuit has commented on "the patent First Amendment problems" presented by aNew York City ordinance that, just like Sections 897.29 and 897.32(c), wouldhave conditioned the right to advertise cigarettes on the advertiser'swillingness to run additional antismoking messages.  Vango Media, Inc.v. City of New York, 34 F.3d 68, 71 (2d Cir. 1994).</tt><p><tt>	The Supreme Court has long held that speech can be compelled only toprevent or remedy deception.  See Virginia State Board ofPharmacy, 425 U.S. 748, 771-72n.24 (1976) (state may "require that a commercial message appear in such aform, or include such additional information, warnings, and disclaimers, asare necessary to prevent its being deceptive") (emphasis added); Inre R.M.J., 455 U.S. 191, 201 (1982) ("warning or disclaimer might beappropriately required...in order to dissipate thepossibility of consumer confusion or deception") (emphasis added);Ibanez v. Florida Board of Accountancy, 114 S. Ct. 2084, 2090(1994) (reserving judgment whether, on another record, the challenged compelledspeech might be justified "as an appropriately tailored check against deceptionor confusion") (emphasis added).</tt><p><tt>	Furthermore, the First Amendment protects commercial speech from thechilling effects of unjustified or unduly burdensome disclosure requirements.See Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel, 471 U.S.626, 651 (1985) ("We recognize that unjustified or unduly burdensome disclosurerequirements might offend the First Amendment by chilling protected commercialspeech.").  Section 897.32(c) is such a requirement.  First, as discussed inconnection with Section 897.29 in Volume VI, teenagers already believe smokingis harmful to their health, and thus FDA cannot justify compelling disclosureof the supposed risks of smoking on the ground that teenagers would otherwisebe deceived.  Second, some of the formats for the additional warning that FDAis considering -- e.g., placing the warning in the middle of theadvertisement,</tt>"13" [11 in neon colors,12and/or in a highly stylized border13 -- would clearly be so burdensome as to"offend the First Amendment" for that reason alone.  <p>	Indeed, given the text-only,black-and-whiterequirement of Section 897.32(a), the additional warning statement required bySection 897.32(c) might very well be the ]<tt>only feature of acigarette advertisement that would draw a viewer's attention.  That may beFDA's intention, but the inhibiting effect of the two requirements is obvious.</tt><p><tt>	The Court has also repeatedly held that the First Amendment protectsprivate parties --including corporations --from being forced to disseminate messages of others against their wishes.See Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. v.

Focus Groups Are Not a Tool</h4><tt><b>				for Generating Reliable Data</b></tt><p><tt></tt><p><tt>	Any attempt by the Agency to rely on the "results" of itshastily-conductedfocus groups to justify its proposed new warnings will be unavailing.  First,such focus groups cannot be used to test specific warnings.  Rather, they areintended to be used in the preliminary phases of experimental design, such asthe formulation of questions for a survey.  See Viscusi Comments at 2,3, in Volume VIII.  Indeed, the survey firm retained by FDA recognized thelimitations of its focus groups in its report to the Agency:</tt><p><tt>"This study cannot be considered reliable or valid in a statistical sensesince the recruiting of participants cannot be replicated, nor can themoderator ask the same questions of other respondents.</tt><p><p><tt>	*    *    *  </tt><p><p><tt>"Certain biases are inherent in this type of study and are stated here toremind the reader that focus group data cannot be projected to any universe ofindividuals.</tt><p><p><tt>	*    *    *  </tt><p><p><tt>"Finally, the reader is reminded that this report is intended primarily toclarify cloudy issues and point the direction for future research, and thatdata here cannot be projected to a universe of similar respondents."  60 Fed.Reg. 61,672.</tt><p><h4>b.	  FDA Cannot Rely on the Focus Group Studies</h4><tt></tt><p><tt>	Quite apart from these general limitations of focus groupstudies, FDA's incomplete disclosure of the data generated by, and relating to,the specific focus groups who hastily reviewed the Agency's new "warnings" barsFDA from using those "results" at all:  "It is not consonant with the purposeof a rule-making proceeding to promulgate rules on the basis of inadequatedata, or on data that... is known only to the agency."Portland Cement Association v. Ruckelshaus, 486 F.2d 375, 393(D.C. Cir. 1973), cert. denied, 417 U.S. 921 (1974).  In thiscase, FDA refused to disclose a great deal of information essential to a fairevaluation of the "results" of the focus groups.</tt><p><tt>	For example, the transcripts of the focus group sessions that FDA has madepublic identify each adolescent speaker merely as "PARTICIPANT"-- adesignation that prevents the proper tabulation or consideration of the"results."  Some people are more expressive than others; for all the publicknows, only one or two of the participants may have done most of the talking inany given focus group session.  See, e.g., Transcript ofFocus Group Studies, October 24, 1995, 4:30 p.m., Charlotte, NC, at 49(moderator tells a participant, "you are the only one I can count on totalk").</tt>"36" [17  <p>	FDA similarly has not disclosed the questionnaires that the focus groupparticipants completed at the end of each session.  Those questionnaires askedfor information about "smoking status, number of cigarettes smoked, brandssmoked, and other relevant information."  60 Fed. Reg. 61,677; 61,679.  One ofthe moderators admitted the relevance of these questionnaires to preparing thereport on the focus group sessions.  Transcript of Focus Group Studies, October25, 1995, 6:30 p.m., Charlotte, NC, at 78.<p>	FDA has also failed to specify the props that the different focus groupmoderators used, such as sample cigarette advertising and sample borders forthe proposed new warning messages.  ]<tt>See 60 Fed. Reg. 61,677.Without such specification, much of the participants' discussion of the effectsof the position, design and color of a warning message in relation to theunderlying cigarette advertisement is incomprehensible.</tt><p><tt>	In addition, FDA has not disclosed either the audiotapes or the videotapesthat were made of each focus group session.  The report prepared by MacroInternational acknowledges the importance of the information contained in thesetapes:</tt><p><tt>"This report cannot accurately detail the wealth of information in thenon-verbalarea, such as `body language,' (posture, sleepiness, wiggling in the chair,etc.) or the amount of time elapsed between questions from the moderator andactual responses from the group.  It also cannot report on the subtle area of`peer pressure' -- the willingness to avoid making a particular responsebecause of fear of what others in the group might think, or quickly changing aresponse when others in the group appear to oppose a particularposition."</tt><p><p><tt>60 Fed. Reg. 61,672 (emphasis added).  Nor do the transcripts revealwhether participants were silently nodding or shaking their heads in responseto another participant's remarks.  FDA has made no attempt to disclose any ofthe "wealth of information in the non-verbal area" to the public.  Furthermore,the transcripts released by FDA report many remarks simply as "inaudible."  Thepublic is entitled to hear FDA's tape recordings of the focus group sessions tojudge for itself whether these remarks are truly "inaudible."</tt><h4>c.	  The Focus Groups Were Flawed in Design</h4><tt>	By commissioning focus groups only on the narrow question of whichproposed warning message and which designs the participants believedwould be "effective," FDA biased the groups toward endorsing the idea thatsome sort of additional warning would be useful and away from anydiscussion of alternatives to additional warning messages.  FDA retained MacroInternational "to conduct a series of focus groups with adolescents to compareand evaluate brief statements directed to teens that address the risks ofsmoking."  60 Fed. Reg. 61,670.  The purpose of these groups was thus quitelimited:</tt><p><tt>"The purpose of the first series of groups . . . was to examine a number ofbrief statements about smoking to determine which of several kinds of messagesteens found most compelling.  The purpose of the second series of focus groups. . . was to evaluate a shortened list of messages and consider methods ofpresentation that would be most effective in informing teens about the risks ofsmoking."</tt><p><p><tt>Id.</tt><p><tt>	Neither series of groups had as its purpose to determine what sortsof measures teenagers believed would be most effective in reducing underagetobacco use.  Indeed, FDA has not conducted focus group studies aboutany aspect of the proposed rules aside from the design of the briefstatement specified in Section897.32(c).  Even as to the brief statement,FDA did not commission focus group studies to determine whether awarning message was called for, but only to determine which particularwarning message should be required.  </tt><p><tt>	The limited scope of discussion anticipated for the focus groups isapparent in the moderator's guides for each of the two series of groups.  Themoderator's guide for the first series of groups scheduled no discussion at allof such issues as why teenagers begin smoking, why they continue to smoke, orwhat sorts of measures would most effectively discourage them from smoking.See 60 Fed. Reg. 61,677.  Although the moderator's guide for the secondseries called for a discussion of why young people begin smoking, the guidetreats any discussion of this fundamental issue as mere chatter:</tt><p><tt>"This is a warmup activity.  Questions below are suggestions, notrequirements.  You don't need to ask every question. . . . Should take about5-10 minutes."</tt><p><p><tt>60 Fed. Reg. 61,678.  Instead, treating as a given that someadditional warning message should be required, the heart of the second seriesof focus groups was the artistic design of the warning message.  This wasexplored in mind-numbingdetail through a series of questions which constitutes roughly half of thequestions the moderators were instructed to ask.  </tt><p><tt>	Yet despite this clear bias, the participants' answers repeatedlyconfirmed that it is the teenager's peers, and not cigaretteadvertising, that influence a teenager's decision to smoke or not to smoke.Indeed, this point of view was urged more frequently than any other in thefocus group discussions.  See 60 Fed. Reg. 61,673 ("The major reasonsgiven for why teens try smoking included:  . . .  being around parents, otherfamily members and friends who smoke.").  </tt><p><tt>	As FDA's own consultants have explained, the proper use of the results offocus group discussions is "to clarify cloudy issues and point the directionfor future research."  60 Fed. Reg. 61,672.  But FDA apparently does not intendto conduct any additional research:  "FDA will use the report, as well ascomments submitted on the report, to determine the design, format, and contentof the brief statement when preparing a final rule."  60 Fed. Reg. 61,670.  Thepurpose that the focus group studies apparently will serve is to allow theAgency to point to statements by teenagers that one or another warning messagewould be "effective."  </tt><p><tt>	That some participants, forced to focus for an hour on the minutiae ofparticular warning messages and designs, said that they believed that some ofthe warning messages might be "effective" thus means little or nothing.  FDA'srestriction of the discussion to the particular content and design elements ofvarious warning messages virtually ensured that out of 149 focus groupparticipants some number would opine that an additional warning would be"effective."  Had FDA allowed the focus groups freely to discuss the broaderquestion of how to reduce underage smoking by whatever means seemed best tothem, it is doubtful that any participant would have suggestedadding an additional warning message to cigarette advertising.</tt><h4>d.	  The Sessions Were Flawed in Execution</h4><tt><b>	</b>	Not only did the overall plan for conducting the focus groupstudies bias the results toward FDA's pre-conceivedview that an additional warning would be useful, the moderators themselvesbiased the discussions in ways quite apart from the design of the sessions.See Comments of Drs. Edward V. Morse, Howard J. Osofsky, and Patricia M.Simon, submitted in Volume VIII of these comments.</tt><h4>e.		The Focus Group Results Undermine</h4><tt><b>				FDA's Assumptions                </b></tt><p><tt></tt><p><tt>	Despite the limitations that FDA built into the design ofthe focus group studies, a plethora of measures for reducing underage smoking,other than by means of an additional warning message, were proposed.  When amoderator departed from the script prescribed by the moderator's guide andasked participants what they would do to reduce underage smoking, participantssuggested strengthening access restrictions</tt>"36" [18 and encouraging parents to teach theirchildren not to smoke.19  In another session, one participant spontaneouslysuggested that suspending students from school athletics for using tobaccoproducts would be far more effective than an additional warning.20  Conversely,many participants flatly denied that warning messages would have]<tt>any effect on underage tobacco use.</tt>"45" [21  However, none of these statements hasapparently caused FDA to rethink the limited scope of the focus group studiesit had commissioned. <p>	The majority of the statements made during the focus group sessions alsocontradict the fundamental assumption on which FDA has based]<tt>all of its proposed advertising restrictions -- that cigaretteadvertising influences teenagers' decision to smoke.  FDA's own consultantsconcluded that peer pressure, rebelliousness, family influence, and curiosity-- not cigarette advertising -- were among the primary reasons thatparticipants gave for why adolescents begin smoking.  60 Fed. Reg. 61,673.FDA's consultants acknowledged that "[m]ost of the participants indicated thatthey did not believe that they were influenced by cigarette advertisements."60 Fed. Reg. 61,674.  It is indeed telling that these conclusions emergeddespite the Agency's attempt to steer the focus group discussions towardblaming underage smoking on cigarette advertising.</tt><p><tt>	Indeed, one colloquy suggests that, to the limited extent any of theparticipants said that cigarette advertising influenced underage people tosmoke, they simply may have been uncritically repeating what they have heardfrom the media.  Thus, in the following exchange, the moderator asked theparticipants whom cigarette advertising "targeted":</tt><p><tt>		"PARTICIPANT:  Smoking Joe has probably got his cartoon towardskids.</tt><p><p><tt>		"MODERATOR BRYANT:  So, you think that's toward kids too?</tt><p><p><tt>		"PARTICIPANT:  Yes, that's true, because I read something that JoeCamel influences younger kids, like my [seven year-old]brother, it's a cartoon, if you saw Roger Rabbit or Bugs Bunny or whoeversmoking, you would think, oh, you know, he's smoking."</tt><p><p><tt>Transcript of Focus Group Studies, November 1, 1995, 4:30 p.m., Houston,TX, at 42 (emphasis added).  This participant may have read that JoeCamel influences children like his brother; but the rest of the colloquyindicates that his own personal experience -- as distinct from what he read --suggests that Joe Camel has not in fact influenced his little brother tosmoke.</tt><h4>f.		The Proposals That Were Forced from the</h4><tt><b>				Focus Groups Should Not Be Adopted     </b></tt><p><p><tt>	As Kip Viscusi explains in his comments on the focus group results (VolumeVIII), the proposed warning, "Tobacco kills more Americans each year than AIDS,alcohol, accidents, murder, suicides, illegal drugs and fires . . . combined,"as well as the proposed "1 out of 3 kids . . . will die" warning are likely toskew young people's perceptions of risk.  Indeed, this problems was not lost onthe focus group participants.</tt>"46" [22  Andthey will not be lost on teenagers looking to FDA for an excuse to engage inrisky behavior. <p>	The overpoweringly prominent design elements that a few of the focus groupparticipants "recommended" imply that ]<tt>any activity, no matterhow risky, must be safer than smoking.  As Dr. Viscusi noted in his comments,brightly colored warnings are rarely encountered in hazard communication exceptin connection with the most extreme, immediate risks, such as the explosiverisk presented by TNT and jagged-edged boxes are entirely unprecedented.See Comments of W. Kip Viscusi, submitted in Volume VIII of thesecomments.  </tt><p><tt>	Moreover, the flashy designs proposed for the new FDA warning would sendunintended messages when juxtaposed with the congressionally-mandatedSurgeon General's warning.  If FDA indeed adopts the view that "the new briefstatement should be more visually prominent than the Surgeon General'swarning," 60 Fed. Reg. 61,674, the additional warning will imply that themessage presented in the Surgeon General's warning is less important than themessage presented in FDA's warning.  For at least one warning message thatfound favor with a few of the focus groups -- "Tobacco causes shortness ofbreath, coughing, yellow teeth and wrinkles" -- this would have the perverseeffect of emphasizing mere cosmetic risks over warnings about serious healthrisks.  That would be poor science --and even poorer public policy.</tt><p><p><tt><b>	[[section]] 897.32(c)--Ingredient Disclosure inAdvertising</b></tt><p><tt>	FDA has decided not to invoke Section502(r)(2)to require the disclosure of cigarette components or ingredients inadvertising.  60 Fed. Reg. 41,338-41,339.  This decision is proper, because,even assuming cigarettes would be restricted devices, a regulation requiringdisclosure under the FDCA would be precluded by the explicit confidentialityrequirements of the FCLAA, 15 U.S.C. [[section]]1335a.  Such arequirement also would be inconsistent with the trade secret protectionsafforded foods, drugs and cosmetics by Congress and by FDA, and could subjectthe government to liability under the Takings Clause.</tt><p><p><tt><b>[[section]] 897.34--Sale and Distribution of NontobaccoItems,</b></tt><p><tt><b>		and Services, Contests and Games of Chance,</b></tt><p><tt><b>		and Sponsorship ofEvents&nsp;</b></tt><p><tt></tt><p><tt>	Section897.34 would ban the use of tobacco brand nameson nontobacco products (e.g., tee shirts, caps, lighters)([[section]]897.34(a)); ban coupon-redemption and similar offers, as wellas promotional contests, lotteries and games ([[section]]897.34(b)); andban brand-name event sponsorships (while continuing to allow corporatesponsorships if the tobacco company's name was extant on January 1, 1995)([[section]]897.34(c)).</tt><p><tt><b>COMMENT</b></tt><p><tt>	As discussed below, Section 897.34 is beyond FDA's authorityunder the FDCA, is not supported by the evidence, and would violate theConstitution.  In addition, for the reasons stated above in connection withSection 897.30(a)(1), Section 897.34 is precluded by the ADAMHA ReorganizationAct of 1992 and the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act.</tt>"49" [23]<tt></tt><p><tt><b>		1.  Section897.34(a)</b></tt><p><tt>	FDA proposes in Section897.34(a) to prohibit the sale,distribution, or licensing of all nontobacco items and services that bear acigarette brand name, logo, motto, or any other product characteristic.  In thepreamble, FDA explains that this requirement is intended to reach such items as"tee shirts, caps, and sporting goods" and other items bearing cigarette brandnames or other "indicia of product identification."  60 Fed. Reg. 41,336.  TheAgency asserts that the ban is necessary to prevent wearers or users of theseitems from becoming "walking advertisements."  Id.</tt><p><tt><b>			a.  Beyond FDA's Statutory Authority</b></tt><p><tt>	FDA has no authority to ban the items and services coveredby Section897.34(a).  Items and services bearing indicia of tobaccoproduct identification are not "foods," "drugs," "cosmetics," or "devices" asdefined in the FDCA, and thus are outside the Agency's jurisdiction.  21 U.S.C.[[section]]321(f), (g), (h), (i).  Moreover, because items such as hatsand tee shirts are not medical devices, they are not subject to regulation asrestricted devices under Section 520(e).  Nor can the proposed ban be justifiedas a restriction on the "sale, distribution, or use" of a restricted medicaldevice under Section520(e).  That provision covers only sale ordistribution of the device itself, and does not apply to "offers to sell" orother advertisements, and certainly not to other uses of the brand name.</tt><p><tt>	The proposed ban also extends far beyond the reach of FDA's authority toregulate "labeling."  FDA's labeling authority extends only to "labels andother written, printed, or graphic matter (1) upon any article or any ofits containers or wrappers, or (2)accompanying such article."  21U.S.C. [[section]]321(m) (emphasis added).  FDA obviously has noauthority to regulate "services" as "labeling."  </tt><p><tt>	Nontobacco items could constitute "labeling" only, as the Supreme Courthas held, if there were a "textual relationship" between them and the product.Kordel, 335 U.S. at 350.  This relationship exists when an item(1)physically "accompan[ies]" the product in the stream of interstatecommerce (Section201(m)) or is distributed through the same commercialchannels as the product, and (2)"supplements or explains" theproduct in the same "manner that a committee report of the Congress accompaniesa bill."  Id. (emphasis added).  Nothing in the proposed rule limits itsscope to items that meet this test.  Items that provide no more substantiveinformation than a "brand name," "logo," or "recognizable color or pattern ofcolors" simply do not explain the use of the product, and therefore do notconstitute labeling.  Such items are not included in the Agency's comprehensivelist of items that are labeling.  See 21 C.F.R.[[section]]202.1(l)(2) (1995).  Kordel's discussion of the natureand function of labeling makes it ludicrous for FDA to assert that everyphysical object bearing a product brand name or logo is "labeling," includingstationery with a company logo as a letterhead, a calling card, a deliverytruck, or a coffee mug.  </tt><p><tt>	Nor can these nontobacco items be regulated as "advertising" in the wayFDA proposes.  </tt><p><tt>	First, FDA can prohibit only false or misleading advertising underSection502(q).  There is nothing false or misleading about a hat with acigarette brand name or logo on it.  </tt><p><tt>	Second, FDA cannot dictate the media in which cigarettes can beadvertised, for the reasons discussed in our comments on proposedSection897.30, which are hereby incorporated by reference.</tt><p><tt>	Third, the proposal extends to goods and services provided toproduct users in connection with cigarette purchases, most of which are notdisplayed or disseminated to the general public, and thus do not constitute"advertising."  See Marcyanv. Nissen Corp., 578F.Supp. 485, 507 (N.D. Ind. 1982), aff'd sub nom.Marcyanv. Marcy Gymnasium Equip. Co., 725 F.2d 687 (7thCir. 1983) (holding that material provided to product user in connection withproduct purchase was not advertising where there was no showing that material"was ever made available to the general purchasing public").  </tt><p><tt>	Fourth, many of the types of items covered bySection897.34(a) are promotional items, but not advertising.  Forexample, a logo-bearingmug given away or sold by a manufacturer is not an "advertisement."  </tt><p><tt>	For all the above reasons, FDA lacks statutory authority to adoptSection897.34(a).  </tt><p><tt><b>			b.  Unjustified</b></tt><p><tt>	FDA's proposed ban on nontobacco items bearing productidentification would be arbitrary, irrational and unconnected to any authorityin the FDCA.  FDA's "rationale" for the rule is as follows:  "Some items, whenused or worn by young people, also create a new advertising medium-- the`walking billboard'-- which can come into schools or other locationswhere advertising is usually prohibited."  60 Fed. Reg. 41,336.  This"rationale" fails to support the proposed ban for the following reasons:  (1)FDA has no authority to prohibit "new advertising media"; (2)people(including some under age 18) do not wear such items in order to advertiseanything; rather, they wear them to make a public statement, because they findthe items aesthetically pleasing or for other reasons-- thus, as a matterof fact, such items are not "walking billboards"; (3)FDA has no statutoryauthority to prohibit or regulate the attire of adults, school students, oranyone else; and (4) FDA has presented no evidence that either wearing orseeing such items causes young people to smoke.  Indeed, even the data uponwhich FDA relies-- which, as discussed below, are in any event highlyunreliable-- show that a substantial number of nonsmokers--25percent in one study and 28percent in the other-- ownbranded clothing.  60 Fed. Reg. 41,336.  Thus, even FDA's own data areinconsistent with its "finding" that a sweeping prohibition on brandednontobacco items is essential to reduce youth smoking.</tt><p><tt>	In addition, Section 897.34(a) would unlawfully constrain the separate anddistinct activity of trademark diversification in connection with products thatare unrelated to the marketing of tobacco products by cigarette manufacturers.As Ulf Bernitz, Dean of the Law Faculty, Stockholm University, has stated,"general bans on logo licensing involving tobacco products would beincompatible with long-established principles of international trade-marklaw."</tt>"53" [24<p>	FDA mistakenly assumes that the use of such trademarks in a nontobacco contextis automatically an indirect means of advertising or promoting tobaccoproducts.  But trademark diversification is not necessarily a promotionaltechnique.  Rather, it may serve as a means of exploiting a trademark that hasbecome known and therefore has value.<p>	It is an increasingly common practice in many industries to "spin off" newproducts by marketing them under a trademark that has acquired some cachet.Such licensed products are not marketed in an effort to sell the "root"product.  Rather, the trademark has some "detachable" qualities that help builddemand for the licensed goods.  Many companies have thus sought to capitalizeon the power of strong, well-known trademarks.25<p>	Thus, Coca-Cola has licensed its soft drink trademark for use in connectionwith a line of clothing.  Jaguar, an automobile manufacturer, allows itstrademark to be used for wallets and pens.  The Porsche automobile trademark isused on sunglasses and leather goods.  Cartier, the jewelers, have licensedcigarettes, lighters and watches, while Dunhill, famous for pens, also makescigarettes.  Internationally known clothing designers such as Giorgio Armani,Calvin Klein, Yves St. Laurent and Ralph Lauren have licensed their names foruse on products ranging from eyeglasses and underwear to umbrellas andbedsheets.<p>	Few would maintain that these companies are attempting to market thesuccessful products that originally carried these valuable trademarks bycausing those trademarks to appear on other products.  Advertisements forcologne under the "Polo" trademark seldom are decried as "indirectadvertisements" for "Polo" shirts or jeans.  Such trademark diversification is,instead, a standard attempt to sell a new brand in one product category bytaking advantage of a trademark made popular in another-- a trademarkthat has come to be associated with the various hallmarks of quality.  The sameis true of marketing a nontobacco product under the trademark of a tobaccoproduct.<p>	FDA fails to cite any evidence that the use of a tobacco trademark on anontobacco product has ]<tt>any impact on tobacco consumption, muchless consumption by young people.  The Agency mentions a limited survey showingthat some students own branded clothing; but FDA fails to provide any rationalbasis for assuming that the existence of such clothing causes smokinginitiation among young people.</tt>"56" [26Because of the speculative nature of such proposals, the Supreme Court ofCanada invalidated the Canadian ban on the licensing of tobacco trademarks,after finding that there is no direct or indirect evidence of "any causalconnection between the objective of decreasing tobacco consumption and theabsolute prohibition on the use of a tobacco trademark on articles other thantobacco products."  ]<tt>RJR MacDonald, Inc.v. Canada(Attorney General), 1995 S.C.R. No.68, at 159.  FDA's proposallikewise must fail.  </tt><p><tt>	There is, in short, no justification for treating cigarette manufacturersany differently than manufacturers of other products.  As makers of legalproducts with substantial consumer recognition, cigarette manufacturers shouldnot be denied the opportunity to capitalize on that recognition and todiversify the use of their product name because of FDA's ill-conceived andempirically unsupported notions that condemn anything associated with tobacco.</tt><p><tt><b>		2.  Section897.34(b)</b></tt><p><tt><b>			a.  Beyond FDA's Statutory Authority</b></tt><p><tt>	Contests, lotteries, and games of chance plainly are notwithin the scope of the FDCA.  They are not FDA-regulatedproducts defined in Section201; and they are not "labeling."  Seecomments in this Volume, Section A.2, supra.  Thus, they are beyondFDA's authority to regulate.</tt><p><tt>	Nor can FDA ban contests and lotteries as a restriction on the "sale,distribution, or use" of a device under Section520(e), because they arenot devices and do not constitute the sale, distribution, or use of adevice.</tt><p><tt>	FDA suggests that contests in which participation is based on the purchaseof cigarette products have "the effect of encouraging underage individuals topurchase these products," and then asserts that the Agency has "additionalauthority" under Section520(e) to curtail these practices in order toassure the effectiveness of its restrictions on sales to people under 18.  60Fed. Reg. 41,350.  However, existing laws and regulations in most jurisdictionsalready prohibit sweepstakes where participation is conditioned onproduct purchases.  Moreover, FDA has not documented any causal connectionbetween contests open to adult smokers and youth purchases of cigarettes; theAgency's assertion is pure speculation.  Moreover, FDA cannot regulate generaladvertising practices under Section520(e) for the reasons stated above.The proposed ban is also overbroad in that it prohibits adults fromparticipating in lawful contests.  </tt><p><tt>	FDA laments that "because contests and lotteries are usually conductedthrough the mail, the Agency has not been able to devise regulations that wouldreduce a young person's access to contests or lotteries."  60 Fed. Reg. 41,336.But such a proffered concern does not authorize the Agency to ban theseactivities.  To the extent that the participation of minors in these activitiesis a problem-- and there is no evidence that it is a problem-- theStates already have ample power to regulate them.  </tt><p><tt><b>			b.  Unjustified</b></tt><p><tt>	The Agency's rationale for proposed Section 897.34(b)necessarily begins with the proposition that young people participate in suchevents.  The Agency has put into the record no data to support thatproposition, which is flatly inconsistent with the terms under which such gamesare conducted-- participation in such games is expressly limited tosmokers who are 21 or older.  The proposition, therefore, is entirelyspeculative.  FDA has no relevant expertise that enables it to assert theproposition credibly without supporting data.</tt><p><tt>	Next, the Agency necessarily relies on the proposition that if a personparticipates in such an event his or her participation makes it more likelythat he or she will want to obtain and use cigarettes.  The Agency againpresents no data to support this proposition.</tt><p><tt>	Finally, the Agency necessarily relies on the proposition that if a youngperson participates in such an event, that participation increases thelikelihood not only that the young person will want to purchase and usecigarettes, but also that he or she will in fact do so.  Again, the recordcontains no data that support this speculation.</tt><p><tt>	FDA's proposal to prohibit the promotional techniques identified inSection897.34(b) misunderstands the nature of such activities,misrepresents the appeal of promotions, and assumes without proof thatpromotions induce young people to smoke.  Promotional activities are notundertaken to encourage people, young or old, to smoke.  Rather, promotionalactivities introduce existing smokers to the brand being promoted and providethem with incentives to choose that brand over others.  Promotional activitiesalso maintain awareness of the brand being promoted and "work" only because theconsumer already has decided to use the product category.  There is no evidencethat such activities stimulate smoking.  </tt><p><tt><b>				(1)  Coupons, Premiums, and Promotional Gifts</b></tt><p><tt>	The Agency contends that programs in which nontobacco itemsare provided to consumers in return for proofs of purchase provide "anincentive to purchase the tobacco product," and that banning such programs willcontribute to "substantially reducing the number of young people who beginusing cigarettes or smokeless tobacco products."  60 Fed. Reg. 41,336.  Thereare, however, no data in the record to support these assertions.  Furthermore,the facts concerning these programs are flatly inconsistent with the Agency'sassertions.</tt><p><tt>	First, as with airline "frequent flier" programs, the goal of theseprograms is to reinforce brand loyalty among existing customers, and toexpand market share among existing smokers --not to induce nonsmokers to start smoking.  Frequent-flierprograms do not turn nonfliers into fliers; nor do they induce people to taketrips they would otherwise not take merely to obtain "miles"; rather, theseprograms reward fliers for patronizing the sponsoring airline.</tt><p><tt>	Second, these programs are, by their very nature, aimed at peoplewho already are smokers.  Merchandise is provided only to consumers whohave accumulated and submitted significant numbers of proofs of purchase,typically by regular purchases over an extended period of time.</tt><p><tt>	Third, these programs are plainly aimed at adult smokers.Even the name of the Marlboro program --"Marlboro Miles" --is obviously based on airline "frequent flier" programs, and those programsunquestionably are aimed at an adult audience.  Moreover, as the Agency itselfstates, "[y]oung people have relatively little disposable income."  60 Fed.Reg. 41,336.  It makes little sense to suggest that young people, with "littledisposable income," would be likely to spend the substantial sums required onthe number of packs of cigarettes needed to obtain merchandise under theseprograms, when the same or similar items could be purchased at retail for farless.  It defies common sense to argue, as the Agency does, that such programsare an inducement to young people with "relatively little disposable income" tostart smoking-- and the Agency has provided no data to supportthat argument.</tt><p><tt>	Finally, the companies that sponsor these programs restrictparticipation to adults who are already smokers.  Typically,anyone wishing to redeem proofs of purchase to obtain merchandise through sucha program must sign a certification that he or she is 21 or over, and mustprovide his or her date of birth.  Furthermore, manufacturers have developedand implemented mechanisms to police compliance with these certificationrequirements.  Philip Morris, for example, screens every incoming order forcompliance with the age requirements, and will return to the sender, at thecompany's expense, any order that does not contain a signed certification, orthat does not contain a date of birth, or that contains a date of birthindicating that the sender is under 21.  During the first eight months of 1995,Philip Morris spent some $1.13 million on these screening procedures.  </tt><p><tt>	As noted above, coupons and premiums are examples of marketing tools thatare extensively used to maintain and increase market share.  Manufacturerscannot rely simply on advertising to differentiate their brands from those oftheir competitors, or on the essentially verbal communications that advertisingconveys.  Rather, manufacturers must offer competitive smokers incentives totry their brands.  Such incentives may include discount offers ("cents-off" or"two-for-one" offers) or nontobacco premiums sold with the product.  Suchincentives typically are offered on a temporary basis.  </tt><p><tt>	Such techniques appeal to existing users of the product category.  No onewould be persuaded to start smoking by a cents-off coupon, for example; but asmoker might very well be persuaded to try a particular brand which providedcoupons.  No one would be persuaded to start smoking by the offer of a freecigarette lighter, but a smoker might be tempted by the offer.  In thehard-fought battles for market share among cigarette companies, discounts andpremiums represent a way to promote and retain brand loyalty and to weakenloyalty to competitors' brands.  </tt><p><tt>	Apart from FDA's acknowledged goal simply to restrict smoking, FDA assertsthat "gifts," such as nontobacco items bearing cigarette logos, are a "form ofadvertising [that] is particularly effective with young people."</tt>"58" [27  FDA "would prohibit the sale ordistribution of all non-tobacco items that are identified with a cigarette orsmokeless tobacco product brand name or other identifying characteristic."28Under this proposal, tobacco companies could no longer provide customers with]<tt>any "utilitarian" objects-- caps, cigarette lighters,beverage coolers, beach towels, or tee shirts-- that bear the brand nameor logo of a tobacco product brand.</tt>"59" [29  <p>	The primary basis for this proposed prohibition appears to be data thatallegedly show that 44 percent of teenage smokers and 27 percent of teenagenonsmokers have "received" nontobacco promotional items such as tee shirts,caps, and sunglasses.30  The study that produced these data, however, draws noconclusions as to the significance of these numbers; nor does it indicate howthe teenagers "received" the items (]<tt>e.g., whether theyobtained them from the tobacco company directly, or from a family member orolder friend who had obtained them first).  </tt><p><tt>	FDA cites no studies that demonstrate either that these items areespecially appealing to young people, or that possessing these items causesyoung people to start smoking or to smoke more.</tt>"62" [31  Nevertheless, FDA claims that one studyreports that there is an association between participating in promotions and aperson's "susceptibility" to tobacco use.  60 Fed. Reg. 41,336.  This study,apparently available only in a truncated form as part of a handout at aconference,32 does make that claim, but only after purportedly performingregression analyses, the results of which are neither described thoroughly norexplained.  Slade apparently performed a "logistic regression analysis," usingthe "Pierce Susceptibility Index."  The study, however, neither explains thisregression adequately nor explains the results presented.  Hence, no basis canbe discerned for this conclusion.  The notion of "susceptibility" is itselfproblematic.<p>	Moreover, even if this study is taken at face value, it does not support FDA'sconclusions.  While the study reported that 83.5percent of respondentsage 12 to 17 were "aware" of at least one tobacco company promotion, it alsoreported that only 10.6 percent of respondents owned a nontobacco promotionalitem.33  These numbers do not support the theory that nontobacco items areappealing to youth or have a discernible impact on youth smoking rates.]<p><tt><b>				(2)  Contests and Games</b></tt><p><tt>	FDA's proposed rule also would prohibit all contests,lotteries or games of chance that are "linked" to the purchase of a tobaccoproduct.  60 Fed. Reg. 41,336.  As noted, existing regulations already prohibitconditioning participation in games or lotteries on product purchases.Moreover, FDA offers no evidence that contests, lotteries or games involvingtobacco products have particular appeal to adolescents; in fact, there areno citations at all in the preamble's discussion of this section of theproposed regulations.  FDA has issued this proposed regulation because it"has not been able to devise regulations that would reduce a young person'saccess to contests or lotteries," because, FDA asserts, such contests areusually conducted through the mail.  60 Fed. Reg. 41,336.  FDA's failure tocraft a regulation appropriately tailored to restrict unverified andunquantified participation by youth-- even assuming it has thatauthority-- does not mean that it can ban an entire form of promotiondirected to adults.</tt><p><tt><b>		3.  Section897.34(c)</b></tt><p><tt><b>			a.  No Authority Under the FDCA</b></tt><p><tt>	The Agency has no authority to regulate any aspect,including sponsorship, of athletic, musical, artistic, or other social orcultural events.  By no stretch of legal reasoning is it possible to squeezethese events within the FDCA.  </tt><p><tt>	FDA's proposed regulation cannot be justified as a restriction on the"sale, distribution, or use" of a restricted medical device underSection520(e).  Banning the sponsorship of sports or cultural events isnot justifiable even under FDA's erroneous theory (contested here) thatSection520(e) authorizes the Agency to regulate the "offering for sale"of a restricted device, because sponsorship of an event does not constitute an"offering for sale" of cigarettes.</tt><p><tt>	This proposal suffers from the same defects as (1)the proposed banon "items and services" bearing tobacco product names or "indicia" underSection897.34(a), for the reasons stated in the comments on thatsubsection, and (2)the proposed ban on contests, lotteries, and games ofchance under Section897.34(b), for the reasons stated in the comments onthat subsection.  FDA cannot regulate sponsorships under either the labeling oradvertising provisions of the FDCA.</tt><p><tt>	FDA claims that sponsorship of events provides "embedded advertising," inthat those persons watching the events "repeatedly see the sponsor's brand orcorporate name linked with an event they enjoy."  60 Fed. Reg. 41,336-41,337.Consequently, the Agency intends the proposed rule "to break the link" betweensponsored events and the use of tobacco, and to reduce the "`friendlyfamiliarity' that sponsorships . . . generate among young people."  Id.at 41,338.  </tt><p><tt>	FDA has no statutory authority to regulate cigarette advertising toachieve these purposes.  As described above, FDA can prohibit only false ormisleading restricted device advertising and cannot prohibit advertising thatsimply links a name to a product.  See 21 U.S.C.[[section]]352(q).  In addition, FDA does not present evidence thatpeople under 18 attend the kinds of events sponsored by cigarette companies, orthat sponsorships of events are causally connected to youth smoking.</tt><p><tt><b>			b.  Unjustified</b></tt><p><tt>	The Agency's rationale for its proposed ban on brand namesponsorships relies on a series of propositions that are unsupported.  Therecord contains no data showing that events sponsored by cigarettemanufacturers are directed to young people, that involvement by young people insuch events increases the likelihood that they will want to purchasecigarettes, or that they actually purchase cigarettes as a result.</tt><p><tt>	Cigarette manufacturers have long sponsored events of sporting andartistic interest and importance.  Such sponsorship makes possible events asdiverse as art exhibitions in major or local museums, symphony hall concerts,folk festivals, tennis tours and racing competitions.  Sponsorships providesupport not only in the form of dollars but also in the form of in-kindassistance.  </tt><p><tt>	FDA's proposed ban on brand-name sponsorship in Section897.34(c) isalso an unjustified limitation on the right of private individuals to selecttheir own sponsors.  As Richard Luers, President of New York's MetropolitanMuseum of Art, has observed in connection with prior proposals to ban tobaccosponsorships:</tt><p><tt>"`[P]rivate sector support of the arts involves two basic freedoms ofchoice: the potential grantee may not wish to participate; the grantor may ormay not wish to accept what has been proffered.  </tt><p><p><tt>"These two freedoms serve to rationalize both the business and culturalinterest in terms of the ultimate societal interest.  They need not, in ouropinion, be further curbed in unnecessarily restrictive legislation.'"</tt>"65" [34<p><p>	Sponsorship is a means of enhancing corporate image and brand stability byrepaying the loyalty of consumers and forging relationships with distributors,wholesalers and retailers.  Its benefits are acknowledged by artists,performers, athletes and organizations around the world.35  Brand sponsorshipsdo not cause anyone, young or old, to begin smoking.  Banning brand sponsorshipof cultural and athletic events would have no effect on smoking rates, but itwould have many adverse consequences for sporting and culturalactivities.]<p><tt><b>			(1)  The Benefits of Sponsorship</b></tt><p><tt>	The support that cigarette manufacturers contribute tosponsored events is substantial.  In some cases, cigarette brand sponsorshiphas made the difference in whether the event will be held at all.  Its losswould have severe financial and other consequences for those who depend on it.Replacing so important a source of private funding would be difficult, andfrequently may be impossible.  It is not enough to point to one or two eventswhich, thanks to earlier support, are now economically viable or which coulddraw other sponsors.  One must also consider whether the event could haveachieved its current viability without steady support over the years.  In theabsence of this support, the next event may never have an opportunity to becomeviable.  There are many events that will not be viable if cigarette companysponsorship is no longer available.</tt>"72" [36<p>	Brand sponsorships mean much more than simply providing funds.  Experience andknowledge of mass marketing, for example, can be critical to the success of asporting or artistic event, particularly events with which the general publicis unfamiliar.  In addition to public relations expertise and services,sponsors often provide logistical and operations support and ancillary eventstaffing.  They help create and maintain sound financial management programs toensure the long-term viability of the donee organizations.  They also donatecomputer time, advertising space, construction help, office space andtransportation.  To support the arts, they commission art for display in theworkplace and make lobbies available for exhibits.  ]<p><tt><b>			(2)  Brand-NameSponsorship Bans Are Unjustified</b></tt><p><tt>	The claim that sponsorship is a form of advertising thatinfluences people to smoke is unfounded.  There is no basis for the suppositionthat seeing a cigarette brand name on a racing car, or associating a brand namewith a jazz festival or a tennis tournament, will make anyone start smoking ordissuade anyone from stopping.  It is absurd to suggest that nonsmokers of anyage may be overcome with an irresistible urge to begin smoking simply becausethey occasionally observe an event such as a tennis tournament, a jazzfestival, or a stock car race sponsored under a cigarette brand name.  Asdiscussed above, the evidence shows that even total advertising bans do notresult in reduced smoking.  There is even less reason to believe that a ban onbrand sponsorship would reduce the incidence of smoking.  The cigarettemanufacturers do not sponsor sports or cultural events directed atyouth.</tt><p><tt>	Where it is identified with a brand, sponsorship is an acknowledged toolfor promoting brand awareness.  Marketing professionals agree that brandsponsorship is well-suited to the mature product market, because it is bestemployed to achieve that goal.</tt>"72" [37There is no reason to believe that brand sponsorship has any potential forincreasing the total demand for cigarettes.  As the Western AustralianParliament Legislative Council concluded, "any decision to ban all forms oftobacco advertising, including sports sponsorship, is purely a politicaldecision ... not based upon irrefutable empiricalevidence."38]<p><tt><b>			(3)	The Evidence Cited by FDA Does Not</b></tt><p><tt><b>				Justify the Proposed Ban on Sponsorship</b></tt><p><tt></tt><p><tt>	In order for FDA to justify an outright prohibition oncigarette brand sponsorship, it is not enough to show that children can recallbrands that sponsor events.  Yet that is all FDA has shown.</tt><p><tt>	Conceding that "[e]vidence regarding sponsorship's impact on young peopleis somewhat limited,"</tt>"76" [39 FDA relieson three studies, two unpublished papers presented at an antitobaccoconference, and an unpublished memorandum from an antismoking advocate tomembers of the Australian Parliament, to support the Agency's proposal to banbrand-identifiedsponsorships outright.40  None of the cited papers or the memorandum, however,provides an adequate factual basis for the bans proposed inSection897.34.<p>	]&#176;<tt>	<b>The Slade Papers</b>.  FDA cites two unpublishedpapers byDr.John Slade.  One is cited in support of the propositionthata large percentage of teenagers participate in tobaccocompanypromotions in which proof-of-purchase coupons are exchanged fornontobacco promotional items.</tt>"80" [41  Butthis is a subject on which Dr.Slade himself does not claim expertise.42No summary of the questions he asked respondents is available.  The data reliedupon, and hence hisconclusions, are flawed and unreliable.43  It is plainthat theconclusions he reaches are the product of bias, not science.44<p>	Dr. Slade's study fully deserves the characterization "junk science."  Yet,this research along with a 1992 Gallup poll,45 apparently forms the entirebasis for FDA's conclusion that youth access to nontobacco promotional goods isa problem of sufficient magnitude to justify the total ban of such items.  <p>	The second Slade paper cited by FDA simply purports to quantify the televisionexposure received by tobacco companies through their sponsorship of racingevents.46  The conclusion reached in the paper is that seven percent of theviewing audiences for these races are youths; NASCAR records of the age ofpersons who attend motorsports events show that only 3 percent are youths.47Neither number would constitute a principled basis for outlawing tobaccocompany sponsorship of these races even if every other assumption FDA makesabout the impact of event sponsorship were true.  (None of them is.)<p>	These event attendance figures demonstrate the arbitrary and capricious natureof FDA's proposals.  On the one hand, the Agency concedes that imageadvertising is permissible in publications with a primarily adult readershipbecause "the effect of such advertising on young people would be nominal."  60Fed. Reg. 41,335.  On the other hand, it attempts to measure the impact ofcigarette brand sponsorships (which in any event is not advertising) by usingstatistics on the viewing audience of sponsored motorsport events]<tt>without recognizing that these figures demonstrate the fact thatthe vast majority of viewers of such events are adults.  In fact, the 64.05million underage viewers of the 354 motorsport broadcasts studied representsonly 7 percent of the total viewing audience of those broadcasts.  Thisaverages out to 180,806 underage viewers per event.  These figures are farbelow the 15 percent and two million readership benchmarks that are permittedfor image advertising in print media.</tt><p><tt>	Moreover, FDA makes no attempt to measure the percentage of adolescents inthe live gate of sponsored sports events.  Reliable industry estimates indicatethat the overwhelming percentage of fans attending motorsport events areadult.</tt>"103" [48  It is perhapsunderstandable (but not acceptable) that FDA chose to ignore this evidence socontrary to its proposals.<p>	]&#176;<tt>	<b>The Aitken Study</b>.49  This is the principal studyFDA cites for the proposition that event sponsorships create favorableassociations between the sponsor's product and the event sponsored in the mindof the event viewer.  FDA's conjecture about "friendly familiarity"notwithstanding,</tt>"104" [50 at no point inthis survey did the authors attempt to gauge whether exposure totobacco-sponsored events or teams engendered favorable feelings for tobaccoproducts in the surveyed young people.  This was a study entirely about theeffect of factors such as sex, age and socioeconomic status on awareness ofcigarette sponsorships.  It did not even test the effect of sponsorshipactivities in this country.51  FDA thus apparently engaged in selectivereading.52  Moreover, in its rush to embrace the authors' conclusions, FDA didnot consider whether the study's conclusions make sense-- much lesswhether they were supported by valid data.  <p>	The authors in fact reported that "few of the primary school children]<tt>named Marlboro or John Player Special as being associated withmotor-car racing" (emphasis in original).</tt>"113" [53  Then, without any scientific basis,they sought to get around this awkward fact:  "[t]his suggests that linkages orassociations between brand names (or their visual cues) and exciting sports areoften unconscious or, at the very least, not readily retrieved toconsciousness."54  That astonishingly biased hypothesis was not tested by anyquestions that attempted to probe the "unconscious" or the "consciousness" ofthe interviewees.  The hypothesis assumes its conclusion, is rank speculation,and ignores much more plausible reasons for the inability of youths to namespecific cigarette brands-- ]<tt>e.g., that thisinformation probably was not very important to young viewers</tt>"115" [55; that it simply did not register withthem (even though they were "exposed" to the names); or that, in general,children do not remember brand names of products in which they are notinterested when they are exposed to such brand names in this manner.<p>	]&#176;<tt>	<b>The Ledwith Study</b>.56  FDA cites this study forthe proposition that exposure to tobacco-sponsored sports on television mayincrease the levels of brand awareness among viewers.  This study also fails tocontrol for other sources of information that could result in brand awarenessand thereby affect the study results (e.g., whether a familymember or sibling smokes).</tt>"117" [57  Inaddition, as with the Aitkin study described ]<tt>supra, the resultsof this study cannot automatically be extrapolated to the United States becausethe study was based upon foreign sponsorship and viewership practices, whichdiffer significantly from those in this country.  Finally, even the authoracknowledges that this research does not answer the important question relatingto sponsorship.  As the author notes, no less than one short paragraphafter the passage quoted by FDA in the preamble, "[t]here is a need forfurther investigation to determine whether tobacco sports sponsorshipnot only acts as advertising as defined earlier, but also persuades children tosmoke."</tt>"119" [58  (Emphasis added.)<p>	]&#176;<tt>	<b>The Hoek Study</b></tt>"121" [59  FDA cites this study for theproposition that promotions such as sports sponsorships "do affect those underage 18 by creating associations with events, teams or personalities with whomthey identify," and that such sponsorships have the "potential to increase therate at which young males smoke by negating the ill-effects associated withsmoking."  These are remarkable claims.  They have no scientifically validsupport; and they are wrong.]First, the study has no real relevance to the issue of eventsponsorship and suffers from obvious, significant methodological flaws.  Thisstudy compared the responses of two groups of 100 young boys shown a 15 minutevideo.  The video viewed by one of the groups contained an advertisementpromoting a cigarette company's sponsorship of a sporting event.  Thus, thisstudy reports the supposed effect of a particular advertisement, not theeffects of the types of sponsorships at issue here.  Moreover, as FDA is aware,under existing U.S. law, tobacco companies are not permitted to advertisesponsorships in this fashion.  See 15 U.S.C. [[section]]1335.Thus, this study has no relevance to issues relating to sports and othersponsorships in the United States.</tt><p><tt>	Second, the portion of the conclusion quoted by FDA plainlyoverstates the results of this flawed research.  The authors themselvesemphasized that "non-smokers' general attitudes to smoking were notsignificantly affected by exposure to the sponsorship advertisement."</tt>"122" [60]Third, among the group of smokers, the authors reported thatexposure to the sponsorship advertisement did not affect the smokers' brandchoices.  In the face of these findings, the authors found themselves compelledto caution that "these findings do not, in themselves, constitute a case forlegislation."</tt>"122" [61<p>	]&#176;<tt>	<b>The Gray Memorandum</b>.62  This is a two-pagememorandum from Nigel Gray, the Director of the Anti-Cancer Council ofVictoria, written in 1989 to members of the Australian Parliament.  It is citedfor the proposition that sponsorship affects brand choice among smokers aged12-14.  60 Fed. Reg. 41,338.  FDA's reliance on this document is not onlydisingenuous, but demonstrates that FDA has not evaluated the data on which itpurports to rely.  The problem with this memorandum is the author's confessedbias; moreover, the statistics cited in this study lack any explanation orsupport.  The conclusions stated in the memorandum are at odds with those inthe studies by Aitken and Hoek cited by FDA.  For example, Gray argues that65percent of 10- to 11-year-old Australian boys surveyed "believedthat tobacco sponsorship of sport is advertising for cigarettes."  However,Aitken in his study found that only 4percent of 10- to 11-year-oldsidentified advertising as a component of sports sponsorships by tobaccocompanies.  Similarly, Gray claims that "[i]t's clear that sporting sponsorshipis effective advertising in that it does influence children's brandchoice."  (Emphasis added.)  However, Hoek found no such impact whenthis same phenomenon was studied.  </tt><p><tt>	In sum, the studies relied on by FDA do not provide scientifically validsupport for the conclusion that there is a causal relationship between thepromotional and sponsorship activities banned under Section897.34 and theproblem of underage smoking.  Here, as elsewhere, FDA's marshalling of flawedstudies and its disregard of contrary studies can be explained only bythe Agency's bias and advocacy approach.  It sharply contrasts with thereasoned and even-handedreview of the data that one would expect from an agency that is seeking to findthe facts, rather than seeking to cite scraps of data to support a conclusionalready adopted.</tt><p><tt>	Section897.34(c) is unauthorized by the FDCA, and is arbitrary,irrational, and unsupported by evidence in the record.</tt><p><tt><b>	4.  Unconstitutional</b></tt><p><tt><b>		a.</b>  <b>First Amendment</b></tt><p><tt>	For the reasons stated in connection with Subpart Dgenerally, see supra, Section897.34 would violate the FirstAmendment.  The speech that Section 897.34 would ban goes well beyond speechthat is purely commercial in nature.  Even with respect to the speech affectedby Section 897.34 that is purely commercial in nature, FDA has not demonstrated(and cannot demonstrate) that banning the forms of advertising and promotionspecified in Section 897.34 "will in fact" reduce smoking among persons underthe age of 18, or that Section 897.34 is not more extensive than necessary toaddress the harms thought to be presented by such forms of advertising andpromotion.  Like FDA's other proposed restrictions on cigarette advertising andpromotion, Section 897.34 would impermissibly reduce adults to the level ofchildren.</tt><p><tt><b>			(1)</b>  <b>Section 897.34(a)</b></tt><p><tt>	With respect to Section 897.34(a) in particular, FDA seeksto ban a stunning variety of symbolic communications that simply cannot becategorized under the Supreme Court's decisions as merely "commercial speech."Speech that "propose[s] a commercial transaction . . . is the test foridentifying commercial speech." Board of Trustees of SUNYv.Fox, 492 U.S. 469, 473-74 (1989) (citing Virginia PharmacyBd.v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., 425 U.S. at748, 762 (1976)).  FDA's discussion of the nontobacco item ban simply assumes,without support, that tobacco-logo-bearing items are all advertisements.  Itfurther assumes that all advertisements are ipso facto commercialspeech.  These assumptions are not supportable.</tt><p><tt>	It is a cultural fact of American life that the symbols of manufacturedproducts and services are everywhere.  Some of these are advertisements thatwould fit the definition of commercial speech:  they invite a commercialtransaction, usually a purchase.  In the Supreme Court's words, they "propose acommercial transaction."  Radio and television commercials, print ads, andpoint-of-sale materials are commonly employed to do this.  By contrast, a"brand name, . . . logo, symbol, motto, . . . recognizable color or pattern ofcolors, or... other indicia of product identification,"(Section 897.34(a)) do not automatically propose a commercialtransaction.</tt><p><tt>	Not every visible or audible allusion to the commercial products foundeverywhere in American life is an instance of commercial speech as the SupremeCourt has defined that term.  For instance, Coca-Cola, a soft-drink company,and Disney, a filmmaker, each have an entire line of logo-bearingclothing.  Product logos, slogans, symbols and color patterns adorn notonly clothing, but bedding, housewares, and other objects -- all in settingswhere the notion of a proposed commercial transaction has no meaning.</tt><p><tt>	When a private citizen (who is not a manufacturer, distributor or retailerof the product symbolized) wears a logo-adornedobject, such as a baseball hat or T-shirt, the act of wearing the item may becommunicative, but it is not commercial speech on the part of the wearer.  Whena farmer wears a John Deere cap, he is not proposing that anyonepurchase farm equipment from him or from John Deere; the farmer simply likesthe hat.  He may well be expressing identity with or approval of an Americanrural lifestyle.  He may think it looks "cool."  Depending on when and where itis worn, its purpose may be to assert cultural identity with, or culturaldifference from, others.  FDA turns a blind eye to the fact that the personaldisplay of products with commercial logos -- through dress and other forms ofexpression-- is a form of participation in American popular culture:  Itis a way to register a group identity, to signal one's place in the socialfabric.</tt><p><tt>	Thus, most of the uses of logo- and other symbol-bearing products are notcommercial speech at all.  They simply do not propose a commercial transaction.See Virginia State Bd., 425 U.S. at 762.  In addition to definingcommercial speech as "speech proposing a commercial transaction," the SupremeCourt has sometimes described it as "expression related solely to the economicinterests of the speaker and its audience."  Central Hudson Gas &amp; Elec.Corp.v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N.Y., 447 U.S. 557, 561 (1980).The nontobacco products ban fails this test as well.</tt><p><tt>	The mere presence of a product logo on an object does not suffice to makesuch an object an "advertisement."  In Bolgerv. Youngs DrugProds., Inc., 463 U.S. 60 (1983), the Supreme Court said of thecontraception-information packets involved that "the mere fact that they areconceded to be advertisements clearly does not compel the conclusion that theyare commercial speech."  Id. at 66.  FDA never justifies the claim thatbranded nontobacco items are advertisements.</tt><p><tt>	There is an additional reason the Supreme Court refused to equateadvertisement and commercial speech, a reason also fatal to FDA's efforts toeliminate all tobacco-indicia-bearing,nontobacco products.  Mere reference to a specific product does not byitself convert expression into commercial speech.  The pamphlets at issuein Bolger made reference to a particular contraceptive product, but thatfact alone did not make them commercial speech.  Id.  And the onlything logo-bearing, nontobacco products do is make reference to a product.For this reason also they are not commercial speech.</tt><p><tt>	FDA's attempted ban of these forms of communication must therefore beanalyzed under standards applicable to speech enjoying full First Amendmentprotection.  Under these standards, the Agency's proposed ban resoundinglyfails -- for speech may not be banned simply because government disapproves ofits content.  See, e.g., Simon &amp; Schuster,Inc.v. Members of the N.Y.S. Crime Victims Bd., 502 U.S. 105,116 (1991); Police Dept. of Chicagov. Mosley, 408 U.S. 92,95 (1972).  The Agency has shown neither that "the regulation is necessary toserve a compelling state interest" nor "that it is narrowly drawn to achievethat end."  Perry Educ. Ass'nv. Perry Local Educators'Ass'n, 460 U.S. 37, 45 (1983).  The ban is also patently, unapologetically,viewpoint-based.  And the First Amendment forbids the government to regulatespeech in ways that disfavor certain viewpoints.  See Members of theCity Council of the City of Los Angelesv. Taxpayers forVincent, 466 U.S. 789, 804 (1984).</tt><p><tt>	Even if logo-type expression were described as mixed expression--part commercial and part not -- the ban still would be subject to the mostsearching, strict scrutiny review.  That is because any component of thesymbolic expression found to be "commercial speech" as the Supreme Court hasdefined that term would nonetheless be inextricably intertwined with thenoncommercial symbolic component.  Indeed, because a logo, other symbol, orcolor pattern is typically a unitary visual whole, such marks simply areimpossible to fragment into "commercial" and "noncommercial" portions.  As theSupreme Court put it in Rileyv. National Fed. of the Blind,"where, as here, the component parts of a single speech are inextricablyintertwined, we cannot parcel out the speech....  Suchan endeavor would be both artificial and impractical.  Therefore, we applyour test for fully protected expression."  487 U.S. 781, 796 (1988)(emphasis added).  If there were any commercial speech element at all in, forexample, the Joe Camel image, that element remains inextricablyintertwined with its power as a symbol.  Strict scrutiny applies.  </tt><p><tt>	Finally, even if such articles were advertisements proposing a commercialtransaction, FDA's ban would still be invalid under the First Amendment testsfor regulating commercial speech.  FDA could not ban them outright.  TheSupreme Court has plainly warned:  "commercial speech cannot be banned becauseof an unsubstantiated belief that its impact is `detrimental.'"  LinmarkAssocs., Inc.v. Willingboro, 431 U.S. 85, 92 n.6 (1977).  AndFDA has made no showing that the logo and symbol ban will, in any waywhatsoever, advance the purpose of stopping minors from smoking.</tt><p><tt>	Commercial speech restrictions must meet the demanding test of CentralHudson Gas &amp; Electric Corp.v. Public Service Commission,447 U.S. 557 (1980).  Central Hudson permits regulation of commercialspeech where (1) the speech concerns lawful activity and is not deceptive;(2)the regulation serves a substantial government interest; (3) therestriction directly advances the government's asserted interest; and (4) therestriction has a reasonable fit with that substantial government interest.Id.</tt><p><tt>	It is clear that the nontobacco-product ban cannot be said directly toadvance the regulation's supposed purpose.  Nontobacco logo-bearing itemsdo not propose sales of tobacco products to minors.  FDA has offered nopersuasive evidence that the existence of such items leads to increased salesto minors.  Any connection between these and increased sales to minors is, bydefinition, an indirect and speculative one -- far too attenuated to constitutethe direct advancement required by Central Hudson and itsprogeny.</tt><p><tt>	Nor does the ban remotely satisfy the "reasonable fit" requirement:  FDAhas the burden of showing that a complete ban is "a means narrowly tailored toachieve the desired objective."  Board of Trustees of SUNYv.Fox, 492 U.S. 469, 480 (1989).  Yet the Agency nowhere has shown that acomplete ban is necessary to promote the stated goal --a ban that will preclude communication to and by adults.</tt>"123" [63  Having failed to establish a legallysufficient and extensive degree of connection between nontobacco items andsmoking by minors, FDA is simply at a loss to show how its ban could comewithin the limited scope allowed for the regulation of commercialspeech.]<p><tt><b>				(2)</b>  <b>Section 897.34(c)</b></tt><p><tt>	All of the objections stated in the previous discussion toproposed Section 897.34(a) apply with equal force to the proposed ban onsponsorship.  For the same reasons, Section 897.34(c) violates the FirstAmendment.</tt><p><tt>	FDA seeks to justify the sponsorship ban with the followingassertion:</tt><p><tt>"Sponsorship by cigarette and smokeless tobacco companies associatestobacco use with exciting, glamorous, or fun events, such as car racing androdeos.  It provides an opportunity for what sponsorship experts call `embeddedadvertising' between tobacco and sports enthusiasts, many of whom are childrenand adolescents.  Those watching a sponsored event, including children andadolescents, repeatedly see the sponsor's brand or corporate name linked withan event they enjoy."</tt><p><p><tt>60 Fed. Reg. 41,336.</tt>"128" [64  FDAgoes on to say that the "proposed rule is intended to break the link betweencompany-sponsored events and use of tobacco.  These provisions are intended toreduce the so-called `friendly familiarity' that sponsorships and itemsgenerate among young people."  60 Fed. Reg. 41,338.  Thus, the assertedjustification for Section 897.34(c) is the claim that sponsorship]<tt>associates smoking with something glamorous.  But FDA has notdemonstrated (and cannot demonstrate) that brand-namesponsorship influences anyone to smoke.  Thus, even if event sponsorship weredeemed "commercial speech," such speech retains substantial First Amendmentprotection, which the sponsorship ban would flout.  FDA makes no effort tojustify the proposed ban in </tt><p><tt>terms of Central Hudson's direct-advancement and narrow-tailoringrequirements.  FDA itself concedes:</tt><p><tt>"Evidence regarding sponsorship's impact on young people issomewhat limited, but reports indicate that cigarette manufacturers'sponsorship of sporting events can lead young people to associatebrand names with certain life styles or activities or can effect theirpurchasing decisions."</tt><p><p><tt>60 Fed. Reg. 41,337 (emphasis added).  Such a qualified "justification" isso legally deficient as to defy comment. </tt><p><tt>	Any restriction of First Amendment rights on a commercial-speech theorymust be "carefully calculated."  Board of Trustees, 492 U.S. at 480.  Itis not enough that there be some conceivable connection between the restrictionand the governmental objective served.  There must be a "fit" betweenrestriction and purpose.  Id.  But nowhere is such a "fit" betweenreducing teen smoking and a sponsorship ban discernible.  Some "limited"evidence that "sponsorship... can lead young people toassociate certain brand names with certain lifestyles or activities" could notsupport such a ban.  FDA has the burden to justify the restriction, and "mustaffirmatively establish the reasonable fit" required by Central Hudson.Board of Trustees, 492 U.S. at 480.  "Limited" evidence that a practice"can lead" to certain associations or even purchases does not begin to meetFDA's burden of establishing a restriction-justifyingconnection.</tt><p><tt><b>			b.</b>  <b>Fifth Amendment</b></tt><p><tt><b>				(1)  Uncompensated Taking</b></tt><p><tt>	Section897.34 would also result in an uncompensatedtaking of property in violation of the Fifth Amendment.  The stated goal andcertain result of Section897.34 is to deprive industry members ofvaluable property-- the goodwill generated through their substantial andlongstanding sports and cultural event sponsorships and other promotionalactivities, as well as valuable tobacco trademarks.</tt><p><tt>	The cursory takings analysis conducted by FDA with regard toSection897.34 mocks the requirements of the law.  See ExecutiveOrder No. 12630, 53 Fed. Reg. 8859 (1988).  The Executive Order directs theAgency to "be sensitive to, anticipate, and account for, the obligationsimposed by the Just Compensation Clause of the Fifth Amendment."  Id.FDA's takings analysis meets none of these obligations.  </tt><p><tt>	FDA states cryptically:  "Banning brand identifiable nontobacco items as amarketing tool and limiting sponsorship of events would not constitute a takingbecause, like vending machines and self-servicedisplays they can be modified or adapted to fit other needs."  60 Fed. Reg.41,358.  FDA also argues that</tt><p><tt>"[t]he [utilitarian] items, in conjunction with labeling, other advertisingactivities and sponsored events, create the impression that smoking orsmokeless tobacco product use is more prevalent and acceptable in society thanit actually is and, as a result, increase the risk that young people will smokecigarettes or use smokeless tobacco products and expose themselves to the long-termhealth risks associated with those products.  Thus banning tobacco promotionson non-tobaccoitems and in conjunction with sponsored events is appropriate."  Id. at41,359.</tt><p><p><tt>	These arguments are plainly inadequate.  First, FDA fails to explain, evencursorily, how its "adaptation" argument applies to sponsored events, or evenwhat it is that is supposed to be "adapted to fit other needs."  Second, FDA'srecitation of its rationale for the proposed regulation is not an analysis ofthe issues raised by the Takings Clause.  While the demonstration of alegitimate state interest is a prerequisite in a takings analysis, theassertion of such an interest does not represent the totality of that analysis.FDA has failed to meet its obligations under Executive Order 12,630.</tt><p><tt><b>				(a)	The Ban on Event Sponsorship Effects</b></tt><p><tt>					<b>a Taking of Manufacturer's Goodwill </b></tt><p><tt></tt><p><tt>	The losses of goodwill caused by Section897.34 wouldconstitute a taking.</tt>"129" [65  The SupremeCourt has held that the Fifth Amendment applies to regulatory action resultingin the loss or destruction of intangible property interests, such as goodwill,trade secrets and contract rights.  ]<tt>See, e.g.,Kimball Laundry Co.v.

Some of this informationwas disclosed by EPA to the public.  In judging whether Monsanto was entitledto compensation, the Court focused on whether the company had a "reasonableinvestment-backed expectation" in the continued secrecy of the submittedsecrets.  467 U.S. at 1005.  FIFRA itself, for a time, contained secrecyguarantees.  On this statutory basis, the Court held that Monsanto had a"reasonable investment-backed expectation" in the continued secrecy of thepublicized records, and that the government's use and disclosure of those dataresulted in a taking.  Id. at 1010-12.</tt><p><tt>	As in Ruckelshaus, this regulatory action amounts to a taking.  Thebans instituted under Section897.34 interfere with the reasonableinvestment-backed expectations of industry members and thereby result in ataking of currently existing and valuable "good will."  This is amplydemonstrated by the economic impact of the regulations and theinvestment-backed expectations of the industry members who have engaged in thetypes of activities that FDA now proposes be banned.</tt><p><tt>	The economic losses in the form of "good will" caused by the regulationswill be significant:</tt><p><tt><b>	</b></tt><b>&#176;<tt>	Reynolds</tt></b><p><tt>	Reynolds sponsors approximately 2,600 sportingevents in the names of its Winston, Camel and Vantage brands annually.Reynolds has a long history of sponsorship of motor sports in the name of itsWinston brand.  It currently sponsors the NASCAR Winston Cup Series, the NASCARWinston Racing Series, NASCAR Winston West Series, and the NHRA Winston DragRacing Series.  These sponsorships have been substantial.  This long-terminvestment in the association of the name of its Winston product with thissport-- and the corresponding goodwill generated as a result-- isan extremely valuable corporate asset.  The avowed purpose ofSection897.34 is to divest Reynolds of this asset since it foreverterminates any further association between the brand name "Winston" and NASCAR.60 Fed. Reg. 41,338 ("The proposed rule is intended to break the link betweentobacco-company-sponsoredevents and use of tobacco.").  As a result, this loss is an uncompensatedtaking.</tt><p><tt>	Furthermore, each of the means through which goodwill is generated infavor of Reynolds through its sponsorship and promotional activities undertakenin its "Camel" brand name will be prohibited.  The total ban on the use ofbranded nontobacco goods for promotional purposes will necessitate terminationof the "Camel Cash" program.  Finally, Reynolds also generates goodwill throughits sponsorship of the Vantage Championship, a Senior PGA Tour event.</tt><p><tt>	Reynolds has made a substantial investment in these activities, throughwhich it builds and sustains goodwill with its customers and the public atlarge.  The proposed regulation is intended to eviscerate that investment.Such a confiscation would constitute a taking.</tt><p><tt><b>	</b></tt><b>&#176;<tt>	Philip Morris</tt></b><p><tt>	Philip Morris sponsors thousands of sporting andcultural events each year in the names of its Marlboro, Merit, Parliament,Virginia Slims, and Benson &amp; Hedges brands.  These events include MarlboroIndy Car Racing, Virginia Slims Legends Tennis Events, Merit Bowling, as wellas Marlboro Music Military Concerts, Marlboro Music State Fair Tours, andMarlboro Country Dance programs.  The substantial, long-terminvestment that Philip Morris has made in the association of its product brandnames with these events --and the corresponding goodwill-- is a valuable asset.  Again, the statedpurpose of Section897.34 is to divest Philip Morris of that asset.</tt><p><tt>	Furthermore, the goodwill generated in favor of Philip Morris throughpromotional activities undertaken in its Marlboro brand name will be adverselyaffected.  The total ban on the use of branded nontobacco goods for promotionalpurposes will necessitate termination of the "Marlboro Miles" program discussedabove.  Moreover, Philip Morris will effectively be precluded from sponsoringany Marlboro Indy Car entries in the name of this brand since it will beadversely singled out among all other sponsors for restrictions on carpresentation and the total ban on the nontobacco promotional goods that play animportant part in any sport sponsorship.  </tt><p><tt>	Like Reynolds, Philip Morris has made a substantial investment in theseactivities through which it builds and sustains goodwill with its customers andthe public at large.  The proposed regulation is intended to take that away,and therefore, this property confiscation is a taking.</tt><p><tt>	Section897.34 interferes in the "reasonable investment-backedexpectations" of all of these companies, a key indicium that a regulatoryaction results in a taking.  E.g., Ruckelshaus, 467 U.S.at 1005.  As detailed above, the tobacco companies have invested heavily inthese types of activities as a way to compete with one another and to buildgoodwill.  The expectation of the companies that they would enjoy the benefitof the asset created by these activities was certainly reasonable.  </tt><p><tt>	Cigarettes are a legal product in this country.  Cigarettemanufacturers-- as have most major United States corporations--have engaged in these types of sponsorship and other promotional activities fordecades.  Nothing that would now be banned by FDA is new or radical.  Moreover,Congress has previously refused to restrict the activities that would be bannedunder Section897.34.  To the contrary, Congress has previouslyrejected proposals to ban these activities.  For example, in 1990Congressman Waxman and other antitobacco representatives in the House ofRepresentatives introduced legislation that, among other restrictions nowproposed again by FDA, would have made it a federal offense to sponsor sportingevents using cigarette brand names.  See H.R. 5041, 101st Cong., 2dSess. (1990).  That legislation, however, was rejected by RepresentativeWaxman's own subcommittee, and, therefore, was never enacted into law.  Thus,it is clear that the tobacco companies have had a substantial and reasonablebasis for their investment-backed expectations with respect to their ability tocompete and exploit existing goodwill through the activities FDA now seeks toban.</tt><p><tt><b>				(b)	FDA's Prohibitions on the Use of Trademarks</b></tt><p><tt><b>					Constitute an Unconstitutional Taking of</b></tt><p><tt>					<b>Property Without Just Compensation</b></tt><p><tt></tt><p><tt>	Section 897.34, as well as the advertising restrictions inSection 897.32, effect an uncompensated taking of tobacco manufacturers'trademarks in violation of the Fifth Amendment.

Theproposed regulations single out tobacco trademarks, seeking to relegate them tothe few venues acceptable to the FDA.

See The Trademark Cases, 100 U.S. 82(1879).

Hanover Star Milling Co. v. Metcalf,240 U.S. 403, 413 (1916).  Trademark owners are entitled to the full protectionafforded by the Fifth Amendment.  Friedman v.

The "Marlboro" mark, for example, has been in usesince approximately 1890.<p>	Where a regulation interferes with a reasonable, investment-backed expectationand severely diminishes the value of property, the Constitution requires justcompensation.  ]<tt>See Tri-Bio Labs., Inc. v.

For example,manufacturer Brown &amp; Williamson has approximately 40 trademarks registeredfor use in connection with nontobacco products.

Even for marks applicable to both tobacco and nontobacco products,the impact of the proposed regulations would be devastating.</tt>"138" [72<p>	The FDA ignores the impact of the regulation on a long-recognizedand historically protected property right.

Anyrestrictions imposed on private property, if permissible, must be proportionateto the extent to which the use contributes to health risks.  SeeExecutive Order 12,630, [[section]]4(d); Dolan v. City ofTigard, 114 S.Ct. 2309 (1994) (requiring "rough proportionality"between burden placed on private property and degree to which public interestis impinged by unfettered use of private property).</tt><p><tt>	FDA's regulations not only fail to substantially advance the goal ofpreventing youth smoking, they bear a negligible relationship to that professedpurpose.  FDA bases its proposed regulations on the assumption that youngpeople smoke cigarettes because tobacco product trademarks appear on nontobaccoproducts and at sponsored events.  Eliminate the trademarks, FDA appears toargue, and youth smoking will decline.</tt><p><tt>	FDA's premise that the use of tobacco trademarks in these contexts bearsany relationship to the decision by young people to smoke is unfounded.  It isabsurd to suppose that the presence of a trademark on a T-shirt or in anadvertisement in a particular publication plays an important role in thisdecision.  Indeed, as is discussed at great length in these comments, tobaccoadvertising has no demonstrated relationship to the decision by young people tosmoke.  As tobacco advertising is not a significant factor in youth smoking,the presence or absence of trademarks in those advertisements will not affect-- let alone substantially affect -- the problem of tobacco use by youngpeople.</tt><p><tt>	Further, FDA proffers no evidence -- and indeed no evidence exists -- thattrademark usage on nontobacco products, as opposed to advertising generally,causes young people to smoke.  FDA does not, and could not, prove thattrademark usage on nontobacco products or sponsored events plays anysignificant role in a young person's decision to smoke.  Nor does FDA show thatthere is any substantial relationship between trademark usage and youthsmoking.  </tt><p><tt>	Instead, FDA weakly asserts that sponsorship of events may lead toassociations with "positive imagery" or "friendly familiarity."  FDA cites ahandful of studies and opinion polls examining the relationship between tobaccosponsorship of sporting events, tobacco promotions through nontobacco products,and youth smoking.  None of the studies cited by FDA supports the contentionthat restricting the use of tobacco-product trademarks would substantiallyadvance the goal of curtailing youth smoking.  Further, as is noted in ourcomments above, the studies that FDA does cite contain serious methodologicaland other flaws.</tt><p><tt>	In sum, these regulations would destroy the rights of the owners of aseries of valuable trademarks to use their marks in myriad ways.  They narrowlytarget long-held, reasonable investment-backed expectations in the use of thesetrademarks.  They lack a substantial relationship to the purported purpose ofthe regulations.  Thus, Sections 897.32 and 897.34 effect a taking of privateproperty requiring just compensation.  Both regulations must be reconsidered inlight of the obligations imposed by Executive Order 12,630 and the TakingsClause.</tt>"138" [73<p>	In sum, Section897.34 (like Section 897.32) appears to have beenproposed with insufficient thought with respect to its significant impact onthe property rights of affected industry members.  As described above, thesecompanies have a long tradition of sponsorships and other promotionalactivities, which FDA now seeks to ban.

Congress has required that four specifiedhealth warnings be rotated on cigarette packages and in cigarette advertising(including billboards).  15 U.S.C. [[section]]1333.  Congress presumablyconcluded that each warning was "important" but that they need not-- andshould not-- all appear at once in the same advertisement.  Under FDA'sproposal, however, cigarette advertising that complies with Congress' mandatepresumably could be considered "false or misleading" by FDA.  <p>	More generally, by introducing the word "important" into the proposed standardfor misbranding of cigarettes, FDA (1)has impermissibly gone beyond thetest for misbranding set forth by Congress in the text of FDCA[[section]]201(n), 21 U.S.C. [[section]]321(n), (2)has actedarbitrarily and capriciously, and (3)has proposed a new standard that isunconstitutionally vague.]First, Section201(n) establishes, with respect toomissions, a general test of materiality, for use in determining whetherlabeling or advertising is misleading and therefore misbrands a product.21U.S.C. [[section]]321(n).  As FDA, itself, has stated:  "Indetermining whether labeling is misleading because of a failure to disclosesome fact, section 201(n) specifies that the fact omitted must be`material.'"  40 Fed. Reg. 28,582 (July 7, 1975) (emphasis added).  Thejudicial decisions interpreting and applying Section 201(n) have uniformly heldthat, for an omission to cause labeling to be misleading, the omission must bematerial.  E.g., United States v. 45/194 Kg.Drums of Pure Vegetable Oil, 961 F.2d 808, 811 n.2 (9th Cir. 1992);United States v. Vital Health Prods., Ltd., 786 F.Supp.761, 767 (E.D.

There is no good reason for a new and different test, andthere is no good reason for a new and different test whose application islimited solely to tobacco products.</tt><p><tt>	The extensive jurisprudence regarding the concept of "materiality" as usedin food and drug law, securities law and other bodies of law, has given thetest a reasonably ascertainable meaning.</tt>"146" [76  FDA, all the industries regulated bythe Agency, and the courts have learned to apply that test in reviewinglabeling and advertising.  FDA has not expressed any dissatisfaction with thattest in the current rulemaking.  Thus, there is no good reason for departingfrom that test and substituting a new and different one.<p>	Moreover, FDA has not identified any aspect of tobacco products or theirlabeling or advertising that warrants a departure from the standard of"materiality" in Section201(n) for determining whether an omission fromlabeling or advertising is misleading and therefore makes the product to whichit relates misbranded; and we are aware of none.  Thus, no good reason has beenpresented for adopting a new test whose application is limited solely totobacco products.]Third, in place of Section201(n), FDA has substituted anew standard that makes misbranding turn on whether the information omitted is"important."  Although the word "important" is part of standard English andthus appears in FDA regulations, e.g., 21C.F.R.[[section]]200.5 (1995), and in the Supreme Court's definition ofmateriality quoted supra, it is not a recognized term in food and druglaw.  Presumably, it means something other than "material" as that term is usedin Section201(n); but it is unclear, however, how "important" differsfrom "material."  FDA has provided no guidance on how the new test ofimportance is to be applied or how parties subject to the test are todetermine:  "important" to whom?  "important" for what?  "important" in lightof what other information or circumstances?  In sum, Section897.36"forbids... the doing of an act in terms so vague that men[and women] of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning anddiffer as to its application" and therefore is unconstitutionally vague.Connallyv. General Constr. Co., 269 U.S. 385, 391(1926).</tt><p><tt>	The vice of vagueness is particularly intolerable in this context becauseit occurs in a regulation of constitutionally protected speech, and because itfunctions to give an unelected regulatory body undue discretion to use bothinformal and formal means to suppress such speech.  See generallyAmsterdam A.G.  <i>The Void for Vagueness Doctrine</i>. U. Pa. L. Rev. 109: 67(1960), and cases cited therein.</tt><p><tt>	FDA also proposes that labeling or advertising would be false ormisleading if it "lacks fair balance."  FDA has obviously borrowed this conceptfrom the prescription drug regulations, 21 C.F.R.[[section]]202.1(e)(5)(ii) (1995), but it is inapplicable to cigarettes.</tt><p><tt>	First, the "fair balance" requirement for drugs is based not on theSection502 "false or misleading" prohibition but rather onSection502(n)(3), which requires that prescription drug advertisingcontain a "true statement" relating to "side effects, contraindications, andeffectiveness."  21 U.S.C. [[section]]352(n)(3).  FDA's drug regulationstates:</tt><p><tt>"(5)  `True statement' of information.  An advertisement does not satisfythe requirement that it present a `true statement' of information in briefsummary relating to side effects, contraindications and effectivenessif:</tt><p><p><tt>	*     *     *</tt><p><p><tt>"(ii)  It fails to present a fair balance between information relating toside effects and contraindications and information relating to effectiveness ofthe drug . . . ."  21 C.F.R. [[section]]202.1(e)(5).  </tt><p><p><tt>	Second, as the drug regulation makes clear, the "fair balance"required is between information about a product's therapeutic benefits andinformation about its adverse effects when used.  Since no therapeutic claimsare made for cigarettes, the "fair balance" concept is simplyinapplicable.</tt><p><tt>	FDA's proposed regulation would also deem "false or misleading" anylabeling or advertising that "lacks substantial evidence to support any claimsmade for the product."  The term "substantial evidence" is a term of art foundin the drug approval provisions of Section505(e)(5), but not in thedevice approval provisions of Section515(d)(2).  Compare 21 U.S.C.[[section]]355(d) with 21 U.S.C. [[section]]360e.  UnderSection505(d), FDA cannot approve a new drug if "there is a lack ofsubstantial evidence that the drug will have the effect it purports or isrepresented to have under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, orsuggested in the proposed labeling thereof."  21 U.S.C.[[section]]355(d)(5).  In contrast, with regard to a new device subjectto premarket approval under Section515, FDA cannot approve the device if"there is a lack of a showing of reasonable assurance" of its safety oreffectiveness "under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, orsuggested in the proposed labeling."  21 U.S.C. [[section]]360e(d)(2)(A)&amp; (B).  Thus, the standard of "substantial evidence" is to be applied byFDA with respect to certain matters in the new-drug-approvalprocess.  The standard does not apply outside that process.  In any event, FDAdoes not propose to classify cigarettes or impose a premarket approvalrequirement.</tt><p><tt>	Since the statute does not require "substantial evidence" for deviceclaims, FDA's proposed regulation is inapplicable and invalid.  Moreimportantly, the statutory standard applies only to claims oftherapeutic effectiveness made in the labeling.  Again, since noclaims of effectiveness are made for cigarettes, FDA's proposal is inapplicableto them.  The standard of "substantial evidence" is not referred to in Section502, 21 U.S.C. [[section]]352 (1994), and does not apply under thatsection.  Thus, it is not applicable to determinations whether statements madewith respect to a drug or device are false or misleading or whether a drug ordevice is otherwise misbranded.</tt><p><tt>	Thus, even if FDA were to categorize cigarettes as both drugs and devices,the "substantial evidence" standard would have no application to cigarettesbecause that standard applies only in the approval process for drugs, and FDAis not proposing to subject cigarettes to that process.  Nor can proposedSection 897.36 be justified under Section 520(e).  That section gives FDA noauthority to define a special standard of misbranding for a restricted device.The types of misbranding are set forth in Section 502, as elaborated by Section201(n), which is the standard Congress defined and intended to apply underSection 502(a).  FDA has no authority under Section 520(e), under Section701(a), 21 U.S.C. [[section]]371(a) (1994), or under any other provisionof the FDCA to alter or supplement the standard established by Section201(n).</tt><p><tt><b>		2.  Precluded by ADAMHA and FCLAA</b></tt><p><tt>	For the reasons set forth in our comments on Section897.30(a)(1), Section 897.36 is precluded by the ADAMHA Reorganization Act of1992 and the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act.</tt><p><tt><b>		3.  Unconstitutional</b></tt><p><tt>	Section 897.36 is entirely inconsistent with, and violativeof, Due Process and the First Amendment because it would entrust the regulationof cigarette advertising-- and thus the exercise of First Amendmentrights-- to an agency that believes cigarettes should not be marketed atall.  It would confer the power of censorship on an agency that clearlybelieves that, if one is being truthful, nothing good can be said about anytobacco product.</tt><p><tt>	In the eyes of such an agency, nearly anything a manufacturer might say topromote its products could be deemed to be "false or misleading" --because the Agency believes there is nothing about the product to promote.  Inthe eyes of such an Agency, the only advertising likely not to be deemed "falseor misleading" would be advertising that strives to drive people awayfrom cigarettes.</tt><p><tt>	Due Process and the First Amendment simply do not permit an Agencydetermined to extinguish all use of a product to exercise power overadvertising for the product.</tt><p><H3><a href=vol9.htm><I>Next Volume</I></a></H3><I><B>(Note: Volume Eight is not available.)</B></I><H3><a href="contents.htm#start"><I>Table of Contents</I></a></H3> <hr><IMG WIDTH=50 HEIGHT=48 ALIGN=LEFT SRC=../../lcc.gif ALT=*> Released through <a href="/inside/about.html">COUNSEL CONNECT</a>.

<H2>Welcome to the Seminar!</h2>

<H2>Telecommunications Reform:<BR> The New Playing Field</h2>

<H3>Seminar Discussion Thread</h3>

From: Jonathan Groner -- Legal Times - Washington, DC<br>
Date: Mon Feb  5 12:37:17 1996<br>
Subject: The New Playing Field<p>

Last Append: Fri Feb  9 09:47:53 1996<p>

The playing field in telecommunications -- broadcast, cable, local
telephone service, long distance, and to an extent computers and the
Internet -- has changed dramatically. No one really knows what all the
outcomes of the new law will be, but everyone agrees that the law and
business of telecommunications will never be the same again.<p>

We have put together a Counsel Connect "Instant Seminar" on <A
HREF=http://rs9.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/1?c104:./temp/~c104qale::
telecommunications> the new telecommunications legislation</a>, which
was passed late last week by both houses of Congress and is expected to
be signed by President Clinton within days. The seminar will be located
right here in the existing Telecommunications Law forum. As you can see,
a lot of interested lawyers have already begun the discussion in a long
thread here, even before the formal kickoff of the seminar today.<p>

We have ten panelists now -- more are being added -- who will all be
free to begin and to add to discussion threads. All members are also
free to do so as well.<p> 

I have intentionally focused the following questions, which are only
suggestions for further discussion, on the consumer perspective. That's
because this bill will affect everyone, not just those of us who work
for telecommunications law firms or media companies.<p> 

Among the questions we hope to address:<p><OL>

<LI>What kinds of new services can consumers expect to find on their
phone lines or in the airwaves? Is this the beginning of the unification
of cable, computer online service, broadcast TV, telephones and
everything else into one product? Will consumers want this, and how is
it going to be sold to the frequently risk-averse and technology-averse
consumer?<p>

<LI>Is bigness badness? There will certainly be a lot of mergers and
joint ventures among the major players, but the antitrust laws will
still operate to prevent horizontal mergers that directly reduce
competition in specific product markets. The consortiums that emerge --
companies like Sprint joining with cable firms, regional BOCs [Bell
Operating Companies] working together to create new entities -- will
pose rather different kinds of competitive problems. Will the consumer
ultimately benefit from these, or will the mega-mergers choke off
competition?<p>

<LI>Are we all glad to see the end of the AT&T consent decree? Did it
serve a useful purpose? Is its useful life over?<p>

<LI>How is competition in local telephone service likely to emerge?
Apparently, the seven regional BOCs must let competitors use their
lines. Who is going to jump in, how soon, and what will competition look
like at this level?<p> 

<LI>What will happen to cable rates given the phased deregulation that
is mandated by this bill?<p>

<LI>Are we likely to see totally new players in these markets, given the
general decrease in regulation? Are people going to buy their phone
service from their local electric utility, or their cable service from
Sears, or their online or Internet service from their local
newspaper?<p>

<LI>What about constitutional challenges to the V-chip or the online
indecency provision? How quickly will they emerge, and what
results?</ol><p> 


Rather than have people respond in this introductory thread, it would be
more effective to post comments in separate threads on separate issues
and questions.<p> <hr><p>

Subject: The New Playing Field<p>


For those of us that do not practice telecom law, is there an on-line
resource (either on LCC or on the Web) that someone could suggest to
give a bit of technical background on the pre-February 2, 1996 telecom
world? i.e., where did the RBOC's territory end and long distance
carriers begin? what is a regional calling area? what is a local loop?
background on the fight to provide cable/fiber/isdn to the home....<p>

Good questions, Gary. As background, I've posted some news articles on
the changes made by the legislation (see the "Telecom in the News"
thread), but can any of you give us more detail?<p>

Subject: Best telco ref. book<p>

I do not believe it is on-line, but the single best source I have run
across for background information is Kellogg, Huber and Thorne's
one-volume Federal Telecommunications Law treatise (Little Brown). It is
also remarkably well written for a book on this (sometimes highly
technical) subject.<p>

Subject: 47 CFR 22 as amended...<p>

The best place to start is the definitions section under the FCC
regulations, but putting them together can be a pain given all the
pending rules and final rules in the Federal Register. However, to
firmly grasp the definitions (even in the new bill) you may find the
need to get an RF systems type engineer to explain the technical issues
embedded in the definitions and the rules to see where the legal issues
and opportunities are. If you happen to have the Lawyers Cooperative
Publishing "CFR Plus" in the library and it is up to date, it is a great
tool to get all the pre-1996 statutory law in one place- the CD-ROM
version is a life saver if you have it [home life, that is- you can do
weeks of research in hours]. However, that is just the statutory scheme.
After that, hit insta-track at a law school library and get the cites on
recent[!!!] law review articles regarding the various Consent Decrees,
and follow up (with particular attention to) the Bell Atlantic suits
brought as plaintiffs[!!!] creatively initiated by the in house
litigators there. Some really great
aggressive and pro-active in house litigation work initiated by
that gang. If I can be of further assistance, give a call at
201-342-6467. I have been eating, sleeping, and breathing this
project for months now with the perspective of a former Signal
Corps engineering officer and consultant to the NTIA/DOD/NSA
turned lawyer late in life. Have fun and good luck. If you have a
technical bent, it is a great revolution to behold! :-) Matt<p>

Thanks for the heads up on Mr. Thorn's treatise. Looks like my kids'

Eleanor,<br>

I am working on getting something out, but keep several things in mind.
I have 15 years on the technical side and only four as a litigator with
mostly local experience, such as getting tower variances for business
and amateur radio installations. The road map is more of a Gordian Knot,
so I am learning as much as I can from the panelists before I confirm or
deny my own conclusions. Also please understand that as I am a
struggling young solo with a family and government backed student loan
lenders to support, all my time on this project since the fall (several
hundred hours by now) is "sweat equity". When I do put it in writing, I
want to make sure I don't blow it!<p>

<h2>Standing [To Bring A Lawsuit], Etc.</h2>



<H2>Telecommunications Reform: The New Playing Field</h2>



<H3>Seminar Discussion Thread</h3>



From: Eugene Volokh -- UCLA Law School - Los Angeles<br>

Date: Tue Feb  6 13:41:54 1996<br>

Subject: Standing etc.<p>



Last Append: Wed Feb 7 06:26:08 1996<p>



Any thoughts on the procedural aspects of challenging the CDA and

the V-chip? Can one immediately file for a declaratory judgment,

or are there standing problems or some such? <p>



<hr><p>



Appended by: Theodore Frank -- Arent Fox - Washington<br>

Date: Tue Feb  6 17:30:55 1996<br>

Subject: standing, etc.<p>



There are always standing questions; at a minimum you will need a

plaintiff that is adversely affected by the provisions. For the

V-Chip, that will mean a programmer or a tv set manufacturer. I

doubt if a consumer can mount a challenge on the basis that the

V-chip requirement is going to make the tv set cost more. Set

manufacturers probably facing similar injury-in-fact problems.

For programmers, the problem is that the V-Chip requirements are

discretionary and it is arguable that there is no state action

involved. The Alliance case now before the Supreme Court might

shed some light on that issue. <p>



<hr><p>



Appended by: Andrew Schwartzman -- Media Access Project - Washington<br>

Date: Tue Feb  6 17:49:48<br>

1996 Subject: I agree...<p>



I agree with the last comment on V-Chip. There are also problems

with standing for the new access channel censorship provision in

the bill. Unlike the measure now before the Court in Alliance for

Community Media, there are no FCC regulations to be issued, so a

facial challenge may not lie. <p>



With respect to the Exon Amendment, whatever other problems there

may be, it will not be hard to get the case heard right away. It

is immediately effective, and any number of content providers can

legitimately show that they face genuine danger of imminent

prosecution, serious tangible burdens in attempting to comply

(Va. v. American Booksellers, Albertson v. SACB), and perhaps

also immediate First Amendent injury from the vagueness of the

statute. Moreover, I don't know if legislative history is

cognizable here, but Congress clearly anticipated immediate

challenge. <p>



<hr><p>



Appended by: Alfred Mamlet -- Steptoe & Johnson - Washington<br>

Date: Wed Feb  7 06:26:08 1996<br>

Subject: Standing etc.<p>



Congress certainly anticipated a constitutional challenge to

these provisions and thoughtfully provided for expedited judicial

review through a three judge district court with the right of

direct appeal to the Supreme Court. See Section 561.

<h2>Indecent Proposal</h2>



<H2>Telecommunications Reform: The New Playing Field</h2>



<H3>Seminar Discussion Thread</h3>



From: Christina Cooley -- Counsel Connect - Atlanta<br>

Date: Thu Dec  7 10:21:31 1995<br>

Subject: Indecent Proposal<p>



Last Append: Mon Feb 19 18:18:11 1996<p>



A conviction for making "indecent" material available to minors

over a computer network could bring a fine of $100,000 and a

prison sentence of five years, if a reported compromise in the

telecommunications bill makes it into law. According to an

article in today's Times, House members of the telecommunication

committee voted 17-16 to include the measure, and now the House

and Senate support similar measures. <p>



The ACLU has vowed to challenge such a law on First Amendment

grounds. Such a provision might create interesting problems for

online service providers. <p>

Subject: Indecent Proposal<p>



LEXIS. As I recall, the Supreme Court's <I>Pacifica</i> decision, which

bears upon indecency, contains a number of dirty words in the

body of the text. Surely LEXIS won't be prosecuted for making

this indecent material available for all of us to read -- but if

not, why not? <p>

<hr><p>



Appended by: Randall Boe -- Arent Fox - Washington<br>

Date: Wed Feb  7 18:05:43 1996<br>

Subject: Indecency and the Internet<p>



I am going to be filing a lawsuit tomorrow challenging the

indecency provisions of the Telecom Act on behalf of the American

Reporter, an electronic newspaper. The suit will allege that the

statute is unconstitutionally overbroad and we will be asking for

preliminary and permanent injunctive relief. The American

Reporter is going to publish an editorial tomorrow, which

contains an abundance of arguably indecent language. <p>



This statute raises a number of important questions. For example,

the statute apparently creates a distinction between traditional

newspapers and electronic newspapers. The Wall Street Journal or

the New York Times could publish the editorial tomorrow and face

no threat of prosecution. They could distribute the editorial by

mail or put it in every newspaper box in America and not violate

any statute. So what constitutional significance attaches to the

method by which the newspaper is distributed. <p>



A more important question that has to be resolved is determining

what the Internet really is. Congress obviously thinks the

Internet is simply another broadcast medium and that it is free

to regulate it on that basis. There are a number of compelling

arguments to the contrary. <p>



This statute is an example of "burning the house down to roast

the pig," to quote Justice Harlan. <p>

Burning Down The House To Roast the Pig<p>



Following the earlier thread, quoting justice Harlan, this bill

poses a serious threat to the viability of small Internet Service

Providers (ISPs).  Notwithstanding the statutes defenses for ISPs

acting in good faith, these typically small entities can not

afford litigation even to the summary judgment stage.  It could be

even worse if the court decides that a question of fact exists as

to what constitutes good faith in protecting subscribers from

access to this information.  Does anyone have suggestions about

"firewalls" that an ISP could erect to protect itself from

liability.<p>

<h2>Who Knows [What Will Happen]?</h2>



<H2>Telecommunications Reform: The New Playing Field</h2>



<H3>Seminar Discussion Thread</h3>



From: Andrew Schwartzman -- Media Access Project, Washington<br>

Date: Mon Feb  5 21:42:02 1996<br>

Subject: Who knows?<p>



Last Append: Wed Feb  7 22:43:26 1996<p>



One of the genuinely exciting elements of telcom policy is that

no one knows what will happen. <p>



Even those of us who are cautiously pessimistic agree that the

future is uncertain. Anyone who claims to be sure is either

foolish or soon to be rich, or both. <p>



The metaphor I use these days is a craps table. There are big

time players (crafty Ma Bell, the aggressive Baby Bell cousins,

high roller MCI, one dollar bettor GTE) and lots and lots of

nobodies thoughtlessly tossing C-notes onto the table. Some of

the latter are not as independent as they look; they are staked

by the big boys (General Motors, Peter Kiewit, the Baby Bells,

etc). <p>



In the end, some of the well known players will lose their

shirts. Some of the nobodies will win big and lose it all on one

last roll, and some will walk away rich. After all, look at that

Turner guy who strolled up to the table a few years ago... <p>



<hr><p>



Appended by: Jonathan Groner -- Legal Times - Washington<br>

Date: Mon Feb  5 22:59:58 1996<br>

Subject: Not just the same players<p>



Further amplifying Andy's point, I would add that those players

who will ultimately be the winners from this bill may include

some who are not now in this market and some whom we don't even

think of as telecommunications companies. This from the News

Grid, nicely reprinted by Laurie Gordon: <p>



<STRONG>



Sandra Cook, vice president of the KPMG Peat Marwick consulting

group, said there will be a five to 10 year period of upheaval,

with a small number of major players resulting from industry

mergers and acquisitions. <p>



These could be the existing telephone giants, but also railroads,

electric utilities or software companies that will be freed to

enter the burgeoning telecommunications industry by providing

telephones, wireless communication or Internet service. <p>



"For all participants it will be essential to identify the right

merger partners and above all, understand their customers," Cook

said. <p>



"Successful companies will be those that can determine which

customers to retain and acquire, and which can be sacrificed

profitably." <p>



Some huge mergers have already taken place in anticipation of the

bill's passage, and companies have been frantically seeking

alliances to position themselves for major changes. <p>



Microsoft Corp. for example, recently signed a deal with MCI

Communications to jointly offer Internet services and with Black

Entertainment Television to create better name recognition with

blacks. <p>



</strong>



So if you work for an electric utility, a software company, a

newspaper, a railroad (a RAILROAD??), this bill may affect how

you or your clients do business. <p>



<hr><p>



Appended by: Alfred Mamlet -- Steptoe & Johnson - Washington<br>

Date: Tue Feb  6 06:18:39 1996<br>

Subject: Railroads and Utilities<p>



Don't laugh at railroads. Sprint was started by Southern Pacific,

which lay fiber optic alongside its railroad rights of way. Most

major railroads today have their own private fiber and microwave

communications network. Some have excess capacity which could be

sold. <p>



However, utilities offer more intriguing possibilities. If there

is going to be serious competition on the local level a

competitor would need a local fiber network, extensive capital

resources, access to local rights-of-way, consumer name

recognition, customer service and reliability ethic. Electric

utilities meet all of these qualifications and very few others

do. While some will compete directly, most will prefer to create

a joint venture with an experienced telecommunications company.

<p>



<hr><p>



Appended by: Eleanor Kerlow -- DC Counsel Connect - Washington<br>

Date: Tue Feb  6 07:25:31 1996<br>

Subject: Watch the Utilities<p>



Yes, I agree with Al, I would watch the utilities companies.

Indeed, I would argue that they are already making a play in this

field. Isn't the Westinghouse/CBS merger essentially a utility

company driven deal? And what about GE/NBC too. <p>



<hr><p>



Appended by: Theodore Frank -- Arent Fox - Washington<br>

Date: Tue Feb  6 17:17:44 1996<br>

Subject: Who knows?<p>



While I think Al has a point with respect to the utilities, I

believe there are technical problems with using their plant for

telecommunications. Further, it one looks at what the major

players are doing -- the Bells, AT&T, MCI, Sprint/TCI -- they the

wave of the future is one stop shopping for all a customer's

telecommunications services, both transport and programming. The

utilities have a long way to go to position themselves for that

range of services. That is particularly true since they are still

trying to adjust to the introduction of competition in their own

industries. <p>



I think Andy has it right -- no one knows. However, if current

trends mean anything, we are going to see a consolidation in the

industry that is unparalleled since Theodore Vail put AT&T

together. Which of the current companies are going to be the

winners is going to be a difficult call. Moreover, the manner in

which the FCC and the States handle the entry of competition and

monitoring the playing field to assure that competition survives

may also affect the winners and losers. <p>



<hr><p>



Appended by: Alfred Mamlet -- Steptoe & Johnson - Washington<br>

Date: Wed Feb  7 06:28:41 1996<br>

Subject: Utilities<p>



Utilities will not try to be all things to all people, and most

will probably not directly provide telecom services directly to

consumers. However, if someone wants a local network to challenge

the incumbent provider, the local utility would be a valuable

ally. <p>



<hr><p>



Appended by: Jonathan Groner -- Legal Times - Washington<br>

Date: Wed Feb  7 22:43:26 1996<br>

Subject: Utilities<p>



The electric utilities seem happy with this bill. <p>



The current issue of Foster Electric Report quotes the president

of the Edison Electric Institute, the trade group for the

industry, as saying: "The bill's provisions reflect the

recognition that electric utilities are important players in

telecommunications. Its passage opens the door to new business

opportunities, which will be welcome news to the consumers and

investors alike. The bill assures that, in an increasingly

competitive business climate, investor-owned utilities will not

be shackled by regulatory barriers to the use of

telecommunications technology, expertise and other assets that

electric companies already have in place." <p>



One thing that the bill does is to permit utility holding

companies to set up telecommunications affiliates that can be

certified by the FCC as exempt from the rather draconian

strictures of the Public Utility Holding Company Act. There are

only 14 holding companies in existence now, but that still means

watch out, there may be new players in this game. <p>

Subject: What Does It Mean?<p>



Here are some of the major provisions, as reported by the New

York Times: <p><UL>



<LI>Cable TV -- Rate limits for most systems will end after three

years, and will end immediately for some smaller systems. <p>



<LI>Telephones -- Cable companies, long-distance carriers and others

can now compete for local phone service. The Baby Bells can offer

long-distance service. <p>



<LI>Television -- Broadcasters will have a chance to use a portion of

the airwaves set aside for new digital services, though Congress

will decide later whether or not they'll have to bid for the

right. <p>



New TVs must contain a chip that will allow consumers to block

material designated violent by programmers (a rating system

doesn't yet exist). <p>



<LI>Internet -- Sending pornography and "indecent" material to minors

over the 'Net is a criminal offense. <p>



<LI>Ownership -- Companies can own more tv and radio stations. </ul><p>



What high points have I missed? Will anyone predict whether these

sweeping changes will ultimately increase competition or just

result in bigger media conglomerates? <p>

Anyone have any thoughts on what FCC rules are going to be

obsolete and generally how long it will take the FCC to

promulgate new rules? Any requests for comments now in the

Federal Register that will be impacted? What happens in the

interim between the effective date of the Act (assuming the Pres.

signs it) and however long it takes the FCC to publish

amendments/new rules? Was any or all of the above planned in

anticipation of the new Act, or will we all live with chaos and

litigation until the smoke clears? Is there anyone on LCC reading

this group for the FCC??? <p>



Will E.T. be able to phone home, or is home now beyond his

Service Area or Interference Contour area, can he now send HBO

and the Home Shopping Channel signals over his Rural Area Radio

Telephone System and thus kill the market for DBS dishes at Radio

Shack? If we can get a V-chip, can we get one that blocks out

commercials and just plain old poor quality repetitive sit-coms

booze and chain smoke Lucky Strike non-filters that now get run

First, the bill should be in today's Congressional Record. Since

the final bill closely tracks the Conference Report which was

widely circulated over the last month, there are numerous

essentially verbatim texts floating around the Internet. I

believe one of the telephone trade publications put out the full

text of the draft conference report in print form as an appendix

to a recent issue. I am trying to track that down, and I'll post

the info if I can. <p>



Second, Jessie, there are of course, many, many other provisions

in this huge bill. Your summary covered most of the bases, but I

would add a few matters of interest: <p><UL>



<LI>there is a provision extending censorship of cable access

channel programs containing "nudity" <p>



<LI>cable rates are deregulated immediately for about one-third of

the country, and in three years for the rest of us in larger

markets. Price regulation on converter boxes and remotes is not

repealed. <p>



<LI>broadcasters got caught on their spectrum theft, but they still

get extended license terms (to 8 years), ironclad protection from

license challenges, and a mandated FCC review every two or three

years of whatever ownership rules are not repealed by the new

law. </ul><p>



The law does contain the orginal language giving the so-called

digital spectrum to the broadcasters, but Senator Dole got a

commitment that the matter will be revisited promptly. However,

the broadcasters do have the bird in their hands, and it is

certainly easier to stop a "clean" bill than to pass one. <p>



As to the Exon Internet amendment, it contains defenses for on

line providers. If they demonstrate, for example, that they take

measures to screen out minors and to warn parents, they are not

criminally liable. <p>

Subject: V-chip in PCs?<p>



Will the V-chip standard apply only to "TV" or can it be used in

PCs to block the bad stuff (however it gets defined in the courts

after much ACLU type litigation) from the Internet on an item by

item basis so ISPs don't need to worry about criminal liability

and shit[sic] the burden back to the parents, where it

belongs?!!!![did I just break the law if some lawyer's kid gets

onto LCC and reads this? Is LCC at risk, will they cut me off

because I can't type well?] Remember, a thermos keeps hot things

hot and cold things cold, the real issue is how does it know?

on what standard?] <p>

No, the V-Chip is to be intalled only in TV sets. Of course, if

and when those technologies converge, you might have a PC with TV

capability. Even so, the V-Chip works only on programming which

is coded with the telltale "V." Right now, there is no one

deciding this; the Act contemplates giving the broadcasters and

caple companies a year to develop their own system. This is

incompatible with the 'Net, since we are all programmers, and we

couldn't and wouldn't rate our own postings. But the V-Chip pales

in comparision to what the Exon amendment does to computer

communications. <p>

The new telecommunications bill is in the Hot Docs section of the

Subject: New Regulations<p>



In response to Mathew's inquiry, the new law mandates dozens of

rulemakings and puts clocks on most of them. The FCC is given

only 6 months to complete some items and up to 2 years to do

others. The Commission has anticipated and already begun some

rulemakings, and might be able to adjust other ongoing

proceedings to handle other mandates. One of the tightest

timetables in the bill is that the Commission has only 90 days to

act on an RBOC request to originate interLATA long distance

service in its own service area, which is sure to be a

contentious issue. <p>



All in all, while the bill does increase competition, it does not

decrease regulation. <p>

Subject: Winners and Losers<p>



Who are the big winners and losers in the telecommunications

reform bill? <p>



My vote:<p>



Losers: Consumers. With cable companies now able to raise their

rates, consumer cable fees are due to rise. With the limit on

broadcast station ownership expanded, more stations owned by same

company in same city reduces the variety and choice for

consumers<p>



Winners: Consumers. One stop shopping ability to buy long

distance service, internet, cable, and more from one vendor will

be easier, may create more competition and hence lower prices.

<p>



Any other thoughts? Specific companies that will fare well or

poorly under the new regulatory framework? <p>

Re: Winners and Losers<p>



Eleanor refers to "consumers." The issue here is whether the

legislation will permit competition to develop. The somewhat

similar legislation which almost passed in 1994 kept regulatory

safeguards in place and removed them as competition developed.

This bill removes the safeguards and *assumes* that competition

will develop. If it does, great. If not, we'll have a few

unregulated companies sharing a voice, data and multimedia

oligopoly among themselves. <p>



But this statute does not just related to Americans as

"consumers." Those of us concerned about how "the public" or

"citizens" will be affected see these groups are much more than

mere "consumers." After all, we are anticipating interactive

technology that has the capability to make all of us speakers as

well as recipients of information, data, etc. As citizens, will

we receive access to speak and to hear more and different kinds

of issues, ideas and social discourse? Will the technology unite

us, or separate us? Who needs to talk to whom more? <p>



Many people (not me) think "the public" will be better off with

the V-Chip. <p>



Many people (not me) think "the public" will be better off with

the Exon Cyberporn Amendment. <p>



Many people (not me) think that permitting large media

combinations will create more choices and greater efficiencies

for "the public." More choices from the same sources may not mean

greater diversity. <p>

RBOCs [Regional Bell Operating Companies] - These companies can

leverage their existing networks in order to provide cable and

long distance, although the latter will take some time.

CAPS-Competitive Access Providers obtain favorable pro-entry

provisions, principally expansive mandatory interconnection

provisons and preemption of restrictive state entry regulation.

This preemption authority vested in the procompetitive FCC will

mitigate restrictive regulation which is the rule in the majority

of the states. LEC strategies to slow entry into the local loop,

based on state regulation and state legislation, are undermined.

RBOCs are the big winners because they gain entry to most

markets. In the key long distance market, they will be able to

provide long distance to cellular customers and wireline

customers outside of their calling area immediately. At a

minimum, they need to have a facilities-based competitor in their

area. They will also have to meet a public interest test that

will provide grist for anyone who wants to delay their entry. <p>



It will not take much time to begin providing long distance

services. By the end of this month some will provide long

distance to their cellular customers. Providing long distance

outside of calling area will begin in a few months. <p>



Conversely, long distance companies are the big losers. They have

large margins that will be squeezed and will lose a significant

amount of market share within 2 years. <p>

Subject: V-Chip-Exon, Etc.<p>



The odd thing about the Telecommunications Act is that it is

universally described as "deregulatory." But every aspect of the

law that deals with communications content is intensely

reregulatory. The law adds sweeping new controls on online

communications, proposes brain surgery on television sets, adds

heightened penalties for indecency on cable and requires closed

captioning. <p>



The philosophy underlying the Act is sharply at odds with the

rationale that for six decades has supported less constitutional

protection for broadcasting. In NBC v. U.S.,the Supreme Court

held that economic regulation was necesssary for broadcasting,

and because of that fact of life, the governmenyt could apply

limited conditions on the license. Now, by sharp contrast, the

economic controls are being lifted, but the government's interest

in content controls is increased (and, some might say, finally

being seen for what it has always been). <p>



The Exon provisions have no place in a free society. Indecency

law has only been applied in the specific technological settings

of broadcast, telephone and to a far lesser degree, cable. In

each case, the extent of the government's involvement has been

limited according to the nature of the technology. But the

conditions for such regulation set out in Pacifica (pervasive

presence of the medium, unique accessibility, even for children

too you to read, status as an uninvited guest, inability to

control access) simply do not apply to computers. <p>



The V-chip is an odd provision, because it clearly is regulatory,

and clearly is intended to coerce licensed media to implement the

government's preferences for programming. No "private" ratings

system, once adopted by the government, has ever withstood

judicial challenge; no court has ever equated "indecency" with

"violence," and many have held that "violent" speech is fully

protected (assuming anyone can define it adequately). The only

question is whether the law creates a mandate. In this case, the

Conference Committee may describe the ratings system as

voluntary, but in the context of licensed media, the government's

suggestions -- expressed through legislation -- are about as

voluntary as a date with Bob Packwood. and, by the way, it is

worth noting that the V-chip has bulked up since the 103d

Congress. It's not just for violence anymore. It covers sex,

violence and any indecent material about which parents should be

informed. <p>



These and other intrusions in the new law are far from trivial.

They will; shape the debate over the First Amendment for the next

century. <p>

Even on the economic side this not a deregulatory bill. While the

I have a friend that is invovled in defining a new 3D standard

for the Internet. Concerned that someone somewhere is going to

create nasty 3D models, he is entertaining providing a built in

rating "slot" in the format so that a brower implementor can

provide a lockout mechanism. If explicit ratings were provided (I

am not sure who is intending to do the rating), then those not

implementing the lockout system could be hit under the Telcom

bill for not using feasible technology to protect distribution to

minors. Perhaps a generic typing mechanism would be better and

then "types" could be registered and used as the need comes

along. I also told my friend that I hoped the bill wasn't around

long enough to require any action on his part but he is,

nonetheless, forward-thinking by nature and concerned about the

risks to all. A request for your thoughts, from one who knows

very little about this area, is implied. Thanks! <p>

<h2>Abortion Clause Slipped In [The Telecom Reform Bill]</h2>



<H2>Telecommunications Reform: The New Playing Field</h2>



<H3>Seminar Discussion Thread</h3>



From: John E. Morris -- The American Lawyer - New York<br>

Date: Thu Feb  8 09:54:14 1996<br>

Subject: Abortion clause slipped in<p>



Last Append: Thu Feb  8 17:35:04 1996<p>



What do abortion and telecommunications have to do with each

other? Good question, but apparently someone in Congress thought

there was some connection. <p>



The New York-based Center for Reproductive Law and Policy issued

a press release yesterday (Wednesday) pointing out a provision

buried in the bill that amends the Comstock Act, which makes it a

crime to sent materials on contraceptives or abortion through the

mail. <p>



As the CRLP explains, the new bill amends 18 U.S.C. 1462(c) so

that it encompasses *taking or receiving via interactive computer

service* "any drug, medicine, article, or thing designed,

adapted, or intended for producing abortion . . . or any written

or printed card, letter, circular, book, pamphlet, advertisement,

or a notice of any kind giving information, directly or

indirectly, where, how, or of who, or by what means any of such

mentioned articles, matters, or things can be obtained or made."

<p>



The CRLP claims this could be read to ban everything from ads for

abortion services to communications about abortion-inducing

drugs. A suit to bar enforcement of the section has now been

filed in U.S. District Court in the Eastern District of New

York.<p>



This provision can be found in Title V, Section 507, which, like

all good stealth provisions, would never tip off anyone to what's

going on. According to Andrea Miller at the CRLP, Rep. Henry Hyde

spoke about his section in the Congressional Record, but Miller

isn't sure if Hyde was the one who got this language added: <p>



Sec. 507. CLARIFICATION OF CURRENT LAWS REGARDING COMMUNICATION

OF OBSCENE MATERIALS THROUGH THE USE OF COMPUTERS. <p>



(a) Importation or Transportation.--Section 1462 of title 18,

United States Code, is amended-- <p>



(1) in the first undesignated paragraph, by inserting "or

interactive computer service (as defined in section 230(e)(2) of

the Communications Act of 1934)" after <p>



"carrier"; and<p>



(2)__in the second undesignated paragraph-- <p>



(A) by inserting "or receives," after "takes"; <p>



(B) by inserting "or interactive computer service (as defined in

section 230(e)(2) of the Communications Act of 1934)" after

"common carrier"; and <p>



(C) by inserting "or importation" after "carriage". <p>



(b) Transportation for Purposes of Sale or Distribution.--The

first undesignated paragraph of section 1465 of title 18, United

States Code, is amended-- <p>



(1) by striking "transports in" and inserting "transports or

travels in, or uses a facility or means of,"; <p>



(2) by inserting "or an interactive computer service (as defined

in section 230(e)(2) of the Communications Act of 1934) in or

affecting such commerce" after <p>



"foreign commerce" the first place it appears; <p>



(3) by striking ", or knowingly travels in" and all that

follows through "obscene material in interstate or foreign

commerce," and inserting "of". <p>



(c) Interpretation.--The amendments made by this section are

clarifying and shall not be interpreted to limit or repeal any

prohibition contained in sections 1462 and 1465 of title 18,

United States Code, before such amendment, under the rule

established in United States v. Alpers, 338 U.S. 680 (1950). <p>



(Miller can be contacted at the CRLP at 212-514-5534. Simon

Heller of CRLP is handling the suit.) <p>

Subject: TRO Update<br>



Two attorneys from our office (Jim Crawford and Carl Solano)

attended the hearing in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania on

the ACLU motion for a TRO restraining enforcement of the the

Act's provisions restricting speech on the Internet. They report

that Judge Buckwalter seemed sympathetic to parts of the ACLU's

argument, but refrained from ruling on the motion for now. The

Government has until next Wednesday to file a brief in opposition

to the motion. The Government agreed not to enforce the

challenged provisions in the interim--i.e., until at least next

Wednesday, but did not go so far as to say that it would not

institute prosecutions in the future for speech that occurs

between now and next Wednesday--if the TRO is not issued. <p>

<H2>A Different FCC</h2>



<H2>Telecommunications Reform: The New Playing Field</h2>



<H3>Seminar Discussion Thread</h3>





From: Eleanor Kerlow -- DC Counsel Connect - Washington<br>

Date: Wed Feb  7 18:31:34 1996<br>

Subject: A Different FCC<p>



Last Append: Wed Feb 14 05:47:37 1996<p>



As Al Mamlet commented in the "Telecom Bill Passed" thread, the

bill requires the 

<A HREF="http://www.fcc.gov/">

FCC</a> to embark on a massive rulemaking schedule.

But these rulemakings are going to require the FCC to be a

different FCC. The regulations it will be writing will be more

short term, more structural, and more tied to the market. Indeed,

as some experts have observed, the agency may become a referee of

the open market. It will in effect be defining what is

competition. But isn't this a function of the Federal Trade

Commission or the Department of Justice? <p>



<hr><p>



Appended by: Phillip Spector -- Paul Weiss Rifkind - Washington<br> 

Date: Wed Feb  7 20:13:13 1996<br>

Subject: A Different FCC<p>



In fact, the FCC has always had a key role in promoting telecom

competition. From the very beginning, or at least since the

Communications Act of 1934, the focus of the FCC has been on

issues of monopoly, and indeed it was the telephone (AT&T) and

telegraph monopolies (Western Union) that led to the FCC's

creation. From a more modern perspective, I think most outside

observers would agree that the effort to enforce the MFJ

[Modified Final Judgment in the suit breaking up AT&T] through

the courts, and more particularly through Judge Greene, was a

failure in many respects; the process was slow, and poor Judge

Greene could not reasonably be expected to keep up to date on the

fast-changing telecom marketplace. Hence we should all welcome

Congress' effort to place the FCC more directly into the process

of determining when markets are competitive. <p>



<hr><p>



Appended by: Alfred Mamlet -- Steptoe & Johnson - Washington<br>

Date: Wed Feb  7 20:16:42 1996<br>

Subject: FCC Role<p>



Once new competitors have entered traditionally closed markets,

the FCC will play a vital role as referee. This is what Congress

intended and the Commissioners expect. <p>



The FCC will still have critical entry regulation for at least

the next few years. For example, the FCC will pass on RBOC

[Regional Bell Operating Companies]

applications to originate interLATA (long distance) service in

their service area (although the FCC is only given 90 days to act

an application). Similarly, the FCC will review RBOC applications

to become open video system providers (the FCC is only given 10

days here). <p>



It may well be that the FCC will act as referee even in its

gatekeeper role. For example, the Commission might force an RBOC

to take additional steps to open its local market in return for

being permitted to originate long distance service inside its

service area. <p>



<hr><p>



Appended by: Theodore Frank -- Arent Fox - Washington<br>

Date: Thu Feb  8 23:20:12 1996<br>

Subject:  A Different FCC <p>



Its not clear what additional conditions the FCC might impose on

BOC entry into in-region interLATA service. While Section

271(d)(3)(C) requires the FCC to make a general public interest

finding that entry is in the public interest, subsection (d)(4)

precludes the FCC from adding to the competitive checklist in

(c)(2)(B). Query, what kinds of public interest factors might the

Commission look at given that limitation? Alien ownership? <p>



<hr><p>



Appended by: Douglas Jarrett -- Keller & Heckman - Washington<br>

Date: Fri Feb  9 08:27:47 1996<br>

Subject: FCC's Role<p>



As noted above, Congress clearly intended to consolidate market entry

regulation in the FCC. Based on experience, the FCC has promoted market

entry to the extent allowable under law. Its decisions on CPE, enhanced

services and its "Competitive Carrier" proceeding have stimulated entry,

competition and innovation. The broad preemptive authority granted to

the FCC over state laws, regulations and other requirements having the

effect of prohibiting market entry is crucial to the entire statutory

scheme of promoting competition in the local loop. The local exhange

carriers and previously the Bell System exercised substantial influence

over state regulators and state legislatures in limiting and controlling

competitive entry, particularly in the local loop. A related duty

imposed on LECs prohibiting restrictions on resale may wreck havoc on

LEC pricing and market segmentation in regard to CEXTREX, ISDN, and

other services targeted for large customers. The provisions on universal

service will also impact LEC pricing and limit to some extent state

authority over local rates. Shared Tenant Services providers could

benefit enormously. <p>

Subject: What is Public Interest? <p>



Ted has put his finger on one issue sure to be fiercely litigated down

the road. Congress asked the FCC to verify compliance with a lengthy

checklist before turning RBOCs loose to originate long distance services

in their service areas. Congress said the FCC could not add to the

checklist. However, Congress separately gave the FCC power to consider

the public interest in letting them proceed. <p>



Surely the RBOCs will argue that meeting the checklist is enough and the

Commission can't require them to do more under the guise of "public

interest" without effectively adding to the checklist. <p>



On the other hand, competitors will claim that this would render the

separate public interest test null and void (or the Latin equivalent).

They will argue that there are other steps in the public interest that

should be taken to make the local loop truly competitive, or long

distance competition really fair. The public interest component of the

test will provide a potential basis for these arguments. <p>

Subject: A Different FCC<p>



While we may be seeing a different FCC, the state PUC's , it would

appear from what I'm reading here and elsewhere, will be even more

radically different than in the past. I'm not sure I understand what's

left for them to do in the future. Could someone address: 1-What role is

provided for the PUCs, if any, for determining whether competition

exists in the local loop? 2-Do the PUCs have any responsibility in

determining if the 14 point check list is met? 3-What other role, if

any, do the PUCs have during the implementation of the new federal law?

4-What role, if any, is left for the PUCs regarding rates, pricing, etc?

Am I correct to understand that the pre-emptive language regarding rate

of return regulation is not in the bill as passed? 5-In general terms,

what's left for the PUCs to do in the future? <p>

Subject: FCC's SPECIAL MANDATE<p>



This thread opened with the suggestion that the FCC's jurisdiction is

somehow redundant. <p>



One important element of the FCC's separate "public interest" analysis

arises from the special nature of telecommunications. While anti-trust

considerations are surely of great import, traditional economic analyses

are not enough. The product being moved is data, information and speech,

not pork bellies or widgets. There is a First Amendment affect in the

transmission of information, as the Supreme Court recognized early on in

the <i>Associated Press v. U.S.</i> case. <p>



I would argue that these First Amendment and information policy

questions are increasingly important. The consequence of convergence is

that there no longer is a strict difference between carriers and mass

media. The central jurisdictional issue is content control. As long as

telcos were merely common carriers, the First Amendment issues were not

often large or important. But once common carriers - directly or through

"separate subsidiaries" - become editors, problems begin. Take

dial-a-porn --- please!! Even in jurisdictions where dial-a-porn issues

have been moved away from local telco control (as in NY), someone

decides if a carrier is carrying fully protected, indecent or obscene

speech. <p>



Telcos have crossed the content Rubicon in the new law. They sought and

received non-common carrier status in providing many of their services.

Where they are exercising editorial control over programs in even a

portion of their "OVS" platforms, for example, the question of how their

economic might affects the free flow of ideas becomes relevant to the

"public interest" test. That. among other things, is what the FCC does.

Subject: PUC's<p>



The PUC's have a limited role in regard to the 14-point checklist. In

those instances where there is no interconnection agreement and the RBOC

wants to obtain interLATA authority, it must first call on the state PUC

to verify that it meets the checklist. This " Statement" of approval is

then filed with the FCC in the RBOC's petition for authority to provide

inregion interLATA service in that state. However, the FCC will set the

parameters of the 14 point checklist. What the PUCs' lose is being the

agencies with the final say on entry into any telecommunications

service. This is most crucial in the area of local loop competition.

Ratemaking remains with the states for intrastate services, but the

universal services provisions of the new law suggest that PUCs lose some

discretion in ratemaking in that state universal service subsidies and

payments must be consistent with the FCC's interstate provisions and all

subsidies must be specific and explicit. The legislation also limits

significantly LEC intrastate resale restrictions which are common in

some LEC local service tariffs. If you would like to talk further,

please call. Doug Jarrett 202 434-4180. <p>

Subject: PUC Authority<p>



PUCs will still have plenty to do.  Let's start with two

examples.  First, the heart of the local competition provisions is

the requirement for the incumbent LEC to negotiate an

interconnection agreement with a new entrant.  The interconnection

agreement must essentially cover all the issues on the 14 point

checklist if raised by the new entrant.  State PUCs must approve

the interconnection agreement.  Moreover, if the parties cannot

conclude an agreement themselves, either one can call on the State

PUC to conduct binding arbitration.  Since these interconnection

agreements will set the essential detailed terms for local

competition, the State PUC involvement is quite significant.<p>



Second, State PUCs must be consulted by the FCC whenever an RBOC

applies to originate long distance service inside its service

territory.  At this point, a State PUC criticism of the manner

in which an RBOC is opening up the local market could be the kiss

of death.  Therefore, the State PUCs will have significant

influence here.<p>

<h2>Regulatory Jurisdiction</h2>



<H2>Telecommunications Reform: The New Playing Field</h2>



<H3>Seminar Discussion Thread</h3>



From: Joel Reidenberg -- Fordham University - New York<br>

Date: Wed Feb  7 15:00:49 1996<br>

Subject: Regulatory Jurisdiction<p>



Last Append: Thu Feb 15 00:31:07 1996<p>



I am teaching some basics for the Telecom Reform Act and have

raised the question about new regulatory powers. Does anyone know

if the final passage preserved the Federal-State Joint Board? We

are on-line, so any answers posted before 4pm EST 2/7/96, can be

incorporated in the class discussion. <p>

Subject: Joint Board and Federalism<p>



Certainly, there is nothing in the bill that abolishes Joint

Boards (panels of FCC and State utility commissioners). Indeed

creation of a new plan for universal service is largely delegated

to a Joint Board. <p>



There are a number of interesting federalism twists. While the

Republicans preached state rights, there is broad federal

preemption of state entry barriers into the local telephone

market. Indeed, the FCC has the power to preempt a state statute,

regulation, policy, etc that it believes is an entry barrier. <p>



State utility commissions are given the critical job to review

the important interconnection agreements negotiated between the

incumbent local exchange carrier and a new entrant. However,

review of these State commission decisions will be in federal

district courts. <p>

Subject: the state's role<p>



One of the interesting parts of this Act is the role given to the

State PUCs. While they can no longer regulate entry, they will

play a major role in determining whether there is sufficient

competition to allow BOC entry into in-region interLATA service.

Their role with respect to rural telecoms is also signficant and,

of course, the question of universal service is something that

must be worked out with them. They are also not striped entirely

of some rate regulation. How their actions will work vis-a-vis

the FCCs is likely to be an intriguing development. <p>



<hr><p>



Appended by: Douglas Jarrett -- Keller & Heckman - Washington<br>

Date: Fri Feb  9 08:37:04 1996<br>

Subject: Federalism<p>



Echoing some earlier statements, the legislation shifts the

all-important authority over market entry away from the states to the

FCC. Judge Greene is largely out of the picture and the role of the

Department of Justice is reduced substantially. Broad preemptive

authority is granted to the FCC largely to support local loop

competition which is one of the primary goals of the legislation. One

could argue that the historic demarcation between federal and state

regulation over telecommunications required tempering to ensure

competition. Moreover, a more uniform regulatory scheme with regard to

market entry makes more sense for an industry that is not only national

but global in scope.<p>

Thanks to all who responded to my post.  The comments provide

helpful insights for my seminar.  I certainly think the Federalism

twists are intriguing between the pre-emption of  state entry

barriers to the local loop with correspondant state control over

interconnection and assessments of sufficient competition.  The

only certainty seems to be future employment for my students!<p>

<H2>International Implications</h2>



<H2>Telecommunications Reform: The New Playing Field</h2>



<H3>Seminar Discussion Thread</h3>

Date: Thu Feb  8 13:22:42 1996<br>

Subject: International Implications<p>



Last Append: Sun Feb 11 13:11:24 1996<p>



So far, we have been focusing on the domestic implications of the

bill, but this is a global industry. How will the bill govern

say, joint ventures between a Bell operating company and a

foreign phone company? Merger between US cable company and

foreign electric utility? What if the Bell Atlantic/Nynex merger

was between Bell Atlantic and the French phone company? To what

extent does the bill change things from the way they are done

now? Where is there the most certainty and the most uncertainty

with regard to international telecommunications? <p>

Subject: International<p>



Other than a minor amendment on officers and directors, the

legislation does not include the much debated reciprocity

amendments to Sec. 310(b) of the Communications Act.

Jurisdictional turf battles between Congressional committees led

the telecom bill sponsors to delete largely comparable provisions

in both bills. The FCC has addressed this question in its omnibus

international rulemaking decision in IB Docket No. 95-22 and in

its recent order allowing substantial investments by France

Telecom and the German monopoly provider in Sprint. <p>

As I understand it, petitions for reconsideration (by Telefonica

Larga Distancia de Puerto Rico, and British Telecom North

Ameritch) are still pending in the FCC's market entry rulemaking

proceeding. Any intelligence on this? <p>



<hr><p>



Appended by: Alfred Mamlet -- Steptoe & Johnson - Washington<br>

Date: Sat Feb 10 06:20:22 1996<br>

Subject: International Implications<p>



Entry by foreign telephone companies is still restrained by the

Section 310, which generally limits indirect foreign ownership in

a radio station license to 25%, absent an FCC waiver. Both the

House and Senate bills contained provisions generally providing

that the FCC should grant waivers if the foreign country was a

signatory to a liberalization treaty (such as the WTO treaty

being negotiated now) or permitted U.S. companies to make

reciprocal investments. Democratic congressional leaders

(Hollings and Dingell) obtained removal of this provision from

the Conference version in last-minute bargaining. <p>



The FCC proceeded by rulemaking to provide that reciprocity would

be considered in requests to waive Section 310(b)(4) indirect

ownership limits (the FCC is powerless to waive the 20% direct

ownership limit in 310(b)(3), which the Senate and House bills

proposed to liberalize). The FCC also adopted a rule that would

consider reciprocity in applications to enter the international

services market under Section 214 by examining the openness of a

carrier's affiliated markets on applications to serve those

markets. <p>



As for petitions for reconsideration, several were devoted

largely to private line issues (WorldCom, MCI and part of BT

North America). TLD's petition (filed by me) asked the Commission

to limit its consideration of reciprocity to a foreign carrier's

home market, and not to consider affiliations in third countries.

In the alternative, TLD asked the Commission to apply the same

rule to U.S. carriers' applications to serve foreign markets

where they have controlling investments in a foreign carrier. BT

North America also asked the Commission to apply the same rule to

U.S. firms. Finally, Cable & Wireless asked the Commission not to

apply the rule on routes where a foreign-affiliated carrier was

already authorized to provide service. <p>

Straight from the White House WWW server, here is the advance
release on the signing, which is occurring today: <p>

PRESIDENT CLINTON SIGNS THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACT OF 1996 <p>

February 8, 1996<p>

President Clinton today will sign the Telecommunications Act of 1996 in
the Main Reading Room at the Library of Congress -- one of the nation's
premier information centers and educational resources. The bill is a
significant step towards achieving the President's objective, outlined
in his State of the Union Address, to connect America's classrooms and
libraries to the Internet by the year 2002. In his remarks, the
President will also talk about another important challenge issued in his
State of the Union -- the challenge to parents to take responsibility
for their children's lives. He will emphasize the importance of the
V-Chip or Violence Chip legislation, which allows parents to decide what
programs are too violent or inappropriate for their children. <p> 

During the ceremony, President Clinton will use two historically
significant pens to sign the legislation. The first is the pen President
Eisenhower used to sign into law the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956,
legislation which was sponsored by Senator Albert Gore, Sr. The Highway
Act, which created the nation's vast interstate highway system, is in
many ways analogous to the Telecommunications Act which will help to
develop the nation's information superhighway. The second is an
electronic pen, which the President will use to sign the act into law on
a digital tablet to be sent into cyberspace. <p> 

In addition, the Vice President will interact electronically with
Washington, D.C. students who will demonstrate how they use technology
in the classroom. The students from Calvin Coolidge High School will
communicate with the Vice President over a high-speed fiber optic
network. <p> 

The audience at the ceremony will include educators, industry
executives, representative of various children's organizations, Members
of Congress, Cabinet Secretaries, public interest group representatives,
and various state and local officials. <p> 

The following is a program for the event: <p><UL>

<LI>  Secretary Brown will open the program 

<LI>  The Vice President will make remarks 

<LI>  The Vice President participates in interactive presentation 

<LI>  The President makes remarks

SPA Blackens Web Page to Protest Communications Decency Act<p>

Joins Web-Wide Protest<p>

Washington, D.C., Feb. 8, 1996 In conjunction with thousands of Web
Sites around the country, the SPA turned its home page black at 11:00
this morning. It will remain black for 48 hours in protest of Congress
passing and President Clinton signing the new telecommunications bill,
which includes the Communications Decency Act that restricts freedom of
speech, encourages censorship, and will stifle the evolution of the
Internet.<p>

While SPA supports and applauds significant portions of
telecommunications reform bill, we are strongly opposed to a specific
provision that will handcuff on-line providers and end users and quite
likely violate First Amendment rights. The Communications Decency Act
would impose jail terms of up to two years and fines up to $250,000
($500,000 for a company) on anyone who "knowingly" posts "indecent"
material in a place accessible to minors, such as the World Wide Web.
This "indecency" standard creates unprecedented criminal liability for
private expression that may be construed as pornographic or otherwise
unsuitable for minors. The legal standard is vague, unconstitutional,
and will choke-off free expression and use of the Internet. In response
to the President's signature, several consumer and civil liberties
groups are poised to challenge the indecency standard in court. In
addition, web-masters across the nation are joining forces in the
48-hour blackout of their web sites as a protest. Additional information
about the protest can be found at 
<A HREF="http://www.vtw.org">http://www.vtw.org</a>, or
<A HREF="http://www.cdt.org">http://www.cdt.org</a>. These are two of
the coalition organizations
coordinating the information regarding passage of this act and the
protest.<p> 

SPA and its members are committed to providing parents and other
consumers with simple and effective information about the content of
entertainment software. Last year, SPA and other software associations
made good on this commitment by establishing the Recreational Software
Advisory Council. By now, this private and independent organization has
assigned objective content labels to over 350 entertainment software
titles.<p> 

SPA's opposition to the Communications Decency Act does not represent
any change in its position regarding liability of online service
providers and Internet access providers for copyright infringement.
Because SPA relies on current copyright law -- including liability for
direct and indirect infringement -- to protect hundreds of software
companies from piracy, it is deeply concerned tht any change in existing
law could make that fight more difficult or less effective. Obscenity
and copyright infringement are different offenses, and deserve different
legal standards. Courts and Congress have recognized this difference for
many years, and SPA remains very concerned about efforts to confuse the
two. <p>

SPA's focus is on companies developing and publishing software
applications and interactive content. SPA is the leading trade
association of the desktop software industry, representing the leading
publishers as well as many start-up firms in the business, consumer and
education markets. Its 1,200 members account for 90 percent of the sales
of the U.S. packaged software industry. Hundreds of these companies look
to SPA to protect their intellectual property and promote trade in the
United States and around the world. SPA is an international organization
with offices both in the United States and Europe. SPA press releases

<H2>Decency Suit</h2>



<H2>Telecommunications Reform: The New Playing Field</h2>

Subject: Decency Suit<p>



Last Append: Fri Feb 16 08:58:37 1996<p>



The ACLU [American Civil Liberties Union] and a cast of

thousands

have now announced the filing of an overbreadth attack on

the

indecent speech provisions of the bill. This raises a few

questions. <p>



No one has been prosecuted under that provision. No one is

likely

ever to be prosecuted for such things as reproducing the

Supreme

Court's <i>Pacifica</i> decision. So why shouldn't this suit

be rejected

as a request for an advisory opinion? <p>



<i>Pacifica</i> distinguished broadcasting from print

without relying

once on the notion of a scarce spectrum that belongs to the

public. Instead, the focus was on the fact that the

broadcast

came into the home, was hard to avoid until after at least

some

offense had been given, and was easily accessible even to

young

children. Right now, the Net feels a bit more like print

than TV

on that set of standards. But will it feel that way for

long?

Java and Netscape 2.0 will give us singing, and dancing on

the

Web, followed shortly by cussing and stripping. As the Web

gets

more like TV, will the <i>Pacifica</i> rationale have more

force?

(Saying the <i>Pacifica</i> Court was clueless is not an

answer, or at

least not a lawyer's answer.) <p>

While the <I>Pacifica</i> court itself did not rely on

spectrum

scarcity, subsequent Supreme Court decisions have made it

clear

that the spectrum rationale played a key part in the

<i>Pacifica</i>

decision. Thus, the Exon amendment will test whether the

intrusion argument can be used to support the regulation of

indecent speech. Part of the problem for the government,

however,

is that Pacifica only justified channeling of indecent

material

not a ban. Exon is a ban. <p>

I don't know that it's necessary to say that the

<i>Pacifica</i> court was

clueless. It is perhaps worth noting that the crucial

sections of

Stevens' opinion -- IV.A and B -- commanded only a

plurality. Is that a

lawyer's answer? : ) <p>



And as for the suggestion that the challenge by the ACLU et

al. fails

the case or controversy requirement, I think a reading of

the complaint

-- joined by such organizations as Stop Prison Rape -- makes

abundantly

clear that what is at issue is not only the Seven Dirty

Words, but also

a good deal of graphic sexual language. <p>

There's no doubt that <I>Pacifica's</i> plurality approved

only

channeling of indecency. That will make a ban hard to

uphold. On the

other hand, what alternatives does government have if it

wants, quite

reasonably, to prevent kids from exposure to certain kinds

of content?

<p>



The most obvious answer is that there is software to do

that. But what

sort of answer is that? Parents who don't have a lot of

money to spare

are supposed to spend money on software that will never be

completely up

to date and that none of the most offensive Internet sites

will lift a

finger to support? I doubt that we'd be impressed by an

adult book store

owner claiming "I have a constitutional right to sell this

stuff in

24-hour vending machines next to the elementary school; if

you don't

want your kids buying it, don't give them cash for lunch.

Write checks

to the school instead." <p>



The "parents can stop it" argument has always struck me as

only modestly

persuasive (and a bit arrogant). Who can do better? <p>

The Article III standing requirement has not been strictly

cases of First Amendment challenges to criminal statutes

which ban

categories of speech. The Helms Amendment cases (one of

which was <i>Sable

indecent telephony,

are recent examples. <p>

Ted Frank's reading of <I>Pacifica</i> and subsequent

decisions has

force, but if the S.G. gets his way, we may soon get a

rereading. <p>



In its brief in Alliance for Community <I>Media v. FCC</i>

and <I>DAETC

v. FCC</i>, the United States has expressly asked the

Supreme Court to

extend the <i>Pacifica</i> rationale to cable, based on the

current

pervasiveness of cable. <p>



A victory here would certainly assist in defense of the Exon

amendment.

Thanks for that URL, Mark. We're retrieving the ACLU

complaint from the

EFF's website to load in the library. <p>



In the meantime, we've loaded another complaint filed by the

editor of

"American Reporter," an electronic newspaper delivered by

e-mail and

over the World Wide Web. Besides asserting that the

"indecency" portions

of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 are unconstitutionally

vague, the

complaint also claims that the provisions place an unfair

burden on

electronic publications compared to traditional print

newspapers. <p>



And editor Joe Shea has presented the court with an example

of the sort

of content that the act might apply to, a profanity-filled

editorial.

Does that give him a better case or controversy argument or

not? <p>



Stewart, your questions are good ones. Do we want to

"channel" the

indecent material available online in order to protect

children? If so,

how? <p>

Stewart Baker's comment seems to me to go too far. The kinds

of problems

he raises exist with dial-a-porn, but the Court had no

trouble striking

down a complete ban. It noted that use of credit cards, etc.

was a less

restrictive alternative. Similar arguments would appear to

exist with

respect to interactive computer services. <p>

It's at times like this that I wish we could find the 17

year old

plaintiff -- or "Teenagers United for Freedom of Speech" --

to join the

fray. While there is a lot of case law on parental rights to

control

their children, I see nothing in the First Amendment that

says it only

applies to adults. Would it be tougher for the Supreme Court

to

pompously uphold Exon if some teenagers -- with the advice

and consent

of their parents -- stepped in to prevent their First

Amendment right to

see, read or hear smut from being trampled? <p>

Subject: <I>Pacifica</i> Forever?<p>



Stewart's pride of authorship with respect to

<I>Pacifica</i> notwithstanding,

it is important to note that every Supreme Court decision

since 1978,

and many lower court decisions, have emphasized that the

<I>Pacifica</i>

holding is quite narrow. It is doubtful that its conclusions

can be

stretched to fit other technologies that are not, by any

stretch of the

imagination, as ubiqutous as radio or television. Nor are

computers

uniquely accessible to children, including those "too young

to read."

<p>



The analogy of a vending machine for porn in the elementary

schools is

amusing, but beside the point. It is not as if the Amatuer

Action BBS

operators installed terminals in people's homes and then

suggested that

they could block the input if they didn't like the message.

Rather,

people chose to buy computers in the first place, they make

a further

choice to go online, usually by paying a subscription fee to

a third

party, and they may make an additional choice about whether

to use the

screening software provided with most commercial services.

In addition,

they may install added screening software. <p>



Remember, <I>Pacifica</i> is an exception to normal

constitutional

standards that has been applied in a limited context. It is

not the

norm, and is inappropriate when applied to online

technologies. <p>

Subject: <I>Pacifica</i> Forever?<p>



At various times in our long relationship, Bob has been a

valued

colleague, an effective gadfly, and (just yesterday) a

ferocious

debating partner. But I'm not sure he's answered the

hypothetical. He

says people choose to buy computers and online services.

True enough,

but they also choose to send their kids to school on public

sidewalks.

The question is whether they and their government have any

right to

control what kids encounter on the sidewalks or in

cyberspace. I don't

think that would be a hard question if it weren't for the

damage done to

the rights of adults. (No one doubts, surely, that

government can

require adult book stores to exclude children.) <p>



It strikes me as a bit weird to argue that parents don't

have to get

computers or online services if they don't want their kids

accessing

cyberHustler or worse. The online services and cyberspace

advocates have

been telling us for years that we don't have a choice: we

have to be on

line to gain access (for ourselves and our children) to the

wonders of

the information age. Indeed, Bob seems to be making an

argument he'd

abhor if applied to him: that people who don't share his

values don't

belong on line. <p>



Setting aside Bob's "Cyberspace: Love It or Leave It"

argument, we're

back to the claim that people who are uncomfortable with the

contents of

alt.sex.hamsters.duct.tape should spend money for software

of dubious

efficacy. And that takes me back to the porno news racks by

the

elementary school. I doubt that it would be sufficient to

argue that

parents could avoid the problem by walking their kids to

school or

paying for lunch by check. Bob: Do you agree, or do you

think that

adults have a first amendment right to say or sell anything

anywhere

without regard to the effect on children? <p>

Subject: Regulating online indecency<p> 



A few observations: Stewart refers to "parents who don't

have a lot of

money" being put in a position where they have to shell out

for NetNanny

etc. I wonder how numerous these indigent parents are, given

that home

access to the net generally costs anywhere from $100/annum

to

you-name-it. <p>



As for the public sidewalks, I am inclined to think that

<I>Cohen v.

California</i> dooms the little tykes (including mine) to

encountering the

public expression of all sorts of vigorous, robust, and yes,

indecent

thoughts and opinions. Specifically, let us recall that

"there were

women and children present in the [courthouse] corridor," to

quote from

the opinion. I don't believe that the adult-bookstore cases

undercut

<I>Cohen</i> as to private noncommercial speech. <p>

Subject: Problem with Indecency<p> 



I propose two responses to the questions posed. I believe

that the

vending machine example and related ideas overlook a very

important

point. While I have a great deal of trouble reconciling

placement

restrictions with the First Amendment, at least in those

cases there are

other places where the "objectionable" material can be

vended. On the

Internet, there is no other place. There is no possible way

to

absolutely assure that the visitor to an "adult content"

site is of age.

Even a digital signature would prove nothing more than that

the "signer"

is unique, but there is no guarantee that the person sending

the

signature isn't the 16-year-old babysitter of the signature

"owner."

Furthermore, even if the signature is being used by the

"owner" the

signature itself is not a representation that the owner is

of age. <p>



Thus, the only way to avoid "indecency" is to ban it

entirely from the

online world, meaning that adults cannot have full freedom

of expression

<I>anywhere</i> on the Internet. <p>



Second, I believe that the issue is ripe because, in light

of the

foregoing, speech on the Internet is going to be chilled

well past the

freezing point, since the only way to be certain of avoiding

prosecution

is to say nothing that can possibly be interpreted as

indecent. The new

act not only does not give guidance to what is to be

considered

indecent, but it also contains no protection against

"political"

definitions of indecency, e.g., a prosecutor in very

conservative

community bringing a prosecution on the grounds that the

very concept of

homosexuality is indecent, so that even the words "gay" or

"lesbian"

would be criminally offensive. Similarly, I think it is

quite possible

that a non-graphic and non-sexual discussion of abortion

will be termed

"indecent" by some prosecutor. As of now, anyone who

discusses any topic

that relates to sex or sexuality, or even any political

implications of

sex or sexuality, faces a risk that somewhere out there a

prosecutor

will file criminal charges. For you doubters, you may still

be able to

find an online copy of a warrant filed by a justice of the

peace in

Texas charging Howard Stern with incitement for his negative

comments

about Selina on his syndicated radio program. <p>

Subject: Burning the house<p>



Stewart's position was rejected by the Court in the early

1950's (!),

when Justice Frankfurter (!) commented on banning speech for

adults in

order to protect the sensibilities of children : "Surely,

this is to

burn the house to roast the pig." (He must have just been to

a Passover

Seder). That principle has been repeatedly invoked by the

Court in

obscenity/indecency cases, as recently as <I>Sable</i> (9-0

holding that ban on

teleporn indecency is unconstitutional). The dial-a-porn

regulations

struck down in <I>Sable</i> reached a lot less valuable

speech, and impaired

the speech interests of adults, a lot less than the new

"Communications

Decency Act" does. So, for all the pontificating about how

difficultit

is for adults to protect the sensibilities of their kids

without scaring

all this stuff off the net with criminal sanctions, the

Court is likely

to just say we'll have to try. <p>



<HR><p>

Subject: Decency Suit <p>



I think we can take it as given that the Court is unwilling

to accept

child-protection as a rationale for limiting all speech to

that which is

fit for children. That may in fact doom the Exon amendment,

since it is

hard to see how indecent adult speech can occur on the net

and still be

consistent with the law (Unless one views the net as just

one of many

avenues for speech. Which raises an interesting

contradiction in the

comments above. Is it really consistent to say that the net

is a luxury

available only to the well-off, so we can ignore the cost of

filtering

software, while also arguing that the net is so important as

a means of

communicating that it must itself encompass a full range of

adult speech

for the first amendment to be effective?) <p>



The hard question, for me at least, is whether

child-protection would

justify some government intervention in on-line discourse.

I'm not sure

that it would be unconstitutional to require digital

signatures, in

particular a signature that included information about date

of birth, to

gain access to adult fora. The peculiarities of public key

make this

concept ineffective if access to the forum is free

(signatures are easy

to give away if the signature's owner is willing to do so),

but it would

be highly effective if users were charged for access (as

they surely

will be in most cases) on the basis of signatures. <p>



There are real privacy issues with such a scheme, but over

the long run,

we will need to do something about the risks to kids on the

net if we

want it to be more than a curiousity. So I repeat my query

in a more

open-ended way: Can government constitutionally regulate the

net in

order to protect children from some of the content that

adults have a

right to see? I think it can, in fact I think it has to if

we are going

to have real community on line, but I am not sure we have

yet found

tools sufficiently fine-tuned to do so. <p>

Subject: More <I>Pacifica</i> Stuff <p>



I believe the above messages adequately answer Stewart

Baker's arguments

regarding regulating the Internet. But I will add only a

couple of

points. First, it appears that Stewart pretty much concedes

that the

<I>Pacifica</i> rationale does not apply to online services

or to cyberspace.

It is not the same as broadcasting and cannot be held to the

same lax

indecency standard. Instead, he seeks to argue that there

should be some

ability to regulate content in cyberspace. While the

applicability of

obscenity law or harmful to minors restrictions may be an

open question

in cyberspace, it is a matter far beyond the question

resented by

Section 502 of the Telecommunications Act. Second, it is a

nice debating

point to argue that parents who care about their children

will be kept

off the net by the expense of screening software, but it is

a bit beside

the point. We are talking about people who can afford

computers in the

first place, and in most cases, have already shelled out

money for

online services (which include screening software as part of

the price

of admission). Any added expense occasioned by additional

safeguards

surely is marginal. As to the effectiveness of the software,

the Exon

amendment depends on screening anyway, doesn't it? Moreover,

speaking as

a father of four, there still needs to be a role for parents

to play,

doesn't there? In any event, the net cannot be compared to

an adult

bookstore -- it is all bookstores. The "adult" portions

cannot be

regulated without regulating all of it, and as I pointed

out, the

broadcast indecency standard is too insensitive to First

Amendment

rights to be applied in this context. <p>

Subject: What is the Best Analogy<P>



As lawyers, we have all spent a good deal of  mental energy

trying

to select the best legal analogy (and set of precedents) by

which

to judge events on the Internet.  Whether the issue is

political

speech, obscene speech, indecent action scenes, or a variety

of

"how to" guides, I think the entire legal community needs to

break

out of the mold previously used to regulate speech and other

forms

of communication. The Internet is a radically new mechanism,

and

reasoning by analog will lead us astray.<P>



The bench and the bar need to ask several questions - what

are the

possible models for observation and control of Internet

activities?  What effects occur with each model?  How will

the

institutions and individuals who participate respond to each

model?   Will each model actually achieve the goals in the

real

world, where encryption and other devices will come into

play? 

At what cost can any level of control be achieved, and is

the cost

 worthwhile?<P>



Beyond the hype and the posturing over the current

legislation,

the real challenge to the legal community is to not pick an

analogy from the past.<P>

Subject: Cyberspace & Analogies<p>



John Fraser's concerns regarding our tendency to "reason by

analogy" in the context of online legal questions is one

that has

been proffered by many who have published in this area --

the

common refrain is that the fundamental characteristics and

dynamics of online communication are so different and unique

that

no analogy to other media are adequate and that a whole new

"paradigm" of First Amendment law needs to be constructed. 

While

I agree that analogies can lead to problems and erroneous

results

(e.g., Prodigy's analogy of its role to that of the New York

Times

in deciding what to print in its newspaper), I don't think

it is

either realistic or appropriate to disregard analogous

contexts in

other media.<p>



Recognizing the philosophical complexity of the point, I

still

think that the essence of justice is affording similar

treatment

to people who are similarly situated.  "Reasoning by

analogy" is

really just a way of  articulating one's view of the

appropriate

legal principle to apply to a particular form of conduct. 

If the

nature of CompuServe's conduct in making "Rumorville"

available to

its subscribers is the same as the conduct of a newsstand

owner or

bookseller who makes the "National Enquirer" available to

his

patrons by placing the publication on his shelves, the same

rule

of law should apply.  That is what justice is.   If

including the

words "Fuck the CDA" in your signature line to a posting on

a

USENET Newsgroup is conduct that is no different from having

the

words "Fuck the Draft" embroidered on your jacket and

wearing it

in public, then the same rule of law should apply.  If the

signature line on your USENET posting is materially

different from

Cohen's jacket, then it is up to Congress, the Department of

Justice, and Clinton to articulate that difference.  The

definition of "justice" -- IMHO -- requires the use of

analogies.<p>



Incidentally, I suspect  that many supporters of section

502(2) of

the CDA would argue that it does not prohibit one from using

the

words "Fuck the CDA" in your USENET signature line.  (Who

knows

until the courts rule?  That's the vagueness point...)  They

would

object, however, to a graphic, visual depiction of oral sex

in

your signature line.  Somehow, I gotta believe the Supremes

would

have had a hard time acknowledging that Mr. Cohen had a

First

Amendment right to paste a large, explicit photograph of

such

activity on the back of his jacket as he  walked around  the

courthouse.<p>

Counsel Connect does not "block" access to those newsgroups;

it

hairsplitting --

it's an important distinction that bears directly on this

No online service carries every newsgroup. System operators

which ones their members are likely to want. It's not an

all-or-nothing situation. Choosing to carry a newsgroup

means

taking up bandwidth and server space.<p>



Counsel Connect chooses not to go out of its way to carry

numerous law newsgroups not found elsewhere. One doesn't

prove

one's bona fides, in the censorship debate, by publishing or

CNN and other news outlets are reporting that a Philadelphia

federal court today granted the ACLU's request for a

temporary

restraining order. We hear indirectly from the ACLU that the

judge

only gave the ACLU part of what it wanted, however. I'm at a

loss

for what that might mean.<p>



Unfortunately, we haven't been able to get a hold of the

order

yet. We expect to get it tomorrow, if not tonight. When we

do,

we'll report what it says more thoroughly and, of course,

post it

online.<p>

Subject: Judge Buckwalter's TRO<p>



While I too have yet to see the judge's order, I've seen a

summary

of it that went out on an anti-CDA mailing list this

afternoon.

Counsel for EPIC (Electronic Privacy Information Center)

described

it as enjoining enforcement of section 502(a) -- the

provision

respecting harassment using a "telecommunications device" --

but

denying the injunction as to 502(d), the provision relating

to

minors and indecent materials.<p>



So far as I'm aware, there are two important differences

between

these subsections.  Most obviously, (a) simply uses the term

"indecent", while (d) spells out the FCC "patently offensive

etc."

definition.  I do not know whether Judge Buckwalter

concluded that

the former is void for vagueness; while I'm disinclined to

think

he granted the TRO on this basis, I'm at a loss to imagine

what

other excuse he might have that wouldn't apply to (d). 

(Frankly,

subsection (a) has long seemed to me far less

constitutionally

suspect.)<p>



More important than this difference, though, is that as I

read

(a), it does not apply to Internet communications.  A later

section of the CDA defines "telecommunications device" as

excluding the use of an "interactive computer service,"

which is

itself expressly defined to encompass communications over

the

Internet.<p>



In short: this sounds like it will make for great headlines

--

"Judge Blocks Smut Bill" -- but in reality the glass is

appreciably less than half full for plaintiffs.  It should

be an

interesting opinion all the same.<p>

Subject: Clearer Yet Muddier<p>





News reports this report support Mr. Eckenwiler's summary,

as well

as his assumption that opponents of the Communication

Decency Act

are not fully satisfied by the ruling.<p>



The judge barred enforcement of the section dealing with

"indecent" materials; finding it vague. He has, however,

allowed

enforcement of provisions prohibiting display of materials

are

"patently offensive," saying the law clearly defines the

term.<p> 



But the New York Times today quotes an ACLU lawyer saying

that

"indecency and patently offensive mean the same thing"

(business

section front).<p>



Judge Buckwalter also denied the TRO regarding provisions

criminalizing abortion discussions.<p>



We are continuing our efforts to get the order online, but

if the

stories I've read are any indication, it will illuminate

only what

the judge said . . . not what he meant.<p>



Here's the latest full Reuters dispatch, pulled from the

News menu

searching for the word <indecent>.<p>



reuter               Reut19:06 02-15-96<p>





U.S. judge blocks internet-indecency legislation<p>









By Randall Mikkelsen<p>



PHILADELPHIA (Reuter) - In closely watched suit over

free-speech

in cyberspace, a federal judge Thursday temporarily blocked

new

legislation prohibiting distribution of indecent material to

minors over computer networks.<p>



However, U.S. District Court Judge Ronald Buckwalter said in

his

ruling that it prevented only enforcement of penalties

against

indecent material, and not obscene material.<p>



''It's a partial victory,'' said Stefan Presser, legal

director of

the Philadelphia chapter of the American Civil Liberties

Union.<p>



The ACLU and 19 other groups filed suit to block the law,

known as

the Communications Decency Act, as soon as it was signed

into law

by President Clinton last Thursday as part of a larger

telecommunications reform bill.<p>



The bill would make it a crime punishable by $250,000 in

fines and

two years in prison to send ''indecent'' material that could

be

viewed by a minor over a computer network.<p>



The suit against the act and the request for a preliminary

injunction blocking it will next be heard by a three-judge

district court panel under an expedited procedure. That

would

enable any subsequent appeal to be heard directly by the

U.S.

Supreme Court. A date for the hearing has not been set.<p>



Buckwalter said the Communications Decency Act failed to

define

''indecent'' sufficiently and may be too vague to be

constitutional.<p>



''Where I do feel that the plaintiffs have raised serious,

substantial, difficult and doubtful questions is in their

argument

that the (legislation) is unconstitutionally vague in the

use of

the undefined term 'indecent,''' Buckwalter said.<p>



A date for the next court hearing has not been set.<p>



The suit contends the legislation was technologically

impossible

to carry out and would unfairly hamper free expression over

mushrooming computer networks such as the Internet by

penalizing a

potentially wide variety of sexual-related information.<p>



The Justice Department argued in a brief filed on Wednesday

that

the act was clearly worded to apply only to ''patently

offensive''

material and aimed only to keep it inaccessible to children.

It

said such provisions were constitutionally valid.<p>



But Buckwalter said in his ruling, ''depending on who is

making

the judgment, indecent could include a whole range of

conduct not

encompassed by 'patently offensive.''<p>



Said Presser, ''to the extent that Congress has not given

the

people of the United States guidance on indecency, that is

not

permitted. They can't criminalize something they don't fully

explain.''<p>



He said the ACLU would continue to fight against the

obscenity

provisions of the legislation.<p>



A Justice Department spokesman said the agency had no

immediate

comment on the ruling.<p>



Legal experts have said the case is an major test of the

limits of

free speech on computer networks in the United States.<p>



Such issues have also begun to be raised in other countries.

China

on Thursday asked users of the Internet computer network to

register with police.<p>



In Germany, a parliamentary commission this week called for

international curbs on Internet-distribution of information

considered harmful to children, and authorities have tried

to

crack down on pornography and neo-Nazi propaganda by probing

whether major online providers can be held responsible.<p>



At a celebration in Philadelphia Wednesday of the 50th

Anniversary

of the first electronic computer, Vice President Al Gore

faced

protest by opponents of the new legislation.<p>

Subject: TRO in Philadelphia<p>



Judge Buckwalter's decision doesn't seem to make a lot of

sense--nor does it bode well for a vagueness challenge to

502(d).

I don't see how he drew the distinction he did between (a)

and (d)

since the Conference Report says that (d) simply codifies

the

definition of indecency from Pacifica.<p>



One hopes that the two other judges on the three judge panel

will

be able to persuade Judge Buckwalter when they decide the PI

motion.<p>



By the way, in <i>Shea v. Reno</i>, we are proceeding under

a briefing

schedule set by Judge Cote.  Our PI brief is being filed

today and

we will await the government's response.  Interestingly, our

case

is being handled by the US attorney's office for the

The turf war was ended long ago.<p>



By tradition, the Southern District does its own litigation

does not cede control of cases to the DOJ.  This has been

the case

for at least 25 years.  I don't know if it is a written

policy,

but it might as well be.<p>

<H2>Judge Greene's Lament</h2>



<H2>Telecommunications Reform: The New Playing Field</h2>



<H3>Seminar Discussion Thread</h3>



From: Eleanor Kerlow -- DC Counsel Connect - Washington<br>

Date: Wed Fri Feb 16 16:41:37 1996<br>

Subject: Judge Greene's Lament<p>



Today's Wall Street Journal reports on page one that AT&T

and MCI

are holding talks aimed at jointly developing local phone

networks in major U.S. markets. "The unusual discussions

between

the rival long-distance giants, though still in early

stages, may

result in a pact to share the cost of building networks in

some

markets, as well as agreements to swap the use of facilities

the

two already own to bypass the networks of Bells and other

carriers," the paper reported. <p>



Meanwhile, on the front of the Journal's B section,

Marketplace,

an article appears headlined "Telecom Czar Frets Over New

Industry Rules." The article explains how the new

telecommunications reform bill nullifies the consent decree

governing the breakup of AT&T. <p>



In the article Judge Harold Greene, who oversaw the consent

decree, is quoted as saying that he is worried about whether

the

new law is tough enough to stop phone giants from

essentially

re-erecting the monopoly that he spent the past 12 years

trying

to keep apart. <p>



He wonders whether "there are sufficient safeguards against

the

kinds of mergers and acquisitions that might give some small

group of companies or individuals a stranglehold" over U.S.

telecom markets. . . . I'd hate to see the AT&T monopoly be

reconstituted in some form." <p>



Indeed, isn't this what the reported AT&T/MCI alliance might

do?

On the other hand, how could it be structured so as not to

create

a "stranglehold" over U.S. telecom markets? <p>

Subject: Judge Greene's Lament<p>



        About three years ago I attended a breakfast

fundraiser.  The

guest speaker was Congressman Jack Brooks, who at the time

was

holding hearings on deregulating the Baby Bells.  Someone in

the

audience asked Brooks about the Baby Bells, and he replied: 

"They

calls them the Baby Bells.     .     .     .     Baby

monsters is

what they is.!"<p> 



        The fact is, the Baby Bells already have a

government-granted

monopoly over local phone service.   Anybody in the know

will tell

you that the technology is there now to have multiple

providers of

local service, but no one talks about it seriously, because

Congress and the federal government could never accomplish

true

competition in local service, because the telecommunications

lobby

would never let it happen.  Fact is, there is no competition

in

local service now.  The Baby Bells have a government-granted

monopoly to print money. <p>



        I found it exhilarating to read about the MCI-AT&T

announcement.

Maybe now we will get in local service what we have in other

areas

of telecommunications:  something approaching true

competition.

Maybe with the new law we will see here what is happening in

Chile

after deregulation:  telecommunications providers actually

losing

money, due to fierce competition.<p>

Subject: Local Competition<p>



Local competition, sufficient to constrain the market power

of the

RBOCs, will be a long time in coming.  What we have seen on

this

front up until now are numerous newspaper articles

describing

company plans, or anecdotes about competitive entry.  Also,

there

have been a lot of theories about competition, coming from

the

RBOCs themselves.   Actual, as opposed to potential,

competition,

will require extensive investments in local infrastructure,

which

may over time be made by MCI, AT&T, cable companies, and

others. 

 But for now it looks to me like companies will start out

small

and see whether they can make money.  The jury is out on

this. <p>

Subject: The other direction<p>



The Washington Post reported yesterday that Bell Atlantic

has

applied to become a long-distance carrier in five

states--Florida,

Illinois, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Texas. None of

these, of course, is in its local service region.<p>



The interesting thing is that Bell Atlantic plans to buy

long-distance service at discounted rates from AT&T, MCI,

and

Sprint, then resell it. AT&T, MCI, and Sprint clearly can't

refuse

to sell to Bell Atlantic in order to forestall competition.

But

each is a potential entrant into Bell Atlantic's local

service

business, as Michael Pelcovits points out. Can they exact

some

agreement from Bell Atlantic regarding the latter's making

its

facilities available to them, when and if they enter?<p>

Date: Fri Feb 16 09:27:15 1996<br>

Subject: Local Resale<p>



Jonathan Groner asked whether the long distance companies

can

exact anything from Bell Atlantic in exchange for BAs resale

of

their long distance services.  Unlikely, in my view.  The

facilities-based long distance companies -- ATT, MCI,

Sprint,

LDDS, and others in some markets -- are intensely

competitive in

providing capacity to resellers.  BA can simply follow the

well

worn path of the hundreds of existing resellers.   No

leverage

here for the long distance community.<p>

Subject: Local Competiton<p>



        The gentleman from MCI hit the nail on the head in

regard

to the huge investment and the time it may take to develop a

competing infrastructure, even in the largest markets. The

Competitive Checklist in the legislation is really an

essential

baseline of what must be in place for competition to have a

chance in the local loop.<p>



        A related concept is that potential customers,

perhaps MCI

and AT&T, as well large users will have to share the

infrastructure investment costs to get the new competitors

in the

local loop off the ground. Another strategic partner pool

consists

of the local utilities. Whether they elect to play is an

open

question. Their resources would be needed. Strategic

partnerships

are needed because the levels of investment and risk are

enormous.<p>

<H2>The Signing [Ceremony]</h2>

<H3>Seminar Discussion Thread</h3>



From: Andrew Schwartzman -- Media Access Project - Washington<br>

Date: Fri Feb  9 12:10:22 1996<br>

Subject: The Signing<p>



Jonathan Groner has asked me to provide some color commentary on

the bill signing.<p>



Apparently this was the first time a bill was signed on Capital

Hill in 20 or 30 years. <p>



The main reading room of the Library of Congress was fitted out

with dramatic TV type lighting to illuminiate the frescoes and

murals in the dome, artwork that I certainly had never noticed

until now. There were about 400 in attendance, about 1/2 of whom

were Hill staffers who worked on the bill, lobbyists and the

"regulars" in the policy debate. The remainder were real VIP's:

members of the administration, Congress and CEO's of most of the

major trade assns. and industry players. During the long wait for

Clinon and Gingrich to arrive, there was much discussion of the

absence of the TV networks' brass. Whether this was a conscious

boycott of some kind, disinterest or coincidence is unknown, at

least to me. The trade press reports that they were invited. <p>



Ted Turner arrived noisily and loudly heckled Eddie Fritts and

Jim May of the NAB. Cable had supported the V-Chip, and the

broadcasters strongly oppose it. Turner called to Fritts across

10 feet of telcom industry leadership, made a Churchillesque "V"

with one hand and said "Hey Eddit, the V Chip, you'll see that

its going to be real good. The V Chip! The V Chip!" May and

Fritts were the only ones not amusted. <p>



Clinton is in campaign mode. He stayed for around 1/2 an hour and

tried to shake every hand in the hall. He and Gore signed

programs and demonstrated their remarkable memory of names and

faces. <p>

Last Append Tue Feb 27 13:54:02 1996<p>



Many people have asked me about the status of the <I>C&P v.

FCC</i> case argued in the Supreme Court in December. This

case

is (or was) a challege to the statuory ban on cable-telco

cross-ownership within the telco's service area. (It is

accurately described in another thread as "creative

in-house"

advocacy by John Thorn of BellAtlantic.) <p>



It is surely moot. The telcom bill expressly repeals the

statute

challenged in the case. The S.G. sent the engrossed bill to

the

Supreme Court the day after it was passed, and advised the

Court

of its intention to submit a suggestion of mootness

immeidately

after the President signed the bill. <p>

Alan, do you know what the basis is for the contention that

the

case is not moot? <p>



While the 1996 Act contains an "anti-buyout" clause

preventing a

local telephone company from buying an existing cable

company in

the same locality (with certain exceptions), this provision

will

be easier to defend and the Supreme Court does not have a

record

or lower court decision on this issue. <p>

Subject: Mootness <p>



Bell Atlantic argues that the 1996 Act substitutes new

provisions

for Section 533(b) that keep in place, for at least six

months,

the prohibition on a telco's provision of video programming

to

its local subscibers over an "open video system" (which is

the

new law's term for "video dialtone"). BA says that it wants

to

provide video programming to Alexandria residents under such

an

open video system, but the new law allows this only "to the

extent permitted by such regulations as the [FCC] may

prescribe

consistent with the public interest, convenience and

necessity."

47 U.S.C. 653(a)(1). It points out the new law directs the

FCC to

promulgate regulations on this subject, but only within 6

months

of the date of enactment. 47 U.S.C. 653(b)(1). The absence

of any

such regulation in the interim, Bell Atlantic argues,

translates

into a continuation of a prohibition on BA's speech. <p>

Subject: S.G. Reply<p>



The S.G. has filed a spirited reply to the telcos'

opposition.<p>



He points out that the act authorizes telcos immediately to

offer

cable service on their own wires in their own areas.  The

provision that requires the FCC to act within 6 months is a

separate "open video system" option.<p>



The S.G. also opposes the telcos' alternative prayer that

the

lower courts' injunctions be left in place.<p>



I'm willing to go out on a limb and predict that the case

will be

declared moot and the injunctions will be vacated.<p>

Subject: SG petition in FCC case<p>



On January 26, the Solicitor General filed a petition for

<I>certiorari</i> in <I>FCC v. Miller</i>, No. 95-1200 (the

National Ass'n of Broadcasters filed a petition on the same day

in <I>NAB v. Miller</i>, No. 95-1197). The case involves the

FCC's power to preempt the jurisdiction of state and federal

courts over certain state-law claims. It also involves the "equal

time" provision of the Communications Act, as amended, which

places limits on the prices broadcasters may charge candidates in

state, local, and federal elections for air time. There is also a

justiciability issue in the case. Opinion below: 66 F.3d 1140

(11th Cir. 1995). Government cert. petitions are usually granted.

<h2>Why Pursue 507 Suit?</h2>



<H2>Telecommunications Reform: The New Playing Field</h2>



<H3>Seminar Discussion Thread</h3>



From: Cloyd Laporte, III -- Counsel Connect - New York<br>

Subject:  Why Pursue 507 suit?<p>



Last Apend: Sun Feb 25 18:27:14 1996<p>



[The following comment was submitted by a visitor to the

seminar

"echo" on  the Counsel Connect's Website. See the thread

titled

"Important Notice"for more information]<p>   



NAME =  George Sheehan<br>

TITLE = 2L<br>

COMPANY = FORDHAM LAW SCHOOL<br>

EMAIL = gsheehan@counsel.com<p>







I am a second year student at Fordham Law. We happen to be

reading David Garrow's new book "Liberty and Sexuality"

which

carefully reviews the events leading up to Griswold and Roe.

Much

time is spent on the efforts made to repeal Comstock early

in the

book. Question: Since the government has stated in the

Eastern

district of Penn. that it will not be enforcing Section 507

relating to the online transfer of abortion/birth-control

related

material and information, why is the ACLU pressing on with

its

lawsuit? Thank You.<p>

Subject: Why Pursue 507 suit?<p>



The obvious answer is "Because it's a convenient club with

which

to beat the CDA and its proponents over the head."  Let's

face it:

section 1462 hasn't been enforced as to abortion information

in

aeons, and there was no real prospect of that ever changing

in the

future, given the Supreme Court's holding in <i>Bigelow v.

Virginia</i>.<p>



Rather, the anti-507 suit is a vehicle for hoisting Rep.

Henry

Hyde (a prime CDA backer) with his own ample petard.  To

make the

CDA a complete revision of existing law, Hyde had to amend

section

1462 (which also prohibits carriage of obscene matters) to

cover

telcom technologies.  At the same time, though, as an ardent

abortion opponent Hyde wouldn't be caught dead repealing the

patently unconstitutional parts of sec. 1462 that purport to

criminalize information about obtaining abortions.<p>



The anti-507 suit also serves to recast the CDA debate. 

Instead

of being seen as righteous attackers of smut, CDA proponents

find

themselves in the politically marginalized position of

seeming to

back restrictions not only on abortion itself, but also on

mere

speech *about* abortion.<p>



In sum, there are 3 reasons: Politics, politics, and

politics (and

smart politics indeed).<p>

Subject: Why Pursue 507 suit?<p>



Thank you for the well-informed and thoughtful reply.  So in

order

to portray themselves as the "defenders of children" in the

eyes

of voters by proporting to remove indecency from the

internet (an

imppossible task, since it is a worldwide phenomena), the

writers

of the bill [including Hyde] had to risk the1462 amendment

blowing

up in their faces. This is what the ACLU (and all proponents

of

internet freedom) hope for?  How could Hyde believed that

such an

amendment would escape the scrutiny of ACLU, et. al.?<p>



Also, how powerful a weapon will the s. 507 suit be for

those who

oppose governmental intrusion in cyberspace. do you think it

will

"recast the debate" sufficiently?<p>



 Thanks<p>

Date: Fri Feb 16 17:49:48 1996<br>

Subject: Why not?<p>



What makes you think Henry Hyde cares that the statute is

unconstitutional?  The vote is what matters; it is now

possible to

say  in a campaign commercial that Rep. So and So voted to

permit

baby killers recruit murderers on the 'Net.<p>



And why do you think that Henry Hyde is unhappy to draw the

opposition of the ACLU.  That is a plus where he comes

from.<p>



Lest you think this is a one-sided episode, let me assure

you that

Hyde's opponents approach these things exactly the same

way.<p>

Subject: can a new law be useless<p>



When the Supreme Court refused to consider  challenges to

19th

century contraception laws in such cases as <i>Poe v.

Ullman</i>, the

theory (as I recall) was that the laws were in desuetude -

having

lain on the books for 100 years without enforcement, there

was no

real case or controversy when someone wanted to challenge

such

laws.  That theory doesn't seem to apply to a statute passed

last

week.  Congress thought it was doing something, and the

Court

under those circumstances might seem entitled to believe

that the

law may have a real deterrent effect (as it was intended to

do).

If the AUSA or DOJ simply announced it wouldn't be enforced

in the

district where suit is brought, there's a strong argument

that

there's still enough for a challenge - especially if the

plaintiff

is an organization that can assert the rights of its members

(who

are nationwide).<p>

Appended by: Theodore Frank -- Arent Fox - Washington<br>

Date: Sun Feb 25 18:27:14 1996<br>

Subject: ACLU Lawsuit<p>



There is more precedent for dismissing cases as "not ripe"

when

the government says it will not enforce the statute, as

apparently

DoJ is doing with the anti-abortion portion of the Act. 

During

the Carter Administration a number of public broadcasters

challenged the provision of the Communications Act

prohibiting

them from editorializing.  The district court dismissed the

suit

on the grounds that Justice said it would not enforce it.  I

don't

remember whether it used a "ripeness" or "case or

controversy"

reasoning, but the lack of enforcement was the key.  If

Justice

continues to take the tack that it will not enforce the

anti-abortion provision, that portion of the case may be

dismissed.  Justice is not taking the same position with

respect

to the indecency provisions so that case is ripe and

alive.<p>

<h2>Broadcast Impact</h2>

As a broadcast journalism student, will this bill change or

affect in any way local broad- cast television as we see it now?

Are jobs that I hope to get one day in jeopardy because we are

simplifying TV and cable and the Internet in one big swoop? Call

me curious and worried-I really don't want to change my major or

my life goals.<p>



<hr><p>



Appended by: Theodore Frank -- Arent Fox - Washington<br>

Date: Tue Feb 13 18:11:15 1996<br>

Subject: Life goals<br>



I don't think you will need to change your life goals as a result

of this legislation.  By itself, the legislation will not

significantly alter the regulation of broadcasting.  The number of

entities holding broadcast licenses will decrease and thus the

number of administrative and sales positions may decline, but

broadcasters will be around.  Further, to the extent that the Act

encourages entry into the video business by others -- and it does

-- more positions should be available among program production

entities and among those distributing product.  While the new

entrants could drive some broadcasters into bankruptcy, the

general trend when new competition is introduced is that the

entire pie expands. <p>



The proposal to auction ATV spectrum could, however, affect the

long term look of the industry.  If, as many broadcasters believe,

auctioning the spectrum will result in ATV becoming a pay-tv

service, the future of broadcasting could be affected.  That is

especially true if the current NTSC operations are required to

shut-down at the end of some "transition" period.<p>

Subject: Ted's Right, but<p>



Ted Frank's response is a good one, especially for you.<p>



But the next several years will be confusing for those entering as

well as those in the profession.  Yes, there will surely be more

different services, and more opportunity *in the long run.*  But

it is the interim transitional period - perhaps lasting a decade -

of which I speak. <p>



What are the benefits of telecommunications deregulation to the

40,000 people who are being invited to leave AT&T-  right now?  My

bank  used to have five teller lines and now there are never more

than two, but my average wait is a lot less and I get a lot more

information during and after my transaction.   These are wonderful

and profitable efficiencies, but if your job is part of the

"efficiency" it may not seem like such a great thing. <p>



There is no question that the impact of broadcast "deregulation"

in 1984 has been a great reduction in the number of jobs for

broadcast journalists.   New cable and online alternatives have so

far created only a few, low paying, non-union jobs.<p>



I'm not saying all this is good or bad for the economy or the

country, but I wouldn't count on an expanding job market in the

short term.<p>

<h2>Politics and the Bill </h2>

Subject:  Politics and the bill<p>







Last Append: Wed Feb 14 05:32:44 1996<p>



I am surprised that there has been so little discussion of the

political alliances. I'm not referring to the civil libertarian v.

child protection issues involved with Internet indecency. Rather,

it seems that the general deregulatory concepts behind this bill,

i.e. ending the oversight by Judge Greene, unleashing the RBOCs,

removing some cross-ownership restrictions, etc. were pretty much

supported both by Al Gore types and by Newt Gingrich types. Did

each party find something it liked, and why? The exception that I

recall was that Bob Dole insisted on shaping part of the bill (was

it the spectrum auction?) to his liking. What was Dole up to? Are

Gingrich and Gore able to unite on a common vision of the

free-for-all in cyberspace, and if

so, from what quarters could opposition be expected to come?<p>

Subject: It's *Not* Party Politics<p>



Telecommunications policy is hardly apolitical.  However, it is

almost uniquely bipartisan.  There are many reasons for this; it

would take many pages to explain them all.<p>



Moreover, the mergers and strategic alliances made possible by the

'96 Act will transform the world as we have known it.  I suspect

the bipartisan nature of the involved industries will continue,

but I wouldn't put money on it.<p>



The major difference (with some notable exceptions) between the

parties is the degree of governmental involvement they prefer in

the implementation of policy.  However, as to the question of what

the policy should be, there is pretty strong consensus.<p>



Without explaining any of the above, let me point to some of the

major players and their partisans.  (N.B., None of these alliances

apply when the matter involves indecency , obscentiy and/or

nudity.  They may not apply with respect to violence, unless it

relates to guns.):<p>



Baby Bells: John Dingell, John Breaux, Bob Dole, Newt Gingrich,

the late Bob Packwood, Billy Tauzin (a telcom transvestite lately

out of the closet)<p>



Long Distance Companies:  John Conyers, Henry Hyde, Tom Bliley,

Tom Daschle, Bob Kerry, Fritz Hollings, Ed Markey<p>



Cable: Every member from Colorado of both parties, John McCain,

John Kerry<p>



Anti-Cable: Ron Wyden, Ed Markey, the aforementioned Billy Tauzin<p>



Broadcasters: the aforementioned Billy Tauzin, the late Bob

Packwood, Newt Gingrich, Tom Bliley (except on porn), Ralph Hall,

Trent Lott<p>



Anti-Broadcasters (public): Dingell, Markey, Hollings, many

Democrats<p>



Anti-Broadcasters (private): many Republicans.<p>

Subject: Party Politics<p>



This issue is largely bipartisain.  Even the spectrum auctions for

broadcasters issue was first raised by the Administration, not by

Bob Dole.  The difference is that the Administration took an early

cue from congressional Democrats to put this idea on the back

burner.<p>



Perhaps the most partisain issue was cable rate deregulation.  The

Democrats, led by Senator Al Gore, passed cable rate regulation in

1992 over Bush's veto (the only veto overridden).  In the 1996

Act, the Republicans and Democrats compromised by sunsetting

"upper tier" (CNN, MTV) rate  regulation in 1999.<p>

<h2>310((b) Implications</h2>

I have to believe that the elimination of the officers and

directors provision of 310b has to have some implications

for the

FCC's 1985 <i>Wilner & Schiener</i> ruling.  There,

insulation of limited

partners and prohibitions on general partners were tied to

their

ability to "act as officers and directors.  Since alien

officers

and directors are now permissable, does anyone think that

the

prhibition on limited partners or general partners (below

the

20/25% ownership limits) would be allowed?<p>

<h2>Vanity Number Implications</h2>



<H2>Telecommunications Reform: The New Playing Field</h2>



<H3>Seminar Discussion Thread</h3>



Last Apend: Mon Feb 19 17:11 1996<p>



From: Douglas Jarrett -- Keller & Heckman - Washington<br>

Date:  Mon Feb 19 17:11<br>

Subject:  Vanity Number Auctions<p>



Last Apend: Mon Feb 19 17:11 1996<p>



        The House members leading the budget negotiations

have

cast their eyes on HDTV spectrum auctions and the auction of

toll

free vanity numbers when used in connection with the new

toll

free access code "888," which is due to go in effect on

March

1. The use of vanity numbers with other toll free codes that

will

be implemented after "888" is exhausted would also be

subject to

auctions.  The elusive nature of the definition of what

constitutes a vanity number suggests the Congress will have

to be

creative on this point.<p>



          For some firms, whose businesses are centered

around a

valuable toll free telephone number, auctions could be very

costly. Competitors with no intentions or half-hearted

intentions

could bid-up the cost of the use of certain  vanity numbers

with

the new toll free codes. As a practical matter, a successful

bid

for a vanity number poses risks to a competitor/ new

entrant;

customers would likely dial the 800 access code, at least

initially, until use of the new 888 code becomes widely

appreciated in the market.<p>

         

        In an Order issued in late January, the FCC ducked

the

issue of what to do with vanity numbers, directing the

administrator of the 800 database to set aside and at least

initially not assign the numbers that parties had asked to

reserve.<p>



         It now appears that Congress may resolve the matter

for

the Commission, consistent with Chairman Hundt's preference

for

auctions, by including  vanity number auctions in the next

Continuing Resolution to keep the government funded through

the

end of the fiscal year or in the Debt Ceiling legislation

which is

expected to be voted on by March l.<p>

and especially those of us who are not FCC bar  participants

of

long standing, check out the Home Page of Blumenfeld & Cohen

which

can be found at <a href=

It has a linked copy of the act; summary of the act; and in

another spot a

helpful to

me.<p>

<h2>Judicial Revue of the Helms Act</h2>



<H2>Telecommunications Reform: The New Playing Field</h2>



<H3>Seminar Discussion Thread</h3>



From: Tony Robinson -- CA Counsel Connect - San

Francisco<br>

Date:  Thu Feb 22 20:34<br>

Subject:  Decency Act Args Presaged<p>



Last Apend: Sun Feb 25 18:27:14 1996<p>



The New York Times reported Thursday on Supreme Court

arguments

that may foretell what is to come when the recently enacted

Communications Decency Act comes up for review.<p>



Several justices were apparently skeptical Wednesday of the

1992

Helms Act, which gives cable operators discretion over

whether to

transmit indecent programming, but says that if they do,

they must

scramble the transmissions.<p>



During arguments in <i>Denver Area Consortium v. Federal

Communications Commission</i>, No. 95-124, Linda Greenhouse

saw little

support from the justices for the government argument that

because

cable operators could choose whether to carry the

programming,

there wasn't sufficient state intervention to trigger

constitutional review.<p>



The case is expected to change the betting line on how the

Decency

Act will fare . . . assuming that doesn't get decided

first.<p>

<h2>FCC Rule-Making Schedule and Announcement Meeting</h2>



<H2>Telecommunications Reform: The New Playing Field</h2>



<H3>Seminar Discussion Thread</h3>



From: Susan Nogan -- CC Law Editor - Washington<br>

Date:  Fri Feb 23 14:04<br>

Subject:  Implementation<p>



Last Apend: Sun Feb 25 18:27:14 1996<p>



The bureaus are holding open meetings to announce their

rule-making schedule and procedures.  Today the Common

Carrier

Bureau held such an open meeting, at which Commissioner Reed

Hundt

and Deputy Commissioner Regina Keeney declared the

Commission's

intention to beat the deadlines set for it by Congress.<p>



The procedure for making rules to implement the

Telecommunications

Act of 1996 will not be business as usual, said Keeney.  The

process must be improved if FCC is to meet its deadlines,

but

Keeney regards the process as a cooperative one.  She

stressed the

FCC's need for assistance from the industry in terms of hard

data

and good facts.  As general counsel Bill Kennard pointed

out,

there is no time for the highly stylized negotiation process

that

normally characterizes an open comment period.  Accordingly,

FCC

will be imposing page limits and setting short deadlines for

submissions.  Joint submissions by parties with shared views

are

encouraged.  Blair Levin suggested that joint submissions

from

parties that normally represent adverse interests will merit

particular attention.  Kennard also pointed out that parties

will

be required to follow rules regarding ex parte submissions. 

They

should be submitted within three weeks of the conclusion of

the

open comment period, and must include detailed summaries.<p>



In order to minimize the delay that litigation challenging

the Act

may have on the rule-making process, Kennard has adopted the

"bowling ball theory of statutory interpretation."  He will

not

advise FCC to "put a spin" on the Act, but to be faithful to

Congress's intent by sticking to the plain meaning of the

Act and

to the legislative history.<p> 



Hundt said he will be soliciting ideas from state utilities

commissions so that the wheel need not be re-invented.<p>



A copy of the Bureau's schedule of statutorily required

proceedings is available upon request, but it is subject to

amendment in response to a request that it include the name

of the

individuals at FCC who are assigned to each section.<p>



The Cable Services Bureau will hold a similar open meeting

on

Tuesday, 2/27.<p>

<H2>V-Chips and <i>Pacifica</i>/h2>



<H2>Telecommunications Reform: The New Playing Field</h2>



<H3>Seminar Discussion Thread</h3>



From: Mark Eckenwiler -- Gordon & Glickson - Chicago<br>

Date:  Thu Feb 15 23:18<br>

Subject:  V Chips and Pacifica<p>



Last Apend: Tue Feb 27 15:11:39 1996<p> 



Query: Once the V-chip-enabled generation of televisions has

gained a significant share of U.S. households, is the

justification for FCC regulation of indecent programming

diminished?  Can an electronically sanitized television's

fare

still be said to be as uniquely intrusive (and likely to

give

unanticipated offense to the unwary) as that of the idiot

box

Justice Stevens wrote about in <i>Pacifica</i>?<p>



Obviously, the answer depends a great deal on the private

ratings

systems that evolve (or don't evolve) over time.  But let's

assume

they do, and do so in a manner not inconsistent with the

FCC's

standards over the past two decades.  What then?<p>



<hr><p>

 

Appended by: John Mitchell -- Arent Fox - Washington<br>

Date: Tue Feb 27 15:11:39 1996<br>

Subject: Time and abridgement<p>



Since it will take time for TV's equipped with v-chips to

replace

existing sets, it will take a lot of time -- and hopefully

time

enough to amend the law -- before v-chips are sufficiently

widespread as to coax judges to avert their watchful eye

over us.<p>



In the meantime, where is the challenge to v-chips as

v-chips?

As far as I am concerned, Congress has just abridged my

freedom of

access to the television airwaves (or cable signals) by

making it

more expensive for me to purchase a TV set.  Even if I want

a

v-chip, there would be no point in going out and seeking the

best

deal on the open market, for Congress has dictated that, if

I ever

want new TV access again, I can't have it unless I ALSO buy

the

v-chip.  This is bad enough for us folk with children.  It

is even

worse for adults who are not likely to ever use the v-chip. 

All

Congress has done is burden free speech while creating a

windfall

for chip manufacturers.<p>

<h2>The Next Telecom Reform Bill</h2>



<H2>Telecommunications Reform: The New Playing Field</h2>

Date:  Tue Feb 20 06:58<br>

Subject:  Next Telecom Reform Bill<p>



Last Append: Thu Feb 29 18:49:36 1996<p>



While the bill is comprehensive, it does leave out several

important issues.  Among the issues ducked in the bill that

are

likely to be grist for future legislative debates are (1)

spectrum

auctions for broadcasters; and (2) foreign ownership.<p>



In addition, I doubt we have seen our last attempt at

Internet

content regulation.  Indeed, we may see issues related to

Internet

economic regulation as the Internet carriers more electronic

commerce, and is used to distribute voice and video

services.<p>



What other issues should be covered in the next

telecommunications

reform bill?<p>

Subject: FCC Says<p>



The FCC is holding an en banc hearing on spectrum policy to

"encourage debate between panelists representing different

perspectives in the given area of spectrum policy.  Panel

topics

are as follows:<p>



One: Future Spectrum Demand<br>

Priorities, methodology, trends, demand and

international<br>

long-range planning.<p>



Two: Technology Trends<br>

Identifying developing technologies, how new technologies

will

affect supply and demand, and how best to promote and

encourage

investment and efficiency.<p>



Three: Spectrum Allocation<p>



Four: Spectrum Assignment<br>

The appropriateness of auctions, rules, public interest

obligations, barriers to entry into this market, efficiency

and

innovation, and the influence of foreign use of frequencies

outside the US.<p>



I'll be covering the hearing for Counsel Connect, and we're

also

in negotiations with FCC to continue the hearing online

here.

I'll keep you posted.<p>

Subject: Next Telecom Bill<p>



        We may well see spectrum auctions in one of two

budget

bills: the debt ceiling extension bill or the next

continuing

resolution to fund the government through the balance of the

fiscal year. The Congressional budgeteers and the White

House are

looking very closely at auctions to close the budget gap.

Vanity

numbers used with toll free access codes other than the 800

code

is in play as well. Obviously, the broadcast industry is

concerned

as evidenced by the full page add in the Outlook section of

the past Sunday's Washington Post.<p>

Subject: Technical Amendments<p>



I think the next telecom bill we will see, other than

perhaps one

restructuring public broadcasting, will be one making

technical

amendments to the current bill.  The rewrite of Section

307(c)

left out license terms for non-broadcast stations and I've

got to

believe there are lots of other oversights and miscues. 

Then

again, if the Exxon amendment goes down the tubes, its

likely

Congress will try again, just as it did in broadcast

indecency.<p>

<h2>Radio Mergers)</h2>



<H2>Telecommunications Reform: The New Playing Field</h2>



<H3>Seminar Discussion Thread</h3>



From: Susan Nogan -- CC Law Editor - Washington<br>

Date:  Mon Feb 26 11:28<br>

Subject:  Radio Mergers<p>



Last Append: Tue Feb 27 00:25:56 1996<p>



According to the Broadcast listserve, the Telecommunications

Act

has spawned a rush on radio mergers. 

For example, in Fargo, ND, one entity owns 4 stations, and

sales

of a fifth, another entity owns 5, and the only remaining

commercial station is owned by a third entity, which

also owns the local television station.  In Rochester, NY,

an

entity that already owns 1 AM and 2 FM stations and has an

agreement to sell on a fourth station has contracted to

purchase

all local radio properties owned by another entity (2 AM and

2 FM

stations).<p>



How does this new freedom to purchase jive with FCC's stated

goal

of perfect competition?<p>



<hr><p>



Appended by: Andrew Schwartzman -- Media Access Project -

Washington<br>

Date: Tue Feb 27 00:25:56 1996<br>

Subject: Huh?<p>



The FCC has no such stated goal.  Even if it ever had that

goal,

it has been agency policy for years that radio needs to

consolidate to survive.  Radio ownership limits, which were

7 AM

and 7 FM, with strong "duopoly" and "one to a market" limits

on

regional concentration have been relaxed continuously since

1984.

And such rules as have been in place have been routinely

waived,

almost for the asking.<p>



The new policy under the '96 Act is that there should be no

meaningful limits on ownership.  Competition is to exist by

letting big group owners compete against other big group

owners.



I can't believe your listserv suggested otherwise.<p>

<h2>The Second Indecency Suit</h2>



<H2>Telecommunications Reform: The New Playing Field</h2>



<H3>Seminar Discussion Thread</h3>



From: Christina Cooley -- Counsel Connect - Atlanta<br>

Date:  Mon Feb 26 15:26<br>

Subject:  Second Indecency Suit<p>



Last Append: Mon Feb 26 15:26<p>



 A coalition of online service providers, non-profit

organizations, and professional associations  filed suit

today in

the Philadelphia district court to block enforcement of the

indecent material provisions of the Telecommunications Act

of

1996. The suit will be combined with an earlier suit by the

ACLU

and other plaintiffs.  The complaint's online in the library

in

Hot Docs, and permanently under Briefs, Pleadings by

Practice

Area/Communications.<p>



Here's the list of plaintiffs, followed by the complaint's

preliminary statement :<p>

<ul>



<li>AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION, INC.,<p>



<li>AMERICA ONLINE, INC.<p>



<li>AMERICAN BOOKSELLERS ASSOCIATION,  INC.<p>



<li>AMERICAN BOOKSELLERS FOUNDATION FOR FREE EXPRESSION<p>

<li>OPNET, INC.<p>



<li>PRODIGY SERVICES COMPANY<p>



<li>SOCIETY OF PROFESSIONAL JOURNALISTS<p>



<li>WIRED VENTURES, LTD.<p>



</ul>



PRELIMINARY STATEMENT<p>



<ol>



<li>"During much of this century the mass media,

particularly radio

and television, have been characterized by a limited number

of

speakers transmitting programming and information to

essentially

passive audiences. The communications medium of the

twenty-first

century -- the Internet and "cyberspace" generally -- is

changing

that, and will allow hundreds of millions of individuals to

engage

in interactive communication, on a national and global scale

never

before possible. The public square of the past -- with

pamphleteering, soap boxes, and vigorous debate -- is being

replaced by the Internet, which enables average citizens to

participate in national discourse, publish a newspaper,

distribute

an electronic pamphlet to the world, and generally

communicate to

and with a broader audience than ever before possible. It

also

enables average citizens to gain access to a vast and

literally

world- wide range of information, while simultaneously

protecting

their privacy, because in this new medium individuals

receive only

the communications they affirmatively request.<p>



<li>In enacting the Communications Decency Act of 1996 (to

be

codified at 47 U.S.C. Section 223) (the "Act"), Congress

acknowledged that the Internet represents "an extraordinary

advance in the availability of educational and informational

resources to our citizens," and acknowledged that

interactive

computer services "offer users a great degree of control

over the

information that they receive." Congress therefore declared

"[i]t

is the policy of the United States . . . to promote the

continued

development of the Internet and other interactive computer

services; [and] to preserve the vibrant and competitive free

market that presently exists for the Internet and other

interactive computer services, unfettered by Federal or

State

regulation." Act Section 509 (to be codified at 47 U.S.C.

Section

230). Unfortunately, as we will show, provisions of the Act

that

were intended only to protect minors from communications

deemed

inappropriate for them will have the effect, perhaps

unintended,

of depriving adults of communications that are appropriate,

and

indisputably constitutionally protected, for them. Because

of the

way the Internet works, the Act's prohibition of

communications

that may be deemed "indecent" or "patently offensive" for

minors

will effectively ban those same communications between

adults,

reducing the adult population in cyberspace to only what is

appropriate for minors. The banned speech includes valuable

works

of literature and art, information about health and medical

issues, and examples of popular culture. It also includes

robust

human discourse about politics, current events, and personal

matters that may at times include harsh, provocative, or

even

vulgar language, all of which is constitutionally protected

for

adults.<p>



<li>Plaintiffs represent a broad range of individuals and

entities

from the computer and communications industries and the

general

public who are harmed by the Act. Plaintiffs include

publishers

and creators of content on the Internet; "online services,"

"Internet service providers," libraries, and others who

provide

access or connection to the Internet; and speakers,

listeners, and

users on the Internet. The Act's effective ban of a broad

category

of communication that is constitutionally protected for

adults

directly harms the First Amendment rights of plaintiffs, and

of

the tens of millions of adult speakers and listeners who are

"online" and linked through this new communications medium.

Plaintiffs also include parents, who seek to protect the

rights of

parents to decide what is appropriate for their children to

receive through interactive computer communications.<p>



<li>The speech at issue in this case does not include

obscenity,

child pornography, harassing speech, speech intended to

entice or

lure minors into inappropriate activity, or other speech

that

lacks First Amendment protection even for adults. This

complaint

does not challenge governmental regulation of those

categories of

non-protected speech, and the relief sought herein will not

affect

the government's ability to prosecute the communication of

those

categories of speech, all of which are already prohibited by

existing law.<p>



<li>The most sweeping provision of the Act, Section 502(2)

(to be

codified at 47 U.S.C. Section 223(d)), prohibits the

"display" of

material deemed "patently offensive" "in a manner available

to a

person under 18 years of age" (emphasis added). That

provision is

subject to certain defenses, which the sponsor of the Act

and

Congress apparently believed would enable speakers to

restrict

access by minors while simultaneously permitting access by

adults.

But those defenses, which were merely lifted from the

"dial-a-porn" laws, simply do not work in the quite

different

medium of cyberspace. Because of the manner in which

information

is stored, transmitted, and received on the Internet, this

provision has the (perhaps unintended) result of banning

speech

between adults that is suitable and constitutionally

protected for

adults.<p>



<li>The Act is also unconstitutional because there are

alternative

ways of protecting minors from material inappropriate for

them

that would not abridge the First Amendment rights of adults,

and

would be more effective in protecting minors than the

mechanism

Congress imposed. The speaker-based blocking required by the

Act

will not protect minors from access to words and images

posted on

the Internet abroad by foreign speakers, who are not

effectively

subject to prosecution under the Act, or even by domestic

speakers

who intentionally or inadvertently violate the Act. But

user-based

blocking technology enables parents and other users to block

or

screen whatever words or images they deem inappropriate,

regardless of where posted, at little or no cost. For these

reasons, every application of the Act unnecessarily and

unconstitutionally abridges the First Amendment rights of

adults,

and does so even though there are less drastic alternatives

that

would be more protective of minors."<p>

<h2>Freedom Through Encryption<h2>



<H2>Telecommunications Reform: The New Playing Field</h2>



<H3>Seminar Discussion Thread</h3>



From: Christina Cooley -- Counsel Connect - Atlanta<br>

Date:  Tue Feb 27 15:19<br>

Subject:  Freedom through Encryption<p>



Last Append: Thu Feb 29 17:48:28 1996<p>



Bills that would revise federal regulation of encryption

software

are due to be introduced in the House and Senate today, and

full

text is online in the library in Hot Docs.<p>



Here's the letter Rep. Bob Goodlatte, who authored the bill

(R-NY), sent to fellow representatives seeking

co-sponsors:<p>



<hr>



THIS COULDN'T HAPPEN IN THE U.S., RIGHT?<p>



BE AN ORIGINAL COSPONSOR OF S.A.F.E.:  THE FREEDOM THROUGH

ENCRYPTION ACT<p>



Dear Colleague:<p>



 When Congress returns on Tuesday February 27, 1996, I

plan to introduce the Security And Freedom through

Encryption Act (SAFE) and invite you to join me as an

original cosponsor.  A press conference for all original

cosponsors will be held on that Tuesday.<p>



What will this bill do?<p>

<UL>

<LI> Continue to Ensure that All Americans have the Right to

Choose Any Security System to Protect Their Confidential

Information as they do Under Current Law.<p>



<LI> Prohibit Big Brother from Mandating a Back Door into

People's Computer Systems.<p>



<LI> Make it Unlawful to Use Encryption in the Commission of

a Crime.<p>



<LI> Allow the US Computer Industry to Export Generally

Available Software and Hardware if a Product with

Comparable Security is Commercially Available from Foreign

Suppliers.<p>

</UL>

Why is this bill needed?<p>

<UL>

<LI> Assault on Americans' privacy and security:  Current

Administration proposals attempt to impose a key escrow

system on all computer users through the export laws.  The

Administration has proposed to allow the export of products

with strong security features but only if a back door (or

key escrow) is built in.  This is an attempt to use export

controls to force Americans into such a system as well.  if

this does not work.  Administration officials have said

they will seek legislation forcing Americans to use only

encryption to which the government has access!<p>



<LI> The Internet and Global Information Infrastructure

(GII)

will not flourish without strong security:  Businesses,

both large and small, are looking to the GII as the next

frontier.  Without security features, the innovative

content, electronic commerce, and enhanced communications

capabilities necessary to make the development of the GII

a reality, simply will not occur.<p>



<LI> The Technology Genie is out of the bag:  Studies show

the

availability of over 500 foreign products and programs with

strong encryption capabilities.  Strong security programs,

stronger than US companies can export, also can be down

loaded from the Internet.<p>



<LI> Export Laws Tie the Hands of US industry:  Current

export

law places the US computer industry at a competitive

disadvantage by limiting the strength of the security

features in products which can be exported.  An economic

study released in December of 1995 demonstrates that

failure to address these export controls by the year 2000

(four short years from now) will cost the US economy $60

billion and 200,000 jobs.<p>

</UL>

     For all these reasons I urge you to join me on

Tuesday, February 27 to introduce The Security and Freedom

through Encryption Act (SAFE)!  To cosponsor call Elizabeth

Frazee at x55431.<p>







                                        Sincerely,<p>

<p>

                                       Bob Goodlatte<p>



SUMMARY OF GOODLATTE BILL<p>



"Security and Freedom Through Encryption Act"  (SAFE)<p>



<ol>



<li>Freedom to use any encryption by Americans anywhere.<p>



<li>Prohibition on mandatory key escrow (no person may be

required by federal or state government to give key to

another).<p>



<li>Freedom to sell any encryption domestically.<p>



<li>Unlawful to use encryption in commission of a crime.<p>



<li>Freedom to export generally available software, other

software under license, and hardware under license if a

product with comparable security is commercially available

from foreign supplier.<p>

<h2>The Future Living Rooms of America</h2>



<H2>Telecommunications Reform: The New Playing Field</h2>



<H3>Seminar Discussion Thread</h3>



From: Eleanor Kerlow -- DC Counsel Connect - Washington<br>

Date:  Tue Feb 27 17:10<br>

Subject:  The Future<p>



Last Append: Thu Feb 29 18:37:47 1996<p>



Let's step back from the legal-regulatory framework for a

minute.

Suppose you were talking to your spouse, your parents, or

one of

your children and they asked you what it was that that this

telecommunications reform bill would do in terms of how they

will

be able to send or receive shows on television and cable,

make

phone calls and use their computers, even down to the shape

and

form of the computers themselves.<p>



 In simple, specific examples, how is this bill going to

change

the future living rooms of America and what will that living

room

look like?<p>



<hr><p>

Subject: The Future<p>



The other day while on business I stayed in a hotel where I

could

not only watch tv, but get a copy of my bill and interact

with the

front desk, and complete a guest survey all by a few buttons

on my

television screen. Jumping from the hotel services computer

screen

and my regular television program dial was seamless.<p>



With the mergers now being opened by the new bill, and phone

companies merging with cable companies, as referenced in

Ken's

comment and others in this seminar, will my remote control

have a

button that says phone. And once I press that the number I'm

dialing will appear on the television screen as I am

watching

another program? Will I be able to switch from

<i>Seinfeld</i> to my home

shopping computer menu and back?  What other nifty consumer

innovations can I expect to see? To what extent will those

innovations be attributable to the new regulatory framework

created by the Telecom Reform bill?<p>

All of that is possible -- although I'm not aware that

anyone is

manufacturing a device that will permit you to disassemble

the

various data streams coming into your home so that voice

messages

go to your telephone, video programming goes to the tv,

games go

to the tv or computer depending on the nature of the game,

etc.

But it will all come in as a jumble of ones and zeros.  What

services those zeros and ones will provide will ultimately

depend

on the marketplace and the creativity of entrepeneurs and

marketers.<p>



Currently, most people have a separate line for their

computer or

they can use the computer or the telephone but not both at

the

same time.  The technology is available to allow both to

operate

off the same wire, but it is not widely deployed.  If we

have a

single supplier using a single wire (be it copper, coax, or

fiber), we will need some decoder to sort it out and send it

by

wire or radio to the various different display modules.  It

is

possible that you computer will also be your tv or

visa-versa, but

I doubt it.  You don't need a 40 inch screen for your

computer and

don't want a 15 inch screen for your tv.  (The spectrum set

aside

for wireless PCS might be suitable for "wiring" your home

for next

millenium -- which is about when we will see this diversity

of

services -- but that is still in the future.)  What you used

the

tv for in the hotel was fine for the limited services there,

but I

question whether you would want to do your taxes or pay your

bills

or have the tv service as the computer screen for anything

more

elaborate than approving your bill and perhaps ordering room

service.<p>

Ted,<p>



 You made two points suggesting that consumers might want to

keep

computer uses separate from tv uses.<p>



<It is possible that your computer will also be your tv or

visa-versa, but I doubt it.  You don't need a 40 inch screen

for

your computer and don't want a 15 inch screen for your

tv>.<p>



<I question whether you would want to do your taxes or pay

bills or have the tv service as the computer screen for

anything

more elaborate than approving your bill and perhaps ordering

room

service.><p>



Right now when I want to work on computer things I have to

walk to

my computer in my home office. When I want to watch tv, I

have

walk back to the room with the larger tv. There is a

television in

the room with the computer. And sometimes I have the news on

while

I am working at the computer. I physically have to stop

typing to

turn around to see the television when I want to watch

something.

Otherwise, the television is on merely for background noise.

It

would be great if a little picture of the tv appeared in a

box on

my computer screen, as in picture in picture.<p>



 Actually, I think it would be quite nice to be able to sit

in the

den and switch from television to surfing the Internet

automatically comfortably from my couch and via a large

screen.

You and your family could sit on the couch and scroll

through

pages of the LL Bean catalogue and choose new clothes,

complete

the mail order form, and return to the Discovery Channel

without

having to get off the couch.<p>



Isn't the availability of computer games such as Sega

Genesis and

Nintendo from Blockbuster Video which kids play on 33 inch

television screens the first step in this direction? 

Indeed, I

would argue that the trend will be in this direction. Just

look at

the Internet sites such as ESPN, CNN, and our own Court TV

Law

Center, which have a distinct video look.<p>

Eleanor -- you're right, there are lots of things you can do

on

the tv screen other than watch what others have offered up. 

And,

I suspect that there is no reason you couldn't surf the net

while

you are watching a video of <i>Citizen Kane</i> or whatever.

But much of that stuff is relatively passive on your part.

 Your interaction with whats on the screen is limited --

I'll buy that jewelry or whatever.  Games too benefit from

the

"big" screen.  But, I think I'd have some problem trying to

write

something on a tv screen that is ten or fifteen feet away

even if

I held the keyboard on my lap or on the table in front of

me.  I

want a big screen and some distance if I'm watching

television or

a movie, but I like the intimacy, for lack of a better word,

of a

smaller, closer screen for something where I have to think

and

interact extensively.  Maybe I'm just hide bound to an

earlier

time and my kids will be comfortable doing everything on the

tv

screen, but I doubt it. <p>

<h2>More or Less Competition)</h2>



<H2>Telecommunications Reform: The New Playing Field</h2>



<H3>Seminar Discussion Thread</h3>



From: Kenneth M. Kaufman -- Roberts & Eckard -

Washington<br>

Date:  Wed Feb 28 01:44<br>

Subject:  More or Less Competition?<p>



Last Append: Fri Mar  1 12:35:21 1996<p>



Today's news carried the story that US West is planning to

buy

Continental Cablevision, the third largest cable system

operator, in a deal valued at over $10 billion.  One of the

key

arguments advanced by the proponents of the new telecom

legislation was that it would enhance competition in local

markets by allowing telephone companies and cable operators

to

compete on each other's turf, thereby increasing the number

of

competitors providing video and other services to the home.

There is some feeling, however, that the US West/Continental

deal

is the vanguard of a trend toward greater consolidation in

the

industry (since the new law allows combinations which were

formerly prohibited), which will ultimately result in less

competition rather than more.  What do the participants in

this

seminar feel about this?  Will the new telecom act

ultimately be

pro-competitive or anti-competitive?<p>



<hr><p>



 Appended by: Theodore Frank -- Arent Fox - Washington<br>

Date: Thu Feb 29 18:45:14 1996<br>

Subject: Pro or Anti Competitive?<p>



I think that the bill is going to result in a massive

consolidation among players in the business on both the

hardware

and software side.  If recent history is any guide, the

major players obviously want to be able to offer customers

everything from telephone service to the programming

itself.  Whether the long term result will be pro or anti

competitive will be a function of how well that game plan

works.

How well a company can manage being both the conduit and the

message provider.  Short term, I think you will see lots of

mergers and acquisitions.  Longer term, however, you could

see

some unbundling of those mergers as the parties recognize

that

customers want more variety and their are economies in being

smaller and quicker.<p>

Subject: Consolidation<p>



        It is difficult to dispute the consolidation theory.

At

least in one area, the Act should spur competition: local

exchange

and access. The Act, in effect, establishes two avenues for

competition in these extremely cash rich services: resale

and

facilities-based competition. The cost of the latter is

steep, if

not prohibitive on a massive scale. On the other hand, the

provisions of the Act calling for the unbundling of local

loop

network components, at cost-based rates and subject to the

prohibition on resale restrictions appear to be the

principal

avenue the interexchange carriers will follow. This is

almost

essential from their perspective. The logic is that the

RBOCs will

be full-fledged competitors in 2 to 3 years in the long

distance

market.  If the RBOCs access rates are too high, as IXCs

have

contended for years, even the Act's mandatory imputation

provisions which require the local carriers' affiliates to

pay the

same for access as all other carriers ensures the local

carriers

will still have a positive revenue stream and compete

aggressively

for the long haul business by charging rates barely above

access,

notwithstanding the separate subsidiaries     Because access

is a

cost to the other IXCs, AT&T and MCI et al. have a problem.

Cost-based resale is the competitive path.<p>



        Thus, there is the real possibility that large users

of

local and long distance services, even regional consumers

like

local governments, could see increasingly better rates in

the

not too distant future.<p>



                                Regards,<br>

Ted's point on mergers and divestitures between conduits and

content providers is well-taken.  Even before the passage of

the

Telecommunications Act, the divergent strategies of some

major

players in the industry were epitomized by Disney and

Viacom,

respectively -- Disney with its acquisition of Cap

Cities/ABC, and

Viacom with its acquisition of Paramount and its subsequent

sale

of cable systems to TCI.  Disney has clearly bet (to the

tune of

$19 billion) on the synergies between content and delivery

systems, while Viacom has focused on content.<p>

in view of the strong natl commitment to interstate

Although I believe that the majority of what has happened

with the new telecommunications bill is great,

creating competition not only lowers the cost to us but also

creates new ideas which become new

technology. But what I don't like is once again big brother

stepping up and telling us what is proper

expression on the net or television. I agree kids should not

be watching material, that is  slated for adults.

But it should be these very adults that should be instilling

moral values in thier own kids not leaving it up to

the government to teach our future generations, after all

look at some of the government programs and you

have my case in point. So in conclusion although government

is Deregulating in this bill there still is alot

more Regulation. KEEP THE NET FREE<p>

<h2>FCC Wireless Siting Policy</h2>

From my perspective, the National Wireless Telecommunicaions

Siting Policy is one

of the most interesting parts of this legislation. This is

not a hot topic in any

part of the Country except in the Washington/Baltimore area

because most of the

new wireless companies have not significantly begun build

out. Over the next

twelve months terms like monopoly, vertical real estate,

propagation studies,

etc. will become common. Once that begins, almost every

local board and

jurisdiction will be required to review and probably revise

its existing zoning

ordinance to comply with the new law. Although compliance

will not be difficult,

the review process will cause many unexpected changes.<p> 



For example, most zoning decisions regarding the siting of

wireless

communications facilities are not written by the local

boards. This has made the

challenge of certain decisions difficult and has allowed the

local jurisdictions

to act without regard to existing laws. Now, every

jurisdiction will be required

to create a record which can be scrutinized in Federal

Court.<p>

<html><TITLE>Spotlight -  Report on Senator Packwood</TITLE><body><center><P><a name=evid.htm><hr size=7></a>Released through<H3>LEXIS COUNSEL CONNECT</H3> LEXIS COUNSEL CONNECT is a communications and information service for attorneys. LCC is managed by American Lawyer Media, L.P.<P><hr size=7><p></center> <p> <H2>IV.  EVIDENCE REGARDING THE ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT</H2><p> <p>     The following is a discussion of the evidence regarding the eighteen incidents outlined in the Committee's Resolution of May 16, 1995.  Senate Ethics Counsel finds that these incidents, taken collectively, reflect an abuse of his United States Senate Office by Senator Packwood, and that this conduct is of such a nature as to bring discredit upon the United States Senate.<p> <p> <H3>A.   Packwood Staff Member [fn 68]</H3><p> <p>      <H4>1.   Testimony by Staff Member</H4><p> <p>     This staff member was hired in March 1990 by Senator Packwood as the press secretary for the Senate Finance Committee minority staff.  In August 1991, she was hired as Senator Packwood's personal press secretary; she left that job on July 26, 1992 to take a job in Oregon.<p> <p>     Around July of 1990, the Senator learned that the staffer loved old music, movies, and books, which were also interests of Senator Packwood.  Senator Packwood and the staffer frequently exchanged music tapes, and Senator Packwood occasionally invited her to his office to listen to music with other staff members, or to look at his antique book collection.  They also had long discussions about politics and history.  According to the staffer, it was typical for Senator Packwood to have wine available when she and others were in his office.  Senator Packwood and the staffer exchanged notes, usually accompanying the tapes.  Senator Packwood often let the staffer know that he thought she was talented and creative, and he singled her out in staff meetings for compliments.<p> <p>    In the early fall of 1990, perhaps in September, about 5:00 p.m., Senator Packwood called the staffer at the Finance Committee offices and asked her to come to his office to listen to a tape of songs by Erroll Garner and George Shearing.  When she arrived, Senator Packwood had a box of wine on his desk and was getting out two glasses.  This was the first time that the staffer had been alone with Senator Packwood in his office. Within moments of the staffer's arrival, Senator Packwood was called to a vote; he told her to stay until he returned.  As the staffer waited in Senator Packwood's office, his secretary, Pam Fulton, told her that she (the staffer) was new in the office, and Ms. Fulton wanted to warn her that she should not be there when the Senator returned.[fn 69]  The staffer left the office before Senator Packwood returned.<p> <p>    About this same time, the tone of the notes that Senator Packwood sent her with the tapes changed, and seemed to the staffer to become more "sentimental." She began to feel that Senator Packwood wanted an "emotional" type of friendship with her, of the type that she was not used to having with a supervisor.<p> <p>    Toward the end of October 1990, possibly October 30, Senator Packwood invited several staff members from the Finance Committee, including the staffer, to join him at the Irish Times bar to celebrate approval of the 1990 budget agreement.  He wanted to buy drinks to thank the staff for the long hours they had put in during the preceding weeks.  Senator Packwood sat next to the staffer at the bar.  Toward the end of the evening, Senator Packwood yelled to her, over the music, that they needed to find some way to "do this" without letting Elaine Franklin, his chief of staff, know.  He kept staring at her, and repeated that they needed to pursue this, but that Ms. Franklin could not come after her.  The staffer finally realized that Senator Packwood seemed to think that they were about to start a relationship, and she began to feel very nervous.  She excused herself to go to the ladies room, and tried to telephone her boyfriend (now her husband).<p> <p>    After the group had been at the bar for several hours, Senator Packwood asked another staffer, Lindy Paull, and her husband to drive him and the staffer back to his office.  He told them that he had something he wanted to show the staffer.<p> <p>    When they got to the office, Senator Packwood asked the Ms. Paull and her husband to go to one of the adjoining suites down the hall, because he had something he wanted to show the staffer. Senator Packwood then started showing the staffer cards in a card file that detailed the long relationships he had with national labor leaders.  Each time he showed her a card, he asked her, "Does Peter DeFazio know about this friendship?"  The staffer's boyfriend was the legislative director for Rep. Peter DeFazio of Oregon, who was considering running against Senator Packwood in the next election.<p> <p>    The staffer asked the Senator why he was doing this, and told him that she was loyal, that she was not going to go to Rep. DeFazio and tell him things about Senator Packwood.<p> <p>    Senator Packwood then grabbed the staffer by the shoulders with both hands, exclaimed "God, you're great!" and kissed her fully on the lips.  The staffer was stunned.  She did not want the Senator to go any further, but at the same time, she did not want to anger him.  She made an excuse that she had to go to the bathroom, and ran down the hall to another office.  She called her boyfriend and asked him to pick her up right away, left the building, and waited for him to arrive.<p> <p>    The staffer avoided the Senator for a month or so.  She made sure that she was always the first one to leave a meeting, and that she left in a crowd.  She did not tape any more music for Senator Packwood.  Senator Packwood no longer singled her out or paid her special compliments in staff meetings.<p> <p>    In August 1991, the staffer was promoted to press secretary for Senator Packwood's personal staff, with a salary increase.<p> <p>    Near the end of April 1992, the staffer learned from her former roommate that a free-lance reporter was working on a story about sexual harassment in the Senate.  The staffer felt that it was her duty as Senator Packwood's press secretary to share that information with him.  She did not have any intention of telling the reporter about her incident with Senator Packwood.<p> <p>    When the staffer told Senator Packwood about the reporter, he seemed frightened, and perplexed or confused about whether he had harassed anyone, and about what exactly constituted sexual harassment.  The staffer pointed out to Senator Packwood that if she did not respect him so much, she could claim that he had harassed her 18 months earlier.  Elaine Franklin was called in, and she quizzed the staffer about how she knew about the story, and which friend had told her about the story.  The staffer refused to say who had told her about the story, but gave Senator Packwood and Ms. Franklin the name and phone number of the reporter.<p> <p>    After the staffer told Senator Packwood and Ms. Franklin about the story that was being written, the staffer was left out of campaign meetings and strategy sessions.  She felt that there was a lack of trust in her, either because of the story or because she had married her boyfriend, who worked for Rep. DeFazio.  Eventually, she decided to leave the office.  When she did so, in July 1992, Senator Packwood and Elaine Franklin provided excellent recommendations to her current employer. <p> <p>      After the staffer told Senator Packwood and Elaine Franklin about the story, Ms. Franklin pressed her repeatedly for the names of others whom she told about the incident between herself and Senator Packwood.  The staffer told Ms. Franklin that she had told no one, although she had told her husband and her roommate; she was afraid that Ms. Franklin would hound them if she knew that the staffer had told them about the incident.  Before the staffer left for her new job, Ms. Franklin warned her not to say anything about the incident to her new employers, or to any women's groups.  Ms. Franklin continued to call the staffer through the fall, pressing her for information about whom she had told about the incident, and accusing her of lying when she denied telling anyone.<p> <p>   <H4>2.   Corroborating Witnesses</H4><p> <p>    Committee counsel deposed or interviewed four witnesses, including the staffer's husband and her roommate at the time of the incident, who recall the staffer telling them that Senator Packwood had kissed her in his office one evening after hours. The staffer's husband and her roommate recall that she told them about the incident almost immediately after it happened.[fn 70] Her husband testified that the staffer was so hysterical when he picked her up that evening that he thought at first that she might have been raped.<p> <p>    Another witness stated that the staffer told her in the summer of 1991 that Senator Packwood had tried to kiss her several times. once in his office after hours.<p> <p>    In addition, nine members of Senator Packwood's staff, including his chief of staff, have testified that the staffer told them that Senator Packwood had "crossed the line," or made an inappropriate advance, or kissed her, before word began spreading about the anticipated <I>Washington Post</I> article.  Several of these persons indicated that the staffer did not seem to take the incident all that seriously.  Elaine Franklin testified that when she heard from another staffer about the incident, she spoke with the staffer, and the staffer indicated that she was not concerned about it<p> <p>    Several members of Senator Packwood's staff have stated in depositions or interviews that when the rumors first started surfacing about the proposed story on Senator Packwood, there was much speculation in the office about whether the staffer would be one of the accusers, since she had told people about an incident before the possibility of an article came up.<p> <p> <H4>3.   Senator Packwood's Response</H4><p> <p>    Senator Packwood testified at his deposition that he recalled the staffer very well.  He claimed that the staff, both from the Finance Committee and his personal office, almost to a person intensely disliked and distrusted her, and advised him that she was unreliable and should be excluded from meetings. [fn 71] <p> <p>     However, he could not remember the name of any person who had so advised him.  He described it as the "collective wisdom" of the office, and as the staffer's "general reputation" in the office.<p> <p>    Nor could Senator Packwood recall when he had first heard complaints about the staffer, or even who had made the first complaint.  He described the complaints as rather serious:  that she lied, fantasized, and leaked information to the Democrats. [fn 72]  He did not know if any of these complaints had ever been documented in writing, nor did he produce anything to indicate that they had been.  He himself did not instruct anyone to do so. During an interview with <I>Washington Post</I> reporters in October 1992 about the allegation, Elaine Franklin had told the reporters that she would look for office records that reflected the staffer's poor performance.  Senator Packwood did not know if there were any such records, or if Ms. Franklin had found any, or even if they kept such records.  He stated that he did not know what Ms. Franklin was talking about, but that as far as he knew, there were no such files.<p> <p>    Senator Packwood disclaimed responsibility for making the decision to bring the staffer from the Finance Committee staff to his personal staff, although he did concede that he was aware of the decision, and that he had the power to veto it.  He stated that even if he were aware of the problems she had on the Finance Committee staff at the time, he would have approved her move to the personal staff, because he would assume that whoever made that decision knew about the problems too, and he did not feel strongly enough to veto that decision.<p> <p>    Senator Packwood's records indicate that the staffer received raises while on the Finance Committee, and that she received a small raise while she worked on his personal staff. Senator Packwood would not concede that he approved this raise, or even knew about it, saying that it could have been done without his knowledge, if someone just gave him a list of proposed raises which he signed without reviewing. [fn 73]<p> <p>    Senator Packwood claimed that once she was on the personal staff, the staffer caused problems with everyone who came in contact with her.  He stated that she was a topic of common complaint - that she was indiscreet, that she fantasized, that she lied, and that she was not to be trusted - but again, he could not remember any specific staff members who told him of these complaints.<p> <p>    Senator Packwood was referred to three entries in his diary where he reviewed the performance of his staff, something he did periodically throughout his diaries.  Senator Packwood stated that these reviews reflected his judgments about his staff members at the time. although he was sometimes wrong in those judgments.[fn 74] His staff reviews dated August 3 and November 5, 1990, do not mention the staffer, although he did not hesitate to make unfavorable comments about several other staffers.  His staff review dated March 16, 1992 indicates that the Senator viewed the staffer as "okay," but immature; he testified that by "immature," he meant that she was a "torrent of indiscretion." [fn 75] However, Senator Packwood did not mince words when describing the performance of other staffers in this entry.<p> <p>    In fact, there are a number of references to the staffer in Senator Packwood's diary during the time she worked for the Finance Committee and on his personal staff.  There is no indication that she was causing any problems, or that her conduct was as described by Senator Packwood in his deposition.  In fact, various entries indicate that it was good to have the staffer taking control of the press (May 10, 1991); that she continued to be the bright light - bold, imaginative, forward, and sassy (July 29, 1991); that the staffer made Senator Packwood believe (July 31, 1991); and that now that he was not thinking of running for President, Senator Packwood would bring her down as his press secretary once the election was over (July 31, 1991). [fn 76]<p> <p>    Senator Packwood testified that he liked the staffer, and tried to ignore the complaints for a long time.  They exchanged friendly notes, and tapes of music they both enjoyed.  The staffer invited him to attend a Mel Torme concert, he assumed as part of a group.  He testified that he later heard from another staffer (he did not recall who) that the staffer had intended to go to the concert alone with him, but that the other staffer had reprimanded her. Senator Packwood did attend the concert, with a group that included the staffer's boyfriend, a reporter for the Oregonian and her companion, Senator Packwood's companion, and perhaps a fourth couple. [fn 77]<p> <p>     Senator Packwood stated that the staffer often hung around his office after work until he invited her in for a glass of wine; she had wine with him more frequently than any other staffer.<p> <p>    Senator Packwood testified that he has had to piece together the events of the evening at the Irish Times.[fn 78] He had a dim recollection that a number of the staff went to the Irish Times one evening, where they drank heavily.  He recalled that he and the staffer did some heavy drinking; another staffer who was present told him later that they shared three large pitchers of beer; others who were present told him that after this other staffer left, the Senator and the staffer continued drinking.  He testified that he talked with the staffer about labor leaders, and which ones would be supportive of him in the campaign; he may have intended for her to pass the information on to the Democrats through her boyfriend.<p> <p>    Senator Packwood recalled "next to nothing"  about what happened after he left the Irish Times.  He has pieced together that he and the staffer were going to go back to the office to look-at cards.  Lindy Paull and her husband gave the staffer a ride, and offered to wait for her; she declined.  He did not recall how he got back to the office.  He stated that once at the office, he and the staffer began going through his card file, and he pointed out the names of some labor leaders.  He did not recall kissing the staffer that evening, and has no idea what happened after he left the office.<p> <p>    Senator Packwood testified that about a year later, around October 1991, he and the staffer invited a reporter to come by for a glass of wine.  The reporter left about 7:00 or 7:15, and the staffer stayed, and they continued drinking.  Later, the Senator got up to change a tape or to go to the bathroom. When he came back, the staffer wrapped her arms around his neck, and gave him a big romantic kiss, telling him that he was "wonderful," "warts and all." [fn 79]<p> <p>    In February or March of 1992, Elaine Franklin told the Senator that she had heard from others that the staffer claimed that the Senator had kissed her after the Irish Times party.  Ms. Franklin claimed that she had sat the staffer down and asked her about it; the staffer told her that it was nothing, they were both drunk, that it was a harmless kiss, and that she was flattered.  Ms. Franklin also told him that the staffer drank a lot and could not hold her liquor well.<p> <p>    Senator Packwood did not recall that the staffer had talked to him about the incident at any time, or more specifically in the spring of 1992, when she met with him and Elaine Franklin to tell them about the Vanity Fair article. [fn 80] He assumed that the staffer was trying to help them, but that he and Ms. Franklin just did not trust the staffer, as far as what she said her sources were for the rumors about the story.<p> <p>    The staffer left Senator Packwood's office in 1992.  He recalled a brief conversation with her current supervisor, asking if the Senator would mind if they hired the staffer.  Senator Packwood told him that he would not mind.  He testified that he was happy to have her go.<p> <p>    Senator Packwood was shown a press release from his office, noting that the the [sic] staffer's new employer was getting an experienced press person in the staffer, and quoting Senator Packwood: <blockquote> <p> "[The staffer] has spent years working on issues related to the [new employer]. She will serve them well.  This is really a golden opportunity for her." [fn 81]</blockquote> <p>    Senator Packwood testified that he could not recall when he first saw this press release, or if anyone else in his office saw it before it went out.  He did not know if it was customary for his office to issue a press release when a staffer took another job, or whether this was the first time such a press release had been issued.<p> <p>    Senator Packwood testified that the staffer was overtly friendly to him, hung around and drank with him, flirted with him, and sought his attention and approval.  He thought that she wanted to be close to him, to be his "number one."  But he stated that it would be too strong a characterization to say that she wanted a romantic or sexual relationship with him.  He never had the sense that she wanted to have an affair with him, or to go to bed with him.<p> <p>    Senator Packwood recalled that the staffer wore short skirts and low-cut blouses to work, but he never said anything about it. He learned from Lindy Paull, after the <I>Post</I> interview, that she had talked to the staffer about inappropriate and unprofessional dress.<p> <p>    In response to the Committee's document requests, Senator Packwood provided "Ramspeck" application forms that had been filled out for the staffer, dated April 29, 1992, in connection with her application to her new employer.  One of these forms was signed by Senator Packwood's office manager, Jackie Wilcox, and one purported to be signed by Senator Packwood.  The forms indicated that the staffer's performance as an employee had been "extraordinarily effective and efficient."  Senator Packwood testified that the signature was not his.  He could not say who in his office had the authority to sign his name to official documents, but only that his office had a sort of "rule of reason" approach to the subject.  Senator Packwood's attorneys later provided a statement to the Committee from Ms. Wilcox, stating that the staffer had asked her to fill out the form, and that when she learned that she needed the Senator's signature, she had asked Ms. Wilcox to sign it.<p> <p>      In his appearance before the Committee, Senator Packwood repeated his claim that there had been many problems with this employee. He also emphasized that other witnesses had claimed that this staffer acted in such a way to suggest that she wanted a sexual relationship with him, and that on the evening of the incident, she was all over him. He told the Committee that it was understandable that he might have perceived that she wanted him to kiss her, and that he was only human.<p> <p>        <H4>4. Findings</H4><p> <p>      Senate Ethics Counsel finds that the incident as alleged by the staff member did in fact occur. Counsel notes that the staff member's account of the incident has been corroborated,~in whole or part, by numerous persons, including Elaine Franklin, Senator Packwood's chief of staff and several staff members. Senator Packwood himself has not denied that the incident occurred; he has testified that he was too drunk to remember the details of the evening.<p> <p>      Counsel notes that Senator Packwood has gone to great lengths to portray this staff member as untrustworthy. This claim, even if proven, has no relevance to a determination as to whether the incident as alleged actually occurred. The fact that this staff member may have lied on other occasions, or that she may have been untrustworthy because her boyfriend worked for one of Senator Packwood's opponents, sheds absolutely no light on whether she fabricated the incident in question. Moreover, the accounts of the numerous persons whom she told about this incident, including Ms. Franklin, his chief of staff, overwhelmingly confirm that it did in fact happen.<p> <p>      Even if Senator Packwood's claims that this staff member was untrustworthy were relevant to a determination of whether this incident in fact occurred, these claims are belied by the lack of any contemporaneous documentation from Senator Packwood's files indicating that this staff member was indeed the terrible employee that he portrays. In fact, she moved from the Finance Committee staff to his personal staff, and received several salary raises. A glowing press release was issued on her departure. And although Senator Packwood made it a practice to critique his employees frequently in his diary, and did not hesitate to make fairly scathing comments about them, there is not one mention in his diaries while this staff member worked for him that indicates she was a problem employee. To the contrary, there are several complimentary references to her.<p> <p>      Senator Packwood himself has as much as admitted that this incident took place: he told the Committee during his appearance before it that several of his staff members have said that this staff member acted in a way to suggest that she was interested in a sexual relationship with him, that it was understandable why he might conclude that she wanted him to kiss her, and that he only acted in a human fashion. In short, he had suggested that the staffer enticed him into an overture that he perceived as welcome. In fact, however, at his deposition, when asked whether he concluded from anything that the staffer did that she wanted a romantic or sexual relationship with him, Senator Packwood responded that although she wanted a close relationship with him, and her nature was "obviously flirtatious" with him, "romantic or "sexual - would be too strong a word, and he never had the sense that the staffer was saying "let's have an affair," or "let's go to bed together.' In other words, this staff member never said or did anything that led him to conclude that she was interested in a romantic or sexual relationship with him.  <p> <p>      Senator Packwood proffers the fact that this staff member continued to work for him, that she continued to send him warm notes, and that she kissed him about a year later.  Of course, these facts, even if true, do not prove that the incident did not take place.  They may indicate that the staff member did not take the incident seriously, as some of Senator Packwood's staff members have testified.  Or they may indicate that the staff member did not feel that she had the power to do anything about the incident, and chose to maintain a good relationship with the Senator for the sake of her job and her career.<p> <p>    Senate Ethics Counsel finds that Senator Packwood's conduct in this instance fits a pattern of conduct that reflects an abuse of his position of authority, a pattern of conduct that constitutes improper conduct reflecting upon the Senate.<p> <p>    <H3>B.   Judy Foster-Filppi</H3><p> <p>          <H4>1.   Testimony of Ms. Foster-Filppi</H4><p> <p>    In the early 1980's, Ms. Foster-Filppi was a Packwood supporter who frequently hosted get-togethers for Senator Packwood and his wife and supporters at her home.  She was an important contact for Senator Packwood's campaign in the Lane County and Eugene area, and by 1985 was discussing with a Packwood staffer the possibility of heading up the re-election campaign in Lane County.<p> <p>    On a weekday in early 1985, perhaps March or April, when she had known Senator Packwood for about four years, Ms. Foster- Filppi went to Bend, Oregon, with Senator Packwood and Elaine Franklin, for a campaign appearance at a supporter get-together. Senator Packwood and Ms. Franklin picked Ms. Foster-Filppi up at her home in a motor coach, and they travelled about three hours to reach Bend.  The motor coach was driven by another staff member, and they were also accompanied by another woman staff member.  That evening, there was dinner and wine and dancing for thirty or forty business supporters at the River House, which is where the group spent the night.<p> <p>    After dinner, when the group had moved into another room for dancing, Senator Packwood asked Ms. Foster-Filppi to dance. While they were dancing, Senator Packwood pulled her close, put his hands on her back, and rubbed her back, buttocks and sides. At least twice, she pushed him away, and tried to distract him with conversation.  She specifically remembers discussing briefly whether Senator Packwood was going to run for the presidency. Bach time, Senator Packwood pulled her back, and again rubbed her back, buttocks, and sides.  He nuzzled her neck several times, and several times pushed his hips and pelvic area into her body as he held his hand on her lower back.  When the dance ended, she moved away.  She knew that he had been drinking that evening, although she did not think that he was drunk.  She kept her distance after that, and left the gathering a short time later to return to her room.  The next morning, the Senator and his staff dropped her off in Eugene, and traveled on to Portland in the van.<p> <p>    Later in 1985, possibly in the summer, Ms. Foster-Filppi attended a small dinner party in Eugene, Oregon, along with Senator Packwood and Elaine Franklin.  When the party was over, at Ms. Franklin's request, Ms. Foster-Filppi drove her and the Senator back to the New Oregon Motel, where they were staying. Senator Packwood sat in the front passenger bucket seat, and Ms. Franklin sat in the rear behind the campaign worker.  When Ms. Foster-Filppi pulled into the motel parking lot, Ms. Franklin gave her a hug, said goodnight, and got out of the van.  Senator Packwood told Ms. Franklin that he was just going to say goodnight to Ms. Foster-Filppi and he would be right in.  After Ms. Franklin left, Senator Packwood moved towards Ms. Foster- Filppi with his hands out.  Ms. Foster-Filppi assumed that he was about to give her a hug, just as Ms. Franklin had done, and she moved towards him with her arms out.  He grabbed her face with his hands, pulled her towards him, and kissed her on the mouth, forcing his tongue into her mouth.  She put her arms on his shoulders and pushed him away, and said goodnight.  The Senator said goodnight and got out, and she drove away.<p> <p>    The next day, Ms. Foster-Filppi called Elaine Franklin and told her what had happened.  She told Ms. Franklin that she was upset, that she felt deceived, and she was not sure if she could trust the Senator anymore.  She asked Ms. Franklin if this was the kind of behavior that she could expect if she became involved in the Senator's campaign.  Ms. Franklin apologized and told Ms. Foster-Filppi not to worry, that she could not imagine what had gotten into Senator Packwood; she said that it would never happen again, and that she would talk to the Senator.  Several days later, Senator Packwood called Ms. Foster-Filppi at her home; she judged from the stern and forceful tone of his voice that he was upset.  He told her that he knew she was upset with him, and that she had talked with Ms. Franklin about something he had done.  He told her that she should never talk to someone else if she had a problem with his behavior, but that she should talk with him and he would handle it.  He told her that there was no reason to talk to anybody else about his behavior.<p> <p>    After this incident and the telephone call, Ms. Foster- Filppi felt that she could no longer trust Senator Packwood.  She did not want to put herself in a position where she would be physically close to him, and she questioned whether she could even continue to support him for re-election.  In October or November of 1985, she told Elaine Franklin that she was too busy to manage the campaign in Lane County.  Ms. Franklin was very upset, and told her that they had been counting on her.<p> <p>      <H4>2.   Corroborating Witnesses</H4><p> <p>    Ms. Foster-Filppi testified that other than Ms. Franklin, she did not tell anyone about the incidents with Senator Packwood.  Ms. Franklin confirmed that the campaign worker, who was being considered to be co-chair of the Lane County campaign, had told her, in 1985, that the Senator had hugged her and kissed her, and that Ms. Foster-Filppi was "surprised" by his actions; she passed this information on to the Senator.<p> <p>      <H4>3.   Senator Packwood's Response</H4><p> <p>    Senator Packwood met Ms. Foster-Filppi in 1981, when Eugenia Hutton, another campaign worker, had her arrange a coffee for the Senator at her house.  From that time until 1986, she and Ms. Hutton were his two principal contacts in Lane County, and Ms. Foster-Filppi ended up taking over from Ms. Hutton.<p> <p>    Senator Packwood claimed that he had checked hi6 travel records, and that he was not in Bend at all in 1985, when Ms. Foster-Filppi claimed the incident occurred at the River House.  He stated that it would be unusual to go over the mountains and back, from Eugene to Bend, over so short a time in the winter. He had no recollection of ever driving from Eugene to Bend with Ms. Foster-Filppi in the motor coach, nor did he recall ever being at the River House with Ms. Foster-Filppi   He did not recall the incident that Ms. Foster-Filppi described, whether it occurred at the River House or elsewhere.<p> <p>    Senator Packwood did not recall a specific dinner party that he attended with Ms. Foster-Filppi in Eugene in 1985, but he did recall that Ms. Foster-Filppi drove him and Elaine Franklin back from a function in Eugene, presumably to their motel.  He stated that Ms. Foster-Filppi got out of the van to say good night to them, and gave Ms. Franklin a hug.  She then put her arms out toward him, and he gave her a warm kiss on the lips; he did not recall if it was a french kiss.  He did not recall kissing Ms. Foster-Filppi at any time before that.<p> <p>    Sometime later, perhaps the next time they were in Eugene, Elaine Franklin told him that she had had drinks with Ms. Foster- Filppi, who had told her that Senator Packwood had kissed her. Ms. Franklin told the Senator that he should not be so enthusiastic with volunteers.  Senator Packwood thought that he had called Ms. Foster-Filppi and said something to the effect of, "for gosh sakes, Judy, if you've got any problems, call me directly."  He claimed that she continued to work actively in his 1986 campaign, and through the election. They had considered her in 1985 for the county chair position, but she declined.  Senator Packwood stated that at this point, the county chair position was being phased out anyway.<p> <p>    Senator Packwood was questioned about an entry in his diary for August 5, 1993:[fn 82]<blockquote> <p> "... if they're not going to take hearsay, then they've got to take only complaining witnesses.  And if they don't have Judy Foster, and whatever that woman's name is, the intern - - I mean, ex-intern, she wasn't an intern - - as complaining witnesses, then I think there is nothing in this decade of any consequence to be afraid of."</blockquote> <p>    Senator Packwood testified that they had figured out that Ms. Foster-Filppi was making a claim, based on the descriptions in the media accounts.  He testified that "they" in the entry referred to the Ethics Committee, and that they believed that if the Committee were to judge conduct that occurred a long time ago differently than conduct that occurred in the last ten years, the only allegation they knew of other than one other staffer's (C-1) was the claim that Senator Packwood tried to kiss Ms. Foster- Filppi.  Senator Packwood would not say whether he thought it would be more damaging if incidents occurred in the past decade, as opposed to earlier.<p> <p>    In his appearance before the Committee, Senator Packwood stated that he had searched his records, and that he had concluded that the incident described by Ms. Foster-Filppi as occurring after a dinner party in Eugene had actually happened in 1981, and not in 1985, as she alleges.  He claimed that in reviewing her description of the dinner party, he had deduced where it had taken place, and had talked to the persons he concluded gave the dinner party, who confirmed that the dinner party took place in 1981.  Senator Packwood offered this conclusion to bolster his claim that all of the incidents, save the incident alleged to have occurred in 1990, had happened more than ten years earlier.<p> <p>    However, Ms. Foster-Filppi specifically recalls that this incident occurred when she had known Senator Packwood for about four years, and close to the 1986 election, and that when she declined the position of County Chair, Senator Packwood's staffer was upset because they had counted on her.  The timing is corroborated by the testimony of Elaine Franklin, who recalls that Ms. Foster-Filppi told her of the incident in 1985, at a time when they were considering her to be a co-County chair.<p> <p>    Senator Packwood also claimed that Ms. Foster-Filppi had maintained friendly relations with him, and that she had returned a postcard indicating that she would be happy to allow her name to be used on a list of persons who supported him for reelection in 1992.  Senator Packwood has not provided the Committee with this postcard.<p> <p>    <H4>4.   Findings</H4><p> <p>    Senate Ethics Counsel finds that the incidents as alleged by Ms. Foster-Filppi in fact occurred.  The first incident described by Ms. Foster-Filppi, which occurred during a function in Bend, Oregon, has not been contested by Senator Packwood, except to offer that his travel and other records did not reflect that he went from Eugene to Bend and back in 1985. Otherwise, he has testified that he does not recall the incident.<p> <p>    Although his recollection of the details differs from that of Ms. Foster-Filppi, Senator Packwood has admitted that he kissed her after she drove him and Ms. Franklin to their hotel after a dinner party in Eugene.  He does not deny, but simply does not recall, certain details of the incident, such as whether he gave Ms. Foster-Filppi a french kiss.  Ms. Foster-Filppi's claim is corroborated, at least to the extent that Senator Packwood kissed her, and with respect to the timing of the incident, by the testimony of Elaine Franklin, to whom Ms. Foster-Filppi complained after the incident. <p> <p>    Senate Ethics Counsel finds that Senator Packwood's conduct in this instance fits a pattern of conduct that reflects an abuse of his position of authority, a pattern of conduct that constitutes improper conduct reflecting upon the Senate.<p> <p>    <H3>C.   Mary Heffernan</H3><p> <p>      <H4>1.   Testimony of Mary Heffernan</H4><p> <p>    In 1981 and 1982, Mary Heffernan was employed by the National Abortion Rights Action League (NARAL).  As part of her job, she communicated with Senator Packwood, who was a powerful NARAL ally, on issues affecting reproductive choice.  In connection with her job, she spoke with Senator Packwood six to twelve times a year, mostly by telephone.  Senator Packwood frequently wrote Ms. Heffernan notes that were supportive and encouraging, and also sometimes very flattering, telling her what a good job she was doing for the abortion rights movement.  He also wrote to her parents praising her work and abilities. Because of the warm and personal nature of the notes, Ms. Heffernan felt that Senator Packwood was singling her out for special attention, possibly grooming her to work for him in the future.<p> <p>    During that time period, Ms. Heffernan set up an appointment with Senator Packwood's staff to meet him at his office in Washington, D.C. to discuss issues relating to abortion legislation.  When she arrived at the office, Ms. Heffernan was escorted into Senator Packwood's private office; the Senator sat behind his desk, and she sat in front of the desk.  The door to the outer office was closed.  They talked for about thirty minutes about abortion legislation issues.  Toward the end of the meeting, when Ms. Heffernan got up from her chair and started to move away, Senator Packwood came around his desk, put his hands on her upper arms and squeezed them, and leaned over and gave her a sensual, sexual kiss on the mouth.  She stepped back, got her coat, opened the door, and quickly left the room.<p> <p>    After this incident, Ms. Heffernan was careful to avoid being alone with the Senator.  She did not complain to anyone about the incident, out of concern that that might adversely affect the abortion rights cause for which she was working so hard.  Her contacts with Senator Packwood were less frequent, and the correspondence from Senator Packwood slowed. <p> <p>        Ms. Heffernan left NARAL in March of 1983.  Two or three times after that, she heard from Senator Packwood, who called her to ask what she was doing.  Although nothing specific was ever said, her impression was that Senator Packwood might be considering asking her to come work on his staff.<p> <p>     <H4>2.   Corroborating Witnesses</H4><p> <p>    Ms. Heffernan testified that she told no one about this incident.  Her former husband contacted the Committee, and stated that while he did not think that she would lie about the actual incident that occurred, he would not believe her if she claimed that the incident had a negative effect on her.  He indicated that in the fall of 1983, when she was living with him, Senator Packwood had called her; after the call, she told him that she thought the Senator was interested in hiring her.  Although she did not tell him so, her ex-husband had the impression that she might be interested in taking the job. He indicated that he and Ms. Heffernan had had an unpleasant divorce. <p> <p>     <H4>3.   Senator Packwood's Response</H4><p> <p>    Senator Packwood recalled meeting Ms. Heffernan in 1977, when she visited his office with a friend.  She was very active in his 1980 campaign, and he continued to see her in 1981 and 1982 when she was active in NARAL.  In February 1984, he talked with her on the phone about working for him.  About a month later, he and Elaine Franklin took Ms. Heffernan to lunch in the Senate dining room, and Ms. Heffernan asked if there would be a spot for her in the 1986 campaign.[fn 83]  Later, she also asked one of his friends the same thing; he talked with Senator Packwood about it.  Senator Packwood did not offer Ms. Heffernan a job, because she wanted a job as a volunteer coordinator, and he did not think that was the job for her:  she was a good worker, but not very good at producing volunteers.<p> <p>    Senator Packwood did not recall the incident described by Ms. Heffernan, or that he ever kissed her at any time.<p> <p>    In his appearance before the Committee, Senator Packwood emphasized that Ms. Heffernan had maintained a warm, close relationship with him after the incident, that she had sought a job with him, and that she had in fact kissed him on a subsequent occasion.[fn 84]<p> <p>      <H4>4.   Findings</H4><p> <p>    Senate Ethics Counsel finds that the incident as alleged by Ms. Heffernan in fact occurred.  Although there are no corroborating witnesses, Senator Packwood has offered no evidence to refute Ms. Heffernan's testimony about the incident; he has testified only that he does not recall the incident.  Senator Packwood has proferred evidence that Ms. Heffernan maintained a warm and close relationship with him after the incident, and even sought a job with him, presumably either to show that the incident did not occur, or that if it did, Ms. Heffernan could not have been offended.  However, even if true, the fact that Ms. Heffernan maintained a close relationship with the Senator, and sought a job with him, does not prove that the incident did not happen.  It could indicate that Ms. Heffernan did not take offense at the incident, or it could indicate that she recognized the need to maintain a good relationship with a powerful person who was very important to her career.<p> <p>    Senate Ethics Counsel finds that Senator Packwood's conduct in this instance fits a pattern of conduct that reflects an abuse of his position of authority, a pattern of conduct that constitutes improper conduct reflecting upon the Senate.<p> <p>    <H3>D.   Paige Wagers</H3><p> <p>          <H4>1.   Testimony by Paige Wagers</H4><p> <p>    Paige Wagers worked for Senator Packwood as a mail clerk from the summer of 1975 until the summer of 1976.  Sometime in late 1975, she was sitting at her desk in the mail room when her intercom buzzed.  When the she picked up her phone, Senator Packwood asked her to come to his office.  She was nervous, because she had never been called into the Senator's office before.  Up to that point, she had seen Senator Packwood at staff meetings, or in passing in the hall; it was not customary for her to have contact with him.  She walked towards the Senator's office, and noticed that there was no one in the reception area outside the Senator's office, where the secretary and appointment secretary usually sat.  Senator Packwood was standing just inside the door of his office, waiting for her.  He told her to come in, and she went into his office.<p> <p>    Senator Packwood immediately closed the door, and without saying anything to Ms. Wagers, grabbed her and pinned her with her back up against a wall or a small desk.  He held her hair with one hand, bending her head backwards.  His other hand stroked her hair and arm and chest.  He pressed his face against hers so hard that she could not move him away, and kissed her, sticking his tongue in her mouth.  Ms. Wagers tried to get her hands up to push Senator Packwood away, and to keep his hand away from her breasts.  Senator Packwood's body was pressed so closely against Ms. Wagers' that she could not move.  When the kiss was over, Ms. Wagers turned her head and started talking; Senator Packwood tried to kiss her again, but she kept turning her head from side to side.  She told Senator Packwood that she wanted their relationship to be professional, that she liked him very much, and liked her job very much, but she did not think this was the right thing to do.  She told him that she respected him, that he was married, and that it was not proper for them to be in his office alone, or for him to be kissing her.  She told Senator Packwood that she did not want this kind of a relationship with him, that it was not right for her, that she respected him and really wanted to keep on working there.  Senator Packwood told her that he liked her hair, he thought she was young and beautiful and innocent and wholesome, and he liked her wholesomeness and everything about her.  He told her that he just wanted to touch her, and repeated many times that she was so wholesome.  He continued trying to kiss her, with one hand holding her head back by her hair, and the other hand touching her arm and chest.  Finally he let her go  she told him she had to go back to work, and left his office.<p> <p>    Ms. Wagers returned to her desk, shaking and crying.  She told friends about the incident, and was advised to say nothing. This was her first job, and she had been advised that she should stay in a job for at least a year before moving on to another one.  She waited until the summer of 1976, and left Senator Packwood's office.<p> <p>    Ms. Wagers continued to see Senator Packwood occasionally, when she attended staff reunions, or functions with Tim Lee, a Packwood staff member whom she dated for a time after she left Senator Packwood's office.<p> <p>    In the spring of 1981, Ms. Wagers was working as a special assistant for legislative affairs at the Department of Labor. One day, as she got off the elevator on her way down to the basement of the Capitol, she ran into Senator Packwood, who was coming up the escalator from the trolley that runs from the Senate office buildings.  There were many people around, and she and Senator Packwood ended up by chance right next to each other, between the escalators from the trolley and the elevator. Senator Packwood said hello to her, very politely touched her lightly on both arms and asked how she was, and said that it was nice to see her.  He engaged her in conversation.<p> <p>    Although her initial reaction was to experience a jolt of fear, Senator Packwood's conversation made her feel comfortable and secure that nothing would happen.  Indeed, nothing had occurred on the few occasions she had seen him since the previous incident which led her to think anything would happen again. She also thought that she had made it very clear to Senator Packwood how she felt, that he was not supposed to touch her or try to kiss her.  By his conversation during this chance meeting, Senator Packwood made her feel that he was interested in her as , person - he asked her about her job, told her that he was proud of her for getting her job, and that if he or his office could help her, she should let him know.  As they talked, and she told Senator Packwood about her job, he told her that he had to walk down to his office for a minute; he asked her to come with him and tell him what she was working on. Senator Packwood ushered her down a hallway in the Capitol basement that ran from the Senate side to the House side, toward the barber shop.<p> <p>    As they walked, she talked about her job.  She felt very good about herself, that she finally had a job with responsibility, and knew a Senator who was willing to help her if she needed help.  She felt that Senator Packwood was taking her seriously, as a business person with legitimate business to conduct. Senator Packwood then opened a door, ushered her into a room, and immediately closed the door.  The room was a small cubbyhole with a desk, a couch, and some books, and possibly a chair.  Without warning, Senator Packwood grabbed her by putting both hands in her hair, and he pressed his body and face against her, pushing her up against the desk.  He ran his hands through her hair, and kissed her, sticking his tongue in her mouth.  Ms. Wagers struggled to pull back, and to push him away with her hands.  Again, she started talking, saying that she thought she had made it clear that she did not appreciate this type of attention, that she would like to think that he would help her if she needed help in her job, that she liked and respected him very much, but she did not want this kind of relationship.  She told him that she thought he understood that, that she knew he was married, and she was now married, and this was not what she wanted.  Senator Packwood again told her that he loved her wholesomeness and her hair, that he thought she was young and innocent, that he liked her very much, and was very attracted to her.  He told her that he could really help her with her job, he liked her so much, and he did not want her to go.  He continued to try to kiss her, but she kept turning her head and pushing him away.  She was anxious to make it clear that she did not want to do anything, but at the same time, she did not want to offend Senator Packwood. When Senator Packwood reached toward a pillow on the couch behind her, she was able to get away; she stepped around him and left the office.<p> <p>    This second incident had a devastating effect on her.  As she had walked down the Capitol hallway with Senator Packwood, she had felt very good, as if she had finally made something of herself, and shed the blond stereotype.  She had gotten a serious job, her first job with responsibility.  She was pleased that she had a formal relationship with a Senator, that if she needed help, he would help her, and that she could be taken seriously. When Senator Packwood grabbed her, all of her confidence in herself died.  She felt betrayed.  She felt that she had not done anything to encourage Senator Packwood, and yet he still touched her without her consent.  She did not feel that she would be able to work effectively after that with members of Congress, or that she could be anywhere where she would see Senator Packwood.  She eventually resigned from the Department of Labor.  She believes that this second assault was a contributing factor to her decision to resign, that part of the reason she stopped working was because she was afraid to be around men, and she was specifically afraid of Senator Packwood.  Since then, she has not had any kind of business career; she has done menial work for a few months for an agency that was going out of business, and she has taught dance, which is what she does now.<p> <p>    She believes that she has been hurt in every possible way by the incidents with Senator Packwood - that emotionally, financially, and intellectually she has remained frozen in time. She is now divorced, and needs to go back to work, but since she has-not worked since the early 1980's, she does not have the background or credentials she needs to get a good job.  Her only experience has been on Capitol Hill, and she cannot get a job there now because of her fear, her lack of working experience, and the media coverage of the incidents.<p> <p>        <H4>2.   Corroborating Witnesses</H4><p> <p>    The staff has interviewed two persons who recall that Ms. Wagers told them, in the 1970's, that Senator Packwood called her into his office, where he grabbed her and kissed her, and stuck his tongue in her mouth.  One of these witnesses was a co-worker with Ms. Wagers, in whom she confided almost immediately after the incident.  He stated that Ms. Wagers asked him to take a walk, and she related the incident.  She was shocked, disgusted, and very upset.<p> <p>    Four other former coworkers recalled that Ms. Wagers had told them about the incident in varying degrees of vague detail: one recalls that Ms. Wagers said she had had a "contact" with Senator Packwood, which the witness had the impression was a kiss; one recalls that Ms. Wagers said Senator Packwood had made an unwanted advance; one recalls that Ms. Wagers said that Senator Packwood had "hit on her , which he interpreted as a verbal come-on; one recalls that Ms. Wagers vaguely indicated that "something happened" with Senator Packwood.  One additional former coworker recalled hearing from others that Senator Packwood had made a pass at Ms. Wagers, although she had not heard about any aspect of forcefulness.<p> <p>    An additional witness, who worked with Ms. Wagers at the Council on Wage and Price Stability, has a vivid recollection of attending a "welcome home" ceremony for the Iran hostages on the South Lawn of the White House.[fn 85] The whole Council had been invited, and he walked over to the ceremony with Ms. Wagers. When they arrived, he saw Senator Packwood, and pointed him out to Ms. Wagers.  According to him, Ms. Wagers had a visible, physical negative reaction; he believes that she recoiled, and changed the direction that she was walking.  She indicated to him that she did not want Senator Packwood to see her.  When he inquired what had happened, she told him that she used to work for Senator Packwood, and that he had attacked her.  He does not recall that Ms. Wagers gave him any more specific details of the incident.  A year or so later, Ms. Wagers told this same witness that she had run into Senator Packwood in the Capitol, and that he had pushed her into a room in the "catacombs" where he pushed her on a couch and tried to have his way with her.<p> <p>    The staff has also interviewed another friend of Ms. Wagers, whom she met in 1988 or 1989.  During the course of talking about their job histories and career experiences, she told him that she had worked for Senator Packwood and that he had called her into her office and tried to kiss her on the neck; she tried to resist, and made it clear that she was not interested.  Ms. Wagers also told him that a few years later, she ran into Senator Packwood in the basement of the Capitol building; that they engaged in conversation, and Ms. Wagers was pleased that he took an interest in her.  He then led her into an unmarked office, closed the door, tried to push her against furniture or a wall, and tried to fondle her.  Ms. Wagers told him that she had been extremely upset by the incident.<p> <p>    The staff also took the deposition of another former staffer, a friend of Ms. Wagers, who testified that in 1975 or 1976, Ms. Wagers told him that Senator Packwood had called her into his office late in the work day, and had embraced and kissed her.  She seemed upset and distressed about the incident. Later, in 1980 or 1981, Ms. Wagers, who was working for the Labor Department at the time, told him that she had seen Senator Packwood on the Hill, and that they had been walking down a hallway when he ushered her into a room off the hall[fn 86], and embraced her and kissed her.  She appeared upset and distressed about this incident.<p> <p>    In addition, Tim Lee, a former staffer, testified that she told him when they were dating that Senator Packwood had kissed her.  Another former staffer testified that she had also told him, when he worked for Senator Packwood, that Senator Packwood had called her into his office and kissed her, and that she had left in tears.<p> <p>     <H4>3.   Senator Packwood's Response   </H4>    <p> <p>       Senator Packwood recalled that Ms. Wagers worked in his office in the mid-1970's.  He remembered her as young, blond, and personable; he did not recall her duties in the office.  He did not recall ever being alone with her when she worked for him.  He did not recall the first incident as described by Ms. Wagers, nor did he recall ever kissing her while she worked for him.<p> <p>    Senator Packwood did not recall the incident that Ms. Wagers claims occurred in 1981 in the basement of the Capitol.  He stated that he did have a Capitol office, that he did not recall where it was, but it was not in the basement. He recalled that she came back to an office party after she left his office, with Mr. Lee, a staffer whom she was dating at the time.  He recalled that she was friends with people in the office, and that she dated another staffer when she worked in the office.<p> <p>    Senator Packwood testified that Mimi Dawson, his former administrative assistant, told him that Ms. Wagers had come to her and told her that she thought Senator Packwood wanted to have an affair with her, and that she was considering whether she should do so.  In fact, Ms. Dawson testified that Ms. Wagers had approached her and told her that she thought the Senator wanted to have an affair with her, and that she got the impression that Ms. Wagers was asking her whether she thought she should have the affair.  She testified:<blockquote> <p> "A:   I got the impression she was asking me whether I thought she should have the affair or not. <p> <p> Q:  And what was there that gave you that impression?  <p> <p> A:  Just I didn't get a sense that she was complaining about, but trying to work through something, what should she do.  I kind of had the feeling that it was more like this big, important person wants to have an affair with her. Will I offend him if I don't have this affair with him, or do I want to have this affair with him.  I don't think she knew.  And I got the impression she was asking me for my counsel."[fn 87]</blockquote> <p>    Senator Packwood's diary for December 14, 1992, contains the following entry, recounting his conversation with Ms. Dawson:  <blockquote> <p> "Then there was the Paige Wagers incident.  It happened in '76.  Mimi was press secretary.[fn 88]  Alan was AA.  Paige, and Mimi sort of remembers this pretty specifically, Paige came to Mimi and said something like "I think the Senator wants to have an affair with me and what do you think I should do about it." Mimi got the very definite impression that Paige wanted to have the affair with me.  Mimi says she remembers telling Paige, "Well, you're both consenting adults.  Do what you want but I would suggest you go off and get married."</blockquote> <p>    Senator Packwood did not recall that Ms. Wagers ever said or did anything to suggest to him that she was interested in any type of romantic or sexual relationship with him.<p> <p>          <H4>4.   Findings</H4><p> <p>    Senate Ethics Counsel finds that the incidents as alleged by Ms. Wagers in fact occurred.  Her account of both incidents has been corroborated by numerous witnesses who recall that she told them about one or both incidents, in varying amounts of detail, shortly after they occurred.  Senator Packwood has not denied the incidents, but has stated that he simply does not have any recollection of them.<p> <p>    Senator Packwood has attempted to suggest that Ms. Wagers, after the first incident, was entertaining the possibility of an affair with him, based upon her conversation with Ms. Dawson, possibly indicating that his advances, if they occurred, were not unwelcome.  Counsel, however, views this conversation as an attempt by a very junior staff member to discreetly and circumspectly seek the advice of a woman supervisor.  Senator Packwood himself has testified that Ms. Wagers never said or did anything that led him to conclude that she was interested in a sexual relationship with him.<p> <p>    Moreover, the tone of Ms. Wagers's comments when she related these incidents to others clearly indicated that she was upset by them, <STRONG>not</STRONG> that she was considering whether to have an affair with the Senator.<p> <p>    Senate Ethics Counsel finds that Senator Packwood's conduct in this instance fits a pattern of conduct that reflects an abuse of his position of authority, a pattern of conduct that constitutes improper conduct reflecting upon the Senate.<p> <p>    <H3>E.   Eugenia Hutton</H3><p> <p>      <H4>1.   Testimony of Eugenia Hutton</H4><p> <p>    In November of 1979, Eugenia Hutton responded to a fund- raising letter written by Gloria Steinem by contributing money to Senator Packwood's campaign. A few weeks later, Brad Stocks, a Packwood staff member contacted her and asked if she would be willing to be involved in the campaign, clipping newspapers or something of that nature.  Ms. Hutton indicated that she would be interested, and Mr. Stocks met with her for coffee when he came to Eugene.  Later, Mr. Stocks called her and asked if she would be interested in being the chairperson for Lane County.  Ms. Hutton responded that she had no experience in that sort of thing, but Mr. Stocks indicated that they could teach her what she needed to know.  She told Mr. Stocks that she was interested in the opportunity.  Senator Packwood then called her on the telephone to congratulate her for being on his campaign, to tell her that he knew she could handle the job and would do a great job, and that they could teach her everything she needed to know.<p> <p>    Subsequently, Ms. Hutton hosted coffees and volunteer functions at her house, which were attended by Senator Packwood as well as his wife, Georgie. As the campaign intensified, Ms. Hutton travelled to volunteer functions and appearances with the Senator.<p> <p>    In about March, 1980, Ms. Hutton went to the restaurant at the Red Lion Inn on Coburg Road in Eugene, Oregon, to meet with Senator Packwood and Mimi Dawson, his chief of staff.  Senator Packwood was going to Coos Bay the next day, and wanted to prepare for that, and he also wanted Ms. Hutton to meet his chief of staff.  Ms. Hutton arrived at the restaurant in the early evening, about 5:30 or 6:00, and sat in a booth with Senator Packwood and two staff members, Mr. Stocks and Bob Witeck.  Ms. Dawson arrived and sat down at the booth, where she was introduced to Ms. Hutton.  They chatted for a while, and Ms. Dawson left.<p> <p>    After a while, Senator Packwood asked the other staff members at the table to leave.  There was teasing from the staff members, who told Senator Packwood that they were going to stay and hang around with him.  Ms. Hutton had the impression that the staff members were staying at the table on purpose. Senator Packwood became more firm in his suggestions that the staff members leave.  Finally, Senator Packwood made it clear that he wanted himself and Ms. Hutton to be left alone, and everyone left.  Ms. Hutton recalls that the Senator may have been drinking, although she does not recall that he had any difficulty in walking.  She does not remember if she had anything to drink, although she could have.<p> <p>    As they sat in the booth, the Senator asked her questions about herself. Ms. Hutton, assuming that Senator Packwood wanted to get to know her, as his Lane County chairperson, talked about herself, and showed him photographs of her children and cats; when she showed him the pictures, he moved closer to her in the booth, shoulder to shoulder.  Ms. Hutton felt a little uncomfortable, but assumed that he had moved over to look at the pictures.  She felt special, because she thought that the Senator was truly interested in getting to know her, as his Lane County chairperson, without everyone else around.<p> <p>    After about twenty minutes to half an hour, it was time to leave, and Senator Packwood offered to walk Ms. Hutton to her car.  When they got to her car, Ms. Hutton unlocked it.  Senator Packwood pulled her toward him, put his arms around her back and kissed her, putting his tongue in her mouth.  Ms. Hutton pushed away from him, and acted as if she were trying to protect him: she told him that it was too dangerous to do that in public, that the press could be anywhere.  She told him to get in her car, and she would drive him to his room, which was at the Red Lion Inn. Senator Packwood got in the car.<p> <p>    As Ms. Hutton drove the Senator to his room, which was across the parking lot and around the corner, he asked her to come to his room with him.  She remembers that he said things to the effect of, "Come into the room with me; do you have to go home so soon; couldn't you come on in; couldn't you just sit and be with me for a while; it won't hurt anything."  She told Senator Packwood that it would look very bad if someone were to see them, that they had a busy day ahead, and that he had been drinking.  Senator Packwood tried a few more times to convince her to come in.  He told her that it was okay, it would be fine. She told him that she thought he was a wonderful man, but that it was wrong for her to come into his room.  Finally, he nodded, said okay, and got out of her car, and she drove away.<p> <p>    Ms. Hutton started to cry as she reached the street.  She felt humiliated, confused, and angry.  She was angry at Senator Packwood for being offensive and inappropriate, and angry at herself for trying to save his feelings at the expense of her own.<p> <p>    Ms. Hutton saw Senator Packwood the next day, when she went to the campaign trailer in the parking lot.  Although no words were spoken about the night before, she and the Senator exchanged a long look when she walked in.<p> <p>    Ms. Hutton continued to work as the Lane County campaign chairperson, and Senator Packwood was friendly and respectful towards her; the incident was never mentioned.  Ms. Hutton describes their relationship as being a little more businesslike after that incident.<p> <p>    Ms. Hutton continued to work for Senator Packwood's campaign through November of 1980.  In 1981, Ms. Hutton asked Senator Packwood to write a letter of recommendation for her, which he did.  When Ms. Hutton was starting a business that did artwork on T-shirts, she sent Senator Packwood a T-shirt, and he wrote her a thank you note.<p> <p>      <H4> 2.   Corroborating Witnesses</H4><p> <p>    The staff interviewed Ms. Hutton's sister and a close personal friend who related that Ms. Hutton told them about the incident in 1980 and 1989, respectively.<p> <p>       <H4>3.   Senator Packwood's Response</H4><p> <p>    Senator Packwood recalled that Ms. Hutton was his Lane County Campaign Chair in 1980, and one of his two principal campaign workers for the next six years. She had made a contribution to his campaign in response to a direct mail piece, and someone on his staff interviewed her to see if she would be interested in working on his campaign.  She attended a campaign volunteer kickoff, a two-day seminar, in January, 1980 in Portland, where Senator Packwood first met her.<p> <p>    Senator Packwood also recalled a meeting that took place at the Roadway hotel in Eugene, Oregon in March, 1980.[fn 89]  Ms. Hutton, a staffer, his administrative assistant, possibly another staffer, and himself, had drinks and dinner.  He did not recall what the group discussed during the several hours they were there, or that Ms. Hutton showed him any photographs.  He did not recall how the group broke up.  He did recall that afterwards, he walked Ms. Hutton to her car and kissed her.  He did not recall what time that was, whether he was drunk at the time, how it was that he came to walk her to her car, or what everyone else did when he left.<p> <p>    He did recall that when they got to Ms. Hutton's car, she got her keys out, turned around, and he kissed her goodnight.  He did not recall if it was a french kiss, or whether he put his arms around her.  Although he did not recall what Ms. Hutton did, he stated that she was "not unreceptive," meaning that she did not push him away and tell him to quit; she did not kiss him back.  He recalled that she got in her car and left, and he walked back to his room.<p> <p>    Senator Packwood stated that the next day was very full. Ms. Hutton was very excited and enthusiastic, and had the crew to lunch at her house.  About 4:00 or 5:00 that afternoon, when it was-time to go on to the next town, they dropped Ms. Hutton off in a parking lot, or somewhere where she had her car. As Ms. Hutton got out of the van, and they all said goodbye, she kissed the Senator on the lips as he stood in the van by the door.  It was not a french kiss, or a passionate kiss, or the kind of a kiss you would have if you were dating someone, but not a peck on the cheek kiss either.[fn 90]<p> <p>    Ms. Hutton was very active in Senator Packwood's 1980 campaign.  He related a specific instance where Ms. Hutton met the traveling crew one evening in Eugene, and they had wine and pizza, and played charades until about 11:00 p.m. He recalled that in 1983 or 1984, Ms. Hutton sent him a T-shirt from her new business; she wanted Elaine Franklin to loan or invest some money in the business.  They kept up a close relationship for six years, and she was active in his 1986 campaign.  Senator Packwood could not recall any other instances where he kissed Ms. Hutton, or she kissed him; he could not recall anything Ms. Hutton ever said or did to lead him to believe that she was interested in a romantic or sexual relationship with him.[fn 91]<p> <p>    Senator Packwood was asked about his statements to the media in January, 1992, where he reportedly acknowledged that he had french kissed Ms. Hutton, and propositioned her or asked her to go to bed.  He stated that he had not said that, that he had only said that he would not challenge her word.  He stated that he wanted the press to accept her claims as true for the sake of argument, but to also consider Ms. Hutton's conduct toward him after the alleged incident. <p> <p>      Senator Packwood was asked about his reported comments to the Albany Rotary Club, that Ms. Hutton had kissed him many times after the alleged incident.  He stated that he only recalled Ms. Hutton kissing him one time, and that he may have overstated this to the Rotary Club.<p> <p>      <H4>4.   Findings</H4><p> <p>    Senate Ethics Counsel finds that the incident as alleged by Ms. Hutton in fact occurred.  Ms. Hutton's account has been corroborated by two persons to whom she related the incident, albeit several years later.  Senator Packwood has also admitted the incident, although his recollection of some details differs from that of Ms. Hutton, and he cannot recall some details, for example, whether he gave her a french kiss.<p> <p>    Senator Packwood has emphasized to the Committee that Ms. Hutton continued to work for his campaign, and kept up a warm and close relationship with him for many years after the incident. He also claimed that after the incident, as Ms. Hutton prepared to part company with the group, she gave him a kiss.  His diary entry for that day also reflects that she hugged and kissed each of the group.  As Senator Packwood appears to admit that the incident took place, it appears that he intends to suggest by this information that Ms. Hutton could not have been offended by his behavior.  Again, the fact that Ms. Hutton continued to work on Senator Packwood's campaigns, and that she kept up a relationship with him, a fact confirmed by Ms. Hutton herself, does not necessarily indicate that Ms. Hutton was not offended by Senator Packwood's conduct.  It just as easily may reflect Ms. Hutton' 8 inability to do anything about the incident, and her recognition of Senator Packwood's position as a United States Senator.<p> <p>    Senator Packwood has also proffered a statement from one John Morrison, indicating that Ms. Hutton acted in such a fashion as to suggest that she was interested in a sexual relationship with the Senator.  However, Senator Packwood himself has testified that Ms. Hutton never did or said anything to suggest that she was interested in a sexual relationship with him. Moreover, such information, even if true, does not establish that the incident did not occur, although it would tend to indicate that she was not offended by his earlier conduct.<p> <p>    Senate Ethics Counsel finds that Senator Packwood's conduct in this instance fits a pattern of conduct that reflects an abuse of his position of authority, a pattern of conduct that constitutes improper conduct reflecting upon the Senate.<p> <p>   <H3> F.   Gillian Butler</H3><p> <p>      <H4>1.   Testimony of Gillian Butler</H4><p> <p>    In January, 1979, Gillian Butler began working as a desk clerk at the Red Lion Inn at 310 Southwest Lincoln Street, Portland, Oregon.  She worked there, either full-time or part- time, until May of 1983.  During those years, Senator Packwood stayed at the Red Lion Inn for several days every few months, with more frequent visits in 1980 during his re-election campaign .<p> <p>     In early 1980, Ms. Butler wrote letters to various Congress persons to protest the reinstatement of the registration for the draft.  She received a response from Senator Packwood's office, addressed to "Mr. Butler."  Not long afterwards, on a Saturday in February, Ms. Butler was working at the front desk when she noticed that Senator Packwood was checking out.  She commented to him to the effect that the next time his office sent her a letter, it should not be addressed to Mr. Butler.  When Senator Packwood asked what she meant, she explained about the response to her letter.  They discussed the draft for about ten minutes, and Senator Packwood left for the airport.  Senator Packwood called her from the airport and told her to write another letter, and he gave her the name of a person to whom the letter should be addressed so that it would get to him personally.  He told her that they would talk about it the next time he visited Portland.<p> <p>    Ms. Butler wrote a second letter to Senator Packwood regarding her concerns about the draft, and left a copy for him at the Red Lion Inn in case he came to Portland before he got the letter in the mail in Washington.  She put her home telephone number in the letter.<p> <p>    About the end of February, 1980, Senator Packwood called Ms. Butler at home about 7:30 a.m.  He told her that he was flying into Portland that night, and he asked her to meet him at 10:00 that evening at the Red Lion Inn, so that they could go to a bar called the Prima Donna across the street, to talk about her letter.  Ms. Butler agreed, although she felt a bit uncomfortable about going to a bar with the Senator that late at night.  She arranged for her boyfriend to show up at the bar about 11:00 so that she would have a ride home.<p> <p>    That evening, Ms. Butler met Senator Packwood as planned, and they went to the Prima Donna.  Ms. Butler and Senator Packwood sat and talked about some of the issues set out in her letter, mostly about international affairs and international aggression.  She recalls that the Senator asked her to dance, and although she thinks that she refused, she may have danced briefly with him. About 11:00, Ms. Butler's boyfriend showed up, and the three of them talked for another 45 minutes.  Ms. Butler's boyfriend and Senator Packwood got into a heated political discussion about international aggression.  Senator Packwood then got up and left.<p> <p>    Sometime later in 1980, Senator Packwood came in one day, she believes on a Sunday, when Ms. Butler was working at the Red Lion Inn.  The Senator asked Ms. Butler to join him in the hotel lounge after she got off work.  She told him that she had plans to meet her boyfriend, but the Senator told her that her boyfriend was also invited.  When Ms. Butler got off work at 11:00, she and her boyfriend went to the lounge, where they saw Senator Packwood sitting at a table with a woman; both of them appeared to be drunk.  Ms. Butler and her boyfriend stood by the table and talked to the couple for about five minutes, and then left.<p> <p>    Later in 1980 or early in 1981, Ms. Butler was working at the Red Lion Inn one morning when Senator Packwood came to the front desk.  She was leaning over some paperwork, checking Senator Packwood out of the hotel.  She looked up, and Senator Packwood suddenly leaned across the desk and kissed her on the mouth. She was surprised, uncomfortable, and embarrassed, and backed away.<p> <p>    Later in 1980 or early in 1981, Senator Packwood came to the front desk one morning at the Red Lion Inn when Ms. Butler was working.  He was leaving and wanted his luggage, which was stored in the closet behind the desk.  Ms. Butler told him that she would get his luggage, and turned around and went to the closet. Senator Packwood walked around the desk and into the closet behind her. When she turned around, he leaned over and kissed her, got his luggage, and left.<p> <p>    After these incidents, Ms. Butler was careful not to be alone behind the desk when the Senator was there; she made sure that there was another clerk behind the desk when she knew the Senator was coming down.<p> <p>      <H4>2.   Corroborating Witnesses</H4><p> <p>       The staff interviewed four persons - Ms. Butler's parents, her sister, and her boyfriend at the time - who confirm that Ms. Butler told them about the incidents, in varying degrees of detail, shortly after they occurred.  Her boyfriend at the time recalls accompanying Ms. Butler to the hotel bar to meet Senator Packwood, where they found him in a booth, intoxicated, with a woman. They stayed for a few minutes to talk, and left.<p> <p>     Another friend of Ms. Butler's, who ran as a Socialist Workers Party write-in candidate against Senator Packwood in 1980, stated that, shortly after the incidents happened, Ms. Butler told him about two occasions when Senator Packwood kissed her while she was working at the Red Lion Inn.  She also told him that Senator Packwood had asked her out for drinks several times. On one occasion, Ms. Butler called him to tell him that she was going to meet Senator Packwood at a bar, and that unbeknownst to Senator Packwood, she was bringing her boyfriend along; he learned from Ms. Butler later that they had talked about military spending and policy.<p> <p> <H4>3.   Senator Packwood's Response</H4><p> <p>     Senator Packwood recalled Ms. Butler as a desk clerk at the Red Lion Inn, where he stayed in Portland.  They chatted when he checked in and out; she was anti-war, anti-draft, and anti-military.  He recalled discussing a letter with her, in which she said that he should feel free to call her at home, which he did. He suggested that Ms. Butler meet with him to talk about the letter.  He recalled that he met with her only once, at the bar in the motel.  The Senator was with someone, and Ms. Butler came with her boyfriend.  They chatted awhile; he believed that Ms. Butler and her boyfriend remained standing.<p> <p>     Senator Packwood did not recall any other meetings or contacts with Ms. Butler.  He stated that it would have been difficult for him to lean over the counter and kiss her, because the counter is about four feet high and three feet wide.<p> <p> <H4>4.   Findings</H4><p> <p>     Senate Ethics Counsel finds that the incidents as alleged by Ms. Butler in fact occurred.  Senator Packwood recalled Ms. Butler, but he did not recall the incidents themselves.  Senator Packwood has offered no evidence, other than his claim that it would be difficult to lean over the counter as described by Ms. Butler, to refute these allegations, nor has the Committee uncovered any such evidence.  The claims are corroborated by the persons to whom Ms. Butler spoke at the time of or shortly after the incidents, and who, in the case of her then-boyfriend, participated in some of the events leading up to the incidents.<p> <p>     Senate Ethics Counsel finds that Senator Packwood's conduct in this instance fits a pattern of conduct that reflects an abuse of his position of authority, a pattern of conduct that constitutes improper conduct reflecting upon the Senate.<p> <p>     <H3>G.   Packwood Staff Member [fn 92]</H3><p> <p>           <H4>1.   Testimony of Staff Member</H4><p> <p>     This individual worked on Senator Packwood's personal staff from September of 1978 through August of 1979, when she returned to school.  She then worked for the Senate Commerce Committee, where Senator Packwood was the ranking minority member, from June, 1980 through August, 1980.<p> <p>      One day in May of 1979, when the staffer was in Senator Packwood's office with a number of other staffers, he leaned over and told her in effect that he would like to see her playing softball in the dress she was wearing, bending over, or moving in certain positions, so that he could see her figure.  He made comments about how the dress fit her, and how she would look playing softball or pitching if she were wearing the dress, and said that he would like to be there to watch her move.<p> <p>     Sometime later, when the staffer was on the Committee staff, one evening six or seven of the staff, and Senator Packwood, went to a restaurant for pizza and beer.  While they all sat around a table, Senator Packwood put his arm around the staffer, drew her very close, and told her he knew that he could persuade her to be a Republican.  He kept his arm around her most of the evening.<p> <p>     These instances with the Senator made the staffer very uncomfortable about being in a position where something similar might happen again.  She wanted to avoid Senator Packwood, but at the same time, she wanted to have her work recognized by him.<p> <p>     One evening in the early summer of 1980, the staffer was working in the Senator's office, and she realized she would be the last staff member working in the office.[fn 93] She was apprehensive about what might happen, given the other instances that had occurred, and she wanted an excuse to leave the office. About 7:00 or 7:30, she called a friend and asked him to drive over and come upstairs to the offices to get her.  After making the phone call, the staffer walked back into the Senator's office.  He came around his desk, and either rubbed her back or put his arm around her.  He then grabbed her shoulders, and tried to push her down on the couch.  He kissed her on the lips. She tried to get up, and he pushed her down again; this happened three times, maybe more.  She tried to push him away, and told him to leave her alone, not to touch her, and that she had a friend coming to pick her up.<p> <p>     As the staffer struggled with Senator Packwood, her friend arrived at the office and began calling her name.  The staffer was able to get away from the Senator, and locate her friend, whom she introduced to the Senator as her boyfriend.[fn 94] The staffer and her friend then left the office.  The staffer was upset and crying, and spent some time walking around the Capitol with her friend, whom she told what had happened before he took her home.<p> <p>     After that, the staffer avoided the Senator  like the plague."  She left the office at the end of August.<p> <p>           <H4>2.   Corroborating Witnesses</H4><p> <p>     In his deposition, the friend whom the staffer called the evening of the incident in Senator Packwood's office confirms that she called him to pick her up from work one evening, that she was upset and crying, and that she told him that Senator Packwood had been making advances or passes at her, and that it was not the first time it had happened.[fn 95]<p> <p>    <H4>3.   Senator Packwood's  Response</H4><p> <p>     Senator Packwood did not recall the staffer, or the incidents that she alleges occurred.<p> <p>     <H4>4.   Findings</H4><p> <p>     Senate Ethics Counsel finds that the incident as alleged by the staff member in fact occurred.  Senator Packwood has testified that he does not recall the incident.  The staff member's allegations have been corroborated by the friend whom she called to pick her up on the evening that the incident occurred.  Senator Packwood has offered no evidence, nor has the Committee found any, that would tend to refute the allegation by the staff member.<p> <p>     Senate Ethics Counsel finds that Senator Packwood's conduct in this instance fits a pattern of conduct that reflects an abuse of his position of authority, a pattern of conduct that constitutes improper conduct reflecting upon the Senate.<p> <p>     <H3>H.   Senate Staff Member [fn 96]</H3><p> <p>       <H4>1.   Testimony of Staff Member</H4><p> <p>     In 1979, this individual worked for another Senator, in an office on the first floor of the Dirksen Building, Room 1200. The office was only one room, in which six to seven persons worked.  A corner of the room, in the front to the right of the door, was partitioned by a cubicle; the staff member sat at a desk in this cubicle.  The office was located around the corner from the Senate elevators, and at the corner of the building, near an outside entrance.  It was an interior office with no windows, and the door was customarily kept open. Senators often passed by on their way to the subway or across the street to vote.<p> <p>     Senator Packwood passed by frequently, and at some point got in the habit of stopping in the office to chat with the staff member.  She was friendly to Senator Packwood when he dropped in their conversation was superficial, in the nature of  Hello, how are you, are you having a good day,- etc.  The staff member cannot remember Senator Packwood talking with anyone else in the office other than her when he came in.<p> <p>     It was not uncommon for the staff member to be in her office alone after the rest of the staff had gone home for the evening. She was often at the office until 6:00 or 7:00 p.m., alone, catching up on the mail.  One evening, as best as she can recall, in 1979, possibly in the spring, the staff member was working late, alone in the office.  She was sitting at her desk proofing mail, with mail in her lap and her feet up on the feet of the swivel chair, leaning back comfortably.  Senator Packwood came in the office, and stood three or four feet away, chatting.  All of a sudden, he lunged down, kissed her on the lips, and turned around and left without saying a word.  She stated that the kiss was not a french kiss. but it was a full kiss on the mouth. It was not like a kiss from a grandfather, nor was it a romantic kiss.  The staff member described the kiss as unwanted, and stated that she felt violated by Senator Packwood approaching her in that manner.<p> <p>     The staff member did not notice any odor of alcohol about Senator Packwood. She does not have a specific recollection of Senator Packwood placing his hands on her shoulders or on the chair, but she states that he would have had to brace his arms either on her shoulders or on the chair in order to be able to push himself away from her.<p> <p>     After that, the staff member started closing the office door.  Senator Packwood did not stop by the office anymore, nor did he speak to her.<p> <p>    <H4> 2.   Corroborating Witnesses</H4><p> <p>     Two witnesses, the staff member's boyfriend and a friend from the Senate, both recalled that, sometime after the allegations became public, the staff member told them that Senator Packwood had come into her office and kissed her.<p> <p>     <H4>3.   Senator Packwood's Response</H4><p> <p>     Senator Packwood could not recall the staff member, or the incident that she alleges occurred.<p> <p>    <H4>4.   Findings</H4><p> <p>     Senate Ethics Counsel finds that the incident as alleged by the staff member in fact occurred.  Senator Packwood did not recall the incident; he has not offered, nor has the Committee uncovered, any evidence tending to refute the staff member's allegation.<p> <p>     Senate Ethics Counsel finds that Senator Packwood's conduct in this instance fits a pattern of conduct that reflects an abuse of his position of authority, a pattern of conduct that constitutes improper conduct reflecting upon the Senate.<p> <p>     <H3>I.   Kerry Whitney</H3><p> <p>         <H4>1.   Testimony of Kerry Whitney</H4><p> <p>     Ms. Whitney worked for the Senate in Washington, D.C. from approximately September, 1976 through October, 1978, as a part time elevator operator on the Senate side of the Capitol, running the elevators from 8:00 a.m. until 1:00 p.m., unless there were scheduled sessions that started earlier, in which case she started work earlier.  The rest of the day, she worked in a Senator's office.  Her job as an elevator operator involved standing by her assigned elevator and transporting passengers to their requested floor.  For the first nine months, she was assigned to operate one of the elevators available for use by the public; the last two of those months she was assigned to the public elevator that also served as the alternate Senators' only elevator.  She was then assigned to the Senators' only elevator, which she operated for eight months, and then to the Senators' only elevator which went to the Senate dining room.  She remained there until she left her job.<p> <p>     Ms. Whitney first came to know Senator Packwood when she was assigned to operate the alternate Senators  elevator in approximately April 1977.  He was always friendly and attentive, and expressed an interest in her as a person, asking her questions about herself, and remembering her name.  Ms. Whitney was flattered by this attention from a U.S. Senator.  For about the first few months after she met Senator Packwood, her interaction with him was limited to friendly conversation on the elevator.<p> <p>       Sometime during June or July, 1977, after she had been assigned to operate the Senators' only elevator in the main corridor, Senator Packwood entered the elevator, and greeted her by name.  As soon as the doors closed, he suddenly cocked his head to the side, and said "kiss."  He grabbed her by the shoulders, pushed her back to the side wall of the elevator, and started kissing her on the lips.  He stopped as the elevator came to a halt.  After that, Senator Packwood grabbed and kissed her most of the times when he was alone with her on the elevator. Frequently he would precede the kiss by cocking his head and saying "kiss" before he grabbed her.<p> <p>     Some time in late July, 1977, Senator Packwood asked Ms. Whitney where she lived, and for her telephone number, saying he might like to come over some evening.  She gave him the information, thinking that if she had the opportunity to talk with him, she could get him to stop the kissing and have just a friendly relationship.  One evening in early August, 1977, Senator Packwood called Ms. Whitney at home about 9:30 p.m. and asked if he could come over.  Ms. Whitney was surprised, but also flattered.  Because her roommate and a Russian friend of hers were also home, she said yes.  Senator Packwood arrived a short time later, knocked on the door, and she let him into the vestibule.  He appeared to her nervous, and she smelled alcohol on his breath. Senator Packwood heard voices from the living room, asked who it was, and backed away from the entrance into the living room.  When Ms. Whitney told him it was her roommate and a Russian student, he said  a Russian" and jumped behind the door to the living room.  He then walked into the living room and introduced himself.<p> <p>     Senator Packwood asked Ms. Whitney what she had to drink. She went to the kitchen; he followed her.  She gave the Senator a beer.  He put his beer on the counter, put his arms around her and began kissing her.  She put her hands on his chest, pushed him away, and said, wait a minute, what do you want from me? He stated that he wanted two things from her:  to make love to her and to hear what she heard in her job, as she heard a lot of things.  Ms. Whitney was stunned, and asked him if he weren't married.  He responded that he was, and he loved his wife very much.  Ms. Whitney told him that she was not interested in having sex with him.<p> <p>     Senator Packwood then suggested that they sit down somewhere.  They went to the back yard, and sat around a table for about thirty minutes while Senator Packwood drank his beer. Ms. Whitney does not recall much of the conversation, other than the Senator saying that they had a special relationship that they would have forever, and they were obviously attracted to each other.  He indicated that he had a campaign coming up, giving Ms. Whitney the impression that he was dangling the opportunity to work in his campaign in front of her.<p> <p>     It began to rain, so they went back into the house.  Ms. Whitney's roommate and her friend had left.  Ms. Whitney and Senator Packwood went into the living room and sat on the couch, where the Senator again began trying to kiss her, and repeatedly asked to spend the night.  Ms. Whitney kept pushing him away, and declining his invitation to have sex, saying that they should just talk. She finally got up from the couch, and told him he had to leave.  He continued to beg her to let him spend the night, saying that he had nowhere to go.  She suggested that he go home; he told her it was too far away.  She then told him to go to his secretary's house, as she understood he sometimes stayed there. He rejected that suggestion.  She finally told him he would have to sleep in his office.  Eventually, she was able to lead him out the door by his arm.<p> <p>     About five minutes later, she heard a loud banging on the door, which lasted about three minutes.  She did not answer the door, as she believed it was the Senator.  About ten minutes later, the phone rang.  It was Senator Packwood, who asked why she had not answered the door; she told him she was getting ready for bed.  He again begged her to please let him spend the night, and she again refused.  She saw him again the next morning at 7:00 a.m. by the elevators, and he told her he had slept on the couch in his office.<p> <p>     After the incident at her house, Senator Packwood continued to grab and kiss her when they were alone in the elevator. Sometime in late August or early September, 1977, after a kissing episode, she told Senator Packwood that his touching was getting in the way, and asked if they could go somewhere public and talk about it.  He told her that he could not do that because he was married.<p> <p>     In early September, 1977, Senator Packwood called her house again.  Ms. Whitney was not home and her roommate answered the phone.  Senator Packwood told her roommate that it was too bad Ms. Whitney was not home, that he wanted her to get a hamburger with him.  He then asked the roommate if she wanted to go; she declined.<p> <p>     After the second phone call, the grabbing and kissing episodes on the elevator became less frequent, and eventually ceased in late fall.  In February, 1978, Ms. Whitney was reassigned to the Senators' only back elevator which leads to the Senate dining room, and she did not see Senator Packwood very much after that.  She does not have any recollection of Senator Packwood grabbing and kissing her during the time she ran the dining room elevator.<p> <p>      <H4>2.   Corroborating Witnesses</H4><p> <p>     The staff has interviewed four witnesses who corroborate portions of Ms. Whitney's allegations.  Her roommate at the time, who is married to Ms. Whitney's brother, confirms that Ms. Whitney told her that Senator Packwood had kissed her numerous times in the elevator.  She also recalls the evening that Senator Packwood came over to their apartment; she recalls that she had a Russian student visiting, and that after Senator Packwood greeted them, he and Ms. Whitney went into the kitchen.  She recalls, however, that she and the Russian student were still in the living room when Senator Packwood left about an hour later.  She also recalls that some time later, Senator Packwood called one evening for Ms. Whitney, and when he learned that she was not at home, he invited her out for dinner; she declined.<p> <p>     A staffer who worked with Ms. Whitney in the Senator's office at the time also recalls that Ms. Whitney told her that Senator Packwood had made passes at her a number of times when he was alone on the elevator with her, and that he had come over to her house.<p> <p>     Ms. Whitney's brother also recalled that while she worked in the Senate, Ms. Whitney told him that Senator Packwood had tried to kiss her on the elevator more than once, and that he had showed up at her apartment and wanted her to go out.<p> <p>     A roommate of Ms. Whitney's in 1978, after she left the Senate, recalled that Ms. Whitney told her that Senator Packwood had pinned her and kissed her in the elevator, and that he had come to her house and asked her for a date; he jumped on her, and later pounded on her door and called her on the telephone.<p> <p>      <H4>3.   Senator Packwood's Response</H4><p> <p>     Senator Packwood did not recall Ms. Whitney or the incidents she alleges occurred.  He did not recall ever kissing or propositioning any Senate elevator operator.<p> <p>     <H4>4.   Findings</H4><p> <p>     Senate Ethics Counsel finds that the incidents as alleged by Ms. Whitney in fact occurred.  Ms. Whitney's allegations have been corroborated by the persons to whom she described the incidents after they occurred, including her roommate at the time, who personally observed Senator Packwood when he came to their apartment, and who talked to him when he called to ask Ms. Whitney to dinner. Senator Packwood has not denied the incidents, except to state that he does not recall ever kissing a Senate elevator operator; he has no recollection of the incidents described by Ms. Whitney.  Senator Packwood has offered no evidence, nor has the Committee uncovered any, that tends to refute the allegations of Ms. Whitney.<p> <p>     Senate Ethics Counsel finds that Senator Packwood's conduct in this instance fits a pattern of conduct that reflects an abuse of his position of authority, a pattern of conduct that constitutes improper conduct reflecting upon the Senate.<p> <p>     <H3>J.   Jean McMahon</H3><p> <p>       <H4>1.   Testimony of Jean McMahon</H4><p> <p>     In 1976 or 1977, Jean McMahon heard that Senator Packwood's staff office in Portland was looking for additional staff members.  She was interested in moving to Portland, so she called Senator Packwood's office to see if she could get an appointment to talk about a job.  Within several days, Senator Packwood called her, and told her that he would like to meet her and possibly get some writing samples from her.  She understood from the conversation that Senator Packwood was looking for a speech writer.  They made an appointment for an interview at a motel in Salem.  Ms. McMahon thought it odd that the appointment was at a motel, but assumed that the motel was a convenient place for a traveling U.S. senator.<p> <p>     Ms. McMahon met Senator Packwood at the motel as arranged, and spoke with him for about an hour.  She was attempting to get acquainted with the Senator, and to get information from which she could prepare a draft of a speech for him, so that he could see what her writing style was like.<p> <p>     Over the next few weeks, Ms. McMahon prepared a draft of a speech, and talked to Senator Packwood by telephone several times about different points in the speech.  Eventually, they agreed to meet again at the Dorchester Conference, a well-known event among Republicans in Oregon.  Ms. McMahon took her drafts, and drove from Salem to the coast, where the Dorchester Conference was taking place.  Senator Packwood had given her the address of a motel, with a room number.  Ms. McMahon knocked on the door of the room, and Senator Packwood answered; he was the only person in the room.  She and the Senator sat at an oval table in a sitting room area.  Ms. McMahon had her draft speech with her, and she brought it out, gave the Senator a copy of it, and began talking about it.  Within about five minutes, it became obvious to her that the Senator was not at all interested in her speech. The Senator got up quickly from the table, and moved around toward her.  She became alarmed, got up, and started to go around the edge of the table, in order to put distance between herself and the Senator.  Senator Packwood started moving faster, grabbed her by the shoulders, and pulled her up to him and kissed her. She pulled away, and quickly left the room.<p> <p>     It took a few days for Ms. McMahon to realize that Senator Packwood was not at all serious about hiring her as a speech writer.  She called his office in Portland, to tell them that she had a draft speech for the Senator, thinking that someone on the staff was waiting for it.  She told someone at the office that she had the draft speech ready for the Senator, and she needed to know what to do with it.  The reaction from the staff at the Portland office was that they had never heard of any speech, and they did not care what happened to the draft she had prepared. Ms. McMahon never spoke to Senator Packwood again.<p> <p>      <H4>2.   Corroborating Witnesses</H4><p> <p>     The staff deposed six witnesses who learned about this incident, in varying detail, from Ms. McMahon in the late 1970's. Her husband (they were dating at the time) recalled receiving a phone call from Ms. McMahon after the incident; he knew she had gone to deliver a speech to Senator Packwood.  Ms. McMahon told him that Senator Packwood had come on to her, and she had to leave.  Four close friends of Ms. McMahon's also confirmed that she told them about the incident, and the fact that she had been led to believe that there was a job opening for a speechwriter. Ms. McMahon's friends indicated that she seemed to be excited about the prospect of the job, and had taken work for Senator Packwood to review.  However, Senator Packwood appeared to have no interest in her work, and used the opportunity to make an unwanted physical advance upon her.  Three of these witnesses recalled that Ms. McMahon told them that Senator Packwood chased her around a table, or around the room, in his hotel room.<p> <p>      <H4>3.   Senator Packwood's Response</H4><p> <p>     Senator Packwood did not recall Ms. McMahon, or the incident that she described.  He stated that it would be unusual for him to consider a person for a job as a speech writer, as he has never used one.  He writes his own speeches, except for formal floor speeches on subjects with which he is not familiar, which he has written for him by staff members.<p> <p>     There is an entry in Senator Packwood's diary for February 16, 1977, indicating that he met with Ms. McMahon, and that they might want to use her as a writer. [fn 97] After his first deposition, Senator Packwood provided the Committee with a draft of a speech that Ms. McMahon had worked on for the Senator.  He testified at his second deposition that he still had no recollection of Ms. McMahon, but the speech appeared to be one that he gave her to edit, probably to see if she would be able to write for him.  He stated that looking at the speech, and the edits, Ms. McMahon probably talked to him about the speech, but he had no recollection of that.<p> <p>     Senator Packwood testified that according to news statements, Ms. McMahon had stated that she phoned his office after the incident to see if she had gotten the job.<p> <p>     <H4>4.   Findings</H4><p> <p>     Senate Ethics Counsel finds that the incident as alleged by Ms. McMahon in fact occurred.  Ms. McMahon's account is corroborated by the persons to whom she described the incident shortly after it occurred.  Several details of her testimony are corroborated by Senator Packwood's own records - her first meeting with him is reflected in both his diary and his calendar of events, and the fact that he was considering her for a position involving speechwriting is confirmed by the speech she critiqued for him.<p> <p>     Senator Packwood has not denied the incident; he has testified that he has no recollection of it.  He did emphasize in his deposition that Ms. McMahon was still interested in working for him, as she had apparently called his office after the incident to inquire about the job, as if to suggest either that the incident did not occur, or that she could not have been offended by it if she still wanted to work for him.  The fact that Ms. McMahon may have called to inquire about the job after the incident, even if true, does not cast any doubt on Ms. McMahon's allegation.  If true, it may just as easily indicate that she was willing to overlook the incident because she needed a job.<p> <p>     Senate Ethics Counsel finds that Senator Packwood's conduct in this instance fits a pattern of conduct that reflects an abuse of his position of authority, a pattern of conduct that constitutes improper conduct reflecting upon the Senate.<p> <p>     <H3>K.   Packwood Staff Member [fn 98]</H3><p> <p>        <H4>1.   Staff Member's Testimony</H4><p> <p>     This individual worked for Senator Packwood from March, 1972 through April, 1975 in Washington, D.C., as a staff assistant. One evening, when the staff member was at a bar with her husband and a friend, a staffer for another Senator staff apparently overheard the staff member talking about Senator Packwood, saying that he drank too much, and had to have somebody drive him because of his drinking.  The next day, Senator Packwood called her into his office and confronted her with this information. The staff member, worried about losing her job, denied that she had been talking about Senator Packwood, and claimed that she had been talking instead about her former boss.  Senator Packwood told her that he did not think that she would say anything about him, got up from behind his desk, and came around and kissed her on the cheek.  The staff member described the kiss as inappropriate, but without sexual overtones. She was relieved that she had not lost her job.<p> <p>     Sometime after this incident, during the spring of 1975, the staff member began riding to work with her husband, whose job required him to be in his office early.  Consequently, the staff member would arrive at the office at about 7:00 or 7:30 a.m.; she usually was the first one in to work.  At some point, Senator Packwood started coming in to the office early as well, and he and the staff member would chat in the mornings in the office she shared with another staff member.  One morning in April, 1975, as the staff member stood in her office, engaging in small talk with Senator Packwood, he grabbed her firmly with both arms around her shoulders, held her tightly, pressing his body into hers, and kissed her on the mouth.  She describes the kiss as that of somebody who wanted to be involved or passionate.  She pushed him away, and told him to get off of her, that she was a happily married woman.  Senator Packwood appeared bewildered, told her that he was sorry, and left the room.<p> <p>     The staff member quit her job, because she felt that after the incident involving the kiss in her office, every time she was around the Senator, he was looking at her, and it made her uncomfortable.<p> <p>      <H4>2.   Corroborating Witnesses</H4><p> <p>     The staff has interviewed one witness, the staff member's aunt, who worked on the Hill at the time, who confirmed that the staff member told her that she had to leave Senator Packwood's employment, because she was afraid to be alone in the office with him.  The staff member told this witness that Senator Packwood had kissed her.<p> <p>     The staff member's husband recalled that she told him, eighteen or nineteen years ago, while she worked for Senator Packwood, that someone had overheard a conversation among himself, his wife, and a friend about Senator Packwood's womanizing which they had reported to Senator Packwood.  Senator Packwood questioned the staff member about it, and she denied having said anything. Senator Packwood seemed satisfied, and gave her a "wet" kiss on the lips. Sometime later, Senator Packwood and the staff member were in the office early, and he grabbed her and kissed her.  At the time, her husband was an officer with the Metropolitan Police Department.  He was upset when his wife told him about these incidents, but he was worried that it could cause trouble for him or his wife if he mentioned anything about the incidents.  Had it been anyone but a Senator, he would have confronted the person about the incidents.<p> <p>       <H4>3.   Senator Packwood's Response</H4><p> <p>     Senator Packwood did not recall the staff member or the incident that she alleges occurred.<p> <p>       <H4>4.   Findings</H4><p> <p>     Senate Ethics Counsel finds that the incident as alleged by the staff member in fact occurred.  Two witnesses have confirmed that the staff member told them about the incident shortly after it occurred.  Senator Packwood has not denied the incident; he has testified that he did not recall it.  Senator Packwood has not offered, nor has the Committee uncovered, any evidence tending to refute the staff member's allegations.<p> <p>     Senate Ethics Counsel finds that Senator Packwood's conduct in this instance fits a pattern of conduct that reflects an abuse of his position of authority, a pattern of conduct that constitutes improper conduct reflecting upon the Senate.<p> <p>     <H3>L.   Packwood Staff Member [fn 99]</H3><p> <p>        <H4>1.   Testimony of Staff Member</H4><p> <p>     This individual worked for Senator Packwood in the early 1970's as a caseworker in his Senate office in Portland. Sometime in the early 1970's, she was at work alone in one of the office rooms late one night.  She testified that she had been drinking, and it was possible that she had gone out after work with some of the other staff and come back to the office.  She was just finishing a telephone call when Senator Packwood came in, and chased her around the desk several times.  She does not remember Senator Packwood saying anything to her, and she does not think that he actually touched her.  She thinks that she was already standing when Senator Packwood came into the room, but she cannot remember what he did that made her suspicious and made her try to get away from him; she believes that he must have said something to her, although she does not remember that.  At the time, she thought that all he was going to do was to kiss her. She remembers that he chased her, and that she went around the desk several times.  She was so upset that she left the office without her purse and coat.  The staff member continued to work in Senator Packwood's office for a short time after that incident.<p> <p>        <H4>2.   Corroborating Witnesses</H4><p> <p>     The staff member provided the names of two persons whom she told about the incident.  The staff was not able to contact either person.<p> <p> <p>        <H4>3.   Senator Packwood's Response</H4><p> <p>     Senator Packwood did not recall either the staff member, or the incident that she alleges occurred.<p> <p>        4<H4>.   Findings</H4><p> <p>     Senate Ethics Counsel finds that the incident as alleged by the staff member in fact occurred.

Gail Byler</H3><p> <p> <H4>1.   Testimony of Gail Byler</H4><p> <p>     In 1970, Gail Byler worked as the dining room hostess at the Ramada Inn, which had opened in February, 1970 at 4th and Lincoln in Portland, Oregon.  It is now a Red Lion Inn.  One evening in March, April, or May of 1970, she was sitting at the hostess desk working on paperwork after the dining room had closed for the evening.  The dining room was dark except for a light that was on over the area where she was working.  The dining room itself was open to the lobby area, and was separated from the lounge by a screen.<p> <p>     Ms. Byler got up from her station to get a glass of ice water from the waitress station, which was in a hallway off the dining room, fairly close to the entrance to the dining room from the lobby.  She had her back to the dining room.  All of a sudden, she felt a hand go from her ankle, up the inside of her leg, to her crotch.  She turned around quickly, and saw Senator Packwood behind her, leaning against a doorway.  She stepped back, and told him to stay away from her, and not to touch her. He said, "Do you know who I am?"  Ms. Byler told him that she knew who he was, she didn't care, and for him to stay away from her.  He told her that she had not heard the end of it, and walked out of the dining room.<p> <p>      <H4>2.   Corroborating Witnesses</H4><p> <p>     Ms. Byler's minister provided an affidavit to the Committee. Ms. Byler has been a parishioner and a friend of his for a number of years.<p> <p>     The minister stated that shortly before the death of Ms. Byler's husband about three years ago, he was at their home, and he and her husband were teasing Ms. Byler about all of the men who would be chasing after her when her husband died.  Ms. Byler told them, in effect, that she had been pursued by loftier men than the two of them.  She then told them that years earlier, when she was working as the dining room manager at the Ramada Inn, she had been going over the waitress slips in the diningroom after it had closed down.  She stepped into a waitress station for a glass of water, and Senator Packwood came up behind her, and ran his hands from her legs to her waist.  He appeared to her to have been drinking.  She told him in no uncertain terms to get away from her, and to leave her alone.<p> <p>     After stories appeared in the newspapers about allegations of misconduct by Senator Packwood, the minister reminded Ms. Byler of their conversation several years earlier.  Ms. Byler was reluctant to go forward or make any kind of statement about what had happened to her.  Although the minister felt that Senator Packwood had done good things as a Senator, he also felt that it was important for this information to become public.  He encouraged Ms. Byler to go forward, and to make a statement about the incident.<p> <p>      <H4>3.   Senator Packwood's Response</H4><p> <p>     Senator Packwood did not recall Ms. Byler, or the incident that she alleges occurred.<p> <p>      <H4>4.   Findings </H4><p> <p>     Senate Ethics Counsel finds that this incident as alleged by Ms. Byler in fact occurred.  Senator Packwood does not recall this incident.  No evidence has been offered by Senator Packwood or obtained by the Committee to refute Ms. Byler's claim, and it is corroborated by her minister, to whom she recounted the incident after it occurred.<p> <p>     Senate Ethics Counsel finds that Senator Packwood's conduct in this instance fits a pattern of conduct that reflects an abuse of his position of authority, a pattern of conduct that constitutes improper conduct reflecting upon the Senate.<p> <p>     <H3>N.   Packwood Staff Member [fn 100]</H3><p> <p>        <H4>1.   Testimony of Staff Member</H4><p> <p>     This individual worked for Senator Packwood for about six months from April to October, 1970.  She worked at a desk in the front office.  One afternoon, after 5:00, she was sitting at her desk when Senator Packwood walked over, grabbed her by the shoulders, and kissed her on the mouth.  It was not a french kiss, but it was a sexual kiss, the type that a boyfriend would give to a girlfriend.  She believes that she pushed Senator Packwood away, and tried to make a joke out of it.  He walked away, and the incident did not happen again.<p> <p>       <H4> 2.

Sharon Grant</H3><p> <p>         <H4>1.   Testimony of Sharon Grant</H4><p> <p>      In early 1969, sometime in the spring, Sharon Grant met Senator Packwood at a reception on Capitol Hill, and she talked with him about the possibility of working for his office or one of his committees.  Senator Packwood told her to come by and see him to discuss this possibility further.<p> <p>     Within a week or two, Ms. Grant called someone in Senator Packwood's office to set up an appointment to talk to him.  She went to Senator Packwood's office toward the end of a working day, and met with the Senator in his office for about 45 minutes. Ms. Grant talked with the Senator about herself, her work experience and interests, and job possibilities.  Senator Packwood indicated to her that she should consider filling out an application with his staff people. Toward the end of the meeting, Senator Packwood suggested to Ms. Grant that they go and have a drink, and asked her, how about spending the evening with me?  Ms. Grant picked up a tone of voice, or a loaded quality to the Senator's comments, that caused her to interpret his request as a proposition for her to spend the night with him.  She told him that she did not think that was appropriate, that it was time for her to go, and she left.  She did not pursue a job possibility any further.<p> <p>       <H4>2.   Corroborating Witnesses</H4><p> <p>     There were no witnesses located who could corroborate Ms. Grant's testimony.<p> <p>       <H4>3.

Gayle Rothrock</H3><p> <p>         <H4>1.   Testimony of Gayle Rothrock</H4><p> <p>     Gayle Rothrock worked for another Senator from December, 1968 until September of 1970.  During that time, she became acquainted with Senator Packwood by virtue of her visits to his office on business, or to say hello to acquaintances who worked there.<p> <p>     In early spring of 1969, probably early April, Ms. Rothrock was visiting friends in Senator Packwood's office.  Mrs. Packwood was there, and Ms. Rothrock heard her say that she needed a babysitter for one of the next few evenings for their two preschool children.  Ms. Rothrock volunteered to babysit, and on the evening in question, the Packwoods picked her up after work and took her to their home.  She took care of the children for the evening while the Packwoods attended an event.  When the Senator and his wife returned about 11:00 p.m., they paid her for babysitting, and Mrs. Packwood told her that the Senator would run her home. <p> <p>     As Ms. Rothrock was reaching for her coat from an area close to the front door, Senator Packwood grabbed her shoulders and back with both of his hands, rubbed and massaged her shoulders and back, and gave her a sloppy, forceful, wet and insistent kiss on the mouth.  Ms. Rothrock pushed him away with her hands, retrieved her coat, and started talking about Northwest issues, what a nice family he had and how attractive the children were, how she hoped that his days in Washington were going to be good ones, and that he was off to a good start.<p> <p>     Although Ms. Rothrock detected a slight odor of alcohol about Senator Packwood, and the Packwoods had told her they had been to a party where there were drinks and hors d'oeuvres, neither of the Packwoods displayed signs of drunkenness.<p> <p>     Ms. Rothrock sat in the front seat during the ride to her apartment.  As he started the car engine, and before he pulled away from the curb, Senator Packwood reached over and put his right arm around Ms. Rothrock's shoulders. He then touched her left leg just above the knee.  Ms. Rothrock pushed back against the right side of the car, and continued to talk about issues and family.  The Senator drove her to her apartment, where he dropped her off.<p> <p>     After this incident, Ms. Rothrock did not babysit again for the Packwoods, and she took care not to place herself in a position where she would be alone with Senator Packwood.<p> <p>      <H4> 2.   Corroborating Witnesses</H4><p> <p>     The staff has obtained affidavits from two witnesses, Ms. Rothrock's mother, and her roommate at the time, who stated that Ms. Rothrock told them that Senator Packwood had kissed her, or made an advance, while she was babysitting for the Senator's children.  Ms. Rothrock' 8 mother recalls that her daughter told her that she had babysat for the Packwoods, and that he had given her a kiss on the porch; she was upset by the incident.  Her roommate recalls that she told her either that evening or the next day that the Senator had made passes involving inappropriate touching or kissing, either at his house, or in the car on the way home.  Another witness recalled that in the spring or summer of 1992, but before the allegations became public, Ms. Rothrock told her that Senator Packwood had grabbed her and made an advance to her after she babysat for him.  Georgie Packwood recalled that Ms. Rothrock babysat for them at least once, but that at the time, they had only one child. She could not recall any details, but believed that at the time that Ms. Rothrock babysat for them, the Senator's eyesight was still good enough that he would drive their babysitters home.<p> <p>     <H4>  3.   Senator Packwood's Response</H4><p> <p>     Senator Packwood remembered Ms. Rothrock as a friend of persons in his office; she was in his office frequently to visit. He vaguely recalled that she might have applied for a job in his office.<p> <p>     Senator Packwood recalled that Ms. Rothrock babysat at least once for him and his wife, although because she made reference to babysitting for two children, it would have had to happen after 1971, when they adopted their second child.  He could not recall if she babysat for them more than once. With respect to the one instance that he recalled, the Senator did not remember the event that he and his wife attended, how Ms. Rothrock got to their house, or when he and his wife returned home.  He did recall that while his wife waited in the car to take Ms. Rothrock home, he went inside the house.  Ms. Rothrock had her shoes off, and she could not find them.  He helped her look for them; he did not remember where they found them.  He stated that he then put his arms around Ms. Rothrock and gave her a kiss, and she put her arms around his neck and kissed him very "fulsomely."  He did not recall where in his house that this took place.  He described the kiss as romantic, although he could not recall if it was a french kiss; he said that she responded in kind - she put her arms around him, held her lips to his, and made no effort to get away. He did not recall if they had any conversation.  Nor did he recall if this was the first time he had kissed Ms. Rothrock in this fashion.  He could not recall that Ms. Rothrock had ever given him any indication that she would be interested in this sort of a kiss, or what prompted him to kiss her that evening, nor did he recall speaking to her afterwards about the kiss. Senator Packwood saw Ms. Rothrock at a wedding in 1982.  In the mid-1970's, they also arranged to have dinner together in Seattle or Tacoma as he passed through on his way to Portland, but they had to cancel.<p>  <p>        <H4>4.   Findings</H4><p> <p>     Senate Ethics Counsel finds that the incident as alleged by Ms. Rothrock in fact occurred.  Although her recollection of the number of children she babysat may be inaccurate, her account is corroborated by three witnesses to whom she related the incident, two of whom she told shortly after it occurred.  Senator Packwood testified that he recalled kissing Ms. Rothrock after she babysat for.him and his wife, although he portrays Ms. Rothrock as a willing participant; he also testified that he did not drive her home.  However, both Ms. Rothrock's mother and her roommate at the time recall her distress at the incident, and her description of the advances as unwanted.  Senate Ethics Counsel finds this corroborating evidence persuasive, and finds that the incident occurred as described by Ms. Rothrock.<p> <p>     Senate Ethics Counsel finds that Senator Packwood's conduct in this instance fits a pattern of conduct that reflects an abuse of his position of authority, a pattern of conduct that constitutes improper conduct reflecting upon the Senate.<p> <p>     <H3>Q.   Julie Williamson</H3><p> <p>         <H4>1.  Testimony of Julie Williamson</H4><p> <p>     In late 1967 or early 1968, Julie Williamson worked as Senator Packwood's Clatsop County campaign chairperson.  In September, 1968, after her husband was transferred to Portland, she began working on Senator Packwood's general election campaign, running a phone bank.  In January, 1969, she was hired as a member of his Senate staff.  About six or eight weeks after she started, she was asked to staff a dinner the Senator was hosting for the Portland press corps at a local restaurant called Burt Lee's.  Not knowing that staff spouses were generally not invited to such events, she invited her husband to attend. When her husband arrived at the dinner, Senator Packwood appeared displeased, and seated him at the far end of the table.  He seated Ms. Williamson next to him at the head of the table, and two or three times during dinner he reached over and patted her on the leg.  After dinner, Ms. Williamson, her husband, and Senator Packwood sat in a booth in the bar and talked.  When Ms. Williamson's husband got up to go to the bathroom, Senator Packwood fell over Ms. Williamson, and gave her a big kiss on the side of the face.  She pushed him off.<p> <p>     On a Thursday afternoon about 2:00 p.m. later that spring in 1969, shortly before the annual Dorchester conference, an annual Oregon Republican event founded by the Senator, Ms. Williamson was working alone in the office.  As she talked on the phone in the front office, Senator Packwood came in, walked around the desk and behind Ms. Williamson, and kissed her on the back of the neck.  She finished her call, turned to him, and told him never to do that again.  She walked into the back office, and Senator Packwood followed her. Ms. Williamson became worried, and tried to get around the Senator to get out of the office; he tried to grab her, and she moved around the office to try to get away from him.  Finally, he grabbed her; when she tried to kick him in the shins, he stood on her feet.  He grabbed her ponytail with his left hand, pulled her head back forcefully, and gave her a big wet kiss, with his tongue in her mouth.  She did not smell or taste any alcohol.  With his right hand, he reached up under her skirt and grabbed the edge of her panty girdle and tried to pull it down.  She struggled, got away from him, and ran into the front office.  He stalked out past her, paused at the threshold to the hallway, and told her, "If not today, someday," and left.<p> <p>     Ms. Williamson called a friend, Ann Elias, and asked if she could come over to her apartment, because something terrible had just happened.  At the time, Ms. Elias was the office manager for Senator Packwood's 1968 campaign committee, and her husband was the campaign manager.  Ms. Williamson locked up the office and went to Ms. Elias's apartment; they talked for some time, with Ms. Williamson telling Ms. Elias what had happened, and Ms. Williamson then went home.<p> <p>     The next weekend, Ms. Williamson and her husband attended the Dorchester conference.  Ms. Williamson spoke to Senator Packwood only once, as she sat in a bar next to his wife, Georgie.  He slid up on the bar stool next to Ms. Williamson, and whispered in her ear, "Don't tell your husband, and don't quit your job,' and then walked off.<p> <p>     The following Monday, Ms. Williamson told Roy Sampsel, Senator Packwood's driver about what had happened.  Mr. Sampsel told her, in effect, "Don't take it personally, the Senator's just like that."  She also told Senator Packwood's administrative assistant about the incident.[fn 101]<p> <p>     About two weeks later, Ms. Williamson picked the Senator up at the Multnomah Athletic Club, to drive him to the Civic Auditorium for an appearance.  When Senator Packwood got in the car, she angrily confronted him about the incident, and asked him what it was that he had thought was going to happen the other day.  She asked, in effect, whether he thought they were just going to have at it on the office floor.  He responded, "I suppose you're one of the ones who want a motel."  Senator Packwood appeared to be angry that Ms. Williamson had confronted him.  He got out of the car at the Auditorium, delivered a speech for the Girl Scout cookie drive, and got back in the car. She drove him back to the Multnomah Athletic Club, and he got out, slammed the front door, retrieved his package of Girl Scout cookies from the back seat, and left.  That was the last time she spoke with the Senator.  She quit her job shortly thereafter, although she did not have another job at the time.  With her typing and secretarial skills, she was able to get a job fairly quickly with a Portland law firm, although she had to take a cut in pay.<p> <p>     <H4> 2.   Corroborating Witnesses</H4><p> <p>     The staff interviewed eight witnesses who recall that Ms. Williamson told them in the late 1960's or early 1970's about an incident that had occurred involving Senator Packwood.  Their recollections of their conversations with Ms. Williamson vary as to the details they recall; five, including her husband at the time, recall that Ms. Williamson told him or her that Senator Packwood had "attacked" her, or tried to take her clothes off; four of these witnesses recall that Ms. Williamson was very upset by the incident.  A sixth witness recalls that Ms. Williamson told him that she had left Senator Packwood's office because of an incident involving sexual harassment,[fn 102] and the other two witnesses recall that Ms. Williamson told them that Senator Packwood had made a "pass" at her.[fn 103]<p> <p>     A ninth witness recalls that Ms. Williamson told him in 1992, shortly before the allegations became public, that Senator Packwood had grabbed her and kissed her, and tried to pull her girdle off.<p> <p>     The staff also deposed Ann Elias, the friend to whom Ms. Williamson spoke immediately after the incident.  Ms. Elias is a long-time friend of Senator Packwood's.  Shortly before the <I>Washington Post</I> story was published, Ms. Elias wrote a statement at Senator Packwood's request, in which she opined that Ms. Williamson was interested in a "romantic" relationship with Senator Packwood. At her deposition, Ms. Elias testified that Ms. Williamson had come to her apartment one afternoon in early 1969, and told her that Senator Packwood had kissed her.  She testified that Ms. Williamson had not told her anything about Senator Packwood standing on her toes, pulling at her clothes, or pulling her ponytail.[fn 104]  She testified that Ms. Williamson was "titillated" by the incident, although she could not point to anything to support that opinion. She testified that Ms. Williamson discussed with her the possibility of a relationship with the Senator, and wondered if she should tell her husband about the incident.<p> <p>     According to Ms. Elias, Ms. Williamson has been telling this story on the "cocktail circuit" for years; she suggested that the story has gotten better with each telling.[fn 105]<p> <p>       <H4>2. [sic]  Senator Packwood's Response</H4><p> <p>     Senator Packwood recalled that he first met Ms. Williamson in late 1959 or 1960 when he worked as an attorney in private practice; Ms. Williamson was a legal secretary at a different firm in the same building.  She worked as a volunteer on his campaign in 1962.  During his 1968 campaign, she acted as his Clatsop County campaign chair.  After her husband was transferred back to Portland, she worked in his campaign headquarters until the fall of 1968, when he hired her onto his Senate staff.  He did not recall her position or duties, the size of his staff, or the size or layout of his office at the time.  He did recall that part of Ms. Williamson's duties would have been to answer phones, type, and act as a receptionist, although he did not recall where she sat in the office.<p> <p>     Senator Packwood described Ms. Williamson as having short, close blond hair.  He recalled that she was a very good county chair, and a good headquarters worker, but he did not recall what type of employee she was while she was on his Senate staff.<p> <p>     Senator Packwood did not recall the dinner at Burt Lee's that Ms. Williamson referred to, or any other dinner that she staffed for him, or that she and her husband attended.  He did not recall anything about this incident described by Ms. Williamson.[fn 106]<p> <p>     Senator Packwood had no recollection of the incident described by Ms. Williamson as taking place shortly before the Dorchester conference in 1969, in which Ms. Williamson claims that Senator Packwood grabbed her, pulled her ponytail, kissed her, and tried to take off her girdle.  Senator Packwood stated that Ms. Williamson had very short hair at the time, and that she did not have a pony tail.  He provided photographs of Ms. Williamson taken at his campaign headquarters in the fall of 1968,.before the election.[fn 107]<p> <p>     Senator Packwood recalled nothing about the incident described by Ms. Williamson as taking place at the Dorchester conference.<p> <p>     Senator Packwood did recall that on a weekend day, Ms. Williamson had driven him to a Girl Scout function, possibly the cookie drive kickoff.  He did not recall why she was driving him that day, but he believed that she was driving her car.  He recalled that the two of them talked about the possibility of having an affair, and that Ms. Williamson asked where they would do that. He told her they could do it in the office, and she responded that she could not possibly do that.  He jokingly responded that he supposed they could use a motel.  Senator Packwood could not recall if this was the first time they had discussed the possibility of having an affair, nor could he recall who brought up the subject.  He did not recall ever discussing this subject with Ms. Williamson again.  He could not recall any physical contact between the two of them before this conversation.  He did not recall what they were doing at the time the conversation took place, if anyone else was in the car at the time, whether the conversation took place as they drove to the Girl Scout event or afterwards, or where Ms. Williamson took him after the Girl Scout event.[fn 108]<p> <p>     Senator Packwood recalled that Ms. Williamson left his employ in late spring of 1969.  He did not recall why she quit, or whether she had another job at the time.<p> <p>     Senator Packwood stated that he had heard from others in the past, he did not know when or from whom, that Ms. Williamson had made a passing comment to the effect that he had made a pass at her.  It was possible that Ann Elias had told him about the incident sometime before he talked to her about it in May, 1992.<p> <p>     Senator Packwood testified that he had called his former driver, Roy Sampsel, because he had read a story in the paper wherein Ms. Williamson claimed to have told her coworkers about the incident in his office.  He stated that Mr. Sampsel told him that Ms. Williamson used to talk to him about her terribly unhappy marriage, and specifically that she wanted to have an affair with Senator Packwood.  She asked Mr. Sampsel if she should do so.  Several weeks before the Dorchester conference, she told Mr. Sampsel that Senator Packwood had hugged her, and asked Mr. Sampsel if she should go to the conference.  Mr. Sampsel told the Senator that Ms. Williamson was in a "dither." He told the Senator that he advised Ms. Williamson against having an affair with the Senator.<p> <p>     Mr. Sampsel was contacted by the staff shortly after Senator Packwood gave this testimony.  He provided a sworn affidavit stating that in 1969, shortly before the Dorchester conference, Ms. Williamson told him that Senator Packwood had hugged her and made a pass at her in the office.  Mr. Sampsel believed that Ms. Williamson told him about this the same day it happened, or the next day. They talked about this incident more than once.  Mr. Sampsel told Ms. Williamson that the situation could not be allowed to get out of hand, because of the political implications for Senator Packwood.  He did not tell Senator Packwood what Ms. Williamson had said.  He described Senator Packwood as a flirter, and stated that he had had general conversations with him about his tendency to be overly flirtatious.<p> <p>     Mr. Sampsel stated that Ms. Williamson liked Senator Packwood a lot.  At the time, she was not getting along with her husband.  But she never told him that she wanted to have an affair with Senator Packwood, nor did he ever tell Senator Packwood that Ms. Williamson wanted to have an affair with him. Senator Packwood never indicated that he was interested in having an affair with Ms. Williamson.  Although Ms. Williamson was outgoing, perky, and a flirt herself, he saw no indication that she was interested in a sexual relationship with the Senator.<p> <p>     Mr. Sampsel stated that about three months before he was contacted by Committee staff, Senator Packwood called him, and said that he was under a little heat, and needed to see what Mr. Sampsel knew.  He asked if Mr. Sampsel recalled Ms. Williamson telling him about the version of the incident that appeared in the paper.  Mr. Sampsel told the Senator that he did not recall Ms. Williamson describing the incident as graphically or in as much detail as the version that appeared in the newspaper.<p> <p>     In his appearance before the Committee, Senator Packwood stated that he did not recall the incident, but that he denied that it happened as described by Ms. Williamson.  He based this denial on the fact that several persons claim that Ms. Williamson told them of the incident at the time, but she did not tell them about details such as him standing on her toes, pulling her hair, or attempting to pull down her undergarments.<p> <p>        <H4> 4.   Findings</H4><p> <p>     Senate Ethics Counsel finds that the incident as alleged by Ms. Williamson in fact occurred.  Although it occurred many years ago, Ms. Williamson has a vivid recollection of the incident. Additionally, several witnesses clearly recall that Ms. Williamson told them about the incident, including her distress At the incident  in some detail, shortly after it happened.<p> <p>     Senator Packwood has testified that he does not recall the incident described by Ms. Williamson.  At the same time, however, he has denied that the incident occurred <STRONG>as she now describes it</STRONG>. His basis for this denial is his conclusion that Ms. Williamson has embellished upon the incident, because several persons have stated that she told them of the incident at the time, but that she did not provide the details that she has now given to the Committee. Leaving aside the fact that Senator Packwood seems to be conceding that <STRONG>something</STRONG> happened, the fact that Ms. Williamson did not share all of the details of the incident with some of these witnesses does not mean that they did not occur. In addition, there are several indications in Senator Packwood's diary, and from testimony from one of Senator Packwood's closest friends, that one of these witnesses may have lied about her recollection of conversations with the staff member about the incident.<p> <p>     Senator Packwood has also suggested that even if he did make advances to Ms. Williamson, they were welcomed, because she wanted to have an affair with him.  He testified that they talked after the incident about having an affair (although he could not recall the details of the conversation), and that she told his driver that she wanted to have an affair with the Senator. Senator Packwood's driver has specifically denied that Ms. Williamson ever told him that she wanted to have an affair with the Senator.  Senator Packwood's recollection of the conversation with Ms. Williamson after the incident is not inconsistent with Ms. Williamson's recollection, and is not persuasive evidence that the incident as alleged by Ms. Williamson was welcomed.<p> <p>     Senate Ethics Counsel finds that Senator Packwood's conduct in this instance fits a pattern of conduct that reflects an abuse of his position of authority, a pattern of conduct that constitutes improper conduct reflecting upon the Senate.<p> <p>     <H3>R.   Additional Findings</H3><p> <p>     Senator Packwood has testified that until he entered a treatment program in late 1992, he had significant problems with alcohol: he drank often and heavily, and he suffered blackouts. He considers himself to be an alcoholic. Senator Packwood has offered this testimony not as an excuse for his actions, but perhaps as an explanation.<p> <p>     Counsel notes that several of the incidents occurred in the morning, and that Senator Packwood testified he did not drink in the morning.  Several occurred in the afternoon during office hours.  In only a few instances was there any indication that Senator Packwood could have been intoxicated at the time of the incident.  Senate Ethics Counsel finds that in each of the incidents alleged, regardless of his state of sobriety at the time of any given incident, Senator Packwood is responsible for his actions.<p> <p>      Senate Ethics Counsel finds that these incidents, taken collectively, reflect a pattern of abuse by Senator Packwood of his position of power over women who were in a subordinate position, either as his employees, as Senate employees, prospective employees, campaign workers, or persons whose livelihood prevented them from effectively protesting or seeking redress for his actions. These women were not on an equal footing with Senator Packwood, and he took advantage of that disparity to visit upon them uninvited and unwelcome sexual advances, some of which constituted serious assaultive behavior, but all of which constituted an abuse of his position of power and authority as a United States Senator.<p> <p>     Senate Ethics Counsel does not accept the notion that this type of conduct at one time was not viewed as improper, and that Senator Packwood is being punished for actions that were acceptable at the time.  It has never been acceptable conduct to force unwanted physical attentions on another.  Moreover, Senator Packwood's conduct is exacerbated by the fact that the incidents occurred with persons who were effectively powerless to protest in the face of his position as a United States Senator.<p> <p>     Senate Ethics Counsel finds that Senator Packwood's conduct, spanning a period of more than twenty years, constitutes a pattern of abuse of his position of power and authority, and is improper conduct reflecting upon the United States Senate.<p> <p>     During his appearance before the Committee in June 1995, Senator Packwood was asked to assess whether his conduct would reflect upon the Senate, if the alleged conduct actually happened, in only those cases which he had testified he did not recall.<blockquote> <p> "Q: (by Senator Dorgan) ... I guess my question was: If it happened, is it, in your judgment, behavior that brings discredit upon the Senate?<p> <p> A: If it happened--and of course this is always--if it happened and it became public, it brings discredit on the Senate.  If it happened and it doesn't become public, does that not bring discredit on the Senate?  It doesn't make the incident any better or worse, but is the discredit the publicity of it?"</blockquote> <p>     Senate Ethics Counsel rejects any suggestion that such conduct may not reflect discredit upon the Senate, if it remains undiscovered or unpublicized. It is the behavior which is discrediting, and it is no less so if only its victims know of<p> <p>      Senate Ethics Counsel notes that there are no time limitations on the Senate's authority to discipline Members. Some of the incidents occurred twenty-five years ago.  But these incidents cannot be considered in isolation. Counsel finds that all of the incidents, taken collectively, constitute a pattern of abuse by Senator Packwood, and improper conduct.  Counsel notes that the age of any particular incident is appropriately considered, not in a determination of whether the incident was part of a pattern, but in a determination of the appropriate sanction to be imposed upon Senator Packwood with respect to the pattern of improper conduct.<p> <p> <p> <hr> <p> <H3>Endnotes</H3><tt><font size=-1>  68.  This staff member is designated "C-1" in the Committee Exhibits.<p> <p> 69.  During an interview, Ms. Fulton stated that she had asked the staffer not to hang around the office in the evenings, because if someone was around to drink and talk with the Senator, he would stay instead of going home.  Ms. Fulton was worried about his drinking, and felt that the staffer gave him an excuse to stay at the office and drink.<p> <p> 70.  The recollections of the staffer and her roommate are slightly different regarding the timing of when she told her roommate about the incident.  The staffer recalls that she told her roommate about the incident the next day. Her roommate recalls that the staffer came home the evening of the incident, upset and crying, told her what had happened, and that she then went to her boyfriend's apartment.  Nevertheless, the staffer's roommate remembers specific details of the incident as described to her by the staffer.<p> <p> 71.  Senator Packwood testified that Lindy Paull had told Elaine Franklin that she would not come to any meetings with the staffer, but he could not recall whether he learned this while the staffer worked for him, or after she left.<p> <p> 72.  The staffer's fiance, later her husband, worked for Rep. DeFazio, a Democrat from Oregon.  Entries in Senator Packwood's diaries indicate that he attempted to capitalize on this fact by feeding misleading information to the staffer's husband, in the hopes that he would pass it on to his boss, and by using the staffer as a "mole" in the DeFazio camp.  When he was shown these entries, however, Senator Packwood could not remember if he took advantage of the staffer's relationship with her boyfriend to pass misinformation on to Rep. DeFazio.<p> <p> 73.  Senator Packwood stated that he did not know if his signature was even necessary to activate a pay raise, and it was possible that people got pay raises without his knowledge or approval.<p> <p> 74.  Senator Packwood would not say whether he attempted to accurately record his thoughts and impressions of his staffers - he said that he was "not going to get into that."  Nor could he vouch for the accuracy or inaccuracy of these entries at the time he recorded them; he would not say whether he intended these entries to be accurate.<p> <p> 75.  In a diary entry dated May 12, 1992, in which Senator Packwood records a conversation with Elaine Franklin about the possible Vanity Fair article, he records Ms. Franklin's comment that this was another example of the staffer blowing things out of proportion; he also records Pam Fulton's opinion that the staffer was indiscreet, because she told Ms. Fulton that she felt that she had to stay around and drink with the Senator.<p> <p> 76.  An April 1, 1992 diary entry records that the staffer is a liar, after Senator Packwood learned that she had some complaint about him making sexual advances toward her.  There is also an entry in the Cormack transcript for February 5, 1993, in which Senator Packwood recorded that the staffer was a "habitual liar;" however, this entry does not appear in the original diary tape.  Senator Packwood testified that he added it in late July or early August 1993.  Another diary entry in Senator Packwood's diary that indicates that the staffer was a liar appears in July of 1993.<p> <p> 77.  Julia Brim-Edwards, a Packwood staffer, in a statement she prepared for the Post in the fall of 1992, claimed that the staffer did not intend to ask anyone else to the Mel Torme concert, and that a week or so before the concert, she told the staffer that she thought it was inappropriate that she had asked the Senator to go to the concert.  She claimed that the staffer agreed, and tried to round up others to go; although there was not a lot of interest, she finally was able to find others to attend.<p> <p>    Senator Packwood's diary, however, has an entry several weeks before the concert reflecting that the reporter who attended the concert had been in his office that day, and that she was one of the persons who would be attending the Mel Torme concert.<p> <p> 78.  Although Senator Packwood claimed that he had been drinking heavily that evening, and that he did not recall returning to his office with the staffer, his diary contains an entry noting that he had taken the staff to dinner at the Irish Times, that he had "pushed a little hard' on the staffer, wanting her to be "a mole and a spy into the DeFazio organization because of her relationship with the guy she goes with," and noting that the staffer talked about Rep. DeFazio's support from the unions. Senator Packwood would not say if this entry was accurate, and stated that he could have totally made up the part of the entry discussing the conversation about labor unions.  However, this account of their conversation is consistent with the staffer's recollection of the evening.  <p> <p> 79.  This incident is recounted in Senator Packwood's diary. He also recounted it during the floor debate on enforcement of the Committee's document subpoena. The staffer has indicated, through her attorney, that this incident never occurred.<p> <p> 80.  There is an entry in Senator Packwood's diary for April 29, 1992, recording this meeting with the staffer and Ms. Franklin.<p> <p> 81.  This press release was provided to the Committee by the staffer's attorney.<p> <p> 82.  According to Senator Packwood, he deleted this entry from his diary tape, either before he left for recess in August 1993, or if the tape was still in his machine when he left for recess, when he got back in September.<p> <p> 83.  Senator Packwood's diary for August 21, 1993, indicates that in his review of previous diary entries, Senator Packwood found an entry reflecting that Ms. Heffernan wanted a job with him, that he had a telephone conversation with her in 1984, and that she had had lunch with him and Elaine Franklin to discuss the possibility.  <p> <p> 84.  The Committee received information from a woman who said that she saw Ms. Heffernan throw her arms around the Senator and kiss him on the mouth at a social function celebrating a legislative victory in September 1982.<p> <p> 85.  This would have occurred in January 1981.<p> <p> 86.  He recalled that she told him the room contained a couch and perhaps a mini-bar.<p> <p> 87.  Ms. Dawson also testified that, aside from that conversation, Ms. Wagers never said or did anything that suggested to her that she was interested in having an affair with the Senator.<p> <p> 88.  The press secretary and the administrative assistant are the same person.<p> <p> 89.  Both this evening, and the events of a following day, appear to be recounted in Senator Packwood's diary, in entries for February 11 and February 13, 1980.  They do not include Senator Packwood walking Ms. Hutton to her car. Senator Packwood stated that these entries were reasonably accurate, as far as they concerned Ms. Hutton, but he could not swear to the accuracy of everything in the entry.<p> <p> 90.  Senator Packwood stated that he had talked to two staffers who were in the van at the time, and that one of them, Terry Kay, remembered Ms. Hutton kissing him, while the other did not.  Mr. Kay confirmed that he had seen Ms. Hutton kiss the Senator on this occasion.  Senator Packwood's diary reflects that on the afternoon that Ms. Hutton was dropped off, she "gave each of us a kiss."<p> <p> 91.  Senator Packwood's attorneys have provided statements from two men who knew Ms. Hutton in the late 1970's and early 1980's.  One of these men, John Morrison, who told Staff Counsel that he himself was interested in Ms. Hutton, said he had observed in social situations that Ms. Hutton was "coming on" to the Senator.  The other man, Dr. Pat Golden, claimed that Ms. Hutton gave him the impression that she was a good friend of Senator Packwood, that she was close to him and enjoyed campaigning for him, and that she was fond of him.<p> <p> 92.  This staff member is designated "C-7" in the Committee's Exhibits.<p> <p> 93.  The staff member does not recall why she was working in Senator Packwood's office at the time.  She may have been going over Committee work with the Senator, or talking about the recent eruption at Mount St. Helen's.  She stated that it was not too uncommon for Committee staffers to be working in Senator Packwood' 6 personal office.<p> <p> 94.  The staff member had the idea that she might be safe from Senator Packwood if he thought she had a boyfriend.<p> <p> 95.  There appears to be some confusion about the time period of the incident: the staff member remembers that it happened in the early summer of 1980; her friend seems to recall that it happened during the college Christmas break in late 1980 or early 1981.  Nevertheless, her friend clearly recalls the incident.<p> <p> 96.  This person is designated "C-8  in the Committee Exhibits.<p> <p> 97.  Senator Packwood's calendar for 1977 indicates that he met with Ms. McMahon at 6:15 on February 17.<p> <p> 98.  This staff member is designated  C-12  in the Committee's Exhibits.<p> <p> 99.  This staff member is designated 'C-13" in the Committee's Exhibits.<p> <p> 100.  This staff member is designated "C-15" in the Committee Exhibits.<p> <p> 101.  In a letter to Senator Packwood dated November 19, 1992, which Senator Packwood forwarded to the Post, the administrative assistant states that he does not recall the staff member telling him about the incident; he also confirmed this in an interview with the staff.  A diary entry and a memo provided to the Committee by Senator Packwood indicate that this individual did tell Senator Packwood that he had heard from others that Senator Packwood had tried to "screw" the staff member.  Senator Packwood testified that the individual had used that term not in a sexual sense, but in the sense that he had made a pass at her.<p> <p> 102.  This witness's spouse recalls that when asked why she left Senator Packwood's office, Ms. Williamson made vague comments indicating that "something" had happened.<p> <p> 103.  One witness did not believe Ms. Williamson when she told her about the "pass."  The other witness recalled that Ms. Williamson told her that Senator Packwood had made a "pass" at her, and had chased her, but she did not recall the incident as being as serious as Ms. Williamson now alleges, and she did not think that Ms. Williamson seemed agitated or upset at the time.<p> <p> 104.  Ms. Elias claimed that Ms. Williamson did not wear her hair in a ponytail at the time, and that her hair was not even long enough to tie back.<p> <p> 105.  Although Ms. Elias, Elaine Franklin, and Senator Packwood himself all testified that Ms. Williamson had been telling her story on the "cocktail circuit," the staff was unable to find anyone, other than Ms. Elias, who claimed to have actually heard Ms. Williamson telling her "story" in social settings over the years, or who could verify that it had "grown" with the retelling.  In addition, Senator Packwood's diary entries indicate that Ms. Elias was uncomfortable with the statement she prepared for Senator Packwood, specifically that she was torn between her loyalty to Senator Packwood and her desire to tell the truth.  The entries indicate that she was "buoyed up" by Jack Faust, a friend of Senator Packwood's, who convinced her that Ms. Williamson had been telling her story on the "cocktail circuit" over the years, and that it had grown as it was retold.<p> <p> 106.  Senator Packwood's diary indicates that on February 10 1969, he hosted a dinner at Burt Lee's for the media.<p> <p> 107.  These pictures show Ms. Williamson from the front, with short, wispy hair.  One witness has stated that at the time of the incident in the spring of 1969, or shortly thereafter, Ms. Williamson did indeed wear her hair in a ponytail.  She describes her as having fine hair that she was trying to grow long, which she pulled back in a short ponytail.  Another witness stated that as of late 1968 and early 1969, Ms. Williamson had short stringy hair that she pulled back from her face with bobbypins; as it grew longer, she pulled it back in a ponytail.<p> <p> 108.  Senator Packwood's diaries have an entry dated Saturday, April 5, 1969, which reflects that he attended a Girl Scout event.  It does not reflect that Ms. Williamson drove him, or any conversation about an affair. <p> </tt></font>><P><UL><UL> <a href=pack1.htm#tab><LI><I>To table of contents</I></a><br> <a href=pack3.htm><LI><I>To next section</I></a></ul></ul><center>  <hr size=7><P>Released through<H3>LEXIS COUNSEL CONNECT</H3> LEXIS COUNSEL CONNECT is a communications and information service for attorneys.

Summary and Overview of the Evidence</H3><p> <p>     Senator Packwood's diaries comprise over 8,000 pages of single-spaced entries for virtually every day since 1969, including weekends and vacations. They set out minute details of his life since 1969, from security briefings by the White House, to meetings with constituents, lobbyists and other senators, to detailed descriptions of meals and social occasions.<p> <p>      Senator Packwood dictated his diaries, first on dictation belts, and later on audiotapes, which were transcribed by Cathy Cormack, who was his personal secretary from 1969 to 1981, when she went to work for the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee.  While Ms. Cormack worked for the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee, she continued to type the diaries, and received a modest reimbursement from Senate funds.  When she left the Committee in 1983, she continued to type Senator Packwood's diaries, for which services she was paid by Senator Packwood's campaign committee.<p> <p>      <B>NOTE:</B> (For a detailed explanation of events leading up to the Committee's review of the Senator's diaries, see discussion in the Procedural Background section.)<p> <p>  <H4>1.   Results of Comparison of Tape to Transcript</H4><p> <p>     In view of Ms. Cormack's testimony in December, 1993 about changes made by Senator Packwood to tapes which she was transcribing, it was necessary to compare the transcripts which she typed from tapes altered by Senator Packwood with transcripts prepared from the original unchanged tapes to determine if there were any differences.  The staff compared the transcripts prepared from the original unchanged audiotapes to the "Cormack" transcripts for 1989 through 1993, in order to determine if there were entries on the audiotape that had been left out of the Cormack transcripts, if there were entries on the audiotape that had been changed in the Cormack transcripts, or if there were passages on the Cormack transcripts that that[sic] were not on the audiotape.<p> <p>     As the staff compared the transcript prepared from the original unchanged audiotapes to the Cormack transcripts for 1992 and 1993, it discovered numerous differences between them.  These differences fell into three broad categories:[fn 109]<UL> <p>     a.   Large portions of the audiotape that were completely missing from the Cormack transcripts;<p> <p>     b.   Numerous instances, especially in the last half of 1993, where entries from the audiotape appeared on the Cormack transcripts, but were heavily reworded;<p> <p>     c.   Many instances where entries related to the Committee's inquiry or arguably incriminating or embarrassing entries on the audiotapes were missing from the Cormack transcripts, and different entries were substituted in their place.</ul> <p>     The staff found no differences, other than minor differences that could be laid to transcriber error, between the audiotapes for 1989, 1990, and 1991, and the corresponding Cormack transcripts.<p> <p> <H4>2.   The Focus on Certain Changed Entries</H4><p> <p>     Differences in these first two categories could arguably be attributed to the transcriber, particularly since Ms. Cormack had testified that she had been under intense time pressure to transcribe the audiotapes for 1992 and 1993, and that she had condensed many entries.  Senate Ethics Counsel focused on the third category, and isolated entries related to the Committee's inquiry or where potentially incriminating or embarrassing portions of the audiotapes were missing from the Cormack transcripts, and neutral or arguably exculpatory entries were substituted in the Cormack transcripts.<p> <p> The entries in this third category fall into several groups:<UL> <p>     a.   Entries dealing with the Committee's inquiry into alleged sexual misconduct and witness intimidation;<p> <p>     b.   Entries indicating Senator Packwood's knowledge of, and possible involvement with, independent expenditures made on his behalf during his 1992 campaign;<p> <p>     c.   Entries discussing Senator Packwood's possible use of office staff or facilities for campaign purposes;<p> <p>     d.   Entries dealing with the Oregon Citizens Alliance (OCA), which had accused Senator Packwood of making a "deal" during the 1992 senatorial campaign, that the OCA would not run a candidate against him in return for promises by him;<p> <p>     e.   Entries referring to contributions to Senator Packwood's legal defense fund.</ul> <p>     Once these entries were isolated, the staff questioned both Cathy Cormack and Senator Packwood to determine who was responsible for making the changes.<p> <p>      <H4>3.   Brief Summary of Senator Packwood's Response</H4><p> <p>       For the most part, Senator Packwood took responsibility for the deletions from the audiotape where there were corresponding substitutions in the Cormack transcripts.  He testified that he began making changes to his untranscribed diary tapes in January 1993, and through the spring of 1993, after his attorneys requested that he provide them with excerpts from his 1992 diaries that might deal with the issue of witness intimidation.[fn 110]  He stated that he was fearful that his diaries would be leaked to the press from his attorneys' offices, and he knew that there were entries in the diaries that he did not want to appear in public.  As the Senator listened to the audiotapes to find the portions relating to possible witness intimidation to provide to his lawyers, he believes that he made notes about the location of passages he might later want to delete.  After a January 1993 trip to Oregon and the intense media attention that was focused on him. his fear of leaks intensified.<p> <p>     Through the spring of 1993, while he reviewed his diary tapes for 1992 looking for the excerpts requested by his attorneys, and for other entries that might be helpful to his attorneys, Senator Packwood also deleted certain potentially embarrassing passages from the audiotapes, and in many cases, substituted different passages, more from a compulsion to fill up the space on the tape than anything else.<p> <p>     Senator Packwood was not concerned about leaks from his 1993 diary audiotapes at this time, as his attorneys had not requested them.  Thus, during the spring of 1993, as he reviewed his diaries for previous years (including his 1992 audiotapes) for information that would he helpful to his attorneys, and at the same time made changes to his 1992 audiotapes to delete embarrassing references, Senator Packwood continued to dictate contemporaneous entries with no effort to monitor his dictation to exclude embarrassing or damaging entries.<p> <p>       Sometime later that summer, in late July or early August, 1993, Senator Packwood's attorneys asked that he get the rest of his audiotapes transcribed.[fn 111] Fearing that the 1993 diaries would now be leaked to the press through his attorneys' offices, Senator Packwood went through these tapes and again deleted entries that might prove embarrassing to himself or others if they got to the press. In many cases, he also substituted different entries on the tape, again, more out of a compulsion to fill the space on the tape than for any other reason.[fn 112]<p> <p>       After dropping off all of the outstanding audiotapes to his transcriber, Cathy Cormack, in early August 1993, Senator Packwood took all of his previously transcribed diaries, from 1991 going back to 1969, home with him during the August 1993 recess, where he reviewed them for information that might be helpful to his attorneys. However, despite the fact that he was fearful that the press would obtain all of his diaries, he made no changes to any of these transcripts to delete entries that would prove embarrassing to himself or others if obtained by the press. Senator Packwood testified that he felt no need to excise embarrassing entries from his 1969 - 1991 diaries, because he was selecting pages from these years to give to his attorneys.<p> <p>       After he returned from the recess, Senator Packwood asked Ms. Cormack to give him the audiotapes back, as he had neglected to make a copy for himself of the changed 1993 audiotapes that he had given to her before the recess.[fn 113] Ms. Cormack recalled that Senator Packwood told her he wanted the audiotapes back because of the possibility that there might be a subpoena; Senator Packwood did not recall that conversation, although he thought it was possible he might have mentioned the word "subpoena" to her in a different conversation. Both now recall that event taking place sometime in September 1993.  Senator Packwood returned the tapes to Ms. Cormack within about a week.<p> <p>       Again, during this time when he was changing prior tapes to remove embarrassing entries, Senator Packwood continued to dictate contemporaneous entries with no effort to monitor the content of those entries. He made changes to one of those tapes, covering August and possibly part of September 1993, as soon as he was finished dictating it, and before he gave it to Ms. Cormack to type.<p> <p>       Senator Packwood delivered all of his diaries that had been transcribed to date to his attorneys on October 7, 1993, shortly after his first deposition was interrupted so that the Committee could review the diaries.[fn 114]  Ms. Cormack continued to work on the untranscribed audiotapes for 1992 and 1993, and Senator Packwood provided his attorneys with transcripts as they were finished.[fn 115] Because she was in a rush to complete the diaries, Ms. Cormack skipped over, with Senator Packwood's approval, passages that she deemed to be unimportant, dealing with things such as squash games with fellow Senators, food, stereo equipment, music, and movies.<p> <p>     Senator Packwood made some changes to his diary tape covering August 1993. He testified that he made no changes to September entries, but he did change some October entries after Ms. Cormack had typed them, marking up the pages and giving Ms. Cormack instructions on what changes he wanted made.  Although some of these changes were made after his deposition was interrupted, he testified that he felt free to edit entries which were made after the deposition was interrupted.  With respect to any entries he changed after he received the Committee's subpoena, he testified that he did not feel that the subpoena prevented him from editing his diaries as they were typed and he saw them for the first time.  Senator Packwood also testified that it was possible he may have made changes to transcript pages for dates prior to his deposition, after his deposition was interrupted and after he received the Committee's subpoena. Senator Packwood also testified that as Ms. Cormack completed the transcription of tapes after his October 1993 deposition was interrupted, and after he received the Committee's subpoena, he continued to destroy the corresponding tapes.[fn 116]<p> <p>     Senator Packwood's attorneys were not aware that he kept original, backup tapes for his diaries.[fn 117]  They learned of the existence of these tapes on the evening of November 21, 1993, and the tapes were delivered to them by Senator Packwood on November 22.  That same day, Arnold &amp; Porter terminated their representation of Senator Packwood.<p> <p>     <H3>B.   Testimony and Evidence</H3><p> <p>        <H4>1.   Testimony by Cathy Cormack</H4><p> <p>     Ms. Cormack's deposition was taken a total of three times. It was taken in November 1993 to determine how she was paid for her transcription of the diaries.  After she provided an affidavit to the Committee on December 10, 1993 (after having reviewed her deposition), indicating that some of the tapes she typed had been changed, her deposition was taken again in December 1993.  Once the staff had had the chance to compare the transcripts she typed for Senator Packwood with the original unchanged tapes, her deposition was taken again in December 1994.<p> <p>      a.   Historical Transcription of the Diaries<p> <p>     Ms. Cormack testified that she had transcribed the diaries while she was a member of Senator Packwood's personal Senate office staff, from 1969 to 1981. She was not paid any additional compensation, over and above her Senate salary, for transcribing the diaries.  She then moved to the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee, where she was paid a small sum from the Senate Disbursing Office to transcribe Senator Packwood's diaries.  Shortly after she left the Campaign Committee, she began to be paid to transcribe the diaries from Senator Packwood's campaign fund.  She has never been paid for transcribing the diaries from the personal funds of Senator Packwood.  Senator Packwood also provided her with an IBM Selectric typewriter, which she used to type the diaries, and dictation equipment.<p> <p>     Ms. Cormack testified that over the last 23 years or so, Senator Packwood has dictated his diaries on audiotapes, which he periodically provided to her, either delivering them to her, or having her pick them up from his office.  For a short time, she lived with her husband in California and later Japan, and received tapes from Senator Packwood by mail.  Once she returned the typed transcripts to Senator Packwood, she would erase the audiotape, and either return it to Senator Packwood, or throw it away.  A single tape, both sides, covered, on the average, about three weeks to one month of entries, and took about eight to ten hours to type.  Ms. Cormack usually received six to eight tapes at a time from Senator Packwood and typically was about a year or so behind in her transcription.  Except for the time period when she lived in California and Japan, when she knew that she received copies of the tapes, Ms. Cormack assumed that she was working from the original diary tapes.  As she completed typing a tape, she would erase it and throw it away.  Sometime after her first deposition in December 1993, she had occasion to see Senator Packwood, and he commented to her that he had the original diary tapes, and she had received copies to transcribe.<p> <p>      b.   Early 1993 Request to Transcribe Excerpts<p> <p>     Ms. Cormack testified that in January 1993, Senator Packwood asked her to transcribe diary entries surrounding the 1992 general election out of sequence, as he had been asked for these entries by his attorneys.  At that point, she was about a year and half behind in her transcription, and although she may have been working on the backlog for earlier in 1992, she had not yet reached the time period surrounding the 1992 election.  She had some tapes from early 1992 in her possession, but she did not know specifically which ones; in any event, she did not have the tape or tapes that covered the general election in the fall.  She believed that at this time, she had a backlog of 1991 and 1992 tapes going up to, but not including, the period around the general election of 1992.  Senator Packwood provided her with the tape or tapes for this time period, along with a separate tape that contained instructions on which entries she should type. She typed the entries as instructed within a few days, and provided them to Senator Packwood.  Because these entries were being typed out of sequence, she did not number the pages[fn 118] Because she knew she would have to come back eventually and type the entire tape, she did not erase it, but she did not recall if she kept the tape or gave it back to Senator Packwood.  Ms. Cormack then resumed her normal transcription of the diaries. <p> <p>          c.   August 1993 Delivery of Tapes<p> <p>     Ms. Cormack may have done a small amount of transcribing between January 1993, when she finished the 1992 election entries out of sequence, and August of 1993, for tapes for late 1991 and early 1992.  In August 1993, about the time of the August recess, she received six to eight tapes for transcription from Senator Packwood, covering the first half of 1993, up to the August recess.  She also had a backlog of tapes going back to the first part of 1992, which she had not yet transcribed.  Altogether, including the tapes that Senator Packwood brought to her in August, she had about 20 tapes to be transcribed.<p> <p>        d.   Request to Bring Transcription Up To Date<p> <p>     Ms. Cormack did not begin working on the backlog right away, as she left for vacation in August.  She did some work on the tapes when she returned from vacation.  Sometime in early September, around Labor Day, or possibly later in September or October, Senator Packwood asked her to get caught up to date in typing the transcripts.  Ms. Cormack described this as the "crunch time," when she was working hard to get the diaries up to date.<p> <p>     In the past, Ms. Cormack had typed the transcripts virtually verbatim, correcting a name if she knew it was incorrect, cleaning up grammar, leaving out repetitions, but never intentionally deleting, paraphrasing, or adding material as she typed.  In contrast, during this "crunch time," Ms. Cormack asked Senator Packwood if she could "boil down" passages having to do with things such as stereo equipment, squash games, and meals; Senator Packwood assented.  However, she <STRONG>never</STRONG> added information to the transcript that was not on the tape (with one exception relating to Senator Packwood's purchase of a condominium where she acted as his real estate agent).<p> <p>     During this time period, that is, early September 1993, Senator Packwood telephoned her and asked her to type three or four months in 1992 out of sequence.  She did so, and got the transcripts to him right away, as she assumed that he was meeting with his attorneys.  She then returned to typing the backlog of tapes.<p> <p>     e.   Senator Packwood Asks For The Return of the Tapes<p> <p>     Sometime in early September, but before mid-October, Senator Packwood called her, and asked her to give all of the tapes back.[fn 119] He said something to her about "the possibility of a subpoena," and that "he didn't want me to have anything in my possession if that were to occur."  She believed that he was trying to protect her.  Within the week, however, Senator Packwood returned the tapes to her for transcription, bringing them back in two batches.<p> <p>       f.   Discovery of Changes to Tapes<p> <p>      Because Senator Packwood had requested that she bring the transcription up to date, Ms. Cormack spent the next several weeks working feverishly to transcribe all of the tapes.  In transcribing those tapes, Ms. Cormack sensed that there may have been some alterations:  there were differences in the sound on the tape, differences in background noises, differences in volume, breaks in the dialogue.  She could not recall how many tapes sounded "irregular," but she recalled that it was more than one.  At one point, Ms. Cormack asked Senator Packwood if he was making changes in the tapes, and he confirmed that he was, either verbally or by his body language.<p> <p>     In addition, Ms. Cormack testified that during mid to late October, when the was really "crunching" to catch up on the backlog of tapes, Senator Packwood occasionally asked her to make changes in the text of diary entries she had recently typed. More specifically, Ms. Cormack testified as follows: <blockquote> <p> Q:   You mentioned that he would ask you to make changes in text.  Were these changes made after you had typed the transcript?<p> <p> A:   In some cases.<p> <p> Q:   Tell us how that happened.<p> <p> A:   Some times he would mark up a piece of paper and I would redo it.  And on a few occasions, he would dictate, on a separate tape, a few changes, and give me the pages.<p> <p> Q:   What time period did this occur in, that he was asking you to make--<p> <p> A:   All within the same--I'm sorry, go ahead.<p> <p> Q:   What time period did that occur in where Senator Packwood was asking you to make changes in the text?<p> <p> A:   This would be mostly, as best I can recall, within the fifteen--mid-to-late October period, when I was crunching to get this done.<p> <p> Q:   Of 1993?<p> <p> A:   Yes.</blockquote> <p>     Ms. Cormack does not recall Senator Packwood asking her to do this often, but it happened more than once.  She recalled that the changes mostly covered the backlogged months, that is, a good part of 1992 and 1993.  Ms. Cormack testified that historically, there were less than five occasions when Senator Packwood had asked her to make changes on diary pages that had already been typed.<p> <p>     Ms. Cormack did not recall the precise dates that were affected by Senator Packwood's alterations, but she did know that the general time period would have included a large portion of 1992, and a large portion of 1993, as those were the tapes that she had backlogged at the time.  She could not remember if any of the changes to the typed pages were for years earlier than 1992.<p> <p>      g.   Completion of the Tapes<p> <p>       Ms. Cormack finished transcribing a good portion of the backlogged tapes by mid to late October 1993.  Once every other day during this September - October 1993 time period, or as she completed a fair amount of transcript, Ms. Cormack would deliver it to Senator Packwood.  In addition to her backlog of tapes, and the six or eight tapes that Senator Packwood gave her around the time of the August recess, she also received one or two tapes during the "crunch time" covering August, September, October, and early November 1993, which she completed transcribing in early November.[fn 120] Ms. Cormack recalled that all told, she completed the backlog in a time frame of about six weeks.<p> <p>       h.   Comparison of Tape to Transcript     <p> <p>       For those entries where material had been added to the Cormack transcript that did not appear on the audiotape, Ms. Cormack was asked to compare the transcript that the Committee had prepared from the audiotape to the corresponding Cormack transcript.  In general, she testified that although in a few of these instances, she may have skipped over some of the material that was on the tape, in no instance did she add any of the information that was on the Cormack transcript, but not on the corresponding audiotape (with the one exception about the Senator's condominium that was mentioned earlier).<p> <p>       <H4>2.   Testimony by Senator Packwood</H4><p> <p>           a.   Mechanics of Diary Keeping<p> <p>      Senator Packwood testified that he began keeping his diaries in 1969, first dictating entries on dictabelts or disks, and later switching to audiotapes.  Cathy Cormack, who had been his legislative and legal secretary in Oregon, and his secretary in the Senate, and was his longstanding friend and confidant, transcribed his diaries for him from the beginning, up until the fall of 1993.[fn 121]  This task was not part of her official duties, and she was not paid anything over her Senate salary for typing his diaries while she was on his Senate staff.  When she left his staff and went-to work for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, she continued to transcribe the diaries, and she remained on the Senate payroll, not for transcribing the diaries, but because she still did some official Senate work for Senator Packwood.[fn 122]  After Ms. Cormack left the Campaign Committee, she continued to transcribe the diaries, and she was paid from Senator Packwood's campaign funds.  No one but Ms. Cormack transcribed the diaries, and she is the only person, other than the Senator, who ever saw the diaries up until the Committee's inquiry.<p> <p>     Senator Packwood testified that he used tapes that were sixty minutes on each side, and on average, one tape would hold about a half month's worth of diary entries.  He typically made a duplicate of the tape for Ms. Cormack, which she erased when she was finished typing.[fn 123]  Ms. Cormack was traditionally about a year and a half behind in her transcription. Periodically, either she picked up tapes from him, or he dropped them off to her.  Ms. Cormack would not necessarily run out of tapes, but if she were down to, say, her last two tapes, she would ask him for more tapes.  Upon receiving the typed transcripts from Ms. Cormack, Senator Packwood organized them in binders, and kept them in his safe.  He and Cathy Cormack are the only persons who have the combination to this safe.  He seldom reviewed the typed transcripts or made changes to them; occasionally, maybe ten or twenty times over the course of over twenty years, he edited them.[fn 124]<p> <p>        b.   Accuracy and Reliability of the Diaries<p> <p>     Senator Packwood was questioned at length at his January 1995 deposition about the accuracy and reliability of the entries in his diaries.  Senator Packwood stated that he did not always dictate his diaries daily, and he often went two or three days before dictating entries.  He stated that he usually dictated entries the next morning, but very seldom on the same day, using his daily calendar of events as a reference guide.[fn 125]<blockquote> <p> "Q:  And from that schedule, and your memory, you would dictate the diary entries?<p> <p> A:  Yeah, memory, I suppose real or imagined."</blockquote> <p>      Senator Packwood stated that one purpose of keeping the diary was as therapy - that while some people talked to psychologists, he talked to his diary.  He described it as a potpourri of everything, with perhaps no single purpose.  He stated that there was no overwhelming reason he kept his diary, and that perhaps it was just the result of compulsion.<p> <p>     Senator Packwood stated that it was sometimes his intent to create an accurate record of events, and sometimes he simply gave voice to thoughts that he would put in narrative form, even though a conversation may not have happened in that fashion. During his 1995 deposition, Senator Packwood stated that he would attribute statements to someone if he thought that was what the person felt, even if that person had not said it at the time.  He might record a detailed conversation that never took place.<blockquote> <p> "Q:   Was it your intention to create an accurate record of events?<p> <p> A:   Well, sometimes yes.  Sometimes I say I would give voice to conversations or thoughts and I would put them in narrative form, even though they may not have happened in that fashion.<p> <p> Q:   Let me ask the question this way:  Was it your intent in recording diary material to create a nonfictional account?<p> <p> A:   No, not necessarily.  I don't mean to say I was writing a novel with it, and I don't mean to say I was lying to it, but to the extent -- have you ever seen this situation?  In fact, I've seen memos to this effect.  You have a meeting with somebody, some lobbyist comes in.  And then the memo later -- you get a memo later that's given to you of the lobbyist's report of the meeting. And it doesn't comport with what you remember at all.  And you may say to your staff, God, did I say that?  And they'll say well, no, or maybe, Senator, unfortunately you did, and the lobbyist thought totally different than you remembered it.  So I may put things in there that others would totally remember as different. <p> Q:   But the point that I'm trying to get to is you would, would you not, attempt to honestly record what you saw and heard and your impressions of what took place at a meeting? You weren't trying to record something that didn't happen, were you?<p> <p> As   No -- I don't mean no as the answer.  As I said, I would put things into narrative form, conversations, between Jones and Smith or Packwood and Green that I would picture I would have thought or they might have thought that might not have been said."<p> <p>     Senator Packwood was asked about his intent in making entries in his diary:<p> <p> "Q:   But it was your intent, was it not, to capture the essence of what happened and to express that accurately?<p> <p> A:   Again, I don't think I can answer the question any better than I have.<p> <p> Q:   I'm not sure that the question has been answered here quite yet.  And that is a very simple question.  Were you, in dictating the diary entries, making an effort, or was it your intent to record events or your impression of events accurately, truthfully and honestly?<p> <p> A:   Well, again, I'll try to answer it once more.  I could put into it conversations, because I dictate in a conversational narrative form that may not have taken place.<p> <p> Q:   But were you trying accurately and truthfully to capture the substance of what took place?<p> <p> A:   I'm saying the conversation may not have taken place.<p> <p> Q:   But as you dictated the conversation, which didn't take place, were you -- was it your intent to have that conversation reflect the substance of what happened?<p> <p> [Witness conferred with counsel.]<p> <p> MR. MUSE:  Ask that question again, because you combine a whole lot with those questions.<p> <p> Q:   Was it your intention in dictating entries to the diary and relating an event or a meeting to capture and express accurately the substance of what took place at that meeting or event?<p> <p> A:   Well, it would depend on my mood, the day, the thoughts, the pressure. But I'll say once more, I might relate a conversation that did not take place on a subject that did not take place."</blockquote> <p>      Although he indicated that his diary was generally an accurate record of time and place and events, Senator Packwood reiterated numerous times that the substance of the entries in his diaries may not be accurate, and that conversations reflected therein may or may not have occurred, or if they did, they may or may not have been recounted accurately.  Nor could he provide the Committee with any way to determine which entries were accurate and which were not.<p> <p>     Senator Packwood was referred to an entry from his diary for July 21, 1989, which reads as follows:<blockquote> <p> "Had an interview with somebody doing a book on Tom McCall. I did both of these at [name omitted]'s request.  This guy is well documented in his facts and the one embarrassing thing he had was that allegation that I met with Tom at his beach place in 1972 to try to talk Tom into running against [name omitted].  I don't know what my diary may show on this.  I don't recall. I denied that the conversation had ever taken place and now in my life I don't recall if it took place or not.  My diary would be a better testimony to that, dictated at the time."</blockquote> <p> Senator Packwood was questioned as follows:<blockquote> <p> "Q:   You appeared to recognize as early as 1989 that your diary was a reliable reference or resource document, did you not, Senator?<p> <p> A:   Mr. Baird, sometimes it's accurate.  Sometimes it's inaccurate.  Sometimes it's fact.  Sometimes it's fiction. It is not a reliable document.  I didn't prepare it for anybody to rely upon it.  I never reviewed it.  I never edited it.  I never saw it again.  It is no - I didn't draft it.  It's not like doing a letter or a memo.  It cannot be regarded as accurate.<p> <p> Q:   How does one tell which parts of it are accurate and which parts are not?<p> <p> A:   I have no idea how you tell.  I have no idea how a historian tells.  As a matter of fact, I think this particular meeting with Tom McCall is recounted in his book, too.  Whether he sees it the same way I saw it or not, I don't know.<p> <p> Q:   Why would you have thought it was a reliable source to look to here to find out whether or not you had had a conversation?<p> <p> A:   I've already indicated that if somebody else has a different view of something that appears in here, I'd be inclined to defer to how they heard it rather than I heard it.  Am I going to say this diary is always accurate?  It clearly is not always accurate.  Am I going to say it's always inaccurate?  It is clearly not always inaccurate.  It clearly was not always inaccurate.  If I were to look up something and find it would I say boy, that's it, that must be exactly it, no.  Nor could anybody say that about anything they put in a diary that they've never seen before, never cleaned up, never edited.<p> <p> Q:   But you think it is better evidence of whether or not something happened than your current recollection, do you not?<p> <p> A:   I'm not even going to say that.<p> <p> Q:   Isn't that what you said in July 1989?<p> <p> A:   Mr. Baird, I am not going to say that this diary is exactly accurate or can be an accurate recollection.  We can read Tom McCall's book as to what he said about it.<p> <p> Q:   You wouldn't say today what you said in 1989, that it might be a better testimony as to what happened than your current memory?<p> <p> A:   All I'm going to say is that - this statement was never intended to be relied upon by anybody for anything, and I'm not going to say - I'm not going to have you say and attempt to put in this record that everything in this diary is accurate.<p> <p> Q:   That's not what I'm attempting to say.  I'm asking you the question: Would you say today what you said at the time of this diary entry, and that is that the diary is better testimony than your present recollection?<p> <p> A:   Not necessarily.</blockquote> <p> <p>      Finally, Senator Packwood testified in January 1995 that it was not necessarily his intent to create a nonfictional account, but he was not lying to his diary.  He stated that he may have put things in that others would recall as totally different.<p> <p>     In contrast, Senator Packwood testified at his earlier deposition in October 1993 that he would frequently refer back to his diary as a "resource document,  that he would use it as a "memory tool," that he had a "strong sense of history," and that he might use it to write a book.  When he was asked about this earlier testimony at his deposition in January 1995, Senator Packwood testified that he did not find his diary nearly as accurate a reference tool as staff memos.  He stated that in the past, he would look back at it from time to time, but that he finally quit, because it did not give him the answer to his questions.  He stated that the diaries were not a reliable reference tool, and to call them a resource tool, as he had in his previous deposition, would be overstated.  He stated that information was missing from the diary, and that there were inaccurate entries, including just about any conversation that was recounted.  Senator Packwood stated that on occasion, he would put things in his diary that just did not happen.<p> <p>     Senator Packwood confirmed that he has left his diaries in trust to the Oregon Historical Society, although he could not recall the purpose of the trust.  He stated that the diary has some historical value, although the Historical Society will not be able to determine which parts of it have value, and which do not.<p> <p>     Senator Packwood appeared to have used his diaries to refresh his recollection about matters to which he testified during his deposition.[fn 126] For example, his testimony at his first deposition in 1993 about the incident with Ms. Hutton in 1980, and about a subsequent occasion when Ms. Hutton joined the road crew in Oregon for pizza and charades, both of which occurred in 1980, very closely tracks diary entries for these occasions.[fn 127] Senator Packwood also testified at his first deposition in 1993 about a conversation with Ms. Williamson in 1969 when she drove him to a Girl Scout function; the Girl Scout function itself is reflected in his diary.[fn 128]  Senator Packwood testified at his first (1993) and second (1995) depositions about the details of the evening of the alleged incident with Complainant 1 in 1990, in which Complainant 1 claims that Senator Packwood kissed her when they returned to his office after an informal staff party at the Irish Times.  Senator Packwood stated that he "pieced together" the details of that evening by talking to others who were present at the Irish Times, as he had had too much to drink to remember anything about the evening.  Yet the diary entry for this evening sets out in some detail the events that took place at the Irish Times and the substance of his conversations with Complainant 1, details that would be known only to Complainant 1 and Senator Packwood. Senator Packwood would not say how he obtained the information that appeared in that entry, whether it was accurate, or whether he intended it to be accurate at the time he recorded it.<p> <p>       In his earlier 1993 deposition, Senator Packwood recounted an evening in October 1991 when Complainant 1 was in his office, and the two of them were drinking wine. He described how he got up from his desk, and Complainant 1 gave him a big hug, a kiss on the lips, and told him "You are wonderful," to which he responded "warts and all." This incident, and the conversation, are recounted in his diary word for word as he testified before the Committee at his 1993 deposition. When asked at his second (1995) deposition if this entry was an accurate recounting of what happened that evening, Senator Packwood testified that he could not say if it was accurate, and that he could not guarantee if the conversation occurred as set out in the diary. When it was pointed out to him that his testimony at his previous deposition matched exactly the conversation as set out in the diary entry, he stated that he could not guarantee that his previous testimony before the Committee was accurate.[fn 129] Finally, he stated that his testimony during his earlier deposition was accurate, and conceded that the diary entry itself was also accurate.<p> <p>       As a general matter, Senator Packwood emphasized that the diaries are different in kind from things such as memos and letters, which may go through many revisions to achieve accuracy. His diaries, in contrast, were dictated, sometimes "on the fly," and transcribed and thereafter almost never reviewed, and were not intended to be relied upon for any specific purpose.<p> <p>         c. Alteration of Diary Tapes<p> <p>           1) Review of Diaries in Late 1992, Early 1993<p> <p>       Senator Packwood testified that in December 1992 or early January 1993, his attorneys asked him to review his diaries for relevant passages having to do with the issue of intimidation of witnesses. He testified that as of early January 1993, he had all of the 1992 diary tapes in his possession, as Ms. Cormack had not caught up to that point in her transcription.[fn 130] Senator Packwood listened to tapes covering from March to early June, and after Labor Day in 1992, and identified a period from October 20 to November 10 for Ms. Cormack to transcribe out of sequence. He recalled that he directed Ms. Cormack to type certain entries from this time period, although he did not recall exactly how he did so - that is, whether his instructions to her were written or on a separate tape, or were incorporated on the tape itself.<p> <p>           2)   Fear of Leaks to the Press<p> <p>       At the same time, as he listened in December 1992 to the audiotapes of the 1992 diary entries, Senator Packwood found entries that he did not want to get out of his hands. He started to become apprehensive at the prospect of turning any portions of his diaries over to his attorneys.  While it was no secret that he kept diaries, and indeed news accounts had previously referred to his diaries, no one but he and Ms. Cormack had ever actually seen them.  He feared that once they went to his attorneys and were out of his hands, they would almost certainly be leaked to the press.  This fear was heightened when he returned to Oregon in January 1993, and he was met with protesters everywhere he went, at times fearing for his personal safety or the safety of his supporters.  He believed that if the press obtained even a few paragraphs of his diary, they would be embarrassing and harmful both to himself and to others who were mentioned in the diaries.  Thus, in early 1993 as he searched for entries in 1992 to provide to his attorneys, he started making changes to the untranscribed tapes for 1992.<p> <p>          3)   Changes Made to the 1992 Tapes<p> <p>     Senator Packwood testified that starting in January 1993, he began to change his untranscribed 1992 tapes, to delete entries that could potentially be embarrassing if obtained by the press. These entries included references to the Oregon Citizens Alliance (OCA), conversations with Committee Members about the Committee inquiry that he thought would suggest a "Republican conspiracy" to the press,[fn 131] comments about his chief of staff, comments about women whose names had not been reported by the press in connection with the allegations of sexual misconduct, and anything that might have caused personal harm or adverse publicity to others.  He also changed embarrassing references to others, including some very descriptive sexual references. According to Senator Packwood, he changed anything that could get to the press and embarrass his friends or other persons.  He testified that this was a "catch as catch can" effort and he did not get everything.[fn 132]<p> <p>     At his January 1995 deposition, Senator Packwood was asked about approximately forty (40) altered diary entries, most of which involved the deletion of information from the original tape and the substitution of new information.<p> <p>     Senator Packwood testified that he sometimes simply deleted entries, and sometimes deleted entries and substituted entries in their place.  He stated that he had no particular reason for sometimes substituting entries in the place of entries he deleted other than his compulsion to fill up the space. These substitutions might be on the same subject matter as the deleted material, or they might be totally different.  When shown one such entry where material was substituted, the Senator testified as follows:<p><blockquote> <p> Q:   Why, Senator, did you feel that all these spaces on the tape that you were creating by eliminating passages had to be filled?<p> <p> A:   I can't answer that.<p> <p> MR. MUSE:  You said "all."  It wasn't all.<p> <p> A:   There's great gaps that are missing.<p> <p> Q:   Why did you feel that some of them had to De filled?<p> <p> A:   I don't know.  Maybe it's just compulsive dictation.  I have no answer to that."</blockquote> <p> <p>     Senator Packwood testified that his sole motivation in making these changes was to prevent the leak of potentially embarrassing or politically damaging information to the press by way of his attorneys' office.[fn 133]<p> <p>     Senator Packwood first stated that he finished making the changes to the 1992 tapes by the end of February 1993.[fn 134] Although he stated that he could have changed his 1993 tapes during this same time, he testified that he did not know if it was going to be necessary, as his attorneys had not asked him to provide any transcripts for 1993.  Indeed, after he provided his attorneys with the transcribed excerpts for October and November 1992, they did not ask him for any more transcripts, per se.[fn 135]<p> <p>     At the same time that he was revising his diary tapes, up through May of 1993, Senator Packwood continued to pinpoint relevant portions of his diaries for his attorneys, some of them referring to the women who had made allegations against him.  If these entries were in portions that had already been transcribed (i.e., 1969-1991) he would provide a copy of the entry to his attorneys.  If the entries had not yet been transcribed, he would send a memo to his attorneys, describing the nature of the entry. Senator Packwood testified that he sent these excerpts in the form of memoranda, which might quote from a diary entry, or might refer to or summarize a diary entry.[fn 136]<p> <p>     During the same time that he was revising his diary tapes for 1992 to delete potentially embarrassing or damaging information, Senator Packwood continued to dictate contemporaneous daily diary entries.  Despite the fact that he was simultaneously deleting potentially embarrassing or politically damaging entries from his 1992 tapes, Senator Packwood continued to dictate entries of the same character, entries he would then delete only months later. At his 1995 deposition, Senator Packwood testified that he did so out of compulsion, and that he could not change his long-standing style of dictation.<blockquote> <p> After you've dictated for twenty five years, you don't consciously think of that as you dictate.  You don't say oh, better not do this, better not do this. It becomes sort of a stream of consciousness thinking."</blockquote> <p>     During his June 1995 appearance before the Committee, the Senator added that since his attorneys had not requested any 1993 entries so he did not feel those entries would ever be requested by them.<p> <p>           4) Changes to the 1993 Tapes<p> <p>       Senator Packwood assumed that he gave Ms. Cormack a fair amount of tapes to transcribe during the spring and summer of 1993, and thinks that she gave him more typed transcript during that same time period. Sometime in mid-summer, or early August of 1993, his attorneys told him that they wanted all of the 1992- 1993 diaries transcribed. Realizing then that the transcripts made from the 1993 tapes could be going to his attorneys, Senator Packwood made changes to them along the same lines as he had changed his 1992 tapes.[fn 137] Senator Packwood made these changes shortly before he left for the August recess in 1993.  He then gave all of the tapes he had, including 1993 up-to-date, to Ms. Cormack to type.[fn 138] He asked her if she could hurry up and get these tapes transcribed.<p> <p>       Again, at the same time, Senator Packwood continued to dictate contemporaneous diary entries of the same character that he was deleting from his previous tapes, out of compulsion and in keeping with his long-standing style of dictation, entries that he would go back and delete only weeks later. At his June 1995 appearance before the Committee, Senator Packwood testified as follows:<blockquote> <p> BY SENATOR MCCONNELL:<p> <p> Q: So some time in the first quarter then of 1993, you were doing some deletions for what you viewed to be embarrassing material?<p> <p> A: Yes. I think I'd probably finished listening to the '92 tapes by late April, mid-April, early May, something like that.<p> <p> Q: And then contemporaneously, you were continuing your practice of dictating?<p> <p> A: Yes.<p> <p> Q: And the continued practice of the dictating also included some embarrassing material, did it not?<p> <p> As Yes.<p> <p> Q: So you were dictating embarrassing material contemporaneously while you were also deleting embarrassing material retroactively?<p> <p> A: Yes. So long as you understand my dictation habits. I'd been dictating this for 25 years and it's a stream of consciousness, pour everything into it, pour my heart into it, and I was not consciously, when I was dictating, think now should this be in there, should this be out. That thought wasn't in my mind. It's only in listening to it, and I was finding things, did I find things that I wanted to take out. Bear in mind, I was kind of hoping, by the time I'd gotten a few months into '93, that they weren't going to ask for anything more, they'd gotten what they wanted, and I was sending them along these memos from '69, ' 80, or wherever I'd find some reference to a complainant, a copy of the diary page that related to that complainant.  And they weren't asking for anything more what I'd call en masse, so when I finished the '92, I kind of crossed my fingers and hoped they wouldn't ask for anything more, wouldn't ask for all of '92 or '93.</blockquote> <p>     Senator Packwood testified that in order to make the changes to his diary tapes for 1992 and 1993, he made a duplicate copy of the tape, and then made the changes to the duplicate.  He then copied the duplicate, giving one copy of the changed tape to Ms. Cormack, and keeping one for himself.  When Ms. Cormack finished typing any given tape, he destroyed his corresponding copy.  He retained the original, unchanged tape.<p> <p> <p>        5)   Senator Packwood Returns to Oregon Over Recess<p> <p>      After giving Ms. Cormack his up-to-date diary tapes to transcribe shortly after the start of the August recess, Senator Packwood then returned to Oregon for the recess, taking with him all of his transcribed diaries from 1969 through 1991.  Senator Packwood testified at his deposition that he was concerned that the press would obtain his diaries, and he took all of his diary transcripts with him to Oregon.  A review of the transcripts prior to February 1992 (as far back as 1989) shows that although there are many entries that would seem to be embarrassing or potentially damaging if leaked to the press, and which fall within the same categories as the changes that Senator Packwood made to the 1992 and 1993 tapes, no changes were made to these (1989 - 1991) transcripts.<p> <p>     In his appearance before the Committee, Senator Packwood testified that he felt no need to delete embarrassing information from his previously transcribed diaries (pre-1992) because he was providing to his attorneys only selected excerpts from these pre- 1992 transcripts, and there was no fear that other pre-1992 transcripts would be requested by his attorneys.<p> <p>     Although Senator Packwood testified that his goal was to remove entries that would be embarrassing to himself or others, in substituting one entry in place of an embarrassing entry he had deleted, Senator Packwood discussed details of the sex life of one of his long-time staffers.  When he was asked why he added an entry that was of the same character as those he was deleting, and how he thought the press might have reacted to that information, Senator Packwood stated that he should not have done it, the entry was factually incorrect, and that in any event it was obviously in jest.[fn 139]  In fact, an entry in Senator Packwood's diary dated June 11, 1992 describes an occasion when he had dinner with this long-time staffer, and she related to him the information that appears in this later, substituted entry.<p> <p>         6)   Senator Packwood Asks Ms. Cormack to Return the 1992 and 1993 Tapes<p> <p>     Very shortly after the end of the 1993 August recess, within a day or two of when he came back to town, Senator Packwood asked Ms. Cormack to give him back the untranscribed tapes.  He testified that he only wanted the 1993 tapes, but Ms. Cormack gave him all of the tapes, including the 1992 tapes, in a bag. Senator Packwood stated that in his rush to make the changes to the 1993 tapes, he had not made a copy of the changed tapes for himself, and he wanted the 1993 tapes back so he could make a copy in case something happened to Ms. Cormack's copy before she had a chance to transcribe it.  He copied the 1993 tapes, and returned all of the tapes to Ms. Cormack within days, in two separate batches.<p> <p>     Senator Packwood testified that he did not use the word "subpoena" during whatever conversation he had with Ms. Cormack about returning the tapes.  He stated that it was possible that he may have used that word during other conversations with her, although he had no reason to use that word, because he was not thinking of the possibility of a subpoena for his diaries.<p> <p>     During August and September, Senator Packwood continued to dictate his diaries, making at least one entry in August that he deleted after the tape was transcribed.<p> <p>     At the time he asked Ms. Cormack to return the tapes, Senator Packwood was somewhat perturbed that Ms. Cormack had done so little on transcribing the diaries.  He again asked her to hurry up, and she typed transcripts during September and October 1993, giving him back pages she had transcribed from the tapes every few days during that time.  Senator Packwood delivered these diary pages to his attorneys as Ms. Cormack finished them.[fn 104] As to the status of her efforts at this time, Senator Packwood testified as follows at his January 1995 deposition:<blockquote> <p> Q:   Over what period of time did she complete her typing of the '92 and '93 tapes?<p> <p> A:   September and October.<p> <p> Q:   Both months, both full months?<p> <p> A:   Yeah.  You know, she's got a full-time job, so she can't type all day long.  There are a lot of tapes, but she finally got at it . . . .</blockquote> <p>     Senator Packwood was aware that as she typed the diaries during September and October 1993, Ms. Cormack left out a lot of material.  She had told him that in order to finish quickly, she needed to consolidate entries, and leave certain things out - for example, entries dealing with hi6 stereo equipment, and his squash games with another Senator.  Senator Packwood indicated to her that she could do so, and he left it to her judgment as to what should be left out of the transcript.<p> <p>     Senator Packwood testified that in response to requests from his attorneys, during the fall of 1993, as Ms. Cormack sought to get the transcripts up to date, he asked her to type certain entries out of sequence.<p> <p>     Senator Packwood testified that as Ms. Cormack finished typing portions of the diary, he erased the corresponding tape in his possession, which was a duplicate of the changed tape used by Ms. Cormack.  Ms. Cormack also erased her copy of the changed tape.  Senator Packwood kept the original tape, even though it did not correspond to the diary transcript, because he had historically kept the "original."<p> <p>      Some time during the fall of 1993, Ms. Cormack asked Senator Packwood, in an offhand sort of way, if he had made changes to the diary tapes.  He confirmed to her, either with words or a smile, that he had done so.<p> <p>          7)   Changes to October and Early November 1993 Tapes<p> <p>         Senator Packwood testified that he made no changes to his diary tapes for September, October, or November 1993.[fn 141] However, Senator Packwood testified that during late October and possibly early November, as the pages of the diary covering late October and early November were typed by Ms. Cormack, he would make changes to them and have Ms. Cormack retype the pages.  He believes, but cannot be sure, that all of these types of changes were made only to entries for October 1993.[fn 142]  Senator Packwood stated that he may have given Ms. Cormack instructions on how to retype these pages on a separate tape, with the entries underlined in yellow on the pages; he did not recall actually redictating the tapes.  Senator Packwood continued to make changes to diary entries dictated after his receipt of the Committee's subpoena, as he did not feel that the subpoena affected his right to edit his post-subpoena diaries as they rolled off the press.<p> <p>     Senator Packwood also continued to erase his copy of the changed diary tape, even after receipt of the Committee's subpoena.  In this regard, he testified at his 1995 deposition as follows:<blockquote> <p> Q:   So the tapes--when she transcribed during October after delivery of the subpoena, any tapes that she transcribed during that period, you would have erased the duplicate of them?<p> <p> A:  Yes, I think so.  I'm quite sure I probably did.  To the extent the transcript is different than the tape, you can tell the original tape from the transcript.  The transcript would be the changed one that she typed from which she erased and I erased and the original would be whatever is in the transcript you have now is [sic].<p> <p> The Senator went on to testify as follows:<p> <p> Q:   Now, as she was completing tapes after your deposition and your awareness that the Committee was reviewing them, after she was completing those, and bringing the transcripts to you, were you then continuing to destroy your copy of the tape which she had transcribed?<p> <p> A:   Yes.<p> <p> Q:   And you presume she was destroying her copy also?<p> <p> A:   That's what she had done for 15 years.  I didn't think about it.  It's just what she had been doing over the years. The thought didn't enter my mind, let's put it that way.<p> <p> *   *   *<p> <p> Q:  And just so I'm clear on this, there was never any instruction, either after the deposition when you understood that the Committee staff was going to be reviewing transcripts being prepared by Cathy Cormack or even later after there had been a subpoena, there was never any instruction from you to Cathy Cormack to say Cathy, don't destroy the tapes as as[sic] you make the transcripts?<p> <p> A:   I don't recall discussing with her at all.<p> <p> Q:   And, in fact, as you have said, you yourself destroyed those tapes during that time period as she returned the transcripts to you?<p> <p> MR. MUSE: I think he followed the same practice with them. And also, there are some copies that are still with Judge Starr that are to be delivered to you that cover this category.<p> <p> Q:   Other than the copies that are with Judge Starr [Note: which turned out to be duplicate unchanged originals], all the other tapes that matched the changed tapes which you had given Cathy Cormack, you destroyed those?<p> <p> A:   That's correct.</blockquote> <p> <p>     As Senator McConnell pointed out at Senator Packwood's June 1995 appearance before the Committee, the destruction of the altered tape by Senator Packwood makes it difficult to determine which changes were made by whom:<blockquote> <p> BY SENATOR MCCONNELL:<p> <p> Q:   You noted that Ms. Cormack made 99 percent of the changes to the diary material in the '92-'93 period?<p> <p> A:   Yes, I think 99 percent would be it, I might be off a percent but I think that would be a fair--by changes, I mean including deletions....<p> <p> Q:   I guess my question is, without a copy of the altered diary tapes, how can we tell who is responsible for which deletions or alterations?  In other words, how do we-- these particular altered tapes, we don't have, is that correct?<p> <p> A:   That's correct.</blockquote> <p> <p>   At his January 1995 deposition, Senator Packwood testified as follows:<blockquote> <p> Q:   And at the time now, once you had received the subpoena and Arnold &amp; Porter had, Cathy Cormack was still processing some of these tapes, was she not?<p> <p> MR. MUSE:  Typing transcripts.<p> <p> BY MR. BAIRD:<p> <p> Q:   Yes typing transcripts from tapes which you had previously given her.<p> <p> A:   Yes, ...certainly she was typing what had come out in October and November.  She was typing things after the subpoena.  I don't know at what stage she finished the backlog.<p> <p> Q:   But she continued typing throughout the rest of October and on into November?<p> <p> A:   Into early November, yeah.<p> <p> Q:   Once you got the subpoena, did you go to Cathy Cormack and suggest any changes in her handling of the tapes which she had had?<p> <p> A:   No, I didn't.<p> <p> Q:   Because I think you have told us earlier that it's possible that during this time, she was still typing on 1992 or 1993 tapes, that that's possible?<p> <p> A:   She could have been because I remember there was a portion of '92 tapes. I think it's early on, February and March where I never found anything, and it wasn't of consequence to them.  We'd get to it, but it wasn't as important to the lawyers I guess as some other period.  She could have been into the first three or four months of '93 and not have done the first three or four months of '92 or something like that.<p> <p> *   *   *<p> <p> Q:   But in any event, your process, that is Cathy Cormack typing the tape, sending the transcript to you and your then destroying the tape that related to that transcript--<p> <p> A:   My copy of that tape.<p> <p> Q:   --copy of that tape did not change after you received the Committee's subpoena; is that correct?<p> <p> A:   To the best of my knowledge, it did not because I would not have destroyed the tape until I got the transcript from Cathy in case something went wrong with her tape.<p> <p> Q:   So if, in fact, Cathy Cormack transcribed tapes covering the period of 1992 and returned that transcript to you after October 21 of '93, you would have destroyed the corresponding tape?<p> <p> A:   I think so.  The reason I say I think so, there was some extra tapes left over that I may not have gotten-- I think they're September, October and November and they appear to be around.  And whether I just didn't get to it or not, by this time we're into a totally different issue of the law and whether you have a legal right to the diaries and that whole battle had started, but it was my normal practice, I think to get rid of them.</blockquote> <p> <p>     Senator Packwood testified that sometime shortly after his deposition was interrupted in early October 1993, he delivered the entire typed transcript to his attorneys.  Thereafter, as Ms. Cormack finished-typing entries, he provided them to his attorneys.  He did not, however, tell his attorneys that these transcripts had been typed from altered tapes.  At his June 1995 appearance before the Committee he testified as follows on this point:<blockquote> <p> BY SENATOR BRYAN<p> <p> Q.  Did you at any time provide any diary information to your attorneys that had been changed--and I'm defining "change" as either a deletion, a substitution, or addition--without telling them that, look, I did change this from the original.<p> <p> A.  Yes.  I'm sure that must have happened because they were getting these jumping-about portions of 92 and 93, many of which, or some of which had changes on them.</blockquote> <p> <p>       The testimony goes on to clarify that his attorneys were not told about any changes until after the Department of Justice subpoena of November 19, 1993.<p> <p>     In his appearance before the Committee, Senator Packwood testified that if the Committee had gotten up to 1992 in its review of his diaries, he would not have let the Committee review the altered transcripts, and he would have notified his attorneys that he had changed the tapes.  However, even as the Committee staff was reviewing his already transcribed diaries during the second week of October, Ms. Cormack was typing the 1992 and 1993 transcripts <STRONG>from the altered tapes</STRONG>, as evidenced by the testimony below from the Senator's January 1995 deposition.<blockquote> <p> Q:  Sometime that week after your deposition, you would have understood, though, that we were, in fact, after your attorneys had masked certain materials, that the Ethics Committee staff was reviewing your diaries beginning in 1969 and working our way back to the present, meanwhile Cathy Cormack is continuing to produce transcript for you; correct?<p> <p> A:   Yes.<p> <p> Q:   Did you understand that the Ethics Committee staff would also be reviewing the transcripts which Cathy Cormack was then preparing once those had been masked by your attorneys?<p> <p> A:   Assuming you had gotten to those, yes.<p> <p> *   *   *<p> <p> Q:   In any event, you did not consider, I take it, once you knew that the Committee would be reviewing the transcript which was being produced by Cathy Cormack, you did not consider having her transcribe from the original as opposed to the changed?<p> <p> A:   No.<p> <p> *   *   *<p> <p> Q:  When she was in this period after your deposition, she was typing from changed tapes?<p> <p> A:   Yes.</blockquote> <p>      On October 20, 1993, Senator Packwood's attorneys informed the Committee that about half of the 1992 tapes had been typed, and would be available for review shortly, and that the rest of the tapes for 1992 were in the process of being typed and reviewed.  Thus, it appears that at least some of the changed tapes covering 1992 and 1993 were typed after the Senator received the Committee's subpoena on October 21, 1993 and that those tapes were destroyed after that date.<p> <p>         8)   Senator Packwood Reviews Transcripts for Passages Reflecting Criminal Conduct<p> <p>     Shortly after the floor debate over the subpoena for his diaries, when Senator Packwood became aware that the Committee was earmarking passages in his diaries dealing with potentially criminal conduct,[fn 143] he retrieved his diary transcripts from his attorneys,[fn 144] to look for any entries that might possibly relate to criminal conduct that would be within the Committee's jurisdiction.  He returned the diaries to his attorneys within about a week.<p> <p>     Senator Packwood testified that his attorneys were not aware that he kept backup tapes for his diaries.  In his appearance before the Committee, Senator Packwood testified that he told his attorneys about the backup tapes only after he received a subpoena from the Department of Justice on November 19, 1993.  He stated that because the Department of Justice subpoena could concern criminal matters, he thought the Department of Justice would want the original tapes.[fn 145]<p> <p>          9)   Why Senator Packwood Felt Free to Change His Diaries<p> <p>     Senator Packwood testified at his January 1995 deposition that he provided his attorneys with relevant excerpts from his diaries, but that they never turned any of them over to the Committee in response to the document requests. Senator Packwood therefore concluded that the Committee did not have any right to them.  He also testified that even after he received the Committee's subpoena, he never imagined that he could not go back and edit his diaries as they were being transcribed by Ms. Cormack.  In this regard, Senator Packwood testified as follows:<blockquote> <p> Q:   We had talked just briefly about editing you might have done to transcripts which you are getting back during this period, and I think your lawyer, Mr. Stein, suggested that perhaps we should parse the time periods from before your deposition and after your deposition in terms of editing, and I want to focus on that just for a moment. You had said...that with respect to diary entries after the deposition, after you were aware that the Committee was reviewing the tape [sic], the transcripts being prepared by Cathy Cormack, I believe you had testified, had you not, that you still felt free to edit entries which were made after the deposition?<p> <p> As   Yes.  It never occurred to me that something that I dictate is forever frozen in time, and I can never edit it or make a change in it.<p> <p> Q:   How about for entries which occurred before the date of the deposition--<p> <p> MR. MUSE:  What's the question?<p> <p> MR. BAIRD:  I haven't asked it yet.<p> <p> Q:  For the time period of tapes which predated your deposition, when those were processed by Ms. Cormack and returned to YOU after the deposition, did you feel free to edit those transcripts?<p> <p> MR. MUSE:  Victor, you're asking him did he feel free, did he have consciousness of doing one thing or another or not doing one thing or another? The problem I have is you're asking him what was his mental state about those.<p> <p> MR. BAIRD:  Yes.<p> <p> A:   I didn't have a mental state one way or the other. They didn't come back, and I didn't consciously think to myself I can't change these or I can change these.  It all kind of fluxes together so there was no thought.<p> <p> Q:   But I believe you told us it is possible you may have edited--<p> <p> A:   Yes, I may have.<p> <p> Q:   --some of those after you knew that the transcripts were going to be reviewed by the Ethics Committee staff?<p> <p> A:   I may have.  Could I have?  Yes.  I'm sitting there with diary entries on my desk and my desk piled up and these transcripts are coming back from Cath and am I looking through them.  Could I have looked at some, taken it back to her?  I could have.  I don't know if I did, but I could have.<p> <p> Q:   And let's go up to the point of the subpoena.  Does the situation change any once you have the subpoena, or was that still--did the process remain the same, that is you could have changed the transcript that she had given you-- had she given you any transcript, say, from 1992 that she had done after the subpoena had been served, that you might possibly have changed that and given it back to her to make further changes?<p> <p> A:   Again, I have no recollection.  I could have, but I'm just trying--this is such a confusing period for me in addition to buying my townhouse at the same time or moving in.  Yes, I could have.</blockquote> <p> <p>     At other times during his January 1995 deposition, Senator Packwood testified that while it was possible that he changed transcripts for entries which predated his October 1993 deposition after the deposition and after receiving the Committee's subpoena, he did not think that this had occurred.<p> <p>     Senator Packwood went on to testify at his January 1995 deposition that he did not intend to prevent the Committee from reviewing any information in either the original tapes or the previously transcribed transcripts.  He reiterated that he was concerned about leaks to the press.  He also testified that the Committee eventually received the original audiotapes.[fn 146]<p> <p>     In his appearance before the Committee in June 1995, Senator Packwood testified, in response to questioning, that he relied on the advice of his attorneys in making changes to his diaries: because his attorneys had determined that the Committee was not entitled to his diaries, he felt free to do with them whatever he wished.  However, Senator Packwood could not articulate precisely what his attorneys had told him on this issue.  He repeatedly stated that he and his attorneys discussed and argued over what he was required to turn over to the Committee, but that there was little discussion about what he was not required to turn over. He did state, however, that the earliest that such discussions occurred - that is, about whether the Committee was entitled to his diaries - was after the Committee's document request of March 29, 1993, at least a full two months after he had been making changes to his diaries.<p> <p>     Also in his appearance before the Committee, Senator Packwood testified that at some stage he had gotten a letter from the Committee saying that the subpoena would only run to July 18, 1993, and to the extent he made any changes after he received that letter, he would have assumed that he could make any changes that he wanted to entries dated after that date.  In fact, the Committee did send Senator Packwood a letter, informing him that although the subpoena called for all diaries up to the date of the subpoena (October 20, 1993), if he wanted to voluntarily produce his diaries pursuant to a procedure similar to the original agreement, the cutoff date of the subpoena would be pushed back to July 18, 1993.  However, this letter was not delivered until November 9, 1993, and so could not have been a factor in any changes made before that.  And, according to the Senator, the only things he would have changed at that time would have been diary entries made after October 20, 1993.<p> <p> <p>  <p> <H3>Endnotes</H3><tt><font size=-1> <p>  109.   Not included in these three categories are differences that are minor, and appear to be the result of transcriber error or editing, such as cleaning up grammar and taking out repetitions.<p> <p> 110.   James Fitzpatrick, one of Senator Packwood's attorneys at Arnold &amp; Porter, testified that he could not recall making any request for copies of Senator Packwood's diary pages, per se. Rather, Senator Packwood was requested to and did provide his lawyers with a broad range of information to assist them in representing him, including his recollection, memoranda, clippings, and summaries of or excerpts from his diaries.<p> <p> 111.  Mr. Fitzpatrick testified that he could not specifically recall asking Senator Packwood to get the rest of his diaries transcribed. Steven Sacks, another attorney at Arnold &amp; Porter, after consulting with Senator Packwood's current attorneys, represented that no one who worked on Senator Packwood's matter at Arnold &amp; Porter could recall when this request was made, but that July or August 1993 sounded "about right."<p> <p> 112.  In one instance, Senator Packwood deleted an entry that would be very embarrassing to him and one of his staff members if it became public, but substituted in its place an entry that also would have been very embarrassing to a different staff member if it became public.<p> <p> 113.  Senator Packwood testified that when he changed the 1992 and 1993 tapes, he made a duplicate of the original tape, and made the changes on the duplicate. He then made a copy of this changed tape, which he gave to Ms. Cormack to type. When she completed typing the tape, she destroyed hers, and he destroyed his.<p> <p> 114.  These diaries cover 1969 through January of 1992.<p> <p> 115.  Senator Packwood did not inform his attorneys that the transcripts he was delivering to them for 1992 and 1993 had been typed by Ms. Cormack from the altered tape, and not from the original, contemporaneous tape.<p> <p> 116.  A letter ~from Senator Packwood's attorneys to the Committee, dated October 20, 1993,  indicates that approximately half of 1992 was typed after that date.  This is consistent with Ms. Cormack's testimony in which she indicated that during mid to late October, she was really pushing to get the diaries transcribed.<p> <p> 117.  For the years 1989, 1990, and 1991, these backup tapes would correspond with the written transcript.  For 1992 and 1993, however, they would not, because they were typed from a duplicate of the original, on which Senator Packwood had made the changes. This duplicate was destroyed after it was transcribed.<p> <p> 118.  Indeed, the Cormack transcripts received by the Committee are not numbered after January 1992.<p> <p> 119.  In her second deposition, taken in December 1993, Ms. Cormack could not place the time of this conversation any more precisely than sometime between early September and mid to late October, although she was asked several times, and in several different ways, to do so.  When her deposition was taken again a year later, in December 1994, Ms. Cormack recalled that this conversation took place in early September.<p> <p> 120.  Ms. Cormack did not complete her transcription until at least November 9, 1993, which was the last date she transcribed.<p> <p> 121.  The diaries themselves strongly suggest that Senator Packwood and Ms. Cormack had a very close personal relationship.<p> <p> 122.  Senator Packwood testified that Ms. Cormack did "modest" work for him, although he could not recall what it was. In contrast, Ms. Cormack testified that after she left Senator Packwood's staff, she performed no work for him other than transcribing his diaries. <p> <p> 123.  Senator Packwood testified that he sometimes made another duplicate, if for some reason he thought the original tape might be of poor quality.<p> <p> 124.   Ms. Cormack testified that historically, Senator Packwood asked her to make changes in the typed transcript no more than five times.<p> <p> 125.   This was a calendar in which Senator Packwood recorded his activities for the day after the fact, as opposed to a calendar which listed his appointments.<p> <p> 126.  Senator Packwood confirmed, as do his diary entries, that he reviewed his diaries before his 1993 deposition.<p> <p> 127.  Senator Packwood testified that he had an independent recollection of these occasions.<p> <p> 128.  Senator Packwood testified that he had an independent recollection of this 1969 event and conversation.<p> <p> 129.  Senator Packwood also recounted this incident, and the conversation, word for word, in early November 1993 during debate on the Senate floor over the subpoena for his diaries.<p> <p> 130.  Ms. Cormack testified that at the time Senator Packwood asked her to type entries out of sequence, she had "some" tapes for 1992, possibly tapes going up to, but not covering the period surrounding the general election. Ms. Cormack also testified that when she typed the entries out of sequence for Senator Packwood in early January 1993, she did not number the pages. The Cormack transcripts are numbered up through the end of January 1992.<p> <p> 131.  About fifteen (15) entries concerning communications with Committee Members, mostly Senator McConnell, appeared to have been changed, some by deletion, others by deletion and substitution of new language.<p> <p> 132.  In fact, a review of the transcripts prepared from the 1992 and 1993 tapes shows that many entries which would have been highly embarrassing were not changed.<p> <p> 133.  There is no evidence to suggest that any diary material was ever leaked by Senator Packwood's attorneys or their office.<p> <p> 134.  Later in his deposition, Senator Packwood stated that he finished making the changes to the 1992 tapes by the end of February or March, or in early April, 1993.<p> <p> 135.  Although Senator Packwood forwarded excerpts that he selected from his diaries to his attorneys through the spring of 1993, his attorneys did not ask him to turn over any portion of his diaries in toto until after the Committee specifically requested them in October 1993. The exception to this was the diaries for the October-November 1992 period which the Senator provided to his lawyers sometime in January 1993.  The Senator testified that after he provided these diaries, his attorneys told him to stop transcribing his 1992-93 tapes.<p> <p> 136.  These memoranda were withheld from the Committee on the grounds of attorney-client and work-product privilege.<p> <p> 137.  Senator Packwood also testified that he deleted entries in which he recorded unflattering comments about his attorneys, a friend, and his marriage counselor.<p> <p> 138.  Senator Packwood thought that Ms. Cormack had the 1992 tapes by this time.<p> <p> 139.  At his appearance before the Committee, Senator Packwood repeated that he had made up this entry about his long-time staffer, and that she had never told him about her private life as reflected in the substituted entry.<p> <p> 140.  According to Senator Packwood's attorneys, they received the first set of transcripts from Senator Packwood on October 7, 1993.  These transcripts, which were numbered, covered 1969 through January 1992.<p> <p> 141.  It appears that the tapes that Senator Packwood gave Ms. Cormack in early August prior to departure on recess would have brought him up to August 5, since there is a tape which ends August 5, 1993 and a new tape which begins on August 5, 1993 and extends well into the August recess.  The tape that covers the August time period after August 5, which was not included in the group given to Ms. Cormack because it was still in use by Senator Packwood, had several entries that were changed.  Senator Packwood testified that he made these changes when he was finished with that tape, after he came back from recess.<p> <p> 142.  There are only two entries in September, October, and November 1993 where a passage appearing on the tape does not appear on the Cormack transcript, and a different passage is substituted.  These entries appear on October 9 and 10, 1993.<p> <p> 143.  On the evening of November 1, 1993, after the first day of floor debate, the Senator, his attorneys, the Chairman and Vice Chairman, and staff counsel met to discuss a proposal by Senator Packwood for production of his diaries. Senator Packwood testified that this meeting was the first time he became aware of the nature of the potential criminal activity that the Committee was interested in.  This precise information had been provided to Senator Packwood's attorneys by staff on October 18, 1993.<p> <p> 144.   Senator Packwood's diary indicates that he retrieved his diaries from his attorneys on October 31, 1993, which he confirmed at his deposition.  He stated that at that time he took the volumes for 1989, 1990, and 1991.<p> <p> 145.  The Committee's subpoena, which Senator Packwood received almost a month earlier, specifically asked for all diaries, both tapes and transcripts for the period from November 1, 1989 to October 20, 1993.<p> <p> 146.  Of course, the Committee did not have access to the original audiotapes until after the matter was litigated to the Supreme Court and Senator Packwood was ordered to produce them.<p> <p> </tt></font>><P><UL><UL> <a href=pack1.htm#tab><LI><I>To table of contents</I></a><br> <a href=pack4.htm><LI><I>To next section</I></a></ul></ul><center>  <hr size=7><P>Released through<H3>LEXIS COUNSEL CONNECT</H3> LEXIS COUNSEL CONNECT is a communications and information service for attorneys.

LCC is managed by American Lawyer Media, L.P.<P><hr size=7><p></center> <H2>VI.  EVIDENCE REGARDING THE ALLEGATIONS OF SOLICITING EMPLOYMENT FOR SENATOR PACKWOOD'S SPOUSE</H2><p> <p>     The evidence relating to the issue of whether Senator Packwood may have inappropriately linked personal financial gain to his official position by soliciting or otherwise encouraging offers of financial assistance from persons having a particular interest in legislation or issues that he could influence is set forth below.[fn 172]<p> <p> <H3>A.   Steve Saunders:</H3><p> <p>      <H4>1.   Background:</H4><p> <p>     Steve Saunders worked for Senator Packwood from 1977 until 1981.  From 1977 until January, 1979, he was the Director of Communications for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which Senator Packwood chaired.  From 1979 until 1981, he was the Staff Director of the Senate Republican Conference, which Senator Packwood also chaired.  In May, 1982, he established his own consulting firm.  He is currently the sole proprietor of an international trade consulting firm; a sculpture export business, which markets the work of American sculptors in the U.S. and overseas; and a retail art gallery.  He has been close friends with both Senator and Mrs. Packwood for roughly sixteen years. He is a registered foreign agent for the Mitsubishi Electric Corporation ("Mitsubishi").<p> <p>      <H4>2.  The November 1989 Diary Entries:</H4><p> <p>     The most significant diary entries relating to Mr. Saunders are dated November 3 and November 6, 1989, respectively.  The November 3 entry provides, in pertinent part, as follows:<blockquote> <p> Saunders arrived and he and I went over to the Tortilla Coast or whatever that place is for beers.  I drank two quickly and I said, "Steve, I need to talk about the purpose of the meeting." Steve said, "I think I  know.  You and Georgie are splitting."  I said, "Well, I think we're going to separate and I kind of want to know if you could be of some help."  He said, "In what fashion."  I said, "I don't know how much your firm makes."  He says, "We're doing $600 to $700 thousand a year now."  I said I wonder if you can put Georgie on a retainer." He says "How much?"  I said, "$7500 a year."  He says, "$7500 a year ???"  I said, "Yeah."  He said, "Consider it done.   When he said `yeah' I think he thought I was going to say a month.  He said, "I'd be happy to do it."...But in any event, I've now got her $20,000.  $7500 from Ron, $7500 from Steve, $5000 from [name omitted].[fn 173]<p></blockquote> <p>      Three days later, on Monday, November 6, 1989, Senator Packwood recorded the following in his diary:<blockquote> <p> At a request of Steve Saunders I stopped in at the Finance Committee to read two questions which I wanted asked of a man named Spero, the President of Fusion something or other. This guy's been carrying on a vendetta with the Japanese about patents for years, first in the Commerce Committee with Jay Rockefeller pushing it there and then in the Finance Committee with Jay pushing it again.  It's funny. Fusion is in Maryland.  I don't know what the connection is with West Virginia.  Steve Saunders thinks that Jay is just genuinely concerned but he keeps pushing and pushing this issue so I said of course I'd go and ask the questions.[fn 174]</blockquote> <p>        A transcript of the November 6, 1989 Finance Committee hearing indicates that Senator Packwood briefly attended the hearing, read two questions he wanted asked of Mr. Spero into the record, and then left.[fn 175] Documents produced by Mr. Saunders indicate that questions virtually identical to the ones asked by Senator Packwood at the hearing were submitted to a Finance Committee staffer by Mr. Saunders on November 6, 1989.[fn 176] In other documents submitted by Mr. Saunders, he advised his client Mitsubishi that Senator Packwood was not originally scheduled to attend the hearing and rearranged his schedule at the last minute because Mr. Saunders asked him to appear.[fn 177]<p> <p>      <H4>3. Senator Packwood's Testimony:</H4><p> <p>       At his deposition, Senator Packwood testified that on November 3, he had been drinking in the office before Mr. Saunders arrived. He stated that he drank a lot very quickly and was quite drunk, but he does remember going with Mr. Saunders to Tortilla Coast. He stated that he thinks they discussed Mr. Saunders hiring Mrs. Packwood, but he emphasized that this was - drunken evening for him.<p> <p>       Senator Packwood testified that he does not recall any of the specific conversation recorded in the November 3, 1989 diary entry. He stated that he thinks the meeting was held at his behest. The Senator stated that when Mr. Saunders and he and Mrs. Packwood had been in Asia the year before, he had discussed his marital situation with Mr. Saunders and he had offered to help. Referring to the November 3 entry, Senator Packwood stated that "whether I said exactly this or not, I think I asked him if he was prepared to sort of follow up on what he had said." Senator Packwood testified that he cannot recall whether they specifically discussed Mr. Saunders employing Mrs. Packwood prior to the November 3 meeting. Rather, he only recalls the offer to help, as the colloquy below demonstrates:<blockquote> <p> Q: Just to clarify, Senator, in terms of your discussions with Mr. Saunders, I believe you had said that you had had a conversation with Mr. Saunders prior to this time [Nov. 3] in which there was some discussion about employing Mrs. Packwood: is that correct?<p> <p> A: That, I can't remember. Because I remember the gallery part. And whether it was before this or not--what I remember, Steve was a good friend. He knew about my marital troubles and had offered to help. Whether or not at that stage he says I'm opening an art gallery, I can't remember. But it was the offer to help that I recall.<p> <p> Q:  And when you say here I wonder if you can put Georgie on a retainer, as I understand your testimony, you simply can't recall whether you said that or not?<p> <p> A:  I don't recall any of the specific conversation.<p> <p> Q:  But given the context of what you described, I presume that it's possible that was said?<p> <p> A:  Well, what I remember is talking to him about a job. Beyond that, I can't remember.</blockquote><p>     Senator Packwood testified that he has no memory of any discussion at the November 3 meeting of the upcoming hearing on patents before the Finance Committee.  Nor does he recall whether Mr. Saunders offered him any written materials in connection with the hearing on patents.  He does not recall any discussion of Mitsubishi on November 3, although he was aware of Mr. Saunder's representation of Mitsubishi. The Senator testified that the Mitsubishi/Fusion issue was one that he had been working on for about 18 months as of November, 1989.  He stated that he believed Fusion was inappropriately using Congressional hearings as a forum for complaining because they were unsuccessful in their commercial dispute with Mitsubishi.<p> <p>     Turning to the November 6, 1989 entry, Senator Packwood testified that he does not remember Mr. Saunders calling him to request that he attend the hearing.  He testified that, "He [Saunders] may have called and said would you mind asking him [Spero] personally."   When questioned further about the entry and why he attended the hearing, Senator Packwood responded as follows<blockquote> <p> Q:  Is that what you think you meant by "at a request of Steve Saunders?"<p> <p> A:  Well, I don't remember the phone call.  I don't remember the questions, other than apparently they were questions I was going to submit, I would judge, the way this reads.  And whether he called and said would you mind asking him personally or not, I don't know.  This is a common thing that all of us do.  If someone calls us up--apparently these are questions my staff did, but quite frequently you'll get questions from lobbyists that send you in questions and say will you go in and ask this.<p> <p> Q:  Would it be fair to say that Mr. Saunders is the one that brought the dispute between Mitsubishi and Fusion to your attention?<p> <p> A:  He may have been the one that initially brought it to my attention 18 months or so ago.<p> <p> Q:  Do you recall specifically whether it was him or someone with his organization?<p> <p> A:  No, I don't recall.<p> <p> Q:  And again, to the language at the very first sentence where you say "at a request of Steve Saunders," I believe you touched on this, but let me be sure I understand.  Do you recall any type of written or telephonic communication from Mr. Saunders where he actually made the request for you to attend this committee hearing and ask these questions?<p> <p> A:  No, I don't....</blockquote> <p>     With respect to his handwritten calendar of events, which contains an entry that reads "Finance for Saunders," Senator Packwood denied that there was a connection between attending the hearing and Mr. Saunders:<blockquote> <p> Q:  That would suggest that in your mind, there was connection between attending that hearing and Steve Saunders; is that correct?<p> <p> A:   No. I think it is more likely that if he'd [Saunders] called me up and ask me to go ask the questions as opposed to my just handing them in and asking whoever was chairing the hearing that day, that I went up and asked the questions.  Not that I was attending the meeting for him. This was an issue I'd been following for this long period of time.  And I knew this guy Spero was going to be there, but I apparently had not intended to go to the meeting, but just turn the questions in and maybe Steve said please go ask them personally so I put this entry in.<p> <p> Q:  Do you believe you would have personally attended the hearing but for Mr. Saunders request?<p> <p> A:  That I can't remember now.<p> <p> Q:  So as I understand it, there wasn't a question as to whether you were going to have these questions asked, but rather a question if you would personally attend and ask the questions; is that correct, as opposed to submitting them in writing?<p> <p> A: Yes, although "personally attend" doesn't necessarily mean stay at the meeting . . . .</blockquote> <p>     Senator Packwood testified that he does not recall any discussion with Mr. Saunders about any type of connection or relationship between Mr. Saunder's hiring Mrs. Packwood and the questions that he wanted asked at the November 6 hearing. Nor was there any type of implicit understanding that there was a connection or relationship between his discussions with Mr. Saunders about hiring Mrs. Packwood and the questions he wanted asked at the November 6 hearing.  In this regard, Senator Packwood testified as follows:<blockquote> <p> Q:  ...do you believe that there was a connection between your discussions with Mr. Saunders about employment opportunities for Mrs. Packwood and his request of you to ask certain questions at this hearing?<p> <p> A:  Absolutely not.  Steve was a close friend, had been for a decade and a quarter.  I'd travelled with him.   I'd worked on this issue with him for 18 months, and I would have done this if I would have never met with him on Friday night.</blockquote> <p>      <H4>4.   Brief History of Senator Packwood's Involvement in the Japanese Patent Issue:</H4><p> <p>     In a letter dated November 16, 1993 to Mr. Brooks Jackson of CNN, Senator Packwood provided a history of his involvement in the Japanese patent issue. He explained that his interest in this issue began around June of 1988 when he was preparing for a hearing before the Senate Commerce Committee's Subcommittee on Foreign Commerce and Tourism.  In preparation of this hearing, he stated that his staff had described the dispute between Fusion Systems and Mitsubishi and Mitsubishi's hope that the hearing would focus on larger policy issues. During the course of this hearing, Senator Packwood asked U.S. government officials how the U.S. patent system stacked up against the systems of other countries.  He also requested an additional hearing to hear from U.S. companies who had some success working with the Japanese patent system.<p> <p>     In his November 16 letter, Senator Packwood goes on to state that on January 27, 1989, during the confirmation hearings on the nomination of Carla Hills to U.S. Trade Representative before the Senate Finance Committee, he asked Ms. Hills to speak with experts in the patent area before making any decisions on issues involving the Japanese patent office.  Then, on February 28, 1989, the Commerce Committee's Subcommittee on Foreign Commerce and Tourism held its second hearing on the Japanese patent system.   At this hearing, he again asked U.S. government officials whether the U.S. patent system or the Japanese patent system was more in line with the rest of the industrialized world.[fn 178]<p> <p>     Senator Packwood concludes his letter by asserting that he has had a longstanding interest in intellectual property issues. He states that during the 1988-89 hearings, he kept hearing how the Japanese system was unfair and discriminatory.  However, he discovered that the Japanese patent system was more in step with the rest of the industrialized world than the U.S. system. He states that his efforts were an attempt to ensure balance in the review of the patent issue.<p> <p>       <H4>5.   Mr. Saunders's Testimony:</H4><p> <p>     Mr. Saunders recalls that in the 1980's, his firm was retained by Mitsubishi to advise it on various trade issues.  In 1987 or 1988, his company began working with Mitsubishi's Washington lawyers, lobbyists and public relations advisors regarding a dispute between Mitsubishi and a Maryland company called Fusion.  According to Mr. Saunders, Mitsubishi had been attempting to negotiate a settlement of a dispute with Fusion over patents in Japan for several years.  The head of Fusion, a Mr. Spero, decided that he wanted to try to apply additional pressure on Mitsubishi to reach a favorable settlement.  Spero engaged the interest of the office of the U.S. Trade Representative, which ultimately resulted in the Deputy U.S.T.R. telling Mitsubishi executives that they should settle their dispute with Fusion on terms favorable to Fusion because the issue had become political in the United States.  Mr. Saunders claims that he advised Mitsubishi that in the case of a home- grown American entrepreneur fighting a Goliath Japanese company, the best Mitsubishi could hope to accomplish was keeping the record straight.  It was decided that the best way to deal with the publicity generated by Mr. Spero's efforts was to present the facts about the functions of the Japanese patent system and the Mitsubishi/Fusion dispute to members and staff of the Senate Commerce and Finance Committees.<p> <p>     Mr. Saunders recalls that during 1988, various persons associated with the firms retained by Mitsubishi met several times with Senator Packwood and members of his staff.  Mr. Saunders sat in on at least two of these meetings during 1988 and 1989, which were arranged by Mitsubishi's lobbying firm, Thompson &amp; Co.  Mr. Saunders got involved because it became apparent that they needed to contact Senator Packwood, who was a senior member of the Commerce Committee and a leading free trader.  He stated that his firm became involved because there had been a history of poor relations between the Senator and Bob Thompson of Thompson &amp; Co.  Mr. Saunders stated that Senator Packwood became very interested in the differences between the U.S. patent system and the patent systems used by other countries, including Japan.  The Senator was not interested in the details of the dispute between Mitsubishi and Fusion.<p> <p>        On November 3, 1989, Mr. Saunders stated that he and Senator Packwood had dinner at a Mexican restaurant on Capitol. Hill.  He testified that he believes Senator Packwood was impaired by the alcohol he consumed at this dinner, although he described the Senator as a "functional alcoholic."  Mr. Saunders claims that they did not discuss business matters whatsoever, including the upcoming November 6 hearing.  There was no discussion of Mitsubishi or Fusion or the patent issue.  Rather, he maintains they only discussed their families and personal lives.  He testified that the Senator asked him what he was doing in his business and Mr. Saunders told him about his plans to start a sculpture exporting business and an art gallery.  He testified that the Senator asked him how much his :business was making and Mr. Saunders told him "$600,000 to $700,000 a year."<p> <p>     Senator Packwood then told him that he and his wife were going to divorce. He testified that the Senator told him that he wanted to "simplify his life" and that he was "tired of carrying all these people (i.e., his wife and children)."  Although there had been some discussion of divorce in Asia the year before, Mr. Saunders stated that there was no discussion of employment for the Senator's wife at that time.  The Senator also told Mr. Saunders that he had not yet told his wife about his plans to divorce and asked him not to say anything to her.  Mr. Saunders asked what Mrs. Packwood would do and the Senator responded that he did not know.  Mr. Saunders recalls that Senator Packwood then stated that he was a little worried about Mrs. Packwood's future sources of income.  He told Senator Packwood that he did not think he had any reason to worry because Mrs. Packwood had been operating a successful antique business for several years and was talented in the buying and selling of antiques.<p> <p>     Mr. Saunders recalls that he told Senator Packwood that he had been thinking about calling Mrs. Packwood to help him with his new venture of marketing American sculpture in Japan.  At that time, Mr. Saunders was in the process of setting up his sculpture exporting business and was in the beginning stages of setting up his gallery.  It had occurred to him that Mrs. Packwood would be valuable to him because he believed that Mrs. Packwood's skill in the antique business was easily transferable to the contemporary art business.  He testified that he initiated the idea of Mrs. Packwood working for him and that the Senator did not suggest such an arrangement.  Mr. Saunders stated that he did not think the Senator was trying to solicit an offer of employment for his wife during this dinner.<p> <p>     Mr. Saunders testified that he specifically asked whether the Senator had any ethical problem with the idea because he was a registered foreign agent, and the Senator said no.  The Senator asked him to keep him informed of the status of his discussions with Mrs. Packwood.<p> <p>     Mr. Saunders recalls that Senator Packwood asked how much money his wife could earn working for him.  He advised the Senator that this would depend on how much time she wanted to work and what type of wage or commission arrangement she wanted to negotiate.  Senator Packwood asked if she could make at least $7,500 a year.  Mr. Saunders said that he thought she could easily make $7500 a year, although it struck him as somewhat of an odd figure.  Mr. Saunders does not recall ever discussing putting Mrs. Packwood on a retainer.<p> <p>     On the morning of the November 6, 1989 hearing, Mr. Saunders testified that he heard that Senator Packwood would not be able to attend due to scheduling conflicts.  He called Senator Packwood and urged him to at least stop in at the hearing and read the questions that he had submitted into the record. Senator Packwood said he was unsure whether he could and asked whether he had received the questions.  Mr. Saunders testified that he had submitted proposed questions for the Senator to ask at the hearing to a staffer named Rolf Lundberg.  He does not recall having any discussions with the Senator about the Fusion issue after the November 6 hearing.  Mr. Saunders testified that he never had any discussion with the Senator about attending the hearing or asking questions at the hearing in connection with the employment proposal for Mrs. Packwood.<p> <p>     Mr. Saunders recalls that he called Mrs. Packwood soon after his dinner with Senator Packwood to discuss his proposal.  Over the next several months, Mr. Saunders spoke with Mrs. Packwood several times about the possibility of her helping him with the entity that would become his sculpture business and eventually, with his art gallery.  Some time in March or April of 1990, they got together to discuss his proposal in detail.  In June, 1990, Mr. Saunders arranged for Mrs. Packwood to attend several sessions of the International Sculpture Conference in Washington, D.C. to see whether she would feel comfortable with the contemporary art business.  Mr. Saunders recalls that after attending the conference, Mrs. Packwood told him she was not comfortable with contemporary sculpture and felt it was too far removed from her field. She indicated that she would be willing, however, to arrange antique buying trips and gallery visits for visiting clients of his consulting firm and their wives if there were any opportunities for that kind of work.<p> <p>     By June of 1990, Mr. Saunders had heard from Mrs. Packwood that other friends had spontaneously offered her jobs.  She was persuaded that most of the people making her offers were asked to do so by the Senator in order to reduce the potential demand for alimony.  It was at this time that she indicated that she thought Mr. Saunders was being used by the Senator.  In one of his last conversations with the Senator about this subject, Mr. Saunders testified that the Senator became extremely interested in how much money his wife could earn. The Senator then stated that the alimony settlement could bankrupt him.  He also asked Mr. Saunders for a statement describing his job offer to be used at the divorce trial, but Mr. Saunders refused.  Mr. Saunders stated that although he did not feel coerced by the Senator, he did feel manipulated.<p> <p>     Mr. Saunders testified that although his first conversation with Senator Packwood about Mrs. Packwood's possible role in helping him develop his art businesses and his telephone call to the Senator to request that he attend the hearing on the Japanese patent system occurred three days apart, there was no connection in his mind between the job offer and his work for Mitsubishi. He stated that Mrs. Packwood had been extremely close to his family at critical times in his family's life.  He stated there was never an express or implied quid pro quo.  He explained that the Packwoods were two friends going through an agonizing situation and he was trying to act as a friend.  He explained that the Senator was a friend and that Mrs. Packwood was an even closer friend.<p> <p>     <H4>6.   Other Diary Entries Referring to Mr. Saunders and Job Offers for Mrs. Packwood and Related Testimony:</H4><p> <p>         a.    10/18/89<p> <p>     In addition to the two diary entries discussed above, there are other diary entries spanning the time frame from October 1989 through June of 1990 in which Senator Packwood makes various references to Mr. Saunders extending employment opportunities to Mrs. Packwood.  On October 18, 1989, he recorded the following entry in his diary:<blockquote> <p> ". . . I did have time to come back to the office, talk to Tim Lee and he says he'll be happy to put up $10,000 a year for Georgie.  That's three out of three and I haven't even hit up [name omitted] or Steve Saunders.  I've got to handle this carefully.  I don't want in any way there to be any quid pro quo.  There shall not be any quid pro quo. I'm not going to do anything for these guys that I would not do for them anyway.  My  hunch is :1'11 get something out of Saunders and out of [name omitted].  I think I'll ask them for $5000 apiece and hold it in reserve and indicate to Georgie that if she'll say she can make $20,000 I'll make sure she gets another $20,000.[fn 179]  Then I'll come up with more and that will give me enough of an asset base to be able to buy a small two bedroom townhouse.</blockquote> <p>     When asked to explain what he meant by the words "hit up," Senator Packwood testified that his "use of the phrase "hit up" is to call somebody."[fn 180] He went on to testify:<blockquote> <p> Q:  Were you calling these people for a particular purpose?<p> <p> A:  I would have been calling them to see if they would provide some help for me with Georgie.<p> <p> Q:  When you say "help," do you mean income?<p> <p> A: Yes. That wouldn't be quite the same with [name omitted], but go ahead.<p> <p> Q: What did you mean when you said--<p> <p> A:  Hold on a second.  All of these people, as you're well aware that I called were old friends.  They had all in one form or another, discovered the possibility of separation, had indicated they wanted to help.  And I don't want in any way for you to think the term "hit up" as in other than I'm going to call and see if they can be of help, following up on their suggestion that if anything was going to happen they would be of help.<p> <p> Q:  But the purpose of calling them was to talk about income or job opportunities or business opportunities for Mrs. Packwood?<p> <p> A:  Yes, to discuss that.</blockquote> <p>     Senator Packwood also testified at length with respect to the quid pro quo reference in his diary:<blockquote> <p> Q:  Were you at all concerned, Senator, about the propriety of having discussions with or making requests of persons who might have an interest in legislation, having discussions about job opportunities or business opportunities for Mrs. Packwood? . . .<p> <p> A:  These were old friends.  I've been in politics a quarter of a century and would there be, I suppose, a thousand lobbyists you could go to and make this kind of a request? I assume there would be.  I didn't go to them.  I went to people that I had known, that were friends of mine, in some cases drinking buddies of mine, in all cases, all long standing friends.<p> <p> I did not go to them because they were lobbyists and I did not ever do anything for them nor would I do anything for them that I would not have otherwise have done but for Georgie and I being separated, married or otherwise.  And I saw nothing wrong with going to people that had been long- standing friends, personal friends and asking for help.<p> <p> And especially when I made it very clear, and you've probably seen it somewhere before when I said there's to be no quid pro quo, not only here but .in the memo to the marriage counselor, where there was to be no quid pro quo and she was to keep track of her hours and records.  And if she could not perform value received, then she would not be paid.  I did everything I could to make sure this was legal and ethical. . .<p> <p> Q:  . . . Were you concerned about a potential quid pro quo?<p> <p> A:  No, I was not concerned about a potential quid pro quo at all.  I don't do business that way.  I don't trade my votes for money and I was not going to do any quid pro quo.<p> <p> Q:  Why did you--do you know why you recorded these thoughts?  They appear to reflect a concern about a quid pro quo.<p> <p> A:  You will find those thoughts all through my diary...It's nothing unique here.  That is the way I think . . . .<p> <p> Q:  I appreciate that.  My question, Senator, is in the context of talking about and having conversations with these persons about providing income to Mrs. Packwood, in that same passage or at the end of that passage, you make reference to you do not want there to be any quid pro quo, not wanting to do anything for these guys that you wouldn't do for them anyway.  And I guess my question is:  Why--do you know why you put those thoughts, why you recorded those thoughts--<p> <p>  A:  As I said, you'll see this kind of entry all through my diary dealing with different people.  Conversations, I've often said, are not necessarily accurate.  Thoughts may be more accurate...I put this in here because these are my thoughts...I don't do business that way...So I put it in because that's the way--I can't remember on this particular one why I put it in.  That's just the way I think . . . .<p> <p> Q:  ...In general, why would you have expressed those thoughts in connection with discussions relating to persons about job opportunities for Mrs. Packwood?<p> <p> A:  Why would I express it that way?  Any place else in the diary, where somebody's coming in and I say by God, that's not the way I do business. Because those are my thoughts. I don't do business that way, and this diary is full of thoughts.<p> <p> Q:  Is there a reason specifically that those thoughts, that is thoughts about quid pro quos, would have been included in discussions about business opportunities for Mrs. Packwood?<p> <p> A:  Only in the sense I was going to make sure there would be no quid pro quo. And I did not want to do anything that would be a quid pro quo.</blockquote> <p> <p>         b.   12/16/89 Through 1/].8/90<p> <p>     On December 16, 1989, Senator Packwood again referred to Mr. Saunders in his diary, expressing a desire for him to call Mrs. Packwood and "indicate the money he [was] willing to spend on her."[fn 181]  Senator Packwood testified that he was hoping to eventually obtain approximately $20,000 for Mrs. Packwood with respect to the offers of employment.  On January 7, 1990, Senator Packwood noted in general that "it is imperative that she be willing to accept some business.  If she says she won't I'll still have to try to get her some and see what happens."  On January 18, 1990, Senator Packwood again referred to Mr. Saunders:<blockquote> <p> I hit [name omitted] up. He says 'yes.' [name omitted] a close friend  but not as close as Cliff.  The same with Saunders, same with Ron.  They just say bang, bang, bang--yes. But not Cliff. That means next week I've got to turn to Saunders and then to Crawford.</blockquote> <p>     Here, Senator Packwood testified that when he recorded "hit up" he meant asking him if he could talk Georgie into a job.<p> <p>  <p>       c.   1/24/90<p> <p>     On January 24, 1990, Senator Packwood recorded three entries involving job offers to his wife.  In the first of these entries, after mentioning that he wanted Mr. Saunders (as well as others) to call Mrs. Packwood about the job offer, he recorded the following<blockquote> <p> I'll get Saunders to do the same.  Then I can't decide whether it is [name omitted] or [name omitted] Tim Lee, or Crawford.  I don't think I'll go beyond that right now.  I want her to have at least $20,000  in offers.  Boy, I'm scating  [sic] on thin ice here.  I'm glad I put in writing to her...that I'll help her get business but she must give service for value and that this is and I used the word--this is not to be a bribe for me or gift to you and if you cannot perform the service, then your income or retainer will have to be reduced or eliminated . . . .</blockquote> <p>     When asked about this entry, Senator Packwood responded as follows:<p> <p> Q:  . . . What did you mean by "Boy, I'm skating on thin ice here?"<p> <p> A:  You asked earlier, could anybody construe this to be--I don't know if you said unethical or illegal or something like that, and I answered you've seen what the press will construe to be illegal or unethical.  It's perfectly allright [sic].  And I knew what I was doing was perfectly allright, or I thought I knew what I was doing was perfectly allright.  And I checked it as best I could[fn 182] and I didn't want anybody to construe it any differently than that.  I didn't want the press to do something if this got out....<p> <p> Q:  What did you mean by the reference "I'm skating on thin ice here?"<p> <p> A:  That's where the press can take something that's perfectly legal, legitimate, moral and ethical and try to turn it into something wrong.</blockquote> <p>     Also on January 24, 1990, Senator Packwood noted in his diary that Mr. Saunders had contacted him regarding the job offer to Mrs. Packwood:<blockquote> <p> I talked to Steve Saunders.  I was returning his call.  He had talked to Georgie.  She had returned his call.  He said he had a business proposition for her and the first question was, "Did Bob put you up to this?"  He said, "No." He was lying, but he said 'no.' He said, "I called him because it involves Epson.  Epson-America, of course has their major plant in Hillsboro [Oregon] and I wanted to make sure there was no conflict of interest.  Bob said 'no' and I said, 'Do you think Georgie would be interested?,' and he said, 'You'd better call her. I don't know . . . "</blockquote> <p>     With respect to this entry, Senator Packwood testified that he does not recall this conversation.  He stated that Mr. Saunders knew that Mrs. Packwood would be angry if she knew he was involved in the offer.  The Senator testified as follows:<blockquote> <p> Q:  Had you, in fact told him [Saunders] to do this?<p> <p> A:  I'd ask him to call...he at some stage said Bob, what can I do to help and we talked about his help and to that extent, after he'd asked first could I be of help, but he wasn't going to say to her Bob told me to do this or she would have been livid.</blockquote> <p>     He also testified that he could not recall having any discussions with Mr. Saunders about Mrs. Packwood's qualifications for the job.<p> <p>     Mr. Saunders testified that in one of his early conversations with Mrs. Packwood, she may have asked whether her husband put him up to offering her a job.  He testified that the Senator's reference to him lying in the January 24, 1990 entry is inaccurate.<p> <p> <p>       d.   4/13/90<p> <p>     On April 13, 1990, Senator Packwood recorded in his diary another conversation with Mr. Saunders relating to the job offer for Mrs. Packwood:<blockquote> <p> I got ahold of Steve Saunders and said it's time to put the proposal in writing also and Saunders says, 'Well, let me tell you what the latest is.  I talked with Georgie yesterday...she is interested in escorting these women around town on shopping tours--the wives of visiting dignitaries--but she absolutely does not want me to put anything in writing and for the moment she is not interested in any kind of venture with my ... sculptor art exporting company or something like that . . ."</blockquote> <p>     Senator Packwood testified that he does not recall why he wanted the proposal in writing.  He stated that he does not know whether the proposal was ever reduced to writing.  He stated that he has only a dim recollection of any discussion with Mr. Saunders about Mrs. Packwood escorting the wives of visiting dignitaries on shopping trips.<p> <p>     Mr. Saunders stated that he is unsure whether he came up with the idea of escorting the wives or whether Mrs. Packwood first came up with this idea. This proposal never materialized. There was no further discussion about any type of employment opportunity for her after June, 1990.  He does not recall the Senator ever telling him to put the proposal in writing.  He testified that he probably spoke with the Senator every time he spoke with Mrs. Packwood to report on his progress.<p> <p>     Senator Packwood testified that there was no discussion at any time with Mr. Saunders about the job offer to Mrs. Packwood in connection with him taking or refraining from taking any action in his capacity as a Senator.  Nor was there any type of implied understanding that there was a relationship between the job offer to Mrs. Packwood from Mr. Saunders and the Senator taking any action in an official capacity.<p> <p> <p>       <H4>7.   Mrs. Packwood's Testimony:</H4><p> <p>     Mrs. Packwood testified that soon after she first met Mr. Saunders in roughly 1980, and even before she started her antiques business, she had purchased Teddy Roosevelt memorabilia for him.  Some time between January and ,June, 1990, Mrs. Packwood testified that Mr. Saunders telephoned and asked whether she would be interested in helping a client find North American Indian antiques.  She testified that this was not ongoing employment. She did not accept this proposal.[fn 183] She stated that Mr. Saunders made a second proposal which involved buying sculpture and art for commercial establishments in the Orient. She testified that she believes it was proposed as "being a little ongoing anyway." She testified that she was not interested in this proposal and advised him accordingly.<p> <p>     Mrs. Packwood testified that Mr. Saunders made a third proposal in this time frame which involved escorting the wives of his Japanese clients to antique shows and shops.  Mrs. Packwood testified that she had no contact with Mr. Saunders after he made this last proposal until after the divorce.  Mr. Saunders later suggested that Mrs. Packwood work at the art gallery he was planning on opening if she were going to stay in town.  By that time however, she had decided to move back to Oregon.<p> <p>     As to Mr. Saunders's knowledge of the other job offers, Mrs. Packwood testified that she believed she ". . .  ought to warn"  him that ". . . there's a lot of stuff going on here that you could get caught in a web of, about finding employment for me that I'm not instigating."  She testified that Mr. Saunders wondered why the Senator was so interested in how much she could earn.  She stated that she believed that Senator Packwood became coercive and manipulative and Mr. Saunders then backed off.<p> <p>     Commenting in general, Mrs. Packwood testified that she did not regard the proposals as job offers.  She explained that she was not job hunting and that she viewed them as some kind of "coercive behavior."  She went on to state, "They [job offers] frightened me, but Bob Packwood frightened me in his behavior at that particular time anyway, so it was all part of a huge package of manipulation of me."  When asked whether she believes the proposals would have been made to her but for her husband's status as a Senator, she testified as follows:<blockquote> <p> The exception would be Mr. Saunders.  [With regard to] the other proposals. There was no reason to make them.  In all the years I've known Ron Crawford, Tim Lee and [name omitted], nothing ever arose in conversation or communication of any kind between me and them to do with my working outside my home, doing anything other than what I had been doing for 25 years.  And it's too much of a coincidence that they all three came forward at approximately the same period in my life with these sudden, whatever you call them, offers.</blockquote> <p> <p>       <H4>8.  Summary of Senator Packwood's Response to the Evidence:</H4><p> <p>     Senator Packwood asserts that Mr. Saunders is an old friend who had offered to help when he learned that the Senator was separating from his wife.  The Senator claims that he was merely following up on Mr. Saunders' offer of assistance when he discussed jobs and income for Mrs. Packwood.  He contends that he turned to Mr. Saunders because they were longstanding friends and not for reasons related to his official position.<p> <p>     With respect to the November 3, 1989 diary entry in which he records that he asked Mr. Saunders to place his wife on a $7500 retainer, Senator Packwood says that he was quite drunk on this date and has no recollection of any of the specific conversation that appears in this diary entry, although he does recall talking to Mr. Saunders about a job and asking him whether he was prepared to follow up on his offer of help.  Senator Packwood maintains that he has no recollection of discussing the November 6 Finance Committee hearing at the November 3 meeting with Mr. Saunders.<p> <p>     Senator Packwood testified that the! references in his diary about quid pro quos simply reflect a desire on his part that the job proposals be legally and ethically correct and that there be no quid pro quos between the job offers and his official actions. In this regard, he asserts that he checked with a lawyer named Jack Quinn about the legality of the offers.[fn 184] He also argues that he never attempted to conceal the involvement of those persons extending job offers to his wife because this information was publicly discussed at his divorce trial.  Additionally, he relies on correspondence that he sent to his wife where he states, in part, that the job offers should not be considered as either gifts to her or bribes to him and that she must be prepared to provide value in return for payment.<p> <p>     Senator Packwood stated that he has no recollection of Mr. Saunders asking him to personally appear and ask questions at the November 6 hearing.  He also says he has no recollection of whether he would have personally attended the hearing but for Mr. Saunders's request that he do so.  He states that his involvement in the issue of the differences between the American and Japanese patent systems dated back at least as early as June of 1988.<p> <p>     Senator Packwood denies any connection between the discussion of jobs and income for his wife with Mr. Saunders and any of his official acts.<p> <p>        <H4>9.  Findings:</H4><p> <p>     Senate Ethics Counsel finds that Senator Packwood did in fact solicit or otherwise encourage an offer of personal financial assistance from Mr. Saunders, an individual representing a client with a particularized interest in matters that the Senator could influence.<p> <p>     Counsel finds that Senator Packwood and Mr. Saunders engaged in discussions about job offers and income for the Senator's wife at at time when Mr. Saunders was actively representing a client with a specific and direct interest before Senator Packwood's committees.  Although both have testified that Mr. Saunders first extended a general offer of assistance and Senator Packwood then merely followed up, the weight of the evidence indicates that Senator Packwood's role in encouraging and coordinating job offers for his wife was significant.  In fact, Ethics Counsel finds that the Senator's discussions with Mr. Saunders about job offers for his wife comprised part of a deliberate and systematic plan by the Senator to accumulate approximately $20,000 in job offers for his spouse in order to reduce his alimony obligation.  Additionally, Counsel finds that Mrs. Packwood was not looking for a job at the time Senator Packwood engaged Mr. Saunders in discussion about providing a job offer to her.<p> <p>     Ethics Counsel finds that Mr. Saunders's general offer of help was extended after the Senator expressed concern about his wife's future sources of income once they were separated and divorced.  Moreover, Ethics Counsel finds that the Senator's diary entries, recorded nearly contemporaneously with the events as they occurred, suggest that the Senator played a more active role than simply following up with Mr. Saunders, as evidenced by the Senator's use of language such as "hit up," place on "retainer," and "accept the offers that I've solicited." Further, Counsel finds that the Senator and Mr. Saunders discussed a specific dollar amount ($7500) at their November 3, 1989 meeting. Additionally, Counsel finds that Senator Packwood requested Mr. Saunders to provide a statement describing his job offer to be used at the divorce trial, but Mr. Saunders refused.<p> <p>      Ethics Counsel finds that Mr. Saunders and Senator Packwood did have a longstanding friendship rooted in the Mr. Saunders's prior status as an employee.  Notwithstanding this friendship, Counsel finds that at the time they were discussing job offers and income for Mrs. Packwood, Mr. Saunders was representing Mitsubishi in connection with its patent dispute with Fusion. Counsel notes that Senator Packwood's involvement in the issue of differences between the patent systems of Japan and the United States dated back at least eighteen months prior to the November 6, 1989 Committee on Finance hearing and that he publicly pursued this issue on at least three prior occasions. Nonetheless, Counsel finds that Senator Packwood rearranged his schedule at the last minute to personally attend the November 6, 1989 hearing at Mr. Saunders's request, within three days of the meeting where a job offer for Mrs. Packwood was discussed.  Additionally, Counsel finds that the questions asked by Senator Packwood at the hearing, directed to Fusion's president, were virtually identical to the questions submitted by Mr. Saunders on behalf of Mitsubishi.<p> <p>     Counsel finds that Mr. Saunders discussed employment with Mrs. Packwood at various times between November 1989 and June of 1990.  Counsel further finds that Mrs. Packwood never accepted his offer of employment.<p> <p> <p> <H3>B.   Tim Lee:</H3><p> <p>           <H4>1.   Backgrounds</H4><p> <p>     Tim Lee worked for Senator Packwood for about a year in the mid-1970's as an intern on his Washington staff.  In the 1989-1991 time frame, he owned a company called Superior Transportation Systems (STS), a trucking brokerage concern.  He is currently the owner of a company called Logistics Resource Management, Inc.  His company owns rail cars, markets rail transportation and provides transportation consulting services.<p> <p>        Regarding his fundraising role, Mr. Lee was the chairman of the largest single event of the Senator's 1992 campaign, a breakfast with then-President Bush in 1991.  He stated this function raised between $350,000 and $400,000 after expenses. Mr. Lee also arranged a fundraising event in Seattle in January or February 1991, which raised between $18,000 and 20,000.<p> <p>     <H4>2.   Diary Entries Referring to Mr. Lee and Job Offers to Mrs. Packwood and Related Testimony:</H4><p> <p>         a.   10/18/89<p> <p>     Senator Packwood's diary entries relating to discussions with Mr. Lee about employment opportunities for Mrs. Packwood span from roughly October 1989 through April of 1990.  On October 18, 1989, Senator Packwood recorded the following entry<blockquote> <p> I got back and decided to make some inquiries as to whether I could get Georgie some income...I then called Tim Lee and said, "Tim, could you somehow put Georgie on retainer for $10,000?"  They thought they could do that...I did have time to come back to the office, talk to Tim Lee and Tim says he'll be happy to put up $10,000 a year for Georgie . . . .</blockquote> <p>     Senator Packwood testified that he cannot remember what he meant by the word "retainer" in the diary entry.  He does not recall discussing a specific dollar amount with Mr. Lee.  He testified that Mr. Lee was very familiar with his marital situation and that he had been talking with Mr. Lee about a job for Mrs. Packwood.  Senator Packwood testified that his total recollection of discussions with Mr. Lee about jobs for Mrs. Packwood had "...something to do with antiques and his wife." Senator Packwood could not recall when they first started talking about antiques because they n...had talked about it, obviously before, concerning his wife and things Georgie was buying.  I can recall taking things out on the plane that she (Georgie) had bought and taking it out to him (Lee), things of that nature.  I don't know when we started talking about antiques and when this occurred.<p> <p>     Mr. Lee testified that he learned of the Packwood's separation some time in February or March, 1990, although he was aware that Senator Packwood had contemplated divorce at least a year prior to the time of the actual separation.  Mr. Lee does not recall having discussions with Senator Packwood prior to the time he learned of the separation about providing any type of financial support for Mrs. Packwood.<p> <p>     Mr. Lee testified that he does not recall receiving a call from Senator Packwood in which the Senator asked him to put Mrs. Packwood on retainer for $10,000, nor does he recall ever telling Senator Packwood that he would be happy to put up $10,000 a year for Mrs. Packwood.  He testified that the only time that he spoke to Senator Packwood about compensation for Mrs. Packwood was when Mr. Lee brought up the antiques business.  He does not recall whether this took place in October 1989 or March or April of 1990.  He testified that the subject of income for Mrs. Packwood arose when Senator Packwood began complaining about the hardships of a potential divorce in terms of educational expense, for the children and maintaining two households.  Mr. Lee responded by bringing up the idea of an antiques business.  Mr. Lee does not recall the Senator requesting or encouraging him to make job offers to Mrs. Packwood beyond initiating the conversations that the divorce would be expensive.<p> <p>     To the best of his recollection, the first conversation he had with the Senator about providing income to Mrs. Packwood did not occur until after Mr. Lee's wife had returned from an antique buying trip with Mrs. Packwood in October, 1989.[fn 185] From that time until the date of his April 14, 1990 letter setting forth the proposal, Mr. Lee stated that he spoke with Mrs. Packwood about the venture on two or three occasions.  During one of his conversations with Mrs. Packwood, she referred to other job offers.  She indicated that Mr. Lee's offer was one that she would consider, implying that the others were not.  Mr. Lee kept Senator Packwood apprised of his conversations with Mrs. Packwood.   Mr. Lee testified that he made no attempt to conceal the fact that he was talking to the Senator about the venture from Mrs. Packwood.<p> <p>     Mr. Lee testified that although it was not explicit, he and the Senator understood that the income generated from the antiques venture for Mrs. Packwood would make it easier on both of the Packwoods.  He testified that he believed the job offer was legitimate and potentially lucrative for him.<p> <p>          b.   3/27/90<p> <p>     On March 27, 1990, Senator Packwood recorded the following entry in his diary relating to Mr. Lee:<blockquote> <p> . . . I frankly don't intend this supplement to Georgie to last more than five years in any event.  I'd also talked with Tim Lee today to reverify his $10,000 and $10,000 from Bill Furman for Georgie.  She'll have basically $30,000 to $40,000 in income for five years so long as I remain in the Senate.</blockquote> <p>     With respect to the reference about the supplement to his wife lasting only five years, Senator Packwood testified as follows:<blockquote> <p> A:  Well, it's kind of like our budget process.  I don't think I was thinking more than five years down the road and I thought if I could get her this money for five years--I didn't mean for it necessarily to end, I just wasn't thinking beyond five years.<p> <p> Q:  In the last sentence of that passage, you say, "She'll have basically $30,000 to $40,000 in income for five years so long as I remain in the Senate." Was the supplement, as you refer to it here, conditioned upon your remaining in the Senate?<p> <p> A:  No.<p> <p> Q:  Do you know why you would have used these words?<p> <p> A:  No, I don't.</blockquote> <p>     Regarding the reference to Bill Furman, Senator Packwood testified that at some stage, Mr. Lee approached Mr. Furman about becoming a partner in the proposed antiques venture.  Senator Packwood testified that he does not recall when he first spoke to Mr. Furman about the venture.  He stated that he never directly approached Mr. Furman about the proposal.  When asked what the reference to $10,000 in the diary entry meant, Senator Packwood testified as follows:<blockquote> <p> A:  I can't remember specifically what it refers to, and I don't know when he pieced together bringing Bill Furman in and how he was going to make this arrangement on the antique business.  I can't specifically say what. it refers to, no.<p> <p> Q:  Do you know in general?<p> <p> A: No. I'm assuming antique and I'm assuming his business. At this stage, Lynn [Lee's wife] had been back with us-- this is 1990, isn't it?<p> <p> Q:  Correct.<p> <p> A:  Lynn had stayed with us and I  remember Georgie had lined up a lot of antique shows...And what I remember specifically was Lynn had bought some things, I think I recall this, and turned around and sold them in Oregon rather handsomely, I think.  And I'm thinking this is the business they're talking about but I can't remember if it's now.  That's what I recall about the business.</blockquote> <p>         c.   4/12/90<p> <p>     On April 12, 1990, Senator Packwood again recorded an entry involving Mr. Lee and the job offer to Mrs. Packwoods<blockquote> <p> . . . I called Tim Lee because he had left a message which said he had made the contact.  I got ahold of him and he -    said he'd spent an hour and a half talking to Georgie...Tim said he finally thought he made some headway and that she might be willing to consider a proposal that he had.  I said, ". . . how are you going to make it legal?"  He said, "Well, I'm going to suggest I put money into a business jointly to be run by Lynn (that's his wife) and Georgie. She would buy antiques and ship them out west and Lynn would sell them..."  Tim says he'll put the entire $20,000 a year in himself--enough for Georgie to get $20,000 plus something extra for Lynn--but what she'll take out is what he would otherwise give her for an allowance so it's simply a wash.  And he said he'll work out a deal with Bill Furman--some business arrangement with him-- and Bill will simply give Tim more money in some kind of a business deal for what he would otherwise put into the business for Georgie.  God, I'm glad I don't know this.  I think it's legal allright.  I would hate for it to get out but I've got that ethics letter that says what she earns while we're separated is not a violation of ethics.  Now, I've got Tim and $20,000 . . .</blockquote> <p>     When asked about his apparent concern over the legality of the arrangement, Senator Packwood testified as follows:<blockquote> <p> A:  I just wanted to make sure it's legal.  Again, I'm trying to make sure that everything that's going to happen here is legal.<p> <p> Q:  Were you at all concerned or did you have any information to suggest that it might not be legal?<p> <p> A:  No.  I didn't have anything.  You asked a lot earlier but I can't remember the words you used, when we were talking about the press.  I was trying to bend over back- wards to make sure that the job offers Georgie got were legitimate job offers for which she would perform services for value.  That's what I meant.  I want to make sure everything is legal.<p> <p> Q:  Senator, this says, again referring to the sentence we were just talking about, "I said . . . how are you going to make it legal" as a question, and I'm wondering was it at all questionable to you?<p> <p> A:  Again, I don't recall this conversation.  I noticed down below I say--I think it's legal--I think it's legal allright.  I don't recall specifically this conversation. I just recall wanting to make sure :it was all right or things were allright [sic].  It didn't matter if it was Tim or [name omitted] or Steve.  I wanted to make sure they were allright . . . .<p> <p> Q:  . . . You say, "God, I'm glad I don't know this. I think it's legal allright." What were you referring to there?<p> <p> A:  I haven't got the foggiest idea unless it makes reference to this up above where Tim is saying well, we'll do something with my business relations to Bill, and then I say I guess that's legal.  Again, I can't remember any of this conversation.  I don't even want to know it.  I just want to make sure what Georgie does, she performs for value is okay . . .<p> <p> Q:  . . . do you recall any reason you wouldn't have wanted to know what their arrangement was?  In other words, this says "God, I'm glad I don't know this."<p> <p> A:  I didn't figure so long as what Georgie was going to be doing was legal, ethical, moral and anything else, I didn't think it made any difference how Tim worked out his arrangement with Bill Furman . . .<p> <p> Q:  . . . you record "I would hate for it to get out;" what do you mean there?<p> <p> A:  I don't know what I mean there.  All I know is I apparently say I guess it's legal, allright.  I don't know what I mean.  I just want -- I don't want anything that the press is going to take, that they're going to try to slant in some way that portrays it as wrong . . .</blockquote> <p>     Mr. Lee does not recall telling Senator Packwood that he would put up the entire investment himself and that Mr. Furman would participate by giving him extra business.  Nor does he recall discussing the legality of the arrangement with Senator Packwood.  Mr. Lee does not recall having any concerns about the legality of the proposed venture.  Mr. Lee recalls telling Senator Packwood that he anticipated Mrs. Packwood would receive a draw of $20,000.  He intended for there to be enough money so that both Mrs. Packwood and his wife would receive at least $20,000 based on some sales protections he had done.[fn 186]<p> <p>        d.  4/15/90<p> <p>     Mr. Lee reduced his proposal to writing in a letter dated April 14, 1990.[fn 187]  Mr. Lee does not recall Senator Packwood making any changes to the letter.  In a diary entry dated April 15, 1990, Senator Packwood recorded that he had met with Mr. Lee and Mr. Lee showed him the letter that he was sending to Mrs. Packwood detailing his proposal for an antiques business. Senator Packwood noted that Mr. Lee was going to offer Mrs. Packwood $20,000 to $25,000 a year plus 40% of the net profits and that Bill Furman was going to put up half of the money. Later the same day, Senator Packwood recorded an entry in his diary setting forth the status of his efforts to obtain job offers for his wife:<blockquote> <p> Needless to say it gives me the final hook although I'm still feeling guilty...but at least: we have the ducks lined up. [name omitted] at $5,000, Tim Lee and Bill Furman at $20,000, Steve Saunders at whatever adds to the total of $25,000 and I'll have Ron Crawford send her a letter that says, "Georgie, I'd be willing to talk with you about employment," perhaps having put in the letter in the magnitude of $7500 a year.</blockquote> <p>       Senator Packwood testified that as of April 15, 1990, he thinks he had lined up each of the above individuals to provide job offers to Mrs. Packwood.<p> <p>       Mr. Lee testified that either just before or just after he drafted the letter to Mrs. Packwood, he asked Bill Furman if he would consider investing in the venture. He later changed this testimony and stated that he could have spoken to Mr. Furman about participating as early as October or November, 1989. Mr. Lee testified that Mr. Furman stated he would take a look at the proposal and that he thought it sounded good.[fn 188] Mr. Lee does not recall having any conversations with Mr. Furman about sources of income for Mrs. Packwood other than the specific discussion about the antiques venture. Mr. Lee testified that he went to Mr. Furman because he was the only individual with whom he had a personal relationship who might be interested in the venture and who had the resources to participate.[fn 189] Mr. Lee stated that he knew Mr. Furman had been a contributor to the Senator's campaign and that the Senator had been helpful in some of Mr. Furman's efforts.[fn 190]<p> <p>      <H4>3. Legislative Matters of Interest to Mr. Lee:</H4><p> <p>       By way of background, Senator Packwood testified that he is a "deregulatory hawk." He explained that he played a major role in deregulating the trucking industry in 1980. He stated that when he became Chairman of the Finance Committee in 1981, he partially deregulated AT&amp;T in the Senate and it died because of an antitrust judgment before the House acted. He explained that he deregulated freight forwarders, the merchant marine, railroads, buses--"Anything I could deregulate, I would." He explained that he arranged for Mr. Lee to testify in 1985 before a subcommittee of the Commerce Committee because he was having oversight hearings on whether truck deregulation was working and Mr. Lee was a "classic example" of the success of deregulation.<p> <p>        At the time Mr. Lee extended an employment proposal to Mrs. Packwood in April, 1990, he was the owner of a trucking brokerage firm, STS, Inc. In June of 1990, the Supreme Court issued its decision in a case called <I>Maislin Industries, U.S., Inc., v. Primary Steel,Inc.,</I> 497 U.S. 116 (1990)(<I>"Maislin"</I>). This decision had specific implications for Mr. Lee's business. Mr. Lee explained that <I>Maislin</I> upheld the common carrier doctrine. During this period, a number of large motor carriers were going out of business. <I>Maislin</I> allowed the bankrupt carriers to go back to shippers and bill them for the difference between what they agreed to charge on a contract basis versus what the common carrier tariffs stated. Scott Paper Company, one of Mr. Lee's largest clients, was sued by the trustee of the bankrupt carrier STS had been using. Although Mr. Lee's company agreed to hold Scott Paper harmless, Scott was nonetheless concerned about its future exposure.[fn 191]<p> <p>     Senator Packwood testified that he does not know if he ever had discussions with Mr. Lee about the <I>Maislin</I> decision and its implications for Mr. Lee's business, although he stated that he . . . did not like the <I>Maislin</I> decision.  I wanted to get rid of the <I>Maislin</I> decision. "  He stated that Mr. Lee may have asked him to sponsor or cosponsor legislation to overturn or modify the decision.  Senator Packwood explained that ". . . lots of people . . .were asking us to cosponsor it.  I think all the shippers hated it.  They were going to get stuck with these bankrupt truck lines' bills, for things they never knew they were responsible for."  Senator Packwood testified that he did not have any discussions with Mr. Lee about the job offer for Mrs. Packwood in connection with or relation to him sponsoring or cosponsoring legislation that would remedy the impact of <I>Maislin</I> on Mr. Lee's business.<p> <p>     On July 30, 1990, the Commerce Committee, chaired by Senator Exon, passed the Negotiated Rates Equity Act ("NREA"), which would have had the effect of reversing the <I>Maislin</I> decision. Senator Packwood testified that he does not know whether he discussed this bill with Mr. Lee or not.  He further testified that there was no connection or relationship between his vote, either in the Commerce Committee or on the bill itself, and Mr. Lee's job offer to Mrs. Packwood.  Senator Packwood was one of ten co-sponsors of the bill.  The bill languished in 1990 due to House inaction and was reintroduced in 1991.  The bill passed the Senate in 1992, but died again after the House failed to act. The bill was reintroduced in 1993 and passed.<p> <p>     Mr. Lee testified that he does not recall ever discussing Scott Paper's concerns over <I>Maislin</I> with the Senator.  In fact, he does not recall ever speaking to the Senator about Maislin or the NREA.  To the extent he talked with the Senator about legislation, Mr. Lee testified that their conversations were limited to general comments along the lines of "deregulation would be good for my business."<p> <p>     <H4>4.   The Status of Mr. Lee's Offer in August. 1990:</H4><p> <p>     In a letter dated August 1, 1990, Mr. Lee advised Senator Packwood that Mrs. Packwood had informed him she was not interested in his proposal at that time.  Mr. Lee wrote back to her and explained that his offer was ". . . an open one and one that you may pursue with me at a time of your chosing[sic]."[fn 192] Senator Packwood testified that he does not recall speaking with Mr. Lee about Mrs. Packwood's response to the job offer.  Nor does he recall whether he requested Mr. Lee to again offer the job to her or hold the offer open.  He acknowledged that had Mrs. Packwood accepted this offer, it would have had a positive financial effect for her and thus, a positive impact for him, assuming the judge hearing the divorce case would have considered it.<p> <p>     Senator Packwood testified that he did not, at any time, have any discussion with Mr. Lee about the job offer to Mrs. Packwood in connection with him taking or refraining from taking any action or position in his capacity as a Senator.  Nor was there any implicit agreement with Mr. Lee about the job offer in connection with him taking any official action or position.<p> <p>     <H4>5.   Mrs. Packwood's Testimony:</H4><p> <p>     Mrs. Packwood testified that she started her antiques business in 1983 with a friend.  She bought the partnership in 1984 and has continued on her own since that time.  When living in Washington, D.C., her activities related to the antiques business consisted of the following: participating in antique shows four to twelve times a year; managing a stall in an antique mall on a fairly consistent basis; and filling special orders for people who wanted unusual gifts.<p> <p>     Mrs. Packwood testified that her husband asked her to have Businessman one's wife stay with them in the fall of 1989 so that Mrs. Packwood could take her antiquing.  She does not recall discussing with Mr. Lee's wife the possibility of opening some type of business together.  She does not believe she has spoken with Mr. Lee's wife since her visit in the fall of 1989.  She testified that it was clear to her that whatever  Mr. Lee was doing with respect to an antiques proposal was separate from his wife.<p> <p>     Mrs. Packwood testified that she does not recall ever speaking to Mr. Lee about her antique business prior to late 1989.  Referring to Mr. Lee's reference in the April 14 letter to her son's schooling, she stated that there must have been some conversation about paying for her son's education; "I presume when I spoke to him [Mr. Lee] that I was terribly worried about how to keep my son in school so he was offering to help the Packwoods out." She does not recall any specific discussions with Mr. Lee about her financial situation. She testified that she told each person who contacted her on the telephone to put their Proposal in writing.<p> <p>     Mrs. Packwood testified that at the time she received Mr. Lee's proposal, she did not know where she was going or what she was doing, or how she could take on any kind of offer of employment. She testified that she did not believe Mr. Lee's proposal was necessarily an offer of employment because there was no elaboration of how the proposal would take place.  The proposal did not seem like "anything solid" to her.<p> <p>     Mrs. Packwood testified that she suspected that her husband was behind Mr. Lee's offer.  In fact, she stated that Mr. Lee may have indicated that Senator Packwood asked him to extend the offer, but she does not recall anything more specific.  She testified that she was disturbed about the job offers because she thought it was "extremely-cruel and unethical behavior" to treat a spouse in this way.  She stated that because Mr. Lee later testified in the divorce proceedings as a witness for the Senator, she believes that he did not offer the proposal for her benefit.  She last remembers speaking with  Mr. Lee during the divorce trial.  There was no mention of the business at that time.  She does not believe she knows Mr. Furman.<p> <p>     <H4>6.  Summary of Senator Packwood's Response to the Evidence:</H4><p> <p>     As in the case of Mr. Saunders, Senator Packwood testified that Mr. Lee is a longstanding friend who offered to help when he learned the Packwoods would be separating.  Again, the Senator says he was merely following up on the offer of assistance.  He asserts that he turned to Mr. Lee because of their friendship and not for reasons related to his official position.<p> <p>     Senator Packwood stated that his total recollection of discussions with Mr. Lee about jobs for Mrs. Packwood had ". . . something to do with antiques and his wife."  He does not recall when they first started talking about the venture because Mrs. Packwood had been purchasing antiques for Mr. Lee's wife on an informal basis prior to their discussions about the venture.<p> <p>     With respect to his diary entry dated October 18, 1989, where he records that he asked Mr. Lee to place his wife on a retainer, Senator Packwood says he cannot remember what he meant by the word "retainer."  Nor does he recall discussing a specific dollar amount with Mr. Lee.  With respect to his diary entry dated March 27, 1990, where he discusses his contacts with various persons regarding jobs for his wife and records that his wife will have $30,000 to $40,000 in income "so long as [he] remains in the Senate," Senator Packwood denies that the income for his wife was conditioned upon his remaining in the Senate. Senator Packwood maintains that the his references to the legality of the proposed venture are simply expressions of his determination that the arrangement be legal and do not reflect a concern or question about the legality of this undertaking.<p> <p>      Senator Packwood said that he does not know whether he ever spoke with Mr. Lee about the Supreme Court's decision in <I>Maislin</I> and its impact on Mr. Lee's livelihood, although he acknowledged that Mr. Lee may have asked him to sponsor or cosponsor legislation to overturn or modify the decision.  Similarly, Senator Packwood maintains that he does not know whether he discussed the NREA with Mr. Lee.  Senator Packwood denies that there was any connection between his discussion of the antiques venture or income for his wife with Mr. Lee and his official actions, including his position on the NREA.<p> <p>     <H4>7.  Findings:</H4><p> <p>     Senate Ethics Counsel finds that Senator Packwood did in fact solicit or otherwise encourage an offer of personal financial assistance from Mr. Lee, an individual who, although not a lobbyist, had a particularized interest in matters that the Senator could influence.<p> <p>     Counsel finds that Senator Packwood and Mr. Lee had conversations about jobs or income for the Senator's wife during a period when Mr. Lee had a specific and direct interest in a matter before one of Senator Packwood's committees.  Although both have testified that Mr. Lee first extended an offer of help and Senator Packwood then followed up, the weight of the evidence again suggests that Senator Packwood's role in encouraging and coordinating job offers for his wife was significant.  In fact, Ethics Counsel finds that Senator Packwood's discussions with Mr. Lee about jobs and income for his wife comprised part of a deliberate and systematic plan  by the Senator to accumulate approximately $20,000 in job offers for his spouse in order to reduce his alimony obligation.<p> <p>     Additionally, Counsel finds that Mrs. Packwood was not looking for a job at the time the Senator engaged Mr. Lee in discussion about providing a job offer to her.<p> <p>     More specifically, Ethics Counsel finds that although Mrs. Packwood previously had purchased antiques for Mr. Lee's wife on an informal basis, the subject of income for Mrs. Packwood arose only after the Senator began complaining to Mr. Lee about the hardships of a potential divorce in terms of educational expenses for the children and the cost of maintaining two households. Moreover, Ethics Counsel finds that the Senator's diary entries, recorded nearly contemporaneously with the events as they occurred, suggest that the Senator played a more active role than simply following up with Mr. Lee's offer, as evidenced by the Senator's use of language such as place on "retainer," trying to "get Georgie some income," gaining the "final hook," and having the "ducks lined up.'   Further, Counsel finds that the reference in the Senator's diary that his wife will have an income "supplement" so long as he remains in the Senate suggests that he may have believed there was a connection between his ability to encourage job offers for his wife and his official position.<p> <p>       Ethics Counsel finds that Mr. Lee and Senator Packwood did have a longstanding friendship dating back to the time that Mr. Lee was one of the Senator's employees. Counsel also finds that throughout his career, Senator Packwood has consistently advocated deregulation of the trucking industry and his position with respect to the NREA was consistent with his deregulatory philosophy.  Notwithstanding this friendship and Senator Packwood's views on deregulation, Counsel finds that during the time they were discussing the antiques venture for Mrs. Packwood, Mr. Lee had a particularized interest in trying to remedy the impact of the Supreme Court's decision in <I>Maislin</I>, which had specific adverse implications for his business.   Counsel also finds that by virtue of his position on the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, Senator Packwood was in position to influence the outcome of this issue.<p> <p>     Counsel notes that Mr. Lee outlined his proposal to Mrs. Packwood in writing on April 14, 1990 and then advised her in writing in August 1990 and again in February 1991 that his offer remained open.  Counsel also notes that the <I>Maislin</I> decision was issued in June of 1990 and the NREA passed the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation in late July, 1990.  Counsel also notes that Senator Packwood signed the bill as one of several cosponsors in September of 1990.  Ethics Counsel further notes that Mr. Lee testified at the Packwood's divorce trial on behalf of the Senator in January, 1991, describing his job offer to Mrs. Packwood.  Counsel finds that Mrs. Packwood never accepted this offer of employment.<p> <p> <p> <H3>C.   Bill Furman:</H3><p> <p>       <H4>1.   Background:</H4><p> <p>     Bill Furman is the President of Greenbrier Companies of Lake Oswego, Oregon.  Greenbrier is in the railcar manufacturing business through a subsidiary company called Gunderson, Inc.  It is also in the business of leasing railcars and intermodal containers and trailers.  Mr. Furman testified that he first met Senator Packwood in the early 1980's through a mutual acquaintance.<p> <p>     Mr. Furman has participated in two fundraising events for Senator Packwood. The first was the event with then-President George Bush organized by Mr. Lee in Oregon in 1991.  Greenbrier also cosponsored a fundraising event in San Francisco earlier the same year (1991).  More than $50,000 was raised at this event.<p> <p>     <H4>2.   Diary Entries Referring to Mr. Furman, Job Offers to Mrs. Packwood, Greenbrier's Legislative Interests and Related Testimony:</H4><p> <p>          a.   11/8/89<p> <p>     It appears that the first mention of Mr. Furman in Senator Packwood's diary in connection with a job offer to Mrs. Packwood occurred on November 8, 1989 with the following entry:<blockquote> <p> He [Mr. Lee] said that [his wife], in staying with Georgie, said that two days was enough.  That Georgie just leaned and leaned and leaned on her and talked about divorce--talked about [name omitted].  That Georgie is terribly worried about money...Tim and Bill Furman, the President of Greenbrier (sp?), are prepared to do anything for Georgie.  Bill says, "What do we need? $40 or $50 thousand year from me?  Count on it . . . .</blockquote> <p>     Senator Packwood testified that he recalls almost nothing by way of discussions with Mr. Furman about his involvement in the proposal.  He went on to state that he does not recall Mr. Furman being involved in the venture this early in time.  He first recalls Mr. Furman being involved in the spring of 1990, at the time of Mr. Lee's letter to Mrs. Packwood.<p> <p>         b.   11/9/89<p> <p>     The next diary entry relating to Mr. Furman being involved in the job offer to Mrs. Packwood is dated November 9, 1989:<blockquote> <p> Mike Kelly and I got to the Bill Furman breakfast . . . And it was nothing but to thank me for what I had done on Trailer Train(?)[fn 193] and the investment tax credit--whatever it was I got for them in the tax reform bill--and of course Furman has said he'll join Tim Lee in helping keep Georgie solvent . . . ."[fn [194]</blockquote> <p>     When asked about this entry, Senator Packwood testified that he does not remember this conversation.  As to Mr. Furman's motivation in offering to help his wife, Senator Packwood responded as follows:<blockquote> <p> Q:  . . . Was it your understanding that Mr. Furman's involvement in the job proposal for Mrs. Packwood was as an expression of gratitude or thanks for what you had done for his company earlier on?<p> <p> A:  Well, again, it's funny.  I don't have any recollection of this conversation either.  This is one and the previous one, it just does not ring a bell to me at all that it ever occurred.  Maybe Bill Furman can remember it better, or Tim if he was there.  But no, I did not assume it would have been gratitude.  I would like to think  that when you succeed in helping an Oregon company in keeping it going and a thousand jobs, that you've succeeded in doing something that the state appreciates but again, I don't recall this and I certainly don't recall gratitude.<p> <p> Q:  In other words, in your mind, was there a connection between Mr. Furman's appreciation for what you had done for him and for his company, and his participation in the job offer for Mrs. Packwood?<p> <p> A:  No.  My experience with Mr. Furman, and some of it's more recent, he is a pretty canny businessman and what he gets into, he gets into it on the assumption he's going to make money.  I certainly didn't assume it was pure gratitude for what I had done in keeping the jobs in Oregon.</blockquote> <p>     With respect to the Trailer Train issue mentioned in the diary entry, Mr. Furman explained that Trailer Train (now known as TTX Company) is owned by a large number of railroads and operates a pool of freight cars in the United States.  He explained that at the time of the diary entry, Trailer Train was applying to the ICC for an extension of its pooling authority. This authority would include antitrust immunity for purchasing and pooling, enabling the railroads to collectively pool their purchasing power.  Greenbrier and others in the industry were concerned about the length of that authority and the power that was being vested in Trailer Train and thus supported a Department of Justice ("DOJ") initiative to have a formal hearing at the ICC to review the extension and approval of authority.<p> <p>    Greenbrier approached members of the Oregon delegation, including Senator Packwood, to support the DOJ initiative and to urge them to write the ICC to request that they review this matter.  Senator Packwood, as well as other members of the Oregon delegation, wrote letters supporting the request for review.  Mr. Furman testified that he met with Senator Packwood on this issue at least once and the meeting probably took place in 1987.  The purpose of the meeting was to familiarize the Senator with the issue and ask for his support. He also recalls a breakfast with Senator Packwood where the subject was discussed.  Mr. Furman testified that the ultimate outcome of the issue was difficult to ascertain and did not clearly satisfy any of the interested parties.  Trailer Train received authority for pooling, but for a shorter term than they were requesting and with some limitations.<p> <p>          c.   4/15/90<p> <p>     Senator Packwood again recorded a reference to Mr. Furman in an April 15, 1990 diary entry which refers to a meeting between Mr. Furman, Mr. Lee and Senator Packwood and a discussion about the proposal for Mrs. Packwood:<blockquote> <p> ". . . Bill Furman is going to put up half the money.  He and his partner own all of Greenbrier . . . Tim and I and Bill went to dinner at Standfords, right across from where their office is, and Bill told me about a new rail car they're designing...Anyway, he said, "Bob, there's no quid pro quo. You've done so much for my company and done so much for this state and I just want to do anything I can to make your continued existence in politics possible."  I said, "Well, this may be the difference in my being able to run for reelection in 1992 and run for the Presidency in 1996.</blockquote> <p>     Senator Packwood testified that he does not recall this conversation with Mr. Furman.  He explained, "...At this stage, is this an amalgam of my thinking, and this is a conversation that did not occur or a conversation that occurred totally differently and I put it in this fashion? I don't know. I don't recall this conversation . . . ."[fn 195]<p> <p>     When shown the April 15, 1990 diary entry, Mr. Furman stated that he recalls having a meeting on a weekend and going to Stanfords, although he thought it was for lunch, not dinner.  He does not recall Mr. Lee showing the Senator a letter referring to the antiques proposal, nor does he recall any discussion of the proposal.  As to the diary attributing to him a comment about there being no quid pro quo, Mr. Furman testified that it would not have been unusual for him to tell the Senator that he supports him and that he thinks he has done a good job for Oregon, but these types of comments would not have been in connection with the antiques proposal for Mrs. Packwood.  He stressed that he does not ever recall talking about financing a business for Mrs. Packwood with the Senator.[fn 196]  Later in his deposition, he testified that such a conversation with the Senator did not take place.  He does not recall discussing a new type of railcar with the Senator, but it would not have been unusual to describe what his company was doing.<p> <p>        d.   5/2/90<p> <p>     Senator Packwood again refers to Mr. Furman in a diary entry dated MaY 2, 1990:<blockquote> <p> Met with Bill Furman, Jim Beale, and [name omitted] who works for Greenbrier (sp?) in some capacity.  Furman of course is eternally appreciative to me.  He says that but for what I did for him in '86 with the transition rules he'd be out of business.  Now he's prosperous beyond imagination and gives me the entire  credit.  He's going to put up half the money Tim Lee's putting up for Georgie's business . . . .</blockquote> <p>     Senator Packwood testified that there was no connection in his mind between Mr. Furman's appreciation or gratitude for what the Senator had done with the transition rule in 1986 and Mr. Furman's participation in the venture for Mrs. Packwood.  He does not recall discussing any substantive legislative matters at this meeting.<p> <p>     With respect to the May 2, 1990 diary entry, Mr. Furman testified that he recalls attending a breakfast with the Senator around that date.  He does not recall discussing the antiques proposal at this meeting.  He testified that they had thanked Senator Packwood for his support on a number of issues in the past, but the references to being "eternally appreciative" and "prosperity beyond imagination and giving him the entire credit" is "...not at all anything that we would have said or did say.' He stated that he does not know how Senator Packwood could have come away with the impression that he was involved in financing the proposal, unless it came from Mr. Lee.  He stated that he never actually agreed with Mr. Lee to finance a business involving Mrs. Packwood.<p> <p>     Regarding the transition rule mentioned in the diary entry, Mr. Furman explained that in 1986, his company sought relief from certain provisions of the Tax Reform Act.  Greenbrier had entered into several transactions that predated the act.  Certain provisions of the act would have applied retroactively to these transactions and a8 a result, several large orders would have been cancelled.  Greenbrier was successful in obtaining a transition rule which corrected the situation.  Greenbrier's lobbyist testified that the transition rule was secured by approaching Senator Packwood and members of his Finance Committee staff and submitting a proposed transition rule.  Mr. Furman testified that they were very pleased with the transition rule because it ". . . literally saved quite a lot of the jobs . . . certainly several hundred people.  Mr. Furman did not meet with Senator Packwood on this issue, but he did meet with one of his staffers after the transition rule was obtained to express his appreciation.<p> <p>                e.   5/31/91<p> <p>     On May 31, 1991, Senator Packwood recorded an entry in his diary describing a meeting with Mr. Furman and another unidentified person in his office in which Mr. Furman was asserting that long trucks should be kept off the highways. Senator Packwood testified that he does not recall any discussions with Mr. Furman about the long or "giant" truck issue.  Senator Packwood testified that he did not agree with Mr. Furman's position on this issue.[fn 197]<p> <p>     Mr. Furman testified that the long truck or LCV (Long Combination Vehicle) issue was a major concern for Greenbrier. Greenbrier was part of a national coalition of transportation companies involved in rail transportation.  As a member of this coalition of railroad suppliers, Greenbrier's specific role was to assist the railroad industry in stopping the proliferation of LCV's on the highways.  Greenbrier's lobbying firm met with all members of the Oregon Congressional delegation, including Senator Packwood, in this effort.  There was eventually legislation in 1992 that was known as the "iced tea legislation"--the Intermodal Surface Transportation Act-- which stopped the proliferation of LCV's.  Mr. Furman met personally with Senator Packwood on this issue at least once.  Mr. Furman testified that Senator Packwood was not particularly helpful.  Mr. Furman described him as "relatively neutral, looking at both the trucking arguments and the rail arguments."<p> <p>     Senator Packwood testified that there was no discussion with Mr. Furman at any time about the job offer to Mrs. Packwood in connection with him taking or refraining from taking any official action.  Nor was there any implicit understanding or agreement that Senator Packwood would take some official action in connection with or relation to Mr. Furman participating in the venture.<p> <p>       <H4>3.   Mr. Furman's Testimony Regarding Mr. Lee:</H4><p> <p>     In describing his business relationship with Mr. Lee, Mr. Furman explained that Mr. Lee's company STS was a railcar customer of Greenbrier.  Greenbrier also leased and financed railcars for Mr. Lee personally.  Greenbrier currently has about fifty railcars loaned or leased to Mr. Lee.  Mr. Furman described Mr. Lee as an important customer.<p> <p>     Mr. Furman testified that Mr. Lee talked to him about lending him some money in connection with a business that his wife was considering in association with Mrs. Packwood.  This conversation took place subsequent to the Packwood's separation. Mr. Furman does not recall speaking with Mr. Lee's wife about the proposal.  Mr. Furman testified that Mr. Lee told him that his wife and Mrs. Packwood had worked together over the years buying and selling antiques and would become involved in the antiques business in some way. Mr. Furman-testified that he does not specifically recall the amount of money Mr. Lee mentioned, but that $50,000 might be a good approximation of the upper limit.<p> <p>     Mr. Furman testified that it was his impression that Mr. Lee was talking about a loan as opposed to an investment.  He stated that Greenbrier had loaned Mr. Lee's company money on several occasions.  Prior to this time, however, Mr. Furman does not recall ever making any loans to Mr. Lee that were unrelated to the trucking business.  Mr. Furman testified that he responded to Mr. Lee's request by telling him that it was an interesting proposition and that if Mr. Lee would prepare some sort of memorandum, he would consider it.  When asked whether Mr. Lee indicated why Mrs. Packwood would be involved, Mr. Furman stated that Mr. Lee explained that he and his wife were good friends with the Packwoods and that they were concerned about what Mrs. Packwood was going to do for a living.  There was no indication from his conversation with Mr. Lee that Mr. Lee's concern about Mrs. Packwood had originated with Senator Packwood.<p> <p>     Mr. Lee did not prepare a business plan or any type of writing on the proposal for Mr. Furman.  Mr. Furman only recalls discussing this subject with Mr. Lee on one occasion.  Mr. Furman testified that as far as he was concerned, the proposal just kind of died.  When asked about  Mr. Lee's April 14, 1990 letter to Mrs. Packwood, Mr. Furman testified that he had never seen this letter before.  He testified that he was not aware at the time that Mr. Lee actually extended any type of proposal to Mrs. Packwood.  Mr. Furman testified that he did not know Mrs. Packwood and never spoke with her about Mr. Lee's proposal.<p> <p>       <H4>4.  Summary of Senator Packwood's Response to the Evidence:</H4><p> <p>     Senator Packwood testified that unlike the other persons with whom he had discussions about jobs and income for his wife, Mr. Furman is not a longstanding friend.  The Senator recalls almost nothing by way of discussions with Mr. Furman about his involvement in the antiques proposal.  In fact, Senator Packwood says that Mr. Lee approached Mr. Furman about participating in the venture without the Senator's knowledge.  Despite diary entries to the contrary, Senator Packwood does not recall Mr. Furman being involved in the venture in November, 1989.  Rather, he does not recall Mr. Furman being involved until the spring of 1990.<p> <p>     Moreover, despite several diary entries that appear to indicate otherwise, Senator Packwood testified that there was no connection between Mr. Furman's appreciation for what the Senator had done for his company and his participation in financing the venture.   In fact, Senator Packwood denies any connection between any of his official actions and Mr. Furman's participation in partially financing the antiques venture for his wife.<p> <p>      <H4> 5.  Findings:</H4><p> <p>     Although the level of direct contact was not as extensive with Mr. Furman as it was for some of the others with whom he had discussions about jobs and income for his wife, Ethics Counsel finds that Senator Packwood did in fact encourage an offer of personal financial assistance from Mr. Furman, an individual with particularized interests in matters that the Senator could influence and in fact, had influenced in the past.<p> <p>     Ethics Counsel finds that Senator Packwood and Mr. Furman were not longstanding friends.  Moreover, Counsel finds that Senator Packwood did not initiate contact with Mr. Furman. Rather, Counsel finds that Mr. Furman was recruited to participate in financing the venture by Mr. Lee.  Although Counsel notes that Senator Packwood may not have been aware at the outset that Mr. Lee was going to enlist the assistance of Mr. Furman, Counsel finds that Senator Packwood was aware of Mr. Furman's possible participation as early as November 1989 and that he acquiesced in this participation.<p> <p>     Despite his testimony to the contrary, Counsel finds that the Senator's diary entries, recorded nearly contemporaneously with the events as they occurred, suggest that there was at least some connection between Mr. Furman's participation in financing the venture and the Senator's official position. Counsel finds that in discussing Mr. Furman's willingness to assist in the antiques venture for his wife, the Senator repeatedly refers to Mr. Furman's appreciation for official actions taken by the Senator that benefitted his company.  For example, in his diary entry dated November 9, 1989, the Senator records that he attended a breakfast sponsored by Mr. Furman which ". . was nothing but to thank me for what I had done on Trailer Train and the investment tax credit--whatever it was I got for them in the tax reform bill--and of course Furman has said he'll join Tim Lee in helping to keep Georgie solvent . . . ."  In his diary entry dated April 15, 1990, the Senator records a meeting among Mr. Lee and Mr. Furman and himself and states in part that ". . . Bill Furman is going to put up half the money . . ." and Mr. Furman said, "Bob, there's no quid pro quo.  You've done so much for my company and done so much for this state and I just want to do anything I can to make your continued existence in politics possible . . . ."   And, in a diary entry dated May 2, 1990, the Senator records a meeting with Mr. Furman and states in part, "Furman of course is eternally appreciative to me.  He says that but for what I did for him in '86 with the transition rules he'd be out of business. Now he's prosperous beyond imagination and gives me the entire credit.  He's going to put up half the money Tim Lee's putting up for Georgie's business . . . ."<p> <p>     Counsel finds that Mr. Furman had specific and direct interests in a number of legislative matters at various times that the Senator could influence by virtue of his positions on the Committee on Finance and the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, including (but not limited to) the 1986 transition rule discussed above, the Trailer Train issue, and the LCV issue .<p> <p>     Counsel notes that Mr. Furman denies speaking directly to the Senator about the venture and further denies actually agreeing to provide the financing. Counsel, however, is persuaded to the contrary by the Senator's April 15, 1990 diary entry recording a discussion between the two of them about the matter, and also by a letter from the Senator to Mr. Furman dated April 19, 1990 in which the Senator states in part, "Thanks so much for your all of your help.  I won't forget it.  Sunday night was delightful . . ."<p> <p>     Counsel finds that Mr. Furman did not speak directly to Mrs. Packwood about his participation.  Counsel further finds that Mrs. Packwood was not aware of Mr. Furman's involvement in the venture.<p> <p> <p> <H3>D.   Ron Crawford:</H3><p> <p>        <H4>1.   Background:</H4><p> <p>     Ron Crawford first met Senator Packwood in 1968 during the recount of his first election.  Mr. Crawford described the Senator as one of his best friends. Mr. Crawford's consulting business is called F.P. Research Associates and he is a registered lobbyist.  There is also a fundraising component to his business, but that is handled by his son.<p> <p>     In Senator Packwood's 1992 campaign, Mr. Crawford's firm was involved in raising money from PAC's around the country.[fn 198] Mr. Crawford has been active in fundraising in every one of Senator Packwood's campaigns.  In 1991-92, Senator Packwood's reelection campaign paid Mr. Crawford's firm approximately $60,000 for fundraising, consulting and event management.<p> <p>     Mr. Crawford is a registered lobbyist for the National Cable Television Association and the American Bus Association and has been so since the early 1980's.  At the time of his deposition, he had recently registered as a lobbyist for the Sturm Ruger Company.  He has a ten year business relationship with this company.  At the time of hi6 deposition, he also recently had become a lobbyist for the National Restaurant Association.  He ha6 previously represented Shell Oil[fn 199], the American Iron and Steel Institute, General Motors, the Pharmaceutical Manufacturer's Association[fn 200], Caribbean Marine, and Northrop as a registered lobbyist.[fn 201]<p> <p>     <H4> 2.   Diary Entries Referring to Mr. Crawford and Job Offers for Mrs. Packwood and Related Testimony:</H4><p> <p>      a.   10/18/89<p> <p>     On October 18, 1989, in the context of discussing the persons he was contacting or contemplating contacting about income for his wife, Senator Packwood first recorded an entry in his diary referring to Mr. Crawford and job offers for his wife:<blockquote> <p> ". . . Talked to Ron Crawford.  He'll put up $7500 a year for Georgie.  That's three out of three and I haven't even hit up [name omitted] or Steve Saunders . . .</blockquote> <p>     When asked whether he asked Mr. Crawford to extend a job offer to his wife, Senator Packwood testified that he believes that Mr. Crawford first broached the subject rather than him asking Mr. Crawford to extend the job offer.  He testified that he does not recall the circumstances as to how this subject arose.  He explained, "This is one of those where you talk with somebody three and four times a day and you have dinner with them twice a month and you are so closely interlinked with them, you can't conceivably recall who said what when.'  He further stated that he does not know how they came upon the figure of $7500 a year.<p> <p>     Mr. Crawford testified that he had discussions with Senator Packwood about the Senator's concerns about his children and wife and the political implications of a separation and divorce a few months before the Senator separated from Mrs. Packwood in January of 1990.  Mr. Crawford testified that Senator Packwood may have expressed concern about the financial impact of a divorce, but he cannot really recall.  He does recall talking about the expenses of a divorce with the Senator.<p> <p>     Mr. Crawford testified that he does not recall Senator Packwood ever asking him to provide his wife with income or employment. Rather, he stated that he offered to help Mrs. Packwood.  He stated that he was concerned for both Senator and Mrs. Packwood because of the divorce.  He testified that at the time, he was trying to enhance his master list of names of contributors by collecting more information about them so that he would potentially have names available around the country to assist him in his lobbying efforts.  He testified that he was also trying to think of things that might be helpful to Mrs. Packwood.  He stated that he knew things were going to be tough for the Packwoods financially and this proposal would be a way that she could help him and he could help her.[fn 202]<p> <p>      Mr. Crawford testified that he is confident that he discussed this proposed employment with Senator Packwood, but he does not recall the circumstances.  He thinks he made a comment along the lines of: "...well, I've got some stuff that I'd love to have somebody like Georgie do."   He does not recall Senator Packwood ever mentioning a specific amount of money he wanted Mrs. Packwood to earn.  He testified that Senator Packwood may have come to the $7500 a year figure because Mr. Crawford must have told him that he thought Mrs. Packwood could work on a part-time basis and that [name omitted] could pay her between $400 and $600 a month.  However, they never got to a point where they discussed dollars in concrete terms because Mrs. Packwood never called him back to explore the job offer.  Mr. Crawford testified that he telephoned Mrs. Packwood on two or three occasions but did not actually speak to her, leaving messages on her answering machine. Mr. Crawford testified that he must have told the Senator that he was unable to reach Mrs. Packwood and that the Senator may have suggested that Mr. Crawford write her a letter.<p> <p>        b.   1/18/90<p> <p>     Senator Packwood again referred to Mr. Crawford in a diary entry dated January 18, 1990.  In this entry, Senator Packwood described the success he had had to date in obtaining offers of employment for his wife:<blockquote> <p> . . . It's funny.  I hit [name omitted] up.  He says "yes." a close friend but not as close as Cliff.  The same with Saunders, same with Ron.  They just say bang, bang, bang-- yes.  But not Cliff.  That means next week I've got to turn to Saunders and then to Crawford.</blockquote> <p>     Senator Packwood testified that the discussions about job offers for his wife did not happen with military-like precision. He stated, "It was all merging and I was kind of trying to come up with this total of $20,000 if I could."<p> <p>        c.   3/27/90<p> <p>     On March 27, 1990, Senator Packwood again referenced Mr. Crawford in his diary in connection with a job offer or income to Mrs. Packwood:<blockquote> <p> ". . . Finally Ron Crawford rescued me and we went off to dinner at the Phoenix Park.  In his usual optimistic fashion he went over the [Senate] races he thought we would win...I told him I thought he was unduly optimistic but I thought we could pick up the Senate in '92.  Crawford goes, "Shit." He says, "I need the money." I said, "Well, if you're going to support Georgie in the style to which I'd like her to become accustomed . . ." and he laughed.  He says, "Yeah, I'll guarantee the $7500 for five years. And he said, "If you're Chairman of the Finance Committee I can probably double that."  We both laughed.  I don't intend to do that.  I frankly don't intend this supplement to Georgie to last more than five years in any event.  I'd also talked to Tim Lee today to reverify his $10,000 and $10,000 from Bill Furman for Georgie.  She'll have basically $30,000 to $40,000 in income for five years so long as I remain in the Senate.</blockquote> <p>     Senator Packwood testified that Mr. Crawford's job offer to Mrs. Packwood was in no way conditioned upon or contingent upon him remaining in the Senate or serving as Chairman of the Finance Committee.  He explained the above entry as follows:<blockquote> <p> That remark is one between two guys that are drinking and said in jest in this sense.  You know what happens when parties change control and all of a sudden all of the lobbying groups that are Republican, clients come in.  When the Democrats are in control, the clients go again.  That is said in jest.  I never had any intention of that.  He didn't have any intention of that and it was purely a humorous remark between us.  Again, I want to give the same caveat to all of these conversations, but I just want to say that we both laughed . . . Any of these conversations that have quotation marks, and especially if I'd been drinking, is suspect.</blockquote> <p>      A page from Mr. Crawford's calendar indicates that he met and had dinner with Senator Packwood on March 27, 1990.  He does not recall any discussion with Senator Packwood on March 27 about employment or income for Mrs. Packwood. He testified that Senator Packwood did not ask him to send a letter to Mrs. Packwood offering employment and specifying $7500 a year as income.  Nor does he recall Senator Packwood ever discussing the $7500 as a figure he hoped Mr. Crawford would be able to provide. He stated that he was only trying to help a family that he and his wife loved dearly.<p> <p>         d.   4/15/90<p> <p>     Senator Packwood again made reference to Mr. Crawford in connection with a job offer to his wife in a diary entry dated April 15, 1990:<blockquote> <p> ". . . but at least we have the ducks lined up. [name omitted] at $5,000, Tim Lee and Bill Furman at $20,000, Steve Saunders at whatever adds to the total of $25,000 and I'll have Ron Crawford send her a letter that says 'Georgie, I'd be willing to talk with you about employment,' perhaps having put in the letter in the magnitude of $7500 a year.</blockquote> <p>     Senator Packwood testified that he cannot recall whether it was his suggestion or recommendation to Mr. Crawford to reduce his job offer to Mrs. Packwood to writing.  Nor does he recall whether he suggested any language to go into such a writing.   In fact, he testified that he is not sure he ever saw the letter until after it was sent.<p> <p>        e.   6/6/90<p> <p>     On June 6, 1990, Senator Packwood recorded in his diary another contact with Mr. Crawford involving the job offer to his wife:<blockquote> <p> Had a phone call with Ron Crawford and I told him to re-call Georgie and make the offer . . . </blockquote> <p>     Senator Packwood testified that he may have mentioned an offer from Mr. Crawford to his wife and she indicated that she preferred not to talk to him. The Senator testified that he does not believe Mrs. Packwood and Mr. Crawford ever actually communicated.<p> <p>     Mr. Crawford testified that he had never previously spoken with Mrs. Packwood about working for him.  Nor had she ever expressed an interest in working with his firm.  Mr. Crawford testified that Senator Packwood did not ask him to go back again and try to contact her when she did not respond.  Mr. Crawford does not recall any discussions with the Senator after he advised him that he had not heard from Mrs. Packwood.  He testified that his offer of employment was to help Mrs. Packwood.  He did not have any discussions with Senator Packwood about whether the job offer would help him as well.<p> <p>     The evidence indicates that Mr. Crawford did, in fact, send a letter to Mrs. Packwood dated June 13, 1990.  In this letter, Mr. Crawford indicated that he wanted to ". . . discuss what I believe could be several business opportunities that you might be interested in."  Although his letter mentions "several business opportunities," Mr. Crawford testified there was only one. He never received a response from Mrs. Packwood and he has not spoken to her since before the divorce.  When asked what his understanding was of the nature of the job being offered by Mr. Crawford.  Senator Packwood explained that his wife had a great political background in that she had managed his 1962 and 1964 legislative campaigns and travelled around the state with him in 1968, 1974 and 1980.  He testified that he believes she would have been a great consultant or campaign manager.<p> <p>       <H4>3.   Legislative Matters of Interest to Mr. Crawford: </H4><p> <p>           a.   Cable Regulation:<p> <p>     Regarding specific legislative matters of interest to Mr. Crawford's clients, a Commerce Committee vote took place on June 7, 1990 to re-regulate the cable industry, six days before Mr. Crawford sent his written employment proposal to Mrs. Packwood. Senator Packwood cast the lone dissenting vote on this bill.  In explaining this situation, Senator Packwood testified as follows:<blockquote> <p> "[It was] . . .  an outrageous, foolish bill . . . My staffer wrote the bill, the Cable Deregulation Act of 1984.  And over fierce opposition, we deregulated cable prices and we said in exchange to cable what we want is more channels and better programming.  And we got it in spades and then this damn bill came along to re-regulate it.  It was a step backward.  I hope we undo it.  I'm going to try and undo it. And that is the background of that vote.</blockquote> <p>     He testified that he never had any discussions with Mr. Crawford about the job offer to Mrs. Packwood in connection with his position on this piece of legislation, which he described as "adamant."  Mr. Crawford testified that he may or may not have spoken to Senator Packwood about this bill, but he stated that he seldom talked to Senator Packwood on cable issues because for the most part, he knew where the Senator was coming from.<p> <p>     On September 27, 1990, Senator Packwood noted in his diary that Mr. Crawford was in to see him with a representative of the cable industry.  The Senator recorded that they wanted his advice as to whether they should let a cable bill come up for consideration or attempt to stop it.  Senator Packwood noted that he advised them to try and stop it.  Senator Packwood testified that he does not recall any discussion with Mr. Crawford at this time about the status of the job offer.  He further testified that he did not need to be lobbied on this matter because the cable industry's position was identical to his.  He explained that this was a re-regulatory bill and that he and others wanted to filibuster it to the end of the session if possible.  He testified that he cannot recall whether they held the bill or it came up, although he was successful in eventually killing the bill.<p> <p>       b.   The Gun Lobby:<p> <p>     Later in the September 27, 1990 diary entry referenced above, Senator Packwood recorded that Mr. Crawford stayed on to discuss the National Rifle Association.  He noted that, ". . . Ron is big, big with the National Rifle Association."   Senator Packwood testified that he meant that Mr. Crawford is active in the NRA and "owns a lot of guns."  He stated that he does not think Mr. Crawford represents the NRA.  Mr. Crawford testified that he does not do work for the NRA, although "he talks to them intermittently."<p> <p>     Senator Packwood testified that Mr. Crawford brought the issue of exempting custom gunsmiths from a firearms excise tax on behalf of the NRA to his attention.  Staff memos indicate that Senator Packwood and his staff focused on this issue between February and April, 1991.  In April of 1991, Senator Packwood introduced a bill exempting custom gunsmiths who make less than 50 firearms per year from the firearms excise tax.  Senator Packwood testified that there was never any discussion with Mr. Crawford about the job offer to Mrs. Packwood in connection with his position on this particular piece of legislation.<p> <p>        c.   Miscellaneous:<p> <p>     Mr. Crawford testified that in the 1989-90 time period, his client the American Bus Association was concerned with the three cent diesel fuel tax exemption.  His only contact with Senator Packwood or his staff on this issue would have been to simply confirm that it was not a problem.  His client the American Iron and Steel Institute was interested in the issue of voluntary restraints in 1989-90.  Senator Packwood opposed their position. Mr. Crawford does not recall meeting with Senator Packwood on this issue, although he did meet with staff.<p> <p>      <H4>4.   Appointment of Mr. Crawford's Wife to the ITC:</H4><p> <p>       In addition, Senator Packwood played a major role in helping Mr. Crawford's wife, Carol Crawford, become appointed to the International Trade Commission in 1991.  Senator Packwood testified that he was her primary supporter in her bid to become a member of the ITC.  When asked whether there was ever any discussion with either Mr. Crawford or his wife about his support for her for the ITC position in connection with Mr. Crawford extending a job offer to Mrs. Packwood, Senator Packwood testified, "There never is any linkage at any time in my dealings with Ron or Carol and a job for Georgie."<p> <p>         <H4>5.   Mrs. Packwood's Testimony:</H4><p> <p>     Mrs. Packwood testified that she and Senator Packwood had been friends with Mr. Crawford and his wife in the past, although Senator Packwood saw them much more frequently than she did.  She testified that she did not return any of Mr. Crawford's telephone calls and never had any discussion with him about his proposal. She learned why Mr. Crawford was calling from her husband.  She stated that she would not have been interested in business opportunities with him unless they involved her "already in place" antique business.  Mrs. Packwood explained that she felt very uncomfortable with the whole situation, particularly with Mr. Crawford and his wife, because she believed they had been "aiding and abetting" the break-up with her husband.  As a result, she did not want to have anything to do with Mr. Crawford, who she did not regard as a friend.<p> <p>      <H4>6.  Summary of Senator Packwood's Response to the Evidence:</H4><p> <p>     Senator Packwood asserts that Mr. Crawford is an old friend who first broached the subject of extending a job offer to his wife.  The Senator maintains that he was merely following up on Mr. Crawford's offer of assistance when he discussed jobs and income for Mrs. Packwood.  He states he does not recall the circumstances as to how this subject arose.  He testified he turned to Mr. Crawford because of their longstanding friendship and not for reasons related to his official position.<p> <p>     With respect to his October 18, 1989 diary entry where he records that Mr. Crawford will "put up" $7500 a year for his wife, Senator Packwood claims he does not know who said what when with respect to the job offer for Mrs. Packwood.  He contends that he does not know how they arrived at the figure of $7500 a year.  With respect to his March 27, 1990 diary entry where he records that his wife will have $30,000 to $40,000 in income for five years from the offers he has secured "so long as I remain in the Senate," Senator Packwood claims that Mr. Crawford's job offer was in no way conditioned upon or contingent upon him remaining in the Senate or serving as Chairman of the Committee on Finance.<p> <p>     Regarding his April 15, 1990 diary entry where he records that he will have Mr. Crawford send his wife a letter about employment, Senator Packwood maintains that he does not recall whether he suggested that Mr. Crawford reduce his job offer to writing.  Other than Mr. Crawford's June 13, 1990 letter to Mrs. Packwood in which he invites her to explore "business opportunities" with him, Senator Packwood does not believe Mr. Crawford and his wife actually spoke about Mr. Crawford's job offer.<p> <p>     Senator Packwood notes that his lone dissenting vote on a bill before the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation to re-regulate the cable industry six days before Mr. Crawford sent hi6 written employment proposal to Mrs. Packwood was entirely consistent with his deregulatory philosophy and his earlier positions with respect to deregulation of the cable industry.  He asserts that he never had any discussions with Mr. Crawford about the job offer to Mrs. Packwood in connection with his position on matters affecting the cable industry.  Similarly, he states that he never had any discussion with Mr. Crawford about the job offer to Mrs. Packwood in connection with his bill to exempt custom gunsmiths from a firearms excise tax in 1991, although he acknowledges that Mr. Crawford brought this issue to his attention. Additionally, although he acknowledges that he was the primary supporter of Mr. Crawford's wife in her bid to become a member of the ITC, Senator Packwood denies any linkage between his support of her and the job offer to his wife.<p> <p>     <H4>7.  Findings:</H4><p> <p>     Senate Ethics Counsel finds that Senator Packwood did in fact solicit or otherwise encourage an offer of- personal financial assistance from Mr. Crawford, an individual representing clients with particularized interests in matters that the Senator could influence.<p> <p>     Counsel finds that Senator Packwood and Mr. Crawford conducted discussions about jobs and income for Mrs. Packwood at a time when Mr. Crawford was representing clients with specific and direct interests in matters that Senator Packwood could influence by virtue of his positions on the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation and the Committee on Finance.  Although both have testified that Mr. Crawford first offered to help and Senator Packwood then followed up, the weight of the evidence suggests that Senator Packwood's role in encouraging and coordinating job offers for his wife was significant.  In fact, Ethics Counsel finds that Senator Packwood's discussions with Mr. Crawford about job offers and income for his wife comprised part of a deliberate and systematic plan by the Senator to accumulate approximately $20,000 in job offers for his spouse in an attempt to reduce his alimony obligation.   Additionally, Counsel finds that Mrs. Packwood was not looking for a job at the time the Senator engaged Mr. Crawford in discussion about providing a job offer to her.<p> <p>     Ethics Counsel finds that Mr. Crawford's offer of assistance was extended after the Senator expressed concern about the costs associated with a divorce. Moreover, Counsel finds that the Senator's diary entries, recorded nearly contemporaneously with the events as they occurred, suggest that the Senator played a more active role than simply following up with Mr. Crawford, as evidenced by the Senator's use of language such as "hit up," "accept the offers that I've solicited," instructing Mr. Crawford to ". . . re-call Georgie and make the offer," and "I'll have Ron Crawford send her a letter. . .  about employment.<p> <p>     Ethics Counsel finds that Mr. Crawford and Senator Packwood did have a longstanding friendship dating back to 1969. Notwithstanding this friendship, Counsel finds that at the time they were discussing job offers and income for Mrs. Packwood, Mr. Crawford was representing a number of entities, including the National Cable Television Association, with particular interests in matters that the Senator could influence.  Counsel notes that Senator Packwood has consistently supported deregulation of the cable industry and that his vote in June of 1990 was entirely consistent with his deregulatory philosophy.<p> <p>     Moreover, despite their friendship, Counsel finds that there '6 evidence to suggest that there was some connection between Senator Packwood's official position and his relationship with Mr. Crawford.  For example, in a diary entry dated October 8, 1991, Senator Packwood records, "The advantage Ron brings to me in the Washington PAC scene is that much of his income is dependent upon his relationship with me."  In an entry dated July 11, 1990, he records ". . . Ron wanted me to meet with them because they want to retain Ron because, as Ron says, "People hear that you're tough to get to and they know I can get to you." On March 27, 1990, while discussing the job offers he had coordinated for his wife, the Senator recorded that his wife would have an income "supplement" so long "as I remain in the Senate."  And, on September 13, 1989, Senator Packwood recorded the following conversation when Mr. Crawford was in to see him on behalf of a client:  "He [Crawford] said, "I know how much you hate the oil companies."  I said, "Ron, I still hate the oil companies but I'll do you a favor."<p> <p>     Counsel finds that Mr. Crawford extended his offer of employment in writing to Mrs. Packwood in a letter dated June 13, 1990.  Counsel further finds that Mrs. Packwood did not accept the offer.<p> <p> <H3>E.   Clifford Alexander:</H3><p> <p> <H4>1.   Background:</H4><p> <p>     Clifford Alexander is the president of a corporate consulting firm.  He stated that his firm's work principally involves work force inclusiveness or increasing opportunities in the work force for minorities and women.  His firm also performs lobbying in a number of different areas.  Another aspect of the services provided by his firm is corporate social responsibility. He first met the Packwoods twenty-five years ago.  They became close friends and he and his wife have continued their relationship with Mrs. Packwood.  The same is not true with the Senator. coinciding with the time of the Packwood's separation.<p> <p> <H4>2.   Diary Entry Referring to Mr. Alexander and Job Offers for Mrs. Packwood and Related Testimony:</H4><p> <p>        a.   1/18/90<p> <p>     On January 18, 1990, Senator Packwood recorded the following entry in his diary relating to Mr. Alexander and a job for his wife:<blockquote> <p> A quick lunch with Cliff.  It was a nice friendly lunch.  He said, "Is there anything I can do?" I hit him up to give a job to Georgie, but he said, "Gosh, we've got that ICI client.  It wouldn't look good."  I said, "It doesn't matter if we're separated."  Well, Cliff said...and this was after he was bragging about all the money he had, how much they're making, how much he's setting aside, what kind of trust he has for the kids and that he needs to work five more years until he can retire comfortably on his investments and income for the rest of his life, but not enough money for Georgie.  It's funny.  I hit [name omitted] up. He says 'yes.' [name omitted] a close friend but not as close as Cliff.  The same with Saunders, same with Ron.  They just say bang, bang bang--yes.  But not Cliff. That means next week I've got to turn to Saunders and then to Crawford.</blockquote> <p>     Senator Packwood testified that he recalls telling Mr. Alexander and his wife that he had separated.  He stated that he recalls talking to Mr. Alexander about providing a job offer to Mrs. Packwood.  In this regard, the Senator testified that in this particular case, ". . . I approached him if he could be of some help.   When asked whether his conversation with Mr. Alexander proceeded along the lines described in the diary entry, Senator Packwood testified as follows:<blockquote> <p> A:  I don't remember his reference to ICI.  What I remember, and I was kind of disappointed because he had--Cliff is a wonderful guy and a buoyant guy, and from time to time he would tell me how successful he was doing . . . And he was making very good money, and we were close friends and I remember I was disappointed when he said he couldn't help. Do I remember this specific conversation?  No.  Do I remember the ICI reference? No. But I remember I was kind of hurt by it.<p> <p> Q:  Put you do recall asking him to provide a job for Mrs. Packwood; is that correct?<p> <p> A:  Yes.  I guess I would have thought of all the people I could go to that was close, close friends that could have helped, it would have been Cliff.<p> <p> Q:  Do you recall what his response was?<p> <p> A:  Well, I don't recall him--I see ICI here.  I don't remember him mentioning that.  I just remember the hurt when he couldn't do it--wouldn't do it.<p> <p> Q:  But you don't recall a specific reason or explanation that he offered as to why he couldn't do it?<p> <p> A:  No.</blockquote> <p>       <H4>3.   Mr. Alexander's Testimony</H4><p> <p>     Mr. Alexander testified that he learned of the Packwood's separation some time in 1990.  Regarding the January 18, 1990 diary entry, Mr. Alexander testified that he does not recall having lunch with the Senator.  He does not recall Senator Packwood asking him to provide a job to his wife, although he said this could have happened.  He stated that had there been a need,-Mrs. Packwood would have approached him directly.  He stated that he would not have mentioned the ICI client in the way noted in the diary.  Instead, he would have simply said no.  Mr. Alexander does not recall talking to the Senator about a trust for his children and the fact that he needed to work five more years until he could comfortably retire.  In fact, he testified that he does not have any trusts set up for his children and he does not plan to retire.  He does not recall any discussion with Senator Packwood in which the Senator indicated that it would help their financial situation if his wife were able to find a job. He testified that he never helped find her a job.<p> <p>     Mr. Alexander testified that he does not recall any other occasion when Senator Packwood said anything about his wife needing a job.  He stated that Mrs. Packwood did mention that she had been approached about employment, but he does not recall any names she may have mentioned.  He testified that there may have been discussions with her about Senator Packwood's role in persons approaching her about job opportunities, but he does not recall any specifics.<p> <p>        <H4>4. Legislative Matters of Interest to Mr. Alexander:</H4><p> <p>     During the 1989 to 1991 time period, Mr. Alexander was retained by the Investment Company Institute ("ICI"), the national trade association for the mutual fund industry, to advance ICI's position on several legislative matters. Some of these matters included securing permanent repeal of the 2% floor on miscellaneous itemized business deductions; securing repeal of the 30/30 rule that applied to mutual funds  and opposing the Securities Transfer Excise Tax ("STET").  Mr. Alexander testified that he communicated with Senator Packwood or his Finance Committee staff on a number of occasions during the 1989-1991 time period in order to advocate ICI's position on these issues.<p> <p>        <H4>5.   Mrs. Packwood's Testimony:</H4><p> <p>     Mrs. Packwood testified that she never had any indication from Mr. Alexander that he had been asked by the Senator to try and find her some type of employment.<p> <p>        <H4>6.  Summary of Senator Packwood's Response to the Evidence:</H4><p> <p>      Senator Packwood's response to the evidence related to his contact with Mr. Alexander is unique in that this is the only case where Senator Packwood admits that he initiated the request for help as opposed to following up on an offer of assistance. Here, Senator Packwood acknowledges that he approached Mr. Alexander to see if he might be able to help with a job for his wife.  Senator Packwood notes that Mr. Alexander was an old and good friend.<p> <p>     With respect to his January 18, 1990 diary entry in which he records that he had lunch with Mr. Alexander and "hit him up to give a job to Georgie," Senator Packwood recalls telling Mr. Alexander that he had separated from his wife and he recalls talking with him about providing a job offer for Mrs. Packwood. He recalls asking Mr. Alexander to provide a job for Mrs. Packwood and being disappointed and hurt when his close friend refused to help.  The Senator does not recall Mr. Alexander making mention of the appearance problem that might be created because of his representation of a client called ICI.<p> <p>       <H4>7.  Findings:</H4><p> <p>     Senate Ethics Counsel finds that Senator Packwood did in fact solicit or otherwise encourage an offer of personal financial assistance from Mr. Alexander, an individual representing a client with particularized interests in matters that the Senator could influence.<p> <p>     Counsel finds that Senator Packwood's discussion with Mr. Alexander about job offers for his wife comprised part of a deliberate and systematic plan to accumulate approximately $20,000 in job offers for his spouse in an attempt to reduce his alimony obligation.  Counsel also finds that Mrs. Packwood was not looking for a job at the time Senator Packwood asked Mr. Alexander to provide a job offer to her.<p> <p>     Counsel finds that Mr. Alexander and Senator Packwood did have a longstanding friendship dating back to the time that the Senator arrived in Washington, D.C.  Notwithstanding this friendship, Counsel finds that at the time Senator Packwood requested Mr. Alexander to provide a job offer to his wife, Mr. Alexander was representing ICI, a client who had specific and direct interests in matters that the Senator could influence by virtue of his position on the Committee on Finance.  More specifically, ICI had a particular interest in issues such as the STET, the 30/30 rule, and final repeal of the 2% floor on miscellaneous itemized deductions.  Further, Counsel finds that there is evidence in the Senator's January 18, 1990 diary entry to suggest that Mr. Alexander raised the potential appearance problem caused by his representation of ICI with the Senator and that the Senator dismissed this concern.<p> <p>     Counsel finds that Mr. Alexander never extended an offer of employment or income to Mrs. Packwood.  Counsel further finds that Mrs. Packwood was not aware that the Senator had requested Mr. Alexander to provide her employment. Counsel notes that Mr. Alexander does not recall the Senator asking him to provide a job to his wife, although he admits the possibility of such a request.<p> <p> <p> <H4>F.  Further Findings Regarding Solicitation of Jobs</H4><p> <p>      Counsel finds that Senator Packwood's efforts to obtain employment for his estranged spouse in an attempt to reduce any future alimony payment did not involve any <I>quid pro quo</I> and that he did not agree to receive or accept any financial benefit "for or because of any official act."  As is clear from Senate precedent, however, conduct which does not rise to such an egregious level may, nonetheless, be improper.<p> <p>     With respect to his contacts concerning possible employment of his spouse with the five individuals discussed above, Senate Ethics Counsel finds that Senator Packwood engaged in a series of interconnected activities which linked his personal financial gain to his position as a United States Senator.<p> <p>     Counsel also finds that, notwithstanding the willingness of friends to be of assistance, Senator Packwood's role in encouraging and coordinating job offers for his wife was the predominant force responsible for such offers in this case. Counsel further finds that Senator Packwood conceived of, undertook and executed a deliberate and systematic plan to enhance his personal financial position in a manner which was greatly reliant for its success upon his position as a United States Senator and the legislative interests of those whom he solicited or encouraged.  In this regard, Counsel notes the power inherent in the position of a United States Senator and the natural desire of persons and groups with substantial interests in legislation to have access to and ingratiate themselves with those whose decisions can significantly affect those interests.<p> <p>     Ethics Counsel finds that Senator Packwood's conduct in these activities reflects an abuse of his United States Senate office and constitutes improper conduct which ha6 brought discredit upon the Senate.<p> <p> <p><a name=reso.htm> <H2>VII. FINDINGS OF VIOLATIONS AS NOTICED AND SPECIFIED IN THE COMMITTEE'S RESOLUTION</H2></a><p> <p>     As to the violations noticed in the Committee's Resolution of May 16, 1995, Senate Ethics Counsel incorporates the findings set forth in Sections IV, V, and VI, above, as summarized below:<p> <p>     A.   Senator Packwood abused his United States Senate office by improper conduct which has brought discredit upon the United States Senate, by engaging in a pattern of sexual misconduct between 1969 and 1990.<p> <p>     B.   Senator Packwood engaged in improper conduct which has brought discredit upon the United States Senate, by intentionally altering diary materials that he knew or should have known the Committee had sought or would likely seek as part of its investigation.<p> <p>     C.   Senator Packwood abused his United States Senate office and engaged in improper conduct which has brought discredit upon the United States Senate, by inappropriately linking personal financial gain to his official position, in that he solicited or otherwise encouraged offers of financial assistance from five persons who had a particular interest in legislation or issues that he could influence.<p> <p> <UL><UL><UL><UL><UL><UL>     Respectfully Submitted,<p>       Victor M. Baird<br>      Chief Counsel<p>       Linda S. Chapman<br>      David M. Feitel<br>      Staff Counsel<p></UL></UL></UL></UL></ul></ul> <p> <H3>Endnotes</H3><tt><font size=-1> <p>  <p> <p> 172.  This information was referred to the Department of Justice pursuant to Rule 8(a) of the Committee's Rules of Procedure on or about November 22, 1993. On June 28, 1'995, the Department of Justice informed the Committee that it had declined criminal prosecution of the allegations related to job opportunities for the Senator's wife.<p> <p> 173.  The fact of this meeting is supported by a letter dated November 6, 1989, in which Senator Packwood thanked Mr. Saunders for meeting with him.  Mr. Saunders testified that he never received this letter.<p> <p> 174.  This entry is supported by Senator Packwood's handwritten calendar of events, which reads "Finance for Saunders" on November 6, 1989 at 2:00 p.m.<p> <p> 175.  The two questions read into the record by Senator Packwood for Mr. Spero, which explore the differences between the U.S. and Japanese patent systems, appear on page 3 of the hearing transcript.<p> <p> 176.  Senator Packwood testified that while the questions could have been submitted by Mr. Saunders, he did not know that was the case at the time. He further testified that he does not recall having any discussion with Mr. Saunders at any time about the questions he had submitted for his consideration.<p> <p> 177.  Senator Packwood testified that he has no recollection of changing his schedule to attend the hearing. Mr. Saunders testified that he persuaded the Senator to make at least a brief personal appearance at the hearing.<p> <p> 178.  Senator Packwood's diary entry of February 28, 1989 confirms his attendance at this subcommittee hearing.  At the end of the passage, Senator Packwood records, "I think we have laid to rest the Fusion problem."  In explaining what he meant by "laying to rest the Fusion problem," Senator Packwood testified that,"... I wasn't going to let him [Spero] use the hearing process to try to get us to force the Japanese to give him something that he didn't deserve.  I had hoped I guess on this day that we had finally killed it."  In a background memo for this hearing dated February 27, 1989, one of the Senator's staffers notes that Senator Packwood was "brought into this issue by Steve Saunders, on behalf of Mitsubishi."<p> <p> 179.  Senator Packwood testified that he is not sure what he meant by "hold it in reserve."  He explained that he hoped Mrs. Packwood could make $20,000 in her own antique business. The other $20,000 refers to the collective amount from the various opportunities being offered by his friends.  He further explained that "asset base" refers to the proceeds from the sale of their house.  He ~acknowledged that to the extent Mrs. Packwood was able to earn more money, his responsibility in terms of alimony would be less.<p> <p> 180.  In an entry on the Cormack transcript dated November 21, 1989, and received by the Committee from Judge Starr after Senator Packwood's deposition, Senator Packwood recorded: <p> <p> "It's time now to accept the offers that I've solicited from Crawford and Steve and [name omitted].  That will give her $201,000 right now.  Then I'll talk to Cliff Alexander perhaps. [name omitted]. I wouldn't mind getting her to about $30,000 here without initially calling on Tim Lee and Bill Furman in Portland."<p> <p> 181.  Senator Packwood testified that he meant what Mr. Saunders would be willing to employ her for if she was willing to provide services of value.<p> <p> 182.  Senator Packwood testified that he discussed the arrangement involving job offers to his wife with his friend Jack Faust, who is an attorney.  He also discussed it with Jack Quinn, who the Senator described as a lawyer at Arnold &amp; Porter and an expert in ethics rules.  In his appearance before the Committee, Senator Packwood again referred to Mr. Quinn's advice and stated that Mr. Quinn had provided him a memo on the subject.  Mr. Quinn's correspondence and accompanying memo to the Senator are dated June 25, 1990. Senator Packwood also initially suggested that he might have discussed the subject with Mr. Wilson Abney, formerly of the Senate Ethics Committee staff. He later clarified that he did not have any discussion with Mr. Abney about the job offers for Mrs. Packwood, although he did have discussions with him about the filing requirements if he and his wife were living separately but still married.  This testimony is supported by an entry in his diary dated January 24, 1990 and an exchange of correspondence dated January 25 and February 6, 1990, respectively.<p> <p> 183.  Mr. Saunders testified that this trip was part of his effort to interest Mrs. Packwood in the sculpture business.<p> <p> 184.  In his statement before the Committee, Senator Packwood again referred to Mr. Quinn and stated that before he started talking with persons about job offers, he spoke with Mr. Quinn about the subject and that Mr. Quinn sent him information about gratuities, bribery and gifts.   Mr. Quinn's correspondence to the Senator is dated June 25, 1990, after the Senator had already coordinated the job offers for his wife.  Moreover, in his letter, Mr. Quinn states that he needs to do more research and thinking on the subject.  He then cautions, "In the facts at hand, we have to be concerned with the coincidence of your influence over financial opportunities made available to Georgie and the fact that there is an indirect benefit from them to you."<p> <p> 185.  Mr. Lee testified that prior to his wife's October 1989 trip with Mrs. Packwood, there had been general off and on conversations for years between him and his wife about "...doing something in antiques involving Georgie.<p> <p> 186.  These protections were based on the profits his wife had made on sales of items purchased in the east and conversations with his wife's family, who own an antique business.  Mr. Lee does not recall discussing the details of his April 14 proposal with his wife.<p> <p> 187.  Senator Packwood testified that he cannot remember whether he suggested that Mr. Lee reduce his proposal to Mrs. Packwood to writing.<p> <p> 188.  Mr. Lee does not recall discussing the legitimacy of the antiques business with Mr. Furman.<p> <p> 189.  Mr. Furman would have been required to come up with either $25,000 or S50,000 to capitalize his half of the venture.<p> <p> 190.  Mr. Lee testified that he informed Senator Packwood of Mr. Furman's involvement right before or right after the letter was sent. He later testified that he could have told the Senator about Mr. Furman's involvement earlier. Mr. Lee does not recall Mr. Furman or Senator Packwood ever indicating that they did not want Mr. Furman's name associated with the venture.<p> <p> 191. In a memo from Mr. Lee to the Senator dated November 14, 1991, Mr. Lee arranged for a meeting between representatives of Scott Paper and Senator Packwood.  In a diary entry dated November 15, 1991, the Senator noted that there was discussion at this meeting about Scott making a $3,000 contribution to him. Senator Packwood testified that he does not recall any discussion of the Maislin decision or the Negotiated Rates Equity Act or the job offer to Mrs. Packwood in connection with this meeting.<p> <p> 192.   As of February 6, 1991, Mr. Lee continued to hold open his offer of employment to Mrs. Packwood.  Senator Packwood does not recall any specific conversations with him about the job offer at this time.<p> <p> 193.  Senator Packwood corresponded with the ICC regarding Trailer Train on a number of occasions.<p> <p> 194.  This breakfast meeting is referenced in a letter dated November 13, 1989 from Mr. Furman to Senator Packwood in which Mr. Furman states, in part, "I hope you know you can count on me for the future."<p> <p> 195.  In a letter dated April 19, 1990, four days after this diary entry, Senator Packwood wrote a brief note to Mr. Furman in which he stated, "Thanks so much for all of your help.  I won't forget it. Sunday night was delightful..."  Senator Packwood testified that he does not know what he was referring to in this letter.<p> <p> 196.  Nor does he recall ever discussing the antiques proposal with Mr. Lee in Senator Packwood's presence.<p> <p> 197.  In a letter dated June 24, 1991, Senator Packwood thanked Mr. Furman for keeping him up to date on Greenbrier's efforts in opposing "giant trucks in Oregon."  Senator Packwood testified that he and Mr. Furman were on different sides of this issue.<p> <p> 198.  In A diary entry dated October 8, 1991, Senator Packwood recorded the following: "The advantage Ron brings to me in the Washington PAC scene is that much of his income is dependent upon his relationship with me."  Senator Packwood testified that he does not know how much Mr. Crawford earns or how much of hi6 income is dependent on him.<p> <p> 199.  On September 13, 1989, Senator Packwood recorded an entry in his diary that Mr. Crawford was in to see him on behalf of Shell Oil.  He noted the following conversation:  "He [Crawford] said, 'I know how much you hate the oil companies.'  I said, '... I still hate the oil companies but I'll do you a favor."  Senator Packwood testified that "...whenever anybody comes in like this and if you're going to do something anyway, you let them think it's a big favor."<p> <p> 200.  On July 11, 1990, Senator Packwood recorded in his diary that two representatives of Abbott were into see him and noted, "But Ron wanted me to meet with them because they want to retain Ron because, as Ron says, "People hear that you're tough to get to and they know I can get to you."  I said, "Well, that's a happy relationship for all of us." Senator Packwood testified that he is delighted to see Mr. Crawford's clients because Mr. Crawford does not mislead him.<p> <p> 201. Mr. Crawford recalls two issues of interest to Northrop:  1) the sale of F-20 aircraft to Jordan and 2) funding for the B-2 bomber.  In both cases, Senator Packwood voted against the positions advocated by Northrop.<p> <p> 202.  Mr. Crawford testified that this has been an ongoing protect since 1989 or 1990 and that he has hired college students on a part-time basis to accumulate this information.  He stated that he is still accumulating this information with one part-time college student.  He testified that he does not believe he hired people to perform this job prior to the time he made the proposal to Mrs. Packwood.  He subsequently amended his testimony to state that he believes he did hire a college student to perform this job before extending the proposal to Mrs. Packwood.<p> <p> <p> </tt></font>><P><UL><UL> <a href=pack1.htm#tab><LI><I>To table of contents</I></a><br> <a href=/spotlight/index.html#tab><LI><I>Back to Spotlight</I></a></ul></ul><center>  <hr size=7><P>Released through<H3>LEXIS COUNSEL CONNECT</H3> LEXIS COUNSEL CONNECT is a communications and information service for attorneys.

<TITLE> The Shooting at Ruby Ridge</TITLE> Released through<p> COUNSEL CONNECT<p>COUNSEL CONNECT is a communications and information service for attorneys. Counsel Connect is managed by American Lawyer Media, L.P.<p><hr><P><H3>DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE REPORT ON INTERNAL REVIEW REGARDING THE RUBY RIDGE HOSTAGE SITUATION AND SHOOTINGS BY LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL</H3><p><H4> I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</H4><p><H4>  A. Overview</H4><p>In February 1993, the Office of Professional Responsibility ("OPR") of the U.S. Department of Justice (the "Department") was informed of allegations made by defense counsel for Randall ("Randy") Weaver and Kevin Harris in the criminal case of <I>United States v. Weaver</i> which was pending in the federal district court in Idaho. Defense counsel alleged that employees of several components of the Department had engaged in criminal and professional misconduct during the investigation, apprehension, and prosecution of Randy Weaver and Kevin Harris. The Department decided to defer action on thismatter until the criminal trial was completed.<p>In July 1993, a jury acquitted Weaver and Harris of charges stemming from the murder of a federal officer. Following the acquittal, numerous additional allegations wereraised by defense counsel an other sources against the Bureau ofAlcohol, Tobacco and Firearms ("BATF"), the U.S. MarshalsService ("Marshals Service") , the Federal Bureau of Investigation ("FBI" or "Bureau") and the U.S> Attorney's Office for the District of Idaho ("USAO"). Included among these allegations were claims that Department employees had unlawfully caused the deaths of Sammy and Vicki Weaver, had taken actionsthat had obstructed justice, had committed perjury and had engaged in other criminal and ethical misconduct. In late July 1993, attorneys from OPR and the Criminal Division of the Department, assisted by inspectors form the FBI, began an investigation of these allegations.<p>This report details the results of this investigation and traces chronologically the events that occurred in the Weaver matter. The early sections of the report focus on Weaver's  sale of illegal firearms to a BATF informant, BATF's unsuccessful attempt to enlist Weaver as an informant, thesubsequent governmental delay in seeking an indictment on thefirearms violations, and Weaver's arrest on weapons charges followed by his subsequent failure to appear for trial on those charges. Another area of investigative inquiry focuses on the efforts of the Marshals Service to apprehend Weaver. These efforts culminated in the August 21, 1992 gun battle at Ruby Ridge which took the lives of Deputy Marshal William Degan andWeaver's son, Sammy Weaver. Next, the report contains adiscussion of the involvement of the FBI in the Weaver matter,including its initial intervention in the crisis, its responsibility for the death of Vicki Weaver and wounding of Kevin Harris on August 22, 1992, its handling of the crisis including its attempts to end the week-long standoff, its handling of the crime scene searches and its subsequentactivities in assisting the USAO in preparing the Weaver casefor trial. Finally, the last section of the report addressesthe handling by the USAO and the investigative agencies of theprosecution of Weaver and Harris including representation madeby the U.S. Attorney to the court prior to the beginning ofHarris' preliminary hearing, the conduct of the Assistant U.S.Attorney before the grand jury and the untimely disclosure ofcritical information to the defense.<p>We found that many of the allegations of misconduct were not supported by the evidence. However, we did find merit in some of the more serious charges.  As a result, we have asked that the appropriate component of the Department examine for prosecutive merit the conduct of the FBI sniper/observer who fired the shots on August 22, 1992. In addition, because our investigation indicated that Assistant U.S. Attorney Ronald Howen took certain questionable actions during the investigation and prosecution of the Weaver case, we have recommended that the Executive Office for United States Attorneys examine our analysis of his conduct and take whatever administrative action it deems appropriate. Finally, we have formulated a series of recommendations that address the problems that we reviewed or uncovered during our investigation.<p><H4>  B. Significant Findings</H4><p> In October 1989, Randy Weaver sold illegal weapons to aBATF informant. When BATF agents later attempted to enlistWeaver as an informant in their investigation of the AryanNations, Weaver refused to cooperate. Seven months later, thegovernment indicted Weaver for the illegal weapons sales. Wehave found no evidence to support the claim that BATF targetedWeaver because of his religious or political beliefs. Similarly, we found insufficient evidence to sustain the chargethat Weaver was illegally entrapped into selling the weapons.<p>  When Weaver was arraigned on the weapons charges inJanuary 1991, he was told that his trial would commence onFebruary 19, 1991. Two weeks later, the court clerk notifiedthe parties that the trial date had been changed to February 20,1991. Shortly thereafter, the U.S. Probation Office sent Weavera letter which incorrectly referenced his trial date as March20, 1991. After Weaver failed to appear for trial on February20, the court issued a bench warrant for his arrest. Threeweeks later, on March 14, a federal grand jury indicted Weaverfor his failure to appear for trial. We found that: thegovernment, especially the USAO, was unnecessarily rigid in itsapproach to the issues created by the erroneous letter; that theUSAO improvidently sought an indictment before March 20, 1991;<p> [G.J.]<p> From February 1991 through August 1992, the Marshals Service was involved in efforts to apprehend Weaver to stand trial for the weapons charges and for his failure to appear fortrial. These efforts included gathering information about Weaver and developing a plan to arrest him. Base on informationthat it collected, the Marshals Service learned that for manyyears Weaver had made statements about his intent to violentlyconfront federal law enforcement officials. As a result, theMarshals Service concluded that Weaver intended to resistviolently governmental attempts to arrest him. Thereafter, theMarshals Service investigated and carefully consideredalternatives that would enable it to arrest Weaver withoutendangering his family or law enforcement personnel. Itconcluded that an undercover operation would be the most prudent way to proceed.<p>In August 1992, six marshals travelled to an area in northern Idaho known as Ruby Ridge to conduct surveillance of the Weaver residence in preparation for  the undercover operation. During the surveillance mission, the Weaver dog discovered the marshals and began to bark. The marshalsretreated with the dog, Harris, Randy Weaver and his son, SammyWeaver, and other family members in pursuit. At an area knownas the "Y," a gun battle occurred in which Deputy Marshal Deganand Sammy Weaver were killed.<p> We conclude that the marshals took a measured approach indeveloping a plan to apprehend Weaver. Throughout the 18 monthperiod that the marshals were responsible for apprehendingWeaver, they carefully devised a plan intended to pose the leastamount of risk to Weaver, his family, and the marshals. At notime did we find that it was the intent of the marshals to forcea confrontation with Weaver or his family. Although some mayquestion the expenditures of manpower and resources by theMarshals Service during this 18 month period, we believe thatinstitutional pressure created by the existence of a benchwarrant and an indictment, left the Marshals Service with littlechoice but to proceed as it did. Moreover, the USAO did littleto assist the Marshals Service in this matter. Indeed, duringthe first part of this process the USAO thwarted the efforts ofthe Director of the Marshals Service to focus the court on thedanger involved in making the arrest and incorrectly terminatedefforts by the Marshals Service to negotiate with Weaver throughintermediaries.<p> With regard to the responsibility for the deaths that occurred at the Y, the marshals assert that Harris initiated the fire fight when he shot Deputy Marsha Degan while Weaver and Harris claim that the marshals fired the first shots. After a thorough review of all of the evidence made available to us, wehave been unable to determine conclusively who fired the firstshot during the exchange of gunfire. Although there is evidencethat one of the marshals shot Sammy Weaver during the exchangeof gunfire, we found no proof that the shooting of the boy wasanything other than an accident. In fact, the evidence indicates that the marshals did not know that Sammy Weaver had been killed or wounded until his body was discovered by the FBI in a shed outside the Weaver cabin two days later. Nor did wediscover any evidence indicating that the marshals attempted to cover up their roles in the incident or that they exaggeratedthe events to cause a more drastic FBI response than was appropriate.<p>Soon after learning of the August 21 incident at Ruby Ridge, the FBI officials in Washington, D.C. evaluated the information made available to them and decided to deploy its Hostage Rescue Team ("HRT") to Idaho to deal with the crisis. HRT members assumed their position around the Weaver compound late in the afternoon of August 22, 1992 but before doing so they were instructed that their conduct was to be governed byspecially formulated Rules of Engagement ("Rules"). These Rulesinstructed the HRT snipers that before a surrender announcementwas made they could and should shoot all armed adult malesappearing outside the cabin. Operating under these Rules onAugust 22, an FBI sniper/observer fired two shots in quicksuccession. The first shot was at an armed adult male whom hebelieved was bout to fire at a HRT helicopter on an observationmission. The first shot wounded Randy Weaver while in front ofa building at the Weaver compound known as the birthing shed. The second shot was fired at Harris while Harris was retreatinginto the Weaver cabin. The second shot seriously wounded Harrisand killed Vicki Weaver who was behind the cabin door.<p> Following this shooting incident FBI officials spent thenext eight days attempting to convince Weaver and Harris tosurrender to federal authorities. Finally, due largely to theefforts of nongovernmental negotiators, Harris and Weaversurrendered on August 30 and August 31 respectively. Thereafter, the FBI completed its searches of the cabin andsurrounding areas. During the following month, the FBI alsoconducted an internal review of the shooting incident todetermine if the sniper had responded appropriately.<p> Our review found numerous problems with the conduct ofthe FBI at Ruby Ridge. Although we concluded that the decisionto deploy the HRT to Ruby Ridge was appropriate and consistentwith Department policy, we do not believe that the FBI's initialattempts at intelligence gathering at the scene weresufficiently thorough. We also found serious problems with theterms of the Rules of Engagement in force at Ruby Ridge. Certain portions of these Rules not only departed from the FBI'sstandard deadly force policy but also contravened theConstitution of the United States. In addition, we found theseRules to be imprecise and believe that they may have created anatmosphere that encouraged the use of deadly force therebyhaving the effect of contributing to an unintentional death.<p>  With regard to the two shots fired on August 22, weconcluded that the first shot met the standard of "objectivereasonableness" the Constitution requires for the legal use ofdeadly force but that the second shot did not satisfy thatstandard. It is our conclusion that the sniper/observer whotook the second shot intended to shoot Kevin Harris butaccidentally killed Vicki Weaver whom he did not see behind thecurtained door. We also found the internal FBI review of theshooting incident has not been sufficiently thorough and reachedincorrect conclusions about the second shot.<p> Our examination of the command and control of the crisisby the FBI, found numerous shortcomings. These shortcomingsincluded initial inadequacies in utilizing negotiating personnel, communicating with FBI Headquarters, documenting decisions and securing the site.<p> During and after the crisis, the crime scenes were searched by many law enforcement officials under the direct supervision of the FBI. We found the FBI's handling of the crime scene searches to be inadequate including its failure to use basic crime scene techniques in collecting evidence. Furthermore, the general disorganization and inexperience ofsome of the participants coupled with inaccuracies in thesearches adversely affected the prosecution and contributed tothe negative impression of the government generated during thetrial. We found no evidence that these deficiencies wereintentional or that the FBI staged evidence for theprosecution's benefit.<p> Shortly after their arrest, separate preliminary hearingswere held for Weaver and Harris. While arguing the government'smotion requesting a continuance of the Harris preliminaryhearing, U.S. Attorney Ellsworth made statements indicating thatthe government would allow Harris to have a complete preliminaryhearing in return or consenting to the continuance. Thereafter,Harris consented to the continuance with the understanding thathe would have a full preliminary hearing. An indictment wasreturned against Harris while his preliminary hearing was inprogress. We have found that the U.S. Attorney did notintentionally misrepresent the government's position but that hefailed to appreciate the impact of his statements and that heneglected to pay sufficient attention to the information thatthe received concerning the probably length of the preliminaryhearing.<p>After the first indictments were returned against Weaverand Harris, the Assistant U.S. Attorney continued to presentevidence to the grand jury which led to the return of twosuperseding indictments, each containing a conspiracy count. Wefound these conspiracy counts to be overly broad and to containsome overt acts for which there was insufficient evidence.<p>[G.J.]<p> Later the USAO decided to seek the death penalty against Weaver and Harris even though the applicable federal appellate court had held that the offense charged could notconstitutionally support the imposition of a death sentence. Wehave concluded that the decision to seek the death penalty,although made in good faith, gave the appearance that thegovernment was overreaching.<p>From the moment that the USAO began to prepare the casefor trial, it met with resistance from the FBI. This resistancetook many forms, all of which served to make preparation of thecase more difficult. The FBI continuously opposed actions ofthe prosecutors requested to prepare the case for trial, rangingfrom having the case agents conduct out-of state interviews toenlisting agents from other agencies to help prepare the case. The FBI, which wanted to be the only agency or, at a minimum,the lead agency on the case, resisted working as a coequalmember of the prosecution team. Furthermore, when the USAOsought advice and assistance from the FBI Laboratory they metwith unjustified delays and resistance that created discordwithin the team and disrupted trial preparation. These problemscontributed to the USAO's decision to retain private forensicexperts.<p>In addition, the FBI unjustifiably delayed producingmaterials to the USAO that were needed for trial preparation andthat were clearly discoverable under federal law and thediscovery stipulation signed by the parties. This actionunreasonably delayed the availability of these materials fortrial preparation and for discovery. Particularly at theheadquarters level, we found that the FBI's efforts to locateand produce discoverable documents to be disorganized andincomplete. The late production during trial of materialsassociated with the FBI Shooting Incident Report negativelyaffected the court's and the jury's perception of the governmentand the government's case. In addition, the delays in discoverycaused by the disorganization of and mistakes committed by theFBI Laboratory contributed to the delay of the trial and to theperception that the government was uncooperative and not beingtotally forthcoming.<p>However, the FBI was not alone in failing to make timely disclosure of critical information to the defense. The USAO was also responsible for not promptly revealing certain important information to the defense. Although in some instances we found these tardy disclosures to be unjustified or negligent, we do not believe that they were improperly motivated or takenintentionally to obstruct the Weaver trial.<p> <H4> C. Significant Recommendations</H4><p>As the result of our investigation, we have made sevenbroad recommendations. First, we recommend that all federal lawenforcement officers be governed by a standard deadly forcepolicy and that the Department of Justice be responsible fordeveloping such a policy. in addition to specifying clearly thecircumstances in which deadly force may be used, the policyshould define the occasions in which special Rules of Engagementmay be implemented and the process by which such rules should be approved.<p>Second, we recommend that a crisis response team, including specially trained crisis managers, be available torespond to crises. In addition, we endorse the proposal toinclude specially trained prosecutors to provide legal supportto tactical teams when needed. We also propose periodic jointtraining exercises by the various federal and local lawenforcement agencies which are responsible for responding tocrisis situation.<p>Third, we recommend that a panel comprised of representatives from federal law enforcement agencies, including an attorney form the Department of Justice, be created to examine the internal reviews that law enforcement agencies conduct after shooting incidents occur. This examination wouldfocus on the thoroughness and prosecutive merit of the internalreview.<p>Fourth, we recommend that FBI field offices that do not have a team in place to recover evidence after majorhostage/barricade crises like Ruby Ridge request the assistanceof the Evidence Response Team at FBI Headquarters. We furtherrecommend that procedures be adopted to improve the coordinationbetween the FBI Laboratory and the federal prosecutors and that and examination be done of the FBI procedures regarding the memorializing of interviews.<p>Sixth, we recommend that all U.S. Attorneys' Officesinstitute a review process for indictments, at least forsignificant cases.<p> Finally, we recommend that our findings concerning theevents surrounding the shooting of Vicki Weaver on August 22,1992 be referred to the appropriate component of the Departmentof Justice to assess prosecutive merit. In addition, werecommend that our analysis of the conduct of Assistant U.S.Attorney Ronald Howen be referred to the Executive Office forUnited States Attorneys for whatever administrative action itdeems appropriate.<p><hr><P>Released through<p>COUNSEL CONNECT<p>COUNSEL CONNECT is a communications and information servicefor attorneys.

<TITLE>The Shooting at Ruby Ridge</TITLE>Released through<p>   COUNSEL CONNECT<p>COUNSEL CONNECT is a communications and information service for attorneys. Counsel Connect is managed by American Lawyer Media, L.P.<p><hr><P> <H3>II. ORIGINS OF THE INVESTIGATION AND METHODOLOGY EMPLOYED</H3><p>  In February 1993, the Criminal Division of the UnitedStates Department of Justice (the "Department") informed theOffice of Professional Responsibility ("OPR") of allegations ofprofessional misconduct and criminal wrongdoing by agents of theU.S. Marshals Service ("Marshals Service"), the Federal Bureauof Investigations ("FBI"), the United States Attorney's Officefor the District of Idaho ("USAO"), and the Bureau of Alcohol,Tobacco and Firearms ("BATF"), stemming from their involvementin the investigation, apprehension, and prosecution of RandyWeaver and Kevin Harris. Because Weaver and Harris wereawaiting trial, OPR in conformity with its normal policy ofavoiding interfering with the criminal process, postponed itsinquiry until the litigation had concluded.<p>  Following the jury verdict in July 1993, OPR began itsinquiry. OPR was aware of numerous allegations of impropriety,some of which had been raised in defense pleadings and manyothers that arose during and immediately after trial. Allegations by various people and groups -- the media, the trialcourt, the United States Attorney's Office, the FBI, and U.S.Senator Larry Craig of Idaho, as well as the public -- suggestedthe personnel of the United States government had engaged inwillful misconduct, including obstruction of justice, perjury ,and other criminal and ethical violations. As a result, itbecame apparent that the scope of inquiry needed to be broaderthan merely issues that had been raised at trial by the defense.<p> Attorney General Janet Reno announced that the inquirywould include a complete and thorough review of the Weaver casefrom its inception to the conclusion of the criminal trial. OPRwas to conduct this inquiry with investigative support from theFBI.<p>  On July 26, 1993, Michael E. Shaheen, Jr., Counsel in theOffice of Professional Responsibility detailed the role of OPRand the FBI in the inquiry in a letter to David G. Binney,Assistant Director of the FBI's Inspection Division. Concernshad been raised about the FBI's ability to be objective and toinvestigate alleged misconduct by its own agents. Some who hadparticipated in the Weaver investigation and prosecution and hadexperienced a decided lack of harmony in their workingrelationship with the FBI, opposed the Bureau's involvement inthe investigation. However, OPR's experience with the FBI ininvestigations in which the FBI was the subject -- including aninvestigation of its own Director -- demonstrated that theBureau could be objective under OPR's supervision. Furthermore,the broad scope of the Weaver inquiry and the need for FBIexpertise suggested that the Bureau be included in the inquiry.<p>  From the beginning of the investigation OPR attorneysestablished that they would control the investigation, analyze the information gathered, and make finding and recommendations. The FBI's role was limited to assisting in gathering facts andconducting interviews. The FBI was not to make findings,conclusions, or recommendations.<p>  Due to the expansive scope of the inquiry, former DeputyAttorney General Philip Heymann assigned four attorneys from theCriminal Division of the Department of Justice to assist OPR. It was decided that the review would cover: the conduct of theMarshals Service in its investigation of Randy Weaver from itsinception to the conclusion of the trial; the actions of the FBIHostage Rescue Team ("HRT") during the siege of the Weaverresidence; the handling of evidence by the FBI Laboratory andits effect on the Weaver trial; and the conduct of the U.S.Attorney's Office in investigating and prosecuting the Weavercase.<p>OPR contacted the Department of Treasury ("DOT"), whichhad also received complaints about BATF's conduct and agreedthat its Inspector General's Office would investigate thatmatter. However, it was understood that OPR would address thoseelements of the BATF investigation that affected the Weaver caseand involved Department of Justice employees. To that end, OPRinvited DOT to participate in interviews relevant to itsinvestigation and to review material -- other than grand jurytestimony -- that would assist its inquiry. Although DOT ispreparing a report of its investigation, this report discussesissues involving BATF that affected the Weaver matter.<p>  The FBI initially assigned 15 Inspectors and twoadministrative support personnel to the Ruby Ridge InspectionTeam to work with the five DOJ attorneys. During the firstphase of the inquiry, the team developed an investigative focus,established a management system, and attempted to identify,through research and selected interviews, the issues to beaddressed. By August 1993, the team had determined thebackground interviews that needed to be conducted and hadidentified documents that needed to be reviewed, including casefiles and supporting materials form the Marshals Service, theUSAO, and the FBI.<p>  Initially, the investigators used a research systemconsistent with a typical FBI investigation. However, they soonrealized that a thorough review of the Weaver matter wouldbenefit from the support of the FBI's Rapid Start team of theInformation Resources Division of FBI Headquarters. Rapid Startis a mobile group of FBI employees who provide informationmanagement services to major cases. The Rapid Start teamdeveloped an automated case management system to assist theinvestigators in capturing, storing and retrieving information. The team also assisted the investigation in tracking leads andwith document control.<p>  As Phase I of the investigation entered its final stages,it became apparent that the volume of material to be reviewedand the broad scope of the inquiry would require more personneland time than had originally been contemplated. A decision wasmade to increase the size of the investigative team. Thus, whenPhase II of the investigation began on September 21, 1993, theRuby Ridge Inspection Team was doubled in size to include twofull-time Inspectors, 26 Assistant Inspectors, and 10 supportpersonnel.<p>  Phase II was the investigative phase of the project. Theinspectors were divided into the four teams. The first team wasresponsible for issues involving BATF and the Marshals Service. The second and third teams focused on the FBI role in the caseincluding the FBI Laboratory, the FBI's handling of the crimescene, and the actions of the FBI HRT and its Rules ofEngagement. The last team examined the actions of the USAOthroughout its involvement in the Weaver matter. Each team wascomprised of a DOJ Attorney, an inspection team leader, and fiveor six inspectors. The inspectors were encouraged to coordinatetheir inquiry with the DOJ attorney. Many interviews involvedwitnesses who had knowledge of issues being investigated by morethan one team. In those instances, inspectors from the otherteams either attended the interview, scheduled separateinterviews, or submitted preliminary questions to determinewhether an additional interview was necessary.<p>  The FBI inspectors and DOJ attorneys conducted over 370interviews of persons involved in the Ruby Ridge incident,including personnel of local, state, and federal law enforcementagencies, the USAO, the Department of Justice, as well as membersof the federal judiciary and nongovernmental witnesses.[FN1]The interviews were conducted throughout the United States and,in some instances, supplemental interviews were conducted forclarification. Although the majority of the interviews wereconducted by FBI inspectors, virtually all significantinterviews were conducted jointly by FBI inspectors and DOJattorneys. In addition, thousands of pages of records and fileswere reviewed.<p>  Before the interview process began, DOJ and FBI personneldeveloped a witness notification form describing the scope andpurpose of the inquiry. Each witness executed this form beforebeing interviewed. In addition, witnesses were asked to executewaiver forms before statements were taken. In some instances,interviewees were represented by counsel or declined tovolunteer information, instead relying on earlier sworntestimony or statements.<p>  On November 8, 1993, then Deputy Attorney General PhilipHeymann responded to renewed objections to the investigativerole of the FBI in the inquiry. Heymann received the assuranceof the attorneys in charge of the inquiry that they couldaccommodate interviewees who requested interviews outside thepresence of the FBI. The attorneys assured these intervieweesthat the FBI was assisting them in gathering facts but thatthe final report and its conclusion and recommendations wouldoriginate from the DOJ attorneys. However, these intervieweeswere advised that a record of their interviews would be given tothe FBI to assist its inquiry. In addition, we cautioned allthose interviewed that the Attorney General might release aversion of our final report to the public and, therefore, wecould not assure their confidentiality.<p>  On January 19, 1994, the FBI investigators submittedtheir report of factual finding to the DOJ attorneys. Followingthe receipt of the FBI report, the DOJ attorneys completed theirreview of all pertinent materials and wrote a report analyzingthe many allegations. The original team of lawyers was assistedby two attorneys from the Criminal Division who providedadditional research and analysis. In addition, another OPRattorney assisted in the final stages of the preparation of this report.<p>This report was structured to be read in its entirety orin isolated sections. The Factual Summary, Chronology, and theIdentification of Participants sections are intended to providea general overview of significant events, which will assist thereader in understanding the detailed discussions that follow. Specific topics are generally arranged in chronological orderand contain detailed discussions of the relevant facts, theissues raised and the finding made. Finally, we conclude with asection which sets forth recommendations, most of which aredesigned to anticipate and avoid the kinds of problems subjectto this inquiry.

<TITLE>The Shooting at Ruby Ridge</TITLE>Released through<p>
 COUNSEL CONNECT<p>
COUNSEL CONNECT is a communications and information service

 <H3>III. FACTUAL SUMMARY<p>
  A. THE U.S. MARSHALS SERVICE</H3><p>
  In January 1985, the U.S. Secret Service investigated
allegations that Randy Weaver had made threats against the
President and other government and law enforcement officials. 
The Secret Service was told that Weaver was associated with the
Aryan Nations, a white supremacist group, and that he had a
large cache of weapons and ammunition. Weaver had spoken of the
world's ending in two years "when [his] home will be under siege
and assaulted." Secret Service agents interviewed Weaver, who
denied the allegations. No charges were filed.<p>
  In February 1985, Weaver and his wife, Vicki, filed an
affidavit with the county clerk, giving "legal and official
notice that [he] believe[d] [he] may have to defend [him]self
and [his] family from physical attack on [his] life" by the FBI.<p>
  Weaver came to the attention of the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms ("BATF") in July 1986, when a BATF
informant was introduced to him at a World Aryan Congress. The
informant met Weaver several times over the next three years. 
In July 1989, Weaver invited the informant to his home to
discuss forming a group to fight the "Zionist Organized
Government," referring to the U.S. Government. Three months
later, Weaver sold the informant two "sawed-off" shotguns.<p>
  In June 1990, BATF agents approached Weaver to persuade
him to become an informant. Weaver refused to become a
"snitch," and he was indicted for manufacturing and possessing
an unregistered firearm. A warrant was issued for his arrest. 
BATF concluded that it would be too dangerous for the arresting
agents and the Weaver children to arrest Weaver at his
mountaintop residence. Instead, in January 1991, BATF agents,
posing as stranded motorists, surprised Weaver and his wife when
they stopped to offer assistance. Weaver told the arresting
agents "nice trick; you'll never do that again."<p>
  Weaver was arraigned and was released on a personal recognizance bond. A trial date
was set for February 19, 1991.Shortly thereafter, Weaver's wife, Vicki, sent the U.S.
Attorney's Office two letters addressed to the servants of the
Queen of Babylon, which asserted that "[t]he tyrants blood will
flow" and "[w]hether we live or whether we die, we will not bow
to your evil commandments."<p>
  A U.S. Probation Officer sent Weaver a letter incorrectly referring to a March 20
trial date. Weaver did not appear for the February trial, and a bench warrant was issued
for his arrest. On March 14, 1991, Weaver was indicted for
failure to appear for trial.<p>
  The matter was referred to the U.S. Marshals Service,
which learned that Weaver had attended Aryan World Congresses
and that he and his family were constantly armed. Weaver sent a
letter to the local sheriff, stating the he would not leave his
cabin and that law enforcement officers would have to take him
out. The Weavers "felt as though the end [was] near." Weaver
was quoted as threatening to shoot law enforcement officers, who
came to arrest him. Weaver and his family remained in a cabin,
atop an isolated mountain.<p>
Between March 1991 and August 1992, the marshals
undertook a series of efforts to convince Weaver to surrender. 
They also made plans to arrest Weaver without harm to law
enforcement officers or the Weaver family, particularly the
children. The marshals exchanged messages with Weaver through
intermediaries, until the U.S. Attorney directed that all communications go through
Weaver's appointed counsel (with whom Weaver would not speak).<p>
  Teams from the Marshals Service Special Operations Group
("SOG") conducted surveillance of the Weavers' mountaintop
property to devise methods to take Weaver into custody safely. 
Surveillance cameras were installed and aerial photographs were
taken of the property. The marshals observed that Weaver and
his children responded to approaching persons and vehicles by
taking armed positions over the driveway leading to the Weaver
cabin. During this period, Weaver continued to make statements
that he would not surrender peacefully and that his family was
prepared to defend him.<p>
  The Director of the Marshals Service ordered that no action be taken that could
endanger the Weaver children. In the Spring of 1992, the marshals developed an
undercover plan to arrest Weaver away from his cabin and family.<p>
  A surveillance team of six marshals went to the mountains on August 21, 1992 to look
for places to station cover teams for the operation. Toward the end of the surveillance
mission, one of the Weaver's dogs began to chase three of the marshals. 
Marshals stationed at an observation post saw Kevin Harris, an
associate of Randy Weaver, Weaver, his thirteen year old son
Sammy, and Weaver's daughters, follow the dog. All were
carrying firearms.<p>
  The marshals retreated. As they approached an intersection of trails known as the "Y,"
they saw Randy Weaver coming down the trail. They identified themselves and told him to
halt, but he turned and ran back up the trail. The dog
caught up with Deputy Marshal Cooper. He held the dog at bay
with his firearm, but did not shoot for fear of provoking the
Weavers. An exchange of gunfire occurred moments later,
resulting in the death of Deputy Marshal William Degan, Sammy
Weaver, and the dog.<p>
  According to the marshals, the fire fight began when Degan and Deputy Marshal Cooper
rose to identify themselves. Kevin Harris wheeled and fired at Degan with a 30.06 rifle. 
Cooper returned fire and thought he hit Harris, though he had
not. Cooper turned his weapon toward Sammy Weaver, but did not
fire.<p>
  Deputy Marshal Roderick, who was further down the path, heard a shot from his left.
Roderick could not see anyone other
than Weaver's dog, which was heading in the direction Randy
Weaver had gone. When the first shot was fired, the dog turned
its head toward the marshals. Roderick feared that the dog
would turn and attack him or lead Weaver, Harris, and the others
to the marshals. Roderick fired at the dog, killing him.<p>
  Sammy Weaver then shot at Roderick, and Roderick dove
into the woods. Roderick later found a bullet hole through his
shirt, though he was not wounded. Cooper heard the shots to his
right. He rose and fired a three-round burst to provide cover
fire for himself so that he could get to Degan, who called for
help. Following the last shots, Cooper saw Sammy Weaver run out
of view up the trail to the Weaver cabin. He did not think that
he had hit the boy.<p>
  Randy Weaver and Kevin Harris claimed that they did not
know what the dog was chasing, though there is evidence to the
contrary. They said that they thought they were pursuing a
large animal. They asserted that the first shot fired at the Y
was Roderick's attack on the dog, that Sammy fired at Roderick
in retaliation, and that Degan and Cooper then shot at Sammy. 
Harris maintained that the marshals did not identify themselves
until the shooting had ended and that he shot Degan to defend
Sammy.<p>
  Soon after the shooting, the three marshals, who had been at the observation post, ran
to the Y. They came under fire
along the way. One marshal, a medic, treated Degan, without
success. Shortly thereafter, the marshals heard a barrage of
gunfire, followed by screaming and crying. After a brief time,
two marshals left the hill to seek help. The three surviving
marshals maintained their positions out of fear that, if they
moved, they would be shot at. They also refused to leave
without the body of the slain marshal. They did not receive
additional fire, though in the hours that followed they heard
shots when an airplane flew overhead.<p>
  B. Federal Bureau of Investigation - Deployment of Hostage Rescue Team<p>
  As soon as the U.S. Marshals Service received word of Marshal Degan's death and the
ongoing situation at Ruby Ridge, they sought and received FBI assistance. The FBI had
primary jurisdiction for assaults on federal officers, and its Hostage Rescue Team
("HRT") is seen as uniquely skilled for crises. FBI and Marshals Service Headquarters
immediately activated command centers to coordinate communications. Special Agent Eugene
Glenn was assigned the command and began to arrange for the
personnel and equipment required for the crisis. Concurrently,
state and local law enforcement and a few FBI agents who were in
the immediate area came to the scene and began securing the area.<p>
  The rescue of the marshals was delayed until after dark. 
A team led by the Idaho State Police reached the marshals at
approximately 11:30 p.m., more than twelve hours after the
shooting. The rescue effort was ongoing when Glenn arrived and
deployed FBI SWAT teams to secure the command post's perimeter. 
He planned to maintain the status quo until the HRT had arrived. 
Local law enforcement continued to guard the access road as a
crowd of sympathizers and onlookers gathered.<p>
  The marshals were successfully removed from the mountain without additional gun fire.
Once rescued, they were examined at a hospital and transported to a command post where
they were
given food and allowed to rest. FBI agents interviewed the
marshals, starting the following afternoon.<p>
   C. Rules of Engagement and the Death of
Vicki Weaver on August 22<p>
  While the rescue of the marshals was underway, the HRT advance team was en route to
Idaho with the Associate Director of the Marshals Service, who briefed then about
Weaver's background, his failure to appear for trial, the underlying weapons charge, and
his professed desire to confront the federal government. During the flight, HRT
Commander Rogers and FBI
Associate Director Potts drafted special Rules of Engagement to
address the danger they perceived. When the HRT arrived in
Idaho, Rogers briefed them on the situation and the proposed
Rules of Engagement. They established a command site, flew
reconnaissance missions, and began to make plans to address the
crisis.<p>
  On the afternoon of the shooting, the U.S. Attorney's
Office obtained a search warrant and complaints for Randy Weaver
and Kevin Harris's arrest on charges relating the the death of
Marshal Degan. Assistant U.S. Attorney Ronald Howen, who was
assigned to the case, went to the site. Howen remained until
Weaver and Harris surrendered a week later. Howen took no role
in developing the Rules of Engagement or drafting operations
plans, but he did participate in crime scene searches,
interviews, and negotiations. The Boundary County prosecutor
was also present during most of the crisis but was not involved
in the operations planning.<p>
  According to the HRT plan, communication with the
occupants of the Weaver cabin, including a surrender demand, was
to take place using armored personnel carriers, which would
deliver a telephone to the cabin site. The HRT was concerned
that the Weavers or sympathizers might be hiding in the woods
and planning an ambush. Therefore, teams of HRT
sniper/observers were stationed overlooking the cabin before the
carrier drove up the hill. Although FBI headquarters had not
approved a tactical operations plan, permission was granted to
begin negotiations with the Weavers when HRT agents arrived at
their positions.<p>
  At 3:30 p.m. on August 22, HRT sniper/observers, along
with members of the Marshals Service SOG, began their ascent to
the cabin. Before their departure, they were briefed on the
Rules of Engagement, which provided that:<p>
 1. If any adult male is observed with a weapon prior to
the announcement, deadly force can and should be employed, if
the shot can be taken without endangering any children.<p>
 2. If any adult in the compound is observed with a weapon
after the surrender announcement is made, and is not attempting
to surrender, deadly force can and should be employed to
neutralize the individual.<p>
 3. If compromised by any animal, particularly the dogs,
that animal should be eliminated.<p>
 4. Any subjects other than Randall Weaver, Vicki Weaver,
Kevin Harris, presenting threats of death or grievous bodily
harm, the FBI rules of deadly force are in effect. Deadly force
can be utilized to prevent the death or grievous bodily injury
to oneself or that of another.<p>
  No shots had been fired since the previous day, but,
while the HRT members were moving to positions overlooking the
cabin, other observers reported to FBI headquarters that the
subjects were outside the cabin. FBI Headquarters reminded the
field commander that the Rules of Engagement would apply. By
5:45 p.m., the sniper/observers reached their positions. The
engines of the personnel carriers at the command post below were
audible. An unarmed, young female ran from the cabin to a rocky
outcropping and returned to the cabin. Within a minute, an
unarmed male was seen on the cabin's back deck. About ten
minutes later, a helicopter carrying HRT personnel began an
observation mission. When the helicopter's engine was started,
the female seen earlier and two males ran from the cabin to the
outcropping. The last person to emerge was carrying a rifle. 
Sniper/observer Horiuchi identified him as Kevin Harris.<p>
  A few seconds later Horiuchi saw a person he believed to
be Harris near an outbuilding known as the "birthing shed." The
man appeared to be scanning above and behind the snipers for the
helicopter. Horiuchi believed that he was trying to position
himself to shoot at the helicopter from the more protected side
of the shed. Horiuchi fired one shot as the man suddenly moved
along the side of the shed out of sight. When Horiuchi fired,
the man's back was toward Horiuchi and the helicopter. Because
the man moved unexpectedly, Horiuchi assumed he missed. The man he aimed at was not
Harris, but Weaver, who was slightly
wounded.<p>
  Harris and Weaver have maintained that they had no aggressive purpose in leaving the
cabin and that Weaver was
opening the door to the shed to look at the body of his son.<p>
  After ten or twenty seconds Horiuchi saw the target of
his first shot following the other two people as they ran to the
cabin. The first two entered the cabin through an open door. 
Horiuchi fired, aiming slightly in front of the last running
man. The bullet went through the curtained window of the open
door, fatally wounding Vicki Weaver and seriously injuring Kevin
Harris. The sniper testified that he did not know that Vicki
Weaver was standing behind the door.<p>
  When Commander Rogers, who had been aboard the HRT helicopter, learned of the
shootings, he and an FBI negotiator went in a personnel carrier to the cabin to make a
surrenderannouncement and to begin negotiations by leaving a telephone. There was no
response. A few hours later, due to deterioratingweather conditions, the snipers left
their positions and returned to the command post where Rogers debriefed them. The
next morning the snipers returned to their positions. Rogers
once again went to the cabin area and issued repeated surrender
announcements, which included warnings that the outbuildings
would be removed if Weaver failed to comply.<p>
  By Sunday evening, there was still no response or
indication that the Weavers were going to surrender or
negotiate, so the first outbuilding, the birthing shed, was
moved. Sammy Weaver's body was discovered in the birthing shed.<p>
  Negotiation efforts continued for days, but were
unsuccessful. No one from the cabin picked up the telephone,
which was on an armed robot outside the cabin. Although the
weapon on the robot was not loaded, Weaver reported that he was
afraid that anyone who went outside would be shot. Attempts to
intercept conversations inside the cabin were not successful. 
By Wednesday, no aggressive action had occurred for days, and
the events which had preceded the confrontation began to seemless clear. The FBI command
received evidence in apparent
conflict with the initial impressions about Weaver's background
and the circumstances surrounding the shootout. As a result,
the FBI command decided to withdraw the special Rules of
Engagement and to instate the FBI's standard Deadly Force
Policy.<p>
  On Wednesday, August 26, Weaver told a negotiator that he
wanted to talk with his sister. When she arrived, attempts to
communicate with Weaver were frustrated by her inability to hear
Weaver. On Friday evening, August 28, Weaver agreed to speak
with Bo Gritz, whom Weaver told that the sniper had killed his
wife and injured Harris and himself. Two other private citizens
assisted Gritz in resolving the standoff. Gritz and a Weaver
family friend carried Vicki Weaver's body out of the cabin. On
Sunday, August 30, Kevin Harris surrendered. The Weavers
surrendered the following day.<p>
  Searches of the Y were ongoing during the crisis. After
the surrender, the cabin and surrounding area were searched. 
The FBI also sent a team of inspectors to begin an internal
inquiry into the sniper shootings.<p>
  D. The Prosecution<p>
  After their surrender, Harris and Weaver were placed
under arrest and charged with the murder of Deputy Marshal
Deagan. Separate preliminary hearings to determine probable
cause for these charges were begun. Before their preliminary
hearings concluded, a grand jury indicted Harris for assaulting
and murdering Degan and indicted Weaver for aiding and abetting
in Degan's death. Thereafter, the magistrate judges terminated 
the preliminary hearings of Weaver and Harris. Both defendants
pleaded not guilty to all charges. On October 1, 1992, a grand
jury returned a superseding indictment charging Weaver and
Harris with numerous offenses including conspiracy.[FN2] On 
November 19, 1992 a Second Superseding Indictment was returned 
charging Weaver and Harris with the same offenses as the 
previous indictment and alleging additional overt acts.<p>
  In October 1992 the Marshals Service and BATF provided
four agents to assist the U.S. Attorney's Office in preparing
the case for trial. During the case preparation process
continuous issues arose regarding the cooperation of the FBI in
preparing the case for trial. Included among these problem
areas was the lack of cooperation by the FBI in providing
discovery materials to the prosecution and the defense.<p>
  On January 8, 1993, on motion by the defense, the
February 2 trial date was extended to allow time for the defense
to review evidence and the results of FBI Laboratory tests. The
defense complained about the government's failure to provide
timely access to evidence and documents, and the trial judge
admonished the prosecutors to have the laboratory examination
completed quickly.<p>
  The 42 day jury trial began on April 13, 1993. During
the trial, the defendants brought to the court's attention
problems they had in obtaining documents and information to
which they believed they were entitled under either federal law
or a discovery stipulation with the government. The most
extreme breach of the stipulation involved the late production
of the underlying materials and notes related to the FBI
Shooting Incident Report which had been produced as the result
of an internal inquiry into the sniper shootings. Although the
defendants had received the final Shooting Incident Report
before trial, during trial the FBI, in response to a defense
subpoena, sent by fourth class mail materials that were not part
of the documents that the FBI had produced earlier in discovery. 
These materials included a drawing Horiuchi made days after the
shooting. The drawing arrived in Idaho after Horiuchi had
completed his testimony, thus requiring his return for
additional testimony. The court fined the government for the
attorneys fees incurred by the defendants for the lost trial
day.<p>
  One of the two prosecutors became ill and did not
participate in the final arguments. After deliberation for 20
days, on July 8, 1993, the jury acquitted Weaver and Harris of
the murder of Deputy Marshal Degan, the conspiracy charge, and
the significant remaining charges. Weaver was convicted on
charges of failure to appear for trial and committing an offense
while on release. On October 26, 1993, Weaver was sentenced to
18 months incarceration, three years probation and a $10,000
fine. The court issued an Order fining the FBI and criticizing
it for its failure to produce discovery materials, its failure
to obey orders and admonitions of the court, and its
indifference to the rights of the defendant and to the
administration of justice.<p>
  On December 18, 1993, Randy Weaver was released from
incarceration.<p>

<TITLE>The Shooting at Ruby Ridge</TITLE>Released through<p> COUNSEL CONNECT<p>
COUNSEL CONNECT is a communications and information service 
for attorneys. Counsel Connect is managed by American Lawyer Media, L.P.<p><hr><p>
<H3>IV. SPECIFIC ISSUES INVESTIGATED</H3><p>
<H3>N.   Alleged Problems With the Participation of the FBI in 
Case Preparation and Its Relationship With Other
Members of the Trial Preparation Team</H3><p> <H3>1.   Introduction</H3><p>
     One of the issues that arose as the various law enforcement
entities converges at Ruby Ridge was which agency had the primary
responsibility for planning, organizing and coordinating the
activities of law enforcement personnel.  It was decided early in
the crisis that the FBI would have the lead role in the operations
at Ruby Ridge.  However, after Weaver and Harris surrendered, the
focus shifted from crisis resolution to trials preparation and the
U.S. Attorney's Office in Boise ("USAO") assumed the lead role. 
Initially, the FBI believed that it was to be the sole agency
assisting the USAO in trial preparation.  Later, for reasons that
the USAO and the FBI dispute, agents from the U.S. Marshals Service
and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms ("BATF") were
assigned by their respective agencies to assist the USAO.<p>
     The FBI believed that the addition of these agents was
unnecessary, improper and was accomplished in a less than
forthright manner by the USAO.  The arrival of the marshals and the
BATF agents coupled with disagreements over how witness interviews
in Iowa were to be conducted worsened the already fragile working
relationship between the FBI and the USAO.  Thereafter, various
actions and attitudes of the investigative team created significant
discord between the FBI and the other team members.  In addition,
the USAO alleges that their efforts to prepare their case for trial
were also hampered by the failure of officials at FBI Headquarters
to make themselves available for interviews.<p>
          <H3>2.   Statement of Facts</H3><p>
<H4>a.   Defining the Structure of the Trial Team and
the Role and Responsibilities of the Individual
Members</H4><p>
(1)  The Lead Agency Concept and the Initial
Disagreement Regarding the Interviewing of
Witnesses in Iowa<p>
     As the various law enforcement agencies arrived at Ruby Ridge
on August 21 and August 22, 1992, it quickly became evident that
there was a need for one agency to assume the leadership role
during the crisis.  Because the assault of a federal officer charge
fell within the jurisdiction of the FBI, it was decided that it was
appropriate for the FBI to perform this role.  Once the crisis was
over, and the focus had shifted to trial preparation, Assistant
U.S. Attorney Howen believed that the leadership 
role was transferred from the FBI to the USAO. [FN1393] 
Although Howen and Assistant U.S. Attorney Lindquist would
entertain suggestions from the FBI, they viewed themselves as the
"captains' responsible for directing case preparation and any
additional investigative activities that were necessary. [FN1394]<p>
     From the outset, tensions existed between the FBI and the
USAO.  A number of early incidents intensified the growing
animosity between the two government entities.  One of these
incidents centered around the request of the USAO to transport the
birthing shed on the Weaver property from Ruby Ridge to Boise.  The
USAO argued that it was important to have the shed accessible to
permit the testing and use of the shed at trial. [FN1395] The FBI
disagreed and maintained that the shed was not necessary and that
the transportation and storage costs were too high.  The FBI
ultimately agreed to transport the shed to Boise.  Later, when it
became apparent that the USAO would not be using the shed, the FBI
questioned whether the initial request to transport the shed had
been well considered. [FN1395]<p>
     Another issue that created controversy concerned the
conducting of witness interviews in Iowa.  Howen had informed the
FBI case agents that to support the conspiracy theory it was
important to interview witnesses in Iowa who knew Weaver before he
moved to Idaho.  Howen and Lindquist wanted one of the case agents
to conduct these interviews since they believed that they best
understood the facts and nuances of the case. [FN1397]<p>
[GARRITY]<p>
[FN1398] However, the FBI informed the USAO that a <p>
[GARRITY]<p>
case agent could be sent to handle an important interview or a
followup interview. [FN1399]<p>
     At a September 28, 1992 meeting, Special Agents Venkus and
Rampton advised Howen that they were going to send out leads to
Iowa.  According to Venkus, Howen expressed no opposition to this
plan. [FN1400]  On the next day, Howen gave Venkus a list of 
witnessesb for the FBI to interview [FN1401] and noted on the list 
that he wanted "clean 302s." [FN1402]  Soon after Venkus sent out 
the leads, Howen told him that he had misunderstood his 
instructions and that he had just wanted to have the addresses of 
the prospective witnesses updated. [FN1403]<p>
     Ellsworth protested this action to Special Agent in Charge
Eugene Glenn and argued that the agents had only been instructed to
conduct "background leads" which consisted of identifying<p>
[GARRITY]<p>
individuals and places of residence. [FN1404]  Howen, who did not 
recall instructing Rampton to send out the leads, explained to 
Rampton that he did not want the leads conducting the interviews 
because of the animosity existing between the people being 
interviewed -- many of whom were friends or supporters of the 
Weavers -- and the FBI because he wanted to avoid creating a paper 
trail of FD-302's which would reveal his case preparation strategy 
to the defense.  He told Rampton that if the FBI were going to 
conduct the interviews, he wanted the case agents who were 
familiar with the case to handle it. [FN1405]  Lindquist 
instructed Dillon to stop all of these interviews and that if he 
failed to do so, the interviews would have to be redone. [FN1406]<p>
     At some point during this time period, Howen informed Rampton
that he wanted to participate in the Iowa interviews and that he
would not have to generate interview reports. [FN1407]  Rampton told
Howen that Iowa FBI agents would be conducting these interviews. 
One week later, Lindquist informed Rampton that the Marshals
Service had offered them two marshals to assist with the case and
that they had accepted the offer. [FN1408]<p>
     A third dispute between the USAO and the FBI involved [G.J.]
Lindquist explained that it was an essential part of the
government's case to show what had occurred at Ruby Ridge on August
22 as well as on August 21.  Part of this proof consisted of<p>

[G.J.]<p>
[FN1418]  Howen viewed this incident as the "defining moment" 
when the working relationship between the USAO and the FBI on 
the Weaver case "was over." [FN1419]<p>
(2)  The Decision to Assign Members of the
Marshals Service and BATF to Assist in
Case Preparation <p>
     In late October 1992, Deputy Marshals Robert Masaitis and John
Stafford were assigned to assist the USAO in the preparation of the
Weaver case for trial.  At around the same time, BATF also assigned
two special agents -- Herbert Byerly and Jane Hefner [FN1420]-- to
assist the USAO.  Various accounts were provided to investigators
as to who was responsible for assigning the marshals to assist in
the preparation of the case.  Some individuals, including FBI
members, believe that the U.S. Attorney or someone in that office
had made the request [FN1421] while others insist that Director Henry
Hudson volunteered the services of the marshals.  Hudson told us
that he assigned the marshals to the case sometime in October 
1992 after he had a telephone discussion with Ellsworth during 
which Ellsworth complained about the FBI. [FN1422]  However, according 
to Ellsworth and Howen, Hudson offered the assistance of the 
marshals and they accepted the offer. [FN1423] Lindquist remembers 
the incident differently and believes that he first presented the 
proposal to Tony Perez and that the final acceptance of his proposal 
occurred during an October 1992 meeting with Hudson. [FN1424]<p>
     In addition to who precipitated the inclusion of the Marshals
Service and the BATF in the case of preparation, was the issue of
why it was necessary to include them.  The perception among some
was that the USAO was unhappy with the performance and attitude of
the FBI including their refusal to have case agents cover leads
[FN1425] and their failure to accomplish the tasks assigned them. 
[FN1426] Howen insisted that the decision to bring the marshals 
into the case had nothing to do with any disagreement with the FBI 
but rather was because the USAO needed the help. [FN1427] Ellsworth,
who maintained that he had always envisioned the BATF and the 
Marshals Service as having a role in the Weaver case, agreed 
that the decision was influenced by the need for more assistance in
preparing the case.  He was also concerned that the FBI decision to
send leads to conduct out of state interviews indicated that they
were not devoting enough resources to the matter.  He was
particularly concerned because the agents, in contrast to the
marshals, were not based in Boise but rather hundreds of miles away
in Northern Idaho.  Furthermore, the availability of Venkus was
potentially threatened by the demands created by the illness of his
mother.[FN1428]  Lindquist stated that in addition to needing more
help, [FN1429] the presence of the marshals and the BATF agents
demonstrated to the jury a united effort by the government.[FN1430]
Rampton disagreed that the USAO needed the help and maintained 
that there was insufficient work for all of these agents. [FN1431]<p>
     The FBI was also displeased by the failure of the USAO to
consult with them and to inform them of the decision until after
the agents had begun working in Boise.  Ellsworth could not recall
how the FBI was informed about the addition of the marshals.  He
argued that the marshals were always a part of the case and,
indeed, their involvement had preceded that of the FBI.  He
believed that the only change was that two marshals were being
brought in to substitute for Cooper and Hunt who had an obvious
conflict since they were witnesses to the events at issue. [FN1432] 
Howen did not have a clear recollection of how he informed Venkus
and Rampton but suspected it was about the same time that he told
them that they were going to be working together as a team with the
USAO as the chief decision maker. [FN1433]  Lindquist believes that he
told Venkus and Rampton that he had asked the Marshals Service
about providing marshals to assist in the case preparation and that
they were being made available. [FN1434]<p>
     When Rampton first learned that the marshals would be working
on the case he expressed his concern to Lindquist.  According to
Rampton, Lindquist responded that the decision had already been
made and that it was not a Bureau decision.  Later Rampton learned
that the marshals had been in Boise for a week and had been
conferring with the Howen and Lindquist at the time that he first
learned that they would be working on the case. [FN1435]  Dillon 
said that when he called Lindquist and voiced his displeasure, 
Lindquist responded that he did not have to tell Dillon anything 
and that "you guys can't work with anyone." [FN1436] Thereafter, 
Glenn sent Ellsworth a letter protesting the bringing in of the 
marshals to which Ellsworth responded. [FN1437] Rampton stated that 
BATF Agent Byerly was also brought into the investigation without
the knowledge of the FBI. [FN1438]<p>
     With the addition of the marshals and BATF agents to the team,
issues also arose as to what tasks these agents would be performing
and to whom they would be reporting.  Some in the FBI initially
understood that these agents would be assisting in case preparation
but would not be conducting any investigatory activities. [FN1439] 
According to Hudson, Ellsworth told him that he wanted the deputy
marshals to participate in conducting the investigation.  Hudson
expressed reservations about this plan because he did not believe
that any statutory authority existed for this role and he was
concerned that Ellsworth might use the deputy marshals as leverage
against the FBI.  To guard against such a result, Hudson had Duke
Smith work out the details with Mike Dillon with the understanding
that the marshals were to support the FBI but receive their
instructions from the USAO. [FN1440]  Deputy Marshal Stafford had a
somewhat different understanding.  He believed that his
responsibilities would include conducting interviews, locating
witnesses and preparing backgrounds of the defendants. [FN1441]  
Rampton said that Lindquist told him that the marshals would do 
whatever came up in the investigation. [FN1442]  Ellsworth agreed 
with this statement and acknowledged that he had initially 
envisioned that the marshals might be conducting 
interviews. [FN1443]<p>
     The FBI officials always considered the Bureau to be the lead
investigative agency.  Accordingly, it believed that the other
agents would report to and through them.  For example, it was
Rampton's initial understanding that the Marshals Service had
assured Dillon that the marshals would be assigned to the FBI. 
Rampton said this plan was never followed. [FN1444] Dillon told 
Venkus that FBI Headquarters had confirmed that the marshals were 
to report to the FBI and were not to conduct any investigation or
interviews without the approval and knowledge of the FBI. [FN1443]
When the FBI realized that the USAO was adamant that the FBI would
not be the lead agency and that the other agents would not report
through it, the FBI was outraged and responded that it was "their
investigation" and that "they would proceed as they deemed
necessary." [FN1446]<p>
     Chief Deputy Marshal Ronald Evans originally understood that
Masaitis and Stafford would be assisting FBI case agents Venkus and
Rampton. [FN1447]  However, Hudson stated that while the marshals would
be assisting the efforts of the FBI he intended that they would
receive their orders from the USAO. [FN1448]  Stafford was told by his
superiors that he would be working as a team member with the FBI as
opposed to working for the FBI. [FN1449]  Similarly, Masaitis was told
that he was being assigned to assist the USAO and was never told
that he would be working under FBI direction. [FN1450]<p>
     Howen and Lindquist always intended the agents to work on
teams as equal partners and to report directly to them not
through the FBI. [FN1451]  The plan was for each of the agencies to be
responsible for three counts of the indictment as well as some of
the overt acts of the conspiracy. [FN1452]  Howen anticipated that the
Marshals Service and the BATF agents would assist in case
preparation as well as perform some investigatory tasks. [FN1453] 
However, Howen stated that the FBI resisted this approach and
wanted to be a "buffer" between the USAO and the other
agencies. [FN1454]  Ellsworth did not have a clear recollection on this
issue but thought that there may have been an initial understanding
that the FBI case agents would be the intermediary between the USAO
and the marshals. [FN1455]<p>
     The FBI also questioned the jurisdictional authority of the
Marshals Service to be investigating certain counts of the
indictment.  Glenn maintained that the FBI had primary jurisdiction
over all counts in the indictment because the assault on a federal
officer charges were the main offenses alleged in the indictment
and the other charges were "lesser included offenses."  In this
regard, Glenn argued that "[t]he FBI has always retained primary
jurisdiction when other crimes have arisen out of a substantive
violation over which the FBI has jurisdiction" and that [i]t would
not be cost effective to include numerous agencies whenever an
investigation results in lesser included offenses." [FN1456] 
Ellsworth noted in his response to Glenn that he was correct that 
the FBI had primary investigative jurisdiction over the federal 
officer assault count but reminded Glenn that the FBI did not have
exclusive jurisdiction over all counts in the indictment. Ellsworth
accused Glenn of being myopic when he advocated that the FBI had 
exclusive jurisdiction since the other agencies had a vested 
interest in the case and should be permitted to participate "on 
the same footing as the Bureau.' [FN1457]<p>
                    (3) The First Team Meeting<p>
     Howen and Lindquist convened the first team meeting in Post
Falls, Idaho on October 30, 1992. [FN1458]  The parties memories 
differ somewhat as to the tone of this first meeting and what was
discussed.  Howen and BATF Agent Byerly recalled it as an
organizational meeting where the team approach was discussed and
responsibilities were assigned for the various counts of the
indictment and the overt acts of the conspiracy. [FN1459] Byerly
thought that all participants were enthusiastic at this first
meeting. [FN1460]  Deputy Marshal Stafford had a different 
impression. He recalled FBI agents Venkus and Rampton as being 
"very formal and chilly." [FN1461]  Deputy Marshal Masaitis 
sensed that Rampton and Venkus were unhappy about the Marshals 
Service being involved in the case. [FN1462]  Venkus told 
investigators that it was not until he arrived at the meeting 
that he realized that BATF Agent Byerly would also be assisting 
in the case preparation. [FN1463]<p>
     Among the topics discussed at the first meeting were the
organization of the case preparation effort and the
responsibilities of the individual team members.  Howen and
Lindquist informed the agents that each agency would be responsible
for three counts of the indictment and for some of the overt acts
alleged in the conspiracy.  The BATF was responsible for the
original gun charges; the Marshals Service was responsible for the
failure to appear charge; and the FBI was responsible for the
assault of a federal officer charge.  The agents were to work in
teams and to report to Howen or Lindquist. [FN1464]<p>
     Another subject discussed was the conducting of interviews in
Iowa.  Rampton recalled that Howen indicated the need to do
additional interviews in order to develop information that could be
presented to the grand jury.  Rampton interpreted these comments as
a request and sent a teletype asking that leads be sent.<p>
<H4>b.   Specific Problems in Case Preparation
Interviews Conducted by the Marshals Service
and BATF Agents</H4><p>
     During the pretrial period, members of the investigative team
had several discussions concerning the conducting of out of state
interviews and whether these interviews should be documented. 
Lindquist recalled Howen expressing concern that if these
interviews were documented that they would have to be produced
under the open discovery policy and such a disclosure would alert
the defense to the manner in which the prosecution was preparing
its case.  According to Lindquist, Howen then asked the FBI case
agents if they could conduct an inquiry without generating a report
and then review the substance of the interview with him to
determine if any exculpatory or otherwise discoverable information
had been learned.  Lindquist understood that if such information
had been discovered Howen intended to have a report written and to
produce the information to the defense.  Lindquist recalled that
Rampton and Venkus stated that such an approach was "probably" not
a bad idea but that Bureau policy required them to generate a 302. 
At that point, Stafford and Masaitis stated that they were not
mandated to create such forms and would be able to proceed as 
Howen had proposed. [FN1465] Lindquist had no problem with the 
approach because he was convinced of Howen's integrity and knew 
that if any Brady material were uncovered that Howen would 
produce it. [FN1466] <p>
  At some point, Masaitis remembered that after FBI agents
had conducted some interviews in Iowa and obtained negative
results, the USAO suggested that Stafford interview these
witnesses again. The FBI opposed the suggestion. [FN1467] 
Stafford suggested at the team meeting that he "conduct [the]
investigation like cases [he] had worked as a pre trial
investigative arm of the United States Attorney's Office in the
past." Stafford said he tried "to prepare witnesses to talk to
the U.S. Attorney prior to trial and not write reports on it.~ 
According to Stafford, it is the normal practice of the U.S.
Marshal`Marshal's Service when "doing a case" to document
interviews and information acquired for lead purposes. However,
if they are assisting the U.S. Attorney's Office in preparing a
case for trial or the grand jury, that form is not used. [FN1468] 
Stafford claimed that Howen and Lindquist reacted favorably to
this suggestion. [FN1469] He does not recall them stating that
it would be "a good idea not to produce paper." [FN1470] <p>
  Venkus recalled that in one team meeting Stafford told
the participants that he could conduct an interview without
creating discoverable documentation. In response, Venkus
advised Stafford that this was contrary to FBI policy and that
he disagreed with the suggestion. Venkus thought that Stafford
prided himself on not having to create paper like the FBI. fn
1471 <p>
  Rampton thought that the documentation issue was first
raised by Howen and Lindquist. He stated that they wanted
investigation done, especially in Iowa, and that they did not
want any interview documentation created so as to avoid having
to produce it in discovery. Because of the FBI's practice of
documenting all interviews with a 302, Rampton stated that Howen
and Lindquist decided that the marshals would do the Iowa
interview since they had "volunteered" not to produce paper on
the interview. Rampton expressed concern about this plan to
Dillon, as well as to Howen and Lindquist. Thereafter, Howen
and Lindquist qualified their instructions to the FBI and said
that they should continue to document their interviews as they
had in the past. [FN1472] Rampton had suggested tot Howen that
FBI agents in Iowa do the interviews and then, if necessary,
Howen, who wanted to participate in the interviews, could do a
followup. According to Rampton, Howen and Lindquist wanted the
marshals to do the Iowa interviews and Rampton disagreed,
stating that those interviews were an FBI function. [FN1473] <p>
  Howen stated that when it became apparent to him that the
FBI would not allow its case agents to conduct the out of state
interviews, he thought that perhaps the marshals could do it. 
He then asked Stafford if he could conduct the interviews and
whether he was required to prepare written documentation. 
Stafford told Howen that he could conduct the interviews and
that he was not required to document it. [FN1474] Thereafter,
Howen had the marshals and the BATF agent serve subpoenas and
conduct witness interviews. <p>
  Stafford said that Howen and Lindquist asked him to serve
approximately 100 subpoenas and to conduct interviews of
individuals in Iowa, Northern Idaho, Oregon, Spokane, Washington
and Denver, Colorado. [FN1475] Most of these interviews were
conducted in Iowa. Stafford thought that the FBI did not want
to participate in these interviews because they had other things
to do. However, he did not know whether the FBI agents had ever
been asked to conduct the interviews. [FN1476] He did believe
that the FBI agents knew what he would be doing since before he
left to conduct the Iowa interviews he informed Mike Dillon about
his anticipated activities. [FN1477] <p>
  While serving subpoenas, Stafford said he would conduct
interview of those individuals being served. One such interview
was of Howard Brashure in Iowa who was developed as an
informant/witness. [FN1478] Stafford explained that because
this was a high profile case, identifying information about the
witness was not placed on the subpoena but rather on a separate
sheet of paper attached to the subpoena. [FN1479] Stafford
wrote down on this sheet any information that he received during
the interview that he judged to be important as well as
providing his impression of the person as a witness. 
Thereafter, he mailed the sheets back to the U.S. Attorney's
Office. Stafford did not know whether any of these sheets were
ever produced to the defense although he said he was not aware
of any exculpatory material not being turned over to the
defense. [FN1480] A review of the discovery records in the
Weaver case revealed that other than the cryptic notes on some
of the subpoena cover sheets, Stafford did not document these
interviews and that these sheets were not produced in discovery. <p>
  Howen said that Stafford knew whom to interview based on
the subpoenas that were given to him. According to Howen, the
goal was to ask questions that would determine whether a person
should or should not be a witness. [FN1481] Howen told
investigators that he did not instruct Stafford to as specific
questions of the subpoenaed parties but rather informed him of
general subject areas that were important to case development. 
These areas included: the Weavers' activities primarily during
the 1983-85 time period; any information about Weaver's alleged
plan to build a 300 yard kill zone; and identifying any other
witnesses who might be helpful and Howen might want to interview
personally. [FN1482] When Stafford returned from serving the
subpoenas he would brief Howen on the information that he had 
learned. [FN1483] Howen insisted that he never instructed
Stafford no to create documentation but rather used Stafford
because he understood that it was the policy of the Marshals
Service not to create documentation for this type of interview. 
fn 1484 Howen never discussed with Stafford what constituted
exculpatory information nor did Stafford ever raise the issue. 
Howen assumed that Stafford understood the nature of exculpatory
information based upon his experience in the Marshals Service. 
Howen never remembered Stafford conveying to him any exculpatory
information from the interviews conducted in Iowa. [FN1485] <p>
  Lindquist stated that Howen was primarily responsible for
giving Stafford any instructions regarding the serving of the
subpoenas and the interview questions to be asked. [FN1486] To
the extent that Lindquist gave Stafford instructions, they were
general in nature and intended to obtain information that would
reveal the type of person that Weaver was. [FN1487] Lindquist
did not recall any specific instructions given concerning the
documentation of these interviews although he assumed that the
documentation issue had been resolved at the earlier meeting. 
[FN1488] It was not until before trial that Lindquist learned
who had been interviewed in Iowa. [FN1489] <p>
  BATF Agent Byerly did not conduct any interviews in Iowa. 
[FN1490] However, he did participate with Stafford, BATF Agent
Gunderson, Deputy Marshal Hunt and Sheriff Whittaker in serving
subpoenas on 20-40 people in Northern Idaho [FN1491] who 
were neighbors of the Weavers and in conducting "related
interviews." [FN1492] Byerly could not recall Howen or
Lindquist requesting them to conduct interviews without
documenting them. [FN1493] With regard to the interviews that
Byerly conducted, he told investigators that he told the witness
"to tell the truth and cooperate with both the prosecution and
the defense." [FN1494] Of the conversations that he had with
witnesses, Byerly said he prepared approximately five or six
interview reports. His criterion for whether an interview
report was necessary was whether the new information would help
the prosecution or the defense. [FN1495] <p>
  Masaitis did not conduct any interviews in Iowa but did
conduct several interviews while assisting the USAO. Because
none of these interviews produced any positive information,
Masaitis did not document them. Masaitis said it is his
practice to only document an interview if significant
information is developed. He denied that the USAO ever
instructed him not to document the interviews. [FN1496] 
Masaitis never considered his actions "as conducting
investigation." [FN1497] <p>
  Rampton and Venkus said that they were never informed
about when the Iowa interviews were conducted or about the
results of these interviews. Indeed, it was not until later
that the FBI case agents learned of them. [FN1498] Glenn did
not learn about these interviews until after the trial 
when the case agents told him that some of these interviews 
had been conducted without their knowledge. [FN1499] Rampton 
said that the Iowa interviews were done primarily to support 
the conspiracy count but also developed information to 
support other counts. [FN1500] He did not know whether these 
interviews produced any exculpatory information. [FN1501] <p>
  There is no record of what the Iowa witnesses told
Stafford. Howen insisted that if these interviews had produced
exculpatory information he would have produced it to the
defense. [FN1502] To the extent that he was informed of the
information, Lindquist never learned of any Brady information
being disclosed in these interviews. [FN1503] Although Venkus
did not know the specifics of what Stafford had learned in the
interviews, he suspected that some of it was of significance. 
For example, he recalled hearing Stafford discussing
"voluminous" information that a witness had given him about the
John Todd tapes and the concept of "Illuminating." Venkus
believed that Stafford viewed the Todd tapes as a critical link
in the proof required to show the origins of Weaver's alleged
conspiracy. [FN1504] <p>
  (2) Acoustical Test <p>
  The marshals involved in the August 21, 1992 shooting at
Ruby Ridge reported receiving a hundred or more incoming rounds. 
However, investigators recovered far fewer bulled casings. Some
theorized that echoes may have caused it to sound as if more
rounds had been fired. Another important issues in the case was
who fired the first shot. Deputy Marshal Norris had reported
hearing a shot that sounded like it came from the type of gun
that Roderick and Degan were carrying. This conflicted with
Cooper's version of events which was that Harris had fired the
first shot. Thereafter, the USAO and members of the 
investigative team discussed the need to conduct an acoustical
test to explain these arguably conflicting findings. [FN1505] <p>
  Lindquist believed that he first identified the need to
consider whether an acoustical test should be conducted. [FN1506]
He recalled discussing the issue and that he and Rampton
took some steps to determine if there was an expert at the FBI
that would address the issue. At some point, Lindquist recalled
discussing the issue with someone and the FBI laboratory. He
remembered that this individual thought that it would be
difficult to control the environment sufficiently so as to be
confident that the were duplicating the acoustical reality as it
existed on August 21, 1992. [FN1507] Lindquist recalled that he
was not completely satisfied with the response given by the
individual from the FBI lab and had the impression that the
individual had not given adequate consideration to his
questions. Soon thereafter, Lindquist spoke with a federal
prosecutor in Los Angeles who confirmed that it was difficult to
control all of the factors so as to be comfortable with the
accuracy of an acoustical test. [FN1508] Thereafter, Lindquist
suggested to a team member that when they accompanied Lucian
Haag to Ruby Ridge to work on the shooting reconstruction that
they might want to fire a few rounds to see what they heard. 
Thereafter, he understood that this was done and that those
present could reach no conclusions as to the effect of echoes or
whether it was possible to distinguish the weapons being fired. 
fn 1509 <p>
  Rampton confirmed that on approximately October 21, 1992,
he had discussed with Lindquist the need to have and acoustical
test conducted to determine what echoes or reverberations were
caused by the firing of weapons like those involved in the
August 21st shootings. Thereafter, Rampton communicated with
the FBI Laboratory about having the test conducted. [FN1510] 
Following this initial contact, Rampton and Lindquist had
several phone conversations with Supervisory Special Agent Bruce
Koenig who was assigned to the FBI's Engineering Research
Facility in Quantico, Virginia, about the feasibility of
conducting an acoustical analysis of the gunshots fired at the
top of the mountain at Ruby Ridge. Koenig understood that the
Assistant U.S. Attorney with whom he spoke was anxious to 
determine if echoes could have accounted for the difference 
between the number of shots heard by the marshals and the 
number of casings found. He told the attorney that certain 
structures such as cliffs would cause echoes and recommended 
positioning listeners at the various locations where the 
marshals reported being and then firing multiple shots in 
various directions and from various locations to listen 
to the effect. Koenig told the attorney that he was
willing to travel to Ruby Ridge and conduct the test firings. 
Indeed, arrangements were made for Koenig and his team to fly to
Idaho but at the last minute either Rampton or the attorney
contacted him and told him that the trip was unnecessary because
they had conducted the tests and no echoes were heard. [FN1511] <p>
  Masaitis recalled learning that the FBI had expressed
some resistance to conducting the test. The other team members
then explored the option of hiring an expert to conduct the test
but learned that this option would be too costly. At that
point, they decided to conduct their own informal experiment. 
[FN1512] <p>
  At the end of October, Howen, Stafford, Masaitis, Hunt
and Bruce Whittaker from the Boundary County Sheriff Department
travelled to Ruby Ridge to participate in an acoustical test
which consisted of firing weapons similar to those belonging to
the marshals involved in the August 21st shooting. Stafford
believes that Venkus and Rampton were asked to accompany the
group but did not do so. [FN1513] Once everyone assumed their
positions, Masaitis fired some rounds from the rock outcropping
adjacent to the Weaver house while Hunt was down by the & areas. 
fn 1514 Shots were also fired from the & and the area where
Sammy started his retreat back to the cabin. [FN1515] Howen
could not recall if the marshals present made any comments about
how the shots sounded. [FN1516] Although Masaitis could not hear
echoes because he was firing the gun, he recalled that someone
had stated that they had heard echoes. [FN1517] All parties
involved in this test stated that no record, either audio or
written, was produced. [FN1518] <p>
  At the initial team meeting on October 30, 1992,
Lindquist announced that the test had been completed and that
the FBI laboratory did not need to conduct the examination.[FN1519]
He was not aware that at the time Rampton was still in the
process of locating an FBI expert to conduct an acoustical test. 
[FN1520] Rampton, who was informed of this acoustical experiment
after it had been completed, was surprised by the unscientific
methodology used. [FN1521] Howen explained that he decided not
to pursue an expert opinion since he questioned whether an
expert would be able to provide an accurate opinion since any
test that he would conduct would be after the leaves had fallen
from the deciduous trees thus rendering the conditions different
from those present at Ruby Ridge on August 21, 1992. [FN1522] <p>
  The USAO never informed defense counsel about this
experiment. [FN1523] Lindquist explained that he did not think
this rudimentary experiment, which used neither an expert or
equipment, constituted the type of activity that was required to
be disclosed under Fed. R. Crim. P. 16. He characterized their
activities as "preliminary" to see if a formal test might be
warranted. [FN1524] Howen agreed this was not a test and was 
something that anyone, including the defense, could have
conducted. [FN1525] <p>
  (3) Cooperation and Trust Among Trial Team Members <p>
   (i) Historical Problems in the Working Relationship Between 
the USAO and the FBI <p>
  Almost everyone questioned about the subject agreed that
the USAO and FBI experienced numerous problems in their working
relationship during the Weaver prosecution. However, these
problems did not originate with the Weaver matter but rather
appear to have been developing over a number of years. Indeed,
many individuals in the USAO and the FBI agreed that the two
agencies had a history of a poor relationship which deteriorated
further in the Weaver matter. <p>
  From the FBI perspective, Supervisory Special Agent
Dillon felt that there were numerous incidents which contributed
to the problems. He stated that one factor was Howen's
personality which because noticeably hostile to the FBI after
the prosecution of Randy Baldwin. [FN1526] Dillon characterized
Howen's personality after the Baldwin case as being "very
pompous and condescending." Problems between Howen and the Fbi
continued when the two offices strongly disagreed over whether a
local sheriff from Shoshone County should be prosecuted for
public corruption. The FBI ultimately presented the case to the
Department of Justice for consideration. Thereafter, the Public
Integrity Section of the Criminal Division of the Department of
Justice prosecuted the matter -- the first trial ended in a hung
jury while the second trial ended with an acquittal. According
to Dillon, Howen and Ellsworth were extremely upset over the
handling of that case. [FN1527] Dillon told investigators that
one major criticism that he and others had about Howen was that
he would discuss and issue with the FBI or give an instruction
to the FBI and then later forget the discussion or having given
the instruction. Howen would then portray the FBI action as
being contrary to his wishes. Dillon gave as an example a 1990
case involving the arrest of Aryan Nation members with the
arrest scenario proposed by the FBI. According to Dillon, 
Howen repeatedly complained "who was working for who" [FN1528] <p>
  Special Agent in Charge Glenn reported that the
relationship between the USAO and the FBI had been strained for
"some time" and "seemed to deteriorate" further with the Weaver
prosecution. as examples of prior disagreements between the two
offices he pointed to several cases in which the USAO had
concluded that a case lacked prosecutive merit but subsequent
review by the Department of Justice had concluded otherwise.
[FN1529] <p>
  U.S. Attorney Ellsworth agreed that the relationship
between the USAO and Glenn and Dillon had not been the best. He
attributed this problem in part to the case involving the
Shoshone County Sheriff. Although the two offices managed to
work together on matters, Ellsworth stated that the relationship
was one characterized "by pleasantries and ... cordiality at a
very superficial surface level ... but one where we never really
... were able to ... deal with hard issues. [FN1530] Lindquist
was the only member of the USAO and the FBI who stated that
there was not a history of problems between the USAO and the
FBI. Lindquist insisted that the Weaver case was an anomaly and
that before and after the Weaver case he has had a "marvelous
relationship" with the FBI. [FN1531] To the extent there existed
any bad blood" between the FBI and the USAO he characterized it
as "bad blood" between Ellsworth and Dillon who did not get
along. [FN1532] this statement seems inconsistent with the
statements of other individuals interviewed including Special
Agent Wayne F. Manis who provided a 13-page chronology of a
problem that he had with Lindquist which indicated Lindquist's
knowledge of the animosity between the USAO, especially USA
Ellsworth, and Dillon and Glenn that had occurred over the
handling of the prosecution of the Shoshone County Sheriff.
[FN1533] <p>
  Officials at FBI headquarters were aware that there were
problems in the working relationship between the USAO and the
local and district offices of the FBI. This knowledge was based 
largely on the controversy over the public corruption case
involving the Shoshone County Sheriff. [GARRITY] [FN1534] Other
than this incident, we found no indication that FBI Headquarters
had intervened. <p>
   (ii) Problems in the Working Relationship Among Team Members <p>
  From the moment that the USAO and the FBI began working
on the Weaver case problems surfaced in their historical
hostilities. Much of the difficulty can be traced to their
negative perceptions that each agency had developed from working
together on prior matters. The USAO found the FBI to be very
inflexible and inextricably attached to the idea of being the
lead agency and exercising total control over any investigative
task in the case. In addition, the prosecutors were critical of
the unwillingness of the FBI to become a "team player." Howen
noted a significant difference between the attitude of members
of the Marshals Service and members of the FBI. He found the
former to be open, flexible and willing to assist with case
preparation in any way that they wee needed while he found the
FBI to be uncooperative and unwilling to volunteer information. 
[FN1535] Similarly, Lindquist characterized the Marshals Service
and BATF as "very open, very cooperative, very accessible" in
contrast to the FBI which he characterized as a "brick wall." 
[FN1536] Ellsworth attributed part of the difficulties between
the USAO and the FBI to the FBI mentality that "the FBI way is
always right." [FN1537] The FBI case agents found the USAO to
be very controlling and unwilling to include them in the case
preparation process. In addition, the FBI criticized the
prosecutors for being to autocratic, abrasive and
confrontational. <p>
  While preparing the case for trial, there were a number
of incidents that contributed to the negative perception that
each agency had of the other. For example, early in the case,
Lindquist learned that the FBI had issued a directive to the
case agents that they were only to take instructions from
Ellsworth. This directive also required Howen to transmit in
writing to the agents any leads or investigative requests that
he wanted pursued. Apparently this directive was the result of
several incidents including the inclusion of the marshals on the
trial team and the miscommunication concerning the sending of 
leads to Iowa. Lindquist and Ellsworth were very angered by this
directive and contacted the Terrorism and violent Crime Section
of the Department of Justice. Lindquist believed that they
intervened and had the directive revoked. [FN1538] The USAO was
also troubled by the resistance that the FBI showed to the
discovery obligations of the prosecution and to the USAO request
for expert assistance from the FBI Laboratory. [FN1539] <p>
  From the FBI perspective, they were quite upset with how
the USAO was handling the Weaver prosecution including: the
decision to bring the Marshals Service and BATF into the case,
the USAO opposition to sending leads to conduct the Iowa
interviews, [FN1540] the broad scope of the indictment and the
open discovery policy followed by the USAO. Other issues that
concerned the FBI included the debate over the need to transport
the birthing shed from Ruby Ridge to Boise for use at the trial,
criticism voiced by other team members about the FBI crime scene
search and the USAO treatment of FBI members. [FN1541] <p>
  The FBI case agents assigned to the Weaver matter
complained that they felt isolated from the activities of the
other team members. For example, Rampton complained that he was
unaware of the projects on which the marshals were working in
part because they were creating no documentation of their
activities. [FN1542] In addition, the FBI case agents believed
that efforts were taken to exclude them from team meetings and
other team activities. <p>
  Lindquist denied that they intentionally excluded FBI
members from meetings or activities but acknowledged that there
may have been occasions where teams or subteams met without the
other group members. [FN1544] Howen tried to conduct a team
meeting every two or three weeks. He insisted that everyone was
invited and notified of these meetings to discuss matters on
which a particular subteam was working. [FN1545] Both Howen and
Lindquist denied ever instructing the marshals or the BATF
agents to conduct some type of investigative activity and not
inform the FBI about it. [FN1546] Ellsworth suggested that the
reason that the FBI agents felt excluded and believed that the
marshals had a more active role than they did was because the
FBI agents were somewhat physically isolated because they were 
not always in Boise. [FN1547] <p>
  In addition to the problems that they attributed to the
USAO, the FBI agents also detected hostility and a lack of
cooperation from other team members, most notably the marshals. 
For example, although they made their files available to the
other agencies to assist in case preparation, the FBI case
agents did no feel that the other agencies reciprocated. 1548 
The FBI case agents also recognized that the marshals assigned
to the case were sensitive to any remarks or actions by the FBI
that seemed to question the truthfulness of statements made by
Deputy Marshals Cooper and Roderick. For example, at some
point, Venkus and Rampton discussed the possibility that Degan
may have been moving as he fired his weapon since the spent
cartridges from Degan's gun were spread over 22 feet. This
theory was contrary to the marshals' account that Degan had not
fired his weapon. When Rampton presented this theory, he
recalled Masaitis becoming very upset, stating that he did no
have to listen to this and then leaving the discussion. 
Thereafter, Rampton informed Howen that he was going to send
Degan's gun for an ejection pattern test to determine how far
the spent shells would be ejected. Rampton insisted that Howen
concurred with the plan but later failed to acknowledge his
approval thereby making it look as if Rampton had taken this
action on his own. [FN1549] Several weeks later, Rampton
recalled that Howen met with him and asked if he felt that he
could continue as a team member considering the hostility he had
created by questioning the veracity of Cooper. Rampton insisted
that he was not accusing Cooper of lying but only wanted the
team to focus on a possible conflict between the physical
evidence and Cooper's statement that Degan had not fired his
gun. [FN1550] <p>
  From the perspective of the marshals, Stafford was
troubled by Rampton's questioning of the truthfulness of the
Cooper and Roderick statements regarding who fired the first
shot. Stafford felt that when Rampton characterized these
statements as being "less than truthful" he was suggesting that
Cooper and Roderick had "purposely" omitted some information. 
[FN1551]  Another incident that angered the marshals concerned the
inaccuracies that appeared in the FBI draft of the Cooper FD-
302. [FN1552] <p>
  The other team members were aware that the FBI agents
were having difficulty integrating into the team and that
discord existed between them and the FBI agents. For example,
after the first meeting, Stafford perceived that the FBI case
agents were not greatly involved in the case and that they did
not appear to attend very many of the meetings. [FN1553] He
characterized the behavior of the FBI on the case as lacking
initiative and response [FN1554] yet he admitted that he had no
knowledge of the FBI ever refusing to do an investigative task
in this matter. However, he stated that he knew of instances in
which work was assigned to FBI agents but was not completed. 
[FN1555] <p>
  Another team member, BATF Agent Byerly attributed the
discord between the FBI and other team members to "the
reluctance by the FBI to attempt techniques beyond the norm,"
and the resistance of the FBI to release certain documents and
information to the USAO. [FN1556] Byerly was never aware of any
attempts to exclude a team member from a meeting or to withhold
the existence or the results of an investigative activity from
another team member. [FN1557] According to Byerly, any
disagreements related to issues involving investigative
techniques and proposed approaches to supporting the
government's case such as the proposed reconstruction of the
shooting scene. [FN1558] <p>
  According to Howen, throughout the case preparation and
trial period, issues continually arose that created discord
between the FBI and the Marshals Service. In his words, the
problem "never got better." [FN1559] Howen took no specific
actions to diffuse the hostility other than to try to listen to 
all sides and allow them equal input into issues. [FN1560] 
Howen also attributed some of the discord between the FBI and
the Marshals Service to an attitude which he believes is
pervasive in the FBI which is that they are the premier
investigative agency and that the other federal agencies are
inferior. There was also a perception among the Marshals
Service members of the team that the FBI had made many errors in
their handling of the crime scene, including the triangulation
issue [FN1561], and that their efforts would have been better if
it had been an FBI agent who had been killed. The discovery of
a document prepared by the FBI that was highly critical of the
Marshals Service actions in the Weaver case further deteriorated
the relationship between the case agents and the FBI. [FN1562] <p>
  Lindquist attributed the disagreements with the FBI to
the actions and directives of upper management officials and
their failure to communicated with the prosecutors. He believed
that the difficulties that they experienced communicating with
the decision makers in the FBI were due to the command structure
of the FBI and their refusal to communicate with those not at a
comparable rank. [FN1563] To the extent that disagreements
arose between him and the case agents, they were always able to
resolve them except when upper management became involved and
issued orders as to the position to take. [FN1564] Lindquist
said he believed that the FBI case agents were confronted with
the dilemma of wanting to perform their jobs but being required
to adhere to the FBI position on issues such as the lead agency
concept and the sending out of leads. By the early part of
1993, Lindquist thought that the FBI case agents were working
well with the others on preparing the case for trial. [FN1565] <p>
  (4) Attempts to Interview FBI Officials at Headquarters <p>
  As part of their case preparations, Howen and Lindquist
wanted to interview FBI officials who were involved in the
deployment and instruction of the Hostage Rescue Team ("HRT")
and in the formulation and modification of the rules of
engagement. Among the individuals that they wanted to interview
were Danny Coulson, Larry Potts and Mike Kahoe. Howen and
Lindquist identified two separate occasions when they
unsuccessfully sought to interview these individuals. The first
occurred in October 1992 when the prosecutors came to Washington
to meet with DOJ officials and the Marshals Service. [FN1566] 
According to Howen, they had provided advance notice to the FBI
that they were going to be in Washington and wanted to interview
these officials. However, when they arrived in Washington and
contacted the FBI, they were informed that the FBI officials
were unavailable. [FN1567] Neither prosecutor made the
interview arrangements. Howen did not know who had set up the
interviews with the FBI but speculated that it was Dillon or
Rampton [FN1568] while Lindquist believed that the Terrorism and
Violent Crime Section at the Department of Justice had made the
arrangements for a specific day. [FN1569] <p>
  The second time that Howen and Lindquist were
unsuccessful in interviewing the headquarters officials was
sometime in early March 1993. Although Howen could not recall
what, if any, prior arrangements had been made to conduct the
interviews, [FN1570] Lindquist believed that specific times and
been set for these interviews. [FN1571] Lindquist stated that
when they arrived they were told that the FBI officials were
unavailable. It was his impression that they were being "put
off." [FN1572] <p>
  In a March 17, 1993 memorandum, Dana Biehl mentioned that
the prosecutors expressed a need to interview Potts, Kahoe,
Coulson, Uda and Apple. [FN1573] On the next day, James
Reynolds informed Mark Richard, Deputy Assistant Attorney
General of the Criminal Division, of the need of the prosecutors
to interview these individuals. In addition, Reynolds noted
that when the prosecutors had been in town the previous week,
the FBI had declined to make them available until the Waco
standoff was resolved. Reynolds opined that this position was
unacceptable. [FN1574] He told investigators that his
impression was that Howen and Lindquist had not made advance
appointments with the FBI officials. [FN1575] Mary Incontro
told investigators that when the interview request was made
almost everyone was involved with the WACO crisis. She added
that the FBI always indicated a willingness to meet with the
prosecutors. [FN1576] <p>
  Thereafter, Reynolds attempted to arrange interviews with
the FBI officials. The FBI agreed to make the officials
available on two or three consecutive days between the hours of
7:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. When Reynolds informed Lindquist of this
proposal, Lindquist responded that they had been in Washington
two weeks ago and now the FBI officials could come to Boise. In
a later call, Howen and Lindquist indicated that they would try
to complete the interviews during a one week recess in late
April 1993. [FN1577] Howen said he may have conducted one or
two interviews by phone but that the time demands of the trial
caused him to abandon further telephone interviews. [FN1578] <p>

  <H3>3. Discussion </H3><p>
   <H4>a. Decision to Have the Marshals Service and BATF   
Assist in Case Preparation</H4> <p>
  The USAO created great conflict between it and the FBI
when it decided to add the marshals and BATF agents to the trial
preparation team. We find the FBI's actions and attitudes to
have been unjustified and terribly disruptive to the USAO's
trial preparation efforts. Although conflicting evidence exists
as to whether the USAO requested the addition of the marshals to
the trial team or whether the Marshals Service volunteered its
services, we are confident that it was a decision that was
welcomed by both the Marshals Service and the USAO. Perhaps the
USAO could have been more tactful or sensitive in the timing and
manner in which they informed the FBI of this action. However,
we do not consider such a decision to have been one that
required FBI concurrence or approval. We believe that the
decision was appropriate and was certainly one within the
purview of the USAO.   We accept the representations of 
the USAO as to why these agencies were added to 
the trial team, including that they needed additional
assistance in preparing the case for trial. This was a
complicated case that was made dramatically more labor intensive
by the scope of the indictment and the inclusion of the
conspiracy count. Investigative activities needed to be
conducted outside of Boise and large amounts of evidence needed
to be processed, organized and analyzed. We think it was
entirely appropriate for the USAO to turn for assistance to the
Marshals Service and the BATF, both of which had prior
investigative interest and involvement in the case. <p>
  We are troubled by the reaction of the FBI to the
addition of these new members to the trial team and its
tenacious adherence to its position of being the lead agency. 
Such resistance was unjustified, distracted the USAO from its
task of preparing the case for trial, and set a negative tone
for the working relationship between the FBI and the other team
members. <p>
 That the FBI had primary jurisdiction over the assault charges
does not confer power on it to control the entire case. There
was room on the case preparation team for the participation of
other agencies having an interest in the case. Once the case
became the responsibility of the USAO we think that they, not
the FBI, were the appropriate governmental body to control the
direction of the case preparation activities. Although a
component of these activities included additional investigation,
we do not find it inappropriate for the USAO to control and
direct such activities. Indeed, it is the USAO that must
present evidence at trial to satisfy all of the elements of the
charged offenses and to meet the defenses raised by the
defendants. Consequently, we believe that the USAO was in the
best position to assess how to prepare the case for trial. 
Having the FBI function as an intermediary between the USAO and
the other agencies would have added a needless and burdensome
bureaucratic layer. We respect the decision of the USAO not to
have instituted such an approach and are extremely critical of
the rigidity of the FBI on this issue. In our view, the FBI
lost sight of its role as assisting rather than controlling the
actions of the USAO. <p>
   <H4>b. The Iowa Interviews and the Failure to Document
the Results</H4> <p>
  We are not aware of any legal principle or statutory
requirement that requires governmental investigators to document
all of the interviews that they conduct. See United States v.
Martino, 648 F.2d 367, 387 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 456 U.S.
943 (1981). Although the FBI requires its agents to document
their interviews, other governmental agencies do not impose
requirements that are as exacting. In this case, the
prosecutors took advantage of the less restrictive documentation
requirements of the Marshal Service and had the marshals conduct
approximately 100 witness interviews during the serving of
subpoenas. [FN1553] It is our opinion that this practice was
imprudent. <p>
  Under the Brady doctrine the government is required to
disclose to the defense material evidence that is both favorable
to the accused and material to either guilt or punishment. See
United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 676, 682 (1985); Brady v.
Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 87 (1963). This requirement is not
limited to information that is in written form but extends to
oral statements of which the government is aware. See
generally, Carter v. Rafferty, 826 F.2d 1299 (3d Cir. 1987),
cert. denied, 484 U.S. 101 (1988). In addition, the prosecutor
is responsible for producing Brady information which is within
the knowledge of persons working as part of the prosecution team
of intimately connected with the government's case. United
States v. Butler, 567 F.2d 885, 889 (9th Cir. 1978); United
States v. Morell, 524 F.2d 550, 555 (2d Cir. 1975). Although we
discovered no evidence that these interviews produced any
exculpatory information, our inquiry was severely restricted
since no written, audio or video record was created of these
interviews. Without memorializing these interviews, we were
forced to rely on the memories of two individuals: Howen and
Stafford. <p>
  Howen insisted that if these interviews had produced any
exculpatory information that he would have notified defense
counsel. No matter how sincere Howen is on the issue, we are
not comfortable that the interview process in place was adequate
to ensure that exculpatory information was identified. No one
ever instructed the marshals or took steps to ensure that they,
particularly Stafford, understood the type of information that
qualified for production under the Brady rule. Moreover, some
of the notations that Stafford made on the subpoena cover sheets
suggest that significant information might have been learned. 
[FN1584] Although this information may not have been Brady
material, we have no reliable means to comfortably conclude that
it is not. <p>
  Although we recognize that prosecutors may sometimes
participate either directly or indirectly in interviews that are
not documented, we are concerned by the actions of Howen in this
case. Here, we are not talking about one or two undocumented
interviews but rather we are faced with a situation where
approximately 100 interviews were conducted in this manner. 
[FN1585] Although there may be no direct evidence that 
exculpatory information was learned and concealed, we think that
adverse interferences may be drawn by the undocumented interview
process followed in the Weaver prosecution. There were no
reliable safeguards in place to ensure that if exculpatory
information were learned that it would be provided to the
defense. [FN1586] Relying on the memory and judgment,
regardless of how well intentioned, of a marshal who was not
specifically trained or instructed regarding the identification
of exculpatory information, does not suffice. Accordingly, we
find the procedure to be inappropriate and advise against
adopting a similar practice in the future. <p>
    <H4>c. Acoustical Experiment at Ruby Ridge</H4> <p>
  We find nothing improper about the acoustical experiment
that members of the prosecution team conducted in late October
1992 at Ruby Ridge. Indeed, we accept the explanation provided
by Lindquist that it was nothing more than a preliminary attempt
to determine if expert assistance was necessary. The test
firings were not scientifically planned or conducted. Even
Rampton was surprised by the unscientific methodology used. The
test consisted only of the firing of guns at the approximate
locations where the participants of the August 21, 1992 shooting
were located. There were no controls on the experiment or
written findings. Nor, as Howen recognized, was there any way
to duplicate the August 21st conditions since most of the leaves
had fallen from the deciduous trees. <p>
  The test results were clearly not discoverable under Fed.
R. Crim. P. 16(a)(1)(D) for two obvious reasons. [FN1587] First,
the test would not qualify as a scientific test or experiment as
that term is commonly understood. The actions that the
participants took in conducting their rudimentary test did not
utilize modern scientific techniques. [FN1588] Second, Rule 16
has been interpreted as requiring only the disclosure of written
reports and written test results. United States v. Peters, 937
F.2d 1422, 1425 (9th Cir. 1991); United States v. Glaze, 643
F.2d 549, 552 (8th Cir. 1981). The government is under no duty
to turn over informal internal documents, but need only disclose
final results and reports. United States v. Iglesias, 881 F2d
1519, 1523-24 (9th Cir. 1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 1088
(1990). Here, no written results were ever prepared. <p>
  Even if the experiment were not discoverable under Rule
16, the issue remains whether the government should have
disclosed it to the defense as Brady material. We find that
such disclosure was not required. From the evidence produced in
our investigation, we found no indication that the test produced
any type of result that could be properly classified as being
exculpatory in nature. No one present for the test could recall
what, if any, conclusions were reached. Lindquist, who was not
present at the test, recalls hearing that the results were
inconclusive as to the effect of echoes and whether the firing
of different types of guns could have been distinguished. Howen
told investigators that he never gave any consideration to
informing the defense of the acoustical test because he did not 
consider what they were doing to be exculpatory. [FN1589] Moreover,
in our view, the unscientific nature of the test coupled with the
difference in conditions caused by the fallen leaves were
significant variables that would call into question any results
obtained. For all of these reasons, we conclude that the test
did not constitute Brady material. <p>
  <H4>d. Attempts to Interview FBI Officials</H4> <p>
  Although we find the difficulty that the prosecutors
encountered in attempting to interview FBI officials in
Washington to be unfortunate, the evidence was inconclusive that
these officials or others in the FBI were intentionally avoiding
being interviewed. Indeed, we are not convinced that explicit
interview arrangements were ever made. No one was able to
provide us with a satisfactory account of who set up the
interviews, what specific arrangements were made, and what
information was provided to the interviewees. Neither Howen nor
Lindquist had a good sense as to who was making the arrangements
to interview the FBI officials. Nor did the clearly recall
having exact times set during which the interviews would occur. <p>
  Furthermore, none of the FBI officials recalled the first
unsuccessful interview attempt. All denied that they had ever
refused an interview request from the prosecutors. Mary
Incontro indicated that the officials always appeared willing to
meet with the prosecutors. To the extent that these officials
may have been unavailable for interviews during the Waco crisis,
we do not find the excuse to have been a fabrication. These
officials were closely involved in the Waco crisis, were working
long hours and were responsible for monitoring the crisis and
making critical decisions. When James Reynolds contacted them,
they agreed to make themselves available for evening interviews. 
Although perhaps the FBI officials could have shown more
flexibility in accommodating the needs of the prosecutors, we
cannot conclude that their actions were totally without
justification. <p>
  In the future, we would hope that the FBI will work to
facilitate the access of prosecutors to FBI headquarters
officials who are important to the preparation of federal
prosecutions. A system needs to be instituted whereby the local
FBI office either can make firm arrangements for such interviews
or can introduce the prosecutors to the officials so that direct
arrangements may be made. Although we appreciate the continuous
demands made of many FBI officials, they must recognize that
assisting federal prosecutors in preparing their cases for trial
is included among their responsibilities as a member of the
federal law enforcement team. <p>
  <H4>e. Relationship Among the Investigative Team</H4> <p>
  Prior to the beginning of the Weaver case preparation,
problems existed in the working relationship between the FBI and
the USAO. However, the relationship between these two branches
of the department of Justice dramatically deteriorated with the
Weaver prosecution. Although our investigation did not reveal
that either side was intentionally taking actions to aggravate
the other or to sabotage the prosecution, we were dismayed by
the failure of the parties to more actively try to resolve their
disagreements. <p>
  Many of the individuals questioned about the relationship
between the USAO in Boise and the FBI attributed the discord to
a personality clash between the parties involved. [FN1590] 
Some, including Stafford, attributed the problem as being
traceable primarily to the FBI Headquarters and the regional
office in Utah. [FN1591] We agree that some of the difficulties
were probably worsened by personality clashes between members of
the USAO and the FBI. However, we believe that the problem goes
much deeper and originated in the bureaucratic rigidity of the
FBI and the institutional bias displayed by some members of that
institution. <p>
  The behavior of the FBI in the Weaver case revealed their
troubling unwillingness to work as a team player. If the FBI
could not be in control or it its views were not adopted, the
FBI participated in an unreasonable manner by either refusing to
cooperate or going through the motions of cooperating while
exhibiting a negative attitude. Examples of such behavior
included the intransigence that the FBI showed with regard to
its opposition to the case agents conducting the interviews of
the Iowa witnesses, the unwillingness of the FBI to accept and
work with representatives from the other investigatory agencies,
the failure of the FBI to actively assist the USAO by providing
expert assistance, [FN1592] and the resistance of the FBI to
producing materials that the USAO believed were discoverable. <p>
 [G.J.] <p>
 [G.J.] <p>
 The FBI is supposed to work together to assist the prosecutors
in developing and presenting criminal cases for trial. In the
Weaver case the FBI lost sight of this crucial responsibility. <p>
  When decisions were made by the USAO with which they did
not agree, the FBI found it difficult to accept them and to
proceed with the task of preparing the case for trial. This
problem appeared both to emanate from the managerial levels of
the FBI and to filter down in a diluted form to the case agents. 
We also detected a prevalent and troubling attitude among
members of the FBI that they are the superior investigators and
that all other investigative agencies are inferior. This
attitude was detected by the other agencies which served to
further weaken the already fragile working relationship. <p>
  Although we sympathize with the pressures under which
members of the USAO were operating in prosecuting this case, we
were left with the impression that perhaps further actions and
discussions might have lessened or resolved the disagreements
between the USAO and the FBI. With regard to the clash between
the FBI and the other investigative agencies, the USAO appeared
to allow matters to proceed without taking any significant steps
to improve the working relationship among these groups. We
suspect that the personalities involved in these disputes
contributed to the standoff that seemed to exist between the
USAO and the FBI. What was needed was a strong personality that
could have risen above the fray and attempted to resolve the
disagreements and misunderstandings that existed. We are
encouraged by the actions and attitude of the new U.S. Attorney
for the District of Idaho and are hopeful and optimistic that
she and the FBI will be successful in eliminating some of the
problems that have plagued the relationship between her office
and the FBI. <p>
  <H3>4. Conclusion</H3> <p>
  The working relationship between the FBI and the USAO and
other team members in the Weaver case was poor and, in our view,
adversely impacted upon the preparation of the Weaver case for
trial. Active steps must be taken to ensure that such problems
do not repeat themselves in subsequent prosecutions. <p><hr><p>

     1398 <p>
               See also, Venkus FD-302, at 19.  Lindquist rejected
the economic justification argument advanced for using leads since
the Weaver matter was a major case and the FBI had always found the
money to investigate major cases.  He believed that the FBI was
insisting on leads simply because that was the way the Bureau
always handled such matters.  Lindquist Interview, Tape 2, at 5-6.<p>
     1399 Dillon adamantly opposed having the case agents conduct
out of state interviews.  Dillon FD-302, at 11.<p>

     1401 This document is captioned, "Things to Do."  The first
item on the list states, "Get agent in or near Cedar Rapids to get
all articles on the Weaver's for background," and then to interview
the nine witnesses on the list.  See Undated Document entitled
"Things to Do," authored by Ronald Howen.<p>
     1402 Venkus FD-302, at 22.  Rampton explained that a "clean
302" was one in which the identifying FBI file number was not
present.  According to Rampton, Howen did not want the FBI file
number on the document because it would impair the ability of the
defense to obtain all of the information in that file under a
Freedom of Information Act request.  Rampton FD-302, at 21.<p>

     1455 Ellsworth Interview, Tape 4, at 22.<p>
     1456 Letter from Eugene Glenn to Maurice Ellsworth, October
27, 1992, at 1.<p>
     1457 Ellsworth stated that: the FBI had primary investigative
jurisdiction as to the two assault on a federal officer counts and
the murder count; the Marshals Service had 
primary investigative jurisdiction as to the three counts of the
indictment charging the failure to appear, harboring a fugitive and
commission of a crime while pending release for trial; the BATF had
primary jurisdiction for the three gun related offenses; and that
all three investigative agencies had responsibility for parts of
the conspiracy count.  Letter from Maurice Ellsworth to Eugene
Glenn, October 23, 1992, at 1-2.<p>
     1458 Initially, Venkus and Rampton informed Howen and
Lindquist that they would be unable to attend the first meeting
because of a conflicting meeting with Dillon.  Venkus FD-302, at
18.  The USAO believed that this was an excuse made by the FBI
because they were embittered by the decision to bring in the other
agents.  Lindquist Interview, Tape 2, at 15-16; Memo to
Weaver/Harris File from Kim R. Lindquist, dated October 26, 1992;
Memorandum from Maurice Ellsworth to Kim Lindquist and Ron Howen,
dated October 26, 1992.  the FBI disputes that charge and maintains
that there were legitimate reasons for their inability to attend
the meeting scheduled.  After initially declining to attend the
first team meeting in Post Falls, Idaho, Dillon, ASAC Tubbs,
Rampton and Venkus attended the meeting after Howen rescheduled it
to another date.  Venkus FD-302, at 18.<p>

   1468 Stafford Sworn Statement, at 7-8. chief Deputy Marshal
Ronald Evans seemed to confirm this practice. He stated that it
is standard procedure for deputy marshals to document the
results of any investigation that they conduct but that it is
"up to the individual and is generally discussed with the AUSA."

   1491 Byerly recalled wondering why Venkus, who lived in
Northern Idaho, was not participating in serving the subpoenas. 
He did not know whether Venkus and Rampton were aware that they
were serving the subpoenas and conducting the interviews. 
Byerly Sworn Statement, at 24. Howen said that normally the
marshals would serve their subpoenas. He could not recall why
Deputy  Marshal Cluff, who had the region, did not serve the 
subpoena but he speculated that he might have been unavailable. 
In any even, Howen stated that Stafford was a marshal and that 
was consistent with his practice of having the marshals serve 
the subpoenas. Howen Interview, Tape 9, at 1. <p>

reported that following a February 1993 team meeting at which
Howen and Lindquist agreed that the FBI should conduct some Iowa
interviews, Rampton sent out leads to conduct these interviews.
At a subsequent team meeting, Rampton was surprised to learn 
from Stafford that he had already conducted some of these 
interviews. <p>

Byerly did not participate in the acoustical test but was aware
that it occurred and believes that he was informed of the
results. It was his understanding that the purpose of the test

 1540 By Fall 1992, the relationship had deteriorated to such
a point that Assistant U.S. Attorney Marc Haws drafted a
memorandum of understanding ("MOU") between the USAO and the
FBI. Lindquist Interview, Tape 2, at 8-9. According to Howen,
the relationship had become so poor that Ellsworth was ready to
state that the USAO would stop trying cases referred by the FBI
if they did not stop trying to control the prosecutions. Howen
Interview, Tape 11, at 10-11. The MOU set forth terms of
cooperation to be followed by the USAO and the FBI when working
together in preparing major criminal cases for trial. The last
version of this document was transmitted to Glenn and Dillon for
signature; Glenn never executed the document. Howen Interview,
Tape 11, at 10-11; Ellsworth Interview, Tape 4, at 13-16.

 1576 FD-302 Interview of Mary Incontro, August 10, 1993 at 3. <p>
 1577 Reynolds FD-302, August 11, 1993, at 6. Sometime during
the pretrial preparation of the Weaver case, Jeffrey Howard, who
at the time was Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General of
the Department of Justice, recalled a meeting with two Assistant
U.S. Attorneys for Idaho and other DOJ officials. Howard
recalled that the Assistants were complaining about their access
to people at FBI Headquarters. It was his recollection that
someone from the meeting called the FBI and made arrangements
for the Assistants to meet with those individuals with whom they
had been trying to meet. FD-302 Interview of Jeffrey Howard,
January 3, 1994, at 3. <p>

 1580 [Garrity] <p>
 1581 [Garrity] <p>
 1532 [Garrity] <p>
 1583 Although Howen and Lindquist may not have issued a
specific directive not to document the interviews, the evidence
demonstrates without question that they did not want to create a
paper trail of their activities for the defense to discover and
that the reason that they did not have the FBI conduct the
interviews was because their agents were required to prepare
written reports of the interviews that they conducted. When
questioned about the failure of the deputy marshals to document
the interviews conducted while serving subpoenas, former
Marshals Service Director Hudson stated that he would not permit
an Assistant U.S. Attorney to direct a deputy marshal not to
write a report in order to avoid discovery requirements. Hudson
FD-302, at 9. <p>
 1584 For example, on the subpoena sheet for Chris Colegrove,
Stafford deleted the typed words "not needed" and wrote
"needed." Stafford wrote on the subpoena sheet for Steve
Tanner, "This guy must be interviewed. Ron & Kim, Talk to me
about this guy. JWS." <p>
 1585 U.S. Attorney Ellsworth was unaware that these
interviews had not been documented and had always assumed that
the marshals had agreed to use the FD-302 interview form when 
conducting interviews. He stated that he would have been 
concerned if he had learned that the interviews were not 
being documented since a record needed to be made of
the information collected to ensure that the USAO was complying
with its discovery obligations. In addition, Ellsworth thought
that the conducting of undocumented interviews seemed
inconsistent with the open discovery policy of the USAO. 
Ellsworth saw no problem in documenting all interviews but
stated that there might be some situation when it would not be
necessary. Ellsworth Interview, Tape 4, at 26-28. <p>
 1586 James Reynolds believed that an interview should be
documented if it generates significant information even if the
amount of information involved is small. Reynolds FD-302,
October 3, 1993, at 6. <p>
 1587 In the discovery stipulation executed by the parties,
they agreed "to reciprocal disclosure and inspection of all
material stated" in Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(a)(1) and 16(b)(1). See
stipulation and Reciprocal Request for Discovery and Inspection,
Notice of Alibi and Notice of Mental Condition, dated October
16, 1992, a 1. Rule 16(a)(1)(D) of the Federal Rules of
Criminal Procedure provides in pertinent part that, <p>
  Upon request of a defendant the government shall permit
the defendant to inspect and copy or photograph any results or
reports ... of scientific tests or experiments ... which are
within the possession, custody or control of the government, the
existence of which is known, or by the exercise of due diligence
may become known, to the attorney for the government, and which
are material to the preparation of the defense or are intended
for use by the government as evidence in chief at the trial. <p>

<H3>IV. SPECIFIC ISSUES INVESTIGATED</H3><p>
     <H3>B.  The Failure of Weaver to Appear for Trial</H3><p>         <H3> 1.
Introduction</H3><p>
     On January 18, 1991, Randy Weaver was arraigned on the charges
that he made an possessed illegal firearms.  At that time, the
court set February 19, 1991, as the trial date.  Several weeks
later the court clerk sent a notice to the parties informing them
that the trial date had been changed from February 19 to February
20.  Two days later, U.S. Probation Officer Karl Richins sent a
letter to Weaver in which he erroneously referred to the trial date
as March 20, 1991.  When Weaver did not appear in court on February
20, the court issued a bench warrant for his arrest.  Almost a
month later, on March 14, 1991, when the bench warrant was still
outstanding, a federal grand jury returned an indictment against
Weaver charging him with failure to appear for trial.<p>  A number of issues have been
raised with regard to the conduct
of the government in handling this stage of the Weaver matter. 
These issues include: whether government officials, particularly
the U.S. Attorney's Office, knew about the erroneous Richins letter
before the court issued the February 20 bench warrant; whether the
government responded appropriately to the issues created by the
Richins letter; whether the U.S. Attorney's Office erred in
presenting the indictment to the grand jury before March 20;
                             [G.J.]<p><H3>2.  Statement of Facts</H3><p>   <H4>a. 
January 18, 1991 Arraignment</H4><p>On December 13, 1990, a federal grand jury indicted
Randy
Weaver for making and possessing illegal firearms.[FN71] BATF Agent
Herbert Byerly arrested Weaver on January 17, 1991 and transported
him to Coeur D'Alene, Idaho for arraignment.  On January 18, Byerly
informed Assistant U.S. Attorney Howen that Weaver had been
arrested, that Weaver had resisted arrest, that Weaver had said
when arrested, "nice trick; you'll never do that again" and that
Weaver appeared to be associated with the Aryan Nation.  Byerly
also provided background information on the case and recommended to
Howen that Weaver be detained because Byerly did not believe that
he would appear for trial.  According to Byerly, Howen responded
that it would be difficult to detain Weaver and did not offer to
oppose the release of Weaver.[FN72]<p>Weaver appeared in court for his arraignment the
following day
before U.S. Magistrate Judge Stephen Ayers.  No one was present for
the government at the arraignment nor was Weaver represented by
counsel.[FN73]<p.    At the arraignment, Judge Ayers discussed the appointment of
counsel with Weaver. Weaver consented to the appointment of
Everett Hofmeister, who had previously represented him on an
unrelated civil matter. Thereafter, Judge Ayers entered a not
guilty plea for Weaver and informed him that the trial was set for
February 19, 1991 in Moscow, Idaho.[FN74] Judge Ayers then addressed
the issue of pretrial release and decided to release Weaver on
certain conditions including that he "appear for all proceedings
before this Court.  And the next scheduled court appearance is, as
I said earlier, your trial in Moscow, on the 19th of February."
[FN75] In addition, Judge Ayers required Weaver to execute an 
unsecured bond in the amount of $10,000.  Judge Ayers explained 
to Weaver that if he failed to abide by any of the conditions of 
release, including the obligation to appear for trial, the United 
States could execute the bond by seizing and selling his real 
property.[FN76]<p> Before releasing Weaver, Judge Ayers instructed him that he
was required to report on a regular basis to Karl Richins, the
Pretrial Service Officer, in Boise and that his first contact was
to be on January 22.[FN77] Later, Judge Ayers, in order to avoid any
misunderstanding, added Richins' name and phone number to the order
setting forth the release conditions.[FN78] Judge Ayers told Weaver
that it would be a criminal offense if he failed to appear.  Weaver
said that he understood the penalties for violating the release
conditions and that he agreed to abide by those conditions.  
Thereafter, he signed and received a copy of the
release conditions.[FN79] Weaver also signed a bond and the court
explained that the bond could be executed if he failed to appear
for trial.[FN80] Before terminating the proceeding, Judge Ayers had
Weaver confirm that his mailing address was Box 103 in Naples,
Idaho.[FN81]<p><H4>b.   Events Occurring From the Arraignment Through February 20,
1991</H4><p>     (1)  Communications With Weaver<p>
     On January 22, 1991, four days after the arraignment, Judge
Ayers sent a letter to Everett Hofmeister informing him that he had
been appointed defense counsel for Weaver, that Weaver could be
contacted at "PO Box 103, Naples, Idaho 83847" and that the trial
date was set for February 19, 1991.  A copy of this letter was sent
to Weaver.  On that same day, Weaver telephoned Karl Richins, the
U.S. Probation Officer, and informed Richins that he had been
ordered to call Richins on that date.  Richins told Weaver that he
had not received the paperwork on his case and, thus, could not
advise him about the release conditions.  Richins asked Weaver to
leave his name and phone number so that Richins could call him when he received the case
file.  According to Richins, Weaver never gave him a phone number where he could be
contacted nor could Richins
recall what understanding the parties had as to how Richins would
contact Weaver in the future.[FN82] After this conversation, 
Richins never heard from Weaver again.[FN83]<p> On January 19, 1991, defense counsel
Hofmeister sent a letter
to the two addresses he had for Weaver, requesting Weaver to
contact him.  Hofmeister sent similar letters to Weaver at these
addresses on January 31 and February 5.  Around February 5,
Hofmeister contacted individuals who knew Weaver and requested that
they instruct Weaver to contact Hofmeister immediately.[FN84]<p>Meanwhile, in early
February, the court learned that the
Weaver trial, which had been scheduled for February 19, would have
to be changed to give the participants sufficient travel time
following a federal holiday on the preceding Monday.  On February
5, the court clerk sent a notice to the parties informing them that
the trial was rescheduled for February 20, 1991.  Although this
notice was not sent directly to Weaver, a copy was sent to and
received by Hofmeister.[FN85]<p>
     Two days later, on February 7, 1991, probation officer Richins
sent a letter to Weaver at his Naples address.  Richins wrote:<p>
On January 18, 1991, you were released on
Pretrial Supervision pending your trial set
for March 20, 1991.  You contacted our office
and I advised you we would be getting back
with you as soon as we received the paper work
from Magistrate Ayers.  I have long ago
received the paperwork but have been unable to
locate a telephone number where I could
contact you.  Accordingly, with this letter, I
are [sic] requesting you to contact me at 334-
1630 as soon as possible.  You may call collect if you choose.[FN86]<p>
(Emphasis added.)<p>
     According to Richins, he wrote the letter because he needed to
establish pretrial supervision of Weaver and had not heard from
Weaver since their January 22 phone conversation.[FN87] The only
explanation that Richins could provide for the erroneous trial date
was that it was a typographical error.  At trial, Richins expressed
regret for the error and testified that he had placed the date in
the letter as part of his effort to get Weaver to contact him.
[FN88] Weaver never responded to Richins' letter.[FN89]<p> On February 8, 1991, after
receiving the February 6 court
notice, Hofmeister wrote another letter urging Weaver to contact
him and informing Weaver that the trial date had been changed to
February 20.  Four days later, having still not heard from Weaver,
Hofmeister placed numerous unanswered calls to a telephone number
at which Weaver reportedly received messages.  In addition,
Hofmeister asked individuals who had contact with Weaver to ask
Weaver to contact Hofmeister immediately.  However, as of the
morning of February 20, Weaver had not contacted Hofmeister.
[FN90]<p>
(2)  The "Queen of Babylon" Letters and the
Threat Assessment by the U.S. Marshals Service<p>
     On February 7, 1991, the U.S. Attorney's Office in Boise received two letters
signed by Vicki Weaver.  The first letter was
dated January 22, 1991 -- the same day that Weaver called Richins - and was addressed to
"The Queen of Babylon."  It stated in part:<p>
A man cannot have two masters.  Yahweh Yahshua Messiah,
the anointed One of Saxon Israel is our law giver and our
King.  We will obey Him and no others. . . . 'a long
forgotten wind is starting to blow.  Do you hear the
approaching thunder?  It is that of the awakened Saxon. 
War is upon the land.  The tyrants blood will flow.'[FN91]<p>
The last quote was credited to "Mathews."<p>
     The second letter, dated February 3, 1991, was addressed to
"Servant of the Queen of Babylon, Maurice O. Ellsworth, U.S. Attny
[sic]" and stated in part:<p>
Yah-Yahshua the Messiah of Saxon Israel is our Advocate
and our Judge.<p>
The stink of your lawless government has reached Heaven,
the abode of Yahweh our Yahshua.  Whether we live or
whether we die, we will not bow to your evil
commandments.[FN92]<p> Ellsworth did not associate the name Vicki Weaver with any
matter pending in his office.[FN93]  However, because the language
of the letters appeared somewhat threatening, he requested the U.S.
Marshals Service in Boise ("USMS") to conduct a threat assessment
of the letters.[FN94] Deputy U.S. Marshal Warren Mays was assigned 
to perform the threat assessment.[FN95]<p>
     After checking with state and local agencies, Mays determined
that Vicki Weaver was the wife of Randy Weaver.[FN96]  Once this
connection was made, Chief Deputy U.S. Marshal Ronald Evans
convened a staff meeting, to determine how to proceed with the
threat assessment.  It was decided that Deputy U.S. Marshal David
Hunt would be assigned to assist Mays in the inquiry.[FN97]<p>Thereafter, Hunt and Mays
began to gather information to
enable them to prepare a "Threat Source Profile" of Weaver.[FN98]
Mays first reviewed the bail report prepared for Weaver which 
revealed that Weaver had admitted membership in the 
"Aryan Nations/Church of Jesus Christ Christian," had attended 
three Aryan World Congresses and had been wearing and Aryan 
Nations belt buckle at the time of the arrest.[FN99] In 
addition, Mays analyzed the language in the two letters 
written by Vicki Weaver and concluded that the letters
contained "rhetoric commonly associated with the Aryan
Nations/Church of Jesus Christ Christian."[FN100]  Evans 
characterized defense counsel Hofmeister as "a noted [Aryan 
Nations] attorney."[FN101]  Based on this information,
Mays initially concluded that the two letters from Vicki Weaver
contained veiled but not overt threats.[FN102]<p>Mays next asked Senior Deputy U.S.
Marshall Jack Cluff, the
resident officer in Moscow, Idaho, about the pending firearms
charge against Weaver.  Cluff suggested that Mays contact BATF
Agent Byerly.  Cluff also told Mays that he had learned from Lonnie
Ekstrom, a deputy in the Boundary County Sheriff's Office, that
Weaver had sent a letter to that office stating that he would not
leave his cabin and that law enforcement officers would have to
take him out.[FN103] Ekstrom recalled that in the letter the Weavers
voiced, "sentiments which indicated that [they] felt as though the
end is near and [that] the Federal Agents are watching very
closely."[FN104]<p>
     Cluff told Mays that Byerly had described Weaver as being
"extremely uncooperative at the time of his booking" and believed
that Weaver "planned not to appear for future court proceedings."
[FN105] Byerly also reported to Cluff that Weaver:<p>
is very adamant and very convinced in his own
mind of his religious beliefs in that the
government is posing a threat to him.  He is
very anti-government.  He believes that this
charge by the federal government against him
is the beginning of Armageddon.  The religious
war is about to begin.  The end of the world
is coming and he is ready to make his stand in
the final battle.  I would urge utmost caution
and care in his arrest.  I believe his
children are going to be armed.  If the
situation is such that they were present
during his apprehension, I believe that they
should definitely be considered to be a threat 
to the arresting officers.[FN106]<p>
     Mays next spoke with Special Supervisory Agent Michael Kelly
who reported that the entire Weaver family, including the 12 and 14
year old children, were armed "at all times."  Kelly told Mays that
a BATF informant had indicated that the Weaver children slept with
weapons in their beds.[FN107] Neither Kelly nor anyone else in BATF
advised either Hunt or Mays that BATF had attempted to solicit
Weaver to work as an informant.  Indeed, it was not until over a
year later that the marshals learned of this action.[FN108]<p> As their investigation
continued, Mays was briefed by the U.S.
Secret Service on its investigation of Weaver for alleged threats
he had made against President Reagan and the Governor of Idaho in
1985.[FN109] In addition, Mays and Hunt interviewed people in the
community who might have further background information on
Weaver.[FN110] Hunt and Mays also reviewed a copy of the military
record "DD-214" for Weaver.  Although the record did not indicate
that Weaver had been a Green Beret or a member of the Special
Forces, they speculated that Weaver may have received some general
demolition training based on an indication in the record that
Weaver had training as a "combat engineer."[FN111]<p>
     On February 11, 1991, Mays forwarded the materials that he had
gathered on Weaver to the Marshals Service Threat Analysis
Division.[FN112]  Around this time, Mays briefed Ellsworth on their
findings.  Mays told Ellsworth that they did not believe that he
was personally at risk and that they doubted that Weaver would
appear for trial.[FN113]<p>  When Ellsworth learned that Vicki Weaver was the wife of
Randy
Weaver, he discussed the matter with Assistant U.S. Attorney Howen,
who had been assigned to the Weaver prosecution.[FN114] Ellsworth
showed Howen the January 22 letter from Vicki Weaver.  Howen
identified "the long forgotten wind" passage as not being from the
biblical book of Matthew but rather from the "Declaration of War"
written by Robert Mathews, the founder of "The Order," a white
supremacist group.[FN115] Soon after he wrote the Declaration, Mathews
was killed during a standoff with the FBI at a house on Whidbey
Island, Washington.  Shortly after Howen relayed this information
to Ellsworth, Chief Deputy Marshal Evans reported to Tony Perez,
the Chief of Enforcement Operations at Marshals Service
Headquarters, that sources within BATF had stated that Weaver had
the potential to be "another Bob Mathews and his homestead another
Whidbey Island standoff."[FN116]<p>
<H4>c.  February 20, 1991 - The Rescheduled Trial Date</H4><p>
     Although the USAO continued preparing the Weaver case for
trial, members of that office were beginning to doubt that Weaver
would appear for trial.  Sometime before February 20, defense
counsel Hofmeister told Assistant U.S. Attorney Howen that he had
been unable to contact Weaver.  Based on this information, the two
letters sent by Vicki Weaver and the information developed during
the threat assessment, Howen concluded that Weaver would not appear
for trial.<p>   Despite the indications that Weaver would not appear for
trial, Howen told Byerly that they needed to continue preparing for
trial.  As a cautionary measure, Howen instructed Byerly to be in
court on February 19, the original trial date, in case Weaver
appeared.[FN117] Byerly was present in court on February 19, but
Weaver did not appear.  Howen insisted that he had no knowledge of
the Richins letter at the time or when he appeared in court the
following day.[FN118]<p>
     On February 20, Howen and defense counsel Hofmeister appeared
before U.S. District Court Judge Harold L. Ryan.  At that time,
Hofmeister told the court that he had been unable to contact
Weaver.[FN119}  Hofmeister then detailed the efforts that he had taken
to communicate with Weaver.  In addition, Hofmeister said that on
the weekend before trial his answering service had received no
calls from Weaver and that none of the letters he had sent to
Weaver -- all of which had been sent by regular mail -- had been
returned.[FN120]  Howen told the court that it was his understanding
that Weaver had not kept in contact with Pretrial Services as
required.  He requested that a bench warrant be issued for Weaver's
arrest, that his bond be revoked, and that he be taken into
custody.[FN121]<p>   Judge Ryan, after determining that the presence specialist
had no information about whether Weaver had contacted pretrial
services, ordered that a bench warrant be issued for Weaver because
he had failed to appear for trial.[FN122] According to Judge Ryan, it
was routine practice for him to issue a bench warrant 
whenever a defendant failed to appear for trial.[FN123]  At
that time the Weaver matter had no notoriety and was "just another
case" to him.[FN124]<p>
<H4>d.   Discovery of the Richins Letter and the
Response of the Government</H4><p>On February 26, 1991, Ken Keller, a reporter from the
Kootenai
Valley Times in Bonners Ferry, Idaho, telephoned the U.S. Probation
Office and asked Duty Officer Manning whether Weaver had not
appeared for trial on February 20 because Richins had sent a letter
to him stating that the trial date was March 20.  Thereafter,
Manning apprised Terrence Hummel, the Chief Probation Officer, of
the inquiry.  When Hummel retrieved the Richins letter, he
discovered that it did, indeed, erroneously refer to the trial date
as being on March 20.[FN125]<p> Hummel promptly contacted Jim Martin, Judge Ryan's law
clerk,
and told him of the error in the Richins letter.[FN126]  Thereafter,
they contacted Chief Deputy Marshal Ronald Evans and notified him
of the mistake.  Evans told them that the Marshals Service "did not
intend to execute the warrant until possibly March 16" and would
agree to defer execution until March 23.[FN127]  Martin told Hummel
that he would inform Judge Ryan of the mistake and determine if he
wanted to withdraw the bench warrant.[FN128]<p>
     In addition to notifying the court and the Marshals Service,
Hummel also informed U.S. Attorney Ellsworth of the Richins letter
and sent him a copy.[FN129]  During that conversation, Hummel 
suggested that Ellsworth not present the failure to appear
charge to the grand jury until April.  He characterized Ellsworth
as being noncommittal regarding this proposal.[FN130] Later that 
day, Hummel telephoned Hofmeister and informed him of the Richins
letter.[FN131]  In a confirming letter to Hofmeister, Hummel stated
that he had notified Judge Ryan and the USAO of the error and that
he had recommended that the warrant not be executed until after
March 20.[FN132]<p>
     Following these discussions, Hummel returned the initial call
from reporter Keller.  In a memorandum to the file, Hummel wrote
that he told Keller that he did not know if Weaver had received the
Richins letter and that he had not indicated "one way or another
whether or not Mr. Richins had, in fact, sent that letter."[FN133]
On February 28, Keller wrote in an article that Hummel had 
disclaimed knowledge of the Richins letter.[FN134]  Hummel insisted
to investigators that he never denied the existence of the letter 
but explained that he was cautious about his statements because of 
the constraints imposed by the Bail Reform Act regarding the 
pretrial disclosure of information.[FN135]<p>
     When Judge Ryan returned to his chambers on February 27,
Martin briefed him about the Richins letter.  Judge Ryan believed
that the arrest warrant should not be withdrawn since Hofmeister
had been informed of the change and had attempted to tell
Weaver.[FN136] Thereafter, Martin informed Evans that Judge Ryan 
did not wish to withdraw the bench warrant. According to Evans, 
Martin stated that Judge Ryan made this decision after reasoning 
that Weaver had been told that the trial date was February 19 and
that Richins was without authority to change the trial date. 
Martin also told Evans that Judge Ryan wanted the Marshals Service
to bring Weaver before him during the week of March 11, since after
that time he would be unable to hear the case until late May 1991. 
[FN137]<p>   Sometime around February 27, Michael Johnson, the U.S. Marshal
for the District of Idaho, asked Hummel to send another letter to
Weaver informing him of the trial date error and the bench warrant
and asking him to contact the pretrial services officer
immediately.[FN138] However, Richins testified that no steps were 
ever taken to inform Weaver of the mistakes in the letter.<p> On February 28, Evens met
with Ellsworth, Howen and Mays to
discuss the failure of Weaver to appear for trial, the Richins
letter[FN140] and the possibility of presenting an indictment to 
the grand jury.[FN141]  According to Ellsworth, Evans was
concerned about the impact of the Richins letter and questioned
Ellsworth about how the Marshals Service should proceed.  After
this discussion, Ellsworth replied, "let's go ahead and return the
failure to appear indictment.  And if Mr. Weaver appears on March
the 20th, we may to [sic] have to dismiss it."[FN142]  Ellsworth
advised Evans that Weaver was obligated to appear on February 20
since his counsel had received the court notice with the proper
date.[FN143]<p> Hunt testified at trial that the Richins letter created "a
potential here for some reasonable misunderstanding."[FN144] Hunt
explained that if Weaver had appeared on March 20, they had
contemplated that dismissal of the indictment was possible.[FN145] 
According to Mays, in light of the Richins letter, the position of
the Marshal Service was that the bench warrant and the
indictment "would be dropped" if Weaver appeared on March 20.
[FN146]<p> Because of the Richins letter, the Marshals Service decided to
wait until after March 20 to effect the warrant.[FN147] In the
interim, the Marshals Service continued to gather information about
Weaver, in part to determine if contact could be made with him.
[FN148] On March 4, Hofmeister informed Evans that despite numerous 
phone calls and letters, Weaver still had not contacted him.[FN149] 
Since Weaver was not communicating with his own counsel, the 
marshals concluded that a friend of the Weavers might be more 
successful in conveying a message to them. The marshals identified 
Bill and Judy Grider as candidates for this role. The Griders lived 
in a cabin near the Weavers and were known to share philosophical 
views similar to those held by the Weavers.[FN150]<p>   On March 5, Hunt and Mays met
with the Griders and informed
them that they had an arrest warrant for Weaver.  Bill Grider told
the marshals that Weaver believed that he was being persecuted and
would be treated unfairly if he submitted to the system.  At that
point, Judy Grider stated that Weaver had received a letter from
the court telling him that he did not have to appear until March
20.  The marshals asked the Griders to inform Weaver that they did
not want a confrontation and that he should surrender to 
authorities.  The Griders agreed to convey the message and to 
report Weaver's response.[FN151]<p> Hunt and Mays met with the Griders the next day.  At
that
time, Bill Grider gave the marshals a letter from Weaver, which he
said contained Weaver's response to the surrender request.  The
letter, dated March 5, 1991, was addressed to the "Servants of the
Queen of Babylon" and was signed by all five Weavers -- Randy,
Vicki, Sara, Samuel and Rachel.  It stated in part:<p>
We, the Weaver family, have been shown by our
Savior and King, Yahshua the Messiah of Saxon
Israel, that we are to stay separated on this
mountain and not leave.  We will obey our
lawgiver and King.<p>
You see, the Mighty One of Heaven knows his
people.  You are servants of lawlessness and
you enforce lawlessness.  You are on the side
of the One World Beastly Government.  Repent
for the Kingdom (government) of Yahweh is near
at hand.  Choose this day whom you will serve. 
As for me and my house -- we will serve Yah-
Yahshua, the King.<p>Whether we live or whether we die, we will not
obey your lawless government.[FN152]<p> According to Bill Grider, Weaver stated that, if
he dies, "he
is going home and the kids want to go with him."  When Hunt asked
Grider what would happen if he went to Weaver's cabin to arrest
him, Grider responded that Weaver had warned that "if a man enters
my property with a gun to do me harm, you can bet that I'm going to
shoot him to protect myself."[FN153]<p>   Evans interpreted this letter as "some type of
possible
suicide pact by the [Weaver] family"154 but cautioned that it was
important that they "not read too much or too little into the
letter in its present context."[FN155] Hunt and Mays, in a Threat
Source Profile, opined that Weaver might be deliberately seeking a
confrontation with what he considered to be a "corrupt and evil
government."  They referred to several reports on file at the
Boundary County Sheriff's Office that indicated that Weaver had
fired weapons at others because of trespassing or other alleged
property disputes.  In addition, the Profile noted that, "Weaver is
armed most of the time . . .  Sources have stated all family
members carry side arms and keep other weapons located in strategic
positions in the house and out buildings."  The Profile stated that
records indicated that Weaver had purchased four handguns, six
rifles, and two shotguns.[FN156]<p> Hunt approached the Griders again on March 8 and
requested
that they ask Weaver how they could avoid a confrontation.  In
addition, Hunt requested the Griders to ask Weaver to allow the
children to leave so that they would not become involved in the
dispute.  On March 11, Bill Grider called Hunt and said that Weaver
identified conditions that would have to be fulfilled in order to
resolve the controversy.  First, Weaver wanted BATF to admit that
they had behaved improperly, that they had made a mistake and that
the government was after him.  Second, Weaver wanted BATF to return
the pistol that they had allegedly "stole" from him at the time of
the arrest.  Next, Weaver wanted a written apology from Sheriff
Whittaker who had called him "paranoid" in court.  Finally, Weaver
told Grider to tell authorities that if his children could not live
in peace on the mountain then they did not want to live.[FN157]<p>  The last statement
troubled Hunt and caused him to wonder if
Randy and Vicki Weaver might use their children as "the first
line of defense."[FN158] Evans concluded that a combination of
tactical and nontactical approaches should be considered to
apprehend Weaver.  Evans noted that a tactical approach was viewed
as the easiest to accomplish but that "it also offer[ed] the
greatest possibility of innocent casualties."  He suggested several
options including attempting discussions with Weaver by a
negotiation team comprised of a Marshals Service negotiator,
Hofmeister and Richins, or using other intermediaries, such as the
parents of Vicki Weaver, through whom to negotiate with the
Weavers.  However, in making these suggestions, Evans noted that
there were "strong indications that Weaver now mistrusts
[Hofmeister] and Richins due to conflicting information in letters
received by Weaver."  Evans also cautioned that there was "the
probability that Weaver will open fire on any law enforcement
officer or agent or ZOG ("Zionist Organized Government") once they
are identified.[FN159]<p> According to U.S. Marshal Michael Johnson, sometime during the
week of March 11, Judge Ryan had a conversation with Evans
regarding the apprehension of Weaver.  At that time, Judge Ryan
reminded Evans and Johnson that they need to arrest Weaver and "get
him in his courtroom."[FN160]<p>
<H4>e.   Decision to Present an Indictment to the Grand Jury</H4><p>  U.S. Attorney
Ellsworth authorized Howen to present the
failure to appear indictment to the grand jury, with the
understanding that if Weaver appeared for trial on March 20 they
"would possibly have to dismiss the indictment."[FN161]  Ellsworth
explained that dismissal would be necessary under those
circumstances, "[b]ecause the fact that he showed up would at least
create reasonable doubt in my mind and possibly in a juror's mind
as to whether or not the erroneous letter had been a basis 
for him not showing up February 20th, but showing up on March
20th."[FN162]<p> Although Howen was unable to recall the specifics of the
discussions in which he participated regarding the impact of the
Richins letter, he did recall that it was their conclusion that
Weaver never intended to appear for trial on February 19 or 20, nor
would he appear for trial on March 20.  In reaching this
conclusion, they reasoned that Weaver had been specifically
informed a number of times that the trial date was February 19 and
that he had the responsibility of maintaining contact with the
probation officer and his attorney.  Despite these instructions,
Weaver failed to comply.  Moreover, Howen thought the Queen of
Babylon letters evinced an intent by Weaver to remain secluded in
his home and not appear for trial.[FN163]<p>    The USAO made no efforts to contact
Weaver or his counsel to
discuss the Richins letter or Weaver's failure to appear.  Howen
believed that such efforts were best left to the Probation
Department and the Marshals Service.  Howen thought that they had
contacted Hofmeister and inquired whether he could persuade Weaver
to talk to him and surrender.[FN164] In addition, he recalled 
hearing that Marshal Johnson had asked Hummel to write a letter 
to Weaver explaining the mistake in the letter.[FN165]  Ellsworth 
had no discussions with the Probation Department or with the 
Marshals Service about sending a letter to Weaver informing him 
of the error.[FN166]<p>   With regard to the decision to present an indictment to the
grand jury, Howen stated that even when a bench warrant is
outstanding for a failure to appear, it is his policy to obtain an
indictment for the charge because the judge could withdraw the
bench warrant.  Howen believed that an indictment and arrest
warrant would give him more control over the matter and protect the
agents executing the warrant from civil liability.[FN167] Although
Ellsworth recalled that the Marshals Service wanted an
indictment, he could not remember the specific reasons for this
position.[FN168] However, Ellsworth conceded that, with the bench
warrant, the marshals did not need an indictment to have
jurisdiction over Weaver for his failure to appear.[FN169]<p>
     Howen and Ellsworth planned to obtain a sealed indictment from
the grand jury during their session in the second week of March and
to instruct the marshals not to execute the arrest warrant until
after March 20.  If Weaver appeared for trial on March 20, both
Howen and Ellsworth were prepared to dismiss the indictment
provided Weaver had a good faith explanation as to why he had not
appeared earlier.[FN170] Howen could not recall why, with the bench
warrant outstanding, he presented the indictment on March 14
instead of waiting until the April session of the grand jury.  He
speculated that it could have been because of a scheduling conflict
that he may have had in April although he reiterated that he was
convinced that Weaver had intentionally failed to appear for trial,
a failure unrelated to the error in the Richins letter.[FN171] 
Ellsworth acknowledged that they had discussed waiting until April
1991 to present the indictment but decided not to wait since they
thought the evidence indicated that Weaver had no intention to
appear for trial on March 20.[FN172]<p><H4>f.   March 14, 1991 Indictment for Failure to

          <H3>3. Discussion</H3><p>   <H4>a. Government Knowledge of Erroneous Richins
Letter Prior to February 20, 1991</H4><p>
     This investigation has found no evidence that anyone in the
government, including the USAO, was aware of the error in the
February 7 Richins letter until February 26, 1991, when the news
reporter first contacted the U.S. Probation Office.  None of the
individuals questioned indicated or suggested that such knowledge
existed prior to that time.  Nor was any other evidence obtained
from which such knowledge could be inferred.  Although Howen
instructed Byerly to monitor the courtroom on February 19, it
appears that this action was unrelated to any knowledge by Howen of
the Richins letter but rather was a precautionary measure taken by
Howen after receiving indications that Weaver might not appear for
trial.  Thus, at the earliest, government officials learned of the
error six days after Judge Ryan had issued the bench warrant on
February 20, 1991.  Consequently, we find no factual basis for the
allegation that the existence of the Richins letter was concealed
from the court on February 20, 1991.<p><H4>b.   Appropriateness of Government Response
to the Richins Letter</H4><p>     Four governmental agencies were involved in the
Richins letter
issue:  the federal district court, which issued the bench warrant
for Weavers failure to appear; the federal probation office, which
wrote the erroneous letter; the U.S. Marshals Service, which was
responsible for apprehending Weaver on the bench warrant; and the
U.S. Attorney's Office, which was responsible for prosecuting the
firearms charges and for deciding whether an indictment should be
presented for the failure to appear charge.<p>     After being informed of the mistake
in the Richins letter,
there was a flurry of activity by each of these entities.  Phone
conversations were initiated, meetings were conducted and memoranda
were written.  The evidence indicates that the immediate reaction
of almost all involved was that the letter was significant,
although differences of opinion existed as to the impact of the
letter and what, if any, actions should be taken.<p>     With regard to the role of
Judge Ryan, we believe that he took
and unnecessarily rigid view of the impact of the Richins letter. 
his initial reaction to the effect of the letter was that it did
not excuse Weaver from appearing for trial.  He seemed to base his
decision on two factors.  First, Weaver had been explicitly
informed several times of the trial date yet had failed to appear
for trial.  Second, defense counsel had made numerous attempts to
contact Weaver, including to inform him of the correct change in
the trial date, but Weaver had failed to respond.  Although 
we agree that these facts provided sufficient ground upon which 
to issue the bench warrant for the failure to appear, we believe 
that the Richins letter made necessary a serious reassessment 
as to whether some corrective action should have been taken.<p>   We find it was not
unreasonable for Weaver to assume that the
Probation Office was a government agency acting on behalf of the
court and authorized to inform him of the trial schedule.  It is
unrealistic to expect the average citizen to be versed in the
division of responsibilities within the judicial system.  We
believe that the preferable approach would have been for the
probation officer to send a corrected letter or, perhaps to have
the court clerk issue a notice acknowledging the miscommunication
and informing Weaver of the correct trial date.<p> With regard to the conduct of the
Probation Office, it was its
mistake that created this problem.  our investigation produced no
evidence that this error was anything but an unintentional mistake
by Richins.  Nor did we find any indication that Hummel
intentionally denied to the reporter that the erroneous letter had
been sent.  Rather, it is our conclusion that the caution of Hummel
to avoid improperly disclosing confidential information may have
caused him to couch his response in such a manner that the reporter
interpreted the response as a denial.[FN178]  However, we have
difficulty understanding why the office did not send a letter to
Weaver explaining the mistake.  Although U.S. Marshal Johnson
requested Hummel to send such a letter, Hummel did not honor this
request.<p>
     The Marshals Service, in our view, was placed in the middle of
this controversy.  It immediately recognized the letter as a
significant matter that had a potential impact on the viability of
the bench warrant and contacted the other governmental agencies
involved and attempted to determine how best to proceed.  The
initial reaction of Chief Deputy Marshal Evans was to defer
execution of the warrant.  Marshal Johnson also wanted the
probation officer to send a letter correcting the mistake.  When
they consulted with the U.S. Attorney about how to proceed,
Ellsworth advised them that they should withhold any tactical
service of the bench warrant until after March 20, the trial date
erroneously referenced in the Richins letter.<p>
     From the evidence presented during the investigation, it
appears that the Marshals Service sought guidance from both the
court and the U.S. Attorney's Office.  The reaction of the court
was to do nothing to correct the letter since in its view Weaver
was clearly obligated to appear.  The position of the USAO was
somewhat inconsistent.  On one hand, it argued that all indications
were that Weaver was not going to appear for trial and that the
mistake in the letter had not caused Weaver to form this intent nor
would a correction cause him to appear.  In its view, a corrected
letter would not result in Weaver's appearance.  However, on the
other hand, the USAO indicated that if it obtained an indictment
before March 20, 1991 and if Weaver appeared on or before March 20
it either "would" or "possibly would" move to dismiss the
indictment.  We think that this somewhat inconsistent position
evinces the realization that the letter might provide an
explanation for Weaver's failure to appear.<p>   It appears that although the USAO was
consulted they never
took control of the issue or urged the sending of a letter to
Weaver identifying the error.  Such a posture was neither prudent
nor advisable.  The justification given for their inaction seemed
to be that they believed that all indications were that Weaver was
not going to appear for trial.  They maintained that Weaver had
clearly been instructed about the trial date and his obligation to
comply with all the conditions of his release.  Moreover, they
argued that Weaver's counsel, despite numerous attempts, had been
unsuccessful in his efforts to contact his client.  In addition,
Vicki Weaver, presumably with Randy Weaver's knowledge and
approval, had written and mailed two letters before the Richins
letter was sent which evidenced an intent not to appear. 
Furthermore, the Marshals Service investigation indicated that
Weaver had antigovernment views and distrusted the government. 
Finally, in response to the marshal's note requesting surrender,
Weaver sent a letter that stated that his family would"not obey
your lawless government."<p>     If these facts had existed without the presence of the
Richins
letter, we would concur with the conclusion of the USAO that Weaver
would probably not appear for trial.  However, the facts did not
exist in a vacuum.  Even Ellsworth recognized the importance of the
letter when he instructed the marshals not to participate in any
tactical attempts to execute the warrant until March 20.  If
Ellsworth thought that the letter was without legal effect, this
instruction would have been unnecessary. Similarly, both Ellsworth
and Howen recognized that if an indictment were obtained, it might
"possibly" have to be dismissed if Weaver appeared for trial on or
before March 20.  Their recognition that Weaver's possible
confusion about the trial date might lead to a dismissal
demonstrates that the Richins letter warranted a more active
response by the government.<p>   Furthermore, the fact that Weaver was known to have an
intense
distrust of government might also cause one to conclude that the
letter might have intensified his distrust and contributed 
to his reluctance to appear for trial.  It is clear from 
Weaver's comments to the Griders that he received the Richins
letter.  These comments, which were relayed to the marshals,
indicated that Weaver was suspicious of what he viewed as
inconsistent messages from the government and his own counsel, and
that this inconsistency enforced his belief that the government was
conspiring against him.<p>  We recognize that we have the benefit of more information
than
was available in 1991, and have had greater time to assess how the
government should have responded.  However, irrespective of the
advantage of hindsight, we are troubled by the rigidity of the
government's approach and the lack of leadership exhibited by the
USAO on this issue.  Although we do not believe that the response
of the government to this letter was illegal or violated Weaver's
constitutional rights, we do not understand the reasons for the
USAO not taking control of this issue and coordinating a unified
governmental response.  Indeed, it was incumbent upon the USAO to
have the Probation Office send an appropriate correction and to
have attempted to discuss the matter with the court.  Such action
would have taken little effort and would have eliminated any
question as to whether Weaver was confused.<p><H4>c.  Propriety of Seeking an Indictment
on March 14, 1991</H4><p>     Despite the existence of an outstanding bench warrant, the
USAO decided to present an indictment to the grand jury charging
Weaver with failure to appear.  Howen decided to present the
indictment on March 14, 1991, six days before the erroneous trial
date stated in the Richins letter, because the grand jury only sat
once a month.  For reasons previously discussed, the USAO was
convinced that Weaver was not going to appear.<p>
     As to why the USAO wanted an indictment, Howen explained that
an indictment gave him more control and protected the marshals
executing the warrant from civil liability if the court were to
withdraw the bench warrant without their knowledge.  Howen could
not recall what, if any, reasons existed for not delaying the
presentment of the indictment until the April session of the grand
jury.  This investigation found no indication that either the
Marshals Service or the court applied any pressure directly or
indirectly to the USAO as to when or whether to seek an indictment.<p>
     We are troubled by the decision of the USAO to seek an
indictment before March 20.  Its words and actions demonstrate that
it had some concern, or at lease question, about the impact of the
Richins letter on the failure to appear charge.  We are not
persuaded by the reasons that the USAO articulated for seeking the
indictment when they did.  At the time that it sought the
indictment, a bench warrant was outstanding.  The USAO had
never received any indication that the court would withdraw the
warrant.  To the contrary, the court was firmly resolved that the
bench warrant was appropriate and should be executed.  Furthermore,
if Weaver had been arrested on the bench warrant, it is certain
that he would not have been released.  This would have enabled the
USAO to present an indictment to the next grand jury without there
being any concern that Weaver would flee.  Seeking an indictment at
the time that the USAO did created an appearance of governmental
overreaching.<p>

          <H3>4. Conclusion</H3><p>     There is no evidence that members of the USAO,
the federal
probation office and Marshals Service intentionally concealed the
erroneous Richins letter from the court on February 20, 1991. 
However, we conclude that the USAO, the probation office and the
court should have appreciated the potential impact of the letter
and should have pursued simple and straight forward steps to remedy
the error.  The decision to seek an indictment prior to the March
20 date state in the letter was unnecessary and created an
impression of prosecutorial overreaching.    [G.J.]<p>                       Released

land that the IRS had seized as a result of tax liens.  Without the
permission of the Raus, the Weavers assisted the Griders in moving
into a cabin on this property.  Thereafter, the Raus were forced to
obtain a court order to evict the Griders from the cabin.  See

Weaver "would rather die along with her family in their cabin than
subject herself and her family to the law enforcement agencies . .. .  [T]hat would
include committing suicide instead of
surrendering."  FD-302 Interview of Michael Weland, August 25,

be resolved peacefully.  Report of Investigation by Evans, April

<H3>IV. SPECIFIC ISSUES INVESTIGATED</H3><p>
<H3>C.Efforts by the Marshals Service to Effect the Arrest of Weaver</H3><p><H3>1. 
Introduction</H3><p>
     It has been suggested that the shooting deaths of Marshal
Degan and Sammy Weaver on August 21, 1992 were the result of a
scheme by the Marshals Service to assault the Weaver property, or
at the least, the result of inadequate planning.  This inquiry
examined the scope of the Marshals Service investigation between
February 1991 and August 1992 and examined the options the marshals
considered to effect the arrest of Weaver.<p>  <H3>2.  Statement of Facts</H3><p>
<H4>a.   Involvement of the Marshals Service Special
Operations Group</H4><p>    On March 18, 1991, Ronald Evans requested the assistance of
the Marshals Service Special Operations Group ("SOG").183]  SOG 
is a voluntary unit in the Marshals Service specifically trained to
handle dangerous or complex matters, such as hostage situations
involving fugitives.[FN184] Evans compared the Weaver situation to 
the violence surrounding the attempted arrest of Gordon Kahl when 
Evans was Chief Deputy of the North Dakota District.[FN185]  He 
added that many days/nights of surveillance would be necessary to 
determine the Weavers' daily routine and asked for SOG assistance 
in determining how to arrest Weaver "while minimizing risk to all 
persons involved. . . . Ultimately, we must find a single 
weakness which will cause Randy Weaver to leave the house if 
only momentarily."[FN186]<p>
     On March 23, 1991, Evans briefed SOG Commander John Haynes,
Deputy Commander Louis E. Stagg, and other SOG personnel.[FN187] At
that time, Stagg asked Evans about the pressure he was under to
apprehend Weaver, and Evans replied that a "very senior Judge" was
not going to tolerate delay in capturing Weaver.[FN188]  It was
tentatively agreed that an SOG reconnaissance team would travel to
Idaho in mid-June to gather information for a plan to arrest
Weaver.  Haynes directed that Stagg lead the mission.[FN189]<p>SOG also retained the
services of Dr. Walter F. Stenning,
Ph.D., a psychologist, to construct a psychological profile of
Randy Weaver.  Dr Stenning concluded:<p>In my best professional judgement, Mr. Randall
(sic) would be an extreme threat to any police
officer's attempt to arrest (sic) him. 
Further, Mr. Randall (sic) has indoctrated
(sic) his family into a belief system that the
end of the world is near and that his family
must fight the fences (sic) for evil that want
to take over the world.  I believe his family
may fight to the death.  If Mr. Randall (sic)
is captured by your force, I feel the
remaining members of the family will use all
force necessary including deadly force to
regain Mr. Randall's (sic) freedom.  Also, all
evidence indicates that the Randalls' (sic)
home and surrounding property is defensively
fortified to repel assault.  In summary, my
best professional judgement is that Mr.
Randall (sic) and family will resist and have
the means to resist all but a military type
assault.  Further, even with a military type
assault the family will fight, possibly to the
death.  It seems most effective to wait until
Mr. Randall (sic) leaves his house and is
alone to make the arrest on the Federal
warrant.[FN190]<p><H4>b.   SOG Reconnaissance and Recommendations</H4><p>Between June 17
and 24, 1991, the SOG reconnaissance team
assessed the Weaver case in Idaho.  SOG Deputy Commander Staff was
accompanied by Deputy Marshals Cody Thorpe and Larry Ely.  They
reviewed the files of the local marshals and met BATF agents,
Forest Service representatives, the local sheriff, and others. 
BATF Agents Byerly and Kelly told them that "Weaver and his entire
family will react violently to any attempt by the USMS to arrest
Weaver and that Vicki Weaver and the children should be considered
just as dangerous as Weaver."  Kelly also reported that Weaver had
plans to remove himself and his family to caves in the mountain.
[FN191] Byerly speculated that Weaver might leave the property to 
attend the upcoming Aryan World Congress.[FN192]<p> Sheriff Whittaker told the SOG
reconnaissance team that he
thought Weaver feared that the government would take his property
through forfeiture of the bail bond and might kill his family in an
assault to arrest him.  In addition, Whittaker also told Staff that
Weaver had threatened his neighbors, the Raus.[FN193]  Whittaker,
however, did not "completely share the assessment of other (law
enforcement) agencies that Weaver is completely beyond rational
reasoning and will fight to the death."[FN194]<p>
     Stagg briefed Marshal Johnson and U.S. Attorney Ellsworth
about his findings.  He recommended against a tactical assault on
the Weaver compound because of possible injury to the marshals and
the women and children.  Instead, it was his recommendation that
the indictment be dismissed and then refiled later under seal. 
Staff also cautioned that an attack must be forceful to eliminate
the risk of Weaver escaping into the woods, where he would pose
more of a threat.[FN195] Thereafter, Stagg requested an opportunity 
to present his findings to Chief Judge Ryan but Ellsworth refused 
the request.[FN196]  Stagg told Hunt that this "was the worse 
(sic) situation he had seen in 23 years."[FN197]<p>
     The SOG team set forth its findings in a Law Enforcement
Operations Order, which portrayed the situation as exceedingly
difficult and Weaver as "extremely dangerous and suicidal."  The
team concluded that:<p>
Weaver has been preparing for five months
[since his arrest by BATF] for his war or
confrontation with law enforcement and it is
very likely that he has established numerous
fortifications and defensive positions on his
property.  It is also possible that Weaver has
placed booby traps and/or command detonated
explosive devices on routes of approach or
concealment.<p> The report set forth a proposal to arrest Weaver with "a
minimal risk of loss of life" and "minimum force necessary to
effect arrest."  The proposed plan contemplated use of
reconnaissance teams to determine whether Weaver could be arrested
away from his residence, wife and children.  If that were not
feasible, the team would gather intelligence necessary to implement
a "tactical movement" with armored vehicles.[FN198]<p> Following the submission of the
report, SOG took no additional
action until Evans again requested SOG's assistance in effecting
Weaver's arrest.  On September 25, 1991, Evans wrote:<p><BLOCKQUOTE>
Patience and negotiations have not been
rewarded in the instant matter.  We have
communicated with the Weaver family through 
his family, friends, and his attorney.  We
have provided him with multiple opportunities
to surrender to this office, the local
sheriff, or to his court appointed counsel. . . . 
One option remains and should be exercised
quickly.  We still need to verify Weaver's
existence on the property and test his
dedication.  In testing the latter, it must be
done with a careful balance to limit and
minimize risk to law enforcement, the Weaver
family members, and to Randall Weaver. 
Without experimentation, we are stymied and
without answers. . . . While time may have
initially been on our side, it has now turned
against us.  We are within thirty days from
being locked out of the area by climatic
factors.  If we avoid this opportunity, it
will be May, to June, 1992 before any course
of action can be initiated.  I seriously doubt
the court will reasonably wait until 1992 for
the initial endeavor to serve the warrant.</BLOCKQUOTE>[FN199]<p> Evans then asked that
a team of SOG members be dispatched to
the Weaver property to contact Randy Weaver.  He envisioned their
role as follows:<p>
They will be instructed to arrest Weaver
without injury to themselves or any other
person.  If they determine that this cannot be
accomplished without life threatening
circumstances, they will be instructed to
leave the immediate area without delay. ...[FN200]<p> On September 28, 1991, a seven man
SOG detail was dispatched
to assist in arresting Weaver.  However, upon arrival, the team
concluded that "the information upon which the SOG move order was
issued was inaccurate," and the plan to arrest Weaver was
cancelled.[FN201]<p> Thereafter, the team gathered additional information and
learned that Vicki Weaver was pregnant and close to delivery.  In
addition, the team reported that Weaver was still on the mountain
and that the situation was as dangerous as before.  It also
concluded that "it [was] very likely that any attempt to arrest
Weaver at his property will result in an armed gun battle and
subsequent loss of life."[FN202]<p> On July 9, 1991, Deputy U.S. Marshal Cluff and
Everett
Hofmeister, Weaver's appointed counsel, told Rodney Willey, a
Weaver associate, that if Weaver surrendered, the failure to appear
charge might be dismissed.[FN203]  They also told Willey that the
sentence on the weapons offense would be minimal because Weaver did
not have a criminal record.  On July 10, Willey informed Hofmeister
that Weaver would not surrender because "[his] rights will be
violated."[FN204]<p>In late September 1991, Hunt and Ely interviewed Beverly and
Ed Torrence, who owned land adjacent to the Weaver property.  The
Torrences explained that they had encountered the Weavers a few
days earlier when they had gone up to view their property.  At that
time, the Torrences drove near the Weaver house and stopped to ask
about some property markers.  The Weaver dogs came to their car,
followed by Sammy Weaver, who called to the house.  The Torrences
then saw Randy Weaver and "Dennis" looking down on them from a rock
outcropping.[FN205] Each held a rifle or shotgun.  Thereafter, the
Torrences were invited into the Weaver cabin where Randy and Vicki
Weaver explained their religious and political views.<p> Randy Weaver told the Torrences
that the Aryans are the true
chosen people of Yahweh and that the Jews are impersonators.[FN206]
He claimed that a federal informant had introduced him to the Aryan
Nations.  Weaver also discussed the BATF arrest and that he was
expecting federal agents to come to his home, but that he was not
going to be arrested by anyone.  According to Weaver, he and his
family would shoot federal law enforcement officials who came on
his property.  "If they do take me, I'll take some with me," and
that is "[w]hy we have the guns."  Beverly Torrence observed that
Weaver appeared "vehement in his belief that he would rather fight
than go peaceable (sic)."[FN207]<p> During this period, the marshals also received
information
that Weaver might attend the America's Promise Ministry, a
suspected Aryan Nations church, in Sandpoint, Idaho.  The Marshals
Service began surveillance of the church, but Weaver was not
seen.[FN208]<p> <H4>d.   Exchange of Surrender Terms</H4><p>  On October 9, 1991, Deputy
Marshal Mays interviewed Alan
Jeppeson, who had been observed bringing supplies and mail to the
Weaver cabin.[FN209]  Mays asked Jeppeson to convey another 
negotiation offer to the Weavers. A series of exchanges followed. On
October 12, 1991, Jeppeson gave Mays a letter from the Weavers which
stated:<p>The U.S. Government lied to me - why should I
believe anything its servants have to say . . . .  
This situation was set up by a lying
government informant whom your lawless courts
will honor.  Your lawless One World Beast
courts are doomed.  I have appealed to
Yahweh's court of Supreme Justice.  We will 
stay here separated from you & your lawless 
evil in obedience to Yahshua the Messiah.[FN210]<p>Jeppeson told Hunt that Weaver did
not want to be tried in
Idaho "due to prejudice against those who believed in separation of
the white race."[FN211] According to Jeppeson, Weaver might 
surrender, if the trial could be moved and if Jeppeson could 
remain with Weaver until he was released or sentenced.[FN212]<p>Thereafter, the Marshals
Service began to formulate a
surrender offer.  This offer included promises that: the government
would not interfere with Vicki Weaver's custody of her children;
[FN213] the Marshals Service would not harass Randy Weaver's 
family; and the Government would not move to forfeit Randy Weaver's
property.[FN214]  <p>   The following day, Jeppeson delivered a letter from Vicki
Weaver, addressed to Mays and Hunt, that posed a number of
questions, including:<p>1.   Why a government informant or agent cannot be
cross-examined by a defense attorney?<p>2.   Why did the U.S. Dist. Judge in Coeur
D'Alene
tell [the Weavers] that if [they] lost [their]
case [they] would lose the $10,000 bond to pay
the attorney?[FN215]<p>3.   Why is there a concerted effort to 'set up'
for prison or murder all ex-green berets
(Special Forces).  My husband is an ex-green
beret.  We know there are those already in
prison from 'set ups.'  They all went to court
expecting justice from the courts of the
country they loved.  They didn't receive any! <p>
(Emphasis in original.)  Jeppeson told the marshals that he thought
that Weaver would agree to meet Hunt.<p>
     On October 16, 1991, Evans and Hunt gave Jeppeson a letter to
give to Randy Weaver that responded to the questions Vicki Weaver
had raised.  Later that same day, Jeppeson gave Hunt a brief
response signed by Vicki Weaver, which declared "[t]here is nothing
to discuss.  [Randy] doesn't have to prove he is innocent.  Nor
refute your slander."[FN216]<p> <H4>e.   Post-Negotiation Investigation</H4><p>  In
October 1991, Hunt and Evans drafted a letter to Weaver,
for Marshal Johnson's signature, containing proposed surrender
terms.  They sent the letter to the USAO for review.[FN217] 
Assistant U.S. Attorney Howen rejected the proposal on October 
15, 1992 and explained in a subsequent letter that:<p>[I] cannot authorize further
negotiations or
discussions along this line with defendant or
his agent for two reasons.  First, since the
defendant is represented by Everett C.
Hofmeister, appointed counsel, all contact
with the defendant must be through his lawyer
and not by ex parte means.  Department of
Justice policy and the Cannons (sic) of Ethics
prohibit direct or indirect contact with a
defendant who is represented by counsel for
any negotiation purpose.  Second, the . . .
areas of proposed negotiation are either not
within my power to grant or bind the
government, to (sic) broad in their scope, or
are the type of matters properly addressed in
a plea agreement in exchange for guilty
pleas, but not mere surrender.[FN218]<p>As a result of Howen's directive, the Marshals
Service did not send
the proposed letter.<p>Following the termination of negotiations, Hunt continued to
gather information.  He determined that Weaver had "set an
approximate 100 yard perimeter around his house" that gave him
"high ground coverage of 360 degrees."  Hunt described Weaver's
routine:<p>
 Weaver's tactics appear to be that he and
[Kevin] Harris will cover any intruders [on
the property] from a distance until they are
identified....In most cases Weaver will
send his son or Harris to investigate a
situation while Weaver covers them.  Weaver
also has a very aggressive dog that will warn
them if someone is approaching.[FN219]<p> There was very little activity by the marshals
on the Weaver
matter through the winter months because the property was snowed
in, and surveillance was not practical.[FN220]  However, they 
continued to receive information about who was visiting the 
Weaver property.<p>On March 1, 1992, the <I>Spokesman Review,</I> a newspaper in nearby
Spokane, Washington, reported that Weaver's children were armed and
quoted area residents who predicted violence if law enforcement
agents attempted to apprehend Weaver.  Allan Jeppeson was quoted as
saying, "They'll lose their lives if they go up there and threaten
Weaver" and "he don't want nobody on his mountain."[FN221]<p> On March 4, 1992, Cluff
and Evans traveled to the Rau house to
obtain an update on Weaver's activities and to check on the status
of a telephone being installed there at the Marshal Service's
expense.  Once there, Cluff and Evans decided to drive up the
mountain road leading to the Weaver cabin.[FN222]  They were in 
plain clothes and rode in an unmarked four-wheel drive vehicle.  
As they proceeded up the mountain road, the marshals found that 
vehicle noise on the unmaintained road was clearly audible for great
distances.  When they reached the top of the road, by the entrance
to the Weaver property, they saw signs reading, "White Power is
Supreme" and "Bow Down to Yahweh."<p>Cluff and Evans then saw Randy Weaver, armed with a
rifle, and
a boy and a girl standing above them on a rock formation.  The boy
also had a rifle.  A yellow dog ran up to the vehicle, 
barking.[FN223] When Weaver told them they were trespassing, they 
responded that they were interested in buying property. Weaver told
them to return with a realtor.  Cluff and Evans left.[FN224]<p> Thereafter, Evans
determined that additional reconnaissance
was necessary.  He had learned of previously unknown trails to the
Weaver property and believed it was necessary to explore them.<p> <H4>f.   Briefing of
the Marshals Service Director</H4><p>  A meeting was held on March 27, 1992 at Marshals
Service
Headquarters to brief Acting Director Henry Hudson and other
officials, including Duke Smith, Associate Director for Operations,
Tony Perez, Chief of the Enforcement Division, Inspectors Arthur
Roderick and William Hufnagel of the Enforcement Division, Deputy
Marshals John Haynes and Lou Staff of SOG, and Marshal Johnson.<p> At the meeting,
Haynes and Stagg presented a plan for an
assault on the Weaver compound, but recommended against taking such
action.  Hudson agreed that a tactical approach did not appear
viable because of their concern for the safety of Vicki Weaver and
her children.[FN225]<p>
     As an alternative, Hudson telephoned U.S. Attorney Ellsworth
and asked him to consider dismissing the warrant against Weaver and
reissuing it under seal.  Hudson thought this would relieved the
pressure to arrest Weaver and might cause Weaver to believe it was
safe to come off the mountain.  Hudson explained to Ellsworth that
Weaver could then be arrested without launching an assault on the
compound and risking injury to the children and to government
personnel.<p> Ellsworth told Hudson that he thought it would be unethical to
dismiss the indictment and then reindict Weaver in secret.[FN226] 
Assistant U.S. Attorney Howen said they could not dismiss the
indictment because Judge Ryan was calling for Weaver's arrest.
[FN227] In response, Hudson offered to travel to Boise to meet 
Judge Ryan, but his offer was not accepted.[FN228]<p> Unable to resolve the matter in
this fashion, Hudson ordered
that any plan adopted should avoid potential harm to Vicki Weaver
and the Weaver children.  He believed that a "ruse" arrest would be
ore likely to achieve this goal than an "operational" 
strategy.[FN229]<p>Thereafter, the Weaver case was transferred to the Enforcement
Division and was given the name "Operation Northern Exposure."  The
primary responsibility for developing a plan was given to Deputy
Marshal Arthur Roderick, Branch Chief of the Enforcement
Division.[FN230]<p><H4>g.   Development of Three Phase Operational Plan</H4><p> After
considerable discussion with the Idaho District and
Headquarters, Roderick and Hufnagel devised a three phase plan for
arresting Weaver.  Under Phase I, a team of marshals would assess
the feasibility of technical surveillance of the Weaver cabin and
property.[FN231] This would necessitate inspection of the Weaver
property to determine the surveillance equipment that could be
used.[FN232] A team comprised of Roderick, Hufnagel, and Deputy U.S.
Marshals Mark Jurgenson, Ron Libby, and Dave Hunt, was assembled to
carry out Phase I.[FN233]<p> (1)  Phase I<p> At the beginning of Phase I, Roderick
rented a condominium on
Schweitzer Mountain, approximately 25 miles from the Weaver
property which was to serve as a command post.  The team also spent
several days conducting surveillance of the Weaver house from the
north and west ridges and looking for sites on which to 
mount surveillance cameras.  During this process, they observed the
Weavers responding to certain noises by running with rifles to a
rock ledge that overlooked the driveway.[FN234]<p> On one occasion during Phase I,
Roderick nearly had an
encounter with Kevin Harris.  While Roderick was in the woods near
the north ridge observation post, he saw Harris ride nearby on a
motorcycle and past the unmarked marshal's truck.  When Roderick
returned to the truck the tires on the truck were flat.[FN235]<p> (2) Phase II<p>On
April 13, 1992, Roderick and Hufnagel briefed Acting
Director Hudson on the results of Phase I of the plan to arrest
Weaver.[FN236] While Hudson was shown photographs of the area,
Hufnagel described the locations of surveillance cameras, which
would provide information about the Weavers' daily routine. 
Information obtained from the surveillance cameras during Phase II
was expected to assist the Marshals Service in developing options
for Phase III of the plan, which was the arrest of Weaver.[FN237] 
In addition, Hudson was informed that the assistance of
five additional marshals was needed for Phase II.[FN238]  Acting
Director Hudson approved Phase II on or about April 13, 1992.  The
Phase II Plan noted that Kevin Harris was now living in the Weaver
cabin.  Harris was described as "an ardent supporter of Weaver's
[who] thinks of [Weaver] as his father."[FN239]<p> On April 18, the marshals installed
surveillance cameras on
the west ridge and, on April 22, they installed the cameras on the
north ridge.  Soon thereafter the cameras became operational after
a number of technical problems had to be solved.[FN240] The marshals
had to make several trips to the camera sites, often in darkness,
to bring the heavy batteries needed to power the cameras.[FN241]<p>During Phase II, the
team also made three trips onto the
Weaver property to survey the terrain because little was known
about the land surrounding the Weaver cabin.  Each trip began
before daybreak and the marshals used night vision equipment.[FN242]
Although aerial photographs portrayed the land as flat, it 
was actually heavily wooded and frequently steep and
rugged.<p> The closest that the marshals got to the cabin was during the
third trip in the first week of May.  While it was still dark,
Roderick, Hunt and Libby took the "East Trail," which ended behind
the Weaver cabin.  They then passed some water tanks a few yards
from the cabin and worked their way down to the spring house by the
lower garden.  This was the first time any marshal had circled the
Weaver house and viewed the surrounding grounds.  While they were
in the lower garden area, Libby spotted a small dog, who was
"yapping", but who stopped when the marshals took cover.[FN243]<p>   During this period,
Buster Kittel, a private citizen, went to
the mountain to survey property he had recently purchased.  To
reach his property, he had to drive past the Weaver cabin.  As he
reached the Weaver driveway, Kittel heard a shot from a small
caliber gun and saw Sammy Weaver standing above him with a rifle on
a rock outcropping.  Randy then joined Sammy, holding a pistol and
a rifle.  Weaver asked Kittel if he was a federal marshal and
directed Kittel's girlfriend to get out of the truck.  Weaver told
Kittel that he did not believe that Kittel had bought property and
told him to come back with proof.  The next day Kittel returned
with some paperwork, which he showed to Vicki Weaver.  The Weavers
then allowed Kittel to proceed to his property.[FN244]<p>Video tapes produced from the
surveillance cameras during
Phase II were sent to Headquarters which had directed the cameras
to continue to be operated.  Because the batteries were running
low, the marshals decided to replace them with solar panels, which
were installed on May 1 and 2.  Kevin Harris apparently heard the
marshals working on the north ridge and was seen looking up at the
area.  A few days later the camera on the north ridge stopped
transmitting.  Upon investigation, Roderick and two other marshals
discovered that the camera equipment had been stolen.[FN245]<p>
     On April 13, 1992, the Marshals Service was informed that a
crew from "Now It Can Be Told," a television program hosted by
Geraldo Rivera, may have been shot at while flying over the Weaver
property in a helicopter.[FN246]  Two weeks later, Randy and Vicki
Weaver were interviewed on May 2, 1992 by Michael Weland, a local
newspaper reporter.  Vicki said that the mountain had been given to
them by "Yahweh" and that "We will not leave our mountain."[FN247]
Weland also quoted Vicki as saying that her family feared that
Randy would "be railroaded through the court and once he was gone
[the government] would have come it, kicked us off the property and
torn this place apart."  Randy Weaver was quoted in the same
article as stating that: "Right now, the only thing they can take
away from us is our life.  Even if we die, we win.  We'll die
believing in Yahweh."[FN248]<p>(3)  Transition to Phase III<p>After Phase II of the
operation had been completed, Roderick
and Hufnagel developed two alternative plans for capturing Weaver,
one "lethal," the other "non-lethal."  Both proposals involved
teams of marshals surrounding the cabin and forcing Weaver outside. 
The plans differed in that, under the "lethal" plan, the teams
would be armed while under the "non-lethal" plan, they would use
rubber bullets and other passive strategies, such as cutting off
the water supply to the cabin.[FN249]<p>Acting Director Hudson was briefed on the
options for Phase
III.[FN250] Deputy Attorney General George Terwilliger, who happened
to be present at Headquarters, also attended the meeting.  When
Hudson asked what the marshals would do if the Weaver children
fired at them, Roderick responded that they would defend
themselves.  Terwilliger found this "unacceptable."[FN251] Hudson
rejected both the "lethal" and the "non-lethal" plans out of fear
for the children's safety.[FN252]<p>Thereafter, Roderick developed an undercover plan to
arrest
Weaver, which required two marshals to assume the roles of husband
and wife and to purchase a plot of land north of the Weaver
property.  To provide security for the marshals, the land purchase
would have legitimate paperwork.  In addition, the undercover
marshals would clear the property to create the impression that
they were authentic purchasers.  Five two-man teams would accompany
the undercover marshals to the mountain on each visit and provide
cover from the woods.[FN253]  The plan assumed that Weaver would become
accustomed to the undercover marshals, leading to an opportunity to
arrest him out of the presence of the other family members.  The
marshals believed that it might take up to a year to secure
Weaver's arrest.[FN254]<p>Although final approval was needed from Acting Director
Hudson, Roderick was given permission by Jim Roach, Deputy Director
for Operations, in late May 1992, to begin preparations for the
undercover operation.  Roderick chose Deputy Marshal Mark Jurgensen
of the Seattle office for the undercover role.  Roderick,
Jurgensen, and Hunt started assembling documents necessary to carry
out the ruse.[FN255]<p> <H4>h. Delay in Implementing the Undercover
Operation</H4><p>Roderick was instructed not to put the undercover plan into
effect while Hudson's confirmation was pending before the U.S.
Senate.[FN256] In early August 1992, Hudson was confirmed Director 
of the Marshals Service and gave oral approval of the undercover
operation shortly thereafter.[FN257]  Because there had been no
surveillance of the Weaver property since May, Roderick thought it
necessary for a team to visit the site and update their
information.[FN258]<p><H3>3.  Discussion</H3><p>A number of allegations has been raised
about the conduct of
the Marshals Service between February 1991 and August 1992.  We
examine in this section these allegations.<p><H4>a.   The Initial Response of the
Marshals Service to Weaver's Failure to Appear</H4><p> Before the failure to appear
indictment was returned, Judge
Ryan issued a bench warrant and directed the Marshals Service to
arrest Weaver.  Judge Ryan declined to withdraw the warrant when he
learned that the Probation Office had sent Weaver a letter with an
incorrect trial date.  After the indictment was returned,
Ellsworth rebuffed Hudson's request to dismiss the indictment and
return it under seal.<p>We appreciate the problem the Marshals Service faced.  It
could not ignore the Court's order or the indictment and, thus, had
no choice but to take steps to apprehend Weaver to face the pending
charges.  Indeed, Former Director Hudson has explained that the
Marshals Service has no independent role in evaluating charges when
it is called upon to apprehend a fugitive.[FN259] In addition, this
investigation has found that simply leaving Weaver on the mountain,
despite its facial appeal, was not an option available to the
Marshals Service once charges had been instituted.[FN260] Moreover,
the marshals had a legitimate concern that the Weavers were
harassing their neighbors, the Raus.  Indeed, by August 1992, it
was feared that if Weaver were allowed to remain at large, there
would be an incident in which the Raus, or other innocent problems,
might be harmed.[FN261]<p>Notwithstanding the need to apprehend Weaver, it appears at
initial glance that the resources the marshals committed to the
case were disproportionate to the relatively insignificant
underlying charge.[FN262] However, at the same time, we recognize
that no one, including Randy Weaver, is entitled to ignore the rule
of law.  Thus, all factors considered, we acknowledge that the
Marshals Service had no option but to respond.<p>Because the Marshals Service had no
option but to pursue
Weaver's arrest and because that arrest posed possible injury to
law enforcement and to the Weavers, it was incumbent on other law
enforcement agencies and the court to assist the Marshals Service
in resolving the impasse.  As we note below, the Marshals Service
received little practical assistance from the U.S. Attorney's
Office which also hindered communications with the court.  We are
troubled that no agency or individual took action in response to
the concerns of the Marshals Service.<p>
<H4>b.   Considerations by Marshals Service of
Alternatives to Secure the Arrest of Weaver</H4><p> The Marshals Service employed many
different options for
securing Weaver's arrest before settling on a plan in May 1992. 
The record is replete with discussions of proposals made by
different components of the Marshals Service.  Its approach was
extraordinarily cautious.<p> Common to each strategy the Service considered was a
concern
for the safety of the Weaver children and the arresting marshals. 
For this reason, a tactical approach, that is, an armed raid on the
residence, was considered unrealistic by Idaho marshals as early as
March 1991.  The Special Operations Group reached the same
conclusion in June 1991 and again in September 1991 after reviewing
a psychological profile of Weaver and conducting its own
investigation in Northern Idaho.[FN263] In March 1992, Director 
Hudson ruled out any "tactical" or "operational" strategy that did 
not eliminate the possibility of harm to Vicki Weaver or her 
children. Hudson even rejected a "non-lethal" tactical plan, which
contemplated the use of rubber bullets, because it involved an
assault on the cabin and, therefore, posed a potential danger to
the children.[FN264]<p> The problem of "innocent casualties" arose out of a mass of
evidence that Weaver and his family were armed and determined not
to submit to authorities without a fight.  For example, BATF
informed the marshals that Weaver had resisted its "ruse" arrest in
December 1990, had attempted to grab a weapon during the arrest,
and had declared that he would not be tricked again.  BATF had also
reported that Weaver and his family were armed "at all times" and
could present a danger to arresting officers.  Additional
information collected by BATF suggested that Weaver thought the end
of the world was approaching and that he was prepared for a final
battle on his property.  Weaver's military record revealed that he
may have received demolition training, and the marshals feared that
he had established fortifications and defensive positions on his
property.[FN265]  Weaver also had written to the Boundary County
Sheriff that he would not leave his cabin and that law enforcement
agents would have to take him out.[FN266]  The "Queen of Babylon"
letter sent to U.S. Attorney Ellsworth had quoted a "Declaration of
War" by a white supremacist who had died in a violent confrontation
with law enforcement officers.  Frank Kumnick, the leader of a
local Aryan Nations church and a friend of Randy Weaver, had told
Mays that Weaver spoke of having a violent confrontation with the
law since 1984 and that Vicki and Randy Weaver had "ideas of
martyrdom."[FN267] In addition, there were reports that the Weaver
children were well trained in the use of firearms and would protect
their father if an arrest were attempted on the property.[FN268] 
Surveillance showed that the Weavers responded to the noise of
approaching vehicles by running with rifles to a rock ledge.[FN269]
Various intermediaries had reported that Weaver repeatedly said
that he would not leave his property and that he would shoot
intruders if he thought it necessary to protect his family. 
Finally, the Weavers signed a letter stating that the Weaver
children would not leave the mountain.[FN270]<p>This list illustrates the data the
Marshals Service had
collected and is by no means exhaustive.  We found no
countervailing evidence that Weaver would surrender peacefully. 
Accordingly, we believe that the wariness of the Marshals Service
was justified.<p> In addition, we believe that the caution of the Marshals
Service also stemmed from its experience with Gordon Kahl, the head
of Posse Comitatus.  When the Marshals Service attempted to arrest
Kahl in 1983, a firefight erupted in which two marshals were killed
and Kahl and his son were wounded.[FN271] Chief Deputy Ron Evans was
Chief Deputy of the North Dakota District when the Kahl incident
occurred and compared the Weaver matter to the Kahl case.[FN272]<p> In view of the
disadvantages attending a "tactical" approach,
the marshals began to explore "non-tactical" alternatives.  In
March 1991, Evans discussed sending a negotiator to the Weaver
cabin under a "white flag."  However, the approach was abandoned
because it was believed that Weaver would "fire on any law
enforcement officer or agent of [the Zionist Organized
Government]."[FN273]<p>Both the Special Operations Group and Director Hudson asked
U.S. Attorney Ellsworth to dismiss the indictment against Weaver
and to re-issue it under seal to reduce the pressure to arrest
Weaver and to trick him into leaving his property so that he could
be arrested without risk to the children.  Ellsworth and Howen
refused Hudson's request.[FN274]<p>  The marshals also pursued information that Weaver
might leave
his property to attend a suspected Aryan Nations church.  The
marshals began surveillance of the church but Weaver did not
appear.[FN275]<p>  Beginning in October 1991, Mays and Evans initiated a series
of communications with Randy Weaver through various intermediaries,
such as the Jeppesons, Griders, and Vicki's parents, the Jordisons. 
The marshals and Weaver also exchanged surrender terms. However,
Assistant U.S. Attorney Howen ended these discussions in October
1992, directing that all communication with Weaver be through his
counsel.<p>  The "non-tactical" arrest plan that Director Hudson finally
approved in the Summer of 1992 was passive almost in the extreme. 
Indeed, the marshals were willing to wait up to a year for an
undercover marshal to gain Weaver's trust.  Under this plan,
"cover" teams of marshals would arrest Weaver only if he could be
taken into custody without harm to his family.[FN276]<p> We do not believe that the
Marshals Service acted
precipitously or unreasonably in developing its plan to arrest
Weaver.  The Marshals Service examined many alternatives in
devising its course of action.  Some options were foreclosed by
other agencies; others were thought to be too dangerous.  The
Marshals Service eventually decided to pursue a non-tactical arrest
which posed the least threat of physical violence.  However, the
Marshals Service recognized that with any plan that it considered,
a potential risk of violence existed considering Weaver's threats
to resist arrest violently.<p><H4>c. Pressure Exerted on Marshals Service to Arrest
Weaver</H4><p> This investigation also examined whether the manner in which
the Marshals Service treated the charges against Weaver was
affected by improper, external influences.<p>
(1) The Court<p>Judge Ryan issued a bench warrant for Weaver's arrest
following his failure to appear for trial.  When he learned a week
later that Pretrial Services had sent Weaver a letter bearing an
incorrect trial date, Judge Ryan declined to withdraw the warrant. 
Judge Ryan, who characterized Weaver as "just another case," told
this investigation that he was satisfied that Weaver knew of the
February 20 trial date.  According to Judge Ryan, it was routine
for him to issue a bench warrant when defendants did not appear for
trial.[FN277]<p>Judge Ryan denies pressuring the Marshals Service to arrest
Weaver.  He explained that he already had a full caseload and "was
in no hurry to get Weaver arrested."  In fact, Judge Ryan said that
he thought scarce judicial resources were being wasted on the large
number of gun cases brought in federal court and, in particular, he
complained about undercover "sting" cases involving firearms. 
Judge Ryan recalled a few casual conversations with Evans about the
Weaver case and once spoke "in jest to Evans [about] when was he
going to get his job done," in reference to executing the Weaver
bench warrant.  However, he claimed that he did not urge anybody
"to hurry up and get Weaver before the court."[FN278]<p>Deputy Marshals Hunt and Evans
do not believe that the Court
exerted undue pressure on the Service,[FN279] and we have found 
little or no evidence to the contrary.<p>
(2)  The Media<p> The marshals were sensitive to public opinion about the Weaver
case.  Several marshals were concerned about the public perception
of the marshals and Weaver in Northern Idaho.  In October 1991,
Hunt wrote:<p>
 Weaver is losing support locally from his
friends and associates.  They believe he is
becoming very paranoid and suspects everyone
is informing on him.  The USMS is receiving
growing support in the way that we have
handled this situation.  The community seems
to be impressed with the USMS not over
reacting and their concerns for the safety of
all involved.  An approach of even handiness
(sic) and concern has began (sic) to impress
even hard core Aryan types.[FN280]<p> In March 1992, an article appeared in the
Spokesman Review, a
newspaper in nearby Spokane, Washington, marking the one-year
anniversary of the bench warrant.  The Chicago Tribune published a
similar article on the same day, which described Weaver as a "folk
hero" holding the Marshals Service at bay.[FN281]  According to 
Evans, "pressure from USMS headquarters to effect the arrest of 
Weaver increased substantially after these two articles."[FN282] He 
did not believe, however, that Headquarters compelled the marshals 
to take actions that placed the Weavers or the marshals in undue 
danger, and this investigation has uncovered no evidence to the
contrary.[FN283]  Indeed, this regard for local sentiment does not 
seem to have had a significant impact on the marshals' handling of 
the case.  If anything, it made them more leery of proceeding
precipitously.<p>(3)  The U.S. Attorney's Office<p>The USAO, in particular U.S. Attorney
Ellsworth and Assistant
U.S. Attorney Howen, played a large role in shaping the Marshals
Service's approach to arresting Weaver.  However, Ellsworth and
Howen did little, if anything, to facilitate the marshals'
assignment.  To the contrary, in more than one instance, they made
decisions or took actions that made the marshals' task more
difficult.<p> (i)  Halting Negotiations<p> In October 1991, Mays and Evans began a
series of
communications with Weaver through intermediaries and exchanged
terms of surrender with him.  Howen directed the marshals to
discontinue contact with Weaver because he was represented by
counsel, thus, effectively foreclosing communication.  Although we
are not convinced that these negotiations would have been
successful if pursued, we find that Howen's decision was erroneous
and unduly hampered the marshals' efforts.<p>Howen's statement that contacts with a
represented person are
prohibited are accurate but incomplete.  For example, Disciplinary
Rule 7-104(A)(1) of the ABA Model Code of Professional
Responsibility and its successor, Rule 4.2 of the ABA Model Rules
of Professional Conduct, provide that an attorney shall not
communicate with a party represented by counsel, unless the
attorney has the consent of counsel or is "authorized by law."
[FN284] The disciplinary rules have long recognized exceptions to 
the general prohibition against contacts with represented persons such
as to determine if the person is in fact represented by counsel or
when counsel has been given prior notice of the communication and
consents.[FN285]<p>Howen overlooked these exceptions to the general rule and, in
effect, terminated negotiations with Weaver.  It was apparent by
the Autumn of 1991 that Weaver was not cooperating with his
appointed counsel who nine months earlier had told Judge Ryan
that he was unsuccessful in contacting Weaver.[FN286]  Prior to this
time Hofmeister had continued to try to assist the marshals in
apprehending Weaver.  In July 1991, he met with them and Rodney
Willey, an associate of Weaver, in an effort to spur negotiations. 
On July 10, 1991, Hofmeister wrote Weaver and explained that the
firearms charge was relatively minor and that he thought Weaver had
a good defense to the charge.  Hofmeister added, "the 'cause' in
which you believe does not justify the damage you do to yourselves,  
because the offense Randy is charged with is not much greater than
many traffic offenses.[FN287]<p>Hofmeister reported to the marshals that soon after
sending
this letter he received two letters from Vicki Weaver, in which she
state that they were resolute as it was "Yashua's plan" that they
live or die on the mountain.[FN288] Hofmeister also contacted 
Richard Butler, leader of a local Aryan Nations Church, and 
requested that Butler write a note to Randy Weaver asking Weaver 
to come down from the mountain and face the weapons charge.<p>[G.J.]  [FN289]<p>
Notwithstanding these efforts, Weaver still would not talk to
Hofmeister, and Hofmeister eventually refused to visit Weaver
unless he had an armed escort.[FN290]  Weaver even said that he 
would not surrender to Hofmeister because "[his] rights will be
violated."[FN291]  Despite these clear indications that Weaver did
not want Hofmeister's services, Howen adopted a rigid approach to
the issue and considered Hofmeister to be Weaver's counsel until he
was relieved by the court in September 1992 after Weaver's
surrender.  Furthermore, Howen never spoke with Hofmeister about
the matter or explored whether Hofmeister would consent to the
contact by the Marshals Service.[FN292]<p>  Howen was apparently unwilling to explore
alternatives that
might have led to discussions with Weaver.  For instance, he could
have instructed the marshals to ask Hofmeister's permission to
communicate directly with Weaver.  This is not to say that
additional exchanges would have been fruitful.[FN293]  However, 
given the gravity of the situation, options that might have 
promoted a dialogue should not have been disregarded.  Howen was 
aware of the difficulties the Marshals Service faced in capturing 
Weaver, but, in the face of this evidence, her remained hostile 
to the negotiation option.  His rigid response to the Marshals 
Service's proposal was deceptively incomplete and effectively 
frustrated the Marshals Service's efforts.[FN294]<p> Finally, Howen's statement that
some of the surrender terms
proposed by Hunt and Evans were more appropriate for inclusion in
a plea agreement appears disingenuous.  There is no evidence that
Howen ever discussed devising such an agreement with Weaver's
attorney or with anyone else.  Indeed, the evidence is to the
contrary since Howen told this investigation that it was not his
practice to engage in plea bargaining.[FN295]<p>(ii)  Other Actions<p>In June 1991, U.S.
Attorney Ellsworth discouraged Deputy
Director Stagg of the Marshals Services SOG from apprising Judge
Ryan of the considerable danger his team faced in arresting Weaver. 
In March 1992, Director Hudson asked Ellsworth to consider
dismissing the warrant against Weaver and reissuing it under seal. 
Hudson explained that the marshals thought an
assault on the Weaver residence would pose unacceptable risk of
injury to the Weaver children and Marshals Service personnel. 
Ellsworth and Howen refused to discuss the indictment, citing Judge
Ryan's call for the arrest of Weaver.  When Hudson offered to speak
to Judge Ryan, Ellsworth did not respond to the offer.  We are
troubled that the prosecutors so lightly dismissed the offer by the
Director of the Marshals Service to speak with Judge Ryan.  Indeed,
we question their judgment in rebuffing the Director's personal
effort to break the year-long impasse.  Neither Ellsworth nor Howen
advised Judge Ryan of the Marshals Service's concerns.  Such
inaction on their part was neither reasonable nor well considered
under the circumstances.<p><H4>d.  Impact of Delay Pending Hudson
Confirmation</H4><p>The plan to apprehend Weaver was delayed for three months
pending the confirmation of Henry Hudson as the Marshals Service
Director.  The reconnaissance team expressed frustration over the
delay [FN296] because some believed the delay caused a gap in 
their surveillance intelligence.<p>However, the pending confirmation did not appear to
be the
only reason for the August reconnaissance mission.  Indeed,
Roderick and Cooper believed that additional surveillance was
necessary to find locations for "cover" teams for the undercover
operation.[FN297] The Executive Operational Plan also suggested that
surveillance was necessary to place cover teams, an essential
component of the undercover plan.  Furthermore, Hudson told this
inquiry that his approval of the undercover plan was "contingent on
the results of the latest surveillance," which was the August 1991
trip to the mountain.[FN298]<p> Consequently, we conclude that the delay occasioned by
Hudson's confirmation did not cause the need for additional
surveillance but rather, at the most, altered the timing of
surveillance that would have been necessary to conduct in any
event.<p>
 <H3>4. Conclusion</H3><p> The Marshals Service is required by statute to execute arrest
warrants.  Consequently, once a warrant was issued for Randy
Weaver's arrest, the Marshals Service had no choice but to
undertake efforts to apprehend Weaver.  Faced with Weaver's
repeated threats to violently resist arrest, the Marshals Service
explored many alternative plans designed to capture Weaver, but to
do so without harming Weaver, his family or the arresting officers. 
We believe that the Marshals Service acted properly and with due
caution in pursuing this purpose.  Moreover, we found no evidence
that the Marshals Service was pressured by outside entities or was
improperly motivated in its efforts.  We find, however, that the
court and the U.S. Attorney's Office did not appreciate the
difficulties facing the Marshals Service, and made no effort to
assist the Marshals Service in devising a peaceful solution to the
problem.<p><hr><p>   Released through<p>  COUNSEL CONNECT<p>

     206 Torrence Interview, at 23.<p>
     207 Weaver also said that Terry Kinnison, Sam Strongblood
Woholi, and others were conspiring to kill him so that Kinnison
could take his property.  Id. at 26.  FD-302 Interview of Beverly
Torrence, December 22, 1993.<p> 208 USMS Item Activity Report, October 10, 12 & 13,

Hunt learned from the FBI that Weaver had only limited involvement
with the Aryan Nations.  Report of Investigation by Hunt, October
8, 1991, at 1.<p>
     209 Various people were believed to be taking supplies to the
Weavers, including the Griders, the Jeppesons, and Vicki Weaver's
parents, the Jordisons.  Report of Investigation by Hunt, October
10, 1991; Report by Mays, October 12, 1991; Torrence Interview, at

     210 This note was unsigned, but all correspondence (unless
otherwise identified) was in Vicki Weaver's handwriting.<p>
     211 In an October 11, 1991 letter to her cousin, Ronald
Jordison, Vicki Weaver wrote, "Race mixing is against the law."

     212 Memo from Hunt to Evans, October 12, 1991, at 1; Report of
Investigation by Mays, October 12, 1991, at 3.<p>
     213 Evans learned of this concern during a conversation with
Vicki Weaver's father, David Jordison.  Jordison told Evans that
during a visit with the Weavers in early April, "Randy and Vicki
voiced concern for becoming separated during the legal process and
expressed commitment to remain together no matter what the
Government did.  This commitment was expressed to include the
children."  Report of investigation by Evans, April 24, 1991, at 3;
Memo from Ronald Evans to Duke Smith, Tony Perez, John Haynes and
Lou Stagg, May 7, 1991, at 2.  In July 1991, Hofmeister sent a
letter to the Weavers assuring them that the children would not be
taken from Vicki, provided she did not use violence against anyone. 
Letter from Everett D. Hofmeister, to Mr. & Mrs. Randy Weaver, July
10, 1991, at 1.<p>
     214 Memo from Hunt to Evans, October 12, 1991.  Jordison told
Evans that Randy and Vicki believed that Randy had "signed a bond
which would allow the Government to take his land and he therefore
was not going to leave his property."  Report of Investigation by
Evans, April 24, 1991, at 2.<p>
     215 Magistrate Judge Ayers had explained to Weaver that he
would forfeit the property bond only if he failed to appear for
trial.  Arraignment Transcript, January 18, 1991, at 10-11. 
Weaver's attorney, Hofmeister, also explained to Weaver that the
bond would be forfeited only if Weaver failed to appear in court. 
Letter from Everett D. Hofmeister, Esq. to Mr. & Mrs. Randy Weaver,
July 10, 1991, at 1.<p>
     216 Around this time, the marshals learned that Weaver
believed that the highest authority in Northern Idaho was the
county sheriff and that federal authorities had no jurisdiction
over him.  Report of Investigation by Mays, October 10, 1991, at 2
(Interview with Sam Strongblood Woholi).<p>
     217 Hunt Trial Testimony, May 5, 1993, at 2-9.<p>
     218 Letter from Howen to Evans and Hunt, October 17, 1992
(Appendix at 21).<p>
     219 Report of Investigation by Hunt, October 22, 1991, at 1-2. 
Hunt concluded that Weaver had apparently not set "booby traps."<p>  220 Memo from Evans
to Smith, March 18, 1991; FD-302 Interview
of Michael Moriarty, November 18, 1993, at 3.<p>
     221 "Feds Have Fugitive 'Under Our Nose'," Spokesman Review
(Spokane), March 1, 1992, at A1.  On the same day, an article in
the Chicago Tribune described Weaver as a "folk hero" holding the
Marshals Service at bay.  One week later, the story was picked up
by the Associated Press, and articles appeared in the New York
Times ("Marshals Know He's There But Leave Fugitive Alone," New
York Times, March 13, 1992, at A14) and the San Francisco Chronicle
("U.S. Slow to Nab White Supremacist," San Francisco Chronicle,
March 13, 1992).  On March 27, 1992, the San Francisco Examiner
reprinted the March 8, 1992 Chicago Tribune article ("Standoff With
Police Enters Second Year, San Francisco Examiner, March 27, 1992).<p>
     222 Evans described the decision to drive to the Weaver
property as spontaneous.  He said they had no intention of making
contact with the Weavers.  Evans Trial Testimony, May 3, 1993, at
35.<p>
     223 Ruth Rau told Cluff and Evans that the dog had attacked a
boy walking along a trail and that Randy Weaver had beaten the dog.

Interview of Henry Hudson, November 15, 1993, at 2.<p>
     226 FD-302 Interview of Michael Johnson, October 5, 1993, at
4.<p>
     227 Howen did not recall speaking with Hudson and said that he
was not aware that Hudson had made such a request.  Howen
Interview, Tape 3, at 25.  Hudson reported that Ellsworth deferred
the majority of the speaking to Howen.  Hudson FD-302, at 2.<p>
     228 Hudson FD-302, at 2-3.<p>
     229 Id. at 2.<p>
     230 Id.  Hudson said that it was not unusual for Marshals
Service Headquarters to assume jurisdiction over difficult cases.<p>

Roderick (draft), at 5.<p>
     232 Executive Operational Plan (Phase I), March 27, 1992, at
1; Roderick Sworn Statement (draft), at 5-6; Hufnagel Sworn
Statement, at 2.<p>
     233 Hufnagel Sworn Statement, at 2.  The "Executive
Operational Plan" (Phase I), said that Deputy Marshal Frank Norris
would conduct a medical survey for the operational plan.  Norris
told this investigation that it was common for a medic to go on an
operation in a remote mountain area.  However, Deputy Marshal Ron
Libby was sent on the mission instead of Norris.  Sworn Statement
of Frank Norris, at 2.<p>
     234 The marshals also noticed a marine band radio antenna on
the Weaver cabin.  They brought in a radio monitor to determine
whether Weaver was communicating by short wave radio.  Report of
Investigation by Roderick, April 2, 1992; Roderick Sworn Statement
(draft), at 7-11.  The plan for Phase II contemplated jamming radio
communications from or to the Weaver cabin during the arrest. 
Executive Operational Plan (Phase II), April 10, 1992, at 2
(hereinafter cited as "Phase II Plan").  Terry Kinnison told the
Secret Service in 1985 that Weaver had military radio equipment and
possibly a police scanner.  See Kinnison FD-302, January 21, 1985
and February 5, 195.<p>
     During Phase I, Roderick and the other marshals looked into
rumors that Weaver had worked for the Central Intelligence Agency
while in Vietnam as a member of the Special Forces.  They found
these rumors to be false.  Roderick Sworn Statement (draft), at 11.<p>
     235 Roderick Trial Testimony, May 10, 1993, at 243-44;
Roderick Sworn Statement (draft), at 10.  Roderick thought that
foliage made it impossible for Harris to see them.  He also thought
it was possible that the flat tires may have been caused by
something in the road he struck earlier.  Id. at 10.<p>
     236 Daily Report, April 10, 1992.<p>  237 The cameras, which operated on batteries,
would provide
"real-time" recordings of the Weaver residence and would run during
the daylight.  Phase II also contemplated the use of pen registers
on the telephones of various Weaver associates.  Phase II Plan, at
1; Report of Investigation by Roderick, April 4, 1992.<p>238 Six marshals were already
on site:  Hufnagel, Libby, Hunt,
Mays, Roderick, and Lynda Nafsinger.  Phase II Plan, at 7-8.<p>  239 Phase II Plan, at
2.<p>240 A surveillance post was set up on the Rau property to
monitor the video tapes.  The post was manned 24 hours a day. 
Daily Report, April 20, 1992.<p>
     241 Hufnagel Sworn Statement, at 4.<p> 242 During the first trip on April 27, 1992,
the marshals
reached the lower garden area below the Weaver compound.  They had
to leave, however, when their night vision equipment failed. 
Roderick Sworn Statement (draft), at 12.  On the second trip on
April 22, Roderick and Libby located a spot of the west ridge close
enough to the compound to see and hear the Weavers talking with
Buster Kittel.  They also observed someone named Murphy bringing
the Weavers supplies.  Id. at 13; Report of Investigation by Hunt,
April 22, 1992, at 1.<p>  243 Roderick Sworn Statement (draft), at 14.<p>
     244 [G.J.]<p> 245 Report of Investigation by Hunt, May 5, 1992; Hufnagel
Sworn Statement, at 5; Roderick Sworn Statement (draft), at 14-15. 
Roderick had feared that something like this might occur and had
warned Marshals Service Headquarters that they were sending the
surveillance team into the area too often.  Id.  The charred
remains of the camera equipment were found near the Weaver house
after Weaver surrendered to authorities on August 31.<p>
     246 On April 14, a film crew told the marshals that they might
fly over the Weaver property.  Daily Report, April 14, 1992.  An
assistant to the producer of "Now It Can Be Told" said that a
helicopter flew over the cabin on April 18.  FD-302 Interview of
Richard Weiss, September 11 & 18, 1992, but said in an August 1992
interview that no shots had been fired.  However, a photographer in
the helicopter saw someone gesture at the helicopter and thought he
heard two shots on a boom microphone.  FD-302 Interview of Dave
Marlin, September 16, 1992.  Weaver denied that anyone had shot at
the helicopter.  "Fugitive: No Surrender," Coeur D'Alene Press, May
3, 1992, at 1.  Mays reported seeing a helicopter near the Weaver
property, but did not hear any shots fired.  Report of
Investigation by Mays, April 18, 1992, at 1.<p>

     253 SOG would provide the cover teams because the Enforcement
Division had limited manpower and SOG had the training and
equipment for this kind of mission.  Roderick Sworn Statement
(draft), at 18.<p>    254 Roderick Sworn Statement (draft), at 17; Hufnagel Sworn
Statement, at 7.  Executive Operational Plan, May 27, 1992, at 4.<p>255 Hunt had
information that Weaver had contacts with law
enforcement officers.  Jurgensen, therefore, felt it necessary to
create a detailed history for his assumed persona, including a 
citation for a moving violation under his assumed name.  Sworn
statement of Mark Jurgensen, at 7.<p>
     Roderick believed that a member of SOG should participate in
the undercover operation and, therefore, asked Deputy Marshal  Larry
Cooper if he would be willing to take part in assessing the
undercover operation.  Roderick Sworn Statement (draft), at 18.  
Cooper had recently left the Special Operations Group, and he and
Roderick had known each other for many years.  Cooper Sworn
Statement, at 2-3.<p>
     256 Roderick Sworn Statement (draft), at 18.  Hudson had
decided that the plan would not go forward until he had been
confirmed.  Hudson FD-302, at 4.  This decision does not appear to
have been based on operational concerns.<p> 257 Roderick reported that he was in
Washington, D.C. with
Tony Perez and ran into the Director.  Hudson told Roderick "let's
go get 'em."  Roderick Sworn Statement (draft), at 18.  On August
13, 1992, Perez sent Duke Smith a handwritten note: "We're ready to
go as of Monday, August 17, 1992."<p>
     258 Roderick Sworn Statement (draft), at 18; Jurgensen Sworn
Statement, at 8-9.<p>   259 Hudson FD-302, at 3.  Roderick told this investigation "I
did not believe it was appropriate nor part of my job to pass
judgment on the merits of the [underlying] case."  Roderick Sworn
Statement (draft), at 5.  We find this assessment consistent with
the statutory duties assigned to the Marshal Service.  See 28
U.S.C.  566(a) ("It is the primary role and mission of the United
States Marshals Service to . . . obey, execute, and enforce all
orders of the United States District Courts . . . .") and  566(c)
("[T]he United States Marshals Service shall execute all lawful
writs, process and orders issued under the authority of the United
States . . . .").  Hudson and his subordinates asked Ellsworth and
Howen about the strength of the charges against Weaver and were
told that the case was good.  Hudson FD-302, at 3.<p>
     260 Sheriff Bruce Whittaker seemed to prefer this option.  He
was quoted as saying, "It's just as bad for [Weaver] sitting up
there on that mountain as if he was sitting in prison somewhere. .
. . He's on his own self-imposed house-arrest up there, and it
isn't costing anybody any money." "Feds Have Fugitive 'Under Our
Nose'" Spokesman Review (Spokane), March 1, 1992, at A1.<p>
     261 See Perez FD0392, at 5.  See also Note 315, infra.<p>
     262 We note that the Idaho District referred the case to the
marshals, in part, because it did not have the financial 
resources or manpower to carry out the operation.  See Hunt Sworn
Statement, at 13.<p>
     We have asked the FBI to determine how much the Marshals
Service spent on the Weaver case, but have not yet received the
calculation.<p>   263 See Report of Dr. Walter J. Stenning, May 13, 1991.<p>  264

confrontation.  A local sheriff was also killed in that conflict. 
"Radical Tax Protester's Legacy Lives," UPI, July 9, 1983; Untitled
article by Gordon Hanson, Associated Press, February 14, 1983.<p>
     272 Memo from Evans to Smith, March 18, 1991, at 1.  Evans FD-
302, October 21, 1993, at 4.   As a result of the Kahl case, the
Marshals Service approached investigations of armed individuals
motivated by strong personal belief "in a much more methodical and
deliberate manner."  In such cases, "[n]othing could be taken for
granted," and the marshals would not go "charging in" to make an
arrest.  Perez FD-302, at 2.<p>
     273 Memo by Evans to Perez, March 12, 1991, at 2.<p>
     274 FD-302 Interview of Michael Johnson, October 5, 1993, at
4; Hudson fd-302, at 2-3.  The marshals also considered other "non-
tactical" solutions, such as interrupting water and power supplies
to the cabin and abducting Vicki or Sara Weaver, while
they were in the "birthing shed" during their menstrual cycles.

     275 USMS Item Activity Report, October 10, 12, & 13, 1991.<p>
     276 Evans proposed a comparable plan in June 1991, in which
two undercover marshals would pose as prospective purchasers of
real estate adjacent to the Weaver property.  Notes of SOG meeting
on June 17 & 18, 1991; Stagg FD-302, October 21, 1993, at 5.  SOG
concluded that it would be impossible to provide adequate cover in
the mountainous terrain.  Id. <p> 277 FD-302 Interview of Honorable Harold Ryan,
November 9,
1993, at 1, 2.<p>
     278 Id. at 2-4.  Marshal Johnson said that, during the week of
March 11, 1001, Judge Ryan reminded [Johnson and Evans] of the need
to arrest Weaver and get him into his courtroom."  Johnson FD-302,
October 5, 1993, at 3.<p>  Ellsworth and Howen denied requests from the Special
Operations Group and Director Hudson to dismiss the Weaver
indictment for failure to appear, purportedly because Judge Ryan
wanted Weaver arrested.  Ellsworth and Howen also rebuked offers by
SOG and Hudson to meet with Judge Ryan to explain why they thought
it advisable to dismiss.  Judge Ryan told this investigation that
he was never contacted about this matter.  The only conversations 
he had about Weaver were informal talks with Evans.  Ryan FD-302,
at 6.<p>  279 Hunt Sworn Statement, at 13; Evans FD-302, at 2.<p>    280 Report of
Investigation by Hunt, October 22, 1991, at 2. 
Evans was also concerned that Weaver was attempting to gain support
in the community by having supporters circulate copies of Richins'
letter.  Memo from Evans to Perez, February 27, 1991, at 2.<p>281 One week later, the
story was picked up by the Associated
Press and articles appeared in the New York Times (March 12, 1992)
and the San Francisco Chronicle (March 13, 1992).  On March 27,
1992, the San Francisco Examiner ran the Chicago Tribune article.<p>   282 Evans FD-302,
at 3.<p>    283 Director Hudson claims that media attention "did not
change the pace of the investigation, but sharpened the concern of
the community."  Hudson FD-302, at 2.<p>
     284 This limitation includes communications made through third
parties.  See ABA Model Rule 8.4(1).<p>
     285 The Department of Justice has historically authorized
limited contacts to determine whether a person believes counsel is
representing his or her interests.  See Memorandum from Attorney
General Dick Thornburgh, "Communication with Persons Represented By
Counsel", June 9, 1989.<p>
     286  Hearing Transcript, February 20, 1991, at 2-6; Ryan FD-
302, at 1.  Hofmeister had sent four letters to Weaver's post
office box advising him of the February 20 trial date and
requesting a meeting.  Hofmeister did not receive a reply and the
letters were not returned.  Hearing Transcript, at 2-6.  Report of
Investigation by Cluff, March 5, 1991.<p>  287 Letter from Everett Hofmeister, Esq. to
Mr. & Mrs. Randy
Weaver, July 10, 1991, at 2.  This letter was found in the Weaver
cabin, with notations, during a search in September 1992.<p>

     292 Howen Interview, Tape 4, at 18-21.<p>
     293 On March 27, 1992, U.S. Marshal Johnson telephoned Alan
Jeppeson and, in apparent disregard of Howen's order, asked
Jeppeson to ask Weaver for conditions under which he would
surrender.  Jeppeson told Johnson that Weaver's response was "stay
off his mountain."  Report of Johnson, April 1, 1992.<p>294 To Johnson, it seemed that
"every time [the marshals]
attempted to take any type of action, they experienced a conflict
with the United States Attorney."  Johnson FD-302, August 17, 1993,

CONNECT<p>COUNSEL CONNECT is a communications and information service for attorneys.
Counsel Connect
is managed by American Lawyer Media, L.P.<p><hr><H3>IV. SPECIFIC ISSUES
INVESTIGATED</H3><p>
<H3>D. Marshals Service Activities Between August 17 and August 21, 1992</H3><p>  
<H3>1.  Introduction</H3><p>   The defendants' attorneys alleged in pretrial motions
that the
marshals went to the Weaver property on August 21, 1992 to engage
the Weavers and to force a violent confrontation.299]  Counsel
pointed to several facts, which, they alleged, proved that the
marshals intended "something quite in excess of a mere
'reconnaissance mission.'"  These alleged suspicious facts included
bringing a "suppressed" rifle on the mission and spending "several
hours sighting their guns" before the August 21 incident.[FN300] 
Counsel also suggested that the marshals initiated the exchange of
gunfire on August 21 and that they deliberately killed Sammy
Weaver.  Finally, there have been allegations that the marshals
exaggerated the amount of fire they received at the "Y," that they
tried to cover up the death of Sammy Weaver, and that they delayed
interviews with the FBI to enable them to coordinate their accounts
of the shootings.<p> <H3>2.  Statement of Facts</H3><p>   <H4>a.   Preparation for
Surveillance</H4><p>In August 1992, Roderick and Hufnagel assembled the team which
would conduct the surveillance necessary before the undercover plan
could be placed in effect.  This surveillance team was comprised of
Roderick, Cooper, and Deputy Marshals Thomas, Norris, and Hunt.
[FN301] In addition, Duke Smith contacted SOG Commander John Haynes 
and requested that an SOG member participate in the surveillance
preceding the undercover operation.[FN302]  Haynes selected Bill 
Degan, Commander of the Northeast Task Force in Boston and a close 
friend of Roderick and Cooper, to be the SOG representative on the
team.[FN303] Haynes instructed Degan that the purpose of the mission
was simply to gather intelligence.[FN304]<p>  As detailed in the Executive Operational
Plan, the objective
of the visit was to determine what cover was necessary for the
undercover operation and to update previous surveillance
information.  It was expected that the surveillance would take
approximately two weeks.[FN305]  There was no plan to arrest 
Weaver during these excursions.[FN306]<p>  On August 17, 1992, Degan, Cooper, Roderick,
Norris, Thomas,
and Hunt arrived in Spokane, Washington.[FN307]  Thereafter, the 
team drove to Sandpoint, Idaho, to set up a command post at the
condominium on Schweitzer Mountain that Roderick's team had used in
April.  Roderick briefed the team on Wednesday evening, August 19. 
At that time, he repeated the standing orders from Marshals Service
Headquarters that they were to avoid contact with the Weavers,
particularly the children.[FN308] In preparation for their mission,
the marshals discussed the terrain, the people believed to be on
the mountain, and the weapons the Weavers were known to have.[FN309]
They also reviewed surveillance videos, photographs, and other 
information.[FN310]  Before the meeting ended, Degan inventoried 
each marshal's ammunition.[FN311]<p>Roderick expressed concern that the longstanding
feud between
the Weavers and the Raus might be building toward a confrontation.
[FN312]  Sheriff's deputies had told that Raus that they
would not go to the Weaver cabin out of fear for their own safety. 
[FN313] For this reason and others, the Raus were becoming 
increasingly frustrated, and there was concern that Wayne Rau's 
father might try to take the law into his own hands.[FN314]<p>Roderick decided that the
team would survey the Weaver
property on Friday, August 21.  Although he was still troubled
about returning to the area too many times, he thought that Cooper,
Degan, Norris and Thomas needed to become acquainted with the
property.  Of the group, only Roderick and Hunt had been to the
Weaver property previously.  The decision to conduct the
surveillance on Friday was based in part on information which
indicated favorable night illumination and weather conditions on
that day.[FN315]<p> In preparation for the mission, the marshals had acquired
three .223 caliber M16 rifles from the Spokane office.  Roderick
believed that additional weapons were needed and mentioned the
shortage to Degan, who had access to additional weapons from a SOG
training display in Boston.  Roderick told Degan to bring some of
the rifles and other equipment with him.[FN316]  Thereafter, Degan
shipped a .223 caliber M16A2 Colt Carbine, a "sniper" rifle, a
shotgun, and a "suppressed" .9mm Nato Colt Carbine from a display
to Spokane.  In addition, the team members brought their personal
service weapons.[FN317]<p>  <H4>b.   Trip of August 21, 1992 to Weaver Property</H4><p>  
At approximately 2:30 a.m. on August 21, 1992, the team left
the condominium at Schweitzer Mountain in a van and a four wheel
drive Jeep and drove to the residence of Boundary County Sheriff
Bruce Whittaker where they left the van.  They then drove the Jeep
to the Rau residence where they arrived at approximately 4:30 a.m.
and parked the Jeep by the guest cabin.<p>  The plan was for the marshals to move under
cover of darkness
to surveillance positions and then to leave after a few hours of
surveillance.  They did not intend to complete the day's mission
before day break.[FN318]  Each marshal was equipped with radios and 
night vision equipment and wore camouflage tops, pants,
and boots.  None wore bullet-proof vests, though they were 
available.[FN319] Degan carried one of the SOG M16s; Thomas and 
Norris each had rifles; Roderick had an M16; and Cooper had the
"suppressed" .9mm.[FN320]  Hunt was carrying camera equipment, so he
elected to take only his service weapon.  They did not bring the
sniper rifle Degan had shipped from Boston.[FN321]<p>  The marshals left their Jeep and
walked up a trail which led
from the Rau house to an area known as the "Y".  At that location,
the group split into two three-man teams.  The first team, the
Observation Post ("OP") team, was comprised of Hunt, Thomas, and
Norris; the second team, the Reconnaissance ("Recon") team, was
comprised of Roderick, Cooper, and Degan.<p>The OP team left the Y and took the left
fork of the trail
through a canopy of trees and a fern field.  They then turned right
and proceeded up the hill to the north switchback road which led to
the observation post, which had been located during one of the
Phase II surveillance trips.  The observation post was
approximately 900 feet in elevation above, and one half to three
quarters of a mile from the Weaver compound, and was located at a
spot on the north ridge referred to as the "white pine 
tree."[FN322]<p>While the OP team was on its way up the mountain, Roderick led
Degan and Cooper up the trail from the Y toward the Weaver
compound.  The team stopped at the edge of a cover of trees about
250 to 300 yards from the entrance to the Weaver driveway.  From
there.  Roderick pointed out the rock outcropping where the Weavers  
responded to vehicles and other noises.[FN323]  Roderick wanted  
Degan and Cooper to see this area because the undercover marshal 
would have to drive there when approaching the Weaver compound.   
It was still dark when Cooper heard one of the dogs bark.[FN324]  
The Recon team returned to the Y as it was starting to become 
light.<p>
     By now the OP team had reached the observation post.[FN325]  
The OP team was equipped with a spotting scope, a still camera and 
an 8mm video camera.  Once in position, the OP team was to watch the
Weaver compound while Roderick, Cooper, and Degan scouted the area. 
The two teams maintained contact by radio using fire crew code 
words in case Weaver could intercept their transmissions.[FN326]<p>    Soon after its
arrival, the OP team began to observe activity
in the compound.  They saw Sammy Weaver and Kevin Harris conduct a 
security check around the house.  During the early morning hours
the dogs barked periodically which did not strike Hunt as
unusual.[FN327]  At one point, Hunt saw Randy Weaver come out of 
the house and yell at the dogs to "shut up."[FN328]  Hunt told
Thomas that the dogs' barking and the Weavers' response was normal
and that the activity in the compound appeared to be in accord with
previous surveillance.[FN329] The OP team reported these sightings to
Roderick, Cooper and Degan who stopped moving when there was
activity in the Weaver compound.[FN330]<p> Thereafter, Roderick Cooper, and Degan went
to join the other
marshals at the observation post.  However, they became lost and
had to radio Hunt for directions.  When the Recon team arrived at
the observation post at approximately 9:00 a.m., both teams
discussed their observations.  The OP team reported that members of the Weaver family
had run to the outcropping several times in
reaction to the dogs' barking.  On each occasion, the persons
running to the outcropping varied, but usually Harris and Sammy
Weaver were among them.  Norris stated that, using the spotting
scope, he had seen Harris with a long gun, Sammy with a side arm
and a long gun, Randy with a long gun, and Sara with a side arm in
a holster.[FN331]<p>The Recon team stayed at the observation post briefly and
watched the Weaver family with binoculars and spotter scopes. 
They discussed different approaches to the property and the layout
of the compound, including the various outbuildings and their
possible purposes.<p>   Roderick wanted to show Cooper and Degan a spot he had
identified in April as a good location for a "counter-sniper" for
the undercover operation.[FN332] They found a position near a birch stand on a large
rock embedded in a hill some 200 to 250 yards from the Weavers' cabin.[FN333]  Roderick
and Cooper then left Degan and crawled down to another rock approximately fifty yards
below the first rock.[FN334] This point lined up with the base of the Weaver driveway,
approximately 100 to 150 yards away.  Roderick and Cooper observed family members take
up positions at the rock  outcropping whenever the dogs barked.[FN335]  They also
observed their movement back and forth between the outhouse, the cabin, and other
outbuildings.<p> It was at this time that Roderick decided to toss some rocks to see how
the sound would carry and to see if the dogs would react.[FN336] He asked the OP team to
observe the results.[FN337] Roderick then threw the first rock.  Roderick, Cooper, and
Degan did not hear the first rock hit, and the OP team reported that there was no
reaction from the people who were insider the cabin or the dogs in the Weaver compound. 
Roderick threw a second rock and again no response occurred from the Weaver
compound.[FN338]<p>Approximately fifteen minutes later, Roderick and Cooper rejoined
Degan, and the three backtracked to the "switchback" road. 
They had spent roughly a half hour at the birch stand observation
point.  Roderick decided to show Cooper and Degan the garden/spring house area below the
house.  At that time, they were still looking for places to station cover teams for the
undercover operation.
[FN339] Cooper was concerned about being too close to the house in 
the daylight, but Roderick said that surveillance teams had been 
closer on prior missions without being detected.[FN340] Roderick 
also was hoping to limit their trips to the mountain to two 
instead of the planned four, so it was necessary to accomplish as 
much as possible during this outing.[FN341]  They agreed the 
previous night that  they would immediately leave the area if the 
dogs alerted.[FN342]<p>   Before proceeding to the garden/spring house area, Roderick
informed the OP team of his intention and asked that he be advised
of any movement in the compound as they were heading into the "hot"
area, which was the marshal's code for the land immediately
surrounding the Weaver compound.[FN343]  Thomas advised Roderick 
that "they had total containment," that is, the Weavers were in the
house.[FN344]<p>  After receiving this information, Roderick moved forward
slowly, followed by Cooper and Degan.  He indicated to Cooper and
Degan several possible cover team positions.  As they were
getting ready to leave the spring house area, Thomas radioed that
the Weavers were "responding" to an approaching vehicle.  None of
the other marshals heard a vehicle.[FN345] The dogs began to bark,
and people started to run out of the cabin.[FN346] Randy Weaver
exited first, followed by Kevin Harris, Sammy Weaver, Sara
Weaver, and Rachel Weaver.  Vicki Weaver remained in the compound
area.  Thomas told Roderick that they were carrying "equipment,"
meaning that they had firearms.[FN347]<p> Roderick expected that the Weavers would
assume their normal
defensive positions.  He Instructed Cooper and Degan to take
cover.[FN348] Roderick also took cover and radioed the observation
post for further information.[FN349] Hunt radioed Roderick and
informed him that this appeared to be "a typical vehicle
response" by the Weavers.[FN350] However, his assessment soon
changed.<p>
     Rather than taking their normal defensive positions at the
outcropping, the Weavers jogged down the driveway.  Hunt warned
Roderick,  "You've got them all coming down the drive."[FN351]
Roderick then saw a large labrador retriever running toward his
position, followed by Kevin Harris, carrying a rifle.[FN352]<p>    Randy Weaver dictated
this account of these events to his
daughter, Sara, on August 26, 1992:<p>
Approximately 11:30 Friday morning....the dogs
started barking like they always do when strangers walk
up the driveway.  Randy, Kevin, and Sam ran out to the
rock with their weapons.  Randy was carrying a double
barrel 12 gauge shotgun.  Kevin was carrying a 30-06
bolt action rifle.  Sam was carrying a 223 mini 14. 
[FN353] When they got to the rock, our yellow dog 
Striker was down at the pumphouse barking up into the 
woods. Randy, Kevin and Sam went down to investigate. Sam
said he heard something, or someone running west, so
they followed.  Sam and Kevin followed Striker.  Randy 
dropped down on the old logging road headed west.<p>I (Randy Weaver) didn't have any
idea what they
were chasing, but I was hoping it was a deer. [FN354]<p>
   Kevin Harris claimed that, from the intensity of the dog's
reaction, he thought that there was "a large animal or a person"
in the vicinity.[FN355] Vicki Weaver wrote in her journal on 
August 21, 1992:<p>Randy, Kevin and Sam go down past the pump house
to see what's bothering the dog.  He apparently
made the servant of the New World Order retreat
down Farnworth Road.  They followed the dog part
way down.[FN356]<p>    Roderick told Cooper and Degan that a dog and a man with a
rifle were running toward them and that they had to move out.[FN357]
The OP team heard Roderick say, "Pull back!" and, "the dogs are
on us."[FN358] Roderick took the lead as the marshals fled through
the woods.  The area was thickly forested, and the marshals made
a great deal of noise as they ran.[FN359] As they fled down the
mountain, the marshals stopped several times to determine whether
they were being pursued and saw that they were.<p>   During the retreat, Roderick said
that the dog might have to
be killed because it had picked up their scent.[FN360] Roderick
noted that each time he and the others turned to look, the dog
and Harris were closer to them.  As they ran through the woods,
Roderick continued asking the OP team who was coming and what
weapons they had.[FN361] The OP team radioed that "the assignment
fire chief," the code name assigned to Vicki Weaver, was walking
leisurely around the compound.[FN362]<p>  Hunt, Norris and Thomas remained at the
observation post
above the Weaver property during the pursuit.  After Randy
Weaver, Sammy Weaver, Sara Weaver, and Harris ran down the drive,
Thomas observed Rachel Weaver hurry into the cabin and exit with
a "mini 14" rifle.[FN363]<p>
     Roderick was still leading Cooper and Degan when they broke
from the woods into the fern field.  Roderick chose the fern
field because it provided the quickest retreat and allowed them
to move with the least noise.  At that time, he thought that they
could still escape.[FN364] They ran through the fern field and under
the tree canopy.  Roderick was farthest from Harris and the dog,
with Degan ten yards behind and Cooper another ten yards behind
Degan.  As Roderick turned to look back, he saw the dog, Harris,
and, for the first time in the pursuit, Sammy Weaver.[FN365]  
Cooper thought that he might have to shoot the dog
and stayed behind Roderick and Degan in case that became
necessary.[FN366]<p>
     Cooper did not see Harris until after he was through the
fern field and into the canopy of trees leading to the Y.  He
told the others that it was "bullshit" for them to continue
running and that he did not want to "run down the trail and get
shot in the back."  He urged them to take up defensive
positions.[FN367] The others agreed.  Roderick cleared the canopy
first and entered the Y.  Degan arrived at the end of the canopy
and took a position behind a stump approximately three to four
feet off the right of the trail.[FN368]<p>   <H4>C.  Shooting at the Y</H4><p>There is a
significant difference between the account of the
events at the Y given by the marshals and the account provided by
Randy Weaver and Kevin Harris.[FN369] All agree that Harris shot 
and killed Deputy Marshal Degan and that Deputy Marshal Roderick 
shot and killed the dog. Although the marshals did not realize until
several days later that Sammy Weaver had been shot during the
encounter, they agree now that he was wounded in the arm and
fatally shot in the back during the exchange of gunfire. 
However, the sequence of these events, and, in particular, the
timing of Sammy Weaver's death, remains contested, as does the
identity of the person who shot Sammy Weaver.  The events
comprising the shootout at the Y occurred very quickly, and  the
participants' perspectives often blended together and
occasionally were in conflict.  Thus, the following narrative
represents our best effort to present the most accurate
chronology of the events that occurred at the Y based on the
information provided to us during our investigation.<p> (1) Account of Cooper and
Roderick<p>When Cooper reached the "water bar" at the entrance to the
Y, he saw Randy Weaver through the brush approximately 40 feet
away coming down the other trail from the Weaver compound.  They
looked at each other, and Cooper thought Weaver seemed shocked to
see him.  At the time, Cooper assumed that Roderick and Degan
were covering Weaver and he turned his attention to Harris and
the dog, which were still behind him.  He yelled at Harris, "Back
off, U.S. Marshals," believing that they had been set up for an
ambush.[FN370]<p>  The dog caught up to Cooper, and he held it at bay with his
gun.  The dog made a 360-degree turn around Cooper, growling and
snarling.[FN371] Cooper decided not to shoot the dog, fearing that
if he did so in plain view of Harris, it would precipitate a
gunfight, with both Cooper and Degan fully exposed.  After
circling Cooper, the dog ran past him and headed towards
Roderick.  Cooper left the trail and dove behind a rock located
about fifteen feet behind Degan and to his right.  Cooper did not
see Randy Weaver again.[FN372]<p>    Roderick, who was further into the Y, also saw
Randy Weaver
on the trail leading up to the cabin.  Weaver was wearing a
camouflage jacket and screamed something unintelligible at
Roderick.  Roderick yelled, "Stop!  U.S. Marshal" at Weaver. 
Roderick could not tell if Weaver continued up the trail or went
into the woods.[FN373]<p>  Cooper radioed Degan to join him at the "fox hole," but
Degan did not respond.  He saw that Harris and Sammy were walking
directly in front of Degan.  Cooper observed Degan squatting on
the balls of his feet behind a stump and facing up the trail. 
Once Harris and Sammy were into the clearing of the Y, six to ten
feet past Degan's position, Cooper thought they had escaped
detection.  Unexpectedly, Degan went up on his left knee, with
his weapon on his shoulder and pointed at Harris and Sammy
Weaver, and said, "Stop! U.S. Marshal."  Cooper, almost
simultaneously joined Degan in saying "U.S. Marshal."  However,
before Cooper finished the command, Kevin Harris, who had his
back to Degan, wheeled around and fired at Degan with a 30.06
rifle.  Harris was holding the rifle waist-high when he 
fired.[FN374] Cooper saw Degan's arm go back as he started to 
fall.  Harris then began to bring his weapon to his shoulder as 
if he were going to fire again.  Cooper, realizing that Degan 
had been hit, fired a three-round burst at Harris with the 
"suppressed" .9mm.  According to Cooper, Harris dropped to the 
ground "like a sack of potatoes."  Cooper was convinced that 
he had hit Harris.  Cooper then wheeled his weapon toward Sammy.
He could not see whether Sammy had a gun because a tree blocked 
his view of Sammy's hands.  He did not shoot at  Sammy because 
Sammy had not fired at Degan and he did not see Sammy's weapon.  
Cooper did not think Degan had returned any fire.[FN375]<p>   Meanwhile, Roderick had
moved south down the path.  He heard
a shot from his left, from the direction he had last seen Cooper,
Degan, Harris, and Sammy.  Roderick could not determine who had
fired the shot or whether it came from a .223 or 30.06 rifle,
although he thought it sounded like a heavy caliber weapon.[FN376]
Other than the dog, which was heading toward the path where Randy
Weaver had appeared moments earlier, Roderick could not see
anyone.  When the first shot was fired, the dog stopped and
turned its head back toward the marshals.  Concerned that the dog
would attack or lead Weaver, Harris, and the others toward the
marshals if they kept running, Roderick fired once at the dog
with his M16 rifle, striking the dog near the base of the
spine.[FN377]<p>   After he shot the dog, Roderick saw Sammy Weaver enter the Y
and run up the trail, away from Roderick and toward where Randy
Weaver had disappeared.  Sammy called Roderick, "a son of a
bitch" and shot two rounds at him from a mini-14 rifle.  Roderick
dove into the woods off the south side of the trail and took
cover behind a tree.  He received "constant" fire at that
position from weapons that sounded like a shotgun, a handgun, and
a rifle.[FN378]<p> During this same period, Cooper heard two shots to his right
and Sammy Weaver yelling "You son of a bitch."  He then began
taking fire and heard Degan call "Coop, I need you."  Cooper told
Degan that he would be there "as soon as I can get 'em off our
ass."[FN379] Cooper rose and fired a second, three-round burst in
the direction from which he had last received fire in order to
provide cover fire for himself as he tried to get to Degan.[FN380]
Following these last shots, Cooper saw Sammy run out of view up
the trail to the cabin.  Cooper did not think that his shots had
hit Sammy Weaver.[FN381]<p>   When the fire shifted toward Roderick, it allowed Cooper
to
move to Degan's position.[FN382]  Degan had been hit once in the
chest.[FN383] He was lying on his left side, his arm in the rifle
sling, making a gurgling noise.  He was conscious, but unable to
assist Cooper in moving to a protected position.  Within a few
moments, Degan lost consciousness and died.  Cooper took Degan's
weapon and changed the setting from semi-automatic to safety.  He
did not fire Degan's weapon.  Cooper returned to his position
behind the rock.[FN384] He radioed to Roderick that Degan had been
hit and needed help.<p> (2)  The OP Team<p>   Norris, Thomas, and Hunt were at the
observation post
overlooking the Weaver property, while Roderick, Cooper, and
Degan were being chased through the woods.  Norris heard the
announcement, "U.S. Marshal" and then a single shot.  Two quick
shots followed from, Norris believed, a .223 caliber weapon and
then he heard a series of discharges.[FN385]<p>Thomas also heard a single shot, which he
described as a
"heavy caliber."  Thomas contrasted the fist shot to subsequent
fire, which he characterized as "lighter."  Hunt told Thomas that
he also thought the first shot sounded like a heavy caliber
weapon.  Thomas glanced at his watch when he heard the first shot
and it was approximately 10:30 a.m.[FN386]<p>   Hunt could not determine the caliber of
the weapon fired,
but said that the first shot sounded like a "long run."  Hunt
heard a single gunshot, followed by two gunshots, then four
gunshots.  He did not hear any shotgun blasts during the entire
incident.[FN387]<p> Hunt, Norris and Thomas then left the observation post to
assist the other marshals.  They ran to the Y after hearing the
shots, they heard yelling from the Weaver property.  When Hunt,
Norris, and Thomas approached the fern field and turned left into
the tree canopy, they received a volley of gun fire from their
left side.  This gunfire, described as being from different
caliber weapons, went over their heads.  Hunt pointed his service
weapon in the direction of the fire, searching for a target to 
return the fire.  Seeing none, he did not fire.  It is not known
who fired at Hunt, Norris, and Thomas.[FN388]<p> (3)  Account of Weaver and
Harris<p>Randy Weaver's account of the incident comes from a statement he
dictated to his daughter, Sara, on August 26, 1992:<p>
When I reached the first fork in the logging road, a
very well camouflaged person yelled 'freeze RANDY,' and
I immediately said 'fuck you,' and retreated toward
home 80-100 feet.  I realized [sic] immediately [sic] that
we had run smack into a ZOG/NEW WORLD ORDER ambush.  I
stopped to see if I was being followed.<p>
About that time I heard a gun shot and Striker [the
dog] yelped.  Then I heard two more shots and Striker
stopped yelping.  I started yelling for Sam and Kevin
to return home, and that they (THE FEDS) had shot
Striker.  I also fired my shotgun once into the air to
draw attention to myself praying that would help.  I
replaced the empty shell with a new one....jamming  
the shotgun.  I drew my .9mm handgun and fired 3-4
rounds up into the air and I yelled again for Sam to
return home.  Sam responded 'I'm coming DAD!'  I then
walked backwards up the hill toward home yelling to Sam
and Kevin to come home.  All the while I heard many
shots ringing out from the direction of the
ambush.[FN389]<p>
In the August 26 letter, Sara Weaver quotes Harris:<p>
Me (Kevin Harris) and Sam followed Striker through the
woods until we came out on the road that forks off the
one Randy was on  . . .Striker reached the corner
first, then Sam, and then me.  A camouflaged [sic]
person was in the road and he shot Striker.  Sam yelled
'You shot Striker, you sonafabitch!'  And they pointed
a gun at Sam.  Sam opened [sic] fire.  I took cover
behind a stump and Sam headed up the road toward home. 
it appeared [sic] as though Sam had been wounded in the
right arm . . . . THE men were still shooting at Sam,
so I shot one of the sons of bitches.  After they
killed Sam one of the FEDs jumped out of the woods and
for the first time declared he was a federal marshal. 
The FEDs then grabbed their wounded and left.  I then
headed home up the road and spotted Sam's body laying
in the road without a doubt shot in the back.[FN390]<p> In a statement to the FBI on
September 1, 1992, Harris added
that he raised his rifle to fire when he fired at Degan, who
Harris said was approximately 20 feet away in the brush.  Harris
then heard Degan call out that he had been hit.  When Harris
fired, Sammy Weaver had already begun running up the trail. 
Harris claimed that after he fired the shots at Degan the
shooting came to a halt for a few seconds before he heard another
shot.  Sammy "yelped," then was silent.  Harris said he fired one
more shot in front of a camouflaged man who had reappeared out of
the brush "to scare him."  Harris stayed behind the stump
"approximately ten more minutes," when he heard "the sound of a
vehicle down the hill."  He then retreated to the Weaver house. 
Approximately 15 minutes later, Randy and Vicki Weaver, along
with Harris, retrieved the body of Sammy Weaver and placed it in
the birthing shed.[FN391]<p>On the morning of August 21, Ruth Rau was outside her house,
loading laundry into her car.  At approximately 10:30 a.m., she
heard a series of gunshots in rapid succession, coming from the
direction of the Y.  Rau estimated that a total of 50 rounds were
fired, with the initial burst of gunfire lasting approximately
two minutes.  She heard additional gunshots at approximately
11:15 a.m.[FN392]<p>  <H4>d.  Events Following the Gunfire</H4><p> Roderick hearing
Cooper's call for help, radioed the OP team
to send Norris, the medic, to the Y.  Roderick was unable to see
Cooper or Degan but assumed that they were on the trail above
him.  After requesting assistance, he dove back out onto the
trail in a prone position to assess the situation.  As he looked
for Cooper or Degan, he heard a rifle shot from his right front
side and then felt something pass across his stomach.  Roderick
heard more shots and ran back into the woods for cover, where he
received additional fire.  After examining himself, Roderick
discovered a bullet hole in his shirt but he was not injured.<p>Shortly thereafter,
Roderick heard movement off to his right
in the woods across the road.  Cooper told Roderick to toss
stones so that Cooper could determine where Roderick was and
direct him to Cooper's location.  Roderick moved through the
thicket toward Cooper and radioed their position to Hunt.  Both
men heard sporadic gunfire from the direction of the Weaver
compound and the fern field.[FN393]<p> Meanwhile, Hunt, Norris and Thomas arrived at the
Y.As he
emerged from the canopy trail, Hunt had his handgun drawn while
Norris, the medic, placed his weapon on the ground and attempted
to resuscitate Degan.  Hunt picked up Norris' rifle laying on the
ground and looked across the trail up toward Weaver's cabin, but
saw no one.  Norris worked on Degan for a short time before
announcing that he was dead.[FN394] Cooper told Hunt and Norris
that Harris had shot Degan and that he believed that he had hit
Harris.[FN395] The marshals whispered because noise would bring
gunfire in response.[FN396] They fired no additional shots at 
the Y.<p> Shortly thereafter, there was a tremendous discharge of
gunshots on the trail to the Weaver house, followed by the sound
of male and female voices wailing.  The marshals also heard
cursing; a woman shout, "Yahweh;" a man yell, "you son of a
bitch," and others scream, "You tried to kill my daddy."[FN397] 
At the time the marshals did not know that Sammy Weaver had been
shot in the confrontation.<p>  Roderick, Cooper, and Norris waited in the brush with
Degan's body while Hunt and Norris left for help.  Four to five
hours later, they heard an aircraft overhead and some gunfire.
[FN398] Whether conditions deteriorated as the day progressed, and 
it started to rain.[FN399] Cooper and Roderick, who decided not to 
leave without Degan's body, made several attempts to move Degan, 
but could not.[FN400] Roderick maintained radio contact with Hunt 
and told him that every time the marshals made a noise, the 
Weavers responded with heavy gunfire.[FN401]<p>   <H3>3.  Discussion</H3><P><H4>a.  
Alleged Intent of the Marshals to Force
a Confrontation with the Weavers</H4><p>This investigation has revealed no evidence that
the
marshals went to the Weaver property on August 21, 1992 intending
to use deadly force against Randy Weaver or his family.  indeed,
the evidence indicates quite the contrary.  Months of planning
went into formulating the undercover plan,  and Director Hudson
had explicitly rejected any strategy that might harm Vicki Weaver
or her children.  We find absolutely no support for the
suggestion that Roderick deliberately ignored Hudson's direct
orders not to engage the Weavers.[FN402]<p> (1)  The .9mm Weapon<p>   Defense counsel
questioned the marshals' selection of
firearms, particularly the .9mm "suppressed" semi-automatic
weapon, and implied that the weapon was brought on the mission
expressly to shoot the Weaver dog.[FN403]<p>  At the outset, it should be noted that a
"suppressed" weapon
is not silent.  The suppression mechanism reduces firing noise to
approximately one-fifth of the noise absent the mechanism.  If
the marshals had intended to fire a weapon without detection, the
Marshals Service had quieter guns available.[FN404]<p>   The five surviving marshals
insist they had not planned to
use the .9mm, or any other weapon, to shoot the Weaver dog. 
Roderick testified that they marshals would have to neutralize
the dogs when it came time to arrest Weaver, but that they only
planned to conduct reconnaissance on the August mission.[FN405] 
Thomas understood that if they were confronted by the dogs, they
were to leave the area.[FN406] Cooper said that they did not 
intend to get close enough to the Weaver house to encounter 
the dogs.[FN407]<p> The possibility of shooting the dog apparently first arose
as Roderick, Cooper, and Degan were running away from the dog and
Harris.  Roderick reports that, during the attempted escape, he
said that the dog might have to be killed because it had picked
up the marshals' scent.[FN408] Cooper also said that he decided
while they were running that it might be necessary to use the
suppressed .9mm to "take out" the dog because it was leading the
pursuers to the marshals and endangering their lives.[FN409]<p>The .9mm was not used to
shoot the dog.  Cooper stated that
he did not shoot the dog for fear that by doing so in plain view
of Harris, it would precipitate a firefight.[FN410] it was 
Roderick who shot the dog with his rifle, after hearing a shot 
fired to his left.<p>Cooper and Roderick, who spent many years in the Special
Operations Group, saw nothing unusual about taking a "suppressed"
weapon on a surveillance mission.[FN411] We do not find the 
presence of the weapon suspicious and can envision circumstances 
in which this type of weapon would be important for a 
surveillance team, such as when dangerous animals could be 
encountered.[FN412]<p>Although we recognize that the decision to bring the
"suppressed" weapon on the mission may seem unusual, we are
satisfied that there was no preconceived plan to use it or any
other weapon to shoot the Weavers or their dog.[FN413]<p>(2)  "Zeroing" the Weapons<p>  
It is common practice to "Zero" or readjust the sights of
weapons that have been shipped to ensure that they have not been
damaged in transit.[FN414] Chief Deputy Marshal Moriarity arranged
for the team to use a firing range to zero the weapons Degan had
shipped from Boston to Spokane to be used in the mission.  On
Thursday, August 20, Roderick, Cooper, Degan, Hunt, and
Moriarity, along with some local deputy sheriffs, drove to the
firing range and spent about an hour sighting and testing the
weapons.[FN415]<p>Defense counsel pointed to the marshals' zeroing of their
weapons as evidence that they had planned to confront the
Weavers.[FN416] We found no evidence to support this allegation. 
The marshals' trip to the firing range was made openly, with
several local state and federal law enforcement officials
present.  Contrary to defense claims, it was not [SEALED BY
COURT]  for the marshals' benefit but rather was nothing more
than a precautionary practice in which the marshals routinely
engaged.  We do not attribute anything suspicious to this outing.<p>  (3)  Presence of a
Medic on the Surveillance Team<p> Defense counsel also alleged that Norris, the medic,
was
brought on the August 21 mission [SEALED BY COURT]<p>[FN417]    Counsels' statement
implies the marshals planned a violent confrontation with the
Weavers that day.  We find no support for such a contention.<p> Each prior trip to the
Weaver property had medical
support.[FN418]  The Weaver cabin is on a remote, heavily wooded
mountain, and access to the area is difficult.  It is common for
a medic to go on an operation under such .[FN419]<p> The marshals also could not ignore
the fact that the Weavers
were constantly armed and were reportedly hostile to law
enforcement.  We consider the assignment of a medic to the team
to be a responsible precaution under the circumstances and not
proof that an assault was planned.<p>4)  Tossing of Rocks<p> Defense counsel also
alleged that Roderick threw rocks
[SEALED BY COURT] to taunt the Weaver dogs and to provoke a
confrontation.[FN420] Although Roderick did throw two rocks, we
cannot conclude that this was done for the reason counsel posits.<p>The rocks at issue
were thrown at least 15 minutes before
the dogs were alerted by the sound of a vehicle.  According to
Cooper he suggested to Roderick that they toss rocks "to see what
the dogs would respond to" because it was important to know which
sounds would draw a reaction from the dogs in case a "cover" team
member made a noise while moving into position.[FN421] Roderick was
not concerned that tossing the rocks would create an unwarranted
risk [FN422] since he had noticed during previous surveillance
missions that a variety of sounds emanated from the woods,
particularly along the side of the mountain.<p>Roderick distinguished his intent to test
for a reaction
from the dogs from purposely trying to provoke them.  He denied
attempting to excite the dogs.[FN423] Roderick was confident that,
if the Weavers had heard the rocks, they would not have been able
to see the marshals and that, if the dogs had reacted, they could
not have reached the marshals.[FN424]<p>We do not believe that the marshals threw the
rocks with the
intent to agitate the dogs or to draw them to the marshals'
location.  Although we accept as reasonable the marshals' desire
to determine how sound would carry in order to determine the best
position for the observation post, we do not believe that the
marshals fully considered the potential chain of events that
could have unfolded if the dogs had reacted to the rocks. 
Although this decision was not well considered, we found no
evidence that it was improperly motivated.[FN425]<p>(5)  The Trip to the Lower
Garden<p>Though not specifically raised by the defense, this inquiry
considered whether the marshals went to the lower garden/spring
house area below the mount on which the Weaver cabin sits for the
purpose of luring the dog or the Weavers from the house.  We
found no evidence that the trip was made to incite a skirmish
with the Weavers.  Notwithstanding this conclusion, we must
question the wisdom of the marshals travelling that close to the
compound in daylight, especially after the dogs had been barking
much of the morning.[FN426]<p> <H4>b.   The Initiation of Gunfire at the Y </H4><p>he
prosecution charged at trial that Harris fired at Degan
at the Y and set off the chain of events that led to the deaths
of Degan, Sammy Weaver, and the Weaver dog.  The defense
countered that it was the marshals, not Harris, who had initiated
the gunfire.  The jury acquitted Weaver and Harris of all charges
that they had assaulted federal officers.<p> The marshals testified at trial and
provided sworn
statements to this inquiry.  The Weavers and Kevin Harris did not
testify and declined to be interviewed for this investigation. 
Thus, their rendition of what occurred is derived from statements
made by or attributed to them following the shootings and their
surrender.<p> (1)  Witness Accounts<p> Cooper was the only witness who saw Harris shoot
Degan.  He
testified that Harris fired first.  Harris admitted that he shot
Degan, but claimed that he did so after Roderick had shot the
dog.  It is not disputed that Harris was carrying a heavy caliber
30.06 rifle.<p>  Roderick could not see Harris fire and could not say whether
the first shot came from a .223 or 30.06 caliber weapon.  Thomas
and Hunt agree that the first shot sounded like a heavy caliber
weapon.  Harris and Randy Weaver were the only ones at or near
the Y with heavy caliber guns.  However, Norris thought that the
first shot, and the two that followed, came from a .223. 
Roderick and Degan were carrying .223 caliber M16 rifles.<p>Thomas, Hunt, and Norris
agree about the sequence of the
shots.  They heard one, then two shots, in quick succession,
followed by a barrage of fire.  Cooper said that Harris fired
once, and then Roderick twice.  Roderick said he heard one shot
before he fired once or perhaps twice.  The physical evidence
indicates Roderick fired only once.  Hunt, Norris, and Roderick
all stated that they heard Degan and Cooper start to identify
themselves just before the first shot.  Weaver and Harris gave
conflicting versions.  Weaver said that one of the marshals
called out for him to freeze before there was any gunfire. 
Harris said that the marshals did not identify themselves until
after the gunfire had stopped.<p>(2)  Physical Evidence<p>An inventory of the marshals'
ammunition taken on the early
morning of August 22 showed that Hunt, Norris, and Thomas did not
fire their weapons during the incident.  Roderick fired one shot
from an M16 rifle.  Cooper fired six shots form the .9mm weapon.
Degan's weapon had been fired seven times.[FN427] This appears to
be inconsistent with Harris' claim that there was an "explosion
of gunfire" from the marshals.[FN428] We believe that the marshals
exercised restraint as to the number of shots discharged by the
Weavers and Harris.[FN429]<p> Sammy Weaver was struck twice in the exchange of gunfire. 
One round hit him in the right arm, near the elbow, traveling
from front to back.  This bullet also shattered the stock of his
rifle.  The second and fatal shot hit the boy in the back and
passed through his body, exiting after a slight track from left
to right.[FN430]<p> (3)  The First Shot<p>We are presented with diametrically opposed
descriptions of
events that occurred at the Y.  However, we are sensitive to the
fact that the gunfight occurred quickly and that all of the
participants were under extraordinary stress during and after the
shooting[FN431] which may have affected the witnesses' perception 
of events. The physical evidence is inconclusive and provides no
assistance in determining who initiated the gunfight, although it
is clear that the marshals did not "ambush" the Weavers.  Thus,
based upon the evidence available, we do not believe we can
definitively reconstruct the sequence of fire that occurred at
the Y.<p><H4>c.   The Shooting of Sammy Weaver</H4><p> Dr. Charles R. Lindholm, who
performed the autopsy on Sammy
Weaver, could not offer an opinion on the type of bullet which
wounded Sammy's arm.  Dr. Lindholm reported that the fatal
back/chest wound was "indicative of a low velocity round."  he
did not believe that it was caused by a .223 caliber bullet and
thought that the wound "would be more consistent with that of a 9
millimeter round."[FN432]<p>  Dr. Martin L. Fackler testified at trial for the
prosecution
as an expert in "wound ballistics."  Dr. Fackler concluded that
the fatal wound was caused by a .9mm bullet.[FN433] Dr. Fackler
believed the bullet that caused the fatal wound was similar to
the silver tipped bullets used in Cooper's weapon.[FN434]<p>Two .9mm firearms were at or
near the "Y":  Randy Weaver had
a .9mm pistol;  Cooper had been assigned a .9mm  "suppressed"
semi-automatic weapon.  Weaver claims to have fired his weapon
three or four times;[FN435] Cooper's was fired six times. Harris
reported that he heard the shot that killed Sammy.[FN436]<p>Degan's M16 rifle fires a
.223 caliber round.  None of the
marshals saw Degan discharge his weapon, though his gun was fired
seven times.  Cooper said that he did not fire Degan's weapon
after he retrieved it.[FN437] Dr. Fackler testified that Degan 
could have fired his weapon after he had been shot in the chest 
by Harris, although his accuracy would have been impaired.[FN438]
However, Fackler did not believe that Degan's M16 caused the
fatal injury, but thought it was possible that the weapon could
have caused the wound to Sammy's arm. [FN439]<p>Cooper and Roderick last saw Sammy run
out of view up the
trail.  The location where Harris found Sammy's body is unknown
because the Weavers moved the body.<p>  Although it is not our intention to speculate,
the evidence,
though not conclusive, certainly suggests that the shot that
killed Sammy came from Cooper's .9mm weapon.  We have found no
evidence that Cooper, or any of the marshals, intentionally
sought to kill or injure Sammy Weaver.<p> Cooper said that he purposely fired three
shots at Harris,
after Harris shot Degan and appeared to be preparing to fire at
Degan again.  Cooper was convinced that he wounded or killed
Harris, who dropped to the ground "like a sack of potatoes."[FN440]
Actually, Cooper missed Harris, who disappeared out of view into
the woods along the trail.  Cooper then wheeled his weapon toward
Sammy and took aim, but did not fire.[FN441] Cooper next fired a
second three round burst, in the direction from which he had
received fire, as cover in an effort to reach Degan.  He said
this burst was not directed at a specific target.  It is possible
that Sammy may have been mortally wounded at that time.  <p> Sammy Weaver was shot
during a firefight in which he was a
participant.  There is no proof, and we do not conclude, that
Cooper intentionally aimed the fatal shot at Sammy Weaver. 
Indeed, the record demonstrates that the marshals went to great
lengths in preparing for their mission to avoid endangering the
Weaver children.<p>
<H4>d.   Allegation the Marshals Attempted to
Cover Up the Shooting of Sammy Weaver</H4><p> The marshals maintain that they did not
know that Sammy
Weaver had been killed until they were told about it on Sunday,
August 23.[FN442] Prior to that time the marshals did not believe
that Sammy Weaver had been harmed during the encounter.  Cooper
did not believe that he had hit Sammy when he put down cover fire
to get to Degan, because he saw Sammy running up the trail
afterward.[FN443] Indeed the only person that Cooper thought he had
injured was Kevin Harris who he thought he had seen fall "like a
sack of potatoes."<p> According to Jurgensen, the news that Sammy's body had been
discovered in the "birthing" shed on August 22 appeared to
surprise the marshals.  Before this, the marshals had reported
that Sammy had been at the Y when the shooting began, but they
did not believe that he had been shot.[FN444] There was no mention
of Sammy when the Weavers retrieved his body from the 
trail.[FN445]<p>In conclusion, we found no evidence that the marshals took
any actions to conceal the death of Sammy Weaver.  Indeed, the
evidence indicates that it was not until the FBI discovered the
body on August 24 that the marshals were even aware that Sammy
Weaver had been killed.<p>    <H3>4.   Conclusion</H3><p>We are unable to determine who
initiated the gunfire at the
Y on August 21.  The evidence suggests, but does not establish,
that the shot that killed Sammy Weaver was fired by Deputy
Marshal Cooper.  Assuming that to be so, we find that there was
no intent on the part of Cooper or any of the other marshals to
harm Sammy Weaver.  We also find that the marshals did not
attempt to conceal the shooting of Sammy Weaver since they were
unaware that Sammy Weaver had even been injured.<p><hr><P>   Released through<p>

     369 The marshals gave statements to the FBI following the
shooting and testified in the preliminary hearing before the
grand jury and at trial.  They also gave statements to this
investigation.  The Weavers and Harris did not testify either

{G.J.}
Roderick FD-302, August 28, 1992, at 2.  Cooper told Roderick
that he thought Roderick had fired twice.  Roderick FD-302,
August 22 & 28, 1992, at 8.  Roderick also thought that he might
have fired two rounds.  Roderick Sworn Statement (draft), at 25. 
However, the physical evidence reveals that Roderick fired only
once.  FD-302 Interview of Mark Jurgensen, August 22, 1992, at 2.<p>
     378 Roderick FD-302, August 22 & 28, 1992, at 8.  Roderick
said that the shooting sounded "like it was all around us.  There
was bark and other debris flying as bullets hit the ground around
me."  Roderick Sworn Statement (draft), at 26; Roderick Trial
Testimony, May 24, 1993, at 100.  The distance between where
Roderick jumped into the brush after shooting the dog and
Cooper's position was later measured as 39 feet.  Roderick FD-

and "bits of dirt and debris 'dancing' on the ground."  Cooper
Sworn Statement, at 10.<p>
     380 An FBI report quoted Cooper as suggesting that he held
his gun over his head and fired blindly.  Cooper FD-302, August
30, 1992, at 3.  At trial, and to this investigation, Cooper
insisted that he was misquoted and that he had aimed down the
barrel of his rifle.  Cooper Trial Testimony, April 15, 1993, at

August 22, 1992, at 7.<p>
     388 Hunt thought that the shots had been fired from the
front and above him to his left.  Hunt was approximately 20 to 30
yards from the Y when they received the volley of gunfire.  Hunt
Sworn Statement, at 26.  Thomas and Norris were about 50 yards
behind him.  Thomas did a somersault to avoid the fire and kept
running.  Thomas Sworn Statement, at 9.  Hunt looked back at
Thomas and Norris, saw them on the ground, and thought that they
had been hit.  Hunt Sworn Statement, at 26.  Norris thought that
Sara or Rachel Weaver fired the shots.  The latter had been seen
leaving the house carrying weapons shortly before the OP team
started for the Y.  Norris Sworn Statement, at 10.<p>
     389 Letter from Sara Weaver, August 26, 1992 (Appendix at
27).  Weaver told Bo Gritz in a monitored conversation that "Sam
opened up on the marshals when he saw 'em shoot the dog.  That's
when Kevin shot the officer.  Because they shot Sam."  Transcript
of Conversation between Randy Weaver and Bo Gritz, August 29,
1992.  In another conversation, recorded by the FBI, Randy Weaver
told Jackie Brown that Harris "saw Sam get hit in the right arm. 
And he, he just wanted to stop 'em from shootin' at him.  What
the hell would anybody do?"  Transcript of Conversation between
Randy Weaver, Bo Gritz, and Jackie Brown, August 29, 1992.<p>
     Randy Weaver has also claimed that he went "down to the Y
and somebody jumped out in front of me, and yelled something.  I
headed back toward home, and I heard a shot, and I heard the dog
yelp."  Harris added, "Somebody shot the dog and, and it just,
all the woods exploded with gunfire."  Transcript of Interview of
Weaver by Tom Brokaw, August 18, 1993, for "Now," NBC News.<p>

had shot Harris then.  He did, however, receive a radio
transmission from Cooper saying this about an hour after Thomas
reached the Rau house.  Thomas Trial Testimony, June 2, 1993, at

     396 Hunt Sworn Statement, at 27; Roderick Trial Testimony,
May 24, 1993, at 122 ("[E}very time the Weavers heard a sound
they just unloaded, they would start firing at any noise they
heard").<p>
     397 The most likely explanation for the uproar is that the
Weavers had discovered Sammy Weaver's body.  However, there was
no mention of Sammy Weaver's name during the commotion.  Cooper
Sworn Statement, at 11; Roderick Sworn Statement (draft), at 27;
Hunt Sworn Statement, at 28.  The marshals could not see anyone
from their position.  Roderick and Cooper assumed that the uproar
meant that Harris had died from wounds received during the
exchange of fire.  Cooper Trial Testimony, April 25, 1993, at
170, April 16, 1993, at 527;  Cooper Sworn Statement, at 11;

     398 Roderick testified that he heard the plane about two
hours after Thomas and Hunt had left.  Roderick Trial Testimony,
May 24, 1993, at 125.  See Norris Trial Testimony, June 2, 1993,
at 75.  Roderick told Hunt to instruct the Federal Aviation
Administration to restrict airspace around the mountain.

     399 Cooper characterized conditions as "miserable."  Cooper

it had started to rain.<p>
     400 Cooper and Roderick refused a suggestion from the Crisis
Center that they leave Degan and "get out of there."  Hunt Sworn
Statement, at 31-32.<p>
     401 Roderick gave Hunt various orders as Hunt and Thomas
worked their way down the mountain, such as to reestablish the
observation post, block off the road, and obtain night vision
equipment.  Hunt relayed Roderick's instructions, but they were
not followed.  Roderick Sworn Statement (draft), at 27-28; 
Cooper Sworn Statement, at 11.<p>
     402 Roderick specifically instructed surveillance team
members on the evening of August 19 to avoid any encounter with
the Weavers, particularly the children.  Hunt Sworn Statement, at
20;  Cooper Sworn Statement, at 5; Norris FD-302, August 23 & 29,
1992, at 1.  Roderick characterized himself as having been
"brainwashed" about ensuring that "the children were . . .
completely removed from the equation."  Roderick Sworn Statement
(draft), at 20.  Thomas told us that the team had been instructed
"to hide (from the children) and avoid them."  Thomas Sworn
Statement, at 4.<p>

     405 Roderick considered a number of means of controlling the
dogs when the time came to arrest Weaver.  Deadly force and
various chemical products were among the options.  however,
Roderick did not finalize a plan because the operation never
reached the point when arrest was imminent.  Roderick Trial
Testimony, May 20, 1993, at 149-52, 154.<p>
     406 Thomas Sworn Statement, at 3.<p>
     407 Cooper had been involved in 1991 in a SOG operation in
California where three SOG members and three National Guardsmen
hiked several miles through dense woods to arrest a fugitive.  on
that project, Cooper was prepared to shoot the fugitive's dog if
the dog and the fugitive was captured without incident.  Cooper

dogs are on us," Thomas and Hunt heard a radio transmission from
someone on the Recon team about the possibility of shooting the
dog.  Thomas Sworn Statement, at 8;  Hunt Sworn Statement, at 25.<p>   410 Cooper Sworn

     411 Cooper Sworn Statement, at 4.<p>    412 Moriarity reported that there are bears
and other large,
often dangerous, animals in the woods of Northern Idaho.  Such
animals would be a legitimate concern for the team.  Moriarity
FD-302, at 7.  The Marshals Service Firearms Policy provides that
firearms may be used against animals "to prevent attack that
threatens bodily injury."  See Memo by Stanley E. Morris,
(former) Director, U.S. Marshals Service, June 10, 1988, at 2.<p>
     413 We are troubled by the fact that there was no plan to
deal with the dogs during the surveillance mission.  The animals
were known to be active and excitable, and there had been reports
that one of the dogs, Striker, was aggressive and had attacked
someone.  Cooper Sworn Statement, at 5.  The potential for an
encounter certainly existed and ought to have been more
thoroughly considered.<p>

Trial Testimony, May 24, 1993, at 190<p>
     425 We are again unsettled by the absence of a plan for the
possibility that the dogs would locate the marshals' position. 
This omission is symptomatic of a larger problem, the lack of a
plan to follow should the Weavers discover the marshals.  For
instance, all three marshals abandoned the observation post once
the shooting began at the Y.  Although their desire to go to the
aid of their colleagues is understandable, the law enforcement
components that responded to the mountain were deprived of vital
information on the Weavers' location and movements in the hours
that followed the shooting.<p>
     426 Again, there was no contingency plan to keep someone at
the observation post, should the Weavers pursue the
reconnaissance team.  The marshals who remained on the mountain
with Degan's body following the shootout asked Hunt to place
someone in the observation post to observe the Weavers.  Cooper
Sworn Statement, at 11.  This was not done.<p>
     427 Roderick's weapon had been loaded with 27 rounds, as had
Degan's.  Cooper's 9mm had been loaded with 25 rounds.  Jurgensen

     428 Defense counsel likewise described the marshal's fire as
"wild."  Defendants' Memorandum, at 4.<p>
     429 Ruth Rau believes that she heard approximately 50 shots
fired during the initial exchange of gunfire, which she estimated
as lasting two minutes.  See Ruth Rau FD-302, October 12 & 13,
1993, at 8.  Fourteen of these rounds were fired by the marshals.<p>

<H3>IV. SPECIFIC ISSUES INVESTIGATED</H3><p>
<H3>E.   Activation of FBI hostage Rescue Team and SWAT Teams on
August 21, 1992 and Initial Intelligence Gathering.</H3><p>   <H3>1.
Introduction</H3><p>
     Soon after the U.S. Marshals Service Headquarters learned of
the shooting at Ruby Ridge it contacted FBI Headquarters
officials.  A decision was made to deploy the FBI Hostage Rescue
Team ("HRT") to Ruby Ridge.  Allegations have been made that the
deployment of the HRT on August 21 was based on false information
about the dangerousness of Randy Weaver, the situation at Ruby
Ridge and the August 21 exchange of gunfire.  In addition, it has
been contended that the activation of the HRT and regional FBI
Swat Teams was an improper, unnecessary, and exaggerated response
to the situation.  Specifically, critics have suggested that
local law enforcement agents, who rescued the marshals, should
have been left to resolve the situation and that the U.S.
Marshals Service should have remained in charge.  There has also
been a claim that the federal response was driven by an
influential Department of Justice official who had been a close
friend of Deputy U.S. Marshal Degan and the Degan family.<p>
     Critics have also charged that the FBI failed to assess the
situation accurately after the August 21 shooting in large part
because they failed to carefully gather and verify information on
the background of the Weaver/Harris group and the events that
transpired at the Y.  The faulty information gathering techniques
of the FBI is alleged to have contributed to the subsequent shots
fired on August 22, 1992.<p>
     <H3>2.   Statement of Facts</H3><p><H4>a.   The Marshals' Report of the
Shooting</H4><p>  Following the shooting at the Y, Deputy Marshal David Hunt,
who was familiar with the terrain of the mountain, and Deputy
Marshal Joseph Thomas left, at approximately 10:45 a.m. to get
aid.  They headed through the woods to the Rau house [FN446] where
they arrived approximately 40 minutes later.<p>
     Hunt immediately placed a "911" call for assistance which
was received by the Boundary County Sheriff's Office, Bonners
Ferry, Idaho, at 11:20 a.m.  Hunt told the dispatcher:<p>
I have an emergency situation on my hands.....
I got one officer dead.  I got (inaudible)
pinned down.  I need help quick.....I want
the State Police, I want all the help that I can get.
I gotta go back in for more officers that are
trapped. [FN447]<p>
Next, Hunt called Marshals Service Headquarters in
Washington, DC  and told Tony Perez, Chief of Enforcement
Operations, that before the shooting began, a dog had picked up
the marshals' scent and that they had run to avoid the Weavers.
Hunt spoke of a "heck of a gunfight," in which Harris killed
Degan.  Hunt told Perez that he had not heard any gunfire since
leaving the mountain. [FN448]<p>
Shortly thereafter, Hunt told Chief Deputy Ron Narvarro of
the Boundary County Sheriff's Office that the marshals were still
on the hill and that they required assistance.  Hunt did not say
that the marshals were "pinned down." [FN449]<p>
     The Marshals Service Crisis Center ("Crisis Center") was
activated under the direction of Duke Smith, Deputy Director of
Operations, and the Special Operations Group ("SOG") was alerted
to deploy. [FN450] Hunt was transferred to an open line in the
Crisis Center, on which he explained:<p>
Initial reports indicate that the USMS surveillance team
came under fire from occupants of the Weaver compound and
are still pinned down in defensive positions. [FN451]<p>
(Emphasis added.)<p> Twenty five minutes later, at 12:05 p.m., Hunt reported to
the Crisis Center:<p>
Local sheriff has SWAT team on the way to the scene, which
[sic] is no longer taking fire . . . .  Team [of marshals]
was trying to pull out when Weaver's dog alerted, team drew
multiple volleys of fire from the house.  Degan was struck
in the chest.  Return fire killed on e of Weaver's dogs.
The rest of the team is still located on the mountain, but
not under fire, unable to withdraw without exposing 
themselves to hostile fire. [FN452]<p>
(Emphasis added.)<p>FBI Special Agent Donald Glasser was detailed to the Crisis
Center.  Perez briefed Glasser at approximately 1:00 p.m. and
used the term "pinned down" to describe the marshals' state, but
did not say that the marshals were "receiving fire." [FN453]<p> By this time, agents
from the U.S. Border Patrol, the
Boundary County Sheriff's Office, and the Idaho State Police had
reached the scene.  The Idaho State Police Critical Response Team
("CRI") and the Marshals Service SOG unit were en route. [FN454]
Various law enforcement officers ran sirens to "send a message to
the mountain that they were there." [FN455]<p>In the afternoon, Hunt spoke to Mays in
the Marshals Service
Office in Boise.  Mays asked for an account of the events so that
he could prepare court papers, if needed.  Hunt started to tell
Mays about the events of August 21 when Marshal Johnson took the
phone.  Later Johnson repeated to Mays what Hunt had told him.
Mays used this information to prepare an affidavit in support of
a warrant to search the Weaver cabin and property. [FN456]<p> At some point, Cooper told
Hunt that he may have shot
Harris.  this information was passed to the Crisis Center.[FN457]
Hunt briefed many of the law enforcement officers on the scene,
giving a detailed listing of the weapons each member of the
Weaver family was known to carry.  He told them he did not
believe that there were booby traps on the property.[FN458]<p> John Twomey, Deputy
Director of Administration, informed
Director Hudson of the shooting, while the latter was en route to
North Carolina.  Twomey reported that, according to Hunt, the
Weaver dogs had been "spooked" by the marshals, Harris had killed
Degan, and the marshals were pinned down.  Twomey added that Hunt
assumed that the marshals were still receiving gunfire. [FN459]
Hudson instructed Twomey to notify Douglas Gow, FBI Associate
Deputy Director of Investigations, at FBI Headquarters, of the
incident.<p> <H4>b.  Decision to Deploy the HRT</H4><p>  The FBI's involvement in the
Idaho crisis began when U.S.
Marshals Service Director Henry Hudson told FBI Associate Deputy
Director W. Douglas Gow that a Deputy U.S. Marshal had been shot
and killed in Northern Idaho;  That two other deputy marshals
remained pinned down, having previously received heavy gunfire
from several subjects; and that the Department of Justice had
instructed that the FBI would be the lead agency handling the
situation.  Director Hudson and Gow scheduled a meeting for 4:30
p.m. EDT to discuss the situation. [FN460]<p> Before the meeting with the Marshals
Service, FBI Assistant
Director Larry Potts told FBI Violent Crimes and Major Offenders
Section Chief E. Michael Kahoe to learn as much as he could about
the incident.  thereafter, Kahoe called Special Agent in Charge
Eugene F. Glenn of the FBI's Salt Lake City Division at
approximately 5:30 p.m. EDT (3:30 p.m. MDT).  He told Glenn that
a deputy marshal had been shot and killed during a firefight in
Northern Idaho, that Gow had been called by the Marshals Service
Headquarters and that FBI assistance had been requested.  Kahoe
said Hudson was en route to FBI headquarters to provide
additional details to senior Bureau managers. [FN461]<p> Glenn realized that there would
be few resources in Northern
Idaho and initiated a series of actions to prepare for a probable
FBI response.  he instructed Special Agent George J. Calley at
the Boise FBI Office to obtain additional details of the
incident.  Calley subsequently reported that he had learned from
U.S. Marshal Michael Johnson that, during a fugitive
investigation, one deputy marshal had been killed, another had
been wounded, and additional marshals were pinned down near the
site of the original gunfire.  In addition, Calley learned that
the primary subject in this matter was Randy Weaver and that the
current priority of the Marshals Service was to rescue the
marshals on the hill. [FN462]<p>  Glenn relayed this information to Kahoe and over the
next
several hours, it was agreed that he would begin an FBI SWAT Team
call-up in the Salt Lake Division and would prepare for
deployment to Northern Idaho.  Glenn also agreed with FBI
Headquarters to deploy the Portland and Seattle SWAT teams and
accepted management assistance from Special Agent in Charge
William D. Gore, Seattle Division. [FN463]<p> When Gow received word of the assault, he
called Assistant
Special Agent in Charge Richard Rogers, Commander of the FBI
Hostage Rescue Team ("HRT").  The HRT is a specialized full-time
tactical team, based at the FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia.
Although its original purpose was to handle high-risk terrorist,
hostage situations, its mission has evolved to cover a variety of
sensitive, high-risk situations.[FN464]  At 4:30 p.m. EDT, Gow told
Rogers that a deputy marshal had been shot and killed in Northern
Idaho, that other deputy marshals were still pinned down there,
and that the Marshals Service had requested assistance.  As a
result, the HRT was put on alert. [FN465]<p>  Gow, Potts, and Deputy Assistant Director
Danny O. Coulson
met with Hudson and Marshals Service officials John Twomey and
Herb Rutherford.  Hudson described the situation and requested
FBI assistance.  He conveyed an urgency in the request,
explaining that:  "one DUSM had been shot, two DUSMs were 'pinned
down,' a third DUSM was relaying information.  The concern at the
time was to get these deputies out of 'harms way' before
additional casualties were incurred." [FN466]  Hudson and the others
reported that a team of marshals had been attempting to perform
reconnaissance in preparation for serving an arrest warrant on
Randy Weaver.  They asserted that:<p>
[O]ne of the DUSMs had been attacked by a dog, and had shot
the dog, which started a firefight.  During the firefight,
one DUSM had been killed and his body and the remaining
surviving DUSMs had been able to escape and get to a
telephone, the remaining DUSMs were in only sporadic radio
contact, and their exact location was not known.  The
reported heavy fire had been directed at the DUSMs from
numerous locations . . . the team of DUSMs had not intended
a confrontation with the subjects, and had attempted to flee
when confronted by the dog and subjects, but had been chased
by the subjects, before the shooting death of the DUSM
occurred. [FN467]<p>During this meeting, the FBI representatives were shown an
aerial photograph of the Weaver cabin and the surrounding area
and were told that Weaver and his associates would leave their
[Editor's Note: Page 135 in the text is unavailable, which
includes footnotes 468 to 472.] cabin.  It was believed that Weaver knew well the
extremely
rugged terrain near his cabin.  He had told the media that he
would not be captured alive and that the only way he would leave
his cabin would be to die in a shoot-out.  His entire family,
including his wife and children, was reported to be heavily
armed. [FN473]<p>  Following the meeting, Gow briefed the FBI Director William
Sessions and called the Deputy Attorney Generals office in the
Department of Justice.  Although Gow acknowledged that Degan was
a "high profile individual within the USMS", Gow stated there was
no pressure on the FBI to activate the HRT by friends of Degan.
[FN474] Robert Mueller, then Assistant Attorney General for the
Criminal Division, was a professional acquaintance of Deputy
Marshal Degan's as they had both worked in Boston while Mueller
was in the U.S. Attorney's Office.  Mueller, however was not even
in town during the first days of the crisis.  Gow thought that
Potts may have also known Degan in Boston.<p>  HRT deployments must be initiated by the
Assistant Director
of the FBI's Criminal Investigative Division ("CID").  After
consulting with FBI Deputy Assistant Director Coulson, Potts
decided to deploy the HRT fully.  He had no conversation with
anyone outside the FBI regarding this decision and was not
pressured to deploy the HRT.  Potts acknowledged, however, that
he consulted with Coulson whom he considers the most
knowledgeable tactical operations manager in the Bureau.  They
concluded that this would be an "extremely high-risk operation,
possibly the highest risk situation [they] could encounter,"
given the information about Weaver's Special Forces background;
his knowledge of explosives; the fact his children were trained
with weapons; and his possible Aryan Nations affiliation.  It was
their understanding that:<p>
One law enforcement officer had already been killed, and
others remained "pinned down," unable to be extricated.  The
attack on the retreating DUSMs had been extremely aggressive
in nature, with a "barrage of gunfire" having been directed
at them.  The situation was so sever that these USMs, who
were specially trained, were afraid to move.  They were
located in a remote area of rugged terrain, which was well
known to the subjects.  The family of Randy Weaver was
armed, including his children.  It was unknown whether the
surviving DUSM's were still receiving fire and it was not
known whether the subjects had reinforcements, were
in the Weaver cabin, in the woods near the cabin, or whether
they had escaped.  Because of Randy Weaver's military
background, it was believed that the subjects may have built
tunnels and bunkers, making any approach to the area
exceedingly dangerous. [FN475]<p>  Rogers was notified of the decision to deploy and
immediately departed aboard an FBI aircraft.  The Strategic
Information and Operations Center ("SIOC") at FBI Headquarters
was activated and other routine investigative steps were
instituted.  The Special Operations and Research Unit ("SOARS")
in Quantico was notified to provide negotiators.<p> Neither Potts nor Coulson had any
discussions with persons
from the Department of Justice, outside the FBI or the United
States Marshals Service, regarding their decision to activate the
HRT until after the decision had been made.  That evening Gow
discussed the trouble the FBI was having in getting HRT
transportation to the crisis site with Attorney General Barr, who
appeared to know about the situation.  They discussed the "red
tape" preventing the transportation of the main body of the HRT
to Idaho. [FN476]<p><H4>c.   Initial Intelligence Gathering and
Rescue of the Marshals</H4><p>HRT commander Rogers departed for Idaho at approximately
6:30 p.m. EDT on August 21 with an advance team of HRT personnel,
including Supervisory Special Agent Stephen McGavin, and Special
Agents Lester B. Hazen and Dale F. Carnegie, accompanied by
Marshals Service Deputy Director Duke Smith.<p>     Potts had instructed Rogers to
advise Coulson immediately
after an on-site assessment had been made.  Potts knew that the
Idaho State Police SWAT Team was on the scene, but Potts would
not authorize them to rescue the surviving marshals until an FBI
on scene evaluation of the mission had been made.  The Marshals
Service had not been authorized to conduct tactical operations
and, as far as Potts knew, they were involved only in perimeter
assignments given by the FBI.  When the first FBI personnel
arrived at the crisis site, Potts was advised that no shots had
been fired for some time and that communications with the
surviving marshals would make it possible to locate them.<p>Captain David Neal,
Commander of the Idaho State Police CRT,
was informed of the incident and proceeded to the command post at
the RAU meadow.  After a briefing from Hunt, Neal decided that
the CRT would wait until nightfall to rescue the marshals so as
to avoid ambush by the Weavers. [FN477]<p> A ten man CRT team, along with Deputy Marshal
Thomas, left
the command post at approximately 8:30 p.m. PDT (11:30 p.m. EDT).
[FN478]  The night was "pitch," and only two member of the team had
night vision equipment.  The others made their way by placing
their hands on the person in front of them and forming a
chain.[FN479]  They proceeded slowly and with extreme caution for
fear of being ambushed or encountering booby traps.  At 11:21
p.m. PDT, the team reached the marshals at the Y.  When Captain
Neal arrived at the Y he was concerned about the security of the
CRT team and asked Roderick for an update.  The first thing
Roderick told Neal was, "I shot the dog." [FN480]<p>The CRT team secured Degan's body
and headed down the
mountain.  The return was long and difficult due to the extreme
darkness and the burden of Degan's body.  They returned to the
Command Post and 12:46 a.m. PDT.<p> Earlier that day, Marshal Jurgensen had been
dispatched to
Idaho to render assistance.  When the marshals were rescued, he
accompanied the five marshals to a hospital at Bonners Ferry,
Idaho. [FN481]  The marshals kept their weapons because of reports
that Weaver supporters were on their way to the hospital. [FN482]
They were examined briefly at the hospital and then released.
Thereafter, Jurgensen drove the marshals to the condominium at
Schwaitzer Mountain, where they arrived at approximately 3:00
a.m.  By this time, Roderick, Cooper, Thomas, Norris and Hunt had
been awake nearly 24 hours.  After awhile, they went to sleep.
[FN483]<p>Jurgenson collected the marshals' weapons and counted the
ammunition.  From this inspection, he determined that Hunt,
Norris, and Thomas had not fired any shots; Roderick had fired
one shot from his M16 rifle; Cooper had fired six shots from the
.9mm; and seven shots had been fired from Degan's weapon. [FN484]<p> Meanwhile, while en
route to Idaho, Smith briefed Rogers and
the other HRT personnel on the Weaver case.  Rogers had seen a
photograph of the crisis area, which Smith described as an
isolated area of extremely rugged terrain.  According to Rogers,
Smith provided the following background on the family:<p>
[G.J.]<p> Rogers also testified at trial about the impression of the
crisis that Smith conveyed:<p>Smith said the aggression was on the part of the members
of
the Weaver family and that Degan....and the others were
actually pursued while attempting to retreat from Randall
Weaver and Kevin Harris and after being observed by those
subjects.....He told me that the family was heavily
armed, they had both pistols and rifles. There was an
indication that they might possibly.....have some armor-
piercing ammunition.  It was unclear as to whether there
were grenades or explosives, because of Mr. Weaver's
background in the military....I certainly had the
impression that this was a heavily armed group, and based on
what he had told me concerning the fire-fight breaking out
and Marshal Degan dying, it was clear to me that they were
willing to use these weapons. [FN486]<p>Smith related Weaver's threats that a standoff
would only
end in his death, and explained that the Weaver family had
threatened other law enforcement officials on numerous occasions.
In response to letters about the pending charges, he stated that
the Weavers asserted that Randy was not coming down willingly.
Both Randy and Vicki Weaver had commented at an initial
appearance that any attempts to arrest them would result in the
deaths of law enforcement officers.  Randy Weaver had told a
local reporter that he would not come off the mountain. The
Weavers sent letters to both state and federal court officials
regarding Randy Weaver's unwillingness to face charges.  Smith
also reported that Weaver had been a Green Beret and had
expertise in the manufacture of explosives and booby traps.  He
described the Weaver compound as a mountain stronghold,
inaccessible except by a single extremely rough road, and
protected by fighting positions.  Smith reported that TV show
host Geraldo Rivera had unsuccessfully attempted to interview
Weaver and that there were unconfirmed reports that Weaver had
fired at Rivera's helicopter. [FN487]<p>
[G.J.]<p>
[G.J.]<p>Rogers said that it was his impression that a firefight was
either "still in progress" or there was "intermittent gunfire
taking place" or "sporadic gunfire . . . through the evening".
He believed that the marshals were still on the mountain and that
they could not extract Degan's body. [FN489]  Rogers considered the
subjects to be potentially still in an offensive, aggressive
mode, and he concluded that the situation was dangerous with the
potential for additional violence. [FN490]<p>  Potts and Coulson relayed to Glenn the
information about the
crisis situation that the Marshals Service had provided.  Prior
to Glenn's arrival Hunt had briefed two FBI agents who had
responded to the call for assistance.  He gave them information
on the Weaver family and Kevin Harris, an overview of the
morning's events, and a description of Weaver's tactical
operations and defensive positions.  Hunt told them that Weaver
and the others had pulled back to their defensive positions and
were preparing for and awaiting the arrival of government agents.
Hunt also briefed local law enforcement officials. [FN491]<p>These were the only times
that Hunt was asked for
information, with one exception.  Late in the evening of August
21, Hunt was summoned to the command post and asked for the best
position for sniper/observers.  Hunt identified the high ground
overlooking the Weaver compound and located it on a map.  He was
surprised that he was not asked additional questions.  The FBI
did not inquire about the intelligence he had collected during
the early hours of the response.  However, Idaho State Police and
others retrieved his case files, including surveillance photos
and topographic maps, from the Marshals Service command post.
Hunt was frustrated that his files were disassembled and
distributed without his consent.<p>When Special Agent in Charge Eugene Glenn arrived in
Sandpoint, Idaho, about 7:00 p.m.(PDT), deputies from the
Boundary County Sheriff's Office took him and members of the Salt
Lake SWAT Team and Technical Agents to a National Guard Armory to
be briefed by law enforcement personnel.  Deputy Sheriff Lonnie
Ekstrom told Glenn that Randy Weaver was a violent, former Green
Beret and explosives expert, who reportedly had a large cache of
arms concealed on his property.  Because of Weaver's political
and religious beliefs, he had separated himself from the
community and was living off the land.  Weaver was said to have
constructed bunkers and fortifications around his home and
claimed he wanted to have a show down or last stand with the
federal government.  Ekstrom told Glenn that Weaver had stated he
would never be taken off the mountain and in fact had not come
down for nearly 18 months. [FN492]<p>  Glenn was told that Weaver was with at least one
or two other
people who may also have been present during the exchange of
gunfire.  He was told that these people, as well as Weaver's
entire family, were committed to similar religious and political
beliefs, such as white separatism and supremacism and an intense
hatred of the federal government. [FN493]<p>  Following this briefing, Glenn travelled
to the Command Post
at Ruby Ridge, arriving at approximately 9:30 p.m. (PDT).
Special Agent Wages told Glenn that it was believed that Randy
Weaver, Vicki Weaver, their children, and at least one additional
individual, Kevin Harris, were in the cabin. [FN494] Glenn began to
solicit information from Idaho State Police Major Edwin
Strickfaden, who was commanding the "predominant agency on site"
and other "senior personnel from all of the major agencies at the
scene."[FN495]  Those personnel included the U.S. Marshal for Idaho,
Michael Johnson, and Boundary County Deputy Sheriff, Lonnie
Ekstrom.<p>Glenn described the shooting incident to Special Agent in
Charge William Gore, who arrived at the command post
approximately 45 minutes after Glenn.  Gore joined Glenn at the
briefing, then in progress with the Idaho State Police, Boundary
County Sheriff, and Marshals Service personnel.  They learned
that the Marshals Service was reporting that Kevin Harris may
have been shot during the shootout.  There was a report that the
marshals still on the mountain had received sporadic gunfire
until after dark. [FN496]<p>U.S. Marshal Johnson provided information about BATF's
investigation of Weaver, his arrest, failure to appear, and the
entry of the Marshals Service into the case.  Weaver was
described as a "white supremacist who had been affiliated with
the Aryan Nation." [FN497]<p> In spite of the fact that the marshals were rescued in the
early morning hours of August 22, first-hand information about
the incident which began the crisis was not gathered immediately
because the marshals were not made available until 2:00 p.m.
Glenn reported that he "did not have the opportunity" earlier on
to speak with any of the marshals who had been on the hill.  He
"wanted access to them but the USMS denied this request in order
to give the Deputies time to compose themselves after their
ordeal."[FN498]<p> Glenn learned that first night that a cold front was
approaching, with rain, snow, and temperatures in and around the
twenties, and that the terrain around the crisis site was severe.
There was no current intelligence as to the tactical preparations
the Weavers might be making to engage law enforcement, but Glenn
knew that agents would have to take positions close to Weaver's
residence to address the situation properly.  Glenn believed that
Weaver was aware that he had been involved in killing a federal
law enforcement officer and that he was intentionally resisting
arrest.  Glenn was concerned about possible reinforcements from
the ranks of Weaver's supporters.<p> Because of the information he had gathered and his
understanding of the capabilities of someone with military
training ascribed to Weaver, Glenn was seriously concerned for
the safety of personnel at the scene.  He saw Weaver as someone
"trained in the tactics of escape and evasion, who had now chosen
to fortify himself and remain at his cabin, when he could have
effected an escape from capture."  Glenn thought that he was
"facing an individual who may have made considerable prior
arrangements to inflict serious casualties or damage on any
individual(s) who may attempt to challenge him."[FN499]  Therefore,
he decided that no aggressive effort should be made to attempt to
arrest the subjects until additional tactical resources arrived.<p>  The goal to this
point was to stabilize the situation,
avoiding contact with the Weavers until the situation had been
contained.  With the arrival of the HRT, Glenn believed it was
possible for the FBI to establish a perimeter around the Weaver
cabin to assess the situation and establish communications with
the cabin.  Glenn thought those steps were necessary to resolve
the situation peacefully through negotiations. [FN500]<p> By early morning, August 22,
HRT Commander Rogers and the
HRT advance unit had arrived, along with senior Marshals Service
personnel.  Rogers reported Glenn:<p>I asked Mr. Glenn for a quick briefing as to what
the
current situation was up on the mountain.  He told me
that they had managed to get Marshal Degan's body off
and extricate the remaining marshals.  Other than that,
it was basically unknown what was taking place up
around the cabin, because there were no law enforcement
directly with eyes on at the shooting site or at the
Weaver cabin. [FN501]<p> Rogers knew that the firefight was not continuing, [FN504]
but this did not change his opinion of the danger. [FN505]<p> [G.J]<p> Like Glenn and
Gore, Rogers did not talk to any of the
marshals involved in the shooting because he had been told that
they were asleep or were being treated for exposure. According
to Rogers, the "implication" of this report "was that they were
not available to me and that they would certainly have to be
debriefed before I would have a chance to talk to them...
debriefed I assumed by their own marshals." [FN507]<p> Although Rogers had not
definitively concluded that Weaver
had shot at a federal officer, he had concluded that Weaver
"clearly demonstrated that he was willing to shoot at federal
officers," in spite of the fact that he knew of no one who had
seen Weaver shoot or point a gun at anybody. [FN508]<p>The next Morning, Tony Perez
spoke by telephone to Cooper,
Roderick, and Norris and received "bits and fragments' of
information. [FN509] Duke Smith, Deputy Director of Operations
and the highest ranking Marshal Service official at the scene,
visited to offer emotional support. Smith did not interview the
marshals , and he received only a few details of the shooting.
[FN510] The marshals told Smith that Harris had shot Degan, that
Cooper may have killed Harris, and that Roderick shot the dog
after the gunfire had started. [FN511] One of the marshals
mentioned that Sammy Weaver was present, but there was no
evidence that he had been injured. Smith spent approximately 30
minutes at the condominium. [FN512]<p> Jurgensen drove Cooper, Roderick, and Hunt to the
Boundary
County Sheriff's Office for interviews by the FBI later that
day. Thomas and Norris were interviewed the following day.
[FN513]<p>After the interviews, Cooper and Roderick went to the
staging area by the Rau house. They offered their assistance to
John Haynes and Lou Stagg of SOG, but were told that their help
was not needed. [FN514]<p> Cooper and Roderick informed HRT members about the layout
of the Weaver complex, the terrain, and weaponry. They told the
HRT that there were no booby traps or mines on the Weaver
property. After that short debriefing, no one consulted with
Cooper and Roderick again. [FN515]<p>  Duke Smith recalled Jurgensen telling him that
the deputy
marshals had been to the Boundary County Hospital for physical
checkups and then taken to their command post condominium at
Shweitzer Mountain. Smith recalled that Jurgensen had asked him
to postpone his visit with the five marshals, who had been part
of the August 21 team, until the afternoon of August 22. When
Smith went to the command post that afternoon, Deputy Marshals
Cooper and Roderick spoke to him about their mission but he did
not formally interview them or debrief them. [FN516] Smith said
the marshals were available to the FBI at all times and the
marshals even came to the site on Saturday and Sunday. Smith
told this inquiry that he never restricted access to the
marshals for intelligence purposes. [FN517]<p><H3>3. Discussion</H3><p><H4>a. The
Marshals' Report of the Shooting</H4><p> There have been allegations that the marshals
involved in
the shooting and others in the Marshals Service intentionally
concealed the marshals' role in the August 21 shooting. It has
also been charged that the Marshals Service lied about Weaver's
dangerousness and the circumstances at the time of the shooting
to gain the FBI's support and assistance and to cover up a
confrontation with the Weavers' son, Sammy.<p>At trial, the defense contended that a
deputy marshal had
fired the first shot, which killed the family dog Striker.
After that shot a marshal knowingly and fatally shot Sammy
Weaver in the back as he retreated from the firefight. The
defense also contended that Sammy Weaver responded to the
killing of his dog with gunfire, which Degan returned, and that
Harris shot Degan in defense of himself and Sammy only after
these events had occurred and because they were subjected to
gunfire.<p> Those who believe that sequence of events, particularly
after Weaver and Harris' acquittal for Degan's murder, have
charged that the marshals involved in the shooting engaged in a
coverup to protect themselves. That coverup is said to have
included exaggerated accounts of aggressive acts at the shootout
on August 21, Weaver's role in the events, and the danger of
Weaver and Harris. One area repeatedly challenged at trial was
the claim that the marshals were "pinned down" and had sustained
"continuing fire" hours after the fatal shots had been fired.
[FN518]<p> Defense counsel alleged in pretrial motions that after the
shooting at the Y, Hunt falsely reported to his superiors and to
other law enforcement agencies that the marshals who remained
with Degan's body were "pinned down in a fire fight." [FN519] We
did not find any evidence that Hunt or any of the marshals
claimed that they were receiving continual fire well after the
exchange at the Y.<p>The debate focuses on Hunt's use of the phrase "pinned
down." This inquiry has determined that "pinned down" is not a
term of art in law enforcement with a universally accepted
meaning. Although Hunt used the words "pinned down" in his
first call for help to the Boundary County Sheriff's Office
shortly after the shooting, he also repeatedly advised Marshal
Service Headquarters as the day progressed that there was no
"continuing fire fight." Less than an hour after his first call
for help, Hunt notified his superiors at Marshal Service
Headquarters that the marshals were not receiving continual
fire. He also reported this to other law enforcement officers
arriving at the scene. [FN520]<p>Officials from many different law enforcement agencies
were told throughout the remainder of the day that the marshals
were "pinned down." [FN521] If they concluded that the marshals
were under constant fire, that was the result, in our view, of
miscommunication or misunderstanding. [FN522] Hunt's reports to
the Crisis Center are consistent with the accounts given by the
marshals on the mountain. They believed they were "pinned down"
in the sense that they were "outflanked" by the Weavers and
might come under fire if they moved. [FN523] We conclude that
the marshals did not deliberately attempt to mislead other law
enforcement agencies about the events at the Y or the condition
of the marshals still on the mountain.<p> <H4>b. Decision to Deploy the HRT</H4><p>Our
investigation found that the HRT was properly deployed
to Idaho to address this crisis, a deployment, which, in
accordance with FBI policy, had received specific approval from
the Assistant director of the Criminal Investigative Division at
FBI Headquarters.<p>The training of HRT members and its ability to be deployed
quickly made HRT a reasonable choice in this instance.<p>Furthermore, jurisdiction for
the investigation of assaults on
federal officers ("AFO") rests with the FBI. Although this
began as a Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms case and
became a Marshals Service case, the Marshals Service does not
have primary jurisdiction for investigating AFOs. In addition,
Marshals Service supervisors were understandably concerned that
action by the Marshals Service would appear to have been taken
in retaliation.<p>The federal law enforcement response to the crisis at Ruby
Ridge has been seen by some as an inappropriate insertion of the
federal government into a local matter, which would have been
better left to the state and local authorities to resolve. In
particular, the federal government has been criticized for
overreacting and overwhelming the area. As evidence of the
ability of local and state forces to have handled the crisis, we
not the rapid response they made to the stranded marshals and
the successful night rescue.<p>Various state and local law enforcement agencies were
included in the early stages of intelligence gathering, and they
played a continuing critical role in controlling the perimeter
and keeping the peace during this controversial siege. However,
it appears that they were not part of strategy and planning
sessions as the siege continued.<p>We can understand the opinion that Idaho State and
local
law enforcement should have led the efforts to resolve the
crisis. However, it appears this is an after-the-fact view of
events. Arguably, if the federal government had not responded
to the crisis at Ruby Ridge, that inaction would also have been
criticized. This situation had been generated by a federal
warrant based on a federal indictment involving federal law
enforcement agencies. In attempting to effectuate a federal
arrest, a federal officer had been killed, and the subjects of
that shooting and the outstanding warrant remained at large. In
light of these circumstances and the resources available to the
federal response teams, we find reasonable and appropriate the
decision to send FBI SWAT teams, the HRT, and the Marshals
Service SOG to resolve this matter.<p><H4>c. Initial Intelligence Gathering</H4><p> In
this section we discuss what the FBI did in the first
36 hours to verify the information it had obtained and to secure
the best and most current information. Our investigation
addressed criticism concerning the failure of Special Agent in
Charge Glenn and HRT Commander Richard Rogers during their first
hours at the site to update intelligence from more knowledgeable
people present.<p> Almost within hours of setting up the command centers at
Marshal Service Crisis Center and FBI Headquarters, both
agencies had representatives at each other's command centers to
aid communication. [FN524] The Crisis Center log reflects
regular communications with the FBI SIOC. Although efforts to
facilitate communications were made at Headquarters, we did not
find intelligence gathering at the site to have been
sufficiently thorough under the circumstances. Although Glenn
spoke with the heads of the agencies at the scene, there were
gaps in Glenn and Rogers' information about the underlying
events caused by their failure to debrief the marshals involved
in the shootout.<p>
  We not specifically Glenn's failure to discuss the
situation with Deputy Marshal Hunt, who had been present at the
command post until the marshals and Degan's body had been
rescued from the mountain. Hunt had been the primary source of
information to Marshal Service Headquarters throughout the day,
and he was the link with the other marshals who had been
eyewitnesses to the day's events. Moreover, Hunt had been the
lead case agent in Boise since 1991 and would have been the most
valuable resource for information on the Weavers background and
their circumstances.<p> Rogers and Glenn also failed to discuss the situation with
the other marshals at the site the next day. During this
inquiry, we reviewed a videotape made at the site during Hunt's
second briefing at the command post. The briefing contained
valuable information based on intelligence the Marshals Service
and especially Hunt had gathered over many months of
surveillance. Significantly, Glenn admitted that when he was
formulating the operational plan and Rules of Engagement, he was
unaware that the Marshals Service had been on numerous missions
to Ruby Ridge before August 21. [FN525]<p> When questioned about the failure to
interview the
marshals, Glenn asserted that they were not made available after
his arrival. We find little support for this assertion. Duke
Smith, who had arrived with Rogers and was at the command site
most of the day, knew where the marshals were. We found no
evidence that anyone denied the FBI access to the marshals after
they had been taken to the hospital and allowed to rest. In
fact, the marshals felt ignored by those who had taken command.
This feeling may have been justified.<p>This inquiry also considered whether the
Marshals Service
tried to prepare the marshals for their interviews. FBI agents
assigned to interview the marshals had been told to expect them
the morning after the shooting. However, the marshals did not
arrive until later in the day. Deputy Marshal Jurgensen, who
had been ordered to look after the marshals once they were off
the mountain, was not notified that the marshals were scheduled
for interviews on Saturday morning. [FN526] We are satisfied
that there was no impropriety regarding the timing of the
marshals' appearance.<p>We also find no evidence that the marshals were coached
before their interviews. We note that the marshals were kept
together for several hours before giving their statements. We
question the wisdom of keeping the marshals together at the
condominium for several hours, while awaiting interviews with
the FBI. Isolating them in that manner created the appearance
and generated allegations that they were fabricating stories and
colluding to coverup the true circumstances of the shootings at
the Y. These allegations could have been avoided by separating
the witnesses until their interviews and debriefings. However,
we acknowledge that security and health interests may have made
such an arrangement appear necessary on the first evening
following the rescue. However, this investigation has found no
proof that the Marshals Service or the marshals themselves
coordinated or altered their individual accounts of the events
on the mountain. Certainly, there are enough differences in the
marshals' statements to diffuse an accusation of collusion.<p>Although the marshals had
lengthy interviews on Saturday
and Sunday with FBI agents and returned to the command post on
Saturday and Sunday, none of them were interviewed by the FBI
senior management team of Glenn, Rogers, or Fred Lanceley, the
FBI's chief negotiator at the scene. In fact, Lanceley was not
aware of the FBI interviews of the marshals until days later.
It is not clear when the information developed in these
interviews was shared with Glenn and Rogers.<p>This inquiry found no misrepresentation
of the status of
the marshals as they remained on the mountain. Glenn and FBI
Headquarters knew that there had been no gunfire after the
original shooting, with the exception of shots at a passing
aircraft. The term "pinned down" was not understood or intended
to indicate the marshals were taking continuous fire. [FN527]<p>It is difficult to
estimate the impact additional
intelligence gathering would have had on the decisions made
during the crisis. Much of the information the FBI considered
in assessing the danger and formulating Rules of Engagement and
operational plans was consistent with what they would have heard
from the marshals.<p>Marshals Service Headquarters files contained information
from BATF and other sources during the threat assessment and the
eighteen-month fugitive investigation by the Marshals Service.
The files included information about Weaver's military
experience, his stockpiling of weapons and ammunition, the
arming of the Weaver family, his Aryan Nations affiliation, and
his refusal to surrender. We found the background information
on Weaver, which the Marshals Service have the FBI and which
served as a basis for the HRT deployment and the development of
plans to secure the site, consistent with the information that
was available in the Marshals Service files before August 21.<p><H3>4.
Conclusion</H3><p>We found no evidence that the Marshals Service
intentionally covered up or exaggerated Weaver's background or
the events that had occurred at the Y in order to obtain
assistance from other law enforcement personnel. However, we
did find that the initial intelligence gathering by the FBI
lacked thoroughness because of its failure early in the crisis
to seek information from the Marshals Service personnel who had
been ion the mountain on August 21. Finally, this inquiry found
that there was no abuse of discretion in the activation of the
HRT in this situation. It was legally and factually justified
and consistent with department of Justice policy and procedures.
No evidence was discovered during this inquiry that the decision
to deploy HRT was based on improper or personal motives.<p><hr><p>Released through

contained some errors, such as a statement in paragraph 4 that
the marshals "were fired upon by two or more individuals in a
pickup truck."  Affidavit of Warren Mays, August 22, 1992.  Howen
thought that this information had come to Mays directly from
Hunt.  When Howen had left Boise for Ruby Ridge, he asked
Assistant U.S. Attorney Haws to complete the affidavit.  Haws
took no steps to confirm the information because he thought that
Howen had corrected any factual inaccuracies.  Almost immediately
after the affidavit was transmitted to Howen, he told Haws that
paragraph 4 was in error.  Howen and Haw corrected the error in
the next affidavit they filed on August 23, 1992.  Howen

Service first learned of the shooting when Deputy Marshal hunt
called Marshals Service headquarters in Washington, DC  The first
entry in the Marshals Service Crisis Center Log noted:  "The
initial reports indicate that the USMS surveillance team came
under fire from occupants of the Weaver compound and are still
pinned down in defensive positions."  Entry for August 21, 1992,
at 2:40 p.m. (EDT).  Soon thereafter the log states: "The rest
of the team is still located on the mountain, but not under fire,
unable to withdraw without exposing themselves to hostile fire."
Id. at 3:05 p.m. (EDT).  This was confirmed one hour later:
"USMS personnel on mountain are not taking additional fire and
detect substantial movement in the woods around them."  Id. at

The HRT is comprised of approximately 50 members with specialized
skills and training.  The HRT has been utilized in a variety of
high risk situations since its formation in 1993, ranging from
international antiterrorist operations to prison uprisings,
arrest/search operations against white separatist organizations,
and hostage situations.<p>

Coulson viewed HRT as well suited for crises of this sort
because:<p>
The HRT could better function in such a severe environment,
and was highly trained in winter and rural operations.  The
HRT can deploy a sophisticated communications system,
including satellite communication, which would be necessary
in this remote rural mountainous environment.  The HRT also
provides and deploys with medical support which would be a
necessity in such a dangerous operation . . . . FBI field
office SWAT Teams could not have enough personnel to handle
a situation such as this.<p>
Coulson Sworn Statement, November 3, 1993, at 7.<p>
     476 Gow recalled that an earlier agreement with the military
to provide transportation for HRT had expired and that the
current arrangement was for the military to provide
transportation on an "as needed" basis.  Gow Sworn Statement, at

[W]ithin a few minutes of their return, the rescued
marshals were whisked away from the area of the command
post to a location unknown by me.  The decision to
remove the marshals involved in the shooting was made
by the Marshals Service.  I did not have an opportunity

had been debriefed for benefit of intelligence purposes
with respect to the shooting and related events that
day.<p>

when Rogers testified that he did not know who David Hunt was
nor did he know the identity of the source who had provided
information about the previous day's events to Marshals Service
Headquarters and Smith. Rogers Trial Testimony, June 2, 1993,
at 189-90. Rogers also admitted during cross examination at
trial that he had no information as to who killed Degan and that
he had never spoken to Cooper or Roderick during his entire stay
at Ruby Ridge.<p>
   508 Rogers assumed that Glenn had received his information
from marshals on the scene and, therefore, did not inquire about
the source or validity of the information.<p>

   512 Smith Sworn Statement, at 6. Smith told the marshals

of business." Cooper Sworn Statement, at 12; Roderick Sworn
Statement (draft), at 29; Norris Sworn Statement, at 14-15.
Thomas reported that Smith said that he had spoken with his FBI
counterpart, who advised Smith that "this was not going to last
long. That it was going to be 'taken down hard and fast'."
Thomas Sworn Statement, at 15.<p>
   513 FBI agents had been told to expect the marshals at the
Boundary County Sheriff's Office on Saturday morning, August 22.
Hunt, Roderick and Cooper were not brought to the Sheriff's
Office until that afternoon. FD-302 Interview of Gregory
Rampton, October 18 & 19, 1993, at 3; FD-302 Interview of
Timothy Kroupa, October 19, 1993, at 2.<p>
   514 Roderick Sworn Statement (draft), at 30. Cooper reported
that Haynes "blew me off," saying, "I've already heard your
story." Cooper Sworn Statement, at 12-13.<p>
  On August 23, Cooper reviewed a draft report of his
interview and found it full of inaccuracies. For instance, the
draft stated that Cooper saw a second man chasing the marshals
in the fern field, that Cooper saw Randy Weaver at the "Y" after
Harris shot Degan, and that Cooper saw Harris running up the
trail toward Weaver's cabin. Cooper asked that the draft be
corrected. Because this had not been done when Cooper returned
from Degan's funeral, Cooper dictated the FD-302 himself. Id.
at 13.<p>
   515 Roderick Sworn Statement (draft), at 30.<p>
   516 Cooper and Roderick told Smith that Degan was shot by
Harris after Degan announced "U.S. Marshals." Cooper thought he
shot Harris because he saw Harris go down and never saw him
again. Roderick returned fire and shot the dog and both
mentioned they had seen Randy Weaver coming down the other
trail. Roderick told Smith how he took a round through his
shirt and that there were a lot of incoming rounds. Weaver had
turned and gone back up the hill after the initial shots. One
of the marshals mentioned seeing Sammy Weaver but there was no
mention of him being injured in the gun fight. Smith Sworn
Statement, January 6, 1994, at 6.<p>
   517 Id. at 8.<p>
   518 Briefly, our investigation found no intentional
exaggeration of facts or a failure to disclose material facts.
Moreover, we were unable to find any material representations
made to FBI Headquarters which were unsupported by information
in Marshals Service files. In our interviews, FBI Headquarters
personnel and Marshals Service personnel did not report any
significant incorrect information on the status of the marshals
on the mountain, in contrast to media reports on the subject.<p>
   519 Defendants' Memorandum, at 8-10.<p>
   520 For instance, FBI Special Agent Larry Wages arrived at
approximately 3:30 p.m. He had the impression from Hunt that
the stranded marshals were "pinned down," though he does not
recall whether Hunt used those words. He understood from Hunt
that the marshals were not in an ongoing firefight. Wages
surmised that anyone trying to approach the stranded marshals
might receive gunfire. He also believed that the marshals could
have come down had they been willing to leave Degan's body.
Wages did not hear gunfire during his stay at the Rau field.
FD-302 Interview of Larry Wages, November 29, 1993, at 2; McGill
FD-302, at 3 (dispatcher notes time of Wages' arrival).<p>
  Sgt. Michael R. Nauman, a member of the Idaho State Police
team that rescued the marshals, said that he knew during the
rescue that no shots had been fired for several hours. He
believed the marshals "felt they were pinned down because they
did not know where Harris and Weaver were and believed that
[Harris and Weaver] were watching their position." FD-302 of
Sgt. Michael R. Nauman, October 7, 1993, at 2.<p>
   521 For example, at approximately 12:17 p.m.. (PDT), Perez
told Kenneth E. Neu, Acting Chief of the FBI Fugitive Unit, that
"the marshals were still on the mountain and were pinned down by
gunfire." FD-302 Interview of Kenneth Neu, November 5, 1993.
This was more than a half hour after Hunt advised the Crisis
Center that marshals were "no longer taking fire." Crisis
Center Log, August 21, 1992, at 11:40 a.m. PDT.<p>
   522 Twomey said that communications were bad and that it was
"virtually impossible to get accurate information." Twomey FD
-302, at 5. Hudson said that in the early hours of the crisis,
"CNN appeared to obtain information faster than the Crisis
Center or FBIHQ." Hudson FD-302, at 6.<p>

<H3>IV. SPECIFIC ISSUES INVESTIGATED</H3> <p> <h3> F. FBI's Rules of Engagement and
Operations on August 21 and
August 22, 1992 </H3> <p>
  <h3>1. Introduction</H3>  <p>The issues addressed in this part of our inquiry concern
the
initial response to the crisis by law enforcement agencies
directed by the FBI and the decisions made to resolve the
crisis. <p>
  During the early hours of the crisis, in addition to the
movement of personnel and equipment, the primary concerns were
to stabilize the situation and to gather intelligence. 
Throughout this early period, FBI officials were formulating a
proposed plan of action -- also referred to as an "operation
plan" or "operational plan" -- and specialized "Rules of
Engagement" ("Rules"). <p>  It has been alleged that during this initial period
negotiations were ignored as a strategy and that only tactical
responses were considered. Indeed, the FBI has been criticized
for its failure to contact the occupants of the Weaver residence
until Saturday evening, after the sniper shots had been fired
and Vicki Weaver had been killed. We have been told by observers
on the scene that law enforcement personnel made statements that
the matter would be handled quickly and that the situation would
be "taken down hard and fast." [FN528] Some individuals have
contended that the helicopter flights over the Weaver compound
were designed to lure the subjects out so that they could be
targets for the snipers who were under orders to shoot and kill
armed adult men. <p>Furthermore, it has been alleged that the FBI's operations
plan and Rules of Engagement were developed to eliminate
witnesses to the shootout on August 21 in retaliation for the
death of Deputy Marshal Degan. Of particular concern are the
Rules of Engagement, which instructed the FBI Hostage Rescue
Team ("HRT") sniper/observers that they "can and should" use
deadly force against any armed adult male, even before a
surrender announcement had been made to the subjects or notice
given that law enforcement was present. The Rules have been
interpreted as unlawful "orders to shoot" by their severest
critics and as being inappropriate for the situation or being
unartfully drafted by others. It has been charged that the Rules
used at Ruby Ridge were orders to shoot, which violated federal
and state law and the FBI's own standard policy on the use of
deadly force. <p> In this section we examine the factors considered in the
formulation of the Rules and the reasonableness of some of these
considerations, including the belief that the Weaver/Harris
group was aware of law enforcement's presence and that every
armed individual in the Weaver compound intended to cause bodily
harm to law enforcement personnel. We also examine the intent of
those who reviewed and approved the Rules and whether the Rules
and the procedures used to develop and authorize their use
conformed with FBI policy. <p>Finally, we evaluate those who operated under the Rules of
Engagement and the actions they took while at Ruby Ridge. This
portion of the report examines the circumstances surrounding the
two rifle shots fired by HRT member Lon Horiuchi on August 22,
1992 and whether the ensuing death and injuries were the result
of lawful acts. <p>
<h3>  2. Statement of Facts </H3> <p><H4>a. The Formulation of Rules of engagement En
Route to Idaho
on August 21, 1992</H4> <p> When FBI tactical teams, such as HRT or SWAT, are deployed
and
confrontations are a possibility, Rules of Engagement are
commonly established. Rules of Engagement are described as
instructions to deployed units or individuals that clearly
indicate what action should be taken when confronted,
threatened, or fired upon by someone. They are intended to
provide a context within which decisions about the use of deadly
force are to be made. They serve two purposes: to restrict the
application of the standard FBI deadly force policy or to
heighten the awareness of tactical personnel regarding the
threat level of individual situations. Formulation and approval
of the Rules of Engagement are the responsibility of the on-
scene commander. [FN529] <p> The need for special Rules of Engagement for the Ruby Ridge
crisis was discussed and agreed upon at an early point. While
en route to Northern Idaho, Richard Rogers, Commander of the
HRT, and Assistant Director Larry Potts had a series of
conversations in which Potts advised Rogers of intelligence
received. [FN530] <p>
  [G.J.] <p>
  [G.J.] <p>
  [FN531] <p> Rogers explained his initial thoughts about the Rules of
Engagement: <p> In this particular situation, after hearing the description of
what had taken place, specifically the fire-fight, the loss of a
marshal, it was clear to me that there was a shooting situation
taking place at this location. It appeared to me that it would
have been irresponsible for me to send my agents into the
situation without at least giving them a set of rules within the
greater framework of the standard FBI rules, that would allow
them to defend themselves. With that in mind, I proposed that
the rules be that if any adult is seen with a weapon in the
vicinity of where this fire-fight took place, of the Weaver
cabin, that this individual could be the subject of deadly
force... [A]ny child is going to come under standard FBI rules,
meaning that if an FBI agent is threatened with death or some
other innocent is threatened with death by a child, then clearly
that agent could use a weapon to shoot the child... that's the
way it's stated, but quite frankly, we try to prevent ourselves
from being put in positions where children can threaten us and
where we would have to use deadly force. [FN532] <p> When asked if he had considered the
possibility that an adult
might be seen with a weapon slung on his shoulder or carried in
a nonoffensive way, Rogers replied: <p>Yes, it was considered, and it's always my
knowledge that my
sniper observers and my other team members are clearly going to
make a judgmental call as to whether to employ deadly force, and
based upon the training, based upon the experience of these men,
I know that they have absolutely the best judgment when it comes
to use of deadly force. [FN533] <p>Rogers acknowledged that the Rules of Engagement he
proposed
specified that any adult with a weapon observed in the vicinity
of the Weaver cabin or in the firefight area "could and should
be the subject of deadly force." [FN534] According to Rogers he
discussed this rule with FBI Assistant Director Larry Potts who
concurred fully. [FN535] <p>
  [G.J.] [FN536] <p>Potts considered the information provided by the Marshals
Service to be the basis of the proposed Rules of Engagement. He
recalled the proposed Rules of Engagement as providing that: <p>Any adult with a weapon
who was observed in the vicinity of
Randall Weaver's cabin or the fire fight area, COULD be the
subject of deadly force. All efforts should be made to avoid any
confrontation with children, but if such a confrontation became
unavoidable, that faced with the threat of death or grievous
bodily harm, the standard FBI use of deadly force policy would
be in effect. [FN537] <p>According to Potts, he and Coulson believed that this crisis
was the most dangerous situation into which the HRT had ever
gone. Potts recalled that: <p>I was extremely fearful of sustaining casualties while
attempting to establish a perimeter at the crisis site, since 
the subjects possessed every tactical advantage. I was concerned
that the subjects had been reinforced by others, and I 
considered every armed adult in the vicinity of the Weaver 
cabin to be potentially hostile and a threat to HRT personnel.
I believed that Randy Weaver knew that a warrant existed for
him, and knew a DUSM had been killed, he would have known that
law enforcement personnel would be in the vicinity. I was also
concerned that the deceased DUSM may not have made and immediate
determination of the threat and had lost his life as a result... <p> These ROE were
established to assist the HRT personnel in
making a determination regarding what constituted a threat to
them in this extraordinary circumstance. The ROE were not
intended to supersede the FBI standard deadly force policy. The
final determination regarding such implementation of deadly
force must always remain with the individual... and each
individual must make an individual, final determination of
threat. [FN538] <p>  Potts did not discuss the Rules of Engagement with the FBI's
Legal Counsel Office during this crisis. He noted that legal
review is not usually solicited because Rules of Engagement are
written to fall within the bounds of the FBI's standard deadly
force policy. <p> Michael Kahoe, Section Chief of the Violent Crimes and Major
Offenders Section FBI Criminal Investigative Division at FBI
Headquarters, spoke to John Sauls, Supervisory Special Agent
with the Legal Instruction Unit at the FBI Academy, on August 21
at approximately 5:00 p.m. (EDT) about the Rules for the crisis
in Idaho. Sauls told Kahoe that two primary assessments needed
to be made. First, there should be a determination of
"dangerousness," that is, whether there was probably cause to
believe that someone had caused or attempted to cause death or
serious bodily harm to agents or other persons. According to
Sauls, the fact that the subjects had apparently intentionally
fired upon and killed a marshal indicated that they were
dangerous. Second, Sauls spoke of the need to assess the
"necessity" to use deadly force to resolve the crisis situation 
and to gain "control" of the situation or to protect the lives
of other individuals. [FN539] <p>Sauls told Kahoe that the element of dangerousness
could be
assessed by persons who were not at the scene. However, the
second element of necessity could be determined only by on-scene
personnel. Sauls defined having control of the situation as
being when a subject was "in custody" and not merely forced into
a position where movement was restricted, such as in a fortified
house. [FN540] <p>Kahoe asked Sauls "if agents encounter armed adults in the
compound (around the Weaver house), would deadly force be
permitted?" Sauls responded that deadly force would be permitted
"if they refuse to surrender." However, Sauls stressed that he
meant that on-scene personnel had permission to use deadly
force, but that it was certainly not required. According to
Sauls, only the agents at the scene could decide whether deadly
force was necessary. [FN541] <p>Around 6:30 or 7:00 p.m. (EDT) on August 21, Kahoe told
Sauls
that a plan was being formulated to permit snipers to fire at
Randy Weaver and Kevin Harris from concealed positions around
the Weaver cabin. Sauls explained that, as long as there was a
"continued demand for surrender which the subjects continued to
ignore, and they maintained themselves in a barricaded
situation" the use of the tactics described by Kahoe would be
permissible and within the FBI's deadly force policy. [FN542] <p>No additional legal
advice regarding the Rules was solicited
from within the FBI. The legal advisor from the FBI's Salt Lake
City Division was not at the scene. He reported that after the
first few days all legal advice came from the Office of Legal
Counsel, FBI Headquarters. Indeed, he was never consulted about
the Rules of Engagement and was unaware of their existence until
sometime after the siege had terminated. [FN543] <p>Nor did the FBI officials drafting
the Rules consult with the
United States Attorney's Office having jurisdiction over the 
crisis. Assistant U.S. Attorney Ron Howen arrived at the crisis
site shortly after the crisis began and remained there until the
situation was resolved. While at the crisis scene, he provided
legal advice and legal assistance regarding the preparation of
legal documents, such as an affidavit supporting the
government's request to obtain electronic surveillance of the
cabin, and he forwarded information to the U.S. Attorney in
Boise. Howen did not participate in any discussion about the
operations plan or Rules of Engagement, and he was not involved
in formulating or approving any of the operations plans or the
Rules of Engagement. The local Boundary County prosecutor, who
was also on site during the crisis, was also not consulted. <p>Coulson recalls that the
proposed Rules of Engagement "were
words to the effect of 'any armed adult outside the Weaver cabin
or on Ruby Ridge could be the subject of deadly force.'" [FN544]
The basis for these Rules was Coulson's belief that the subjects
knew that law enforcement personnel were on the scene and that a
marshal had been shot after the slain marshal had announced his
presence. Furthermore, Coulson believed that a "call out" or
surrender announcement was not feasible in the early stages of
the operation. Coulson reasoned: <p>If the subjects had retreated and had barricaded
themselves in
the Weaver cabin, it was my belief that the only reason for this
could be for an armed confrontation with law enforcement
officers. It was my belief that as soon as the HRT personnel
arrived in the area, they would be in grave peril.... It was
also my belief that it was a possibility that supporters of
Randy Weaver would attempt to reinforce him and assist in armed
resistance. Due to the uncontained and remote nature of the
crisis site, I was gravely concerned that this either had
occurred or would occur. I was concerned that Weaver and or his
associates would tactically move about in order to ambush law
enforcement personnel. I believed that HRT personnel might
observe subjects preparing to ambush law enforcement components
who did not realize they were being threatened. [FN545] <p>Coulson considered the
children in the Weaver cabin hostages
because he assumed that they did not have the option of leaving
voluntarily. Notwithstanding this belief, he feared that the
children might shoot at law enforcement personnel, who attempted
to rescue the marshals. In the early stages, Coulson did not
know whether they might be captured if not immediately rescued.
Coulson believed that Weaver's family and his associates would
defend him and that Weaver's supporters would attempt to
reinforce Weaver and assist in armed resistance. He believed
that the subjects had already demonstrated their willingness and
ability to kill law enforcement personnel because they had shot
deputy Marshal Degan after he had identified himself as a
marshal. Coulson believed that the individuals inside the Weaver
cabin knew that law enforcement personnel were outside the cabin
and, thus, he reasoned that if an armed adult appeared outside
the Weaver residence with the weapon, it was reasonable to
assume that the individual intended to commit hostile acts
against law enforcement personnel. <p>In addition, Coulson was aware of the possibility
that Randy
Weaver had Explosives/Ordnance Device training due to his army
experience, and believed that Weaver had received Special Forces
training, designed to give a tactical advantage to small groups
of highly trained people. Because of Weaver's Army experience
and his history as a white separatist, Coulson expected that the
Weaver property might contain fortifications and remote
-controlled explosive devices. Coulson was aware that which
separatists frequently armed family members, including wives and
children, that they fortified their property against assault,
engaged in tactical training with associates, usually belonged
to highly trained, heavily armed groups, and were extremely
dangerous and frequently willing to engage law enforcement
personnel. [FN546] <p>After Potts had approved the Rules of Engagement, Rogers told
Smith that HRT believed that the Rules should be modified
because of the circumstances of which they were aware. Smith
understood the Rules as allowing "any adult armed with a long
arm outside of the cabin to be shot." Smith told this inquiry
that he had never modified standard Marshals Service shooting
policy, which, he noted, is similar to that of other law
enforcement agencies and allows deadly force to be used when
human life is in danger. He interpreted the FBI's Ruby Ridge
Rules as more liberal than the Marshal Service's standard
policy. Nevertheless, he thought the Rules were appropriate,
reasonable, and necessary in this case because it was probably
that a federal marshal or agent would be confronted by armed
individuals. Smith was concerned that law enforcement personnel
could be harmed during the operation. <p>Smith was not called upon to approve the Rules
of Engagement
because the FBI was responsible for the tactical operation.
Nonetheless, he briefed the director Hudson and Twomey on the
Rules and relayed them to Special Operations Group ("SOG")
Commander John Haynes when he arrived at the command post. Smith
intended that the marshals operate under the same Rules of
Engagement as the FBI because the FBI was in charge of an
operation, for which the Marshals Service would provide support. <p>Smith recalls that
the Rules were changed, so that "any adult
male who is armed with a rifle should be neutralized". He
understood "adult males" to include Kevin Harris, Randy Weaver,
and any other male carrying weapons whom the agents or marshals
encountered on the mountain. [FN547] Although he did not recall
the operative words "can and should" in the Rules, he did not
interpret those words as mandating that marshals or agents
shoot. Smith stated, "there was nothing said that would cause a
deputy or agent to substitute these rules for good judgment." 
[FN548] <p><H4>b. Formulation of the Rules of Engagement and Operations
plan on August 22</H4> <p> When the remaining HRT members arrived, they went to the
National Guard Armory in Bonner's Ferry, Idaho, where HRT 
Commander Rogers briefed them at 9:00 a.m. (PDT). [FN549] Rogers
told the HRT members and SOG snipers that the Rules of
Engagement had not yet been approved, and that HRT
sniper/observer coordinator Lester Hazen would brief the
sniper/observers before their deployment. The proposed Rules of
Engagement provided at the initial briefing were: <p>Any adult with a weapon who was
observed in the vicinity of
Randall Weaver's cabin or the fire fight area, could and should
be the subject of deadly force. <p>Following he briefing, the HRT travelled to Ruby
Creek at the
base of the mountain on which the Weaver cabin was located and
began to establish tactical operations centers. This involved
unloading and erecting command and bunk tents, clerical
equipment and supplies, and weapons systems. Some HRT members
began to assimilate the massive amount of information provided
by the Marshals Service and local law enforcement agencies. 
[FN550] <p>While these organizational activities were in progress, HRT
supervisors were engaged in the drafting of the operational
plan. McGavin prepared the original draft of the Rules. After
reviewing this draft, Rogers told McGavin to scratch out what he
had originally written and the proceeded to discuss with McGavin
and Hazen what he wanted in the Rules. Rogers told McGavin to
insert the "and should" clause into the Rules. McGavin believed
that Rogers inserted those words to convey his perception, based
on the briefing he had received, of the extreme risk posed by
Weaver. [FN551] Hazen contributed the final paragraph to the
Rules. Rogers testified that the words that comprised the Rules
were his words and that McGavin and Hazen wrote them down to
provide the sniper/observers and other team members with Rules
that "clearly reflect what I know I had approved through our
chain of command." [FN552] These rules were: <p>If any adult in the compound is observed
with a weapon after
the surrender announcement is made, deadly force can and should
be employed to neutralize this individual. <p>If any adult male is observed with a
weapon prior to the
announcement deadly force can and should be employed if a shot
can be taken without endangering the children. <p>If compromised by any dog the dog can
be taken out. <p>Any subject other than R, V, + K, presenting threat of death or
grievous bodily harm FBI rules of deadly force apply. [FN553] <p>Once at the site,
Rogers proposed to Glenn that several things
be done quickly. First, communication should be established with
the people in the cabin or in bunkers, if there were any. Next,
Rogers wanted to "call-out," to let the subjects know that the
FBI was there and that there were warrants for their arrest.
Finally, and most importantly, he wanted to ask them and give
them the chance to surrender to law enforcement authorities,
which, according to Rogers, is "standard procedure." [FN554]
Since law enforcement personnel had not surrounded the cabin,
Rogers also wanted to place sniper/observers around the site to
cover law enforcement personnel and to cordon the site. [FN555] <p> Rogers testified
that when the FBI makes an arrest, it tries
to notify the subjects of the arrest that the FBI is present
with a legitimate arrest warrant. This surrender announcement or
"call-out" was going to be accomplished in this instance by
agents going to the cabin area in armored personnel carriers and
broadcasting the message with a megaphone or loud hailer. At the
same time, the agents would drop off a phone at the site.
[FN556] Rogers considered armored personnel carriers necessary
protection for his agents. He saw no alternative to taking a
phone to the cabin in the carrier beaus of the offensive posture
the Weavers and Harris had taken. [FN557] <p>Along with these plans, Rogers submitted
the proposed Rules of
Engagement to Glenn at a morning meeting also attended by Gore,
Rogers, Smith, and HRT and Marshals Service supervisors. At the
meeting, a number of options were discussed. [FN558] One plan
Rogers suggested involved the HRT first establishing a perimeter
around the compound followed by the Marshals service making a
tactical entry into the cabin. When this proposal was presented
to Louis Stagg, Deputy Commander of the SOG, Stagg recused his
personnel from this task because he was concerned that any
injuries to or deaths of the subjects might be construed as
retaliation by the Marshals Service. Thereafter, it was agreed
that the HRT would perform the entry, if necessary, but that one
marshal would participate in making the formal arrests. [FN559] <p>Glenn's assessment of
the level of threat presented by the
situation affected the development of the Rules of Engagement. 
He believed that Weaver's children were well trained and capable
of firing at law enforcement and he knew at the same time that
law enforcement officers are reluctant to fire at children, even
when their own lives are in danger. Therefore, he was greatly
concerned that tactical personnel on the inner perimeter and
personnel attempting to assault the cabin might be exposed to
serious injury from the children. Glenn was also extremely
concerned that subjects leaving the cabin with firearms would
pose a danger to law enforcement personnel because they were
well versed on the terrain while the agents and officers had
virtually no knowledge of the mountainous conditions or the
"booby traps" possibly in place. Finally, Glenn worried that if
any subjects entered the "bunker network" which might exist,
they could fire on law enforcement officers in a manner that
would make an effective response or defense impossible. [FN560] <p>
  [G.J.] <p>
  [G.J.] [FN561] <p>When the HRT is activated, a proposed operation plan is
written for resolving the situation. According to Rogers, when
the HRT faces "a hostage situation or a barricaded subject
situation, such as at Ruby Ridge," the plan includes "a proposed
tactical resolution" that includes an "assault" or "a plan to
send people inside the building to effect an arrest." [FN562] <p>Any deliberate assaults
must be approved by FBI Headquarters.
The plan for such an assault is contained in an operations plan.
At Ruby Ridge, McGavin prepared such a plan. McGavin discussed
a deliberate assault with Rogers and told him he did not want to
send a team into a situation in which an encounter with armed
children seemed likely and agents might have to kill a child to
defend themselves. Rogers agreed, but recognized that an
operations plan had to be written. McGavin wrote a plan
realizing that the crisis should be resolved, if at all
possible, through action designed to minimize the prospect of
armed engagement with the subjects. [FN563] <p>McGavin drafted a plan, which included
the travel of armored
personnel carriers ("APCs") to the Weaver compound, attempts to
contact Weaver with a loudspeaker or hostage phone, and the
establishment of a 360 degree perimeter. Glenn, with the
understanding that the situation was "extremely dangerous and
highly volatile," approved the following Rules of Engagement in
the plan before sending the plan to FBI Headquarters for
approval: <p>1. If any adult male is observed with a weapon prior to the
announcement, deadly force can and should be employed, if the
shot can be taken without endangering any children. <p>2. If any adult in the compound
is observed with a weapon
after the surrender announcement is made, and is not attempting
to surrender, deadly force can and should be employed to
neutralize the individual. <p>3. If compromised by any animal, particularly the dogs,
that
animal should be eliminated. <p>4. Any subjects other than Randall Weaver, Vicki Weaver,
Kevin
Harris, presenting threats of death or grievous bodily harm, the
FBI rules of deadly force are in effect. Deadly force can be
utilized to prevent the death or grievous bodily injury to
oneself or that of another. [FN564] <p>According to the Marshals Service Crisis Center
log, the
operation plan was being assembled by HRT and SOG at 10:30 a.m.
(PDT) on August 22. At noon, it was reported that the
"operations plan [was] going forward to insert sniper team. 
Team should be in place in approximately two hours." [FN565] 
According to the plan, after the sniper teams were in position,
the FBI negotiation team would move forward and attempt to
contact the subjects. However, one half hour later, it was
reported that the FBI was having difficulty obtaining armored
personnel carriers. An entry in the crisis center log stated:
"General Manning of the Idaho National Guard has refused to
provide vehicle support to the FBI." [FN566] At 1:50 p.m. (PDT)
U.S. Marshal Michael Johnson reported that SOG and HRT had
completed the operational plan which he described as follows: <p>1. Contain perimeter of
compound with HRT snipers. <p> 2. Two armored personnel carriers will be deployed to the
compound and loud speakers will be used to order the suspects to
surrender. <p>3. If Weaver or his older son (sic) Exit the residence armed
the snipers will neutralize them. <p>4. If there is no contact, then the APCs will
retreat leaving
the snipers in place. <p>5. The following day the APCs will return and again order the
suspects to surrender. <p>6. If no compliance, the APCs will begin dismantling the
outlying buildings by ramming them. <p>7. If no compliance, tear gas will be deployed
into the main
house. [FN567] <p>Gore believed that the operational plan that he, Glenn, and
Rogers developed fully considered the merits of a negotiation
strategy as opposed to a tactical resolution of the situation.
He explained: <p>our objective was clearly the peaceful resolution of the
crisis. A means of delivery of a hostage telephone to the
Weaver compound, to secure a telephonic link between the command
post and the crisis site could not be established prior to the
deployment of sniper observers, and prior to the actual
placement of the telephone, the negotiation strategy was not
made a part of the initial operational plan.... [FN568] <p> After the initial plan had
been drafted, Gore and the others
consulted with Johnson, Smith, and Stagg of the Marshal's
Service, who opposed the plan. [FN569] At approximately 2:40 
p.m. (PDT) on August 22, an operations plan, which included the
Rules of Engagement, was sent by facsimile to FBI Headquarters
and the Marshals Service for review. The Rules in the operations
plan as submitted to the Bureau for review stated: <p>If any adult in the compound is
observed with a weapon after
the surrender announcement is made, deadly force CAN AND SHOULD
be employed to neutralize this individual. If any adult male is
observed with a weapon prior to the announcement, deadly force
CAN AND SHOULD be employed, if the shot can be taken without
endangering any children. [Emphasis added.] [FN570] <p>FBI Deputy Assistant Director
Coulson received the operations
plan at the FBI Headquarters' Strategic Information and
Operations Center; he did not approve the draft plan because it
lacked a negotiations option. Coulson stopped reviewing the plan
once he realized a negotiation option was absent. Thus, he never
saw or reviewed the Rules of Engagement in the plan which
appeared after the section in which a negotiations strategy
should have appeared. [FN571] <p>After completing his partial review of the operations
plan,
Coulson made certain observations and raised certain questions
in a facsimile to Glenn: <p>1. No mention is made of Sniper Observer deployment as of
5:30
p.m. EST 2:30 PST (sic). <p>2. What intelligence has been gathered from the crisis
point? <p>3. There is no mention of a negotiation strategy to secure
release of individuals at the crisis point. <p>4. There is no mention of any attempt to
negotiate at all. <p>5. SAC Salt Lake is requested to consider negotiation strategy
and advise FBIHQ. <p>Coulson informed Glenn that Headquarters was "not prepared to
approve the plan as submitted." <p>The 6:30 p.m. entry on the SICC log reads: <p>SAC
Glenn advised DAD Coulson that Portland SWAT team had
contact with who (sic) they believed was subject approximately
1/4 mile "up canyon" from home. He used profanity and told the
to get off property. SAC WAS REMINDED OF RULES OF ENGAGEMENT AND
TO TREAT SUBJECT AS THREAT IF CONFRONTED OUTSIDE HOME. SAC IS
WORKING ON NEGOTIATION PLAN. [FN572] <p>Coulson told this investigation that the entry
refers to the
Rules of Engagement that he and Potts had formulated. WE found
no other entry in the SIOC log or situation reports approving
either the operational plan as a whole or the Rules of
Engagement set forth by Glenn. [FN573] <p>Gore believed the tactical plan included
incremental increases
of tactical pressure on the subjects, to be effected only if the
Weavers failed to enter into negotiations. Gore told us that FBI
Headquarters refused to approve the operations plan because a
negotiation strategy was not part of it. [FN574] <p>
When the operations plan was rejected, Frederick Lanceley, the
FBI chief negotiator, was asked to write a negotiation addendum.
Before this, Lanceley had played no role in developing an
operations plan. He had attended Rogers' 9:00 a.m. briefing of
the sniper/observers and heard Rogers tell the group that there
would be "no long siege" and that the "Rules of Engagement" were
to shoot armed adult males, if there was a clear shot. After
attending this briefing, Lanceley concluded that a tactical
solution would be sought without negotiations. [FN575] While en
route to the crisis site, Lanceley told Rogers that he would
work with HRT Intelligence because there was not going to be a
negotiation effort. When Rogers said, "Good," Lanceley felt that
his impression had been confirmed. Consequently, Lanceley did
not participate in the planning on Saturday, August 22, until he
was told in early afternoon that Headquarters had rejected the
operations plan because a negotiation effort had not been
included. [FN575] <p>
Lanceley wrote the follow-up negotiation addendum to the
operations plan. This addendum provided: <p>  Crisis Negotiation Annex To Ops Plan <p>A
negotiator wll [sic] go forward to the residence in the APC
[Armored Personnel Carrier]. When the APC is in view of the
house, it will stop and the negotiator will make the following
statement: <p>'Mr. Weaver, This is Fred Lanceley of the FBI. You should
understand that we have warrants for the arrest of yourself and
Mr. Harris. I would like you to accept a telephone so that we
can talk and work out how you will come out of the house without
further violence. I would like you or one of your children to
come out of the house, unarmed, pick up the telephone and return
to the house.' <p> At the conclusion of this statement, the APC will proceed
forward, drop the hostage phone and withdraw. If Weaver or a
child retrieves the telephone, the negotiator will attempt to
initiate a dialogue. [FN577] <p> This addendum was sent to FBI headquarters and received
the
following response: <p> FBIHQ agrees with negotiation annex as submitted. Salt Lake
should Proceed with this negotiation plan on his [sic] own
initiative. [FN578] <p>Eugene Glenn, in a signed sworn statement given to the FBI
team [FN579] that reviewed the shooting incident following the
resolution of the crisis stated that, "[o]n August 22, 1992, at
12:30 p.m. PDT, FBI Headquarters approved the operations plan
which included ... Rules of Engagement." Glenn is the only
person who has stated that an operations plan was ever approved. <p>
  [GARRITY] [FN580] <p> In a statement given during this inquiry, Glenn recalled that,
although FBI Headquarters did not approve the proposed
operations plan, Potts told him that the Rules of Engagement had
been approved as formulated and could be put into effect. Glenn
told Rogers about this approval. [FN581] <p>The Rules of Engagement remained in effect
until they were
replaced by the FBI standard deadly force policy on August 26,
1992. Although Rogers testified that the operations plan was
modified in the ensuing days and submitted to FBI Headquarters,
he stated that it was never approved and never implemented. fn
582 The only written operations plan provided to this
investigation, the prosecutors, and defense counsel is dated
August 23, 1992. <p><H4>c. Interpretation of rules of Engagement by Law Enforcement
Personnel</H4> <p>both Assistant Director Larry Potts and former Deputy
Assistant Director Danny O. Coulson have stated that the Rules
of Engagement were merely a means of identifying the level of
risk presented by the situation and were not intended to change
or modify the FBI's Standard Deadly Force Policy. Potts
explained: <p>These ROE [Rules of Engagement] were established to assist the
HRT personnel in making a determination regarding what
constituted a threat to them in this extraordinary circumstance. 
The ROE were not intended to supercede [sic] the FBI standard
deadly force policy. The final determination regarding such
implementation of deadly force must always remain with the
individual faced with the actual choice, and each individual
must make an individual, final determination of threat.... I was
acutely aware that HRT personnel could encounter armed subjects,
and as a result of the events leading to and resulting in DUSM
Degan's death, it was my intention to ensure that HRT personnel
in the area of the crisis were fully aware of a heightened
degree of threat. [FN583] <p>Similarly, in Coulson's view, the Rules of Engagement:
<p>were never intended to change or modify the FBI's Deadly Force
Policy. They were intended to heighten the sense of awareness to
the dangers presented to our personnel. I have personally issued
Rules of Engagement on numerous occasions, both in real life
tactical situations and in training exercises. They do not take
away the judgment factor of those who implement them, nor do
they change established FBI policy. [FN584] <p>Special Agent in Charge, Eugene Glenn,
believed that the Rules
of Engagement were "within the Bureau's standard deadly force
policy, but that they [were] an expansion of that policy."
[FN585] He explained that during the initial stages of the
standoff: <p>[W]e were completely unable to communicate with the individuals
in the Weaver compound, we had no current intelligence
information as to the nature of the tactical preparations they
were making to engage law enforcement personnel, and I wanted to
make sure that the Agents who were moving into close proximity
to the compound were clearly aware that they had been given MORE
LATITUDE regarding their application of deadly force, if
necessary, to ensure maximum safety of law enforcement officers
approaching the compound. [FN586] <p>  Glenn intended the Rules of Engagement to
decrease the
reaction time in which deadly force is normally initiated by a
FBI special agent. In Glenn's words: <p>I believed that this heightened level of
awareness (reflected
in the Rules of Engagement) was absolutely essential to preclude
further death or serious injury to law enforcement personnel
responding to this crisis. By issuing these Rules of 
Engagement, I was indicating to all tactical personnel the
serious nature of this situation and the necessity that they be
ready to immediately employ deadly force, should be
appropriate. [FN587] <p> With regard to the phrase "can and should," Glenn intended
this language to indicate clearly to all tactical personnel that
they were fully authorized to utilize deadly force against the
Weaver/Harris group if appropriate. He did not intend to remove
the individual agent's responsibility to determine whether
deadly force was necessary, but simply to advise personnel that
action by individuals within the Weaver compound that
jeopardized law enforcement personnel could be addressed with
deadly force to prevent additional law enforcement casualties. 
Glenn stated that, although the Rules of Engagement were not a
"license to kill, " as some have alleged, they probably put HRT
personnel in a more "offensive mode." [FN588] <p>
This investigation also discovered several different
interpretations of the terms "adult" and "adult male," as
contained in the Rules of Engagement. Glenn told us he intended
that these terms apply only to Randy Weaver, Kevin Harris, Vicki
Weaver (as appropriate), and sympathizers who entered the Weaver
compound to prevent law enforcement officers from resolving the
crisis. [FN589] As is more fully explained below, other law
enforcement officials who were questioned about the Rules stated
that only Randy Weaver, Kevin Harris, and Vicki Weaver were
included in the category "adult" while adult sympathizers would
fall under the standard FBI deadly force policy. <p>The FBI Special Agent in Charge,
William Gore, believed that
the Rules of Engagement seemed appropriate to the situation at
Ruby Ridge. He understood that the Rules made any adult male
with a weapon in the Weaver compound the object of deadly force. 
It was clear to him that Harris and Weaver were the adult males
specified by these Rules. He understood that Vicki Weaver was
excluded from the pre-announcement Rule because there was no
probable cause to believe that she posed a deadly threat to law
enforcement. However, before an announcement to surrender had
been given, Gore believed that "any armed adult [who] emerged 
from the cabin... would be displaying clear disregard for the
lawful demand to lay down arms and surrender." [FN590] <p>Gore understood the Rules of
Engagement as a "broadening of
the FBI's deadly force policy ... based upon these specific
subject having demonstrated their willingness to kill a Federal
official to avoid capture." [FN591] Gore believed Rogers and
Smith had formulated the Rules during their trip to Idaho and
that they had been approved by FBI Assistant Director Potts. <p>Supervisory Special
Agent John G. Sauls, Legal Instruction
Unit at the FBI Academy, noted that the nonspecific character of
the terms "adult" and "adult male" made the Rules of Engagement
too broad for the FBI's standard deadly force policy, unless HRT
had also been given instructions as to who fell into these
categories. He also found the word "should" inappropriate
inasmuch as the final determination as to whether to use deadly
force must be made by the agent. He added, however, that, with
appropriate additional information simultaneously provided, the
Rules could be brought within the requirements. [FN592] <p>John C. Hall, also a
Supervisory Special Agent with the Legal
Instruction Unit at the FBI Academy, was similarly critical of
the Rules of Engagement. In an "informal analysis" that was not
an official opinion of the FBI's Legal Counsel division, he
concluded that the portion of the Rules stating that deadly
force could and should be used against any armed adult male
before the surrender announcement could be misread to direct
agents to use deadly force without first giving the subjects an
opportunity to surrender. He raised the possibility that the
Rules could have been misread to permit the use of force beyond
that which is permitted by the Constitution or FBI policy. Hall
was adamant, however, that, despite the language of the Rules,
the decision of HRT sniper/observer Lon Horiuchi to use deadly
force on August 22, did not violate either the Constitution or
FBI policy. [FN593] <p>Assistant U.S. Attorney Kim Lindquist, one of the two
prosecutors in the federal case against Randy Weaver and Kevin
Harris, asserted that he had "struggled" with the Rules of
Engagement. He asked Lon Horiuchi during trial preparation
whether the HRT sniper/observers interpreted the word "should"
to mean that they must shoot, if they saw an adult male with a
weapon in the compound area. [FN594] According to Lindquist,
Horiuchi said that he retained a great deal of discretion and
that he and the other HRT members approached the situation
according to the FBI's standard policy on the use of deadly
force. [FN595] <p>Frederick Lanceley, the FBI Hostage Negotiator, who
participated in the negotiations with the Weaver/Harris group,
was surprised and shocked by the Rules of Engagement. The Rules
were the most severe he had ever seen in the approximately 300
hostage situations in which he had been involved. He
characterized the Rules as inconsistent with the FBI standard
policy on the use of deadly force. [FN596] <p>HRT Commander Richard Rogers acknowledged
that neither he nor
any member of the HRT during his tenure had ever operated under
Rules of Engagement such as those employed during the Ruby Ridge
crisis. [FN597] He testified that under the standard FBI policy
on the use of deadly force the FBI "ask[s] our agents for more-- 
we're asking that they wait a little longer to ensure that these
individuals basically are going to employ some kind of deadly
force against them." [FN598] At Ruby Ridge, he said, "we already
know that the subject -- in this case, the males from the Weaver
compound -- had already employed deadly force against the law
enforcement officers, so they had clearly crossed that threshold
in killing an officer already." [FN599] Rogers explained that
the Ruby Ridge Rules told the HRT sniper/observers that they
could wait a little less before employing deadly force.
According to Rogers, the determination of how long to wait is
left to the individual's discretion. [FN600] <p>By the phrase, "can and should," Rogers
meant that the
sniper/observers had the authority to utilize deadly force and
should utilize it, if an opportunity presented itself. The Rules
did not refer to the agents' judgment because judgment "is
understood by every FBI agent, and clearly understood by every
member of HRT.... [T]hey should use deadly force in order to
protect themselves or other individuals." [FN601] He testified
that he did not explain his understanding of the phrase "can and
should" to the HRT snipers because: <p>[T]hey understood what I was talking about...
[and] I trained
with them every day, and we discussed -- I mean, an FBI agent,
from the time he goes through training at Quantico, has the
standard rules of engagement drilled into his head.... I also
have a sign with the standard FBI rules printed on it, hanging
in the classroom at the hostage rescue team. [FN602] <p>HRT supervisor, Stephen McGavin,
drafted the Rules of
Engagement based on his understanding of the Rules as described
by Rogers. He believed that the Rules were restrictive, as well 
as cautionary. according to McGavin, the Rules address the
application of deadly force in terms of the identity of the
subjects and impose certain age and gender restrictions. McGavin
believed that the Rules of Engagement were intended to alert the
HRT members to the extreme danger they faced and to inform them
that they might or would probably encounter circumstances which
might call for the use of deadly force. According to McGavin,
regardless of the Rules' restrictive or expansive character,
they were not intended to replace the FBI's deadly force policy.
[FN603] <p> McGavin explained that in the Ruby Ridge crisis, the
perception of deadly threat, coupled with the fact that Weaver
and Harris had demonstrated a willingness to kill a federal
official, produced grave concern that HRT members needed to be
made aware of the extreme danger. According to McGavin,
individuals react differently in perceiving threatening action
and deciding whether deadly force is necessary. He reasoned that
the failure to react or a delayed reaction to a threat in an
extremely dangerous situation could have deadly consequences for
the individual confronted with the threat or for another team
member who might be unaware of the threat. Thus, the Rules of
Engagement "used in this cries" were designed to give the HRT a
clear idea and understanding when a shot could or could not be
taken. [FN604] <p> Rogers told McGavin to insert the phrase "and should" into the
Rules. [FN605] McGavin viewed the "can and should" terminology
not as an order to shoot, but as a reminder that the lives of
the sniper/observers and the lives of perhaps many more of their
numbers might depend upon reacting quickly to the danger known
to exist on the mountain. According to McGavin, "Deadly force
'should' be employed against a dangerous individual who poses a
deadly or grievous bodily threat. The determination that it 
'must' be employed is the sole responsibility of the person who
perceives the threat and acts on that perception." [FN606] <p>According to McGavin, "The
'any adult males' terminology in
the second Rule of Engagement which applied to the time period
before the surrender announcement, excluded Vicki Weaver from
coverage because of uncertainty about her involvement in the
shootout with the [Deputy marshals on August 21]." [FN607]
McGavin explained that the qualifier, "'any' reflects our lack
of information about the crisis site, and addresses the
possibility that we could encounter Weaver supporters in the
compound." McGavin believed that the supporters would have to
display further actions of a threatening nature to be subjects
of deadly force." [FN608] <p>The HRT sniper/observers saw the Rules as not merely
heightening their sense of danger, but as modifying the usual
deadly force policy. For example, Dale Monroe interpreted the
Rules as a "green light" to use deadly force against armed adult
males. [FN609] Edward Wenger believed that, if he observed armed
adults, he could use deadly force, but standard FBI shooting
policy was to be applied to all others at the cabin. [FN610] <p> Another
sniper/observer, Warren Bamford, recalled that an
arrest team was to be sent to the cabin to demand that Weaver
and Harris surrender, but, under the Rules of Engagement, deadly
force could be used against armed, adult males outside the cabin
before the team arrived. Bamford found the Rules "not consistent
with the Standard FBI Deadly Force policy, in that the obvious
and imminent threat of death or grievous bodily harm had been
predetermined," but he believed that the threat was severe
enough to warrant such Rules. [FN611] <p> Mark Tilton remembered: <p>As a part of the
briefing, we were also given the rules of 
engagement which set forth the conditions under which we are
authorized to utilize our weapons. These rules were reiterated
in detail by SA Lester Hazen, Sniper coordinator, prior to our
tactical deployment. We were told that the FBI's standard policy
concerning the use of deadly force applied in this situation and
that there were additional special rules of engagement WHICH
WOULD APPLY IN THIS SITUATION. (EMPHASIS ADDED.) [FN612] <p>Similarly, Jerome Barker
stated that, "[1]s part of the
briefing given by Les Hazen, we were told that there were
special rules of engagement WHICH WE WERE TO ABIDE BY."
(Emphasis added.) [FN613] <p>Among the FBI SWAT teams deployed to the RUBY Ridge site,
there was a wide variety of interpretations of the Rules of
Engagement. Denver SWAT team leader Gregory Sexton recalled the
Rules as, "[i]f you see Weaver or Harris outside with a weapon,
you've got the green light." He had never seen such severe Rules
of Engagement, and he believed that they were inappropriate
because briefings about the subjects, Degan's death, and
observation of the terrain would be sufficient to alert tactical
personnel to the dramatically increased danger without
superseding standard deadly force policy. [FN614] <p>Another member of the Denver SWAT
team characterized the Rules
as "strong" and as a departure from the FBI's standard deadly
force policy. [FN615] A third member of Denver SWAT, who was
briefed on the Rules by the Denver SWAT team leaders, remembered
the Rules of Engagement as "if you see 'em, shoot 'em." this
agent had never been given such Rules of Engagement before, and
he felt that they were inappropriate. He said other SWAT team
members were taken aback by the Rules and that most of them
clung to the FBI's standard deadly force policy. [FN616] A
fourth Denver SWAT team member's reaction to the Rules at the
time was, "[y]ou've gotta be kidding." He viewed the Rules as an
imperative without clarification and inconsistent with the FBI's
standard deadly force policy. [FN617] <p>One of the members of the Marshals Service SOG,
who was
deployed to provide rear protection for the HRT personnel, was
briefed in the HRT tent by the FBI on the Rules of Engagement.
Although he did not disagree with the Rules because "they had
drawn first blood," he would have been "full of questions about
the Rules," had been in a position to take a shot. [FN618] <p>Most significant is the
testimony of Lon Horiuchi, the
sniper/observer who eventually fired at members of the
Weaver/Harris group. Horiuchi conceded that the Rules were
different from those in the FBI manual and the Rules under which
the HRT usually operated. He had never before been asked to
operate under such Rules, which differed from the standard
deadly force policy in that "the decision that we were already
in danger had already been made for us prior to going on the
hill." [FN619] Horiuchi testified that this was the first time
he had been asked to apply Rules that differed from the standard
deadly force policy. Under the latter, he could not shoot a
person, unless that person posed a threat to his or another
person's safety, and the decision as to whether a person posed a
threat was left to Horiuchi. Under the new Rules, the decision
that there was a threat had already been made. [FN620] Horiuchi
acknowledged that, under the Rules, he could and should shoot 
any adult male, if he had an opportunity. [FN621] <p> The following exchange during
cross-examination summarizes
Horiuchi's perception of the Rules: <p>Q: Were you advised that the folks there had a
habit of coming
out of the house with the weapons? <p>A: Yes sir, I believe that was one of the
briefings. <p>Q: So you knew that sometimes they came out, the dogs barked,
they came out with their weapons, you knew that, didn't you? <p> A: Yes, sir. <p>Q:
Under your rules of engagement, you could then and should,
if they came out of the house, you could and should use deadly
force? <p> A: Yes, sir, it is true. [FN622] <p><H4>d. Deployment of FBI HRT, SWAT and
U.S. Marshals Service SOG
Personnel at Ruby Ridge</H4> <p> On Saturday, August 22, 1992, at approximately 11:0 or
11:30
a.m. (PDT), FBI Special Agent Lester Hazen, the HRT sniper
coordinator, ordered Lon Horiuchi, the HRT "Blue"
sniper/observer team leader, to prepare his team for deployment.
He also ordered Roger Love, the "Gold" sniper/observer team
leader, to have his personnel assist in setting up the HRT's
Tactical Operations Center (TOC). [FN623] The teams were told 
that an armored personnel carrier would be sent to the Weaver 
cabin to announce that the occupants should surrender. An HRT
assault team would be inside the carrier to effect the arrest, 
if the subjects complied. The teams were instructed to establish 
positions so that they could provide observation and long range 
precision fire in accordance with the Rules of Engagement. 
According to HRT Commander Rogers, the sniper/observers knew 
that a surrender announcement was part of the plan, but: <p>[G.J.] [FN624] <p>
  [G.J.] [FN625] <p> Before the Rules of Engagement were given to the teams,
McGavin, second in command of the HRT, brought the typed Rules
to Rogers at the command trailer. When Rogers returned later
with word that they had been approved by FBI Headquarters, the
HRT and U.S. Marshals Service SOG sniper/observers were briefed
on the Rules of Engagement. [FN626] [GARRITY] [FN627] Marshals
Service SOG personnel were deployed behind the HRT personnel to
protect the HRT sniper/observers from hostile action from the 
rear. SOG Deputy Commander Stagg told his sniper/observers to 
take orders from Hazen. [FN629] <p>The sniper/observers were deployed to the
mountainside
overlooking the Weaver cabin to provide security for tactical
units, which, after the sniper/observers were in position, would
form an inner perimeter around the Weaver compound. The
sniper/observers were also deployed to be used to safeguard law
enforcement officers attempting to establish communications with
the cabin. Additionally, they were to be used to gather information about the terrain,
armaments, and fortifications,
along with information about those present at the crisis site. 
[FN630] <p>Hazen asked U.S. Deputy Marshal Ron Libby, who was familiar
with the area, to identify observation positions and routes for
HRT personnel to travel to those locations. The rough terrain
made 4-wheel-drive vehicles necessary for transporting the HRT
members; Hazen attempted to obtain these vehicles. [FN631] <p>After waiting several
hours for the 4-wheel-drive vehicles, 
HRT Command decided, at approximately 3:00 p.m. (PDT), [FN632]
to send the sniper/observer teams to their positions on foot. 
After briefing the teams on the Rules of Engagement, Hazen
dispatched nine HRT sniper/observers in four groups. One
"overwatch" group of two HRT sniper/observers was held back to
wait for the vehicles. <p>  The sniper/observers took several hours to work their way up
the mountain to the observation posts. At 3:45 p.m. (PDT),
during a reconnaissance flight, someone in the HRT helicopter
warned the sniper/observers by radio of movement outside the
Weaver cabin and in the compound area. The sniper/observer group
halted until it was reported that the individuals had returned
to the cabin. the group then continued up the hill. [FN633] <p>
  <H4>e. Use of the Helicopter </H4><p> HRT helicopter pilot, Frank Costanza, flew six
reconnaissance
missions on August 22, 1992, from the staging area at the
command post to an area above and around the hilltop where the
Weaver cabin was located. He believed that the purpose of the
flights was to afford FBI, Marshals Service, and U.S. Attorney's
Office personnel the opportunity to assess the area and the
terrain around the Weaver residence. Costanza tried to avoid
hostile fire during the flights by remaining at least 200 yards
away from the cabin. He described the weather conditions as a
mixture of rain and snow and noted that visibility was limited.
[FN634] <p>According to Glenn, the helicopter was used to fly over the area to identify
possible sites for the sniper/observer teams.
Aerial operations were severely hampered by inclement weather.
The low cloud ceiling made it impossible to operate the
helicopters out of range of the weapons thought to be in the
Weaver cabin. Accordingly, the helicopters were utilized at low
altitudes, and they weaved "around the crisis site.....to
avoid being an obvious target." Glenn took one flight that was
within range of a rifle shot, but the helicopter never flew
directly over the Weaver cabin. [FN635] <p>A member of the Marshals Service SOG reported
that, while he
was at the command post area on Saturday, August 22, he saw the
helicopter fly toward the cabin and return very quickly. He
heard that the Weavers had come out of the cabin and had acted
in a hostile manner toward the helicopter but that they had not
fired at the helicopter. [FN636] <p><H4>f. Placement of HRT Sniper/Observers in Area
Surrounding the
Weaver Cabin</H4> <p> Because of the rugged terrain and deteriorating weather
conditions, HRT sniper/observers began arriving at positions on
the ridge overlooking the Weaver cabin approximately two to two
and one half hours after setting out from the command
post/staging area. [FN637] <p> At 5:07 p.m., the HRT sniper/observer team designated as
Sierra 4, of "S-4," arrived at its position. this team consisted
of Lon Horiuchi and Dale Monroe. At 5:20 p.m., the HRT team
designated Sierra 2, consisting of Edward Wenger and Warren
Bamford, arrived at its position. At 5:52 p.m., Sierra 3,
consisting of Jerome Barker and Christopher Curran, arrived at
its position. Between 5:52 p.m. and 5:57 p.m., S-1, consisting
of HRT members Christopher Whitcomb, Roger Love, and Mark
Tilton, arrived at its position. [FN638] <p>Horiuchi's "Sierra 4" position was the
closest of the four
positions, almost due north of the cabin in a line almost
parallel to the front wall. He was at a slight angle above the
cabin, approximately 646 feet from the front door and
approximately 579 feet from the outbuilding known as the
"birthing shed." There was a ravine between Horiuchi and the
cabin. [FN639] Horiuchi could see the top of the front porch of
the cabin and straight through the porch. He could see the front
of the door as it opened and when it was in an open position. 
Horiuchi could not see the front door when it was closed, nor
could he see into the cabin. He could also see the deck at the
back of the cabin. [FN640] <p><H4>g. Circumstances Involving the Two Rifle Shots Taken
by HRT
Member Lon Horiuchi</H4> <p>(1) The First Shot <p>
At approximately 5:45 p.m., Horiuchi saw an unarmed, young
female, slight of build, with a ponytail, run from the front of
the Weaver cabin toward a rocky outcropping. <p>  [G.J.] [FN641] <p>  [GARRITY] <p>
  [FN642] <p>After viewing this female with the naked eye, Horiuchi
observed her through his rifle scope and determined that she was
a child. Although he could have fired at her, he did not because
"the female was not armed at that time and [he] was assuming she
was a child because of the size of the stature." [FN643]
Horiuchi could not recall whether the front door was open when
the child was outside the cabin, but after she returned to the
cabin, the door was closed. [FN644] <p>Within a minute after the girl returned to the
cabin, Horiuchi
observed an unarmed male on the back deck. The man moved to the
back corner of the deck where ponchos or blankets were hanging
on a string. "It seemed like he just felt them to see if they
were dry and then he went back in." [FN645] The man was in
Horiuchi's vision for perhaps ten seconds, an, although Horiuchi
could have both fired and hit the person, he did not because
"the individual did not appear to be armed, there was nothing in
his hand, and I did not see any weapons around or on his
person." [FN646] HRT sniper.observer Whitcomb, from his Sierra-1
position, the highest and farthest away from the Weaver cabin of
the four positions, could vaguely observe this individual on the
back porch. [FN647] The other HRT sniper/observers did not
report that they saw a man on the back porch. <p>At 5:57 p.m., the HRT helicopter took
off for its sixth
observation mission of the day. HRT Commander Rogers, Marshals
Service Deputy Director Smith, Marshals Service SOG Commander
Haynes, and HRT pilot Frank Costanza were aboard. [FN649] Haynes
observed someone outside the cabin, but he could not identify
the person or see whether the person was armed. [FN650] Rogers 
and Smith recall that someone aboard the helicopter reported 
seeing two persons outside the cabin, armed with rifles,
although none of the other people in the helicopter recalls
observing anyone outside the cabin. About the time the
helicopter landed, Costanza recalls hearing radio reports that
two shots had been fired. [FN652] <p>Horiuchi heard the helicopter and the armored
personnel
carriers start their engines, and he saw the helicopter take off
from the command post to the left of the Weaver cabin, circle to
his left and out of his sight. [FN653] Within five to ten
seconds after the helicopter engine started, Horiuchi saw two
males and the female he had seen earlier come out of the front
door of the cabin and run toward the "rocky outcropping" a
defensive position near the front of the cabin. [FN654] [G.J.] <p>[G.J.] [FN655] <p>
  [G.J.] [FN656] <p>
  [FN657] <p>
  Horiuchi saw the three people run behind the "birthing shed,"a wooden building close
to the cabin and disappear from his
view. Horiuchi focused on the person he believed to be Harris
because he was carrying a "shoulder weapon" at "port arms."
[FN658] [G.J.] <p>[FN659] and because the person was not making and threatening 
movement, [FN660] <p> [G.J.] [FN661] <p>Jerome Barker at the Sierra 3 position saw two
adult males and
one adult female, carrying "long barreled weapons," move from
the cabin toward the birthing shed. [FN662] He perceived their
movements as rapid, evasive, and indicative of a 
confrontational posture. [FN663] He lost sight of the second 
male who exited the cabin, and he saw the other male and the 
female move toward his position and the Sierra 4 position. He 
lost sight of these people as they entered a ravine, less than 
two hundred yards from Barker's position. Barker prepared to 
"encounter" the two individuals whom he considered a threat. 
[FN664] <p>Horiuchi continued to concentrate on the person who had rounded
the rear corner of the birthing shed. As he came back into view,
Horiuchi believed that the man was the armed individual he had
initially seen running from the cabin. [FN665] The man picked 
up a stick and appeared to be poking at the ground and looking
up above and to the right of Horiuchi where Horiuchi sensed that
the helicopter was flying. [FN666] <p>GARRITY] <p>[FN667] <p>When the person reappeared
at the side of the shed from which
he had disappeared, he held his weapon at high port and scanned
above and behind Horiuchi's position. He seemed to be looking
for the helicopter. The person was "watching the helicopter, and
at times he would kind of bring his weapon up and [Horiuchi]
perceiv[ed] that perhaps he was trying to get a shot off."
[FN668] <p>[FN669] [GARRITY] Horiuchi fired one shot, just as the man 
suddenly moved along the side of the birthing shed out of sight. <p>
  When Horiuchi shot, the man was at the corner of the shed,
with his back toward Horiuchi. <p>[GARRITY] <p>[FN670] Horiuchi "assumed that he was
raising [his arm] to grab
inside the building to spin himself around the corner." [FN671]
Horiuchi acknowledged that when he shot he was aiming at the
man's back. [FN672] <p> Horiuchi assumed that he had hit the man or the edge of the
birthing shed. [FN673] After he fired, the person "continued to
move around the corner of the birthing shed, so -- without any
effect, it didn't seem like he was hit at all, so that's why my
assumption was that I had missed." [FN674] <p>Horiuchi assumed that the person at whom
he had fired was
Kevin Harris. [FN675] In fact, Horiuchi shot Randy Reaver. After 
the first shot, Horiuchi decided that he would shoot at this
person again, if he got the opportunity. [FN676] <p>Harris has said that he, Randy
Weaver, and Sara Weaver left
the cabin with rifles and that he went to the rocks near the
cabin to retrieve a battery, while Randy and Sara Weaver went to
the birthing shed to see Sammy Weaver's body. After hearing a
shot, Harris ran to the birthing shed where Weaver exclaimed,
"I'm shot." [FN677] <p>Randy Weaver stated: <p>Kevin, Sara and I (Randy) left the house
to check the North
perimeter. We didn't see anything so I (R) was going into the
guest shed where Sam was to see him one last time. As I (R)
reached up to unlatch the door I was shot from the rear and hit
in the upper right arm." [FN678] <p>(2) The Second Shot <p>According to Horiuchi, after
ten to twenty seconds, the man he
thought he had initially shot at came back into his view, joined
by the other male and the female. Horiuchi observed the male and
female run toward the cabin trailed by nine steps by the man
Horiuchi thought had been the target of his first shot. <p>The first two people
disappeared behind the open door, and,
Horiuchi assumed, went inside the cabin. Horiuchi had determined
after the first shot that he "was going to shoot at that
individual again" because: <p>I believed he was the same individual that had attempted
to
shoot . . . at the helicopter, and therefore, I assumed that he
was moving back to the house to get a more protected location
inside the house and I didn't want him back in the house. . . .
[K]nowing that the children were inside the house, that would
have been my last opportunity to shoot him before he got into
the house because I probably would not have shot at anyone
inside the house for fear of shooting the children.....[H]e
would have been more protected inside the house and he could
have shot at either me or my fellow agents or the helicopter
still flying around at that location, probably knowing that we
couldn't shoot back in there without harming some of the
children. [FN679] <p> Horiuchi fired as Harris approached the porch. Harris was
reaching out with his left hand toward the door and taking a
last step to the doorway, appearing to be holding the door open
or moving someone out of the way. <p> [GARRITY] <p>
  [FN680] <p> Horiuchi was leading the running target, that is, aiming
slightly in front of him as he ran, so that the target subject
would, in effect, run into the bullet. The cross hairs of the
rifle's scope were on the edge of the door or just on the wood
portion of the door. [FN681] The door was fully open, and
Horiuchi could see the entire front face of the door, except for
the bottom portion. At the time of the shot, the target had his
weapon in his right hand and was reaching out with his left
hand. [FN682] <p>Horiuchi saw the individual flinch as if he had been hit and
disappear into the doorway. The man reached like he had been
"punched" or hit on the side; he fell behind the door. [FN683]
Afterwards, Horiuchi heard a female scream for about 30
seconds. [FN684] He assumed that the female was screaming 
because Harris had been hit. [FN685] In fact, Vicki Weaver had
been fatally shot. <p>
  Horiuchi assumed that the individuals preceding the person at
whom he shot had gone inside the cabin. He has testified that he
did not see anyone standing behind the door when he shot and
that he did not intend to shoot Vicki Weaver. [FN686] <p>[GARRITY] <p> [FN687] <p>
  Horiuchi's report of the events and their sequence is
compatible with the reports of the other sniper/observers on the
scene. [FN688] <p>At the base command post, HRT sniper coordinator Hazen heard a
radio report of "shots fired," followed soon thereafter by a
report that "two friendly shots [had been] taken." He recalls
transmissions about "armed subjects with long guns,"
"screaming," and a "possible hit." [FN689] The HRT "Sniper Log" 
reports at 6:01 p.m.: "Shots fired, screaming." Various other
logs contain similar information and more confused accounts of
the events. [FN690] <p>Harris has given a statement about the events of August 22. 
After the first shot, Harris says, he, Randy Weaver, and Sara
Weaver ran to the cabin. Vicki Weaver held the door open while
Randy Weaver entered first, followed by Sara. When Harris was
almost at the doorway, at a point parallel with Vicki Weaver, he
heard a shot, which penetrated the door window and hit Vicki
Weaver in the head and Harris in the left arm and chest.[FN691] <p>Randy Weaver has
reported that he was turning the latch on
the birthing shed door when he was shot. When Vicki Weaver
exited the cabin, Randy Weaver told her that he had been shot. 
Vicki Weaver then turned, told the children to go inside, and
was putting the "babies" inside when she was shot. Randy Weaver
said that Vicki Weaver was holding the baby when she was
shot.[FN 692] None of the sniper/observers heard a baby cry
during or immediately after the shooting incident. <p><H4>h. Initial Surrender
Announcement</H4> <p>Following the shots, the helicopter landed at the command
post. HRT Commander Rogers ran to the Tactical Operations
Center and received confirmation that Horiuchi had fired.[FN693] <p>Rogers and FBI
Special Agent in Charge Eugene Glenn agreed
to deploy the armored personnel carriers to establish communications with the Weaver
cabin. [FN694] <p> The hostage telephone, telephone wire, and other necessary
equipment were on the carriers. At approximately 6:15 p.m., the
two carriers were driven to the cabin area with only visual
contact between them because the agents had been unsuccessful in
establishing radio communication. On the way up the mountain
the armored personnel carriers encountered an obstruction on the
road. While this initially caused great concern, it was
ultimately determined that the obstruction was not a booby
trap.[FN695] <p>Once they arrived at the cabin are, Frederick Lanceley, the
FBI senior hostage negotiator, gave the prearranged surrender
announcement. He told the cabin's occupants about the arrest
warrants for Weaver and Harris and asked Weaver to accept the
telephone so that negotiations for his surrender could proceed.
[FN696] The announcement followed the script contained in the
negotiations annex to the operations plan that Lanceley had
prepared earlier. There was no response from the cabin. <p>The carriers withdrew, laying
telephone line as they
descended the mountain. At 9:45 p.m., the telephone was
operational and five unsuccessful attempts were made to connect
Weaver, with the last made at 11:30 p.m.[FN697] <p>
 <h3>3. Discussion</H3>  <p><H4>a. FBI Rules of Engagement</H4> <p>
 (1) Factors Considered in the Formulation of the Rules of
Engagement <p>In our view, the information available to FBI supervisors
justified their apprehension and their anticipation of extreme
danger during the initial stages of the FBI response to the
crisis at Ruby Ridge. However, we believe the Rules of Engagement formulated and
implemented at Ruby Ridge were an
extreme response to the perceived threat. <p>  HRT Commander Rogers testified that the
HRT did not know
for certain that the Weaver/Harris group was inside the cabin
when the snipers were deployed. Nor did he know whether Weaver
knew of the presence of law enforcement or of the withdrawal of
the marshals.[FN698] In crafting the Rules of Engagement,
Rogers had to consider the possibility that the subjects were in
firing position and that they were scattered around the area. <p> Rogers believed that
the fact that the marshals had been
rescued and that Degan's body had been taken off the mountain
did not alter the potential danger. He found no evidence that
the mind-set of the people who had killed Degan had changed. 
They had not surrendered or attempted any explanation for the
death, and Rogers had no reason to believe that Degan's death
had been accidental. As far as he knew, the Weaver/Harris group
was prepared to kill other law enforcement officers.[FN699] <p>We believe that it is
reasonable to assume that the
occupants of the Weaver cabin expected law enforcement presence
in response to the events of August 21. By the time the snipers
arrived at their positions on August 22, it is inconceivable to
us that the Weavers did not know that they were the focus of an
intense law enforcement effort. Helicopters were circling the
mountain area and sirens could be heard. The Weaver/Harris
group knew that Harris and Sammy Weaver had been in a gun fight
with federal law enforcement officials and that Harris had
severely injured or killed a marshal.[FN700] Indeed, Harris and
Randy Weaver's statements and Vicki Weaver's diary reflect their
knowledge that the gunfight at the "Y" was with law
enforcement.[FN701] In addition, the Weavers had a television
and radio in their cabin and could have received reports about
the incident. <p> However, knowledge of a law enforcement presence is
different, in our opinion, from the specific knowledge that
snipers had surrounded the cabin. We have not discovered any
information establishing that the Weaver Harris group knew that
they were surrounded by HRT snipers. <p>
 (2) Approval of the Rules of Engagement <p> Before addressing the legality of and the
necessity for the
Rules of Engagement, the question of whether the Rules given to
the sniper/observers on August 22, 1992 were ever approved must
be considered. <p>The Rules of Engagement were initially formulated while
Commander Rogers was en route to Idaho. Rogers testified that
FBI Assistant Director Larry Potts approved the Rules of
Engagement during that flight before Rogers landed in Idaho. 
The three people, who discussed the Rules of Engagement that
evening, recall the proposed Rules differently. <p>Potts recalled approving the
following Rules: <p>1. [A]ny adult with a weapon who was observed in the
vicinity of Randy Weaver's cabin or the firefight area, could be
the subject of deadly force. <p>2. [A]ll efforts be made to avoid any confrontation with
the children, but if such a confrontation became unavoidable,
that faced with the threat of death or grievous bodily harm, the
standard FBI use of Deadly Force Policy would be in effect. <p>[GARRITY][FN702]
<p>[GARRITY] <p>As the on-scene commander, Glenn had the authority to make such
a modification.[FN703] <p>Potts told this inquiry that he did not realize the Rules
had been changed from deadly force "could" be employed to deadly
force ~"can and should" be employed until after the crisis was
resolved. However, he believes that "should" does not mean
~"must" and that it only serves to heighten the awareness of the
threatening situation at hand.[FN704] <p>Danny Coulson, Deputy Assistant Director of the
FBI at the
time, also recalled the Rules as formulated as using the term
"could" as opposed to "can and should~." He too was unaware that
the proposed operations plan contained Rules of Engagement that
used the term "deadly force can and should be employed.~"[FN705] <p>
  Glenn, the senior FBI manager at the site and commander of
the effort, had never established Rules of Engagement in spite
of years of experience as a supervisory agent. Although Rogers
presented "proposed" Rules, it appears that Glenn gave great
deference to Rogers' expertise, especially in light of the
Rules' Friday night approval by Potts and Coulson at FBI
Headquarters. <p>A lack of documentation in the FBI files made our review of
the approval of the Rules of Engagement very difficult. For
example, we found no entries in the FBI's SIOC log discussing
the draft Rules of Engagement. There are no notes or records of
Potts' and Coulson's initial approval of the Rules. Moreover,
there is no documented approval thereafter. We find this lack
of documentation significant and serious. The FBI prides itself
on its attention to detail. We find no such attention given
here. As was the case here, failing to preserve or create
records could have serious consequences in future criminal or
civil litigation arising out of similar events. The failure to 
record and preserve significant events, meetings, and
discussions should be corrected. <p>
  On Saturday, August 22, written Rules of Engagement were
approved by Glenn, and sent by facsimile to FBI Headquarters as
part of an operation plan sometime between 2:30 and 3:00 p.m.
(PDT) Glenn approved the written Rules in the morning in their
original form and again in the afternoon, as modified to cover
only armed adult males as subjects of deadly force before a
surrender announcement. That plan was not approved. A
negotiations strategy was requested, and other questions were
addressed to Glenn about the deployment and the crisis site. 
Coulson reviewed the plan up to the point where a negotiation
strategy should have been detailed. Finding none, he decided
not to approve the plan and notified Potts and Glen of his
decision.[FN705] No one at FBI Headquarters claims to have seen
the Rules as written in the proposed plan, and an operation plan
was never approved, although a number of plans were submitted
throughout the siege. <p> Before briefing the sniper/observers on the Rules of
Engagement, Rogers asked Glenn if FBI Headquarters had approved
the Rules. Glenn told Rogers that they had been
authorized.[FN707] In his statement to this review team, Glenn
stated that at approximately 12:15 p.m.: <p> [The] operations plan, which included the
ROE, was faxed to
FBIHQ and USMS HQ for review. FBIHQ responded by requesting
that we supply a negotiations option, which was not included in
the plan, prior to approval. However, I was telephonically
advised at that time, I believe by Assistant Director Larry
Potts, that the ROE were approved as formulated and could be
enacted. Based on this approval I informed ASAC Rogers, and the
HRT personnel were briefed on these ROE.[FN708] <p>It is our conclusion that Rogers
justifiably believed that
the Rules of Engagement provided to help the HRT and SOG
personnel were fully authorized. On the trip to Idaho, Rogers
had received oral authorization for the use of special Rules
from Potts and Coulson.[FN709] Finally, before the snipers were
briefed on the Rules and deployed, Rogers secured Glenn's
acknowledgement that FBI Headquarters had approved the final
version of the Rules. <p>Although we found no written record reflecting approval of
the Rules of Engagement, Potts acknowledged that he approved a
version of the Rules early in the crisis without the word
"should" and with the understanding that Glenn had authority to
limit the Rules to "adult males" without Potts' approval. The
only mention of the Rules of Engagement in the FBI's SIOC log is
Coulson's reminder to Glenn about the Rules of Engagement in
response to the latter's report that a SWAT team believed that
it had seen Weaver away from the cabin. [FN710] Coulson's
response is evidence that special Rules of Engagement in some
form had been approved by FBI Headquarters. Potts and Coulson
confirm this conclusion. However, since there is not written
record of specifically what version of the Rules that FBI
Headquarters approved, we cannot confidently say that the word
"should" was approved by FBI Headquarters at any time. 
Nevertheless, since those Rules which contained "should"
remained in force at the crisis scene for days after the August
22 shooting, it is inconceivable to us that FBI Headquarters'
remained ignorant of the exact wording of the Rules of
Engagement during that entire period. <p>(3) The FBI Standard Policy on the Use of
Deadly Force and the
Constitutionality of the Rules of Engagement <p>The FBI's Standard Deadly Force Policy
states that: <p>Agents are not to use deadly force against any person
except as necessary in self-defense or the defense of another,
when they have reason to believe that they or another are in
danger of death or grievous bodily harm. Whenever feasible,
verbal warnings should be given before deadly force is
applied.[FN711] <p> The purpose of the policy is to inform agents of
circumstances when the use of deadly force in the line of duty
is appropriate and to prohibit the use of deadly force in other
circumstances. According to the FBI's training materials, the
policy's importance is its uniformity of instruction,
utilization, and administrative review. Such uniformity
eliminates uncertainty and confusion.[FN712] <p>"Deadly force" is defined in the policy
as force likely to
cause death or serious bodily injury. Under FBI policy, deadly 
force is justified, if the subject is likely to cause death or 
serious bodily injury if not controlled and deadly force is 
necessary to achieve control safely. When deadly force is 
permissible, agents are instructed to utilize the amount of
force reasonably necessary to eliminate the threat they face. 
When feasible, verbal warnings should be given before deadly
force is applied, and, when a subject may be granted an
opportunity to surrender without exposing agents or the public
to unreasonable danger, the policy requires that the
opportunity be given. [FN713] <p>The FBI's standard deadly force policy comports with
the
constitutional standard enunciated by the U.S. Supreme Court in
Tennessee v. Garner, 471 U.S. 1 (1985), and Graham v. Connor,
490 U.S. 386 (1989). Garner requires that the officer have
probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a threat of
serious physical harm, either to the officer or others, before
using deadly force to prevent escape. The standards for
objective reasonableness set forth in Graham are considerably
more explicit than those in Garner and also require
consideration of whether the suspect poses an immediate threat
to the safety of the officers or others.[FN714] The
preconditions in the FBI's deadly force policy for the use of
deadly force are essentially the same as those stated in Garner,
that is, that deadly force may be used to protect oneself or
others against death or grievous bodily harm. The FBI's deadly
force policy also includes a provision for giving warnings, when
feasible, as mandated by Garner. <p>We are considerably less sure about the
constitutionality
of the Rules of Engagement in effect on August 22, 1992 than we
are about the FBI's standard deadly force policy. The Rules
provided: <p> 1. If any adult in the area around the cabin is observed with a
weapon after the surrender announcement had been made, deadly
force could and should be used to neutralize the individual. <p> 2. If any adult male is
observed with a weapon prior to the
announcement deadly force can and should be employed if the shot
could be taken without endangering any children.
 3. If compromised by any dog the dog can be taken out. <p>4. Any subjects other than
Randy Weaver, Vicki Weaver, Kevin
Harris presenting threat of death or grievous bodily harm FBI
rules of deadly force apply. <p> We believe that these Rules contain serious
constitutional
infirmities. First, Garner states that, when feasible, warnings
should be given. However, in paragraph 1 of the Rules, the
giving of warnings apparently releases agents from evaluating
the necessity of using deadly force, that is, from determining
whether the subject "poses a threat of serious physical harm."
Garner at 11. Garner specifically addresses the issue of the
fleeing felon who refuses to surrender and does not sanction the
use of deadly force, unless it is necessary to prevent escape
and the officer has probable cause to believe that the suspect
poses a significant threat of death or serious physical injury
to the officer or others or that he has committed a crime
involving the infliction or threatened infliction of serious
bodily harm. Garner at 11-12. Thus, although paragraph 1 of the
Rules was never employed because Horiuchi used deadly force
before warnings had been given, it falls outside the strictures
of both Garner and Graham, which require that law enforcement
officers evaluate the risk of grievous bodily harm or death to
themselves and or others, before employing deadly force. <p>Paragraph 2 suffers from a
similar problem because it does not
provide for evaluation by the agent of whether the armed adult
male poses an immediate threat before employing deadly force
against them. This contradicts the mandate of both Garner and
Graham. <p>Paragraph 4 suffers from a related defect in that it applies
the FBI standard policy on deadly force to all parties, except
Randy Weaver, Vicki Weaver, and Kevin Harris. The FBI drafted
this Rule in that manner because it considered these three
people particularly dangerous, especially because the agents
believed that Randy Weaver and Kevin Harris had killed Deputy
Marshal Degan. However, Garner and Graham do not exempt law
enforcement officers from evaluating risk to themselves and
others, even from persons they deem especially dangerous. The
Constitution allows no person to become "fair game" for deadly
force without law enforcement evaluating the threat that person
poses, even when, a occurred here, the evaluation must be made
in a split second. <p>Finally, the instructions that deadly force "should be used" in
paragraph 1 and that deadly force "should be employed" in
paragraph 2 flatly contradict the commands of Garner and Graham,
which require the careful evaluation of the risk posed by a
suspect before law enforcement can employ deadly force. The word
"should" strongly encourages the use of deadly force. The use of
such language in the Rules was unconstitutional. Despite FBI
protestations to the contrary, these instructions did not merely
heighten the snipers/observers' sense of dangerousness presented
by the situation but went further and sanctioned the use of
deadly force without the evaluation of the actual threat posed
by individuals encountered by the agents on the mountain. We
believe that these Rules of Engagement created an atmosphere in
which the sniper/observers were more likely to employ deadly
force than had the FBI standard deadly force policy been in
effect. <p>In addition to the aforementioned problems, we must conclude
that the Rules of Engagement were defective for three other
reasons. First, they were imprecise. As we have seen from the
accounts of law enforcement personnel who formulated, approved,
and implemented the Rules, there was no uniform interpretation
of them. Some interpreted the Rules as an expansion of the FBI
standard deadly force policy which allowed the sniper/observers
more leeway on when to fire their weapons. However, others
argued that the Rules restricted the standard policy. There was
also disagreement regarding who fell within the coverage of the
Rules and the term "any adult." Furthermore, many were adamant
that the words "can and should" did not create a mandate to
shoot and that the judgment and discretion of the shooter always
prevailed. Most, however, seemed to agree that the Rules served
to heighten the awareness of danger, thereby reducing the time
sniper/observers had to evaluate whether to shoot. <p> The lack of precision and the
resultant absence of a common
understanding as to when to employ deadly force are serious
problems. Regardless of whether the Rules of Engagement had an
impact upon Horiuchi's decision to shoot, FBI supervisors at the
Ruby Ridge crisis were responsible for giving precise orders
concerning the use of deadly force by their personnel. In our
view, Rules of Engagement that do not restrict the use of deadly
force should not be implemented without clear authorization
following the careful legal review of the proposed Rules. <p>Our second objection to the
Rules relates to the impact the
Rules had upon the HRT during its deployment on August 22. The
Rules seem to have created an atmosphere which Glenn described
as a "more offensive mode." To this extent, we believe the Rules
contributed to Horiuchi's decision to take a second shot.[FN715] <p> Our final objection
to the Rules is that they were an
unconstitutional departure from the FBI's standard deadly force
policy. As noted above, the FBI standard policy requires agents
to assess the level of danger before using deadly force and to
give warnings when feasible. The statements of the
sniper/observers, along with Horiuchi's testimony, demonstrate
that the Rules of Engagement did more than merely "heighten the
awareness of the danger level" on the mountain. The Rules
created an atmosphere that eliminated or significantly reduced
the discretion of the agent to assess the nature of the threat,
thereby eliminating the constitutionally required calculation of 
the threat level before deadly force is used. <p>Nothing in the recent Supreme Court
cases suggests that the
approach adopted in the Rules is unconstitutional. Rather, the
standards enunciated in Garner and Graham emphasize the vital
significance of assessing the "immediate threat of grievous
bodily harm or death to self or others" before law enforcement
officers may use deadly force. However, it is clear from the
sniper/observers' statements that they understood that the Rules
did change and supersede the standard deadly force policy and
that the Rules were to be "abide[d] by."[FN716] Although we
appreciate that evaluations of whether to employ deadly force
may occur in a split-second and should not be judged from the
perspective of hindsight, we must conclude that the Rules in
effect were unconstitutional. The Constitution places the
decision on whether to use deadly force on the individual agent;
the Rules attempted to usurp this responsibility. <H4>b. Initial Deployment of Law
Enforcement Personnel to Ruby
Ridge </H4><p>The FBI viewed the situation at Ruby Ridge as extremely
dangerous. Potts, the Assistant Director of the Criminal
Investigative Division of the FBI, feared that casualties would
be sustained in the attempt to establish a perimeter at the
crisis site. He characterized the situation at Ruby Ridge as
"the most dangerous situation the HRT has ever gone
into."[FN717] Similarly, Coulson, the Deputy Assistant Director
of the Criminal Investigative Division of the FBI at the same
time, assessed the situation as posing an extreme risk to law
enforcement personnel. In his words, "these types of operations
are the most dangerous type of tactical operations that can be
undertaken, especially if the subjects have not been
contained."[FN718] <p>The first priority of the FBI at Ruby Ridge was to secure and
control a perimeter around the Weaver cabin to ensure the safety
of law enforcement personnel and to prevent the escape of those
who may have been involved in the exchange of gunfire the
previous day. In addition, the FBI wanted to obtain information
about the situation based upon firsthand observation rather than
having to continue to rely upon the reports from other law
enforcement agencies. <p>We agree that the deployment of tactical personnel at Ruby
Ridge to establish a perimeter around the Weaver cabin was a
sound decision. Indeed, a consensus exists among FBI tactical
specialists and other professionals in the law enforcement
community that securing and controlling the site should be the
first priority in a crisis. For these reasons, the initial
strategic step by the FBI to deploy HRT sniper/observers and
members of the Marshals Service SOG around the cabin was
appropriate. <p>Another issue surrounding the initial deployment of law
enforcement personnel was the delay in deployment, which
occurred at least six hours after the HRT arrived at Ruby Ridge.
A substantial portion of the delay resulted from the late
arrival of four-wheel drive vehicles to transport the
sniper/observers to the mountain area surrounding the cabin.
This delay was crucial in that the first team of
sniper/observers did not arrive at its position until
approximately 5:00 p.m. Had the sniper/observers been deployed
without waiting for the vehicles, they could have reached their
positions some three hours earlier. Considering the gravity of
the situation and the urgent need to gather intelligence, the
delay was significant. However, the HRT supervisors explained to
us that because of the rugged mountain terrain, they concluded
that four-wheel drive vehicles were critical to a speedy
deployment. Although in retrospect, it may have been advisable
to deploy on foot, we believe that the decision to wait for the
vehicles was reasonable under the circumstances existing at the
time. <p>A final issue presented during the early development period was
the need for a call out or to give a warning to those in the
cabin before an HRT member fired a shot. Constitutional case law
and the FBI's standard deadly force policy require such an 
announcement to be given "when feasible" before deadly force is
used. We find that the management team gave insufficient 
consideration to giving such warnings. Although we do not
believe it was appropriate, or safe, for Horiuchi or any of the
other HRT sniper/observers to give a surrender warning to those
in the cabin after they had arrived in their positions,[FN719]
it was of crucial importance that such warnings be given by
others, if feasible. <p>The plan in effect between the deployment of the HRT
sniper/observers and the time of the surrender announcement was
that contained in the Rules of Engagement which instructed HRT
personnel to use deadly force if armed males were seen outside
the cabin. We believe that FBI management team should have
addressed the probability that once the subjects would come out
of the cabin, especially considering the sounds of the
helicopter and personnel carriers that were present during this
time. <p>The first planned warning, assuming the subjects were contained
in the cabin, was the formal announcement which was to occur
after the personnel carriers had arrived in the cabin vicinity.
The lack of a planned "call out" as the sniper/observers
deployed is significant because the Weavers were known to leave
the cabin armed when vehicles or airplanes approached. The
absence of such a plan subjected the Government to charges that
it was setting Weaver up for attack. We believe that the
management team did not satisfy its obligation to evaluate the
feasibility of giving surrender warnings under those
circumstances. The delay in giving the surrender announcement is
discussed in greater detail below. <p>
 <H4>c. The HRT Rifle Shots Fired on August 22, 1992</H4> <p>(1) The Applicable Standard
for Review <p>The Fourth Amendment provides persons with the right to "be
secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against
unreasonable searches and seizures," and this right extends to
those persons suspected of actual or anticipated criminal
wrongdoing. When police officers arrest a criminal suspect, they
make a seizure, thereby bringing their conduct within the
protection of the Fourth Amendment. The Fourth Amendment and the
case law emanating from it provides that, while there are
important governmental interests in effective law enforcement,
there are equally powerful countervailing interests supporting a
person's right to be free from the intrusiveness which
inevitably accompanies a seizure. <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has considered the question
of seizures
by the use of deadly force and has articulated a framework with
which to analyze their constitutionality. In Tennessee v.
Garner, 471 U.S. 1,7 (1985), the Court stated that "there can be
no question that apprehension by the use of deadly force is a
seizure subject to the reasonableness requirement of the Fourth
Amendment." When a police officer kills or mortally wounds a
suspect while attempting to make an arrest, the ultimate seizure
occurs. Not only is the suspect deprived of his life, in which
he has the most fundamental interest, but society is deprived of
the "judicial determination of guilt and punishment." Id. at 9.
However, the Supreme Court recognized that effective law
enforcement requires that deadly force be permissible in some
circumstances. <p>In Garner, a burglary suspect fled the crime scene while a
police officer pursued him. Although the officer identified
himself and ordered Garner to stop, Garner continued to scale a
fence. The officer, who saw no weapon and who was reasonably
sure that Garner was unarmed, fired shots that killed Garner.
The state statute permitted an arrest by all necessary means if
the suspect had been provided notice of the officer's intent to
arrest him yet persisted in fleeing or forcibly resisting
arrest. The Supreme Court ruled this statute unconstitutional
because it justified the use of unreasonable force, regardless
of the danger that the suspect presented. <p> The Court in Garner enunciated a general
theory permitting the
use of deadly force by police officers: 
[W]here the officer has probably cause to believe that the
suspect poses a threat of serious physical harm, either to the
officer or to others, it is not constitutionally unreasonable to
prevent escape by using deadly force. Thus, if the suspect
threatens the officer with a deadly weapon or there is probable
cause to believe that he has committed a crime involving the
infliction or threatened infliction of serious physical harm,
deadly force may be used if necessary to prevent escape, and if,
where feasible, some warning has been given." 
Id. at 11-12. <p>It was not until 1989 in Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, that
the Supreme Court articulated an objective standard for
evaluating the use of deadly force. In Graham, police had
forcibly detained Graham, a diabetic, and prevented him from
drinking orange juice to prevent the onset of insulin shock. The
police handcuffed Graham and ignored or rebuffed his attempts to
explain and treat his condition. Graham sustained multiple
injuries and was released when it was determined that he had
done nothing wrong. <p>The Supreme Court rejected the subjective standard the district
and appellate courts had imposed which had required Graham to
show that the police had applied force "maliciously and
sadistically for the very purpose of causing harm." Id. at 390
-391 (citations omitted). The Court held that instead of a
subjective standard "all claims that law enforcement officers
have used excessive force -- deadly or not -- . . . should be
analyzed under the Fourth Amendment and its `reasonableness'
standard. . . ." Id. at 395. <p>(2) The First Shot <p>With respect to the objective
reasonableness of each of
Horiuchi's shots, we must examine them in conjunction with the
factors enunciated by the Graham court -- the severity of the
crime, whether the suspect posed an immediate threat to the
safety of the officers or the others, and whether he actively
resisted arrest. <p>Before assuming their position overlooking the Weaver compound,
Horiuchi and the other agents had been briefed about the
encounter at the Y. From this briefing, they knew that a marshal
had been killed; that Weaver had sophisticated weapons
experience; that the family had declared that they would never
surrender to the federal government and were prepared for a
confrontation with the government; that the family was generally
armed when they left the cabin; and that the family made armed
responses to approaching people and vehicles. Although FBI
personnel did not have specific details about the August 21
shooting, they knew: that more than one shot had been fired at
the "Y"; that Randy Weaver, Kevin Harris, and Sandy Weaver had
been there; and that Kevin Harris had shot and killed Deputy
Marshal Degan. In addition, they had been informed that shots
had been fired at an airplane and that there had been
unconfirmed reports of an April 1992 shooting at a news
helicopter near the Weaver compound. <p>Thus, before Horiuchi was in position to react
to the quickly
unfolding events of the evening of August 22, it could be said
that two Graham factors had been satisfied: Horiuchi knew that a
crime had been committed, and he knew that Weaver was resisting
arrest with Harris' assistance. [FN720] <p>With those two factors satisfied, we turn to
the remaining
question of whether the person whom Horiuchi shot posed an
immediate threat to officers or others. Before Horiuchi fired
his first shot, he had two opportunities to shoot, first at the
young girl, then at the unarmed man who was prodding the ground
with a stick. Horiuchi did not shoot either person because he
believed the young female was an unarmed child and that the man
was not behaving in a threatening manner. <p>According to Horiuchi, he fired the first
shot only after he
heard and saw the helicopter. When the person whom he believed
to be Harris reappeared at the side of the shed from which he
had disappeared, he held his weapon at high port and scanned
above and behind Horiuchi's position. Horiuchi believed that the
man was looking for the helicopter. According to Horiuchi, the
man was "watching the helicopter, and at times he would kind of
bring his weapon up and [Horiuchi perceiv[ed] that perhaps he
was trying to get a shot off." [FN721] <p>The person in Horiuchi's sights moved along
the side of the
birthing shed, while holding his weapon high. Horiuchi believed
that the person had seen the helicopter and was trying to get to
the other side of birthing shed. Horiuchi concluded that the
person was preparing to shoot at the helicopter with his scoped
rifle. [FN722] He saw the individual watching the area where
Horiuchi believed the helicopter was flying and saw the man
"getting ready to take a shot at the individuals in the helicopter."[FN723] <p>
[GARRITY] <p>[FN724] Horiuchi "assumed that [the man] was raising [his
arm] to grab inside the building to spin himself around the
corner." [FN725] It was at this time that Horiuchi fired one
shot. At the time that Horiuchi shot, the man was at the corner
of the shed, with his back toward Horiuchi. According to
Horiuchi, he was aiming at the man's back at the time he fired
the shot. [FN726] After the shot was fired, the man suddenly
moved along the side of the birthing shed and disappearing from
Horiuchi's vision. <p>
 Horiuchi's colleague's, who were able to see the events at the
cabin, gave considerable corroboration for his perceptions. Dale
Monroe, Horiuchi's teammate, heard the helicopter and noticed it
flying around the Weaver cabin. He "thought [the Weaver group
was] going to shoot at the helicopter from various fortified
positions around the cabin....." Although Monroe's view was
obstructed by the brush, he eventually spotted an adult male
with a rifle near the birthing shed just before he heard the
first shot. Monroe assumed that "the immediate danger.....was
to the helicopter". [FN727] Jerome Barker saw two males and a
female, all armed with long barreled weapons, move from the
residence to the birthing shed. He believed that they "posed a
grave threat to the safety of the helicopter as well as
[him]self and [HRT members] Curran, Horiuchi and Monroe." Barker
was telling his partner Curran of their location so that Curran
would "be prepared to encounter them at they approached" when he
heard a shot from Horiuchi's position. [FN728] <p>Some of Horiuchi's perceptions as he
fired the first shot were
not accurate. At trial, Horiuchi was adamant that he never saw a
gun in the hands of Randy Weaver, even though Weaver was armed
at the time he was struck by Horiuchi's first shot. [FN729] <p>
 [G.J.], [FN730] Horiuchi was incorrect. Several HRT
sniped/observers on the mountainside and Harris himself confirm
that Sara Weaver, Randy Weaver, and Kevin Harris were all armed
at the time they came out of the cabin. [FN731] <p>Although we are troubled by
Horiuchi's inaccurate perception
of some of the facts when we took the first shot, we do not
think that these misperceptions affected his ability to assess
the risk presented. Indeed, we find his perception of the facts
most relevant to our inquiry to be reliable and reasonable. More
specifically we find reliable and reasonable his perceptions
that the target was an armed man; the helicopter was in flight;
and that the movements of the man indicated a threat to the
helicopter. Based on these perceptions, Horiuchi, as well as the
two other snipers, who were able to see the movement around the
cabin, believed that the safety of both the people in the
helicopter and the snipers were threatened by the armed
individuals <p>
 [G.J.] <p>Special Agent in Charge Glenn noted that, on a reconnaissance
mission on which he was a passenger, the helicopter was forced
by bad weather to "stay at low altitudes and weave around the
crisis site in an effort to avoid being an obvious target."
[FN733] Glenn believed that the helicopter was within range of a
rifle shot. [FN734] <p>
 Weaver and Harris have stated that their actions were innocent
and not indicative of aggressive conduct. According to them,
they left the cabin to view Sammy Weaver's body in the birthing
shed an to retrieve a battery. We are skeptical of this account.
Indeed, we think it is unlikely they would have timed such
innocent activities to coincide with event which would expose
them to enhanced risk by leaving the secure cabin and venturing
to an unprotected area when armed law enforcement personnel were
nearby. Therefore, we find their explanation implausible. We are
convinced that because of their knowledge of and involvement in
the previous day's shooting of a marshal, the heavy traffic
below that was audible in the cabin, and the loud helicopter
flights above the Weaver cabin, that the cabin occupants knew
that law enforcement personnel were in the area. In light of the
circumstances, we believe they probably came out in response to
the noise of the helicopter and the personnel carriers, not
simply for the innocent reasons they offer. Accordingly, we
believe that Horiuchi reasonably interpreted the actions of the
three people as they ran from the cabin as aggressive. <p>The law requires that we give
some deference to Horiuchi's
perceptions of the threat to the helicopter and the individuals
aboard it. Indeed, the Supreme Court in Graham cautions that
"the `reasonableness' of a particular use of force must be
judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the
scene, rather than with the 20/20 vision of hindsight." Graham,
386 U.S., at 396. In Graham the Supreme Court also advised that,
in assessing the reasonableness of the use of deadly force, one
must allow for the fact that police officers are often forced to
make split- second judgments in these circumstances, like those
at Ruby Ridge, that are tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving.
As the Sixth Circuit emphasized in Smith v. Freland: <p>[W]e must avoid substituting our
personal notions of proper
police procedure for the instantaneous decision of the officer
at the scene. We must never allow the theoretical, sanitized
world of our imagination to replace the dangerous and complex
world the policemen face every day. What constitutes
`reasonable' action may seem quite different to one facing a
possible assailant than to someone analyzing the question at
leisure. <p>
954 F.2d at 347 <p>Applying these standards to the first shot taken by Horiuchi,
we conclude that the first shot meets the constitutional
standard of "objective reasonableness". We accept Horiuchi's
justification for the first shot. Based on the circumstances
present at the time, we find it reasonable for Horiuchi to
believe that the armed male he observed was preparing to shoot
down the helicopter. <p>(3) The Second Shot <p>We now look at the immediacy of the
threat factor to evaluate
whether the second shot was justified. The second shot, after
passing through the window of the cabin door, killed Vicki
Weaver who was standing behind the door and also seriously
injured Kevin Harris. <p>As a preliminary matter, the two conditions we found satisfied
in regard to the first shot -- the reasonable conclusion that
the suspects had been involved in a severe crime and that they
were actively resisting arrest -- were satisfied at the time of
the second shot. Again, our focus must be on whether the target
of Horiuchi's shot posed an immediate threat to the officers or
others. <p>In our discussion above, we found that when Horiuchi fired the
first shot, he made a judgment of threat and necessity based on
his observation that the armed male posed an immediate threat of
death or serious harm to the occupants of the helicopter.
Horiuchi admitted that, after taking the first shot, he intended
to shoot at that man again, given the opportunity, because the
threat the subject posed would increase after he returned to the
cabin. [FN735] Horiuchi feared that once the man returned to the
cabin, he would have been more protected and could have shot at
the HRT personnel or the helicopter. Horiuchi felt that the man
probably knew that law enforcement personnel "couldn't shoot
back in there without harming some of the children." [FN736] <p>The second shot raises
serious questions. On one hand,
Horiuchi believe that at least one subject was armed and had
intended to shoot at the helicopter, and that the subjects now
knew at least generally where a sniper was located. However,
this perception must be evaluated in conjunction with the
reality that the subject were returning to their home and had
not returned fire when shot upon. Thus, their actions as they
ran into the cabin were not aggressive, but rather protective or
defensive. <p>We find Horiuchi's explanation of the threat and necessity of
the second shot speculative. Based on the facts known and the
actions of the subjects, we do not believe it was reasonable to
perceive an immediate threat as they ran back into the cabin.
Once the family was back in the cabin, the potential threat to
the safety of the helicopter and law enforcement personnel was
more remote than when Horiuchi had earlier believed that the
armed male was about to position himself to shoot at the
helicopter. Although we believe Harris and the Weavers knew that
law enforcement personnel were present, no call out or surrender
announcement followed the first shot. The subjects were never
given a chance to drop their arms to show that they did not pose
a threat. The subjects simply did what any person would do under
the circumstances: they ran for cover. <p>Horiuchi also confused his targets. He
erroneously believed
that the last man returning the cabin as the man he had
originally tried to shoot. Thus, Horiuchi never saw Harris, the
target of his second shot, take any threatening action toward
the helicopter. <p>Many of the sniper/observers saw three people running to the
cabin after the first shot. None reported ny action that could
immediately be interpreted as threatening to the helicopter or
the sniper/observers. In a statement Horiuchi prepared later
that evening, he explained that, just before Harris entered the
cabin, he "stopped at the door looking for either the helicopter
or where the shot came from...." [FN737] Thus, even Horiuchi
does not characterize these movements as threatening or as
provocation for the second shot. Indeed, he admitted that he had
already decided to shoot when Harris paused in front of the
door. Horiuchi testified at trial, " I had already made that
determination after that first shot, so if I saw him again I was
going to shoot at that individual again." [FN738] <p> Although we agree that Harris and
the Weavers could have fired
from inside the cabin, we do not believe that this potential,
especially considering the circumstances of the this case,
warranted law enforcement to perceive an immediate threat. Since
the exchange of gunfire at the Y, no one at the cabin had fired
a shot. Indeed, they had not even returned fire in response to
Horiuchi's first shot. Furthermore, at the time of the second
shot, Harris and others outside the cabin were retreating, not
attacking. They were not retreating to an area where they would
present a danger to the public at large or take members of the
public hostage. [FN739] Instead, they were retreating into a
cabin and within rifle shot of well equipped law enforcement
personnel. Finally, as we discussed below, prior to this time,
law enforcement personnel had not viewed the presence of Weaver
and Harris in the cabin as posing a particular threat. In our
view these facts undercut the immediacy of the threat that
Harris posed to Horiuchi and his colleagues. <p>At Ruby Ridge, FBI supervisors in charge
of the crisis
determined that, following the deployment of HRT
sniper/observers around the cabin, a negotiation strategy was to
be employed, at least initially, to solve the crisis. [FN740]
The supervisors has decided that the safest solution to the
crisis was to contain the Weaver/ Harris group and induce its
members to leave the cabin through negotiations. This strategy
contemplated that sniper/observers would surround the cabin
while Weaver and Harris were inside with weapons. It can be
assumed that the FBI command contemplated that, during
negotiations, risk form the cabin would be tolerated in the hope
of a peaceful resolution. The plan did not contemplate the use
of deadly force as the only safe alternative. Indeed, plans to
assault the cabin because of a perceived immediate threat had
been rejected earlier in the day. Horiuchi's explanation of the
threat is, therefore, contrary to the approved negotiation
strategy. <p> However, even if Horiuchi's judgment on the necessity to use
deadly force was supportable, we believe that his second shot
was taken without regard for the safety of others near Harris.
Although Horiuchi could not see behind the front door of the
cabin, he had reason to believe that someone might be on the
other side when he took his second shot. At trial he testified
that it appeared that Harris "was trying to hold the door open
or moving somebody out of the way" when Horiuchi fired. [FN741]
When asked if he "knew there was somebody behind the door,"
Horiuchi responded that he "wasn't shooting at the individual
behind the door." [FN742] However, by fixing his cross hairs on
the door, when he believed someone was behind it , he placed the
children and Vicki Weaver at risk, in violation of even the
special Rules of Engagement: <p>If any adult male is observed with a weapon prior to the 
announcement deadly force can and should be employed if the
shot could be taken without endangering any children. (Emphasis
added.) <p>(GARRITY) <P>
In our opinion he needlessly and unjustifiably endangered the
persons whom he thought might be behind the door. [FN743] <p>(GARRITY) <p> [FN744]. We
also find no evidence that Vicki Weaver was
the intended target of the second shot as has been alleged.
Horiuchi testified that he did not intend to shoot her. [FN745]
Our review of the evidence has produce nothing to discredit
those statements. <p>In sum, even giving deference to Horiuchi's judgment, we do
not find that the second shot was based on a reasonable fear of
"an immediate threat to the safety of officers or others."
Moreover, we believe that the shot was unnecessarily dangerous
and should not have been taken. <p>
We understand that the FBI standard policy on the use of
deadly force has been interpreted as permitting deadly force
when it is "necessary," that is, "when alternative steps are not
likely to lead to safe control of the subject." [FN746] Some in
the FBI interpret "safe control" to mean "in custody." [FN747]
We are not convinced the this interpretation is sound policy and
point out that the interpretation could allowably argue the use
of deadly force whenever a dangerous person refuses to
surrender, even is less violent measures could be used to
apprehend the person. Such an approach raises serious
constitutional concern. <p>Supervisory Special Agents John Hall and Kimberly Crawford of
the Legal Training Unit at the FBI prepared a legal analysis of
the Ruby Ridge incident and determined that Horiuchi's shots
were "reasonable under constitutional standards" [FN748]. The
Hall/ Crawford analysis concludes that Horiuchi "has a
reasonable basis for believing that the two armed, male suspects
at whom he fired his rifle met the constitutional criteria for
dangerousness" and the both shots were necessary, that is, "no
safe alternatives were available to accomplish the seizure" of
Harris and Weaver. [FN749] In particular, they concluded that
the second shot was necessary to because "permitting a
demonstrably dangerous (and armed) person to regain a position
of cover and concealment dramatically increases the potential
threat to effect the seizures of the suspects." [FN750] <p>Hall and Crawford quote
Garner for the proposition that deadly
force is justified in preventing the escape of a suspect, "if
the suspect threatens an officer with a weapon" or" there is
probably cause to believe that [the suspect] has committed a
crime involving the infliction of serious physical harm."
[FN751] They conclude that because Horiuchi reasonably believed
that his targets had "`committed a crime involving the
infliction of serious physical harm' [to Deputy Marshal Degan],
it was reasonable to believe that `the [targets] pose[d] a
threat of serious physical harm'" to Horiuchi and his
colleagues. Finally, the conclude that "[t]he Fourth Amendment
does not require a showing that the threat was `imminent.'"
[FN752] <p>We reject this analysis to the extent that it implies that a
reasonable belief that a suspect has committed a crime involving
the infliction of serious physical harm eliminates the necessity
of considering whether a threat is imminent before deadly force
is used. The Hall/Crawford analysis accurately quotes Garner as
saying `deadly force may be sued to prevent escape", if "the
suspect threatens the officer with a weapon or there is probable
cause to believe that he has committed a crime involving the
infliction.....of serious physical harm." [FN753] However,
this language was not intended to indicate that deadly force,
without something more, could be used. Indeed, the following
language in Garner was meant to explicate the previous sentence:
"Where that officer has probable cause to believe that the
person poses a threat of serious physical harm, either to the
officer or to others, it is not constitutionally unreasonable to
prevent escape using deadly force." [FN754] Thus, the use of
deadly force in such situations still requires that the officer
have "probable cause to believe" that the person "poses a threat
of serious physical harm." Such a requirement is consistent with
the explicit holding of Garner announced earlier in the decision
that deadly force "may not be used unless it is necessary to
prevent [an] escape and the officer has probably cause to
believe the subject poses a significant threat of death or
serious physical harm." [FN755] Finally, the immediate threat
requirement is reiterated in the Supreme Court in its conclusion
that the "proper application" of the Fourth Amendment to the use
of deadly force requires "careful attention to a number of
factors, which include not only "the severity of the crime at
issue," but also "whether the subject poses an immediate
threat." [FN756] <p>We conclude that, even if Horiuchi reasonably believed that
Weaver and Harris had participated in Degan's killing, he still
had to consider the imminence of the threat his targets posed to
himself and his colleagues when he fired. Considering the
totality of the circumstances of the second shot, we have
concluded that the retreating subjects did not pose an imminent
threat of physical harm. <p>We cannot fault Horiuchi alone for these actions. We are
persuaded that his judgment to shoot at the armed man again, if
given the chance, was influenced by the special Rules of
Engagement, which he had no role in creating but which he was
instructed to follow. We believe that Horiuchi fired his second
shot and Wenger prepared to shoot because the Rules of
Engagement had a significant effect on the snipers/observers'
sense of danger and had encouraged their use of deadly force.
[FN757] <p>Although we believe that, even under the special Rules,
Horiuchi should not have taken a shot into the door with the
possibility that persons other than the other than the target
could be injured, the responsibility for taking that shot may
not rest exclusively with Horiuchi. As we noted above, the
special Rules of Engagement were subjected to different
interpretations as to who was a subject and what conduct could
be required before a shot could be taken. This inquiry finds
that the Ruled expanded the use of deadly force beyond the scope
of the Constitution and beyond the FBI's own standard deadly
force policy. Despite this conclusion, we are convinced that
those who prepared the Ruled believed that their provision were
within the law. <p>Having made these finding, we have proposed recommendations at
the conclusion of this report. However, because we remain
seriously troubled by the circumstances that surrounded the
second shot, we recommend referral of the matter of the second
shot to the appropriate component of the Department of Justice
for a determination of whether federal criminal prosecutive
merit exists. <p>(4) Use of the Helicopter to Draw Subjects Out of the Cabin <p>This
inquiry found no evidence to support the allegation that
the FBI intentionally used the helicopter to lure the Weavers
and Harris out of the cabin so that they would be a target for
HRT snipers. Utilization of overhead observation to collect
information at a crisis site and to determine the possible
presence of confederates or individuals in areas adjacent to the
crisis site is a well recognized technique that gathers critical
information for those responsible for responding to crisis
situations. <p>Notwithstanding this conclusion, we believe the FBI
supervision of sniper/observers on the mountain was handled
poorly. From information received at the Marshals Service, FBI
management had reason to believe that the Weaver/ Harris group
would respond to a helicopter in the vicinity of the cabin by
coming outside with firearms. Notwithstanding this knowledge,
they placed sniper/observers on the adjacent mountainside with
instructions that they could and should shoot armed members of
the group, if they came out of the cabin. Their use of
helicopter near the cabin invited an accusation that the
helicopter was intentionally used to draw the Weaver group out
of the cabin. <p>When asked it the helicopter could have been utilized to draw
the Weaver subjects out of the cabin, HRT and SOG personnel were
unanimous that such a tactic would not be sound strategy in that
it would subject those in the helicopter to severe risk. We
agree that the intentional use of a helicopter in such a fashion
would be unwise. In view of the fact that three senior law
enforcement officials were in the helicopter when Horiuchi fired
the first shot, it is unlikely that the helicopter was used
intentionally as a lure. <p>However, we do believe that greater thought should have been
given to the fact that Randy Weaver and Kevin Harris probably
would come out of the cabin when the helicopter flew in the
vicinity. We believe that the deployment of sniper/observers
with the instructions that they "can and should" use deadly
force against armed males outside the cabin, concurrent with the
use of the helicopter, set the stage for the rifle shots on
August 22. By not anticipating the consequences of snipers in
position and helicopter in flight while special rules of
engagement were in force, the FBI invited an accusation of an
intentional lure. Other than rumors, we found no evidence to
support allegations of the helicopter's use in such a fashion. <p>(5) Surrender
Announcement <p>In examining the early stages of HRT's involvement in the
crisis, the question of the timing of surrender announcement
arises, namely, whether before or during the deployment of HRT
personnel, the FBI could have announced to those in the Weaver
cabin area the presence of law enforcement and could have
demanded their surrender. <p>When a crisis presents a heightened possibility that
federal
law enforcement may employ deadly force, those who have created
the crisis situation should be notified, when feasible, that law
enforcement personnel are in the area and that they should
surrender. Indeed, the standard deadly force policy of the FBI
requires that the agents issue a warning, when feasible, before
deadly force is employed. <p>At Ruby Ridge, it was of paramount importance to give
notice
to those in the Weaver cabin at the earliest feasible
opportunity, given the Rules of Engagement in effect during the
initial stages of the FBI operation. The FBI had a good reason
to believe that the people in the cabin had a least a general
knowledge of law enforcement's presence. [FN758] It is less
certain whether they were aware of the imminent danger of being
shot when they left the cabin before Horiuchi fired. [FN759] <p>There was no attempt by
the FBI to give notice to the
individuals in the cabin prior to the shots taken by Horiuchi.
However, immediately after the shots, at approximately 6:15
p.m., two armored personnel carriers were driven to the vicinity
of the cabin and a surrender announcement was made. In our view,
the factor that caused the FBI to make the surrender
announcement at that time was Horiuchi's shots. <p>The Rules of Engagement underscore
the importance of the
timing of the surrender announcement and make inexcusable and
unjustifiable delay in giving the announcement. The announcement
should have been a priority at Ruby Ridge, not a rushed
afterthought. The FBI should have explored whether it was
possible to make a surrender announcement before deploying
sniper/observers. We believe it was possible to make an
announcement earlier. Perhaps the announcement could have been
made without great risk by using an armored personnel carrier or
a sound transmitter from a safe distance. At a minimum, we
believe that more consideration should have been given to this
crucial part of the operation, particularly in light of the
Rules of Engagement in effect. <p><h3>4. Conclusion</H3>  <p>We find that the decision
to deploy the FBI's HRT and
components of the U.S. Marshals Service SOG to the Ruby Ridge
site was proper. However, the Rules of Engagement drafted by the
FBI were improper and failed to comply with constitutional
standards regarding the use of deadly force by a law enforcement
officer. The Rules were also a departure from the FBI's standard
policy on the use of deadly force. Implementation of such Rules
may have created an atmosphere that caused an HRT
sniper/observer to take a shot that he otherwise would not have 
taken. The imprecision of the Rules resulted in wide
misunderstandings regarding the authorized use of deadly force
by law enforcement personnel. In addition, the Constitution
requires that surrender announcements be given, where feasible,
before deadly force may be employed. For this reason, we believe
that the FBI should have given a higher priority to making a
surrender announcement at the earliest possible opportunity. <p>We believe that in
examining the "totality of the
circumstances" surrounding the first shot taken by the
sniper/observer, the shot met the constitutional standard of
"objective reasonableness." Applying the same analysis, we
believe, that the second shot did not meet that standard.
Although we did not believe that the existence of an immediate
threat is a precondition for the legitimate use of deadly force,
we do believe that its presence or absence is important. In this
case, we conclude that the sniper/observer did not have a
reasonable fear of an immediate threat to the safety of law
enforcement personnel or others when he fired the second shot.
We find that the circumstances which justified the first shot
were significantly changed by the time the second shot was
taken. There had been no return of fire or further threatening
action, there had been no surrender announcement, and most
significantly, the targets were retreating into the cabin. In
addition, we note that the sniper/observer's perception that the
armed adults' return to the cabin would create an enhanced
danger was inconsistent with the FBI plan in effect which was to
attempt negotiation with the occupants of the cabin. As a result
of these changed circumstances, we conclude that the second shot
violated the Constitution. We recommend that the circumstances
surrounding the second shot be reviewed by the appropriate
component of the Department of Justice for prosecutive merit. <p>

Coulson reminded Rogers of a 1988 HRT deployment in Utah, which
had resulted in the only killing of a law enforcement officer
during an HRT operation. Coulson believed that the Utah
incident was strikingly similar to the Weaver crisis. According 
to Coulson, in the Utah case, BATF had requested the FBI to assist
in apprehending Adam Swapp who had been implicated in the
bombing of a Mormon temple. Like Randy Weaver, Swapp was a
survivalist who armed himself, his associates, and family
members. The HRT was deployed to assist the Salt Lake City
Division in apprehending Swapp. Thereafter, a standoff occurred
during which Swapp and other adults routinely left their
residence while armed. Throughout the siege, Swapp and others
threatened law enforcement personnel, fired upon the perimeter
of the FBI agents, and resisted arrest. At the end of the
siege, a young boy, who was confined to a wheelchair, shot and
killed a local police officer from a window of the house as HRT
members and other law enforcement personnel attempted to
apprehend Swapp. Coulson and Rogers discussed at length the
circumstances of the 1988 case, and Coulson expressed concern
that the HRT would incur casualties if adequate precautions were
not taken at Ruby ridge. ID. at 4-5. <p>

 583 Potts continued: <p>
 ROE are utilized as a method of assisting tactical personnel in
identifying and refining the perception of the level of risk. 
They are never intended to obviate the standard FBI deadly force
policy. When HRT deploys, the initial mission is to isolate and
contain subjects. Sniper/observers are usually utilized to
begin this task, and they are usually deployed immediately. ROE
are established and given these personnel as a means of further
identifying the level of risk, in a concise manner.... <p>
 As stated in the document ROE provide, in part: <p>
 'If any adult in the compound is observed with a weapon after
the surrender announcement is made, deadly force can and should
be employed to neutralize the individual. If any adult male is
observed with a weapon prior to the announcement, deadly force
can and should be employed, if the shot can be taken without
endangering the children.' Although I personally would not
normally, and did not use the word 'should' in that context, it
is my belief that it only serves to heighten the awareness of

     590 Gore explained: <p>
  In addition to the willingness to shoot a law enforcement
officer as shown by the killing of DUSM Degan, the ROE [Rules of
Engagement] were predicated on the totality of the intelligence
information as provided up to that time, again primarily by the
USMS. Weaver had been reported to have a large cache of weapons.
It had been initially reported he was a Green Beret during his
military service and that he had opportunity for 18 months to
fortify his compound during the extended fugitive investigation
by the USMS. I was also aware that newspaper articles had been
written suggesting that Weaver would not be taken alive. It was
also remarked that he would not come down from the hill.... This
intelligence, at times, also included that he possibly possessed
infrared equipment, explosives, hand grenades and had placed
booby traps. <p>

  At Ruby Ridge, shots had been fired by subjects unwilling to
submit to arrest by the federal government. the ROE were needed
to inform HRT members going into a continuing crisis between the
government and these subjects, that they were moving in under
great risk, and that an individual in that compound with a
weapon was already a deadly threat. I am not saying that a
decision to shoot would be made for anyone, nor am I saying that
ROE would order an individual to shoot. ID. <p>

to approach the cabin were arrested by the Idaho State Police. 
On Tuesday, August 25, 1992, five men were arrested after their
vehicle was stopped five miles south of the crisis site in
Naples, Idaho. The previous day, one of these men had purchased

people running toward the cabin. At the time of the second
shot, an adult male dove toward the front door. Monroe could
not tell if the male had been hit. Monroe Sworn Statement,

  Approximately 30 seconds after the first shot, Wenger was
three people running toward the cabin with a female in the lead. 
The female and male entered the cabin. The second male stopped
on the porch and appeared to look in the direction from which he
had come. While Wenger was lining up a shot, he saw the
individual flinch before dropping below the vision of his scope. 
He heard unintelligible female screaming for approximately ten
to twenty seconds, but did not see a female. Wenger Sworn

  Whitcomb saw three people running toward the cabin. When
they reached the front porch, he heard a second shot. The porch
roof obstructed his view, and he was nothing more. While the
people were outside, Whitcomb attempted to shoot, but was unable
to do so because of obstructions and the speed with which they
moved. Whitcomb Sworn Statement, December 7, 1993, at 7. <p>

them, he heard a second shot. Bamford Sworn Statement, August

     716 Barker Sworn Statement, August 31, 1992, at 2.  After
reviewing the statements and testimony of the sniper/observers and
Horiuchi, we have concluded the Horiuchi's decision not to shoot
the two armed males on sight is probably a testament to his
training, given the Rules on which he had been brief at least three
times that day.  Those Rules directed him to dispense with the
usual assessment of harm, to dispense with warnings, even if
feasible, and to shoot armed males who emerged from the cabin.<p>

     718 Coulson Sworn Statement, November 3, 1993, at 6.<p>
     719 A primary function of sniper/observers is to remain
undetected.  Consequently, an announcement by sniper/observers once
in position would, in our view, unwisely disclose their position. 
Horiuchi acknowledge at trial that he could have stood up and told
Weaver and Harris to drop their weapons.  However, he also
testified that "yelling may not have been effective" and that he
"didn't have the time or the distance or probably the voice loud
enough to yell at either Weaver or Harris to drop the weapon." 
Horiuchi Trial Testimony, June 3, 1993, at 169<p>
     720 We believe Harris' behavior indicates that he was
resisting arrest.  After engaging in the firefight that killed
Degan, Harris retreated with Weaver to the cabin and emerged only
when armed.  There was no indication that Harris or any member of
the Weaver/ Harris group was going to surrender to law enforcement.<p>

     735 Assistant U.S. Attorney Lindquist, one of the attorneys who
prosecuted Weaver and Harris, asked Horiuchi during the trial
preparation why he believed that the conduct of the subjects, as
they retreated to the cabin, constituted offensive action even
under the standard FBI deadly force policy.  Horiuchi explained
that the subjects had been aggressive and that, if they got back to
the house, Horiuchi and his colleagues would be exposed to fire
without being able to fire back because of the children in the
cabin.  Lindquist Interview, December 2, 1993, Tape 6, at 21-22.<p>
     736 Horiuchi Trial Testimony, June 3, 1993 at 111.  Horiuchi
was not  the only person disposed to shoot again.  As Wenger
watched three people running to the cabin, he "began to line up a
shot with [his] sniper rifle....." Wenger Sworn Statement, August

     743 Ironically, Horiuchi's decision to shoot at the door is
inconsistent with the justification he gave for the shot.  Horiuchi
testified that, once the subjects were in the cabin, the would be
able to fire out and be protected from return fire because the HRT
"probably would not have shot at anyone inside the house for fear
of shooting the children."  Horiuchi Trial Testimony, June 3, 1993,

     745 Id. at 140.<p>
     746 John Hall and Kimberly Crawford, Supervisory Special
Agents at the Legal Training Unit at the FBI Academy, have
concluded that Horiuchi's second shot was necessary because
"permitting a demonstrably dangerous (and armed) person to regain
a position of cover and concealment dramatically increases the
potential threat to future efforts to effect the seizures of the
suspects."  Therefore, in their view, Horiuchi reasonably concluded
that the armed men at whom he fired were likely to cause death or
serious bodily injury, if not controlled, and that the use of
deadly force was necessary to achieve control safely.  Hall/
Crawford Memo, December 2, 1993, at 5.<p>

     757 We note that, having given several sworn statements on the
topic, Horiuchi and HRT Commander Rogers declined to make a
statement to us during the course of this inquiry.<p>
     758 For instance, Glenn concluded that those in the cabin
"were continuing to resist arrest, knowing that law enforcement
personnel were amassing around them because of the large number of
vehicle they would have seen/heard coming up the road in the valley
on a Friday night." Glenn Sworn Statement, January 12, 1994, at 14.<p>
     On Saturday morning, August 22, before HRT's arrival, the
Portland SWAT team leader heard someone he believed to be Randy
Weaver yell words to the effect of "Get the hell off my property." 
The FBI believed that Weaver knew he was addressing law enforcement
officials.  FD-302 Interview of Paul Hudson, October 5, 1993, at 3;
Sworn Statement of E. Michael Kahoe, December 7, 1993, at 6. 
Furthermore, the helicopter mission occurring at the time Horiuchi
took the two shots was the sixth reconnaissance mission by the HRT
helicopter that day.<p>
     759 Gerald McLamb, one of the non-government negotiators who
helped resolve the crisis, said that Randy Weaver did not mention
whether he knew that law enforcement personnel were posted around
the Weaver cabin when he left the cabin to go to the birthing shed.

 <TITLE>The Shooting at Ruby Ridge</TITLE>Released through<P> COUNSEL CONNECT<P>
COUNSEL CONNECT is a communications and information service

<H3>IV. SPECIFIC ISSUES INVESTIGATED</H3><P>
<H3>H.   Law Enforcement Operations at Ruby Ridge From August 22,
1992 Until August 31, 1992.</H3><P>
          <H3>1.   Introduction</H3><P>
     Following the death of Deputy Marshal Degan, the FBI assumed
primary jurisdiction over the investigation of the events relating
to his death.  The FBI's handling of the investigation at Ruby
Ridge has been criticized on several grounds:  that the
FBI's command and control of the crisis site was not handled
properly in that insufficient emphasis was placed on negotiations
to resolve the crisis; that the FBI failed to coordinate law
enforcement components properly; and that false information was
knowingly given to the media to cover up the cause of Sammy Weaver's
death, Vicki Weaver's death, and Kevin Harris' and Randy Weaver's
injuries.<P>
     Soon after learning on August 21, 1992 about the shooting
incident at Ruby Ridge, U.S. Attorney Maurice Ellsworth
authorized Assistant U.S. Attorney Ronald Howen to travel there to
assist law enforcement personnel with legal matters.  Howen arrived
late in the evening of August 21st and spent the next ten days with
law enforcement personnel who had responded to the crisis.<P>
     Questions have been raised as to whether it was appropriate
for Howen to have been at Ruby Ridge and whether some of his
activities were improper and conflicted with his role as the
federal prosecutor in the case.  Foremost among these allegations
is that he was an active participant in tactical decisions,
negotiations, and searches which transformed him into a witness in
the investigation at Ruby Ridge.<P>
          <H3>2.    Statement of Facts</H3><P>
<H4>a.   Removal of Law Enforcement Personnel From the
Mountain Following Horiuchi's Shots</H4><P>
     When the personnel carriers were near the Weaver cabin
delivering the initial announcement and installing telephone
communications equipment, worsening weather conditions were
reported on the hill.  HRT Gold Team leader Love reported to HRT
Sniper Coordinator Hazen that visibility was poor and getting worse
and that optical equipment was beginning to fog.  Several of the
snipers were suffering from hypothermia. [FN771]  Hazen
recommended to HRT Commander Rogers that the sniper/observers be
removed from their positions and return to the lower command
post.[FN772]<P>
     Rogers and Special Agent in Charge Glenn agreed to withdraw
the sniper/observers and establish an inner perimeter around the
cabin area the following morning.  Glenn concluded that the weather
and poor visibility made it nearly impossible even for people with
knowledge of the terrain, like the Weaver/Harris group, to move
about without being detected.  On the basis of the available
intelligence, Glenn believed that the only way that Weaver and his
group could leave the cabin area was by a road that passed through
the FBI command post area.  The sniper/observers were withdrawn
after dark on Saturday evening, August 22.<P>
     During the night, Glenn deployed FBI SWAT teams around the
command post and controlled access to the road leading to the
Weaver compound.  He was confident that these measures would
prevent any of the Weaver group from fleeing.[FN774]  According to
Hazen, the sniper/observers were also withdrawn for debriefings on
the tactical and geographic information they had gathered while
observing the Weaver compound.[FN775]<P>
     Upon returning to the command post after the shooting, the HRT
sniper/observers were debriefed and were instructed to document
their actions and observations in FD-302 investigative reports.
Glenn had reported the shooting incident to FBI Headquarters
earlier in the evening.<P>
          <H4>b.   Command and Control Structure</H4><P>     The death of Deputy Marshal
Degan entailed violations of
federal criminal statutes that gave the FBI primary jurisdiction
over the investigation.[FN776]  Eugene Glenn, Special Agent in
Charge of the FBI's Salt Lake City Division, was assigned primary
responsibility for managing the federal law enforcement response to
the crisis.  He was initially assisted by William Gore, Special
Agent in Charge of the FBI's Seattle Division.  As of August 23,
Glenn was also assisted by Robin Montgomery, Special Agent in
Charge of the Portland Division.<P>
     In addition to intelligence gathering, the primary concerns of
local and federal law enforcement were to rescue the surviving
marshals, along with the body of Deputy Marshal Degan, apprehend
the subjects without further loss of life, and prevent their
reinforcement by sympathizers.<P>
     State and local officers and a few representatives of the
Marshals Service and the border patrol were the first law
enforcement officials on the scene.  two FBI agents, Larry Wages
and Thelma Campos, who were attending personal matters in the area,
heard about the shooting and responded.  Soon after, a group of
interested citizens began to gather.<P>
     Following Deputy Marshal Hunt's calls for emergency
assistance, in which he reported that a Deputy Marshall had been
shot and that others were pinned down, local law enforcement
agencies responded promptly and established a controlled access
point at the bridge leading to the Weavers' cabin.  Idaho State
Police officers and a dispatcher arrived before their local
commander, Captain E. Glen Schwartz arrived at 3:00 p.m.  Captain
Schwartz described the command structure as a "unified command"
with each agency in charge of its own personnel.[FN777]  On
August 21, 1992, Idaho Governor Cecil Andrus declared a state of
emergency in Boundary County, proclaiming that:<P>
the nature of the disaster is the occurrence and the
imminent threat of injury and loss of life and property
arising out of the standoff situation in Boundary
County.[FN778]<P>
     This proclamation allowed law enforcement agencies on the
scene to use certain emergency services, such as Idaho National
Guard resources.[FN779]<P>
     Although Deputy Marshal Hunt was viewed as having the
predominant law enforcement interest because the case was his and
he was responsible for the marshals on the mountain, local law
enforcement leaders believed that Hunt's decision making capacity
had diminished due to stress.  They have asserted that they would
not have permitted Hunt to make ill-advised decisions.[FN780]<P>
     Glenn arrived at the crisis site at approximately 9:30 p.m. on
Friday, August 21, followed by Gore approximately one and a half
hours later.  They both arrived before the FBI's Hostage Rescue
Team (approximately 50 agents) and the Marshals Service Special
Operations Group (approximately 58 agents).  In Glenn's view, the
Idaho State Police, commanded by Major Strickfaden, appeared to be
coordinating the law enforcement response before his arrival.
[FN781]<P>
     When Glenn arrived, the primary goal of the law enforcement
effort was to rescue the marshals on the mountain and stabilize the
situation until additional federal resources arrived.  Glen ordered
that a perimeter be established around the command post/staging
area to ensure safety, to prevent Weaver and his associates from
coming into the area during the night, and to contain a crowd of
Weaver sympathizers and supporters.[FN782}<P>
     Glenn and Gore were unfamiliar with the crisis site.  The
command post/staging area was located in a flat area at the base of
the mountain on which the Weaver cabin was located.  Glenn and Gore
directed FBI technical personnel to establish telephone
communications at the command post.[FN783]<P>
     Once the command post was secure, Glenn and Gore set about
gathering information about the Weaver group.  When Richard Rogers,
Commander of HRT, and Duke Smith, Associate Director of the U.S.
Marshals service, arrived early Saturday morning, August 22, Glenn
and Gore briefed them on the situation.[FN784]<P>
     The command post log entry for August 26 shows that power to
the cabin was cut off on Saturday night, August 22.  On Sunday
morning, a 360 degree inner perimeter around the Weaver cabin site
and a forward command post near the cabin were established, and
they were maintained for the remainder of the crisis.[FN785]<P>
     On August 23, Special Agent in Charge Robin Montgomery from
the FBI's Portland Division reported to the Ruby Ridge site and
took charge of the forward command post near the cabin were
established, and they were maintained for the remainder of the
crisis.[FN785]<P>
     On August 23, Special Agent in Charge Robin Montgomery from
the FBI's Portland Division reported to the Ruby Ridge site and
took charge of the forward command post in alternating twelve-hour
shifts with Gore.  Rogers and the hostage negotiators were also in
the forward command post with Gore and Montgomery.  The forward
command post was the central point for both tactical and
negotiations efforts.[FN786]<P>
     Investigative and intelligence functions continued at the rear
command post, but the establishment of the forward command brought
about a change in the control of the massive resources gathered at
Ruby Ridge.  Glenn remained at the rear or lower command post to
marshal the many law enforcement agencies, coordinate with the
leaders of those agencies, and maintain liaison with FBI
Headquarters and the press.[FN787]<P>
     Glenn retained ultimate approval authority for negotiation and
tactical efforts proposed by his subordinates.  If emergency
tactical action were necessary, Glenn authorized Gore and
Montgomery at the forward command post to act.  A representative of
the Marshals Service was also assigned to the forward command post
to ensure immediate access to information gathered during the
previous fugitive investigation that might assist in formulating
negotiation strategies.[FN788]<P>
<H4>c.   Tactical Operations and Discovery of Sammy Weaver's Body</H4><P>
     On Sunday morning, August 23, Rogers, with Glenn and Gore's
approval, took two teams of HRT personnel to the vicinity of the
Weaver compound in armored personnel carriers.  Using a bull horn,
Rogers made repeated announcements to the Weaver cabin for about 30
minutes to convince the occupants to negotiate.[FN789]<P>
     FBI Hostage negotiator Frederick Lanceley asked to accompany
Rogers, but Rogers told him that he was not needed.[FN790]  As a
consequence, Lanceley was not present during this attempt to
communicate with those inside the cabin.[FN791]<P>
     According to Lanceley, on Sunday afternoon, after Rogers and
his team returned, Rogers told Lanceley that he had "delivered an
ultimatum to the effect that if they don't come out, [Rogers] would
begin to knock down the outbuildings and then start knocking down
their house."[FN792]  Rogers asserted that he now had to knock down
the buildings because he could not back down from the ultimatum.
[FN793] Lanceley told Rogers that the destruction of the buildings
would limit negotiations strategies.[FN794]<P>
     FBI hostage negotiator E. MacArthur Burke was astounded upon
hearing that the outbuildings were to be removed because this might
escalate the situation before negotiations had begun.  Although he
was aware of the tactical advantage to their removal, he agreed
with Lanceley that it would be detrimental to the negotiations
effort.[FN795]<P>
     On Sunday evening, August 23, with the approval of Glenn,
Gore, and Montgomery, personnel carriers began to remove
outbuildings, such as the birthing shed and the water tanks, near
the Weaver cabin to protect tactical personnel, should it become
necessary to mount an emergency assault on the Weaver cabin.
Removal of the outbuildings would also tighten the inner perimeter
around the cabin by removing visual and physical obstructions to
HRT and SOG personnel.[FN796]<P>
     During the clearing of the birthing shed, the body of Sammy
Weaver was discovered unexpectedly.[FN797] There is no evidence
that law enforcement personnel knew of Sammy Weaver's death
before this discovery.[FN798]<P>
     FBI negotiators reported to the FBI's Special Operations and
Research Unit on the morning of August 24 that "the mood among the
commanders and HRT appeared to be to mount an assault on the Weaver
residence no later than the evening of 8/24".[FN799]  The discovery
of Sammy weaver's body brought about renewed efforts to negotiate
with the Weaver group.  The discovery also brought aggressive
tactical actions, such as removal of the outbuildings,
to an end. It was believed that the Weavers would break their
silence to express their wishes for the handling of their son's
body and funeral arrangements.  However, there was no response from
the Weaver cabin.[FN800]<P>
<H4>d.   Change from Rules of Engagement to the FBI
Standard Deadly Force Policy</H4><P>
     On Wednesday, August 26 at 10:53 a.m. (PDT), the Rules of
Engagement in effect since the arrival of the Hostage Rescue Team
were revoked.  At Glenn's direction, the FBI's standard policy
became the guideline for the use of deadly force by law enforcement
personnel deployed on the cabin perimeter.[FN801]<P>
     On Sunday evening, August 23, after Sammy Weaver's body had
been discovered, Glenn began to reevaluate the intelligence he had
received at the command post.  The cabin's occupants had not acted
aggressively since the apparent attempt to fire on the helicopter
about 24 hours earlier.  A personnel carrier had been to the front
of the cabin and had not been challenged, and outbuildings had been
demolished without fire from the cabin.  An inner perimeter had
been established, and booby traps had not been found.  Glenn
believed that law enforcement personnel on the scene were
adequately protected.  He concluded that those in the cabin were
not as threatening as originally believed or that their resistance
was weakening.  He did not entirely dismiss their propensity for
violence, but concluded that the threat had diminished by Sunday
evening.[FN802]<P>
     For these reasons, Glenn changed the Rules of Engagement to
the FBI's standard deadly force policy.  He did not solicit
Headquarter's advice on the change because it was not necessary.
[FN803]<P>
Glenn stated that he made the change some time around midday
Monday, August 24.  This contradicts the HRT sniper log, which
shows that the change occurred on Wednesday, August 26.  The
Strategic Information and Operations Center ("SIOC") Log at FBI
Headquarters reflects the change on August 26 at 12:30 p.m. EDT.<P>
     Within a day or two of the discovery of Sammy Weaver's body,
Glenn told Gore that FBI agents assigned to the crime scene had
reported that some of the early assumptions about the Degan
shooting were in question and had not been substantiated by the
crime spans.  Glenn also told Gore that the debriefings of the
marshals involved in the shooting and a review of the BATF case had
raided other questions.  According to Gore, the entire predicate of
the federal effort was in question.  Gore observed that the crisis
situation had been stable for several days and that the Weaver
group had not engaged in aggressive action.  Glenn then decided to
return to the FBI's standard policy on the use of deadly force.
[FN804]<P>
     Robin Montgomery arrived at the crisis site on August 23 and
learned of the Rules of Engagement.  Montgomery believed that the
Rules were close to an authorization to shoot on sight.  He did not
believe that the Rules supported the negotiation effort, and he
discussed them with Glenn, Gore, Duke Smith of the Marshals
Service, and possibly two other members of the Marshals Service.
Shortly thereafter, the Rules of Engagement were changed.
[FN805]<P>
     Rogers stated that by Wednesday the level of threat had
diminished because the subjects had fired no shots since the
original firefight and they had not committed any aggressive acts.
HRT personnel had established well protected positions, completely
surrounding the Weaver cabin.  The subjects posed no immediate
threat, and consequently the Rules of Engagement were changed to
the FBI's standard deadly force policy.  Rogers denied that the
revocation of the Rules was related to the discovery of Sammy
Weaver's body.[FN806]<P>
     According to an entry in the FBI SIOC Log at Headquarters, on
Wednesday, August 26, 1992, at 12:30 p.m. (EDT), Potts and Glenn
agreed to change the Rules of Engagement to FBI standard deadly
force policy, effective 1:00 p.m. (EDT).[FN807]  There is no record
of  the decision to change the Rules of Engagement in the FBI's
command post log at Ruby Ridge.  The HRT sniper/observer log shows
that Rogers changed the Rules of Engagement to the FBI standard
deadly force policy on Wednesday, August 26, at 10:53 a.m.
and that each sniper/observer position acknowledged the change at
10:54 a.m.[FN808]<P>
               <H4>e.   Evidence of Vicki Weaver's Death</H4><P>
     On Friday, August 28, at approximately 5:00 p.m., Bo Gritz, a
nongovernmental negotiator, started a series of discussions that
ultimately led to the resolution of the crisis without additional
violence.  Gritz was the first person to be told that Weaver's wife
was dead and the first aside from those in the cabin to observe
Vicki Weaver's body.<P>
     Law enforcement personnel state that the initial evidence that
Vicki Weaver was dead came in the first few moments of the first
conversation Gritz had with Randy Weaver on August 28.
[G.J.]<P>
     [FN809] This conversation also confirmed that Harris had been
wounded by HRT rifle shots on August 22.  At the conclusion of the
conversation, Gritz briefed Rogers and Glenn.  Later that day, he
also informed a group of sympathizers gathered near the crisis
site.<P>
     The efforts of Gritz and Jack McLamb, another nongovernmental
negotiator, were successful, and on Sunday, August 30, between
mid-morning and noon, Harris agreed to surrender, an important
development for several reasons, not the least of which was that
for the first time Gritz talked face-to-face with Randy Weaver.
When Gritz and McLamb met Harris at the rear door of the residence
and helped hi down the stairs, the cabin door opened, exposing
Weaver and the interior.<P>
     Later, Gritz saw Vicki Weaver's body on the kitchen floor,
partially under a table.[FN810] A cloth had been placed over the
top half of the body, leaving the lower half exposed. The feet were
positioned near the front door, with the head and torso toward the
interior.  The manner in which the body was positioned was
consistent with a backward fall from the front doorway. It appeared
to Gritz that the body had not been moved after the shooting.<P>
     [G.J.]<P>
     [FN811]<P>
     A review by the FBI of all audio and video tapes of the events
at Ruby Ridge shows that no information had been received by the
FBI or other law enforcement personnel about Vicki Weaver's death
before Gritz' conversation with Randy Weaver on August 28.
Interviews of personnel from the FBI, U.S. Marshals Service, Idaho
State Police, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, and local
agencies at the scene during the standoff do not reveal any earlier
knowledge of Vicki Weaver's death.  No notations concerning Vicki
Weaver's death were found in any official log of the events or in
any other records made during the standoff. [FN812]<P>
               <H4>f.   Initial Steps Toward Negotiation</H4><P>
     On August 22, Glenn and Rogers focused much of their energy on
the procurement and outfitting of two armored personnel carriers
with a telephone and enough line to reach the command post from one
Weaver compound, a distance of approximately one mile.<P>
     Glenn believed that resolution of the crisis through dialogue
and negotiations was the most desirable and usually the safest
outcome.  He stressed that the FBI tried every proposed negotiation
option from the beginning of the crisis.[FN813]<P>
     Gore also believed that the objective was peaceful resolution
of the crisis.  In his view, tactical personnel first had to
establish a means to communicate with the Weaver group in the
cabin, which did not have a telephone.  The objective of the
operations plan was to establish a perimeter for containment of the
crisis site and to get close enough to establish communications.
[FN814]<P>
     FBI senior hostage negotiator, Frederick Lanceley was notified
of the situation at Ruby Ridge Friday afternoon, August 21.  He
traveled with the main group of HRT personnel from the Washington,
D.C. area to Idaho, arriving early in the morning on Saturday,
August 22.  He received no request for consultation on negotiations
until mid-afternoon Saturday, August 22, when he was called to the
command post and asked to write a negotiations addendum to the
proposed operations plan.  He was not consulted before the
submission of the initial plan, which FBI Headquarters rejected
because it did not contain a negotiations component.[FN815]<P>
     Early in the crisis, Lanceley was not a party to the
discussions among command personnel.  Nevertheless, he believed
that they intended to resolve the crisis tactically.  He was
unaware of discussions between Glenn and other command personnel
concerning negotiations.  He strongly criticized the tactical
actions taken, and he regretted not being more aggressive in
voicing his objections on Saturday, August 22, and again on Sunday
evening, August 23, when he opposed removal of the outbuildings.
[FN816]<P>
     The initial negotiations strategy was to approach the Weaver
cabin, read a surrender statement over a loudspeaker, and attempt
to resolve the crisis through the surrender of the Weaver group.
The surrender announcement was to be read after tactical personnel
had established a 360-degree perimeter around the Weaver compound.
If the Weaver group did not surrender following the announcement,
a hostage phone was to be delivered and telephone wire was to be
laid down the mountain from the cabin to the command post.<P>
     Immediately after Horiuchi's shots, HRT Commander Richard
Rogers decided to drive two armored personnel carriers to the cabin
area to deliver a telephone and establish communications with those
inside the cabin.[FN817] When the carriers were within 30 to 50
feet of the cabin, Lanceley made the following surrender
announcement at approximately 6:30 p.m. on Saturday night:<P>
Mr. Weaver, this is Fred Lanceley of the FBI.  You should
understand that we have warrants for the arrest of
yourself and Mr. Harris.  I would like you to accept a
telephone so that we can talk and work out how you will
come out of the house without further violence.  I would
like you or one of your children to come out of the
house, unarmed, pick up the telephone and return to the
house.[FN818]<P>
     There was no response to Lanceley's message.  The telephone
was placed approximately twenty yards from the cabin.  Both
carriers left, laying wire for the phone as they returned down the
mountain.  Continuous attempts to contact the Weaver group by
ringing the telephone were made throughout the night.  There was no
response.<P>
          <H4>g.   Continuing Efforts of the FBI Hostage Negotiators</H4><P>
     In mid-morning, Sunday, August 13, following the return of the
HRT sniper/observers to their positions, Rogers took the two
carriers back to the position near the Weaver cabin where they had
been the previous night.  The telephone was in the same position
they had left it the night before.  This required all communication
with the cabin to be made by bullhorn or megaphone.  Rogers spoke
to the group in the cabin for approximately 30 minutes encouraging
them "to come out, pick up the phone, establish dialogue, and let's
move on with this and establish some kind of communications".
[FN819] Rogers claims to have heard no response from the Weaver
cabin.<P>
     Two assault teams were deployed from the carriers to establish
a 360-degree cordon around the cabin.  According to Rogers, the
assault personnel could not be seen from the cabin.  After this
deployment, between 20 and 21 assault personnel were around the
cabin continuously until the resolution of the crisis on August
31.[FN820]<P>
     The nature of Commander Rogers' message to the Weaver group on
Sunday morning is at issue.  According to Lanceley, before Rogers
and his team ascended the mountain, Lanceley asked Rogers if
Lanceley could accompany him to the cabin area.  Rogers told
Lanceley that he would not be needed.[FN821]<P>

     [FN822]<P>
     [G.J.]<P>

There was no response from the cabin.[FN823]<P>
     During Bo Gritz' discussions with the Weaver group later in
the week, Weaver and his daughters told Gritz that they had
developed an intense hatred for Lanceley because of remarks
directed to Vicki Weaver and questions he asked about what they
were having for breakfast.  Weaver said these remarks "pissed them
off" and strengthened their resolve in the cabin."[FN824]<P>
     On August 21, the HRT supervisors told behavioral scientists
in the FBI's Special Operations and Research Unit about the HRT
deployment and provided them with the limited information
available.  On August 23, the behavioral scientists were given
incomplete additional information.  When FBI Supervisory Special
Agent Clint Van Zandt developed the profile, he was not aware that
shots had been fired on August 22; that Vicki Weaver had been
killed [FN825]; or that anyone had been wounded.  He said that the
shooting incident would affect the way in which the Weaver family
perceived attempts by the government to negotiate.[FN826]<P>
     The behavioral scientists sent an assessment to the crisis
site on August 24.  This assessment included several observations
and suggestions for dealing with the Weaver group: the Weavers will
not trust negotiators connected to the federal government;
Randy Weaver's resolve would be strengthened if he has contact with
local supporters; third parties should be considered to assist the
negotiations; the Weaver group, including Vicki Weaver, her
children, and Harris, could be expected to meet any attempt to
enter the residence with armed resistance; if Vicki Weaver believed
that efforts to overwhelm them physically or otherwise drive the
Weavers from their home would be successful, she could be expected
to kill the children and commit suicide; as those inside the cabin
became fatigued, the Weaver group could resort to a suicide attack
directed against federal law enforcement officials, if they
believed the perimeter was too close to the cabin.<P>
     On Tuesday, August 25, FBI negotiators continued their
efforts, which included statements directed at Vicki Weaver and
expressing concern for the family's welfare.  The Weaver group was
repeatedly asked to surrender, and they were assured that they
would not be harmed. There was to response.[FN827] The command
post log states that water to the cabin was cut off on August 25.<P>
     The first contact with Randy Weaver occurred on Wednesday,
August 26.  In mid-morning, Lanceley told Weaver that the personnel
carrier would approach the cabin to transfer the telephone to the
robot and that the robot would approach the cabin with the
telephone to improve communications  weaver was also told that the
robot would try to push the telephone through a cabin window,
breaking the cabin window in the process.  Weaver shouted "Get the
fuck out of here" and made other statements that could not be
understood.  In the afternoon, Weaver said that he would not take
the telephone.<P>

     On Friday, August 28, Marnis Joy again unsuccessfully tried to
establish contact with her brother.  Later that day, Randy Weaver
stated that he would talk to Bo Gritz.[FN831]  Glenn approached
Gritz, and he offered to assist in negotiating with Weaver.  Gritz
convinced Glenn that because Gritz and Weaver had a common
background in the Special Forces, Gritz had a better chance of
talking to Weaver than anyone else on site.  After conferring with
Rogers and Headquarters, Glenn agreed to Gritz' participation.
[FN832]<P>
     On Friday afternoon, Gritz was briefed by Rogers and FBI
negotiators. At dusk, he went up the mountain toward the Weaver
cabin.[FN833] After trying unsuccessfully to communicate with
Weaver using the robot and then a bullhorn from the personnel
carrier, Gritz walked to the cabin. Through a window, he began to
talk to Weaver. When Gritz asked if everyone was "OK," Weaver said,
"No...My wife was shot and killed last Saturday."[FN834] At that
time Gritz also learned that Weaver and Harris had been wounded.
[FN835]<P>
     Law enforcement components at Ruby Ridge told us that they
first learned that Weaver, Kevin Harris, and Vicki Weaver had
been shot and that Vicki Weaver was dead from Gritz' conversation
with Weaver on August 28.[FN836]<P>
     On Saturday morning, August 19, Gritz received permission to
return to the Weaver residence with Jackie Brown, a friend of the
Weaver family, and Chuck Sandelin, a local minister. Weaver yelled
at Sandelin to get off the property. Sandelin left and was not
used in negotiations again.[FN837]<P>
     Rogers tried to discourage Jackie Brown from approaching the
cabin.  According to Brown, Rogers told her that, if she did not
come out of the Weaver cabin within a reasonable time, he would
assume that she had joined the Weavers or had been taken hostage
and that HRT may have to come in to rescue her.[FN838]<P>
     Gritz and Brown went to the cabin.  Gritz spoke throughout the
day with Weaver, his daughters, and Harris through the cabin wall.
Gritz believed by the sound of Harris' voice that he was in need of
medical attention.  In addition to suggesting that Harris needed
medical attention, Gritz conversed casually with Weaver about the
military, spoke philosophically to him, and prayed with him.
[FN839]<P>
     On Sunday morning, Gerald McLamb, a retired Phoenix police
officer who was assisting Gritz in his campaign for President,
began assisting Gritz in the negotiations.  Both negotiators
focused their conversations with Weaver and Harris on Harris' need
for medical attention.  In mid-morning, Harris decided to
surrender.[FN840]<P>
     Gritz resumed conversations with Weaver, who agreed to the
removal of Vicki Weaver's body from the cabin.  When Gritz and
Brown returned to the cabin with a body bag, Gritz wore a
transmitting device that allowed the forward command post to
monitor his conversation.  For security reasons, Rogers insisted on
this precaution.  According to Mr. Gritz, Vicki Weaver's body was
positioned in the location or very near the location where
she fell at the time of her death.  Brown and Gritz carried Vicki
Weaver's body to the forward command post.[FN841]<P>
     After delivering the body, Gritz saw Brown return to the cabin
with some water and begin cleaning blood from the floor.  Brown
reported that, at her request, she was given two five gallon
buckets of water, three white bath towels, and a roll of paper
towels.  Brown said she cleaned Vicki Weaver's blood from the cabin
floor because she did not want the Weaver girls to have "to deal
with cleaning the blood of their mother."[FN842]<P>
     Gritz resumed speaking with Weaver and learned that the Weaver
family was convinced that the law enforcement personnel wanted to
kill each of them.[FN843]  Weaver told Gritz that he wanted to
surrender, but that his daughters would not let him. While in the
cabin Gritz noted the armaments available to the Weavers and the
configuration of the cabin structure.  He relayed this information
to Rogers.[FN844]<P>
     According to Gritz at some point on Sunday, Rogers told him
that, regardless of the day's events, HRT was going to assault the
residence on Monday and that the assault would involve blowing out
the windows and doors.  Gritz disagreed with this plan and was
disturbed because he felt negotiations were going well and because
he was concerned about the possibility of injuring those in the
cabin.  Gritz discussed strategy with Rogers that involved
"physically taking down" Weaver and his daughters, if an assault
was initiated, to protect them from injuries.[FN845] both Gritz and
McLamb felt uncomfortable with the assault strategy, but agreed it
was the only way to protect the Weavers from being "killed in a
tactical assault by HRT."[FN846]  At trial, Rogers testified that
he vetoed an arrangement with Gritz and McLamb to overpower Weaver,
if he did not surrender. [FN847]<P>
     On Monday, Gritz and McLamb returned to the Weaver residence.
Gritz had the robot and the APC move away from the cabin.  After
contacting attorney Gerry Spence, Gritz told Randy Weaver that
Spence would represent him.  Gritz also carried a handwritten note
from Assistant U.S. Attorney Howen to Weaver that agreed to allow
Weaver to present his account of the situation to a grand jury.
The Weaver family surrendered on August 31. [FN848]<P> <H4> i.   Decision to Send Howen
to Ruby Ridge</H4><P>
     In the afternoon of August 21, U.S. Marshal Michael Johnson
informed U.S. Attorney Ellsworth about the shooting at Ruby
Ridge.[FN849] Shortly thereafter, Ellsworth informed Howen, the
Assistant U.S. attorney to whom the Weaver matter had been
assigned, about the incident. The Marshals Service gave Ellsworth
and Howen an additional briefing.[FN850] Based on this information,
Ellsworth and Howen believed that a team of marshals had been
involved in an undercover operation at Ruby Ridge, that there had
been a confrontation in which Deputy Marshal Degan had been killed
in an exchange of gunfire, and that several marshals were still
"pinned down" at the scene of the shooting.[FN851]<P>
     After having been apprised of the crisis, Howen drafted an
application for a search warrant with a supporting affidavit.
[FN852] Howen soon realized that it would be difficult to draft
this affidavit as well as subsequent applications in Boise when
the supporting factual information was 400 miles away at Ruby
Ridge.  Howen suggested to Ellsworth that he travel to Ruby
Ridge.  Ellsworth agreed.[FN853]<P>
     Ellsworth envisioned that, at Ruby Ridge, Howen would assist
in drafting applications for search warrants and supporting
affidavits, as well as prepare applications for electronic
surveillance.  He did not intend that Howen play an investigative
or tactical role.[FN854] Although Ellsworth did not recall giving
Howen specific directives, he noted that the standing directive in
his office was that assistants should not engage in activities that
would make them a witness in a case.[FN855] Howen believed that his
presence at the scene would allow him to see matters first hand and
prepare his case.  In addition, Howen considered himself to be the
representative of the United States Attorney and as such
responsible for reporting to him about events at the scene.[FN856]<P>  <H4> j.   Howen's
Activities at Ruby Ridge</H4><P>
     At Ruby Ridge, Howen was involved in preparing criminal
complaints, applications for arrest warrants, search warrants, and
emergency electronic surveillance applications with supporting
affidavits.[FN857] He denied that he assumed an investigative role
or that he directed the activities of the FBI. Howen insisted that
he did not conduct any interviews while at Ruby Ridge.[FN858]
Nonetheless, Howen conceded that he was not a mute observer.  For
example, Howen was present at the Boundary County Sheriff's Office
when Deputy Marshals Roderick and Cooper were interviewed.  Other
than asking a few questions, Howen stated that he was not an active
participant in these interviews and he was unable to recall if he
took notes.[FN859] Howen said that at these interview he "basically
the marshals and asked question, but he did not consider these
exchanges to be interviews.[FN861]<P>
     Howen denied being involved in formulating strategy or
participating in negotiations between law enforcement personnel and
Weaver.  However, he did write one of the notes sent to Weaver
during the negotiations.[FN862] FBI Agent Rampton told
investigators that Howen was not involved in the negotiations
process and that Howen told him that he should remain separated
from that process. [FN863]<P>
     On August 24, Howen was present at the search of the Y.
[FN864] Special Agent Venkus told investigators that he invited
Howen to go on the search and that Howen did not find any
evidence.[FN865] Howen also participated in the walk-throughs
that occurred later in the week of August 24.  With the exception
of the walk-through with Deputy Marshal Norris, in which Howen
participated completely, Howen believed that he only participated
in parts of the walk-throughs.  He could not recall if he took
notes.[FN866]  However, he conceded that he may have taken notes
during the searches and walk-throughs when he heard something of
interest.[FN867]  Special Agent Wayne Manis recalled that Howen
participated in the walk-through with Hunt and that Howen asked
questions and took notes.  Manis thought that Howen's conduct
was appropriate.[FN868] Special Agent George Calley recalled
Howen as a member of the grou that participated on an August 30
walk-<P> <B>[[  PAGES 255-262 UNAVAILABLE  ]]</B> <P>   Finally, the profile developed
by the FBI's behavioral
sciences personnel was based on incomplete information, thus
leading to inappropriate negotiation strategy.  Initially, the FBI
Special Operations and Research Unit was not informed of the HRT
rifle shots fired on August 22 or of the fact that Harris might
have been wounded.  According to the behavioral scientists who
compiled the profile, the shooting incident would affect the way
the Weaver family perceived negotiations.  The scientists reported
that their assessment would have been different, had they been told
that shots had been fired and that someone might have been wounded.
[FN901] This information was critical to the development of an
accurate profile of Randy Weaver.<P>
     The failure of on-site supervisors to communicate accurate
information appears to have had a negative impact on the attempt to
resolve the crisis through negotiation.<P>
     (2)  Balance of Tactical and Negotiation Strategies<P>
     In a crisis situation in which a deliberate assault option is
considered a necessary part of overall strategy, a written
operational plan for the assault must be submitted to the FBI
Headquarters for approval.  On the other hand, emergency tactical
operation, whether or not they will contribute to the ultimate
resolution of the crisis, are the responsibility of both the
Special Agents in Charge and the HRT command structure at the
crisis site.<P>
     FBI hostage negotiator Lanceley was critical of FBI crisis
management at Ruby Ridge.  When he attended Rogers' initial
briefing, he was surprised and shocked by the Rules of Engagement
and did not believe them to be consistent with the FBI's standard
deadly force policy.  They were the most severe rules he had seen
in hundreds of prior crises.  Lanceley described the situation:<P>
[T]here was a barricaded subject at the top of a mountain, no
hostages, family present and plenty of cover for perimeter
personnel.  The [Deputy Marshal] were no longer pinned down
and the subject was barricaded at a location which had few of
the problems inherent to crises that one would encounter in an
urban setting.  there had been on gunfire since the previous
morning at the time of the firefight with the [Deputy
Marshals].[FN902]<P>
     Lanceley told this inquiry that, when he heard Rogers tell the
group that this would be "no long siege," Lanceley knew that Rogers
did not intend to engage in negotiations.  Following the briefing,
Lanceley conveyed his perception to Rogers and told officer in the
HRT command post.  Rogers' response, "good," confirmed Lanceley's
belief that there would be no negotiations.[FN903]<P>
     When he arrived at the command post, Lanceley told Special
Agent in Charge Glenn that he was available and proceeded to work
on intelligence gathering. Lanceley withdrew from the management
structure and was not party to the discussions of command
personnel, who he believed intended to resolve the crisis
tactically.  Lanceley is not aware of discussion among Glenn and
other command personnel which considered a negotiations strategy
because he was not consulted before the rejection of the operations
plan.[FN904] After the plan had been rejected in mid-afternoon on
August 22, Lanceley was called to the command post and asked to
write an addendum.  He understood FBI Headquarters had rejected the
operations plan because it did not contain a negotiation component.<P>
     Lanceley strongly criticized the tactical actions taken,
despite his absence from meetings in which command personnel
discussed and approved strategy.  Lanceley told this inquiry that
he regretted not being more aggressive on August 22 and again on
August 23, when he chose not to voice objections to Glenn about
removing the outbuildings.[FN905]<P>
     Another FBI Hostage negotiator, E. MacArthur Burke, believed
that it was Lanceley's responsibility, as senior FBI negotiator, to
press the issue of negotiation.  Burke concluded that negotiators
and SWAT personnel are highly trained and Special Agents in Charge
are not as well prepared to handle the often opposing forces
weighing in favor of tactical or negotiated resolutions.  Burke
believed that the negotiation-free operations order showed that the
negotiation and tactical elements of the Ruby Ridge response were
considerably out of balance.[FN906]<P>
     In contrast to Burke, FBI negotiator Wilson Lima spoke of
Glenn's commitment to establishing communications with the Weaver
cabin from his arrival on the evening of August 21.  The next
morning, Glenn agreed that a phone should be given to the Weaver
group.[FN907]<P>
     We are aware that the structure of the HRT and its impressive
machinery may tend to overtake the negotiators' role in a crisis
situation where an inexperienced commander is in charge.  Such a
charge has arisen in this case.  The lack of balance between the
negotiation and tactical efforts created an atmosphere supporting
a tactical resolution from the very beginning.<P>
     The strong influence of the HRT management team at the scene
is reflected in the way Bo Gritz' participation at the crisis site
was finally authorized.  According to Gritz, Glenn told him that
before Glenn would authorize his participation, he would have to
confer with Rogers and FBI Headquarters.  There is no evidence that
Lanceley was consulted before Gritz was permitted to join the
effort to resolve the crisis.[FN908]<P>
     From the information gathered during this inquiry, it appears
that no operations plan was ever approved throughout the entire
siege.  Unfortunately, FBI records provided during this inquiry do
not contain all the operations plans.  The records are so
incomplete that we can not verify this conclusion.<P>
     In our opinion, the available records reflect insufficient
consideration of negotiation strategy as compared to tactical
approaches.[FN909] We have been told that the lack of a negotiation
component in the initial operation plan did not reflect a lack of
intent to negotiate, but the understanding that tactical personnel
had to establish communications with the Weaver cabin before
negotiations could begin.  We have been told that the first
objective of the operations plan was to establish a perimeter
containing the crises site and to get close enough to establish
communications.[FN910]<P>
     [G.J.]<P>
     [FN911 -- G.J.]<P>
     While we credit the argument that it was necessary to secure
the site before negotiations could commence, we find much evidence
that a negotiation strategy was not the highest priority of the FBI
crisis management team.  We note the following: the failure to
consult with a negotiations expert while formulating the initial
operations plan; the failure to bring an FBI negotiator along on
Rogers' mission to the cabin on Sunday morning; the failure to
inform adequately FBI behavioral scientists that shots had been
fired and that someone in the cabin might have been wounded; and
repeated misinformation form the site that shots had been fired
from the cabin on August 22.  These facts give weight to the
complaint that the management team favored a tactical strategy over
a negotiation strategy to resolve the crisis.  We find that
position disturbing and look to the FBI to establish a mechanism to
ensure a more even balance between the two strategies in the
future.<P>
               <H4>d.   Evidence of Vicki Weaver's Death</H4><P>
     It has been alleged that law enforcement officials knew that
Vicki Weaver was dead before Randy Weaver spoke with Bo Gritz on
August 28.  The allegation accuses the FBI of covering up its
knowledge of Vicki Weaver's death in order to conceal that it
intentionally shot and killed her.  We find no factual support for
that position and find that the allegation is totally without
merit.<P>
     The foundation for the allegation is speculation.  For
example, questions have been raised as to why during the electronic
monitoring of conversations inside the Weaver cabin did law
enforcement personnel not become suspicious when Vicki Weaver's
voice was not heard.  In our view this can be explained by the poor
quality of the audio recordings and by the fact that 16 year-old
Sara Weaver's voice may have been mistaken for her mother's.<P>
     There were also unconfirmed reports of something resembling a
body bag on the back porch of the Weaver cabin.  This, according to
the allegation, was another indication that law enforcement had
earlier knowledge of Vicki Weaver's death.  A deputy marshal at the
scene reported that he was told by an unidentified individual that
"there was something wrapped on the back porch that could possibly
be a body, and there was a `smell of death'. It was related to me
as adult size." [FN912] The marshal believed that if such a bag
were on the back porch, it contained the body of Kevin Harris not
Vicki Weaver.[FN913] This would be a reasonable assumption on the
part of the marshal in light of Horiuchi's report that he may
have shot Harris with his second shot.<P>
     It is the conclusion of this inquiry that law enforcement
personnel did not know of Vicki Weaver's death before Friday,
August 28 when Randy Weaver informed Bo Gritz.<P>
               <H4>e.   Howen's Activities at Ruby Ridge</H4><P>
     Howen was present throughout the crisis at Ruby Ridge.  We
find nothing inappropriate about his presence or his conduct.
Indeed, considering the remoteness of the Weaver property and the
need for expeditious applications for search warrants and Title III
authority, we believe that there was a legitimate need for a
representative of the U.S. Attorney to be at Ruby Ridge.  Most
individuals questioned that it was appropriate for Howen to be a
Ruby Ridge and observed no improper conduct.<P>
     As the prosecutor in the case, Howen had an understandable
interest in learning about the shootings at Ruby Ridge, as well as
becoming familiar with the evidence.  He was present at some of the
interviews of the marshals, but primarily as an observer.  The fact
that he may have asked some questions and may have taken some notes
was not improper.  No one characterized Howen as orchestrating or
controlling the interviews.  Special Agent Caster reported seeing
Howen take the marshals aside and talk to them but he had no
knowledge of what was discussed.<P>
     The only suggestion that Howen may have been a more active
participant came from Gore's impression after talking to an agent.
Such an impression is not evidence of prosecutorial misconduct.
Although others reported Howen talking to individuals on the scene
and taking notes, there was no evidence that these conversations
were improper.  Indeed, Howen needed to obtain information to draft
necessary legal documents.  Furthermore, as the persecutor in the
case, it is understandable and appropriate that Howen took notes of
matters that would assist him in preparing the case.<P>
     With the exception of drafting legal documents for search
warrants and Title III authority, there was no evidence that Howen
was in a position of control at Ruby Ridge or that he exercised a
decisionmaking function.  No evidence was discovered that Howen had
any role in the decision to deploy HRT or in the formulation or
modification of the Rules of Engagement.  Nor was there any
evidence that he was involved in tactical or operational planning
or decisions or in developing or implementing negotiation
strategy.<P>
     Similarly, there is no evidence that Howen acted improperly at
walk-throughs and searches or that he controlled the searches or
selected the investigative methodology.  Indeed, Special Agent
Davis believed that Howen tried not to interfere with the
investigations.  Although Howen may have made a few suggestions as
to materials the investigators should seize, these suggestions were
not orders and appear to have been made to assist the agents
conducting the search.  The advice Howen provided at these searches
appears to have been solicited and was limited to the specific
inquiry made.  Our investigation uncovered no evidence that Howen's
actions impeded investigators at the searches.<P>
     We believe that, in the future, serious consideration should
be given to including a representative from the U.S. Attorney's
Office to law enforcement teams responding to crises like Ruby
Ridge.  The representative could assist law enforcement personnel
in many matters such as participating in resolving the controversy
and providing legal advice about issues arising during the crises.<P>
     We recognize, however, that in many instances the
representative should not be the attorney responsible for
prosecuting the case because this could lead to the charge that the
prosecutor was a witness to the critical events at issue.  With
that caveat, we believe that many of the issues a Ruby Ridge could
have been avoided, if a member of the U.S. Attorney's Office had
been a more active participant in the events.<P>
          <H3>4.   Conclusion</H3><P>
     We believe that questionable decisions by HRT managers
unintentionally contributed to circumstances that required removal
of HRT personnel form the mountain overlooking the Weaver cabin on
August 22 after the two rifle shots were fired.<P>
     The FBI management team favored a tactical strategy and gave
insufficient consideration to negotiations as a means to resolve
the crisis.  Negotiation experts at the site were not adequately
informed and consulted during the crisis.  The failure of onsite
supervisors to communicate accurate information to the FBI's
behavioral sciences personnel appears to have had a negative impact
on attempts to resolve the crisis through negotiation.  the late
decision to use third party non-governmental negotiators was a
sound management decision that displayed flexibility on the part of
FBI management.  Finally, Howen's conduct was proper and consistent
with the roe of a federal prosecutor.  Indeed, it may have been
advisable for a member of the U.S. Attorney's Office to have
participated more actively in some of the events at Ruby Ridge,
thereby possibly avoiding some of the problems that arose.<P><hr><P>

     797 Glenn stated that the discovery of Sammy Weaver's body was
the first evidence that anyone in the cabin had been injured. Glenn
Sworn Statement, January 12, 1994, at 28-29.  This is inconsistent
with HRT reports that Horiuchi's second shot might have hit an
adult male.<P>
     798 Rogers Trial Testimony, June 2, 1993, at 106.  The only
evidence that law enforcement knew that Sammy Weaver had been
struck during the exchange of gunfire of August 21 is the interview
of Marshals Service Director Hudson, who stated that Deputy
Director Twomey informed him that "it was believed that Sammy
[Weaver] had been wounded."  FD-302 Interview of Henry Hudson,
November 15, 1993, at 4.  Twomey reported that he told Hudson there
was no indication Sammy had been shot.  See FD-302 Interview of
John Twomey, November 26, 1993, at 3.  None of the FBI personnel at
Ruby Ridge appears to have known that Sammy Weaver had been wounded
or killed during the fire fight on August 21.
   
     Initial reports of the location of the wounds on Sammy
Weaver's body were incorrect.  For example, the Marshals Service
Crisis center Log contains an entry on Sunday night that gunshot
wounds were discovered on his head and left breast.  An entry, less
than two hours later, corrects the information, explaining that he
had been shot once in the back and once in the arm.  Crisis Center
Log, August 23, 1992, at 11:03 p.m. (EDT) and August 24, 1992, at

change to the FBI standard deadly force policy reported to this
inquiry that they received radio notice of the change from Rogers.
Each observation point was required to acknowledge that it was "on
the air" before Rogers announced the change to the standard FBI
policy and that it had heard and understood the change.  An HRT
member told HRT and SWAT personnel who began the next shift that
the standard deadly force policy was in effect.  Each briefing
subsequent to the announcement included a reminder that the
standard policy on deadly force was in effect.<P>
     809 [G.J.]<P>
     810 Gritz was asked during this inquiry whether, at any point
leading up to Harris' surrender, he had detected odors associated
with a dead body.  Gritz said that he had not detected such odors
and explained that he was very familiar with the odor of death, due
to extensive service in Viet Nam.  Gritz retired from the Special
Forces at the rank of Lieutenant Colonel in 1979.<P>
     Soon after Harris' surrender, Gritz persuaded Weaver to allow
him and Jackie Brown to come inside the residence and remove Vicki
Weaver's body.  He obtained a body bag and, with Randy Weaver's
assistance, placed Vicki Weaver's body in the bag.  Gritz detected
only minimal odor and was unable to explain why the very
recognizable odor usually associated with a several-day-old corpse
had not permeated the residence.  When Gritz placed the body in the
bag, he removed what he described as a holstered nine millimeter
semi-automatic pistol.<P>
     811 [G.J.]<P>
     812 It was rumored among law enforcement personnel that, after
the second shot, a body, possibly Harris', could be seen on the
front or back porch of the cabin.  FD-302 Interview of Luke Joseph
Adler, January 7, 1994, at 2-3.  One marshal was told that there
was something wrapped on the back porch "that could be possibly a
body."  Sworn Statement of Mark Jurgensen, February 7, 1994, at
16-17.  None of the HRT personnel in mountainside observation
positions reported seeing Harris' body or any other.  The Crisis
Center Log reported that the rumor was "completely false and
unfounded."  Crisis Center Log, August 25, 1992, at 2:51 p.m.

<H3>IV. SPECIFIC ISSUES INVESTIGATED</H3><p>
<H3>J.   The FBI Laboratory</H3><p>
<H3>1.   Introduction</H3><p>
     The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Idaho ("USAO"),
components of the FBI, the U.S. Marshals Service, local law
enforcement agencies, and the trial court all criticized the
performance of the FBI Laboratory ("Laboratory") during the course
of the Weaver trial.  In this section, we will examine the
timeliness and quality of the Laboratory's response to requests for
tests, its refusal to perform certain tests, and its neglect to do
others.<p>
     <H3>2.   Statement of Facts</H3><p>
     <H4>a.   FBI Laboratory Processing Procedure</H4><p>
     Special Agents Gregory Rampton and Joseph Venkus, the FBI case
agents for the Weaver/Harris prosecution, coordinated the
submission of evidence to the FBI Laboratory for examination.  They
were responsible for disseminating the results of the examinations
to the U.S. Attorney's Office in Boise.  Assistant U.S. Attorney
Lindquist was primarily responsible for Laboratory related issues
for the prosecution.<p>
     It is FBI policy that when the Laboratory receives a request
from a field office to examine evidence, a principal examiner is
assigned to the matter.  The examiner assigns a priority to the
request.  Cases for which the FBI is primarily responsible are
given the highest priority, followed by cases involving violent
crimes, cases involving crimes against property, and cases in 
which a judicial proceeding is unlikely.  In practice, we found that
pendency of a trial date is the overriding factor determining
whether a case becomes a priority.<p>
     The principal examiner forwards items of evidence to the
appropriate unit within the Laboratory, prepares a report when the
examination has been completed, and returns the items to the field
office with the report.<p>
     The principal examiner in the weaver matter was Supervisory
Special Agent James Cadigan of the Firearms/Toolmarks Unit. 
Cadigan directed the requests for examinations from the field to
various Laboratory components; formalized the final reports; and
oversaw the return of evidence.  One hundred and ninety nine pieces
of evidence were submitted to the Laboratory for 350 examinations. 
Cadigan conveyed the results of the examinations to Venkus or
Rampton by telephone, who would send a written report by facsimile
to the USAO.  When the agents received the final, written
Laboratory reports, they would also send them to the USAO.  The
Laboratory generated twelve reports in the Weaver matter.<p>
          <H4>b.   Timeliness and Neglected Tests</H4><p>
     On January 8, 1993, a conference was held in the chambers of
U.S. District Court Judge Lodge.  The defense requested that the
trial date of February 2, 1993 be postponed because of the volume
of information and documents to be reviewed and because not all of
the Laboratory examinations had been completed.  Judge Lodge
admonished the government to provide the results of the
examinations quickly.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Howen told the court
that he was attempting to comply with the court's instructions, but
that he had no control over the delay caused by the FBI
Laboratory. [FN975]<p>
     Following Weaver's sentencing, Judge Lodge issued a contempt
order against the FBI and levied a fine because the prosecution had
"receiv[ed] less than full cooperation from the FBI" and the Bureau
had not produced items of evidence "timely." [FN976]  The court referred
to the FBI's "recalcitrance" and held that he Bureau had
"evidence[d] a callous disregard for the rights of the defendants
and the interests of justice and demonstrate[d] a complete lack of
respect for the order and directions of [the] court." [FN977] <p>
     This inquiry had determined that, by January 8, 1993, the date
of the chambers conference, the FBI Laboratory had completed four
reports. [FN978]  After the conference, the Laboratory submitted reports
on January 8, January 13, January 21, January 22, February 25,
March 17, April 12, and April 13.  The 44 items analyzed in those
reports were submitted to the Laboratory between August 28 and
November 27, 1992. [FN979]  The majority of tests outstanding on January
8 were serology tests and hair, fiber, and DNA tests of pieces of
clothing.  The FBI received Vicki and Sammy Weaver's hair and blood
samples on January 5 and 29, 1993.  Deputy Marshal Degan's blood
samples were prematurely returned to the Seattle field office where
they were allowed to spoil.  Most of the test results on the Weaver
blood samples were included in the January Laboratory reports.<p>
     After the chambers conference, the FBI Laboratory received
eight requests for examinations in the Weaver matter, which were
completed according to the following schedule:<p>
Date of Communication - Date of Response<p>
January 11, 1993 - February 25, 1993<p>
January 20, 1993 - March 17, 1993<p>
January 28, 1993 - February 25, 1993<p>
February 11, 1993 - February 25, 1993<p>
March 21, 1993 - April 12, 1993<p>
April 2, 1993 - April 13, 1993<p>
April 9, 1993 - April 13, 1993<p>
May 26, 1993 - June 7, 1993 <p>
[FN980]<p>
     The first examination that appears to have been neglected was
a request on August 27, 1992 to determine whether two pieces of
metal were once part of Degan's canteen clip.  The second neglected
examination was a request on September 9 to compare blood samples
of Vicki and Sammy Weaver with blood found on tow jackets and a
pair of pants. [FN981]  The third was a request on
October 28 to determine whether holes in Degan's backpack and the
clothing it contained had been caused by a bullet. [FN982]<p>
     There was no response to these requests in the Laboratory
report of December 23, 1992.  The field office again requested
these examinations on January 5, 1993.  The Laboratory responded on
January 22.  A more detailed discussion of these tests follows. <p>
(1)  Degan's Backpack<p>
     Cadigan told our inquiry that he does not know why the
examination of the backpack and its contents was overlooked.  The
report on the backpack notes that an "exit" hole in the backpack
and holes in the clothing inside had a "linear relationship" and
could have been caused by a bullet or bullet fragments.  The report
states that no other determinations or conclusions could be
made. [FN983]<p>
     During the trial, a defense attorney found another hole in a
fold of the backpack. [FN984]  We asked Cadigan whether he had attempted
to locate all entrance and exit holes in Degan's backpack.  He
replied that he had examined the backpack closely and did not
discover any damage, other than that noted in his reports. [FN985]<p>
(2)  Blood and Hair Examinations<p>
     After being retrieved from Ruby Ridge, Deputy Marshal Degan's
body was taken to a morgue for an autopsy, which was performed on
August 22, 1992 by Dr. George Lindholm.  FBI Special Agent John
attended the autopsy, along with representatives of the U.S.
Marshals Service, the Boundary County Sheriff's Office, and the
Boundary County Coroner's Office.  A photographic record and log of
the autopsy was kept, and John retained several items of evidence,
including hair samples and two tubes of blood, which were sent to
the Laboratory on August 14 for "whatever analysis you deem
appropriate."<p>
     The Laboratory received the evidence on August 25, 1992. 
Within two days, Cadigan performed the obvious tests on the bullet
fragments which had been removed from Degan's body and provided the
preliminary results to SIOC for transmission to the crisis site. 
Cadigan sent the final results to the Seattle field office which
had sent the material.  Because no specific requests had been made
as to the blood and hair samples, Cadigan asked the field office to
specify the tests that should be conducted.  The field office was
unsure about the tests needed and explained that the material had
been sent just to "cover all the bases." [FN986]<p>
     In September, 1992, the Laboratory received Harris and Randy
Weaver's blood samples.  Because the Laboratory had "insufficient
space to maintain items of evidence," they were returned to the
field office. [FN987]  The items were placed in a bulky exhibit, 
and the blood spoiled because it was not refrigerated.<p>
     The FBI Hostage Rescue Team discovered Sammy Weaver's body,
while clearing the birthing shed near the Weaver cabin on August
23, 1992.  Dr. Lindholm conducted an autopsy on August 25.  Special
Agent John attended, along with representatives of the Boundary
County Sheriff and Coroner's Offices.  At the time, the
circumstances surrounding Sammy Weaver's death were unknown, and
the Sheriff's Office was proceeding on the assumption that the
death was a homicide.  Consequently, the office took samples of all
the evidence from the autopsy, including blood and hair samples,
for the Idaho State Crime Laboratory. [FN988]<p>
     On August 31, 1992, Dr. Lindholm conducted an autopsy of Vicki
Weaver's body, attended by John and representatives of the U.S.
Marshals Service, the Boundary County Sheriff's Office, and the
Boundary County Coroner.  The FBI retained several items, including
hair samples, as evidence, but there is no indication that a blood
sample was retained. [FN989]  On September 3, the evidence was sent to
the FBI Laboratory. [FN990]<p>
     Dr. Lindholm's autopsy reports for Degan and Sammy and Vicki
Weaver show that body fluids and tissue, including purge fluid and
blood and hair samples, were taken during each autopsy.  As
standard procedure, Dr. Lindholm provided blood and hair samples to
the investigating agency. [FN991]<p>
     On September 3, 1992, the FBI Laboratory was asked to examine
certain clothing to see whether blood and hair could be identified
as that of Randy Weaver, Kevin Harris, Vicki Weaver, or Sammy
Weaver. [FN992]  Cadigan submitted the clothing for hair and fiber
tests.  These tests were completed on October 2.<p>
     When Rampton reviewed the December 23, 1992 Laboratory report,
he discovered that blood and hair examinations had not been
performed.  The Laboratory told him that blood samples for Degan,
Vicki Weaver, and Sammy Weaver and Harris' hair sample had not been
sent to the Laboratory. [FN993]<p>
     On January 4, 1993, blood samples taken from Degan, Sammy
Weaver and Vicki Weaver were obtained from Dr. Lindholm and sent to
the Laboratory. [FN994]  The examinations were completed and reported on
January 21.  On January 28, pursuant to a court order, samples of
Harris' hair were taken and forwarded to the FBI Laboratory.<p>
     When the FBI Laboratory received a request for additional
blood and hair comparisons on January 5, 1993, Cadigan realized
that the FBI did not have the blood samples.  The samples were
submitted on January 6. [FN995]  The examinations were completed and
provided to the USAO on January 15 and given to the defense on
January 27.<p>
<H4>c.   Refusal to Perform Tests and Hiring of
Independent Experts</H4><p>
     In one instance, the Laboratory refused to conduct a requested
examination and, in several instance, the Laboratory determined
that certain examinations were not possible.<p>
     During trial preparation, the USAO entered into contracts with
three forensic specialists: Lucien Haag, a "shooting
reconstructionist," Richard Graham a metal detection expert, and
Dr. Marin Fackler, a wound ballistician.  According to the
prosecutors, these people were retained because the FBI Laboratory
was unwilling or unable to provide assistance in their areas of
expertise. [FN996]<p>
(1)  Refusal to Conduct Test<p>
     On March 21, 1993, the Laboratory was asked to determine the
caliber of the bullet which passed through Sammy Weaver's jacket
causing the fatal wound.  The Laboratory may, at the examiner's
discretion, refuse to conduct an examination if the examination and
result have no basis in scientific theory, thereby precluding the
examiner from testifying as to the result.  Cadigan has asserted
that no test recognized by forensic science enables an examiner to
determine with any certainty the caliber of the bullet which caused
a hole in clothing because there are too many variables and the
exact anatomical position of the victim cannot be determined.  For
this reason, Cadigan refused to conduct the examination.  When the
Laboratory received another request to determine the caliber of
the bullet that had struck Sammy Weaver, the Laboratory did conduct
tests, but could not "definitely state exactly what caliber bullet
went through the coat." [FN997]<p>
(2)  Shooting Reconstruction<p>
     Early in the trial preparation, Lindquist told the FBI case
agents that the case needed an expert to reconstruct the shooting
events at the Y on August 21 to corroborate the marshals'
testimony.  The agents replied that "there's no such thing."
Lindquist explained that a shooting reconstructionist, on the basis
of the physical evidence, can determine, among other things, the
"directionality" of a bullet's trajectory. [FN995]<p>
     After some discussion, case agent Venkus called the FBI
Laboratory and was told that the Laboratory does not do shooting
reconstructions.  With a sense of exasperation, Lindquist asked one
of the deputy marshals assigned to the case to find one of the best
shooting reconstructionists in the country and, within 24 hours, he
was given Lucien Haag's name.  When they spoke, Haag asked
Lindquist why he was not using the FBI Laboratory because Haag had
worked previously with someone in the Laboratory on a
reconstruction.<p>
     Confused by the conflicting information he had received,
Lindquist called Cadigan and was told that the Laboratory did do
shooting reconstruction and that he was the FBI's expert in the
area.  Cadigan asked why a private expert was needed.  Lindquist
told Cadigan that he would continue with the private expert, though
he would appreciate the FBI's cooperation.  Lindquist accepted
Cadigan's request to accompany the prosecutors when they visited
the crime scene in March 1993. [FN999]<p>
     According to Lindquist, Cadigan seemed enthusiastic about
participating in the case.  Lindquist found Cadigan very helpful
from that point forward, although he appeared far less
knowledgeable than the private expert. [FN1000] <p>
     Rampton recalled Lindquist's request for a shooting
reconstructionist and telling Lindquist that the Laboratory did not
have shooting reconstruction as a single discipline.  Rampton told
Lindquist that he would check with the Laboratory.  He spoke with
Cadigan, who confirmed that the Laboratory did not have shooting
reconstruction as a single discipline.  Rampton claims he informed
Lindquist of this and heard nothing more until Haag had been
retained. [FN1001]<p>
     Cadigan recalls a phone call from a case agent about whether
the FBI had a shooting reconstructionist.  Cadigan told the agent
that no single person could testify about every aspect of the
reconstruction.  Cadigan confirmed this within the Laboratory and
informed the case agent that a shooting was usually reconstructed
within a confined space such as a building so that impact points
could be located and angles established.  Although the shooting at
the Y would be more difficult to reconstruct, Cadigan said that the
Laboratory would do what it could and that the agent should advise
the Laboratory if the prosecution wanted a reconstruction.  Cadigan
heard nothing more on the matter. [FN1002]<p>
     Lindquist does not recall Cadigan's explaining that the FBI
Laboratory has a multi-disciplinary approach to shooting
reconstruction or that no one person would be able to testify about
the many examinations. [FN1003]<p>
(3)  Wound Ballistics and Metal Detection<p>
     During this inquiry, we found no requests by the USAO for FBI
experts in metal detection or wound ballistics.  Metal detection
experts are available within the FBI's Information Services
Division.  Although the FBI Laboratory does not have a wound
ballistics expert, it consults with experts at the Armed Forces
Institute of Pathology, and this expertise would have been
available on request.<p>
(4)  Acoustic Testing<p>
     Initially the prosecution believed that evidence of the
acoustics of the shooting scene on August 21, 1992 would be
valuable.  The prosecutors were referred to an FBI acoustics expert
to evaluate this aspect of the case.  Lindquist was disappointed
with the FBI's expertise in the field. [FN1004]  The
prosecution did attempt an acoustics test in the area of the Weaver
cabin with the assistance of two marshal and ultimately concluded
that such a test would not be productive.<p>
<H4>d.   Failure to Comply with Discovery</H4><p>
     The final issue raised by Judge Lodge about the FBI Laboratory
concerns the mailing of notes and test firings of the weapons.  The
defense orally requested production of Cadigan's notes and the test
firings at the end of the first week or the beginning of the second
week in May 1992.<p>
     Cadigan recalled receiving a call, possibly on Monday, May 10,
1993, from Venkus advising him that the court intended to order
production of his notes and the test firings.  Cadigan received
"the distinct direction" from Venkus to wait until a court order
had been issued before sending test samples and notes. [FN1005]  He
sought advice on the matter from the FBI's Legal Counsel Division,
which suggested to the USAO reasons why the notes and the test
firings should not be given to the defense. [FN1006]<p>
     On Thursday, May 13, Cadigan received an angry call from
Special Agent Dillon asking where the test firings were.  Cadigan
explained that he was waiting for a court order.  Dillon told
Cadigan to send the notes and test firings to Boise immediately. 
Because Cadigan did not wish to "cause the Agents a problem," he
facsimiled his notes to Boise.  The facsimile was poor, and Cadigan
express-mailed the notes and test firings to Boise, securing the
envelope flaps with tape before placing them into a box for
shipment.<p>
     The following day, Friday, Cadigan was informed that three of
the envelopes had opened during shipment and that the contents had
spilled out and had become commingled.  He instructed the caller to
express-mail the test firings to the Laboratory where he could
rectify the problem by examining microscopic markings.  The test
firings arrived on May 17, 1993.  Cadigan immediately placed them
in the appropriate envelopes and sent the test firings. by
express-mail to Boise. [FN1007]  The prosecution advised the Court 
that the test firings available for defense review on May 18.  
According to Dillon, this delayed the trial and
produced additional discovery problems.<p>
<H3>3.   Discussion</H3><p>
     In analyzing the performance of the FBI Laboratory, we
interviewed field and Laboratory personnel; analyzed field
communications requesting examinations and transmitting physical
evidence; audited Laboratory reports and tracking of examined
articles; assessed criticisms by agencies and interested parties;
inspected the crime scenes; and reviewed grand jury testimony,
court proceedings, and autopsy reports.<p>
<H4>a.   Problems with Delays in Test Results</H4><p>
     Our investigation revealed that Judge Lodge, as well as the
trial team, the FBI field agents, and their supervisors were not
satisfied with the response of the FBI Laboratory in this case. 
[FN1008] In exploring the delays in conducting and reporting 
examinations, we discovered a lack of coordination, communication, 
and cooperation within the FBI.  Unfortunately, these delays had
significant impact on the government's discovery obligations and
the way the government was perceived by the court and at trial.<p>
     Perhaps every prosecution team thinks that its case is most
important and that the Laboratory should respond accordingly.  In
this case, we agree with the prosecutors that the Weaver
prosecution was a most important case that should have been placed
on an expedited and coordinated tracking system.<p>
     We question the wisdom of the FBI Laboratory's practice of
using the trial date as the primary triggering criterion for
Laboratory results.  It is beyond dispute that a trial team needs
test results well before the trial and, ideally, before they  must
be turned over to the defense. [FN1009]<p>
     We also question the practice of accumulating test results in
a single report.  Reporting test results as they are determined
would enable problems to be detected and resolved earlier.  The
procedure would also permit additional tests to be requested and
completed in a ore timely fashion.  Our inquiry found that written
notifications to the field beyond these collective reports were
also late or non-existent.  Although or inspectors were told that
telephonic notifications were made on a regular basis, no
documentation could be located.  Consequently, we can make no
specific determination of the number, date, or contents of
telephonic notifications.  The prosecutors said they received no
Laboratory test results until the latter part of November or the
first part of December about evidence they began to collect in
August. [FN1010]<p>
     We find it unreasonable that tests requested in August and
September were completed in December.  We find the practice of
sending samples back to the field because "specific instructions"
are not contained in the request unreasonable and indicative of
poor communication and coordination. [FN1011]<p>
     When Laboratory tests require additional evidence or specific
instructions, communication with the most knowledgeable people, the
case agents or the prosecutors, should be continuous.  The delay
caused by the lack of blood samples could have been prevented by
coordination and effort.  When Degan's blood samples were shipped
with requests that were not "specific" enough for the Laboratory,
it should have contacted the case agents to get specific advice.
Instead, the Laboratory sent the blood to the transmitting office
where it was allowed to spoil.  Cadigan noted that the case agents
did not "key on" the return of samples. [FN1012]  We do not believe
the responsibility for this delay lies wit the agents alone.  The
December discovery that the blood of Vicki Weaver and Sammy Weaver
and Kevin Harris' hair samples had not been transmitted to the 
FBI Laboratory for tests requested in early September in another 
example of a lack of coordination.<p>
     Cadigan believed that the Laboratory received requests for
examinations that fit the prosecutors' "theory of the week" and
that the resulting tension between the prosecutors and the case
agents adversely affected the coordination necessary between the
field and the Laboratory for timely and effective processing of
evidence. [FN1013]<p>
     One of the reasons the case agents give for the continued
delays after Judge Lodge's Order was the burden placed on the
Laboratory by unnecessary and unreasonable requests by the USAO. 
According to Rampton, the sole purpose of some requests was to avid
the defense focusing on Degan's weapon, upon which the Laboratory
had already completed and ejection pattern test.  However,
Lindquist told us that test firings of all weapons were necessary
to locate where Degan and the others, including Harris and Sammy
Weave, were during the shooting at the Y.  Although he conceded
that the test of Degan's weapon was more critical, Lindquist wanted
to have all the weapons tested to show the jury that the government
was not being selective in its testing.  We find this explanation
reasonable.<p>
     We are not convinced that the delays were the result of
unnecessary requests by the prosecution team.  Rather, we find a
lack of initiative by the Laboratory in conducting examinations
beyond the specific request.  The use of private  experts
apparently renewed the Laboratory's interest in an commitment to
the case.  That was a costly and unnecessary expense.  Our inquiry
found that nothing done by the independent examiners fell outside
the FBI's expertise.<p>
     In addition we find that the Laboratory's failure to respond
in a timely manner contributed to the trial judge's perception that
the government was not meeting its discovery obligations.  Although
the FBI Laboratory did much significant and professional work, the
problems apparent in delays and lack of initiative should be
remedied.  If the primary cause for delays and failure to
coordinate is the result of strained resources, priorities should 
be reevaluated.  If the response in this matter is typical of high
profile homicide cases involving the death of a federal law
enforcement officer and two citizens, we wonder about the response
to matters of less importance.<p>
<H4>b.   Failure to Provide Expertise and the Hiring of
Independent Experts</H4><p>
     Our investigation revealed a lack of cooperation and
initiative by the Laboratory beyond specific tests requested.  We
found that the requisite expertise was present at the Laboratory,
but it was something that the USAO had to discover.  We share the
prosecutors' disappointment in the Laboratory's lack of initiative
or involvement in the case.  We can empathize with the prosecutors
who wanted to use the FBI for experts and receive the benefit of
the Laboratory's suggestions in developing the prosecution theory. 
Although we cannot address the soundness of the examinations the
private experts and prosecutors requested, many of the problems and
the perception of incompetence could have been avoided by direct
conversation between the prosecutors and the Laboratory.<p>
     Cadigan was aware that the idea for some tests, including the
attempt to recreate the hole in Sammy Weaver's jacket, had
originated with the private expert, and the case agents were
frustrated that  the prosecutors were going outside "normal
investigative channels" by hiring experts to conduct "alternative
examinations" that would not be done by the Laboratory. [FN1014] 
Cadigan believes that one of the main differences between the FBI
Laboratory and private examiners is that the FBI Laboratory is
"extremely conservative" and that FBI examiners will not testify to
results not based on scientific fact because the Laboratory must
maintain its reputation of being able to withstand cross
examination.  He believes that this distinguished FBI scientists
from the majority of experts retained by defense counsel, whose
primary purpose is to propose alternate theories to those advanced
by the prosecution.<p>
     If the government's cases are to be presented successfully and
fairly in the courtroom, the technical expertise of the FBI
Laboratory must be available to assist trial teams beyond areas
about which Laboratory experts can testify.  For example, test
firings of the weapons at the Y during the August 21 shooting were
significant for planning the prosecution's theory and establishing
trial strategy.  The prosecutors and the rest of the trial team
needed timely assistance from experts in interpreting evidence. 
Developing alternate theories of how events occurred is part of the
investigative and trial preparation process.  The scope of
information that a prosecutor must develop should not be limited
during trial preparation only to admissible tests and  evidence.<p>
     An example of a test conducted by the independent examiner
that the prosecution found helpful was an identification by
elimination.  The independent examiner did an analysis of
cartridges found at the Y with weapons known to have been on the
scene to exclude those that could not have been responsible for the
cartridges.  The FBI Laboratory expert viewed this form of
identification as unscientific in that other unknown weapons may
have been at the site.  Nevertheless, the elimination of some
weapons would assist the prosecutor in making decisions.  It would
also help at trial to know which weapons are capable of making a
bullet hole associated with the fatal wound.<p>
     We believe a more coordinated, professional, creative, and
cooperative approach to litigation and investigations would be far
more helpful than the process we discovered in the Weaver matter.<p>
<H4>c.   Discovery Demand for Test Firings</H4> and Laboratory Notes<p>
     Our investigation found that the delay in turning over
Laboratory notes and test firings was one of several examples of
the FBI resistance to, disagreement with, and misunderstanding of
its discovery obligations in the Weaver case.  We found the FBI's
actions and decisions inappropriate.  A court should not be
compelled to order discovery compliance to resolve disputes between
components of the government.  Understandably, the delays caused by
this attitude evoked a negative response from the court and
counsel.<p>
     We found no evidence that the delays in the Laboratory tests
were designed or intended to postpone the trial or obstruct
justice.  The decision to wait for an order was in conflict with
the "open discovery" strategy of the USAO and the government's
representations of cooperation in court.  Objections to discovery
should have been addressed to the court through the USAO.  The
accidental commingling of the materials sent to Idaho and the
events that followed contributed to the court's perception that the
FBI had no regard for the rights of the accused and for the
administration of justice.<p>
<H3>4.   Conclusion</H3><p>
     The lack of coordination and communication both within the FBI
and with the USAO appears to be the major cause of the delays and
the other problems examined in this section of the report.<p><hr><p>

     979 Items were also submitted on January 5, 1992.<p>
     980 On January 20, 1993, Lindquist sent Cooper and Roderick's
weapons to the Laboratory and, on February 11, he sent Harris and
Sammy Weaver's weapons for ejection pattern tests.  The results of
the test on Degan's weapon were reported on January 22.<p>
     On January 28, the Laboratory reported that the examinations
requested on January 20 would take ten weeks to complete.  They
were actually completed on March 17.  On February 9, the Laboratory
reported that the examinations requested on January 28 would take
ten weeks to complete.  They were completed on February 25.  On
March 31, the Laboratory reported that the examinations requested
on March 21 would take ten weeks to complete.  They were completed
on April 12.  In our opinion, these inaccurate estimates show a
lack of organization and probably made the prosecution less willing
to request additional testing.<p>

     984 The defense asserted that the two holes would be evidence
that Degan received a shot to his back, spun around, and received
a fatal shot from Cooper.  This theory ignores the identification
of Harris' bullet as the fatal shot to Degan's chest.<p>

     990 The only evidence from the autopsy that was not sent to
the FBI Laboratory were the fingerprint digits, which were examined
by the local police department.<p>
     991 Dr. Lindholm told this inquiry that he was disappointed
that the agents attending these autopsies were not knowledgeable
about events surrounding the injuries.  FD-302 Interview of Dr.
George Lindholm, October 7, 1993, at 2.<p>
     992 Blood and hair samples were taken from Randy Weaver after
he surrendered and were forwarded to the FBI Laboratory on
September 1, 1992.  Cadigan FD-302, August 17, 1993, at 25.  There
is no record of the Laboratory receiving blood samples of the
Weaver group, other than Randy Weaver's.  An FBI interview report
erroneously stated that a sample of Harris's hair had been taken.
After his surrender, Harris was taken to a hospital for treatment.
According to a report prepared by FBI Special Agent James T. Davis,
dated August 30, 1992, Davis took a blood sample from Harris at the
hospital and Special Agent John took hair samples.  The blood
sample was forwarded to the FBI Laboratory on September 1, 1992. 
We understand that John did not obtain hair samples.<p>

important, FBI transmittal forms do not have a place for the date. 
The first record we found of a trial date was in a transmittal to
the Engineering Section of the FBI Laboratory dated October 27,

Cadigan FD-302, August 17, 1993, at 58.  Since the transmittal was
sent to the Engineering Section in Quantico, Virginia, Cadigan
never saw the transmittal.  In fact, Cadigan<p>
     1009 (...continued)
did not know the trial date until November or December.  We find
the principal examiner's ignorance of the data symptomatic of the
poor coordination and communication in this case.  We note that the

of the trial date because they referred to the date in their many
conversations with him.<p>

<H3>IV. SPECIFIC ISSUES INVESTIGATED</H3><p>
<H3>J.   The FBI Laboratory</H3><p>
<H3>1.   Introduction</H3><p>
     The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Idaho ("USAO"),
components of the FBI, the U.S. Marshals Service, local law
enforcement agencies, and the trial court all criticized the
performance of the FBI Laboratory ("Laboratory") during the course
of the Weaver trial.  In this section, we will examine the
timeliness and quality of the Laboratory's response to requests for
tests, its refusal to perform certain tests, and its neglect to do
others.<p>
     <H3>2.   Statement of Facts</H3><p>
     <H4>a.   FBI Laboratory Processing Procedure</H4><p>
     Special Agents Gregory Rampton and Joseph Venkus, the FBI case
agents for the Weaver/Harris prosecution, coordinated the
submission of evidence to the FBI Laboratory for examination.  They
were responsible for disseminating the results of the examinations
to the U.S. Attorney's Office in Boise.  Assistant U.S. Attorney
Lindquist was primarily responsible for Laboratory related issues
for the prosecution.<p>
     It is FBI policy that when the Laboratory receives a request
from a field office to examine evidence, a principal examiner is
assigned to the matter.  The examiner assigns a priority to the
request.  Cases for which the FBI is primarily responsible are
given the highest priority, followed by cases involving violent
crimes, cases involving crimes against property, and cases in 
which a judicial proceeding is unlikely.  In practice, we found that
pendency of a trial date is the overriding factor determining
whether a case becomes a priority.<p>
     The principal examiner forwards items of evidence to the
appropriate unit within the Laboratory, prepares a report when the
examination has been completed, and returns the items to the field
office with the report.<p>
     The principal examiner in the weaver matter was Supervisory
Special Agent James Cadigan of the Firearms/Toolmarks Unit. 
Cadigan directed the requests for examinations from the field to
various Laboratory components; formalized the final reports; and
oversaw the return of evidence.  One hundred and ninety nine pieces
of evidence were submitted to the Laboratory for 350 examinations. 
Cadigan conveyed the results of the examinations to Venkus or
Rampton by telephone, who would send a written report by facsimile
to the USAO.  When the agents received the final, written
Laboratory reports, they would also send them to the USAO.  The
Laboratory generated twelve reports in the Weaver matter.<p>
          <H4>b.   Timeliness and Neglected Tests</H4><p>
     On January 8, 1993, a conference was held in the chambers of
U.S. District Court Judge Lodge.  The defense requested that the
trial date of February 2, 1993 be postponed because of the volume
of information and documents to be reviewed and because not all of
the Laboratory examinations had been completed.  Judge Lodge
admonished the government to provide the results of the
examinations quickly.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Howen told the court
that he was attempting to comply with the court's instructions, but
that he had no control over the delay caused by the FBI
Laboratory. [FN975]<p>
     Following Weaver's sentencing, Judge Lodge issued a contempt
order against the FBI and levied a fine because the prosecution had
"receiv[ed] less than full cooperation from the FBI" and the Bureau
had not produced items of evidence "timely." [FN976]  The court referred
to the FBI's "recalcitrance" and held that he Bureau had
"evidence[d] a callous disregard for the rights of the defendants
and the interests of justice and demonstrate[d] a complete lack of
respect for the order and directions of [the] court." [FN977] <p>
     This inquiry had determined that, by January 8, 1993, the date
of the chambers conference, the FBI Laboratory had completed four
reports. [FN978]  After the conference, the Laboratory submitted reports
on January 8, January 13, January 21, January 22, February 25,
March 17, April 12, and April 13.  The 44 items analyzed in those
reports were submitted to the Laboratory between August 28 and
November 27, 1992. [FN979]  The majority of tests outstanding on January
8 were serology tests and hair, fiber, and DNA tests of pieces of
clothing.  The FBI received Vicki and Sammy Weaver's hair and blood
samples on January 5 and 29, 1993.  Deputy Marshal Degan's blood
samples were prematurely returned to the Seattle field office where
they were allowed to spoil.  Most of the test results on the Weaver
blood samples were included in the January Laboratory reports.<p>
     After the chambers conference, the FBI Laboratory received
eight requests for examinations in the Weaver matter, which were
completed according to the following schedule:<p>
Date of Communication - Date of Response<p>
January 11, 1993 - February 25, 1993<p>
January 20, 1993 - March 17, 1993<p>
January 28, 1993 - February 25, 1993<p>
February 11, 1993 - February 25, 1993<p>
March 21, 1993 - April 12, 1993<p>
April 2, 1993 - April 13, 1993<p>
April 9, 1993 - April 13, 1993<p>
May 26, 1993 - June 7, 1993 <p>
[FN980]<p>
     The first examination that appears to have been neglected was
a request on August 27, 1992 to determine whether two pieces of
metal were once part of Degan's canteen clip.  The second neglected
examination was a request on September 9 to compare blood samples
of Vicki and Sammy Weaver with blood found on tow jackets and a
pair of pants. [FN981]  The third was a request on
October 28 to determine whether holes in Degan's backpack and the
clothing it contained had been caused by a bullet. [FN982]<p>
     There was no response to these requests in the Laboratory
report of December 23, 1992.  The field office again requested
these examinations on January 5, 1993.  The Laboratory responded on
January 22.  A more detailed discussion of these tests follows. <p>
(1)  Degan's Backpack<p>
     Cadigan told our inquiry that he does not know why the
examination of the backpack and its contents was overlooked.  The
report on the backpack notes that an "exit" hole in the backpack
and holes in the clothing inside had a "linear relationship" and
could have been caused by a bullet or bullet fragments.  The report
states that no other determinations or conclusions could be
made. [FN983]<p>
     During the trial, a defense attorney found another hole in a
fold of the backpack. [FN984]  We asked Cadigan whether he had attempted
to locate all entrance and exit holes in Degan's backpack.  He
replied that he had examined the backpack closely and did not
discover any damage, other than that noted in his reports. [FN985]<p>
(2)  Blood and Hair Examinations<p>
     After being retrieved from Ruby Ridge, Deputy Marshal Degan's
body was taken to a morgue for an autopsy, which was performed on
August 22, 1992 by Dr. George Lindholm.  FBI Special Agent John
attended the autopsy, along with representatives of the U.S.
Marshals Service, the Boundary County Sheriff's Office, and the
Boundary County Coroner's Office.  A photographic record and log of
the autopsy was kept, and John retained several items of evidence,
including hair samples and two tubes of blood, which were sent to
the Laboratory on August 14 for "whatever analysis you deem
appropriate."<p>
     The Laboratory received the evidence on August 25, 1992. 
Within two days, Cadigan performed the obvious tests on the bullet
fragments which had been removed from Degan's body and provided the
preliminary results to SIOC for transmission to the crisis site. 
Cadigan sent the final results to the Seattle field office which
had sent the material.  Because no specific requests had been made
as to the blood and hair samples, Cadigan asked the field office to
specify the tests that should be conducted.  The field office was
unsure about the tests needed and explained that the material had
been sent just to "cover all the bases." [FN986]<p>
     In September, 1992, the Laboratory received Harris and Randy
Weaver's blood samples.  Because the Laboratory had "insufficient
space to maintain items of evidence," they were returned to the
field office. [FN987]  The items were placed in a bulky exhibit, 
and the blood spoiled because it was not refrigerated.<p>
     The FBI Hostage Rescue Team discovered Sammy Weaver's body,
while clearing the birthing shed near the Weaver cabin on August
23, 1992.  Dr. Lindholm conducted an autopsy on August 25.  Special
Agent John attended, along with representatives of the Boundary
County Sheriff and Coroner's Offices.  At the time, the
circumstances surrounding Sammy Weaver's death were unknown, and
the Sheriff's Office was proceeding on the assumption that the
death was a homicide.  Consequently, the office took samples of all
the evidence from the autopsy, including blood and hair samples,
for the Idaho State Crime Laboratory. [FN988]<p>
     On August 31, 1992, Dr. Lindholm conducted an autopsy of Vicki
Weaver's body, attended by John and representatives of the U.S.
Marshals Service, the Boundary County Sheriff's Office, and the
Boundary County Coroner.  The FBI retained several items, including
hair samples, as evidence, but there is no indication that a blood
sample was retained. [FN989]  On September 3, the evidence was sent to
the FBI Laboratory. [FN990]<p>
     Dr. Lindholm's autopsy reports for Degan and Sammy and Vicki
Weaver show that body fluids and tissue, including purge fluid and
blood and hair samples, were taken during each autopsy.  As
standard procedure, Dr. Lindholm provided blood and hair samples to
the investigating agency. [FN991]<p>
     On September 3, 1992, the FBI Laboratory was asked to examine
certain clothing to see whether blood and hair could be identified
as that of Randy Weaver, Kevin Harris, Vicki Weaver, or Sammy
Weaver. [FN992]  Cadigan submitted the clothing for hair and fiber
tests.  These tests were completed on October 2.<p>
     When Rampton reviewed the December 23, 1992 Laboratory report,
he discovered that blood and hair examinations had not been
performed.  The Laboratory told him that blood samples for Degan,
Vicki Weaver, and Sammy Weaver and Harris' hair sample had not been
sent to the Laboratory. [FN993]<p>
     On January 4, 1993, blood samples taken from Degan, Sammy
Weaver and Vicki Weaver were obtained from Dr. Lindholm and sent to
the Laboratory. [FN994]  The examinations were completed and reported on
January 21.  On January 28, pursuant to a court order, samples of
Harris' hair were taken and forwarded to the FBI Laboratory.<p>
     When the FBI Laboratory received a request for additional
blood and hair comparisons on January 5, 1993, Cadigan realized
that the FBI did not have the blood samples.  The samples were
submitted on January 6. [FN995]  The examinations were completed and
provided to the USAO on January 15 and given to the defense on
January 27.<p>
<H4>c.   Refusal to Perform Tests and Hiring of
Independent Experts</H4><p>
     In one instance, the Laboratory refused to conduct a requested
examination and, in several instance, the Laboratory determined
that certain examinations were not possible.<p>
     During trial preparation, the USAO entered into contracts with
three forensic specialists: Lucien Haag, a "shooting
reconstructionist," Richard Graham a metal detection expert, and
Dr. Marin Fackler, a wound ballistician.  According to the
prosecutors, these people were retained because the FBI Laboratory
was unwilling or unable to provide assistance in their areas of
expertise. [FN996]<p>
(1)  Refusal to Conduct Test<p>
     On March 21, 1993, the Laboratory was asked to determine the
caliber of the bullet which passed through Sammy Weaver's jacket
causing the fatal wound.  The Laboratory may, at the examiner's
discretion, refuse to conduct an examination if the examination and
result have no basis in scientific theory, thereby precluding the
examiner from testifying as to the result.  Cadigan has asserted
that no test recognized by forensic science enables an examiner to
determine with any certainty the caliber of the bullet which caused
a hole in clothing because there are too many variables and the
exact anatomical position of the victim cannot be determined.  For
this reason, Cadigan refused to conduct the examination.  When the
Laboratory received another request to determine the caliber of
the bullet that had struck Sammy Weaver, the Laboratory did conduct
tests, but could not "definitely state exactly what caliber bullet
went through the coat." [FN997]<p>
(2)  Shooting Reconstruction<p>
     Early in the trial preparation, Lindquist told the FBI case
agents that the case needed an expert to reconstruct the shooting
events at the Y on August 21 to corroborate the marshals'
testimony.  The agents replied that "there's no such thing."
Lindquist explained that a shooting reconstructionist, on the basis
of the physical evidence, can determine, among other things, the
"directionality" of a bullet's trajectory. [FN995]<p>
     After some discussion, case agent Venkus called the FBI
Laboratory and was told that the Laboratory does not do shooting
reconstructions.  With a sense of exasperation, Lindquist asked one
of the deputy marshals assigned to the case to find one of the best
shooting reconstructionists in the country and, within 24 hours, he
was given Lucien Haag's name.  When they spoke, Haag asked
Lindquist why he was not using the FBI Laboratory because Haag had
worked previously with someone in the Laboratory on a
reconstruction.<p>
     Confused by the conflicting information he had received,
Lindquist called Cadigan and was told that the Laboratory did do
shooting reconstruction and that he was the FBI's expert in the
area.  Cadigan asked why a private expert was needed.  Lindquist
told Cadigan that he would continue with the private expert, though
he would appreciate the FBI's cooperation.  Lindquist accepted
Cadigan's request to accompany the prosecutors when they visited
the crime scene in March 1993. [FN999]<p>
     According to Lindquist, Cadigan seemed enthusiastic about
participating in the case.  Lindquist found Cadigan very helpful
from that point forward, although he appeared far less
knowledgeable than the private expert. [FN1000] <p>
     Rampton recalled Lindquist's request for a shooting
reconstructionist and telling Lindquist that the Laboratory did not
have shooting reconstruction as a single discipline.  Rampton told
Lindquist that he would check with the Laboratory.  He spoke with
Cadigan, who confirmed that the Laboratory did not have shooting
reconstruction as a single discipline.  Rampton claims he informed
Lindquist of this and heard nothing more until Haag had been
retained. [FN1001]<p>
     Cadigan recalls a phone call from a case agent about whether
the FBI had a shooting reconstructionist.  Cadigan told the agent
that no single person could testify about every aspect of the
reconstruction.  Cadigan confirmed this within the Laboratory and
informed the case agent that a shooting was usually reconstructed
within a confined space such as a building so that impact points
could be located and angles established.  Although the shooting at
the Y would be more difficult to reconstruct, Cadigan said that the
Laboratory would do what it could and that the agent should advise
the Laboratory if the prosecution wanted a reconstruction.  Cadigan
heard nothing more on the matter. [FN1002]<p>
     Lindquist does not recall Cadigan's explaining that the FBI
Laboratory has a multi-disciplinary approach to shooting
reconstruction or that no one person would be able to testify about
the many examinations. [FN1003]<p>
(3)  Wound Ballistics and Metal Detection<p>
     During this inquiry, we found no requests by the USAO for FBI
experts in metal detection or wound ballistics.  Metal detection
experts are available within the FBI's Information Services
Division.  Although the FBI Laboratory does not have a wound
ballistics expert, it consults with experts at the Armed Forces
Institute of Pathology, and this expertise would have been
available on request.<p>
(4)  Acoustic Testing<p>
     Initially the prosecution believed that evidence of the
acoustics of the shooting scene on August 21, 1992 would be
valuable.  The prosecutors were referred to an FBI acoustics expert
to evaluate this aspect of the case.  Lindquist was disappointed
with the FBI's expertise in the field. [FN1004]  The
prosecution did attempt an acoustics test in the area of the Weaver
cabin with the assistance of two marshal and ultimately concluded
that such a test would not be productive.<p>
<H4>d.   Failure to Comply with Discovery</H4><p>
     The final issue raised by Judge Lodge about the FBI Laboratory
concerns the mailing of notes and test firings of the weapons.  The
defense orally requested production of Cadigan's notes and the test
firings at the end of the first week or the beginning of the second
week in May 1992.<p>
     Cadigan recalled receiving a call, possibly on Monday, May 10,
1993, from Venkus advising him that the court intended to order
production of his notes and the test firings.  Cadigan received
"the distinct direction" from Venkus to wait until a court order
had been issued before sending test samples and notes. [FN1005]  He
sought advice on the matter from the FBI's Legal Counsel Division,
which suggested to the USAO reasons why the notes and the test
firings should not be given to the defense. [FN1006]<p>
     On Thursday, May 13, Cadigan received an angry call from
Special Agent Dillon asking where the test firings were.  Cadigan
explained that he was waiting for a court order.  Dillon told
Cadigan to send the notes and test firings to Boise immediately. 
Because Cadigan did not wish to "cause the Agents a problem," he
facsimiled his notes to Boise.  The facsimile was poor, and Cadigan
express-mailed the notes and test firings to Boise, securing the
envelope flaps with tape before placing them into a box for
shipment.<p>
     The following day, Friday, Cadigan was informed that three of
the envelopes had opened during shipment and that the contents had
spilled out and had become commingled.  He instructed the caller to
express-mail the test firings to the Laboratory where he could
rectify the problem by examining microscopic markings.  The test
firings arrived on May 17, 1993.  Cadigan immediately placed them
in the appropriate envelopes and sent the test firings. by
express-mail to Boise. [FN1007]  The prosecution advised the Court 
that the test firings available for defense review on May 18.  
According to Dillon, this delayed the trial and
produced additional discovery problems.<p>
<H3>3.   Discussion</H3><p>
     In analyzing the performance of the FBI Laboratory, we
interviewed field and Laboratory personnel; analyzed field
communications requesting examinations and transmitting physical
evidence; audited Laboratory reports and tracking of examined
articles; assessed criticisms by agencies and interested parties;
inspected the crime scenes; and reviewed grand jury testimony,
court proceedings, and autopsy reports.<p>
<H4>a.   Problems with Delays in Test Results</H4><p>
     Our investigation revealed that Judge Lodge, as well as the
trial team, the FBI field agents, and their supervisors were not
satisfied with the response of the FBI Laboratory in this case. 
[FN1008] In exploring the delays in conducting and reporting 
examinations, we discovered a lack of coordination, communication, 
and cooperation within the FBI.  Unfortunately, these delays had
significant impact on the government's discovery obligations and
the way the government was perceived by the court and at trial.<p>
     Perhaps every prosecution team thinks that its case is most
important and that the Laboratory should respond accordingly.  In
this case, we agree with the prosecutors that the Weaver
prosecution was a most important case that should have been placed
on an expedited and coordinated tracking system.<p>
     We question the wisdom of the FBI Laboratory's practice of
using the trial date as the primary triggering criterion for
Laboratory results.  It is beyond dispute that a trial team needs
test results well before the trial and, ideally, before they  must
be turned over to the defense. [FN1009]<p>
     We also question the practice of accumulating test results in
a single report.  Reporting test results as they are determined
would enable problems to be detected and resolved earlier.  The
procedure would also permit additional tests to be requested and
completed in a ore timely fashion.  Our inquiry found that written
notifications to the field beyond these collective reports were
also late or non-existent.  Although or inspectors were told that
telephonic notifications were made on a regular basis, no
documentation could be located.  Consequently, we can make no
specific determination of the number, date, or contents of
telephonic notifications.  The prosecutors said they received no
Laboratory test results until the latter part of November or the
first part of December about evidence they began to collect in
August. [FN1010]<p>
     We find it unreasonable that tests requested in August and
September were completed in December.  We find the practice of
sending samples back to the field because "specific instructions"
are not contained in the request unreasonable and indicative of
poor communication and coordination. [FN1011]<p>
     When Laboratory tests require additional evidence or specific
instructions, communication with the most knowledgeable people, the
case agents or the prosecutors, should be continuous.  The delay
caused by the lack of blood samples could have been prevented by
coordination and effort.  When Degan's blood samples were shipped
with requests that were not "specific" enough for the Laboratory,
it should have contacted the case agents to get specific advice.
Instead, the Laboratory sent the blood to the transmitting office
where it was allowed to spoil.  Cadigan noted that the case agents
did not "key on" the return of samples. [FN1012]  We do not believe
the responsibility for this delay lies wit the agents alone.  The
December discovery that the blood of Vicki Weaver and Sammy Weaver
and Kevin Harris' hair samples had not been transmitted to the 
FBI Laboratory for tests requested in early September in another 
example of a lack of coordination.<p>
     Cadigan believed that the Laboratory received requests for
examinations that fit the prosecutors' "theory of the week" and
that the resulting tension between the prosecutors and the case
agents adversely affected the coordination necessary between the
field and the Laboratory for timely and effective processing of
evidence. [FN1013]<p>
     One of the reasons the case agents give for the continued
delays after Judge Lodge's Order was the burden placed on the
Laboratory by unnecessary and unreasonable requests by the USAO. 
According to Rampton, the sole purpose of some requests was to avid
the defense focusing on Degan's weapon, upon which the Laboratory
had already completed and ejection pattern test.  However,
Lindquist told us that test firings of all weapons were necessary
to locate where Degan and the others, including Harris and Sammy
Weave, were during the shooting at the Y.  Although he conceded
that the test of Degan's weapon was more critical, Lindquist wanted
to have all the weapons tested to show the jury that the government
was not being selective in its testing.  We find this explanation
reasonable.<p>
     We are not convinced that the delays were the result of
unnecessary requests by the prosecution team.  Rather, we find a
lack of initiative by the Laboratory in conducting examinations
beyond the specific request.  The use of private  experts
apparently renewed the Laboratory's interest in an commitment to
the case.  That was a costly and unnecessary expense.  Our inquiry
found that nothing done by the independent examiners fell outside
the FBI's expertise.<p>
     In addition we find that the Laboratory's failure to respond
in a timely manner contributed to the trial judge's perception that
the government was not meeting its discovery obligations.  Although
the FBI Laboratory did much significant and professional work, the
problems apparent in delays and lack of initiative should be
remedied.  If the primary cause for delays and failure to
coordinate is the result of strained resources, priorities should 
be reevaluated.  If the response in this matter is typical of high
profile homicide cases involving the death of a federal law
enforcement officer and two citizens, we wonder about the response
to matters of less importance.<p>
<H4>b.   Failure to Provide Expertise and the Hiring of
Independent Experts</H4><p>
     Our investigation revealed a lack of cooperation and
initiative by the Laboratory beyond specific tests requested.  We
found that the requisite expertise was present at the Laboratory,
but it was something that the USAO had to discover.  We share the
prosecutors' disappointment in the Laboratory's lack of initiative
or involvement in the case.  We can empathize with the prosecutors
who wanted to use the FBI for experts and receive the benefit of
the Laboratory's suggestions in developing the prosecution theory. 
Although we cannot address the soundness of the examinations the
private experts and prosecutors requested, many of the problems and
the perception of incompetence could have been avoided by direct
conversation between the prosecutors and the Laboratory.<p>
     Cadigan was aware that the idea for some tests, including the
attempt to recreate the hole in Sammy Weaver's jacket, had
originated with the private expert, and the case agents were
frustrated that  the prosecutors were going outside "normal
investigative channels" by hiring experts to conduct "alternative
examinations" that would not be done by the Laboratory. [FN1014] 
Cadigan believes that one of the main differences between the FBI
Laboratory and private examiners is that the FBI Laboratory is
"extremely conservative" and that FBI examiners will not testify to
results not based on scientific fact because the Laboratory must
maintain its reputation of being able to withstand cross
examination.  He believes that this distinguished FBI scientists
from the majority of experts retained by defense counsel, whose
primary purpose is to propose alternate theories to those advanced
by the prosecution.<p>
     If the government's cases are to be presented successfully and
fairly in the courtroom, the technical expertise of the FBI
Laboratory must be available to assist trial teams beyond areas
about which Laboratory experts can testify.  For example, test
firings of the weapons at the Y during the August 21 shooting were
significant for planning the prosecution's theory and establishing
trial strategy.  The prosecutors and the rest of the trial team
needed timely assistance from experts in interpreting evidence. 
Developing alternate theories of how events occurred is part of the
investigative and trial preparation process.  The scope of
information that a prosecutor must develop should not be limited
during trial preparation only to admissible tests and  evidence.<p>
     An example of a test conducted by the independent examiner
that the prosecution found helpful was an identification by
elimination.  The independent examiner did an analysis of
cartridges found at the Y with weapons known to have been on the
scene to exclude those that could not have been responsible for the
cartridges.  The FBI Laboratory expert viewed this form of
identification as unscientific in that other unknown weapons may
have been at the site.  Nevertheless, the elimination of some
weapons would assist the prosecutor in making decisions.  It would
also help at trial to know which weapons are capable of making a
bullet hole associated with the fatal wound.<p>
     We believe a more coordinated, professional, creative, and
cooperative approach to litigation and investigations would be far
more helpful than the process we discovered in the Weaver matter.<p>
<H4>c.   Discovery Demand for Test Firings</H4> and Laboratory Notes<p>
     Our investigation found that the delay in turning over
Laboratory notes and test firings was one of several examples of
the FBI resistance to, disagreement with, and misunderstanding of
its discovery obligations in the Weaver case.  We found the FBI's
actions and decisions inappropriate.  A court should not be
compelled to order discovery compliance to resolve disputes between
components of the government.  Understandably, the delays caused by
this attitude evoked a negative response from the court and
counsel.<p>
     We found no evidence that the delays in the Laboratory tests
were designed or intended to postpone the trial or obstruct
justice.  The decision to wait for an order was in conflict with
the "open discovery" strategy of the USAO and the government's
representations of cooperation in court.  Objections to discovery
should have been addressed to the court through the USAO.  The
accidental commingling of the materials sent to Idaho and the
events that followed contributed to the court's perception that the
FBI had no regard for the rights of the accused and for the
administration of justice.<p>
<H3>4.   Conclusion</H3><p>
     The lack of coordination and communication both within the FBI
and with the USAO appears to be the major cause of the delays and
the other problems examined in this section of the report.<p><hr><p>

     979 Items were also submitted on January 5, 1992.<p>
     980 On January 20, 1993, Lindquist sent Cooper and Roderick's
weapons to the Laboratory and, on February 11, he sent Harris and
Sammy Weaver's weapons for ejection pattern tests.  The results of
the test on Degan's weapon were reported on January 22.<p>
     On January 28, the Laboratory reported that the examinations
requested on January 20 would take ten weeks to complete.  They
were actually completed on March 17.  On February 9, the Laboratory
reported that the examinations requested on January 28 would take
ten weeks to complete.  They were completed on February 25.  On
March 31, the Laboratory reported that the examinations requested
on March 21 would take ten weeks to complete.  They were completed
on April 12.  In our opinion, these inaccurate estimates show a
lack of organization and probably made the prosecution less willing
to request additional testing.<p>

     984 The defense asserted that the two holes would be evidence
that Degan received a shot to his back, spun around, and received
a fatal shot from Cooper.  This theory ignores the identification
of Harris' bullet as the fatal shot to Degan's chest.<p>

     990 The only evidence from the autopsy that was not sent to
the FBI Laboratory were the fingerprint digits, which were examined
by the local police department.<p>
     991 Dr. Lindholm told this inquiry that he was disappointed
that the agents attending these autopsies were not knowledgeable
about events surrounding the injuries.  FD-302 Interview of Dr.
George Lindholm, October 7, 1993, at 2.<p>
     992 Blood and hair samples were taken from Randy Weaver after
he surrendered and were forwarded to the FBI Laboratory on
September 1, 1992.  Cadigan FD-302, August 17, 1993, at 25.  There
is no record of the Laboratory receiving blood samples of the
Weaver group, other than Randy Weaver's.  An FBI interview report
erroneously stated that a sample of Harris's hair had been taken.
After his surrender, Harris was taken to a hospital for treatment.
According to a report prepared by FBI Special Agent James T. Davis,
dated August 30, 1992, Davis took a blood sample from Harris at the
hospital and Special Agent John took hair samples.  The blood
sample was forwarded to the FBI Laboratory on September 1, 1992. 
We understand that John did not obtain hair samples.<p>

<H3>IV. SPECIFIC ISSUES INVESTIGATED</H3><p>
 <H3>K. The Preliminary Hearings of Weaver and Harris</H3> <p>
  <H3>1. Introduction</H3> <p>
  Following their arrests, government agents transported
Weaver and Harris to hospitals to receive medical treatment for
the gunshot wounds that they had suffered. Thereafter, the
court decided to conduct separate preliminary hearings for the
two men. In addition, the federal magistrate judges handling
the preliminary hearings elected to combine the preliminary
examination and detention hearing in one proceeding. The
combined preliminary examination and detention hearing for
Weaver was scheduled to begin on September 10, 1992; the
combined preliminary examination and detention hearing for
Harris was scheduled to begin on September 14, 1992. <p>
  On Friday, September 11, 1992, one day after the Weaver
preliminary hearing had begun, U.S. Attorney Ellsworth appeared
in court to argue a motion seeking to continue the preliminary
hearing of Harris from September 14 to September 15 in order to
accommodate the additional security needs presented by the visit
of Vice President Quayle to Boise on September 14. It has been
alleged that Ellsworth represented in court that Harris would be
permitted a full preliminary hearing that would not be
terminated or interrupted by the return of a grand jury
indictment. With the understanding that a full preliminary
hearing would be conducted, counsel for Harris consented to the
continuance. <p>
   The preliminary hearing of Harris began on
September 15. On the second day of the preliminary hearing, the
proceeding were interrupted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Ronald
Howen, who informed the court that the grand jury had just
returned an indictment against Weaver and Harris. The Weaver
preliminary hearing was also interrupted and the parties
informed of the indictment. Although the magistrate judges
ultimately decided to discontinue the preliminary hearings, they
afforded Weaver and Harris the opportunity to question witnesses
during the detention phase of the hearings. <p>
   It has been alleged that the government acted
improperly when it sought grand jury indictments while the
preliminary hearings were in progress. In particular, it has
been argued that once the government elected to proceed by
preliminary hearing, it was stopped from abandoning the
preliminary hearing. With regard to the Harris preliminary
proceeding, the question has been raised whether the government,
in light of the Ellsworth representations, was obliged to
complete the preliminary hearing and whether the failure to do
so violated any legal or ethical rules. <p>
  <H3>2. Statement of Facts</H3> <p>
  <H4>a. Arrest and Initial Processing of Weaver and Harris</H4> <p>
  On August 23, 1992, a criminal complaint was filed
charging Weaver and Harris with violations of 18 U.S.C. 111,
1111 and 1114. Harris surrendered to federal authorities on
August 30, and was taken for medical treatment to the intensive
care unit at Sacred Heart Medical Center in Spokane, Washington. 
The next day, Weaver surrendered and was taken to St. Lukes
Hospital in Boise for treatment. On September 2, 1992, U.S.
Magistrate Judge Cynthia Imbrogno conducted the initial
appearance of Harris in the hospital and continued his
preliminary examination and detention hearing until September 14
because of his medical condition. <p>
  Assistant U.S. Attorney Howen originally planned to
conduct joint preliminary hearings for Weaver and Harris but the
delay caused by the medical treatment for Harris, coupled with
federal time requirements, precluded this plan. [FN1015] As a 
result, the preliminary hearing for Weaver was scheduled for 
September 10th before Magistrate Judge Mikel Williams and the 
preliminary hearing for Harris was scheduled for September 14 
before Magistrate Judge Lawrence Boyle. The magistrate judges 
decided to conduct the preliminary hearing and detention hearing 
in one proceeding. <p>
  Howen was assigned to handled the Harris preliminary hearing 
while Assistant U.S. Attorney Lindquist was assigned to handle the
Weaver preliminary hearing. [FN1016] Howen initially expected
that he would present the government's case at the Harris
preliminary hearing through a summary witness and that this
presentation would take half a day. Lindquist expected each
preliminary hearing to take two days "at the most." According
to Howen, it was the normal practice of the magistrates in the
district to schedule the preliminary hearing after the grand
jury had convened, if the time requirements permitted, so as to
avoid conducting a preliminary hearing if an indictment were
going to be returned. Thus, Howen was surprised when the
magistrates set the Weaver and Harris preliminary hearings
before the grand jury met in [G.J.] [FN1019]<p>
  From the moment that Weaver and Harris were taken into custody,
Howen intended to present an indictment at the next session of 
the grand jury which was scheduled for [G.J.]. [FN1020] All
attorneys working on the matter knew of this plan, including
U.S. Attorney Ellsworth, who as head of the office, supervised
Howen and Lindquist. Indeed, in his September 3, 1992 letter to
Special Agent in Charge Eugene Glenn, Ellsworth noted that the
grand jury proceeding would begin on [G.J.]. [FN1021]<p>
  Howen always believed that if the grand jury were to return 
an indictment before the preliminary hearings were completed 
that the indictment would extinguish the right to the preliminary
hearing. [FN1022] He believed that Ellsworth shared this view. 
[FN1023] Indeed, Howen recalled that prior to the beginning of the
preliminary hearings, he discussed with Lindquist and he
believes also with Ellsworth the possibility that the Harris
preliminary hearing could be terminated by the return of an
indictment. [FN1024]<p>
  <H4>b. September 10-11. 1992</H4> <p>
  The combined preliminary examination and detention hearing 
for Weaver began on September 10. On that day the government 
spent the entire day examining Deputy Marshal Roderick. [FN1025]
When the preliminary hearing resumed on September 11, defense 
counsel cross-examined Roderick and, in the afternoon,
the government conducted the direct examination of Deputy
Marshal Cooper. At the end of the proceedings on September 11,
it was agreed, at the request of defense counsel Gerry Spence,
that the hearing would resume on September 16, 1992. [FN1026]<p>
  On Friday September 11, 1992, three days before the
Harris preliminary hearing was to commence, U.S. Attorney
Ellsworth, filed a motion and a supporting affidavit requesting
that the Harris preliminary hearing be continued one day until
September 15. Ellsworth explained that the Bose Chief of Police
had expressed concern to him about being able to provide
security to both the Harris preliminary hearing and to Vice
President Quayle who was scheduled to visit Boise on September
14. [FN1027] In arguing the motion to the court, Ellsworth 
[FN1028] told the court that the U.S. Secret Service had also 
expressed concern over the increased security demands created 
by the Quayle visit. [FN1029] When Judge Boyle asked for Harris' 
position on the continuance, defense counsel Nevin replied: <p>
  The primary concern that I have is that this not be
simply an opportunity for the government to get a grand jury
impaneled and to indict Mr. Harris and avoid the obligation to
provide him with a preliminary hearing. And I've been afraid
all along that was what was going to happen and that this would
get delayed in some way so that would be possible. <p>
  I understand . . . this is approximately the time when
the grand jury sits and is available. And if this is just an
effort to do that, then I certainly object to it. [FN1030]<p>
  Now maybe Mr. Ellsworth could assure us or we could
stipulate that a preliminary will be held on Tuesday and that
there will not be an indictment filed which would supersede
that, and in that case I would be glad to stipulate to it. <p>
  The court then invited comment from the Government to
which Ellsworth responded: <p>
  As indicated in my affidavit there is no underlying basis
for this . . . beyond the representations to me of the chief of
police of Boise. . . . [W]e are prepared and ready to go to the
preliminary hearing on Monday. I am willing to give assurances
that we intend to have a preliminary hearing and there is no
ulterior motive other than the request of the chief of police of
Boise that the -- he's concerned about his security people. . .
.But there is no ulterior motive other than what's expressed in
the motion and affidavit. [FN1031]<p>
  Thereafter, the following exchange occurred between the
parties and the court, <p>
  THE COURT: Okay. Do you gentlemen want to take a minute
and talk privately and then I can come back in? <p>
  MR. NEVIN: Yeah, I mean if -- if what counsel is saying
is that there is going to be a preliminary hearing on Tuesday
not matter what, why that's fine. I -- we -- no objection. <p>
  THE COURT: So you would agree and stipulate to -- <p>
  MR. NEVIN: Yeah. <p>
  THE COURT: -- to postpone the preliminary examination and
detention hearing from Monday the 14th to Tuesday the 15th? <p>
  MR. NEVIN: Upon that condition, yes. <p>
  MR. ELLSWORTH: The government has no problem with
that stipulation. <p>
  THE COURT: Well, let me just understand so I don't make
a procedural mistake. And is it my understanding Mr. Nevin,
that you agree based on the representations of the United States
attorney that their motive is simply to honor requests by the
chief of police regarding Mr. Quayle's visit to Boise, you will
stipulate for a transfer of this -- or rescheduling of this from
Monday until Tuesday? <p>
  MR. NEVIN: Yeah. And just so I don't make a
mistake in what I'm saying. I read what Mr. Ellsworth has said
as a guaranty that we'll have a prelim on Tuesday, and that's
there -- this is not an attempt to delay this proceeding so that
an indictment could be filed or the grand jury could be
impaneled, whatever. And that we will have a preliminary
hearing on Tuesday no matter what. And upon that representation
I stipulated that the matter may be continued until Tuesday. <p>
  THE COURT: Okay, you're not asking as a condition
of your stipulation that they not subsequently impanel a grand
jury and return an indictment if that's such? <p>
  MR. NEVIN: Yeah. No, I don't consider that to be part
of our stipulation. <p>
  THE COURT: All right. Mr. Ellsworth, is that agreement
adequate for you? <p>
  MR. ELLSWORTH: I have no problem with that agreement,
Your Honor. . . . [FN1032]<p>
 Thereafter, Judge Boyle granted me motion to continue the
preliminary hearing until September 15. [FN1033]<p>
  Ellsworth told investigator that when he argued this
motion he expected that the Harris preliminary hearing would
take no longer than one day. At that time, he was aware that
Magistrate Judge Williams had permitted Weaver's defense counsel
to subpoena the marshals to testify; however, Ellswroth did not
know whether Magistrate Judge Boyle, who was new on the bench,
would adopt a similar approach in the Harris preliminary hearing.
Ellsworth knew that they intended to present an indictment on 
[G.J.] [FN1035] but denied discussing with anyone or giving
serious consideration to what would occur if an indictment were
returned while the preliminary hearing was in progress. [FN1036]
Ellsworth stated that he was surprised when the defense objected
to his request and believed that they distrusted his stated
reason for the continuance. [FN1037] Ellsworth insisted that he 
did not believe that he was guaranteeing a full preliminary 
hearing. He saw no conflict between his representation and his 
knowledge that an indictment would be presented on [G.J.] since 
he thought that the hearing would take one day and, thus, would 
be over before the indictment was presented to the grand jury. 
[FN1038]<p>
  Neither Howen nor Lindquist recall having any discussions with 
Ellsworth before he appeared in court on September 11th. [FN1039]
However, Howen believed that Ellsworth knew that the government
intended to present an indictment to the grand jury on [G.J.] 
[FN1040] and that the magistrate in the Weaver preliminary hearing 
was giving defense counsel unusually broad latitude in calling
witnesses and in permitting expanded cross-examination of the
government's witnesses. [FN1041] Furthermore, Howen told 
investigators that after the first day of the Weaver preliminary 
hearing it "was very apparent" to them that the preliminary 
hearing would be longer than a one or two day proceeding. [FN1042]<p>
  <H4>c. [G.J.]</H4> <p>
  (1) [G.J.] <p>
  [G.J.]<p>
  [FN1043]<p>
  [G.J.]<p>
  [FN1044]<p>
  (2) Beginning of the Harris Preliminary Hearing <p>
  The preliminary hearing of Harris began on September 15. 
For the first two hours, Howen argued 10 motions that the
government had filed late the previous day. [FN1045] Thereafter,
Lindquist spent the remaining part of the day conducting the
direct examination of Special Agent Gregory Rampton while Howen
left the hearing and presented witnesses before the grand jury
in another room in the courthouse. <p>
  At the end of the proceedings on September 15, Lindquist
informed the court that he had a scheduling conflict if the
Harris preliminary hearing continued the next day since he was
supposed to participate in the Weaver preliminary hearing. 
Lindquist explained that Howen was unavailable to conduct either
hearing because, "we have the grand jury convened, which is
going to demand his time." [FN1046] As a result, Lindquist 
requested that the Harris hearing be continued. After defense 
counsel objected to the request, [FN1047] the following colloquy 
occurred: <p>
  MR. NEVIN: . . . . The -- I have been concerned all
through this, that where the United States was going with a
grand jury indictment, and then an argument that would cut off
our right to have a preliminary hearing. <p>
  When we appeared in Court last Thursday, Mr. Ellsworth
was there, and Mr. Ellsworth was there on a motion to continue
these proceedings from yesterday until today. <p>
  I said at that time, that was what I was afraid they were
doing, and that if they would guarantee me that was not what
they were doing, and that we would go forward with a preliminary
hearing, no matter what, they holding it at another time was
fine with me. <p>
  I went outside here, and I saw grand jury witnesses going
into the grand jury room, I know that's what they are doing. 
We've been told Mr. Howen can't be here tomorrow because he's
got to appear before, and again that's a choice they have made
for him to be there instead of here. <p>
  But, in any event, if counsel will assure me that we will
hold and complete this preliminary hearing, I don't mind if we
continue it until a later time, and that there will be not
argument upon -- if a grand jury indictment is returned, that
we're not entitled to complete this hearing. And upon that
insurance, let's hold it another time, whenever it's convenient,
that's fine. . . . <p>
  MR. LINDQUIST: . . . [C]ounsel will not have that
assurance. We're all very much aware that the purpose of a
preliminary hearing does not result in a charging document. The
purpose is to get us to that grand jury, which is the
institution that initiates the charging document. . . . <p>
  I'm simply saying that we are proceeding with the grand
jury as it is convened, pursuant to Court order, and I'm not
going to make any commitment as to what that grand jury will do. 
That is not in my power. That's not my authority. [FN1048]<p>
The court then asked Lindquist whether he had "visited with Mr.
Ellsworth about the nature of the hearing held last week on this
very question," to which Lindquist replied that he had "about a
two-meeting" with Ellsworth and had simply learned that defense
counsel was cynical about the reasons Ellsworth had given for
the continuance. Having ordered that the preliminary hearing
reconvene the next morning, the court explained that it was
going to "pull out the tape" of the earlier hearing because it
believed that Ellsworth had represented that "there would be a
complete preliminary hearing held in this matter." <p>
  <H4>d. September 16, 1992 </H4><p>
  (1). [G.J.] <p>
  [G.J.]<p>
  [FN1050]<p>
  [G.J.]<p>
[FN1051] Thereafter, the grand jury deliberated and returned two
indictments against Weaver and Harris charging them with
violations of 18 U.S.C. 1. 115, 1111 and 1114. <p>
  Howen stated that when he presented the indictment to the
grand jury his understanding of what Ellsworth had stated in
court that previous Friday was that the continuance was
requested to accommodate the security concerns of the police and
the Secret Service and that the request was not a subterfuge to
avoid having a preliminary hearing before an indictment was
returned. He was aware of no other representations having been
made by Ellsworth. [FN1052] In addition, Howen said it was unclear
to him whether Judge Boyle was going to allow the same broad
latitude in issuing subpoenas to Harris as Judge Williams had
allowed for Weaver which would extend the length of the Harris
hearing. [FN1053]<p>
  Ellsworth believed that before the indictment was
presented that he had briefly mentioned his September 11th
statements to Howen and Lindquist but that he had not discussed
the statements in detail including any representations he may
have made to Nevin that Harris would have a preliminary hearing. 
[FN1054] Ellsworth denied that they ever discussed that the Harris
preliminary hearing could be terminated by obtaining the return
of an indictment. However, he conceded that they did
contemplate ending the Weaver preliminary hearing in this
fashion. [FN1055]<p>
 (2) Harris Preliminary Hearing <p>
  The Harris preliminary hearing resumed on September 16
with the defense examining its first witness, Deputy Marshal
Hunt. Assistant U.S. Attorney Monty Stiles handled the proceeding
while Lindquist continued to handle the Weaver preliminary hearing
and Howen was before the grand jury. [FN1056] In the middle of the
morning session, Howen interrupted the proceedings and informed 
the court that the grand jury had returned two indictments against
Weaver and Harris. [FN1057] Howen requested immediate arraignment. 
Thereafter, the court declared a 10 minute recess. When court 
resumed, Howen stated that he had not been present in court when 
certain conversations occurred between the court and Ellsworth. The 
court then took another brief recess to allow Howen to review a 
transcript of the September 11 hearing transcribed by the judge's 
secretary the previous evening. [FN1058]<p>
  When the proceedings resumed, Judge Boyle made it clear
that he considered the initial appearance of Harris to have been
at the Spokane hospital on August 30, 1991 before Judge Imbrogno
and, therefore, that the time requirements of Fed. R. Crim. P. 
began to run from that date. [FN1059] Howen then argued that the 
case would have been indicted the prior week if the court had not
delayed the impaneling of the grand jury for one week because of
the Labor Day holiday. [FN1060] Howen then admitted that Ellsworth
"did guarantee a preliminary hearing" but argued "[w]e appeared 
for the preliminary hearing. . . . [W]e think at this time, with 
the return of the indictments. . . the preliminary hearing now
should go on to the detention hearing. . . ."  [FN1061]<p>
  Although Judge Boyle concluded that Ellsworth had moved
for the continuance in good faith and seemed to agree that, as a
legal matter, the return of an indictment extinguished the right
to a preliminary hearing, he was concerned that the Ellsworth
representations might have estopped the government from indicting 
Harris. [FN1062] In response, Howen adopted a narrow reading
of the September 11 transcript and argued that preliminary
hearings are typically brief and that all that Ellsworth was
promising was that a preliminary hearing would be held on
September 15 [FN1063] and that because a hearing had been held on 
that day, the Government was not estopped from indicting Harris. 
[FN1064] Howen denied having any improper motive in presenting the
indictment to the grand jury and argued that because the
defendants were in custody, they had a right to immediate
presentment before a grand jury and indeed, that the Speedy
Trial Act mandated that they be brought before a grand jury
within 30 days of arrest. [FN1065]<p>
  Defense counsel Nevin argued that this matter was not
dependent upon the statutory provisions and caselaw that held
that an indictment extinguished the right to a preliminary
hearing but rather was dependent upon the effect to be given
Harris' waiver of a right to object to a continuance in return
for a promise by the U.S. Attorney that Harris would have a
preliminary hearing. [FN1066] Nevin, pointing to the lengthy 
argument of motions and the lengthy direct examination of 
Rampton, argued that Howen had no intention of completing the 
preliminary hearing on September 15, 1992. [FN1067] He maintained
that the clear import of what was stated in court on September 
11th was that in return for Harris' consent to continuing the 
preliminary hearing the government agreed to give Harris a full 
preliminary hearing without interrupting it with the return of an 
indictment. [FN1068] Thereafter, Nevin moved to quash the 
indictment. <p>
  After listening to the arguments of the parties, the
court took the matter under advisement and commenced the
detention phase of the hearing. [FN1069] Thereafter, the 
government resumed its direct questioning of Special Agent 
Rampton after which defense counsel cross examined Rampton. <p>
  stigators found that Ellsworth had a somewhat confused
recollection of the events during this time period. He recalled
having concern after the Harris preliminary hearing proceedings
concluded on September 15 because it became apparent to him that
they would continue beyond the one day he had anticipated. It
was at that point that he recalled discussing with either Howen
or Lindquist that they might have to continue the preliminary
hearing. However, he did not remember that they ever considered
not presenting the indictment on September 16. Indeed, it was
his recollection that they decided to proceed and to deal with
any objections to the indictment that were raised. [FN1070]<p>
  Howen told investigators that if he had been arguing the
motion on September 11, he would not have made the statements
that Ellsworth did. He attributed these statements to the fact
that Ellsworth was not the attorney responsible for litigating
the case and that he was unfamiliar with the issues in the case.
Had Howen been in court, he would have explained that, if the
court were to conduct the preliminary hearing before the
convening of the grand jury -- a schedule that Howen argued was
inconsistent with the practice in the district -- he would
present an indictment, which, if returned, would extinguish the
preliminary hearing. [FN1071] Despite his views about the 
statements made by Ellsworth, Howen stated that if had been 
provided a copy of the September 11 transcript before going 
before the grand jury it would not have changed his decision 
to present the indictment. [FN1072]<p>
  Based on his conversations with Ellsworth, Lindquist
believed that on September 11 Ellsworth intended to agree that
Harris had a right to a preliminary hearing but not to agree
that the government could not seek an indictment that would
terminate the preliminary hearing. Lindquist thought that
Ellsworth intended to guarantee at least a partial preliminary
hearing. However, Lindquist admitted that he believed that they
"all agreed that what was communicated to [Nevin] was probably
ambigious and could easily have been interpreted as I get my
preliminary hearing from beginning to end." [FN1073]<p>
 (3) Weaver Preliminary Hearing <p>
  On September 16, the preliminary hearing of Weaver
resumed. However, before defense counsel began to cross-examine
Deputy Marshal Cooper, Lindquist informed the court and defense
counsel that a grand jury had been convened and would be handing
down an indictment that day. [FN1074] Shortly thereafter, an 
indictment was served on Weaver and the court heard argument from 
the parties as to whether the preliminary hearing should be
continued. The court then permitted defense counsel to cross-
examine Cooper before ruling that the preliminary hearing was
being terminated. Judge Williams concluded that the grand
jury's finding of probable cause obviated the need for the
preliminary hearing and opined that the issue of prosecutorial
misconduct could be addressed by motion with the district court
judge. [FN1075] Thereafter, the court proceeded to the detention phase
of the proceedings. Lindquist rested after introducing a few
exhibits; defense counsel called no additional witnesses. The
court ordered that Weaver be detained. [FN1076]<p>
 <H4>e. September 17, 1992</H4> <p>
  On September 17, the court ruled on the Harris motion to
quash the indictment. Judge Boyle concluded that although he
"truly believe[d]" that Ellsworth had made the request for a
continuance in good faith, he interpreted "the stipulation
entered into between counsel as contemplating that Mr. Harris
would be entitled to a preliminary examination." [FN1077] With 
regard to what legal effect should be given the breach of the 
agreement, including whether it warranted quashing the indictment,
Judge Boyle thought that the issue was better left to a 
superseding proceeding or appeal. However, he did not believe 
that Harris had been prejudiced by how the preliminary and 
detention hearings were conducted. [FN1078] The court concluded 
that the return of the indictment extinguished the need for the 
purpose of the preliminary hearing which was to determine whether
probable cause existed that a crime had been committed and that 
Harris had committed it. As a result, Judge Boyle held that the
preliminary hearing would not continue. [FN1079]<p>
  Thereafter, the court began the detention phase of the
hearing and defense counsel proceeded to cross-examine Special
Agent Rampton. After Rampton completed his testimony, defense
counsel called and questioned Deputy Marshals Dave Hunt, Arthur
Roderick, Larry Cooper, Joseph Thomas and Francis Norris. 
Following argument by counsel, Judge Boyle ordered that Harris
be detained. [FN1080]<p>
 <H4>f. Subsequent Defense Challenges </H4><p>
  On November 16, 1992, Weaver and Harris sought to dismiss
the indictments returned against them, arguing, among other
grounds that the preliminary hearing had been improperly
terminated. They asserted that the Government improperly
obtained the indictments only after it realized that probable
cause had not been demonstrated at the preliminary hearings
because none of the witnesses offered had seen either defendant
fire the shot that killed Degan. In addition, they argued that
once the Government elected to proceed against the defendant by
preliminary hearing it should "be estopped from abandoning that
proceeding." [FN1081] To hold otherwise, in their view, would 
permit the Government to abuse the preliminary hearing, if it 
appeared that the defense might prevail, in violation of the 
due process rights of the defendants to introduce evidence. 
[FN1082] Harris also contended that dismissal was warranted in 
his case since his consent to a continuance had been secured by 
a false promise that the hearing would not be superseded by an 
indictment. [FN1083]<p>
  The government filed its response to the Weaver and
Harris motions to dismiss on November 23, 1992 and argued that
there was no legal authority to support the proposition that it
was unconstitutional for the prosecution to have the grand jury
return an indictment while a preliminary hearing was in
progress. [FN1084] Furthermore, the Government noted that Weaver 
had requested the continuance of the preliminary hearing from 
September 11, 1992 to September 16, 1992. [FN1085] The 
Government failed to address directly Harris' argument that the 
Government had represented that an indictment would not be 
returned prior to the completion of the preliminary hearing. It 
did, however, argue that Harris had been afforded a completed 
preliminary hearing that was completed on September 17, 1992, one 
day after the indictment had been returned. [FN1086]<p>
  Magistrate Judge Williams concluded that the U.S.
Attorney's Office had acted within the scope of the applicable
laws and was not guilty of prosecutorial misconduct. In
addition, he concluded that there was no legal barrier to an
indictment being returned prior to the completion of the
preliminary hearing. Once the indictment was returned, the need
for the probable cause determination of the preliminary hearing
became unnecessary. [FN1087]<p>
  Shortly thereafter, Magistrate Judge Boyle ruled on the claims 
made by Harris in his Motion to Dismiss. [FN1088] In that
opinion, Judge Boyle adhered to his earlier ruling on the issue
and reiterated his conclusion that there was no legal impediment
to a grand jury returning an indictment while a preliminary
hearing was in progress. [FN1089] In addition, Judge Boyle found 
that Harris had failed to demonstrate that he had been deprived of
any constitutional or procedural right or that he had suffered
prejudice that justified dismissal of the indictment. [FN1090] 
Nowhere in his opinion did Judge Boyle address the impact of the
Ellsworth representations. <p>
  On January 8, 1993, Weaver and Harris filed a joint
motion in which, among other forms of relief, they sought to
dismiss the indictment. In this pleading, they repeated their
allegation that the U.S. Attorney's Office had subverted the
preliminary hearing process by securing a grand jury indictment
when it had become apparent that probable cause could not be
found at the preliminary hearing. In addition, they argued that
this alleged subversion was exacerbated in the case of Harris
since the U.S. Attorney had stated to the court that an
indictment would not be sought until the completion of the
preliminary hearing. [FN1091]<p>
  District Court Judge Edward Lodge rejected this defense
challenge and adopted the recommended report and order of
Magistrate Judges Williams and Boyle in orders issued on
February 17, 1993. Judge Lodge repeated his rejection of the
motion to dismiss in his order addressing the motion to
disqualify the U.S. Attorney's Office from prosecuting the case. <p>
  <H3>3. Discussion</H3> <p>
  We agree with the judicial determinations in the Weaver
and Harris prosecutions that the return of an indictment in the
midst of a preliminary hearing extinguishes the right to a
preliminary hearing. The sole purpose of the preliminary
hearing is to determine whether probable cause exists to believe
that the defendant has committed the criminal conduct described
in the complaint. Once the grand jury has made an independent
determination that probable cause exists and returns an
indictment, that document becomes the charging document in the
prosecution. There is no reason for the preliminary hearing to
continue. Nor are we aware of any estoppel principle that would
restrict the government from returning an indictment while a
preliminary hearing is in progress. <p>
  Despite this conclusion, we are troubled by the
representations that Ellsworth made in court on September 11th,
and question whether the members of the U.S. Attorney's Office-
- especially Ellsworth -- behaved ethically in light of these
representations. Our concern is not that Ellsworth fabricated
the need for a continuance since the record is uncontradicted
that law enforcement personnel had articulated the security
problems created by the trial and the Quayle visit. Rather, our
concern is directed at two other areas. First, whether the
statements that Ellsworth made constituted a guarantee that
Harris would have a "full" or "complete" preliminary hearing in
return for agreeing to a continuance and, if such a
representation was made, did Ellsworth make it with the intent
to promise a complete preliminary hearing. [FN1092] Second, 
whether Howen or Lindquist understood that Ellsworth had made 
such a representation before the indictment was presented to 
the grand jury. <p>
  Focusing on the first issue, an examination of the
September 11 transcript reveals clearly that defense counsel
Nevin was concerned that if the preliminary hearing were
continued, the prosecution might obtain an indictment and
terminate the hearing. Thereafter, there was an exchange among
Nevin, Ellsworth and the court in which the agreement of the
parties was formed. Ellsworth insisted that he had not ulterior
motive for the request and stated that "I am willing to give
assurances that we intend to have a preliminary hearing . . . ." 
[FN1093] Nevin said that he would have no objection to the 
continuance "if what counsel if saying is that there is going to 
be a preliminary hearing on Tuesday no matter what. . . ." [FN1094]
Ellsworth responded that "[t]he government has no problem with that
stipulation." The court then proceeded to ensure that the
parties understood the terms of the agreement. Nevin agreed
that he was agreeing to continue the preliminary hearing on the
representation that Ellsworth was making the motion simply to
honor the requests of the chief of police, that Ellsworth was
not making the request to permit his office time to present an
indictment to the grand jury and that Ellsworth was providing a
guarantee that Harris would have a preliminary hearing on
September 15. Nevin agreed that the agreement did not include a
promise that the USAO would not subsequently impanel a grand
jury and return an indictment. In response, Ellsworth told the
court that he had "no problem" with the terms of the agreement. 
[FN1095]<p>
  Critical to this issue is what did Ellsworth intend or
believe he was promising when he entered into this agreement on
September 11, 1992. The defense argued that he was promising a
"full" preliminary hearing. In contrast, Ellsworth and Howen
seem to believe that Ellsworth never promised a "full"
preliminary hearing but rather "a" hearing or "some" preliminary
hearing would be held on September 15. Ellsworth stated that he
believed that the hearing could be completed in one day. Both
men did not believe that any guarantees had been given that, if
the preliminary hearing took longer than one day, that an
indictment would not be returned. <p>
  If we were to strictly construe the meaning of the words
used by the parties, it is true that the word "full" or its
functional equivalent was never uttered in court. However, we
are uncomfortable with the hypertechnicality of such an
approach. We believe that implicit in a request for a promise
of "a" preliminary hearing is the idea of a full rather than a
partial preliminary hearing. Indeed, when first confronted with
the statements that Ellsworth made, Howen stated to the court,
"[w]e think, in good faith, the United States Attorney, with the
-- with the transcript I have here, did guarantee a preliminary
hearing. [FN1096] The remarks of the court echoed this view. 
[FN1097] In its initial ruling on this issue, the Court concluded 
that the stipulation "contemplate[ed] that Mr. Harris would be 
entitled to a preliminary examination." [FN1098]<p>
  Having concluded that a fair interpretration of the
language used by Ellsworth was to promise a complete preliminary
hearing we must proceed to our next area of inquiry which is
what did Ellsworth intend when he made these representations in
court. Ellsworth insisted that it was never his intent to
guarantee that Harris would have a complete preliminary hearing
but rather only to represent that there would be "a" preliminary
hearing on September 15. [FN1099] A careful review of the evidence
does not convice us otherwise. Thus, we cannot conclude that
Ellsworth intended to guarantee Harris a full preliminary
hearing. <p>
  Despite this conclusion, we are concerned by the actions
of Ellsworth. At the outset, we are troubled by the
insensitivity or misunderstanding that he demonstrated
concerning the impact of his September 11 statements. Ellsworth
failed to appreciate the effect given to his words because they
were uttered by someone in the position of the U.S. Attorney. 
We are also concerned about the apparent failure of Ellsworth to
carefully and continually evaluate all of the information
available to him. The evidence establishes that Ellsworth knew
on September 11 that Howen would be seeking an indictment when
the grand jury convened on [G.J.]. It also appears that
Ellsworth may have participated in discussions concerning the
possibility that an indictment could be returned while the
preliminary hearing was in progress and that the legal effect of
this action would be to extinguish the preliminary hearing. 
Finally, it seems probable that Ellsworth also was aware that
judicial rulings in the Weaver preliminary hearing had permitted
the defense board latitude in calling witnesses to testify in
the preliminary hearing thereby transforming it from a summary
proceeding into a longer hearing and that the potential existed 
that the Harris hearing might be similarly handled. Although
this information was available to Ellsworth, there was no
indication that he carefully evaluated it when considering the
timing of the Harris indictment. Thus, despite our inability to
comfortable conclude that Ellsworth intentionally misrepresented
the nature of the government's agreement, we believe that his
inattention to the clear import of his words coupled with his
failure to monitor the progress of the Harris preliminary
hearing and the timing of the presentment of the indictment came
precipitously close to unethical conduct. <p>
  The investigative record failed to develop evidence
establishing that Howen or Lindquist understood the scope of
what Ellsworth had arguably promised in court on September 11. 
Based on their remarks to the court and to us, both men, prior
to the time when the indictment was returned, appeared to have
been under the impression that the main issue discusses in court
was whether the security concerns articulated by Ellsworth
constituted a fabricated excuse designed to give the government
more time in which to secure an indictment. [FN1100] From his 
remarks to the court on September 15, Lindquist did not seem to see
Ellsworth's statements as providing a guarantee that there would
be a preliminary hearing but rather only as an indication that
they intended to proceed with the preliminary hearing on that
date. <p>
  However, we are concerned about the events after the
court session on September 15. Based on a reading of the
transcript of the proceeding, we find it difficult to believe
that Mr. Lindquist did not realize at the end of that day that a
serious issue had developed over the representations that
Ellsworth had made four days earlier. Indeed, we believe that
Lindquist may have raised his concern to Howen because <p>
  [G.J.] <p>
[FN1101] It appears that neither Howen or Lindquist ever considered
or discussed the need to evaluate the impact of the Ellsworth
statements before resuming the grand jury proceedings. We think
that the potential implications of these statements were
apparent and, thus, we would have expected some discussion to
have occurred about the impact of indicting Harris while the
preliminary hearing was still in progress. <p>
  As a practical matter we do not believe that Harris was
prejudiced by this controversy since he was allowed to question
witnesses during the detention phase of the proceeding that he
would have probably called to testify at the preliminary hearing
if had been allowed to continue. [FN1102] Rather, what concerns us 
is the appearance of impropriety created when Mr. Ellsworth, as the
U.S. Attorney, made statements that reasonable indicated that a
promise of a preliminary hearing was being made and then
supervised actions that appeared to violate that promise. 
Moreover, we are also concerned that this situation may have
been attributable in part to the failure of Mr. Ellsworth to
have thoroughly evaluated and monitored the information
available to him before and after his appearance in court on
September 11th. <p>
  <H3>4. Conclusion</H3> <p>
  We conclude that a reasonable interpretation of the
language that Ellsworth used in court on September 11, 1991 was
that Mr. Harris would have a full preliminary hearing. Although
the government never promised that an indictment would not be
returned it created the impression upon which the defense relied
that such a return would not occur until the preliminary hearing
had been completed. We do not believe that Mr. Ellsworth
intentionally misrepresented the position of the government yet
we do conclude that he gave insufficient consideration to the
information available to him and to the plain meaning of his
statements. Finally, the evidence does not sustain the charge
that before the indictment was presented to the grand jury that
Howen and Lindquist believed that Ellsworth had guaranteed a
complete preliminary hearing to Harris. We find no misconduct
by them in this matter.  <p><hr><P>   Released through<p>

grand jury for the District of Idaho would meed [G.J.]
                    but could not do so in September 1992 because
of delay caused by the Labor Day holiday and the need to swear in
a new grand jury.  If this delay had not occurred, the grand jury
would have met on  [G.J.]     and returned the indictment before
the preliminary hearing had begun.  It was the Government's
contention that the defense had attempted to manipulate the
preliminary hearing proceedings so as "to frustrate and prevent
the orderly receipt of evidence and testimony by the Grand Jury" 
and that its request for a remand for further preliminary hearing
was no more that a discovery device since they has been unable to

the Department of Justice has not adopted the ABA Standards as

     1097. For example, at the proceedings on September 15th,
after Lindquist informed the court of his scheduling problems,
defense counsel Nevin reiterated his concern about the grand jury
returning an indictment.  When Lindquist asserted that he could
not assure Nevin that Harris would have a complete preliminary
hearing uninterrupted by an indictment, the court inquired
whether Lindquist had "visited with Mr. Ellsworth about the
nature of the hearing held last week on this very question." 
Later the court stated that it was going to review that tape of
the hearing that evening because he thought that "there was some
representation that there would be a complete preliminary hearing
held in this matter."  Id. 228-233.<p>
     1098. Id., September 17, 1992, at 4.  During their
discussions with investigators, Lindquist agreed that the words
uttered by Ellsworth were ambiguous while Ellsworth conceded that
one could have concluded from his words that he was guaranteeing
a full preliminary hearing.  Ellsworth Interview, Tape 3, at 43.

     1099. Ellsworth Interview, Tape 3, at 43.<p>
     1100. Later, when asked to interpret the September 11
statements that Ellsworth made, both Howen and Lindquist
interpreted them as promising "some" preliminary hearing but not
a "full" preliminary hearing.  For the reasons already discussed
we do not agree  with this interpretation of the record. 
Although we find these interpretations of the Ellsworth
statements by Howen and Lindquist to be somewhat disingenuous we
do not attribute these explanations to any bad motive on their
parts but rather on an understandable desire to defend a
colleague who they believe made ambiguous statements buy did not
do so in bad faith.<p>

     1102. Members of the U.S. Attorneys Office reject Harris'
argument that he relinquished a valuable right by consenting to
the continuance since, if Harris had withheld his consent, they
would have simply proceeded with preliminary hearing as
scheduled.  See, e.g., Lindquist Interview, Tape 1, at 30. This
argument, in our view, misses the mark and overlooks the negative
impact created by the U.S. Attorney making representatives and
then failing to honor them.<p><hr><P>                         Released through<p>

<H3>IV. SPECIFIC ISSUES INVESTIGATED</H3><p>
<H3> L. Scope of the Indictment and Alleged Prosecutorial Misconduct
Before the Grand Jury </H3><p>
 <H3> 1. Introduction</H3> <p>
  Following Weaver's surrender, the prosecution presented a
series of charges against him and Harris to a grand jury on
[G.J.]. An indictment was returned on September 16, charging
the defendants with the murder of Deputy Marshal Degan and with
an assault on Degan and Deputy Marshals Roderick and Cooper. 
[FN1103]<p>
  [G.J.], which returned a superseding indictment on
October 1 that included a broad charge of conspiracy by Weaver
and Harris. [FN1104]<p>
  [G.J.], which returned a second superseding indictment on
November 19, setting forth essentially the same charge contained
in the October 1 indictment. [FN1105]<p>
  On January 8, 1993, counsel for Weaver and Harris filed
pretrial motions to dismiss the superseding indictment, in part,
because of alleged prosecutorial misconduct that occurred during
the grand jury proceedings between September 16 and October 1. 
The defense claimed that Assistant U.S. Attorney Ronald Howen
made improper statements to the grand jury, which were the
equivalent of unsworn testimony, and that Howen had elicited
irrelevant and protracted testimony regarding the violent
criminal activities of white supremacist groups known as the
Aryan Nations, Order 1 and Order 2. Defense counsel asserted
that this evidence was introduced to inflame the grand jury and
prejudice it against Weaver and Harris. [FN1106]<p>
  Weaver's counsel also alleged at trial and to this
investigation that the conspiracy charged in Count 1 of both
superseding indictments was overly broad in that it covered a
period beginning in January 1983 and continuing through August
31, 1992. During this investigation, members of the FBI also
argued that the scope of the indictment was too broad and should
not have included the conspiracy count. Furthermore, defense
counsel claimed that the government brought certain charges in
the superseding indictments, for which there was no factual
basis. <p>
  In addition to these allegations, we have also considered
whether the prosecution improperly limited the scope of the
grand jury's investigation to crimes committed by Weaver and
Harris and precluded a broader inquiry into possible crimes
committed by law enforcement officers in the shooting of Vicki
Weaver. [FN1107] Finally we have examined the propriety of the 
decision of the government to seek the death penalty in the 
Weaver case. <p>
  <H3>2. Statement of Facts</H3> <p>
   <H4>a. Scope of the Indictment: The Conspiracy Count</H4>
Count 1 of both superseding indictments alleged the existence of
a wide-ranging conspiracy among "Randall C. Weaver, Vicki
Weaver, Kevin L. Harris and others known and unknown to the
Grand Jury, including some other members of the Weaver family,"
beginning from the time Weaver moved his family from Iowa to
Idaho in 1983 and continuing through Weaver's surrender to
authorities on August 31, 1992. The prosecution's theory was
that the Weavers and Harris had long planned a violent
confrontation with law enforcement, a plan that came to fruition
on August 21, 1992, when Harris killed Deputy Marshal Degan. 
[FN1108]<p>
  Weaver's counsel accused the prosecution of "engaging in
the 'demonizaiton'" of Randy Weaver by adding the conspiracy
count to the original indictment. Defense counsel alleged that
the conspiracy count was used to justify the introduction of
inflammatory and prejudicial evidence at trial. [FN1109]<p>
  Assistant U.S. Attorney Howen had prosecuted a number of
Aryan Nations and related cases and was well acquainted with the
racist beliefs, violent philosophy, and anti-government sentiments
held by those associated with such groups. [FN1110] Among
these groups were the Order 1 and the Order 2, which had carried
out a series of robberies and bombings in the Northwest in the
mid-1980s. [FN1111] Early in the Weaver investigation, Howen 
noticed similarities between the views expressed by the Weavers 
and those espoused by members of the Aryan Nations and the 
Orders. [FN1112] Howen learned that, in a 1983 newspaper 
interview, Weaver had discussed plans to move from Iowa to 
Northern Idaho to live in an isolated hideaway and "survive the 
coming 'great tribulation.'" The article stated that Weaver was 
"developing defense plans that include[d] a 300 yard 'kill zone' 
encircling [his] compound." [FN1113]<p>
  Howen decided to pattern the charges against Weaver and
Harris after indictments he had used in Aryan Nations cases.
[G.J.] [FN1114]<p>
 [G.J.] <p>
 [FN1115]<p>
  Assistant U.S. Attorney Lindquist, who helped Howen draft
the indictment, told this investigation that he and Howen knew
that they would have to address the death of Vicki Weaver in the
government's case. He reasoned that it would be strategically
wiser to acknowledge the events of August 22 forthrightly at
trial than to permit the defense to use the government's failure
to mention these events to their advantage with the jury. [FN1116]<p>
  Howen and Lindquist also feared that the trial court
would not allow the prosecution to introduce evidence of the
Weavers' past conduct to prove their intent to provoke a violent
confrontation with law enforcement officials, unless that
conduct was included in the indictment. [FN1117] They, therefore, 
sought to establish that Randy Weaver, his family, and Kevin 
Harris had formed a conspiracy to resist the U.S. Government 
and to assault government and to assault government agents and 
that the conspiracy began to take shape in Iowa as far back as 
1983. [FN1118]  The objects of the conspiracy were set forth in
the indictment:<p>
 1. To forcibly resist, oppose, impede, interfere with,
intimidate, assault and/or otherwise cause a violent
confrontation with law enforcement authorities in the engagement
in or on account of the performance of their official duties of
enforcing the laws of the United States. . . as to said Randall
C. Weaver, Vicki Weaver, Kevin L. Harris and others; <p>
 2. To purchase, develop and maintain a remote mountain
residence/stronghold; <p>
 3. To illegally and otherwise make, possess, sell and/or conceal
firearms and ammunition; <p>
 4. To fail to appear for trial on pending federal criminal
charges after orally and in writing agreeing to appear for trial
before a federal judge; <p>
 5. To hinder or prevent the discovery, apprehension, arrest and
trial of federal fugitives from justice; <p>
 6. To steal, conceal, retain and/or convert the personal
property of others to their own use; <p>
 7. To intimidate neighbors, as well as law enforcement officers
and agents, by the use, display, threat to use and/or discharge
of firearms; <p>
 8. To use, display, threaten to use, fire and/or discharge
firearms at or near human beings, vehicles and/or aircraft; and <p>
 9. To assault, shoot, wound, kill and/or murder, or threaten to
cause such to occur. . . by means of the use of deadly weapons.
. . . [FN1119]<p>
  The proposed conspiracy count initially listed 28 overt
acts, including the 1983 newspaper interview, the Weavers' move
to Idaho in 1983, the shooting death of Deputy Marshal Degan,
and an attempt to take offensive action against a helicopter,
which resulted in the death of Vicki Weaver. An additional 14
overt acts were added to the second superseding indictment. <p>
  The U.S. Attorney's Office in Idaho did not have a formal
review process for indictments. [FN1120] That office also did 
not require a prosecution memorandum for evaluating proposed
indictments. However, Howen did discuss the superseding
indictment with Ellsworth, who approved the conspiracy count. <p>
  Howen and Lindquist also discussed the proposed
conspiracy count with representatives of the Marshals Service,
BATF, the FBI, and the Department of Justice. They received
conflicting opinions as to the wisdom of including such a count. 
Henry Hudson, Director of the U.S. Marshals Service during the
Weaver/Harris prosecution, spent several hours reviewing the
indictment and believed that the conspiracy count detracted from
the most significant charge which was the murder of Deputy
Marshal Degan. [FN1121]<p>
 [GARRITY] <p>
 [FN1122] FBI case agents Venkus and Rampton also disagreed 
with the conspiracy theory. [FN1123]<p>
 [GARRITY] <p>
 [FN1124]<p>
  None of the counts charged in the indictment required
review or approval by the Department of Justice. Nonetheless,
Howen sought input from the Department. James Reynolds, Chief
of the Criminal Division's Terrorism and Violent Crimes Section,
and Deputy Section Chief Dana Biehl had reservations about the
manner in which the indictment had been drawn. However, since
DOJ had no supervisory control over the case, they did not seek
to impose their views on the prosecution. [FN1125]<p>
  <H4>b. Evidential Support for Certain Overt Acts and
Substantive Offenses</H4> <p>
  Defense counsel, both in pretrial motions and in an
interview with this inquiry, claimed that "a great majority" of
the overt acts alleged in the indictment as part of the
conspiracy count were without evidentiary support and should not
have been charged. [FN1126] The defense also complained that many
of the overt acts were not, in themselves, criminal or had no 
relation to the object of the conspiracy. <p>
  The defense asserted in pretrial motions that Count 1 of
the indictment, which charged a wide ranging conspiracy, forced
them to defend against "alleged crimes that are irrelevant to
the case." [FN1127] The overt acts challenged included those set 
forth in the following paragraphs of the second indictment: <p>
 7. On or about May 6, 1985, Randall C. Weaver and Vicki Weaver
mailed a letter addressed to the President of the United States
and the . . . United States Secret Service; . . . . <p>
 32. On or about April 18, 1992, Randall C. Weaver, Vicki Weaver,
or Kevin L. Harris shot at or near a helicopter and its
occupants; . . . . <p>
 36. On or about May 2, 1992, Randall C. Weaver and Kevin L.
Harris stole a video camera and other equipment, later
destroying it or converting it to their own use; . . . . <p>
 38. On or about August 3, 1992, Randall C. Weaver, Vicki Weaver,
Kevin L. Harris and/or some other members of the Weaver family
stole a water tank and pipe belonging to another; <p>
 39. On or about August 17, 1992, Kevin L. Harris and/or some
other members of the Weaver family attempted to enter a
residence occupied by another and took or attempted to take the
personal property of others; . . . . <p>
 41. On or about August 22, 1992, Randall C. Weaver or Kevin L.
Harris and an unidentified female, probably Vicki or Sara
Weaver, took offensive action against a helicopter and its
occupants, including attempting to shoot at the helicopter,
resulting in the death of Vicki Weaver and the wounding of Kevin
L. Harris and Randall C. Weaver. . . . [FN1128]<p>
  The defense also claimed that there was no evidence to
support the allegation that Randy Weaver shot Deputy Marshall
Degan on August 21, 1992 and fired at the other marshals. The
trial court adopted the finding of Magistrate Judge Boyle, who
ruled that the overt acts complained of were relevant to the
defendants' role in the conspiracy and that statements, acts,
and threats of violence against other bore upon issues such as
premeditation and malice. [FN1130]<p>
  The court dismissed Counts 6 and 8 on the defendants'
motion at the conclusion of the prosecution's case-in-chief. 
Count 6, which charged Weaver and Harris with assaulting federal
officers in a helicopter on August 22, 1992, was dismissed
because the court found no evidence that the officers knew of
the assault. The court considered this knowledge to be an
element of the offense. Count 8, which charged the receipt and
possession of firearms by a fugitive, was dismissed because the
court found no proof that Randy Weaver had travelled across
state lines, as is required by the statute under which the crime
had been charged. <p>
  <B>c. [G.J.] </B><p>
  [Editor's Note: Pages 334-355 were omitted, which included 
  footnotes 1131 to 1174.]<p>
 f. Decision to Seek the Death Penalty <p>
  Count 5 of the second superseding indictment charged
Randy Weaver and Kevin Harris with the murder of Deputy U.S.
Marshal William Degan while he was "engaged in or on account of
the performance of his official duties." [FN1176] Section 1111 
of Title 18, provides for a sentence of death or life imprisonment
upon conviction for the murder of a federal officer. <p>
  Department of Justice policy requires the approval of the
Department's Criminal Division before a U.S. Attorney may
recommend application of the death penalty. [FN1177] Although the
prosecution did not request permission to try the Weaver matter
as a capital case for several months, the trial court considered
it a potential death-penalty case from the time the first
indictment was returned charging Weaver and Harris with Degan's
murder. The Court advised both defendants at their arraignments
that the maximum penalty for conviction on that count was death
and, as a consequence, gave them additional appointed counsel, 
increased the compensation given to counsel, and provided for
additional investigative expenses. [FN1178]<p>
  On January 8, 1993, the defense filed a motion claiming
that the possible penalties for Count 5 could not, under the
Constitution, include the death penalty. The defense argued
that the capital punishment provision of 18 U.S.C. 1111 had
been invalidated by virtue of the Supreme Court's decision in
Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S. 238 (1972) and subsequent rulings by
the Ninth Circuit. [FN1179] The prosecution responded that the 
capital provision of section 1111 was still viable and that the 
Court could fashion standards for its application that met the
requirements of Furman. [FN1180] The prosecution's response 
recognized that this position had been rejected by the Fifth 
Circuit and by the District of Alaska. [FN1181]<p>
  While the decision on the defense motion was pending,
U.S. Attorney Ellsworth applied to the Terrorism and Violent
Crime Section of the Criminal Division of the Department of
Justice for authorization to seek the death penalty. As
justification for the request, Ellsworth wrote: <p>
 [T]he mutual premeditation [of Weaver and Harris], founded in
racial bigotry and baseless hatred for authority, is cold and
heinous in its direction at law enforcement. . . . The death of
[Deputy Marshal] Degan was the direct and planned result of
Weaver's selfish and monstrous proclamation that "[t]he tyrant's
blood will flow." His legal and moral accountability fully
supports imposition of the death penalty. [FN1182]<p>
  The Terrorism and Violent Crimes Section recommended
against Ellsworth's request because it did not think that the
death penalty would survive a constitutional challenge under the
statute. James Reynolds, Chief of the Terrorism and Violent
Crimes Section, also had doubts about the seriousness of the
U.S. Attorney's request. [FN1183]<p>
   The application was transmitted to Associate
Deputy Attorney General David Margolis, who believed that the
killing of a federal law enforcement officer warranted the death
penalty and that the penalty was constitutional as applied under
the statute. However, he also shared Reynolds' reservations
about the seriousness of the U.S. Attorney's intentions and
thought it was possible the U.S. Attorney was "going through the
motions." [FN1184] Margolis then telephoned Ellsworth and spoke 
with him and Assistant U.S. Attorney Howen. They assured Margolis 
that the case was sound and that they were seriously pursuing the
death penalty in this matter. [FN1185]<p>
  Thereafter, Margolis discussed the matter with Deputy
Assistant Attorney General John C. Keeney. Both men were swayed
by the serious nature of the charge, and they decided to approve
the request to seek the death penalty. [FN1186] In making the 
decision, Margolis recognized that guilt would have to be 
proven beyond a reasonable doubt before the death penalty could 
be invoked. [FN1187] Ellsworth was given formal permission to 
seek the death penalty through a letter from the Acting Attorney 
General. [FN1188]<p>
  Shortly thereafter, on February 26, 1993, the trial court
issued an order adopting the defense's position that the death
penalty provision of 18 U.S.C. 1111 was void under Furman and
Ninth Circuit precedent. [FN1189]<p>
  <H3>3. Discussion</H3> <p>
   <H4>a. Scope of the Indictment: The Conspiracy Count</H4> <p>
  It would be illogical and unfair to infer from the trial
jury's verdict of acquittal on the conspiracy count that the
prosecution's theory was wholly unfounded or wrongfully
contrived. We have found no evidence that the prosecution acted
without a good faith belief that sufficient proof existed to
support the conspiracy charge, notwithstanding the often harsh
accusations made by the defense before and during trial. That
does not mean, however, that it was prudent to extend the scope
of the conspiracy to 1983. <p>
  Howen and Lindquist were concerned that, without a
conspiracy charge, they would not be permitted to introduce
evidence of the Weavers' past statements and conduct to explain
the events leading up to the shooting on August 21, 1992. Count
2 of the indictment charged that the earliest substantive
offense committed by Weaver, the sale of two sawed-off shotguns,
occurred in October 1989. The BATF informant involved in that
transaction first met Weaver at the World Aryan Congress in
1986, and there were tape recordings of conversations involving
Weaver and the informant beginning in January 1987. Evidence of
the circumstances under which the informant met Weaver would
almost certainly be admitted, even without a conspiracy charge,
especially since the defense claimed that Weaver had been
entrapped into making the sales. Likewise, letters and
statements following Weaver's arrest on the weapons charge in
January 1991 showing that Weaver would not submit to authorities
would have been admissible with regard to Count 3, which
charged Weaver with failure to appear for trial. <p>
  On the other hand, by describing the conspiracy as
beginning in 1983, the prosecution was able to introduce
evidence of the interview, in which Weaver discussed plans to
move from Iowa to Northern Idaho and develop a "300 yard 'kill
zone'" around his house. This was a key element of the
conspiracy theory. <p>
  Many of the criticisms of the conspiracy theory are
legitimate. For instance, <p>
  [G.J.] <p>
  [FN1190]<p>
  [G.J.] However, at trial, the defense effectively
attacked the theory, claiming that the Government was trying to
"demonize" Weaver by charging that everything he did proved that
he hated the Government. [FN1191] Allegations that acts such as 
moving to Idaho and building a cabin were proof of a conspiracy 
clearly had the capacity to distract the trial jury from the 
killing of Deputy Marshal Degan. <p>
  As for the defense claim that many of the overt acts
charged in the conspiracy count were without evidential support,
the magistrate denied the defense motion to dismiss the
indictment after considering whether the allegations about which
the defense had complained were "relevant to the charge
contained in the indictment and [were] inflammatory and
prejudicial." [FN1192] We have made the same inquiry. <p>
  Overt Act 7 refers to two letters written by Randy and
Vicki Weaver on May 6, 1985, [FN1193] which allegedly contain 
threats made by Randy Weaver against former President Reagan. 
Deputy Boundary County Sheriff Ekstrom testified that the U.S. 
Secret Service had investigated Randy Weaver in February 1985. 
Shortly thereafter, on February 28, 1985, the Weavers filed a
handwritten affidavit with the Boundary County Clerk, claiming
that certain persons were conspiring to place Weaver and his
family in danger and to precipitate an attack on his life. The
affidavit alleged that his "accusers" made false statements
about his connections with the Aryan Nations, his ownership of
illegal weapons, and threats he allegedly made against the
President and the Pope. Weaver wrote that the plot was designed
to provoke the FBI into storming his home. He also expressed
the fear that he would be killed or arrested for assaulting a
federal officer, if he tried to defend himself. The affidavit
stated: "I make legal and official notice that I believe I may
have to defend myself and my family from physical attack on my
life."  [FN1194]<p>
  We agree that the Secret Service investigation and the
February 1985 affidavit were relevant to whether Weaver planned
a violent confrontation with law enforcement. However, we do
not believe that the letters written in May 1985 were relevant
to the issue. One letter was an apology to President Reagan, in
which Weaver claimed that his neighbors had sent the President a
threatening letter under his name. The other letter demanded a
written apology from the Secret Service for falsely accusing him
of making the threats. [FN1195] Neither letter appears to have 
furthered the overall conspiracy. <p>
  Overt Act 32 alleged that a helicopter with a television
crew had been shot at as it flew near the Weaver residence. 
When the first superseding indictment was presented to the grand
jury, the prosecution had evidence that no shots had been fired
at the helicopter. [FN1196]<p>
  [G.J.] <p>
 [FN1197]  The failure of the prosecution to do either is
significant. The justification given by the FBI sniper for
shooting at Randy Weaver on August 22, 1992 was that he believed
that Weaver and Harris were preparing to shoot at an FBI 
helicopter flying nearby. [FN1198] Evidence that Weaver and 
Harris had fired at a helicopter earlier would certainly have 
tended to bolster the sniper's testimony. The grand jury was 
entitled to a balanced view of the alleged incident. <p>
  [G.J.] <p>
  [FN1199]<p>
  [G.J.] <p>
[FN1200] We find that this evidence was pertinent to at least one
of the objectives of the unlawful agreement alleged in the
conspiracy count: "hinder[ing] or prevent[ing] the discovery,
apprehension, arrest and trial of federal fugitives from
justice." Overt Act 36 was thus properly included in the
indictment. <p>
  We also conclude there was adequate evidence to support
the inclusion of Overt Acts 38 and 39, which alleged the theft
of property belonging to the Rau family. <p>
 [FN1201]<p>
 [G.J.]<p>
 [FN1202]<p>
 [FN1203]<p>
  As noted above, one of the objectives of the unlawful
agreement alleged in the conspiracy count was "[t]o steal,
conceal, retain and/or convert the personal property of others." 
Evidence regarding the theft of the Raus' property bore on that
allegation. [FN1204] Moreover, the Weavers' harassment of the 
Raus was a factor in the marshals' decision to resume 
surveillance of the Weaver property in August 1992. It was not 
improper to include these allegations in the indictment. <p>
  In regard to the charge in Overt Act 41 that Randy
Weaver, Kevin Harris, "and an unidentified female, probably
Vicki or Sara Weaver" attempted to shoot at an FBI helicopter,
Special Agent Hoiruchi testified that he saw three persons run
out of the Weaver cabin upon hearing the helicopter, one of whom
he identified as Kevin Harris. [G.J.] The prosecution knew full
well when Overt Act 41 was drafted that Vicki Weaver had been
killed while holding open the door of the cabin for the three
persons who had responded to the helicopter, one of whom was a
female. Even though Horiuchi could not identify the female, the
prosecution had abundant evidence that Vicki Weaver had not run
outside. Naming Vicki Weaver as one of the people who might
have responded to the helicopter could readily be interpreted as
an attempt to assert that Horiuchi was justified in shooting
her. It was careless and wrong for the indictment to charge
than "an unidentified female, probably Vicki or Sara Weaver"
took offensive action against the helicopter. [FN1205]<p>
  The prosecution never contended that Randy Weaver shot
Degan, but it did assert that Weaver, Harris, and the other
family members engaged in joint criminal activity that included
murder, conspiracy, and assault on the marshals. <p>
  [FN1206]<p>
  [G.J.] <p>
  [FN1207]<p>
  Although Overt Act 40 does not specifically state that
Weaver was being charged as an aider and abetter, the section of
the conspiracy count defining the roles of the participants
states that Weaver "committed the crimes of aiding and abetting
murder and attempted murder." [FN1208] Count 5, which corresponds 
with Overt Act 40, also alleges that "Kevin L. Harris, as aided,
counseled, induced or procured by Randall C. Weaver . . . did .
. . shoot, kill and murder one William F. Degan. . . ." It is
also evident that Weaver was charged as an aider and abetter in
Count 5 with respect to shots fired at the other marshals during
the confrontation at the Y. <p>
  [G.J.] <p>
  [FN1209]<p>
  We believe that several of the overt acts discussed above
should not have been included in the indictment. This appears
to have been the result of overzealousness, or perhaps poor
judgment, but not malice, on the part of the prosecution. 
However, the allegation that Randy Weaver was the moving force
behind the violent confrontation that caused Kevin Harris to
shoot at the four marshals, killing William Degan, was amply
supported by evidence presented to the grand jury. <p>
  We have found no intent of behalf of the prosecution to
charge Counts 6 and 8 knowing there was insufficient proof of
the elements of those offenses. Howen acknowledged to this
inquiry that a more thorough researching of these statutes would
have spared the government judicial dismissal of the counts. 
[FN1210] However, we find no impropriety in the charging of these 
counts. [FN1211] The conspiracy theory presented by the prosecution 
undoubtedly had the capacity to distract the trial jury from the 
killing of Deputy Marshal Degan. That is not to say that the 
prosecutors would have avoided acquittals by charging the case 
differently. The defense focused heavily on the arguments that 
Randy Weaver had been entrapped into making the weapons sale to 
the BATF informant, that firing at the marshals was an act of self
defense, and that there was no justification for the shooting of
Sammy and Vicki Weaver. We cannot assume that this approach
would have failed, had the case been prosecuted solely on the
murder charge and a few other substantive offenses. The case
would be difficult, no matter how it was charged. <p>
  We believe that some of the prosecution's difficulties
could have been avoided by a more formal review of the
indictment within the U.S. Attorney's office. The conspiracy
theory was not seriously tested until after the indictment had
been returned. In a case of this complexity, it would have been
advisable for the office to have a written prosecution
memorandum for discussion before seeking an indictment. <p>
  <H4>b. [G.J.]</H4> <p>
  [Editor's Note: Footnotes 1212 to 1217 were omitted here as 
were pages 366 to 367.]<p>
  It is not improper for a prosecutor to express an opinion
as to the merits of the case "as long as it is clear to the jury
that the opinion is based only on the evidence that is before
the jury and the jury itself can evaluate." [FN1219] We have found
certain instances when Howen's comments went beyond explanation
or summaries of the evidence and bordered on statements of
personal knowledge. Howen's questioning of [G.J.] <p>
  [G.J.]<p>

  [FN1224]<p>
  [FN1225]<p>
  Prosecutors are accorded wide latitude in presenting
their cases to the grand jury. [FN1226] However, although the 
prosecutor "properly has wide discretion in grand jury 
proceedings . . .this discretion is not boundless." [FN1227]<p>
  The Department of Justice has set forth general standards
of conduct for prosecutors before the grand jury: <p>
 In his/her dealings with the grand jury, the prosecutor must
always conduct himself/herself as an officer of the court whose
function is to insure that justice is done and that guilt shall
not escape nor innocence suffer. He/she must recognize that the
grand jury is an independent body, whose functions include not
only the investigation of crime and the initiation of criminal
prosecution but also the protection of the citizenry from
unfounded criminal charges. The prosecutor's responsibility is
to advise the grand jury on the law and to present evidence for
its consideration. In discharging these responsibilities,
he/she must be scrupulously fair to all witnesses and must do
nothing to inflame or otherwise improperly influence the grand
jurors. [FN1228]<p>
  The court's pretrial ruling that there was no misconduct
regarding the presentation of evidence concerning the Aryan
Nations and the Order is not conclusive for purposes of this
inquiry. We agree, [G.J.] that some background on [G.J.] was
important to put in context the tape recordings of Weaver and
the BATF informant and to define words and phrases used in those
conversations. [FN1229] Howen had been permitted to introduce 
similar evidence in past Aryan Nations prosecutions, and those 
convictions had been affirmed on appeal. [FN1230] We also 
recognize the need to clarify Vicki Weaver's citation to 
"Mathews" in a letter to the U.S. Attorney. However, we believe 
that the volume of evidence presented [G.J.] went beyond that 
which was necessary to accomplish those goals. [FN1231] For 
instance, [G.J.] <p>
  Other examples of problematic testimony abound. <p>
  [G.J.] [FN1232] Unless it is relevant to the offenses under the
investigation, comments linking the accused to a criminal class
are also inappropriate. [FN1234] It is generally improper to 
elicit testimony deliberately on irrelevant and prejudicial 
matters. [FN1234]<p>
  [G.J.] <p>
  Such expressions serve no legitimate purpose, other than
to suggest to the grand jurors that the prosecutor, as an expert
in cases like the one before them, should be accorded particular
credibility. That is not a fitting posture for a prosecutor to
assume. <p>
  [G.J.] <p>
  [FN1235]<p>
  [FN1236]<p>
  [FN1237]<p>
  <H4>c. [G.J.]</H4> <p>
  The United States Attorneys' Manual provides that the
prosecutor is "to advise the grand jury on the law and to
present evidence for its consideration." [FN1238] Instructions 
on the law must be accurate and not deliberately misleading. 
[FN1239] Although an indictment returned "by a legally 
constituted and unbiased grand jury" is presumed valid, [FN1240] 
an indictment may be subject to challenge, if the prosecutor's 
instructions are so flagrantly erroneous that the grand jury is 
deceived in some significant way. [FN1241]<p>
  [G.J.] <p>
  [FN1242]<p>
  [G.J.] <p>
  [FN1243]<p>
  [G.J.]<p>
  [FN1244]<p>
  [FN1245]<p>
 Rather, we attribute this failure in part to an institutional
weakness existing between the USAO and the FBI. The prosecutors
knew that the FBI had conducted an internal inquiry into the
shooting and that the FBI had concluded that the shooting was
within established rules and regulations. Such findings are
not, as a routine matter, subject to examination by prosecutors
or persons outside the FBI. Thus, the FBI considered the issue
closed and resisted any act or inquiry which could be
interpreted as challenging the actions of the HRT. Indeed, we
have found that the FBI frustrated the prosecutors' efforts to
interview FBI headquarters witnesses, [G.J.], and withheld
documents relating to the shootings, including the shooting
incident report. This created an environment in which the USAO
was unlikely to even contemplate the HRT members being subjects
of a criminal investigation especially since the USAO believed
that the shooting incident had already been examined in an
administrative review of the incident. <p>
 <H4>d. Decision to Seek the Death Penalty </H4><p>
  Finally, regarding the decision to seek the death
penalty, Ellsworth and Howen were aware that case law in the
Ninth Circuit did not support the application of the death
penalty in circumstances such as those presented by the
Weaver/Harris case. [FN1246] The prosecution chose to proceed 
based on arguments raised by the Department of Justice in an 
appeal then pending before the Ninth Circuit. [FN1247] We do 
not fault the prosecution for adopting the Department's legal 
theory and seeking a ruling from the trial court based on that 
theory. <p>
  We do, however, share the misgivings expressed by some
members of the Department of Justice as to whether this was
factually an appropriate case for imposition of the death
penalty. [FN1248] Keeney and Margolis appear to have deferred to 
the Ellsworth and Howen's representations about the strength of 
the proof in the case. [FN1249] Ellsworth and Howen assured them 
and this investigation that they were serious and wanted to 
proceed with the request. [FN1250]<p>
  There is no evidence to dispute the good faith of the prosecution 
in making the application to seek the death penalty. [FN1251]
We are not convinced, though, that the confidence expressed by
the U.S. Attorney's Office that this case presented a good set
of facts to test the viability of the death penalty in Idaho was
justified. <p>
  <H3>4. Conclusion</H3> <p>
  We share many of the reservations about the scope of the
conspiracy count expressed by members of the Marshals Service
and the FBI. Although we did not find that the prosecutors
charged Weaver and Harris in bad faith, we believe that their
judgments were not always as thoughtful and well reasoned as
they should have been. <p>
  [G.J.] <p>
  [FN1252]<p>
  Finally, the decision to seek the death penalty may be
viewed as overarching by the prosecution. <p><hr><P>  Released through<p> COUNSEL

at Director Hudson, a former U.S. Attorney for the Eastern

kept as simple as possible because a more narrow indictment would
prohibit the defendants from bringing in extraneous information. 
He said that, if he has been the U.S. Attorney, he would not have
authorized such a broadly drawn indictment.  The marshals
assigned as case agents for the prosecution, however, were more
supportive of the conspiracy charge.  Sworn Statement of John
Stafford, October 20, 1993, at 8-9; Sworn Statement of Robert
Masaitis, October 20, 1993, at 17.  Special Agent Herb Byerly,

verdict, which could have been based on various factors,
conclusive of our inquiry.<p>
     1127. Weaver's counsel initially raised this issue in a
Motion to Strike Surplusage contained in the Superseding

federal offenses and should be stricken.  Memorandum in Support
of Motion to Strike Surplusage November 13, 1992, at 8-9.  That
motion was referred to U.S. Magistrate Judge Larry M. Boyle, who
agreed that certain language should be stricken from the

which constituted nonfederal crimes, be stricken.  Order, Report

     1180. Furman requires that 1) the sanction of death be
proportionate to the crime; 2) the sentencing scheme narrow the
class of persons eligible for the death penalty and reasonably
justify the imposition of a more severe sentence on the defendant
compared to others found guilty of murder, and 3) the sentencer
be allowed to consider all evidence that tends to mitigate moral
culpability and militate against a sentence of death.  See Zant

that those made by the Department of Justice in its brief

that the helicopter had not taken fire.  A photographer in the
helicopter saw someone gesture at the helicopter and thought he
heard two shots on a boom microphone.  FD-302 Interview of Dave

     1205. We reject the assertion that Vicki Weaver aided and
abetted offensive action against the helicopter by hoding the
door open.  From Horuichi's testimony, it is clear that the
threat to the helicopter had ceased by the time Randy and Sara
Weaver and Harris ran to the cabin.  The overt act alleges that

Order shooting "a talk [show] host" and noted that there would
soon be a change in leadership within the Order, that the Order
was passing "funny money," and that a lot of people in the
"movement" were "facing 100 year [jail] sentences."  Transcript

847.  However the trial court had not permitted Howen to offer
"in depth explanations of objectionable terms that came up during

<H3>IV. SPECIFIC ISSUES INVESTIGATED</H3><p>
  <H3>M. Alleged Problems with the FBI's Participation and
Cooperation in the Discovery Process</H3> <p>
  <H3>1. Introduction</H3> <p>
  From the beginning of its preparation of the Weaver case
for trial, it was always the intent of the U.S. Attorney's
Office in Boise, Idaho ("USAO") to provide discovery to the defense
in accordance with a modified open discovery policy. [FN1253]
This discovery policy together with the scope and breadth of the
indictment created concern among members of the FBI including
those at FBI headquarters. [FN1254] Such concern contributed to a
resistance by the FBI to produce certain materials that the USAO
deemed pertinent to the case but which the FBI believed were
either irrelevant to what it perceived to be the real issues in
the case or too sensitive to be disclosed. In addition, some
believed that the failure of the FBI laboratory to process
materials and to conduct tests in a timely fashion further
impaired the ability of the USAO to respond to the discovery
demands of the Weaver case. [FN1255] A final discovery problem 
surfaced during trial when the FBI produced, in response to a 
defense subpoena, additional documents related to the FBI shooting
incident report which the USAO maintained it had requested in
discovery throughout the pretrial period. It has been alleged
that these problems and the delays and embarrassment that
resulted were unnecessary and adversely affected the Weaver
case. <p>
  <H3>2. Statement of Facts</H3> <p>
  <H4>a. Defining the Scope of Discovery</H4> <p>
  Immediately after Harris and Weaver surrendered to law
enforcement authorities, the USAO began preparing the case for
indictment and trial. Important components of this process
included taking steps to insure that evidence was located and
preserved and developing a discovery strategy. [FN1256] Due to 
the intense media interest in the Weaver case coupled with the
defense allegations that law enforcement personnel had acted
unlawfully and that government officials were participating in a
coverup, members of the USAO decided to adopt a modified open
discovery policy. [FN1257] Such a discovery policy was consistent
with the USAO practice in handling other cases in their district. <p>
  On October 16, the USAO and defense counsel entered into
an agreement captioned "Stipulation and Reciprocal Request for
Discovery and Inspection, Notice of Alibi and Notice of Mental
Condition" which set forth the discovery obligations of the
parties. Pursuant to the terms of the stipulation, the parties
were to provide the reciprocal disclosure of the materials
stated in Rule 16(a)(1) and 16(b)(1) and the "reciprocal pre-
trial disclosure and inspection of Jencks Act (18 U.S.C. 3500)
materials, Rule 26.2, F.R. Crim. P materials and transcripts of
testimony and exhibits presented to the Grand Jury." [FN1258] It 
was further agreed that "rough notes [were] generally not Jencks or
Rule 26.2 materials unless they [were] a substantially verbatim
recital of the trial or intended trial witness' oral statement
or seen, signed or otherwise adopted by the witness' oral statement, 
or seen, signed, or otherwise adopted by the witness . . ." 
[FN1259] The stipulation added that "in the exchange of Jencks or
Rule 26.2 materials including rough notes, the parties [were]
authorized to redact information from those materials as
permitted by case law, statute or rule, including but not
limited to . . . information directly or indirectly relating to
equipment, tactics and strategies of investigation, apprehension
or arrest and case preparation. Such redaction [was to] be
subject to in camera inspection by the Court upon written motion
or objection of a party." [FN1260] With regard to the timing of
discovery the stipulation stated that, "[i]t is the intention of
the parties to accelerate the time table for discovery and
inspection to a time significantly in advance of trial so that
all pre-trial motions are fully and promptly made and ruled on,
so that trial preparation is completed in advance of trial, so
that unjustifiable delay and expense are eliminated which may
result from literal application of the statutes and rules, and
so that a fair, just and truthful determination of the charges
pending against the defendants may be resolved consistent with
the security concerns of the Court, the parties, defendants and
prospective witnesses. . . . The parties further stipulate[d]
and agree[d] to file a written response to [the] stipulation on
or before October 23, 1992, and on a continuing basis thereafter
pursuant to Rules 12.1(c), 12.2 (a) and (b) and 16 (c), F.R.
Crim. P." [FN1261]<p>
  A week after signing of the stipulation, the government
provided its initial discovery response. [FN1262] The government
continued to provide material during the pretrial period and
into the trial. Indeed, the government filed multiple addenda
summarizing the huge volume of materials that had been produced
to the defense, including video tapes, audio tapes,
investigative reports, laboratory reports and thousands of pages
of documents. <p>
  Much of the material that the government produced in
discovery originated from the FBI and was produced on a timely
basis. However, questions have been raised as to whether
actions by the FBI impeded the discovery process. In
particular, allegations have been made that the FBI failed to
cooperate with allegations have been made that the FBI failed to
cooperate with the USAO in meeting its discovery obligations and
unjustifiably resisted producing certain documents. These
actions are alleged to have impacted adversely on the
prosecution of the Weaver case. <p>
  <H4>b. The FBI Response to Discovery Demands </H4><p>
  From his very first communications with Special Agent in
Charge Eugena Glenn on September 3, 1992, [FN1263] U.S. Attorney
Ellsworth made it clear that it was important for the FBI to
preserve and produce a broad range of documents that would be
pertinent to discovery and trial. Ellsworth and Assistant U.S.
Attorney Ronald Howen, who was primarily responsible for the
discovery matters in the Weaver prosecution, strongly believed
that a complete production of relevant materials [FN1264] was 
critical to defend against the charge of a government coverup. 
Throughout the pretrial period members of the USAO repeatedly 
requested the FBI to produce all pertinent materials and 
requested an opportunity to review all the relevant files at FBI
headquarters. <p>
  According to Supervisory Special Agent T. Michael Dillon,
most of the conversations with the USAO concerning discovery
occurred between the FBI case agents -- Special Agents Joseph
Venkus and Gregory Rampton -- and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Howen
and Kim Lindquist. Rampton and Venkus passed these discovery
requests to Dillon, who relayed them to FBI Headquarters. 
Dillon told investigators that from the beginning of the Weaver
case he was required to make frequent phone calls to FBI
Headquarters in an attempt to assist in the release of discovery
materials. He stated that most of his contacts were with Gale
Evans of the Violent Crimes Unit of the Criminal Investigative
Division ("CID") although he did recall at least one phone
conversation with Section Chief Michael Kahoe. [FN1266]<p>
  It is normal FBI practice for the Principal Legal Advisor
at the Field Division level to handle discovery requests since
they usually have access to the requested materials. [FN1267] 
In this case, however, the Boise Resident Agency produced those
materials over which they had access and then coordinated with
FBI headquarters regarding the other materials that were housed
or controlled there. [FN1268]<p>
  [GARRITY] <p>
  [FN1269]<p>
  [FN1270]<p>
  The first discovery conflict surfaced on September 23,
1992, when Lindquist travelled with Rampton to Quantico,
Virginia to meet with Assistant Special Agent in Charge Richard
Rogers to discuss the actions of the Hostage Rescue Team
("HRT"). While at Quantico they met with special agent Lester
Hazen who showed them a copy of the operations plan drafted for
the HRT during the Ruby Ridge crisis. When Lindquist requested
a copy of the operations plan Rogers responded that the
operations plan had never been approved and he did not want to
produce the document to Lindquist because it contained sensitive
information. Finding this position unacceptable, Lindquist is
reported to have told Rogers that he would obtain a court order
that would permit him to have access to the operations plan. 
Because it appeared that neither Rogers nor Lindquist were
willing to compromise, Rampton suggested that Lindquist be able
to review the report but not be given a copy of it. If the
court requested the information later, Rampton proposed that the
parties could negotiate further about the release of the
information. Rampton reported that Lindquist and Rogers acceded
to this compromise. [FN1271]<p>
  Rogers also informed Lindquist and Rampton that all of
the HRT members had prepared signed sworn statements as part of
an internal shooting review conducted by the Inspection Division
of the FBI. When Rampton requested these statements, Rogers
told him that he did not have the authority to release them and
instructed Rampton to contact the Inspection Division. Later
Rampton spoke with Paul Philip, the Deputy Assistant Director of
the Inspection Division about obtaining these statements. [FN1272]
Rampton recalled that Philip contacted Dave Binney who told him
that the signed statements could be given to Lindquist. Thereafter,
Rampton informed Rogers of the authorization, obtained the sworn 
statements from the HRT members, attached a cover 302 and produced 
them to Lindquist. [FN1273] Lindquist recalls that he reviewed 
these statements on this trip but that he never was given access 
to the entire shooting incident report. [FN1274]<p>

  [FN1280]<p>
 <H4>c. Attempts to Resolve the Discovery Disputes</H4> <p>
  Unable to resolve its disagreement with the FBI regarding
these documents, both the USAO and the FBI sought the assistance
of the Terrorism and Violent Crime Section ("TVCS") of the
Criminal Division of the Department of Justice in Washington,
D.C. The initial disagreement between the USAO and the FBI
focused on a relatively small number of documents. The most
significant documents in this group were the September 30, 1992
shooting incident report; the November 9, 1992 shooting incident
Review Group memorandum; the FBI operations plan and annex; and,
later, the FBI critique of the U.S. Marshals Service. <p>
  [FN1281]<p>
  [GARRITY] <p>
  [FN1282]<p>
  [GARRITY] <p>
 (1) Documents at Issue <p>
  The first document at issue was the shooting incident
report dated September 30, 1992. That document was a report
prepared by a shooting incident review team of the Inspection
Division of the FBI and represented the findings of an
administrative inquiry into the August 22, 1992 shootings by the 
HRT at Ruby Ridge which resulted in the death of Vicki Weaver and
the injuries to Kevin Harris and Randy Weaver. [FN1283] It 
consisted of: a 5-page cover memo with findings from Inspector 
Thomas W. Miller dated September 30, 1992; the statements of the HRT
members some of which were signed sworn statements and others
which were in the form of a FD-302; [FN1284] autopsy reports of 
the three individuals killed at Ruby Ridge; a statement of the 
prospective status of the subjects; crime scene photographs and 
diagrams; and news clippings. The notes of the investigators who
conducted the interviews of the HRT members were not included as
part of the report. <p>
  The shooting incident report had been forwarded to the
Shooting Incident Review Group ("Review Group") which reviewed
it to determine if any administrative action was warranted
against any FBI employee involved in the shootings. After
analyzing the report, the Review Group prepared a four-page
memorandum articulating its views as to whether administrative
action was appropriate. In this memorandum dated November 9,
1992, the Review Group concluded that the actions taken were
lawful and within FBI rules and procedures and thus no
administrative action was necessary. This memorandum was
attached to the September 30, 1992 report and forwarded to
Steven Pomerantz, the Assistant Director of the Administrative
Services Division. <p>
  [GARRITY] <p>
  Although the FBI had produced in discovery most of the FD-302
statements of those interviewed in the internal investigation,
it was unwilling to produce the entire shooting incident report
because it was an internal document that had never previously
been produced in discovery. <p>
  [GARRITY] <p>
  [FN1285]<p>
  [GARRITY] <p>
  [FN1286]<p>
  Another document at issue was the operational plan and annex
which set forth the initial strategy contemplated for the
operational plan to be used at Ruby Ridge. [FN1287] Components of 
this plan included controlling the crisis site through the deployment
of sniper/observers followed by establishing communications with
Weaver and others in the cabin. <p>
  [GARRITY] <p>
  [FN1288]<p>
  [GARRITY] <p>
  [FN1289]<p>
  The third document that the FBI did not want to produce in
discovery has been referred to as the "marshals critique." [FN1290] 
This is a two page document containing 12 critical observations of
the actions of the Marshals Service at Ruby Ridge. These
observations are supposed to be based on interviews of members
of the Marshals Service and the HRT. Special Agent Venkus and
Assistant U.S. Attorney Lindquist first learned of this document
on December 1, 1992 when they traveled to Washington, D.C. to
review the FBI headquarters file and to talk with HRT members.
Venkus made a copy of the critique and took it back to the FBI
office in Boise where Venkus gave Lindquist access to it under
the condition that it be returned. [FN1291]<p>
  Because of the critical nature of the critique, the Bureau
resisted its disclosure. <p>
inappropriate because it [GARRITY] [FN1292] Dillon reportedly told
Deputy Marshal Masaitis that he would rather see a mistrial than
produce the marshals critique in discovery. [FN1293] When Lindquist 
tried to explain to Dillon the serious repercussions that would 
occur if the government failed to produce the critique in discovery
but later produced it in response to a Freedom of Information
Act request, Dillon responded that the document had come from
someone's desk and was not in any official file that would be
searched for a FOIA. request. From Dillon's comments, Lindquist
was concerned that someone from the Bureau might be
contemplating destroying the document so that it would not have
to be produced. Lindquist advised strenuously against such
action. [FN1294]<p>
  (2) Negotiations Among the Parties <p>
  Due to the complaints received from the USAO and the FBI,
attorneys from the Terrorism and Violent Crime Section of the
Department of Justice contacted FBI officials in an attempt to
solve the impasse. [FN1295]<p>
  [GARRITY] <p>
  [FN1296]<p>
  With the arrival of 1993, the USAO and FBI could still not
agree on what documents needed to be produced in discovery. On
January 4, Howen and Lindquist met with the FBI case agents and
repeated their request for all pertinent documents at FBI 
Headquarters, including the shooting incident report. [FN1297] 
On January 6, Howen sent a letter to Glenn in which he formally 
repeated his earlier requests for all pertinent materials from FBI
headquarters and elsewhere, including files, reports, documents,
that they had not previously received. Howen then wrote, "[i]n
other words, we want access to everything." Howen also requested
a copy of "[t]he administrative file concerning the review of
the HRT sniper shooting on August 22, 1992 . . . but not limited
to, the shooting reports, the names and phone numbers of the
agents who participated in the preparation of the report, any
diagrams or charts of angles, including a preliminary diagram
that showed the sniper shot directly into the house, and any
other document or papers" and "[a]ny other documents or reports
of any evaluations or critiques of the actions of . . . the HRT
team on August 22-31, 1992." [FN1298] Copies of this letter were 
sent to James Reynolds and Michael Dillon. <p>
  Later that same day, U.S. Attorney Ellsworth called James
Reynolds, Chief of the Terrorism and Violent Crime Section of
the Criminal Division of DOJ, and complained that the local FBI
was refusing to produce documents needed in the Weaver case.
Although a number of documents were involved involved, Ellsworth
identified the most critical ones as being the shooting incident
report and the HRT operations plan. Following his conversation
with Ellsworth, Reynolds arranged a meeting for the next day at
the Department of Justice with FBI officials to discuss the
discovery dispute. [FN1299]<p>
  The first meeting was held on January 7. Attending the meeting
on behalf of the Department were Deputy Assistant Attorney
General Mark Richard who chaired the meeting, Reynolds, and
Deputy Section Chiefs Dana Biehl and Mary Incontro; attending
the meeting on behalf of the FBI were Danny Coulson and Mike
Kahoe, the Chairman of the Shooting Incident Review Group. At
the meeting the participants focused on the scope of the
indictment and the specific documents that the FBI did not want
to produce. The FBI maintained that the indictment was too broad
and should have been limited to the death of Deputy Marshal
Degan on August 21. The FBI argued that a more narrowly drafted
indictment would have eliminated the need to produce the
documents at issue. [FN1300] Richard, who opined that it was much
too late to shift the government's theory of the case, agreed with
Reynolds that a more narrow indictment would not have shielded
the documents from production. [FN1301]<p>
  With regard to the documents at issue, Coulson articulated his
concern that the operations plan had never been approved and
that if the operations plan were to be released it would
disclose HRT operational secrets. As a compromise, Coulson
offered to allow the prosecutors to view the operations plan
after the sensitive information had been redacted. Reynolds
believed that this compromise was reasonable and stated that
when the USAO was informed of the proposal they agreed with it. 
[FN1302] At the end of the meeting, the FBI agreed to allow the 
USAO to view but not possess or produce the following documents: 
the November 9, 1992 Review Group memorandum; the August 23, 1992
operations plan and annex; the September 15, 1992 internal FBI
headquarters note; an undated internal FBI headquarters note
regarding the Weaver and Harris matter [FN1304]; 19 situation 
reports from August 23-31 1992; and the shooting incident report 
dated September 30, 1992. [FN1305]<p>
  Later that day, Kahoe instructed Gale Evans, Unit Chief of the
Violent Crimes Unit of the Criminal Investigative Division, to
send the shooting incident report to Mike Dillon by overnight
delivery. Evans, who obtained a copy of the report from the
files of Kahoe who had been the Chairman of the Shooting
Incident Review Group, did not recall seeing interview notes
with the report. Thereafter, Evans prepared a memorandum to
accompany the report which incorporated instructions from Potts
that the report was to remain within FBI space and was to be
reviewed by prosecutors only within this space. [FN1306]<p>
  On January 12, Evans forwarded the documents to Dillon that
the FBI had agreed to produce in the January 7th meeting [FN1307] 
and stated in the accompying memorandum: <p>
  As with the Shooting Report furnished to Salt Lake Division
over the weekend of 1/8/93, the above documents are to be
maintained in the Boise Resident Agency and afforded appropriate
security. Per Assistant Director Potts, these documents are not
to be released to the prosecution and are only to be reviewed
under FBI supervision. <p>
  [GARRITY] <p>
[FN1309] Venkus stated that when they received these instructions,
he, Rampton and Dillon were upset that they could not turn the
report over to the USAO. [FN1310]<p>
  Lindquist reviewed these documents in the FBI office in Boise
on January 20. [FN1311] Following this review, Lindquist informed 
Howen that the report was not harmful to their case and that he
believed it was discoverable. [FN1312] Shortly thereafter, 
Ellsworth wrote a letter to Dillon requesting that he provide the
following documents to review, to produce in discovery and to
use at trial: administrative shooting report, headquarters memo
of shooting report, operations plan and annex, internal
headquarters note with entries regarding the case and headquarters
situation reports such as SIOC log synopses. [FN1313] Ellsworth 
opined that the documents were either responsive to
the government's obligations under Jencks and Brady or were
otherwise discoverable. He then wrote: <p>
  Your agency requested that our office not have possession of
these documents or review them in discovery without first giving
you written notice and an opportunity to intervene or persuade
the Department of Justice to intervene in our decision regarding
discovery and inspection. We remain sensitive to your concerns
and wish to work with the F.B.I. in this regard, but, as we
addressed in our letter of January 6, 1993, our office needs
access to all files and documents at F.B.I. Headquarters that
related to this case, not only for use at trial, but, also, to
complete pretrial interviews of all potential witnesses. We
reiterate the need to review all such materials as they might be
further identified. [FN1314]<p>
  Ellsworth closed the letter by requesting "immediate and
permanent possession of these materials and a review of any
additional possession of these materials and a review of any
additional that might still be identified." [FN1315] In early 
February 1993, Lindquist again requested the FBI to produce all
documentation at FBI Headquarters that was pertinent to the
Weaver case including the SIOC logs which Rampton subsequently
determined had already been produced. [FN1316]<p>
  It was not until the middle of March 1993 that Department of
Justice officials learned that the FBI had still not produced
these documents to the USAO. Thereafter, Reynolds retrieved a
copy of the January 12, FBI memo transmitting the documents at
issue to the Boise Resident Agency. Using that document as a
reference Reynolds contacted the USAO and reviewed whether the
documents listed in that memorandum, including the FBI critique
of the marshals which Reynolds added to the list, were needed at
trial or for discovery. [FN1317] After his discussion with the 
USAO, Reynolds requested Dana Biehl to examine the documents that 
the USAO wanted to produce in discovery and to provide his views as
to whether they were discoverable. [FN1318] On March 17, Biehl sent
a memorandum to Reynolds in which he opined that the three
documents at issue were either Brady or Jencks material. [FN1319]<p>
  After reviewing the Biehl memorandum, James Reynolds, on March
18, sent a memorandum to Mark Richard informing him of the
continuing discovery dispute between the FBI and the USAO. In
addition to the documents discussed at the January 7th meeting,
Reynolds told Richard that an additional document -- a marshal's
critique which the prosecution knew existed but had never seen-
- had been added to the list of documents that the FBI did not
want to produce. Reynolds informed Richard that all of the
documents at issue, with the exception of some internal FBI
headquarters notes, appeared to be discoverable or to constitute
Jencks or Brady material. He recommended that they work with the
FBI and the prosecutors to resolve the issues and to develop a
strategy to protect sensitive information within some of the
documents. In addition, Reynolds noted, "we need to ensure that
there is no additional material at Headquarters that is
discoverable. While personnel of this Section are prepared to
staff this effort, we have not been successful in initiating it,
as the Bureau's intransigence appears to emanate from Larry
Potts' level or above." [FN1320]<p>
  Five days later, a second meeting was held at the Department
of Justice to discuss the discovery dispute. This March 23rd
meeting was attended by Richard, Reynolds, Incontro, and Biehl
from the Department of Justice and Potts, Coulson, Kahoe from
the FBI. According to Reynolds, the FBI continued to complain
about the scope of the indictment and its impact on their
discovery obligations. [FN1321] Incontro and Biehl recalled that 
they supported the USAO position that most of these documents,
including the shooting incident report, should be produced in
discovery. [FN1322] Reynolds recalled that Coulson finally 
consented to the production of the documents if sensitive portions
of the operations plan were redacted. Those individuals at the 
meeting thought that the proposal to redact the operations plan 
was reasonable. [FN1323]<p>
  On March 26, the USAO filed its Eighth Addendum to its
Response to the Discovery Stipulation. In that document, the
government identified additional items that were being produced
in discovery including the November 9, 1992 Review Group Memo,
the situation reports, the shooting incident report, the 
operations plan and annex and the marshals critique. [FN1324]
Although identified in this filing, these documents were not 
produced to the defense until later. [FN1325] The shooting ]
incident report was delivered by hand on April 7, 1993; [FN1326] 
the situation reports and the operations plan were delivered on 
April 10, 1993; and the Review Group memo and the marshals 
critique were delivered on April 12, 1993. [FN1327] The Weaver 
trial began the next day on April 13, 1993. <p>
  <H4>d. The Defense Subpoena Deuces Tecum For the Shooting Incident
Report </H4><p>
  On April 13, 1993 the defense filed an ex parte application
for subpoenas duces tecum. Among the subpoenas sought was one
ordering Inspector Thomas W. Miller, who had headed the review
team examining the FBI shooting at Ruby Ridge, to bring "any and
all records used by the 'Shooting Incident Review Team.'" [FN1328]
Other subpoenas requested the FBI to produce copies of certain 
manual provisions and certain personnel files. [FN1329] Judge Lodge
approved the issuance of these subpoenas on April 14. It appears 
that defense counsel delivered the subpoena for Miller to the Boise 
office of the FBI. Dillon sent the subpoena to Miller and 
forwarded a copy to FBI Headquarters. Dillon recalled discussing 
this subpoena with Kahoe and telling him that the defense would 
want the notes developed during the shooting investigation. 
Thereafter, Dillon learned that the notes were in the Legal 
Counsel Division and he told Kahoe that they would have to be 
mailed to Miller for him to testify. [FN1330]<p>
  The evidence is conflicting as to whether the FBI notified the
USAO of this subpoena. Rampton believed that during the trial
Lindquist asked Venus to obtain a copy of the subpoenaed
materials but that Venkus did not think that the information was
needed until Miller was scheduled to testify. [FN1331] A July 29,
1993 chronology of events prepared by Rampton and Venkus after the
trial and an April 28, 1993 handwritten note by Venkus indicate
that Lindquist was advised that once Venkus received the "1-A"
material sought by the subpoena he would produce it to Lindquist
who would give the material to the defense. [FN1332] Lindquist who
would give the material to the defense. Lindquist had a vague
recollection of perhaps hearing that a subpoena had been served
on Miller but he could recall no further details. [FN1333] Howen 
had no recollection of discussing with Lindquist in late April 
1993 any efforts that the FBI was taking to check the "1-A" files 
for the interview notes. [FN1334] Although Howen was aware of 
subpoenas issued at the same time for FBI manuals and personnel 
files, he did not recall learning about this subpoena until early 
June. [FN1335] However, he added that if he had known about the 
subpoena he would not have been concerned because he would have 
assumed that the FBI would have produced the same documents as 
they had produced in discovery. [FN1336]<p>
  On April 14 or 15, Supervisory Special Agent Brian Callihan
from the Civil Litigation Unit I ("CLU I") of the LCD received a
phone call or a facsimile from the FBI office in Boise informing
him of two subpoenas that had been sent by Weaver's counsel.
According to Callihan, someone had decided that the subpoena
requesting the manual would be handled by the local office of
the FBI as a routine request for the FBI manual while the
subpoena directed to Miller would be handled by the LCD even
though it had not been properly served. <p>
  Attached to the subpoenas was a letter dated April 12, 1993
from defense counsel Charles Peterson to "potential witness"
advising the witness as follows" <p>
  Although the subpoena requires your attendance on April 17,
1993, I expect that you will not be called to testify until the
completion of the Government's case, some six weeks into the
trial. Please call my office as soon as possible so that you may
be advised of a specific date and time to appear -- otherwise
the subpoena requires you to attend continuously from the
beginning of the trial until your testimony is given. If I am
unavailable, please ask for Diane or Yvonne. [FN1337]<p>
  Calihan stated that the letter left him with the belief that
defense counsel would advise Miller when to appear. [FN1338] 
Because Callihan believed that Miller would probably not testify 
for at least another two months, he saw no reason to expedite the
production of the subpoenaed documents. Callihan insisted that
no one ever informed him that there was a need to expedite the
handling of the subpoena or that the records were needed prior
to the testimony of Miller. In addition, he believed that proper
service of the subpoena had never been made on Miller. [FN1339]
Accordingly, he processed the subpoena consistent with routine
procedures by sending it to the Civil Discovery Unit ("CDRU") of
the LCD. <p>
  On April 30, two weeks after first learning of the subpoena,
Callihan prepared a request to the CDRU and described the
litigation as follows: <p>
  Criminal trial is ongoing. The U.S. Attorney's office has
previously released a number of documents to the defense. The
attached subpoena requests additional documents for release to
the defense. [FN1340]<p>
  He then described the work that needed to be done: <p>
  Locate and process for release to the defense attorney
documents responsive to the attached subpoena. The shooting
report has previously been released. The records used by the
Shooting Incident Review Team would include 1-A's in the
Shooting Review file and any other documents referred to and
relied upon in the Shooting Report. [FN1341]<p>
  Callihan also requested that the search be coordinated with CLU
I and with Division 6. [FN1342]<p>
  The Callihan request was directed to Monique Wilson. When
Wilson first reviewed the subpoena she did not think that it
included a request for the handwritten notes so she discussed
the issue with Callihan on April 30. Callihan instructed her
that the notes should be included. Later that day she requested
the file from the confidential file room and received it shortly
thereafter. However, when she examined the materials that had
been produced she noticed that the handwritten notes were
missing. She then returned to the confidential file room where
they found the handwritten notes in the bulky exhibit section.
Wilson stated that there was initial confusion in locating these
notes because an incorrect date had been placed on the outside
of the bulky package. Thereafter, Wilson processed the
documents, made 5 copies as requested by Callihan and forwarded
these materials to Callihan on May 11. [FN1343]<p>
  When Callihan received the package from CDRU he reviewed it,
approved it for dissemination and sent it on May 21, 1993 to the
FBI mail room with a cover letter instructing them to send it to
Miller and to send courtesy copies to the USAO. [FN1344] Callihan
did not include instructions as to how the package was to be 
mailed; he concluded later that considering the size of the 
package and the absence of specific mailing instructions that it 
would have been sent by fourth class mail. [FN1345]<p>
  Two weeks later, on June 4, the package arrived at the USAO.
Roberta Cruser, the docket technician for the USAO, opened the
package, dated stamped the Callihan cover letter and routed the
materials at about 10:00 a.m. that morning to Howen. [FNB1346] At 
the luncheon recess Howen returned to his office. The court had 
just excused HRT member Lon Horiuchi after defense questioning hag
been completed. When Howen arrived in his office he discovered
the package on his desk with the May 21 cover letter from
Callihan which indicated that Callihan was enclosing two copies
of documents responsive to the defense subpoena seeking "any and
all records used by the Shooting Incident Review Team." In
addition, the letter stated: <p>
  These documents consist of the original statements, and the FBI
Manual of Investigative Operations and Guidelines provisions
noted in the report as being read by all members of the Shooting
Incident Review Unit and we believe that they are ready for
release to the defendants' attorneys. [FN1347]<p>
  Howen recognized that many of the documents in the package had
been provided previously to them and to the defense in
discovery. However, other documents in the package had never
been produced. These never produced documents were: the agents'
interview notes from the "1-A" files of all FBI personnel
interviewed in the investigation except for Eugene Glen; and two
drawings by HRT sniper Horiuchi including a shooting diagram of
the second shot taken through the Weaver front door on August
22, 1992. When Howen examined the materials in the package and
saw the Horiuchi diagram he knew that the late production of
these materials would be difficult for the prosecution to
explain and would result in significant criticism by the media.
The impact was even greater because it followed closely behind
several other damaging and embarrassing disclosures made during
the trial. [FN1348] Howen stated that he does not think that he 
had ever "been as low professionally." [FN1349]<p>
  Thereafter, Howen returned to the courtroom and informed the
parties of the package that he had just received. Defense
counsel referred to it as the latest in a series of incidents
that had prejudiced the rights of the defendant and moved for
the case to be dismissed because of alleged prosecutorial
misconduct and for sanctions to be imposed on the government.
Howen, after noting that many of the materials in the package
had been previously produced, [FN1350] informed the court that 
his office was in the process of trying to determine the reasons
for the late production of these materials. Howen stressed that 
his office produced the materials as soon as they were received 
and suggested that the responsibility for the late production of
these materials rested elsewhere. The court deferred a
definitive ruling until after the weekend and then stated, <p>
  [T]he Court is very upset about these things happening. It does
appear that it is somewhat of a pattern on the part of people,
agencies outside of the District of Idaho. The Court does not
agree that there is any evidence that the U.S. Attorney's Office
at least locally, is doing anything to hinder the prosecution of
this case or prejudice the defense. The comments of Mr. Howen
just now indicate his veracity and his sincerity in trying to
comply with the rules . . . . It seems to be totally inexcusable
and extremely poor judgment on the part of whoever is involved
to send something like this fourth class mail when a trial of
this nature is going to, the cost of time and human tragedy that
is involved. [FN1351]<p>
  Following the court session, the USAO and others sought an
explanation for the late arrival of the package of materials
sent by Callihan. Callihan recalls that on June 4, a woman from
the USAO called and asked in a "rude and obnoxious" manner why
the documents had been sent by fourth class mail and why it had
taken so long to send them. Callihan stated that he inquired why
there was such a concern to which the woman said that Howen was
upset about the delay. Callihan then told her that the request
had been handled like similar requests and that Howen could call
him to discuss the matter if he wanted. [FN1352]<p>
  Sometime between 5:30 and 6:00 p.m. on June 4, Dillon
telephoned Joseph R. Davis, Assistant Director of the Legal
Counsel Division and informed him that the FBI headquarters was
responsible for the late production of the documents in the
Weaver case and that the judge in the case was very upset. [FN1353]
Dillon also mentioned that he had received an earlier discovery
request for these documents but had not received the documents
until that day. He told Davis that the U.S. Attorney had
requested the FBI to provide an explanation for the delay to
give to the judge. Davis left messages on the answering machines
of Brian Callihan and Thomas Clawson to call him. [FN1354]<p>
  Later that same day, Callihan returned Davis' call. Davis
informed him that the U.S. Attorney and Dillon were upset about
the lateness of the transmittal and were unsure of what
documents were in controversy. Callihan explained how he
processed the request and repeated his understanding that there
was no urgency to the request since Miller had not been expected
to testify for several months. [FN1355]<p>
  Thereafter, Davis called Ellsworth to attempt to resolve the
conflict between the accounts given by Dillon and Callihan.
During a conference call in which Davis, Callihan, Ellsworth,
Dillon and perhaps others participated, Callihan repeated his
version of events. Howen remarked that these documents were
responsive to a number of discovery requests and should have
been produced earlier. Ellsworth agreed and, along with Howen,
requested LCD and Dillon to prepare sworn declarations to the
court explaining the production delay. These declarations were
prepared and sent to the USAO. [FN1356]<p>
  Sometime around June 5, the government received an affidavit
prepared by Brian Callihan in which he detailed how he learned
of the subpoena, the actions he took in responding to it and the
beliefs he had concerning the time requirements for production
of the materials. Callihan then stated, "[a]lthough I may have
been aware of a request from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the
Shooting Incident Review Group Report, I was unaware that the
U.S. Attorney's Office had previously requested any or all other
records, documents, and notes in connection with this
investigation." [FN1357] Dillon also prepared a draft affidavit 
in which he accepted responsibility for not adequately relaying 
the USAO request to FBI headquarters. Howen decided not to file 
any of the affidavits filed by individuals involved in the 
incident. [FN1358]<p>
  On June 8, the parties made additional arguments to the court
concerning how they should proceed after the disclosure of the
subpoenaed materials. Of particular focus of the parties was the
Horiuchi drawing and its significance. The court reserved its
ruling until the next day but before doing so stated that: <p>
  The Court does not excuse the FBI Agency,
The Court thinks there has been a failure to comply
with what was fully understand [sic] to be required.
They get involved in these technicalities as to who
was served, but it is obvious they had notice of it,
they were aware of what was required, and again, it
is not anytime to be playing games with the Court
on technicalities. [FN1359]<p>
   Judge Lodge issues his ruling on June 9 and ordered 
Horiuchito return for further examination in court due to the 
failure of the government to produce the materials in a timely 
manner.  In addition, he assessed against the government the 
costs and defense attorney fees for the one-day delay. [FN1360]  
Almost five months later, on October 26, Judge Lodge issues an 
order imposing a separate fine of $1920 against the FBI.  This 
fine represented the fees paid to defense counsel on the day 
that Horiuchi was brought back to testify.  In this order, which 
is discussed more fully in section IV(o), Judge Lodge was highly 
critical of the actions of the FBI which he believed hampered 
the ability of the government to comply with its obligations to 
produce discoverable documents including Jencks and Brady 
materials.  As a result of these actions, Judge Lodge found that 
the FBI had failed to comply with its discovery obligations under 
Fed. R. Crim. P. 16 and held them to be in contempt of court in 
violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 401. [FN1361]<p>
<H3>3.   Discussion</H3><p><H4>a.   FBI Resistance to USAO Discovery Requests</H4><p>
  Our investigation has revealed that the prosecution of the
Weaver matter was plagued and complicated by a continuing series
of disagreements, misunderstandings and preconceptions that existed
between the FBI and the USAO.  One of the areas where such
problems surfaced involved the efforts of the USAO t respond to its
discovery obligations in the case.  Over the course of the
pretrial period, the FBI produced a large volume of material on a timely
basis.  Indeed, the FBI Resident Agency in Boise appeared to have
been cooperative with the USAO and to have made good faith
efforts to comply with the requests of the USAO.<p>
     Although the overall effort of the FBI to respond to the
discovery requests of the USAO appeared to have been good, we
have found two areas where problems existed.  The first involves 
the problems associated with the actions of the FBI Laboratory, 
which are discussed elsewhere in this report.  The second area
concerned the resistance of personnel at FBI headquarters to 
produce a group of documents that was small in number but 
significant in importance to the issues in the case. [FN1362]<p>
     With regard to the production of this group of documents, 
it is our conclusion that FBI personnel, predominantly at the
headquarters level, [FN1363] imposed unreasonable resistance and
applied inappropriate standards to the discovery requests from 
the USAO, exhibited an unjustified unwillingness to cooperate as 
a teen member in the prosecution, and evidenced a troubling 
distrust of the USAO.  Indeed, we were distressed by the 
persistent intransigence shown by FBI headquarters personnel.<p>
     From the outset, officials at FBI headquarters opposed the
prosecutors' theory of the case.  They steadfastly adhered to
their view that the indictment should be limited to the assault 
of a federal officer charge and that the conspiracy count was not
supported by the evidence.  The prosecutors were aware of this
view but disagreed with it. Although a free exchange of ideas and
information should always occur between the FBI and the USAO, the
FBI in this case failed to appreciate that it is the prosecutor
not the FBI that controls the direction of the prosecution.  The 
FBI failed to identify the point where healthy debate became
destructive resistance.<p>
     The FBI used their disagreement over the scope of the
indictment to support their refusal to produce certain materials
in discovery.  In the final analysis, with one exception, there
seems to have been little basis for their refusal to produce 
these materials.  Although the shooting incident report was an
internal document, it was certainly pertinent to the issues in
the prosecution.  Even members of the FBI conceded its relevance.
[FN1364] Standing alone, the fact that such a report had never been
produced in discovery was not a basis to resist its production. 
Furthermore, as a practical matter, most of its contents,
including the statements of the HRT members, had already been 
produced in discovery.  Nor do we think that the resistance of 
the FBI to producing the November 9, 1992 Review Group memorandum 
was justified.  Again, a document that was shielded from criminal
discovery simply because it is evaluative in nature.  Similarly,
with respect to the marshals critique, there seemed no sound
basis upon which the FBI could object to its production. The 
marshals critique may have been embarrassing to the FBI and the 
Marshals Service and it may not have been the result of thorough 
research and analysis but those factors are totally irrelevant to 
its discoverability.  Of all the contested documents, the only one
for which the FBI would seem to have had a valid concern was the
operations plan and annex.  However, as was ultimately done, the
sensitive portions were redacted from the document before being
produced to the defense.  The prosecutors did not object to the
redactions and, indeed, from the beginning of the controversy had
been willing to consider the redaction of the document. [FN1365] 
Despite this willingness to compromise, the FBI maintained a
course of stubborn resistance.<p>
     In addition to the unjustified refusal to produce these
materials we are concerned by the bureaucratic resistance of the
FBI.  Although objections were raised to producing these
documents in discovery, no one ever assumed control at the 
headquarters level in an attempt to resolve the dispute 
expeditiously.  Instead the controversy lingered for months
before all of the documents were eventually produced in
discovery. During this process, the FBI seemed to lose sight of 
its role as the investigative arm of the Department of Justice 
which is supposed to assist, not impede, federal prosecutors in 
pursuing violators of federal criminal laws.  It was not until the
Criminal Division of the Department of Justice intervened that the
discovery dispute was received. [FN1366]<p>
     Our investigation revealed that the discovery problems were
symptomatic of a disturbing distrust by the FBI of the local
federal prosecutors.  Nothing in our investigation provided any
explanation or justification for this lack of trust.  We hope
that the uncooperative attitude displayed by the FBI in the Weaver
matter was an aberration.  James Reynolds characterized the
discovery dispute in the Weaver case as "unique."  He told
investigators that it was unusual for the Department to become
involved in pretrial discovery disputes in cases litigated by the
U.S. Attorneys.  The refusal and reluctance of the FBI to permit
the prosecutors to view the documents was, in Reynolds' view,
inconsistent with his prior experience with other agencies in
releasing material that was classified or of even greater
sensitivity than the documents at issue in the Weaver case. 
Reynolds stated that it was apparent to him that the Violent
Crimes Section of the FBI did not have a good idea of what was 
legally discoverable in a criminal case. [FN1367]<p>
  FBI officials blamed some of the discovery difficulties to the
attitudes of members of the USAO.<p>
                            [GARRITY]<p>
                                        [FN1368] Our investigation
found no support for these claims.  From the beginning of the
preparation of the case for trial, the USAO made it clear as to
the scope of discovery and the types of materials that needed to 
be produced.  Despite its repeated requests to review the
headquarters files related to this case, the prosecutors were
never afforded this opportunity. [FN1369]  Indeed, to this day, the
prosecutors are not confident that all pertinent materials located
from FBI Headquarters were shown to them. [FN1370]  The prosecutors
recognized the discoverability of the contested documents and
believed that they were obligated to produce them.  The
determination to obtain and produce discoverable materials cannot
be classified as intransigent behavior.<p>
     Although we believe that the USAO was clear in articulating
the materials that needed to be produced in discovery, we are
somewhat perplexed as to their failure to keep the Department of
Justice officials who were assisting them in resolving the dispute
better informed of the progress of the FBI in producing the
documents at issue.  After the January 7 meeting, over two months
passed before the USAO contacted the Department of Justice to
inform them that the FBI still needed to produce these documents so
that the USAO had gained possession of these documents.  The USAO
never informed the Department of Justice officials of this
additional delay and thus, never gained the further benefit of any
assistance that they could have provided.  Perhaps if the USAO had
been more aggressive in keeping the Department informed of the
progress of the production of the documents the controversy could
have been resolved sooner.<p>
     It is unclear what exact impact the dispute over these
documents had on the government's case.  Neither Howen nor
Lindquist viewed this controversy as determinative of the outcome
of the case. [FN1371]  However, Lindquist thought that the repeated
controversies over discovery issues had a cumulative effect on the
judge that resulted in the judge imposing sanctions on the
government after the untimely delivery of the subpoenaed version
of the shooting incident report. [FN1372]  In addition, the dispute
needlessly diverted the valuable time, energy and attention of the
prosecutors from critical trial preparation tasks.  Ellsworth
stated that they felt that they were "battling on two front" -- the
defense counsel and the FBI. [FN1373]  The prosecutors did not need 
the added aggravation of engaging in this debate at a time when they
were required to prepare the case and witnesses for trial and to
respond to continuous defense motions.  The discovery debate also
worsened the already tense relationship between the USAO and the
FBI Resident Agency in Boise. [FN1374]  Indeed, Dillon thought that 
the reluctance of the FBI Headquarters to release the documents
contributed further to the tension between his office and the
USAO.1375  The USAO had the right to expect the cooperation of the
FBI throughout all phases of the discovery process.  However,
instead of a partner in this process, FBI Headquarters assumed the
role of an adversary.<p>
    <H4>b.   Problems With Producing the Complete Shooting Incident 
Report and Supporting Materials</H4><p>
     Our investigation confirms that the USAO from September 1992
and throughout the pretrial period repeatedly requested the FBI to
provide all materials pertinent to the events that occurred at Ruby
Ridge. [FN1376]  As the case preparation proceeded, the USAO renewed
their requests for this material on a number of occasions. 
Moreover, as they learned that particular documents existed they
included these documents in their requests.  One such document was
the shooting incident report dated September 30, 1992 and the
memorandum of the Shooting Incident Review Group dated November 9,
1992.  When the USAO finally received these documents on the eve of
trial they believed that the materials produced to them constituted
all of the documents related to the shooting report.  However, 
unknown to them at the time, the production was incomplete.<p>
     Shortly after the trial began and apparently without the
knowledge of the USAO, the FBI received a defense subpoena for the
shooting incident report and supporting materials.  Five weeks
later, the Legal Counsel Division of the FBI completed its response
to the subpoena and sent the large package, without mailing
instructions, to its mail room for shipment.  Two weeks later, the
package arrived at the USAO in Boise.  Howen discovered upon
opening the package that it contained, in addition to the shooting
incident report that the government had already produced to the
defense, the interview notes of the HRT members and two drawings by
FBI sniper Lon Horiuchi.  None of these latter materials had ever
been shown or given to the USAO.<p>
     The late production of these materials was significant and had
a detrimental impact on the prosecution of the Weaver case. 
Indeed, this event provided additional support for the defense
argument that the government was covering up the events that had
occurred at Ruby Ridge.  Moreover, the U.S. Attorney opined that
when Horiuchi was called back for further cross examination, it
afforded the defense another opportunity to remind the jury of the
death of Vicki Weaver and how she had been killed. [FN1377]<p>
     The untimely production of these materials raises a number of
concerns.  First and foremost is why these materials were not
produced during the pretrial discovery phase of the case.  there
can be no doubt that the USAO requested these materials in a timely
fashion and that they were entitled to have the FBI produce them
promptly.  Throughout the pretrial period the USAO, most notably
Howen, repeatedly requested the FBI to produce all materials
related to the FBI's participation at the crisis at Ruby Ridge.  It
appears that Dillon transmitted many of the USAO discovery requests
to FBI Headquarters.  Moreover, in addition to any communications
received from the Boise Resident Agency, FBI Headquarters personnel
were notified of these requests from direct communications with the
USAO as well as by their discussions with members of the Terrorism
and Violent Crime Section of the Department of Justice.  Indeed,
FBI headquarters officials were disgruntled because of the
persistent attempts of the USAO to obtain 'everything."  However,
if there was ever any question as to the scope of materials that
the USAO wanted with respect to the shooting incident report it
surely was resolved by the January 6, 1993 letter from Howen to
Glenn.  The specificity of that letter in our opinion left no doubt
that investigative notes and certainly drawings by an HRT sniper
were encompassed within the request.<p>
     Based on our investigation, we conclude that headquarters
personnel were informed of the scope of discovery sought by the
USAO yet failed to take adequate efforts to locate responsive
materials.  Dillon seeks to accept fully responsibility for this
production problem because he may not have made adequate request
for the investigative notes of the internal shooting inquiry. 
[FN1378] Howen opined to investigators that he thought it was 
unfair for Dillon to take the blame for what he believed to be 
omissions of FBI Headquarter's personnel. [FN1379]  We agree.  
Perhaps someone should have been more aggressive in formulating 
instructions to FBI headquarters and monitoring the quality of 
their response. Nevertheless, the primary responsibility in this
case must rest on the doorstep of FBI headquarters. They 
understood the requests and they were responsible for generating 
and storing the records being sought.<p>
     We have yet to obtain clear evidence of what actual efforts
were taken by the FBI to search their files for documents
responsive to the discovery request as outlined by the USAO. 
However, our impression is that it was not a well organized search. 
Indeed, during our investigation, we found at least one document
that fell within the scope of discovery but which the FBI had not
located and produced. [FN1380]  With regard to the
shooting incident report, FBI officials argued that as a practical
matter the original investigative notes are not considered to be
part of the shooting report and that the discovery request was not
broad enough to encompass these notes. [FN1381]  We find this 
explanation unavialing since discovery request was certainly broad 
enough to encompass such notes. [FN1382] These officials indicated 
that they consider the shooting report to consist of the
report without the backup notes. [FN1383]  Also troubling is the
apparent failure of CID to consult with the Inspections Division --
which was responsible for preparing the report -- and determine if
they had retained any pertinent files. [FN1384]  David Binney, who is
the Assistant Director of the FBI Inspection Division, was very
sure that he never received a discovery request for the shooting
incident report.  Binney emphasized that because a shooting
incident report contains sensitive information the Legal Counsel
Division would have to authorize the release of the document before
it would be produced.  Accordingly, if he had received a request,
he would have forwarded it to Assistant Director Davis in the Legal
Counsel Division.  He has no recollection of making such a
referral. [FN1385]<p>
     In addition to our concern over the quality of the FBI's
response to the discovery requests, we are distressed by the
apparent lack of coordination between the CID and LCD after the
subpoena was received.  The FBI's pretrial response to the
discovery request appears to have been handled totally by CID. We
learned that such involvement by CID in criminal discovery was
unusual. [FN1386] No evidence was found that CID ever communicated 
with LCD when it was responding to the discovery requests. 
[FN1387]<p>
     Later, when the subpoena request arrived at FBI Headquarters,
it was handled by LCD with no apparent assistance from CID.  We
find no evidence that CID and LCD worked together to produce the
materials requested in the subpoena.<p>
                            [GARRITY]<p>
                [FN1388] Although the April 30 search request
prepared by Brian Callihan referenced that the report had been
produced previously, there is no indication of when Callihan
acquired that knowledge.  The only conflicting evidence of whether
CID was aware of the subpoena came from Dillon who recalled
directing the subpoena to Miller and to FBI Headquarters.  He seems
to believe that he forwarded the subpoena to CID since he recalled
speaking to Kahoe about the need to obtain the notes developed
during the investigation and that he later learned that the
subpoena had been transferred to LCD for handling.  At that time,
he recalled telling Kahoe that the investigative notes would have
to be sent to Miller in order for him to testify.  However,
Dillon's recollection conflicts with that of Brian Callihan of LCD. 
Callihan did not recall learning about the subpoena from CID but
rather from either a phone call of a facsimile on April 14 or 15, 
1993 from the Boise Resident Agency. [FN1389]<p>
     In addition to issues associated with the thoroughness of the
FBI's response to the discovery request, we are concerned about the
nature and quality of the FBI response to the defense subpoena. It
is our view that aspects of that response could have been 
undertaken in a more responsible manner. [FN1390] At the outset, 
we are troubled that the FBI did not communicate with defense 
counsel Peterson to determine when Miller would testify. Callihan 
told investigators that he expected defense counsel to contact 
Miller. However, we think that the letter was clear that the 
obligation was upon the FBI not defense counsel to make the 
contact.  We cannot countenance the laissez-faire attitude shown 
by the FBI to its legal obligations in an ongoing federal trial. 
Indeed, we are troubled by the relaxed pace at which the FBI 
responded to the subpoena when they had not even determined a 
date for Miller's testimony.  After receiving the subpoena, 
Callihan waited two weeks before forwarding it for processing 
and when it was returned to him, he waited another ten days 
before drafting a cover letter and sending the package to the 
mail room.  Then, when he forwarded it to the mail room, he 
neglected to provide specific mailing instructions.  Finally, 
we fail to comprehend why the USAO was not consulted about 
responding to this subpoena.  None of the prosecutors in the 
USAO -- Howen, Lindquist or Ellsworth -- ever recall being told
of the subpoena or of any efforts by the FBI to assemble the 
requested materials.  Nor is thee any evidence that Dillon 
alerted the prosecutors to the existence of this particular
subpoena which was received at the same time as the subpoena for
the FBI manual. [FN1391]  The cryptic references to the USAO in a 
few notes do not suffice to establish such knowledge.<p>
     Some of these discovery problems seem to have been caused by
the failure of the FBI to have an organized system for responding
to discovery requests.  As previously mentioned, we requested the
FBI to conduct another search of its files to ensure that all
documents responsive to the discovery obligations in the Weaver
case had been produced. [FN1392]  We made this request because of our
concern over the thoroughness and care in which the earlier
searches had been conducted.  We see a compelling need for a
centralized tracking system in the FBI that would monitor and
coordinate discovery and subpoena requests and then record actions
taken in a case.  Included in this tracking information should be
the name of the person responsible for handling the requests as
well as an identification of the files searched and the materials
produced.  Such requests should be handled by one person in one
division not by multiple persons in multiple divisions.<p>
     In addition to improving the methodology of retrieving
responsive documents, we believe that the FBI needs to examine its
practices concerning the preservation of case related materials. 
During our investigation, there were a number of instances in which
an interviewee told us that he had prepared a document but no one
could produce a copy of it.  For example, we were told that there
were multiple drafts of the operations plan yet we only were able
to locate one draft version.  Similarly, we never located any
original facsimiles or notes of headquarters personnel that were
prepared during the crisis at Ruby Ridge.  We are troubled by the
apparent lack of a system to preserve such critical records and
believe that the FBI needs to institute a system to avoid such
omissions in the future.<p>
          <H3>4.   Conclusion</H3><p>
     Although we found no intent by the FBI headquarters personnel
to violate the discovery obligations of the government, we believe
that the FBI unreasonably resisted the efforts of the USAO to
comply with their discovery responsibilities in the Weaver case. 
In addition, it appears that the FBI did not put forth its best
efforts in responding to the discovery requests or the subsequent
defense subpoena.  Indeed, the decision of the court in October
1993 to fine the FBI for its intransigence on
various discovery issues is consistent with our conclusion. 
Although the facts giving rise to the problems in the Weaver case
may be unique, we believe that serious organization problems exist
and must be corrected.  There is a critical need in the future to
improve the quality of the response of the FBI to discovery
demands.  Such improvement must include establishing an organized
system of responding to and monitoring discovery requests and
improving the coordination among FBI components.<p><hr><P>

provided the

slightly different recollection of this incident.  He told
investigators that he had a vague recollection of an FBI agent
from "out west" and an unidentified individual coming to the

     W. Douglas Gow, Associate Deputy Director of the FBI,
requested that this document be prepared in response to a call
from Henry Hudson who asked him whether he "had any thought about
the handling of [the Weaver] crisis or crisis in general." 
Hudson told Gow that as the new Director of the USMS he would
appreciate any ideas that Gow could provide.  Thereafter, John
Uda was assigned the task of preparing the document.  From the
instructions that he received, Uda understood that he was
identifying talking points that Coulson and Hudson would want
discuss about the Weaver/Harris matter.  Uda emphasized that
these items were not intended to be criticisms of the USMS but
with Hudson.  Although Gow had intended to give the critique to
Hudson, he never conveyed it to him.  See Sworn Statement of W.

     1362 Glenn told investigators that he believed to the extent
that any controversies arose over certain documents such as the

would be produced in discovery.  Glenn Sworn Statement, at 35-37.<p>

     1364 Special Agent Rampton believed that there was an
unnecessary delay in producing the shooting incident report and
the operations plan.  He could understand the need of the USAO for
these documents and did not believe that there was anything in
the documents harmful to FBI interests.  Rampton FD-302, at 36. 
Although he did not think that the conclusions of the report were
relevant to the issues in the Weaver prosecution, Davis conceded
that the factual content of the report probably rendered it
subject to discovery.  Davis FD-302, at 5.  Lindquist recalled that
Rampton, Venkus and Dillon agreed with him that there was no
reason not to produce the report.  Lindquist believed that they had
recommended to FBI Headquarters that the report be released. 
However, they indicated to Lindquist that they were encountering
significant resistance from FBI Headquarters regarding the
production of the report.  Lindquist Interview, Tape 5, at 4-5.<p>

     1376 Howen stated that on a number of occasions that the USAO
made both written and oral requests of the FBI to produce all
materials having any relevance to the Weaver matter.  These
requests were made to the FBI office in Boise and presumably
relayed to FBI Headquarters.  Howen said that they also told
members of the Terrorism and Violent Crime Section of DOJ that they
suspected that there was some type of file on the shooting incident
report and that they wanted access to everything.  Howen Interview,

of LCD also appears to assign responsibility for the problem to
Dillon.  Davis believes that the primary responsibility for
responding to criminal discovery in the FBI usually rests with the
office of origin and, in those situation when responsive documents
are located elsewhere, it is the responsibility of the office of
origin "to set appropriate leads to insure their timely
production."  Davis FD-302, at 5-6.<p>

range of command and control issues that arose with regard to the
response of the FBI to the crisis at Ruby Ridge.  Included as
topics for discussion were deployment problems, tactical issues and
negotiation issues.  Gale Evans FD-302, at 3-4.  As a precautionary
measure, we requested the FBI to search its files again at
Headquarters and at the field offices involved in responding to the
Weaver crisis to determine if any additional responsive documents
existed.  This search resulted in the location of one document that
had not been previously identified and produced.  However, this
document did not contain any information significant to the issues
examined in this investigation.<p>

     1382 [GARRITY]<p>
     1383 Howen stated that when he viewed and finally received the
shooting incident report he never thought to ask the FBI for
material in the 1-A file.  He told investigators that because it
was an internal investigation, he did not know if the 1-A procedure
was being followed.  Howen Interview, Tape 9, at 21.<p>
     1384 The Inspection Division of the FBI is responsible for
conducting a shooting incident review when requested by another
division.  When the review is completed, the report is sent to the
requesting division.  According to Paul Philip, the Inspector
Deputy Assistant Director of the FBI Inspection Division, once the
Inspection Division forwards this report to the requesting
division, that division becomes the owner of the report and has the
right to decide whether the report should be released.  FD-302

Similarly, Austin Anderson, Unit Chief of the Investigative Law

case.  He told investigators that Gale Evans, the Unit Chief of the
VCMO Unit, confirmed that he had no notes or records indicating
that Anderson had discussed any discovery issues with him.

Joseph Davis recalls one phone call with Ellsworth in which
Ellsworth informed him of the defense request for the manual
provisions as well as the shooting incident report.  Ellsworth was
unable to tell Davis when these requests were made or when they
were due.  As a result of this conversation, Davis sent an
electronic mail message to Beau McFarland around April 26, 1993
requesting him to investigate the matter and to make sure that FBI
was responding appropriately.  Davis FD-302, at 5-6.  However, in
that message, Davis wrote only about the subpoena 
for the manual provisions; no mention was made of the subpoena for
the shooting incident report.  Memorandum from Davis to McFarland,

<H3>IV. SPECIFIC ISSUES INVESTIGATED</H3><p>
<H3>N.   Alleged Problems With the Participation of the FBI in 
Case Preparation and Its Relationship With Other
Members of the Trial Preparation Team</H3><p> <H3>1.   Introduction</H3><p>
     One of the issues that arose as the various law enforcement
entities converges at Ruby Ridge was which agency had the primary
responsibility for planning, organizing and coordinating the
activities of law enforcement personnel.  It was decided early in
the crisis that the FBI would have the lead role in the operations
at Ruby Ridge.  However, after Weaver and Harris surrendered, the
focus shifted from crisis resolution to trials preparation and the
U.S. Attorney's Office in Boise ("USAO") assumed the lead role. 
Initially, the FBI believed that it was to be the sole agency
assisting the USAO in trial preparation.  Later, for reasons that
the USAO and the FBI dispute, agents from the U.S. Marshals Service
and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms ("BATF") were
assigned by their respective agencies to assist the USAO.<p>
     The FBI believed that the addition of these agents was
unnecessary, improper and was accomplished in a less than
forthright manner by the USAO.  The arrival of the marshals and the
BATF agents coupled with disagreements over how witness interviews
in Iowa were to be conducted worsened the already fragile working
relationship between the FBI and the USAO.  Thereafter, various
actions and attitudes of the investigative team created significant
discord between the FBI and the other team members.  In addition,
the USAO alleges that their efforts to prepare their case for trial
were also hampered by the failure of officials at FBI Headquarters
to make themselves available for interviews.<p>
          <H3>2.   Statement of Facts</H3><p>
<H4>a.   Defining the Structure of the Trial Team and
the Role and Responsibilities of the Individual
Members</H4><p>
(1)  The Lead Agency Concept and the Initial
Disagreement Regarding the Interviewing of
Witnesses in Iowa<p>
     As the various law enforcement agencies arrived at Ruby Ridge
on August 21 and August 22, 1992, it quickly became evident that
there was a need for one agency to assume the leadership role
during the crisis.  Because the assault of a federal officer charge
fell within the jurisdiction of the FBI, it was decided that it was
appropriate for the FBI to perform this role.  Once the crisis was
over, and the focus had shifted to trial preparation, Assistant
U.S. Attorney Howen believed that the leadership 
role was transferred from the FBI to the USAO. [FN1393] 
Although Howen and Assistant U.S. Attorney Lindquist would
entertain suggestions from the FBI, they viewed themselves as the
"captains' responsible for directing case preparation and any
additional investigative activities that were necessary. [FN1394]<p>
     From the outset, tensions existed between the FBI and the
USAO.  A number of early incidents intensified the growing
animosity between the two government entities.  One of these
incidents centered around the request of the USAO to transport the
birthing shed on the Weaver property from Ruby Ridge to Boise.  The
USAO argued that it was important to have the shed accessible to
permit the testing and use of the shed at trial. [FN1395] The FBI
disagreed and maintained that the shed was not necessary and that
the transportation and storage costs were too high.  The FBI
ultimately agreed to transport the shed to Boise.  Later, when it
became apparent that the USAO would not be using the shed, the FBI
questioned whether the initial request to transport the shed had
been well considered. [FN1395]<p>
     Another issue that created controversy concerned the
conducting of witness interviews in Iowa.  Howen had informed the
FBI case agents that to support the conspiracy theory it was
important to interview witnesses in Iowa who knew Weaver before he
moved to Idaho.  Howen and Lindquist wanted one of the case agents
to conduct these interviews since they believed that they best
understood the facts and nuances of the case. [FN1397]<p>
[GARRITY]<p>
[FN1398] However, the FBI informed the USAO that a <p>
[GARRITY]<p>
case agent could be sent to handle an important interview or a
followup interview. [FN1399]<p>
     At a September 28, 1992 meeting, Special Agents Venkus and
Rampton advised Howen that they were going to send out leads to
Iowa.  According to Venkus, Howen expressed no opposition to this
plan. [FN1400]  On the next day, Howen gave Venkus a list of 
witnessesb for the FBI to interview [FN1401] and noted on the list 
that he wanted "clean 302s." [FN1402]  Soon after Venkus sent out 
the leads, Howen told him that he had misunderstood his 
instructions and that he had just wanted to have the addresses of 
the prospective witnesses updated. [FN1403]<p>
     Ellsworth protested this action to Special Agent in Charge
Eugene Glenn and argued that the agents had only been instructed to
conduct "background leads" which consisted of identifying<p>
[GARRITY]<p>
individuals and places of residence. [FN1404]  Howen, who did not 
recall instructing Rampton to send out the leads, explained to 
Rampton that he did not want the leads conducting the interviews 
because of the animosity existing between the people being 
interviewed -- many of whom were friends or supporters of the 
Weavers -- and the FBI because he wanted to avoid creating a paper 
trail of FD-302's which would reveal his case preparation strategy 
to the defense.  He told Rampton that if the FBI were going to 
conduct the interviews, he wanted the case agents who were 
familiar with the case to handle it. [FN1405]  Lindquist 
instructed Dillon to stop all of these interviews and that if he 
failed to do so, the interviews would have to be redone. [FN1406]<p>
     At some point during this time period, Howen informed Rampton
that he wanted to participate in the Iowa interviews and that he
would not have to generate interview reports. [FN1407]  Rampton told
Howen that Iowa FBI agents would be conducting these interviews. 
One week later, Lindquist informed Rampton that the Marshals
Service had offered them two marshals to assist with the case and
that they had accepted the offer. [FN1408]<p>
     A third dispute between the USAO and the FBI involved [G.J.]
Lindquist explained that it was an essential part of the
government's case to show what had occurred at Ruby Ridge on August
22 as well as on August 21.  Part of this proof consisted of<p>

[GARRITY] [FN1416]<p>
[FN1417]<p>
[G.J.]<p>
[FN1418]  Howen viewed this incident as the "defining moment" 
when the working relationship between the USAO and the FBI on 
the Weaver case "was over." [FN1419]<p>
(2)  The Decision to Assign Members of the
Marshals Service and BATF to Assist in
Case Preparation <p>
     In late October 1992, Deputy Marshals Robert Masaitis and John
Stafford were assigned to assist the USAO in the preparation of the
Weaver case for trial.  At around the same time, BATF also assigned
two special agents -- Herbert Byerly and Jane Hefner [FN1420]-- to
assist the USAO.  Various accounts were provided to investigators
as to who was responsible for assigning the marshals to assist in
the preparation of the case.  Some individuals, including FBI
members, believe that the U.S. Attorney or someone in that office
had made the request [FN1421] while others insist that Director Henry
Hudson volunteered the services of the marshals.  Hudson told us
that he assigned the marshals to the case sometime in October 
1992 after he had a telephone discussion with Ellsworth during 
which Ellsworth complained about the FBI. [FN1422]  However, according 
to Ellsworth and Howen, Hudson offered the assistance of the 
marshals and they accepted the offer. [FN1423] Lindquist remembers 
the incident differently and believes that he first presented the 
proposal to Tony Perez and that the final acceptance of his proposal 
occurred during an October 1992 meeting with Hudson. [FN1424]<p>
     In addition to who precipitated the inclusion of the Marshals
Service and the BATF in the case of preparation, was the issue of
why it was necessary to include them.  The perception among some
was that the USAO was unhappy with the performance and attitude of
the FBI including their refusal to have case agents cover leads
[FN1425] and their failure to accomplish the tasks assigned them. 
[FN1426] Howen insisted that the decision to bring the marshals 
into the case had nothing to do with any disagreement with the FBI 
but rather was because the USAO needed the help. [FN1427] Ellsworth,
who maintained that he had always envisioned the BATF and the 
Marshals Service as having a role in the Weaver case, agreed 
that the decision was influenced by the need for more assistance in
preparing the case.  He was also concerned that the FBI decision to
send leads to conduct out of state interviews indicated that they
were not devoting enough resources to the matter.  He was
particularly concerned because the agents, in contrast to the
marshals, were not based in Boise but rather hundreds of miles away
in Northern Idaho.  Furthermore, the availability of Venkus was
potentially threatened by the demands created by the illness of his
mother.[FN1428]  Lindquist stated that in addition to needing more
help, [FN1429] the presence of the marshals and the BATF agents
demonstrated to the jury a united effort by the government.[FN1430]
Rampton disagreed that the USAO needed the help and maintained 
that there was insufficient work for all of these agents. [FN1431]<p>
     The FBI was also displeased by the failure of the USAO to
consult with them and to inform them of the decision until after
the agents had begun working in Boise.  Ellsworth could not recall
how the FBI was informed about the addition of the marshals.  He
argued that the marshals were always a part of the case and,
indeed, their involvement had preceded that of the FBI.  He
believed that the only change was that two marshals were being
brought in to substitute for Cooper and Hunt who had an obvious
conflict since they were witnesses to the events at issue. [FN1432] 
Howen did not have a clear recollection of how he informed Venkus
and Rampton but suspected it was about the same time that he told
them that they were going to be working together as a team with the
USAO as the chief decision maker. [FN1433]  Lindquist believes that he
told Venkus and Rampton that he had asked the Marshals Service
about providing marshals to assist in the case preparation and that
they were being made available. [FN1434]<p>
     When Rampton first learned that the marshals would be working
on the case he expressed his concern to Lindquist.  According to
Rampton, Lindquist responded that the decision had already been
made and that it was not a Bureau decision.  Later Rampton learned
that the marshals had been in Boise for a week and had been
conferring with the Howen and Lindquist at the time that he first
learned that they would be working on the case. [FN1435]  Dillon 
said that when he called Lindquist and voiced his displeasure, 
Lindquist responded that he did not have to tell Dillon anything 
and that "you guys can't work with anyone." [FN1436] Thereafter, 
Glenn sent Ellsworth a letter protesting the bringing in of the 
marshals to which Ellsworth responded. [FN1437] Rampton stated that 
BATF Agent Byerly was also brought into the investigation without
the knowledge of the FBI. [FN1438]<p>
     With the addition of the marshals and BATF agents to the team,
issues also arose as to what tasks these agents would be performing
and to whom they would be reporting.  Some in the FBI initially
understood that these agents would be assisting in case preparation
but would not be conducting any investigatory activities. [FN1439] 
According to Hudson, Ellsworth told him that he wanted the deputy
marshals to participate in conducting the investigation.  Hudson
expressed reservations about this plan because he did not believe
that any statutory authority existed for this role and he was
concerned that Ellsworth might use the deputy marshals as leverage
against the FBI.  To guard against such a result, Hudson had Duke
Smith work out the details with Mike Dillon with the understanding
that the marshals were to support the FBI but receive their
instructions from the USAO. [FN1440]  Deputy Marshal Stafford had a
somewhat different understanding.  He believed that his
responsibilities would include conducting interviews, locating
witnesses and preparing backgrounds of the defendants. [FN1441]  
Rampton said that Lindquist told him that the marshals would do 
whatever came up in the investigation. [FN1442]  Ellsworth agreed 
with this statement and acknowledged that he had initially 
envisioned that the marshals might be conducting 
interviews. [FN1443]<p>
     The FBI officials always considered the Bureau to be the lead
investigative agency.  Accordingly, it believed that the other
agents would report to and through them.  For example, it was
Rampton's initial understanding that the Marshals Service had
assured Dillon that the marshals would be assigned to the FBI. 
Rampton said this plan was never followed. [FN1444] Dillon told 
Venkus that FBI Headquarters had confirmed that the marshals were 
to report to the FBI and were not to conduct any investigation or
interviews without the approval and knowledge of the FBI. [FN1443]
When the FBI realized that the USAO was adamant that the FBI would
not be the lead agency and that the other agents would not report
through it, the FBI was outraged and responded that it was "their
investigation" and that "they would proceed as they deemed
necessary." [FN1446]<p>
     Chief Deputy Marshal Ronald Evans originally understood that
Masaitis and Stafford would be assisting FBI case agents Venkus and
Rampton. [FN1447]  However, Hudson stated that while the marshals would
be assisting the efforts of the FBI he intended that they would
receive their orders from the USAO. [FN1448]  Stafford was told by his
superiors that he would be working as a team member with the FBI as
opposed to working for the FBI. [FN1449]  Similarly, Masaitis was told
that he was being assigned to assist the USAO and was never told
that he would be working under FBI direction. [FN1450]<p>
     Howen and Lindquist always intended the agents to work on
teams as equal partners and to report directly to them not
through the FBI. [FN1451]  The plan was for each of the agencies to be
responsible for three counts of the indictment as well as some of
the overt acts of the conspiracy. [FN1452]  Howen anticipated that the
Marshals Service and the BATF agents would assist in case
preparation as well as perform some investigatory tasks. [FN1453] 
However, Howen stated that the FBI resisted this approach and
wanted to be a "buffer" between the USAO and the other
agencies. [FN1454]  Ellsworth did not have a clear recollection on this
issue but thought that there may have been an initial understanding
that the FBI case agents would be the intermediary between the USAO
and the marshals. [FN1455]<p>
     The FBI also questioned the jurisdictional authority of the
Marshals Service to be investigating certain counts of the
indictment.  Glenn maintained that the FBI had primary jurisdiction
over all counts in the indictment because the assault on a federal
officer charges were the main offenses alleged in the indictment
and the other charges were "lesser included offenses."  In this
regard, Glenn argued that "[t]he FBI has always retained primary
jurisdiction when other crimes have arisen out of a substantive
violation over which the FBI has jurisdiction" and that [i]t would
not be cost effective to include numerous agencies whenever an
investigation results in lesser included offenses." [FN1456] 
Ellsworth noted in his response to Glenn that he was correct that 
the FBI had primary investigative jurisdiction over the federal 
officer assault count but reminded Glenn that the FBI did not have
exclusive jurisdiction over all counts in the indictment. Ellsworth
accused Glenn of being myopic when he advocated that the FBI had 
exclusive jurisdiction since the other agencies had a vested 
interest in the case and should be permitted to participate "on 
the same footing as the Bureau.' [FN1457]<p>
                    (3) The First Team Meeting<p>
     Howen and Lindquist convened the first team meeting in Post
Falls, Idaho on October 30, 1992. [FN1458]  The parties memories 
differ somewhat as to the tone of this first meeting and what was
discussed.  Howen and BATF Agent Byerly recalled it as an
organizational meeting where the team approach was discussed and
responsibilities were assigned for the various counts of the
indictment and the overt acts of the conspiracy. [FN1459] Byerly
thought that all participants were enthusiastic at this first
meeting. [FN1460]  Deputy Marshal Stafford had a different 
impression. He recalled FBI agents Venkus and Rampton as being 
"very formal and chilly." [FN1461]  Deputy Marshal Masaitis 
sensed that Rampton and Venkus were unhappy about the Marshals 
Service being involved in the case. [FN1462]  Venkus told 
investigators that it was not until he arrived at the meeting 
that he realized that BATF Agent Byerly would also be assisting 
in the case preparation. [FN1463]<p>
     Among the topics discussed at the first meeting were the
organization of the case preparation effort and the
responsibilities of the individual team members.  Howen and
Lindquist informed the agents that each agency would be responsible
for three counts of the indictment and for some of the overt acts
alleged in the conspiracy.  The BATF was responsible for the
original gun charges; the Marshals Service was responsible for the
failure to appear charge; and the FBI was responsible for the
assault of a federal officer charge.  The agents were to work in
teams and to report to Howen or Lindquist. [FN1464]<p>
     Another subject discussed was the conducting of interviews in
Iowa.  Rampton recalled that Howen indicated the need to do
additional interviews in order to develop information that could be
presented to the grand jury.  Rampton interpreted these comments as
a request and sent a teletype asking that leads be sent.<p>
<H4>b.   Specific Problems in Case Preparation
Interviews Conducted by the Marshals Service
and BATF Agents</H4><p>
     During the pretrial period, members of the investigative team
had several discussions concerning the conducting of out of state
interviews and whether these interviews should be documented. 
Lindquist recalled Howen expressing concern that if these
interviews were documented that they would have to be produced
under the open discovery policy and such a disclosure would alert
the defense to the manner in which the prosecution was preparing
its case.  According to Lindquist, Howen then asked the FBI case
agents if they could conduct an inquiry without generating a report
and then review the substance of the interview with him to
determine if any exculpatory or otherwise discoverable information
had been learned.  Lindquist understood that if such information
had been discovered Howen intended to have a report written and to
produce the information to the defense.  Lindquist recalled that
Rampton and Venkus stated that such an approach was "probably" not
a bad idea but that Bureau policy required them to generate a 302. 
At that point, Stafford and Masaitis stated that they were not
mandated to create such forms and would be able to proceed as 
Howen had proposed. [FN1465] Lindquist had no problem with the 
approach because he was convinced of Howen's integrity and knew 
that if any Brady material were uncovered that Howen would 
produce it. [FN1466] <p>
  At some point, Masaitis remembered that after FBI agents
had conducted some interviews in Iowa and obtained negative
results, the USAO suggested that Stafford interview these
witnesses again. The FBI opposed the suggestion. [FN1467] 
Stafford suggested at the team meeting that he "conduct [the]
investigation like cases [he] had worked as a pre trial
investigative arm of the United States Attorney's Office in the
past." Stafford said he tried "to prepare witnesses to talk to
the U.S. Attorney prior to trial and not write reports on it.~ 
According to Stafford, it is the normal practice of the U.S.
Marshal`Marshal's Service when "doing a case" to document
interviews and information acquired for lead purposes. However,
if they are assisting the U.S. Attorney's Office in preparing a
case for trial or the grand jury, that form is not used. [FN1468] 
Stafford claimed that Howen and Lindquist reacted favorably to
this suggestion. [FN1469] He does not recall them stating that
it would be "a good idea not to produce paper." [FN1470] <p>
  Venkus recalled that in one team meeting Stafford told
the participants that he could conduct an interview without
creating discoverable documentation. In response, Venkus
advised Stafford that this was contrary to FBI policy and that
he disagreed with the suggestion. Venkus thought that Stafford
prided himself on not having to create paper like the FBI. fn
1471 <p>
  Rampton thought that the documentation issue was first
raised by Howen and Lindquist. He stated that they wanted
investigation done, especially in Iowa, and that they did not
want any interview documentation created so as to avoid having
to produce it in discovery. Because of the FBI's practice of
documenting all interviews with a 302, Rampton stated that Howen
and Lindquist decided that the marshals would do the Iowa
interview since they had "volunteered" not to produce paper on
the interview. Rampton expressed concern about this plan to
Dillon, as well as to Howen and Lindquist. Thereafter, Howen
and Lindquist qualified their instructions to the FBI and said
that they should continue to document their interviews as they
had in the past. [FN1472] Rampton had suggested tot Howen that
FBI agents in Iowa do the interviews and then, if necessary,
Howen, who wanted to participate in the interviews, could do a
followup. According to Rampton, Howen and Lindquist wanted the
marshals to do the Iowa interviews and Rampton disagreed,
stating that those interviews were an FBI function. [FN1473] <p>
  Howen stated that when it became apparent to him that the
FBI would not allow its case agents to conduct the out of state
interviews, he thought that perhaps the marshals could do it. 
He then asked Stafford if he could conduct the interviews and
whether he was required to prepare written documentation. 
Stafford told Howen that he could conduct the interviews and
that he was not required to document it. [FN1474] Thereafter,
Howen had the marshals and the BATF agent serve subpoenas and
conduct witness interviews. <p>
  Stafford said that Howen and Lindquist asked him to serve
approximately 100 subpoenas and to conduct interviews of
individuals in Iowa, Northern Idaho, Oregon, Spokane, Washington
and Denver, Colorado. [FN1475] Most of these interviews were
conducted in Iowa. Stafford thought that the FBI did not want
to participate in these interviews because they had other things
to do. However, he did not know whether the FBI agents had ever
been asked to conduct the interviews. [FN1476] He did believe
that the FBI agents knew what he would be doing since before he
left to conduct the Iowa interviews he informed Mike Dillon about
his anticipated activities. [FN1477] <p>
  While serving subpoenas, Stafford said he would conduct
interview of those individuals being served. One such interview
was of Howard Brashure in Iowa who was developed as an
informant/witness. [FN1478] Stafford explained that because
this was a high profile case, identifying information about the
witness was not placed on the subpoena but rather on a separate
sheet of paper attached to the subpoena. [FN1479] Stafford
wrote down on this sheet any information that he received during
the interview that he judged to be important as well as
providing his impression of the person as a witness. 
Thereafter, he mailed the sheets back to the U.S. Attorney's
Office. Stafford did not know whether any of these sheets were
ever produced to the defense although he said he was not aware
of any exculpatory material not being turned over to the
defense. [FN1480] A review of the discovery records in the
Weaver case revealed that other than the cryptic notes on some
of the subpoena cover sheets, Stafford did not document these
interviews and that these sheets were not produced in discovery. <p>
  Howen said that Stafford knew whom to interview based on
the subpoenas that were given to him. According to Howen, the
goal was to ask questions that would determine whether a person
should or should not be a witness. [FN1481] Howen told
investigators that he did not instruct Stafford to as specific
questions of the subpoenaed parties but rather informed him of
general subject areas that were important to case development. 
These areas included: the Weavers' activities primarily during
the 1983-85 time period; any information about Weaver's alleged
plan to build a 300 yard kill zone; and identifying any other
witnesses who might be helpful and Howen might want to interview
personally. [FN1482] When Stafford returned from serving the
subpoenas he would brief Howen on the information that he had 
learned. [FN1483] Howen insisted that he never instructed
Stafford no to create documentation but rather used Stafford
because he understood that it was the policy of the Marshals
Service not to create documentation for this type of interview. 
fn 1484 Howen never discussed with Stafford what constituted
exculpatory information nor did Stafford ever raise the issue. 
Howen assumed that Stafford understood the nature of exculpatory
information based upon his experience in the Marshals Service. 
Howen never remembered Stafford conveying to him any exculpatory
information from the interviews conducted in Iowa. [FN1485] <p>
  Lindquist stated that Howen was primarily responsible for
giving Stafford any instructions regarding the serving of the
subpoenas and the interview questions to be asked. [FN1486] To
the extent that Lindquist gave Stafford instructions, they were
general in nature and intended to obtain information that would
reveal the type of person that Weaver was. [FN1487] Lindquist
did not recall any specific instructions given concerning the
documentation of these interviews although he assumed that the
documentation issue had been resolved at the earlier meeting. 
[FN1488] It was not until before trial that Lindquist learned
who had been interviewed in Iowa. [FN1489] <p>
  BATF Agent Byerly did not conduct any interviews in Iowa. 
[FN1490] However, he did participate with Stafford, BATF Agent
Gunderson, Deputy Marshal Hunt and Sheriff Whittaker in serving
subpoenas on 20-40 people in Northern Idaho [FN1491] who 
were neighbors of the Weavers and in conducting "related
interviews." [FN1492] Byerly could not recall Howen or
Lindquist requesting them to conduct interviews without
documenting them. [FN1493] With regard to the interviews that
Byerly conducted, he told investigators that he told the witness
"to tell the truth and cooperate with both the prosecution and
the defense." [FN1494] Of the conversations that he had with
witnesses, Byerly said he prepared approximately five or six
interview reports. His criterion for whether an interview
report was necessary was whether the new information would help
the prosecution or the defense. [FN1495] <p>
  Masaitis did not conduct any interviews in Iowa but did
conduct several interviews while assisting the USAO. Because
none of these interviews produced any positive information,
Masaitis did not document them. Masaitis said it is his
practice to only document an interview if significant
information is developed. He denied that the USAO ever
instructed him not to document the interviews. [FN1496] 
Masaitis never considered his actions "as conducting
investigation." [FN1497] <p>
  Rampton and Venkus said that they were never informed
about when the Iowa interviews were conducted or about the
results of these interviews. Indeed, it was not until later
that the FBI case agents learned of them. [FN1498] Glenn did
not learn about these interviews until after the trial 
when the case agents told him that some of these interviews 
had been conducted without their knowledge. [FN1499] Rampton 
said that the Iowa interviews were done primarily to support 
the conspiracy count but also developed information to 
support other counts. [FN1500] He did not know whether these 
interviews produced any exculpatory information. [FN1501] <p>
  There is no record of what the Iowa witnesses told
Stafford. Howen insisted that if these interviews had produced
exculpatory information he would have produced it to the
defense. [FN1502] To the extent that he was informed of the
information, Lindquist never learned of any Brady information
being disclosed in these interviews. [FN1503] Although Venkus
did not know the specifics of what Stafford had learned in the
interviews, he suspected that some of it was of significance. 
For example, he recalled hearing Stafford discussing
"voluminous" information that a witness had given him about the
John Todd tapes and the concept of "Illuminating." Venkus
believed that Stafford viewed the Todd tapes as a critical link
in the proof required to show the origins of Weaver's alleged
conspiracy. [FN1504] <p>
  (2) Acoustical Test <p>
  The marshals involved in the August 21, 1992 shooting at
Ruby Ridge reported receiving a hundred or more incoming rounds. 
However, investigators recovered far fewer bulled casings. Some
theorized that echoes may have caused it to sound as if more
rounds had been fired. Another important issues in the case was
who fired the first shot. Deputy Marshal Norris had reported
hearing a shot that sounded like it came from the type of gun
that Roderick and Degan were carrying. This conflicted with
Cooper's version of events which was that Harris had fired the
first shot. Thereafter, the USAO and members of the 
investigative team discussed the need to conduct an acoustical
test to explain these arguably conflicting findings. [FN1505] <p>
  Lindquist believed that he first identified the need to
consider whether an acoustical test should be conducted. [FN1506]
He recalled discussing the issue and that he and Rampton
took some steps to determine if there was an expert at the FBI
that would address the issue. At some point, Lindquist recalled
discussing the issue with someone and the FBI laboratory. He
remembered that this individual thought that it would be
difficult to control the environment sufficiently so as to be
confident that the were duplicating the acoustical reality as it
existed on August 21, 1992. [FN1507] Lindquist recalled that he
was not completely satisfied with the response given by the
individual from the FBI lab and had the impression that the
individual had not given adequate consideration to his
questions. Soon thereafter, Lindquist spoke with a federal
prosecutor in Los Angeles who confirmed that it was difficult to
control all of the factors so as to be comfortable with the
accuracy of an acoustical test. [FN1508] Thereafter, Lindquist
suggested to a team member that when they accompanied Lucian
Haag to Ruby Ridge to work on the shooting reconstruction that
they might want to fire a few rounds to see what they heard. 
Thereafter, he understood that this was done and that those
present could reach no conclusions as to the effect of echoes or
whether it was possible to distinguish the weapons being fired. 
fn 1509 <p>
  Rampton confirmed that on approximately October 21, 1992,
he had discussed with Lindquist the need to have and acoustical
test conducted to determine what echoes or reverberations were
caused by the firing of weapons like those involved in the
August 21st shootings. Thereafter, Rampton communicated with
the FBI Laboratory about having the test conducted. [FN1510] 
Following this initial contact, Rampton and Lindquist had
several phone conversations with Supervisory Special Agent Bruce
Koenig who was assigned to the FBI's Engineering Research
Facility in Quantico, Virginia, about the feasibility of
conducting an acoustical analysis of the gunshots fired at the
top of the mountain at Ruby Ridge. Koenig understood that the
Assistant U.S. Attorney with whom he spoke was anxious to 
determine if echoes could have accounted for the difference 
between the number of shots heard by the marshals and the 
number of casings found. He told the attorney that certain 
structures such as cliffs would cause echoes and recommended 
positioning listeners at the various locations where the 
marshals reported being and then firing multiple shots in 
various directions and from various locations to listen 
to the effect. Koenig told the attorney that he was
willing to travel to Ruby Ridge and conduct the test firings. 
Indeed, arrangements were made for Koenig and his team to fly to
Idaho but at the last minute either Rampton or the attorney
contacted him and told him that the trip was unnecessary because
they had conducted the tests and no echoes were heard. [FN1511] <p>
  Masaitis recalled learning that the FBI had expressed
some resistance to conducting the test. The other team members
then explored the option of hiring an expert to conduct the test
but learned that this option would be too costly. At that
point, they decided to conduct their own informal experiment. 
[FN1512] <p>
  At the end of October, Howen, Stafford, Masaitis, Hunt
and Bruce Whittaker from the Boundary County Sheriff Department
travelled to Ruby Ridge to participate in an acoustical test
which consisted of firing weapons similar to those belonging to
the marshals involved in the August 21st shooting. Stafford
believes that Venkus and Rampton were asked to accompany the
group but did not do so. [FN1513] Once everyone assumed their
positions, Masaitis fired some rounds from the rock outcropping
adjacent to the Weaver house while Hunt was down by the & areas. 
fn 1514 Shots were also fired from the & and the area where
Sammy started his retreat back to the cabin. [FN1515] Howen
could not recall if the marshals present made any comments about
how the shots sounded. [FN1516] Although Masaitis could not hear
echoes because he was firing the gun, he recalled that someone
had stated that they had heard echoes. [FN1517] All parties
involved in this test stated that no record, either audio or
written, was produced. [FN1518] <p>
  At the initial team meeting on October 30, 1992,
Lindquist announced that the test had been completed and that
the FBI laboratory did not need to conduct the examination.[FN1519]
He was not aware that at the time Rampton was still in the
process of locating an FBI expert to conduct an acoustical test. 
[FN1520] Rampton, who was informed of this acoustical experiment
after it had been completed, was surprised by the unscientific
methodology used. [FN1521] Howen explained that he decided not
to pursue an expert opinion since he questioned whether an
expert would be able to provide an accurate opinion since any
test that he would conduct would be after the leaves had fallen
from the deciduous trees thus rendering the conditions different
from those present at Ruby Ridge on August 21, 1992. [FN1522] <p>
  The USAO never informed defense counsel about this
experiment. [FN1523] Lindquist explained that he did not think
this rudimentary experiment, which used neither an expert or
equipment, constituted the type of activity that was required to
be disclosed under Fed. R. Crim. P. 16. He characterized their
activities as "preliminary" to see if a formal test might be
warranted. [FN1524] Howen agreed this was not a test and was 
something that anyone, including the defense, could have
conducted. [FN1525] <p>
  (3) Cooperation and Trust Among Trial Team Members <p>
   (i) Historical Problems in the Working Relationship Between 
the USAO and the FBI <p>
  Almost everyone questioned about the subject agreed that
the USAO and FBI experienced numerous problems in their working
relationship during the Weaver prosecution. However, these
problems did not originate with the Weaver matter but rather
appear to have been developing over a number of years. Indeed,
many individuals in the USAO and the FBI agreed that the two
agencies had a history of a poor relationship which deteriorated
further in the Weaver matter. <p>
  From the FBI perspective, Supervisory Special Agent
Dillon felt that there were numerous incidents which contributed
to the problems. He stated that one factor was Howen's
personality which because noticeably hostile to the FBI after
the prosecution of Randy Baldwin. [FN1526] Dillon characterized
Howen's personality after the Baldwin case as being "very
pompous and condescending." Problems between Howen and the Fbi
continued when the two offices strongly disagreed over whether a
local sheriff from Shoshone County should be prosecuted for
public corruption. The FBI ultimately presented the case to the
Department of Justice for consideration. Thereafter, the Public
Integrity Section of the Criminal Division of the Department of
Justice prosecuted the matter -- the first trial ended in a hung
jury while the second trial ended with an acquittal. According
to Dillon, Howen and Ellsworth were extremely upset over the
handling of that case. [FN1527] Dillon told investigators that
one major criticism that he and others had about Howen was that
he would discuss and issue with the FBI or give an instruction
to the FBI and then later forget the discussion or having given
the instruction. Howen would then portray the FBI action as
being contrary to his wishes. Dillon gave as an example a 1990
case involving the arrest of Aryan Nation members with the
arrest scenario proposed by the FBI. According to Dillon, 
Howen repeatedly complained "who was working for who" [FN1528] <p>
  Special Agent in Charge Glenn reported that the
relationship between the USAO and the FBI had been strained for
"some time" and "seemed to deteriorate" further with the Weaver
prosecution. as examples of prior disagreements between the two
offices he pointed to several cases in which the USAO had
concluded that a case lacked prosecutive merit but subsequent
review by the Department of Justice had concluded otherwise.
[FN1529] <p>
  U.S. Attorney Ellsworth agreed that the relationship
between the USAO and Glenn and Dillon had not been the best. He
attributed this problem in part to the case involving the
Shoshone County Sheriff. Although the two offices managed to
work together on matters, Ellsworth stated that the relationship
was one characterized "by pleasantries and ... cordiality at a
very superficial surface level ... but one where we never really
... were able to ... deal with hard issues. [FN1530] Lindquist
was the only member of the USAO and the FBI who stated that
there was not a history of problems between the USAO and the
FBI. Lindquist insisted that the Weaver case was an anomaly and
that before and after the Weaver case he has had a "marvelous
relationship" with the FBI. [FN1531] To the extent there existed
any bad blood" between the FBI and the USAO he characterized it
as "bad blood" between Ellsworth and Dillon who did not get
along. [FN1532] this statement seems inconsistent with the
statements of other individuals interviewed including Special
Agent Wayne F. Manis who provided a 13-page chronology of a
problem that he had with Lindquist which indicated Lindquist's
knowledge of the animosity between the USAO, especially USA
Ellsworth, and Dillon and Glenn that had occurred over the
handling of the prosecution of the Shoshone County Sheriff.
[FN1533] <p>
  Officials at FBI headquarters were aware that there were
problems in the working relationship between the USAO and the
local and district offices of the FBI. This knowledge was based 
largely on the controversy over the public corruption case
involving the Shoshone County Sheriff. [GARRITY] [FN1534] Other
than this incident, we found no indication that FBI Headquarters
had intervened. <p>
   (ii) Problems in the Working Relationship Among Team Members <p>
  From the moment that the USAO and the FBI began working
on the Weaver case problems surfaced in their historical
hostilities. Much of the difficulty can be traced to their
negative perceptions that each agency had developed from working
together on prior matters. The USAO found the FBI to be very
inflexible and inextricably attached to the idea of being the
lead agency and exercising total control over any investigative
task in the case. In addition, the prosecutors were critical of
the unwillingness of the FBI to become a "team player." Howen
noted a significant difference between the attitude of members
of the Marshals Service and members of the FBI. He found the
former to be open, flexible and willing to assist with case
preparation in any way that they wee needed while he found the
FBI to be uncooperative and unwilling to volunteer information. 
[FN1535] Similarly, Lindquist characterized the Marshals Service
and BATF as "very open, very cooperative, very accessible" in
contrast to the FBI which he characterized as a "brick wall." 
[FN1536] Ellsworth attributed part of the difficulties between
the USAO and the FBI to the FBI mentality that "the FBI way is
always right." [FN1537] The FBI case agents found the USAO to
be very controlling and unwilling to include them in the case
preparation process. In addition, the FBI criticized the
prosecutors for being to autocratic, abrasive and
confrontational. <p>
  While preparing the case for trial, there were a number
of incidents that contributed to the negative perception that
each agency had of the other. For example, early in the case,
Lindquist learned that the FBI had issued a directive to the
case agents that they were only to take instructions from
Ellsworth. This directive also required Howen to transmit in
writing to the agents any leads or investigative requests that
he wanted pursued. Apparently this directive was the result of
several incidents including the inclusion of the marshals on the
trial team and the miscommunication concerning the sending of 
leads to Iowa. Lindquist and Ellsworth were very angered by this
directive and contacted the Terrorism and violent Crime Section
of the Department of Justice. Lindquist believed that they
intervened and had the directive revoked. [FN1538] The USAO was
also troubled by the resistance that the FBI showed to the
discovery obligations of the prosecution and to the USAO request
for expert assistance from the FBI Laboratory. [FN1539] <p>
  From the FBI perspective, they were quite upset with how
the USAO was handling the Weaver prosecution including: the
decision to bring the Marshals Service and BATF into the case,
the USAO opposition to sending leads to conduct the Iowa
interviews, [FN1540] the broad scope of the indictment and the
open discovery policy followed by the USAO. Other issues that
concerned the FBI included the debate over the need to transport
the birthing shed from Ruby Ridge to Boise for use at the trial,
criticism voiced by other team members about the FBI crime scene
search and the USAO treatment of FBI members. [FN1541] <p>
  The FBI case agents assigned to the Weaver matter
complained that they felt isolated from the activities of the
other team members. For example, Rampton complained that he was
unaware of the projects on which the marshals were working in
part because they were creating no documentation of their
activities. [FN1542] In addition, the FBI case agents believed
that efforts were taken to exclude them from team meetings and
other team activities. <p>
  Lindquist denied that they intentionally excluded FBI
members from meetings or activities but acknowledged that there
may have been occasions where teams or subteams met without the
other group members. [FN1544] Howen tried to conduct a team
meeting every two or three weeks. He insisted that everyone was
invited and notified of these meetings to discuss matters on
which a particular subteam was working. [FN1545] Both Howen and
Lindquist denied ever instructing the marshals or the BATF
agents to conduct some type of investigative activity and not
inform the FBI about it. [FN1546] Ellsworth suggested that the
reason that the FBI agents felt excluded and believed that the
marshals had a more active role than they did was because the
FBI agents were somewhat physically isolated because they were 
not always in Boise. [FN1547] <p>
  In addition to the problems that they attributed to the
USAO, the FBI agents also detected hostility and a lack of
cooperation from other team members, most notably the marshals. 
For example, although they made their files available to the
other agencies to assist in case preparation, the FBI case
agents did no feel that the other agencies reciprocated. 1548 
The FBI case agents also recognized that the marshals assigned
to the case were sensitive to any remarks or actions by the FBI
that seemed to question the truthfulness of statements made by
Deputy Marshals Cooper and Roderick. For example, at some
point, Venkus and Rampton discussed the possibility that Degan
may have been moving as he fired his weapon since the spent
cartridges from Degan's gun were spread over 22 feet. This
theory was contrary to the marshals' account that Degan had not
fired his weapon. When Rampton presented this theory, he
recalled Masaitis becoming very upset, stating that he did no
have to listen to this and then leaving the discussion. 
Thereafter, Rampton informed Howen that he was going to send
Degan's gun for an ejection pattern test to determine how far
the spent shells would be ejected. Rampton insisted that Howen
concurred with the plan but later failed to acknowledge his
approval thereby making it look as if Rampton had taken this
action on his own. [FN1549] Several weeks later, Rampton
recalled that Howen met with him and asked if he felt that he
could continue as a team member considering the hostility he had
created by questioning the veracity of Cooper. Rampton insisted
that he was not accusing Cooper of lying but only wanted the
team to focus on a possible conflict between the physical
evidence and Cooper's statement that Degan had not fired his
gun. [FN1550] <p>
  From the perspective of the marshals, Stafford was
troubled by Rampton's questioning of the truthfulness of the
Cooper and Roderick statements regarding who fired the first
shot. Stafford felt that when Rampton characterized these
statements as being "less than truthful" he was suggesting that
Cooper and Roderick had "purposely" omitted some information. 
[FN1551]  Another incident that angered the marshals concerned the
inaccuracies that appeared in the FBI draft of the Cooper FD-
302. [FN1552] <p>
  The other team members were aware that the FBI agents
were having difficulty integrating into the team and that
discord existed between them and the FBI agents. For example,
after the first meeting, Stafford perceived that the FBI case
agents were not greatly involved in the case and that they did
not appear to attend very many of the meetings. [FN1553] He
characterized the behavior of the FBI on the case as lacking
initiative and response [FN1554] yet he admitted that he had no
knowledge of the FBI ever refusing to do an investigative task
in this matter. However, he stated that he knew of instances in
which work was assigned to FBI agents but was not completed. 
[FN1555] <p>
  Another team member, BATF Agent Byerly attributed the
discord between the FBI and other team members to "the
reluctance by the FBI to attempt techniques beyond the norm,"
and the resistance of the FBI to release certain documents and
information to the USAO. [FN1556] Byerly was never aware of any
attempts to exclude a team member from a meeting or to withhold
the existence or the results of an investigative activity from
another team member. [FN1557] According to Byerly, any
disagreements related to issues involving investigative
techniques and proposed approaches to supporting the
government's case such as the proposed reconstruction of the
shooting scene. [FN1558] <p>
  According to Howen, throughout the case preparation and
trial period, issues continually arose that created discord
between the FBI and the Marshals Service. In his words, the
problem "never got better." [FN1559] Howen took no specific
actions to diffuse the hostility other than to try to listen to 
all sides and allow them equal input into issues. [FN1560] 
Howen also attributed some of the discord between the FBI and
the Marshals Service to an attitude which he believes is
pervasive in the FBI which is that they are the premier
investigative agency and that the other federal agencies are
inferior. There was also a perception among the Marshals
Service members of the team that the FBI had made many errors in
their handling of the crime scene, including the triangulation
issue [FN1561], and that their efforts would have been better if
it had been an FBI agent who had been killed. The discovery of
a document prepared by the FBI that was highly critical of the
Marshals Service actions in the Weaver case further deteriorated
the relationship between the case agents and the FBI. [FN1562] <p>
  Lindquist attributed the disagreements with the FBI to
the actions and directives of upper management officials and
their failure to communicated with the prosecutors. He believed
that the difficulties that they experienced communicating with
the decision makers in the FBI were due to the command structure
of the FBI and their refusal to communicate with those not at a
comparable rank. [FN1563] To the extent that disagreements
arose between him and the case agents, they were always able to
resolve them except when upper management became involved and
issued orders as to the position to take. [FN1564] Lindquist
said he believed that the FBI case agents were confronted with
the dilemma of wanting to perform their jobs but being required
to adhere to the FBI position on issues such as the lead agency
concept and the sending out of leads. By the early part of
1993, Lindquist thought that the FBI case agents were working
well with the others on preparing the case for trial. [FN1565] <p>
  (4) Attempts to Interview FBI Officials at Headquarters <p>
  As part of their case preparations, Howen and Lindquist
wanted to interview FBI officials who were involved in the
deployment and instruction of the Hostage Rescue Team ("HRT")
and in the formulation and modification of the rules of
engagement. Among the individuals that they wanted to interview
were Danny Coulson, Larry Potts and Mike Kahoe. Howen and
Lindquist identified two separate occasions when they
unsuccessfully sought to interview these individuals. The first
occurred in October 1992 when the prosecutors came to Washington
to meet with DOJ officials and the Marshals Service. [FN1566] 
According to Howen, they had provided advance notice to the FBI
that they were going to be in Washington and wanted to interview
these officials. However, when they arrived in Washington and
contacted the FBI, they were informed that the FBI officials
were unavailable. [FN1567] Neither prosecutor made the
interview arrangements. Howen did not know who had set up the
interviews with the FBI but speculated that it was Dillon or
Rampton [FN1568] while Lindquist believed that the Terrorism and
Violent Crime Section at the Department of Justice had made the
arrangements for a specific day. [FN1569] <p>
  The second time that Howen and Lindquist were
unsuccessful in interviewing the headquarters officials was
sometime in early March 1993. Although Howen could not recall
what, if any, prior arrangements had been made to conduct the
interviews, [FN1570] Lindquist believed that specific times and
been set for these interviews. [FN1571] Lindquist stated that
when they arrived they were told that the FBI officials were
unavailable. It was his impression that they were being "put
off." [FN1572] <p>
  In a March 17, 1993 memorandum, Dana Biehl mentioned that
the prosecutors expressed a need to interview Potts, Kahoe,
Coulson, Uda and Apple. [FN1573] On the next day, James
Reynolds informed Mark Richard, Deputy Assistant Attorney
General of the Criminal Division, of the need of the prosecutors
to interview these individuals. In addition, Reynolds noted
that when the prosecutors had been in town the previous week,
the FBI had declined to make them available until the Waco
standoff was resolved. Reynolds opined that this position was
unacceptable. [FN1574] He told investigators that his
impression was that Howen and Lindquist had not made advance
appointments with the FBI officials. [FN1575] Mary Incontro
told investigators that when the interview request was made
almost everyone was involved with the WACO crisis. She added
that the FBI always indicated a willingness to meet with the
prosecutors. [FN1576] <p>
  Thereafter, Reynolds attempted to arrange interviews with
the FBI officials. The FBI agreed to make the officials
available on two or three consecutive days between the hours of
7:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. When Reynolds informed Lindquist of this
proposal, Lindquist responded that they had been in Washington
two weeks ago and now the FBI officials could come to Boise. In
a later call, Howen and Lindquist indicated that they would try
to complete the interviews during a one week recess in late
April 1993. [FN1577] Howen said he may have conducted one or
two interviews by phone but that the time demands of the trial
caused him to abandon further telephone interviews. [FN1578] <p>

  <H3>3. Discussion </H3><p>
   <H4>a. Decision to Have the Marshals Service and BATF   
Assist in Case Preparation</H4> <p>
  The USAO created great conflict between it and the FBI
when it decided to add the marshals and BATF agents to the trial
preparation team. We find the FBI's actions and attitudes to
have been unjustified and terribly disruptive to the USAO's
trial preparation efforts. Although conflicting evidence exists
as to whether the USAO requested the addition of the marshals to
the trial team or whether the Marshals Service volunteered its
services, we are confident that it was a decision that was
welcomed by both the Marshals Service and the USAO. Perhaps the
USAO could have been more tactful or sensitive in the timing and
manner in which they informed the FBI of this action. However,
we do not consider such a decision to have been one that
required FBI concurrence or approval. We believe that the
decision was appropriate and was certainly one within the
purview of the USAO.   We accept the representations of 
the USAO as to why these agencies were added to 
the trial team, including that they needed additional
assistance in preparing the case for trial. This was a
complicated case that was made dramatically more labor intensive
by the scope of the indictment and the inclusion of the
conspiracy count. Investigative activities needed to be
conducted outside of Boise and large amounts of evidence needed
to be processed, organized and analyzed. We think it was
entirely appropriate for the USAO to turn for assistance to the
Marshals Service and the BATF, both of which had prior
investigative interest and involvement in the case. <p>
  We are troubled by the reaction of the FBI to the
addition of these new members to the trial team and its
tenacious adherence to its position of being the lead agency. 
Such resistance was unjustified, distracted the USAO from its
task of preparing the case for trial, and set a negative tone
for the working relationship between the FBI and the other team
members. <p>
 That the FBI had primary jurisdiction over the assault charges
does not confer power on it to control the entire case. There
was room on the case preparation team for the participation of
other agencies having an interest in the case. Once the case
became the responsibility of the USAO we think that they, not
the FBI, were the appropriate governmental body to control the
direction of the case preparation activities. Although a
component of these activities included additional investigation,
we do not find it inappropriate for the USAO to control and
direct such activities. Indeed, it is the USAO that must
present evidence at trial to satisfy all of the elements of the
charged offenses and to meet the defenses raised by the
defendants. Consequently, we believe that the USAO was in the
best position to assess how to prepare the case for trial. 
Having the FBI function as an intermediary between the USAO and
the other agencies would have added a needless and burdensome
bureaucratic layer. We respect the decision of the USAO not to
have instituted such an approach and are extremely critical of
the rigidity of the FBI on this issue. In our view, the FBI
lost sight of its role as assisting rather than controlling the
actions of the USAO. <p>
   <H4>b. The Iowa Interviews and the Failure to Document
the Results</H4> <p>
  We are not aware of any legal principle or statutory
requirement that requires governmental investigators to document
all of the interviews that they conduct. See United States v.
Martino, 648 F.2d 367, 387 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 456 U.S.
943 (1981). Although the FBI requires its agents to document
their interviews, other governmental agencies do not impose
requirements that are as exacting. In this case, the
prosecutors took advantage of the less restrictive documentation
requirements of the Marshal Service and had the marshals conduct
approximately 100 witness interviews during the serving of
subpoenas. [FN1553] It is our opinion that this practice was
imprudent. <p>
  Under the Brady doctrine the government is required to
disclose to the defense material evidence that is both favorable
to the accused and material to either guilt or punishment. See
United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 676, 682 (1985); Brady v.
Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 87 (1963). This requirement is not
limited to information that is in written form but extends to
oral statements of which the government is aware. See
generally, Carter v. Rafferty, 826 F.2d 1299 (3d Cir. 1987),
cert. denied, 484 U.S. 101 (1988). In addition, the prosecutor
is responsible for producing Brady information which is within
the knowledge of persons working as part of the prosecution team
of intimately connected with the government's case. United
States v. Butler, 567 F.2d 885, 889 (9th Cir. 1978); United
States v. Morell, 524 F.2d 550, 555 (2d Cir. 1975). Although we
discovered no evidence that these interviews produced any
exculpatory information, our inquiry was severely restricted
since no written, audio or video record was created of these
interviews. Without memorializing these interviews, we were
forced to rely on the memories of two individuals: Howen and
Stafford. <p>
  Howen insisted that if these interviews had produced any
exculpatory information that he would have notified defense
counsel. No matter how sincere Howen is on the issue, we are
not comfortable that the interview process in place was adequate
to ensure that exculpatory information was identified. No one
ever instructed the marshals or took steps to ensure that they,
particularly Stafford, understood the type of information that
qualified for production under the Brady rule. Moreover, some
of the notations that Stafford made on the subpoena cover sheets
suggest that significant information might have been learned. 
[FN1584] Although this information may not have been Brady
material, we have no reliable means to comfortably conclude that
it is not. <p>
  Although we recognize that prosecutors may sometimes
participate either directly or indirectly in interviews that are
not documented, we are concerned by the actions of Howen in this
case. Here, we are not talking about one or two undocumented
interviews but rather we are faced with a situation where
approximately 100 interviews were conducted in this manner. 
[FN1585] Although there may be no direct evidence that 
exculpatory information was learned and concealed, we think that
adverse interferences may be drawn by the undocumented interview
process followed in the Weaver prosecution. There were no
reliable safeguards in place to ensure that if exculpatory
information were learned that it would be provided to the
defense. [FN1586] Relying on the memory and judgment,
regardless of how well intentioned, of a marshal who was not
specifically trained or instructed regarding the identification
of exculpatory information, does not suffice. Accordingly, we
find the procedure to be inappropriate and advise against
adopting a similar practice in the future. <p>
    <H4>c. Acoustical Experiment at Ruby Ridge</H4> <p>
  We find nothing improper about the acoustical experiment
that members of the prosecution team conducted in late October
1992 at Ruby Ridge. Indeed, we accept the explanation provided
by Lindquist that it was nothing more than a preliminary attempt
to determine if expert assistance was necessary. The test
firings were not scientifically planned or conducted. Even
Rampton was surprised by the unscientific methodology used. The
test consisted only of the firing of guns at the approximate
locations where the participants of the August 21, 1992 shooting
were located. There were no controls on the experiment or
written findings. Nor, as Howen recognized, was there any way
to duplicate the August 21st conditions since most of the leaves
had fallen from the deciduous trees. <p>
  The test results were clearly not discoverable under Fed.
R. Crim. P. 16(a)(1)(D) for two obvious reasons. [FN1587] First,
the test would not qualify as a scientific test or experiment as
that term is commonly understood. The actions that the
participants took in conducting their rudimentary test did not
utilize modern scientific techniques. [FN1588] Second, Rule 16
has been interpreted as requiring only the disclosure of written
reports and written test results. United States v. Peters, 937
F.2d 1422, 1425 (9th Cir. 1991); United States v. Glaze, 643
F.2d 549, 552 (8th Cir. 1981). The government is under no duty
to turn over informal internal documents, but need only disclose
final results and reports. United States v. Iglesias, 881 F2d
1519, 1523-24 (9th Cir. 1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 1088
(1990). Here, no written results were ever prepared. <p>
  Even if the experiment were not discoverable under Rule
16, the issue remains whether the government should have
disclosed it to the defense as Brady material. We find that
such disclosure was not required. From the evidence produced in
our investigation, we found no indication that the test produced
any type of result that could be properly classified as being
exculpatory in nature. No one present for the test could recall
what, if any, conclusions were reached. Lindquist, who was not
present at the test, recalls hearing that the results were
inconclusive as to the effect of echoes and whether the firing
of different types of guns could have been distinguished. Howen
told investigators that he never gave any consideration to
informing the defense of the acoustical test because he did not 
consider what they were doing to be exculpatory. [FN1589] Moreover,
in our view, the unscientific nature of the test coupled with the
difference in conditions caused by the fallen leaves were
significant variables that would call into question any results
obtained. For all of these reasons, we conclude that the test
did not constitute Brady material. <p>
  <H4>d. Attempts to Interview FBI Officials</H4> <p>
  Although we find the difficulty that the prosecutors
encountered in attempting to interview FBI officials in
Washington to be unfortunate, the evidence was inconclusive that
these officials or others in the FBI were intentionally avoiding
being interviewed. Indeed, we are not convinced that explicit
interview arrangements were ever made. No one was able to
provide us with a satisfactory account of who set up the
interviews, what specific arrangements were made, and what
information was provided to the interviewees. Neither Howen nor
Lindquist had a good sense as to who was making the arrangements
to interview the FBI officials. Nor did the clearly recall
having exact times set during which the interviews would occur. <p>
  Furthermore, none of the FBI officials recalled the first
unsuccessful interview attempt. All denied that they had ever
refused an interview request from the prosecutors. Mary
Incontro indicated that the officials always appeared willing to
meet with the prosecutors. To the extent that these officials
may have been unavailable for interviews during the Waco crisis,
we do not find the excuse to have been a fabrication. These
officials were closely involved in the Waco crisis, were working
long hours and were responsible for monitoring the crisis and
making critical decisions. When James Reynolds contacted them,
they agreed to make themselves available for evening interviews. 
Although perhaps the FBI officials could have shown more
flexibility in accommodating the needs of the prosecutors, we
cannot conclude that their actions were totally without
justification. <p>
  In the future, we would hope that the FBI will work to
facilitate the access of prosecutors to FBI headquarters
officials who are important to the preparation of federal
prosecutions. A system needs to be instituted whereby the local
FBI office either can make firm arrangements for such interviews
or can introduce the prosecutors to the officials so that direct
arrangements may be made. Although we appreciate the continuous
demands made of many FBI officials, they must recognize that
assisting federal prosecutors in preparing their cases for trial
is included among their responsibilities as a member of the
federal law enforcement team. <p>
  <H4>e. Relationship Among the Investigative Team</H4> <p>
  Prior to the beginning of the Weaver case preparation,
problems existed in the working relationship between the FBI and
the USAO. However, the relationship between these two branches
of the department of Justice dramatically deteriorated with the
Weaver prosecution. Although our investigation did not reveal
that either side was intentionally taking actions to aggravate
the other or to sabotage the prosecution, we were dismayed by
the failure of the parties to more actively try to resolve their
disagreements. <p>
  Many of the individuals questioned about the relationship
between the USAO in Boise and the FBI attributed the discord to
a personality clash between the parties involved. [FN1590] 
Some, including Stafford, attributed the problem as being
traceable primarily to the FBI Headquarters and the regional
office in Utah. [FN1591] We agree that some of the difficulties
were probably worsened by personality clashes between members of
the USAO and the FBI. However, we believe that the problem goes
much deeper and originated in the bureaucratic rigidity of the
FBI and the institutional bias displayed by some members of that
institution. <p>
  The behavior of the FBI in the Weaver case revealed their
troubling unwillingness to work as a team player. If the FBI
could not be in control or it its views were not adopted, the
FBI participated in an unreasonable manner by either refusing to
cooperate or going through the motions of cooperating while
exhibiting a negative attitude. Examples of such behavior
included the intransigence that the FBI showed with regard to
its opposition to the case agents conducting the interviews of
the Iowa witnesses, the unwillingness of the FBI to accept and
work with representatives from the other investigatory agencies,
the failure of the FBI to actively assist the USAO by providing
expert assistance, [FN1592] and the resistance of the FBI to
producing materials that the USAO believed were discoverable. <p>
 [G.J.] <p>
 [G.J.] <p>
 The FBI is supposed to work together to assist the prosecutors
in developing and presenting criminal cases for trial. In the
Weaver case the FBI lost sight of this crucial responsibility. <p>
  When decisions were made by the USAO with which they did
not agree, the FBI found it difficult to accept them and to
proceed with the task of preparing the case for trial. This
problem appeared both to emanate from the managerial levels of
the FBI and to filter down in a diluted form to the case agents. 
We also detected a prevalent and troubling attitude among
members of the FBI that they are the superior investigators and
that all other investigative agencies are inferior. This
attitude was detected by the other agencies which served to
further weaken the already fragile working relationship. <p>
  Although we sympathize with the pressures under which
members of the USAO were operating in prosecuting this case, we
were left with the impression that perhaps further actions and
discussions might have lessened or resolved the disagreements
between the USAO and the FBI. With regard to the clash between
the FBI and the other investigative agencies, the USAO appeared
to allow matters to proceed without taking any significant steps
to improve the working relationship among these groups. We
suspect that the personalities involved in these disputes
contributed to the standoff that seemed to exist between the
USAO and the FBI. What was needed was a strong personality that
could have risen above the fray and attempted to resolve the
disagreements and misunderstandings that existed. We are
encouraged by the actions and attitude of the new U.S. Attorney
for the District of Idaho and are hopeful and optimistic that
she and the FBI will be successful in eliminating some of the
problems that have plagued the relationship between her office
and the FBI. <p>
  <H3>4. Conclusion</H3> <p>
  The working relationship between the FBI and the USAO and
other team members in the Weaver case was poor and, in our view,
adversely impacted upon the preparation of the Weaver case for
trial. Active steps must be taken to ensure that such problems
do not repeat themselves in subsequent prosecutions. <p><hr><p>

Byerly did not participate in the acoustical test but was aware

 1540 By Fall 1992, the relationship had deteriorated to such
a point that Assistant U.S. Attorney Marc Haws drafted a
memorandum of understanding ("MOU") between the USAO and the
FBI. Lindquist Interview, Tape 2, at 8-9. According to Howen,
the relationship had become so poor that Ellsworth was ready to
state that the USAO would stop trying cases referred by the FBI
if they did not stop trying to control the prosecutions. Howen
Interview, Tape 11, at 10-11. The MOU set forth terms of
cooperation to be followed by the USAO and the FBI when working
together in preparing major criminal cases for trial. The last
version of this document was transmitted to Glenn and Dillon for
signature; Glenn never executed the document. Howen Interview,
Tape 11, at 10-11; Ellsworth Interview, Tape 4, at 13-16.

 1577 Reynolds FD-302, August 11, 1993, at 6. Sometime during
the pretrial preparation of the Weaver case, Jeffrey Howard, who
at the time was Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General of
the Department of Justice, recalled a meeting with two Assistant
U.S. Attorneys for Idaho and other DOJ officials. Howard
recalled that the Assistants were complaining about their access
to people at FBI Headquarters. It was his recollection that
someone from the meeting called the FBI and made arrangements
for the Assistants to meet with those individuals with whom they
had been trying to meet. FD-302 Interview of Jeffrey Howard,

 1583 Although Howen and Lindquist may not have issued a
specific directive not to document the interviews, the evidence
demonstrates without question that they did not want to create a
paper trail of their activities for the defense to discover and
that the reason that they did not have the FBI conduct the
interviews was because their agents were required to prepare
written reports of the interviews that they conducted. When
questioned about the failure of the deputy marshals to document
the interviews conducted while serving subpoenas, former
Marshals Service Director Hudson stated that he would not permit
an Assistant U.S. Attorney to direct a deputy marshal not to
write a report in order to avoid discovery requirements. Hudson
FD-302, at 9. <p>
 1584 For example, on the subpoena sheet for Chris Colegrove,
Stafford deleted the typed words "not needed" and wrote
"needed." Stafford wrote on the subpoena sheet for Steve
Tanner, "This guy must be interviewed. Ron & Kim, Talk to me
about this guy. JWS." <p>
 1585 U.S. Attorney Ellsworth was unaware that these
interviews had not been documented and had always assumed that
the marshals had agreed to use the FD-302 interview form when 
conducting interviews. He stated that he would have been 
concerned if he had learned that the interviews were not 
being documented since a record needed to be made of
the information collected to ensure that the USAO was complying
with its discovery obligations. In addition, Ellsworth thought
that the conducting of undocumented interviews seemed
inconsistent with the open discovery policy of the USAO. 
Ellsworth saw no problem in documenting all interviews but
stated that there might be some situation when it would not be
necessary. Ellsworth Interview, Tape 4, at 26-28. <p>
 1586 James Reynolds believed that an interview should be
documented if it generates significant information even if the
amount of information involved is small. Reynolds FD-302,
October 3, 1993, at 6. <p>
 1587 In the discovery stipulation executed by the parties,
they agreed "to reciprocal disclosure and inspection of all
material stated" in Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(a)(1) and 16(b)(1). See
stipulation and Reciprocal Request for Discovery and Inspection,
Notice of Alibi and Notice of Mental Condition, dated October
16, 1992, a 1. Rule 16(a)(1)(D) of the Federal Rules of
Criminal Procedure provides in pertinent part that, <p>
  Upon request of a defendant the government shall permit
the defendant to inspect and copy or photograph any results or
reports ... of scientific tests or experiments ... which are
within the possession, custody or control of the government, the
existence of which is known, or by the exercise of due diligence
may become known, to the attorney for the government, and which
are material to the preparation of the defense or are intended
for use by the government as evidence in chief at the trial. <p>
